Combat and platforming are ""sticky,"" rather than fluid, with fixed animations rather than multipart actions that can be canceled out of.

It's got several good things going for it, but a few negatives that stop it from being as outstanding a platformer as 30XX, A Robot Named Fight, or Rogue Legacy. 

It's a Metroidvania that sticks pretty close to the Symphony of the Night formula with a semi-randomized map layout, though this doesn't add a huge amount to the game. This isn't Rogue Legacy where the entire goal is playing the random seed until you die, then start over. You get *ONE* map for the entire game, and dying means that you have to start over from the last save room you visited, Really, all the randomized layout does is prevent you from looking up map/item location spoilers online, and add some minor variation if you decide to start over again from scratch at a later date.  

This randomization aspect can be both frustrating and rewarding, depending on the gaming experience you're looking for. 

Personally, I found it more frustrating than helpful, since there are a few puzzles that need to be solved (like the combination lock) and several doors and chests that can't be reached until you obtain the usual array of Metroidvania items like ledge grab, wall-cling, double jump, and glide, but the lack of map spoilers or ways to place custom markers on the map (you can add a dot the the room you're currently in... that's all) means it can be frustrating to have to backtrack and try to remember exactly which rectangular room is that has the mural or the passage that you need to revisit to solve the puzzle or obtain the item that will get you to the next area. It also means that the rooms themselves tend to be a little generic and you'll encounter lots of standard left-right corridors linked up to large up-down ledge jumping rooms with pools of mud/lava/electricity at the bottom. 

The enemy variety is okay. You get just enough assortment to make exploring new areas feel fresh. Unfortunately, these baddies tend to be both overpowered and spread out. Which means that typically, you're alternating between fighting/dodging a single grunt enemy that can kill you in a couple of hits if you aren't extremely careful, grinding lower tier enemies to get a very slight stat increase/free heal/gold, and traversing boring empty space. Projectiles fly further off the screen than you can see... which is both a blessing and a curse. The knife subweapon is the best in the game since on a flat map, you can kill an enemy all the way on the other side of the room without ever seeing it. Unfortunately, you can also agro enemies from the other side of the room without realizing they're there, and they too can fire projectiles from off-screen that can easily kill you if you're low on health. 

Basically, the game does most of the standard Castlevania stuff right (like different weapons having different reaches and attack speeds, constantly getting new upgrades that will let you unlock new areas and finally open that chest you haven't been able to reach until now, and upgradable sub-weapons that follow the standard Castlevania attack patterns) but has some serious balance issues.  

I feel like if the enemies were less powerful and easier to tangle with, and the randomized map design a little more entertaining, I'd thoroughly enjoy replaying this game over and over again the way I do some other roguelike platformers. As it is, I finally beat the game (which has a very frustrating end boss, where the only strategy is to save a ton of money and buy as many health potions as you can afford) and have no real desire to pick it up again for a fresh play-through.",1707217081,1707218202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Overall I was really disappointed and probably won't play it anymore.

Graphically the environments look fantastic - I love the style they went with however that's where the positives stop. The levels are randomly generated which while it sometimes works, 9 times out of 10 I prefer a handcrafted level unless the gameplay is top notch and the game lends itself to multiple playthroughs which this doesn't feel like it was meant for. I think the devs did themselves a disservice by not taking the time to put together some gorgeous environments with what they had. Secondly, there is the main character himself - changing your equipment (other than your weapon) does not change how you look. Throw on chainmail and a bandana and you  still look the same from when you started the game. Just seems lazy. Then you've got the enemy designs which feel pretty generic and looks like they could've been included in an asset pack - again, lazy. Finally you've got the death animation for the non-boss enemies - they all just burn up and evaporate. Just boring.

My biggest problem though is with the combat - it's boring, clunky, and non-intuitive by today's standards. I came across 5 weapons in my 3 hours and they all feel the same and are not unique at all (sword, axe, etc). Sure they've got different base damage and some might swing a slightly different speeds than others but those are the only differences. Same for the magic attacks. Then you've got the limitation of only being able to attack left or right, or with the starting sword *slightly* downward. You can't swing up or down. What modern action platformer thinks that's normal? Then, perhaps worse, is the dodge mechanic. It slides you backwards from the direction you're facing - again, what? It's like the devs didn't want to have to deal with iframes so they went for the only other option they had. What's worse is the dodge mechanic won't cancel an attack, so enemies with a faster attack pattern hit you unless you slowly take your time and do one hit, dodge, repeat which is boring IMO.

Another minor complaint is the traversal through the levels/areas. You've got main level hubs with tunnel waypoints you walk through to different parts of the level and each main hub connects with one another through a warp/teleport point. Why not just make them all warp points and drop the ""middleman"" main hubs Diablo style? Just needlessly slows you down. 

So yeah, overall very disappointing and definitely not worth $20 IMO. If you want to try it out pick it up on a deep discount.",1706981351,1706981520,False,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Una cosa mala, que viene a colación de esto, es que los nuevos personajes, son el mismo, solo que con diferentes capacidades y habilidades, cosa que no costaba nada cambiar un poquito el aspecto del personaje, poniendo una capa por ejemplo cuando es mago o aunque solo fuera un cambio de paleta de color, pero bueno.

El juego es una especie de Symphony of the Night (no los voy a comparar), pero claramente se inspira en él, siendo un poco más simple, aunque también se ven cositas de otros juegos del género y obviamente su propio estilo.
Tiene una peculiaridad que no gustándome a mí los rogelite en general, este si lo implementa de una manera que me gusta mucho, me explico. Cada partida que empiezas, tiene un pequeño componente aleatorio de como se van a poner los pasillos y digo pequeño, pq las habitaciones, cofres, etc. importantes, siempre son iguales, y eso le da un toque muy elegante, que a su vez, si te ha gustado mucho uno de los mapas o incluso quieres jugar una partida a la vez que otro/s amigos, te da un código que puedes introducir al crear la partida y te genera el mapa en relación al código. Así que si quieres jugar siempre el mismo, solo debes apuntarlo y ponerlo cada nueva partida, pero ya digo que no merece la pena.

Creo que a cualquier amante del género le va a gustar, puede que más o menos, pero me extraña que no pueda gustar, insisto, a quien le guste el género. El control es muy agradable y te da todas las herramientas para poder enfrentarte a los diferentes y variados enemigos que tiene el juego, cada uno con sus diferentes estrategias para evitar y derrotar. Lo mismo con los jefes. La música no es muy destacable, pero ameniza muy bien y también es agradable.

Tiene bastante variedad de armas y armas secundarias, con mejoras y diferentes tipos de ataques, para que cada uno use las que más se adecúen a su forma de jugar. Como todos, tiene alguna pequeña cosilla que se podía haber retocado, pero no son molestas. También tiene alguna cosa que no queda muy clara para que sirve y te hace perder un poco de dinero pensando que te va a ser útil, pero bueno, a base de errores se aprende.

Muy recomendado.

with that said, the rest of the experience is great! the pixel art is detailed, expressive, and easy to parse in the middle of gameplay. movement is responsive and has just enough weight not to feel fiddly, which is good given how much of the game involves jumping around obstacles. the enemies are quite varied, but if you’ve leveled enough that they’re not worth the time to fight you can usually weave through a room without engaging at all. bosses are cleanly designed and reward perfect fights with unique items. my only complaint with the map design is that signposting save rooms (similar to the way boss chambers are marked at their doorways) would occasionally save the annoyance of picking the wrong fork and missing a rest stop by one room.

what all that means, then, is that it’s an excellent game with an unnecessary and half-baked randomizer, and with that being its worst sin i’m comfortable recommending it to anyone with a soft spot for GBA-era metroidvania games. you’ll feel right at home.",1706217030,1706217030,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

The enemy design in this game is also fantastic, each enemy is kind of a puzzle you need to solve and it's very satisfying to figure out their movesets. 
I personally think this would have been better with a soulsy style autosave, lose resources style system rather than an old school save points and lose progress. It just feels more respectful of my time if I don't have to lose a bunch of progress.

What keeps this game interesting are the enemies, and equipment you fight and gain along the way. It mirrors Castlevania alot more than most metroidvania titles in terms of gameplay, while still making it different enough.

It's also missing any kind of gimmick that would set it apart from the countless other action-exploration games out there.

Pros:
- The graphics are beautiful. The music is acceptable, but the fact that you can switch it up to a chiptune version of the soundtrack at any time is awesome.
- The game has a nice progression. At first it's confusing, but once you figure out how the warp system works it's fairly intuitive. The challenge ramps up gradually. It's actually kind of hard at the end. 
- I like the system where you save villagers and then go back to town to see what they've unlocked for you. For example, if you save the lady who runs the potion shop, you can now buy potions. It reminds me of the underrated Soul Blazer on the SNES. 
- Lots of extra things to do add a couple extra hours to the game play.
- Enemy combat is a bit shallow, but I really like that the enemies have a few different attacks and they switch things up so you have to stay on your toes and remember the attack patterns to survive. Dying means you have to restart from the last checkpoint, so you don't want to screw up.
- It's really easy to level up. I put this as a pro because the game would otherwise be kind of grindy. Sometimes when your health is low it's easier to level up than to go back to a save point.
Cons:

- The combat is a little wonky. You have a backdash to avoid enemies, but it takes too long to react so it's basically useless. Also, if you attack while standing, you are locked into position. The correct way to play is to attack while moving because this keeps you in the running animation so you can go in for a quick jab and retreat.
- The magic is mostly useless. Once you beat the game you can unlock a mage class that lets you enhance the magic a bit, but in the default game the knife is the only useful magic you get. It's nice that you can upgrade the magic by using gems that you find around the dungeon, though. 
- The sub bosses are pretty weak. I would've liked a few more real bosses, as six bosses is too few, especially since this game can take ten hours to complete if you don't use a guide. The game overall could've been a bit longer though. 
- This game supposedly has procedurally generated dungeons, but it didn't seem to have any impact on my game. I guess this was supposed to be the game's gimmick, but it doesn't really have much bearing on anything.

Overall: A good, but not great game. For the indie genre of metroidvanias, though, it's solid. I really enjoyed exploring the dungeons, unlocking different items and going back to town and figuring things out. Oddly enough, it's not hard to 100% this game because the map will mark where the items you are missing are located and there are only a tiny number of hidden rooms. If you like running through games and then going back and unlocking all the things you missed, then this is probably a good game for you. If you like more strategic games that make you weigh the pros and cons of your decisions, then this is not really good for that since it's essentially mindless hack and slash until the very end, and you don't really have a ton of creative input on how your character develops.",1695264917,1695264917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I was really looking forward to finally giving it a whirl, even after the lukewarm reception it received.

To put it simply, Chasm is the most 10/10 6/10 game I've ever played. The potential for a great game was there, but it never landed the goal in a way that pulled me in fully. It felt like it was half-tugging me along for the ride, and I kind of stuck with it just to see where it took me.

My initial perception of this game was a 7.5, but as I continued, I became more and more disappointed. 


[h1] NEGATIVES [/h1]
The game started to feel more and more the same as I moved on. I'd traverse an area, beat a boss, get a power-up that allows me to progress, then repeat. This is pretty normal in metroidvanias, so this was expected. However, the real problem is how the traversal itself felt. There is a LOT of platforming sections, usually sprinkled with annoyingly placed enemies that only aggro you when you are in their attack range. If you get hit, you will most likely fall down and have to redo all the platforming. Usually the end result of this would be a mediocre item that was worse than what I already had..

Okay, so the platforming was overdone and repetitive -- and the loot from the platforming side areas wasn't rewarding. Well, surely the loot I'd get from backtracking with my new upgrades would be better than my current weapons, right? One of the final items I could obtain was a chest that required basically doing EVERYTHING else in the game first. The item I received? A sword that had worse range and less damage than my current one. It had a cool name, but that's all it had going for it. 

The obvious elephant in the room is the fact this game has procedural generation. It feels like it added nothing to the game, but could have been neat if done in a way less repetitive fashion. It's not even interesting procedural generation, as when I ran through the first area on a new save, I already knew where the direction of all all the key locations. Those were the same. I feel like this had potential, but ended up just adding nothing and making the game not feel as hand-crafted.  Saves and portals are also usually annoyingly placed, and there are some sections that really could have used more saves or ways to quickly navigate around..


The game also has a lack of environments, as only 5 giant 'levels' exist. I feel like I would have preferred way more interesting areas and enemies over just having 5 levels that repeat enemies. The pixel art is fantastic, but the backgrounds make every room feel the same. 

[h1] POSITIVES [/h1]
I do want to bring up the positives of this game, as I honestly still had a pretty great time. It's worth it for a fan of SOTN that's looking for that same kind of itch and has already played all the other similar metroidvanias (ds/gameboy castlevanias, timespinner, bloodstained, etc). 

The UI is very clean and enjoyable. 
The sound design felt pretty good. 
The animations were clean and most enemies were very readable. 
Enemy design was interesting, outside of the constant repeat designs..
Having leveling up in a metroidvania is something I'm very fond of :) 





[h1] NEUTRAL [/h1]


The game has item rarity. An item from a chest or enemy can drop as white, blue, or yellow. Yellow has a INSANE stat difference from the base white item. I feel like this would have been neat if the game was longer, as there is no reason to farm for these. It is exciting when one drops, and I was carried by one I got in the midgame for a while. I feel like this is a mechanic that is almost interesting, but the game isn't deep enough to warrant it. The depth it does add doesn't actually add anything to the game besides potential FOMO.

You can rescue villagers. These villagers give one time quests. You get rewards for completing their personal quest. Very basic design and I wish it was expanded on more, but I did appreciate it being there. I'd have liked it more if it was more akin to Castlevania: Order of Ecclessia or Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin quest systems. 

Weapon design could have been heavily improved on. You basically have short-ranged daggers, over the head weapons, and longer range swords.. I did get a unique weapon near the end of the game that was a throwing sword similar to the one in the Castlevania games. That was very cool, but I wish the game had more of these ""holy shit"" weapons. Everything kind of blends together.



[h1] Closing thoughts [/h1]

If you're craving a Gameboy/DS/SOTN Castlevania game - I'd maybe recommend this game for the sale price of $5 -- but it's nothing groundbreaking. I felt left wanting more. It's almost SO good. 

If you're craving a general metroidvania? Don't touch this game. There's a billion better metroidvanias to go play. Only play Chasm if you've already exhausted them.",1688776308,1688776445,False,18,0,0.621413528919219971,0,True,False,False,True,,,

1.процедурная генерация карт уровней и паролей к загадкам.Зачем такое с картами в метроидвании - хз.
2.каждый уровень на карте отрисовывается отдельно,и переключаешься между ними чтобы посмотреть что где забыл/упустил,
3.необычная(и на самом деле бесячая) система телепортов.У каждого уровня есть несколько комнат,которые ведут в одно помещение,из этого помещения можно телепортироваться на другие уровни или внутри текущего.С одной стороны это удобно,как обычный телепорт в других подобных играх,с другой точка сохранения в таких помещениях есть только на первой локации.Чуете чем пахнет?Лишней беготней к этой самой точке сохранения.Т.к.точек сохранения на самом уровне оказалось мало,и,чтобы сохраниться побыстрее(и безопаснее) приходится вот так летать в первую локу ,это быстрее чем на своих двоих бежать к точке сохранения на карте. И при этом нет телепорта(вернее он есть но в свитках за золото,и обратно пешком возвращаться) в деревню где есть торговцы и НПС,у которых берешь квесты,покупаешь предметы и т.д.
Примерно так выглядит ситуация когда здоровья мало,нужно сохраниться а бежать далеко.Идешь в ближайший телепорт на уровне,оттуда в первую локацию,там сохраняешься,и тем же путем возвращаешься. Это довольно быстро начало бесить.
4. Спорное отличие.Тут при сохранении не восстанавлиается мана,аналог сердец из кастлы.Мана расходуется на броски вторичным оружием,и некоторые спецудары оружием если такая возможность у оружия есть. Все было бы нормально не назови это маной,назови сердцами и все логично,сколько потратил столько и собирай,но в деревне есть чаша которая восстанавливает ману полностью.Выглядит как ерунда какая-то.
5. Награда после боссов.Она чисто символическая(если не сказать издевательская) +3 к максимуму ХП. Что такое 3 ХП когда к концу игры ХП уже ~250,а враги сносят ударами по 20-30.

В остальном может напомнить Castlevania SotN или Bloodstained RotN из-за различных видов оружия,спецударов этим оружием и вспомогательным оружием(кинжал,топор,бумеранг и т.д.),наличием бестиария,бэкдэша,выпадением из монстров различных предметов, золота,еды... В общем на этом сходства и заканчиваются. Очень хотел бы видеть вместо бэкдэша перекат ибо более функциональный.

Oh yeah, I didn't review this yet.
[i]Chasm[/i] is a Metroidvania...-lite (?) with procedurally-generated biomes. That sounds like it shouldn't work, but it's mostly serviceable. In fact, I had a good time with it. The biggest knock against this game is just that the story lacks gravitas and the world lacks mystique. It's neither punishing or easy; neither serious or hilarious. The pixel art is pretty good though. You aren't helping an epic adventure play out like you are in [i]Hollow Knight[/i] or [i]La Mulana 2[/i]. It's more like concatenating a few [i]Super Mario World[/i] levels together. [i]Chasm[/i] is something to do while you wait for better Metroidvanias. Rank: [b]D[/b]

Примерное такое ощущение сопровождало все мое прохождение. Я не могу сказать, что она плохая... но она совершает ряд таких ошибок, которые можно было бы простить игре с хорошей историей, хотя бы. Сама по себе история тут есть, но она очень поверхностная и просто по пунктам выдается игроку. Нет никакой вовлеченности в эту историю. А без этой атмосферы и истории, прочие мелочи становятся более заметны и раздражительными.
...
Что мне понравилось в этой игре, так это то, что она не совершает каких-то крупных ошибок и в ней нет багов(да-да, иногда и простые платформеры иногда ловят баги вроде зависания(привет Теслаград Ремастер)). Еще тут неплохое разнообразие боссов. Они интересно проработаны(кроме червя). Ну и понравилось оформление сейв-комнат и портальных пещер. В общем-то на этом все.
...
Весь Мир построен под определенный неразнообразный трафарет, который интересно исследовать только в первый раз, а возвращаться, что бы что-то там закончить уже не особо интересно. Некоторые места во всех зонах игры банально копируются копи-пастой.
Все враги умирают одинаково - они сгорают. Это выглядит глупо и примитивно.
ОЧЕНЬ не понравилось отсутствие переката и то, что его заменили шагом назад - это периодически сбивало с толку и вместо избегания урона, Я банально наскакивал на врага. А еще некоторые враги или быстрее догоняют, или дальше бьют и этот шаг бесполезен. Я так понял, что разработчик попросту не смог реализовать нормальный перекат через врага и сделал проще - отскок. Так, во всяком случае, ощущается.
Однообразная музыка.
Мне показалось, что работа с инвентарём и крафтом слабые. Часто в сундуках сложных комнат лежит намного слабее вещь чем то, что тебе давно выпало с какого-то рядового монстра. Или последний крафт у кузница на деле оказывается на порядок слабее такого же дропа.
Еще сильно бесила последняя волна монстров на Арене. Они наносили какой-то дикий урон и Я эту чертову 3-ю арену проходил в 10 раз дольше чем местного босса и чемпиона этой арены, которых убил с первого раза.
А, кстати о боссах... все мини-боссы и боссы, после второго ""легко"" или ""нормально"" закликиваются просто в лоб. Кроме последнего босса игры, все после 2го босса - это пришел в комнату, включил щиты и тупо фигач самым сильным мечем в инвентаре. Все! 
В общем, какую-то долю удовольствия от этого приключения Я, конечно получил, и посоветую попробовать игру тем, кто любит платформеры и метро-идвании, но: (1) по скидке (2) только любителям этих жанров, так как остальным будет, скорее всего, скучно.
Игру, если ""в двух словах"", можно описать так: какой-то любитель решил сделать свою первую игру по стандартным наборам графики и предметов из интернета, и по стандартным смысловым наполнениям(история, диалоги). Получилось вполне удовлетворительно и без ошибок... но и без чего-либо, что могло бы выделить и запомнится.

I feel like I have played this exact same game a few times now and this is the worst attempt at just another ""symphony wanna be"". One of the biggest problems I had is baked into Chasm, being the procedural generation. I personally like the idea of a metroidvania that on some level is generated. You can't look stuff up really, and the replayability is higher. BUT WOW do the rooms just become so repetitive, and in an adventure exploration game that is the worst. At the time of writing this I actually haven't played Chasm in about 4 months and I can't seem to remember a single boss fight or song that stuck out to me sooo I most likely won't be touching this one again. If you are looking for something similar but with more attention to detail, both Death's Gambit: Afterlife and Phoenotopia: Awakening offer unique adventure experiences with their own RPG elements.

Não é o caso de Chasm, que tenta misturar algumas mecânicas e eles não trabalham em harmonia entre si.

O primeiro e maior ponto positivo de Chasm é o seu pixel art. A sua arte é bela, convidativa, vende bem a imagem do jogo. O problema é que ela não é o suficiente pra entreter totalmente, não é só de gráficos que é feito um jogo. Junto com o pixel art, os controles do jogo são bons, responsivos, são dois pontos altos no jogo.


Agora senta que lá vem história: quando peguei ele pra jogar, estava bem empolgado (afinal, eu adoro o gênero) e a repetitividade do jogo me cansou ao ponto que abandonei ele. Muito tempo se passou até que me veio a vontade de jogá-lo novamente (não lembrava exatamente o porque de tê-lo abandonado). Como eu não sabia exatamente onde eu tinha parado, eu comecei um save novo e depois de um tempo jogando (e fazendo algumas conquistas) eu consegui me situar onde eu tinha parado no primeiro save. Na minha primeira vez eu parei o jogo com cerca de 80%, ponto onde geralmente a história ta caminhando pra chegar alcançar o ápice e ter a conclusão. Pra uma pessoa abandonar um jogo quase no fim, alguma coisa tem de estar muito errada.

Você é um soldado que é designado a ir para uma cidade, onde chegando lá, descobre que todos os habitantes desapareceram, entrando nas minas pra investigar a situação e a partir daí o jogo se desenrola. O mapa é criado de forma procedural, onde cada novo save, o mapa é criado de forma nova. Essa não é a melhor das ferramentas pra colocar em um metroidvania, porque pra fazer backtrack (revisitar áreas pra pegar itens) é uma porcaria. Segundo que essa forma procedural nada mais é que modificar algumas áreas, esticando-as com partes pouquíssimas diferença. O mundo do jogo ocorre a maior parte dentro das minas, não tendo muita variedade, então depois de um tempo, aquele mundo que parecia fabuloso por causa do pixel art se torna cansativo (some isso com o fato das áreas esticadas, pra piorar a situação).

O design do jogo também tem suas decisões questionáveis, onde os checkpoints são quase inexistentes quando você chega nas últimas áreas do jogo (tem uma parte que é um labirinto, que você vai até um portal, pra ser teleportado e desarmar algumas armadilhas pra conseguir avançar, nessa parte além de não ter checkpoint, quando você pega o portal, o jogo não indica pra onde você vai antes dele ser ativado). A movimentação do personagem é lenta, e mesmo que você fique usando back dash pra tentar fazer o personagem andar mais rápido, não parece adiantar muito (existe na cidade um comerciante que vende porção de velocidade, depois de liberar os cidadãos. Com ela fica agradável explorar, mas é uma coisa que você só vai ter noção lá pro meio do jogo, isso se você sair das minas pra gastar o gold na cidade, porque é mais provável você ficar nas minas e esquecer que a cidade existe, porque tirando as missões secundárias, não tem nada que te motive  a ir pra superfície).

Se você quer jogar algo que gere um mapa novo a cada jogada, melhor procurar um rogue-like. Quer jogar um metroidvania? Existem outras opções que com certeza vão te oferecer mais conteúdo, como Guacamelee. Ou te oferecer um gameplay diferenciada, como Dandara Trials of Fear Edition, isso só falando por baixo. Chasm não é um jogo inteiramente ruim, mas é um jogo bem mediano.

Very disappointed in the ""randomly generated, rogue like"" aspect of this game. I did 3 full playthroughs for achievements and I was going into the 2nd playthrough really looking forward to see what changes between seeds. There were definitely some changes, but those only went to the extent of the 2 puzzles having different solutions, enemy positions being slightly changed, and the rooms being mixed up just slightly enough to where its noticeable in some places, but not noticeable in others. If the rooms didn't all look so similar I think this would have been much better. Even the rooms that I could tell were different layouts from what I had already seen, looked exactly the same visually as the rooms before it, so nothing felt new or special during my playthroughs of the different seeds.

(Slight spoilers in this sections if anyone cares). This game also does a horrible job at explaining things, which for the most part is fine because of how straightforward it is, but I spent a good 3 hours of my first playthrough just wandering around confused trying to figure out what to do next. One part of that was from main story progression, where the game suddenly goes to a dead end after a bossfight and you're supposed to figure out which place to go to next. It threw the basic idea of ""kill boss, go to next area after boss"" out of the window and I had a very hard time trying to figure out where to go next. The second part of it comes from the sight potion having a weird description and me not understanding that it reveals hidden chests in some rooms. I figured it would do the same thing as the secret detector and reveal hidden pathways, but this potion was required for the last item needed for me to 100% my first playthrough, and I spent a really long time confused on what to do next until I looked it up and realized exactly what the sight potion does. Spending 2-3 hours on these things that shouldn't have been issues just wandering around confused and backtracking through the areas I've already backtracked through many times was very annoying, and I would have much preferred my first playthrough didn't have this.

Even with these complaints, I still enjoyed this game. I enjoy the combat and I think the game looks very nice. Very solid game overall, I just wish these 2 issues weren't as prevalent as they were.",1677700406,1677700406,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

The game environment and design is definitely what caught my eyes and made me go through the whole game for the first time. Pixel arts and animations are not bad, but they are captivating in their own way. The soundtracks sets the environment well but there is not variety whatsoever, you'll be listening to the same tracks throughout the whole scenario.

Art-wise: this game is cute, it does its work trying to captivate its players and maintain them engaged and immersed, in my opinion, but it doesn't stand out in any means.


Gameplay has its high and lows. At the same time there are some incredible potential with mechanics that allows you to express yourself throughout exploration and combat, they are not there during most of the gameplay, and are absent especially at times when you would make better and more frequent use of them.

Your mobility is almost non-existent when you start the game, and basic move speed is not really fast (it isn't slow either); gears and potions that you can get from merchants in the game have awful cost benefit; and some progressive/evolution-based items are not accessible in the beginning.

It puts a nail in the coffin by provoking you with areas that obviously have loot but are inaccessible with your current movement options, requiring you to backtrack very, very often.

Once you unlocked all skills needed to loot and clear all stages, you already finished the game, literally. There is also no NG+ by the way.

Enough with negative criticism, the combat feels good and rewarding on its own way. Albeit it really is repetitive, you can embed movement into your aggression and optimize your damage output in minions or bosses, which is great. After some point in the game, all monster have different patterns and strategies to deal with you, such as lunge attacks, ""anti-airs"", blocking, ranged attacks, often they jump or fly evading some of your options too, and they are also cycling through these options when available, reacting accordingly to what your decisions are. 

The combat is not hard by any means, but it permits you to express yourself in the most creative way you can find to deal with each opponent. And there also enough variety of monster each room so you don't ever get bored.

Added to that, the platforms are made in a way that you also have to be careful about how you pass through them and sometimes even alters the combat dynamic when monster are present. Parkouring through platform challenges is also very fun and you feel great when you finished courses quickly with perfect movement.

Gameplay-wise: Lots of potential and it progressively feels better as you progress, being the start of the game the lowest point in this regarding.



Story wise there isn't much to tell, the game isn't very focused in story-telling. There are no cutscenes other than the introduction, the whole plot is developed through speech bubbles when you interact with NPCs or when some specific events occurs. Maybe it's better this way but the story is not super elaborate or involving.



Yeah, short game, not much to it. It's a hidden gem if it feels cheap for you. Yet it is not a great game I would pick before looking for better options.

Whoever, I do suggest you keep it in track and play it whenever you have the possibility. The game is not a waste of time, had lots of fun with it.

It stayed in my backlog until now, and I finally beat it as I try to get through my enormous backlog.  The main issue with the game is that it's very slow, dull and boring for far too long.  I powered through the absolute dolldrums until I was about 2/3rds of the way through, when things started to pick up.  Unfortunately, even though things started to pick up towards the end, it was still marred by constant backtracking, somewhat clumsy controls, and obtuse direction as far as progression.  As a lover of both classic roguelikes and roguelites, I have to say that this game does not benefit from randomization; it would have been far better if it were hand-built.  Like Spelunky or The Binding of Issac, the biomes are made of pre-made levels that are randomly assorted.  Unlike Spelunky or The Binding of Issac, none of this matters.  There's no fun/exciting/chaotic systems that interact and give meaning to the random arrangement of assets.
So basically you're left with a mediocre metroidvania, a genre that is packed to the gills with amazing games, so why would you play this when there are so many better games in the genre to play?  There's nothing really exciting or unique here to draw you in, especially considering how slow and boring it is from the start, and although I adjusted to the controls, they aren't as elegant as many of the better games in the genre, which also marred initial impressions.  If someone were new to the genre, and wanted to check it out, I would recommend Hollow Knight, Bloodstained, Castlevainia: Symphony of the Night and all of the subsequent GBA and DS games, any 2D Metroid (Especially Fusion), even other randomized metroidvanias like Rogue Legacy before this game.

Chasm does almost everything well... Except the absolute core of the experience, the combat. Otherwise, this game is absolutely gorgeous, a top-notch metroidvania i'd compare to games like Blasphemous.

The deal breaker for me, that now made me put the game down - long story short, your attack animations take too long to finish. The majority of the enemies in the game sort of just walk at you (many of them have an additional attack or two) and deal contact damage upon touching you. This is par for the course for Castlevania-esque games, but the problem here is that your attack animations lock you into the attack for far longer than the enemies take to recover from getting hit. It's almost impossible NOT to trade hits with a lot of the enemies in the game, and it's not because they are inherently hard. It's because you spend more time fighting the controls than the enemies.

It's not impossible to play around, but there's something inherently wrong about a game where you spend more time learning to play around a problem rather than actually master any gameplay mechanics. When i succeed, it's typically not because i used the tools available to me to their fullest potential - it's because the arena i'm fighting in has the necessary space, and the enemy i'm combating gave me enough time to recover from the awful slow swings of literally any weapon available to me other than the dagger, for me to be able to jump out of the way before they reach me.

It's probably fine on easy and medium difficulty, but i mostly enjoy these games on hard. The game is visually beautiful and it sounds great. But because of this clunky, clumsy, awkward combat, i found myself never truly enjoying the game - it was always kind of tedious, i was always forcing myself to push on in the hopes it'd get better. Halfway through ""world 4"", it hasn't gotten better, and after dying to one of these issues (enemies that walk at you while you're swinging at them with your attack - you hit the enemy, the enemy freezes for a split second, then it keeps walking at you while you are still stuck in your attack animation) and realizing i just lost ~10 minutes of progress because of the extreme sparsity of save points, i decided the game isn't really worth the frustration anymore. It's just... Such a slog. I'd rather go play Death's gambit or Bloodstained, another two gorgeous castlevania-likes that i believe does this right. 


Don't get me wrong, Chasm is a gorgeous game, but this problem with the combat breaks it for me. I just don't have fun because of it. Just 0.1-0.2 seconds less recovering from attacks might be all it takes to fix it. But considering the game has been out for many years, i don't know if the developer(s) would consider it, for fear of alienating the people that do enjoy it as it is, or breaking something unintended.


In the end, i have to give this a positive, because it is otherwise a really really good game. But the combat is seriously getting in the way of my enjoyment, and you might likewise feel that it ruins the game for you.

I thought to myself when I saw this. It looks great, classic Metroidvania design, something about a roguelike... well, I'm sold. I started playing it, and after some 30-40 minutes I realised something isn't right. Something about the environments, the enemy placement... and then it clicked:

This game has randomly generated environments which contain handcrafted rooms, but everything is cut from the same cloth.

It's not like the game doesn't explicitly state that, mind. It's written on the store page and you're given a seed input when you're starting a new game... but the way the game starts, with its plot, varied starting environments and other little things you pretty much forget about it. And that's why it stings so bad - because of the unfortunate truth that we found out about way too late in the gaming world:

[b]Procedural generation cannot create meaningful content.[/b]

I don't know why that is - I've seen someone speculate that it's because of ""lack of intent"" that is clear to see. What this means for the game is that exploration very quickly becomes a slog rather than an exciting adventure. In good Metroidvanias there's a lot of variety even between individual rooms - either due to different enemies, little graphical details or different backgrounds. Point is, you can always tell that you're ""elsewhere"" - but here it's almost like you're on a treadmill; moving forward, but the world stays the same.

Of note is the fact that this game's combat is clearly inspired by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, with its distinct swing mechanics and the backdash, not to mention the way the inventory is presented. And yet, nobody in the reviews seems to mention it or even be aware of it. This is absolutely terrifying to me - that such a foundational text of the Metroidvania genre is already so forgotten. Getting old sucks, you know? Then again, by today's standards SotN isn't too special, so maybe that's for the best...

Anyway, I'm mentioning this not because I want to out myself as an old man yelling at clouds, but because putting those two games side by side showcases perfectly why the drab, randomly generated environments and uninspired enemies completely ruin any good that Chasm could've inherited from its classic predecessor. 

And that's all there's to say, really. It could've been something good, but the mechanical ""level design"" and boring enemy variety make the gameplay simply not very fun. Everything else loses all relevance because of this central flaw.

[h1]Calificación: 3 de 5[/h1]

Recomendación: Lo recomendaría solo a quienes les gusta el género, una vez que lo terminas es fácil que se quede acumulando polvo en tu biblioteca, si no lo tienes no te pierdes de nada hay muchos juegos similares en todo sentido.

Resumen: Es un juego de aventura de estilo clásico lo principal es la exploración, el combate y la resolución de puzzles.

Gráficos: En el apartado gráfico es bueno siguiendo el estilo retro del pixel art, sin embargo no es tan detallado como otros juegos del mismo estilo por lo que ve algo simple.

Sonido: Tanto la banda sonora se siente muy genéricos por lo que mas de una vez te aburrirá la música de fondo.

Jugabilidad: En general con el tiempo te das cuenta de que requiere de mejoras en la precisión y la responsividad de los controles especialmente en varias situaciones donde recuperarte rápidamente de un ataque es crucial, las mecánicas con los enemigos a la larga se hace monótono y tedioso, no pasa lo mismo con los BOSS FIGHT claro porque tienen más variantes en sus ataques y una vez los derrotas no vuelves a verlos.

Historia: A mi en lo personal no me engancho, la trama es predecible y aun que cuenta con historias secundarias nunca llegan a nada.

Duración: Yo me hice mas de 50 horas, pero no tanto porque me hubiera gustado si no porque el mismo juego te hace recorrer todos los mapas una y otra vez (y porque quería desbloquear todos los logros), pero si sabes a donde llegar terminas el juego bastante rápido.

Conclusión: El juego en sí no es malo, lo que le afecta mucho es que la formula ya está muy desgastada no es juego que sea fácil de recordar o jugar de nuevo después de haberlo terminado, a pesar de ser un RPG no te incentiva a jugarlo por segunda vez.",1674598514,1674598514,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Hopefully developers preventing my death by chiptune versions, but really save my ass is one track, that you can hear several times during the game. You gonna love this: “Rescue the Townsfolk”.

• When an enemy dies, he necessarily leaves flaming particles and raw chiptune sound of flames. You will hear and see it 1000 times per game. Sometimes you will pay attention to it and get a little annoyed

Chasm is a game that has a great premise; a metroidvania that is procedurally-generated in order to make each playthrough unique. Sounds great. It isn’t.

Fortunately, the combat is where the game shines; it feels tight and responsive with multiple types of weapons and enemies for you to learn. The pixel art graphics are great with the only downside being that your equipment is not visible which is a real let down. The music is also very solid albeit a bit short with one main track per area but there is a toggle option to enable a chiptune version for some variety.

J'ai été d'abord attiré par le côté Metroidvania du jeu, et sur ce point-là il est plutôt décevant: vous arrivez dans un village vide et entrez par la porte des mines, pour explorer des environnements souterrains (pas très nombreux et complété dans un ordre précis) dans le but de sauver des villageois et battre quelques boss et sous-boss. Il n'y a pas beaucoup d'endroits uniques et intéressant, ça se résume très souvent à avancer en battant des ennemis et en traversant des phases de plateformes pour arriver au boss, à un bouton ouvrant une porte ou à un accessoire qui augmentera votre palette de mouvement.

Cependant, les combats sont plutôt sympa (surtout avec une dague comme arme selon moi), le bestiaire est varié, le pixel art est vraiment beau surtout dans le village, le jeu est accessible (voire trop simple même en mode difficile pour ceux qui cherchent du challenge, une fois les potions débloquées on peut spammer les soins et les attaques ennemies sont toutes esquivables facilement quand on connait), les armes principales et secondaires sont sympas à utiliser et les boss sont cool à affronter.

Pour finir, le jeu se veut avec une grande rejouabilité, où vous débloquerez le système de classe de départ (guerrier, mage, voleur) après la première victoire sur le jeu et sa génération procédurale qui ne se ressent pas vraiment à la première partie mais fais plaisir pour les prochaines, si vous avez toutefois envie de refaire le jeu.",1673359532,1673359592,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

・良いと感じた事
操作性が良く、探索中にダメージを受けた時には何かしらの原因があり
改善すればノーダメージで行けるという納得が出来る事。

武器の種類によって戦法が変わり楽しめた。

最初はスキルが低くてマップの移動に制限があるが
特定のアイテム入手でストレスが一気に解放される事。

マップにマーキング出来るので気になるポイントでマークして
後で探索しやすい事。


・物足りないと感じた事
日本語非対応なので、お使いイベントで〇〇を◆個持って来いという事が読み取りにくく
苦労しました。

クリアしてしまうと やる事が無くなります。
より強いアイテムを手に入れてタイムを縮めるとか
強い状態のまま最初からスタートしたり
無限ダンジョンで地下何階まで潜れるとかの要素があれば
なお良かったと思います。

Also the very limited shop selection that never refreshes itself is not great either. If you don't do what I did, which is saving pretty much all your consumables for bosses, then you will easily find yourself only able to rely on the potion seller for healing in combat. Also I think that certain NPC questlines were a bit lackluster and underdeveloped, not to mention the cooldown on the mana pool in town. Would it really hurt to be able to let your players experiment with their spells freely in the hub area? Overall, it is a good game, but some issues that could be solved through either updates or a sequel.

Неплохая метроидвания аля snes, ps1. Однако привыкал долговато, из-за этого не раз ловил эмоциональные возгорания в процессе. 
Самый момент который возмущал это то, что ты не можешь двигаться, пока анимация удара не закончится. Видимо у меня уже есть привычка к неким стандартам подвижности главного героя в платформерах. Еще очень важно своевременно забегать в места сохранения, ибо при смерти теряешь все, а у меня бывало что шастал по игре больше часа без сохранения и когда случайно погибал, было чертовски обидно, все открывать собирать заново. Некоторые вещи полезные вещи из врагов выпадают случайно, потому можно какую то крутую штуку потерять практически безвозвратно. 
Но когда нормально прокачиваешься, привыкаешь к врагам и к управлению то играть нормально. И в целом играть интересно, и сама игра не сложная.

It's going to take awhile to finish though because it has some major issues that leave me wanting to put it down not long after I pick it up.  It has a lot of the things I desperately want that developers refuse to put out.  It's not a roguelike, which it feels like every game like this these days is a roguelike that acts like the ability to save is going to ruin the experience.  It has a lot of old school SNES type mechanics, some good, some very dated.

The Pros are it looks great, the art and assets are all nicely done, it has an inoffensive soundtrack, and I haven't encountered any bugs of glitches in my time playing so far.  It plays well and the controls are responsive, mostly.  The story isn't anything crazy unique, but it's honestly not bad for the era that this game emulates.  I want a hack n' slash platformer, metroidvania experience.  This game does that.  It also has some insanely glaring flaws though that leave me extremely frustrated.

The cons aren't all that many to list, but they are rampant.  Enemy design is awful, mechanically.  Enemies are either extremely boring to fight, or make me want to just uninstall the game.  Ranged enemies are often standing on the edge of something, so that you cannot jump up to them to fight them.  You have to dodge their projectiles while making a series of jumps to get to where you can jump toward them, attack from the air, and then fall and repeat that process.  They deal contact damage (an extremely dated mechanic that should have died a long time ago imo.) so you cannot just jump onto the same platform as them.  Repeated jumps, attack from air, fall, repeat.  It's tedious.  There is a spider enemy that is lightning fast in every direction, has the ability to lock you in place with a projectile that you cannot dodge while also being able to attack, and stays out of attack range unless you are locked down.  This makes them nearly impossible to hit while they harass you with high damage, high speed attacks, while there are other enemies around.  Scaling is also really bad.  Enemy damage nearly tripled from one area to the next, while they also gained a bunch of frustrating mechanics like the one mentioned.  It's not a gradual climb in difficulty that scales with your growing power.  Your power barely moves while enemies skyrocket.

It's worth mentioning here that player attacks aren't any kind of sophisticated thing.  You can attack in one direction, and jump, and have a nigh useless backstep.  Mechanical complexity for the enemy while you have NES era capabilities on the player character is not a fun mix.  

Player movement is well done, mostly, but the platforming in this game is honestly tedious because of level design and the insanely slow progression of the ""metroidvania"" aspect where you get new movement tech that allows you to reach new areas.  Larger platforming sections often come with tons of hazards and require pixel perfect jumps or you end up falling and having to start the section over.  The controls are fairly tight, but they are not tight enough for what's required to not be annoying.  Wall jumping gets especially tedious because the controls for this are done very differently from other games like this, and it feels pretty janky.  Sections that would be simple in a hundred other games like this turn into a massive chore because you're fighting the clumsy wall jumping controls while trying to remain perfect.  The controls for grabbing things mid jump are also very unresponsive.  

The game, on paper, looks like I should love it.  But every time I play it, I eventually hit spots that are frustrating, and not even close to in a good way.",1668477838,1668477838,False,1,0,0.505238652229309082,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Je vais être honnête, je suis un énorme fan des metroidvania surtout les Castlevania dont il est clairement inspiré d'ailleurs, que ce soit le bestiaire, l'HUD, les armes ou les sauvegardes. Malheureusement en terme de plaisir de jeu/exploration on en est loin.. peut-être est-ce son côté old-school voulu qui fait que le level design est aussi désagréable mais en tout cas c'est pas un point positif du tout.

Au fur et à mesure des niveaux les sauvegardes sont de plus en plus éloignées et si vous avez le malheur de mourir un peu trop souvent vous en aurez vite marre de refaire le chemin. Perso j'ai joué en difficile, même avec les meilleures armures on prend assez cher. La magie est anecdotique, les armes le sont aussi malheureusement donc on a pas le plaisir de tomber sur des armes ultra puissantes et rares.

Pour être honnête ce n'est pas un mauvais jeu mais il est pas incroyable non plus, tout juste moyen. L'histoire est classique mais suffisante, sauver un village et devenir un chevalier qui n'en a jamais rêvé ? La musique est sympatoche, le pixel-art est beau, les fights sont rigides mais jouables et les boss sont pour le coup des vrais boss, ça se first try pas aisément sans potions.

Ce n'est pas un mauvais jeu, mais je l'ai trouvé plutôt rigide. Il se fonde sur des fonctionnements classiques, donc, il fait penser à d'autres jeux. Cela dit, la gestion du monde en procédurale et bien foutue. Le début est assez peinard, et en approchant de la fin, ça devient de plus en plus rogue-like.

Le pixel art est bien maîtrisé à mon avis, et j'ai trouvé l'univers assez beau. Il n'y a pas non plus une énorme variété d'environnements car le nombre de niveaux est restreint.

J'ai beaucoup aimé les musiques. Je les ai trouvées simples et efficaces, et même si elles ne sont pas nombreuses, jamais elles ne m'ont lassé.

Le gameplay ne m'a pas semblé extraordinaire. J'aime bien le côté exploration, mais les combats m'ont barbé par moment, du fait de la possibilité de ne frapper que devant soi, ce qui peut être assez lourd quand il faut vaincre un ennemi volant sur une plateforme minuscule. De plus, le personnage ne se retourne pas très bien, et parfois, je frappais d'un côté alors que je sautais de l'autre, et ça n'a pas toujours été pratique. Je n'ai fait qu'un seul run, et je me demande pourquoi on peut forger des armes en météorites (qui n'ont pas l'air d'être les meilleures) alors que je n'ai jamais mis la main sur le moindre lingot de cette fameuse météorite. Quand j'ai eu fini, il me manquait plusieurs choses à trouver, mais je n'ai pas eu le courage de retourner les chercher. Faut dire que le gap entre le dernier niveau et les précédents et quand même assez costaud, et ça m'a un peu saouler. Pour vaincre le boss final, je suis retourner au village, j'ai acheté plein de potions, et j'ai bourriné en restaurant ma santé quand il le fallait, donc j'ai trouvé ça un peu bidon.

Sinon, l'histoire est basique, mais c'est cohérent et bien amené.

Le jeu a bien tourné sous Windows 10, et à part ce bug de retournements qui ne marchent pas super, je n'ai rien remarqué de gênant.

C'est pas que ce soit un mauvais jeu, mais je préfère ne pas recommander Chasm car on peut largement s'en passer. Il n'y a pas de véritable défi (à part passer par moments certaines phases de plateformes avec des contrôles pas très précis, ce qui pour ma part, à tendance à m'irriter), et, le fait de ne pas vouloir chercher ce qui me manquait reflète le fait que je n'ai pas trouvé ce jeu très accrocheur.

Chasm feels decent, but the weapons could be snappier, and there's this weird hitch on long jumps.  I think the game is trying to decide whether to attach you to a wall or not, but it definitely feels strange.

 There's also this random, what is supposed to be rogue-lite. element to the game, that I think Chasm suffers from.  Rather than spend time on a carefully curated experience, the developers implemented this randomization that shuffles around the dungeon every run.  That sounds great in theory, but keep in mind this is a Metroidvania, it isn't a run based game.  I just can't see the benefit of a random dungeon over one that is well designed.

It falls apart in the level design. It's quite uninteresting and boring, and also gigantic, which doesn't help at all. Drawn out corridors connected to another drawn out corridor, connected to a vertical shaft identical to the last one. Traversing the map almost puts me to sleep. 

Like many others have said, I blame the procedural generation. Combining metroidvania with procedural generated maps is a cool experiment, but one I recognize as not quite successful. There are no advantages to the procedural generation in this case, since you are unlikely to play the game more than once, but you do get all the disadvantages of it.

Anyway, the controls are fine. They respond and definitely try to play SUPER safe of any tricks like backdash cancelling or whatever. But leave in the best normal of land cancelling attacks.

I was less worried about my damage number and more about how to just use the longest range option that wasn't horrible. 

At some point there was a grind for drops and it also just felt not great. At the heart of the game, there is something there its rough and probably went in some angles to try to be different.

While I do believe the game does have a decent foundation there's just too many things I didn't like to be able to recommend it to others. The biggest issues being the gold gain vs cost, item drops, and level layouts. 

The largest and most glaringly obvious issue I had playing the game was the item drops. The average enemy kill count for me to obtain both drops was likely around 120-150 kills. The smallest being under 50 and most being over 300. Not only would farming for these items take a ton of time, there is also another rng factor on top of an item drop and that is rarity. Drops seemed to be based off of the luck stat which I averaged about 50 by the end of the game, but wasn't a stat that would really get boosted unless you got items or drops from enemies. As such I didn't get to start playing around with building my character until around the end of the 2nd dungeon, going into the 3rd. 

The second issue was the accumulation of gold. Lamps and enemies had a small chance to drop money either when destroyed or defeated. Often times however it would be a bag of 5 gold. This meant that the main income for gold was to be good at the slot machine that seemed mostly based on luck, or to sell equipment drops from enemies that the player doesn't use. The issue here being that most equipment drops come from farming enemies, so a player that doesn't want to sit and grind for 6-10 hours killing enemies for drops is going to find gold hard to come by. On top of this many enemies require multiple hits to kill even early on. With healing items once unlocked being expensive, this means the main way of healing comes from save rooms. However, these save rooms are often few and far between in maps. It should also be mentioned that enemies do not drop health orbs so the only ways of healing were either items such as food, potions, or save rooms. 

Which leads me to the level design. While the levels themselves weren't bad many of the rooms felt either needlessly big or simply just empty. It was also often in these rooms that I would find enemies standing at the corner or edge of a platform I needed to get to in order to progress making it difficult to not only kill them but from falling and having to go through the rooms platforms again. My first instance of this was in the mines when I needed to pull a lever but a rock orc was in my way throwing projectiles while I was trying to jump up onto the ledge. There were instances where I as a player didn't know where I was supposed to go as once you finish going through the keep you will then start backtracking to previous areas to use key items in rooms that aren't shown to be special rooms on maps, making progression after this point tedious to the player.

A couple more minor issues I had were systems like the roulette minigame that I found twice. This game could either grant the player a stat upgrade or a stat downgrade. Whatever you get being permanent. I found it not worth playing as there was simply too many slots to loose versus what you would gain. Another minor issue I had was magic. I assumed magic would be a spell, and to an extent they are. However, I didn't realize the magic was only purchasable and was things like magic (insert weapon name here) or magic shield. Because how to use magic isn't clearly explained I didn't have any viable magic I could use until late game, making the pool of mana I had absolutely useless. 

My final issue came from potions. Many of the shops you gain access to by saving villagers when exploring the many areas. One of these villagers sells potions. Upon rescuing her you may already have a recipe or two which she will take and make it a purchasable item from her. However, many of the potions, especially the better quality ones run for about 200 gold, a hefty price if you don't have much. On top of this a few chests require potions you will unlock later in the game, and one requiring you to go back to her just to purchase one that you just unlocked to then gain the final potion that's used only for one reason. Not only does collecting all the potions require a lot of backtracking it also requires the player to have all the artifacts. The most easily missed is the diving suit used only for a few locations in the garden and obtained by beating the arena. In my game the arena was a chore as there was no save room nearby that I could go to between attempts, and losing meant game over.

I want to like this game, and I think it has a lot of potential but in it's current state I just simply can't recommend it to others. Much of the rng that make up a lot of my problems could be fixed with a few tweaks. While some items are rarer than others it shouldn't take 30 minutes of grinding just to get a single rare drop. Other problems could simply be solved if the game had more direction for the player such as the issue I encountered with magic, and not realizing how it worked until late game.",1661813725,1661813725,False,20,0,0.700874090194702148,1,False,False,False,True,,,

Chasm to własnie takie połączenie metroidvani, RPG oraz roguelite w jednym. Gatunki te, pomimo, że są różne, to doskonale potrafią się uzupełniać, o ile twórcy umiejętnie je połączą w jedną całość. W tej grze połączenie gatunkowe wyszło całkiem zgrabnie, ale twórcy popełnili jeden błąd, a mianowicie założyli, że w ich grę będą grać tylko inteligentni gracze. Czemu jest to błąd zapytacie? Ponieważ gry nie da się przejść bez samodzielnego myślenia, a losowo generowane rozwiązania zagadek, mocno utrudniają korzystanie z poradników i gotowych rozwiązań. Mi takie podejście pasuje, ale patrząc po dyskusjach na Steam oraz niektórych recenzjach, nie każdy zrozumiał założenia twórców, co wpływa na oceny tego bardzo dobrego miksu gatunkowego. 

Skoro już we wstępie zacząłem temat losowości, to pozwolę sobie wyjaśnić ten wątek do końca, aby czytelnik zrozumiał z jakiego typu grą ma do czynienia. Gra opiera się o ziarna, ma więc dość dużą, ale jednak skończoną ilość wariacji, a dodatkowo komnaty nazwijmy je główne, zawsze są w tym samym miejscu. Oznacza to, że mapa niezależnie od ziarna, będzie bardzo zbliżona, a główne zagadki zawsze są te same i zmienia się tylko rozwiązanie( aczkolwiek rozwiązanie zagadki i podpowiedzi nadal są w tym samym miejscu). Nie jest więc możliwym, aby wylosowało się ziarno w którym nie ma możliwości przejść dalej gry, bo zmieniają się tylko komnaty łączące komnaty główne. Konstrukcja gry wymusza na graczu powracanie do wcześniejszych lokacji celem zdobycia nowych zdolności, co pozwoli pokonać przeszkody w późniejszych etapach. Niestety gra niezbyt czytelnie komunikuje taką konieczność i zwyczajnie spora liczba graczy, potrafi się zaciąć i zrzuca to na losowość w grze, co oczywiście prawdą nie jest, bo schemat przechodzenia gry zawsze jest taki sam. ( grę przeszedłem 3 razy i za każdym razem schemat zdobywania zdolności był dokładnie taki sam, niezależnie od ziarna). Jak sobie uświadomimy ten fakt, to zrozumiemy, że gra jest losowa tylko w mocno ograniczonym stopniu, a ziarno wpływa tylko na komnaty łączące i pojawiające się tam przeszkody, przeciwników oraz skarby. Między bajki należy więc włożyć zarzuty graczy względem tego aspektu gry. Natomiast dla osób, które uważają, że wrogowie w późniejszych etapach są za trudni, gra oferuje możliwość zagrania na poziomie łatwym, który też testowałem w ramach osiągnięcia ""mortal"" i mogę śmiało zaświadczyć, że wtedy walka z bossami i potworami jest wręcz banalna.

W swojej konstrukcji gra jest typową metroidvanią ze wspomnianymi wyżej elementami losowości znanymi z gatunku roguelite. Przemierzamy więc świat stworzony w przyjemnej dla oka grafice piksel art 2D, skaczemy po platformach omijając przeszkody oraz walczymy z przeciwnikami, ale aby było ciekawiej twórcy dodali całkiem rozbudowany system RPG. Naszą postać określa szereg współczynników, które rosną wraz ze zdobywaniem przez nas wyższych poziomów doświadczenia. Jest dość klasycznie, aczkolwiek należny mieć na uwadze, że system ten jest raczej mało elastyczny i pomimo możliwości ""rozwoju na magię"", trudno nie zauważyć, że prawdziwych magów tutaj nie ma. Jedyną ""magią"" w grze jest broń rzucana, która zużywa manę, a bez której można się całkowicie obyć. Dodatkowo build postaci oparty jest głównie o ekwipunek, który wpływa na statystyki, więc pomimo zawartych w grze sklepów oraz mini craftingu u kowala ( raptem kilka rzeczy na krzyż), to w dużej mierze jesteśmy skazani na to co nam wypadnie ze skrzyń i potworów. Broni oraz różnej maści zbroi i hełmów w grze jest całkiem sporo jak na taką produkcję, więc takie podejście nie jest wadą, aczkolwiek warto mieć na uwadze, że ilość buildów z prawdziwego zdarzenia jest mocno ograniczona. Lepiej zdać się na los, który ""wyekwipuje"" nas po drodze do celu. W ramach ciekawostki można jeszcze dodać, że wyrzucane przez potwory przedmioty oraz te znajdowane w skrzyniach mają różne statystyki zależnie od stopnia rzadkości (zwykłe, magiczne oraz legendarne).  W grze dostępny jest też bestiariusz dzięki któremu możemy dowiedzieć się jaką broń, przedmiot lub zbroję można wydropić z danego mobka, co ułatwia ""farmienie"" konkretnych przedmiotów.

Gra Chasm przypadła mi mocno do gustu, a jedyne zarzuty jakie przychodzą mi do głowy, to średnio czytelna mapa oraz taka sobie muzyka bez polotu, a jedyny utwór który mi się od biedy podobał, to ten w katakumbach. Grę przeszedłem w całości grając na Steam Decku i brak opcji zbliżania mapy, mocno utrudniał orientację w grze na małym ekranie ( dobrze, że Steam Deck ma wbudowaną opcję lupy). Problem z czytelnością mapy występuje też na większych ekranach, tym bardziej nie rozumiem braku opcji przybliżania. Więcej grzechów nie pamiętam...

[h1]PODSUMOWANIE:[/h1]

Chasm to dobry miks gatunkowy z naciskiem na metroidvanię. Zarówno element RPG jak i losowość znana z gatunku roguelite, są tylko dodatkiem urozmaicającym rozgrywkę, a nie daniem głównym. Jeśli szukasz dobrej metroidvani, to własnie ją znalazłeś. W innym wypadku lepiej sobie daruj i szukaj dalej.

[b]PLUSY:
+ Ładny pixel art 2d
+ Ciekawe zagadki
+ Dobra konstrukcja świata
+ Elementy losowe 
+ Sporo broni i sprzętu
+ Projekt potworów i bossów

MINUSY:
- Taka sobie muzyka
- Średnio czytelna mapa
- Brak opcji zoom na mapie
- Magiem raczej nie pogramy[/b]

[h1]OCENA:
8/10[/h1]

[h1]**Ograne na Steam Decku**[/h1]
[b]Problemy: Mało czytelna mapa ( opcja lupy rozwiązuje ten problem częściowo)
Gra działa bez zarzutów i nigdy się nie wykrzaczyła na tym urządzeniu.[/b]

- The music and sound design were completely appropriate and fit the world.
- I really enjoyed exploring each new area thoroughly even if you don't need to. There's a lot of discovery here, and it's mostly worthwhile.
- The controls are tight and do exactly what you want when you want them to.
- Ran great the whole time.
- Excellent spritework.

CONS:
- Sometimes you'll get lost and have no idea what to do because signposting isn't super clear after a point. If you don't remember what you found two hours ago and where it was, you may be screwed into doing a ton of wandering. This made things drag on multiple occasions to the point where I had to consult the internet (which I think is a cardinal sin). Even then, the random nature of the game makes even this imprecise.

Still by far the largest gripe for me is: 
The useless back-dash just grinds my gears. Just jump instead. Jump to attack, jump to dodge, jump to progress. Jumping is superior to the back-dash in every way possible and it makes me so annoyed I can't play the game anymore. Just thinking back on this makes me rant so i'll stop now.

My biggest gripes are the obnoxious hitboxes, hurtboxes, contact damage and fact that your character needs a cooldown between each action. It's just not fluid. This is a shame because every single enemy is unique and encourages a dance of combat...except your movements just can't keep up and the environments are often too narrow to properly maneuver. By mid game, I was bunny-hopping everywhere, just because it increased swing speed and mobility. By endgame (especially the final area) I was skipping all combat and then tanking the last boss with an inventory full of healing items.

I understand it's a bit easier if you stack magic and spam throwing knives. Your mileage may vary.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+Plenty of things to grind, like XP, upgrades, drops, cash, logs, secrets
+Proper metroidvania in terms of exploration and length
+Frequent hub areas for fast travel
+Enemy drops generally useful
+Rare versions of drops for higher stats
+Most enemies require a little bit of strategy
+Can swap gear to focus more on magic or melee
+All 80-some enemies are nearly unique with no recolors
+Colorful and well-animated
+Boss doors are marked, with saves nearby
+Multiple difficulties
+Arcade and Race modes of play for those that want a challenge

[h1]YMMV[/h1]
~Enemies never really drop health
~Health items can be stacked and used anytime to cheese bosses
~Very few iframes after being hit. You can get ping-ponged in a few spots.
~Could have benefited from some iframes when backdashing (like a dodge roll)
~Enemies aren't staggered by attacks and just keep charging you
~Occasional annoying platforming
~Music is ok. Nothing memorable, but nothing terrible.
~Bosses drop some OP gear if you manage to kill them without getting hit
~Some enemy drops are rather grindy
~Not much of a story or any kind of character development
~A few spots where the game gives little or no direction
~A few powerups that are only used in one or two spots

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
-Movement is stiff, with long cooldowns between actions
-Melee weapons are just too damn small and slow
-Enemy placement necessitates taking damage in many areas
-Enemy contact damage
-Difficulty rollercoasters a few times
-The order in which you obtain gear is baffling. Some pieces are vastly superior to others, and are obtainable early (not even including the boss drops).",1657394748,1657394748,False,5,0,0.580039501190185547,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are a lot of things I love about this game, and I was really enjoying my time with the first half of it, but I think as others have said what ultimately undoes it is the random world map. This isn't a roguelike where the caverns change every time you descend into them, it's a metroidvania with a set world that persist for the entire game (in my case an 11+ hour 'run' so far) - basing that world off of a random seed really does a disservice to what could have otherwise been an amazing game.

I really wish the random seeds (which I assume were added for replayability) were confined to new game+. As it is I found segments of my world generation were insanely hard to complete, with bosses at the end of long sequences of unusually high difficulty rooms set miles away from a save or travel point. There were times when I was forced to farm 'safe' enemies over and over in the middle of a journey to a boss just to try and heal from levelling up - which understandably became harder and harder to do the higher my level got. I will add I'm an experienced metroidvania and roguelike player - I don't think my perception of the random spikes in difficulty/grind come down to me being a bad gamer.

Sadly after many hours of enjoying myself, the generation of my world seed has turned the latter half of the game into an impossible grind fest that I just don't want to slog through anymore.",1656298595,1656298595,False,47,0,0.79564744234085083,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Chasm é o ótimo exemplo de quando o jogo tem uma ideia ótima, mas fica apenas na ideia mesmo. Aqui vou falar dos porquês que eu julgo que chasm é um jogo ruim.

Eles tentaram, mas tentaram muito mal fazer uma mecânica onde a história é linear, mas os mapas mudam de sala toda vez que você morre. O problema começa quando há apenas 3 ou 4  salas aleatórias e você acaba sempre caindo nas mesmas salas, fazendo o jogo parecer um ‘looping’ infinito dos mesmo mapas com os mesmos inimigos nos mesmo lugares. 

Falando nos inimigos, você fica até feliz de vê um inimigo diferente, até ele se repetir para sempre nas salas seguintes, quando você finalmente troca de área, inimigos novos aparecem, até eles serem só os mesmos na área inteira.

Os gráficos são bonitinhos disso não tenho do que reclamar.

The generation is limited, due to having map progress being gated by essential items that grant you mobility abilities.

Downsides:

Controls aren't up to modern standards, they're not completely terrible but there are some annoyances - 
1. no attack buffering means you need to time your attack very well or they just don't happen and your DPS drops significantly
2. missing ""coyote time"" means you will miss important jumps from time to time
3. lack of leniency on jump height - sometimes you reeeeally gotta hold that jump button - or again, you miss your jump
4. problems turning around in-between attacks
5. You have more control mid-air than on the ground

Fetch quests - this is basically the only kind of quest you'll see, be ready to get reeeally familiar with the route back to the ""base""

Music is alright but over my 13h playthrough it started to get very repetitive

Very weak knockback on attack made fighitng a bit annoying at start of the game, but on the other side having to respect enemy's ability to move probably made the combat more interesting for the rest of the game

Punishment for death is a bit too much (normal difficulty), you lose ALL progress since last save - including exploration and collectables.

And I wish there was a better stats comparison between items when you equip/buy/sell them, as well as ability to sort in some of the popups

Chasm é um muito genérico e mediocre perante oq ele poderia ter sido se tivesse usado todo o dinheiro arrecadado da forma certa, mas mesmo assim eu considero ele um jogo ótimo, eu realmente me diverti jogando ele, mas não consigo passar pano para todos os problemas que eu citei antes. Diversas pessoas irão ter experiencias diferentes por conta do Level Design aleatório estilo ""Roguelike"" dele, então basta você comprar e testar para ver se gosta ou não, pois gosto é relativo,

An interesting tweak on the Metroidvania Formula where a number of elements of the map are randomly seeded.  This unfortunately doesn't quite go far enough to make the game really fully replay-able as there are still all the same basic setups for each of the same basic areas, but it does mean that things remain structurally coherent and basically seamless in ways fully randomized games sometimes do not.

The underlying game is overall though quite decent, with solid bitmap style graphics and good sound/music.  The overall progression somewhat suffers a little from the randomization as you are never fully confident you find all the things in the right order and sometimes you can end up missing something without realizing it and needing to do significant back-tracking to determine just what that actually is. That also becomes an issue with several 'potions' you need to get recipes for to do single secret treasure rooms which feels a bit like an afterthought as most of those have basically no actual gameplay utility, and are only used to solve the one treasure/puzzle room they are needed for which can more often than not only actually get you one other thing to solve one other treasure room somewhere else.  

Despite suffering a little from that randomization it is still quite impressive how much of the game does remain solid to the point of feeling more like the areas were hand-crafted and that tech is quite impressive in the results on that front, it just feels a little under-utilized without more direct gameplay impacts or replay value.

In the end I do recommend it for anyone who does like Metroidvania style games, but don't be too ashamed to go peek at some walkthroughs to really figure out how some of the progression needs to work, as you are never going to be 100% confident if you are missing an in-game ability to progress, or whether you just missed something in an area you need to back-track to complete.",1652115442,1652115442,True,2,0,0.550172984600067139,0,False,False,False,False,,,

具体的玩法细节上我就不多说了，战斗部分做的打击感其实还不错，数值平衡也还行，重武器轻武器都有优劣之处，前者攻击范围广，后者攻击速度快，到了后期基础STR够高的情况下用小匕首不少时候dps比重武器还要高。

回血很难，没有metroidvania（类银河战士恶魔城）常见的掉回血道具的效果，高难度下同等级的敌人一下就是五分之一的血（easy差不多十分之一），开荒经常残血或者死非常累人。但是实际上boss难度不高，摸清了出招模式之后甚至可以打无伤（无伤过会有奖励boss武器，面板数值比同级别武器面板高而且攻击前摇后摇也短）。

地图设计是一大败笔，虽然宣传上号称添加了程序生成要素让每周目体验都有不同，但是实际上基本可以理解成“固定的重要大房间+连接的程序生成走廊”，实际体验并没有什么让人感觉能产生探索欲。重点在于metroidvania应有的分叉和迂回在chasm里非常少，整个地图基本就是线性跑路——碰到传送门回到传送间回血存档——继续线性跑路；除了少量剧情救人和一眼望到的奖励箱收集，能够游离在预设路线之外探索的就只有每个区域一个的隐藏门区域，玩家自由探索空间限死到几乎就差糊脸上警告“你只能走这一条路”。至于拿到新装备折返回到以前探索过的地方收集遗落道具和救人的时候，长距离的走廊跑路又会加剧游戏带来的枯燥感。

街机模式简单试了几局，感觉上就像去掉meta要素纯跑高分和速通的硬核版死亡细胞，把程序生成的随机要素不能说废物回收也只能说是有效活用。但是相比之下绝大多数roguelike都会在有限的选项中给予玩家一定自主配装、选择自己喜好或擅长的打法流派的空间（比如死亡细胞哈帝斯以撒），而chasm的街机模式……不能说裸装高玩，至少也是捡到啥就用啥，没得选。

可以说，chasm各方面许多元素都是建立在对恶魔城系列的致敬上，但是如果拿一个优秀metroidvania游戏的评判标准来评价chasm的话，只能说如果想玩一个比较有趣能留得住人的同类型游戏的话我恐怕更推荐公理边缘和Environmental Station Alpha。",1650557274,1650557642,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What you have here is an attempt to make a Castlevania game in the mold of Symphony of the Night and the games on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS that followed its design. When it comes to the core gameplay, it mostly succeeds at reproducing what worked in those games. So much so that I found myself humming Castlevania music over the game's own, forgettable score as I played. The pixel art is nice if you're into that aesthetic, although I admit I spent way too long flip-flopping on leaving the CRT filter on or off. (Off, I decided.)

Confesso que esperava mais dele, ele não revoluciona em nada e absolutamente nada do jogo é impressionante, ( jogabilidade questionável, ost pouca imersiva, enredo fraquíssimo, etc.. ) não espere inovação, não chega a ser ruim é claro, posso dizer que em todos os quesitos o jogo é bem mediano e linear, pouco desafiador a ponto de não morrer uma única vez no modo normal que é recomendado pelo game, combate e level design meio repetitivo,  itens e armas não muito variados e mal aproveitados, apesar de tudo,  até que foi gostosinho de jogar pq gosto mt desse estilo de jogo e me dei o trabalho de platinar rsrs... Único ponto forte que vale a pena ressaltar é a pixel art e alguns puzzlers do jogo. Fora tudo isso não tem nenhum diferencial que faça o jogo ser único!

In that quest, I played a game called Chasm. You begin as a novice knight in a kingdom and are tasked with traveling to a hamlet called Karthas, a village that has been beset with some tragedy. There are a number of locals who have disappeared within the town's mines, and it is your job to recover them, discover the cause and save the day. Without going into the whole story, there is more to the mission than first appears, and in the course of rescuing the denizens of this place, you will uncover a deeper, darker, ancient mystery (of course, lol). The narrative is presented via documents that you find and text-based interactions with the villagers. I found it fairly intriguing, but it certainly wasn't the main reason I remained engaged.

The structure of the game is a procedurally generated series of underground maps. The layout is randomized, albeit with pre-formed rooms. There is still the familiar metroidvania pattern of unlocking new skills and tools to progress to previously unreachable areas, so if you only play it once, you'd never know that there is any element of variability to the appearance of the maps. There was a very nice sense of being rewarded when discovering a new artifact or tool that enabled you to parachute, climb, double-jump or maneuver yourself into previously inaccessible regions. So exploration was consistently engaging with only some typical, but moderate, frustration when you didn't know where to go next. There were some rpg elements in the form of magical weapons, leveling, RNG drops including rare items, crafting, gear, healing and buff items, and so on. There were plenty of options to make your character and his abilities fairly unique. There were also side-quests that the rescued villagers doled out that, if completed, rewarded you with some additional benefits.

In terms of the mechanics themselves, everything controlled very tightly. Things were smooth, very responsive and fun in a moment-to-moment sense, and it made learning the patterns of the game's many enemies all the more satisfying as I wasn't fighting with poor input. There were a variety of bosses, including a pretty tough final boss, and they were - along with the many normal baddies - designed well and had an interesting appearance for the most part. Speaking of appearances, the overall look of things was quite nice. The different maps were varied, from jungles and caves to lava and otherworldly locales. The map feature was as Castlevania as can be with the square rooms everywhere, and viewing any map could make you think you were playing a Castlevania game. I also really appreciated the ability to mark rooms that may have had something interesting, but inaccessible so that I didn't have to guess where I wanted to return later on.

On the down side, this was obviously made by a smaller developer, and it shows in the sense that it's missing some of that special sauce in terms of presentation you would expect from a game that was developed with more funds and resources. It's got its own personality, but it's just clearly a work of a more modest budget, which is fine, but sometimes you miss the glitz. But in the bigger picture, I have to acknowledge that it was hard to put down once I started. I played close to 20 hours to complete things, including some side-quests/extras, and I did it all in a pretty short span, so there is no doubt that it kept me engaged all the way through. It's not a classic in the genre, but I don't regret playing it at all, and can certainly recommend it to anyone who considers themselves a fan of the genre. 4/5.",1647632690,1647632690,True,1,0,0.535733640193939209,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Every aspect of the game feels like a chore rather than a fun challenge. Every game design decision feels like it is made to just make the player's life a tedious grind rather than a fun exploration RPG.

Here's more details on why I felt that way.



Level design

The  platforming in this game is incredibly tight. Most of the actions you're required to do to progress have very little leeway. Rooms are littered with mostly small platforms that quickly just become 1 character-length blocks as you progress.
And when you think it can't be worse, the game adds more obstacles because, for some reason, it felt like it was still too fun.

Of course, around those small plaftorms are traps and other mecanics like crumbling or timed platforms that will make it even harder not to fall.
You will eventually get an upgrade allowing you to grab on ledges, but not all platforms are eligible
Also you'd better not want to do any other action, like attacking, during that jump because you cannot attack and grab in the same leap (unlike most other games of the genra.)

But if you fail you'll just have to try again right ?
Yeah, but you'll also pretty much always take damage because the floor is lava in most of the rooms.

Of course, a fair number of rooms are also designed in a way where if you fall, you have to redo the whole room from the start without any single mistake.

Coupled with the constantly tight platforming and traps that will undoubtedly make you fall relatively often, the level design and platforming is tedious.


But can it be that bad to take damage and retry when you have an RPG system to heal and become stronger ?
Why yes, it can.



RPG & Combat

Stronger is not the word I would use to describe the combat progression in this game.
Levelling is grindy from the start. And while it does provide a much needed full heal on level up, one will find out that you do not gain level often enough that it will actually save them much.

Levelling up also feels underwhelming. You don't get much stats and/or it doesn't seem to make your combat abilities that much stronger. 
At some point I even cheated to get from level 19 to level 49 and saw that my damage had gotten from 40 to 57 with the same weapon.
And while I would accept some grind to get there, I did cheat for one reason: XP given by mobs decrease with each level you gain. 
So to attain that level 49, which was around 100 000xp when I was at less than 10 000, I would have had to defeat around 80 000 enemies since they would have started to each give me 1xp per kill by the time I had gained a few levels.

Levelling is tedious, and the rewards do not justify the investment.


And then there's combat.
Your character doesn't feel like a brick, but they do not feel nimble either.
If you're not constantly jumping while attacking, you'll get hit because of the delay at the end of your attacks.
There is no backdash cancel, so most of the time it you timed your attack wrong you're done. No way for you to avoid damage.
You also have to constantly keep close to mobs if you actually want to hit. No matter what your weapon is, your range is very limited and mobs will have better range than you most often that not.

Basically you have to git gud pretty fast, otherwise combat will be you attacking the air while mobs bash you from a safe distance.
Also their AI is better than you. They know their perfect distance of attack and use it constantly.

On another note they also have a tendancy to stay on the side of the platforms you wanna go to, so that you'll either abort your jump or take recoil damage from them when platforming.
Of course, you'll end up in the pit of instant DOT damage whenever that happens.

Back on combat a fair number of mobs are either faster than you or have ranged attacks, making them even more of a bother with your very limited range and not so nimble movements.

As for you, you have one ranged option: magic. However, magic is a misnamer because it's actually just throwable items that consume mana, and it's not mana but actually ammunitions.
Basically it's not mana: it's the heart system from castlevania games. It throws some manner of distance weapon that consume a fixed number of ""mana"" point, that you can ony recover from drops on mobs or breakable lights. No ""mana"" regen there: it's just ammunition-based.
So yeah, you have a relatively limited amount of distancee options, and the drop-rate is too low to make it worth it. Also you don't get a free refill when you level up, unlike HP.

And that's it for your combat capabilities. You're pretty limited while mobs can outrange and outspeed you constantly. So you keep taking damage all the time unless you play like a god.

I forgot to mention that mobs and traps hit for usually around 5~10% of your HP. So 20 ""mistakes"" (or unfair platforming moments, or mobs that outspeed and outrange you) and you're dead.

Of course, there is no option to regen your HP that would sufficiently balance out these losses. You have three possibilities:
-Drop from mobs
-Brought potions
-Save points

Mobs don't drop health items often enough, and obviously if you're already struggling to keep your HPs fighting mobs is not really a viable option.

Potions cost money, and they're not available until you rescued the NPC that sells them. Money is still a drop by the way, but at least you can get it from breakable objects... at a low rate. So it's super grindy and makes the game even more tedious.

Save points will heal you completely, if you can make it back to one before you die. Most of the time you can, of course. However, it's not fun to have to constantly run back to one as the most valid option to get health back. No fun to be found there.


I could go around and describe more of the game, but I've already described the core of any game: its gameplay. And this one feels like a chore to play.

There is a reason why, as I discovered earlier, only 1/4 of players got to the 3rd boss and beat it (the achievement Titan says 24.6% of players did the job)


As such I cannot recommend this game. It is clearly not what I wish to play.

백대시는 있지만, 이동용으로나 쓰던 악마성 월하 때에 더 가깝고 간단하게 캔슬이 되는 것도 아닌데다 공격 도중에 취소가 되는 것도 아니어서 쓰다 맞기 쉽습니다. 일러스트에선 방패를 들고 있길래 방패를 통한 액션을 기대 했지만, 그런 건 없더군요. 전투에는 도움이 별로 되지 않는 백대시가 아니라 방패를 들고 방어하고 치는 것이 게임의 움직임에 더 잘맞았을텐데...

장비 몇가지는 고정된 스팩으로 나오나 대다수의 장비는 몬스터 처치시 드랍되는 장비들로 

이 장비들은 어느정도 정해진 범위 내에서 무작위로 능력치가 달라지기 때문에 레어,에픽,레전드로 나뉘어도 레어가 레전드 보다 나을 때도 있고 레전드가 나와도 능력치가 별로면 또 파밍을 해야하는데 일반적인 진행으로는 도저히 만족할만한 스팩의 장비가 쉽게 나오질 않아 긴시간 노가다를 하던지 해야 겨우 얻을까 말까 ?

한번 행운을 엄청 높여서 테스트를 해보니 100 LCK 전후를 기준으로 드랍율이 엄청 좋아지기는 하지만, 2개 드랍 하는 몬스터가 1개만 내놓질 않나... 파밍에 있어서도 그리 좋지는 않았습니다.

게다가 캐릭터의 크기가 작으면서 무기들을 활용하기 쉬운 게 아닌 것이 대형 무기들은 사거리가 간신히 길이가 나와주지만, 딜레이 때문에 치다가 맞기 쉽고. 결국 롱소드 계열이나 채찍계만 쓰게 됩니다. 가장 짧은 주먹 너클계열과 단검 계열 무기들은 공격 속도는 분명 빠르나 경직은 먹어주질 않는 몬스터와 보스의 특성상 접근전에 대한 부담이 훨씬 더 크고

성장도 초반에는 죽기가 쉬운 것이 겹쳐서 무기는 무조건 일정 이상의 길이가 있어야 안정적이라. 창과 채찍이 가장 좋더군요. 그러나 극초반에 이 두 무기들 중 하나라도 나오면 잘 풀릴 수 있으나 아니라면...영;

레벨업을 한다고 능력치가 충분한 폭으로 많이 올라가지도 않는데 게임 내에서 유의미할 정도의 능력치 상승은 정상적으로는 무리였습니다. 능력치가 오르는 스크롤은 몇개 얻지도 못하는데 많이 나오지도 않고 그나마도 무작위로 올라가기 때문에 티가 나지도 않지요. 여러 부분에서 보강하고 다듬어 줬었다면 더 나은 게임이 되었을텐데 그 때문에 평가를 높이 주기는 힘듭니다.

맵 전반에 있어서도 어느정도 무작위로 바뀌는 부분이 있어서 반복 플레이를 어느정도 힘들지 않게 해주기는 하지만, 세이브 장소에 대한 문제가 좀 있고 귀환 스크롤 아이템은 무제한 구매가 불가능해서 정말 피치못할 때 빨리 저장을 해야하는 상황을 대비한 경우에만 쓸까말까 합니다.

돈을 모으는 것도 쉽지가 않은데 비해 단검 투척이나 수리검 투척. 성수(악마성 스러운) 같은 것을 투척 하는 것도 골드를 통해 구입하고 보석으로 3레벨 까지 강화할 수 있으나 다시 플레이를 하려니 클래스를 고를 수 있길래 대충 해보니 마법사로 하지 않는 이상. 소모되는 MP를 쉽게 채울 수 없더군요. 물약을 사면 채울 수는 있지만, 그 물약 구할 돈이 엄청 짜게 나와서 쓴다면 결국 보스전이나 강적 상대로나 쓰게 됩니다. 

기본 직업 기사가 아닌 전사로 플레이를 하면 아예 거의 사용할 MP가 없고 인트 성장율도 매우 낮습니다. 말 그대로 몸으로 떼워야만 하는데 그게 참 어렵고 직업에 따른 벨런스도 그리 좋지는 않더군요. 마법사는 초반 HP등이 너무 낮고 회복 물약도 구할 수 없는 극초반에는 사로잡힌 인질들 중 술집에서 포션을 만들어주는 NPC를 구출하기 전까지 진행이 너무나 힘들었습니다.

회복 아이템도 참... 어이가 없는게 포션은 무제한으로 구입할 수 있지만, 단숨에 많이 구할 수 없었습니다. 보통 방향키를 누르고 있으면 자동으로 몇개 구입할지 카운트가 올라가지만, 그런 건 없었죠.

게다가 정상적인 플레이로는 돈이 무척 쪼들려서 넉넉하게 사는 것이 후반 가서도 힘들어서 플레이는 조심스러울 수 밖에 없습니다. 무슨 특별난 액션이 있고 진행 중에 임시로 HP를 회복할 여지가 적당히 있지도 않습니다. HP랑 MP를 채워주는 샘 비슷한 건 마을이나 투기장에서나 볼 수 있는 편이고 투기장에선 바로바로 채워지지도 않았죠.

요리도 있기는 하나 서너개 정도를 특정 아이템을 구했을 때나 가능한 식이라 이 또한 존재의의를 알 수 없었습니다. 회복량도 별 많지도 않은 편이죠.

숨겨진 아이템을 구하려면 투명한 것을 인식할 수 있게 해주는 포션 제조법과 시간 정지 물약이 필수인데 이런 레시피들은 꼼꼼히 게임을 플레이 하지 않으면 모르고 지나쳐버리는 경우도 생길 수 있고...

일부의 무기는 고유한 강점을 가지고 있거나 특수한 고유기능이 있기는 하지만, 그게 썩 쓸모가 있을 정도는 아니어서 기를 쓰고 구하기도 좀 미묘합니다.

추천은 하지만, 어디까지나 복잡하지 않은 액션성을 바탕으로 고전 게임 즐기듯이 저가로 즐기고 싶다면 해볼 여지가 있는 정도입니다. 고유한 재미가 너무 없습니다. 슬라이딩과 매달리기 천천히 낙하.(보따리로...) 딱 그 정도 액션이 끝이라 액션성은 거의 없습니다.

방패를 구현하여 막는 것도 적과 방패 성능이나 능력치에 따라 밀려나는 정도가 다르게 하고 막고 난 다음. 혹은 막으면서 치거나 베기. 찌르기로 처리를 한다던가 하는 식으로 무기를 더 역동적으로 쓰는 액션에 공격을 취소하고 몸을 빠르게 내빼는 동작의 구현. 

무기의 종류 마다 액션을 추가로 조금 더 제대로 구현을 시켜서 액션성을 확보 해주었다면... 더 좋은 평가를 받을 여지가 있겠으나. 움직임이 답답할 정도로 정직한데 비해 반응이 느린 유저는 전투를 쉽게 진행할 수 없을 때가 많았습니다.

공격과 방어를 즐길만한 기본 시스템이 잘 갖춰진 것도 아니고 회복 물약빨로 밀어붙이는 것도 힘들고 후반가면 적과 싸우기 보다 그냥 피해다니는 게 좋더군요...

剧情平淡如水：下矿洞救人，世界观都没交待清楚就通关了，神秘部落也是非常神秘，根本不知道在讲啥；
再就是存档问题：不支持自动存档（甚至打完Boss或者精英怪都不自动存），死亡只能读最近一次的手动存档，如果不小心退出了就只能重跑重打，存档点一般是途中一个，Boss房前一个，要么就传回第一张图存档，存完再传回来重新跑一遍图；而且只能通过存档点/升级和食物回血，食物也很贵且难掉落；
三是BOSS和小怪的碰撞伤害和技能伤害是一样高的，加上存档和回血很困难，这就使得BOSS战很简单而跑图容错率非常低，死亡挫败感很强；
四是手感，跳跃手感真的稀烂，钩爪判定很迷，还偏偏那么多地形杀跳跳乐，空中碰撞是憨憨硬直掉落；动作手感我就说一点，就是后撤的优先级低于平A，那你整个后撤有啥用，还不如跳跃灵活，要么你就把怪物的动作AI改笨重，不然主角笨重怪物灵活，不伦不类的；
五是道具装备真的太少了，你剧情和动作系统都这么拉了，麻烦就整多点收集要素，加强获得装备得成就感啊，抱歉，一点成就感都没有，因为只有竞技场掉的角斗剑能用。

唯一的两个亮点是：
1.BOSS设计得还不错，无伤还有额外奖励。
2.主线解谜任务道具是随机生成的。

El progreso del personaje apenas da sensación de ese crecimiento, el equipo, que se divide en rarezas (no sé para qué), no posee apenas propiedades que te hagan querer conseguirlo. Jefes con cero mecánicas que los vencías en el primer enfrentamiento. Hay muy pocas habitaciones secretas, unas secundarias que por su recompensa no te incitan a querer hacerlas. El backtracking no me ha gustado en absoluto. Los puntos de salvados y portales mal repartidos e incómodos. Y hablando de incomodidades, el control de personaje se sentía muy tosco y lento. Y la historia… bueno, los metroidvanias no brillan precisamente por eso, pero este… salva una aldea… cero interés saltándome todos los diálogos.

	Dito tudo isto, o jogo me arrebatou com sua arte e visual incrível, o jogo apresenta mecânicas procedurais na construção de sua masmorra, onde o jogador pode resgatar através de uma seed.
	Sua macro estrutura é em sua essência um Metroidvania, onde o herói tem uma variedade de armas a sua disposição, com diferentes animações de ataques, que variam em dano, velocidade e alcance. Os inimigos encontrados no primeiro andar da mina apresentam comportamentos comuns de inimigos encontrados neste estilo de jogo, causando dano ao herói com a colisão.
	Outro aspecto que é muito atrativo para mim, neste estilo de jogo, é a progressão de nível do herói, ganhando Experiência (XP) ao derrotar cada monstro.
	Chasm não esconde sua forte referência a jogos mais antigos, ao desferir um golpe, o valor é mostrado ao jogador e em caso de crítico o número é apresentado com um efeito furta cor, seguido pela própria palavra Crítico.
	A primeira impressão a respeito da história parece ser herói resgatando aldeões da vila Kharta, sendo cada um deles um NPC interagível que vai liberar novas mecânicas ou novos locais a serem acessados.
	O jogo também apresenta um possível mecânica de construção de build ao poder comprar itens que aumentam um dos quatro valores básicos do herói, sendo eles, Força, Inteligência, Constituição e Sorte.
	Como última análise, acredito ser necessário mencionar com mais afinco a arte do jogo, por ser um ambiente subterrâneo os elementos são muito bem apresentados, com candelabros, toras de sustentação de teto, os próprios monstros também são bastante condizentes ao ambiente, fazendo o jogo confortável aos olhos do jogador, tendo diante de si um mundo a ser explorado como uma aventura de RPG de mesa, com elementos apresentados em livros ou pergaminhos encontrado pelo jogador. O parallax está macio dando uma sensação de infinitude das minas.)
Análise por termino de jogo: (Hoje, dia 06/02/2022, concluí esse jogo incrível que me cativou de muitas formas, as músicas, a arte, a vontade de ganhar nível para ficar mais forte, coisas que senti na análise anterior, mas a minha impressão não foi tão boa para a escolha de level design para o ultimo ambiente de jogo onde em certo ponto você não pode voltar para poder salvar ou tentar se recuperar em um save point, então apenas para não indicar um defeito, acho que a solução mais fácil seria permitir a compra ilimitada do pergaminho que lhe traz de volta a vila ou um item no final do jogo com o mesmo efeito.

A few things I think lead to this being average experience.
[list]
[*] Loot is overall boring slot filler items with RNG stats. I imagine this problem turning worse later, as your drops inevitably start to outperform all the chest loot. 
That leads me to my next point.
[*] Exploration is not rewarded. I've played the game for something like an hour, explored everything I could. I found a bunch of npcs and 4 chests. Only one of those chests had a better item to offer and it soon became obsolete too.
[*] Contact damage. There are very few games that pull off contact damage being fair, and this is not one of them.
[*] Movement is a bit floaty. It's hard to land precise jumps and I bumped into enemies instead of jumping right next to them more than I would like to admit.
[*] Some enemies (including starter ones) don't have obvious tells and openings to react to. So for example, if you enter a room and see a drill goblin standing, there's a very good chance it will move (and hit you before you recover) after your first strike, but if you wait for it to move and stop you can land 2 hits safely.
[*] Attacks have recovery times, which cannot be cancelled by back-dash. Combined with previous problem It just makes combat against some enemies feel unfair unless you're using longer weapons. 
[*] It's probably just me, but I got tired of mine music in like 10 minutes.

Procedural generation doesn't actually add much variety to your playthrough due to hard gated progression items. You cannot deviate from the developer's intended path.Map is composed of sprawling corridors which makes backtracking a chore.

Combat feels a little stuff due to lack of backdash cancels, hard animation locks on most weapons. 

Pacing is disappointing. A new weapon is immediately invalidated in a new area as the hp/damage of enemies takes a stark jump, making you never truly feel like you are getting stronger until the very end game. RPG elements have little impact on the game besides the hp/mp replenish upon level up. Your stats are truly dictated by gear and little else. Not really enough unique weapons and armour.

IIRC, I think there was confusion over the proc-gen elements of the game? Regardless, Chasm is a fun Metroidvania romp that stands well on its own.

You take control of a lone Squire, spelunking through mysterious biomes deep beneath a mining town. With each new file, the stages shuffle about their layout and the locations of key items and townsfolk to rescue. Each member of town has a small sidequest line, and many of them offer supplies to the hero. Along the way you will uncover lore about the civilization that lived in this region before... and its dark secrets.

Gameplay-wise, the game is a comfy one for those well-versed in Igavanias. There's a bigger precedence of finding items in various spots, or as enemy drops, than buying stuff. It's closer in feel to Order of Ecclesia or Symphony of the Night in that regard than other Castlevania titles. The weapons you wield also reflect that series -- swords and maces swung laterally, fast daggers and knuckles for up-close carnage, overhead-swung great weapons, forward-thrust polearms, and even long-ranged whips can all be brandished! There are few subweapons to use your MP on, upgraded over time -- three staple Castlevania sidearms, with three unique ones.

Exploration is both exciting and challenging. Resources aren't so easy to come by, so every potion or food item you can secure will matter. Bosses are a test of your skills, but just getting to those battles won't be a walk in the park. Varied enemies, environmental obstacle courses and punishing hazards stand in your way. Because the maps change each time you start a new file, you can't always rely on the layouts you'd encountered in past runs. Add in the optional ""classes"" you can pick from for replay run -- a warrior, a magician, a thief, or the default jack-of-all-trades -- and your skills will be put to the test plenty of times. And if you seek additional glory and tests of skill? Chasm also provides daily and weekly challenges of predetermined maps!

Chasm is your typical hack-n-slash metroidvania game. Start off with minimal abilities, progress through the dungeon, and unlock new skills to help you proceed further and uncover new hidden rooms and content. The only drawback to this game compared to others of this genre is the level of difficulty. During my time playing, it didn't provide much in terms of a challenge and was pretty easy to beat.

THE GOOD:

Chasm does a really great job making you feel like you're on an adventure. You have a small town (your hub) that slowly updates and adds new content/shops as you proceed further into the mines and rescue villagers. You find a nice variety of equipment along the way, as well. The best part being weapons. Each weapon has its own unique speed and style. This, along with a variety of spells, makes combat very fun.

The visuals and artwork is also well done. The first thing I noticed was the fact that each room has it's own unique backdrop. I found this to be a nice feature because it really helped immerse me into the world your main protagonist is exploring. The animations (character and enemy) is very fluid and feels balanced. Enemy deaths are done very well and gives you a sense of accomplishment when you defeat them.

Finally, there's plenty of places to explore and secrets to unlock. This is definitely not lacking in Chasm. You'll uncover tons of hidden chests, items and rooms, with some needing to be returned to once you acquire a specific item (just like most metroidvania games).

THE BAD:

The difficulty. While there were some mobs that gave me some challenge when I first encountered them, their move sets were easily learned and avoidable. I figured, at this point, maybe the bosses were going to be a challenge. That was not the case. I beat each boss (with the exception of the final boss) my first go. I did, however, beat the final boss on my second attempt.

Backtracking. This is very common in metroidvania games and the one part that I absolutely cannot stand, and Chasm doesn't hold back here. It's very common for you to unlock a new area, find climbing gear, and have to backtrack two floors just to unlock another chest... and then proceed further into the new area you unlocked. While many enjoy this, I find it to be repetitive and boring. Especially since you fight the same mobs, which at this point... only take 1 hit in a game that already presented little to no challenge. This would have been better if newer, stronger enemies showed up in the older zones, making them more enjoyable to re-explore.

And finally... armor. While it does increase your overall defense, magic resistance, luck, speed, and other stats... Chasm is missing the one thing I love about most adventure games... your character's look changing. It would have been a nice feature, especially since you find so many different types of helmets/hats and armor. Even a basic color change, or additional shoulder pad, belt, maybe some texture updates to your current look, would have helped. This isn't important to a lot of people, but I've always enjoyed it because it keeps your character interesting, and makes you feel like you're becoming more powerful as you venture further into the game.

CONCLUSION:

The good definitely outweigh the bad. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's done very well, has some fun combat, and the story is interesting.",1638578544,1638578544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story is both simple and cryptic, so it feels good to piece it together. All of the NPCs are hidden so finding them is rewarding, but that feeling turns anticlimactic once you realize they are just menus with no writing put into their dialogues.

So, where to start ... Chasm is a metroidvania in the Castlevania style. Lots of equipment options, inventory with recovery and utility items, backdash, et. cetra. This extends to mp being reminiscent of hearts in Castlevania installments with a Bellmont protagonist. Level design is above average, but the randomized tile placement holds it back somewhat. Enemy design is an extremely mixed bag, with plenty being ""fair"" enemies that can be defeated without taking damage with skill and observation of attacks - but many enemies being ""unfair"", either by having extremely brief delays between their tells and attacks, or charging the player - but having more hp to reasonably destroy before they make contact. A large portion of the problem with enemy design is the arsenal of weapons and abilities given to the player - all weapons are short range except the occassional whip (and a single, endgame weapon), and spells' are backloaded - requiring chunks of your precious mp (which does not regenerate on it's own), needing spell upgrades to become useful and being extremely reliant on equipment to deal adequate damage.

That said there are some issues with the game, for starters no NG+ (new game plus) now granted believe it or not if this wasn't a seeded game (Maps are randomly generated) I would say that's fine, NG+ is needed even if it's a nice bonus but the thing is most people don't want to lose all their progress to start from the beginning, this especially hurts the Blue and Gold equipment mechanic as they are extremely hard to attain in the first place which leads me to the drop rates being a bit too abysmal for a one run game, it's the kind of thing where if the game were multiple runs and you could restart on harder modes on  new seed for better levels and the like it would be fine but that just isn't the case and you could easily never come across a gold item if you just run through dood.

All in all it's a great game despite those flaws, if you play I suggest not grinding too much unless you are a trophy hunter as you will have more fun just playing the game with the drop rates, although even despite that my main suggestion is to not go for gold equipment unless you really have some free time and are desperate for that one item you super love, especially as the effects are random and no one want's to have a high INT build on a strength/ATK build character, keep that in mind and you're in for some real fun times with monsters with cool designs and attack patterns and some decently okay music dood ^-^",1636220890,1636220890,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Однажды в крепость приходит донесение, что произошло нападение дикого зверя в шахтах на рабочих в шахтерском городке Картас. Но из-за разгула бандитов в округе, в крепости почти не осталось рыцарей, которых можно было бы отправить в поселение. И в Картас отправляют новобранца. По прибытии оказывается, что в городке остался один мэр, а всех жителей похитили чудовища и утащили в шахты.

В ходе приключения нам предстоит открыть тайны древнего племени Ладори и основания королевства без короля — Гильдеи, спасти жителей и мир между делом.

Сюжет в игре подается через записки, наскальные тексты и диалоги с НПС — в основном с профессором археологии Бесденом, который приехал изучать племя Ладори.

Пробираясь через монстров, заполонивших шахты и спасая жителей деревни, мы будем получать от них простенькие задания, которые сводятся к просьбе принести ранее утерянную вещь. В награду же мы получим доступ к услугам, которые они оказывают, как например магазины или возможность создавать предметы у кузнеца. А также некоторым полезным предметам, таким как детектор секретных зон.

Кстати, секретные зоны тут спрятаны очень хорошо и практически не выделяются в окружающей местности.

Что касается ранее упомянутой системы крафта, то она очень простая. И для этого достаточно принести несколько слитков металла, добытых с монстров и в сундуках в шахты.

У персонажа есть четыре, достаточно стандартные характеристики, которые повышаются автоматически случайным образом по мере развития персонажа. Это сила, интеллект, телосложение и удача; которые в свою очередь влияют на физический и магический урон, количество маны, получаемый урон и т.д.

Боевая система также не вносит каких-либо новшеств в жанр, но и плохой от этого не становиться. Физические и магические атаки, отскок и использование зелий со свитками. 

Магия в Chasm имеет несколько нестандартную форму. Вместо огненных шаров, молний и заморозок — она представлена в виде набора метательного оружия. Нам доступны ножи, сюрикены, бумеранги, метательные топоры, коктейли Молотова и щит. А еще ее можно улучшать за драгоценные камни, что делает ее достаточно сильной, чтобы заменить ближний бой. Так что тем, кто не хочет усложнять себе прохождение брезговать ей не стоит.

Количество различной экипировки в игре маленьким не назовешь. Нам представлены различные мечи, ножи, дубинки, топоры, кастеты, кнуты. Все они отличаются уроном, скоростью, дальностью атаки и различным типами анимации ударов. В целом каждый найдет, то оружие, которое ему по душе. Но все же ощущается некоторое отсутствие разнообразия, поскольку на каждом участке прохождения у вас будет ограниченный выбор, того, что стоит использовать. А в будущем все это заменит магия.

Для дополнительного разнообразия предметы имеют несколько степеней редкости с дополнительными характеристиками. И возможность добыть такой зависит от случайности и удачи. А у некоторых имеются уникальные свойства от банальной регенерации жизней до призыва помощника, как у шляпы с перьями, призывающей попугая.

Что же касается игровых механик присущим всем метроидваниям — способности, которые дадут нам возможность попадать в ранее недоступные зоны. Их мы получаем, собирая артефакты, которых в игре целых восемь. Но, к сожалению, в большинстве они дают все те же двойные прыжки, скольжения и т.п. Выделить, пожалуй, можно только акваланг, который позволяет плавать под водой.

Используя процедурную генерацию, разработчики обычно сообщают игрокам о высокой реиграбельности их творения. Однако за этим следует и повышенное однообразие миров, созданных таким образом. И Chasm это не обошло.

Пространство между фиксированными сюжетными комнатами является сгенерированным и периодически ловишь себя на мысли, что ты уже проходил этот экран ранее, но в другом направлении. От этого временами устаешь, если есть желание облазить карту полностью, а не пробежать от босса к боссу. Сами же генерируемые экраны представлены тремя типами: платформинг, сражения и вертикальный для перехода между ярусами карты.

Для ускоренного перехода внутри зон и между ними сделан центральный хаб с телепортом. Однако только в первой зоне есть статуя Смотрителя, которая отвечает за сохранения в игре и служит в роли чекпоинта. Статуи Смотрителя встречаются и посреди локаций, но они часто расположены крайне неудобно и из-за системы быстрых переходов из хаба зоны проще всего пользоваться точкой сохранения в хабе шахт. В случае смерти, все это вместе приводит к длительным забегам из точки сохранения по безопасным экранам, что очень сильно утомляет.

С визуальной точки зрения разнообразие противников в игре действительно большое. Это и различные виды кобольдов с троллями, и простые слаймы с летучими мышами, множество типов нежити на любой вкус. А вот если посмотреть на них с точки зрения игровых механик и необходимых действий со стороны игрока, то окажется, что все они следуют заветам старых платформеров, где у противников менялся только цвет и увеличивался урон и жизни.

Конечно, местная фауна по мере продвижения по пещерам становится не только сильнее и живучей, меняя модельки. Они так же получают новые способности, например, учатся блокировать снаряды игрока; меняется траектория снарядов чудовищ. Да, действительно иногда попадаются монстры с более уникальным стилем, но в конечном итоге это не влияет кардинально на тактику игрока и подход к убийству противника. Впрочем, такое среди подобных игр встречается часто. Например, Blasphemous тоже страдает подобным механическим однообразием.

А вот боссы в Chasm выглядят уже посложнее и поинтереснее, чем в том же Blasphemous, если, конечно, закрыть глаза на магию, которая сильно упрощает их убийство.

Помимо рядовых противников и боссов, в пещерах Ладорианских гор встречаются и мини-боссы. На мой взгляд их слишком редко добавляют в игры, что является большим упущением.

Chasm звезд с неба не хватает. Игровые системы и механики были уже множество раз в других играх: двойные прыжки, скольжение, отскоки от стены. Параметры персонажа и вещей просты. И система крафта тоже. Процедурная генерация призванная повысить реиграбельность скорее навредила игре, чем сделала ее лучше.

Да и как метроидвания игра практически не работает. Большую часть времени структура карты достаточно линейна и лишь временами игроку предоставляется выбор с развилкой, который интуитивно угадывается через какое-то время, где будет тупик с сундуком или жителем, а где дорога к боссу. А возвратов в другую зоны, чтобы продолжить путь после получения новой способности и того меньше.

Но это не далает Chasm плохой игрой. Chasm — что называется крепкий середнячок. Он оказалась приятным хоть и простым платформером, хоть и тут процедурная генерация сыграла больше во вред из-за однообразности экранов.
В зависимости от стиля игры Chasm может оказаться для игрока как легкой прогулкой с незамысловатой, но занятной историей на простом уровне сложности. Так и сложным испытанием на высоком, если не злоупотреблять магией и зельями.",1635442402,1635442402,True,4,0,0.586151003837585449,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- Platforming with tight controls, I never missed a w
- The art direction : graphics + music.
- Ingame hints are very clear, no need for walkthrougs to 100% this.
- The game provides enough additional modes/content to spice up any replays.

The average:
- The story is basic, but provides just enough atmosphere.
- The swords are clearly the best weapons, you will probably only play with the other weapons if you want to challenge yourself.

The bad:
- Bossfights are very easy, because you can tank damage like a champ due to the abundance of food items (like in Bloodstained), but you can up the challenge yourself by refusing to use food items.
- The shovel mechanic, why do you need to equip this item.
- No quick respawn upon death, manual reload needed. This does not occur a lot because the game is not very hard.",1635335943,1635335943,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[/h1]

Many critics of Chasm cite the game's procedural nature as its downfall. I partially disagree. The main criticism I would leverage towards Chasm is a lack of character, primarily within its environments. It is certainly possible that the lack of character found could be a result of the game's roguelike nature, but I do not think that has to necessarily be the case. A game like Darkest Dungeon uses randomized dungeon layouts, encounters, etc., all while having incredibly memorable dungeon environments. Chasm has the impossible task of competing with environments from its predecessors, namely Castlevania. Games such as Super Castlevania and Symphony of the Night have some of the best environments, and presentations in general, of any game I've played, old or new. Chasm has subpar environments, most of them feeling like stock fantasy cliches: the abandoned mine, the crypt, the castle, etc. These environments have been used time and time again, which is fine, as they are archetypal of the genre for a reason. However, Chasm does nothing special to integrate these environments into the world it has created.

The setup for clearing out these environments is forgettable. The game's story is told through various NPC's, none of which have any charisma. Additionally, there are lore pamphlets scattered throughout each dungeon, but they do not tell a compelling narrative. I feel what was missed in Chasm's story can be summed up in one word: emotion. At no point did I feel anything for anyone found within the game. If you are the kind of person who prefers lore to dialogue, maybe there is something here for you. There was nothing here for me, and what was there was often grating.

In summary, Chasm's environments are bland and its story lacking. What this game accels at is its combat design. Classicvania games are a bit one note, in that their enemies are all dealt with in more-or-less the same manner: whip them before they reach you. There is some variety in what angle enemies approach from, but rarely do enemies deviate from simply moving towards the player. Beyond its most basic adversaries, Chasm's enemies have differing methods of attacking the player. It is not uncommon for an enemy to retreat from the player for a few steps, and then wind up for a lunge before retreating again. Some enemies advance, some enemies retreat, some enemies lunge, some enemies move steadily but quickly, etc. What is important here is that the player must utilize the game's mechanics in order to overcome these enemies efficiently. There are many instances in which if one were to swing multiple times at an enemy, one would have to utilize Chasm's backdash in order to escape retaliation. Walking backwards or jumping would not be sufficient. With other enemies, ducking is required. Others still, jumping over them. The list goes on. What is important here is that there is legitimate interaction between the player and their opponents. No one strategy beats all enemies, and the core mechanics cannot be ignored. The sad reality is that this is not often the case in the genre, as most developers do not understand how the tools they have given the player function, and therefore do not design the player's enemies around those tools. Chasm is one of the few exceptions to this trend. Not all enemies are a dps race, not all enemies can simply be jumped over. Each interaction is unique.

It is worth mentioning that Chasm is deceptively challenging. The game gifts the player enough health to cover for many of their mistakes, but mastering the game is quite difficult. One of the reasons for this is that Chasm's protagonist is at a range deficit in comparison to virtually every other metroidvania hero I'm aware of. Chasm's protagonist has very stubby limbs, and the reach of something like a knife, or even a shortsword, is extremely small. These shorter weapons, particularly the knives, daggers, and gauntlets, tend to have insane damage potential. This means that in order to be optimal, one must be incredibly precise with their spacing, lest the player run into their opponents and take damage. Chasm is a game that rewards skill, and has a fairly high skill ceiling, which is somewhat uncommon for the genre, outside of self-imposed challenges, like speedrunning. However, I would have preferred the difficulty settings change more than just health and damage. While these changes are fine, I would have liked to see easier difficulty settings make things like reacting and dodging easier for newer players, whilst also speeding up enemies on harder difficulties. Oddly enough, the former is actually possible once one has beaten the game. After completing the game, the player unlocks the ability to select a class. Doing so will grant the player various buffs and debuffs that cater to a specific playstyle. Specifically, the Warrior Class will allow the player to swing faster, which in turn means kill enemies faster and have more time to dodge attacks, as you spend less time in the swing animation. A Warrior's lack in magic is hardly missed, and I would consider the Warrior Class to be something of an ""Easy Mode."" Unfortunately, this is locked away until you have beaten the game already, making it pointless as a new-player aide. Admittedly, that was not class mode's intention, and this was merely an example of how I would have made the game easier for newer players, rather than an implication that class mode was somehow an oversight.

Even as I write this review, I am debating whether or not to recommend the title. While the combat design is great, the game as a whole is lackluster. I have only chosen to revisit the game due to its Arcade Mode, which lets you play the game as a roguelike, and compete for highscores. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a Castlevania-esque game with excellent combat. If you are the type of person who does not have any qualms with the combat in other metroidvania games, particularly in the Castlevania series, and plays these games for exploration, story, setting, etc., than I would not recommend Chasm. Luckily, there is a demo, so if you are on the fence, I would recommend checking it out.",1633839484,1633839484,True,2,0,0.51239699125289917,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Only other metroidvania I've played was Hollow Knight and I couldn't make myself finish it when it turned out I was farming for an item I didn't need at the time to progress with the game. This one however I finished and I enjoyed it for the most part even though I had some issues with it.
First of all the retro graphics are really enjoyable and the game has 6 biomes You go through when You progress through the game. Soundtrack isn't the best but has some variations depending on the biome You're on and the music for Boss fights is there.
The story is simple but there's some lore in the Journal entries that You can find across the map. The NPCs offer You 1 side quest each which reward You with some consumable items, gold or an additional option unlocking for some of the NPCs. I felt rewarded for doing the side quests which helped in progressing through the game later on. Side quests aren't a big part of the game but give You some options.
There are plenty of weapons and equipment to choose from. While the drop rates might not encourage You to farm some of the items, You'll definitely feel rewarded with some of the Boss drops if You can kill them without taking damage. The Bosses mechanics are made in a way that You can learn them and evade most of the attacks if You wish so. The thing that was lacking for me in terms of equipment and items was that the NPCs have a limited supply of items which can be used for Crafting Gear or Upgrading Spells. You can farm a lot of weapons that just doesn't feel good to play with even though their stats are much greater than Your current weapon so You sell them and buy items that would allow You to craft more suitable weapon - but the item supply is really low.
The Spells aren't really overpowered or useless - some are more useful some are less but they're always helpful in getting rid of mobs in places You cannot reach because You would have to tank damage on contact. I saw someone complaining about having to grind money to buy gems needed to upgrade the Spells. That's not the case in the current build anymore - supply of gems you can buy from NPC is so limited that you could probably upgrade only one Spell to max level. I didn't have much trouble upgrading the Spells as I got plenty of them dropped from the mobs instead.
The replayability is there for some extent but it wasn't enough for me to play the game for more time after getting 100% achievements. Still I was enjoying my second run where I got some of the rooms with the traps a little easier to pass through. I also did every Boss that had no hit challenge without taking damage to get the drop and test it out and it felt really rewarding after beating the [spoiler]Titan[/spoiler] boss and getting op weapon.
The last of the issues I had with the game was poor map navigation for me. Some of the areas that are required to pass through to progress with the game aren't marked on the map. One area that isn't needed to progress with the game but is needed to 100% the game is also not marked. I had a lot of trouble running through almost whole levels again when I got abilities that let me get to the places I couldn't get before because I couldn't find the right area. If You're playing the game for the first time just remember there is a SET MARKER option. Remember to set markers in one room levels that are needed to progress with the game so You won't have to search for them for a long time. Here are the areas if You're wondering: [spoiler] area to place the Black Feather[/spoiler], [spoiler]area to place the Black Gem[/spoiler], [spoiler]area with the Gate and a sign next to it[/spoiler], [spoiler]tower area with 4 bells[/spoiler]. Also remember that treasures, Journal entries and other stuff is marked with 1 pixel in the middle of the square on the map and that the passages are marked with a hole on the border of the areas. You should also remember that if You have a blue square on Your map without an arrow and an icon indicating which area it leads to - it's probably a place You didn't go to. Just an advice from someone who got lost more than he should've.
With all of the above being said, I've enjoyed playing this game. The story was small but fun to play through, combat felt rewarding and the equipment pool was big enough for me. Drop rates didn't really matter that much to me as I mostly used long range weapons to avoid the contact damage. Crafting needs a lot of grinding and NPCs item supply is really limited and that could feel dissapointing. Navigating the map in Your first playthrough might be hard so I hope the tips I gave You help You even if just a bit. The game is a bit unpolished with all the stuff I talked about but it's really enjoyable so give it a try.",1633789054,1633789054,True,4,0,0.540775716304779053,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Not too long of a game, seems well paced. 

Negatives (well one negative really) The one and only bad part of the game is the horrible item droprate, you can and will have to spend 2-3 levels to get both drops from some enemies. Luckscrolls seems to do nothing in regards to this issue and they are a finite resource too. Farmed for 2 levels with 80 luck much of the time thanks to all the luckscrolls. Still no itemdrop. Ended up reloading just to keep the scrolls. Used em all up again at another place with nothing to show for it. Seriously, this really bad if you want to make a complete savefile.

[b]Specs[/b]
Intel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]Yes.[/b]
[i]If you like to play metroidvanias, buy this game. Achievement hunters need to be skilled at the genre or risk grinding for drops and enemies and/or retrying the same areas several times.[/i]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
A lot of care was taken into both backgrounds and characters, allowing you to see the beautifully crafted regions. Backgrounds are made in great detail with multiple layers to give some sort of depth to them while still having a unique theme for each region. It's nice to see the variations given for the enemies too. Some enemies might be of the same type, but they are made differently to distinguish them from the other.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story is well written to give some context on what's happening. On the surface, [b]Chasm[/b] tells the story of a young knight that embarks on his first mission. Most dialogues are skippable for those who are not interested in such things, although people who want to know more can find more info in the form of journals scattered in the regions. I still didn't make out how the whole thing happened even after reading them, but at least you get the idea of what's happening before the main character comes into play.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game is played like other metroidvanias, featuring interconnected areas with some that require certain items to progress. More items will be obtained as you play, allowing you to reexplore these areas to get optional rewards. However, some of these areas are mandatory to explore, and the game never gives any indication about it. There were times when I was stuck in the game simply because I wanted to obtain as many items as I could before reexploring previous regions.

The game might be randomized on each run, but I don't find the randomization to be that appealing. They only randomized some rooms while still leaving the important rooms intact. I know that it might be difficult to randomize everything, especially since some areas are tied to progression, but I'd rather play the game without any randomization instead.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2612663786

The areas can be difficult to traverse at higher difficulties, mainly because of enemies that can damage you for 1/4 of your HP pool with a single attack. You'll end up traversing checkpoints to checkpoints later on, retrying it several times until you can clear it without dying if you are not good enough. Sadly, you are forced to load your latest save whenever you die, so the amount of time that you took to retry these areas can turn into waste. You can always try to consume potions and items to prevent dying, but since the game isn't generous in giving them nor money that can be used to buy them, you might need to grind to afford it, especially if you use it since the first few regions.

Some platforming sections can be dreadful for those who are not good at platformers. Luckily, most of them are optional and serve as a test to give you some rewards. Moreover, they tend to give non-unique items that can be easily obtained elsewhere, so there's little reason to get them if you know what the chest contains.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2612663847

Different types of weapons allow you to choose your weapon of preference. [b]Chasm[/b] offers various weapons with different attacking ranges and speeds, with a shorter range weapon having a faster speed and a broader range weapon having a lower speed. I myself got used to a one-handed sword due to its faster attacking speed and tolerable range, although it might be problematic to use for flying enemies; they might slip from my attacking range and deals a lot of damage from that.

[b]Combat[/b]
Enemies are varied and unique. This applies to all enemies, including the normal enemies. Their attacks might seem to be impossible to dodge at first, but there is always a way to defeat them, whether it's by using your weapon or magic. It's fun to learn how their attack works and how to dodge them. The game has somewhat of a difficulty spike in the third region though since there is one enemy that can't be killed without taking damage due to their way of walking.

Bosses can be tough to beat. All bosses have different and varied attack patterns that need to be dodged. Some attacks can even fill the whole screen, forcing you to dodge them just like in bullet hell games. Luckily, they can always be cheesed with potions if you have a problem with them. In fact, I even used potions on the final boss fight because the save point before the fight is very far from it.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2612663841
[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished the game in the hard difficulty in 21.8h and replayed the game again in the easy difficulty for an achievement in 6h. The game offers 4 difficulties, with hard being the third hardest and easy being the easiest difficulty. To be honest, I found the hard difficulty to be hard. I had trouble clearing the area several times and got bored playing the game because of it. It wasn't fun to retry the area several times and rely on your luck to not getting hit. You can always use potions for these, but I chose not to use them before the very last region because money are quite scarce. You might need to farm money for it, and I'm already occupied with farming enemies to level up and raise my stat already.

Enemies drop rare, unique items. You might spend a significant amount of time grinding for the same enemies over and over to get that rare drop, or even grind enemies just to fulfill a weapon's requirements to make it stronger. Moreover, the game also has some sort of level system, so you might even need to level up a few times just to be strong enough to clear the areas in a harder difficulty. Luckily, I only had a problem with this in my hard run. The game becomes more enjoyable in the easy difficulty too since I didn't have to spend time reloading my save over and over because of stupid mistakes.

[b]Problems[/b]
Dodging can take time to get used to. You didn't get an iframe for dodging and pressing the left button while dodging will move your character to the right since it always moves backward from where you are facing.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Chasm[/b] is a solid metroidvania for all kinds of people. The difficulty helps to adjust it for different kinds of people, while those who still want an extra challenge can try to beat the bosses without taking damage and get rewarded for it. Moreover, there's also a roguelike mode that can wipe your save if you die if you want to activate it.

The game can be hard at first, but it is fair. Enemies that seem to be impossible to hit with your sword can encourage you to try different weapons or magic, while others that have complicated attack patterns can be dodged if you know what you are doing. I could easily recommend this to those who like metroidvanias, especially the difficult ones.

Alguns pontos que notei até agora:

*As habilidades de exploração demoram de MAIS para serem aprendidas, a primeira habilidade por exemplo leva mais de 1 hora até você obter.

*Nesse estilo de jogo onde inimigos podem vir de cima de baixo de um lado do outro é muito importante poder direcionar o ataque, pelo menos para cima isso faz muita falta nesse jogo sendo necessario pular pra fora das plataformas pra acertar bixos que estão acima de você (o que muitas vezes acaba fazendo você tomar dano tanto do bixo ao qual esta se atacando quanto do fogo que tem abaixo da plataforma).

*O mapa [spoiler]jardins[/spoiler] é extremamente exaustivo não possuindo teleportes suficientes nem mesmo saves sendo necessario fazer areas muito grande de 'platforming' sem save nenhum (sendo necessario até retornar por essas areas grandes) o que deixa é EXTREMAMENTE frustante pois você morre e precisa fazer TUDO de novo.

*O mapa [spoiler]templo[/spoiler] é mais exaustivo ainda que o [spoiler]jardins[/spoiler] ele possui somente 1 ponto de viagem rapida NENHUM save e possui varios corredores onde não é possivel desviar dos monstros por serem muito baixos ou pelo range de ataque dos monstros ser tanto para cima quanto para os lados, o dinheiro juntado durante toda exploração até o momento provavelmente não será suficiente para comprar itens de cura necessarios para o mapa todo.

*Os preços dos itens de cura é altissimo fazendo com que nunca tenhamos chance de andar com mais de 2 poções no inventario dependendo de mais da sorte de drops para cura. (Principalmente no mapa [spoiler]Jardins[/spoiler])

[spoiler]
*O posicionamento do ultimo boss totalmente sem noção sendo atras de VARIOS monstros com ataques em padrões super dificil de desviar sem save proximo para recuperar a vida, você chega no boss já sem vida nenhuma e o BOSS tem alguns ataques com padrões que precisam de desvios praticamente pixel-perfect, ou seja você VAI tomar esses ataques todas as vezes que eles forem usados. O mapa tem um save só que aparece logo após uma luta com um semi-boss ou seja você ja gastou todos seus itens de cura nesse semi boss deixando você com um save ""quebrado"" onde ou você se torna pro-player ou você NUNCA vai zerar o jogo por ter que passar pelos mesmos corredores SEMPRE sem chance de conseguir mais itens de cura.

Without playing through multiple times, and I don't intend to, I can't comment much on a lot the game design.

If the game is composed of room-tiles, this would be a knock against it, but if it's composed to sub-room-tiles, it's fine, I guess. It feels like a lot of effort that could have gone into the procedural design would have probably been better spent on proper level design and content. The game feels a bit sparse, with a relative lack of items compared to the games it's imitating, which makes the exploration feel less rewarding. Drop rates seem really low, which is fine in an Igavania where you're given a compelling reason to backtrack and a long list of items from a large list of enemies, but less so when there's just so little to obtain. The balance always felt a bit off, not too difficult, but I guess that might just be because of the procedural generation.

Overall, a fine game to play through once if you like metroidvanias, which I do, but probably not worth it otherwise.",1630716928,1630716928,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It has good balance too.  Nothing is slanted against the player in an unfair way.  There's a little bit of grinding necessary if you want to keep high defense at all times but just a minor change would fix that issue and it only wasted about 30 minutes of my time anyways.

One solid criticism I do have for the game is the lack of in-game markers for the map.  The map is great about labeling rooms with chests you haven't gotten yet but I'd still like to be able to mark the map myself to add notes like ""need double-jump"" or ""need slide"" for later.  This is especially bad in this case because the map is randomized for every player based on a text-string seed minecraft-style, so there isn't an online map/guide you can look over.

So learning a game did exactly what I was thinking of was like a match made in heaven! Add some very lovely visuals and themes and you get what should have been a new all-time favorite... So what went wrong?

Well, technically speaking, nothing. Chasm didn't do anything particularly wrong, but it didn't do anything particularly right.

Chasm's primary concept doesn't quite work; Randomized level design is, on paper, a good idea but in practice Chasm's room design is repetitive, flat, and in no uncertain terms boring. Because of the nature of random generation, each room essentially needs to be built to fit against any other room, and this results in rooms looking, feeling, and in my playthrough literally *being* the same room. I found myself checking the map dozens of times just to make sure I didn't go down the wrong identical hallway.

Because of this level design, item progression and balance are also an issue. One of the biggest selling points in Metroidvanias is the feeling of growing stronger the more you go. To me, part of this is being able to get through rooms faster the more movement options you get, but Chasm fails in this department entirely. All the movement upgrades you get, save for the very last one, almost never resulted in room-traversing getting any faster. And because rooms can be against any other room, it's possible to get gauntlets of long corridors filled with tough enemies with little breathing room, which can result in you wondering if you're under-prepared or just unlucky. This particularly stings early on, where healing options are scarce, with only the occasional save point or random-drop-chance based healing items.

However, Chasm does have it's fair share of good to it as well. For starters, the game looks, sounds, and feels very nice! The sprite work is top-notch, the soundtrack is, admittedly a bit hit-or-miss; The themes of The Keep and The Mines being my personal favorite, and genuinely songs I go back and listen to. And the controls feel very smooth, with few times where I felt they worked against me. And while Chasm's level design is flawed, their method to fast travel was actually very well thought out; Each main area has a main hub with 4 sealed doors, and each door is located in the same area generally on the map itself, giving you an indirect method to knowing where to go; If a door is at the top of the hub, the corresponding door will likely be somewhere north on the map. These hubs also allow fast travel between the main areas of the game, and since the first area's hub houses a save area, these hubs double as healing and progress recording which is all too convenient.

Overall, my opinions on Chasm are very neutral-positive; The game doesn't do anything amazing, and it's only gimmick is it's biggest weakness, but if all you want is a decent Metroidvania that isn't one of the usual big name ones thrown around, go ahead and give Chasm a try, for as simple as it is I still enjoyed my time with it!",1630677430,1630677430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Played the game for 3 hours and the character never actually developed any abilities that were remotely interesting or fun to play.  Nearly every item drop in a treasure chest was either a duplicate armor piece or a weapon that did slightly more damage and had a range of 1 pixel.  I had to resort to using the whip weapon which did terrible damage but could actually let me have somewhat of an advantage in combat.  Platforming works most of the time but you will find yourself missing jumps because half of the platforming revolves around grabbing ledges.  You have to actively push in the direction of the ledge in order to grab it, making it incredibly easy to miss a jump.

The game appears to have some kind of mana system although I have no idea how it works or what it is used for.  I imagine that it would give some ranged abilities as your character feels incredibly underpowered with only stubby weapons that take 5 swings to kill something.

I am not a particular fan of Metroidvania games but I can appreciate the genre when it is done right.  This game meets the bare minimum for the genre and seems to take very little risk.  Slogging through the same corridors over and over again is a chore but obviously a staple of the genre as a whole.

* Merchants never restock - once you buy out their supply of warp scrolls/baked goods/gems, you're resorting to farming for the rest of the game. Given the amount of times when I was REALLY happy to have a warp scroll and the amount of gems needed to fully level up your magic? Would have been nice to be able to pick some up, even if there was just a fairly long cooldown or something.

* No saves in a late-game zone - One of the late-game zones (the Temple) is a teleporter 'maze' that has you doing a lot of backtracking; it would have been great to have some save rooms here and I'm not certain why they chose to go that direction.

* Meteoric gear - Meteor gear seems to be... pretty useless? Maybe I got lucky by finding a gold crown in the Keep, but between that and a golden hammer (made at the blacksmith way earlier than you get access to meteor ingots) I found myself not even considering going for meteor gear, which is weird because it seems to take so much more effort to farm and is ostensibly a late-game item.

* Movement - The movement is *incredibly* stiff to me; I got used to it after a while, but compared to many other games, it just feels unpleasant. I'm not opposed to stiff movement (I played Dark Souls 1 before coming back to this one), but something just feels off about the movement and end-lag and general control feeling.

Chasm is one of that Metroidvania-Games which try to look good in the store page but don´t do anything special while playing.

- The pixel-artstyle isn´t that special, but it looks pretty, aswell as the animations.

- The music (standard and the retro version) is nice, nothing impressive, but atleast they got 
  something right.


  [h1] CONS [/h1]

- Story couldn´t be less relevant in this one.

- The combat  is bland and doesn´t feel completly balanced (stiff and slow).

- Spells feel like a neet extra instead of being essential to the core combat

- Backtracking doesn´t feel fun or accomplishing.

- Everytime you die, you get kicked out into the main menu and need to start the game from 
  the last safe 
  [b] EVERY [/b] [b] DAMN [/b] [b] TIME [/b] instead just respawning quickly, like in all other 
  games from this 
  genre.

- Farming Monsterloot doesn´t feel good at all, cuz of the lack of creativity for the drops.

- The way enemies get much stronger and your equipment completly useless in every new 
   area is ridiculous. 

- Fast travel, but the positioning of it feels off due to the procedurally generated map.

- The areas don´t feel unique, neither do the enemies in their distinct area.

Graphics and music are great, the story is as interesting as it needs to be and there is a fair amount of replayability since most of the dungeons are procedurally generated and you can share seeds or keep track of your favourite ones. 

A few minor complaints are that the game is mostly too easy until quite late even on Hard, and the last significant dungeon is easily the most difficult area of the enitre  game with complex rooms and hard-hitting enemies, has NO save points at all and you really hit this point with no real expectation or warning.  Chasm also falls into the same Metroidvania progression trap of being fairly linear since you need certain abilities to progress further so your playthru will always sequentially be roughly the same even if the layout of your dungeons are different but that's more a flaw of the genre than the game itself.

Não é um bom jogo. É frustrante em mais maneiras do que eu poderia descrever com palavras. É péssimo, é horrível.

Vamos lá, um metroidvania que saiu no ano de 2018, com absolutamente NADA de inovador, competindo com grandes 'tigres' do mesmo gênero como Hollow Knight e Ori and The Blind Forest, Chasm é simplesmente dispensável, mal feito e absolutamente sem graça.

O tempo de demora de Chasm o fez envelhecer mal. O gênero precisava de um revival lá pelos anos de 2013 quando começou a ser desenvolvido (acho até que foi antes disso), mas a demora para o lançamento dele o fez ser lançado quando o gênero voltava a explodir. O resultado é um jogo muito mal feito, extremamente frustante (por diversas vezes voce não sabe o que tem que fazer e o jogo não te dá nem meia pista). Simplesmente a ideia de criar um metroidvania procedural, com mapas aleatórios é ridícula, pois como não há mapa 'padrão', até mesmo para você tentar se localizar se estiver perdido é difícil para não dizer impossível. Não são raras os tópicos nos mais diversos sites (steam, reddit, gamefaqs) tentando de alguma forma PROGREDIR no jogo. 

A dificuldade, mesmo no modo normal é INSANA, ridícula, patética! É simplesmente um negócio que não tem cabimento. A progressão da dificuldade beira o ignominioso. 

Além dos cenários serem absolutamente sem graças, insonsos e repetitivos, o jogo leva o quesito exploração à beira do insustentável, pois, como dito, não são raras vezes em que você literalmente vai ter feito tudo que podia e mesmo assim não conseguiu achar o que fazer, porque precisava EQUIPAR um item que tem uma descrição que não serve para nada e entrar numa sala aleatória numa das dungeons e encontrar um personagem aleatório igualmente.

Chasm é um metroidvania RUIM, péssimo, horrível. Eu estou com quase 90 por cento do mapa completo e prestes a enfrentar o chefe final no momento dessa análise e digo que foi uma aquisição que não valeu UM CENTAVO sequer. Se tivesse como eu pediria reembolso.

Não espere nada de inovador de Chasm. É simplesmente um metroidvania que além de ser absolutamente difícil não te recompensa em quase nada. Normalmente o gênero possui um binômio muito forte: exploração = recompensa. Isto é, quanto mais eu exploro mais eu tenho recompensa. Porém Chasm te faz explorar a esmo.

The game isnt bad, but incredibly forgettable. After finishing it, all I could say was ""Eh. It was a game.""
I would say that the best thing about it is the art, but even that is bland and just good enough.

It calls itself a ""roguelite"", but that is mostly a lie, as most of the game doesnt changes, only a few rooms between key areas. The exception is the Arcade mode, where it is an actual roguelite.

The game feels a bit hard, but you quickly notice that the biggest chunk of the difficulty comes from one place: the main character.
Aside being the most generic main character I have ever seen, he is basically worthless. All I can guess is that they wanted him to die or there wasnt anyone else available at the moment.
He is slow. And I mean SLOW. He runs slowly, he attacks slowly, he cant backstep during attacks and has a huge hitbox.
Before you find the double jump near the end of the game, he is one of the most non-agile character I've ever played as.

This game takes a lot from other metroidvanias, so a lot of stuff isnt original.
The main character has the ""motion blur"" effect as he moves (even though he runs at a slug pace) and has that fancy slash attack like Alucard's.

You can equip magic spells that are the sub-weapons, but leveling and recharging your MP is all based on luck.
Unlike other Castlevanias, candles only have a chance of dropping MP, and leveling spells are based on random gem drops.

Most of the weapons in the game are also terribly unbalanced. If you dont pick a normal sword, whip or spear, your attacks wont have enough reach. 
Knives are so short that you need to be hugging the enemies to hit them, since the character swings them so close to them. And due his big hitbox, that also means you always take damage.
Maces, axes and broadswords do the overhead swing, but they are even slower, dont do that much extra damage and leaves you open for more attacks, as you cant dodge until the attack animation finishes. By the time you did one swing, you could do three with a normal sword.

Metroidvania with the right amount of heart and soul to make for a fun little romp. The music & pixel graphics while may not be master class is worth the price tag that comes with it. 

Graphics 8/10
Pixel graphics, while maybe not as animated and detailed as in some other games of this genre, the overall job and presentation is still great. Every area feels fresh and fun with little details sprinkled within. The characters/monsters all feel distinct and made for there levels. It's not going to win any awards for being the best pixel graphics, but they get the job done with charm and love. 

Sound/Music: 6/10
The sound effects are adequate for what each thing it's trying to portray while the there is no spoken dialogue in the game. The music however is ok. After a few hours of playing there's quite a few little songs that become kinda catchy and each biome has it's own theme. The jungle one stands out as one that gives me flash backs I swear to ""Wild Arms"" a JRPG for the psx. 

Story: 6.5/10
You're a would be knight sent out to a small town to help after a attack from some monsters. When you arrive everyone missing. As time goes on you uncover a ancient evil and save the town. It's you're generic fantasy story, but done in just a way that brings it some charm and life. There's notes scattered about that add some lore and townspeople will give you small tidbits here and there. Don't expect deep elements though.

Gameplay: 8/10
A metroidvania with some classic throwbacks. This has a decent set of balance to it, I never felt cheated when I died. Knowing anything done was my mistake and could easily overcome it with time and skill. The boss fights were all fun and had tele-marks to learn. The exploration was the highlight with so many secrets and hidden things to find. Each new item and area felt and flowed well. This is just a really well put together game.

アクションが苦手だけど、素朴な感じの正解とプレイ。
アクションは数えるほどしかクリアしたことないけど頑張ればクリアできる難易度
ジャンプの感覚や操作性は、壁ジャンプを除けば良好。
アクション好きにおすすめできる内容かどうかはわからないけど、懐かしい感じのアクションと謎解きが詰まったゲーム。
英語が読めなかったのでストーリーはいまいち理解していません。

◯良い点
操作が簡単
敵の動きにも個性があって、面倒だけど対策を考えながら戦うと上手になるのが実感できる。
セーブや回復ポイントがそれなりにあるのと、拠点までワープ出来るのでやる気が持続
敵が専用の装備をドロップする！

◯駄目な所
敵を倒してもお金がなかなかドロップしないため必要最低限の買い物しか利用しなかった。
新しいアイテムを手に入れて移動範囲が広がるのは楽しいが、クリア済みのエリアなど忘れてしまい何度も往復することに。
敵との戦闘は楽しいがマップはあまり楽しくない。やや単調。
武器のモーションや攻撃範囲に癖があって使いにくい。結局槍を愛用。

中盤まではかなり楽しめたが、終盤になって難しくなり回復ポットを買い込みながらゴリ押しでラストまで駆け抜けた。
上手い人は終盤をどうやって乗り切るのが教えてほしい。
回復ポットの金策は、リングを落とすスライムをひたすら乱獲。

It has all the workings of a Metroidvania, but it's missing the mark in quite a few ways.

The ledge grab mechanic is infuriating. For some reason, you have to be falling to grab the ledge and you have to be positioned at a precise pixel to grab it. This makes for frequent misses. Additionally, it rarely doesn't grab it even when you are way above it and hold against the wall the entire time. You end up just falling down past it and in some rooms that is a long fall and a lot of wasted time. If you attack in the air, you also are unable to grab a ledge for quite some time. There's lots of places where you need to do this though, which makes for a poor experience.

There's a bunch of weapons in the game, but so many are unusable. Anything other than spear or sword is either too short range or too slow. Enemies can deal damage to you by just walking into you and the short range weapons don't produce enough knockback to prevent you from being hit during your attack animation. The slow attack speed weapons don't do enough damage to justify the slow attack speed. You can get multiple attacks off with a sword in the time it takes to make one hammer swing and the multiple sword attacks will do more overall damage.

There are rooms that let you go to other areas of the map via shortcuts. This is messy. If you want to go to a specific area of map 3 and you are in map 1, then you have to use the central teleporter, pick map 3, then figure out which door you need to go through to get to the area you want to be. In other Metroidvanias, you would just enter a teleporter and select on the map where you want to go. It's far more efficient and far more intuitive. The first maps version of this room has a save point in it, however none of the others have one. This leads to going through the central teleporter to the first maps room to use the save point and then going back through the central teleporter to the map you were on. If you were going to put a save point in one of these rooms and they are all connected, why not just place one in every one of these rooms to save time?

The bosses in this game are terrible. The mechanics are clunky and the fights end up devolving into attack through the damage and heal up when low health until the boss is dead.

There is a shovel and digging mechanic, but for some reason it's placed in the weapons menu and you have to go into the menu, equip it, dig, go back into the menu, equip your weapon, and then continue on. Why? Make it an artifact that just works when you are over a diggable spot. Press down and attack or something...

Apparently, the layout of the maps are random based on the seed. This explains why I would often find identical rooms and would get confused if I looped around to the same area. I even had some areas that were multiple rooms of the same layout as another spot in the map. It also explains why some rooms have pointless traversal mechanics in them, like a ledge grab spot right next to a pit of acid with no purpose...",1627869163,1627869163,False,7,0,0.539900600910186768,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Chasm m'a tenu en haleine du début à la fin.

Vu les avis relativement mitigés, je m'attendais à pire. Mais le jeu est consistant dans sa réalisation. Son contenu est riche et varié.

Les ennemis et les équipements sont renouvelés tout le long du jeu.

Il souffre de quelques défauts déjà évoqués dans d'autres reviews.

Mais pour en reprendre quelques uns. Dont mes premières impressions.

Le côté dur est pallié par le farming.

L'aspect redondant est souligné par le farming et le level design. Mais le jeu n'est pas assez long pour que ce soit un critère trop gênant.

L'aspect rigide du gameplay est plutôt bien géré par l'éventail d'équipement. Reste que même certaine partie de plateforme pas toujours évidente. Mais cela reste assez minoritaire.

Et il y a une partie du jeu qui ne semble pas abouti. Mais pareil, ce n'est pas super gênant. Genre des potions ou des capacités qui servent surtout à un seul endroit.

Le jeu le plus proche est sans doute Hollow Knight. Mais sur quasiment tous les points de comparaison, on trouvera Hollow Knight bien mieux.

It lacks something that I can't quite put my finger on and That is a quality good game. If you look into the history of this game you will find it is what makes it. It tries to to be everything that everyone wanted. metroidvania, yup: it has square level rooms, so square it puts every castlevania to shame, floating lantern, why not add these easy drops when BG level torches are thing, clunky movement scheme, I played them all, well most of the CV's and hardly ever used dash when it wasn't forward propelled. I always found it easier to Jump back as I could attack while doing so. The same is in this game. The controls are clunky just like these older games, because why not improve it, that's the way they were and so shall we. And the last piece that everyone wants procedural generation. Why not create levels and play test them to get a balance to them, just PG them and that creativity can be used for the lanterns. with the RPG elements it feels really unbalanced in one area I was ripping through enemies with the environmental hazards dealing more damage. and then the next section was so OP I took 4x damage, enemy health was 4x, but exp was 4x so I could have grinded there for a bit if it wasn't also the shortest area up in a position with no save shrines. 

Coming from recent ""metroidvania"" games or shall I say non-linear platformers of the likes of Ori and Blasphemous this game is very shallow. The art is good in places while other aspects are cluttered or noisey. The animations are all straight from the 16-bit era, The run is very castlevania, well actually most of the movement, the glide is Aladdin, There is even a blatant ripoff of a Shambler. I don't think there was much in the way of a metroid game other than the square map system, which is really the only thing that ties any castlevania to metroid to form this ""genre"". Maybe I should stop complaining and go play a good old fashioned doom clone like Battlefield or Thief, or Sniper Ghost Warrior.

I didn't managed to finish it, and not because it's hard, but because I don't find a reason to keep playing this game. Everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING in this game doesn't seem original, and this makes it bad and repetitive, and here's a bunch of things wich I think that makes the game look like this:

-Annoying enemies spawns that are almost impossible to pass through. For example: a zombie that spawns on the edge of a plataform with lasers under it (sure, you can use the ""spells"" to kill it, but then another almost indentical spot apears right after this one).

-The ""spells"" are almost useless, the only spell that are at least usable is the knife, wich btw, you need to spam 6 or 8 times to kill an enemy on a safe distance. Also, they don't make the player feel that he's using actual spells, just makes the player feel he's using weaker versions of Castlevania's SOTN subweapons.

-Most ocasions, you can't actually fight the enemies, you need to find a safe spot to start spaming a ""spell"" to kill him, and if you don't have enough mana, then you need to start dodging the enemy's attacks until you find a oportunity to hit him, then you repeat the process until the enemy is dead. By reading what I said, you must be thinking that I don't like the ""hit & dodge"" combat, but I really like it, when it's well implemented, because Chasm doesn't give any usefull mobility to your character at all.

-Like I said previously, apparently the developers wanted to implement the ""hit & dodge"" combat style to the game, and they did it, but they forgot the fact that you need to give actual mobility to the player instead of a backdash that is slower than your character running back, and you can't cancel your attack by doing other action, like jumping, if you attack, you'll be stuck into an animation that only ends when your character stop swinging his weapon, during that period, the enemy that you're attacking probably is going to hit you back.

Chasm really disapointed me, I watched some playthrougs and I bought it, thinking it was going to be a great game, but no, it's just another game awfully trying to pass the same vibe of Castlevania SOTN.

They introduced novelty in procedural generation of the levels, you get a lot of ""seeds"" from which you can tell the layout is completely different, however, as I played one playthrough, I already see that some rooms are repeating within the same seed, basically since metroidvanias require some careful design to not be stuck, and they went the extra mile to make the stuff like needed pickups and saves in places where it's not frustrating, as well as guaranteed loopbacks to some preplaced rooms, it's clear that the room for experimentation is not huge, and it's probably reaaaally hard to pump a lot of rooms into the machine.

Soooo, those variations are a nice touch if you want to replay the game on harder difficulties, but it's clearly not something to replay a fkton like roguelikes/roguelites. The combat is basically castlevania, some people complain about annoying controls, in my experience they're ok, with one exception - turning around mid jump, some bats can mess you up big time because you swing the opposite way from them. Also some wall jumps can be a little nuisance if the wall is at the max height of your jump. Weapons vary a bit, but the slow ones have barely any additional damage, so I used the most dps heavy sword I found at that time, swift sword being used for like half of the run. The magic is rather weird, usually it's not super useful, unless you're changing the spells all the time in inventory, to suit the situation, that is less of a problem once you upgrade them though. You upgrade it through armor and accessories, then later through gems. Definitely way less straightforward compared to melee builds.
You also have stats and levels, I think you usually get more levels from enemies you recently discovered. The enemies also have droprates, affected by your luck stat, so if you're going for 100% or specific items, you can do a big chunk of farming. I'm not sure there is anything else in terms of mechanics that I would describe, that makes this game stand out from the crowd. Maybe special drops from bosses if you no hit them? Though personally I never bothered.

The music is composed well, I had a pleasant time listening to it when playing, they're not huge bangers, but if I heard it from outside the game, I think it would be recognizable enough to say it's from Chasm. Sounds are appropriate for the pixely game, so in terms of quality - bad. Not annoying to listen to of course, but absolutely not something to write home about.

The visuals as mentioned before - pixelated, 16 bit like, the animations are pretty easy to read, and the environments are recognizable. Some stuff you interact with, which might not be clear from its looks, usually has a glint to catch your attention. They're executed in a pretty damn competent way, however I am so deaaaad and tired of the pixel art games. Some might have more charm than others, but I am craving detail and effort in my games. You don't have to make everything pixelated to convey it's an indie game for indie audience, I'm not that single minded.

Story is there, it's not bad actuallly, nothing insulting about it's delivery or particularly stupid elements, though it is nothing special at the same time, a demonic ruler sitting at the bottom of hellish magma filled caves at the bottom, and some other ancient places, all connected through a mine at the top, where villagers lived, before being abducted down to those depths. Predictable, standard, but far from awful.

So the game is at around 70% recommended on steam, I think that's fair, if you enjoy metroidvania games, you're gonna have a fun time, like me, but if you're considering some top shelf games from the genre, it's not near stuff like hollow knight, minoria or blasphemous. Those last 3 are a must play in my book, in comparison I might forget I actually played this one day.",1623512416,1623512416,True,3,0,0.488029986619949341,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Sinceramente parece un producto hecho con esfuerzo, pero sin cariño como si los desarrolladores estuvieran obligados a hacerlo y simplemente no le pusieron corazón, he notado que muchos metroidvanias carecen de ambición y se limitan a hacer un juego ""largo"", funcional, y que cumpla con los elementos clasicos: como salas secretas, sistema de nivel y muchos items (consumibles y armas), y al final producen un juego muy cuadrado, como si su única referencia fuera el castlevania sotn y no pudieran atreverse a si quiera intentar algo más, en los noventas y la primera decada del 2000 entiendo que esos proyectos tuvieran limitaciones entre otras cosas por las plataformas en que se lanzaban esos juegos, pero hasta konami supo ver que podia hacer más. Trabajos como este simplemente son anacronicos y solo desgastan el genero. ¿quieres un metroidvania que si vale pena? prueba iconoclast, blasphemous, o hasta midnight castle succubus; ninguno de esos juegos es perfecto y pecan de algunos problemas que he señalado en esta crítica, pero son mejores propuestas que este juego, literalmente pienso que solo disfrutaras de chasm si tienes poca o nada de experiencia jugando metroidvanias o si no eres nada exigente.",1622512189,1622532097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The weapons actually attack in different ways, but offer no alternative. A bat attacking from above you will mean a lot of issues if you have a sword. Clubs are slow but least they attack in a wide arc. But all of this matters little because the level ""design"" and enemies make it unenjoyable.
You see, you basically don't have knockback, it's ridiculously low. Yet as you progress, enemies get enough health to land a hit or two, slowly wearing you down, because the level ""design"" is so random that it often leaves no place to actually fighting back. Like if there is a zombie in a tunnel coming to you, and attacking with a dash, you can only hope to kill it faster because you can't go back up, nor dodge to the other side of the enemy.
It's really clear that the developer's pride, the procedural generation doesn't really work. Rooms started repeating as soon as level 2 and 3.  One room had a secret crevice with a mana boost that was also repeated - this is the level of rooms being re-used.
That's just the extra that the game started out by having the steamcommunity popups being mostly out of my screen. And when I tried to fix, the game claimed it is running at my native resolution, while having thick black bars around the screen.

The game tries to be Castlevania so hard that it physically hurts.

游戏本身还是一款致敬月下的银河战士恶魔城类游戏（恶魔城玩家狂喜），玩过之后，你会发现主角的动作还有武器攻击方式都是以里希特为原型（蒂德莉特那个是以A少为原型），部分武器甚至还有搓招系统。没有经历过那个时代恶魔城的玩家可能不太适应这个主武器的攻击节奏以及跳A的手感，跳跃也分为大跳和小跳（恶魔城玩家看到这里似乎又发现了什么），空中跳A过后落地的一瞬间可以取消攻击前摇马上发动一次攻击。遗憾的是后撤不能强制取消平A，导致后撤的使用频率偏低，这个有点遗憾，也不知道制作组还能不能改进。
剧情方面：寻找矿坑里怪物出现的原因，顺便解救NPC。
地图部分，分为城镇（NPC所在）+5张野外地图（带传送点）+最终迷宫（其实就一条路）。
难度方面，开局有3个难度可选（通关当前最高困难难度之后，会出现噩梦难度——保存点无法回血，以及凡人难度——相当于硬核难度，即人物死亡后无法读取当前存档）。凡人难度可与其他难度同时选择。如果是全成就玩家，至少需要2周目——一周目通关困难难度；二周目开放可选职业，选择凡人难度+任意难度（为避免在凡人难度下死亡后无法继续游戏，可关闭平台云存储功能并手动备份存档）。
作为一名恶魔城老猎人，觉得这个由两个人制作的游戏还是挺赞的，特别是还能在这个游戏里看到曾经月下的影子更是让人格外怀念那个刷魂刷装备的夏天！

The bad:
Controls are slow and unresponsive
Levels are badly generated
Items do not drop when they are useful anymore
Last boss has stupid save point
Little to no story
Dumb beast achievement

The good:
Graphics style is great
80's to 90's like game play
Requires very little hardware

So this requires the player to journey to small mining town investigate the townspeople disappearance and why this towns mines are filled with monsters. That is it that is the story in fill because you can already fill in the blanks. The monsters are here to destroy the world and you need to defeat the grand monster behind it. So having little to no story is the first problem as there is no real side missions beyond one. No but this is the reason just insert evil monster and you get the idea.

All of this would not be a problem as many other games could be summed up as such but its core game play is basically designed to be a retro like game. So it suffers from this, you will hit a key on the keyboard for no action to be taken, when jumping, fighting basically anything. This is deliberate apparently the original game it is trying to mimic did this, so as such you need to time everything to the pace that this game wants you to play at.

When talking about level generation for a open world game like minecraft, terraria etc. random generated maps are great. They let the played explore a map that is different, they allow for a fresh gameplay experience every time. They allow the player to create there experience etc. you get the idea. Now with a linear game i.e. one that is meant to be played from start to finish once and then shelved this is horrible. Just looking up a guide on the web i can tell you that my map to at least 30% smaller when filled in. It has bugs like one part of the map required you to submerse your character in lava to fill in the map blank. The maps look bland because its all just copy and paste. This map would of been 100% better if the developers had taken the time to create a map. They could of placed the save points at better locations, made monsters at better spots, made items that are hidden in more inventive locations etc. etc.

As for the items drop this really not well designed, some of the items are locked behind the requirement to defeat the games bosses without getting hit. This can be done for most players with a few hours of practice to get bosses attack moves memorized then develop a technique to fight them and finally maybe get a little lucky. But there is little to no reason beyond these weapons to do this and all it does is just make this game longer. besides the strongest weapon in the game is not unlocked this way.
Then you get to the minerals drop, which is once again not done very well at all. The best metal in the game is not dropped and thus cannot be used until you are almost one or two rooms away from the final boss and besides the metal at this late stage of the game crafts items that are worse then the ones you properly already have.

The final boss is located from the final save point after about half a section of map. So you are simply forced to get to him wait around for you character to heal before taking him on every single time. This means that assuming that you need to heal with the healing amour on its going to take you about 20 mins every time. Because of this you strategy will probably just end up being buy shit loads of potions and use then every time you health gets low. Which for a boss that has as many attacks as the last one has is a real disappointment. Unfortunately it also leaves you with very little to think hey i just completed this game and that last boss was hard but fair. Good game.

Finally the game forces you to kill every single monster like 15 times over even if its not encountered very offen. Once again this could of been fixed with non generated map.

The GOOD:

You will probably get alot of fun out of this title if you played the original game this is inspired by. I personally have not and as such DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING OR PLAYING THIS GAME.

Semi-gameplay spoilers from now on:

People say the random map generation holds the game back, I agree, if that was tightened up a little this game would be a powerhouse but as it stands there are some instances of being too far away from fast travel, a puzzle being too far away from it solution, an npc being locked at the end of a long gauntlet or a checkpoint being a bit far away from the boss. None of those map issues were significant but they were still present. Combat is good but some enemy attack patterns are tough, although if I had taken more time to learn then I'd probably be more lenient. I liked a lot of the npc interactions and I thought (most of) their quests were fun. Backtracking at the end of the game was amazingly smooth (with a tiny bit of help from the wiki). The map is comprehensive enough to tell where nearly everything is and even tickles your expectations at one or two points.

I enjoyed my time with Chasm: the combat is fine, the enemies and bosses have a nice variety, populating the town is rewarding and exploring the map was fun and not that much frustrating.

However, there's very little I will remember fondly. On the whole, the game just feels bland: the story is basically non-existent, there are no particularly interesting gameplay mechanics, enemies end up being annoying more than challenging and the world building is just mediocre. Many reviewers noted many design problems with the game, but the biggest problem is that the game is just forgettable.

This also makes its main selling point, the replayability, simply not worth it: there's very little to gain by doing a new run. By being a game made of two parts, a metroidvania and a randomly generated game, it feels like the developers' efforts were split too much, making both aspects just mediocre.

Os desenvolvedores se limitaram a copiar SoN, conseguiram arrecadar quase 200 mil dólares no kickstarter, tiveram uns 6 anos de desenvolvimento (resultando em 4 anos de atraso), diversas promessas não cumpridas e conseguiram fracassar na única coisa que se limitaram a fazer.

With polished controls, solid game design choices, and a great look and sountrack, [i]Chasm[/i] presents a fun little Metroidvania that presents a variety of well-executed ideas that fans of the genre should find well worth the $20 asking price.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
[i]Chasm[/i] comes to the table with a fusion of action platforming, adventure puzzles, and RPG mechanics that blend together seamlessly. Your hero will level up as you progress, and levels come pretty naturally; you're unlikely to need to grind as the challenge is pretty balanced for a natural playthrough. For the most part these levels are just a numbers game, and the weapons and armor feel similar, although there are a few varieties of weapon that do change things up a bit. The village offers stores and roads to improved items and abilities as well.
Like any good Metroidvania, you'll find roadblocks that will be overcome using items you acquire as you explore. The map has a welcome (I even say necessary) marker feature that lets you mark important spots on the map; make sure you mark  roadblocks and other unusual rooms so it's easier to remember where they are later! Puzzle rooms also offer welcome diversions from the combat in most other areas.
The movement and combat controls feel snappy and polished, though your options are fairly limited; I would have liked to see more advanced options like attack cancelling, parrying, or other such concepts, as I found many combat encounters either to be a swing-and-jump affair, or just trading blows. You'll also acquire ""spells"", many of which you'll recognize from Castlevania games, which give you alternative ways to approach combat.

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
The art direction of this game is top-notch modern pixel work; this game doesn't seek to emulate classic consoles, instead fully utilizing modern capabilities (although there is a welcome CRT mode in the graphics option; I always prefer a well-emulated CRT for pixel games). Character designs are interesting, animations are fluid, environments are detailed and varied, and the user interface is bespoke and clean.

[h3]Audio[/h3]
The soundtrack in this game slaps, and I appreciate that there is an alternate 8-bit retro-style soundtrack option if you like more blippy tunes to accompany the visual style. Both versions are excellent. The sound effects aren't standout, but they are punchy and clean and contribute to the game's polish.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story is this game's weakest element--which isn't to say it's [i]bad[/i], just [i]minimal[/i]. A small chunk of setup explains that you're delving into some mines to clear out enemies and rescue missing townsfolk, and while you're down there you learn what's at the heart of the problem so you can solve it. The character interactions are pleasant, but none of the interactions are particularly deep. Overall, little bits of fun lore but not something you'll likely get invested in.

[h3]Additional Thoughts[/h3]
I took a break from this game for a while and when I came back, I couldn't remember what I had done and what I was still working on in terms of the little side-quests for the villagers; a quest log or notes system would have helped in that regard. Also, while the map markers were definitely welcome, I'm always in favor of multiple marker options--different colors or symbols--to help distinguish why any given area is important. I like being able to say ""this is a small passage roadblock"" vs. ""this is a high jump roadblock"" to help me remember where a new item will help me and minimize unnecessary backtracking.",1618120377,1618120377,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

雖然不是「惡魔城：月下夜想曲」系列的五十嵐孝司監製的，玩起來還是有純正的IGA-VANIA的味道，和目前市面上已成主流的挑戰受死難度Metroidvania類型乍看很像，但其實不一樣，就算對動作遊戲不是很在行的玩家也能樂在其中。

玩家扮演一個軍隊中的無名小卒，受命到一個名為Karthas的偏遠礦鎮訪查，除了初始的軍營和城鎮外，可供探索解謎的區域共有六大關。關卡中的怪物配置、村民、謎題和機關類型都是固定的，但地形會因為種子碼而配置不同，導致每位玩家除非用同一組種子碼，否則玩到的地圖不會一樣。

遊戲中包含BOSS和mini-boss，共有87種怪物，有怪物圖鑑可蒐集，但要達到特定的條件才能解鎖 (怪物圖鑑No.68 WolfBeast可能因為攻略路線的BUG導致無法解開，請注意)。

除了BOSS外，遊戲中大部分遇到的怪物可以透過反覆進入房間讓它們重生，藉此反覆去刷掉落物品，這是箇中醍醐味；而關卡BOSS如果無傷擊敗的話，也能得到具有特殊能力的武器，讓通關更順利。

遊戲在一般難度單純跑圖通關的話，應該10小時左右可以完成，故事主線沒有跌宕出奇之處，拯救村民後的各有其支線展開，達成後都有特殊獎勵，對通關很有幫助，千萬別錯過。

有一個100%搜刮寶箱的成就，但寶箱設置和獎勵常常讓人感覺和努力不成正比，淪為只是為了妨礙100%搜刮寶箱和100%探索地圖的難度，建議不用在初期太努力去拿，因為有些跳躍點和機關很吃重反應時機，等全部八種Artifacts入手後，跳躍的容錯性較高，再回那些地方應可輕鬆完成。

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2440765041

主角的武器選擇很多，但有必殺技的五根手指數得出來；裝備防具不會影響外觀，只有單純的數值變化；另外還有兩頂帽子能召喚可升級的使魔，以及只能召喚一個弓箭手幫忙打怪的捲軸。主角攻擊方式除了前面所提的極少數武器有必殺技，以及跟惡魔城系列一樣可升級的副武器系統，還有因為某項Artifact衍生的滑鏟踢外，沒有任何其他你幻想會有的攻擊手段，包括兩段跳時對敵人的踩踏或飛踢都不會有。

故事模式有普通、困難和不朽(永久死亡)更高的難度可供挑戰(對應這兩個難度也有成就)，此外還有街機分數挑戰模式及好友排行榜，提供了一點聊勝於無的耐玩性。

整體而言，遊戲開發團隊明顯企圖心不夠，畢竟五十嵐孝司從「惡魔城：月下夜想曲」以來，可是有8款IGAVANIA風格的動作RPG可供致敬參考；但製作團隊透過眾籌成功募得目標資金後，只把創意放在「因應種子碼而隨機創造的世界」這點，其它能讓內容更豐富的可能性都沒做到，難怪評價最終落得差強人意。",1617672154,1617672574,True,25,0,0.719358682632446289,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Chasm ist ein Platformer mit Rollenspiel-Aspekten. Man wird als Aushilfs-Ritter nach Kharthas geschickt, um die Umstände in der dortigen Mine zu untersuchen. Man macht sich dann erstmal mit den Bewohnern der Stadt vertraut, um zu wissen, was Phase ist. Nachdem man ein paar Quests bekommen hat, geht man in die randomisierte Mine. Was dort lauert, das findet ihr am besten selbst raus.

Grafisch finden wir hier hübsche und durchdachte Pixel-Grafik. Jedes Biom steht für sich und hat den eigenen Style und auch das eigene Gegnerdesign. Die Animationen sind auch passend. Soundtechnisch gibt es keine Sprachausgabe, allerdings dafür Soundeffekte, bei denen man sich zu Hause fühlt und Musik, die nicht nervig wird und auch jedes Mal zum Thema passt.

Da die Map sich bei jedem Playthrough neu generiert hat dieses Spiel einen gewissen Wiederspielwert. Die Rollenspiel-Aspekte machen es zudem interessant. Welche Waffe passt zu einem? Welche Werte sind wichtig? Alles Fragen, die man sich im Laufe des Spiels stellt und wo man sicher viel erkunden kann. Dazu kommt eine simple Steuerung, die allerdings viel Timing abverlangt.

Alles in Allem ist das Spiel also genau das, was es sein will. Es gibt kaum Punkte, die ich negativ aufführen würde.

The Linux port ran perfectly.

Chasm might be one of the most underrated games on Steam. At release time, it got plenty of negative feedback because players had some issues with the game design, people claimed it was bland and that the idea of a randomly generated metroidvania is not as interesting as one with a well predesigned map. But the game has been polished and developed since, and as 2021 this a solid game, one of the fewer metroidvanias that fit the Igavania subgenre, the ones that carry RPG elements with levels and gear. 

The pixel art in this game is absolutely amazing. Sound and music are great, nothing is annoying or out of place. Gameplay is tight, controls are precise and there are a lot of jumping and backdashing. When you first start the game, a seed is generated and the game map will be randomized, although there is a specific order of biomes you will go through and secrets that will only slightly change (such as codes). There is a lot of backtracking that made the game fun to me, since every time I was getting upgrades to explore that hard to reach places, but not all people are too fond of that. Game length was nice, I felt it could be a bit shorter though.

I agree that the randomization is not that useful because most people won't play it twice (I doubt I will) but it was a good and unique idea and props to the devs for the courage to try something like that. Also, the puzzles were not very straightforward and I had to read the forums for help. I also managed to finish the game before I completed some optional puzzles and I doubt I will go back to them now. The gear variety could be better designed as I found very few items I wanted to use, but the game allows you to pick different builds (basically pick between melee and magic even though you will still use both).

Overall, I recommend this game for those looking for more Igavanias to play  and this one has unique controls and graphics, if it is on sale it is well worth it. The reviews are not too favorable but it has nothing to do with bad quality. This could be a 90% if it was released without randomization, a nice map design and all the current improvements, 95% if the puzzles were redone in a more straightforward way.

**PROS**
- Amazing graphics
- Great music and effects
- Igavania style levels and equipment
- Enough game length
- Secrets
- Fun backtracking
- Tight controls
- Fast action
- Normal difficulty done right

**CONS**
- Randomization is probably not useful to most people and made the game less interesting 
- Puzzles were sometimes not straightforward or a bit cryptic, tips might be required
- Gear variety can feel bland unless you want to force yourself different builds for subsequent playthroughs

Infatti nonostante ogni partita sia diversa grazie a un sistema di creazione del mondo procedurale, Chasm sembra quasi guidarti nell'apprendimento del gioco, dandoti i mezzi e le informazioni per proseguire verso la meta grazie al gameplay.
Gameplay ed estetica sono un enorme omaggio ai suoi titoli di ispirazione, fluidità e controlli ben calibrati invece incorniciano il tutto impreziosendo lo stile 16bit che lo caratterizza.

L'avventura ci porterà ad attraversare sei diversi dungeon, tutti realizzati da ambienti e nemici diversi e man mano che avanziamo nel gioco sbloccheremo diverse abilità che ci permetteranno di superare zone altrimenti inaccessibili.

Ho apprezzato davvero tanto che le varie difficoltà riescano a creare un livello di sfida adatto a qualsiasi fascia di giocatori, dando del filo da torcere ai più temerari ma accompagnando istruendo il giocatore per chi invece vuole approcciarsi al genere.
La varietà di ambientazioni, equipaggiamento e nemici ci costringe ad adattare il nostro stile di gioco in base a ciò che ci troveremo ad affrontare e seppur ci sia una forte presenza di backtracking, la mappa riesce a non essere dispersiva e con il vecchio metodo di carta e penna alla mano si riesce facilmente a districarsi fra le varie stanze.

Consigliatissimo a chi si approccia per la prima volta al genere metroidvania, 16€ non sono tanti e li vale fino all'ultimo centesimo.

- Difficoltà adatte a tutti i giocatori
- Stile tecnico e gameplay ben realizzato.

It is amazing that this game gets ""mostly positive"" in Steam, yet it is very very weak compared to better Metroidvania style games around here. Doesn't even worth to install this poorly made game. I wish they cared about the mechanics as much as the visuals.
Storytelling is weak, and heavily depended on the books we collect around. They didn't even care to implement storytelling to the dialogues or the level design.
They used a RPG style level up system inside the Metroidvania style. However combat with mobs are just plain boring.
When you hit a monster, the attack doesn't affect it and it continues to walk towards you, and due to delay after your attack, you can't run away from their attacks and take damage for unavoidable reasons. You get movement delays after you attack, yet monsters don't get any delay or stun after getting damaged. This system is plain stupid. Check out Hollow Knight for better combat mechanics.
And just to salt the wound, they removed any ""combat animations"" from the monsters. Monsters simply walk around, and damage you whenever they touch you (even from behind).
Waste of time, waste of money.

Siento que sería la consola ideal para echarle horas acostado en la cama

No he jugado muchos MetroidVania`s como para tener una clara referencia de calidad, pero si he jugado muchísimos títulos en general y siento que lo podían haber hecho mucho mejor.

He leído que el juego estuvo en desarrollo alrededor de 5 años. Lo juegué sin saber previamente nada de este, solo viendo ScreenShoots de la tienda y la portada, a lo clásico. 


Tiene muy buen arranque, te enseñan un hermoso Pixel Art, como carta de presentación; se muestran (BitKid®) que son un estudio capaz de hacer unos escenarios bestiales y luego te meten en una mina un par de horas y estás todo el rato deseando poder salir al aire libre.
Para que luego descubras que todo el juego gira alrededor de esa mina que conecta con otros 4 mapas y ya está.

A partir de las 3Hrs de juego en adelante, el juego pierde muchísimo todo el encanto que mostraba, volviéndose repetitivo y sin innovar nada realmente.
Pero poco a poco vas comprendiendo la visión de los desarrolladores con este juego y comienzas a ver todo lo bueno que ofrece.

Llevo varios días enganchado a esto, soñando con píxeles (no es c0ña) y rompiendo esa barrera que he tenido siempre de querer jugar algo antiguo; que hoy por hoy se ve ""fatal"", 
este juego me ha dado el impulso para dar un paso hacia atrás y darle la oportunidad a títulos como Megaman Zero y Castlevania: juegazos sin completar de mi infancia.

""Estoy trabajando en una guía de como enfrentarte a cada enemigo sin ser golpeado y algunos consejos sin spoilers, le pus3 ganas a este juego no voy a mentir, me ha gustado.""

Os inimigos poderiam ter um combate mais elaborado, a maioria deles se resume a 'dê dois hits, volte um pouco pra trás, espere ele atacar e repita', tanto que quando eu fui chegando no endgame, eu só ignorei os inimigos e fui indo direto pros bosses.

Nice characters and art style
Cool exploration and levels
Good enough story
Buy it on a sale[/b]

you know the drill. a guy goes on a mission to check on a mine - the usual stuff you do when you're not a soldier yet - and then you have to save the world from an era of darkness. it's a little similar to games like shovel knight (there is a hub town), with all the usual Castlevania tropes (locked places, power-ups to reach them, bats, save points), but it's pretty well executed. Every level has its style, and the story is entertaining enough to keep you playing. Once you get the double jump it's way easier to explore, but not spoon-fed, so it's great. I'll give it a 9/10 (maybe because I've been playing metroidvanias too much... )

I am sure my review will echo others there, but first we'll start with the good:

Pros:
- Beautiful pixel art that I genuinely enjoyed.

- A fine if rather generic storyline, but I appreciate and actually like the way the game progressed and how you bit by bit restore the village.

- Unlike others I like the world design overall, while not perfect I thought it worked.

Cons:
- The controls are just a mess; a hallmark of a great Metroidvania game are the snappy, responsive controls, and the controls here are just sluggish (and its not the game that is sluggish; plenty of enemies have the kind of snappy/quick movement you would expect, but your controls just can't keep up).  I consistently felt like you could never quite jump high enough, far enough, or fast enough, and after nearly every action the character takes a pause, which usually results in taking damage.  Therefore one is constantly faced with the option of dodge endlessly or hit the enemy and take damage.  This would not be a problem if there were plentiful save points or item drops to help restore HP, which there are some, but not enough.  As others have commented, the wall-jumping mechanic is also a mess.  I see how it works and think I understand what the devs were trying to go for, but it just feels terrible, which to me is the antithesis of a good metroidvania.

- As others have commented, there are just not enough save points.  Given the sluggish controls, the game can be kind of brutal, and I found it easy to be stuck in a situation where I had little HP, no food or potions left, and miles away from a save point.  As others have commented, the item drop rate is low (and while that does not bother me in terms of weapons, if the game is going to be designed as it is, it should really have more HP item drops).

Overall I can only recommend this to the most committed of metroidvania fans.  If you want to like this game but looking for a better alternative, I would recommend Timespinner.",1612033949,1612033949,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Jump around clunky retro pixel  environments brawling with lazy retro pixel enemies. 

Clunky is the theme here... the controls are a godawful mess.   It's obvious this isn't designed for PC.   You do get some ""decent"" (for a crappy retro pixel bundle filler) graphics settings, so there's working 4K support and even UI scaling.   It's inexplicable why so much work went into making a game that looks so bad, on purpose.  Retro pixel graphics are a terrible substitute for modern PC graphics, and are only used by developers who lack either talent, or budget, to arrange contemporary, compelling visuals.   However, despite giving up on trying to make the game look decent and using pixel ""art"" instead, they still put a huge amount of work into it.  What do they say?  You can't polish a turd, but you can roll it in glitter. 

So, ugly retro pixel graphics, godawfully bad controls (and controls are what make or break crappy 2D retro pixel platformers),  there's no entertainment value in this.

It's definitely entertaining that they thought this was worth the same price as AAA games like Divinity: Original Sin 2 or Monster Hunter: World.   Sheer comedy.

Not in a roguelike way - rather, the exact layout of your game is generated at the outset when you start a new save file.

Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it. I haven't played enough Castlevania or Metroid games to really know how it stands against them, but I do know I had fun, the artwork is well done, and the overall vibes are great. My primary complaints surround map design and why procedurally generated content isn't always the greatest design choice. On a positive note, the devs included a cheat system which I am always, always get excited to see - even if it disables achievements.

-

The first key feature as listed in Chasm's description states, ""Explore six massive procedurally-assembled areas from hand-crafted rooms"". The problem with using this mechanic is due to the delicate nature of the order, pacing, and progression of rooms in the Metroidvania genre. The lack of intention results in really inappropriate layouts, strangely placed rooms, and oddly absent save locations. A fully customized - or to use their term, a fully ""hand-crafted"" experience would have been better. I think the flow of things would have benefited from it greatly. At times it almost felt worth it to start a new game to see if the randomized design is any more palatable. I doubt it, but I can dream of greener grasses. 

Enemy variety and designs are excellent and really make the game stand out. There are 80 different enemies, all of whom seemed to have very unique attack and movement patterns. It really kept the challenges going. Unfortunately, for me, my patience is pretty shallow for particularly difficult games (looking at you Dark Souls), and I tend to prefer something more approachable and accomplishable. Luckily, the developers added cheat commands that can be entered into the console at the cost of having your achievements disabled - which seemed more than fair.

A lot of pixel games fall short of what I would call quality graphics, but Chasm has this charming appeal that really looks nice. It's pleasing to the eye. I dig it and I think it shows that a lot of time and effort was put into this aspect of the game.

I typically shy away from the Metroidvania genre and I've been getting burned out on roguelikes, but this one hit the right spots for me. I can see why this game has some complaints - especially given how long people who funded the game had to wait. I received the game in a Humble Bundle a few years ago and am happy it was included. Looking at the retail price - I'd personally wait for it to hit its seasonal sale and low-price of $7.99.

I did my initial playthrough on hard and got my ass kicked frequently. Income wasn't very reliable and consumables were expensive. But that all added to the satisfaction of playing well in a long trek towards a save point or in a boss fight. The controls feel reliable and accurate which is vital in a tough game like this. I was impressed with how tangible my improvement was. When finding a new enemy I would pretty much always be in danger of dying but after a few encounters I could reliably kill them without getting hit.

The presentation is where this game shines. The music feels very nostalgic and has a nice variety in tone that's fitting for the different levels. The art is also gorgeous. The enemies and bosses have very detailed spites and are instantly recognizable. But especially the animation is top notch which is important for reliably reading attack patterns. I liked flicking through the bestiary to see the big baddies that I'd overcome. Unfortunately there's no flavor text for the enemies and the story is pretty forgettable too.  

There's a lot of different genre elements thrown in here. A bit of RPG, a bit of procedural generation and some random loot drops but those don't enhance the experience. I think this game would've been better if the devs held more control over the power curve and level design. It happened quite frequently that I would backtrack to open a chest and get something useless while I would get a great drop from a random enemy. It's nothing gamebreaking but it just feels bad. 

Then there is the navigation issues. While the map is functional, it doesn't show why a path is blocked and you can't place useful markers so you'll be completely reliant on memory when backtracking. It's also hard to read. For the 100% map achievement I spent ages staring at the map to find the last area to explore. Then there is the stupid travel system where you'll waste a ton of time going into the wrong door or having to go to the single save point. And while I think the enemy design is good you'll encounter really unfair situation. Enemies might be edge-guarding forcing you to reload an area or tank hits. And playing optimally means simply jumping over everything and not interacting at all, 

With all that said, I 100% it and had a decent time while playing so it gets a small recommendation. But with so many excellent Metroidvanias on steam it's on the bottom end of the list.",1607512756,1607512756,True,8,0,0.605653882026672363,0,False,False,False,False,,,

但是汉化版本没更新，后续的很多内容没有。

我去年做过一部分汉化，但是因为字库原因，所以最后是搁置了。

上周看到贴吧有老哥更新了PSV的新版本，所以我就拿着试了。

确实改观了不少，一些明显的排版问题都有了修复。

不过还是有不少问题，但是至少有新版本的字库了。

所以借助前人的努力，得以完成这次的汉化。

同时还要感谢，帮我排除了很多问题。

不含坛友测试，我这次总共花费时长应该是在40小时左右。

致谢列表：
游侠汉化组，为游戏主文本，食品，成就，界面做出了最基本的翻译。定义了整体基调。
imjinjia，对游戏主文本进行了一些修正翻译，还有重新排版，使整体可读性提高。
Murphy，万狐飞仙及其他进行测试的坛友，多亏了坛友，这次汉化的排错进度很快。
特别是Murphy坛友，这次汉化中的怪物名称和他探讨了不少，怪物名称有他一份工。

那么，写了这么多，该说下我做了什么（仅含有争议部分）：
1.虽然imjianjia做了不少工作，但是排版，翻译方面还有问题的。
经过坛友反馈，及我的修正，重新排版了不少内容，并一些对语句进行了修改，重翻等。
2.界面在游侠基础上，重新进行了修改，增补等。
4.对食品进行重新翻译，修正及排版。
5.对成就的描述及关键词进行了重新翻译。
6.物品翻译部分借鉴了imjianjia的，其余的是我做的。
7.怪物翻译，
筋肉人->灵感来自Murphy的肉人，原本我是叫的屠夫。
山怪->原文是Troll，受惯性思维，我以为是巨魔，所以改叫哥布林，但是坛友帮我纠正了这个问题。
鬼工->昨天晚上提到的，原本我们是叫鬼矿工的，但是发现貌似不是那样，先前想当然了。
爬虫->原本是叫刺兽，因为我一直以为是刺猬，但是其原词Crawler组合Internet其实是网络爬虫的意思，因此叫做爬虫。
行走植物->原本我是叫步行植物，但是Murphy指明这个可能不太贴切，想了想，确实是的。
血生怪->其实是叫血衍怪的，但是差字，所以退而求其次了。
猩怪->原本是音译，但是后来发现用外形比较贴切。
活化盔甲->原本是活体，但是和坛友讨论后，发现了我的疏忽，活体更像是其有肉，但是实际上是没有的。
不死矛兵->原文是Lancer，我因为汉化过老滚的MOD，所以一直用枪骑翻译，但实际用的多的是长枪，也是坛友提醒我才发现。所以最后定的是矛，因为字库无枪这个字。
女巫->原本我是翻译巫师，因为游戏Witcher简中翻译是巫师，在长时间熏陶下，我就把Witch当做了巫师，但其实这个是女巫的专有词，得亏坛友提醒了我。
格纳洛克斯->多亏坛友提醒，我反应过来这个在主文本其实有翻译。

 - Ridiculous ""Die and it's Game Over, sorry you didn't save"" mechanic

 - Ridiculously overpriced shop items that take a ridiculous amount of time to farm gold to purchase

2D 사이드뷰 픽셀그래픽 메트로베니아 RPG 게임.
몬스터가 우글거리는 광산에 붙잡힌 마을 주민들을 구출해내는 기사의 이야기를 다룬다.

보통 난이도로 플레이 했는데, 초반에는 상당히 불만족스러웠다.
첫 번째는 조작 때문이다.
조작이 자유롭지가 못하다. 공격을 하면 아주 잠깐 동안 멈추는데, 이 때 움직일 수가 없다.
적들에게 쳐맞기 좋은 타이밍이 된다.
백스텝하는 키도 있는데, 뒤로 너무 멀리 가서 공격하려면 다시 앞으로 와야 되고.
조작이 짜증나면 맞으면서도 불합리하다고 느낀다.

두 번째로, 저장이 힘들다.
조작이 어려우니 난이도도 어려운데, 죽으면 저장한 데서 시작한다.
메트로베니아 게임이니만큼 저장하는 위치가 따로 있다. 근데 이게 굉장히 드물다.
죽으면 저 멀리서 처음부터 다시 시작해야 하는 것이 빡친다.
화남 스택이 많이 쌓여서 죽으면 그냥 꺼버리게 된다.

진짜 열받게 만드는 것도 가지가지 한다.
그래도 메트로베니아 게임은 웬만하면 재미없지 않으므로...
그냥 내가 게임을 못해서 그런가 보다 생각하면, 그리 나쁜 게임은 아니다.
빡침을 견뎌내고 계속 하다보면 레벨업도 하고 좋은 무기도 끼면서 게임에 익숙해진다. 
그러면 할만 하다.

플레이 타임은 11시간 반 정도.
많이 다운그레이드된 '할로우 나이트'로 보면 될 것 같다.
재밌기는 하지만, 초~중반에 불만족스러운 부분이 꽤 있었기에 그다지 추천하지는 않겠다.

진행도: 보통 난이도로 엔딩 봄.
주민 모두 구출함. 보물 상자 모두 안 모음. 
주민들의 퀘스트는 다 안 깸.

Today I saw I have it in my library and thought it's about time to give it a try. 
Well, after an hour I tried my first time to refund a game and had to learn the hard way, that Steam policy for refunding games is that you have to ask for refund no more than two weeks after purchase. Lesson learned.
And about the game? In You could look at the trailer, pictures and think ""Well it looks decent for it's price"". But you quickly see where all the problems lie. First of all the jumping feels weird. There's like a milisecond delay after you do a big jump, which messes up your rythm. The same thing happens with combat. When you think you found the right pace when to hit enemies and when to retreat it just brings you down like nothing and you're left highly enraged. I tried to finish one part of the so uninspiring cave level for maybe 10 times and there's one goblin guy just keeps throwing rocks nonstop at you and you can't reach him. After I got to him, I fell down in to poison pit and died. It's not hard to be hard, it's hard to be annoying. 
The background doesn't have any paralax or movement, so levels look dull. And they're pretty long for not having anything much to do in them. Enemies respawn immediately when you go to next screen, so don't expect to back track to save point if you're short on lifes. 
The first two new weapons that I got was knife and club, but they don't do much, because you still have to hit enemy two times to kill it (or three times and so). It says ""grind"" all over it.
In conclusion, if you see it for 5€ or less, I would say it's fair. Not more. Although prepare to be frustrated for most parts of it. Or better just skip it.",1605124838,1605124838,False,1,0,0.466101676225662231,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A fun retro 16-bit sprites looking Metroidvania RPG-lite game with I think some crafting in there also. (haven't gotten that far yet)
Playing on kids' laptop with my XBONE wireless controller on Normal mode.
The story is decent and doesn't get in the way with long drawn out cutscenes. This means you get into the action fast unlike some games. The drops from enemies are a bit weird. I killed plenty of spear goblins getting gold drops until I got 2 bandana drops in a row.

It plays [i]exactly[/i] like Koji Igarashi's Castlevania games ([b]Symphony of the Night[/b] onwards), the main character in particular controls just like Jonathan Morris from [b]Portrait of Ruin[/b]. You have main weapons such as whips, swords, greatswords, daggers, spears, fist weapons etc on one button and sub-weapons such as knife, axe, boomerang (cross), molotov (holy water), shield (bible) etc on the other button. Sub-weapons are curiously called spells but there are no actual spells in the game, just the renamed Castlevania sub-weapons. And then you have the backdash, slide, double jump etc, again just like in Castlevania.

The story is pretty basic, you arrive at a small mining town and are asked to investigate the mines because there's a monster infestation problem. The village is empty at first but you save NPC's on your journey and they provide various services and give out quests (just like in [b]Order of Ecclesia[/b]). Now, the game is quite short and took me only a little under 9 hours to 100%. There only are 6 areas/tilesets and 7 bosses. The bulk of the playtime was spent backtracking and farming enemies because the drop rates are very low (e.g. I looked up online where to get a better whip and it took 150 kills for the enemy to finally drop it, at Luck 45), not to mention the fact that the game requires you to kill an enemy up to 15 times to unlock its bestiary entry and some of the enemies appear only a few times during the game, so again you're just forced to farm if you want the 100% bestiary.

Apart from that, the main issue with the game is its rogue-like elements. Again, just like with many recent indies procedural generation is used here as a crutch. What makes it worse, levels aren't re-rolled when you die, the seed is permanent per playthrough, so unless you bother replaying this (which is unlikely) the RNG aspect is only a detriment because a lot of the levels are just the same copypasted rooms and hallways in weird combinations. The key items and story progression are all the same but the filler between them is randomly generated per your playthrough. Basically, you get all the downsides of playing a rogue-like game with none of the positives.

And then there's a number of really meanspirited design decisions. The fast travel system is extremely unwieldy. Warp points warp you to a warp room and every area has its own, and you can also teleport between the warp rooms. Late game you have 4 warp rooms and simply going back to town requires walking through a long series of portals, as only the first warp room is connected to town. Same goes for saving your game, only the first warp room has a save point so if you want to save you need to warp to your current warp room, then choose the first warp room from the list, teleport to it, save your game and then do it all in reverse. Town scrolls are very expensive and the number is limited (!) per playthrough. They really wanted you to waste your time walking back and forth for no reason whatsoever.

The pixel art is above average and definitely the highlight of the game, everything is decently animated and looks sharp, although the human faces with their googly eyes look a bit weird. The music, on the other hand, is disappointing, the tracks are basically 10 second loops and both HD and chiptune versions sound mostly awful, with only a few exceptions.

Overall, unless you get it in a bundle (like I did) it's not really worth more than $5 unless you're a massive fan of metroidvanias and must play each Castlevania clone there is.

I don't know if it's my seed but there is incredible inconsistancy on difficulty which is ultimately determined by distance between save points as they also restore your health. They have different weapons and magic attacks but mainly because of slugish controls and punishingly long animations by your own character it seems you just pick your longest range weapon and cheapest magic attack and stick with that. The metroidvania type upgrades have been sorely lacking, in my 6 some hours of play the only ""new moves"" i've gotten is a slide, edge hang, and light which means when you're doing the massive amount of backtracking you don't have any standard new move relief to make it enjoyable or faster. Many enemies are extremely annoying and the level design make it all but impossible to avoid taking damage in certain spots. The platforming is just ok but the controls move tip it to the more unenjoyable side.

Gear should be must better and there should be more to get. The worst part is the random gen, which is whats supposed to set this apart but is the dumbest idea for a metroidvania. Many people use guides and wikis with games like these because theres so much backtracking and how easy it is to get lost, but the random gen ruins a lot of that because you can't look a lot up. Also because of the randomness i didn't get a lot of crafting mats and armor pieces that i saw on a walkthrough etc. But since the story and bosses and areas are the same and all thats different is the level layout theres really no reason to play this a second time because its not different enough, so it is bad in most ways and useless in the intended way.

Graphics - A 
Pure 32-bit beauty, just like nature intended, even has the CRT scan-lines if you so choose.
Sound - A
I actually preferred the midi/chip-bit sounds over the other version, the fact it lets you choose is a bonus.
Map - C.  
Hear me out, I know this may seem harsh, but here is my take on it.  I spent most of my time backtracking to/from simply blindly navigating through the map looking for the next big press onward.  Save points are not given in a couple areas which makes for some painful traveling in the later portion of the game.  I feel that is cheap designing to force the player to play the game more to earn more gold (which does not exactly come easy) to buy more HP recovery items just to venture around or get that Beastiary log to 100%.
Monsters - A Minus
Typical fanfare we have all come to know and love, each monster has a pattern of sorts, you simply need to figure it out.  The most damage caused to me was when I either got impatient and tried to steam roll them or get that last hit in before they started their attack, that is completely on me.  Each boss, (well I am unsure if the final one does) gives a special item should you beat them without getting hit.  Sounds great, right?  Wait until you 15th, 20th, or 30th time trying to do just that because one errant touch where you literally could not escape negates the ability to get the prize.  Thankfully the developers put a save point very close to each boss (minus the last two), still though, that walk of shame grinds hard on the soul.
Equipment (weapons, armor, accessories) - A Minus.
Items created per the differences of play weapons preferences to a point (one hand versus two hand weapons), the order in which you received some of the weapons however was oddly paced.  Sometimes you may receive a weapon which outclasses many others based upon your play style either too late in game, which I could understand because you don't want to hand a medieval knight a machine gun in a bad sense.  Then there is one weapon which requires you to go through some tedious hoops to get (thank you community for helping out others with this by the way), but once you equip it, it really is not that awesome.  I do wish there was an explanation of what colors meant however.  Bad case in point, you have three types of the same weapon, armor, or trinket; regular (no border), good (blue border/aura around the item's icon), and great (yellow border/aura around the item's icon).  What I did not like was the differences in them.  Too many times I received an item in good or great format that I already had, only to find out one was better than the other by a point or two.  
Gameplay/Movement - B Minus.  Here me out again, I do certainly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Metroidvania's.  I would preface this however that they had better prepare for some serious grinding through sometimes meaningless backtracking because the game literally tells you little if anything of merit.  Later on in the game you will get an ability to wall-jump, another staple Metroidvania skill I welcomed greatly.  The collisions on some those wall grabs was dodgy at times as was another ability which would let you float.  Quite a few times I found myself getting hurt or having to completely redo a room (which vary in size) because a button press which should have worked simply did not.  There are a couple puzzles that honestly had a great community not been reporting and sharing their wealth of information, would have left so many of us in the dark unable to move forward.
Achievements - B.  Nice achievements, though I am glad there was not one for ""Collect all weapons,"" or something similar as while you can boost your luck, and even with some interesting tweaking I was over 44 luck but it still feels like World of Warcraft RNG at times.  However, I was not getting credit for some of those achievements I had clearly did to include rescuing everyone, doing their tasks, and completing the map.  While I received help from the developer in regards to getting credit for rescuing them, I still do not have credit for completing their side quests or getting 100% map completion.
Ending - B.  I received what the community calls the ""better ending,"" because I did X sub-tasks in the story.  Cool, but even after having done all that in addition to 100% map completion, my medal was only bronze.  I can only assume it must be a calculation of time.  
Overall:  A Minus, would still recommend for anyone a fan of the genre.

而遊戲中時不時出現需要跳躍才能踏立的平台，偶爾會有怪物看見你，便自動守在平台邊緣處，你跳過去就會被打下來。理論上來說，以前我玩的動作遊戲，怪不會一直守在平台邊緣，而是待角色離開怪的視線範圍後，牠會往平台的另一個邊緣處移動，這時我們會馬上跳上平台，並快速移動到怪的背後攻擊。我猜遊戲中的怪似乎有無條件追縱功能，導致一些立足點較小的平台，還有一堆飛行怪靠近，根本很難閃躲。這為你的通關帶來了難度上的提升，卻並不具備挑戰性，反而令人覺得反感。

武器的種類很少，也沒有特殊必殺技，而副武器的使用率其實也不高，從頭到尾甚至能一把劍搞定。另外有一些裝備可以召喚鳥和劍，比方說bird hat，裝備後會有一隻鳥跟著你，並且隨著鳥的升級攻擊力也會增強。但是呢……升級條件卻非常惱人。原因是除非敵人死亡前的最後一擊是鳥去攻擊擊死的，否則無法升級。

等於說，你先殺了敵人，那麼該經驗值歸你，而鳥先殺了敵人，則經驗值歸牠，你們不能供享經驗值。所以為了讓bird hat升級，你還得計算敵人的血量，好讓鳥能給予最後一擊。但問題是鳥的攻擊還有冷卻時間，所以在最後一擊前，你還得等待，然後閃躲敵人的攻擊。

我並不覺得這有什麼挑戰性，只覺得這種設定讓人感到很煩。使得原本應該流暢的動作遊戲，變得生硬、無趣，磨時間。玩到後面會讓人覺得很悶，而不是因為充滿挑戰感到開心，或是享受自由戰鬥靈活動作的快意。而且遊戲封面角色是有裝備盾的，但實際上沒有盾可以裝備。

至於劇情方面，似乎也沒有什麼劇情，減少了吸引你進續向前的動力。從頭到尾就是幾張地圖一直重覆往返。

所以我不推薦這款遊戲，這款只能算中下評。我不曉得它日後是否會改版。

但現階段來說，不推薦。

這款遊戲有潛力，卻沒有完全發揮，導致像是半成品。",1601738884,1602158048,False,3,0,0.546313822269439697,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Its definitely a fun little metrodvania platformer. Its easy to recommend for fans of the genre. Especially if you want a lighter experience.  

The story is a tad dry and don't get me wrong its not the best in class but its good. Better then good in many ways. Its got a nice retro feel. Like NES Zelda: 2 turned up to 11.  Theres a nice mix of fairly straight forward exploring and backtracking for secrets. Theres loads of secrets big and small. Theres some cool items, clever elements, and fun surprises. It really achieves alot and was an ambitious project. The game has some replayability and extra challenges if you want to add them. 

It is a tad light and found it pretty easy on the normal difficulty. You could plow through it in a day or two if you rushed. I took about 9 hours but backtracked whenever I could, got 100% explored, and made sure not to miss much of anything. 

I also found the art, sounds, and music enjoyable. Not sure how some are ripping on these elements. Its not hiding its style.

One reviewer said the game got old but I found the end games stages the best. 

Overall I had a great time. I'd love to see it get a sound pass but I doubt that will happen. Some quality of life improvements to save you time would be nice. Maybe some new areas, items, characters. A magic overhaul could be great too. Maybe for Chasm 2 fingers crossed.

Cons:

I was pretty disappointed the characters appearance didn't change the whole game. I like to customize and feel like I'm growing. Tho you do get a little of that from the different weapons. I wanted more. Would been so cool to see the equipment change your appearance.

It get a tad tedious at times. The back tracking. short cuts, and save locations, can be annoying or feel unnecessary. Back tracking through the early stages is not threatening at all.  It could have been a little more dynamic. Like maybe some new enemies populate at certain points. One thing desperately missing and an easy fix would be to be able to save at any portal. Instead you got go in the portal, switch area, then walk over there, then save, then back track to the portal... All extra steps for nothing really. You are just clicking and switching screens for nothing. Also, I wish I knew the map had a marking system sooner. Mark those chests and areas you can't get too it will save you loads of time. 

Mild spoiler, there are invisible walls. They are kinda annoying tho because most of them have boring rewards. Theres also no indication they exist. I found my first one by complete accident. Which made my ocd kick in overdrive. Now I had to check every wall and they were are pretty rare. Only a couple times did it feel worth it and rewarding. More interesting stuff coulda been done with this for sure. 

The magic system is kinda lack luster. Well it does have a retro nes feel but thats kinda dated. They dont really explain it much either. So you gotta buy and try your spells to know how they work. Id really recommend looking them up online before buying any. You'll only want one or two. The magic could be more dynamic for sure. This is one thing I think could really be reworked to add alot to the game. Have some more progression and flavor. Maybe add some secret spells and interactions with items and monsters. 

I should add I only did one play through on normal. I wanna try it on hard or hardcore with the classes add on.",1601608925,1601608925,True,14,0,0.655959665775299072,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Al comprar algo a un mercader, poder ver la cantidad que ya tienes en el inventario.
- Poder cambiar el arma principal sin tener que acceder al menú (con el arma secundaria/mágica sí lo permite).
- Acceso rápido a objetos (pociones, comida, pergaminos...) así como limitar la cantidad máxima de éstos para incrementar la dificultad.
- Simplificar el equipamiento (existen una burrada de items, la mayoría inservibles).
- Poder elegir clase desde el principio.
- Falta un NG+

Por destacar:
- Historia muy simple, pero no necesita más.
- La OST a mi me ha encantado, es simple y un poco repetitiva, pero a su vez es agradable.
- Gran variedad de enemigos.
- El hecho de poder encontrar items con mejor Tier de los enemigos o los cofres (por mi parte he farmeado bastante para conseguir mejor equipamiento en modo Difícil).
- Las mazmorras no se hacen pesadas y hay suficientes salidas/conexiones.
- La dificultad es correcta (en modo difícil he tenido que repetir varias zonas por confiarme)

The combat is fun (if a little easy), with bosses and enemies all having nice patterns that can be read and exploited while still allowing for different playstyles. 

Beating the game once will unlock class mode, which lets you play with new fun classes, and the warrior. This is where the real fun starts. 
The rogue is a glass cannon that moves faster (to the point that it's hard to go back to other characters afterwards, by the by), gets a bonus to knives, has a backstab ability that also works on magic attacks, and has a massive luck stat that lets him make up for his weak damage by getting all the good loot with super powerful bonuses on all of them by late game, plus rolling in money because you'll have more stuff than you want to bother selling by the time you hit the end boss. 
The mage is a lot of fun, though trickier to play. He has a bit more health, casts spells at a discount, and favors a more strategic hit and run tactics. If you're farming achievements then the mage is your best bet for the 'Kill a boss without taking a hit' achievo. Side note: Whips work really well for the mage, since your damage is terrible so reach is really important. Also really useful for breaking lights, which can drop mana orbs and taking out trash mobs in the early areas when you're backtracking.
The warrior...exists. He has a lot of health, swings two handed weapons a smidge faster than everyone else, gets more base damage, and has virtually no luck so he gets very few monster drops, meaning that you're basically never going to get any of the fun toys or good enchantments. I can't imagine actually playing through the game with this character, but the other two are really good.

Unfortunately, after the second or third play through the game starts to wear a bit thin (though at about 10 hours a pop it holds up really well for the price). The random levels aren't random enough and the random rooms can be recycled multiple times in the same play through. There's a chance you'll get cool hidden areas with good loot, but there's a chance you won't and the 'good loot' isn't guaranteed even if you do. And the game also lacks a New Game+ mode, which means all of the really cool late game gear that you go through a lot of hoops to find and savescum good drops of will be in your hands for about 5 minutes before the end boss. 

Still, tldr: I had a blast playing this through three times to 100% it. Casual players will get about 10 fun hours out of it, so if you like the genre then I'd highly recommend it. It can feel a little light on content after you play through it enough, but the first time through feels great.",1600199469,1600199469,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Pour commencer, c'est encore un jeu qui mérite (selon moi, évidemment) un bouton avis partagé car il y a des plus et il y a des moins qui font de ce jeu, un jeu moyen.

Pour situer le gameplay, cela ressemble à Hollow Knight car il n'y a pas de combo d'attaque. C'est un coup et c'est tout. Certains aiment, d'autres non. Pour moi ce n'est qu'une mécanique de gameplay qui est moyenne car cela dépend essentiellement de comment le jeu est agencé à côté, esquive, sort (s'il y en a), etc.

Donc pour les bons points,

Les graphismes sont beaux, y a rien à dire c'est beau. C'est du pixel art mais c'est joli. (Après si vous n'aimez pas le pixel art pourquoi tu t'emmerdes à lire ?)
La diversité des armes et des sorts est sympa, elle permet à chacun de trouver son style de jeu.
Une assez large éventail d'ennemis aux parterns différents, c'est toujours sympa de varier les plaisirs.
Le manque d'indications concernant les point de sauvegarde est dommageable car il pourra vous arriver de mourir après avoir exploré une grosse partie de la carte juste parce que vous avez continué tout droit au lieu de monter dans la salle de sauvegarde.

Pour les points bof,

La musique, elle a beau être sympa après 3h de jeu, j'avais mal à la tête.
L'esquive, on a vu mieux. Elle n'est pas inutile mais souvent trop courte ou trop longue.
Les paterns d'attaque de votre personnage. Et oui, malheureusement, la variété d'arme amène aussi un problème qui devient vite apparent, certaines armes sont équivalentes à un suicide. Les armes qui n'ont aucune portée ne sont quasiment pas utilisable en jeu puisque vous ne pourrez soit pas vous approcher suffisamment pour attaquer soit vous ne pourrez pas esquiver.
Le système de porte pour ce balader dans un niveau sans se taper tout le niveau est bien mais il en manque quelques unes à mon goût.
Il y a des salles cachés mais il n'y a aucun indice pour les trouver, la plupart on tombe dessus par hasard en essayant de se rattraper lors d'une chute ou en grimpant.
Le changement de difficulté est presque inutile car seul les points de vie des ennemis changent, du moins c'est la seule chose que j'ai remarqué. Donc puisque l'on prend toujours la même quantité de dégât et au vue des défauts du jeu, la difficulté facile n'apparaît même pas comme plus simple juste moins longue.

Enfin, pour les mauvais points du jeu,

C'est étonnamment long pour un jeu si court. Je n'ai pas fini le jeu et je n'ai pas 25h sur le jeu pourtant, ces 5h m'ont paru longue et chiante à en crever, là où Hollow Knight compense avec une bonne B.O. et des paysages qui changent régulièrement ici beaucoup de salle sont réutilisés ce qui donne vite la sensation de ne pas avancer. Combinez à cela, les aller-retours à faire entre 2 ou 3 zones après le déblocage d'une compétence et c'est vite lassantet le respawn intensif des monstres qui ajoute encore un peu à la recette car à chaque changement de sale l'équipe technique est remise à neuf et quand votre but est uniquement de passer à travers une zone c'est vite chiant même quand il ne faut qu'un seul coup pour tuer un monstre.
L'argent peut aussi devenir un problème car avec les problèmes d'esquive et les attaques parfois inesquivables des monstres votre vie aura une fâcheuse tendance à descendre et à descendre vite. Or, les potions et la nourriture ne sont pas un drop courant, il faudra généralement les acheter au village lorsque les personnages pouvant vous proposer potion ou nourriture auront été libéré. Sinon vous devez faire des passages aux points de sauvegarde éparse pour regagner votre vie et avec ce qui a été dit au dessus c'est parfois difficile.
Certaines attaques sont inesquivable, je l'ai déjà dit mais je le redis certains monstres ne peuvent pas être esquiver et pour d'autre, il faudra vous préparez à un long combat car vous ne mettrez pas souvent de coup et ce sont parfois des sacs à point de vie.

En conclusion, ce jeu est un mixe entre un jeu de plateformes et un RPG et c'est pas dingue. Ce n'est pas mauvais mais des défauts viennent alourdir le gameplay et la progression du joueur. Si c'était un jeu de plateforme, il serait très bon mais en tant que RPG, c'est pas fou. On va juste de droite à gauche ou de haut en bas en tapant sur tout ce qu'on croise et les seules notions de RPG viennent des niveaux que l'ont peu gagner en tuant suffisamment de monstres et de l'inventaire et c'est tout.

Edit : Non, ce n'est pas pour dire que le jeu est bien, mais pour rajouter un détail, le level designer est une ordure. Le nombre de phase de plateforme que tu dois te taper avec des monstres aériens ou terrestres qui sont juste bien placé pour que si t'essaie d'aller un peu vite tu te le manges et tu redescend tout en bas de la salle ou bien tu ne peux juste pas monter, au mieux sans prendre de dégât au pire tu te faite enchaîner en boucle jusqu'à ce que l'IA décide qu'elle en a marre de te pourrir. Comment on peut rendre un jeu avec un tel potentiel aussi frustrant ? Y a rien qui va, le wall jump est à vomir, les phases de plateformes serait assez simple s'il n'y avait pas toujours un détail frustrant mis de façon ostentatoire histoire de te rappeler que t'es pas là pour t'amuser !  Et pour ceux qui ont mis une recommandation avec seulement 1h de jeu aller bien vous faire mettre parce que le jeu vous y avez pas joué. Entre le level designer sadique, l'inflation concernant les objets de survie (potions et nourriture) et la pauvreté des drops je vous jure que le jeu vous y avez pas joué d'ailleurs rien que quand j'ai vu le pourcentage de joueur qui ont tué le 2é boss j'ai compris.",1599329989,1600115851,False,0,0,0.469234079122543335,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Game looks nice on outside, but everything about is pretty much terrible.[/h1]

Steam has a lot of good platformers available, and this is not one of them.

There is so many flaws that it is hard to imagine that someone would release such game without noticing.

This is a good example of how you should NOT make a platformer.

[h1]A short list of SOME of problems of the game:[/h1]

1. Clumsy controls. Any time you want to do some action, you cannot do it swiftly. You either need to press some awkward combination of keys, or you just can't.
i.e. if you run and want to slide while you run, you need to  sit down and stop first, only then press a slide button to slide. Almost any action is clumsy and just pain.

2. Terrible main attack. It is just disgusting. First of all - there is no combos, just 1 plain attack. And it has a HUGE recovery time. So you do your attack and then stand still for half a second during which you cannot do nothing.
Basically your character just gets microstuns every time you do an attack, well, because he is special, I suppose. If you want to be somewhat mobile, you will be forced to do a dodgy combination of jump-attack-land-jump-attack-dodge, spamming z-x-zx with a tight timing.
This way you will manage to eliminate this dumb recovery time. And it does not looks like an intended strat, rather than some lag abuse.

3. Terrible enemy animations. They are just nonsense. Basically anyone just rushes into you without any anticipatory movement whatsoever. One second the guy just stands still, and the other one he is moving towards you with an insane speed.
You will basically have no time to react whatsoever.
There IS a prepare attack animation but it is played 1-3 second before the actual attack, which makes it useless, because you will be forced to remember a timing for every single enemy.

4. Enemies itself. Bosses are piss weak and airborne enemies fly away and attack you with ranged attack from where you cannot reach them. Rest of enemies is just boring.

5. Plot. You will need to read a shitton of boring text notes in order to understand anything. It gets annoying very quickly and you will just quit reading it at some point.

6. Trade mechanics, NPCs - you will be broke AF all the time, and sometimes you will manage to save some money to buy an item that will be useful for 15 mins, because you will find a better one in dungeon already.
Of course items sold for a 10-20% of their original cost.
There are some tokens that will allow you to random some gold, if you lucky you get a 10% of a usual item cost, if not then nothing.

7. Teleport system is just something. It looks like devs just trolling. Why not create a usual teleport/bonfire which allows you to fast travel? No, instead you need to walk into main cave, enter the next room, which has entrance to the mines subhub, in which there IS a teleport, which you can use to teleport to the gardens/castle/other subhub, from which you could exit at the point you need to. Ugh, just why???

8. Art style looks nice at first but it becomes annoying quite quickly. It is simply not competitive.

9. Death mechanics. You just die. Yep.

10. Terrible true random mechanics in game where you can save. I.e. slot machine near save. There is a scroll that gives you 1 random stat point, so, you could just random it, or, if you want to choose which stat to up - roll it near save point. Yeah, why not ask a player which stat to up, rather than up a random one and give a save point. Nice.
Basically either get a shit stat, or suffer to get one you want.

11. Terrible stats and item mechanics in general. There are 4 stats and they don't really fit into the game.


There is a lot more of terrible things to this game that I forgot to mention.

If you want to have a good time, just buy any other platformer game, not this one, this one will only bring you frustration and boredom.",1598950986,1598950986,False,0,1,0.475113123655319214,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It seems to aim for a decidedly steampunkish flavour, and does pretty well at that.

The graphics are charming and would look right at home on a SNES or a GBA. It's not all that difficult a game, which is good if you're just looking for a casual experience (as I often am). If it has higher difficulty, I didn't bother to look for it in the settings.

The completionist will find a great deal of grinding ahead of themselves, in that there are lots of enemy types in the game to fill in your bestiary, and most of them have multiple random drops for you to find in order to finish filling out their stat blocks. Some of said drops are rare, and quite powerful upgrades, as I found out on a few occasions, so might be worth it, but not really necessary. While I did die a fair bit, it never felt overly punishing, and that's probably why I was fine to just get killed on a whim, looking for secrets, or pushing ahead without better gear. If I took a more cautious approach and spent more time crafting, I likely would have died much less often.

On that note, the crafting system is simple, but it does give you something else to do, complimenting the grinding process a bit. Not only is there weapon and armour crafting, but you can also make food and potions. Plenty to do here.

I got nearly 20 hours out of it, which seems fair, and while I didn't complete all entries in my bestiary, nor complete all crafting, I'd recommend that you get it on sale. I'm the last one to suggest that indie devs compete in a race-to-the-bottom on pricing, even with the lovingly crafted pixel art, and reasonably engaging gameplay, I don't think this game is on the same level as some others at this price point, such as Axiom Verge, but it's still GOOD.",1598548317,1598548317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sadly, I find myself roaming the same corridors with no real guidance for where to go next, and let me tell you there is a lot of ground to explore. You get new abilities and tools as time goes on but you have to discover for yourself where to find them. All I find are screens with a barrier I cannot pass because I lack the respective ability/tool. After exploring the entire available map 3 or 4 times (literally), I miraculously discovered a new task that (wait for it) sends me on a scavenger hunt around the entire map! 

If you have absolutely nothing better to do, this might be for you. But for me, it is far too boring and monotonous running the same screens and killing the same enemies until I find something new by mistake.

Bem... O que dizer de [b]Chasm[/b]? Um metroidvania bem mais do mesmo que não apresenta grandes inovações, mas não falha em muitos aspectos. Essa falta de falhas, que pode ser representada por conta do jogo ser bem igual aos demais e repetir tudo que dá certo nos demais.
Nunca fui muito fã do gênero e nunca me dediquei à ele, porém, vendo outras avaliações dizendo que Chasm era um jogo bem mais do mesmo, aproveitei que estava em promoção e comprei pra me divertir com um jogo básico, e o resultado foi bom. Gostei do que vi, e gostei do tanto que me empenhei pra descobrir as coisas que descobri durante minha jogatina. E se já tive um resultado bom com um jogo bem genérico... Fico animado pros títulos grandes do subgênero metroidvania.

[h1] História [/h1]
Uma história que, é bem mais do mesmo, além de ser bem batida e que, dependendo do tipo de joga que você tá acostumado à jogar, pode até estar de saco cheio de ver. E o final, que poderia apostar em algo diferente pra quebrar essa linha genérica que a história estava seguindo... Apenas pôs a cereja em cima do bolo de coisa que todo mundo tá enjoado de ver.

[h1] Mecânicas [/h1]
Não tem nada muito inovador, tirando o fato que o jogo te põe pra buscar as mecânicas à mais que o seu personagem, geralmente, já vem aprendido. Nadar, escalar, segurar em beiradas e até mesmo pulo duplo, estão por sua conta de serem encontrados pelo mapa e aproveitar de tais benefícios.
Por um lado, gera frustração de não conseguir passar de certas partes logo de cara quando você as encontra. Porém, isso acaba funcionando como uma faca de dois gumes, porque... Quando você consegue encontrar as ferramentas que te permitem passar de uma parte do mapa que não conseguia antes, você volta lá com, além de vontade de passar por algo que não conseguia antes, uma curiosidade ainda maior do por que o jogo te fez esperar tanto por esse momento.

[h1] NPC's [/h1]
Outra coisa no jogo que você precisa ir encontrando aos poucos. O motivo? Bem, o jogo vai te dizer isso, então compre-o para saber.
Nenhum deles é extremamente essencial pra sua campanha, e a maior parte só serve pra você conseguir a conquista de ""Complete todas as missões secundárias dos NPCs"". Em específico, apenas a NPC que faz poções vai ser útil do momento que você encontra ela até o fim do jogo. Até porque... Todo mundo precisa carregar um pouco de vida e mana extra consigo na mochila.

[h1] Mapa [/h1]
Sempre que você mata o último boss importante daquele ambiente, você libera o próximo. E cada um tem sua variedade própria de inimigos e mini-bosses que, dependendo do momento do jogo que você estiver, vão te fazer suar um pouquinho para serem enfrentados.
Digo isso, pois, à partir de certa parte do jogo, eu estava tão forte que eu só ficava parado na frente do boss tomando todo dano possível, sem nem precisar recuperar nem esquivar de nenhum golpe, batendo nele até o coitado morrer. O que também, não demorava muito. Então... É... Vai de você escolher a build certa pra escolher se você quer economizar tempo ou não matando bichos e bosses pelo mapa.

[h1] Inimigos [/h1]
Alguns poucos são bem, bem irritantes. Por exemplo: A aranha da Fortaleza. O cogumelo dos Jardins. O gladiador do Templo. Os Kobolds das Minas. Enfim, bem poucos são de fato irritantes à ponto de você simplesmente só querer ignorar eles à querer o XP que eles podem te render.
A grande maioria são até bem feitos, tem uma arte bem legal, e uma mecânica ligeiramente única dentro do próprio jogo. Mas, claro, nada de tão inovador se você já é um mestre em metroidvanias.

[h1] Bosses [/h1]
Cada ""mapa"", ""ambiente"", ""local"" diferente tem o seu próprio ""main boss"". Quando você mata ele, como dito anteriormente, você está habilitado para partir para o próximo. Além disso, você encontra vários mini-chefes pelo caminho. Muitos deles... Do nada. Sério. Às vezes você só tá voltando de uma sala e um boss aparece no caminho... Enfim.
Muitos deles são criativos, e aqui vale algumas menções: O Titan, o Wendigo, o Gnarlox, o Espectro e por fim, o Xamã.
O jogo tem dois bosses especiais mesmo pra história. No caso, um rei que enlouqueceu, e o motivo dele ter enlouquecido. O tal rei e o boss final, que, como dito anteriormente, foi o motivo dele ter enlouquecido, não estão nas menções de bosses interessantes porque... O rei simplesmente não é, e o boss final do game é obrigação de ser... Então... É.

[h1] Considerações finais [/h1]
Bem... Não compre fora de promoção. Não vale o preço cheio de jeito algum!
Compre caso você não tenha mais nada pra jogar, e queira se divertir com um jogo metroidvania mais-do-mesmo. Ou então, caso não seja familiarizado com o gênero, compre para ver o que um jogo metroidvania pode te apresentar. Caso goste, faça como eu.

First a warning, no resolution works with ultrawide monitors, you're always going to have at least small black bars on all sides of the screen and 1080p does have them but stretches the image so everything looks fat. The best resolution is 1600x900. 2K and 4K look horrible.

Kudos to the artists, the game and animations look gorgeous, but whoever planned gameplay and progression SHOULD be FIRED, real incopetence right there. Drop rates are miserable, attack animations take longer than they should to force you to never miss or be punished for it, you're saving people left and right and none of them even reward you.

Even the first enemies you first meet require dozens of kills to get one of their drops, and if you want drops from bosses guess what, the only way is to not get any damage when fighting them.

There is contact damage when touching enemies, which ok no biggie, BUT the damage is the same as if you get hit by their attack which is completely insane.

One of the worst offenders, there is no mana regen at all, you're stuck having to hit lamps to get mana back, who the hell though anyone would like this nowadays? Can't you have an original idea?

I still enjoy playing it, even if it's a half baked metroidvania, one of the good things about it is that collectibles get marked on the map so it's easy to backtrack, unlike in many out there. 

The soundtrack and even sound effects are all low quality and boring, in no way they represent the harsh combat system in which you can easily die before you even realize it.

The game would have been much better if they divided it into missions in other regions instead of cramping everything under a single mine in a small town, there was so much potential here, make the fort the central hub and then create a series of places with quests, it would also give them plenty of space to add more to the game via updates or even DLC.

The game has a lot of wasted potential, if you love metroidvanias play it at least once, but don't expect anything even near to the same experience you can get from playing bloodstained, for me this game is a 6/10",1597336844,1602017574,True,0,1,0.444501638412475586,0,False,False,False,False,,,

 Первое, что стоит сказать, я не знал, ни о Kicktarter, ни о обещаниях. Увидел скриншоты и оружие, вспомнил castlevania ( именно с ней и все сравнивают данный проект ), не хотел покупать из за средненьких отзывов. И вот чудо, а точнее все тот же мой любимый humblebundle, где и появился бандл за доллар с ней. 
 Купил не задумываясь и решил сыграть. Обычно, пишу обзоры только после прохождения игры ( или в случае, когда не понравилась и она уходит в корзину ), но в этой много моментов, которые хочется сразу сказать, ибо потом забуду, скорее всего.
Давайте с плюсов
[olist]
    [*]Симпатичная пиксельная графика
    [*]Отличное, отзывчивое управление
    [*]не напрягающая музыка на заднем фоне и симпатичный задник с заходом солнца в начале игры ( прост чего то вспомнилось :D )
[/olist]
Ну, в общем все, поехали по минусам:
[olist]
    [*]Первое, и самое важное - ее особенность и есть ее главный косяк. Обьясняю: разработчики обещали полностью генерированный мир при каждом новом запуске игры новый случайный мир. Это вроде классно, да? Но нет. Если в том же Rogue Legacy было сложно играть и умирали вы буквально от всего (понятно, если вы не супер-пупер-прогеймерэвер ), то тут мобы ужасно слабенькие. То, чего я больше всего не люблю во многих играх - кликер. Все правильно, большинство мобов и даже первый босс, да и второй в общем то просто закликиваются. Нет, конечно, прыгать и уворачиваться вам хотя бы минимально надо, но все же...
    [*]Постоянное чувство, что я уже все это видел и во все это играл, несмотря на то, что легендарную castlevania SoN я не прошел и играл в целом мало
    [*]Однообразные локации. И еще важный момент для меня, в сюжетных metroidvania(h) все-таки есть секреты, а секреты это очень и очень круто! Ну круто же!? Так вот, тут их нет, опять таки все из за той же генерации...
[/olist]
 Как бы, после моих любимых Hollow Knight, Salt and Sanctuary и еще многих других, эта мне не понравилась, но она и не очень плоха. Имеется несколько подземелий, быстрые переходы, магазины... Вот пишу и понимаю, что это везде есть лол.
 Из вдохновителей Castlevania я бы очень советовал bloodstained curse of the moon, хоть она и очень коротенькая, но все же Кодзи Игараси был также и создателем той самой Castlevania. Так как есть много хороших игр в данном жанре, эту я все-таки не рекомендую.

But it's a quick game, naturally it requires backtracking if you intend to gain certain items and upgrades (the main upgrades being, as far as I know, mandatory for story progression, the reason for the ""as far as I know"" part is because I didn't tried to finish it without first trying to get everything that was possible).

When it comes down to fighting, most enemies have a set attack and movement pattern with little variation which is good since this will help anyone trying to pass any part, this really comes into play when fighting bosses since the game actually rewards you with a powerful item (and achievements) every time you kill a boss without losing any health in the fight, some of these items (most of them being weapons (with one exception) imo are useful but to a certain extent defined by your personal needs or the strenght they give you in certain parts of the dungeons.

[spoiler] There is a new game plus mode which gives you the possibility to choose specific classes to play with, these classes do not restrain (at least in a forced way) the usage of some weapons and armor, but they change stats growth, which means that an weapon that raises your magic stat won't be all that useful if you chose to play as a Thief or a Warrior (or Knight, don't really remember the specific name for the strenght centered class) for example. There's a sort of ""roguelike mode"" in the game as well in which after dying the game erases the world you just made. Right now I don't remember more aspects to this NG+ option however, sorry for that. [/spoiler]

To end this quick review, you will certainly be able to finish this game in way less than 35 hours (which is my record to the day when I'm writing this) and I say that because I grinded too much, all the money I've earned was overkill, at the end of the game I already bought almost everything I wanted to and still had a lot of money even after spending thousands on potions, the problem with time spent on grinding might show up when fighting enemies to acquire specific items required to upgrade your equipment. if you want a game to have some hours of fun, I truly believe that you will be amused by it (even if it's just slightly), but if you're looking for something that's completely inovative I don't believe there is.

Os controles são responsivos, os inimigos em sua maioria agressivos e a dificuldade aumenta gradualmente em uma medida boa o bastante para que o jogador consiga sempre se adaptar.
O mapa, apesar de ser semi aleatório falha em manter o valor de replay alto por não alterar as experiências o bastante. Não chega perto de ser um roguelike.
Falando em valor de replay, o jogo oferece ao jogador algumas opções que deixam suas jogatinas futuras um pouco mais frescas, principalmente caso queira jogar com outra ""build"".
O jogo conta também com um belo estilo em pixel art com criaturas e cenários belos o bastante para que você se sinta imerso no mundo no qual está inserido.
Infelizmente não posso deixar de apontar os pontos negativos. A trilha sonora, em sua grande maioria, deixa a desejar na maioria das áreas (marca geralmente forte em metroidvanias).
A história é absolutamente esquecível. Acredito que uma decisão melhor seria se tivessem deixado-a de lado para que o jogador pudesse estabelecer sozinho uma construção de mundo estruturada em sua experiência. A luta contra o último chefe aponta o ápice do desapontamento em um momento anti climático para o jogador que ousou se importar com a história.

Геймплеем ничем не может выделится от остальных представителей данного жанра - она максимально отдает духом Симфонии Ночи. Не сказать, что в игре присутствует динамичность (а ее будет поменьше в сравнении с той же Каслванией), скорее медленный темп, отдающий этаким чувством... успокоения (этому еще способствует характерная музыка, проигрывающаяся в различных локациях). 

Все могло быть намного лучше, если бы не вырезали контент, ввели упрощения в геймплее в угоду для... чего? Неясно. 

И все же мне нравится эта игра. Она манит своей простотой, приятной для глаз картинкой и, разумеется, добротным саундтреком, реально заставляя игрока расслабиться.

Chasm feels good to play at the start.  The controls are responsive and the artstyle is very nice to look at.  The early content is directed and purposeful.  It gradually begins to unravel after that.

After the first couple areas, Chasm falls hard into the worst trappings of the Metroidvania genre, which is collect powerup so you can backtrack to collect another powerup so you can backtrack.  Additionally, procedural generation combined with the extreme randomness in drops, loot modifiers, and the relative uselessness of the equipment vendors/crafting systems leads to an unbalanced sense of progression.  The randomness may allow for no two playthroughs to feel the same, but it also serves to muddle what could have been a more carefully crafted experience.

None of these systems are rotten by themselves, but each is off-kilter just enough to exacerbate issues in the others.  This, combined with other bizarrely tedious mechanics such as having to backtrack inside the hub to save, having to return to the surface from the hub on foot, and only being able to refill magic on the surface, suggests a game that needed to take more feedback from playtesters.

Es plätschert vor sich hin, gibt mir dann und wann Upgrades und lässt mich nach und nach die zufallsgenerierte Karte erkunden. Das ganze Spiel geht auf Nummer sicher und traut sich keine Innovationen zu - das finde ich schade, denn mir hat Chasm gut gefallen.

Der Plot: In <Generischer Dorfname hier einfügen> ist <Art des Grauens>, also muss <Insert Name here> los, um <Zu erreichendes Ziel>, damit er <Belohnung>. Punkt. Hier wird eine allgemein bekannte Geschichte erzählt, die genau wie der Rest nicht aus der sicheren Zone kommt.

""Hilfe, Hilfe!"", rief <Wegweisender NPC>.
""Wie kann ich helfen?"", fragte <Insert Name here>
""Wir haben ein Metroidvanialabyrinth unter der Stadt und alle Dorfbewohner wurden aus unerfindlichen Gründen in Käfige gesteckt und nicht einfach umgebracht, also wurden sie an schwer erreichbare Orte gebracht, die keinen Sinn ergeben. Hoffentlich kommt gleich einer, der in einer festgelegten Reihenfolge Upgrades freischaltet, damit er nach und nach unsere Bewohner befreien kann!""
""Sag nicht ein Wort mehr, austauschbarer NPC! Ich bin schon unterwegs!""
""Danke.""
""Ich habe doch gerade gesagt, dass du nicht ein Wort mehr sagen sollst! Bedeuten dir klare Ansagen nichts?!""

Und so begab sich <Insert Name here> hinab in die Mine, prügelte sich in Castlevaniamanier durch Einstiegszonengegner, erreichte hier und da eine neue Stufe, um nach und nach stärker zu werden. Denn eins stellte <Inser Name here> schnell fest: Nicht die Endbosse waren der schwierigste Teil des Spiels, nö, Hindernisse und spätere Standartgegner waren's die ihm schnell mal die Hosen auszogen, um ihm zu zeigen, wofür man Stangenwaffen noch so verwenden kann. Das ist ein Punkt, den <Insert Name here> in seiner Ausbildung nicht gelernt hatte: Eigentlich soll es nicht sein, dass man vor großen Obermackern steht und munter drauf einhaut, bis der Typ umfällt - ein Obermotz sollte das bisher Gelernte auf die Probe stellen. Es kam nie vor, dass <Insert Name here> auf seine Items zugreifen muss, die er sich im Verlaufe seines Verliesausfluges erspielt hat. Es reichte, wenn er einen Stock mit entsprechender Wucht immer wieder auf die Rübe seines Gegenübers schlug. Irgendwann langte es dem auch mal. Dafür machten's die Bewohner des Untergrunds unserem austauschbaren Helden schwer. Sie wirbelten herum wie kleine Tornados und verfügten oft über mehrere Angriffsmuster, die sie anhand ihrer Körperhaltung verrieten. Mit Geschick und einer guten Beobachtungsgabe lernte <Insert Name here>, wie er mit welchem Gegner umzugehen hat und tobte von einem Raum zum nächsten. Neue Feinde erforderten mehr Aufmerksamkeit, aber wenn er <Zu erreichendes Ziel> wollte, musste er sich anstrengen!
Die seichten RPG-Elemente versüßten <Insert Name here> den Tag, denn nach genug verkloppten Feinden erhöhten sich die Charakterwerte automatisch. <Insert Name here> musste sich keine Gedanken über einen Build machen, er wurde durch die Bank weg stärker. Schade nur, dass diese Wertanstiege kaum ins Gewicht fielen, da sie zu niedrig waren. Ob er nun 61 oder 62 Schaden pro Kelle austeilte, fiel selten ins Gewicht. Nur gelegentlich brauchten Gegner dadurch einen Hieb weniger. Auffälliger wurden die Schadenswerte, wenn die Ausrüstung ins Spiel kam, die sich <Insert Name here> bei <Generischer Schmied> für einen kleinen Obolus zusammenbastelte oder im Dungeon fand. Seine Widersacher konnten Items in drei Seltenheitsstufen fallen lassen und wenn diese Gegenstände nicht ruck, zuck überholt gewesen wären, hätte sich manchmal ein gezielter Grind gelohnt. Nötig war das nie, denn der Ausflug unter <Generisches Dorf> dauerte nicht lang. Beim ersten Durchlauf benötigte <Insert Name here> lediglich 7 Stunden und das, obwohl er die einzelnen Stufen bis auf den letzten Stein erkundet hatte.
Schnell war die Dorfbevölkerung an der Oberfläche wieder vereint. <Generischer Schmied>, <Tränketante>, <Magieschickse> und der ganze Rest sangen Loblieder auf <Insert Name here> und zogen ihm keine zehn Minuten später das hart verdiente Geld aus den Taschen, anstatt ihren Retter kostenlos zu unterstützen, denn so lernte man es auf der NPC-Schule.

""Brauchst du magische Unterstützung bei deinen Abenteuern?"", fragte <Magieschickse>, ein Sortiment aus hilfreichen Zaubern präsentierend.
""Ja. Ich nehme jede Hilfe an, die ich zur Rettung deiner Mitbewohner erhalten kann!""
""Das macht dann 250 Gold, aufrüsten kost extra und wenn du schon mal da unten bist, holst du mir gefälligst irgendwelchen Schnulli aus einer Kiste am Arsch der Heide.""
<Insert Name here> schwieg nach dieser Aussage lange. Hinter ihm legte <Generischer Schmied> den Hammer beiseite und lauschte auf. 
""Habe ich gerade gehört, dass jemand ins Dungeon hinabsteigt, um irgendwelchen Rotz aus einer Kiste am Arsch der Heide zu holen?"", fragte er und rieb sich die Hände. 
Auch im Gasthaus öffneten sich die Fenster. Der Bergarbeiter kam aus seinem Schmelzofen, um zu <Insert Name here> zu schlurfen wie ein Untoter. Ein Kopfgeldjäger, der sein Geld mit Auftragsmorden verdiente, dachte, dass es jetzt an der Zeit wäre, das mal nicht zu tun und den nächsten Auftrag einem dahergelaufenen Hobbyhelden zu überlassen. Sogar ein Kind, kaum älter als 8, gesellte sich zu den Bittstellern, um nach einen Spielzeug zu fragen, das tief in einer von Geisterrüstungen und Untoten bevölkerten Burg verborgen lag. <Insert Name here> traute sich gar nicht zu fragen, wie es da überhaupt hingekommen ist.
""Ihr elenden Parasiten!"", fluchte <Insert Name here>, nachdem er mit Aufträgen be- und völlig überladen war. ""Könnt ihr euren Scheiß nicht alleine machen?""
""Wofür hat man denn Helden?""
""Genau! Außerdem geben wir dir unbrauchbaren Dreck, wenn du unsere Aufgaben erledigt hast, also zeig gefälligst Dankbarkeit!""
""Hört, hört! Ich koche dir Essen, das kaum HP wiederherstellt, wenn du mir drei Säcke Mehl bringst - das kann doch nicht so schwer sein!""

<Insert Name here> seufzte. Das Leben als Held war kein schönes, aber es war eines. Wenn er am kommenden Abend am Speicherpunkt sitzen und über den Tag sinnieren würde, könnte er immerhin behaupten, er habe was geschafft und was aus seinem Leben gemacht. Geschlagen schlich er hinab ins Dungeon und ließ seinen Frust an den stärker werdenden Gegnern aus. Die griffen ihn wenigstens an und äußerten ihren Zorn ihm gegenüber nicht mit passiv-aggressiven Quests. Feinde waren ehrliche Gesellen! Die wollten einfach nur seinen Lebensbalken reduzieren und nicht, dass er ihre Besorgungen erledigt. Außerdem konnte niemand wissen, was er unter der Erde noch so lernen würde. Erst vor wenigen Stunden hatte er erfahren, dass man sich an Vorsprüngen [i]festhalten[/i] konnte. Das Konzept war so verrückt wie brillant. Warum hatte ihm das niemand vorneweg gesagt? Auch Wandsprünge waren möglich und wenn der Ausbilder in <Generische Heldenschule> mal mit der Sprache rausgerückt hätte, wäre es um ein Vielfaches leichter gewesen, jeden Morgen pünktlich im Exerzierhof zum Appell anzutreten. Grundsätzlich waren alle Rekruten zu spät, da irgendein Genie gedacht hatte, es wäre fantastisch, wenn die gesamte Umgebung aus schwebenden Plattformen bestehen würde. Dass es ein Grauen war, sich durch das Chaos hindurch zu manövrieren, fiel dem auch erst ein, als der Zug längst abgefahren war. 

Auch wenn die Dorfbevölkerung eine Ansammlung aus Arschlöchern war und <Insert Name here> nicht viel von ihnen hielt, so wollte er sie doch befreien - denn das war's nun mal, was einen Helden ausmachte ... ganz gleich, wer eigentlich der Obermacker war und warum der auf die losgehen wollte. Solche Dinge waren nicht wichtig, wenn es darum ging, etwas Gutes zu tun - oh, und außerdem hatte er echt verdammt viel Spaß unten im Verließ. Kobolde vertrimmen war echt fett.",1594916755,1594920951,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It has a really nice art and visual design, with a starting concept that would seem great on paper. And that's where the game falls apart. The map and loot is all randomly generated, and in consequence throws away all semblance of progression and level design.

You can get strong equipment really fast, and most of what you'll obtain will be obsolete before you even find it. Crafting is also very underdeveloped and will probably serve 1 or 2 times. Some mechanics/abilities are very throwaway and it's a shame. UI and inventory are not handy to use, and can be annoying at times.

The combat itself lacks fluidity and feels clunky at times, making fighting all the enemies in your path a chore. Lacks depth beyond kiting. And speaking of repetitive, exploration is also lacking due to previously mentioned RNG generation. The rooms will look the same and the layout lacks all the genius design a handcrafted environment can have.

Story is very forgettable due to how generic it is, though it isn't actually bad. It was fun finding all the townfolks as you progressed.

Honestly, it could've been a good metroidvania if it had gotten some design instead of using RNG, but since it's the foundation of the game it isn't enough to make it a positive outcome. I can't recommend it.

And if you really want to try for yourself, wait for a sale for sure.
Missed potential due to bad design decisions, shame.

Visually it is an excellent game, there is so much detail in every room. Another strong point is the musical score, most of the tunes add more flavor to each location.

 However, there are some aspects of the game that have a negative impact in the outcome. First of all, there is a procedurally-generated map each time you start a new adventure. You may find yourself deep into one of the dungeons and a save room is still many rooms away, if you die you return to your last save room so there will be many infuriating moments. Secondly, the combat is a bit fiddly, the animations are fine but to make every weapon different there are too many recovery frames in most weapons. The result is that you get hit too often because the main character is still recovering from your last action. Finally, the price of some of the most useful items is too high, use them too many times and you will need to grind enemies for gold.

Excellent use of sub pixel animation really brings the environments to life.

This game tries really hard to be a SoTN Style Castlevania game. The main weapons all behave the same as their Castlevania counterparts. All of the spells are reticent of the sub weapons front the classic Castlevania games. And you can even cancel your attack delay by landing.

This game has a serious problem with the drop rates. I wouldn’t be surprised if the chance for anything to drop was literally just your luck stat as a percentage. You will never have money for anything in this game.

The map is procedurally made with pre-built rooms. I don’t think that the enemies are baked into the rooms though, so a repeat room might have different monsters in it at least. As far as the actual layouts go though, it wasn’t so bad. Segments of rooms are mixed together to make a lot of similar rooms with slight differences.
This can lead to some sadistic placement of enemies and save points. Healing items are not easy to come by. Enemies will rarely drop light heals. In town you can buy from a very limited supply of cheap food or some expensive potions. Otherwise you are at the mercy of the save points.

I played on hard and got a alright challenge. I really had to memorise enemy placement and attack patterns to get by. 
I was pretty frustrated that the town portal scroll was crazy expensive. I already don’t have enough cash for healing items or equipment. But it cost double the price of the big health potion just to keep my exp?!

The game is pretty light on puzzles but can have some rough platforming at times. I blame most of this on the wall jump. It feels bad. Just having the wall slide makes it hard to grab ledges. It pushes you far out from a wall so you can't vertically climb a single wall. Which isn’t a bad decision, but in the Temple zone, it pushes you out towards laser walls and it sucks. Also when you instinctively move the way you want to jump, you will just let go of the wall like that and fall. It makes sense in the sequence of events, but it feels bad. There should be some coyote time to do the wall jump.

Speaking of the upgrades. Some were super situational and others invalidated previous upgrades. There overall wasn’t a ton of variety with them, but that's fine because this is a combat focused game.

I wasn’t a fan of the loot modifiers. When I open a hard to reach chess, I expect some fat loots. But because of the modifiers I’m encouraged to save scum until I get a good version of whatever is in the chess. Again the drop rates of money and gear suck, so what's in that chess is the only new gear I’m going to see for a while.
I did like how similar weapons aren’t all just re-skins though. For example, the long sword is long! This lends itself well to a more balanced gear selection like Dark souls has. However the gear is tiered. So you will eventually have to trade out your weapon's unique quirk for something that just does a lot more damage.

Also the magic system is pretty busted. Its super spammable and mana potions are super cheap compared to everything else. Upgrades spells only cost gems, which aren't used for anything else. So its the one thing you can reliably spend.

If you can’t tell I am super salty about the drop rates. Because when I got to the final area I didn’t have a lot of heals or money. The space between the save point and the boss room has a lot of lava and tanky monsters, so it’s crazy hard to reach the end with any resources. I was already at my limit with the difficulty so I just gave up.

Overall the game isn’t bad, I definitely could have enjoyed myself more on a lower difficulty. But I think the procedural map is a massive crutch. I would have been a lot happier if I had a better seed, or better yet, the devs made a map with actual pacing… I just don’t think it works for long form games. Moreover I don’t think it helps replayability, because the bosses, zones, and upgrades are all still the same.

A similar game “A Robot Named Fight!” has a ton of alternatives to upgrades and bosses, and even zones. And the runs only last an hour, so any repetitiveness is easily overlooked. This makes every seed feel like a unique game and I think it all just works better there.",1592630755,1592631094,False,30,0,0.651808023452758789,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Z tego co się orientuję większość z wymienianych problemów zostało w kolejnych patchach naprawione i ja z żadnym bugiem się nie spotkałem (grałem na patchu czerwiec 2020, 1.076). Gra nie jest porzucona i developerzy ciągle ją patchują po kilku latach od premiery więc tu bardzo na plus. Jeśli recenzje wymieniające bugi Cię zniechęcały to nie powinieneś się tym obecnie przejmować.

Nie jestem miłośnikiem metroidvani i może dlatego nie mam prawie żadnych uwag do tego aspektu. Owszem ten zakres gry jest uproszczony, skille, itemki, zarządzanie rozwojem postaci to wszystko jest zgrzebne ale będąc graczem którego głównie interesował element zręcznościowy nie miało to dla mnie większego znaczenia. 

Powiedziałbym, że klasyczna metroidvania jest obecna w 30% zawartości a 70% gry to część zręcznościowa. Tak, zręczność palców i cierpliwość w powtarzaniu poziomów bardzo się przyda i zostanie poddana sporemu testowi ;) Proceduralnie (pseudo, wiele fragmentów się powtarza między seedami) generowane korytarze i poziomy niestety nie sprzyjają balansowi trudności rozgrywki. Brak balansu w tej grze (na początku każdy nas bije, od połowy gry my bijemy bez problemu każdego) jest jedną z większych jej bolączek, która dla mnie osobiście zabija chęć powtórzenia całej gry na innym seedzie i poziomie trudności.

Czasem dysproporcja trudności między 2 przyległymi poziomami i brak checkpointów na długich odcinkach poziomu daje we znaki. Pojawia się spora dawka frustracji spowodowana śmiercią i koniecznością przechodzenia poziomu ponownie ze świadomością, że za następnym nieznanym rogiem znów możemy zginąć i wracać tam kolejne 15 min. Wiele razy miałem ochotę odstawić grę na kilka dni właśnie z powodu długich trudnych odcinków wypełnionych wrogami i pułapkami (chociaż wydaje mi się, że twórcy gry w kolejnych patchach zwiększyli szanse na wygenerowanie ""savepointa"" w postaci komnaty gdzie odzyskujesz całe zdrowie i zapisujesz grę). Dopiero w poźniejszym czasie gromadząc sprzęt przez losowe dropy albo zamierzony powtarzalny grind (osobiście polecam kalkulowany grind by podbić level i wydropić lepsze itemki niż liczenie tylko na przypadkowe szczęście) stajemy się na tyle bogaci by zakupić potki HP czy MP i wtedy życie staje się łatwiejesze :)

Ostatecznie grę ukończyłem i była to przyjemna podróż. Okraszona frustracją ale ta gra miała dla mnie rzadką moc w swoim gameplay'u czyli gdy wkurzony śmiercią wychodziłem to godzinę później już ponownie byłem w grze. Ta gra miała dla mnie [b]siłę magnesu[/b] pomimo wywoływanej irytacji a to jest dla mnie rzadkość i bardzo to cenię. Taka mieszanka wybuchowa, jak smaczna ostra pizza :D piecze na wejściu, piecze na wyjściu ale i tak ją w końcu zamawiamy następnym razem :D

Muzyka w grze nie powala, jest czymś co nie przeszkadza. Fabuła jest... właściwie to jej prawie nie ma ale czasem zdarza się humorystyczny gag i jest spoko :) [b]Grafika za to jest genialna i piękna[/b], to była zresztą pierwsza rzecz którą gra przyciągnęła moją uwagę. Sterowanie (klawa) było przyjemne, nie mam uwag, nasz bohater reagował tak jak powinien.

Polecam gierkę wszystkim osobom lubiącym wyzwania zręcznościowe, zatwardziałym platformowcom którym setki lub tysiące śmierci przy nieudanym skoku nie są obce ;) Ten typ gracza moim zdaniem będzie miał tu [b]ogrom zabawy[/b]. Osoby które chciałyby zagrać dla metroidvanii muszą podejść do gry dużo dużo sceptyczniej i lepiej będzie obejrzeć 30 min z rozgrywki na YT przed zakupem.

Przejście gry na normalu zajęło mi 18 godz. w tym zrobienie 16/20 osiągnięć.

But not having a map at all is fucking annoying. Especially in this game where there are just empty rooms.
Backtracking is a pain and without a map you will get lost in dead ends all the time.

The weapons are basic. Extremely basic. 
The choices really are only attack in front of you at different ranges and an overhead swing.
Its boring af. The only (laughable) skill factor is how you use them which is you jump,
cause if you use the weapon on the ground, enjoy being rooted for the duration of the swing.
So if you want to keep up any momentum while attack, enjoy bunny hopping.

The magic just straight up pissed me off.
Its Castlevania items. And only the most basic ones. 
Throwing knife, throwing axe, throwing boomerang.
I was extremely disappointed that my magic molotov turned out to be Castlevanias holy water,
and it was weak as fuck on top of that.
Then I got the shield ... I thought I could maybe block attacks with it,
I mean what was i thinking, of course the shield isnt an actual fucking shield.
Its 3 orbitals that rotate around you and deal barely any damage. 
(this is also a Castlevania skill. in Dawn of Sorrow it was called Buer)

The enemies are boring. Their ai is stupid, they barely do anything.
Their patterns are crap. Theyre target practise at best.
The most damage I have taken from them was me taking contact damage from literally 
standing inside of them to burst them down.

The bosses arnt fairing much better. They have patterns at least.
But thats literally the good things I can say about them.
Their ""Arenas"" are empty rooms, havnt seen a platform in a bossroom yet.
Their attacks are either easily dodged like dashes or swipes, 
or you dont know what the fuck to do since your maneuverability is limited.
Like some worm thing shot homing plasma balls at me and I couldnt really do anything,
so I just stood inside of it and kept hitting it. As you can imagine its riveting gameplay.

And now the worst thing about this game. Level design.
Compared to all of the above, this is the true plague of this game.
There are so many goddamn empty rooms. 
I climbed up an empty passage, with the most basic repeating platform patterns only to find 2 empty dead ends at the top.
Thats how bad it gets. And even if it isnt completely empty, that one enemy that barely does more than
walking in a straight line is hardly a threat.

Conclusion I guess:
You know, I like Castlevania a lot and while it is cheap, unoriginal and unimaginative,
I would not mind a game copying its features if the result was good.
But they only took the worst parts and made everything else shit too.
I am majorly dissapointed",1591715524,1591773057,False,1,0,0.497523635625839233,0,False,False,False,False,,,

As a Castlevania-like platformer it is nice and fun, with one big BUT... The controls are a bit clumsy, but that's not a huge problem, it just costs you when you miss some platforms or so. This however grows as a problem, when you get deeper in the dungeon. There comes a real issue - save system. 

You can save only in special rooms, which is fine, but they are too faaaaaaaar away. It's not uncommon that you search dungeon for an hour. After you make few mistakes (either by your fault or because of controls), you are almost certainly low on health. There is not enough items to heal yourself, so only possibility is to backtrack all the way to last save. All the enemies respawn when you leave and re-enter the room (even though it was 1sec ago), so backtracking is the same danger like going forward. Well, let's say you survive that and get to the save point. After the save you gain all your health again, go forward to the final point you reached in the dungeon before, hopefully with less errors than before.

Big problem is in some places you can't see what you can expect during first run so it's common you loose your health until you realize what is happening.  When you make few of those mistakes you couldn't really avioid in a new room, you are low on health again... that means you need to backtrack all the way again. 

From some places there is not even possible to backtrack to save point (because of story). The result is you are sometimes in a position you know you will die soon, for example when the only way is to go in a boss battle, but you can't do anything about it and you know in advance all you have done in last hour will be meaningless. 

I'm sure there are many players that are more skilled or patient than me and are ok with this. But to be honest, I don't get this concept. For a proper hard-to-win game it's far too easy, almost a casual game as common enemies are really simple to match. If you seek just fun, it's unnecesarily annoying and punishing for small mistakes, because of save system, game design and you pay for errors with too much time consuming repetition.",1589666493,1589666815,False,4,0,0.563538014888763428,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I don't like handholding, but when you don't have handholding you need some logic to connect the dots in your brain. This works out a few times quite well in the form of some semi-obscure puzzles.

Maybe if the levels weren't random blobs you could have a logic to the level design that would aid in that, but no.

But I can't get past the frustrations it causes me when I play it. If you played Castlevania Symphony of the Night, then you'll feel right at home with the controls of the game. Slow walk speed, nice sprite animation quality, and back dashing is faster than walking.

The story is that you are a soldier sent to investigate the mine of a mostly abandoned town to save the townspeople who were abducted by monsters. The further you explore into the mines, you start finding other areas and lore based on the monsters and where they come from.

Most reviews I have skimmed have said that the problem with this game is the grinding and annoying combat. I agree that the combat is slow and very punishing. You have to learn enemy patterns or lose a CHUNK of health. They get harder and harder with little room for error the further you get into the dungeon. And if you want decent gear, even when you save townspeople, the shops are EXPENSIVE. Gold is few and far between and you'll really have to work your butt off leveling up and just trying to survive. 

My other main issue is the save points. You can't save at anytime, you can only save in certain rooms (just like Castlevania). The problem is that these rooms are few and far between. So imagine searching for an hour through the dungeon, your health is low because there is barely any health items in the game and suddenly WHAM you die. Guess what, that hour of progress is gone and you gotta do it all over again. Add the many leaps of faith and perfect timing jumps you have to make with how stiff your character is, and you're in for a rough start. I know you get some new abilities as you continue like wall climbing and the slide, but I grew so tired and frustrated from losing hours of progress because of the annoying combat, inability to save, and the grinding.

Final verdict? Give this game a try if you like metroidvanias with a challenge. Be prepared for lots of grinding, precise jumping, and tough gameplay. This is not a bad game, it's just really tough and precise and I do not have the patience to finish it. Thank you for reading!

But everywhere you look, there is jank and jank and poor design and more jank. I just couldn't take it anymore and had to write this review after the parachute failed to function after a ""double"" jump yet again. 

The bad
-Developers were far too conservative with movement skills. Where's the high jump? The grapple? The Roc's Feather? The Black Panther Soul? The <Insert other iconic interesting movement skills>? Nah, we two types of wall jumps and a neutered 1.5x jump masquerading as a double jump. And no, you cannot increase the character's slow movement speed - have fun backdashing and sliding everywhere just to get around slightly faster. Maybe the devs watched Symphony of the Night speedruns and thought ""wow, all that backdashing looks fun, let's make our entire game that!""
-Half of the enemies in the game. Many of the game's enemies are either pathetically easy or stupidly difficult. In the same area: ""Takes 3 hits to kill, deals 20 damage: I jump over his attack and stab him in the back until he dies."" vs ""Takes 12 hits, does 30 damage, huge so takes up the entire hallway, has highly inconsistent attack so you're going to take huge damage practically every time. Better have potions to chug.""
-Most of the bosses. The bosses use attacks reminiscent of bosses from other popular platforming games. This isn't a good thing. As mentioned before, the character moves around like a lead brick and has a giant hurtbox, so avoiding fast attacks or weaving through bullets Touhou-style does not work very well. In most cases, you will take less damage by taking a hit and using the iframes to damage the boss, thereby reducing your number of hits taken by killing the boss faster.
-Backtracking. To clear Area X, you have to backtrack to a number of areas equal to X/2, rounded up, to find that one item that lets you progress. The problem isn't the backtracking, but the lack of any real content in the areas you need to go to and, again, a lack of fun movement skills. ""Go back to Chapter 2 and slide through a passage to a room where you will receive an item that lets you wall jump, so you can go back to Chapter 1 to wall jump to a room where you will receive an item that will let you breathe underwater to let you complete Area 4 and move to Area 5, before which you will need to backtrack to Area 3 to get an item to let you double jump leading you back to Area 4 to get a lamp so you can progress to the second half of Area 5 before backtracking to Area 1 for...""
-Itemization. Why are red chests dropping me items inferior to a white item that dropped off of an enemy two areas ago? I had to go through the Arena to get to the area that dropped Iron Armor, so why is the Iron Armor worse in every way than the chest that I got from beating the Arena? I have been using the same blue sword for most of the game and it would be great to get an upgrade, or at least a sidegrade that I can switch between when the sword is less effective. Early in the game I had options, but as I progressed the interesting weapon variety disappeared.

The good
-The other half of the enemies. There are a lot of enemies where you have to recognize their tell and act in different ways, where if you act properly, you can successfully and consistently avoid and then punish the attack. This is good gameplay.
-Sound design. Music, etc.

I gave up towards the end as I was able to find all of the townsfolk but it was unclear as to where I needed to go or what to do to finish the game. Probably because I sold an important item.

I feel that there is too much Backtracking over the same 4 areas which slows the game down and makes it more of a chore than fun.  Super Metroid had more areas which were just inaccessible and you didn't have to remember where things were, you could just look at the map and see what area you haven't been to yet. Thats what made Chasm difficult and time consuming as you would pass by areas and it would highlight the map forcing you to have to stop and remember what you passed by. If you forget where something is prepare for at least an hour of backtracking or searching the entire map to find it. 

When I started a 2nd play through of the game I found that it didn't change much. This is due to certain parts such as boss fight areas and main entrances staying same. Its as if each room on the map is simply shuffled like a deck of cards and put in a different order each new game. This doesn't compare to a game called Terraria where the entire world is random and is never really the same.

Chasm to bardzo przyjemna gierka z gatunku metroidvani.
Na poziom trudności nie ma co narzekać, nawet normalny jest bardzo dobrym wyzwaniem.
Fabuła przedstawiona jest bardzo wąska i gdyby ją opisać, zmieściła by się w kilku zdaniach, ale sporą część świata gry przedstawiają notatki możliwe do odnalezienia po świecie, co jest dużym plusem bo sporo uzupełniają. 
Trzeba tutaj dodać, że świat generowany jest losowo lub można wprowadzić własne ziarno więc nasze podziemia nigdy nie będą takie same (chyba, że tego będziemy chcieli).
Całość ozdobiona jest dość typową jak na owy gatunek grafiką - co nie znaczy, że jest zła, jest na prawdę przyjemna, każde kolejne lochy wyglądają inaczej czy każdy potwór ma własny styl.
Dodatkowo muzyczka wpasowuje się w to, gdzie jesteśmy.
System walki jest dość prosty, stwory z którymi się mierzymy mają własne strategie ale na każdego jest indywidualny sposób - nie wspominając o bossach, którzy zasługują na swoje miano.
No i wisienką na torcie jest tutaj możliwość zmieniania ekwipunku i decydowania, co będzie dla nas najlepsze (a także drobny wybór klas postaci, któremu zawdzięczać będziemy rozłożenie punktów statystyk); jedyne co można byłoby zmienić, to aby nasz bohater zmieniał swój wygląd wraz ze zmianą przedmiotów - zbroi, bronie akurat wyglądają inaczej a także mają różne ataki.
[b] Gra na prawdę warta zagrania, nie tylko na przyjemną rozgrywkę samą w sobie, ale również na różne tryby jak wyzwania czy poziomy trudności - w tym permadeath - który w tego typu grze wielu wyjadaczy na pewno skusi. Jak dla mnie normalny poziom trudności wystarczy, sam tytuł udało mi się przejść w 12h - choć na liczniku 9 (wiadomo, jak się umrze, to lecimy do poprzedniego zapisu) i 100% w odkryciu mapy oraz odratowaniu zaginionych ludzi, ale do zdobycia wszystkich osiągnięć jeszcze daleko.

난이도: 어려움(노말 기준)
친절도: 불친절함(튜토리얼 없음)
조작감: 별로(난 보통이지만 호불호 갈리는 듯)
비쥬얼: 보통(픽셀)

피로도: 높음
스토리: 뻔한 스토리, 
한글어: 지원X, 패치X
총 평: 4점 (10점 만점)

1. 조작감
1)장점(주관적)
- 점프 할 때 중력 가속도 안받고 점프(점푸 중 방향 전환이 가능하다는 말),
2)단점
- 공격 캔슬이 안됨
- 회피기는 몇몇 몬스터한테만 유용하고, 점프 공격이 훨씬 효율이 좋음
-> 데드셀 같은 회피기를 생각하면 안됨(걍 뒤로 가는건데 무적이 아님)

2. 피로도
1) 거지같은 맵 디자인
- 마을에 포탈이 없어서, 마을을 갈려면 광산에 포탈을 타서 마을을 가야 한다
->즉  쓸데 없는 이동 시간이 생긴다.(마을에 포탈을 만들었으면 되는데 이걸 굳이...)
- 또 피 회복과 저장을 위해서 특정 장소를 찾아야 하는데 그게 광산 포탈에 있다. 
-> 새로운 포탈을 발견하면, 광산 포탈을 이동하여 피를 채우고 저장을 해야 한다. 
- 포션이 비싸기 때문에 이런 시스템에 의존할 수 밖에 없으므로, 엄청난 시간 낭비를 해야 한다.

이런 것이 계속 쌓이다 보니 쓸데 없이 시간낭비하는 구간이 생기며, 게임이 지루해 진다.
고전게임 특유의 지루함을 좋아하는 사람이면 추천한다.

3. 전체적인 게임 디자인에 대한 평
1) 직관적이지 못한 퍼즐
- 퍼즐도 직관적이지 못해서 짜증이 나며, 그렇지 않은 퍼즐은 너무 뻔하고 재미 없다.
2) 쓸모 없는 보조 무기(마법 무기)
- 날파리 잡기(칼), 보스전(매직쉴드) 빼고는 마법 무기는 거의 사용하지 않는다.
- 솔직히 없이 플레이 해도, 지장이 없을 정도이다.
3) 매력이 하나도 없는 시스템
- 먼가 아이템이 새롭거나, 시스템이 독특하거나, 혹은 손맛이 있거나 등등 이 게임만의 고유성이 없다. 다른 게임에 있는 시스템 엉성하게 따라 만든 ""망한"" 게임이다.
4) 가독성 떨어지는 문서들
- 나름 색깔로 구분 해놓았지만, 폰트 자체가 너무 구려서 읽는데 짜증난다
- 고전 게임을 따라 만들었지만, 내가 고전게임을 하는 것도 아닌데 굳이 거지같은 폰트로 된 글자를 읽고 싶진 않다.

4. 한글 X
- 유명하지 않은 게임이라서 한글패치도 없다. 이런 플랫포머 게임 치고 문서들이 굉장히 많이 나온다. 영어를 잘 못하면 읽을 수 없다. (대부분 쓸데 없는 내용이지만)

5. 게임 플레이 하면서 엿같은 점이 굉장히 많았는데, 지금 보스를 잡고 나서는 까먹었다.
아무튼 결론은 이딴겜 하지말고, 잘만든 횡스크롤 게임(deadcells, ori) 등등이 있으니 그걸 하는게 낫다.
너굴맨의 시간 15시간을 날렸으니, 안심하고 다른 게임 플레이 하라구!!

*번들로 구매해서 어쩔 수 없이 플레이어할 사람들을 위한 꿀팁
1. 플레이어 마다 맵이 조금씩 다르다
2. 자주 저장하는 습관을 들이자
3. 점프만 잘 써도 웬만한 몹은 한대도 안맞고 잡을 수 있음
(후반에 그게 귀찮아서 걍 노가다로 포션 사서 깸)
4. 숫자 퍼즐은 요번년도에 새로 업데이트 되었음. 유튜브에 있는 건 예전 버전이며, 큰방1개만 찾으면 된다(다른 길찾기도 잘모르겠으면 공략보고 하는걸 추천)
5. 보조무기는 매직쉴드랑 칼만 있으면 됨

Questa cosa mi fa molto piacere, perché c'è tanta gente con buone idee che merita un finanziamento.
Nel caso di ""Chasm"" posso dire che il gioco è venuto bene, seppur con delle mancanze.
Questa recluta dovrà scoprire cos'è successo in un piccolo villaggio, dove tutti i suoi cittadini, tranne il sindaco, sono spariti.
Se dovessi descrivere questo gioco, la parola giusta sarebbe ""anonimo"". Ed è anonimo perché è buono in tutto e non eccelle in niente. Una volta finito non c'è niente di ""Chasm"" che ti rimanga. Questo perché la storia che narra, approfondita da pochi documenti, è abbastanza semplice. Inoltre i personaggi del gioco, compreso lo stesso protagonista, non sono per niente descritti ed approfonditi. Non ti senti legato a nessuno. Nonostante questo, il gioco si lascia giocare con piacevolezza, sia per il buon numero di nemici che popola le varie mappe, sia per la buona quantità di segreti che potremo trovare. Anche per quanto riguarda le armi posso dire che sono diverse nelle skin, ma troppo simili nei pattern d'attacco. Buone le location, carine le musiche. Nota storta sono le boss fight: fatta eccezione per gli ultimi 3 Boss principali, questi saranno poco pericolosi e poco ispirati sia come design, sia come pattern d'attacco. Le boss fight segrete sono da dimenticare. C'è poi una simpatica modalità Arcade, dove potremo completare dei livelli random con un tempo di scadenza.
Non c'è stato il minimo impegno neanche nel creare un finale un pò più articolato ed approfondito.
""Chasm"" lo consiglio a chi ama i metroidvania, ma sappiate che esistono tante produzioni fatte meglio. Un buon gioco e basta.

I just now realized that I never actually posted my review for this absolute travesty of a game.  Everything that was present in the demo, with the exception of the graphics is gone.  You can't choose your stats or abilities on level up, everything is automated, leaving the player with no agency in how their character actually performs or advances.  The magic is boring; it just feels like generic projectile attacks like the items from Castlevania, very tacked on.  None of the magic feels like it is worth it when you can just get better items anyway.  Magic doesn’t make you feel powerful, or even magical.  The graphics are okay, I like the art style, but the motion blur is annoying, and some people have problems with it making them nauseous.  The enemies are incredibly stupid, and only walk towards you menacingly, not to mention their iffy hit boxes.  The level design is also annoying.  Since it’s semi-randomly generated at world creation, you get important rooms, such as save points and bosses, at roughly the same location no matter what, but the rooms between them are random.  On paper this is actually an excellent idea, but unfortunately, there’s no actual guarantee that those rooms will be any good.  For example, in most Metroidvanias, the rooms outside of critical need locations, such as healing, or saving rooms, are made to be easier or safer to traverse, so you don’t die at the last minute, and have to start all over again.  In game design, challenges are meant to be punctuated with safe easier areas to give players breathing room, if not check points.  Because the games ‘in between’ rooms are randomized though, you may get two challenges in a row that must be overcome in order to progress, or a particularly difficult challenge right outside of a boss fight or a save location.  Overall, this is a hard avoid for me.  I wanted to like it, as the PS3 demo was absolutely excellent, but the final product is devoid of everything that made it more than just a platformer.  If you like Metroidvanias, there is better elsewhere.  If you absolutely have to play this game, then get it at a discount.

Overall,  on  a range from ""Woohoo!"" to ""Cat coughing up hairball noises"", I have to give Chasm a solid ""Meh"".

I had anticipated this game once it was announced on Crowdfunding, but due to my serious reservations with the whole crowdfunding idea, I waited until the game was 50% off and paid $9.99 for it.

I'm glad that I only paid $9.99 for it. I like to judge how much fun I will have, or have had, with a game based on price and how much time it would take me to work for the price of that game.

I don't feel like I overpaid for it, and but also don't think that the experience is worth a full $20. Playing the content within the game for ""18 hours"" (7.5 hours of actual game time), the value of the game for me was about $1.33 an hour. I felt like the game was worth $1.33 an hour.

Overall, I felt like Chasm was tired though. After the games originally created content of the Mines location, the content felt repetitive and dry. The monsters had very similar characteristics, and the actions and ""puzzles"" seemed expected. I like when a game surprises me, but Chasm didn't do this other than rare occasions.

Parts of the game felt disjointed like: [spoiler] Ringing the bell tower bells [/spoiler]. Like why?

I felt myself just kind of playing the game not because ""I just had to see what happened next!"", but because I kept telling myself, ""maybe it will get better?"" 

Well, it didn't really.

It is a ""Metroidvania"" style game, with backtracking for almost always useless things that don't make you feel more powerful.

these reasons are why I give Chasm a ""Meh.""",1588523295,1588523295,False,16,0,0.591498315334320068,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The seed generator for starters is its most notable feature allowing the player to go through rooms in different orders with different enemy placements in every new game thus guaranteeing that each play through will be different. The music is another strength since each level has a catchy tune which is a must when the player is required to go through them for extended periods of time although I did listen almost exclusively to the chiptune version which to me just fit the game better given its pretty 16-bit graphics so my thoughts on the original track are inconclusive. In terms of overall gameplay I had a pretty good time. There's always a sense of progression due to the level up system, you're always finding new loot, and it feels good to kill stuff. One thing that made me almost hate the game by the end of it are the last two levels. They were an absolute CHORE to get through. One stage consisted entirely of teleporters so I was never sure which ones I had to take to progress and by the end of it I didn't even bother collecting any of the optional items because I just wanted to get the hell outta there as soon as possible. Unfortunately the final level was somehow even worse with projectile spam that made it almost impossible to avoid taking damage. Worst of all the final boss was 8 rooms away so when I died it'd be a while before I'd get another shot. God forbid I got hurt though because I needed every last bit of HP for the boss. I finished the game at level 31.

Greatly dislike how fast and random the bosses are initially, makes fighting them a real pain when your movement options are slide jump or walk without a divekick or anything (at least from what i experienced - you might get one later I only got slide the wall hang on certain ledges and the lantern), not that fun when a boss does a tenth of your hp every hit and you have to restart the fights repeatedly to learn proper timings to dodge things for phase 1 before triggering a phase 2 if there is one. 

Wouldn't particularly recommend unfortunately, would personally go obtain one of the older castlevanias or buy bloodstained just due to the sheer slog Chasm has to get back to wherever it is you died.

Unless there's something I'm missing regarding the weapons, there is no ""go-to"" that solves most of my issues, as the greatswords/clubs are very slow (as they should be admittedly, but there's no way to speed them up to my knowledge), the swords are quite clunky when you need to hit something smaller than you, the dagger is a death sentence and the same for fist weapons unless there's some hidden parry skill I missed. 

Magic can be quite broken from what I heard but because I found the vendor for it late I probably didn't get the full mage experience and it wasn't broken for my runs so I was forced to rely on melee.

Perhaps its just not my thing, I don't know - I just feel that something like bloodstained would be a better choice :shrug:",1588046570,1588046570,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Its claim to fame is its ""procedurally-assembled areas from hand-crafted rooms"".  I was ready and willing to like this aspect of the game. However, what this really means is that each level is a patched together slog of long rectangles with 3-5 enemies in it, a fork in the road, several dead end rooms with a buff or chest, some environmental hazards, then the boss.  It feels incredibly shallow and not worth ditching an ACTUALLY hand crafted game for.

The combat and movement is clunky and unsatisfying.  You do not have enough options to make regular enemy encounters  interesting, so despite there being 80ish enemies in the game, most of the have similar movesets from level to level.  Even with what is on offer, sometimes I was still asking myself ""how was I supposed to dodge that while still being able to deal damage?"" I know there are those who find this style nostalgic or whatever but honestly it just doest feel fun to play half of the time.  

The upgrades you get fulfulling the ""metroidvania"" part of the game are some of the most boring, worst integrated upgrades ive seen in a game like this.  Almost half of the upgrades are never utilized in more than a few fringe cases, and a quarter of them are completely invalidated by future upgrades.  There isnt a single unique thing to experience in this game in this regard.  I suppose thats the cost of not being able to, again, actually hand craft the levels.

Chasm suffers tremendously from what feels like dozens of oversights which make it a chore to play.  Some enemies's attack animations take way too long to end, resulting in them holding out their weapon waiting for you to walk into it.  Instead of there being a save point in each level's hub, the first level is the only one that has one.  Added to this, the only way to replenish your mana is to make the trek back to the hub town, or by destroying lanterns for 1-3 mana...sometimes.  The loot is baffling, as probably within my first few hours of gameplay I got a legendary leather armor that I never replaced because everything else was worse.  Some pieces have semi interesting effects, but more often than not youll just pick whatever has the highest numbers.  You never get crazy strong so backtracking remains annoying, coupled with enemies that respawn when you exit and reenter a room.  So getting a chest at the end of a gauntlet isnt just a challenge once, but twice.  There are more, but thats enough from me.  

*Edit:  I have 100% completed this game, only missing the 4 rarest achievements.  At the time of writing this original review, I had seen the final boss and decided the game hadnt bought enough good will from me to do what it was asking.  A few days later, I decided to just grit my teeth and finish what I had started.  An hour later after cleaning up some chores, I beat the game.  Afterward I uninstalled, content that after editing this review, I never needed to think about this game again.

If none of what I said bothers you, then youll probably enjoy Chasm.  Its art is pretty good, and despite what Ive said, if youre looking for something to scratch that exploration itch, then this game can certainly try.

Геймплей стандартный, обследование карты, борьба с монстрами, поиск предметов позволяющих пройти дальше.  И вот тут вылезает ряд проблем.
1) Примитивный бой. Обычный удар, удар в прыжке, отскок назад.
2) Оружия вроде бы много но его можно разделить на три вида:Кинжалы(быстрые, но бьют недалеко),мечи(средняя скорость, средняя дальность), тяжёлое оружие(большая область поражения, очень медленная скорость).
3) Прокачка и уровни здесь тоже есть. Но вся суть в том что после набора нужного кол-ва опыта чуть-чуть повышаются статы и восстанавливаются мана и здоровье. 
4) Есть магия но разница в основном во внешнем виде и траектории полёта снаряда. Мана заканчивается очень быстро, а восполнить её можно получив уровень, выбивая по чуть-чуть из разрушаемых предметов или выпив элексир(который нужно купить). 
5) Гринд. Золото, Мана и некоторые предметы нужно выбивать с постоянно возрождающихся монстров. Шанс выпадения зависит от параметра ""удача"" и без увеличения при помощи предметов очень мал. Причём цены довольно высокие и для покупки некоторых вещей придётся попотеть. 
6) Однообразность и затянутость. Перемещаться можно через ""сеть туннелей"" расположенных в определённых местах.  Много времени тратится на беготню по пройденным локациям и битву с монстрами, ""секреты"" не приносят много радости(часто выпадают те же вещи что и с монстров).

O jogo conta com um sistema de magia e ataque, além de armadura, e outros status, como inteligência.

Com gráficos pixelados e em 2D, o jogo é muito bonito. Apresenta vários bosses, mas esse não é o principal do jogo.

Com o tempo, você obtém powerups, habilidades especiais que te ajudam em várias partes, além de melhores equipamentos, melhorias e itens específicos, para missões específicas.

O jogo ainda conta com alguns puzzles, mas eles não são o foco principal do jogo.

Jogo muito recomendado, 90/100.

The artwork is very charming, but beyond the nice visuals it is a bog standard Metroidvania.

I remember when I first heard about Chasm a lot of the hype surrounding the game was tied to the potential of playing through more than once with different map layouts, but honestly by the end of your first playthrough there is no reason to go back. 

Frustratingly, the game has a good amount of backtracking (as one would expect in a metroidvania game) that requires revisiting rooms that have no unique marking on the map, meaning you can waste a lot of time looking for them. The weapons you gain throughout your playthrough are also very bland, there is very little variation to make different builds.

All in all despite the bitching, I'd recommend Chasm if its on sale, if you plan to play on normal, and if you've run out of other Metroidvania games to play.

I have no clue if there will be any DLC for this or not, but with how every run can be randomized, there's room to grow.

Yeah some enemies are a pain and yeah the drops to restore HP are to few, but the game's main problem is It's just... so boring. Like there's some anomaly I can't quite put my finger on that makes it feel like an unexciting slog.

One of my overall favorite genres of games. If you're into them, this is absolutely a solid entry. Can't wait to see what comes next from this dev!

Interesting variety of areas and enemies. Movement abilities get interesting, like clinging to ledges or wall jumping. The game could be a little more heavily populated with enemies in my opinion, I generally like more combat than I'm getting here. The jumping puzzles are really enjoyable though, makes exploration pretty fun.

In addition to melee weapons, you can also build your equipment to focus on sub-weapons, although I haven't seen a decent way to recover mana reliably yet, so it could be an interesting challenge to try a magic build. So far, you get drips of mana from breaking candles. Can I just whine about having to break every candle in this entire genre?

Story isn't bad, but it's nothing exciting either. Essentially, you're on an expedition into the mines, and some townsfolk are trapped inside, and there's something about an ancient civilization, which might lead to a cool ending, here's hoping!

If you have played any of the castlevania titles you will recongnize a lot of things right from the start like the kind of upgrades that you'll get or the weapons and sub-weapons that you'll use.

Chasm main selling point was supposed to be it proceduraly generated world that would give you and unique and inovating experience, but i would said that's the main flaw that this game has. I beated the game twice ( 1st time on HARD mode and the 2nd time on Normal - mortal aka  die once and your save file is gone) and i didn´t notice big changes in the rooms or locations except from some random rearranged rooms. Theres no room or location in the game that will get written for ever in your mind like Hollow Knight's City of Tears or the entrance to Riddley's lair of Super metroid, everything feels a bit simple and uninspiring, in other words, Chasm lacks a sense of identity to make it set apart from other metroidvanias titles.

The story is pretty simple, the OST has some good beats on it but it kinda gets repetitive a bit quickly and the animations and pixel art are (by far one) of the BEST POINTS of this game, it's a pretty good example of a beautifully crafted pixel art.

BUT don´t get me wrong, Chasm is still a pretty fun game to play and if you like this kind of titles give it a try but don´t expect to be mind blown by it.",1583524689,1583526200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

ta gra potrzebuje dobrego słowa. Nie, nie z litości, a dlatego że jest fajna.
Chasm to staroszkolna rpg - metroidvania, która wciąga jak czarna dziura i to jest jej największy plus, podkreślam to bo jest to najważniejsze w tego typu grach i cokolwiek bym nie napisał dalej, to będzie to już tylko dodatek.
Dobry pixel art, tzn postacie i wrogowie są świetni, ale jeśli chodzi o mapy to już poziom bardzo zróżnicowany, od super do smętny. Dobry system walki, oparty częściej o wyczucie odległości ruchów przeciwnika niż strategię, na mój gust zabrakło czegoś dodatkowego typowo na refleks (choć ten element jest w innych aktywnościach gry). Ciekawszych kombinacji z blokami i kontrami itp. tu brak, jednak zróżnicowanie broni to rekompensuje, a opłaca się nie raz przy bossie ją zmieniać, bo ta o najmniejszym zasięgu daje najwięcej obrażeń na sekundę. Nie udało się ciekawie rozwiązać back trackingu, za to spryciarze chcący poexpić znajdą ciekawe miejscówki i za to spory plus.
Pomimo iż gra wciąga to brakuje jej klimatu muzycznego, mimo to daje miłe poczucie powrotu do wioski by przygotować się do kolejnej podróży wgłąb kopalni.
Plusem są różne rodzaje broni, które działają zupełnie inaczej, więc trzeba się ich nauczyć i to na prawdę daje frajdę. Minusem jest jednak brak szczegółów czysto liczbowych (np. damage per second), bo choć zapewniam to nie one by stanowiły o ulubionej taktyce to właśnie dlatego że tak by nie było, to byłyby dobrym dodatkiem.
Zdecydowanie za wolno się rozkręcają niektóre możliwości jak podwójny skok, czy spadochron przedłużający ""wartość"" skoku.
Problem z balansem, z jednej strony Chasm jest dość trudne, z drugiej jeśli pofarmi się kasę i kupi miksturki to zaczyna się ""hulaj dusza, piekła nie ma"". Wolałbym by ów balans argumentów postaci był po stronie skilli (nawet pasywnych) aniżeli chlania zawartości przeźroczystych piersiówek z czerwoną cieczą. Lubię wiśniówkę, jednak smok od nich nie zginie... czy jakoś tak.

Frajda z gry = Chasm, zróżnicowanie gameplaya jest tu choć sztampowe to wystarczające by uznać za atrakcyjne. Szczerze, temat takich gier jest mi obecnie obcy ( a kiedyś miałem NES-a i SNES-a, grało się z Ninja Gajden, Captain America and The Avengers ect.). Od teraz  szukam czegoś podobnego.

Um metroidvania com salas e mapas gerados de forma procedural soam até que interessante, mas no final, acabou destruindo o ponto mais forte dos metroidvanias: a exploração. 

O enredo do jogo é simples e bem raso, apenas apresentando a razão da aventura acontecer. 
O combate do jogo não tem nada de incrível, mas funciona muito bem. Armas com diferentes tipos de golpes, alcances e claro, não podiam faltar as magias: arremessar adagas, machados, poções e até mesmo shurikens. Na prática parece incrível, mas no final, é tudo muito simples e sem graça. 

Ficava ansioso achando que a próxima magia que eu ia comprar seria incrível ou super interessante, mas quando eu descobria como era... acabava sendo frustrante por todo o dinheiro investido nela.

Os inimigos são até que legais, mas o brilho fica mais pros chefões, que tem suas dificuldades, principalmente se você quiser matar eles sem tomar nenhum golpe (fornecendo um equipamento de recompensa, que facilita a jogatina). 

Geralmente após os chefões, você vai encontrar habilidades especiais, que te vão permitir acessar áreas que antes não eram possíveis, o clássico metroidvania... e ai começa o grande problema.

O maior problema desse jogo é o backtracking, ou seja, retornar a lugares que você já passou no jogo, pra descobrir novas áreas e usar suas novas habilidades. Em um jogo onde os mapas são repetitivos pelo fator procedural e com lugares nem um pouco memoráveis, a experiência de backtracking acabou sendo muito frustrante e cansativa. Precisei passar pelas fases, sala por sala, várias e várias vezes, tornando o progresso do jogo tão irritante, tão frustrante, que me fez questionar minha sanidade mental. 

Infelizmente o jogo teria um potencial muito mais bem aproveitado se o mapa fosse feito a mão pelos desenvolvedores, pois essa ideia de criar um jogo único pra cada jogador, acabou criando um jogo chato, repetitivo e irritante. Seus pontos positivos são completamente anulados pelos pontos negativos, e por conta disso, não recomendaria a nenhuma pessoa o jogo.

It focuses on a deliberate (borderline frustrating) play style where you have to pay attention to the enemy's attacks rather than hacking n slashing your way through. I'll argue that this play style becomes annoying when there's so much backtracking and looking-around involved. But maybe that's the vibe the developers were going for; the perilous adventure of combing through a dungeon filled with monsters. (Needs better narrative writing, though. Like this review; too wordy.)

Pros:
- Good music
- Great pixel animation
- Simple and easy enough to play.
- Final boss fight was okay
- Controls feel responsive (when you're not clunkily falling into poison/electric pits) 
- Reminiscent of SotN (Except all the dying)

Cons:
- The narrative, while simple, is tedious to follow. Very text-heavy, and I feel it could've been more concise. Plus, reading through the dialogue won't really give mush (if any) clue as to what you're supposed to be doing, tbh.
- A LOT of backtracking. Which is fine if you've don't have a day job.
- Those little dot's in the map are treasure chests!!!?? I've been running around trying to look for the ones I missed and they're been staring at my face all along!?
- Poor conveyance. You WILL be looking up walkthroughs. 
- Can we please be done with ""enemies damage you even if u brush against they're shoulder"" thing? They have ""Attack"" animations for a reason; to cause damage. What's the point of an attack animation if all they have to do is invade my personal space to kill me? At least lower the damage caused by non-attack contact?
- You'll die A LOT. So much you'll think this is a Salt & Sanctuary sequel.
- Potions are expensive (after you actually unlock the person who sells them to you) + you earn money veeeeery slowly. So you best git gud, or get used to seeing the game over screen.
- Jump+Attack is your go-to mode of attack, since anything else will lock you in place for 5 years and leave you open to attacks (99% of the time)",1582942011,1582942011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Si tras tres horas, un juego de estas características no me dice nada, no puedo recomendarlo. Comenzaba muy prometedor pero conforme vas jugando, se va viniendo abajo.

Chasm es un pequeño metroidvania de libro. De hecho, se juega de forma extremadamente similar a symphony of the night, aria of sorrow o cualquiera de los castlevanias de ds... pero peor. Es extremadamente parecido en su propuesta jugable. ¿El problema? Que los desarrolladores, sean novatos o no, se comportan como si lo fueran. Me explico.

No tienen coraje ninguno. Son unos cobardes con respecto al diseño del juego, lo que se manifiesta tanto en la jugabilidad como en el diseño artístico. No hablo aquí de presupuestos o potencia gráfica. Estos tíos tienen un arte de píxel bastante avanzado pero completamente desaprovechado. Si queréis que emplee una terminología menos hiriente, a estos chicos les falta ambición.

Se nota en todos los detalles, que hay muchos porque además duele lo detallistas que son los desarrolladores. Se lo curran, pero entienden todo mal. Por ejemplo, quieren hacer una mazmorra que parezca infinita, laberíntica, sin fondo. Muy bien. ¿Por qué todo parece una mina rústica? ¿No tendrías que haber creado un par de paletas diferentes, distintos tipos de roca, algo que rompa la monotonía del paisaje? Siento que todas las salas son iguales, aunque propongan puzles (sencillos) diferentes. Ellos creen que están siendo consistentes pero no, están siendo repetitivos. Haz la mazmorra más corta o fragméntala en áreas más pequeñas que ofrezcan un cambio en las vistas al jugador, Blasphemous lo hace, Hollow Knight lo hace, todos los que tienen dos dedos de frente lo hacen. He jugado metroidvanias de presupuesto cercano a cero que conseguían aportar algo más de variedad en las primeras horas de juego.

Y echan sal en la herida: Ves a tu personaje viajar por tierras hermosas, valles, montañas, y estás deseando explorar... para que en cuanto llegas a tu destino, te metan en una mina no sé cuántas horas. Eh... ¿qué? ¿Por qué? ¿Por qué no estoy explorando un sitio hermoso y fascinante si me has enseñado que sabes hacerlos? 

Otro ejemplo de diseño equivocado: Las zonas de guardado. En los metroidvanias vais a pasar mucho tiempo en zonas de guardado, porque intentaréis visitarlos con frecuencia. Normalmente se intenta que sean lugares llamativos, fascinantes, estéticamente diferentes. Aquí también lo intentan: Es una estatua de un viejo con un candil. En serio. Le intentan insuflar un aire místico con el lore pero es un viejo con un candil. Y de diseño bastante simplón y cuadrado. Parecen tonterías pero ahora voy con una que afecta al gameplay.

En casi todos estos juegos empiezas con armas débiles. Pero enseguida encuentras armas que molan, que da gusto utilizar, o habilidades que compensan un arma rústica. Generalmente sucede en los primeros 10 o 20 minutos. Aquí el segundo arma que consigues es un cuchillo... tras un par de horas de juego... que es mejor que tu espada corta en estadísticas, significativamente para ese momento del juego, pero que da asco usar porque no tiene alcance. Te están proponiendo un dilema clásico de los castlevanias pero en los castlevanias no se hace tan pronto, primero te dejan degustar la satisfacción de armas divertidas, con alcance, que permitan combar o semejante. Luego te darás cuenta de que son débiles y las cambiarás por otras. Lo cuál suele ser fácil porque suele haber armas a porrillo. Aquí, no. Aquí puedes pasar una hora entre que consigues un arma y la siguiente.

Y los puntos de guardado. Veréis, cuando tenéis que jugar con un arma cutre en un juego de estas características, con poco alcance, débil, etc., durante mucho tiempo, vais a sufrir daño. Es inevitable. Cualquier enemigo que haga algo más que quedarse quieto esperando morir te puede acabar hiriendo. De forma que aumentan la dificultad del juego dándote enemigos débiles pero un arma más débil todavía. Lo guay de los castlevanias es sentirte fuerte. Aquí te ves calculando las distancias a la perfección contra un puñetero murciélago o una rata porque cuidado como sufras daño, estás apañado. Ya que otra cosa que al cabo de un tiempo empiezan a hacer es distanciar bastante los puntos de guardado. No siempre están en lugares lógicos. Atraviesas un área grande, esperas un punto de guardado... pues no.

El aspecto rolero más básico también se cae. Subes tres, cuatro niveles, y no notas ninguna diferencia. No ves cambiar las tornas. Las subidas de nivel son casi irrelevantes.

En conclusión: Pasas sala tras sala idéntica una tras otra, con enemigos patéticos pero que te suponen una amenaza porque tienes que jugar con un arma patética. Una hora... dos horas... tres horas... tres horas y media... y en ese punto te preguntas, ¿por qué estoy jugando esto pudiendo jugar un juego mejor? 

Pregúntatelo tú también. Hollow Knight, Blasphemous, Bloodstained, incluso Mirror of fate, siendo un cutre port de 3ds es mejor que esto.

Por poner algo positivo, voy a estar muy atento a más juegos de estos chicos porque tienen potencial. Chasm tiene potencial, no es un absoluto desastre. Si le echan un par de... narices (pegi 10), el siguiente juego puede ser muy bueno. Pero tienen que dejar de asumir que por ser un juego de bajo presupuesto se pueden permitir apuntar al barro. Tienen que aspirar a algo más. Hay talento aquí, falta la ambición.",1582754912,1582755285,False,13,3,0.522311925888061523,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Chasm is one of those Metroidvania games that does not push the genre towards any new revolutionary direction. Combat involves repeatedly hitting enemies until they fall, once you've learnt their attack patterns of course. I usually put down any game that forces a hard difficulty for the sake of it and I was close in this game a few times but eventually it clicked and the game was somewhat enjoyable. A general lack of checkpoints in-between lengthy areas was rather painful.

Having played enough Hollow Knight, this doesn't compare to that quality but it has its own place in the genre. I got the game in the last Humble Monthly so value-wise, I got my money’s worth here with a combined playtime of about 24 hours.

There are six biomes to explore in the game, starting with the Mines and there's a linear path to take from therein. The game imposes this by locking away basic functions such as sliding under small crevices, double jump, wall jump etc. If you've played Dead Cells this might be a bit off-putting but it's just how it is and you get used to it.

The maps are generated procedurally with a seed system which you can note down to use for multi-runs but areas themselves tend to repeat themselves in later playthroughs as the general structure seems to be the same, just rooms swapped around. Puzzles are still randomly generated though and for a first playthrough, they seem to have been done well. Expect a lot of backtracking.

Gauntlets can be frustrating in other games but the most challenging rooms in Chasm are child's play compared to Hollow Knight and I'm relieved somewhat because I just wanted an easier time with a game for once. Rescuing the townsfolk slowly and rebuilding the town was a good way to take a break in-between the ""chasm runs"" - just wish there was to do in the town itself as it never really felt alive as much as it should have been.

Chasm excels in other areas such as ambience and general BGM but it suffers in how effective a lot of the weapons are. 

Whips and short-swords are great but daggers require you to almost touch the enemy and the heavy weapons are too slow to use - maybe intentional by design but it is impractical in this game as there is no way to block.

Magic skills are varied enough to switch out but pausing and unpausing just makes it not worth the effort. I stuck to Throwing Daggers most of the time, sometimes the Throwing Axe for the boss fights but rarely used it other than to clear off enemies standing on the edge of ledges blocking the path ahead - you get knocked back if you touch them. 

Equipment has its own RNG element and you can get marginally better drops in chests and off monster loot. Each area has its own boss to face and a mini-boss too and it takes about 12 hours going at a leisurely pace to finish it (on Easy). 

I played through the game three times to get 100% and thoroughly enjoyed it but I would only recommend this on a heavy discount or as part of a games bundle.",1582671125,1582671155,True,1,0,0.446702778339385986,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Esta reseña no contiene spoilers[/h1]

Chasm es un juego que me ha gustado bastante, básicamente porque me ha ofrecido aquello que andaba buscando. No es el mejor metroidvania que vas a encontrar, y no llega al nivel o complejidad de otros como Hollow Knight, Axion Verge o similares.

Sin embargo, ofrece bastante entretenimiento y diversión con un acabado gráfico bastante bueno, sobre todo si se usa el filtro CRT, que le da ese aspecto de juego de épocas pasadas que tanto nos hicieron disfrutar.

En el juego controlaremos a un soldado cadete del imperio de Guildea que marcha a un pequeño pueblecito minero para descubrir qué sucede en el lugar y hacer frente a un mal que parece estar abriéndose paso a través de las minas.

El argumento no es demasiado original, pero tampoco importa demasiado, porque lo que hace lo hace muy bien. El juego posee abundante lore sobre los hechos que han sucedido en la zona, a través de manuscritos o libros que iremos encontrando en las entrañas de la mina.

A su vez, podremos realizar determinadas misiones secundarias en aras de ayudar al denostado pueblo. No son muy numerosas, pero cumplen perfectamente dentro de la globalidad de la experiencia jugable.

Como todo buen metroidvania que se precie, el juego está lleno de estancias y lugares por descubrir, con diferentes zonas muy bien diferenciadas unas de otras y con algunos puzles que aun no siendo difíciles, sí que amenizan y enriquecen bastante la experiencia.

Además, contaremos con un elenco de armas bastante numeroso, así como una ingente cantidad de enemigos diferentes a los que enfrentarnos, casi 100, que no es poco y habilidades por desbloquear al encontrar los objetos pertinentes.

Los enemigos serán bastante variados, aunque en pocas ocasiones nos sorprenderemos por sus diseños artísticos. Sin embargo, y una vez más, no es necesario. Trols, arañas, brujas, kobols y un largo etcétera poblarán las diferentes zonas del juego, así como jefes finales y sub-jefes.

Esto ha sido especialmente criticado en el juego, su falta de “originalidad” pero es algo que no llego a comprender del todo. Los enemigos están muy bien representados y cumplen perfectamente con su función. No son tan originales como los que encontramos en Hollow Knight, cierto, ¿y qué? Están bien realizados y representan perfectamente un mundo lleno de bestias y enemigos.

Hay que destacar en este aspecto que las animaciones, tanto del personaje principal como del resto de personajes y enemigos del juego, están muy bien realizadas. Las animaciones son muy suaves y se ve que se han esforzado bastante en ofrecer una experiencia bastante profesional en todo momento.

Esto es así especialmente con nuestro héroe. Ya sea corriendo, saltando, atacando, agarrándonos a cornisas o dando volteretas en el aire. Todo está perfectamente implementado dentro del juego.

El mando responde perfectamente a todas y cada una de las órdenes que demos, pero no es un machaca-botones. El personaje al atacar efectuará un golpe y si fallamos tendrá que recuperarse un breve momento antes de poder atacar nuevamente. A mí me parece un sistema bastante lógico, y además provoca que no vayamos atacando así a lo loco.

El juego como tal no es que sea especialmente difícil. Yo me lo pasé en “difícil” y morí una barbaridad de veces, pero nunca tuve la sensación de que el juego estuviera siendo injusto conmigo, ni mucho menos. Aunque supongo que en la dificultad “normal” el juego puede llegar a ser un paseo.

En lo tocante a su aspecto sonoro, el juego muestra unas melodías bastante entretenidas y que amenizan bastante la experiencia. No son muy numerosas, pero las que hay cumplen perfectamente con su función.

En lo referente a su traducción al español, la tienda indica que el juego está en “Español de Hispanoamérica” pero realmente esto no es así. Después de haberlo pasado de cabo a rabo, y haber leído decenas y decenas de conversaciones en el juego, puedo afirmar sin ninguna duda que el texto está en “Español de España” al 100%.

No hay ni un solo modismo, ni una sola expresión o atisbo de utilización de español de Hispanoamérica en ningún momento. Además, no hay faltas de ortografía de ninguna clase. Algo que desgraciadamente suele ser muy habitual en estos casos. 

Puede parecer raro, ya que la traducción es de México según parece. Así que mi duda realmente después de jugar este juego es si las buenas traducciones de “Español de Hispanoamérica” son cuando quedan como una de “Español de España” habitual que todos conocemos. Sí es así, bienvenidas sean. Aunque desgraciadamente esto no suele ser la norma.

En definitiva, Chasm es un metroidvania realmente entretenido, con bastantes retos que superar y misterios por descubrir.

While I did finish the game, I enjoyed far less of it than I thought I would.

I (as I imagine most people) was drawn to this game by its art style and the fact it was another metroidvania. However, once you get past the scripted and story driven intro section (which is great mind you), what remains afterwards is a set of poorly generated levels filled with bad pacing. It could have been caused by a bad seed, but therein lies the issue so your mileage may vary.

The game borrows a lot from Castlevania (weapons, spells, combat, exploration), however it doesn't do enough to set itself apart. The ""thing"" in Chasm is the procedurally generated levels. 
I experienced bland and uninspired rooms and corridors repeating all too often. Because so much effort went into this concept, it feels very little went in the way of actual pacing. Weapon variety is low, it's possible to get the best weapons within a few hours of play, there are only 6 spells, the grind to level up spikes up around the mid-30's so it doesn't even make sense to do that either. 

If you came here looking for another Hollow Knight or even Axiom Verge, then this isn't it. What this is however, is a castlevania-light with procedurally generated levels that you can experience in a bite sized 10 hours.

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*]Art style - stellar work on that end.
[*]Plays like castlevania right down to how combat is executed.
[*]Another metroidvania!
[*]Chiptune soundtrack (overall a very low variety of music however).
[/list]

[b]The Bad:[/b]
[list]
[*]Pacing and progression seems at odds with itself. What I thought was just a side activity ([spoiler]Arena[/spoiler]) and ignored it for most of the game, ended up being a major arc to acquire a new artifact ([spoiler]diving gear[/spoiler]). However the areas I now had access to and the rewards I received were not worth the effort. It doesn't make sense. The whole [spoiler]sight[/spoiler] potion and two [spoiler]invisible[/spoiler] chests is another one, there's just no direction or purpose for it all to even be there, no story behind it, glimmer of its capabilities or other purposes, it's just there and once you get it done you'll never use that potion ever again.
[*]There was far more platforming than actual metroidvania-ing. Huge sections felt like playing Super Mario Bros.
[*]The menu/inventory is poorly implemented - no filter to sort weapons.
[*]Badly located save points.
[/list]

[b]To the Dev - great job on the game. I can see you're still actively updating the game so to that end:[/b]
[list]
[*]I know it's a big ask/recommendation, but the sequence and progression of artifacts to the areas you gain access to, the risk/time vs reward is poorly designed. I feel that re-evaluating either the order you get the items in or simply design the levels in such a way that there are more areas to use them in (water sections, slow potion etc) would not only create more uses for some of these items but also flesh out the game world a bit.
[*]Why give the player a special item to dig up dirt, but then force them to navigate the poorly designed inventory just to equip it for a few seconds and then back to their main weapon? Allow using it without having to equip it.
[*]Grant the ability to sort our equipment by strength, intelligence... anything. Searching for the best weapon/armour while they're hidden amongst trash loot is no ones idea of a good time. Trash loot can be sold, sure, but then we'd have to navigate each item one by one in order to see their stats, price alone shouldn't be what determines the 'value' of an item.
[*]More on the above point, why do we have to click into an item to see its stats? Why force a player to select an item to see how much it heals them? It just feels like there's always one too many clicks to get something done.
[*]Please don't waste a players time. You could introduce a checkpoint save system or better save/gateway locations. For instance, why place a save point only in the mines portal zone and not any of the others? It's as if you want to penalise the player for wanting to save by forcing them to go through those extra couple of zones just to save.
[*]Allow us to use the parachute several times during one fall. Increase it's utility for some quality of life fun - it won't ever get used once the feathered shoes are unlocked.
[*]If you're going to be inspired by castlevania right down to the movement style - a small suggestion is to stop mana drops from lanterns once mana is full, it's a redundant pickup. Instead provide more low-tier money drops if MP is full.

If you enjoy it, there is some amount of replayability but a 100% 'normal' playthrough took about 12 hours.

I don’t really have many complaints about the game; controls are solid, atmosphere is good, traveling around the world was quick and accessible, the RPG elements were effective without being grindy, variety of equipment was good, etc.

My only two niggles with the game were that some of the items needed to unlock other items were too long an arc for too little of a reward; things like getting the light sword was a bit of a disappointment for how much work you had to do to get it and how the water relic was used in two places to get two items and that was literally it. Maybe this was just what my seed did and other seeds would have better pathing or more interesting uses for some of the relics but my experience was less than ideal in these circumstances.

My other issue was that most of the relics give you a small boost and allow you to do new and interesting things to reach new areas and traverse the world in different ways right up until you get the feather boots (vague non-spoilery terms used on purpose). The boots are a huge game changer in the way you move around the world- too huge really. The options you have once you acquire them are required for you to have access to with the way the game is built of course, but the power increase that this one relic gives you feels very unbalanced next to everything else the game provides. It also almost completely invalidates one of your previous relics (almost). I would have rather had some of the 'power' if this relic infused into others to balance out the gains and make those, shall we say, less useful relics more interesting.

With that said, I still 100% recommend the game to anyone who likes the genre. At the time of posting, there are 'mixed' reviews on Steam and I don’t really understand why. I see a lot of people saying it's as 'a worse version of SOTN' and while even my rose tinted glasses feel like SOTN was ""better"" than Chasm, there is still nothing wrong with this game. If you liked SOTN, this is a great love letter to enjoy.

但是，游戏的一些瑕疵，也慢慢随着游戏的进度深入而变得明显起来。

首先我可以理解在街机模式里面安排种子来加强随机性，但是给故事模式也安排种子是个什么鬼？首先，这游戏的故事模式一周目起码要20h，我相信没有人闲着无聊一次又一次的玩儿故事模式吧。而且就算重新开始故事模式，我相信游戏的流程并不会改变，还是要挨个解救村民，解锁道具，只不过这些东西在地图上的位置变了而已。官方解释是说：加入种子是让你和你的好朋友在相同的世界里面玩耍。又不是上个世纪的游戏社交，不能线上合作搞个相同地图，难道还想让玩家在线下交流心得不成？

武器的优劣性十分明显。双手武器的跳砍和小皮鞭是这个游戏里最强的两大武器，别看那把只有一个像素厚的单手剑了兄弟，就算你挥地再快，它始终是根针。

人物和武器的属性很单一，完全可以不用任何魔法道具无脑堆物理攻击来通关游戏。武器造型那么多样，结果还不是拿到更好的就把旧的卖了，只能体验到武器性能的单一升级，没有任何武器的多元化。

更不用说后期解锁了连连看和老虎机无限刷钱之后，打boss只是个时间问题了。玩家心里想的只是快点让游戏结束，而体验不到击败boss的成就感了。

总体而言，若是有时间空余，还是值得一试的。

Most of the people who don't recommend this are saying two things.

1. The game is a lot like Castlevania or other Metroidvania games. 

2. The game doesn't have enough save points.

And I agree with both of those opinions. I've never played Castlevaina, but I have played Hollow Knight, which is one of my all time favorite games. Right off the bat, as soon as I was in the mines I could see a lot of similarities between the two games, from the enemies to the landscape, it looked very similar. What I think happened is that Chasm drew a lot of inspiration from other Metroidvania games, but so much so that it looks like the Devs just copied a bunch of different games and rolled them all into one to create Chasm. There is a lot of room for originality and it doesn't look like there will be too much of it. 

As for the save points, yeah, I wish there were more. This is a mildly difficult game, and it's a real pain to have to go back so far when you die. But, in a lot of cases, there are save points nearby. It's often times a matter of choosing right over left. So, instead of making more save points, I wish there was some kind of marker or sign that lead you to save points nearby. 

The only other problem that I have with this game is that if you want to equip or use an item, or if you want to check the map, you have to pause the game and navigate to what you want from the pause menu. That is kind of a pain, and I think it would be much easier if you could bring up the options in game. Like, lets just say you could press 'M' for the map, 'E' for Equip and 'I' for inventory, or use tab or something, that would just make it a bit more convenient. 

All of that being said, I still do recommend this. It's not the best game in the world, but it's fun, and it's good if you are bored.",1581805584,1581805584,True,8,1,0.607601165771484375,0,False,True,False,False,,,

So long that I actually forgot it existed until I was surprised to see it up for sale one day. I went ahead and bought it, as it had a lot of what I enjoy. I love sprite-based games, and am a huge fan of metroidvania-style games. As others pointed out, this game doesn't do anything innovative, but for me that wasn't a concern. If it played closely to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, I'd be happy; and for the most part it does! However, there is one major thing that gives this a ""no"" from me. Following are my pros and cons, mostly cons, sadly:

1. The biggest thing is that this game is poorly optimized. It's programmed in XNA, and I don't know much about that framework, but I've never had a 2D sprite-based game drop frames like this game. And keep in mind, it isn't my system. I JUST finished playing and reviewing Doom 2016, and I played that game on Ultra settings without losing frames (with two minor instances). Not only does this game stutter, but actually, as of now, it's been rendered unplayable. I cannot open the game without it stuttering to the main screen, and even then it takes several minutes to get there. I had to fully reboot to get it to load properly, and it played well for another 10 minutes before the slowdown happened again and I'm not going to keep rebooting my computer to play this game that I had already grown bored of. 
2. The story isn't interesting enough to keep me invested in playing on to see what happens. Normally I wouldn't care about the story if the gameplay was fun, and while there isn't anything necessarily wrong with it, your character just isn't as acrobatic as Alucard or other metroidvania characters are. It makes the backtracking absolutely annoying. Your character is slow, and the artifacts you get to add to your moveset are also slow. Samus Aran you are not. At all. I was super excited when I initially got the slide, thinking I could finally zip through the levels and get the ball rolling, but there is such a long delay between your movesets, it just isn't fun to me. If this was supposed to be more realistic, like Salt & Sanctuary, that'd be fine, but it isn't. 
3. The music is virtually non-existent and unmemorable. 
4. Combat gets old fairly fast. I will say that, one problem I had with Castlevania SOTN was that, it too, got old regarding combat, but at least in that game  you had a lot of options to ignore or tear through enemies as you advanced in power. I could transform into a wolf and just zip right through them. However, in Chasm, I can Megaman-slide and then wait a solid 3-4 seconds before I can slide again. 

I legit feel bad writing this review because I'd hate to put in so much work in a game to have some idiot whose probably never created anything shit on it after just a few hours. There is a lot of potential here! The artwork is absolutely beautiful, and I love the pixel art. There are unique weapon animations for each weapon type, and I may not have given it a ""No"" if this were just a generic SOTN clone, but the performance issues I had make this a solid ""No"" for me. If there are future updates, or a DLC, or even a sequel, I will certainly be checking it out, because I think this is a great, responsive developer, but I can't say yes to a game I can't get to perform correctly when I can play Triple A games on their highest settings without issues. 

I WILL check back from time-to-time and change my rating should this issue be addressed. I want this developer to do well, and wish him the best.",1581285135,1581285135,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1] 《深渊矿坑》（《chasm》）的不靠谱初见评测[/h1]
游戏没有玩过多少，仅仅打完第一个boss，不知为什么，没什么耐心玩一下。
游戏缺少让我眼前一亮的“灵魂”。
一款游戏的灵魂到底是什么？玩法？剧情？画风？Bgm?打击感?角色？
是，也不全是，有，也不全有。
这款游戏让我感觉玩家只是来做任务的，而不是游戏中的一份子。
就像那一个个怪物，军中的npc，我只感觉到他们的数据，却没有感到他们的灵魂。
当我杀死怪物的时候，我没有感到角色的变强，只是木然看着怪物死去消失。
进入游戏，我是一个新兵，要去一个矿石镇，解决那里出现的怪物。
我深入矿洞，发现游戏不是那么简单。
1.打击感一般，只能说一般，打怪，掉血，哦，没了。
2.剧情看得出来精心设计过，有很多文字记载的细节来充实整个世界观，但没有吸引我看下去，反而看着汉化的文本头疼。
3.说到汉化，网上下了个汉化文本，勉强能看，但体验不太好。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992971908 
4.比较糟心的地方就是，平台跳跃的某些地方，会被怪堵着，我跳上去受到伤害会硬直往后倒，导致有部分地方跳得很累。
5.武器系统，对比1，换什么武器都没有酷炫的打击感，让我体会不到爽快，私以为这类杀怪游戏在杀怪方面应该让人更爽一点？目前玩了两种武器，大棒和剑，他们的后摇貌似都有点长，让我不是很喜欢，感觉不是很cool。
6.怪物设计方面，史莱姆，哥布林，大老鼠，都是很传统的怪，毕竟一个矿洞，考虑实际情况也不会有那些骇人的怪了。

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992972032 
7.平台跳跃方面，一般，不难，大概也是因为我没打到后面，没有刺激感。
8.画风方面，像素风虽复古，但同时也失去了特色，如果没有一定内容的支持，很难在一众游戏中脱颖而出。
综合评价 7/10分
[h1]总结 [/h1]
《chasm》总体而言是一款中规中矩的游戏，作为一款类银河恶魔城像素游戏，在动作打击感、怪物设计、叙事等方面都显得中规中矩，没能超出同类型游戏，导致玩起来游戏新鲜感和冒险的刺激感都稍有缺失，喜欢类银河恶魔城的玩家可以尝试之后再做出自己的评价。",1581251603,1581251603,True,1,0,0.526066362857818604,0,False,True,False,False,,,

The platforming is ok. But the game is completely ruined by its bad combat and terrible progression/saving system. 
The weapons, at least the ones available in the early game, all feel terrible to use. Each weapon has something different it's good at, but that's because it is garbage at everything else. For example, the knife has good damage and mobility, but extremely low range, requiring you to stand right beside the enemy - which means that it will move into you while you can't move. Because you can't move while using a weapon. The club, on the other hand, has good range and even attacks things above you (good against flying enemies), but has an extremely long swinging animation, during which you can't move, so anything that isn't one-shot by it will damage you. Compounding these issues is the bad enemy placement. Sometimes an enemy will hang out on a ledge that you need to jump on. You can't damage the enemy without jumping on that platform, but every time you try it just knocks you back off.
This by itself would still be tolerable, after the first one or two times you die to each enemy you figure out the timing and tricks to defeat it, but it is completely unacceptable coupled with its other major defect: every time you die you lose all progress since the last time you saved. Checkpoints are very sparse and in non-obvious locations, so sometimes you can even pass them by completely. There is no way to regenerate health except at checkpoints so every hit an enemy gets in on you counts down to your doom and if you don't find the next checkpoint in time you have to do it all over again. You can't even go back to the last checkpoint because all enemies respawn as soon as you leave the screen, so going back is just as dangerous as going forward. There are destroyable lanterns all over the place, but they drop mana, not health, for which I still haven't found any use. Presumably I'll be able to use spells later. After a while you unlock the potion shop which can sell health potions, but that doesn't solve the problem because they're very expensive and you only get a little bit of gold sometimes when you kill an enemy. The rate at which I was dealt damage by enemies is greater than the rate at which I got money equivalent to the same amount of health.
As if having to replay large parts of the map when you die wasn't enough, I kept coming across chests blocked by obstacles I didn't have the ability to remove yet (large jumps, not-yet-breakable walls/floors), clearly indicating that I'd have to redo that entire area later when I got those abilities.
I ragequit multiple times after the game forced me to redo large sections of the game, but I resolved to come back multiple times because the great art and music and interesting lore really made me want to give it a chance. I was always hoping that maybe I'd find that spell which let me regenerate health, but I never did. I won't try anymore though. The straw that broke this camel's back is when I died for the last time: I was two rooms past the last checkpoint when I noticed that I didn't actually save there: I entered the warp hub, but didn't remember that I'd also have to warp back to the warp hub of the previous world and from there get to the checkpoint to save before going back through both warp hubs into the part of the game that isn't just mind-numbing (and slow) walking back and forth. I had just fought against a new kind of enemy, whose patterns I didn't know, so my health was at a bit less than 1/2 of the maximum. Unfortunately, those two rooms were chock full of enemies. I tried to avoid fighting them by jumping over them and running away, but one still managed to land a hit on me. I was half a screen away from the end of the second room when I was boxed in between two ranged enemies (boomerang-throwing skeletons) and two short-range/melee hybrids (spitting and dashing snakes). I died in two hits. I lost ~20 minutes of work. The game didn't even have the decency of respawning me at the checkpoint, it put me into the main menu for some stupid reason.

narrative: good.

If you like the Metroidvania genre, than this is a nice short excursion.

Pros:
-Good graphics, a lot of detail in the sprites and the backgrounds look nice.
-Diablo inspired (probably) loot system means that enemy drops can have additional stat boosts or effects. This is nice and probably the most original aspect of this game. I don't think any other metroidvania has done this.
-Bosses are fun to fight, and sub bosses keep you on your toes.
-Shortcuts are frequent, which makes backtracking and getting back to town easy. It's nice.

Cons:
-Music, while not bad, is very forgettable. It aims for ambiance, which suits the style of the game well, but besides the Mines theme it's barely noticeable and might as well not be there. There's a lot of potential for the composer, try different styles!
-Getting lost in this genre is common, but for how short the game is I felt lost for way too much of it.
-Not much originality. It's hard to be innovative in this genre for sure, but with a few exceptions like the loot modifier system, it's all stuff you've seen before. Almost every powerup is predictable the second you see an obstacle you can't get around yet.

There are so many detractors throughout the game be prepared to be mired down in mediocre. 

[strike]1) The game completely fails to explain what each character stat attribute does. This is passable to veteran gamers but less experienced players will be dumbfounded. It’s obvious this game takes inspiration from the NES 8-bit titles but those games came with a manual to explain any nuance. A trip to the discussions will get you a vague understanding.[/strike] Looks like there is a steam manual these days and the stats are explained inside.

2) Procedural generated dungeon hype. The whole concept is wasted as there just is so little reason to replay again; especially if you picked hard difficulty the first time. And even so the procedural generation just doesn't affect the game play enough at its foundation. 

3) Combat does not have a fluid feeling due to the design decision to lock the character into an action for a bit after taking it. In addition the complete lack of reach on some of the weapons is absolutely laughable; can just toss those dagger-type weapons straight in the bin. 

4) Monster drops are far too infrequent; even with a luck boosting scroll it could easily take 50 kills or more to get both item drops.  

Art, music and novelty of initial the vision save it from being a complete train wreck. Unless you are obsessed with metroidvanias I wouldn’t be in any rush to play this one.

Combat is often very confining, with low ceilings, narrow platforms, and very short attack ranges. There's also a bit too much filler between the interesting bits. Lots of backtracking through the recycled content. Add to this the amount of attacks it takes to kill enemies and that they respawn each time you enter those rooms and it's just a painful slog.

As Metroidvanias go, the /mechanics/ are tight - combat and movement usually feel pretty decent, with a couple of quibbles for a few rooms. Equipment feels SotN-like, with items often hiding special effects that you have to discover by use.

The random generation is a nice thought, but the game's gating is strongly linear, and items generally seem to end up in the same regions, so it's at most an aesthetic difference which rooms connect which major points each time. Don't go in expecting a roguelike either - the map generates once when you start a given savefile, and doesn't randomize on death.

The art is quite pretty pixelwork, but the designs of most zones aren't distinct enough to make the enemies truly shine.

All-in-all, it's a solid platformer, with a modicum of replayability if you really feel like being a maximal item completionist, or hitting up the highest difficulty, or trying a different class. As it stands, I'm satisfied with the 10-hour playthrough on regular, and have no inclination to return for more - I feel as if I've mastered the game sufficiently that just adding more health / damage to push through wouldn't be all that much more fun.",1579586416,1579586416,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[list][*]The static graphics are great. It's interesting that there is an optional CRT mode.
[*]The audio is great. It's interesting that there is a chiptune-stylized alt for each track.
[*]There are daily and weekly high-score-focused time attack modes for those who don't care about the story mode, which is cool, and they're currently active with lots of players.
[/list]
The bad:
[list][*]I don't know why my character looks so angry all of the time. I'm not sure of the design choice that went into this, but it actually annoys me a bit.
[*]I don't understand how I can logically put on two Leather Belts simultaneously as accessories ACC 1 and ACC 2.
[*]There is no explanation of anything for the two-story house at the beginning. At least putting up a sign or something to let early-game players know that it should be populated or something would help them not waste time... 🙄
[*]Note that I said above that the [i]static[/i] graphics are great. However, the motion blur that your character constantly exhibits is terrible, and there is no way to disable it in the game options.
[*]Map color is not distinct enough with regards to holes. There is also no way to mark ""tiles to remember"" if you see a region of the map that clearly requires a specific skill or tool that you don't yet have, so if it's been a while since you last played, you may end up wasting time revisiting that part if you forgot.
[*]Inertia is not properly rendered on moving platforms. If you jump onto a moving platform right as it's about to pull away from the direction in which you approach it, and then you move back in said direction, you whoosh right off of it, even though you should have begun to accumulate momentum towards the opposite direction already.
[*]Why don't the spike traps trigger when an enemy steps on them?! (Egyptian zombies, I'm looking at you...)
[*]Basic UI problems involving custom keyboard shortcuts: https://imgur.com/a/O6auMG8 (I'm not sure of why the entire screen is darkened; my screenshot program must be incompatible with the way Chasm handles full-screen resolution)
[*]I'm just not convinced of how fair it is to put healing stations increasingly so far away from each other, with the only other options when you're low on health being either to spend a truckload of money on Warp Scrolls to return to the town-of-a-main-hub, or risk regaining health by consuming extremely rare food items that seem to come more from pots than ever from any enemies. Granted, I only reached the second dungeon thus far, but even so, in Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, etc., you don't have this kind of highly specific, ""ugh""-fueled tension from risk of death due to injuries from easy mistakes, because enemies in [i]those[/i] games can heal you fairly easily. From what I could gather in Chasm, there wasn't even a magic spell that could perform self-healing (even when mana is gathered at a snail's pace, itself). Granted, I didn't get the witch doctor her Book of Incantations or whatever, but it sure seemed more-than-a-bit discouraging.
[*]Speaking of those spells, it was sort of a blind man's game to try to decide on what magical skills to buy next. The descriptions were so vague that you weren't even informed that magic axes are gravity-influenced while other magical weapons are not. Even the ""shield"" is offensive, not defensive. Some type of brief, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/893180/Catherine_Classic/]Catherine[/url]-like animated GIFs previewing what each one does would be way fairer to early-game players wary of paying so relatively much for things that do what they're not even sure of.
[/list]
And the ugly:
[list][*]You lose 100% of all control of the character when you take a swing of any weapon at an enemy while you're on foot, even if you were running forward at the time of the swing. Your character unrealistically just grinds to an instant halt, and stands still while swinging. You can't even interrupt the attack to defend if you change your mind or see that your foe will beat you to it, timing-wise. I understand that this won't be fixed at all because the dev wants people to memorize and master specific enemies' attack patterns to time their usage of the game's [i]really[/i] awkward backwards-dash feature. I get it; it's a design decision, which probably makes it easier to animate the protagonist. This is also why games like Hollow Knight and any Metroid title will stay ahead of the pack in this genre.
[*]Even if character control was not an issue, here is actually my biggest pet peeve: the level design feels like it ""tried"" to be a roguelike, but excellent roguelikes don't feel like they tried. One with superb level generation should feel totally organic. I got very annoyed when passing through the second dungeon (Egyptian-like catacombs, complete with zombies and venom-spitting snakes), because I came across multiple rooms that were very close together that followed an almost identical structure of a reverse Z shape (you have to travel to one side, hop backwards the other way across a series of hanging platforms above the ground, and then traverse yet a third tier of suspended terrain above both of those). So I was, like... ""All right, I can feel the dev put every square meticulously together,"" because spaces were well placed for jumps. But... it's unimpressive if a relative [i]lot[/i] of tiles on the map follow an exact upside-down ""U"" shape, and so on. Like, the reverse-Z-shaped rooms were never even in reverse order. It was [i]always[/i], so far, an opening in the bottom-left, and then one opening on each upper side.

For another example: in the previous dungeon, the caverns, there were multiple tiles on the map that followed exactly the same structure: pools of acid with oscillating floating blocks of always two pools with two blocks each, or a larger pool with three blocks. There was never, like, a pond with one block and then two, or a short wall to surmount, or something. Essentially, there should have been five times as much level variation, or else Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, etc. win with their handcrafted asymmetrical, interesting, never-repeating layouts.[/list]",1579575877,1579575935,False,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

I avoided buying this because of the earlier reviews but after seeing the last round of updates I thought I'd try it out. I am glad I did.  Overall it was a fun albeit short game and there were no real hiccups along the way.  

Game play: It's very much cut from the same cloth as SOTN/Bloodstained. You'll be constantly on the lookout for better items. Due to it being shorter than the previously mentioned other games I found it to be a lot less grind focused than they were. There is SOME grinding but I never felt that it took up enough of my overall experience to give it much notice. (These were mostly situations where I would find a monster that gives a lot of XP near the edge of a screen and would take advantage of that to level up once or twice and then move on. That happened maybe three times at most not including an NPC sidequest.)

You will do a lot of back tracking as its a Metroidvania type game.  You will battle your way through long stretches to get items that aren't what you need or are less powerful than what you currently have but you can sell them to aid you in finding something more to your liking.  This brings up a kind of short cumming of the game - I never felt there was enough divergence between options for your character (spells, weapons, ect.) to make for anything much more than the swordsman you start out as in the game. Even with projectile spells you're going to stay the dedicated swordsman.

Map:  The biggest worry for me was that the procedurally generated map wouldn't 'unfold' properly and thus would leave me unable to complete the game (or leave me with some unplayable map layout that would ruin the experience.) Well it never happened for me. The map was fine as far as I was concerned and I got the hang of it in about the same amount of time I would have with any other Metroidvania.  

The areas were different enough to provide incrementally difficult platform jumping and the monsters became more complex the deeper into the mines I went. Each area has a shortcut room which makes switching between areas a much more tolerable experience. 

Story: SPOILERS. - It's a simple one about an inexperience soldier on his first real mission. He is charged with going to a small town and getting to the bottom of their troubles. This leads him into the mines of that town and a lengthy dungeon crawl where he learns about the forces of evil that held sway over an ancient civilization that once called the area home. There are also some NPC sidequests but they all amount to ""find me X"".

Controls: I stayed with the default layout and found them to be more than adequate.  There is a lot of wall jumping, ledge grabbing, and even some tricky platforming along the way and I can say I never found myself at odds with the controls. The movement of your character is responsive and I never felt there were situations where I died and it wasn't my fault.  Any kind of movement I wanted to initiate in order to make my way through a room was possible. 

Graphics: It has fairly well animated sprite graphics that give it a charming look. There was some thought put into the animations of the main character and it shows. (I liked the little details like him continuing to breath as an idle animation while he's holding onto the ledge.) Stylistically the game borrows much from games like Bloodstained/SOTN.  For example the animation to swing your weapon looks just like the mentioned other games animations. 

The monsters are also animated well and there are some interesting foes to come across in your travels as well as some standard ones. Cave? Bats and Goblins. Castle? Haunted suits of armor and skeletons. But there is a large bestiary of monsters to keep things fresh and some decent bosses/minibosses along the way. 

There are some interesting areas to explore but they do feel a little similar in the beginning and its not until you get to the Garden where the color pallet finally breaks out of its solemn scheme.  

Overall: It's a standard Metroidvania game with the twist of having a new map layout each time you start over. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table.  You've had this meal before (and prepared better) but you know what you're getting and you'll probably enjoy this one too.

[h1]Review[/h1]
I've played through Chasm a total of three times since I am an achievement hunter. At this point, I also felt like I could give you the most accurate review I could provide you myself since Chasm is an.. interesting game. Let's start off with this game's defining feature and the one you're probably most curious about: the procedurally-generated dungeon design. Yes, this does indeed mean that with every new save file you start, a random world is created for you. And yes, this also sounds better than it does because really, since it's a Metroidvania that relies on you getting upgrades in a specific order they can't go all-out. In my three playthroughs, I can easily say that perhaps only 30% of the entire map changes with each new savefile. And since they are handcrafted rooms, it is very well possible that you might have seen those rooms in a previous playthrough, perhaps just in a different position. It's unfortunate that it's not as random as I hoped it would be, as my three playthroughs all very much felt the same with minor differences like every chest item being random. What hurts even more is that because of this feature, the world feels limited as well. It is still a Metroidvania, but don't expect a rich map where every exit leads to more exits. Instead, it is very linear and only demands you to go back to previous places on a few occasions. There's of course a lot to find in previous areas but most are optional and occasionally also worse than what you already have. I feel like a world in a Metroidvania can make or break a game and while Chasm's isn't bad or anything, for a Metroidvania it's slightly underwhelming. I will appreciate the map showing you where something of interest is however. On that front Chasm is also very noob-friendly.

The other part of a Metroidvania however, is the gameplay. Chasm does control pretty smoothly and very much reminds me off a Castlevania game. Not surprising as the magical weapons are literally Castlevania sub-weapons, and normal weapons are reminiscent of the weapons Alucard could use in Symphony of the Night. The upgrades our main protagonist gets aren't too surprising either. Stuff like a double jump, wall jump and a lantern to illuminate dark places should not come as a surprise. I was a big fan of the bird and sword hats however; they are summons that attack enemies and can level up independently. You can also choose right from the start what class you want to specialize in. Magic in this game is very broken though, especially the knives. This does not necessarily come as a surprise but if you want an easy time even on the hardest difficulties, just upgrade the knives to the maximum and you won't have to worry about anything. Lastly, I want to mention the challenge mode which is actually pretty interesting as it actually puts you into a randomly generated dungeon and you're on a time limit to get a highscore. I personally was done with Chasm after the three playthroughs, but this is a fun addition to the people who want more out of this game.

This is however the extent to which Chasm goes. It plays well overall, but at its core it's just a basic Metroidvania with a basic map. There is nothing wrong with that, but if you are a veteran Metroidvania player you might not get much enjoyment out of it as there are a serious amount of good ones out there. I can't stress enough that Chasm is not bad, it really isn't. But because it set out to do something so ambitious, it had a lot to sacrifice and as a result is nothing more than an average-to-good Metroidvania.

[b][i]Приключенческая, пиксельная метроидвания в духе старых частей «Castlevania».[/i][/b]

[code]Разработчики игры вдохновлялись старыми, классическими играми серии «Castlevania», особенно «Castlevania: Symphony of the Night».[/code]

Нам предстоит обследовать огромный подземный мир из шести областей, состоящих из множества связанных между собой комнат, залов и катакомб. 
В игре присутствует элемент процедурной генерации. Заключается он в том, что с новой игрой комнаты каждой области перемешиваются случайным образом, составляя уникальную карту. Поэтому каждая новая игра будет отличатся не только лутом, но и картой местности (порядком расположения комнат). 
Как в любой метроидвании проходы в некоторые области будут недоступны, пока герой не получит соответствующие умения, предметы или не выполнит определенные действия.

Персонаж может бегать, прыгать, делать отскок назад, рубить мечом (дают в самом начале игры) и использовать второе магического оружие, расходующее ману (его придется раздобыть или купить). С прохождением откроются новые умения: отскок от стен, цепляние за выступы и перекат.

Характеристики главного героя повышаются автоматически с получением нового уровня и с помощью обмундирования/предметов, которые можно найти в сундуках или купить у торговцев, но торговцев придется найти в подземельях и освободить. Только после этого они появятся на поверхности в деревушке и смогут с вами торговать и давать задания.

У героя есть полноценный инвентарь с предметами, возможность взять в каждую руку по оружию и надеть шлем, броню и пару украшений.

Лут в виде золота, кристаллов маны, вещей можно получить из сундуков, при убийстве врагов и разбивании некоторых предметов (лампы, ящики и т.д.). В игре процветает гринд монет для скупки необходимого снаряжения и фарм опыта для повышения характеристик. Этому способствует то, что враги появляются снова, стоит только зайти за экран и вернутся в любой комнате, где есть живность. Если испытываете сложность с прохождением какого-либо этапа, босса или вам хочется купить что-либо у торговцев, можно гриндить врагов бегая между двумя экранами. Если напялить на перса предметы, повышающие удачу, то лута и золота будет выпадать значительно больше!

Радует, что это не рогалик, и нам дают сохранить прогресс в определенных местах. Тут не приходится проходить все с самого начала! В зависимости от умений игрока и генерации карты полное прохождение игры займет 6-10 часов. Это не считая того, что в игре есть аркадный режим с ежедневными и еженедельными испытаниями.

[code]Отличная игра. Настоящее классическое приключение в стиле «Castlevania» с испытанными временем и полюбившимися механиками, увлекательным геймплеем, адекватной сложностью, красивой детализированной графикой, великолепной анимацией и с приличной продолжительностью (около 10-ти часов). Из минусов: сомнительная генерация и невнятный сюжет.[/code]

J'ai téléchargé ce jeu dans l'espoir d'y dénicher quelque chose ayant un rapport, de près ou de loin, à Hollow Knight, un jeu 2D que j'ai jugé beaucoup trop hâtivement. Evidemment, Chasm est loin d'être un Hollow Knight, mais il fait tout de même le café, à mon avis.

Le principe est assez similaire; on a un jeu 2D (pixelisé d'ailleurs, ce qui n'est pas sans rappeler les jeux rétros), et on parcourt divers donjons en parcourant la map. Comme Hollow Knight, on fait divers allers-retours afin de récolter certains items ou objets importants pour avancer dans l'histoire, et ainsi progresser. Cependant, la grosse particularité du jeu est que la map est ... générée de façon aléatoire ! Cela donne une très grande autonomie au jeu, puisque le recommencer vous permettra de vous imposer de nouvelles difficultés par les chemins. De plus, vous pouvez très bien jouer sur la map d'un ami, en modifiant la graine. C'est bien pensé bien que peu utilisé en pratique à mon humble avis. 
En bref, ce jeu a su attirer ma curiosité et m'a plutôt plu.

Cependant, il a néanmoins divers points négatifs ... et ils sont nombreux malheureusement. Tout d'abord, je trouve la musique correcte. Juste, correcte. Elle est pas mauvaise, mais elle est pas assez cool non plus. Je trouve que ça manque de rythme très globalement, notamment dans les combats contre les boss. 
Parlons en ensuite des boss ... Je trouve la difficulté de certains boss (notamment le boss final) un poil abusé. On est très très loin de la difficulté légendaire de Hollow Knight, mais c'est un peu complexe quand même. Le flemmard que je suis a dû faire le plein de potions pour se kamikazer sur le boss de fin. En clair, si comme moi vous aimez moyen la stratégie, ce jeu risque de vous mettre de sérieux bâtons dans les roues. 
Parlons ensuite de la map. Ce jeu dispose, bien sûr, d'un système de carte, pour vous aider à ne pas vous perdre. Cependant, mon dieu, la carte est si pauvre ! Elle indique les sorties, quelques trésors par un malheureux point ... Et c'est tout. Vous n'avez aucun moyen de placer des marqueurs (enfin, si ... Mais seulement un seul, à l'endroit où vous êtes). Autant dire que si vous n'avez pas autant de chance que moi dans ma partie (où globalement tout s'enchaînait assez bien, je n'ai pas eu besoin de passer trois jours à chercher un endroit en particulier), vous êtes très mal barrés avec une carte pareille. Je pense notamment au système ingénieux des ""grottes"". Dans le jeu, vous allez parcourir différents niveaux, qui sont assez grands. Chasm a eu le génie de créer une espèce de salle avec un téléporteur pour relier les niveaux, et des grottes pour accéder rapidement à différents endroits du niveau. Le hic, c'est que, à moins de le connaître par coeur, vous ne savez pas quel chemin vous mènera là où vous voulez qu'il aille. Pourquoi ne pas l'avoir indiqué sur la carte ? Ce serait plus agréable ! 
Et tant qu'on y est, la carte a parfois des ratés ... Il m'indique la présence de trésor dans des salles déjà dépouillées de leur trésor. Bof bof, mais c'est qu'un petit bug.
Enfin, et c'est je pense le plus gros point noir du jeu; OU EST LE BACKGROUND ? Certes, il y a une histoire, mais ça part un peu dans tous les sens, notamment au début. On vous parle un peu de qui vous êtes, dans quel pays vous êtes etc ... Et ces infos là, typiquement, on s'en tape en fait. Le plus important, c'est la suite. L'histoire avec le Roi Trell, la tribu, Ulak, etc ... Ces éléments de l'histoire sont racontés par des journaux trouvés dans le jeu et par les PNJ. En soi, l'histoire est très intéressante, cependant je suis très déçu par le bestiaire. Le bestiaire regroupe les différents ennemis que vous avez tués. Cependant, pour les amateurs de background comme moi, vous serez très déçu de voir qu'il n'y a aucune description ... Si vous avez tué par exemple l'ennemi ""Démon"", vous n'avez aucune idée de son histoire; à quoi il sert, quand il a été créé, etc ... C'est très dommage quand on voit que l'histoire a l'air géniale.

Néanmoins malgré ces points négatifs, Chasm est un jeu, je trouve, assez addictif. Il faut néanmoins garder en tête qu'il faut bien aimer ce type de jeu similaire à Hollow Knight. Il se finit plutôt rapidement, mais on est quand même très satisfait quand il est terminé. Je vous le conseille, mais regardez bien des vidéos sur le jeu avant de sauter dessus. C'est un type de jeu assez spécial qui ne plaît pas à tout le monde !",1578522026,1578522026,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It builds on the foundations that have been laid out for Metroidvanias, so be prepared to mark areas that you can't yet proceed through to make it easier to know where to backtrack too. Personally I'd have liked the ability to have different coloured markers (as to indicate new skills needed or just treasures). For me this was quite annoying once, since I forgot to mark a certain gate, and it was the only point of progression, which meant I had to go throughout all the maps and check everything out (I feel like this is more on me than on the game though). Besides this the soundtracks are quite basic but nice to listen to anyway and won't annoy you into turning off the sound. The environments look really nice and fit well with the rest of the style of the game. The magic feels a bit basic (and honestly strong as in most of these games) but to be fair I haven't used much of it since I prefer combat over magic. The different types of weapons are quite nice, however since it's (somewhat) randomly generated you quite often find weapons weaker than the ones you already have.

The only real performance problem I encountered was quite odd and I'm genuinely not sure if anyone else would ever encounter it. I'm using a Xbox Bluetooth Controller, which means it might sometimes (temporarily) lose connection, most of the time this is just for a second, however Chasm really doesn't seem to like this.

What you need to know:

It's a metroidvania with random layout. The random generation isn't apparent. Based on some guides lots of stuff appears in fixed locations.
New monster. What's your attack routine? I am now invincible.
Give me XP. Level up. Monster is now worth less XP. 
Very easy to tank boss attacks with healing items.

You know what's lazy? The Bestiary. There are 80 odd entries that unlock after killing a fixed amount of each enemy. There is no description of the monster, just some basic stats and what it drops. You scroll through each page 1 at a time so it's hard to find any given entry.

You know what else is lazy? There is no way to sort your equipment. So you go to the blacksmith and look to sell some stuff, and you've got 7 knives all in different places based on when you get them. Some are enchanted but you can't easily compare stats. Want to wear your 2 Jade Rings? They sure aren't next to each other.

It's not bad, but it doesn't feel like a passion project. It feels like the devs had an idea for a procedurally generated metroidvania but got bored with it and put out a decent but ultimately pretty boring game.

[h2]A Brief Review[/h2]

Well, here we are - another procedurally generated Metroidvania. I dunno, man, there are just a hell of a lot of Metroidvanias running around out there, and this randomly generated stuff is all kinda samey. So how about Chasm? How does it stand up?

It's... not bad.

Chasm has a pleasing 16 bit quality to it, with attractive environments and a choice between great chiptunes or great orchestrated music - either way is a win, and having the choice is neat. There's a feel of exploration that I enjoy, and there are plenty of things to find and uncover as you rescue the villagers. The controls are pretty darn good, too - not Dead Cells perfect, but pretty close.

The procedural generation is per save in this one, instead of per run. That means that every time you descend into the Chasm on one save, it'll be the same, but if you start a new game, you'll get a new layout. This is an excellent way to give a game replay value, but it's somewhat let down by the lack of variety in the dungeons. They're great, but I don't think (I haven't beaten it yet, so I don't know for sure) just shuffling them around is going to make a significant difference; it's just going to make one person's play-though a bit different than another's. That's fine as far as it goes, but I don't think it was the goal.

Another thing that could have been addressed with the procedural generation is to have put more found equipment in the dungeon. This is especially true of the sub weapons, which are mostly purchased from a vendor in the village (at least, so far). I would have preferred to unlock them as random drops or to find them in different places depending on the RNG, but this is fine. 

One thing I really don't care for though is the crafting system. It's not that it's bad, it's that it's not especially interesting or well implemented, so it doesn't really ad anything to the game. I'd rather just buy the stuff from a vendor or find it in the dungeon. 

Another small complaint is the shovel. This is really petty, but you get a shovel to dig through certain areas, and you have to equip it and de-equip it as a standard weapon. Not all of the buttons on a standard controller are mapped in the game, so mapping the shovel to a dedicated key would have been much, much less annoying. It wouldn't be so bad if the shovel was a decent weapon, but it's not, so when you need it it's pause, equipment menu, equip shovel, unpause, dig, pause, equipment menu, equip better weapon, unpause, continue the game. It's tedious and it really didn't have to be that way.

Fortunately, the core gameplay loop is entertaining enough to carry multiple playthroughs (or it it for me so far, anyway). The game is charming, the music is quite good, and it presents a decent challenge. All in all, I say go for this one. 7 out of 10, there are much worse ways to spend your money.

- The procedural generation of levels means that the game has missed out on creating some truly intricate and memorable levels or areas within those levels
- The skill upgrades have not been utilised to their full potential, with some feeling like they are only used to get past a specific section or puzzle as opposed to adding to later game strategy

I got no complaints about the pixel art or underlying engine (only saw two minor bugs) and the music is very good. Occasionally the vibration on my gamepad would get stuck on full blast, requiring me to replug it. Winning the game once unlocks a bunch of new options for playing again, such as permadeath mode and ""classes"" (heavily influences level-up stat gains to force a particular build, ex. magical). On my second playthrough I encountered lots and lots of rooms which were not present in the first. This might be due to the different difficulty level or there may be enough of them prepared that only a random handful get chosen for a newly generated world. Either way - pretty cool.

The Chasm borrows heavily from Castlevania. The leveling, monster drops, equipment, even subweapons are almost identical and that's not really a bad thing but there's nothing to the game besides that formula. It gives off a feel like there was something else there, some ideas of its own that were scrapped later on.

On a mechanical level the game is pretty solid. On my playthrough I didn't encounter any bugs or jankyness. One big problem I did encounter is weird difficulty; every boss except the last one were a cakewalk since you can chug potions or sometimes even stand still spam the attack button. In fact I haven't died until about 7 hours into the game. Things got a bit harder in two of the last areas. With the last area having mobs that would kill me in about 3 hits. Having less and less saverooms was a real pain when you died and wasted about 15 minutes. I stopped before I beat the final boss because I just couldn't be bothered anymore.

To finish on a positive note the music was quite enjoyable, although I mostly listened to the chiptune version. While there wasn't much detail in the tilesets they looked nice and fit well into the theme of the area.

The second crash was so bad that programs on my computer would no longer execute and I had to perform a hard reset of my whole system to fix it.

Ao começar o jogo somos apresentados um pouco a sua lore, nela nosso personagem principal é um recruta do reino de Guildean no qual é encaminhado para sua primeira missão, essa missão consiste em investigar o sumiço de alguns moradores de uma vila e enfrentar um monstro no qual vem causando confusões no mesmo.Claramente esse é apenas um resumo da história do jogo no qual vai se desenrolando conforme avançamos no jogo, mas não pense que a história é tão impactante ou divertida, já que acaba sendo uma narrativa um pouco cansativa de se ler, sendo uma história bem básica para a jornada do herói. para tentar concertar isso Chasm introduz alguns livros como coletáveis que tentam explicar alguns acontecimentos no jogo mais aprofundados na história do grande chefe e no desaparecimento dos cidadãos do vilarejo, mas novamente de uma leitura bem chata e não tão empolgante.

Já o gameplay do jogo é bem fluido e divertido, inicialmente nosso personagem poderá apenas pular e dar golpes comuns com sua espada, assim sendo mais incrementado conforme os powerups que pegamos ao longo dos mundos que visitamos, podendo dar pulos duplos, se agarrar em paredes, nadar e outros que serão essenciais para visitar todos os locais do mapa.Cada arma que nosso herói adquire ao vencer inimigos terá uma forma de manuseio diferente e alcances distintos para acertar os inimigos, espadas terão alcances médios e uma velocidade média, adagas serão super rápidas mas com um curto alcance e martelos ou espadas de duas mão serão compridas e fortes porém bem lentas de se utilizar.Logo Chasm lhe dá a liberdade de você escolher o seu estilo de combate com essas diversas armas,vale lembrar que o herói também poderá usar magias de combate que podem ser adquiridos ao salvar um dos cidadãos do vilarejo.

E falando mais dos cidadãos do vilarejo, essa é praticamente uma das quest principais do jogo, não só para fazer 100%, nele mas para conseguir ter uma facilidade em avançar nos mundos. Cada cidadão poderá te ajudar com alguma especialidade que eles tem, o ferreiro pode lhe vender armaduras e armas no qual podem lhe dar bons atributos para avançar nas telas, a padeira pode lhe fornecer comida no qual é essencial para recuperar sua vida, a maga pode lhe dar magias novas para ter ataques melhores contra alguns inimigos e entre outros que não citei aqui. Cada um estará perdido de forma aleatória no mapa então vale a pena explorar bem cada mundo.

Chasm também tem suas Side-quests que podem ser adquiridas com os cidadãos do vilarejo, grande parte deles vão pedir para entregar algum item específico, em troca lhe darão pequenas recompensar ou vão melhorar seus arsenais para que o herói possa comprar itens melhores, no final acaba sendo até que útil pois as recompensas ajudam muito no decorrer do jogo lhe dando mais atributos para enfrentar inimigos.

Sim. Chasm contém um sistema de atributo,sendo Força,Sorte,Inteligência,Vitalidade. Nosso herói tem um sistema de level up no qual derrotando monstros ele evolui e ganha atributos aleatórios, vale lembrar que aqui não é igual Ragnarok que podemos escolher e montar uma build específica. O mais importante nesse sistema é as armaduras e armas que o herói possui, todos eles têm atributos importantes e um sistema de raridade no qual pode deixar nosso herói muito mais forte ao longo da jornada, também é possível usar alguns pergaminhos que acabam fornecendo um atributo aleatório para o herói.

Sobre os mundos,existem um total de 5 mundos que poderão ser visitados, cada um com sua trilha sonora específica e monstros totalmente criativos na forma de pixel art, vale ressaltar que esse é um aspecto muito bom do jogo os gráficos em pixel art estão incríveis e muito bem desenhados, para dar uma vida extra no jogo existe também o bestiário no qual o herói deve matar alguns inimigos inúmeras vezes para registrá-los e assim saber um pouco de seu lore e itens que podem ser dropados.

Chasm pode ser muito divertido no início mas acaba se tornando bem enjoativo conforme sua trajetória, sua história é bem fraca de fato e os personagens secundários e cidadãos da vila são totalmente fracos, por não ter muitos acontecimentos o jogo se torna um “visita aqui mata ali” não tendo um algo a mais ou momentos épicos, até mesmo os chefes se tornam bem sem graças ao enfrentá los. Logo Chasm se torna um simples metroidvania que tem seu valor sim, mas está muito longe de ser um indie de peso comparado com outros Metroidvanias por aí.

Chasm was one of my most anticipated Metroidvanias this decade; sharp art design, SOTN influence, procgen world leading to infinite replayability? How could I not be excited?

Well, a few things happened. One, a billion games came out, and wanting replayability no longer became a value add to me. And procgen games had already started to wear thin, with aggravating dupe rooms, dead ends, and an overwhelming feeling of malaise. Two, A Robot Named Fight came out, and was everything Chasm had promised but for Metroid. So how would that impact my enjoyment of Chasm now that it’s finally here?

It’s going to be impossible not to compare the two games, so I will talk about why both inhabit the space without pushing the other out. Like a double helix, these two games!

What ARNF gets right is all in the seed generation and content. Because it takes inspiration from games like the Binding of Isaac, you are constantly unlocking new ways to play in your runs, which the seed generation incorporates. Both games do an adequate job of building a world map that does not result in an unwinnable state, but because ARNF gets content updates and has all the unlocks to manage, that makes it all the more impressive that it continues to hold together.

But if it doesn’t feel right, then it’s all for naught, and this was my constant issue with Fight, and where Chasm shines. ARNF’s movement and aiming is clunky and feels like a low budget Axiom Verge, while Chasm is responsive and fun to traverse. Combat in Chasm is along the lines of Castlevania, with meaty axe swings, quick sword thrusts and swift daggers (a high risk/reward option as their range is very short). You also have magic you can wield in a pinch, although I did not use it much.

But the map is a deficiency for both in certain ways. In ARNF I experienced dead ends, a roguelite crime. In Chasm, was encountered at least five duplicate rooms in my play through. Chasm also relies on the vertical tunnel too often, and in the early going... hey, it’s exciting to see where each path leads. But when you haven’t saved in twenty minutes and none of the paths lead to a save room, it’s a bit aggravating. Especially when warp scrolls cost as much as two health hi-potions.

Speaking of saves, ARNF is about do-it-or-die single runs, so its fast travel and saves are limited (is there even fast travel? I forget), while Chasm has no permadeath or even a penalty for dying, so the challenge is not quite as high. Naturally enemies get stronger, but that’s about it. So you can be aggressive in scouting further and further, as long as you have the healing items to keep you alive.

Rescuing villagers will send them back to town to open up shops, but I was a bit disappointed here, because I had hoped for a bigger visual revamp as the town gets back up to speed, and the shops don’t carry a ton of products even after you fulfill each townie’s side quest.

Visually, Chasm kicks ARNF in the tush (pardon my language!!) with gorgeous character animations and map detail. But let’s be honest here, this was not a hard competition, as Fight traces over elements of Super Metroid with reckless abandon.

Your purchasing decision will ultimately come down to what kind of game you want. I feel that both are a 7.5 out of 10, so which do you prefer: a conventional SOTN style game whose procgen feels pointless and detracts from the experience (Chasm) or a Metroid-like that will kill you over and over, which you’ll play for 100 hours (Fight)? Personally I prefer Chasm because I like to finish what I start and move on, but your tastes may be different.

Chasm doesn’t live up to the expectations of the Kickstarter, but it’s a perfectly serviceable game in the genre.",1577823048,1577823048,True,1,0,0.501800715923309326,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Após anos de desenvolvimento, chasm chegou ""datado"". Com um sistema procedural que não cria um mapa/salas a cada vez que você morre, e sim um mundo a cada vez que você inicia um novo gameplay, levando isso em conta, ser ou não ser procedural, não muda nada, as salas principais, são sempre as mesmas, o que muda é o trajeto, e ainda assim, muda muito pouco.

Sobre a história, ela é bem simples, uma jornada do herói clássica.

Sobre o gameplay, ele é divertido, pelo menos depois que você aprende a lidar com algumas mecânicas ""zoadas"". O dash, que só vai para trás, e eventualmente, se você aparta o direcional enquanto usa o dash, o personagem vira e vai de costas em direção ao inimigo, juntando isso com o fato dele não cancelar o dano, acaba sendo meio inútil.
O sistema de wall jump, além de inutilizar uma melhoria adquirida anteriormente, é bem esquisito.
As side quests se resumem a buscar algo para algum npc que você salvou anteriormente.

O mapa é relativamente grande, e vazio, talvez por ser procedural, e isso pode fazer com que você se perca, além de ser cansativo, pois os checkpoints tendem a ser distantes, te obrigando a ficar perambulando pelos corredores das dungeons correndo o risco de morrer.

Chasm é um jogo genérico, não que isso seja ruim, mas quando se soma essa falta de originalidade a mecânicas ruins, você tem um jogo não tão legal. Por mais divertido que possa ser, para mim chasm é aquele tipo de jogo que não vale ser rejogado.

Mi sento dunque in dovere di dire la mia, cercando di fare un po' di ordine e sottolineare quelli che sono sia i pregi sia i difetti di Chasm.

[h1]Introduzione[/h1]
Chasm è un metroidvania procedurale nato su kickstarter. La storia non offre chissà quali novità, siamo un cadetto inviato in un villaggio di minatori per far luce sulle disgrazie che da poco tempo si sono abbattute sugli abitanti. E' proprio a partire da questo punto che muniti di spada ci avventureremo nelle gallerie sotterranee, uccidendo mostri e affrontando boss.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Chasm presenta la [b]classica struttura dei più classici metroidvania[/b], ci saranno una serie di aree collegate tra di loro da scorciatoie. Ogni area avrà zone irraggiungibili o segrete, almeno fino a quando non otterremo degli upgrade che ci consentiranno di farlo tornando indietro e riesplorando la zona.
I nemici sono molteplici e abbastanza variegati. Ognuno di loro, anche i più comuni, possiedono un paio di move set che li rendono discretamente interessanti. 
La difficoltà generale è [b]medio/bassa[/b], ulteriormente abbassata dalla possibilità di fermare il gioco a inventario aperto ed usare pozioni a manetta.
In compenso la [b]struttura delle zone è molto buona[/b], sia come ambientazione che come disposizione stanze. [b]Esplorare non mi ha per niente annoiato, anzi.[/b]

[h1]In generale[/h1]
+Un titolo abbastanza solido...
+Buona l'atmosfera sia a livello di musica che comparto grafico (pur parlando di una pixel art abbastanza minimale)
+Si lascia giocare fino alla fine
+Bilanciato sia a livello di minions che boss...

-... ma rimane un classico metroidvania. Nessuna novità o qualcosa che mi abbia particolarmente colpito.
- Storia quasi assente e lineare
- ... come già scritto nella sezione gameplay la possibilità di far scorte di pozioni permettono di fare fuori i boss al primo tentativo senza difficoltà. Mi rendo conto che resta a discrezione del giocatore, tuttavia anche mentalmente il pericolo ""Morte"", diventa quasi assente.
- Un platform procedurale ? Ebbene sì, la struttura del mondo dovrebbe essere leggermente diversa da giocatore a giocatore. Nonostante questa unica novità il risultato è deludente. Insomma anche se le stanze hanno ordine leggermente diverso nulla cambia se giocato da me a qualcun altro. Anzi, l'unica cosa che si aggiunge è una leggera difficoltà nel caso in cui si cerchino delle guide online con mappe che ovviamente mai corrispondono alla propria.

[h1]Conclusioni[/h1]
Pur avendo elencato non pochi difetti penso che Chasm faccia il suo lavoro. E' un gioco che intrattiene e diverte fino alla fine. Non il più memorabile dei platform vania, ma una run ve la farete volentieri.

Pros:
Bons gráficos
Trilha sonora marcante, possui versão 8 bits também
Jogabilidade simples 
Não é difícil

Contras:
Muitos inimigos não possuem ligação lógica com o cenário/lore
O comando de dash para trás não tem nenhuma utilidade prática
Necessidade de dar backtrack (revisitar) no mapa por muitas vezes
Lore mal apresentada
Inimigos possuem padrão de golpes muito parecidos
Alguns glitches visuais, mas que são raros e não atrapalham nada a jogabilidade.


Esse jogo tem potencial de ser melhor ainda com pequenos ajustes.
Por exemplo: 
Coletar os orbes azuis mesmo ao sair do mapa enquanto eles estão se aproximando do herói.
Ter diversos símbolos e cores para marcar o mapa. Existem variados eventos que só liberam com itens chave, fora a necessidade de dar backtrack, então isso facilitaria a revisitar os locais sem acesso.

It is a fun game. The weapons are fun to play around with, the [always respawning] enemies have a fairly unique pattern, and there is no need to grind for any levels once you get used to the easy, smooth, and responsive controls. 

However, like I mentioned earlier, for the amount of backtracking you have to do, the respawning enemies after just going from one room to the next, and uselessness of going back to the surface is annoying is enough to make me not recommend this game to everyone.

Игра выполнена в ретро-стиле, начало несколько затянуто и геймплей поначалу однообразен - карты подземелий генерируются самим компьютером и комнаты сегментов подземелий выглядят не слишком различающимися, практически без своих ""изюминок"". Хотя как и в любой ""метроидвании"" такие изюминки есть, и нам придется возвращаться на старые места не раз. Тут, кстати, всплывает и еще один из главных недостатков игры - подобные ""места интересов"" на общей карте подземелий никак не отмечены (кроме сейвпоинтов и системы перехода между районами подземелий) и учитывая размеры самого подземелья приходится с трудом вспоминать где и что ты видел, когда приходит для этого время. В результате игру довольно сложно продолжить через какое-то время, немного отдохнув от однотипного прохождения. Приходится заново пробегать подземелье вспоминая где там и что, а это опять быстро надоедает.

Блокировать персонаж пока что не умеет, вместо этого может отпрыгнуть, но с учетом заторможенной отработки нажатия нужной кнопки джойстика сделать это часто не удается вовремя. Управление вообще слегка заторможено и не всегда регистрируются нажатия кнопок джойстика, что не есть хорошо, так как прыгать приходится много, а позже во время прыжков еще и использовать парашют. Впрочем, игра достаточно медленная и в большинстве случаев это не критично.

В остальном всё довольно обычно и чуть выше среднего по больнице.

Ich war anfangs ein wenig über die schlechten Bewertungen erschrocken und kann sie (Stand heute) absolut nicht nachvollziehen. Mag sein, dass es dank dutzender Patches, die ich alle nicht mitbekam, für mich als Spätzünder-Gamer nicht mehr nachvollziehbar sein kann, aber der Artstyle kann's nicht gewesen sein - so schön wie das 16 Bit Abenteuer aussieht, sieht selten ein Retro-Game aus. Ich hab mich echt schon lange über den Release des Spiels gefreut und wurde nicht enttäuscht.

In Chasm geht's durch eine zufällig (aber einmalig für den jeweiligen Spielstand für immer gleichbleibende) generierte Dungeon-Landschaft, die sich an diversen 0815-Settings orientiert: Mine, Folterkeller, Gärten, Festung und Lavahöhle. Diese erkunden wir nach und nach und obwohl sie zufällig generiert ist, wirkt sie nicht störend baukasten-förmig, sondern in sich stimmig, auch wenn einzigartige Locations viel zu selten sind. Aber wirklich gestört hat es mich nicht. Das Hochleveln, Ausrüsten, Quests erfüllen, neue Fähigkeiten erwerben und in die entlegensten Winkel vorrücken hat einfach dauerhaft enorm viel Spaß gemacht - eben auch, wenn das Geschehen mit toller Musik untermalt wird, die man auch noch als Chiptune-Version aktivieren und hören kann. Was habe ich mich aber in die Standard-Musik vom Game verliebt. Soooooooooooooooooo toll!

Das Gegnerdesign ist sehr schön, teilweise sehr fordernd (auch auf Leicht).
Nur die Story und die expliziten Hinweise wie es jetzt weiter geht, haben gefehlt.

Nichtsdestotrotz für jeden Metroidvania-Fan empfehlenswert!

入り口から道なりに右に行くとキーアイテムがあって取ると左へ行けるみたいな、進行上必要なユニーク部屋の位置関係そのものは固定。それらを繋ぐ通路部分だけがランダム生成っぽいのだが、つまりステージの大半は特になんの演出意図もこもっていない、ただただ部屋と部屋を繋ぐだけの無味乾燥な通路。

何回生成し直そうが最初右に行ってアイテムを取って引き返して左っていう大筋に変化はないし、そもそも死んでもロードしてやり直すだけで再生成なんかしない。本当になんの意味があるんだこれ。

また戦闘のメカニズムもダメな方向にシナジーを生んでいる気がする。

このゲーム、通常攻撃をバクステでキャンセルできない。一度振り始めたら最後までやり切ってしまう。普通に敵に近付いて殴ると絶対にモーション中に殴り返されるので、近付いて攻撃を誘う→離れて空振りさせる→また近付いて殴る、が基本戦法になる。

離れて空振りさせられるだけの空間が後ろにないと話にならない。なので通路が広い。ちょっと歩いて敵がいて、またしばらく歩いて敵がいて、と散発的にしか接敵しない。そんな通路がランダムでこれでもかと生成される。面白さの密度が薄い。

The visual aesthetic has a charming, grim Black Cauldron meets SNES appeal to it. The story is beyond forgettable and the music is pretty low-key.  

Its a metroidvania heavy on the castlevania side of the equation. While it has equipment and leveling up like SoTN the combat requires patience the way linear castlevania games do.   Traversing several corridors between save points can be rather daunting, I died countless times due to a combination of tricky monsters and getting sloppy when I'm in a hurry (such as when backtracking).  Strangely, the bosses frequently proved less difficult than the path to reach them because if you save 2 or three health potions you can spam attack them to death before really learning their patterns.  Most of the weapons and equipment are pretty boring, and the 'spells' (sub-weapons) are lifted directly out of the Konami series.  I found a couple hats that summoned familiars and I would have preferred that was a separate equipment slot so I could use other hats and keep the familiar active.  

The level design is pretty decent for a game that uses an RNG seed.  The rooms are well-populated with platforms, monsters, traps and treasures. Very reminiscent of Rogue Legacy, except the map is set. There is a lot of slow back-tracking in this and the fast travel spots can be kind of clumsily organized.  There are hidden corridors in walls, almost all of which I missed initially until I got an item that pings when they're nearby.  There are some minor puzzles “where do I take this item” kind of stuff scattered throughout, and it can be kind of annoying if you want to look up solutions because everyone's play-through is different. 

I've played 19 metroidvanias because it is one of my favorite genres. This one is about 12th in over-all quality for me, but it depends on how much you enjoy the aesthetics or heavy castlevania emphasis.",1576447491,1576447491,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I put barely any time into this game and already feel the need to uninstall. 

Some of my primary complaints are to do with the user experience and the quality of life. Simple things like tweaking audio and video are severely limited. Audio slider tweaks in increments of 5, while video has a simple resolution picker and a fullscreen Y/N feature. There is no windowed full screen and you can't drag the window to resize. 

Control scheme is clunky at best. Press a to jump, hold A to jump higher. Apparently there is a ledge grab but I never got far enough to find it. Y to dash backwards bu that very often hinders you more than it helps. I made it to level 3 before dying but never figured out what leveling up actually does for you, as there didn't seem to be any level up or ability or skill menu to speak of. Maybe one exists further in, but again, with no tutorial or explanation, I just felt like I was floundering. 

The story feels pretty half-assed. You're a generic knight in a generic country doing generic quests for generic reward. Fight skeletons and slimes and save the kingdom. Whoop-d-doo. 

I got to the first boss or mini boss, don't know which, in the first dungeon I came across. He had a simple attack scheme, but with no discernible way for me to heal myself mid fight and before long I died. Instead of throwing me back to one of the save statues or a city I've been in, it kicked me back to the title screen. This alone made me quit playing. In metroidvania games you die. A lot. If I'm gonna be going all the way back to the title screen every time I die, then I'm just going to take that as a sign from the developers that they don't really want me playing their game, and you know what? I don't want to be playing it anyways.

I find that a good knife or glove blade are best for most bosses if you can get in range with them to stab them several times, with a larger weapon for platforming and the remaining bosses.

the variety of spells is interesting, but with a lack of mana regeneration it makes using anything other than the dagger (or shuriken/axe for some bosses) a waste of mana. the biggest waste of mana is the boomerang, that only goes in extremely close range, but does less damage than just hitting the enemy with your sword.

A while back, I played a demo of this game at my local big-box store. From what I played of the demo, it was lots of fun. With a throwback to classic Gameboy Advance Metroidvanias such as Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance, it's a new take on one of my favorite genres of games. Initially, I was slightly discouraged from buying it, because I didn't have a good gaming laptop and it wasn't on any of the consoles I owned- but with a new laptop and a release on Nintendo Switch, I've finally had the chance to play the full game.

With the new 1.070 patch, it significantly cuts down on the amount of backtracking required and eases travel through the game's areas. The game only has two major puzzles, both of which are required to progress, but the patch eases things up (for one, you have to count the number of objects in three murals in one area, and in the other you find a song you play on bells in a tower to open a gate)

Personally, I find the mixture of set pieces and corridors to be a wise choice. There is some variety in the game's generated maps- it has enough differences and variations to feel new, but enough consistency that if you know what to look for, you'll have little trouble navigating around. You can mark areas of interest on the map, and an area where there's a chest or a breakable crate will always have a dot, though it may take just a little bit of looking to find what you're looking for.

Overall, it's a good game, a wonderful example of a Metroidvania, and an excellent throwback to the days of Castlevania on the GBA. I'd recommend this game to anyone who liked those games, as well as Symphony of the Night. The class system you unlock after the first playthrough is similar to Circle of the Moon's, in that it changes your starting stats, items, and growths, as well as a few other features, such as the Mage class recharging MP at save shrines.

8/10 - I think it was a little short, personally, but otherwise it's an excellent game, and a wonderful metroidvania.",1576000264,1576000264,True,2,0,0.546998858451843262,0,True,False,False,False,,,

me ha dejado frio pero a la vez es muy puro como metrodvania y no he podido despegarme de el hasta que he explorado todo,aun con esos fallos te mantiene enganchado
otro punto que no me ha gustado es que ha tirado por la narrativa en base a notas haciendo que no me sintiera del todo en el papel del caballero que investiga la mina pero a la vez esto lo compensa con el mismo aliciente de buscar el diario.
pero lo que hace bien lo hace bien y el pixel art es bello he de perdonarle mucho de los fallos por que en verdad he de verlo como una oda al genero,

Este título pretende ser un juego de aventura que toma mecánicas de los metroidvania, especificamente de Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

Si os preocupa que el juego sea un rogue-like pues no lo hagáis, lo único que tiene procedural es la creación del mundo y este se mantiene constante durante la partida. Lo que puede hacer que este juego no se sienta como una experiencia plenamente Metroidvania es que el mundo se siente divido por etapas, en un momento estas en unas minas y posteriormente luego terminas en unas catacumbas, luego en un bosque, sin una aparente cohesión. 

El acceso a ciertas áreas está limitado por la resolución de puzles (y no solamente habilidades como es usual en el genero), no son complicados pero el juego asume que es lo suficientemente obvio o que estas tomando nota de los lugares que has visitado para evitar que andes buscando sin sentido en donde está la clave para resolver el puzle.

Lo que he detestado más hasta el momento es el backtracking, ya que ciertas habitaciones tediosas de pasar debido a su diseño. Por ejemplo, hay una habitación que es un corredor de 3 pantallas de largo llena de enemigos algo tanquetosos, a veces uno puede ignorar los enemigos y saltárselos, pero en otras, están acomodados de tal manera que un enfrentamiento es inevitable. A esto encimémosle que la variación de enemigos por etapa no son muchas (3 a 5 tipo de enemigos por área), y que hay enemigos que son muy similares en su comportamiento (o solo es un cambio de skin).

La curva de dificultad también puede ser extraña, en las primeras 2 etapas siento que escala bien, pero luego empecé a sentir que las siguientes etapas presentaban picos irregulares lo que me hace pensar que el juego esperaba que llegará con más nivel hasta ese punto... a sí, el juego maneja sistema de experiencia de manera similar al juego en el que se inspiraron.

Gráficamente me parece muy bonito, tiene una decente animación y ambientaciones buenas. Por alguna razón, el juego a veces sufre de ralentizaciones, no son muy a menudas y tampoco muy graves pero molesta un poco dado que se trata de un juego 2D.

El sonido está bien, nada que quejarse, quizás que los loops de algunas canciones son muy cortos y se pueden ponerse cansones.

El final del juego esta ""pachuco"" (decepcionante) para todo el esfuerzo invertido.

Pero bueno... lo importante es, ¿el juego es disfrutable? yo diría que sí. La duración de su campaña es de alrededor de 7 horas y el nivel de reto que mantuvo tomando decisiones para cambiar mi equipo, ver cómo podía eludir zonas molestas y que atajo tomar para reducir el tedio de la exploración. Como motivante para rejugar, el juego te otorga una calificación al final para que intentes de mejorar tu run. 

Dado todo lo anterior y que Steam no posee una calificación neutral, le doy manita arriba porque el juego hizo algo para no dejarlo botado.

Esta es la semilla de mi primera partida y con la cual hice esta revisión, por si la quieren intentar.

И одно могу сказать точно, что было бы неплохо видеть эту игру на русском и у неё есть некий стиль. Всё зависит от разработчиков и/или издателя [/h1]

Когда-то я играл Blackthorne - ответвление серии про Орков от Blizzard. Притом ответвление брутальное, главный герой - мужик с дробовиком наперевес. Там был довольно медленный игровой процесс. Нужно было уклоняться от врагов, Орков и другой нечисти. Игра была также двумерной. Но там было что-то вроде Flashback. Но эта игра своей медлительностью почему-то напомнила Blackthorne.

Итак, есть некоторые проблемы в этой игре и отзывы очень неоднозначные:
- Во-первых, здесь нет русского перевода, а текста порой очень много. А также очень много заданий. Можно вообще болтаться по миру и не знать куда идти.
- В некоторых локациях есть довольно странная закольцованность и непонятная мне. Зачем закольцовывать уровни, если можно просто не дать идти за границу уровня. А так получается непонятка...
- Карта крайне неинформативная и просто прямоугольнички. В Dust по карте ориентироваться было веселее.
- Очень неповоротливый главный герой в боевом плане, хоть и есть вроде отскок и по идее можно привыкнуть.
- Порой действительно становится скучновато и возвращаться не всегда хочется из-за медленного игрового процесса и просто отсутствия перевода с учётом просто кучи пиксельного текста...
- Очень непонятный масштаб экрана - ощущение, что играешь в каком-то окошке. Так и не понял, как развернуть на весь экран - но разрешение стоит правильное...
- Постоянное возрождение врагов даже в пределах экрана. Стоит зайти за экран и все враги опять на месте. Это можно было бы оправдать прокачкой, но даже прокачка здесь довольно нудноватая и долгая...
- Очень странные тайминги ударов и прыжков. Постоянно герой собирается с силами видимо. Стоит не вовремя нажать кнопку и герой пропустит удар. То есть вообще удар не сработает. А враги здесь очень резкие...


Но есть и плюсы:
+ Шикарные мелодии. Но можно включить и Chiptune
+ Дух приключения. Даже без перевода игра заставила в себя играть и изучать локации, ковыряться в улучшениях, искать новые возможности. Это же метроидвания. Но всё это до поры до времени и порой блуждать по этим локациям надоедает просто критично.
+ Неплохая пиксельная графика с CRT-эффектом, который можно отключить.
+ Хорошая рисовка персонажей с врагами. 
+ Враги хоть и предсказуемые, но стиль хороший.
+ Колоритно нарисованные боссы.
+ Наличие соревнований дневных и недельных в виде забега по локация на время. Вот тут нет метроидвании, а чисто боевой платформинг и случайно генерируют локации.
+ Здесь нет постоянной смерти, т.е. после гибели и зловещей надписи GAME OVER можно запросто загрузить сохранение и продолжать дальше как ни в чём ни бывало. Это одновременно и + и -. Но может это просто такая привилегия на лёгком уровне сложности. Поэтому я не начинаю сразу со сложного режима.

Так вот, это неоднозначный проект, но совсем плохим назвать не могу. Просто не могу поставить рекомендацию хотя бы из-за отсутствия перевода. Есть множество других подобных метроидваний на русском, чтобы засиживаться в этой. Но радует наличие карточек, облака, достижений, доски результатов, поддержки контроллера и даже платформы линукс. Но русский им было сложно добавить в то время, как даже в некоторых корейских разработках вроде Next Hero есть русский перевод.

[h1] По итогу же скажу, что играть в это можно при наличии знаний английского языка и просто желания неторопливого игрового процесса с довольно нудной прокачкой. Без прокачки придётся очень долго лупить врагов, особенно на арене.... [/h1]

The game forces you to backtrack and what not but it is mostly linear. You must fight the bosses in order etc and complete areas in a relatively linear order. There is not really much to explore. There was on one occasion had a mini-la mulana-like puzzle. And the only other puzzle in the game was pretty lame. 

The game having a random generator to create the rooms is interesting but doesn't really add anything to the game.

Combat system is reminiscent of Castlevania especially with backdash mechanic. Not a huge fan of but the movement feels fluid throughout most of the game.

The weapon types were pretty much the same with the best one clearly being the one with a wide swing / overhead attack. The entire game is based around the combat, so at least killing mobs required some finesse instead of button mashing. Most enemies you have to dodge an attack before attacking. With sparse save points it forces you to learn monster patterns and actually play safe instead of running forward and attack like some platformers games do - just rambo through trash mobs. Combat can get a bit boring though if you like using different weapons / builds when there clearly aren't any.

The boss fights were well designed for the most parts, though your giant hitbox can be frustrating to get used to when you've played precision smaller hitbox platformers.

Some of the movement mechanics felt a bit clunky especially on the last boss fight, unable to parachute after double jump.

Ok, so why I give the game positive review? The game overall has ~70% positive ending up at mixed. I was able to play the game and beat in ~9 hours on hard mode, but I enjoyed my experience. Typically, I rate/enjoy games solely on the gameplay / combat and not on things like customization, graphics, story, etc.

Some of the negative reviews are stupid such as little save points. There are plenty and you have consumables. The drop rates are fine and the only time I had to grind a bit was to complete one of the early meat collecting quests in the first area after clearing everything else in the game.

In short, as a metroidvania, this game is pretty bad - below average. As a platformer, probably mediocre or slightly above average. The positive review is more of a means to boost the game's rating a bit. I had negative expectations going in but it definitely does deserve higher than the 68% it currently has.

Inspirado en grandes exponentes del género como Metroid, Diablo o Symphony of the Night, Chasm se presenta como un juego de acción y plataformas en 2D, aderezado con un componente de aleatoriedad en sus niveles. El título nos lleva al Reino de Guildeon donde asumiremos el rol de un joven aspirante a caballero que deberá viajar a un recóndito pueblo con el objetivo de rescatar a sus pobladores y eliminar a las fuerzas del mal allí presentes. Si bien su premisa no es de lo mas original, como así tampoco lo es su concepto de juego, Chasm se deja jugar y resulta ser adictivo, puesto que ofrece varios incentivos, tales como misiones secundarias y decenas de secretos, que nos obligan -en cierto modo- a explorar los entornos en profundidad. A nivel jugable estamos ante un juego relativamente desafiante tanto en sus combates, en especial contra los enemigos comunes, como en los segmentos de plataformas. No es que sea un juego implacable, pero en mas de una ocasión nos mantendrá al borde del asiento, deseando llegar con vida a la próxima sala de guardado. Respecto a lo procedural, los niveles de Chasm se generan de forma aleatoria, haciendo que cada partida sea diferente a la anterior. Claro está que no es un juego perfecto ya que tiene sus pegas, como el hecho de que los jefes finales sean bastante fáciles, que no haya demasiada variedad de objetos o que muchas veces terminemos vagabundeando sin saber donde ir. Sin embargo Chasm es una propuesta solida, tradicional y desafiante para quien busque una alternativa en el género ¡Recomendado!

Lo Bueno:
+Un metroidvania retro de pura cepa.
+Secuencias de plataformeo desafiantes.
+Su simplicidad lo hace muy divertido.
+Apartado gráfico bien cuidado.

Lo Malo:
-La banda de sonido pasa desapercibida.
-Los jefes no suponen un desafío.
-No aporta nada nuevo al género.
-Desequilibrio en la progresión.",1574058850,1574058850,True,8,0,0.602357387542724609,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Разработчики вдохновлялись старыми играми серии Castlevania, в особенности Symphony of the Night, о чём они сообщали ещё во время кампании на Kickstarter. Поэтому у Chasm с классикой Konami очень много общего: и — частично — визуальный стиль, и свисающие с потолков светильники и лампы, которые можно разбивать одним ударом, и магические приёмы. Персонаж постепенно обзаводится новыми способностями и позднее сможет цепляться за уступы, отскакивать от стен и совершать подкаты, хотя это нынче характерно для любой игры такого типа.

И хоть точной копией Castlevania проект не назвать, чем-то новым он тоже не кажется. Главной «фишкой» Chasm стала процедурная генерация уровней — все комнаты прорисованы вручную, а вот их порядок будет отличаться с каждым новым прохождением.

[b]首先感谢中国鉴赏家同好会赠游[/b]
[H1]前言[/H1]
本作是一款由Bit Kit制作作带来的结合了Roguelite的“银河恶魔城”类像素风动作游戏。


[H1]游戏体验[/H1]
玩家需要操作作为骑士团团员的的男主角远赴被恶魔侵袭的矿区进行调查。游戏Roguelite要素主要体现在迷宫地图方面，迷宫可以随者选择设定中选择的种子随机生成。而在玩法方面本作在有着明显的《恶魔城：月下夜想曲》的影子。攻击灯具获得增益道具，角色装备与成长，先后闪避等要素均有存在，而主角的挥剑，跳跃，下蹲后的斜角攻击也让人有着较强的既视感。游戏虽然有着骑士团的背景设计但世界观设定上则并非是欧洲大陆的那一套，巨大的沙虫，美洲印第安传说的温迪哥等要素的出现然本作更趋向于架空的混搭风设定。游戏的难度并不算太高，主角可以随着消灭怪物不断提升等级有着更改的容错率，在救回同伴后作为大本营的小镇会不断带来更多丰富且便捷的服务。游戏的每一关大关卡所分为的若干个小关卡会以捷径洞口的方式与回到陆地表面的洞口相连，BOSS战的大门前更会放置明显的骷髅头标志物警告前方的危险。玩家可以随时回到大本营对角色的状态装备进行恢复和调整。

玩家通关剧情的本篇后还可以通过“街机模式”中获得跟多的乐趣。这里没有冗长的剧情，玩家只需要在限定时间内通过结合自身装备竟可能攻略更多的洞窟然后通过得分与日排行榜，周排行榜的玩家们一较高下。

本作尚不支撑汉化，但网上已有质量还算不错民间汉化补丁，对英语有压力对玩家推荐打上补丁后流畅游玩本作。不过补丁针对是游戏对早期版本，新版本中对“街机模式”尚未汉化，在游戏主界面会以为“？？？？？”对形式显示。的确民间汉化足可以在后续对补丁进行更新或者制作组可以在后期加入官方中文了。


[H1]总结[/H1]
本作的虽然距大名鼎鼎的《恶魔城》系列还有很远距离，不过自身也有着还算不错的可玩性，喜欢“银河恶魔城”的玩家推荐尝试本作。

[u] My departure [/u]

I searched for a game that remind me of the good old Castlevania AoS and other Metroidvania. I played a lot of them, and I stumbled upon Chasm.


[u] The journey [/u]

In the first hours of my gameplay experience, Chasm was really fun : exploring the Mines, killing monsters, looting... The levels was sometimes hard and you are always looking at your health. But then I looted a special weapon (a quality drop if you want). And then it began.

I was overpowered. And it was at that moment that all the good parts of the game were sunk under all the bad sides : the quests, the levels proceduraly-generated that could (I don't think is still the case today) block you, clunky jumps...

It's really just those RPG elements that drag it down.

Now, to address the downvotes and negative reviews.

I'm assuming that most of the bad reviews are coming from people who just don't have much experience with metroidvanias, RPG's, or retro video games in general, because they seem to focus mostly on things like not getting items as often as they want to, or that they have to grind for some experience to progress at some point and say that the pacing is terrible or it's too hard.

The pacing of this game is perfectly fine and I never once felt that any part of the game was unreasonably difficult or too drawn out. At worst I may have had to grind a few rooms maybe ten times to gain a level or become familiar with an enemy's move set. For anyone who thinks this game is too difficult or complicated, please do not play some of the more popular metroidvanias currently out there, like La Mulana and Environmental Station Alpha, in which you have to accidentally stumble upon heavily encrypted secrets, some with no indication whatsoever, just to progress halfway through the game, and enemy cheap shots and instant kills are the norm.

I've spent about 21 hours playing through this game because I liked it so much that I wanted to complete all kinds of extra tasks (ended up with 17/20 achievements for my first playthrough) instead of beating it when I could have at probably about half that time. I've been playing video games pretty consistently since the mid 80's when I got my first Atari (and NES shortly afterward) and I've played through a lot of games since then. Metroidvanias are generally my favorite types of games, with Castlevania Symphony of the Night probably being my favorite game of all time, which I think this game has a lot in common with, as well as non-metroidvanias like Diablo (particularly the first one) that Chasm also shares some similarities with (loot drops with randomized enchanted items, one despondent town with a procedurally generated dungeon that increases in difficulty the further you descend, etc.). I think the complaint department here must not have played these hugely influential predecessors much, or at all, from the things I'm reading and also my experience with the game.

While this game may not be as sophisticated and epic as some of it's influences, it is a solid (albeit rather simplistic) metroidvania that takes clear inspiration from some of my favorites in the genre. Though the game focuses a lot on action and typical dungeon crawling elements, I actually quite liked the periodic bits of story line, NPC interactions, and lore that you discover along the way, as light as it may have been. And I only mean light in the sense of not having much dialogue and the like, not light in the setting/atmosphere. The atmosphere of this game is pretty consistently dark, just how I like it, though you do get bits of humor here and there and a beautifully rich color pallet and art direction. I would say this game plays more like SotN than anything with a charming art style more reminiscent of Momodora and an atmosphere that, too me, was just as dark as these and also reminded me a bit of Diablo I at times.

If you are on the fence about this game and have experience with the things I've mentioned here, don't just listen to the naysayers. I think you should try it for yourself. It could be newer gamers with little experience with this sort of thing, or just a couple of bad opinions that set a trend, but I think that it's one of the best purchases I've made on Steam out of about sixty games so far, most of which being metroidvanias or retro style games. I really hope that more people do try this game because I truly believe it deserves far more credit and I really hope the devs come out with more stuff like this in the future. I for one would definitely support them. Oh and one other thing. If you would like to try the map that generated on my recent playthrough, the seed is 13460422.

The endless replay value is untouched by any other and with the new Arcade Mode featuring competitive play my infinite Rogue-Vania dreams have come true.

The art, combat, music, pacing, maps, shortcuts, seeds, modes, random loot, and controls are all damn good. It feels like Rondo of Blood at times with how precise your inputs need to be in order not to get punished but the pay off is learning how to cancel animations like a God. Back dashing after attacking is the key to avoid being hit very much like SoTN. Each weapon has unique timing and cancel frames/mechanics so it teaches you when and how to commit to an attack. Chasm is very challenging to become a master at. If you can't deal with learning the art of combat you will be punished.

My only complain is the temple. There is a area called the temple in the game, there is like 14 teleport spots in the temple and game is not telling you, which teleport spot is teleporting you to which. It would have been a lot better if they've added collors to each one.

Lot of people are complaing about the mechanics, esspecially the walljump mechanic. I totally disagree, all mechanics are very good, even the walljump.

The graphics are very well made, with detailed pixel art and two options of soundtrack.

Combat is very easy to grasp, being very responsive, but hard to master. There are various types of weapons which can suit the player's gameplay style, as well a magic system which can become busted really fast and make boss fights a lot easier. There is also a dedicated dodge, which I honestly would even forget it existed as its use is very limited; it is not as useful as in Symphony of the Night, as it doesn't allow for animation cancelling.

Much like other Metroidvanias, you are gated from accessing other areas and secrets until you get a specific ability that empowers the player (called artifacts). You can also rescue NPCs in the dungeons, which will often give sidequests, and some of them are also shopkeepers.

The game has a quite high difficulty curve, as healing items are very limited at first, although save points do replenish the character's health. Enemies have specific patterns, making combat more engaging than simply hack'n slash.

My issues with this game lies in the RNG-based system, where enemies have specific drop rates on items and even weapons, but due to the limited gear and consumables to increase the LUCK stat, some items can take ages to drop, meaning you can miss a lot of stuff unless you know specifically what you need. Gold is very limited and hard to come by, and many items sold by NPCs are limited.

I watched this one through kickstarter and had a lot of interest in getting it as soon as it was released on Steam. When it finally hit, I was in the middle of another game, so I didn't rush to buy it. After that the reviews started coming in and people were not kind.

I think the initial wave of purchasers were kickstarter backers and other folks who had been watching the progress, and I don't think it lived up their expectations. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something let them down en masse.

I finally caught up and decided to pick it up on a slight sale.

Overall, I think they did a wonderful job. The graphics, music, animations and characters are all very good. Charming. The scenery is exactly what I was hoping for. Caves, dungeons, lava, spike pits, and all sorts of monsters.

The movement and keyboard controls feel great and I had no complaints in that regard. It felt like it translated my moves from my brain through my hands to the character very well.

The save points are dealt out strategically and they like to tease you a bit. The first time you go through an area, you feel like you are begging for the next room to be a save point. I liked that. They never pushed it too far. Just enough to torture you for a bit.

The enemies are all quite beatable, once you study their attacks. You probably won't make it far brute forcing everyone in the game, but for the most part they aren't terribly difficult to figure out. Loot drops are not overly generous and sometimes you get something like a weapon that isn't as good as what you already have. You can sell items you don't need anymore eventually to a friendly townsperson.

You have access to both melee weapons and some magical attacks. In the end I used both but definitely relied on my physical weapons much more, with one small exception. I used one particular magic spell when fighting bosses and it helped me a lot. I'm not great at these pattern based fighting games, and I used every trick I had at my disposal.

One note that I didn't realize would have an effect on my playthrough. Because the map is 'randomized' when you start, there is no official walkthrough that will get you through with 100% accuracy. There is some info and a walkthrough out there, but it seems like the rooms get swapped around. Still, you probably don't need one. I was just stuck at one point and didn't realize I had missed a room entirely. 

In the end, I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and got over 20 hours for a 100% (rooms and treasures) completion run on Normal. I'm not convinced I would ever replay it.

The question the game tries to answer is ""Can a metroidvania be procedurally generated?"" It turns out that it can be, but really shouldn't be. Some areas in my first instance are just long slogs through enemy infested rooms, platform challenge rooms give out crappy rewards, save rooms are in strange and inauspicious places. Some things demand a human touch.

The platforming is a decent challenge and leads to some interesting decisions about managing health and risking damage. I give the platforming an ""A"". Challenges build confidence and then cruelly take advantage of that confidence. The dev is a great talent for platforming challenges. Its only too bad that the platforming segments are sprayed haphazardly across the game's world.

Combat is easy to learn, somewhat difficult to master. Each enemy has it's own rhythm and it's up to you to use jump/dodge/attack combos appropriate for the enemy you're fighting. Timing moves and dodges are where the real challenge is at. The combat system as a whole is nothing groundbreaking but what is there is understated and accomplished.

Movement feels weird at first as you immediately lose all momentum when you stop moving forwards. Thankfully the game rarely demands that you utilize this, so it mostly just feels a little odd. Sadly there are no really special movement upgrades apart from the normal wall jump, double jump, swimming, and ledge grab.

I backed this game on Kickstarter in 2014, and while I don't regret it, the final product leaves a lot to be desired. I kinda enjoyed the time I spent with it, but despite being procedurally generated, I can't ever see myself returning to it. Let's get into it:

THE GOOD:

+ Great spritework: The art in this game is really nice. While the levels can feel a bit samey after a while, the monsters all look great, and the townspeople are memorable. The boss designs are likewise pretty cool, and their attacks are well-animated.

+ Decent controls: I don't have any real complaints here. Heavy weapons with a windup do require the Castlevania jump-and-slash technique for full control, but generally jumping and such worked well. See 'pacing' for problems with power-ups.

THE OKAY:

? Decent soundtrack: Not award-winning but it worked well enough. A bit forgettable, but it doesn't get old or repetitive, which is important.

? Arcade mode: This utilizes the procgen world design to dynamically build daily and weekly challenges, starting you at base stats and seeing how far you can go through each room (no backtracking) for a high score. Kinda neat.

? Adequate story: Nothing special, but I did like the idea of being a knight-in-training that isn't automatically treated like dirt. Following the researcher's footsteps and notes as he explored the ruins to learn about the Big Bad was also kinda neat. No complaints!

THE BAD:

- Pacing: The levels are procedurally generated, which means there's no way for the developers to properly pace the game's rewards, action segments vs. downtime, ensure regular access to save points/hub shortcuts, etc. One of the defining characteristics to a Metroidvania is its movement-granting power ups, but for me they all came in the last third of my playtime in rapid succession, meaning the first 10 hours were less enjoyable from lack of steady, incremental improvements. Double jump was the LAST ITEM I got!

- Procgen levels: See above, but additionally you'd only notice if you replay, which I don't intend to do. A lot of emphasis was put on the world generation, but it doesn't impact a given playthrough. If the world reset in areas as you played or as punishment for dying, it would've had a much greater influence and maybe made the game more interesting.

- Random drops: This is a HUGE problem. Every enemy has a set loot table, with one ""common"" and one ""rare"" drop (in addition to occasional gold and gems), but drops are incredibly scarce. Just getting a dude to drop its common item took me a good 20-30 tries of grinding, just to see what it had to offer. The luck stat doesn't seem to have any impact. For people who enjoy grinding, this is absolutely atrocious.

- Random loot: Uuugh. Every non-consumable item has a chance to drop with random buffs on it, which is nice, but this often led to a random drop absolutely outclassing every item of its slot for a long time, above difficult chest puzzles or purchased/crafted items. This further exacerbated the pacing problems mentioned above, when a random orange ring from five hours ago still beats long-running quest rewards.

- Too much loot!: There's a ton of weapons and no real variety between them. Sometimes you'll get a very special weapon (a sword that instantly unlocks a foe in the Bestiary for example), but otherwise why do you need eight spear-attack weapons that do 1 additional damage each tier? This happened to Bloodstained, too, but at least most of the low-tier weapons could be crafted into higher tiers. Not so here. Also unlike Bloodstained, you can't favorite items, so switching gear means scrolling through a huge pile of junk or selling everything.

- Some consumables needed for quests: I *hate* this. ""Shame you used that Venison to heal a few minutes ago, because I need THREE of them, and drop rates are garbage! Have fun!""

- Obnoxious pickups: A bit of an oddball, but a constant problem. Breaking lamps causes them to occasionally drop money pouches or mana orbs. However, the money pouches always drop at an angle, and lamp placement means these usually fall off the sides of platforms. If they just dropped straight down, they'd be far easier to collect, but in some rooms every single lamp's drop will plummet to the very bottom of the area. As for the orbs, they fly toward the character but can be easily dodged, meaning you've got mana-replenishing heat-seeking power ups orbiting around you instead of flying straight into you, so you have to stop and wait. Just, why?!

- Single-purpose power-ups: Three of the eight items - the diving gear, the translation book, and the lantern - are only needed for 2-3 screens and are then useless for the rest of the game. The book is especially bad, since it's handed to you one room before the door it translates, and even then the actual key item is a boss reward! At least the lantern makes a couple dark areas claustrophobic with a limited light range. Otherwise these three items are event flags and nothing more.

There are a number of lessons for what *not* to do in a Metroidvania here. I didn't hate the game, and I wish I could set a milder review score than ""Not Recommended"", but it wasn't really that fun, especially in comparison to titles like Bloodstained. I'm really sorry, Bit Kid, I really wanted to like this! If there's a Chasm 2, I'd Kickstart it all over again and hope the lessons from the first round were learned.",1563744655,1563744655,False,94,3,0.810997962951660156,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- 2D platforming
- Different load-outs?

PIck this up in the $5 range, but spend more at your own risk. I know that I wish I'd waited for this game to be cheaper, even though I bought this during the summer sale.

I PAID $13 FOR THIS FESTERING HEAP?? GEEZ. Feels bad, man.

EDIT: I absolutely forced myself to finish this game. Why? Because I wanted to be absolutely certain that I could say the following.

This game is the very worst game I have played in 2019, in 2018, in 2017, and possibly back to at least 1986. It is FULL of f-you jumps, f-you enemy placement, f-you layout (generated, yes, but the algorithm doesn't allow for certain rooms to be where they should), spaghetti-legs platforming, ""let's try to farm a thing forever"" mechanics, rubbery controls, crap wall-jumping, unimaginative weapon selection, useless combo skills for the few weapons that have them ... the whole game is some sort of enormous f-you to anyone who plays it, AND the price-point is around $10 too high. At $7.99, well, it'd still have a fantastically-bad value proposition, but $19.99 can get you a really good game, or half of a downright amazing game. The $7.99 price-point is where this game should be, as I am casting an official vote of ""no confidence"" in the developers here. They have made an un-fun exercise of ""f-you, because reasons,"" and there's no humor in it.

1. This is a real one. You have to navigate the 2D maps to gain abilities to access new areas.
2. These include things like wall-clinging and scooting under narrow passages.
3. There are cool boss battles.

Chasm has a sort of Diablo-esque structure, where there is a single main village you keep returning to from deeper and deeper into the dungeon. As you play through, you rescue villagers that can offer helpful skills or items in town. They also offer side quests to unlock more cool stuff.

Sometimes the game feels artificially long. Like they just make hallways extra long for the sake of adding playtime. Then I learned they are procedurally generated. Which I don't care for. I think the devs could have thought of a layout for the game, rather than making it random. But the rooms are handmade, just connected randomly.

Diese sind oftmals etwas ungenau (Ich sag nur Glocken im Turm) und oft ist unklar was man für welche Gegebenheit (Tür/Schrein/etc.) benötigt. 
Hier ist ab und an Youtube fällig und ein wenig Hilfe. 

Was jedoch das Gameplay anbelangt ... hier haben die Programmierer großes geleistet.
Schwierigkeitsgrad leicht ist auch leicht. 
Wer also befürchtet das ... wenn er das Spiel kauft es nicht schaffen könnte ... den kann ich beruhigen.
Wer auf leicht spielt wird es ohne Probleme schaffen ... solange er die Rätsel löst. 
Bei einigen Spielen ist es oft so dass man mit leicht problemlos spielt und dann am Endgegner verzweifelt. 
Hier jedoch haben die Programmierer endlich mal Arbeit geleistet. 
Auch hier bleibt die Schwierigkeit angemessen und beim ersten Run schaffbar. 
Hut ab.

You can't make direct comparisons as the game is not supposed to copy the experience of former popular titles. It is inspired by those older games we used to enjoy playing. I've also read review complaints that there's not enough complexity to the game play which in my opinion, complexity doesn't always mean better. In fact, simplicity can go a long way. I felt there was enough mechanics in the game to make it interesting. I also like the fact that they randomize the levels when you start a game (""seeds""), so your game play experience can change. Like Metroid, you unlock new skills such as wall climbing, edge clinging, double jump, sliding, gliding, etc, as you locate ""artifacts"" in the world. You can also purchase magic abilities which uses up mana points similar to Castlevania. You can level up and use scrolls to improve a few basic attributes. There's also an array of weapons, armor, and accessories to accommodate your play style. There's a pretty decent lengthy roster of enemies, each with their own respective AI for you to learn from and overcome.

First off, balance is brutal. I play games on Hard mode by default these days and I find Easy mode on Chasm to be [i]extremely difficult[/i] - sure, you can grind your heart out for experience and gold and go back to town all the time to restock on items to make your life easier but in a game that is already on the top tier of grind-intensive [i]and[/i] backtracking-intensive, the idea of doing even more grinding and backtracking is a major turn off for me. My last playthrough I found a ""legendary"" item fairly early on and, two hours later I still had it as my best-in-slot despite finding many new weapons and I was still getting my ass handed over to me (on Easy)!

As a roguelite, it's trivial to come out with a dozen ways to make it better: many rooms repeat multiple times (even in the same seed!); many rooms are static; meta-progression is static; ""acts"" are always the same (as are the enemies in them); items are very limited so the only form of horizontal progression to farm experience and gold to spend in town (which means failry long round-way trips)...

The biggest sin though is that there is really no reaosn to replay the game! There's no playstyle variety to try out in new playthroughs. Areas and progression being static (other than their layouts) means you've seen it all first time already. You build your town piece by piece depending on who you encounter in the dungeon but your town will largely end up looking the same each time, while vendor items are plentiful (and possibly static) so there's basically no strategy or theory-crafting to do.

... and the backtracking! Oh my god! I don't mind backtracking in something like Symphony of the Night because not only the game being gorgeous means I get to know and relate to each area and out-of-reach places effortlessly (which is next-to-impossible in a game with random map layout) but I also am always making some sort of horizontal progression - Chasm does this too with gold drops but since you will be backtracking to areas way below your current level, those are minimal and while I guess gold and the [i]extremely rare[/i] food drop do amount to something, experience gains are negligible even though lower level enemies are not much easier to fight and avoid damage from. (There's a lot more to say on backtracking later on too).

Speaking of avoiding damage, every type of enemy except a couple of the easiest ones require [i]absolute precision and instant reaction-times[/i] to avoid getting hit by (as do some of the platforming segments). Even on Easy, a veteran player will do better trying to avoid damage in a Dark Souls game than here. It often is OK because the game is built around this and you can afford to take some damage, even a hit from every enemy you fight - but with the random layouts and rooms with many enemies, I sometimes find myself completely out of health and nearly dying even after only a single room with heavy combat after I've come back to the dungeon with full health (did I mention I was using a super OP weapon too last time [i]and playing on Easy[/i])?!

Food will restore your HP but even on Easy you need every single one of those (and also maybe a scroll of summon) to survive boss fights, so if you've thought you could use health drops to heal yourself while exploring the dungeon - congratulations, you've already lost and don't even know it yet! Healing means going all the way back to the nearest teleport room (which can be multiple combat-heavy rooms away), then you enter the teleport room, then you teleport to the first area's teleport room, then go to the save point (which heals you) and then all the way back to where you started at - this can take up to 5 or even 10 minutes depending on where you are and the random layout the game created for the level. There are also more convenient in-level save rooms but I rarely ever find myself near one of those when I need to heal.

On top of the extensive backtracking you will be doing to heal or go to town to use the shops, the much, much worse and time-consuming type of backtracking you'll be doing is to find a key item in a previously-unaccesible area of an earlier level. As your map functions are minimal and teleport rooms equally so, this will often mean exploring half of that area's map all over again until you find which of the several rooms has the item you need to progress the game (and was impossible to reach when you were here originally). This easily means that half of the time you play, you are making progress while the other half or more is you re-exploring old areas, killing enemies for next-to-zero horizontal progression as mentioned, until you find the one needle in a haystack that will have the progression item to continue playing the game. 

Oh my! You don't know which level the next item is supposed to be in? Well, good luck, because now you have to repeat the process for every single level you've played before too! Maybe you will get lucky and waste only half an hour of gaming time if you guess right first try!

How hard would it be to make it so you had only to backtrack inside a given level, with only optional bonus items on earlier levels? How hard would it be to have a NPC that sells hints (""You are looking for the Lantern? Someone said they saw it on Floor 2 of the Mines"")? Chasm couldn't bother and has no respect at all for your rime.

If you are a huge Metroidvania (and in particular Castlevania) fan and buy Chasm at discount (70% off), it might be worth one playthrough - other than large amounts of dull, time-consuming backtracking and pretty high difficulty even on Easy... it's not a bad game: the controls and graphics are decent; there are a few areas to explore with many enemy types to fight; the RPG systems are serviceable... however if what made you interested in this title was the ""procedural generation"" Bit Kid proudly mentions to you as soon as possible and you expect a lot of replay-value out of your purchase, you are going to be making a huge mistake by spending any money on Chasm.

For those looking for 2D platformer roguelites, I will 100% suggest giving Dead Cells a try before this. It's not a metroidvania, it's much faster paced, it's got terrible meta-progression but it's infinitely better than Chasm as a roguelite. Even being that different, there is no reason to try Chasm before giving it a try.

Also, for free, Super Metroid nowadays has [url=https://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/]a randomizer with features like door and escape randomization[/url] and [url=https://github.com/LagoLunatic/dsvrandom]all the DS Castlevania games have one with full map layout randomization[/url].

I have bought it for the full price, and recommend it

1) Game looks as beatifull as you can see in the trailer
2) Music... well... it isn't ""CRANK IT UP IN YOUR CAR"" but it suits the areas, and Iiked music in bone area
3) ""Chasm does randomly freeze up and lag sometimes"" - I have playes 12 hours non stop, and it never had those issues, I even put it in the backgroung while watching something using chrome.
4) Even if it is randomly generated, I've never even felt like it. All areas looks complete.
5) ""Bad random loot"" - Well not everything in the chests is better then you already have it, true, but is it should be? I'll randomly get drop from monsters with better quality, so I've no complains
6) ""The rout of the game is quite boring.(Not much platforming.)"" - lolwhat there is ton of platforming
7) ""-Limited save points"" what. No limits.
8) ""-Healing items are expensive and enemies do a lot of damage"" try dodging and armour, I haven't died till third boss, and that was because I had glass cannon build (I don't count when I decided to use warp scroll for the first time to find out that 4sec warp animation doesn't make you invincible)

So, my cons would be that princess is not a princess, but is a dog
and huntress in short skirt and naked torso is a dude.

also loot drop is a bit rare. and i hate casino with passion.
though game is still pretty forgettable, it is still nice to play

What really bothers me a lot is the loot system. If you like hunting or even farming certain enemies to get a specific, strong weapon, then this game is not for you. Situations will go on two paths: if you are lucky, you can get a super strong weapon with any sort of blessing which helps you butcher through the rest the game; if you are unlucky, on the contrary, you won`t get anything useful, or even worse you can get a weaker version of your current weapon. Maybe it's just me being the unluckiest player to not get anything rewarding. OK, fine. But what about the chests in the game? The contents seem to be randomly generate. I do not like the idea of me going through a ton of traps, enemies, and platforms just to get a weapon which is worse than the current one I have. My guess is that the developers want the chest content to be random whether than fixed for the sake of multi-playthrough. Most of the metroidvania have a fixed content in the treasure chests so the player can choose whether to go after them or not. The randomness provides some sort of surprises which rewards the player willing to explore again.

I played the game on Hard (haven't tried the other lessor difficulties) and the game begins at a simple pace and then spikes with difficulty.

[list]
[*]The art for the environment are very well done and all the rooms are cleverly built. I get serious nostalgia from Donkey kong country and Castlevania on SNES. The rooms are randomized for each seed. Some rooms have appeared twice but I never saw that as an issue, since they look so nice, and the dungeons are huge anyway. This could have been an issue before though, but the recent update which added over 60 rooms probably fixed this since I have nothing to complain about.

[*]Combat is top notch! Every type of weapon has a different playstyle. Some reviews are mentioning that the game can be won by spamming attack and dodge but that must have been at launch or they only played the 10 first rooms. There are so many variations of the enemies and all of them require different tactics. You won't succeed if you think dodge will help you throughout the game. You must use different melee and magical weapons in order to stand a chance.

[*]Progression on hard difficulty (can't comment on easy and normal since I started with hard) is very nice. Every new weapon or ability you earn feels like a big improvement. Level ups come quite often but they never seem overpowered. The stats improve more from what gear you have equipped. When you have mastered an enemy (type) another more difficult appears which require a different tactic and you are forced to adapt to the new playstyle required to defeat them. This makes the game feel fresh all the time since you can't run through the levels with the same tactics.
[/list]

I'm playing with a controller on hard difficulty, and I have died a lot. I've completed about 50% in 10 hours. After you have finished you can try on another difficulty. There are 5 difficulty levels, hard being in the middle. Then there's an arcade mode with daily and weekly challanges. I would say they are pretty similar to rouge-lite since you have only one life. In the main game you can reload a save point as many times as you like of course.


As I mentioned I'm about halfway through one runthrough on hard and I have nothing really to complain about. Everything is just so well polished at the current state.

Metroidvanias are a crowded enough group that new ones really have to do something special to distinguish themselves. Some, like Chasm, have gone the questionable route of procedural generation for their levels. I say questionable because map design is an indispensable cornerstone of quality for these games, and the maps you’ll be exploring in Chasm are of questionable quality. It seems an odd trade for randomness and replayability in a genre that doesn’t value it all that much, and if not for some very solid designs elsewhere in the game I don’t think I’d be here suggesting you check it out anyway.

You are a young army recruit of the nation of Guildea, currently at war with a neighboring fantasy government. One of your key mining towns has gone quiet, and your commanding officer has decided to take the Lone Video Game Protagonist approach to investigating it. Upon arrival, you find the town deserted after strange events whisked the inhabitants away to the darkest corners of the mine. It’s up to you, then, to descend into the hostile caverns and tunnels to liberate the missing folks and figure out what disappeared them in the first place. And there’s quite a story to it, as you’ll learn by collecting the many lost journals and exploring the many lost regions of the cursed subterranean depths.

The arc of Chasm’s story is one that follows the restoration of the town and revelations about the threat you face. Hunting the lost villagers is plenty good motivation to get you through the introductory caverns and into the stranger spaces beyond, and by the time you’ve found most of the wayward souls you’ll have a very good idea of what you’re up against. While not the most unique story, it’s told with a lot of tantalizing clues and world-building details that help stretch the mystery out towards the endgame. Unfortunately, the town and its inhabitants are mostly separate from that, with very little additional insight to provide or details to flesh out the world further.

You’ll be focused on building up the town for most of the game, with most residents providing new services once rescued. The first will always be the sub-weapon merchant (unless you purposefully give her a miss), and others will offer familiar aid like potions, healing foodstuffs, equipment, and a rather frustrating slot machine to gamble on. Each person will also give you a quest once rescued, usually to find some specific item in the depths but occasionally asking for enemy drops you’ll probably have to grind for. Completing their task will earn you enhanced services or a one-time reward, though unless you’re diligent in your backtracking you may end up getting it past the point of usefulness.

Backtracking is going to be a major feature of Chasm, because of how the world is laid out. Past the mines there are five more regions to the underground, connected in various ways but progressed to in a mostly linear fashion. The game will corral you along a specific path until you find a new power for accessing areas (eight in all), and then expect you to backtrack through the areas you’ve been to to grab more loot and find the path to the next power. There’s a decent fast-travel network of caves and gates, but because of the procedurally-generated maps they won’t always be placed in very helpful places for getting where you want to go.

This ends up being my main gripe about Chasm, the procedural generation. Everything else about the game is standard metroidvania design (sometimes too old-school, like attacks freezing you in place and forcing you to use jump attacks constantly), and I can take the good and the bad well enough with the solid story and wonderful pixel art. But I cannot, for the life of me, understand why procedural generation was such a priority for this game. It makes sense for something like Dead Cells, a game you’re going to be restarting every hour or two, but not for a game that takes around 6 hours to 100%. One-and-done players are only going to see the janky map layouts, and honestly players that come back for more aren’t going to see much benefit either. Unless I got super unlucky with the three map seeds I tried, all the big loot and setpiece rooms are still in roughly the same spots, with only different hallways connecting them. There’s no creative remixing of routes or power orders here at all.

It might sound strange for me to recommend Chasm after all that, but I honestly did enjoy my time with it. It’s a very familiar metroidvania at its core, down to the combat and consumables, and it benefits from the attention shown in the writing and art. The problem is that it doesn’t innovate on these core designs, the ones that can really set a metroidvania apart, it innovates in a completely different and rather unwelcome way. I would happily trade the procedural maps for smoother combat or randomized bosses or procedural progression with different powers, because what we get here feels less than the sum of its parts. Still, it’s a good run if the maps don’t throw you off and you’re looking for more adventures in that classic, crunchy, old-school style.

El pixel art es hermoso, sin embargo, por el diseño de niveles se vuelve  monótono y aburrido.
En 2 horas de juego solo he conseguido 2 armas, 1 armadura y un anillo, peleando con los mismo enemigos recoloreados, el juego tiene habitaciones repetidas, los puntos de guardado están tan separados que mejor no los hubiesen puesto.

Sinceramente pensé que después del area de la mina, el juego mejoraría, pero no, la segunda area es aún más repetitiva, si tal vez los desarrolladores hubieran construido los niveles en lugar de usar generación procedural el juego valdría la pena.

El juego que nos ocupa hoy, de nuevo, es un metroid (mi guta muncho muncho). ¿Y como es? Pues a todos los efectos es el juego de super nintendo que nunca tuve y siempre quise.

Buen control, buena música, buen mapa (me refiero al mapa, no a los escenarios)... en resumen, todo bastante bien. Pero... ¿es perfecto? No, claro que no. Pero desde luego no es tan malo como parece ser por las calificaciones.

Desde luego que no es uno de los mejores y más originales juegos que he visto, pero la originalidad sin objetivo es un elefante blanco. A mi la originalidad me la pela. Y mucho. Lo único que me importa es que el juego sea divertido, y personalmente, ha cumplido con creces.

De modo que si eres una de esas personas que en cada juego busca algún tipo de reinvención del genero o gaitas por el estilo (cosa que me parece perfecta, cada cual tiene sus gustos), entonces mejor pasa de largo. Pero si lo único que te interesa es jugar a un juego que simplemente te aporte entretenimiento, creo que es una buena opción.

Por cierto... y esto no es que sea una pega, sino más bien una curiosidad. Este es un juego de cifras bajas. Con nv32, no he llegado a dar una jostia de 100. 
Otro dato, es que el juego viene recibiendo parches regularmente, ya sea para corregir bugs (no recuerdo haberme encontrado ninguno), como para añadir idiomas (en principio no estaba en español, ahora si), de modo que los desarroladores se preocupan del producto, cosa de agradecer.

I was disappointed by the game's lack of imagination; it didn't show me anything that I haven't seen multiple times before. The enemies, settings and story were all role-playing-game cliches. The progression, combat and platforming were all metroidvania cliches. These prefab ideas were all put together in a competent way, but I don't feel the developers added nearly enough new things into the mix.

As other reviewers have noted, the procedural level layout doesn't add anything to the game, and it can leave the levels feeling sprawling and monotonous. All metroidvania games include some aimless backtracking (especially if you're aiming for 100% completion), but Chasm was a particularly bad offender.

Lots of ups and downs in its development, done by a small team, and I have to say even if it isn't perfect, it's a darn-good entry in the Metroidvania genre.
Graphics are beautiful, and you can switch between a few different modes to make it look more NES/SNES-era or more modern.
Sound is pretty good, though I think I'd enjoy one or two additional tracks to increase variety.
Gameplay - a ton of fun IMHO. Yes it involves learning enemy patterns, and yes there's backtracking, and yes you have to learn how far/short your weapons will reach to make sure you don't die, but honestly I think it comes with the territory.
I think I would've enjoyed a little faster weapon-acquisition/gold acquisition, and a way to track the small number of sidequests (also one or two more sidequests would've been cool).

Eso está bien para un rato, pero cuando te pasas más de la mitad de la partida investigando sitios para tratar de saber por donde tirar (de las 14 horas que llevo probablemente lleve 9 sin avanzar y tengo experiencia en estos juegos) sabes que hay algo mal hecho.

-El mapa es bastante simple. No tan simple como Dead Cells de todas maneras, pero el sistema procedural no me parece bueno para este tipo de juegos. La gracia está en el laberinto bien pensado, la evolución del personaje y el backtracking todo bien mezclado, no en poner salas en cierto orden lógico para que tenga algo de interés porque para eso juego a un Mario o a un Sonic.

-No hay enemigos remarcables, ni en diseño ni en mecánicas. Todo muy típico.

-Todas las mecánicas y controles son como las del Castlevania y ya. Está bien como base pero añadir algo original estaría bien. No se porque hay tanto zote en las opiniones diciendo que ""es como un Dark Souls en metroidvania"" cuando el combate es un calco de un Castlevania hasta el punto que son exactamente los mismos hechizos.

Chasm selbst hat sich zum namensgebenden [i]Abgrund[/i] verfrachtet.
Ich würde nicht so weit gehen, dass Chasm durch und durch ein schlechtes Spiel und eher ein Daumen zur Seite als einer nach unten ist. Da mir Steam diese Option nur leider nicht bietet bin ich eher auf den Daumen nach unten angewiesen.
Chasm habe ich mir schon vor Monaten irgendwann mal gekauft. Schon da sah das Spiel nicht wirklich rosig aus. Abgesehen von der ästhetischen Seite des Spiels, aber dazu komme ich später noch.
Das große Problem von Chasm ist das Gameplay, wobei man hier zwischen dem Movement während des Kämpfens und dem des Erkundens unterscheiden sollte. Zwar fühlt sich das Movement während des Erkundens stets einen Ticken zu langsam an, jedoch gewöhnt man sich irgendwann an diese, wenn auch zu langsame, Geschwindigkeit. Beim Kämpfen hingegen fallen die Schwächen des Movements und den ebenso einhergehenden Problemen des Kampfsystems deutlich auf. Sollte man irgendwann mal einen Blick, vor und nach einem Kampf, auf die HP-Leiste riskieren, so wird auffallen, dass man große Mengen der Lebenspunkte schon nur nach einem Gegner verlieren kann. Und jetzt kommt das knifflige an der Sache. Das liegt nicht daran, weil das Spiel zu schwer ist, nein, sondern eher, weil sich die Bewegung während eines Kampfes furchtbar anfühlt! Ich habe im Forum mich schon vor Monaten über dieses Problem beschwert und auf Patches seitens der Entwickler gehofft. Es kamen zwar welche und seit dem Neuesten der auch eine deutsche Übersetzung mitgeliefert hat, dachte ich mir, dass ich es mal wieder erneut probieren möchte, aber ich habe einfach keinen Willen mehr meine Zeit mit diesem höchstens mittelmäßigen Spiel zu verschwenden.
Das Kampfsystem ist allerdings nicht durch und durch schlecht. Kämpfe sind, wenn man erstmal dahintergekommen ist, recht strategisch und irgendwann hat man eine Knopfreihenfolge verinnerlicht, wie man jeden Gegner einzeln besiegt. Etwas, dass ich schon mit größter Freude in Hollow Knight erfahren habe.
Apropos Hollow Knight. Dies ist auch ein weiteres Problem von Chasm. Es gibt bessere Alternativen zu eben jenem Spiel. Axiom Verge, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Hollow Knight, The Messenger, Ori and the Blind Forest, Owlboy und vor allem Timespinner kann ich mehr empfehlen, als Chasm. (Timespinner kommt an Chasm auch noch am ehesten heran, ähnlicher Artstil, aber ein viel besseres Kampfsystem) Und bei all diesen Alternativen hatte ich stets die Frage im Hintergrund warum ich mich überhaupt noch mit Chasm beschäftigen sollte, abgesehen davon, dass ich dafür Geld ausgegeben habe. Ich sage nein! Lieber ein paar Euro in den Sand gesetzt, als meine Zeit weiter verschwendet!
Vielleicht mag es den ein oder anderen geben dem das Kampfsystem nicht so schrecklich ist, aber dazu gehöre ich bedauerlicherweise leider nicht...

Kommen wir für die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:

[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]

+ Der Pixelart war schön anzusehen und wer möchte kann sogar einen CRT-Filter anmachen!
+ Musik macht Laune, bleibt allerdings nie wirklich im Ohr. Ist okay
+ Level UPs können strategisch genutzt werden, um seine Leben aufzufüllen
+ Es gibt eine reiche Anzahl von Gegnern. Zwar nicht auf Hollow Knights Niveau, aber immerhin
+ Mir hat die Erleichterung einen Speicherraum endlich zu finden immer wieder aufs Neue gefallen!

[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]

- Die Karte ist zu einfach gehalten. Zwar machen dies so einige der Alternativen zu Chasm weiter oben auch, aber wenigstens konnte man dort noch weiterführende Wege und Kisten per Marker markieren
- Man kehrt beim Tod ins Hauptmenü zurück. Dergleichen ist unnötige Zeitverschwendung und sollte im heutigen Spieledesign eigentlich nichts mehr zu suchen haben
- Gegner sind mehr Hindernisse als richtige Feinde, weshalb man ihnen ausweicht nachdem man den dazugehörigen Bestariumseintrag zu ihnen bereits erhalten hat. Natürlich erst nachdem man eine gewisse grindlastige Anzahl von ihnen erledigte
- Es ist sehr unbefriedigend, wenn man Schaden durch einen Gegner erhält, weil das Movement einfach dermaßen clunky ist. Ich rede dabei nicht von Eingabeverzögerung, wobei das die Situation noch verschlimmert hätte, nein, ich meine die Tatsache, dass man eine Schwertschwunganimation nicht abbrechen kann und sich so das ganze Kampfsystem unangenehm anfühlt...
- Aufgrund der Zufallsgeneration erscheinen lange Gänge, die mit langer Lauferei verbunden sind und nicht wirklich aufregend gestaltet worden sind. Selbst die Schnellreise kann nicht ohne Beinarbeit geleistet werden

[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]

+- Die Bewegung des Charakters ist etwas zu langsam. Die Möglichkeit zu sprinten wäre toll gewesen
+- Waffennutzung zu träge, da die Gegner jedoch kurz zurückschrecken, nachdem man sie attackiert hat (zumindest meistens), ist das in Ordnung, jedoch noch sehr grenzwertig
+- Ausgerüstete Kleidungsstücke verändern nicht mein Äußeres. Zwar macht das Timespinner auch, aber wenigstens gibt es noch zwei weitere Outfits als Alternativen
+- Gegner lösen leider keine Fallen aus. Ich persönlich bin stets ein großer Fan von unterschiedlichen Spielmechaniken, die sich gegenseitig ausboten können (Beispielsweise, wenn Gegner sich gegenseitig verletzen können) Leider bietet mir das Spiel dies nicht
+- Die Menüsteuerung ist mit dem Stick auf einem Gamepad zu groß, sodass man für feinere Eingaben das Steuerkreuz verwenden muss

It's way too boring and meaninglessly hard, enemies are always either walking towards you(which feels really cheap and annoying af), or just jumping on you, I felt so annoyed everytime a I met a new enemy. Basically all you gotta do is hit and spam dodge(and sometimes jump).

 Treasure chest in map made me feel like I'm playing a hentai game, they are just there to add some playtime, I nearly never used any weapon I got from chest, different weapon types feels mostly unnecessary anyway, all it matter is damage. 

 Walking around map just to see if I missed something is boring. Like when I got a new upgrade, like wall jump or slide, I need to check every missing area in my map so that I can be sure that I didn't miss anything there. I don't enjoy combat and visiting same areas again and again is feels meaningless. Like after sometime, all I do is open a new upgrade, then visit all the map again just to get pass an area I couldn't before, for each map. How is this a game? I'd prefer Demon Semen.

 I'm not a lore fan but it didn't seem like there is one. Story didn't progress in 17.8 hours too(thought I guess it counted my playtime before full release). 

 Musics doesn't make any sense and except the graphics, there is no atmosphere. And about the main character, why does he look like a kid? Aren't we supposed to be a knight or something?

Where Axiom Verge is more like an 8-bit Metroid(SciFi-Setting), Chasm is more an 16-bit Castlevania(Fantasy-Setting) with its own world.

The graphics are very nice (especially in the gardens) and evoke memories to SNES-titles sometimes during the game. The soundtrack is somehow special but always fitting. The gameplay is fantastic with very direct controls like in old 8 and 16 bit games. You have a clear ingame map and inventory, you have RPG-elements like levelling up and choosing your gear, a big variety of different weapons, armour and items to find, many different enemies, hidden secrets to discover, searching for ways to get into another area, etc.

I don't understand the criticism for the partly-generated map. In my opinion it works very well.

- Gameplay technique. Il faut savoir lire les patterns des ennemis, et on retrouve des mécaniques de combat similaires à AoS dans lequel, pour optimiser ses dps et sa mobilité, il convenait de timer ses attaques et mouvements selon des ""combos"" de type mini-saut > attaque juste avant d'atterir afin d'annuler la fin de l'animation > backdash > attaque dès les premières frames du dash pour l'annuler et porter un deuxième coup quasi successif au premier.
Ici dans Chasm, un coup porté pied à terre vous maintiendra plusieurs longues frames en position fixe pendant la complétion de l'animation d'attaque, ce qui semble très lent quand on s'est habitué aux jeux plus contemporrains comme Deadcells. C'est pourquoi il est vite essentiel de maîtriser ces techniques d'optimisation, le jeu s'avèrant assez difficile dans ses deux derniers chapitres si on joue trop ""conventionnellement"".

- Possibilité de chnager d'armes, dont le type modifie la portée, la vitesse, et la zone d'effet de vos attaques (par exemple une lance aura une longue portée avec vitesse d'attaque moyenne, une dague aura une portée très courte mais sera plus rapide, tandis qu'une hache sera très lente mais offrira une zone d'attaque verticale permettant de toucher des ennemis au-dessus de vous).

- Graphismes pixel-art très soignés, DA plutôt classique mais bien maîtrisée. Personnellement je trouve le jeu magnifique.

Il est clair que si vous attendez de Chasm un jeu rapide aux standards d'aujourd'hui, avec du nouveau contenu débloqué à outrance au fil de la progression au sein du jeu, vous serez très probablement déçu. Le nombre d'objets et équipements est très limité, l'aquisition de nouvelles compétences est lente (on reste coincé sans double saut pendant une eternité), et la génération procédurale n'apporte vraiment pas grand chose au jeu (j'aurais préféré une map fixe sur laquelle il aurait été possible de se lâcher bien plus au niveau visuel notamment). Chasm s'adresse davantage aux nostalgiques du genre, et même si je ne suis généralement pas très réceptif au rétro-gaming, j'ai fort apprécié la poignée d'heures passée sur ce petit jeu.",1543030124,1543188024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What's Wrong With This Game:
The game is missing some of the updates from the recent years such as quirky, or charming characters to have some form of a comic relief during the gameplay. Other reviews expand on the issues in this game in greater detail than what I will provide here. But while playing, I could not help but compare Chasm to Owlboy. Owlboy does majority of the things better. It has abilities that you character gets that change up the gameplay while Chasm remains a sidescroller. There's a lot to write about what could have been different. But the game is already finished so, there's no going back.

Lastly, I want to state that I think this is a good game, but it is only for those that have played old school sidescrollers. This is more of a pure sidescroller than a game like Owlboy. So you'll enjoy it if you keep your expectations in check. But I don't know if I really enjoyed playing it... I still recommend buying it, and trying it out yourself to see if it's what you're into. I'd give this game a 7/10.",1542317918,1542317918,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Enjoyed the playthrough but don't think I'm motivated to play through again, which renders the procedural generation system a bit pointless for me.

The Good:
- Solid combat and platforming with a nice choice of weapons and spells.
- Looks great. Pixel art is on point in all 5 worlds. Great ambiance.
- Decent music and sound effects. Though the music can start to grate a little when lost and looking around for extended periods (more of a metroidvania issue than just this game though)

The Bad:
- The procedural generation. This seems to be done once at the start of the game, locking in the seed for the rest of the playthrough. I didnt get the impression I missed anything or left any threads left to be discovered so didnt feel like replaying, meaning I never saw any value in the procedural gen. I guess if you loved your first playthrough and felt there was more to discover this would be pretty cool though.
- The story. Somewhat bland on this front, no real twists or shocks along the way. Nor was there any real stand out characters.
- Challenge. Playing on standard difficulty I only really died to standard enemies whilst mucking around trying to find the next objective. Managed to just tank through almost every boss without learning movesets on the first try.

To be honest, if you're looking for more of the same Chasm is exactly what you're expecting it to be. There's not much new here, and what it does well is done better elsewhere. Combat isn't as bland as most reviews make it out to be, but the killer of this title is the map design: the random generation removes any real cohesion between rooms and makes the game bland very quickly.

The gameplay feels very much derived from Symphony of the Night, but without many of the toys that are fun to mess with and/or use to completely break SotN.

That's Chasm's thing. The combat is deliberate, so much so that it occasionally resembles a Souls-like. There's an RPG system, but your character attributes will stay firmly in the double digits, even at end-game. The excellent pixel art is almost shockingly understated, as is the music. Narrative elements are so light-touch that they're barely there.

I like the restraint. A lot of games (triple-A games especially), utterly terrified that you'll get bored, just throw [b]stuff[/b] at you. Loot. Enemies. Features. Abilities. Spectacle. The result is often a sloppy game that has no idea what it's actually good at. Chasm, meanwhile, feels confident. They understand the experience they're trying to create, and have provided a thoughtfully considered path through their game.

If BitKid were just making an action game (something like Volgarr the Viking), this would all be great. As you know, however, Chasm presents as an exploration game — a Metroidvania. The restraint comes off more as stinginess here. Exploration games need [i]treats[/i] to entice the player through all of those corridors. They need [b]STUFF[/b]. Unfortunately in Chasm, a long trek down a dead-end is likely to reward you only with a potion, or a weapon no better than what you're currently using. More even than loot, an exploration game needs moments of transcendence to offset all that aimless wandering. Chasm isn't interested in providing cool setpieces or great character moments though, and the boss encounters aren't ambitious enough to truly stick in the mind.

Still, I enjoyed my time with Chasm. Playing on Hard, combat was a good challenge. I felt I had to learn each enemy's pattern in order to thrive, and so every first encounter with a new enemy was meaningful. At least, until I discovered how exploitable magic becomes late-game. I don't know if I [i]recommend[/i] Chasm, but it's a rock-solid foundation, and with some post-launch content support, it might yet stake a claim in the pantheon of great Metroidvanias.

The game is a bit of a let down, crippled mostly by the modular procedural map generation.  Which turns the game into a hedgemaze of similar looking rooms with nothing interesting in them.  I could ask myself a thousand times why they thought procedural generation was the way to go, and I will never find an answer.

Another devastating problem is that the player is tasked with completing several quests for people in the town.  Some are fine, but others will have you farming the same monster over a hundred times to collect 5 copies of the item it drops at a 1% droprate.

The combat, while interesting at some points, is mostly clunky.  Attacking has an extremely limited range and will bring your character to a full stop for an excessive amount of time.  Lots of games have this issue, but none to the extent that Chasm does.  Basically every point of damage you take will be because you attacked an enemy and they immediately attacked you back while your character finished his animation.  The classic Castlevania ""jump cancelling"" exists, but has been watered down to not be anywhere near effective enough.  You'll find yourself taking the longest range weapon you can find in order to just outrange your opponents, which usually comes at the cost of attack power, forcing you to spend ridiculous amounts of time killing a single enemy.

There is some issue that this game has with giving out money that is utterly bewildering.  You'll find yourself starved for cash throughout the game, which isn't a huge problem because for most of the game there is nothing worth buying.  Later on when money does become a necessity, the only decent way of obtaining it is a slot machine game that is beyond tedious.  Also to get coins for the slot machine you have to play a card matching game that is, you guessed it, also unbelievably tedious.

The music ranges from adequate to abyssmal, and you'll be hearing a lot of it as you backtrack through areas just to enter a single room that was inaccessible before and obtain an irrelevant weapon.

The plotline is completely forgettable.  I think I killed the demon king of the world or something at one point and it meant literally nothing to me.  I should also note I am a massive lore nerd and really did try to give a shit, I read every document I came by fully, talked to every NPC, and at no point did I ever care what was happening.

I was not able to finish the game because I ended up at a point where I needed to either backtrack through everything to find the next wing of the dungeon or complete a 1% droprate quest, I don't know which.

I hate to be so negative, because I'm well aware of how much time and effort was put into the game.  The artwork especially is nothing but stellar, some of the best pixel art in any current game.

7/10 Very good first playthrough; Needs updates to encourage multiple playthroughs.

Solid game on a first playthrough and has very good replay POTENTIAL. Now, I put emphasis on potential because the game still needs a lot of work on the randomizing aspect that the developers sell as part of the main course meal. The randomizer seems not to impact the location of anything important in the game. All important items, bosses, and NPC's are in the same spots every time, and there are no alternate bosses or enemies for each area. In fact, it seems like all the randomizer does is choose from about 3 options for every connector room, maybe split into a few smaller rooms or one larger room with slightly different layouts and enemies, and any room with any importance whatsoever seems to have the same layout, in the same position on the map, on every seed. The randomizing aspect, simply put, is very underwhelming from what you would expect a randomizer to do. 
For updates, more map randomization and item randomization is a must. More bosses, more enemies, more artifacts, more items, and varying enemy drops would be nice. 
Another small thing I personally noticed is that the luck stat didnt seem to have any noticable effect on my playthroughs. It seems as though I got just as many enemy drops with 5 luck as I did with 50 luck.

The art of this game is amazing. Great visuals and great music. Howeve, everything else falls short. The rooms are all to similar and boring. You have mostly long hallways broken up by vertical hallways with ""challenge"" rooms thrown here and there. Don't bother exploring or backtracking because the rewards are hardly worth the time let alone the effort.

The procedural generation only serves to make each playthrough TECHNICALLY different. In practice, your next game will play exactly as it did as the last. Instead of flat hallway 1, you will get flat hallway 2.

The combat it decent, but you can cheese through the whole game using the overpowered magic. There is a backdash, but it's mostly never usable. You're almost always better off jumping or walking backwards.

* Music's OK
* Pixel art graphics are pretty good

This game was announced on Kickstarter back in 2013. They 'estimated' the game would be released in mid-2014. A mistake on that front. I don't just mean because the game came out four years after its estimation, but the amount of metroidvania games that have come out in that time frame... so many are far more interesting, clever, and beautiful frankly. The novel element of Chasm is that it's procedurally generated. You can re-explore the game with changed up rooms, puzzles, enemies, et cetera. I know that will be great for some people, but it's just 'there' for me.

When this was still a kickstarter, A lot of people & I commented that we'd love if there was at least a secondary lady protagonist.
The dev that replied to me basically told me that the story was incredibly important to the game, and the protagonist being who they already were was 'important,' and that a [reskin to have at least a secondary female protagonist] was just far too much work to change the story.

There are no pronouns or gendered language used for the protagonist at any point in the entire game. The interesting elements of the story & lore are about the past, the eldritch deity, and past explorers. The importance of the protagonist is little to nothing, and the gender couldn't be important as it never even came up.

They set the goal for a female protagonist extraordinarily high for the low effort it would have required. While it is pretty easy to see the protagonist as a relatable butch lesbian, and I absolutely did. Making it to the end without ""the important story purpose"" coming up a single time felt like a joke to me.

Chasm feels like it would have been more appealing had it not been delayed so many times and released in 2014 (or was it 2015??). Unfortunately everything that chasm does is eclipsed by other games in the genre that have released in the past few years. Even its procedural generation does not do much to set it out from its competitors, resulting in maps that feel overly stretched out and singular in their pathways for the most part, unlike the densely layered and flexible pathways that open up through progression in other games. The map's straggling woes become more apparent in the awkwardly placed fast traveling system. The game's lack of memorable characters and enemy design works against it nowadays, and whilst the art is pretty, its over-reliance on fantasy tropes sticks out when placed against its competitors

Unfortunate that the game's release was so close to Dead Cells coming out of Early Access; though the games do very different things, it's easy to make certain comparisons.

One of the features that the game touts is its randomized level design. Rooms themselves are prefabricated, but the rooms are joined together in a different arrangement for each new save file (the finalized maps are assigned to a seed, so it's possible to replay the same one or share yours with a friend). There is some novelty to this, but ultimately it only serves to increase replay value somewhat and to make it difficult to seek help if you find yourself getting stuck (which is fairly likely for first-time players).

The game is divided into several biomes, each with its own sub-map, its own enemies, and its own mobility roadblock to overcome. Functions like ledge-grab, slow-fall, wall-kick, and double-jump are gradually unlocked as you progress through the game, and the unfortunate side-effect to this is that portions of the early stages feel clumsy to navigate without them. Platforming in certain portions of the beginning zones can feel a little too punishing when you don't wait until the last pixel to initiate that standard-jump. Add monsters that throw bombs or fly at you, and you've got a recipe for some very frustrating jumps. There is a small amount of satisfaction to be had from revisiting a zone with new upgrades in order to reach That Chest From Earlier, but it's criminally underused. When you get a mobility upgrade, you may feel compelled to do another lap of every previous zone, because who knows if that chest you couldn't reach contains a Key Item, a permanent HP/MP increase, or just a piece of equipment that you don't want to use. Because some of the linear pathing is not very clear, you may stumble on a bunch of optional stuff while searching for the correct way forward. 

One of first objectives you are given is to find the missing townspeople. There are about a dozen NPCs in the town of Karthas, most of whom have vanished under mysterious circumstances. Despite being your clearest objective, very few of the rescues are actually required in order to complete the game. In most cases, a rescued character living safely back in town will give you a side quest (typically ""fetch this Key Item for me"") or begin to function as some sort of shop. You'll want to buy a subweapon from the witch as soon as possible.

Each zone culminates in a boss fight, as one would expect, and boss fights will be the primary road block (and potion-sink) to advancement. The story gradually unfolds, and you force your way through increasingly resilient enemies, constantly backtracking to see which unfinished path has become accessible after your newest upgrade. The game feels more fun as you gain more control of your own movement, but I personally don't feel hooked enough to replay it any time soon.

It's worth playing, but don't expect to be blown away.

I am happy to report that all of those years of waiting have paid off with what is one of the most polished, mechanically sound and gorgeous Metroidvania games on the market today. 

Some might say that this game is generic or that it doesn't do anything particularly well but I couldn't disagree more. Chasm is a game that comes from a place of love and reverance for the classics, especially Castlevania Symphony of the Night. The way that Chasm plays is so close to SotN in terms of mechanics that you would think Bit Kid somehow got their hands on the original game engine and adapted it to their game. When you stop and remember that this game was built from the ground up you begin to realize how expertly crafted the whole thing is.

Bit Kid poured their heart into Chasm and it shows. The variety of weapon types allow for myriad play styles. The magic spells you acquire act like subweapons from Castlevania games and expand your arsenal nicely. The map is exact and informative and lets you place down markers in areas you'd like to revisit. I will say that having options for different marker types or colors would have been a nice touch but it's not a necessity. Every area is beautifully rendered in what I can only describe as some of the finest pixel art I've come across. Your character feels weighty in a way that lends some realism to movement and combat. The music isn't anything overly melodic but it is very effective at establishing the mood of each area, and the town music is especially nice with it's accoustic guitars reminiscent of Tristram themes of old. Speaking of the town, as you are exploring you rescue town members that are sent back to become shops, mini-games and quest-givers which is a strong incetive to explore everywhere.

One aspect of the game that really needs to be stated apart from the rest is that every time you start a new game you are getting a randomly generated seed which is going to change dungeon layouts, item locations and the like. For such a polished game to also grant you immense replay value in the form of proceduraly generated worlds is a huge accomplishment. The seed can be typed in manually too if you want to play the same one as a friend.

I am truly saddened to see that at the time of writing this review Chasm sits here with an undeservedly middling aggregate rating of Mixed. I understand that Chasm might not introduce new mechanics never before seen in the genre. I understand that some people have come to expect games to revolutionize and reinvent the ground other games have tread already. What I don't understand is why a game like Chasm that does a fantastic job of implementing core design elements, features and mechanics integral to the Metroidvania genre doesn't get praise for achieving that. This is a game that serves as a reminder of what people fell in love with when they first picked up a quality Metroidvania game. Chasm should serve as a standard of quality when it comes to modern iterations of the genre.",1537227925,1537227967,True,2,1,0.49135667085647583,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The only definite positives I can muster are the art looks astounding and the music suits the game (although none of the tracks are very memorable). Unfortunately everything else with this game is lackluster at best or very disappointing at worst. If you want more detailed info as to why I think this, then you can read my essay below lol

- Combat is clunky, and not in a way that feels weighty or purposeful. When you swing your weapon you are grounded in place, so the only skill in weapon usage revolves around canceling your jumping attack animation by landing, so you can act again almost immediately and attack/jump/dodge as needed. You do have magic but there is almost no point in using anything other than the magic knives, as they are quick, cost efficient and reliable at long range. The enemy design and variety is good, but combat never evolves beyond attaining magic and then upgrading your numbers.

- The artifacts you find to improve your character are uninspired and boring. I'll spare you spoilers for everything else, but I will say that the best upgrade you will find in this game is a double jump and that is very late into the game. The lack of mobility is what killed my enjoyment the most; not only does combat feel clunky, but so does moving around the world, and that is never remedied with a new artifact (as much as I hoped it would). And the last two ""artifacts"" are extremely disappointing (one of which could only be used in literally two spots in my world generation).

- World design is incredibly lackluster. Not just in the art direction of the zones, but how the world is generated does not add to the game in any meaningful way, and in my opinion, detracts from the experience. The only area that felt like it had some purposeful thought put into it was the start of the Catacombs, as the rest of the game is just hallways, challenge rooms and boss fights. Compounded by the fact that mobility never feels good, having to backtrack through tons of long hallways was extremely boring, especially when there was platforming involved.

[i]Chasm[/i] was clearly inspired by the [i]Castlevania[/i] games but they didn't seem to iterate on what made those games fun and instead chose to focus on procedural generation (and I have a feeling that that is what hurt the development of [i]Chasm[/i] the most). I wanted to love this game as much as I love [i]Symphony of the Night[/i] or [i]Aria of Sorrow[/i], but I could never justify the time/sanity commitment to filling out the [i]Chasm[/i] bestiary, unlike in [i]AoS[/i], where I have no problem grinding out 100% soul completion.

So, I'm a LITTLE vested in my expectations for it.

Basic metroidvania platformer, but with a basic RPG (gear and weapons, stats,  but no stat tree or skill tree).  
However, my seed was a bit more linear than I expected.  Yeah, there was some backtracking but I should have saved most of that for the end as only one or two rooms outside of the main path would really open up with each new skill.

The battling was fair, as enemies broadcast their attacks and you can dodge back quickly.  
I heavily relied on the magic daggers, those are unbalanced in your favor so level them early.

No real point in grinding, better to explore a little more and find stat boosters in the game.

I did hit a skill wall where 3-4 new skills were compiled on me once.  (sawblade walls, in the dark, with wall jump, followed by new poison enemies in the dark).  Also, it was missing a downward mid air attack that could have improved fights.

Other than that, it was fair.  Enjoyable, I didn't get all the achievements, but am happy with what I did.  I could probably get 2 more pretty quick, but the last 3 would require another playthrough (one without deaths?? nothankyou)",1536644038,1536644038,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I was following it because Metroidvanias with RPG aspects are my shit.

Game's too short. I was convinced that since it was taking so long to develop, it would be quite the game. The procedurally generated maps means very few secrets and upgrades you find throughout the game. You can backtrack once you get upgrades to find some treasures, but hardly anything feels meaningful. The controls are mostly good, the walljumps feel a little weird though.

I dunno. I'd be a lot more positive if it was a $10 game, but it's $20. I'm trying to avoid comparing it to other games, but Hollow Knight is in every way its superior.

The game had no ""early release"" stage where demands of players could be developed on the fly. So of course we have a full game (good as it is) which will without a doubt only get better with updates.

As I write this review I have almost 10 hours in the game. How much would it cost you to get 10 hours of enjoyment at a movie theater, or a club? The 20 bucks is a no brainer and the future updates are just icing on the cake.

I thought all the downvotes were wrong. Turns out, I was. This game is sadly very medoicre. The levels are not that great. There's a lot of unnecessary precision platforming. I don't want pixel perfect jumps all over the place in a metroidvania - especially when you are forced to constantly revisit the same rooms over and over and over again. 

There's tons of backtracking. That's fine, this is a metroidvania, I expect that. But because the game is procedurally generated, warp points are inconvenient. None of the warp points I've hit so far have actually been useful in returning to a place I need to go. They're all just sortof 'in the middle' so you still have to walk through a dozen rooms to get to the thing you want to check out. And walk through the exact same enemies again, except this time they give you 1/1000 of the xp you need to level, so you just jump over them because they're now worthless. 

And as for getting around the game, unfortunately, NONE of the upgrades I've gotten so far (5/8) have increased my _speed_ to get from point A to point B. You're doing the exact same rooms, over and over again, with zero improvement. Great, you got the ability to grab on a ledge. Doesn't let you get through rooms faster, or grab onto *platforms* because those are different. Great, you got the ability to wall jump. Doesn't let you get through rooms faster, because it's super limited in how it works. 

And lets talk about the wall jump. Doesn't work the way every other game does wall jumping - which actually makes it really frustrating to do that. You have to push into the wall to jump away from it - if you push away from the wall before jumping, you fail. /sigh. 

Like I said, I really wanted to like this game. 

The characters you meet in the game seem interesting, but they all have one fetch quest and then they sell you stuff. Not super exciting. Different weapons are ok at best - I haven't come across a 'wow' weapon. Just three basic types - dagger, sword, club - which you occasionally want to switch between to hit inconvenient enemies, but switching weapsons is inconvenient in itself.

Where the neutral review option? It's 2018 and there still isn't one. Wtf, Valve....

Everything that you've read in most of the major gaming outlets (PC gamer, Destructiod, RPS, etc.) is all true. This game is exactly what these outlets have said about Chasm. The procedural generation produces bland, monotonous  rooms. The biomes are bland and repetitive. There aren't enough monsters, and even more damning, there isn't enough [i]variation[/i] of monsters. This games deserves every one of the 7/10 ""meh"" reviews.

So, why am I giving this game the thumbs up? Mainly because I cannot place it in the grey, neutral/MEH zone. Did I have fun with this title (initially)? Yes. Here are my thoughts:

First and foremost, this game became very boring, monotonous, and vapid by the third biome for me. I'm surprised I held out for that long....

[olist]
[*]Chasm is, for all intents and purposes, a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (SotN) knockoff. This game wants to pride itself as belonging to the ""Metroidvania"" subgenre, but I fail to experience or see the Metroid part of that portmanteau. The developers, Bit Kid, will say that Chasm is ""influenced by"" or ""pays homage to"" the SotN spin-off franchise, but it's hard to see past such modesty when they actively have Konami's testicles deep in their mouths. Even to say that Chasm is a SotN ripoff doesn't do it justice because it also takes several elements from the other SotN derivatives (Aria of Sorrow, Harmony of Dissonance, Circle of the moon, Portait of Run, etc., etc.). So, we're talking an egregious derivative of derivatives!
[*]I still do not understand why indie developers spooge in their pants over the awful nostalgia-driven, hispter bait, pixel art. The background images present in the game look great. Many of the character sprites and animations do not, however, because they exhibit too much awful pixel trash art.
[*]Why do developers still cling to that awful trope of having their character sprites being contantly in motion. Does everyone in this world have palsy?
[*]The music in Chasm leaves a lot to be desired. It's borderline grating. I can appreciate not having a bombastic, orchestral score, but I would appreciate something that's immersive. As it stands right now, all of the tracks I heard sound like the generic muzak produced by royalty-free musician, Kevin Macleod. Seriously, Bit Kid, HIRE A REPUTABLE SOUND DESIGNER!
[*]The biomes in this game could definitely use some TLC. Not enough variation. Not enough life. Also, the catacombs were seemingly ripped straight from SotN down to the ossified background.
[*]There needs to be more monsters, AND greater variation.
[*]You're most likely not playingChasm for the story, but if you were/are, you're out of lucky, Matey McMate mate. The non-story present is enough to be completely not immersed nor interested in the lore and backstory.
[*]While the backslide is stolen directly from SotN and its derivtives, I will appluade this game for actually making it necessary in combat and not just an over-glorified way to move about the game.
[*]I will also applaud this game for having a fairly intricate comabt system in comparison to SotN. It's not simply just ran, hack, jump, hack, etc. You actually have to time your attacks, otherwise you're going to get blasted and take unnecessary damage. Some of the attack patterns/rhythms and hitboxes can be quite obtuse in some instances, though.
[*]Chasm has a straight-forward, clean UI. The inventory management system, character stats, menus are all clear and easy to navigate.
[*]Full controller support (tested with both official Steam controller and PS3 controller). This always gets props from me.
[*]The difficulty (played on Normal) is right in that sweet spot of not being not being too hard, but still has times of being difficult.
[*]Some sound effects were straight up pilfered from SotN. The greatest example is the sound the Knife and most swords make. Compare that to the sounds of the Baselard or the Crissaegrim in SotN. I seriously do not understand how Konami hasn't DMCA'd this game and sued Bit Kids yet. This isn't to say that the sound effects are bad. In my opinion, they are quite good. Some just sound a little too ""familiar.""
[*]Chasm adopted the awful hand-holding some of the handheld (hyuk...) SotN-derivatives had, in that the map displays a dot on areas of the map that contain unopened chests or tiles you cannot interact with yet.
[*]Further exanding on the previous point, the map mysteriously doesn't display room additions where you've walked through the wall (i.e. a secret room).
[*]Chasm's controls are tight and responsive. Highly important, and Bit Kids nailed this.
[*]The CRT Mode option is a great edition. Despite the aforementioned pixel art, the rest looks like it came straight from the SNES
[*]There are woefully not enough secret areas (i.e. breakable walls, ceilings, floors; hidden areas; puzzles; etcetera) present in the game. Bit Kid, please ADD MORE!

Now for the not so good, in no particular order: the music, the combat, the loot, the rng, the enemy layout, the traveling system, the economy.

This game has forced combat method if you engage - and by that I mean you MUST fight with the enemy attack pattern in mind, or you will have a bad time, so prepare to play counter-attack for 10 hours.

Playing this I decided very early on due to the tediousness of combat I would not go for 100% drops. About halfway through I figured, I would go for it. I waited until levl 35 or so, with full luck gear to back track for those drops that I was missing.

20 hours later I finished, with many of the rares taking 2 hours or more. I began letting myself die to save the trip back to a save point to save time. I then began investing in high tonics, to spam dagger throw to kill from a distance and quickly, or injuring and using the emerald dagger for the finishing blow to increase drop rates.

It was the most absolute unenjoyable completionist run of any metroidvania I've ever had. I still have to go through the ""Mortal Mode"" for the last achievement, but the inability to skip the intro scene / setup makes restarting runs a pain when trying out nightmare mode.

Astoundingly mediocre. It's not offensively bad, but it's not particularly good either. It's stuck in the old-timey Metroidvania ways of the past, denying the player the ability to attack while moving unless they exploit their superior air control. It even directly apes Castlevania: Symphony of the Night's control scheme, which is dated and kind of unwieldy. If the developers had a time machine and somehow released this game in this state five years ago, it would have been a huge hit. But as of now, it's unfortunately overshadowed by other similar games that have taken a more modern approach to the genre.

I've played through all but the final area on hard and have felt like the difficulty was fair. I don't hate the game, and I've enjoyed my time with it. The spritework is great, the animation is gorgeous, and the music is good... It just feels pretty repetitive, and the limited procedural generation of the dungeon doesn't make it feel unique enough to overcome the lack of enemy variety. Or the stale enemy placement. Or the lack of variation to enemy attack patterns. Or the lack of abilities the player has to attack or evade with at any given time. Or how there's almost nothing to ever interact with in the environment. Or how frustratingly lengthy the fast-travel system is.

There's an entire laundry list of problems, really, and a large number of them exist specifically because of the bad habits Chasm picked up in pursuit of Symphony of the Night. But even if it's not ferociously pushing the genre forward, Chasm is doing some interesting things, like incorporating some mild survival elements by limiting the inventory of NPC shops. And the game is slowly getting better. If Bit Kid continues to work on it post-release like they have been, I believe they'll overcome most of the bigger issues it currently has.

I feel like that one sentence can summarize a lot of the indie games that have out in the last few months. I backed Chasm on Kickstarter, and after a long wait...the result is kinda meh. Not bad, but certainly not great.

To get to the high points of the game first, graphically Chasm is a nicely drawn and animated 2D pixel art game, in the style of the 16bit era of consoles. The monster designs are well done, well drawn, and well animated. The player character is as well. The dungeon areas have distinct looks and biomes and again are well drawn. Sound design is functional though nothing spectacular, and the music is decent but unmemorable.

The core idea of Chasm is the semi-random map generator: the devs created rooms, but how areas of the map are pieced together from those room do change somewhat, as well as item placement in chests and NPCs you can discover to repopulate the town above the dungeon. In practice, it works OK. Again- impressively functional but not great. It does what it's supposed to, but you can't really have memorable areas if you don't hand place everything and you have to limit the shapes of the rooms so it works with your generator.

More problems come in the movement abilities- which are very clunky. Backdashes have a noticeably delay which makes them useless for dodging. There are also delays when ""attaching"" to walls and ledges with the wall jump or ledge hang abilities, which makes it feel way way worse than every other Metroidvania ever.

Then finally come the enemies and weapons. They're decently animated and designed, however the enemy attack patterns are fairly repetitive for 75% of the game. In addition, due to how weapon hitboxes come out and a strange design choice where landing from a jump resets your attack swing, the optimal gameplay for 90% of enemies is to continuously jump over their head and do two attacks. Nothing terrible 'wrong' with it, but a bit boring and not a great design.

And that's pretty much it. The theme of it all: Chasm is 'fine', but it's not particularly 'great'.",1535480817,1535480817,False,28,0,0.74605560302734375,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You explore areas in a 2d environment, gather items and abilities, unlock new areas as you progress and fight the occasional boss. There are spells to cast, weapons have different speeds, ranges and damage numbers, and you can level up your character as well. Bigger and heavier weapons are usually more cumbersome to use than light weapons, affecting for example the length of the attack animation.

The levels you explore are also somewhat procedurally randomized each time you start a new game, altough I feel the changes aren't drastic enough that you should even notice a difference while playing. There are six different areas/tilesets which doesn't feel quite enough, but isn't horrible either. Exploring is generally fun, but can get tedious if you happen to backtrack through an area for the fifth time.

Сквозь орды нечисти мы спускаемся в бездну, разгадывая тайну древнего короля. Поначалу игра весьма радует - шикарный пиксель-арт, хорошее управление, интересные и разнообразные враги. Из минусов можно подметить только сюжет уровня ""для галочки"", музыку (в каждой зоне свой унылый отрезок в несколько секунд, повторяющийся бесконечно) и отсутствие визульного разнобразия на уровне - за небольшими исключениями каждый огромный уровень сложен из примерно одних и тех же невыразительных тоннелей.

Но чем дольше играешь, тем яснее становится главный для меня недостаток - нефункциональная карта, на которой обозначена только общаая структура уровня и некоторые точки интереса (далеко не все). Мы постоянно встречаем непроходимые пока препятствия, алтари на которые нужно положить то, чего у нас пока нет и т.д. Большинство из этого на карте не отображатеся. А если отобраатеся, то просто точкой или синим квадратиком. То есть когда мы находим например фонарик, то приходится обходить все уровни, в поисках мест куда раньше было не пройти из-за темноты.

Все бы ничего, но уровни большие, и монстры респавнятся когда мы покидаем экран, и местами присутствуют довольно сложные участки с платформами, шипами и прочим. И чем дальше проходишь, тем больше эта проблема усугубляется. То есть, например, чтобы посетить еще раз арену, мне придется обыскивать вообще весь уровень (хорошо еще если помнишь на каком она уровне). В общем, потратив 3 унылейших вечера на поиски алтаря, на которой надо положить очередную цацку, коротый я точно где-то видела но не помню даже на каком уровне, я поняла что пора бросать игру и заняться чем-то поинтереснее. Например, смотреть как сохнет краска. 

То есть основной челлендж в игре - это не интересные монстры, не сложный платформигнг, а хоеновая карта. Игра не уважает время игрока, поэтому не могу ее порекомендовать.

After five years of waiting, Chasm finally arrived! I got the honor of interviewing James after the convention (E3 I think?) where I saw it, and have been checking out some of the early builds over the years. The final product is a game that I fine very satisfying, both directly and subtly full of nostalgic references (gelatinous cube from D&D, something like the mushboom from Secret of Mana, and the vine crawling bug from Super Mario Bros 2 and likely other games) all wrapped in a non-vampiric Castlevania SotN-like wrapper. 

The art and animation are rather beautiful in a modern retro style, audio design of both music and sound effects (and their timing) are solid, proportions of character size relative to movement speed and jump height are extremely comfortable and easy to work with, and bugs are both minimal and comical (and get fixed when you report them in Discord). The flow of gameplay is fun and satisfying, and I'm already on my fifth run now that the Class system has been added. 

Bug fixes and the class system represent just the tip of the iceberg for this game's future. There's and obvious late-game event that appears to set the stage for future content to be added.

It has amazing art and animation.  The one thing I somewhat dislike is that after using an auto attack you character has a momentary follow through animation you cannot cancel or break so you really have to learn how to be proficiency with attacking.

The game IS challenging and is NOT going to hold your hand.  It is like Super Metriod from the Super Nintendo and often does NOT give you guidance on where to go or what to do.  It relies on you knowing how to use your map and have the ambition to explore areas left uncharted.  Along with having the same relative upgrade system that means some areas are inaccessable until you get the appropriate artifact to go back and explore it.

The game, does it right.  It takes an old SNES platformer and makes it feel so very modern.  For the youth of this generation, this is what good games were like in the 90s/early 2000s.  This game was a brilliant nostaligia throw back to that time period and it added so much more.  The RPG inventory system is so much fun.  You get excited with every new item or piece of gear you get.  The one real disappointment in that regard is that late game gear you find or craft is virtually worthless if you found some of the better items.  I felt like for sure the crafting items because of how long it would take to acquire the ingots should have been the better tier gear.. but it was not.

Absolutely LOVED this game IMO.  It was so much fun.  And despite a few frustrations it was an overwhleming positive experience.  I am greatly looking forward to replaying the game on their Hardcore mode perma death setting.  

If you are looking to play a game that guides you.. holds your hand.. gives you quest markets.. probably best you pick another game.  This game is not meant for people that need that level of hand holding.  It is meant to challenge your intellect and make you figure things out.  For those that truly invest into the game you would not be disappointed.  Walk in understanding that this is not a modern style game thats made easy for your convenience.

I was instantly drawn to it based on its artstyle. Its pixel art is very reminiscent of classic Gameboy Advance games, while not actually being directly derivative, and I'm a big fan of it.

Seemingly forever since then (It turns out indie development can be slow) it's finally here. So what did they deliver?

Chasm is a metroidvania (heavy on the vania) game with a slight procedural twist: Your gameworld is procedurally generated when you start the game. But this isn't a rogue-like or rogue-lite or whatever you want to call it. This gameworld stays consistent the entire game. The procedural generation, then, is purely a feature to add replay value. I admittedly have not played it through more than once, so I can't say how much the game world changes between games. The map seems to tend a little too much toward long corridors and vertical shafts in between large rooms, which I assume is due to the its procedural nature. 

In terms of gameplay, Chasm leans heavily on Castlevania. Combat is not fast-paced or nimble compared to others in the genre, but is very sensitive to where you are and when you decide to backstep or jump. Enemies deal small hits that add up quickly enough to threaten death while travelling, and for much of the game I had only a few healing items. The enemies' patterns are easily learnable, though, and after a few exposures to a new enemy I was rarely taking damage any more. The spells in the game are straight from Castlevania. There was something a little strange with the spells - I felt like unless I optimized my build for them they were almost not worth using, but once I did optimize my build for them they were overpowering. I would have liked to see a little more middle ground there.

The plot of Chasm is nothing to phone home about. It's a pretty simple story of people stumbling into an ancient evil and our stalwart (and silent) protagonist having to deal with it. There's some things in the lore text about the hero possibly being a person of pure good or the villain being from another dimension, but I didn't really feel like these details influenced the scenario much at all. The protagonist is just a cipher doing his job and the villain is just a monster attacking because it's what it does. Which is fine, I didn't come into this expecting Shakespeare.

In summary Chasm is a solid game which was entertaining and kept me playing, but it wasn't groundbreaking. I'll be interested to see what the developers plan to do next.",1535356287,1535356287,True,0,0,0.484042584896087646,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 - 操作
手感相当一般, 攻击硬直啥的可以接受(毕竟恶魔城也是有这类武器的), 但是出现硬直后不能接蹲/后跳等操作(这也间接导致后跳变成鸡肋), 恶魔城式的[落地取消硬直]在这里也不是那么好用, 因为不少武器挥舞速度很慢, 挥舞结束前落地还是会进入硬直, 而且即使相同类型的武器挥舞速度也会略有不同, 使得用起来更难受. 我已经尽力去适应这个硬直但是还是会经常卡点;
另外攀爬和抓悬崖两个技能结合非常容易导致操作失误.

 - 平衡性
游戏的平衡性设计得并不好.
1.首当其冲的就是副武器系统. 游戏前期副武器相当鸡肋(前期普通平砍>>副武器, 副武器不受STR加成, 但角色普通攻击是依赖STR的, 而且前期角色MP低也无法大量使用); 然而到了中后期, 副武器却强得让平砍变得毫无意义, 足够MP让副武器的使用频率大大提高, 高等级副武器强大的杀伤力和范围, 再加上商店出售的强化饰品更让副武器强到IMBA;
2.滑铲杀伤力不和武器伤害挂钩, 这里可以理解作者是想追求真实性, 但是作为攻击方式的一种, 伤害不同处理就显得很奇怪;

[i]For TL;DR you can read only bold sections[/i]

I have been looking forward to Chasm for a long time. I didn't back it on Kickstarter, and didn't know anything about it other than it was a Metroidvania type of game, with pixel art, and a look to it highly reminiscent of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. [b]I began playing with no expectations, only a hope that it would recapture the classic feel of SOTN.[/b]

Here's the thing about Chasm: it's a bit [i]too[/i] inspired by SOTN for its own good. Now, it's not a bad thing to want to emulate one of the greats in a particular genre. Chasm has plenty of weapons, armor, and accessories to find, secrets to discover, and enemies to fight. [b]Slain enemies erupt into flames and splatter pixelised gore across the ground in perfect immitation of SOTN, which is just as satisfying now as it was in 1997[/b]. You gain access to spells early on which match the traditional special attacks of our favorite vampire hunter family: daggers you toss in a line, axes that arc up, and flasks to fling against the floor which spout flames, among others. There are also all the basic RPG stats you would expect.

These things all come together and scratch the itch you might be feeling if you've been wanting to go back and replay one of the old Castlevania games. Except...the itch doesn't go away. It gets worse, and it's because [b]while Chasm does its best to bring the feel of those games that inspired it, it brings along more baggage than it can comfortably carry.[/b]

Small things first. Combat, while enjoyable enough at the outset, can become tedious and feels somewhat clunky overall. A delay exists after player attack animations where you are unable to take further actions. It doesn't take long to adjust your playstyle to account for this, and can be avoided entirely by attacking while jumping, but [b]combat never feels quite as tight as it should[/b]. Sometimes this sort of delay with attacks is an intentional design choice, and is actually an important part of the original Castlevania's game design. In Chasm though it feels out of place, like combat just didn't get that last bit of fine tuning.

Secrets are a mainstay of the Metroidvania genre and Chasm certainly has them, but unfortunately they are by and large poorly implemented. Most are painfully obvious (e.g. a hidden section of wall you can walk through positioned in a place you are naturally jumping to anyway), and aren't fun or satisfying to discover. Some rooms are ""optional,"" containing a handful of hazards to navigate through in order to reach a treasure chest. Unfortunately, these [b]bonus room chests are often anti-climactic side-grades not worth your while.[/b] Depending on when you reach them, they may end up being downgrades. While this should be expected to some extent in a game like this, it happens far more frequently than it should, as most of your equipment upgrades come about naturally as you progress through ""main"" rooms you are required to go through.

One of Chasm's selling points is in its procedural generation. This sounds exciting, but on a scale to 10 the actual varience between maps is maybe a 2 or 3 tops. On subsequent playthroughs you may find a few small rooms and hallways in different locations, but these differences are inconsequential unless perhaps you are doing several playthroughs back to back. The thing is [b]by the time you finish one play through, you will have wandered through the same rooms dozens of times, trudging your way back and forth from one location to another in the biggest downfall of this game: backtracking.[/b]

Of course, a defining feature of the genre is going back to previously explored locations after unlocking some new ability; using a new slide to get through a low passage or double jumping up to a formerly too-high ledge. Chasm takes this to extremes, [b]and if I didn't spend more time backtracking than making actual progress in new areas then it certainly felt like it.[/b] The longer I played, the worse this issue became. Earning a new environment-traversing ability, making your way back through countless rooms to reach a chest which before was just out of reach and finding it contains only a bit of armor weaker than what you already have, or a single piece of health-recovering food is always a let-down. A lack of detail in the map and inability to mark rooms in any way other than adding a dot exacerbate the problem. Luckily if you get too lost or frustrated trying to remember which dead-end you'll now be able to overcome after gaining a skill, you can find a guide thanks to how little the map changes between playthroughs.

It's not all bad. The game is decent if you can get past the backtracking and archaic design choices (teleporter rooms you must  activate, watch the animation, and then repeat until you cycle through to the correct room was annoying in SOTN and it's just as annoying now). The music and atmosphere is fine, but not stand-out. A passable story which does little for keeping you interested and characters you won't end up emotionally attached to, while not deal-breakers on their own, certainly don't help elevate Chasm.

[b]Despite all this, I recommend playing Chasm and here's why: I feel it's important to play through games that are just OK in order to more completely appreciate other games in the same genre which excel.[/b] Chasm is an OK game, but more than that it is an important reminder of how far the Metroidvania genre has come over the last 20 or so years. The developer clearly loves this type of game, and [b]while Chasm may not sit on the same level as similar games I want to see more of what Bit Kid has to offer.[/b]",1535191512,1535191652,True,2,0,0.505468130111694336,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The big issue for me are the very annoying plateform phases which are not what I expect from a metroidvania game. It doesn't make sense to me to have added this gameplay.

This game is an absolute love letter to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Maybe not specifically in tone, but I have yet to play a game that has nailed what made its mechanics so great. I've seen a lot of Metroidvania style games that emulate an open world, striving for deep exploration.. but one thing they all did was spin their own formula that was really just an analog to something similar to Super Metroid.

None of them have taken cues from what made Castlevania so great. Chasm nails it.

You'll note in the opening screen a ""seed"" number. When you play each playthrough, the game randomly generates a pattern for each specific area and the enemy layout. But this isn't a roguelike. Instead, it simply switches up the formula each time, so room patterns won't feel stale. Is there a draw back to this? Yes. For one, there isn't too much uniqueness to ""most"" given room layouts. The game still benefits in that each area isn't so large, that you cannot remember the seeded layout you generated, however. I found myself remembering enough of each seeded layout to be able to backtrack to closed off areas enough. The size of each section is perfect.

The music is okay. The mines can be a little repetitive, sometimes.. but it didn't really bother me. The keep music really rocked.

The battle system is really where this game shines the best. Its fast, fluid, and full of playstyle customization, just like SoTN was. The feel is almost 1 to 1 to it. You can get cool benefits from the gear you get. There are even rare drops off monsters,  for the ultimate load out and playstyle chaser. It feels well balanced, the whip weapon feels exactly like how a Castlevania would feel and I can tell the developer put a TON of heart to get that perfect. The boss fights feel exciting, the game is pretty challenging, and I feel this is a labor of love.

Definitely pick this up, I love the feel that harkens back to a style long forgotten.",1535080918,1535080918,True,5,0,0.514679670333862305,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Então esse jogo não é para você![/h1]

Chasm é um jogo que conheci enquanto procurava por metrovanias a uns anos atrás, na época ainda em desenvolvimento me fez querer muito joga-lo, tanto pelo pixel art, quanto pela semelhanças a Castlevania. Fiz questão de o comprar no dia que lançou. Para a minha surpresa (negativa), o jogo não era 1/3 do que esperava. 

Na parte visual o jogo tem (fora a parte inicial) uma que outra área bem trabalhada... Sem o mapa séria fácil se peder pela falta de individualidade dos locais, sendo a musica completamente esquecivel (durante meu gameplay só lembrava que ela existia nos saves e na cidade de TÃO parecida que ela nos outros lugares).

Na parte de gameplay, o jogo segue a formula de Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, mas de um jeito ruim, os NPCs que você resgata são na maioria interessantes, entretanto a falta de história para a maioria deles te dá a sensação que foram esquecidos durante o desenvolvimento do jogo... Quanto a exploração da dungeon, é aquela coisa, vai e volta 1 milhão de vezes na medida que você pega os artefatos que te permitem chegar a lugares antes impossivel, porem durante a exploração/combate é normal ficar frustado com o quão travado o protagonista é, flexibilidade e fluideza não existem aqui! Exemplos: 
[list]
[*] Sem ter como cancelar ataques é normal você ficar olhando enquanto o protagonista apanha de graça, porque não pode fazer nada em 2 ~ 3 segundos se animação. Isso é contornavel pulando e atacando (porque você pode se mexer pelo menos) mas ainda assim não é anormal você acabar atacando na direção errada...
[*] O dash é somente para trás (backdash), se você está acostumado as mecanicas de esquiva da maioria dos jogos, esqueça, mesmo o backdash não té da invencibilidade nenhuma, além de não ser muito instantaneo (é impossivel combar bem um ataque com o backdash, melhor decorar o padrão de ataque do inimigo e recuar quando ele for atacar). Mesmo a 'rasteira' não te deixa invencivel, então nada de deslizar pelos inimigos, se te botarem contra uma parede pode ser fim de jogo facilmente.
[/list]
Mas o que pode te deixar mais indignado [i]700% putaço[/i] é a mecanica de pulo e de escalar paredes. Não queira ser rápido quando for fazer um desses dois, você vai errar (ou o jogo vai te fazer errar) e você não vai gostar de voltar pro inicio de uma sala, ou de morrer para o dano de ambiente (a lá 'lava' ou seja o que for aquilo no jogo, gas venenoso? Ironicamente, sendo a unica coisa de dano fixo, que ainda vai doer no end game).

Na parte de dificuldade, o jogo é artificialmente dificil, os inimigos tem 1, raramente 2 padrões de ataque (a maioria tem um ataque para cima, a fim de evitar você pular por eles, então não faça isso). Que não se misturam, a maioria tem uma fase de preparo (animção que mostra que vai fazer algo) e uma fase de ataque (aonde ele realmente tenta te acertar), uma ou duas vezes vendo um inimigo e você não vai mais morrer para ele, salvo se fizer algo idiota (por isso da dificuldade artiificial). Fora a área inicial do jogo, dificilmente você vai ter que lutar contra dois inimigos ao mesmo tempo, o que é estranho pois ah uma árena no jogo, que mistura duplas de inimigo tornando o jogo REALMENTE difiicil sem ser artificial (por mais que o combo seja um inimigo melee e um inimigo ranged que batem muuuuuuito forte). 
Uma das poucas coisas que me deixava apreensivo no jogo (e que a certo modo eram a minha parte divertidade dele) é a distancia entre saves e escasses de itens de cura, é normal se você não for cuidadoso acabar com pouca vida atravessamdo a dungeon sem saber quando vai vir o proximo save.

I really hope it has some consistency in patch output but I understand the development has been a long road. A female Sprite and possibly a playable Monster sprite would enhance the experience. I truly think that the input delay should really be changed and a lot tighter. It's a very common complaint that Super Mario 2, 3, World, etc etc etc. Maybe even 1 have better response. I can see some of these were fixed recently.
Weapons dont need an overhaul but their differences should be more relevant. I LOVE THAT YOU PUT IN ATTACK ANIMATION RESETS. It is VERY satisfying to be rewarded with practice and skill at doing so. It's also a large issue for me that its viewed as a bad thing in other similar games & to my (limited) knowledge non-existent.

I think if there was also a survival mode outside of mortal, where you started with all the upgrades and made health & mana more scarce with simple checkpoints & higher weapon drop rates it should not only be attainable with the current assets of the game. I dont think it's worth 20 bucks to everyone but I know i got this game on subjective taste rather than any slightly more objective elements such as others have stated themselves. Nor did i have wide expectations for it. I found out about it randomly a few weeks back when it came out.

I dont really care for Procedurally Genned however A LOT of people expected that. Maybe this gametype i suggested could really simplify the use of the assets. However I'm not a dev so I dont know the complexity of it.

Overall really great game & product. I deeply respect labors of Love and Ill support them more readily than i will big name ""blockbuster"" games.

I suggest this game for those who like something of moderate difficulty, where enemies are obstacles rather than AI (which i dont mind my enemies being like puzzles) & who wants a fairly relaxing experience. The game is a sensation. I do however think it's needs to be no more than 15 dollars and no less than 10.

Après avoir suivi sa campagne Kickstarter et joué à la démo, je n'étais pas particulièrement chaud, le prenant pour un rogue-like à la mode comme le tiers des jeux qui sortent actuellement.

Contre toute attente, ce n'était pas du tout le cas. En l'occurrence, il s'agit réellement d'un Metroidvania piquant dans les meilleures références du passé telles que Metroid, Castlevania à partir de SOTN, Ys III, Wonder Boy, etc. Croyez-moi, l'ambiance, le gameplay, l'esprit est là !

On peut lire de (très) nombreuses critiques négatives décrivant finalement un genre de jeu dans son ensemble par des joueurs qui n'ont vraisemblablement jamais eu connaissance des références indiquées. Je vous le dis : Si vous avez réellement connu et apprécié l'époque des jeux évoqués ci-dessus, Chasm est fait pour vous !

POSITIF :
- Tout l'esprit d'un Metroidvania est là. Tel un Metroid, Castlevania SOTN+, mais aussi Wonder Boy et Ys III
- Un design 2d impeccable.
- Une maniabilité à l'image de ses références, et plus précise encore !
- Des combats basés sur l'apprentissage de l'ennemi, et non l'aléatoire.
- Aucun mécanisme de temps limite, si ce n'est une médaille de félicitations après la fin du jeu. Vous jouez à votre rythme !
- Une vraie map utile intégrale, et des marqueurs personnalisés.
- Un univers riche ainsi qu'un scénario intéressant et bienvenu.
- Des musiques qui collent au rythme du jeu.
- Vous êtes récompensés parce que vous êtes bons, grâce aux récompenses. Mais vous pouvez gérer quand même si vous êtes mauvais, grâce au loot.

NEGATIF :
- Impossibilité de se retourner après une attaque sautée.
- La génération procédurale a été un effort de développement conséquent inutile.

I'd definitely recommend at least trying it if you're a fan of games like Castlevania SotN, PoR, OoE, etc. 

I don't ordinarily do reviews so apologies if I ramble on overmuch.

At first I felt the combat was a little stiff with the sword and hid behind the range of the whip a lot, but then as I got further along I learned how to make better use of the sword. It seems to be the most common weapon type and because of that, it'll often be the best one you've got. But what turned me off to the sword at first was my inability to backdash quickly after attacking. I don't remember how it was in some older Metroidvanias with backdash, but in many of the newer ones you can cancel an attack into a backdash for more nimble offense/defense. With the sword in this one you're fixed in place until the attack animation finishes. I learned to get around this by tapping backdash a split second BEFORE attacking, and that helped a lot. I also learned to do the midair-attack-land-attack combination pretty well and that quick double slash saved me a lot of grief. These were the ways I got around that stiff feeling after I couldn't hide behind the range of whips anymore. This would have certainly been my biggest complaint had I not found ways around it.

I've seen people complain about backtracking a lot as you get more maneuverability options and keys but eh, that's part of the charm of these types of games to me and I've played a whole bunch of them, so it's par for the course. There was only one time near the end that I felt really lost, before finally remembering this one door near the beginning of the garden. But I never resented wandering around (and powering up the assassin sword in the meantime) 

My final comment on this will be about the music. On the one hand, it's not bad, and I even understand the sort of earthy, sort of tribal vibe it evokes. Goes along with the story. That said, I think the BGM was just too chill at times. I feel a game like this is better served by a more upbeat soundtrack.

I finished the main quest and did every bit of side content I could find! I searched every nook and cranny, in hopes of prolonging my enjoyment as I explored the depths of Chasm's world. I thoroughly enjoyed the journey, from start to finish, and I had fun, all the way through. 

SO yeah. Ultimately, I had fun. And that's the point of a game, right? To have fun while completing challenges? I had a lot of that, while I traversed the beautifully crafted game. 

For many of the reviewers here, fun doesn't seem to be enough, unfortunately... It's baffling to me how many people straight up said they HAD FUN, but wouldn't recommend the game... wait, what? You don't recommend a fun game? Seems to me people are more in touch with their personal [i]armchair game developement theories[/i] than they are with the reality that they HAD FUN. It breaks my heart that such a lovely game, one made by only 5 people, would receive such harsh critiques. 

But enough of that! Here's some more important info on my experience. 

[b]What I found to be fun: [/b]
[list]
[*] [b]The art:[/b] It's so amazing to look at all the detail put into the game, from the animated characters, to the paralax backgrounds. Very inspiring, especially as an artist myself. 
[*] [b]Combat:[/b] I felt the combat challenges scaled very well! I am not a master gamer by any means, but having played on normal difficulty, I found that the balance of easy and challenging monsters was well balanced. Some of the more challenging monsters were at first quite frustrating... until I realized that I just needed to be smart about how I fight them. After a bit of experimentation, I discovered that each monster has some sort of timing or weakness that can be exploited by just paying attention to their pattern of attack, and counting how many hits I could land before they restart thier attack. There's enough variation with the sorts of monsters you run into, that once you start getting used to one, a new monster type comes along. And amidst the various challenging creatures, you get a break between them often enough with little ""cut-through-as-you-run-by"" type monsters. A good overall balance that makes combat part of the progression, as you explore the map and find treasure. 
[*] [b]Exploration:[/b] One of my favorite things in games like these is when you are going through an earlier level, and you see a ledge or narrow gap you can't get through, with treasure on the other side. Later on, you find a power up that gives you access to areas you previously couldn't reach, and you end up going ""hey, wasn't there a long pit I couldn't reach in the earlier caves? Ooh, maybe I can get there now!"" And I'll run all the way back to check for secrets along the way, excited for what I will discover. Sure, I could just use the conveniently placed shortcuts to get there, but I actually do enjoy running around and looking for secrets. It's also a little bit of side fun to insta-kill monsters in earlier levels that I used to have trouble with. 
[*] [b]Finding secret monster drops:[/b] Once I discovered the bestiary, and that each monster had two ??? entries for item drops, I was hooked to farming monsters to try and see what they dropped. I avoided forums that would spoil what monsters gave the best drops, because I wanted to be surprised, and I was going to kill them all, anyways. The neat thing about features like this is that you don't have to get these drops, if you don't want to. It won't hurt your progress if you decide to just move on to the next room. It's just a neat little side thing for people who are patient and willing to put in the time and effort to ""see what you get"". Not every item is going to be better than your current gear, but some are, which makes it a bit of a fun gamble, and you learn how to kill the monsters pretty efficiently, when you kill them over and over. XD
[*] [b]Secret item abilities:[/b] I loved it in Symphony of the Night, and I love it here. For example, I found a spear type weapon and started messing around with it, only to discover that if you press a certain button combo, it has a special attack animation that does considerably more damage! Once I found that, I started fiddling around with other items, and found a few others that had screts, too. It's not necessary to discover these, but they are there, just waiting to be discovered. I love it!
[*] [b]Story:[/b] Some have said that the story isn't original. No, it's not. But is that a requirement for it to be enjoyable? Is a cookie only good if you've never had it before? I enjoyed this story. It was familiar, yet unique enough to have it's own ""home made"" taste. No, I wasn't once surprised by how it went down. But I wasn't looking to be surprised. I didn't really expect much story in a game like this, so the one I did get was enjoyable, and wraps up nicely, I think. 
[/list]

[b]What I found NOT to be fun: [/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Monster drops a bit TOO rare, for most items:[/b] While I did enjoy farming the monster drops, I feel that lesser items should be easier to get. On the other hand, I respect and appreciate that some amazing items are very rare. There was one item dropped by a particular geletenous cube that took me about 350 kills to get, which seemed like a lot... but also... hey! That item was VERY useful! But it wasn't terribly fun having to kill 100 or so trolls to get a knife or club that isn't really better than my current weapon... It felt a bit tedious after a while, since I had commited to getting all the items, I needed to farm every new creature, which caused progression to slow from room to room, until I had killed enough of the new critter to get both the item drops from it. If some of the lesser drops were more frequent, then it wouldn't slow things down so much, I think. 
[*] [b]Locked weapon attack direction:[/b] This is minor, but what I am talking about is that if you swing your sword, your character is locked in the same direction, even while jumping, so you can't quickly turn and allow the attack animation to follow your movements. Being able to change direction mid-attack was a thing I really liked about Symphony of the Night, and it felt a bit confining not to be able to do that in this game. Still, I got used to it pretty quick (it is a different game, after all), and actually, I felt that it made it more important to be deliberate with your attacks, and required more intentional skill to play, rather than button mashing. The only other control feature that annoyed me was that the back-dash seemed useless when I started playing, but the devs released a patch that fixed it, and so now I use it all the time. :)
[/list]

[b]Closing thoughts: [/b]
Chasm was fun. Absolutely fresh, yet nostalgic, lovingly crafted, fun. It breaks my heart that it has ""mixed reviews"" at this time. Even if you read through the negative reviews, most of them actually had fun, and still won't recommend the game. Frankly, that's appaling to me. It only hurts the devs, who worked hard for years so you could have fun and then turn your nose up at it. 

Did Chasm change my life? No. Not sure many have. Was it the next Symphony of the Night? No. Even better, it was it's own thing. I loved Symphony of the Night, but I never finished it, even though I keep saying I will. I definitely finished Chasm, and I will again, and again. Like many gamers, I've had dreams of making a game. I am a professional artist, and so who knows, maybe I'll have a shot, someday. If I ever do, Chasm will be my inspiration. Thanks BitKids, for such a lovely and inspiring experience!",1534457915,1534459005,True,5,0,0.507372021675109863,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Juli des Jahres 2018 erschienen ist. Nach jahrelanger Entwicklungszeit unter dem Kickstarter-Banner hat Bit Kid, Inc. Es geschafft das Spiel auf Steam und anderen Plattformen zu veröffentlichen.

In Chasm schlüpft man in die Rolle eines jungen Rekruten eines Ritterordens, der nach Langem endlich seine erste Mission erhält, bei der er sich beweisen und eventuell seinen Ritterschlag erhalten kann. Er erhält den Auftrag sich die Situation eines Mienendorfes anzusehen, das vor einiger Zeit Hilfe anforderte, da seltsame Kreaturen in der Mine aufgetaucht und einige Bewohner verschwunden sind. So macht sich also der junge Recke auf in sein erstes großes Abenteuer.

Spiel spielt sich wie typischer explorativer 2D-Plattformer – auch Metroidvania genannt –, besitzt jedoch ein paar kleine zusätzliche Kniffe. Wie gewohnt rennt, springt, klettert und kämpft man sich durch die 2D-Umgebung von einem Endboss einer Gegend zur Nächsten. Man findet dabei auf dem Weg Relikte, die einem neue Wege zugänglich machen. Der einzige große Unterschied dabei: Die Gegenden sind zufallsgeneriert. Dabei verwendet Chasm ein Seed system, mit dem man seine Lieblingsgegend in Form eines Seeds speichern kann um sie später auf höheren Schwierigkeitsstufen zu spielen. Durch besiegte Gegner sammelt man, wie in jedem Metroidvania, Erfahrungspunkte, die sich bis zu einem vordefinierten Stufenaufstieg aufsummieren. So wird man über Zeit immer stärker und hat leichteres Spiel mit allen Gegnern. Ein klein wenig notwendig ist dies ebenfalls, da sowohl die extra Finanzspritze von eventuell fallengelassenen Gegenständen, als auch der Stufenaufstieg vieles ein wenig erleichtern, da die Kämpfe nicht gerade ein Kinderspiel sind. Die Schwierigkeit bleibt dabei jedoch immer im Bereich „Hart aber fair“. Die unterschiedlichen Schwierigkeitsstufen, die zu Beginn des Spiels frei wählbar sind, tragen dabei zur passenden Herausforderung für jeden bei. Wer es ganz brachial mag, kann sogar einen optionalen Modus hinzuschalten, indem der Tod endgültig ist und nicht nur damit bestraft wird, das Spiel vom letzten Speicherpunkt neu starten zu müssen.

Die Steuerung ist dabei sehr intuitiv und eingängig. Sowohl Gamepad, als auch Tastatur lassen sich einfach nutzen um den Helden durch die Umgebung zu manövrieren und sich durch die Feindesmengen zu kämpfen. Außerdem lassen sich alle Tastenbelegungen jederzeit nach Belieben anpassen. Da das Spiel den Controller vollständig unterstützt, ist sogar hotplugging eines Controllers im laufenden Spiel möglich.

Optisch macht Chasm dabei einiges her. Die Grafik ist zwar nicht fotorealistisch, jedoch sind die Gegenden, die Monster, Gegenstände und Charaktere liebevoll gestaltet und detailreich animiert. Der Stil ist konsistent und macht einiges her, auch wenn sich auf Grund des zufallsgenerierten Lebeldesigns manche Gegenden als etwas eintönig gestalten, da gewisse Designelemente, wie zum Beispiel Mobiliar und ähnliches, seltener vorkommen, als sie könnten. Außerdem lässt dadurch auch die logische Gestaltung der Räumlichkeiten oft zu wünschen übrig.

Im Audiobereich lässt sich Chasm auch nicht lumpen. Die Effekte sind passend gestaltet und hervorragend abgemischt. Kein Ton wirkt deplatziert oder aus dem Stil gerissen.
Ähnliches kann man auch vom Soundtrack behaupten. Die Lieder sind an Sich stimmig, dem Stil angepasst und liegen gut im Hintergrund. Leider hat der Soundtrack eine kleine Schwäche. Viele Stücke wirken vom Stil her gleich, wodurch sich sowohl im Tempo, als auch in der Atmosphäre nie wirklich viel ändert. Dies kann den Soundtrack eintönig wirken lassen. Ein paar Eingriffe in andere Stilrichtungen oder zumindest Wahl der Instrumente und Rhythmen hätten zur Abwechslung gutgetan.

Alles in allem ist Chasm ein sehr interessanter und gut gelungener Metroidvania-Titel im Retrostil, der von Fans des Genres definitiv angesehen werden sollte. Die Story ist zwar kurz und nicht allzu kompliziert, aber dennoch fein. Außerdem besitzt Chasm durch die zufallsgenerierte Welt und den unterschiedlichen Schwierigkeitsstufen eine gewisse Menge Wiederspielwert.
Wer also das Genre mag und generell auf fordernde Plattformer steht, sollte Chasm definitiv eine Chance geben.",1534444229,1534444229,True,1,0,0.511988699436187744,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Since I was a part of the Kickstarter for this game, I was aware of what I was getting into. A semi-roguelike RPG that will force you to do some minor resource management in between save points. You need to learn how to handle different enemies in different scenarios and put in some work to not die. That being said, it's well balanced for what it is. The game is simple and harkens back to times before $60 ultra4kHD video games. 

If you like the way games play these days and couldn't play something from before 2010, this might not be for you. If you want something simple with beautiful art, varying rogue-like platforming and puzzling, then this game is worth a shot. 

I will say there are some things that I think would improve the game such as a minor tutorial, even just a brief screen showing the control layout - I thought my game froze on start up because I wasn't sure which key would move through dialogue. I understand the feeling that the developers were going for, and I enjoy it. These days tutorials and explanations can ruin an immersion and feel of a game, even driving people away from playing. However I played nearly 4 hours of the game before realizing that the V key has a purpose. 

Otherwise, I think the game is absolutely lovely and I'm glad the team pulled through and commited. I'm not sure if it's worth the $20 yet, but supporting indie developers is like supporting your local small businesses - without them we'd live in a boring corporate world with nothing unique. Chasm stands out as a unique title that combines elements of older roguelikes and modern gaming. If you've got the $20 to spend exploring a mine (and further, deeper delves) whilst fighting monsters and hoping for a save point (and then enjoying wonderful euphoria when you find one) then Chasm is for you,.",1534311160,1534311160,True,0,0,0.465838491916656494,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- Gorgeous pixel art. The environment work is especially beautiful, with painterly-like backgrounds and tiles that do well in conveying the atmosphere of each environment. Lots  of fun, interesting, and well-animated creatures and characters, too!
- Fun Castlevania-like combat. Taking out enemies never stopped feeling good, and getting into a rhythm with the jump cancelling as you run through a hallway, taking out monster after monsters never got old to me.
- Good sound design. I do think a few of the tracks become a bit grating after some time, but overall, I think the music does a great job at establishing the mood in each environment - and the SFX were spot on!

The Not-So-Good:

- I applaud the Bit Kid team for taking a risk of fusing the rogue-lite elements of a randomly generated dungeon with those of a metroidvania. But I think it still needs a few tweaks for it to be as fun as it was intended to be. The idea of experiencing a new map layout each playthrough is great - I just think it's extremely difficult to do so in a way where every layout is memborable and filled with that sense of exploration. The map layouts force you to spend a lot of time backtracking to find new items or areas you couldn't previously reach. Maybe some faster movement options or more shortcuts that connected various sections of each biome would have helped in this regard.
- Weapon variety. I would've loved for the later weapons to have more interesting properties. I basically stopped using anything else other than the Assassin's sword once I found that. It discouraged the use of any of the other weapons I found afterward, which is a bit of a bummer.

I had a great time with Chasm, and if you're someone who enjoys the SotN styled Castlevania games for their combat and lite RPG mechanics, I'd suggest giving this game a shot!",1534295619,1534295674,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I'm definitely enjoying the game, and probably moreso than other metroidvania games I've played (like Dust Elysian Tail, Cave Story, Hollow Knight, etc).  It does a lot of things right, feeling very NES/SNES Castlevania, and very Super Metroid.  A lot of metroidvanias fail in the nostalgia department, as they generally put more focus on modernization.  In my opinion, Chasm hit the perfect balance of nostalgia and modernization.

The graphics are absolutely beautiful!  The soundtrack is great, especially after the first mines area.  The combat, weapon system, and platforming mechanics are deeper than games like Hollow Knight, yet still very NES/SNES Castlevania, in a good way.  The exploration and map system feels very Super Metroid, again in a good way.  The fast travel system is very well done, with a hub in each area allowing you access to teleport to well different corners of each area.  The procedural generation uses mostly hand crafted rooms arranged on a procedural map, yet the item/ability locations required for progression still feels very hand-placed.  On your second playthrough, you will know the -order- of areas/items/abilities you'll need to progress, but you won't necessarily know the direction you need to go to find those things.  Even the puzzles in the game have a randomized element to them, so you won't be able to memorize a number puzzle for your second playthrough.  Honestly, it's a very polished experience!  If I have any complaint, it's that I'm finding a lot of weapons and armor that are underpowered compared to what I've currently equipped (though this may be because I'm grinding like a completionist, so I may be over-levelled for where I'm at in the game).  There's still difficulty in learning enemy and boss patterns though, and I'd expect a speedrun on a harder difficulty would be a great challenge!

TL;DR: Maybe I'll update my review after another 15 hours, but it's already a very polished game and definitely worth playing if you enjoy a good metroidvania!  I'm really not sure why there's so many negative reviews?  Maybe people developed unhealthy expectations over the past 6 years of waiting since it's kickstarter?  Really not sure.  It's sad that Chasm has a 'Mixed' review score when games like Hollow Knight have a 'Very Positive' score.  Don't get me wrong, Hollow Knight is an absolutely gorgeous game, but mechanically I find it less interesting/engaging than Chasm.

But the final game... Well.
Overall, it's a good game, yes. But while I was playing it, I kept asking myself: ""What were they doing for five years of development?""

First of all, let's state the obvious. The graphics in this game is really nice, with great attention to details.
Yet at the same time, all locations feel... generic?

Music is hit and miss. And also feels lacking originality. Up to the point where ""item pick up jingle"" feels... forced. If you put a gun to my head and ask me to remember that jingle or you'll shoot me, I'd be a dead man! Which is bizarre, considering that in most games like this, ""item pick up jingle"" is the easierst thing to remember, since you hear it a lot.

Chasm boasts to have randomly generated levels. And the thing is - it does not add anything to the game at all! If it was roguelike, or at least had some sort of endless mode, then sure. But for a singleplayer metroidvania? No.
More so, I begin to see exact same rooms over and over within the first two hours of the game!

But what really kills the deal for me is all the little things and game mechanics, that kept me asking ""why? why did you do it like that?"" There are lots of minor annoying things, but combined together they make it a constant struggle against the game.
Let me provide some examples.
Chasm has bestiary, with something like 200 entries, if I remember correctly. But instead of having a list, or a grid, where you select something and see all the information, it forces you to scroll every entry... ONE BY ONE! Why?
Main character can't attack on the move, and all animations lock him in place. Which makes combat very unpleasant, and movement feel sluggish.
Some skills interfere with each other. When I got wall jump, my life became much harder! Many-many times I jumped off the wall with wall jump, instead of grabbing a ledge and making bigger jump, because my character kept sticking to walls and I was pressing the jump button 0,01 seconds earlier than he grabs the ledge. Many times I tried to get out of ""lava"", only to jump back into ""lava"" again because I stuck to the wall, instead of grabbing the ledge.
Parachute works like in Aladding game on SNES... except unlike the SNES game, you can only glide either left, or right. You can't just glide straight down. WHY?! It makes parachute feel awful.

As I said, all those little things, and many more, make the gameplay experience unpleasant.
Chasm has vibes of a SNES game, back from the era when game developers did not have many examples of good game design, and they were experimenting. But it's 2018! You have all the tools, all the games that were made before you! If you're making a generic metroidvania, just look up how things were done before you! Take good ideas, and mechanics, and implement them in to your game!

So in conclusiuon... What were they doing for five years?",1534274771,1534946953,False,70,1,0.790408134460449219,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's rather difficult, even on Normal difficulty, which I like. My only major gripes with the game would be that the procedural generation gives the game a somewhat unstructured feeling, and frankly I'm not sure why they bothered with procedural generation. I doubt subsequent playthroughs of this game will feel radically different, just with a slight remix to the room layouts.

But beyond some repetition and other foibles, overall I really have been enjoying Chasm. The graphics are stunning, the sound is excellent, and the controls are pretty good. Overall I find it to be a worthy successor to the Castlevania spectrum of the Metroidvania genre that has gone so empty for many years.

Chasm is a solid start to what I hope is a series with further growth potential. I'd love to see Chasm 2 ditch the procedural generation and focus on better pacing and more expansive environments. Or if they keep the PG then at least they'll have more time to make more rooms and thus bring more diversity to the world? I dunno.

INITIAL REVIEW:

So far, this is a pretty good game. The art and music are great, setting an appropriate mood for this type of game. The presentation, overall, is pretty much perfect for the style they are going for. That's not to say that everything is perfect. The randomized maps are definitely not always the best, and you may end up wandering for many screens before anything truly interesting occurs. Regardless, it's worth picking up if you like the genre.",1534185898,1546968848,True,0,0,0.497509360313415527,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1][b]【良い点】[/b][/h1]

◆ ＢＧＭは全体的に良い曲が多く、背景等のドット絵は綺麗な出来になっている。キャラクターのドット絵はワザとなのか少し粗い出来になっているが各種モーションが良く、攻撃のモーション等は「月下の夜想曲」や「暁月の円舞曲」の主人公の攻撃モーションにインスパイアされている。[strike] というかまんま。[/strike]

◆ ダンジョンはゲーム開始時にある程度ランダムで自動生成される。これによりリプレイ性が上がっている。また、「SEED」というコードが各セーブデータに存在し、ゲーム開始時に入力する事で特定の（例えば友人と同じ）ダンジョン内容にすることもできる。タイムアタック等を競う時にも重宝しそうだ。

[h1][b]【悪い点】[/b][/h1]

◆ 無駄に長い通路が多い。特にアイテム等が隠されているわけでもなく、敵が配置されているだけの通路が多すぎて後半はダレてくる。ある程度マップは自動生成なので「自分が偶然こうなったのか？」とも思ったが他の方も似たようなレビューが多いようなので全体的にこの仕様なようだ。

◆ 「ムチ」系と「長剣」系の武器以外は各種通常攻撃が使いづらく、またサブウェポンが強すぎて攻撃のバランスが悪い。ある程度ＭＰの最大値が上昇してからはＭＰを温存する目的以外では通常攻撃をしなくなるほどだった。後半は「探索→ＭＰ切れ→町へ戻る→探索」という風に進めた方が楽になるほど。ボス戦はサブウェポンを連打していればいつの間にか倒せてしまうので目も当てられない。逆に通常攻撃のみでプレイしようものなら恐ろしく難易度が跳ね上がる。通常武器に関しては、例えば「大剣」系の武器は通常「フリが遅く、攻撃力が高い」のがゲームの常だが、今作ではそのフリの遅さに見合った攻撃力が無く、それであれば「長剣」で二度攻撃した方がお得だったりする。勿論、攻撃範囲が違うが、それであればやはりサブウェポンでカバーできてしまうので使う理由がない。

[h1][b]【総評】[/b][/h1]

個人的には面白かったが、他の方にもオススメかと聞かれれば別のメトロイドヴァニアをすすめてしまう。ボス戦はサブウェポンを過度に使用しなければバランスも良くて面白く、ドット絵やBGM等が良かっただけに上記した不満点が足を引っ張ている。各種バランスを整えれば良作になれた残念な作品。

Chasm is a great little game. Lovely crafted pixel art for both bg art and sprites. Top-notch animations for all enemies. Good, atmospheric music tracks. Tight controls and simple but useful menus. The main quest is not too long, 6 areas for you to explore in typical backtracking metroidvania fashion. Boss fights are neat. I only ran into one bug and it wasn't gamebreaking, just a sprite loading glitch, only one time.

I only have three gripes. Two of them very minor: No way to sort items in your inventory. This is a useful feature for item collectors such as yours truly. The other minor one is that you don't need to collide with the edge of a screen to traverse to the adjacent room. A few times I changed rooms unintentionally. It's a bit annoying but nothing serious. Hopefully the devs can improve these later via patch.

The other one is not so minor: The proc-gen elements seem quite limited. Originally I was very excited about the procedural generation in this game, but it turns out it's pretty minor. The map layout seems to stay roughly the same, it seems some item rooms are randomized. This still doesn't damage my enjoyment of the game but I had other expectations, however, the devs pulled out an amazing game, and they were clear in their Kickstarter campaign that the game would randomize some stuff, so this one is entirely on me. No biggie, since SotN doesn't have any proc-gen elements and I've played that game countless times. Also, the future might hold additional game modes and improvements to the game, so there's that too.

If you enjoy metroidvanias, especially SotN and the GBA/DS ones, chances are you'll [i]love[/i] Chasm. Castlevania SotN being my favorite game of all time, this game scratches a similar itch and it might grow on me over time as a regular game.

While more grounded than the wild fantasy that you might be accustomed to from Igavania-style titles, Chasm still provides an interesting challenge with decent options for replayability.

[b]TLDR:[/b] 
It’s a good game that could have been better. The pixel art is beautiful, the soundtrack is good, and the story is enjoyable. Sadly, it has a lot of frustrations that put it in the “Would Not Recommend category. There are a few things that could have been done to make Chasm REALLY good.

[b]Player tips and advice:[/b]
[olist]
[*] You only need two magic items to be effective. The rest are, in my opinion, a waste of gold: the magic dagger and the magic shield. Get the witch to level both to maximum. Ignore the rest. Daggers are by far the most utilitarian and easiest to use. You can use it to defeat everything from a distance with rare exception. The shield is Extremely valuable with certain bosses. 
[*] For an easier run through, watch the screen ahead of you as you run and lash in with the daggers before you get in range of the monsters.
[*] Explore everything, leave no stone unturned. Use the marker feature to mark rooms you think you should come back to later on when you have new items or artifacts. This will happen a LOT.
[*] You can buy a warp to town scroll from the witch. Don’t worry about it until you get to the temple. I won’t say why so I don’t spoil anything.

[b]Full Review:[/b] 
I love what a boss of mine used to say - ""Don’t let perfect get in the way of good"". If you put off producing something until it’s perfect, you’ll end up producing nothing. It would be better to do something and have it be good than get stuck trying to make it perfect and never see it come to life.

That’s where it feels like Bit Kid was with Chasm. I want to be very careful with how I write this review, because it’s very easy to sit in the crowd and “armchair develop”. The indie game industry has taken off and I think we all need to support indie game devs that are doing new, cool stuff. So if anyone from Bit Kid is reading this, please know that I am not intending to insult or tear apart your work.

Chasm took 6 years to make and what they delivered was good. And while it’s OK that it’s not perfect, I can’t help but feel like it falls short of what they could have accomplished in 6 years. In all fairness, I don’t know all the factors that led to the length of the development time. For example, if the “In Memory of” section of the credits would have an impact if those people passed away during the making of the game, for example. That would certainly cause an understandable delay.

Here’s the stuff I LOVE: this is a beautiful pixel art game. A lot of love was obviously put into the designs of each character, the environments, the backgrounds, and the music. Absolutely awesome. The controls are easy to understand, very straightforward, and work great with a gamepad. And because I’m over 40, the nostalgia factor is important to me and there are lots of neat little nods in Chasm.

I’m sad to say my list of frustrations is longer than what I love. But I wouldn’t be writing this if I didn’t enjoy the game! Improving these things would just help Chasm to be that much better. Most of these seem like they’d be relatively easy to implement AND be huge quality-of-life benefits for us players.

[b]Poor In-game Explanations:[/b] This is the biggest problem with the game and the longest section of my critique because there are so many things that can make our lives better in playing the game with just better explanations. Below are just a couple examples that punctuate this issue.

There is no explanation of what your stats are or do. If you’re an RPG player, you can make some educated guesses like CON (constitution) granting you more health. And LCK must surely stand for “Luck”, which one would assume increases your chances of getting better drops. But there is nothing to confirm these guesses.

Second example: the descriptive text for items leaves a lot to be desired. Don’t just give me flavor text. Give me flavor text along with whether it’s a two-handed item or a one-handed item, slow or fast attack, long or short range. One could assume that brass knuckles have next to zero range vs. a poniard, but how would I know for sure? Sword A has lower attack damage than Sword B, but I found Sword A later in the game so it must do something cool or special that B doesn’t, right? Maybe! Who knows?? 

[b]Getting Saved:[/b] No autosave or checkpoints? Really? Guys, we’ve come too far for you to require us to find save points. Don’t make me hunt and pray for a save point!

[b]Planting Seeds:[/b] The game uses a mechanic called “seeds”. The idea with a new seed is that the game becomes a whole new layout. Interesting idea which theoretically, lets you start a new game with a different seed and have a different experience each time. But does this game really need it? I’ll tell you one thing: it makes it awfully hard to find help/guides when no one’s maps are the same unless they played the exact same seed as you.

[b]Poor Diet:[/b] There’s too much reliance on potions, food, and save points. It’s distracting and detracts from the experience when I have to hunt down a save point so I can refresh my HP, find a way to get back to town so I can buy potions, or pray that the next enemy will drop some food. And I must to go into my inventory to consume anything, which interrupts my progress.

[b]On a Quest:[/b] there is no quest log so you know how many more of X you need to gather for Y person. Quests can take a long time to complete because the clues on how to obtain the items aren’t clear. So I’m told that kobolds drop venison. Awesome. But which kobolds count? And who needed it again?

[b]Oi! Drop It!:[/b] Oh my gosh drop quests are so annoying. Not only could I not always figure out what to kill in order to get the item, but when I DID, I had no idea how many times I’d have to go offscreen and come back just to kill the thing over and over and over until it hopefully drops something.

[b]Get a Clue:[/b] Sometimes you encounter rooms that the map says have treasure, but you’re given no clue whatsoever on how to obtain it. In one case, I had to get a potion in order to see the treasure…but I wasn’t told that in any way. So imagine me finding the recipe for the potion, buying the potion once it’s made and then wondering what the hell I’m supposed to do with it!

[b]Suggestions:[/b]
In addition to the changes needed to resolve the above issues, here are some other QOL suggestions:
[list]
[*] The game would dramatically improve if there were an on-screen map I could refer to and enlarge/overlay as you play so I don’t have to leave the game to check out the map. Interrupting gameplay continually to check the map is a detraction.
Change the player appearance with new gear! That’s one of the great parts of any RPG – looking the part.
[*] Make it so the parachute unfurls whenever you press the button while falling – not just once you’ve done a flip. Currently you get one use of the parachute per fall. 
[*] Make the Warp Scroll more expensive and make it a magic spells so you can warp to town when needed. At the very least, keep it as a scroll but PLEASE make it leave a portal open so you can go back to where you were when you used it! So much time is wasted trying to get back to the town to either save or refresh your health and mana pools.
[/list]

So as I stated above, I really do like the game. Unfortunately it feels a little too unpolished for me to be able to recommend it. Would you have a good time playing it? Probably. But I don’t feel like it has a lot of replayability given the frustrations. Even with the seed feature, you’d run into the same issues. 

That said, I do want to say “Thank you!” to Bit Kid for sticking with and finishing Chasm. There was obviously a lot of passion put into it. I hope you’ll consider making some updates to it in order to push it into the EXCELLENT and “Would recommend” categories.",1534018394,1534018467,False,53,0,0.73451542854309082,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So, going in I already had a positive bias.

This game has some of the most beautiful pixel art I've seen in a while, and although the different enviroments tend to be a bit stale towards the end, I enjoyed the art immensely.

The music on the other hand was mostly bland in my opinion, with the exception of maybe two tracks I already forgot them all.

The ""chasm"" is sectioned in six levels, and you will have to backtrack several times once you gain new abilities from items. So, whenever you see a spot where you can't progress, don't forget to set a marker on the map to find the way back later.
The gameplay is very much like Metroid, so except for some short dialogues do not expect to be told where to go.

The story is kinda meh. There are no big surprises or plot twists, but for what it is it is fine.

The fighting system und abilities are very familiar to anyone who has played either Metroid or Castlevania, and while I love it, I do have to admit there is no innovation here.

Still, I'm glad for the experience and will recommend this game any day. Just don't except to find something groundbreaking here, it's more of a refinement of most things one could love of Metroidvania games.",1534017003,1534017003,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Bosses seem too random, focus on the time the first boss needs to fade in and out, the time is random and not constant, which takes skill from the boss fight, and makes it a game of luck, especially when trying to not get hit at all.

In general you can make a game that feels retro without using clunky, bad retro style controlls, clunky random gameplay takes alll skil out of the game.

-The game looks gorgeous, the pixel art can be fantastic.
-Movement is fluid, and in most cases moving feels great
-The Equipment system is a very awesome addition, reminds me so much of SoTN. 

Cons
-Combat. There is a horribly awful lag time between basic attacks. This hurts the flow so much and the only way to safely attack is with an annoying backdash that I had to find a guide to even know about. Normally in a castlevania game enemies pause when hit, which doesn't happen here.
-Music. The music is alright, but there needs to be much more variation. Listening to the same basic song for that long is maddening.
-Randomization. Ok so this one would have been a possitive if it were more a roguelike game, where every time you die the dungeon changes. Instead it seems completely pointless. The most it seems to do is modify a few rooms in a dungeon at the beginning.


There are more cons here, and I went into a bit more detail about them, but I still think the game is worth getting and playing.

[h1]保守的だけどそれなりに楽しめるプラットフォーマー[/h1]

[u][b]はじめに[/b][/u]

　随分と以前からKickstarterやSteamGreenlightに永らく登録されており、ドットビジュアルが大好きな類だったので動向が気になっていたのですが、今年のBitSummit会場でPS4版の展示がされていたのでそろそろリリースかなという気配は感じていました。

　本作は2DアクションRPGであり探索型のプラットフォーマー、いわゆるメトロイドヴァニア系のゲームです。騎士見習いであるあなたは出払っている騎士団の代わりに任を受けて、失踪者が相次ぐ鉱山町のKarthasへ赴き、そこで消えた人々の消息やその原因を追い求めて閉鎖された鉱山に足を踏み入れることになります。

[u][b]ダンジョンの自動生成[/b][/u]

　ストアページには「ダンジョンの自動生成」が特徴であると記載されています。確かにゲーム開始時のシード値によって自動生成はされます。しかしダンジョンの基本形は決まっていて、各部屋の中身が少し変わるぐらいの変化しか感じられませんでした。移動アクションを追加する重要アイテムのアーティファクトがどこで取れるかなどは、シードに依らず決まっています。最近流行の自動生成というと何か聞こえはいいですが、本作においてこの点はさほど評価される点ではないように思います。Speedrunを公式にやるならシード値を固定して競い合うでしょうし、生成パターンを追加実装するぐらいならそれよりも前に後述する別の箇所を調整した方が良さそうです。

[u][b]ゲームバランス[/b][/u]

　戦闘ではレベル制とハック&スラッシュ系のLootドロップを採用していることにより、ユーザーのアクション操作ではなく、[u]レベルと装備品によるパラメータ向上によって打開できる局面が増えるRPGの趣きが強い[/u]です。これは本作をアクションとみなして購入したか、RPGとみなして購入したかによって印象が異なる点のひとつだと思われます。

　RPG的な趣きが強いと前置きした上で、戦闘のゲームバランスに言及します。新しいエリアに進入したときに雑魚敵からの被ダメージが大きく、そこそこ手強く感じるのでパラメータ調整としては理想的な右肩上がりのバランスにはなっていると思います。レベルアップに応じてパラメータが向上することにより被ダメージが軽減されていくので、経験値さえ稼げばアクション下手でも進行できるようになっているのは美点と呼べるかもしれません。

　本作には多様な武器が登場します。武器の攻撃範囲、硬直時間、攻撃発生速度に差異が設けられていますが、ほとんどの武器の攻撃力が横並びになってしまっているため、デメリットだけが目立つようになっています。最終的に水平方向しか攻撃できなかったり振りの遅い武器は敬遠され、連射できるナイフやジャンプ中の下段攻撃が可能な剣に落ち着いてしまいます。私は鈍器が好きなのに、細身の剣より攻撃力が乏しいなんて…。

　中盤まで進めると武器防具ともにクラフトできるようになりますが、クラフトは素材集めをしなければならず、その素材がなかなか手に入りづらかったりします。クラフト品を作ろうとウロウロしているうちに、ポンとLootドロップでクラフト品より強い装備品が手に入ったりします。それ自体は進行が楽になるから嬉しいのですけど、苦労に見合わないパラメータ設定になっている分、少し複雑な心境になります。

　極めつけとして魔法全般が強いです。中でも一番最初に購入することができるであろうMagicKnifeは安さとMPコストだけでなく、リーチの長さ、連射性能とアップグレードによる同時攻撃回数から単位時間あたりの攻撃性能は他の追随を許しません。町で購入するのはMagicKnifeとOnyxRingだけにして、それ以外は全て回復アイテムに注ぎ込んでよいレベルです。あとは何も要らず、道中のLoot品で全て賄えます。

[u][b]挙動と操作周り[/b][/u]

　バックステップや攻撃後などアクション後に硬直時間があり、やや癖があります。ゆえに間合いの取り方が重要で、槍などの長い得物だと有利に立ち回れることを想定していたのでは、と思います。でもバックステップ、攻撃、ジャンプの順にスライド入力すると攻撃後の硬直をキャンセルできてしまい、安全圏から攻撃できるリーチによる優位性はありません。

　攻撃しながらバックステップはできないですが、バックステップしながらの攻撃はできます。攻撃をジャンプでキャンセルはできないですけど、バックステップをジャンプではキャンセルできます。なのでバックステップしながら攻撃し、バックステップが終わるまでにジャンプすると、逃げながらの攻撃硬直をキャンセルできます。またジャンプ攻撃からの再ジャンプでも同様に攻撃後の硬直をキャンセルできます。仮にこの挙動をしっかり硬直するように調整したとしたら、今度は単純に遊びづらくなりそうな気がします。

[u][b]遊びやすさ/分かりやすさ[/b][/u]

　行動範囲が広がるアーティファクトを入手することで移動制限が緩和され、戦闘能力も向上するのはこのジャンルの常です。自動生成で述べた「アーティファクトを取れる場所が固定されている」とはいえ、初見だと分かりづらく、また直接示唆されることもないので、人によってはダラダラと散策している時間を長く感じるかもしれません。

　進入した鉱山からダンジョンの内部は大きく6つのエリアに分かれていますが、それぞれのエリアにワープポイントが設定されています。しかしワープポイントに辿りつくまでは町との行き来が発生しがちであるため、この辺も冗長に感じてしまうポイントかもしれません。町まで直通で戻るアイテムもあるにはありますが、序盤では高くてなかなか手が出せません。

　本作のアクション要素は緩めな方ですが、足場ギリギリからジャンプしないと進めない場所があって、他に進める場所があるのかと思ってウロウロしてしまい、時間を費やしたところがありました。具体的にはKeepのスケルトンアーチャーがいる大部屋です。初回プレイ時に詰まったので同じくウロウロしている人に参考になれば幸いです。

[u][b]難易度による差異とリプレイ性[/b][/u]

　ゲームモードとしての難易度はEasy、Normal、Hard、Nightmareの4段階が用意されており、初周でNightmareは選択できません。難易度の差異は被ダメージの差で、与ダメージに差異はありません。敵の攻撃方法が追加されるなどドラスティックなバランスの変化は感じられませんでした。難易度による実績はHardのみであり、周回するとしても初周と2周目の2回で事足りるかと思います。

　難易度ついでに苦言を呈するならば、敵のAI挙動がワンパターンであり、バリエーションに乏しく型にはめやすいです。画面内に敵が入った段階では索敵範囲内にプレイヤーが入っていないのか、棒立ちの敵をMagicKnifeで一方的に攻撃できたりします。攻撃したときやされたときのノックバック差などもあるのか検証しましたが、こちらも差異を確認できませんでした。

[u][b]セーブファイル周りの検証事項[/b][/u]

　ゲームクリア後からセーブファイル(プロファイル)の複製や削除が可能となるのですが、HPがなくなるとPermanent DeathのMortalモードではファイルをコピーしても、コピー元のファイルで死亡するとコピー先のファイルでも死んだ扱いとなり再開できないことは確認しました。大元のファイルを物理的に複製するならともかく、アプリ内では対策されている模様です。尚、死亡回数やゲームクリア回数はカウントされていますが、特に何かに影響ある訳ではありません。


[u][b]総評[/b][/u]

　減点方式のネガティブレビューみたいになってしまいましたが、ゆるゲーマーな私にとっては緩いバランスがありがたくて個人的にはそれなりに楽しめました。何回も死んで覚えるようなパターン構築は本作でした覚えがなく、RPG的な要素(レベルや装備品)によって増減するパラメータに依存する部分が大きいので、純粋なアクションを楽しみたい人には物足りなく感じるかもしれません。リリースまで長期間かかったので過度の期待を抱いたのと、2000円を超える定価設定が物足りない部分ばかりを指摘させる要因になっているのかもしれません。これで定価1280円ぐらいなら、だいぶん印象が変わっていた筈。

　ゲームとしては保守的ですが、ビジュアルとサウンドともに及第点で悪くないです。ラストダンジョンのBGMがちょっとメガテンぽいです。ゆるく楽しみたい人にオススメ。セールのときにどうぞ。",1534001923,1534044968,True,11,0,0.622374773025512695,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But Chasm did not deliver. It is *not* a bad game. You can tell that a serious amount of love and effort went into it. There's just very little that challenges you to keep on playing.

The best part about this game are the graphics and the map, although there are things to say about the map. It does feel like exploring and there's lots of variety, mostly thanks to the graphics. But I feel that the procedural generation offers absolutely nothing of value here, because there is little room to manouver between the fixed rules that the map design needs. This was a bad idea and the resources could've been better spent elsewhere. Like the enemies and combat, clearly the worst part of the game. The control is pretty stiff, much like Hollow Knight but a tad worse, which creates a serious handicap in combat. The creativity in the enemy design does not extend much further than their appearance. Their mechanics are somewhat dull and combined with the handicap of your own control, combat can be very annoying. 

In terms of gameplay, Chasm does the 'go figure it out for yourself'-approach without waypoints or clear instructions where to go, which I kinda like to be honest. The fast travel system also offers the right amount of benefit that you need - not too much and not too little. But it does remind me A LOT of Symphony of the Night in certain details, like enemies dropping weapons at random and weapon mechanics that are not revealed until you actually equip them. It seems awfully familiar when playing it and Chasm does not really bring in mechanics of its own. The writing and character design is somewhat cool but does not present itself very often. The only mechanic of its own that this game dóes give, the procedurally generated map, offers very little punch.

The game looks beautiful, exploration is somewhat fun, combat is rather annoying and frustrating sometimes, and I think it's the combination with the music that makes this game feel a little dull. It isn't very exciting.

[b]Chasm[/b][i] is a very nice 16bit pixelated Metroidvania style platformer, adventure game, I call it adventure because for me I was on an adventure and I very much enjoyed the adventure I was on [b]Sorry no Spoilers[/b]. The game has 6 huge areas all hand drawn and procedurally generated when I say  procedurally generated, I mean the rooms will be the same, just placed differantly if you start a brand new game with a new seed code, you can always use the same seed code if you wish with a new game.  I like to feel as though the game is new and fresh with the new room placement lay out when starting a new game.  I Played the game right to the very end on [b] Easy [/b] mode first and I had no issue's with the controls using Xbox 360 controller, I found the game very easy, which was just perfect for me, it had a very nice balance as I progressed, it did get more challenging as I progressed to newer areas but it was very enjoyable. I found all hidden secrets and explored entire map.[/i]

[i] I waited patiently for over 5 years for this game to get finished and released, I followed it all the way to release day and from my experiance of playing the game it never disappointed me. I loved how you had to back track to areas you could not get to before, once you found the slide ability, the climb, parachute, double jump, swimgear and a magic book, there are 6 abilitys to aquire to help you open new map areas and further your progress. I had so much fun and it was addictive to keep playing, I wanted to see and find more, even when I got stuck and felt I could not progress. I always looked to the forums for help and clues which I did that on a few occasions, as it did get tricky but not difficult, the answers where always under my nose, I just didnt always see and notice them straight away.[/i]

[i] I have only 3 final achievements to aquire, im not sure if I will ever get them, but I have started a brand new game on [b]Hard[/b] and let me tell you its is hard, I have died heaps, so my plan is to slowly edge my way into the game and level up, all while i just keep saving in the save rooms that also heal you.[/i]

[i] I do recomend using the map markers when you look at your map, always place in locations of interest, it will only mark the room your in, they easy indicators so you dont forget and go back later, I used these once I was familiar with them at about quarter way through the game, also the main rooms are coloured and you will also become familiar with those and remember them.[/i]

[b]All i will say is I greatly approve of this game, it was very nicely made by a dedicated team call ""Bit Kid Games"", and they did a fantasic job so well done ""Bit Kid Games"" NOW I WANT MORE, will there be a ""Chasm 2"" in the future? I guess only time will tell. I believe this team of developers can make another game similiar and perhaps even better, fingers crossed.[/b]

This was a game that I backed long ago. After playing early demos of this game and following development updates, it sounded like this game was really going far, and I was totally psyched, regardless of the timely development.
Unfortunately for me, I must have read too much into the hype, as I expected so much more from this game.

Story:
While I like the overall theme and plot, it just seems like the story was rushed along, feeling like a lot of great opportunity was missed. There were times when I expected the scholar to give me some hint on what needed to be done, but nothing like that was provided, so I would wander around until I found something new that only triggered NPC text that was of no use to me (other than trying to add little to the barely existant story).
Even saving the townsfolk seemed mostly like just accidentally stumbling across them.

NPCs:
Speaking of NPCs, once rescued, they mostly provided little to the game. Buying and upgrading magic as well as buying potions where the only really useful NPC functions. The blacksmith offered quite a bit for a beginning player, who will unlikely have the funds to buy anything useful. I found that by the time I had money for any gear, I already had comparable or better stuff, so I only actually used him for selling old junk. Even after completing his side-quest, the items he provided were weaker than things I found in the areas where you would collect ore, so by the time I could craft anything, I already had better.

Gear:
Much was said about gear in the previous section, but to further elaborate, most gear was quickly replaced by something better. There were only a few items ever worth holding on to

Mini-Games:
There ar a few tiny mini-games, one that is rarely seen that could give you a permanent boost or nerf. Due to the rarity, I simply avoid playing. I am sure most players would save before hand, and retry until they won.
The slot machine requires timing and only rewards money, which for me was not important enough to play.
Finally the matching game provided a free opportunity to get tokens to play the prior mini-game. As simple as it is, it seems like there should be some sort of penalty for losing, but no.

Replayability:
While the map is procedurally generated (sorted), I feel like this game does not offer much into replayability due to the linear progression.
The various attributes are psuedo-randomly incremented in a way that generally gives you a balanced character, so you can't easily play a magic build or a fighting build on different playthroughs, unless you simply restrict yourself from using certain equipment or you like to save and restart until you get the right attributes, which is too boring for me.
The only big choice for we was using the bird hat vs the sword hat. I may do a sword hat playthrough to see how it stacks up in comparison, but probably not.
The game offers quite a few levels of difficulty, but it just wasn't interesting enough for me to want to push myself through.


Overall:
The game was a major let down to me as a big fan of the genre, a software developer, and a backer. It did not grow much since early demos, many things in the game seem to be pointless novelty and halfway through, I began having to push myself to keep playing instead of being excited to progress.

Can't say if its got more or less replay value yet than a non proc.gen. game, but that aspect is one I'm less fond of. I do like the backgrounds, the Gardens and Catacombs really look good. The mines are a bit meh, but the Keep is fine.

My main gripes though are that the bestiary is done lackluster and the controls are not nearly as tight as they should be. Especially in a game with vertical/horizontal jump parcours and spikes of doom involved, your controls need to be tight. Here you sometimes really come up just too short simply because the controls are just a tiiiiinny bit off. The bestiary is barebones, a descriptor of the monsters is sorely missed and having to unlock the entries by killing random numbers of foes (and getting drops before they show up on it) feels like a chore without real reward.

That's my overall impression of this game after one playthrough (and a bit into the second): It's perfectly adequate with a few caveats.

I'm gonna tl;dr the basics first.

Graphics: Serviceable, somethimes downright pretty. Never ugly.

Sounds and music: Reasonably evocative. Not chartworthy but they do their job.

Controls: Precise and responsive, just as they should be.

Gameplay: It's okay. Combat is a bit SOTN-style (backdash doesn't cancel but you can attack and backdash simultaneously),  platforming is good.

Weapons: Bog-standard. You got a variety of swords, whips, big weapons etc. with slightly different behaviors. You also get spells, effectively Castlevania sub-weapons that you need to buy to unlock. Pretty expensive but useful throughout the game.

Areas and enemies: Reasonably diverse, both visually and gameplay-wise.

Now for the more uniwue bits:

One big theme of the game is scarcity. At the beginning you are chronically poor and even later on a health potion is a significant investment. While the game does not exhibit Dark Souls levels of ""git gud"" it does expect that you get better and rely more on skills and proper judgement to stay alive rather then constantly downing health potions. (This did not stop me from facing the last boss with far too many health potions after throwing all my money at the potion vendor.)

Also, health is a scarce resource. You can only regain health through healing items (expensively bought or found as semi-rare random drops), by resting at a save point or through one very risky late-game weapon. If you want to stay alive it's critical to keep an eye on your health and judge whether you can keep going or should return to the nearest save point. This massively affects gameplay.

While this scarcity mechanic can sometimes bog the game down I like it. It's definitely a matter of taste, though.

The other big theme is randomness: The game uses hand-crafted rooms in a randomized arrangement. This was a really cool idea a few years ago and has since been shown to have some serious caveats. On the upside this means that subsequent playthoughs of the game will feel reasonably fresh, on the other hand the world isn't terribly cohesive and a bad seed can make the game quite a bit more tedious. A completely hand-crafted world might have made the game a better metroidvania but I can live with the increased replay value as a consolation prize.

All in all I think it's a decently good game. Does it measure up to titles like Super Metroid or SOTN? Not really. But is it worth playing? The fact that I started a second playthrough right after completing the first one would suggest so.

I can't give an unconditional buy recommendation but if you can stomach the game's quirks I think you'll find it to be a solid entry into the genre.",1533927453,1533927453,True,1,0,0.532163739204406738,0,False,False,False,False,,,

On the one hand its a new metroidvania - platformer which I really enjoy. It has a decent story, multiple areas to go with a nice map system similar to Super Metroid.  Its a cool idea where its a randomly generated map and so some of the experience will be a bit different each time you play the game.   I like that you can get different weapons, items and upgrades as you find the different towns people that are missing within the mine.  The pixel graphics are great! i really appreciate the work that went into it.  I like the variations of enemies in the game expecially the last half of the game.

Some of things i htink need improvement - 
* Music - While its not bad, it seem repetitive and unmemorable
* Character changes with items - if you swap out clothing or a weapon, there is harly any change in appearance if none at all on him
* Non Varied combat - Some weapons are slower because of girth or weight which makes sense (big broad axe vs basic sword) but there is nothing for increasing speed or different abilities within that weapon for futher enhancement
* Money  - it can cost a lot for some items.  Most of the money drops are between 5-10 gold which takes a long time to accumulate and can feel a bit grindy

This game has been worked on for many years and the artwork, style and story shows the work it went into it.  I just think some of more detail parts should have been thought through a bit better.

Et environ 6h après l'achat day-one, une petite déception est malheureusement au rendez-vous.

Fonctionnant comme un Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Chasm vous met dans la peau d'un héros devant parcourir différents lieux tout en éradiquant la population de monstres s'y trouvant et en montant d'expérience. Tout comme avec Alucard, la montée de niveau consiste simplement en une augmentation de la vie et des caractéristiques classiques du RPG (attaque, défense, etc...). Il est également possible de s'équiper d'armes ayant toutes un feeling différent, et de diverses pièces d'armures. A la fin de chaque monde, on trouve un boss pas très difficile et une porte vers un nouveau monde, ce jusqu'à la fin. Le jeu est assez court et sauf si vous cherchez à faire le 100%, il n'y a pas énormément de rejouabilité.

La particularité du jeu est de proposer des mondes se générant aléatoirement à chaque nouvelle partie, comme n'importe quel bon rogue-like qui se respecte. Honnêtement, je ne vois pas trop l'intérêt d'un tel système, étant donné qu'une mort signifie un retour au menu, et que je n'ai pas envie de recommencer le jeu tout de suite :p. De plus, la génération procédurale amène un peu toujours les mêmes motifs qui rendent la progression dans les différents mondes très similaire.

Le côté rogue-like se voit également dans le fait de devoir secourir des villageois emprisonnés à différents endroits. Chaque villageois libéré débloque de nouvelles possibilités dans le village de base (boutique de magie, forge, etc...), mais il y a finalement peu de choses intéressantes. Le forgeron notamment est un peu inutile.

Côté graphismes et pixel art, le jeu est par contre magnifique. Chaque ennemi est unique et l'animation est excellente.

Bref, même s'il tente des concepts intéressants, Chasm reste très classique, et manque beaucoup de... charme. L'aspect rogue-like aurait mérité d'être poussé plus loin, l'intrigue est vraiment ras des pâquerettes, et il manque un antagoniste principal charismatique.

There are definitely flaws but it doesn't change the fact that this is a great game.  This is an old-school metroidvania in the vein of SotN, but actually challenging.  The game has mortal mode if you are into perma death (I am) but it can also be kept off.  It also has 4 difficulty modes and having just finished a mortal hard run (the second hardest mode) I am looking forward to trying nightmare.

I would say that there are a few tricks you must learn if you are going to enjoy the game, so if you are finding combat to be too slow and clumsy feeling, read a guide about basic techniques.  Namely, attacking just before you land after a jump, attacking during a backdash, and attacking immediately after pressing jump.  These things keep you mobile, while just standing there and attacking things will get you hurt.

Pros
The art is gorgeous and  the music is great.  The combat is fun (once you learn those tricks), and rewards patience and knowing when not to over-commit.  The platforming annoys some but I think it's perfect.  Most is pretty easy but every once in awhile there is something hard (like the swinging platforms) to keep you on your toes.  The developers are actively improving the game as we speak. Challenging in harder modes!

The cons
The advertised random generation is lackluster but this is only a problem if you are playing in mortal mode.  The crafting and purchased items are mostly a waste of time (mostly).  There is no guide or even hint that tells new players how to fight effectively.  The beginning feels like it goes a little slowly without any upgrades.  There is a lot of backtracking (although I enjoy that so not necessarily a con)  A couple really good spells make the rest seem worthless

None of these cons ruin the game imo.  I already feel like I got my money's worth with hard mode, and I am super excited to do it all again in nightmare.",1533884791,1533884938,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

So I just unlocked the double-jump and wasn’t sure where I was supposed to go next.  But I figured that’s okay, there’s rooms on the map that I marked, I’ll just adventure out and find those rooms and see what happens.  First I went back to town to buy some potions, then I checked my gear to make sure my weapon was doing as much damage as possible.  It was now time to go exploring, so I head out and started pwning fools in 2D (the floaty dudes in the green cloak that throw fireballs are clearly amazing).  Eventually I find an item that I think I might know what I do with AND I should be able to find the area of the game I need to take it to without too much trouble AND just maybe it will unlock a new area or ability.

It’s far enough to where it’s going to be a little adventure getting there, which is what I signed up for and is clearly awesome so it’s whatever.

看到老谜直播玩了这个游戏就看起来很恶魔城  作为一个ARPG城粉丝正好在月之诅咒和夜之仪式beta测试打完之后又开始缺乏恶魔城营养，就果断买下来玩了。但是这个游戏怎么说  感觉就只学了很多表面的东西，恶魔城真正打磨精髓的部分并没有学来，并且自己发挥的部分也没觉得有什么亮点。

—————————————————具体的评测部分———————————————————

1.动作和战斗

作为一个动作游戏首先要关注的当然是动作部分。这个游戏的武器和副武器可以说是忠实地还原了恶魔城的动作，单手锤和剑很月下，大剑和斧头很苍月，能买到的副武器也都是恶魔城经典。也可以小跳砍，但是落地判定要比恶魔城糟糕若干，也有看到有评测说如果离得不够远还是会吃全硬直，确实在使用单手锤的时候遇到过这种情况，是有点烦躁。然后就是急退和攻击无法互相取消也是不知道为什么没做，而且急退的距离也过长  也有一定的硬直  就不是很明白到底有什么用

然后作为一个动作手感很恶魔城的游戏，战斗节奏却比恶魔城快了很多。怪动作很快，空隙也小，对老年人就不是很友好。实际战斗的感觉比起来恶魔城更像是黑骑士传火记（Unworthy，“您不配”）。当然这个游戏倒是所有怪在你熟悉了之后都有对策的方法，比黑骑士传火记还是要好一些的。

至于boss战，听说是有无伤奖励的，但是刚开始玩的时候不知道，战斗节奏又比较快，就感觉自己的反应力和集中力不是很够用，后面知道了以后也就放弃了无伤挑战，可能也是好事吧（   所以对于boss的无伤奖励怎么样就无从知道了。不过说到另外一个有无伤奖励的游戏摸摸多拉  我倒是觉得还很OK，那个游戏的战斗节奏对于像我这样反应不够快的选手也会有一些余裕，就会有想挑战的欲望。

然后是平台跳跃部分的手感。判定我觉得总的来说问题并不大，唯一有一些问题的可能就是蹬墙跳吧。制作者就没有想过蹬墙和扒墙可能会有冲突吗……  比如有些需要扒墙等待时机的地方，跳高一点就会先蹭墙，要滑到有坑的地方才会给你扒  多出来的这部分时间可能就会被陷阱碰到了 （所以我个人就不是很喜欢平台跳跃游戏里有蹭墙的设定。之前也玩过一个叫拯救泰迪的游戏也是拿到弹墙跳的瞬间游戏体验直线下降。不过那个游戏好在你的血很多，容错率很高，在一定程度上也算一个弥补吧）

2.地图

首先是很多房间都无用地大，目测是因为程序生成一个房间的几个部分然后拼接在一起。然后又由于随机生成不好控制怪物同场，就干脆一个怪占一小块区域，导致最后每个房间都很大。然后从一开始就有，而且一直持续到最后的，很多需要极限跳跃的环节，就像某个评论里说的“我出门买包烟都要经过9次极限跳”，可以说是很真实了。而且跳跃解机关类的房间也都很大，就不知道为什么作者为什么这么喜欢虐待跳跃键。

然后跑图可以说比白夜跑路城还多，而且也没有方便的前冲，甚至到游戏最后都没有加快移动的方法，就很影响中后期的游戏体验。一旦你卡了一下关，来回跑了跑看了看，就要花费比攻略关卡更长的时间。传送点也可以说是很不方便，传送点和存档点通常也离得很远，导致大多数情况下我都会选择传回家存档，还要来的更快更安全。而且ARPG城通常进入一个新的场景马上就有一个存档点，玩ARPG城的时候就会觉得很安心，这个游戏好像没有这种保证，进了新图就像玩黑魂一样极其渴望篝火，但是你又完全无法想象篝火在哪，大概就是这种感觉吧。

这个问题我觉得可能在这种程序生成地图的机制下是无法避免的吧，包括一些关键房间也离存档点很远，离传送点就更远了。地图上也没有近路，或者是拿到后期能力以后就可以走的近道设计，可能也都是无法实现的吧。这时候就该好好思考一下这种机制要怎样才能做的适合ARPG城才行了，当然我个人还是认为有一个精心设计的地图才是保证这类游戏可持续游玩的重要因素，而不是盲目地增加随机性。

--------------------追记2018-9-6--------------------
关于地图和探索感有个老哥在不存在的网站上讲了为什么这不是一个好游戏，我觉得说的还挺好的。能听懂英文和能翻去——的同志们可以看一看
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUhl3zG1GrY
----------------------------------------------------------

综合起来的话，这些因素就极大地拉长了玩家在地图中运动的时间，导致整个流程被无意义地拉长很多，是一个很重要的枯燥感来源。

最后一个关于地图的差评就是最终boss之前明显是模仿的晓月和苍月的混沌，但是既没有传送点，就一个存档点还在地图中段，离boss一百里远。虽然可能也是特意做成这个样子的，因为进去之前也问了是否做好了充足的准备应战，但是好歹你最终boss之前给一个存档点不过分吧？

3.其他系统和机制

我感觉只能说不伦不类吧。锻造基本没用，村民也不像刻印一样个性鲜明，任务给的奖励也让人提不起兴趣，就有点不知道加入这些系统又不好好完善是为了什么。玩下来就感觉可以升级的使魔的帽子是还算让我感觉新鲜了那么一下。

怪物的掉落率也很低，我一直都是按照最高幸运来配装的，甚至连掉一块肉都很难。不过好像在我打完之后出了补丁调高了？还没尝试新的掉落如何。不过不论如何，关于这一点就更要好好批评一下没有学到恶魔城的精髓了。ARPG城通常在中后期都会给你一些能有效提高效率的途径，比如稀有戒指，黄金戒指之类的。这游戏我还专门去指南里面翻了翻怪物图鉴，好像也没看到类似于这种功能的物品，黄金戒指也就是个普通的INT戒指，还很菜。再加上地图机制的问题，就让玩家即使想刷也有点无所适从。

-----------------------------追记2018-8-13-------------------------
我又去仔细看了一遍图鉴发现其实是有增加掉落率的物品，是一把小刀……  但是它也是从怪身上掉的，而且根据图鉴来看稀有度是7……（首先你要能…………）。然后，我去试了试刷那个怪，43的幸运 打了150个，加掉落的小刀没掉。另一个稀有度是4的道具也只掉了3个。这就是加过掉落率了？
而且说句老实话，把这种功能加在武器上，你是要强迫用不来小刀的人去重新搞一套INT装备吗？
增加钱的掉落率的是一把股东限定的剑，没有其他获取途径。课金可以在游戏中获得永久的对实际游玩产生影响的优势的独立游戏我还是第一次见啊兄弟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

这就涉及到了金钱获取也让人感到迷茫。就别说带两个黄金戒指砸灯台这种操作根本不存在了，因为掉落率的原因想刷一些稀有货拿回去卖都是一件很难的事情。再加上想刷一块加几十血的肉都很难，就导致没有补gay，探索效率下降，消磨玩家耐心。

武器种类倒是跟ARPG城一样该有的都有，但是每种武器的不同武器太少了，就又导致了就那么几把家伙从头用到尾，没有强化，没有升级，也掉不出什么新的。虽然说这游戏怪物也没有抗性，要新的武器可能也是没啥用，也就换个外观而已吧。但是怎么感觉这么一说这游戏就更不堪了……

————————————————————————————————————————

也许作为一个忠实的ARPG城粉丝，对于类似的游戏要求自然会提高吧。但是我觉得这个游戏如果能再鸽一年好好打磨一下地图和系统上的问题，可能游戏体验会好很多吧。
另外因为看老谜玩的时候就已经发现音乐单调的问题了，自己玩的时候就索性关掉音乐放起了别的BGM（

It's a very solid metroidvania and is worth a buy. I'm playing the game through on hard and it's a good challenge. I think people that are aware of it's development time judge it far too harshly. I can't think of many things that live up to 5+ years of hype. Judge the game for what it is now, not for its back story.

Things I like: 
+Combat is fun and engaging
+Different  RPG weapons and drops from monsters will remind you of SOTN
+Art style and quality
+Difficulty 
+Platforming

Not a fan of: 

Item pacing: There are often long stretches before discovering new gear or etc.  I know it's generated but I wish the points of interest could happen much more often. I'd be OK with monsters not having as many unique drops if it meant finding more chests and hidden stuff. 

Hallways: The game seems to have many rooms that are simply a long hall way where you fight guys. These rooms don't feel creative but simply reskins that can be used in every area. The only excitement they really have is stopping me from making it back to a save point. To be fair there is a formula behind the code that tries to break up certain rooms so your not doing the same thing twice.


Summary: Get the game and enjoy it. The world is better for having another good game in this category. It might not be breaking new ground in every area but do you honestly care? If you are a true fan like myself you could play a hundred games that were a shadow of what SOTN was and still be hungry for more. I'm glad I purchased it. I probably will pick the game up again in a while and try another run.

This game is not for the light hearted or clumsy. If you are not skilled. You will have a hard time. Puzzles can be forgiving but combat is rather precide. this makes for a more enjoyable experience in my eyes.

Different weapon styles and magic selection provide ample options to fit your fighting style and tactics.

Game progression is a tad hit or miss. Some areas you may be stuck on and you must backtrack to a missed corridor to find an upgrade off the beaten path and then backtrack again trhoughout areas with pickups and intersections you could not previously trek.  Thankfully the game does offer a teleportation hub of sorts with shortcuts to make this slightly more easy

Game mechanics respond well to keyboard and controller. no sticky movement or ridiculous sliding further than you wanted to go, when you fall off a ledge, it was your fault, not the game.. Menu selection is fast and intuitive. game minimap makes for finding chest and suspicious areas you could not access extremely simple (the hardest part can be getting there) and the magic and upgrades make for a very enjoyable experience throughout.

Glitches bugs and crashes.  Periodically the game will darken for me but it always picks up where it left off, this is a seldom event so I consider this forgivable. I deliberately push games hard, and run multiple apps in the background to see how the game responds to alt tabbing and sharing computer resources -  This game has not yet crashed for me.

然后说说体验吧：我自身是一个从小就接触恶魔城的玩家，从GBA到现在的命运之镜再到最近的月之诅咒，掌机上面的恶魔城都玩了个遍。我觉得自己有资格说说这款游戏的好坏。  
 
从画面来讲像素风格的游戏我一直都很喜欢，就是这种老派的感觉才有恶魔城的灵魂。 

从最初的兵营走出来的时候那种怀旧的感觉扑面而来，像是从刻印里最开始的教堂走出来一样。旅途正式开始，到达村庄下矿的时候我甚至以为这游戏会有点roguelike的元素。但是他还是保留了银河战士恶魔城的种种元素，挥剑的动作跳跃的样子甚至和苍真如出一辙，非常感动。地图的设计也像恶魔城那样开始铺路中间有很多房间无法到达需要拿到后面的魔导器才能抵达。这样的设计的确会刺激第一次游玩这个游戏的人探索与猎奇的心里。  

那么问题也就来了，跑路，跑路，跑路，我感觉我拿到魔导器后就一直在重复这件事。地图真的过于庞大了，六个区域BGM也是无限的洗脑式循环。想象一下，你拿到新的技能后想回去探索之前无法到达的地方，结果是不断的跑路没有捷径也没有方便的传送点，回城卷轴卖500一张，在到达新的区域后发现只是一个小房间奖励可能是一顶帽子。而且这种感觉一直存在游戏的前期和中期。 

在后期魔导器齐全之后地图也是过的飞快，后两个区域没有传送甚至第五区都没有存档点。说实话是有点虎头蛇尾了..不知道后续有没有DLC可不可以补充一下内容。其次就是能不能把传送稍微优化一下。我觉得可以做成黑魂那样让玩家选择一下要去的区域。来回切换传送门有点蠢了。 

我不是说最好的类恶魔城的游戏是走地图不走回头路，但是回头路要让玩家觉得有价值才对是吧。走回头路的方式能不能稍微简单一些，就算地图大，回城卷轴不过分吧，问题是一个卷轴卖500有点太贵了。  
开始游戏的时候我看到有地图种子这个选项，如果地图是随机生成的那么地图的一些不平衡也是不可控的了还是希望制作组可以稍微再优化一下。因为好多时候跑断腿真的很累。

再一个就是操作上后跳没法强制取消攻击导致都不爱用后跳了还不入扭头躲怪。 
其次是这个游戏的物价和金币掉落成反比我也不知道为啥要这么难为玩家。如果说想设计的硬核一点索性就不要给回血道具与装备了，现在搞的感觉两边都没讨好。

总而言之要入手这款游戏的人你除非是类恶魔城的爱好者，不然的话可能好多地方都会接受不来给个差评。但是对于他相比2D恶魔城已经做的很好了。面面俱到什么都有。寻找NPC也有刻印的影子，装备和物品也有月下之后的RPG影子。硬核的操作与怪物的分配也是恰到好处。仿佛这款游戏就是为了为粉丝制作的一样。
最后还是劝一下想入手的玩家，先了解一下看看自己是否喜欢。无脑差评不是好事。

Easily the most disappointing release of 2018 for me.  The art work is absolutely incredible, but every other aspect of this game is either frustrating or completely forgettable.  

The combat is clunky and at times infuriating.  Each of the weapons feel mostly the same and they all feel like their reach is far too short.  Movement feels sticky because there's no way to interrupt attack animations.  You are cemented to the ground when attacking.  When you put clunky combat with sticky movement, you end up feeling cheated when an enemy hits you.  Most of the enemy attacks are telegraphed well, but since you're stuck in an animation there's no chance to react.  This ends up reducing combat to waiting for an enemy to attack before you can poke it once then retreat.  Since enemies at your current level typically take 4-5 hits to kill it turns the entire process into a slog.

The exploration aspect is usually the highlight of a metroidvania, but not here.  Get ready to back track through rooms that all look exactly the same.  Again, the artwork is incredible but when there's little to no variation between rooms it starts to get stale really quick.  The dungeons feel simultaneously huge and completely empty.  You'll end up clearing the same rooms over and over again.  Got a new ability?  Welp time to go revisit the other locations so that you can pick up a couple of gems and food.  Back tracking through a dungeon to see what new areas have unlocked should feel exciting but instead you're rewarded with a chest full of items that drop from enemies.

Games like Hollow Knight and Guacamelee raised the bar for the genre.  Chasm lacks any sort of real personality and completely missed the mark on basic things like combat, itemization, atmosphere and memorable moments.

It feels like there's absolutely nothing original or close to original about Chasm. It's a great example of how taking gameplay elements from what you like, smashing them together, and releasing that, isn't how you get a good game.

I backed this game after playing and enjoying the demo years ago, looking forward to where they took the development. After playing through the whole game to 100% to get the complete experience of what the developers built, every single drop from every monster and all, I'm coming away from the experience feeling like absolutely no one played the full game, start to finish, before release. I know that can't be true, and there must have been people who did. I want to know what they think, honestly. I don't get how this game was released like this.

I'll try to piece it out a bit. Visually? Chasm is damn pretty at the best of times. The art and overall feel of the environment is really neat. Sound-wise... I don't have any complaints, but I wouldn't listen to it if I wasn't playing. It's servicable. Story.... you're probably not playing games like this for story. So I can't give it a yea or nay on story, since I came in not expecting much, and got not much. Which is fine. Chasm is a game you're likely going to play on the basis of three things: level design, exploration mechanics, and combat.

Spoilers possible beyond here.

Chasm is on the procedurally generated (proc gen) train like a fair number of games have tried on for size recently. Its world is generated from a seed at the start of the game, which you can randomize or put in manually. This mechanic felt like the whole thing the developers wanted to focus on and emphasize as Chasm's ""thing"" at some point in development. I'm positive getting a system to generate levels like Chasm does was hard work. Post-release, it feels like a pair of handcuffs that should have been taken off a long time ago. A big part of why Chasm didn't work for me is their proc gen doesn't seem to do enough. Having to randomize only certain parts of the levels really doesn't leave you with much meaningful randomization. Levels wind up having the same core rooms and layouts to avoid breaking the flow of the game, with randomization being left to the arrangement of the non-essential rooms. If you have two points, point A and point B, and you change the way you get from point A to point B, you're still starting and ending up at the same place every time. That being so, your paths between A and B should be different enough to be exciting. I'd say the paths between core rooms in Chasm are anything but exciting. There were multiple times during my playthrough where I felt the journey across the level was void of anything but long hallways with a couple enemies. 

Having one randomization, at the start of the game, also feels like a severe limitation. A constantly shifting labyrinth sounds like a nightmare, but having the game generate new layouts while you're playing, on death or progress, might have been an interesting experiment. Not to say the devs didn't try that at some point. As it is, the proc gen and getting it to work properly likely ate a lot of development time whenever changes were made to the rest of the game. If I were a publisher working with the development team of Chasm, I would have had them scrap the system to make the core game more enjoyable. It's difficult to know what inherently is planned for the player to do and what is left up to the generator. If the proc gen was removed from Chasm early on, the developers would have been left with the task of creating a single, cohesive world with which they could fine tune along the way, giving every player the same world. I'd argue the only purpose of giving a game like this proc gen would be replayability.

Platforming action games rely on giving the player a multitude of different abilities and methods of exploring the levels within the game. How you explore the world and how it feels is just as important as the world you're making. If the world is intricate, complex, and varied, but the player explores it the same way for 10+ hours, there's going to be a sameyness to the whole experience. The back dash is the only ability you start the game with. It's likely to be the one you use the least among the active exploration mechanics, as it's slow, and tends to put you out of range of most enemies by using it. Back dashing really isn't remotely viable against most enemies in the game, with a handful of exceptions. The slide is a slide, and it's the fastest way of getting around. The ledge grab is fine, but the wall jump coupled with the ledge grab is where problems arise. The input for using the wall jump is the same as how you grab a ledge, and it takes priority over the ledge grab until you're locked to a ledge. Which means, after getting the wall jump, grabbing ledges is *less* easy and *more* frustrating than it was before getting the ability. You'll be fighting with ledges on occasion through the rest of the game. 

The final ability you get is the double jump, and it's really the only breath of fresh air in the game, at all. Exploration actually becomes really quite pleasant after getting it, since you can chain the double jump into your wall jumps to climb any vertical surface very fluidly. The fact it's handed out at the end of the game is truly a pity. Should the game have been designed around having the double jump from the start, the levels would have to be entirely different to compensate. However, the game is so much more fluid with the double jump, I wonder why the developers wanted players to experience their levels without it. Everything before the double jump starts to grate on you. Platforms are placed excruciatingly close to the limit of not being able to make the jump, very frequently. If you've ever had a moment in a platforming game where you remember ""Oh, I have to make this jump from the very edge and jump as far as possible in order to make it"", that is about 70% of every jump in Chasm. It gets painstakingly aggravating to have to approach every jump consciously from the edge of falling off. It doesn't make the game difficult. It makes Chasm an exercise in bugging the crap out of you when you have to redo a simple jump puzzle because you let off the jump button before you should have. On the whole, until the double jump, exploring Chasm is pretty droll. You have very little speed with which to trounce around the levels, and you'll be doing a *lot* of returning to previous areas. Sometimes it's a reward you literally don't need or already had, and sometimes it's the only path remaining in the game where you can proceed.

The combat is teetering on the edge of irritating, but as it is, it's just confusingly unbalanced. Melee weapons have only several types, and basic straight swords are all that you'll be looking to use. Everything else is either too slow, has too short of a range, or just can't output damage as well as a sword can. Magic (mostly the classic Castlevania subweapons with a mana requirement) is either somewhat useless, or completely broken and better than any other weapon you can possibly find in the game. The knife at level 3 is more like a knife shotgun, and at 1 mana, is the unrivaled king of efficient and safe damage in the game. It has infinite range, three projectiles, and a very short limit on how long before you can cast it again, enough so that you can spam it and kill anything before it has the chance to respond if you have enough Int. I honestly wonder if the developers knew just how good the magic knife is, and intended for it to be the best weapon in the game. If so, why even have all the other weapons at all?

I think everyone's forgetting that this is an indie studio's very first game, and when I take that in mind it's impressive considering the budget, experience and team of developers they had and the outstanding product created.

Gameplay: Somewhat repetitive, but the different weapons and armor and such allow it to evolve along with the evolution of the level of the character. Pretty standard and predictable but still simple addictive fun. 7/10

Soundtrack: Probably the best part of the game, when I was in the final boss room and the music was swelling and building, I was on the edge of my seat. I love how each biome (Mines, Catacombs etc...) has their own monsters and music to acompany them. Easy 9/10

Plot/Characters: Easily the worst part of the game. NPCs are rather basic and lack deep character and the story is very very basic. You're a soldier who has to rid a mine of monsters and a dark spirit named Ulak who...fuels the monsters power? Yeah that's not very well established, but I'm not here to nitpick. 6/10

Nitpicks? Uh, my avatar isn't holding the specific weapon I have chosen nor is he wearing the armor I have chosen. This is a  *major* problem, and one I was hoping they'd have fixed from the demo. It heavily undermines my investment in the story along with my suspension of disbelief. Also the story is super bland and basic, many of the games aspects such as exploring *every* part of a biome to get the next artifact to progress through the game can get extremely extremely tedious. Many other small things held back my 100% enjoyment of the game.

If a developer is reading this, I heavily suggest they allow new items to edit the avatar's appearance, maybe have an escape in a very strong Metroid reference (come on, the whole game is a Metroid/Castlevania reference), and er...let the map be more optional instead of having all of it be obligatory to progress.

The end of the game was great, but when rocks started to fall, I thought I was going to have to run out of the mine like Metroid's ending avoiding boulders while jumping on platforms to escape. But, that would've been how I would've ended the game, for what I got, it was still great.

Overall: For 20 dollars, this game is worth every penny. When the game ended and I got a bronze medal for my completion of the game, I felt like I *needed* to play the game again, get better at it and do better and get a better medal like silver or gold or something. Also I'm hoping to join the speedrunning community of this game. Enjoyably standard yet classic environment and story, fun yet repetitive gameplay, tense boss fights, great finale, and overall...

A great game that's a lot a lot of fun.

There is a bunch of tight platforming and it honestly can just be horrible.

Later on in the game, there are very tight jumps that can nearly stunlock you to death.
The knockback in this game is unpredictable and the [spoiler] glider [/spoiler] is horrible to use.
([spoiler]You can use it once per jump, and only if your character is moving downwards it will work. So far okay, but it gets used up if you are using it while moving upwards, even if it is 1 pixel away from the highest point.[/spoiler])

Platforming overall in this game isn't fun. It's incredible precise to a point where you have 3 or 4 frames to react, if at all.

I dealt with a lot of bullshit in this game, but the late Keep is just horrible from a design perspective. The sparse checkpoints and the incredible expensive warpscroll makes it the more atrocious.


[h1]Was waiting for this game for a long ... really long time.[/h1]

And I was at most points also really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the 'alpha'-access mindset of the development team.
When I say ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I actually mean a fair mix of bitterness and a lot of frustration.

The not met deadlines, the silence, the ability to buy into alpha access.
Where the alpha players didn't even have to keep the information for themselves, leading to youtube videos on the topic etc. (i.e. speedruns)

The way to long 'polishing' phase of the game.
The development team name switcheroo.

There are so many things I want to say about this development team and none of them are in any way good.

To me, they seem greedy, badly organized and don't care for people that backed the game to little to get alpha access to even write emails telling them that the game is released. (I found out by luck that the game was released.)


[h1]Now actually comes the review part of the game[/h1]

Is it good?

It's okay, that's all I can say.
It lacks interesting combat, has many frustrating moments, is filled with bad enemy positions on a map, leading to tedious waiting and the storyline isn't the most interesting.

Is it as good as the old Metroids?

Depends. There are fewer secrets, less hidden things.
There is a bunch of backtracking, and much of it isn't even optional.
The map is small enough to do so, but still the rewards ... are underwhelming at times.

Overall I would say it feels okay in the map department.


Onwards to upgrades and equipment

That is the worst part for me.
With one item set, the game feels nearly unfair hard. Enemies deal tons of damage, you are permanently on the edge to dodge damage, what can be impossible due to a bad map.

Then you find an armor and ... you actually walk right through the same enemies, taking one damage.
Making them less challenging and more annoying or frustrating, since you get knockbacked all over the place.

In the beginning, you will achieve said items when you leave a section allowing you to rush it.
But later on, you can get mentioned items more early leading to a section filled with damage sponges.


So why do I recommend it?

It is decent as I mentioned. The game has really good moments, but the game feels overall ... unpolished.

As an example, you can attack leading to a full animation of a swing. During this animation, you can't do anything.
You can't even use the dodge ability (backdash).
On the other hand, if you start to backdash, you still can use the sword attack.

This feels to me like different persons made a decision, leading to contradicting game-design.

And the attack animations aren't really good. I would say the attack animations on the ground feel terrible.

If you jump, it feels way more fluid and agile, but standing there being locked out of control for half a second is just terrible.

Also jumping or other forms of dodging are way more useful than the backdash. Rendering it useless to me.

This game is flawed, feels exhausting and infuriating at times. The long duration of the ""Game Over""-screen doesn't help to relieve that feeling.


But I still recommend it, if you already played Owlboy, Axiom Verge, all the old Metroids etc.

16$ is a fair price tag for the game, and as I mentioned the game is really decent at some points.

Le plus gros défaut de Chasm, c'est de faire dans le old school, le daté jusqu'au bout des ongles. Oui, le gameplay des combats est super rigide, mais vraiment (pas de possibilité d'annuler l'animation pour esquiver). Oui, c'est du pixel art et oui, c'est du metroidvania à l'ancienne. 
Les pouvoirs déblocables ne sont pas originaux : s'accrocher aux corniches, glisser, sauter contre les murs, nager (je ne l'ai pas trouvé celui-là), la lanterne, le double saut (qui vient très très tard).
Les armes secondaires sont du même tonneau : couteau de lancer, bouclier, hache ...
Les armes principales aussi : couteau, épée, épée longue ...

Le level design est très plat et malgré la promesse du procédural, il est paresseux : des salles qui se ressemblent beaucoup trop, des niveaux qui ne varient que dans la direction artistique (qui n'est pas folle : tout a été déjà vu ailleurs).
L'histoire est d'une pauvreté absolue, les PNJ ne servent que de marchands ou de dealers de quêtes secondaires (Va me chercher à dans un des niveaux).

Un autre problème est justement dans la récompense (procédurale aussi apparemment). J'ai très peu changé d'arme parce que j'ai trouvé une très bonne arme rapidement. Et quand j'arrive un passage de plateformes un peu ardu pour une récompense moins bonne que ce que j'ai débloqué sans effort, ça la fout mal. Quand ça se reproduit  régulièrement, c'est dérangeant.

Le placement des ennemis est à chier. Protip pour pas se faire chier : achetez le couteau de lancer quand vous avez libéré mémé, avancez doucement et dès que vous apercevez l'ennemi, il suffit de le bourrer avec B de loin. Il ne réagira pas. Et ça marche pour presque tous les ennemis. Dans le dernier niveau, j'ai juste pu voir le joli design de la plupart des ennemis sans les affronter.

Mais pourquoi le recommander ? parce que je crois que c'est le genre de jeu qui peut plaire à certains joueurs et qu'à un prix plus modeste, il fait le job. La partie plateforme est plutôt bonne et agréable, c'est plutôt joli et il se plie en une dizaine d'heures.
Et je ne l'ai pas fini dans la douleur. Il est plutôt simple et agréable à parcourir. Je pense que si les développeurs se bougent un peu et le patch, il a du potentiel pour devenir mieux que moyen.

Even if I don't like it, I won't slam it - I understand that a lot of hard work goes into making games. And maybe this is just because I as so excited about it, but I found Chasm underwhelming to the point where I couldn't really enjoy it. 

Without spoilers - I love Metroidvania games, and this game was missing a lot of what makes Metroidvania games great. It's got exploration, but every bit of backtracking you have to do feels tedius, and makes the backtracking you'd usually WANT to do in a Metroidvania game, to find every single secret, nearly excrutiating. The game doesn't move fast enough to warrant the massive amounts of walking, and fighting the same enemies over and over again, that the game contains. 

Every time I thought I had found a cool secret, an optional part of the game that made me feel acomplished for discovering it, it wound up being mandatory, and I wouldn't have been able to complete the game without it. The few secrets I did find held nothing interesting or special. I'll admit, there's one or two secret areas/puzzles I didn't quite finish, because again, I couldn't bring myself to do so. For an eight hour experience, this game felt so much longer. 

Chasm isn't without its merit. It handles very well, and each enemy is exciting to learn how to fight... at least until you figure out how magic works and use it to make every encounter a joke. Even the final boss was just a few potions and some spells away from defeat. Now, I was playing on normal not hard, but the difficulty shouldn't be coming from how big the damage numbers are, it should be coming from how the enemies act anyway. 

It's a decent story with a decent system, I just wish the game felt faster. By the time I got the full range of mobility your character will ever have in the game, it felt barely tollerable to move around with ease, and the game was almost over. It felt like a chore to finish the game. And if a slower paced Metroidvania with lots of backtracking is your idea of a good time, you'll like this game.

It's a useless move and not being able to use it properly just ruins the satisfaction you get from evading an attack just in time.
- The jumps are so non-intuitive is almost painful. The falling part of jumping is too fast and too slow at the same time, and I don't even know how to explain this. It just doesn't feel good and/or natural.

Given how much SotN clearly inspired elements of Chasm, I can't help but feel disappointed at some of the flaws in Chasm that come as a result of the developer having missed the point of what makes SotN's formula work as well as it does. It's a shame, too, because there're some very good aspects of Chasm that end up suffering due to the game's flaws.

Chasm's protagonist controls quite well at the start of the game, and anyone familiar with SotN will notice an immediate similarity between SotN's controls and Chasm's controls, right down to the default assignments of the face buttons. Alas, while Chasm does allow you to equip two different weapons at a time, one of these weapons takes the form of a spell. These ""spells"" are little more than Castlevania-style sub-weapons, however. While this seems like a logical approach to take to ensure some variety in combat abilities, I found myself not using spells very often and wishing that I could simply equip a different normal weapon that had better reach than one of my faster weapons.

Now, while the controls are generally fine at first, you start to run into some problems as you accumulate new abilities in the form of artifacts. You eventually get a glove that allows you to hang from ledges, thus allowing you to scale walls that have ledges scattered up and down them. You later get climbing gear that allows you to wall jump, also granting you a Mega Man X-style ability to slowly slide down walls, which in turn makes using the aforementioned glove far more touchy and tedious. Furthermore, you'd expect having these two items to open up a lot more areas to you, but the developer only allowed them to ""work"" together in the strictest possible sense, resulting in blown expectations when you take the time to return to a previously impassable area and find that it's...still impassable because the developer had no imagination in realizing how well these two items *should* work together.

Getting back to the wall jump...and Mega Man X, for that matter, the wall jump in Chasm feels TERRIBLE. In addition to it feeling downright unintuitive to use in general, you'll find that very few areas that require the wall jump are laid out in a way that makes it comfortable or satisfying to use. Too often, you'll find that platforms are spaced in such a way that you still need to grab ledges, which - as I mentioned before - gets really tedious once you have the wall jump (due to the aforementioned slide).

That's okay, though, because you'll eventually get a double jump. Problem is, the double jump just makes it all the more apparent how bad the wall jump is. Functionally, you end up with something akin to the Mega Man X wall jump once you have the wall jump and double jump in Chasm, only it's far more awkward to use because the protagonist is trying to get away from the wall with each wall jump, only to double jump back toward the wall while gaining less height than you'd actually want due to your character jumping back and forth like an idiot.

So, I mentioned before how the game continually blows your expectations. You know, this wouldn't be so bad if Chasm wasn't laden with backtracking. Look, I'm a huge fan of games like this, but the distribution of save rooms and teleporter/cave rooms in Chasm is HORRENDOUS. Yeah, I understand that Chasm's dungeons are procedurally-arranged, but it seems as though the algorithm doing this just intentionally lays rooms out in the least-convenient means possible. This wouldn't be so bad if you had an indication as to WHY you couldn't proceed past certain points in the dungeons, but Chasm lacks any means of marking multiple map squares with symbols to remind yourself what you might need to get further in those areas.

Speaking of progression, Chasm even fails to generate much in the way of excitement when it comes to building up the protagonist. Gaining levels doesn't have the impact that it should on its own, and you'll likely find one or two weapons for sale in town that're ""good enough"" and settle for those for 3/4 of the game, because anything dropped in the dungeon just feels inferior to anything you can more easily get your hands on. Furthermore, there seems to be too much of a focus on swords, with there being very little reason to use other types of weapons unless you just want to be different and underpowered. Even worse, the drop rates from enemies are ridiculously low, and Chasm seems to take inspiration from some of the worst Metroidvania-style games in existence by making many of the drops consist of crafting items that have very limited use. (And the stuff that you can craft is pretty much trash. Yay!)

Now, it probably sounds as though I'm really down on Chasm. When it isn't seriously disappointing me, though, I do find myself enjoying the combat on some level, and I have the enemy designs to thank for that. The enemy designs in Chasm are quite good, and you'll find yourself gradually having to change your tactics as you become more powerful, making your newfound strength (usually from equipment, not levels, sadly) feel all the more substantial. At first, you'll find yourself having to let enemies attack so you can exploit their recovery time, often having to do this several times in an effort to avoid damage. If you rush things, then you'll take a lot of damage at first. Once you get better equipment, though, you'll find that being more aggressive will make combat pass more quickly, but you'll still need to be careful and precise with your attacks.

Overall, I'd still recommend Chasm, as long as you go in with the right expectations. It's got some serious issues, but it's also very satisfying if you have the patience to tackle combat properly.

Chasm, game com financiamento concluído em 12 de maio de 2013 e previsão para lançamento inicial em 2014, finalmente chegou, em 31 de julho de 2018. Um clássico metroidvania com uma mecânica procedural, ou seja gera os mapas aleatoriamente, algo que seria inovador caso fosse lançado no ano em que foi prometido, mas isso não deixa o jogo menos interessante nos dias atuais, só um pouco ofuscado, pela quantidade de metroidvanias lançados.

O jogo conta a história de um recruta que quer provar o seu valor no reino e para isso ele vai explorar uma mina que foi abandonada a muito tempo, para resolver os mistérios que assombram uma pequena vila do reino de Guildean. Como podem ver, a história é clichê e apesar de ser um jogo procedural, a história é a mesma para todos os jogadores.

Chasm tem seu charme e o que mais chama atenção é claramente o seu visual em pixel art, feito pelo mesmo artista de dois jogos bem famosos no cenário indie, o [b]Rogue Legacy[/b], que é também é um metroidvania procedural, só que com morte permanente e o [b]Full Metal Furies[/b], mas isso é uma das poucas coisas que atraem no jogo, fazendo com que as partes ruins se sobressaiam às boas, com certos probleminhas que tornam o jogo um pouco chato, com destacando o [b]back dash[/b], que não cancela o ataque, fazendo com que alguns inimigos acertem seu personagem em momentos indesejados, podendo deixar o jogador muito frustrado e o [b]wall jump[/b], que é bem “zoado”, te levando a morte e muitos dos casos.

No jogo existem alguns upgrades que seu personagem consegue a medida que avança do jogo, como todo metroidvania, mas alguns perdem a utilidade com o passar do tempo, mas antes de falar deles, vou mostrar a função de cada um.
[list]
[*][b]Luvas com garras:[/b] É o seu primeiro upgrade, que ajuda ao seu personagem a se pendurar nas bordas das plataformas;
[*][b]Caneleiras:[/b] Permite que você passe por lugares estreitos, dando uma rasteira pra frente;
[*][b]Lampião:[/b] Ajuda a iluminar locais com passagens escuras;
[*][b]Equipamento para escalada:[/b] É o famoso “wall jump”, que faz com que seu personagem;
[*][b]Paraquedas:[/b] Faz com que o seu personagem plane após o pulo;
[*][b]Livro de Tradução:[/b] Traduz, para o seu idioma, alguns textos que antes eram impossíveis de serem lidos;
[*][b]Mergulhador:[/b] Ajuda a nadar embaixo d’água;
[*][b]Botas com asas:[/b] É ultimo upgrade do jogo, fazendo com que ele consiga dar o segundo pulo.
[/list]
Visto os upgrades, percebe-se que são habilidades bem comuns de metroidvanias, como o wall jump, e salto duplo e até uma que parece cópia de um outro jogo, como por exemplo o paraquedas, algo bem similar ao chapéu de pirata que a Shantae utiliza para mesma função e até mesmo um dos familiares, que seu protagonista carrega é bem parecido com [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1466013664]a espada do Castlevania: Symphony of the Night[/url], que o Alucard carrega, ou seja, o jogo é um mesclado de tudo que tem de melhor no gênero metroidvania, mas lançado de uma forma seca, bem parecido com um bolo sem recheio e nem um acompanhamento, desmotivando qualquer um a jogar novamente, algo que não é muito bom, já que a proposta dele como um jogo procedural é justamente o de jogar diversas vezes, para ter várias experiências diferentes.

A trilha sonora também é bem vazia e simples, talvez pela mecânica da geração procedural dos mapas, que faz com que não exista uma forma exata para fazer uma música específica no mapa, pois não existe um único mapa para isso.

[b]Conclusão:[/b] Se esse jogo fosse lançado em 2014, como previsto no kickstarter, talvez fosse um jogo inovador, mas com certeza não seria um jogo tão belo que vemos hoje, mas como nem todo mundo vive só de beleza, não é um jogo que eu possa recomendar só por isso, pois o seu gameplay, as vezes é um pouco frustrante e a variedade de cenários é quase inexistente, por causa do sistema procedural limitado. Talvez, para quem goste muito de um metroidvania, valha a pena comprar com o preço cheio, mas pra quem não curte, é melhor esperar uma promoção que reduza no mínimo  metade do preço.

开发者自称是月下厨，因为想每一次玩月下流程都不一样所以做成了roguevania，那么我们来看看哪里有七作城的影子
读档界面，剑类武器特效，剑类的斜下攻击，这很月下
传送门需要按顺序一个一个传，这很月轮
敌人没有防御力，HP等于硬度，这很白夜
副武器当魔法一样随身携带，这很晓月
最终BOSS是红色的，这很苍月
可以堆INT玩魔法流，这很废墟
BOSS无伤有奖励，这很刻印
急退不能取消攻击硬直，这很……

·升级回满血，这是除存档之外唯一的环境友好型回血手段，这就导致在有些时候控制经验会降低不少难度，我还记得在《新约圣剑传说》里我也这么做过，不过那里可以一直积累经验，自己选择升级（回血）的时机，要方便很多
·敌人ai很有进攻性，善于车轮战消耗主角，连挂在墙上的蜘蛛的ai都是第一时间爬到主角上方垂下来糊脸而不是保持距离吐蛛丝
·掉坑（水）惩罚高（百分比扣血，流沙消耗跳跃高度和次数，不容易跳出来）
·随机地图组合导致地图设计上限被拉低，也因此导致传送点（洞口）的位置有可能很糟糕
·中期地图有向白夜跑路城学习的嫌疑

+鞭子手感好，我tm抽爆
+等了好几年，跟最初的demo相比虽然很多机制都不一样了，但是去掉了大菠萝的随机装备我还是很高兴的
+开发者是月下厨

-同类型的不同武器之间没有除了数值和外型之外的任何区别，加个下前攻的特技也好啊
-传送点的设置为了“真实性”而变得非常麻烦，而且这一点也不真实，我的建议是：取消除了增加换版次数外没有任何意义的“洞口”，全部改为传送门，在村落存档点旁边设置一个传送门，可以一次换版前往任何一个地区的任何一个“洞口”，或者将每一个传送点都附带存档功能，这样就不用为了存档还要传回村落了
-地图随机机制虽然开发者说有过优化，但还是存在存档点（/传送洞口）过远的问题，我玩的seed整个花园上半部分地图一个存档点（/传送洞口）都没有
-很多平台跳跃很极限，不是说刻意考验平台跳跃的房间，而是平时赶路的房间都被设计成极限跳跃，说真的在没有二段跳/降落伞的时候每次跳跃都要卡边真的很烦人，可能是开发者画地图的时候有像素尺，就觉得玩家玩的时候也自带像素尺
-魔导器不能手动关闭，蹭墙跟搭边上跳冲突，而且还影响对隐藏墙的探索
-蹬墙跳操作反人类，建议跟洛克人zero学习一下，实在不行月轮也可
-地图色调很暗，在上面找没去过的地方时非常瞎眼
-竞技场给的潜水装备似乎并没有多少用武之地，能潜入的水太少了
-直到终盘也没有快速赶路的能力，我的裤子都要磨烂了

- I love everything. Art - Gameplay - Audio - Minimized story line - Retro feel - Metroidvania feel (which needs to be more practiced in my opinion) 

- The reason they got mixed reviews is that the calculation/Design  of the XP system and the currency in my opinion. 
I want to share my experience  : 

I personally found myself dealing with a puzzle in the game which was so fun but I got so much XP while solving it.  When I solved and moved to the other part of the map, my character was too strong for the mobs which made game a bit easy. Plus collected so many drops and coins during puzzle so that I could buy nearly everything from vendor too early. 
I was about to finish the game and sorted out that there had been an extra items option for the blacksmith section. Plus figured out what Tokens are for in the end. 

All in all, I enjoyed every part of it. Especially Boss mechanics are awesome.  
The overall Skill and currency design needs improvement .

操作手感有严重缺陷——
1：站A不能强制疾退！站A不能强制疾退！站A不能强制疾退！能告诉我疾退有什么用吗？
2：跳A打点低的话,直接变成站A,打怪经常被硬直坑到；
3：抓墙操作是真的恶心到我了，谁玩谁知道

地图关卡有小缺陷——
1：跑任务路程极其漫长，本不算作问题，奈何打怪的手感问题导致体验极差
2：存档点设置的莫名其妙，完全没有设计感，就瞎瘠薄放，打竞技场还要回城存，还不如直接在所有的传送房加一个
3：回城卷卖500，我真是呵呵了，不说500能买属性卷，回城这个便利功能用一次我需要刷10分钟怪赚钱，合适吗？
4：平台设计太烂，[spoiler] 我上街买包烟都能碰到9个近乎极限跳的小平台#滑稽 [/spoiler]主线流程部分高墙二段跳上墙只有10多帧的滞留时间给你按出蹬墙，自己体会
5：以上行程问题均由操作手感提供喂翔服务

滑铲—第3幕
蹬墙—第4幕→滑翔+潜水
双跳—第5幕

装备技能：
武器形态基本算全，但也没什么特殊玩具，剑类作为后期主力武器存在对低身位怪无力的短板[spoiler]跳A打点低=挨揍[/spoiler]
技能形态基本算全，只不过数值略强，一套INT流完爆STR流，考虑到光剑、真空刃之流，也不算什么
装备首饰还没怎么刷，但爆出过一件缓慢回血衣服，箱子开出使魔帽子（可升级），还算有趣

亮点：
1：BOSS设计+小怪AI很好，不能无脑跳A，中期同时出现2只怪都能教做人
2：属性梯度合理，主流程较少出现属性差距过大的情况，基本处在5刀跪的状态
3：BOSS无伤有奖励，真心赞啊！

If you want to keep your map during another play through, just type in your seed number. I think its implemented well.

I'll try to list the pros/cons but I'm sure I'll be missing some.

Pros:
----
- Seeds can be shared so you can race your friends or see what they liked about their seed, or try to beat your own time on the same seed.
- RPG style leveling up brings a nice touch as sometimes that extra level will help.  But it won't make the huge difference because...
- Gear is important and not having the right gear can turn an easy area into a difficult one.  This makes the gear progression feel better when you see your DEF jump from 10 to 20, or attack jump up by 10 points.  It can help.
- It doesn't feel procedurally generated.  Aside from a couple of repeat rooms, many of the rooms are standard castlevania style, vertical corridors climbed by jumping, long stretches filled with enemies, etc.  But it's stitched together masterfully.  And the handcrafted parts of the game (small bits), and rooms that need to be inside of certain areas, can feel very interestingly thought out.
- Weapon types are varied and have stronger versions (including boss weapons that have special effects) as you go along.  That leather whip you got will be weaker than the bone whip, which in turn is weaker than the thorn whip.  If you're willing to farm for it (there's a bestiary online) you can essentially play the entire game with one type of weapon.  There may be some gaps in time where your weapon will feel weak because a new one hasn't dropped yet or isn't available til a later area, but it is possible, I think, I haven't tried every single weapon class only runs, but it certainly feels that way.
- Metroid style progression is there and progress feels slow but it's more powerful than at first glance.  For example being able to grab ledges opens up a ton of spaces, and it doesn't feel like it until you're going back over the maps.
- Devs are very responsive on discord, and take feedback and hopefully will be releasing patches to make the game even better.
- Some of the secrets are pretty tough to find, fortunately you can get help with that later.  I put this as a pro because sometimes it's way too obvious in games.  Sometimes the secrets in this game can lead to entirely new areas, or shortcuts between zones.
- New area means new tiers of enemies, weapons, and drops to collect.  Believe me when I say that you can easily go to later areas and farm weapons and such and they will be drastically more powerful than what you can buy.
- Crafting is simple so you can get back into the game if you've been lucky with drops.  Some of the armors will keep you pretty set for an area.
- Two Familiars (One if you weren't a backer I believe) means you can have a floating companion.  It takes up the headgear slot, which is a bit of a ding against it, but the help they can provide is nice.
- Build your gear your way - If you want high STR, DEF and CON, you can do that.  If you want to stack LUK, you can do that.  If you want to be a jack of all trades, you can do that too.  There's plenty of gear to make this possible.


Cons:
----
- No new game plus.  Want to try out your friend's seed?  Level 1, No gear, final destination.  That being said the devs have mentioned making a new game mode, so we'll see as the game gets patched.
- Unable to edit map markers to say what they're for.  You also have to be in the same room as the marker to add/remove it.  This is being taken into consideration as well I've heard, so it may be patched.
- Unless you know about quest items for NPCs (well, where to find them) you can miss out on some pretty powerful gear.  There's no hand holding in this game.  Your best bet is to explore everywhere.  Or use a pre-defined seed that has a walkthrough.
- Drop rates are pretty low.  Even with the tweak recently.  That makes progression with weapons feel slow at times as sometimes the only way to obtain the next tier in a weapon class is through drops.
- Backtracking followed by limited save points feels like too big a risk for too little reward.
- No ""Fast Travel"" except back to town, so you can't save a location and warp to it or warp to checkpoints or anything that you've made.  It would be nice considering how sprawling some of these areas can be.

Personally, I love this game.  Minus the few cons I've listed I think once a few patches on a freshly released game like this come out, it'll skyrocket in popularity.  The devs are already talking further content and taking feedback into account.  I'd say it's solid 8/10 material right now and could be looking at more later.  I'm recommending this game.  Hopefully others will get it and come up with more feedback to talk to the devs about on discord so ideas can be considered and added if the team agrees with the direction.  

If you've been looking for a metroidvania recently, this is a good one.  The things it reminds me of while playing make me smile out of nostalgia and to see that some things don't change in this genre.  I hope this helps make the decision for someone, as we'd love more players, as it's a relatively unknown game (Googling anything for Chasm is a nightmare thanks to it's name being shared across multiple other games in quests or it's name or names of places, etc.)  and having more players talking on the discussion boards and discord.

Nothing can live up to that amount of anticipation and Chasm is no exception. However, there are areas where Chasm shines like the Watchers' light. (Spoilers below)

Bit Kid's biggest mistake is not doing nearly enough to differentiate itself from its main inspiration: Symphony of the Night. SotN is a masterpiece and the gold standard of -vanias for a reason. Chasm's gameplay is unfortunately a lesser clone and in many ways just serves to remind the player that SotN's mechanics are more refined (for the most part). Games that are clearly an homage are best when they still innovate and introduce new mechanics instead of simply cut-and-paste. Tom Happ's Axiom Verge exemplifies this even though the game's style more closely resembles its inspiration than Chasm does. AV feels like someone took Super Metroid and added a dozen of unique mechanics that help it stand out. It reminds the player of Super Metroid while not making them wish they were playing it instead.

Chasm's art is gorgeous. Dan Fessler has made some of the most fluid sprites I've ever seen. Every enemy shares a consistent style that evokes different reacions in context. The early enemies seemed innocuous but endgame enemies were horrifying. The environments were jawdropping and the parallax is incredible. As someone who has experience in pixel-art, this game is among the best I've ever seen (and that includes the 16-bit era).

The pacing of the game suffers from a small roster of abilities. Navigation was not fun until I unlocked the double jump ability in the second-to-last area. I understand why this is the case (thematically double-jump is the most exciting of the given abilities) but it really should have been introduced earlier. The player doesn't feel any more powerful until near the endgame which is breaking a fundamental rule of good metroidvanias. Enemy design picks up in the midgame and becomes much more fun. One of the biggest flaws gameplay-wise is the balancing of different weapons. The only weapon that beats any whip is the final sword. The whips have so much utility in terms of range that every other weapon is simply inferior. They either need to be nerfed to do like 5 damage, or the other weapons all need a serious buff.

I came across several bugs that have no business being in a shipped game. A repeated one featured the walljump ability where I would slide down a wall into the ground and be teleported up like 20 pixels every 5 frames until I was back above ground. And another occurred in the Boneworm bossfight where I was actually teleported to the top of the room where I could just see my legs. I walked off-screen to the right, was placed in the next room, went back to the bossroom and the fight started from the beginning again. Also not having the files in order at launch is a rookie mistake that needs to be pointed out.

The proc-gen was impressive and lead to an organic feeling Metroidvania layout. Horizontal rooms repeating is not an issue but a couple distinctive vertical rooms repeated in obvious ways. Unfortunately the proc-gen was marketed as the defining aspect of this game and it was so well done that I hardly noticed it.

Overall, Chasm has major flaws that prevent me from recommending this game to everyone. For Metroidvania heads, however, it is a rewarding experience by the end because of familiar mechanics and immaculate spritework. 6.9 / 10 lmao",1533529544,1533529544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

На первый взгляд может показаться, что игра ничем не выделяется среди остальных подобных, но в игре есть много приятных вещей, которые делают Chasm одной из лучших метроидваний последнего времени!

Плюсы:
+ Отличный дизайн уровней, которые поделены на секторы, а не сделаны целиком большой картой. А это значит, что легче запоминаются локации и места, куда следует вернуться после получения улучшений.
+ Музыка, графика и анимации – шикарны. Картинка на экране всегда приятна глазу и до конца игры планка качества не опускается. Если бы мне показали скриншот этой игры, когда я про неё ничего не знал, то я бы с уверенностью сказал, что это игра от WayForward, а это один из лучших комплиментов, который пиксельная игра может получить.
+ Система прокачки, возможность крафтить вещи, побочные квесты, улучшаемые заклинания.
+ Свыше 80 видов уникальных монстров, никаких перекрашиваний спрайтов! Все монстры попадают в бестиарий – игровую энциклопедию, где можно увидеть дроп и характеристики чудищ. Очень полезная штука, родом из Каслвэний на портативках.
+ Не сложная. Игра не будет требовать от вас супер-реакции или обязывать находить мощные артефакты, без которых боссов не победить. Но есть и уровни сложности, если вам недостаточно больно :) .

Минусы:
- Управление иногда отказывается делать действие за действием. Например, иногда не делается рывок после атаки или не прожимается второй прыжок от стены, когда условия выполнены.
- Свитки телепортов не бесконечны и их можно купить ограниченное количество. Из-за этого иногда приходится совершать массу ненужных путешествий.
- Большую часть времени вы будете понимать, куда нужно идти и что делать, но иногда можно просто потеряться в догадках, что же делать дальше (да, я смотрю на вас, парашют и колокола!).

I enjoyed all of the game.  Did I think certain parts could be bettered?  Yes, some of which have been mentioned in negative reviews, such as enemy placement and variety.  However, with each potentially negative aspect of the game, including the example I just described, it's really not bad because those moments are fleeting.  Continuing with the enemy example, as soon as I started to think, ""This enemy keeps showing up and I don't consider it interesting or difficult anymore,"" either new enemies showed up, the scenery changed, or a new challenge presented itself.  I realize I did not back this game, but as a common consumer, many of the complaints I have seen mentioned in the negative reviews strike me as nitpicking and/or expecting too much.

There are things such as how I feel like the randomization of room order doesn't really give me incentive to play again without other goals, but I chalk that up to my opinion and am not going to rate this game poorly for something like that.  Besides, the randomization is good because it forces you to play the game for yourself instead of looking up help.  To reiterate, I think their design choices are solid and don't detract from the game.  That being said, I come back to what I said about the game's length.  I beat the game in approximately eight hours, and that felt very short.  Games can always be improved, and if new content or a Chasm 2 comes out, I look forward to positive advancements, but generally speaking, my only complaint is that I wish it was longer.

It demonstrates the inelegance of procgen in a genre that benefits greatly from precise and skillful map design. The map introduces a level of inconsistency that throws the game off balance; difficulty seems to spike and drop randomly, and some of the most interesting systems take far too long to become rewarding.

Pros:
+ Art and music are generally enjoyable, and it stays interesting longer than you would expect for tiled maps
+ Different areas are reasonably spread out, and none really takes too long to complete
+ At its best, backtracking for missed secrets is just as gratifying as in handcrafted Metroidvanias
+ RPG elements can be fun to experiment with

Cons:
- Procgen makes the map inscrutable, and denies the player any sort of intuition to help them find save points
- Difficulty often manifests in just long stretches of enemies to claw through with ever-dwindling health and supplies
- Lots of the weapons you'll find don't feel any different from each other, and magic attacks don't really feel meaningful until after they're upgradeable
- Occasionally, parts of the foreground really blend into the background, making it hard to see the path forward

???:
-  Combat feels a lot like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which is decent but not as modern as I'd have liked.

Overall, it really could be a pretty decent game… if the map was layed out in a way that worked and I didn't need complete luck to find my way between save points. The mechanical guts of Chasm aren’t incredible, but they’re good. They’re sturdy and classic and consistent, and they’re bundled with RPG mechanics that create a couple of worthwhile vectors for customization.
I wish it hadn’t felt the need to be constructed on top of a procgen algorithm, because a well-made, handcrafted version of Chasm might have been a solid 8 out of 10.

Ultimately, however, it lands more in the 6 out of 10 range. And that’s not bad! If you're really itching for a Castlevania-like, maybe pick it up despite my advice.

Lots of tedious back tracking.

Weapons are in low variety and crafting requires searching for the blacksmith and then finding his stupid hammer which wants you to back track even more.
Enemies are repetitive in the same cycle of :walk, go after you, attack in a foward thrust motion. 
Hit boxes for larger weapons like Broadsword or Hammer need tweaking, i sticked with the plain whip for far too long into the game.

It has everything you could possibly want from such a game, but not much besides. 

This isn't necessarily a criticism, but for those hoping for an evolution or spin to the Metroidvania formula - this isn't it. What the game does do, however, is deliver enjoyable platforming, combat and exploration mechanics with RPG elements.

As is echoed by a lot of reviews here, the procedural generation of the game is slightly redundant, and only affects the game minimally. This isn't really a rogue-like, as an average playthrough will last about six or more hours, meaning unless you are speed-running the game at a high level, you are unlikely to replay often enough to really appreciate the procedural aspect.

Regardless, if you are looking for a solid and playable Metroidvania, this is definitely it. However, if your patience for by-the-numbers Metroidvania games is saturated at this point, then you may want to think twice before putting your money on the table. Otherwise, there is plenty of fun to be had and it's a thumbs up from me.

If you are considering buying this game, know that there are many better metroidvanias out there. Ori, Hollow Knight, Guacamelee, Axiom Verge, the Shantae games or even the classic Super Metroid to name a few. Then again, if you're already familiar with those, Chasm has little new to offer.

The pixel art is the only standout part of the game. Everything else feels a little too average. Functional, but lackluster.
Controls are responsive, but there are a few things, such as arbitrary recovery frames on backdash (you can just jump to cancel the recovery frames so they serve no function), and walljumping which feels sluggish in general.
The combat lacks depth. Most of the enemies follow the same general attack pattern with a few exceptions here and there. I like the boss designs, although by the end of the game you can mostly ignore boss mechanics and brute force your way through with upgraded magic and consumables (on normal difficulty).
The loot is boring, but it does what it needs to. For the most part you just get slightly higher stats than previously with no other effects. Weapons are not balanced at all; everything that is not a sword either hits too slowly or has too little reach.
Sound effects are great for the most part. The music is kind of ambient and fits the areas well.
Backtracking is pretty obnoxious, a lot could be fixed about it by making the Warp Scroll much cheaper or by offering an alternative way to teleport back to town when you're not in combat.

The randomization of the map serves little purpose as it stands. Playing through the first two areas for the second time I couldn't even point out the differences. Because there only seems to be one variation of the key progression rooms, there are only a few ways to place the room so that you can enter and exit it in the intended way. This coupled with the fact that items don't significantly affect gameplay make the actual differences between playthroughs very minor.

Overall, a positive experience despite the complaints. The game plays well enough and it seems very polished, even if some features don't feel fully realized.

The gameplay mechanics and art style are very well done. But there is a bit of a lack of overall depth, however, and a few nitpicks drag the game down a little. 

PROS: 
• Pixel Art looks great
• Combat controls are tight
• Platforming/Movement is also tight
• Enemy/Boss Design, Variety and Animations are mostly good
• Level Design is fairly decent, and easy to navigate. The procedural generation worked fine(no badly connected areas)
• World Design is varied and everything looks great as well
• I didn't have a problem with the # of save points as there are also several shortcuts that can quickly take you back to town where ypu can save as well.

CONS:
• There are dozens of weapons, but only like 6 types that boil down to only about 3 attack styles
• Loot feels a little light(I saved up money and bought a weapon in town that I ended up using for the majority of the first 3 worlds)
• The magic weapons/spells are a little lackluster, they are servicable but they're all available to purchase from the beginning of the game and you don't find/earn anymore through exploration or defeating enemies
• The procedural generation is probably not necessary.
• Backtracking can be a bit tedious
• (This is mostly my fault) There's an NPC that gives you a quest to dig up some stashes in the world, but I never found them until I finally figured out that the ""dig spots"" were what I initially thought were slabs of rock that required some kind of explosive ability, so I never opened them until very late in the game despite being able to for quite a while. I think if they just made the ""dirt pile"" an interactable thing instead of requiring you to equip the shovel as a weapon and use it on the ""slabs"" the issue would not have occurred, but I think it's mostly my fault as I just forgot about the shovel and assumed they were opened with something else I'd get later.

I decided I would read the reviews after I'd finished the game, to not affect my opinion of it.

After I was done, I was honestly stumped. The game is great, perhaps even on the level of a classic. 

The art is perfect throughout, with beautiful backdrops and fluid animations. There are a large variety of weapons, spells and unlockable items that help you traverse the levels. There are also plenty of side quests from the various villagers that you rescue from the caves, and it feels great to slowly have the village come to life on the surface. Chasm gets the progression system right; it feels like there is always some new thing to find or some new item that will allow you to get past a previous obstacle, and all the while your character is getting stronger. There is also a DISGUSTINGLY large list of enemies in the game, all beautifully animated, all of which have different ways of attacking the player and a few that require that you mix up your strategy to defeat. In short, Chasm is chock full of great stuff to uncover.

So I came back here to finally look at the reviews. A lot of gripes I disagree with, while other complaints are valid. I'll offer my opinion on some common complaints here.

[b]The game is boring[/b] - I strongly disagree. Chasm kept me hooked for basically 10 hours straight, disrupted only by needing to sleep. Some have said that the levels are samey and full of the same enemies, and while I agree the levels could be more interesting (will address later) I felt like the enemies were introduced at a pretty good pace. I found that by the time I had got used to fighting a particular enemy, a stronger version or a completely new enemy would be introduced. With all of the quests I constantly found that I had something exciting to head towards. The only concession I'll make in this area is that some of the enemies were way too easy, sometimes being attackable from out of range with no reaction. Due to the level layout this isn't possible in most cases, but there were some minibosses which were entirely killable with this method. If an update changed anything, it would be to at least have enemies aggro if you attack them from far away.

[b]I don't know where to go[/b] - Again, I feel like this isn't a reasonable gripe. There were a few times that I got a bit lost, but when I took stock of all the quests I had and also looked at the map, I would always find some place I hadn't looked or something new that I hadn't done. I felt like the game lead me but didn't hold my hand, and I never had to look up where to go next.

[b]The procgen/roguelike elements barely come into play[/b] - I agree with this. Because of the longform nature of the game (the whole playthrough will take around 8-10 hours) permadeath isn't a thing until you finish the game once (and then it's basically masochist mode). The random generation of the levels is also minimal, just using preset rooms, and perhaps sacrificed design for not a lot of return. This may have also been disappointing for a lot of players who were searching for a roguelike experience and got a Metroidvania instead. I feel like this isn't a big deal if you manage expectations, but I can understand how this may have affected reviews negatively.

[b]Spells/weapons are bland[/b] - This I sort of agree with. The spells are interesting in their own right, basically offering different kinds of ranged attacks, but the first spell you get is leaps and bounds more useful than any of the others. Once you upgrade it (which you can do rather cheaply and early into the game) it becomes more powerful than even any of the melee weapons. It's also cheaper on mana than anything else. This kinda ruins the fun of choosing between different spells for different circumstances. The balance is less broken on the weapon side. Different weapon types basically offer different attack styles (axes do a chopping motion over the head, swords slash further but only right in front of you, etc) but they didn't come into play that much. Most of the time you just want the strongest weapon and good timing attacking while jumping.

So while the game is not without its flaws, I feel like the pros heavily outweigh the cons. I strongly recommend Chasm for fans of Metroidvania style games and action platformers. It's not a roguelike! If you can manage expectations around this point, and also take your time to progress and uncover your next goal, you'll have fun.

Sur le papier ça semblait bien pourtant. J'aime bien les Metroidvania, y'a un peu de procédural - dont j'aime aussi le principe - et même graphiquement ça annonçait un truc sympa... mais en faite le jeu est très loin d'être parfait. Il est pas extrêment mauvais mais plus moyen qu'autre chose.

Le début est un peu ennuyant (premier niveau) mais ensuite ça s'enchaine assez bien et le jeu est agréable à jouer... jusqu'au niveau 5 où ça devient nimp. Globalement le début du jeu fonctionne assez bien, mais arrivé au niveau 4 la difficulté augmente et le game design en prend un coup. C'est pas tant la partie graphique qui pèche, mais bien le gameplay. Déjà dans les premiers niveaux les phases de plateforme sont parfois limite ridicules, genre un saut qui passe pas parce qu'il faut sauter au 2 pixels près du bout de la plateforme... ou encore des murs presque trop haut pour que le perso puisse monter dessus (avec l'un des powerups). Alors dans des niveaux plutôt gentil avec des checkpoints réguliers, ça va... mais alors en fin de jeu... c'est bien simple le niveau 5 cumule les problèmes de plateforme et offre 0 checkpoints, en plus d'avoir des ennemis plutôt forts. Et je rappelle qu'une mort = recharger ta partie depuis la dernière sauvegarde / checkpoint. Et en plus de ça (oui, encore), les combats finissent pas se limiter au spam du lancer de couteau. Car oui le jeu offre des magies, toutes presque inutiles, sauf le couteau qui part bien droit et ne coûte presque rien à utiliser. Et si tu l'augmente de niveau tu lances 3 couteaux par lancer, ce qui devient complètement craqué. Et à la fin du jeu, les ennemis faisant relativement mal et la magie étant quasi illimité si tu joues avec le couteau, tu est toujours gagnant à n'utiliser presque que ça puisque ça défonce tout (un coup d'épée en fin de jeu : ~40-45 points de dégâts, à courte portée ; un lancer de couteau : ~25-30 dégâts par hit, donc très souvent 25-30 x2 minimum et presque systématiquement x3 sur les grands ennemis, à moyenne portée.

Un point aussi sur la génération procédurale : même si je pense que ça peut être intéressant si on fait plusieurs partie, sur une seule partie je trouve pas ça toujours parfait. Dans chaque niveau il y a toujours des salles en double à plusieurs reprises. Ca peut paraître un peu con, mais pourtant ça se voit et ça fait moyen. Si on prend un jeu comme Enter the Gungeon (pour son côté procédural j'entend) y'a pas une seule salle qui se ressemble dans une même génération de niveau, jamais de doublons (ou alors c'est très rare?).

Sinon, globalement je donne un + pour le bestiaire qui est assez varié. On a quelques ""move set"" différents sur les armes, avec chacun des points forts et points faibles. Niveau musiques, j'aime beaucoup celle du niveau 3, sans quoi le reste est pas formidable, elles deviennent même vite répétitive parfois. L'histoire est plutôt osef, à la fois assez bateau et à mon avis mal ammené, y'a quelque chose qui ne marche pas. Le héro est un ""no name"" mais d'autres jeux ammène ça infiniment mieux (Hollow Knight, les Souls...). A mon sens c'est pas grave d'avoir une histoire en retrait (on joue pas à un Mario ou un Zelda pour leur histoire), par contre faut que le reste ça suive.

Bref. C'est surtout le dernier tiers qui me déçois car les deux premiers tiers était plutôt bon et bien équilibrés (malgré quelques défauts et le niveau 1 un peu mou). En l'état je ne recommande pas spécialement, éventuellement en solde et si vous ne savez pas quoi faire de mieux, ou par curiosité.",1533456561,1533456561,False,19,1,0.67600858211517334,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Music and Sound: 
Audially and visually, I found the game appealing. I sort of played as long as I did because the visuals were so satisfying, and the music wasn't bad enough to make me not want to play. I even found myself humming along to many themes by the end. 

Boring Rooms: 
Some rooms feel a bit empty, but I don't think this is a negative point. It happens in almost any game, unless the team goes to extra effort to cram every inch with action. Sometimes blank or slow areas have an enemy you need for your bestiary, a secret hidden in the wall, a magically hidden chest sitting in the open, or are designed to build a sense of progressive tension. 

Procedural Generation: 
I think some reviews are particularly critical because the reviewers know the maps are procedurally generated (in terms of room arrangement, not the rooms themselves). I don't see it as constructive to be so critical. Sure, the devs could tighten the design over time, but I presume they would be well aware of whether that needs doing or not. It didn't break the game, or subtract from my overall experience. 

Warp/Save Rooms: 
I don't know if it gives you extra warp/save points on easy, but I found the spacing just fine. Sure, it was a bit of a trek to get from place to place, but I think that's the point; you learn the procedurally arranged maps as you traverse them. If you don't want to go through maps a few times over (which isn't too tedious on easy) then maybe this isn't the game for you.

Guidance: 
There are definitely many parts where the game doesn't tell you where to go. It's up to you to mark any positions of interest on your map. I even drew some maps by hand for my own reference. The fact that doing so improved my experience is a good thing, in my opinion. The game doesn't hold your hand in this sense. You need to think. Got an item and not sure what it's for? Have you seen a slot in the same shape as it? Is it referenced in any of the journal entries? Sometimes you need to do the thinking and searching yourself. I liked that. 

Weapons: 
I found reviews saying certain weapons are superior to other weapons. I don't think it's this imbalanced. There seems to be spear, sword, two-handed, whip, and dagger-type weapons. I couldn't find any powerful whip or spear weapons, but I have an end-game option for the other three, which I actually switched between depending on the situation, and found each to be useful in its own ways. 

Spells: 
Honestly, I got the magic knife thing, levelled it up, and bought not a single other spell. I opted for high attack and defence instead. Can't say much here. The magic knives served me just fine. 

Combat: 
Again, I played on easy, but I found combat to be satisfying by the end. I ignored the dash button after the first hour or so of play, but I don't see that as a point against the game; it's common to not use a particular button, skill, or feature in almost any video game. Combat itself was easy enough for me to be able to plough through rooms if I needed to, and challenging enough that I had to think for a moment before approaching particular foes so I knew the most efficient way to dispatch them. Just my cup of tea. 

Controls and Movement: 
Just needs getting used to. I'm really not used to platformers, but I think I became quite good at traversing in every direction by the end of the game. If you're having trouble finding the attack animations too slow, find other ways to attack, such as hopping/jumping and attacking to get through the animation quicker, or pressing attack right after pressing dash to do both at once. 

Characters and Story: 
Don't expect to be immersed and invested. The story and characters are shallow, but it doesn't pretend they're going to be anything but shallow. Just go along for the ride, and take what it gives you. The game seems to be self-aware. Don't take it too seriously. 

Motion Blur: 
Weird, but unnoticable once you start playing. 

AI: 
Some enemies at the start make no effort to attack you. That's no secret. They wander back and forth, or sit still, or climb around platforms. You'll find enemies that try to pursue you before your first hour is up. 

Platforming: 
A bit frustrating at times, but not enough to make me anywhere close to stop playing. I just kept trying and made sure I jumped right from the edge and held the button as long as I could. Obviously becomes much easier once you get all the artifacts. 

Overall: 
Get it on special and set your expectations to medium. The game rewarded my effort, thought, familiarity, and exploration. I got almost 18 hours out of it (filled bestiary, found every mapped and hidden room, and got every chest, but not every item) and I'm happy.",1533436334,1533436334,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For background, I'm an Igavania fan, and I've even just recently re-played through Castlevania SotN, Aria and Dawn of Sorrow, and Portrait of Ruin.  This game is essentially a new take on the same formula that made those games great, plus a pretty good procedural level generation system.

Key Points:

Gameplay:
While the entire game is procedurally generated, you're given the option to specify a seed when you start a new game so that you can play through the same exact world multiple times.  The actual level generation is certainly not as breathtaking as a hand-crafted world can be, but it's good enough that the game is still very compelling, and adds an extra bit of exploration every time you start a new playthrough.

I only beat the game on normal, and I will say that I found the difficulty to be a tad on the easy side.  Regular monsters and navigating through the levels can be a challenge, but I think there was only a single boss fight where I wasn't able to beat the boss on the first try.  I'm going to play this game again on hard and see how much more of a challenge that becomes.

Combat:
A lot of the negative reviews are saying that they can't stand the combat.  While I will agree that it felt a bit off at first, I believe this was due to the fact that it's extremely similar to the combat in the Iga games, but with enough slightly timing differences that it threw me off (especially the dash).  I found myself adapting to these changes fairly quick, and eventually it no longer was a complaint.  Overall, the combat is basically what you would expect if you've played an Igavania (similar weapon thrust / swing animations), so if you didn't like the combat in those games, you won't like it in this one either.

Graphics:
Top notch pixel art.  I'm a huge pixel art fan, and even dabble in it myself, so I know good pixel art when I see it, and this game has some of the best I've seen, hands-down.

Music/Sound:
I personally thought the songs were decent, but ultimately forgettable, and certainly not as catchy as the songs in the Igavania games.  The sound effects are well done, but nothing particularly special.

In summary, if you're an Igavania fan (SotN, Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, etc), then you'll probably love this game too.

8 bit grafic is nice, Music is okay.

You have a town hub and rescue people from the dungeon as you explore deeper and deeper.

You find new ways to travel around inside the dungeon. Like a gauntlet to grip corners or a gauntlet to slide narrow corridors or a double jump.

All rooms you find are handcrafted, the layout of the dungeon is randomly generated with each game. 

Enemies are relatively easy at the beginning get more difficult further into the game. For each enemy you need to learn how to beat them. Sounds harder then it is. You could spam everything with ranged attacks.

Different weapons have different ranges. Knives have shorter ranges then the long sword or the whip.

You can build your character by equipping items. Those come in two flavors. Melee and armor and magic plus magic ranged attacks.

The bosses are relative easy. I am not the very best metrovania player, but i still managed to beat all bosses except the last in Hollowknight, i have no problems to beat the first three bosses in this game on normal. -> balanced difficulty.

Dungeons involve some backtracking to explore the parts you could not access the first time.

Monster give xp and you level your character. You can outlevel content and make things easier that way by grinding. But the next area will still give you new challenges. 

It is good game, if you like Metrovania games it is good and fun to play.

Я купил эту игру пять лет назад на Кикстартере. Уже на стадии сбора средств была доступна альфа и она была чудо как хороша — отличная графика в стиле Super Nintendo, неплохая музыка, отличное отзывчиво управление и затягивающий геймплей. По всем задаткам — суперхитовая метроидвания. Надо только подождать.
Через год в стиме появилась бета. Кое-что убрали кое-что добавили. Еще до выхода я наиграл в Chasm десять часов. И ждал релиза. Очень. Я еще не знал что до релиза еще около четырех лет…
За время пока делался Chasm вышло множество метроидваний задавших очень высокую планку качества - Ori, Axiom Verge, Owlboy, Hollow Knight. И это проблема для Chasm. Выйди он хотя бы года на три раньше критерии оценки были бы совсем другими.

Итак, Chasm вышел.
И я не понимаю что разработчики делали столько времени. Графика чудесная. Музыка хорошая. Но это та же графика и та же музыка что были в альфе пять лет назад! Разве что прикрутили к спрайту героя неотключаемый эффект медленной LCD матрицы.
Выкинута на мороз прокачка оружия гемами. Жаль. Туда же отправилась свободная прокачка характеристик. Хочешь вырастить мага? Фиг тебе. Даже скроллы, которые могут увеличить характеристики, увеличивают их рандомно. Тоже жаль, даже очень. Раньше Chasm ощущался своего рода Diablo в 2D (да и сюжет похож). А сейчас это метроидвания с элементами RPG. И срастить нормально не получилось — не знаю чем там отдел тестирования занимался но по итогу игра чудовищно легкая. Купив самую дорогую броню можно пролететь пол игры за пол часа. А если закупиться поушенами, то хоть какой-то челлендж исчезает вовсе.
Помните разучивание паттернов боссов в Hollow Knight? Можете забыть. Все боссы уничтожаются ""в лоб"". Один-два перерыва на обед посреди боя и победа у вас в кармане.
Обидно что в бете челлендж был. И паттерны Wendigo приходилось хорошо знать чтобы пройти дальше.
О сюжете стоит сказать что он есть. Как и в упомянутой Diablo – древнее зло пробудилсоь. Спускаемся в подземелье, спасаем мирных жителей, выполняем их квесты. Как и положено в  метроидвании — с бэктрэкингом и продвижением по сюжету через получение новых способностей (в данном случае оборудования — от когтей для лазанья до акваланга). Часть способностей не обязательна для прохождения но позволяет собрать больше всякого лута и получить быстрый и мощный клинок. Который практически не пригодится, так как самая комфортная ""пушка"" — моргнештерн с механикой хлыста. Дальнобойная имба с огромным хитбоксом, в том числе и сзади героя. Саймон Бельмонт всячески одобряет!
Карта представляет из себя набор заранее нарисованных комнат, соединенных рандомными коридорами-паттернами. Паттернов очень мало (где-то на порядок меньше чем в Rogue Legacy, где уровни построены по тому-же принципу). И, увы, на реиграбельность такого рода генерация почти никак не влияет. Вы прошли игру один раз? Вы видели всё.
Сама по себе ""карта мира"" маленькая. Точками отмечаются места где есть запертые сундуки. Можно поставить свою собственную точку. Эргономика прям ваще!
Еще в игре есть однорукий бандит, рулетка, две пары. Можно зарабатывать деньги, но под конец игры с продажи лута денег будет очень много. Да и как-то глупо в игре с сохранением вводить азартные игры.
Еще есть крафт. Ни одну вещь созданную кузнецом поносить не придется — даже у кольчуги из метеоритной стали параметры хуже чем у найденного в сундуке магического плаща. Руда для крафта появляется тогда когда у вас уже все есть.
Нельзя также не отметить проблемы с управлением возникающие после получения способностей. Прыгнули на платформу рядом со стеной? Сейчас вы отпрыгните от стены прямо в лаву. Но у вас есть шанс спланировать на парашюте обратно. Изо всех щелей лезет немотивированность. В паре мест необходим идеальный тайминг прыжка чтобы пройти дальше. Прыжок в комнате с двумя лучниками (о, вы узнаете что это такое, если будете играть в версию 1.02!) я сделал с десятой попытки, а кто-то после сотого трая забил на игру.

Подводя итог — сильно запоздавший продукт. Со сломанной механикой и отсутствующей сложностью. Без надежды что-то исправить патчами. Очень красиво. И стоит купить и пройти. Но не за полную цену.

Problem is, I put down $50 on the kickstarter half a decade ago, got a short demo, waited forever, and then to my dismay I can't recommend this game. If I see a major patch come out and things have changed, maybe I'll come back and adjust.

-The music is mostly awful. The town theme is great, and there are a few others, but the mines theme is atrocious, for example.
-Movement between 5 different maps is a pointlessly obnoxious PITA.
-The procedural generation makes everything feel disjointed and spread out, not fresh.
-The maps are big, but feel empty. There are a bunch of custom jumping puzzles and stuff and each individual room was hand-designed, but overall you're going to see the same 3 enemies in the next 20 same-color rooms, and most of the loot you find will be disappointing.
-Save points are too spread out, IMO, especially considering they designed every single enemy you face to require several hits to kill and the weapons all have short range (except the Elven Blade).
-There is basically no guidance on where to go next or what to do. Once you get to, say, the Gardens, you've got several maps to keep track of and you hit a point where you wander aimlessly for hours exploring every nook and cranny to find the ONE ROOM on some other map that will progress the game. Literally hours in my case, on two occasions.
-The weapons are bland as hell. It doesn't matter that there are 8 swords or whatever in the game because they all have exactly the same behavior. There are a couple that have a special property, but only the Elven Blade changes how you confront enemies.
-The loot, at least until you get close to completing the 2nd map, is largely a huge let-down. I used my starter weapon on the second boss fight because the single other weapon I found was worse. Once you get to around that point, however, it does improve as you find more stuff and can start to customize your kit.
-The spells are a let-down. They're not spells. They're just the special weapons from Symphony of the Night, basically. If you were thinking spells as in Aria of Sorrow, nope.

One good thing about the game is the pixel art. It's consistently fantastic. Sadly, you stop paying attention after 20 rooms of the same thing, so it diminishes the impact. 

Shutting the backers out of the design process entirely was a bad idea.

If you like the genre in particular, you're likely to derive more fun from this one. I enjoyed this game. It's a bit on the shorter side, but procedurally generated levels should add some degree of replayability. I'm hopeful the devs invest a bit more time for some features people have asked for like a New Game + or some additional content, because there is a lot to expand on here.

Pros
+ The art style is beautiful if you like pixel art. A lot of really likable character and enemy designs.
+ I found the game length to be a plus. It's a little bit too short at ~8-10 hours of play, but I'm a busy person and a game I can beat in a little less than a week hits the spot for me.
+ Procedurally generated levels work surprisingly well. Maybe this is just the seed that I got, but I was surprised at how logically laid out the levels were, how balanced the enemy progression seemed, and how well placed items were.
+ I didn't have nearly as much of a problem with the controls as some people have. There are slight hitches and delays in control, but I found it to be part of the experience and just how timing worked in this game.

Cons
- There is a certain amount of sameness to the levels, and there will be a couple of parts of each area that leave you thinking, ""Wasn't I just here?"" The vertical rooms with crawlers are the most repetitive.
- Weapon balance issues. The sword seems to be the best weapon for timing and balance. I tried using some of the other weapons, but I found them to be much too slow to react to most of the enemies. The game design puts timing and health preservation at a priority, so you feel every missed swing. Magic also becomes much more overpowered as the game progresses, and I found myself much less likely to use weapons at all when I had a ranged magic attack that did 150% the damage of a weapon hit at virtually no mana cost.
- Enemy progression. As you move on, boss fights actually become much easier since you are more able to simply wade in and do massive DPS and say ""screw it"" while just soaking up enemy attacks.
-Some bugs. A surprisingly large number of sub-bosses are happy to sit at the edge of the screen and let you blast them with magic until they die without putting up so much as a peep. If at least a few enemies attacked once they took damage, that would fix this issue.
- Still just feels a bit short. Again, I listed this in the pros, but if you're expecting an epic 80 hour game this is going to disappoint. If you take it for what it is, it's quite nice, but at $20 I can understand why people would want more content. This game doesn't live up to Hollow Knight - but again, if we're all being honest, HK is criminally undervalued at $20.

That's a longer list of cons than pros, but I find the positive points to be more important. Overall, I have zero buyers' remorse for this game and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it with the above caveats. If the devs have the commitment that those who worked on Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight have had, this could continue to become a better game over time. The procedural generation adds to replayability, and it would be easy to further extend that.

Some game systems have been implemented half-assedly, such as magic, story, zones, movement in general, and even upgrades that make you able to reach new areas. Acquiring new parts to any of these does not feel rewarding as it doesn't really tie well into the game. Furthermore, movement abilities such as the wall jumping feels terrible compared to how other games have implemented similar systems.

- Due to the character powerups, There can be a possible progress bug due to the procedural dungeons.
- ...subject to change.

Art is incredibly beautiful, the best thing in the game.

The controls have the standard castlevania symphony of the night, but a little slower on the issue of moving and attacking. 

Enemies are predictable and have one or two movements, which repeat themselves.

As a fan of metroidvania I do not regret having acquired the game, it is more a title for collection.
But some things frustrated my experience in the end.

 -  Text and more texts, collecting pages from the story seems to be just an artifice to explore the whole scenario, or complete an achievement of what really tell you about the game world. The story is not bad, it's just poorly executed. They could introduce flashbacks and cutscenes for example, in the bosses or when finding some intem importte, it would help in the immersion of the world of the game.

 -  Rescue personages. It may seem like a futile remark, but I fell into disbelief as I drove through corridors filled with strong enemies to rescue a person trapped in a cage and that someone would come home alone with no weapon or armor. Without being disturbed by the moments of captivity and risk of death. One or two sentences repeated in the dialogs. No character is well built to empathize with the player, and easily fall into oblivion. Rescuing people is one of the protagonist's motivations and has nothing memorable or rewarding when performing the task.

 -  Disposable items. There are standard rooms with platform challenges, with precise jumps to reach a chest with an item at the top. And many points on the map with isolated chests in hard access. So much effort to find a lower item than you already own. the best items are bought with the gypsy, and are more useful than the more expensive items in the game.

The player starts off with very little by way of mobility and no magic, and by the end of the game has typical mobility upgrades that allow them to traverse and backtrack to progress through the story as well as save optional villagers and do optional sidequests. It also features an EXP system that gives levels and stats and a town full of villagers to purchase magic, potions, materials, and other things. 

I had heard that it had a lot of roguelike elements in the game, and  if people are solely looking for a roguelike game, this is not going to be the game for you. Randomization appears to be, based on a playthrough and a half as of the time of this review, critical locations that are set in the same spot with tiles to connect them pulled from a pool of appropriate ones. In the grand scheme of things this means that over all variation is still fairly small, and I haven't really encountered much by way of difference with the exception of unlocking a few villagers in a different order. It does change the gameplay somewhat, but I wouldn't really call it a roguelike. The permadeath system is only unlocked after beating the game once, wherein the player can opt to play on a one-life mode similar to Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode.

All in all, I enjoyed the experience. The game took about 10 hours to finish, and I suspect it could be done easily in about 6-8 if the player is willing to eat food rather than backtrack for savepoints like I did and they don't focus on doing most of the sidequests or getting all of the map like I did. 

The gameplay was fairly fun. I enjoyed the controls and only had a couple of sections where maneuvering felt awkward. The bosses had enough variations that they were interesting, though I think the game's balancing leaves them a little on the easy side and the mini-bosses are a bit of a joke that can be easily cheesed by throwing daggers outside of their aggro range.

TL;DR - I enjoyed the experience and enjoyed the controls, with the occasional bit of clunky platforming. There is enough enemy variation to keep it interesting, though mini-boss AI is a little silly and bosses feel a little on the easy side. The game does not feel remotely like a roguelike, but it is a nice metroidvania. It doesn't particularly feel like it excels at anything besides possibly the villagers and sidequesting which aren't something I see often in metroidvanias, but it manages to not feel particularly poor in any area besides being able to cheese at your own discretion.

you have a dodge move, a jump, and a sword attack - you can also duck while attacking, and pick up magical attacks, the first available is a magic dagger for long range attacks.

you delve into the cavesm save people, loot stuff, go back to surface and gear up with new stuff, get new spells, and continue onwards.
you gain new skills over time, and the progresison in that sense is fine. you will see areas you can't get to right away - make a mental note to return once you have the proper ability ( like a roll ) 

p0ersonally, I like this game - it'sd fairly challenging, and HP is hard to come by , so you need to be more cautious when youre in the beginngin of the game.


you canno tskip the ridiculous intro when starting a new file ( or if you die before saving when you start a new game ) that is VERY annoying, so I can unsderstand why some less-skilled players might be giving this game a bad review.

A bad game is one with faulty mechanics, poor controls, bugs, glitches, etc.  A bad game is a game that fails to deliver on its promises.  A bad game has a terrible plot.  A bad game has something wrong with it.  Chasm has none of those issues.

Chasm's mechanics work fine, and the controls are tight.  Chasm delivers on the promise of a rogue-like metroidvania title.  Chasm has a simple, and perhaps somewhat cliche, but solid plot.  There is nothing actually wrong with Chasm.

This all makes Chasm a decent game.  Decent, but not great.  It's a mediocre but servicable platformer, and I fear that mediocrity is a result from the premise itself.

This game tried to be Hollow Knight and Dead Cells at the same time, but honestly should have stuck with one or the other.

Lemme explain.  Chasm is a game that takes several hours to beat, and each new playthrough will have a randomly generated map.  But unless you're going to be doing a speedrun, or a no damage run, or whatever, there's really only two maps you'll see: The one you get for Normal Mode, and the one you get for Hard Mode.  There's no real incentive for multiple completions on this game.  If the game had permadeath and unlockable upgrades for each playthrough, I could see justification for the Rogue-Like map generation feature.  Instead, the whole feature kinda feels wasted, and that it might have been better to have put all that effort into creating a single larger, more expansive and more impressive map.  Instead, it''s a procedurally generated map, and it feels like the game suffers for it.  The full maps feel too big for a Roguelike, but too short for a Metroidvania-style RPG.  Neither fish nor fowl nor good red herring, the game tries to be too many things at once, and fails to be any of them.

The enemy variety is kinda low, compared to many Metroidvanias, as is the number of bosses.  They all have a pretty basic attack and movement pattern, and you'll rarely ever aggro more than one or maybe two enemies at a time.  Combat isn't necessarily challenging, but small mistakes result in taking damage, and given the distance between save rooms, that damage can add up, especially combined with the fact that most mistakes in platforming end up with you taking damage as well.  There's a lot more focus in this game on platforming than on combat, and there's a few jumps that will require perfection, or you'll take damage.  Worse, perhaps, is that navigation feels incredibly linear.  The unlockable upgrades are received in a very straightforward ABC pattern, and the bosses are faced in a similar fashion.  Worst of all, perhaps, is that there doesn't feel like there's much in the way for exploration: Side paths tend to be a couple of rooms with a treasure chest at the end of a platforming section or a small puzzle, or just one room with a couple of destroyable crates.  That's it.  And the overwhelming majority of those chests will contain only a single item of widely varying usefulness or quality.

And then there's issues that are outside of the Roguelike nature of the game: Item prices are way too high for a game where money is a random drop, and in the early game money drops seldom and in small amounts.  Having basic magic spells cost 300 to 400 Gold when you're usually getting gold in 5's and 10's almost feels insulting.  You'll usually get larger drops from crates, but those aren't common enough to justify high prices.  While most purchasable items are not required to progress, things like magic spells, new equipment, and especially potions are almost cruelly expensive, yet ironically help make combat easier, so they definitely make progression easier.  Chests with good equipment are few and far between, so a player will most likely be saving nearly all their gold for new weapons and armor until they unlock the blacksmith's ability to forge new equipment, and then will likely be using their money to buy potions.  Healing item drops, while not uncommon, don't give much in the way of health, while purchasable potions offer major heals, but are almost too expensive to justify use outside of a boss battle or the most desperate situations.  Worse, perhaps, is the fact that save rooms are very far apart, and enemies always respawn right after you leave the room, so backtracking is just as painful as forward progress.  So, if you're nearly out of health, have no health items, and are a long way from the last save room, you have two options: Hope the next room you go into is a save room and risk dying, or use an expensive warp scroll to escape.  That's if you have one, of course.

It's a shame: In terms of core mechanics, Chasm is a solid game.  If they'd spent the years it spent in development making a single larger, more sprawling map with a better economy and a wider variety of enemies, bosses, and items, this would be a great game.  But by making this game a Rogue-Like Metroidvania RPG without the major elements that make Rogue-Likes, well, Rogue-Likes (Permadeath with unlocks each playthrough to aid future runs), or that make a Metroidvania RPG entertaining (a large, sprawling map with plenty of non-linear exploration that reaps great rewards), the entire project was doomed to failure, and it is a testement to the team's ability as programmers that they were able to turn this into an exercise in mediocrity when it would have been a garbage fire of shame and failure in the hands of a lesser dev team.",1533358318,1533358318,False,26,0,0.652013897895812988,2,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're a metroidvania enthusiast and you want some maps to explore, some items to collect, and some enemies to fight, then Chasm does all of that just fine. It's never exceptional at those things, but it gets the job done without much much frustration or any gamebreaking flaws along the way. Where Chasm genuinely does shine is in the art and animation department. Visually the game is gorgeous. The pixel art is colourful and varied, the animation is smooth as heck, and it's all accompanied by some catchy music that's pleasant to listen to as you adventure through several different environments and biomes.

What really drags Chasm down is unfortunately the way it uses procedurally generated levels in place of hand-crafted stages. Certain key rooms are properly designed, but they're all connected by repetitive, samey combat corridors and vertical shafts. The intent here was to make the game more enjoyable to replay, but sadly it has the opposite effect of making the level design so bland and forgettable that I find myself with no desire to revisit it. This is compounded by a rather sparse amount of save rooms and teleports, making the hefty amount of backtracking the game requests of you something of a chore.

When it comes to its core mechanics Chasm is, as mentioned, relatively solid. Not great, but still decent. Your character responds smoothly enough, and attacks are telegraphed fairly. Some of the mobility upgrades you obtain are a little clunky in their responsiveness, and the lack of any kind of pushback on your attacks makes the dated problem of ""enemies walk into you when you try to hit them"" something of an annoyance, but these things aren't by any means gamebreaking. Bosses are alright, if a little bland and forgettable, and the item and town progression elements are a cute, if somewhat shallow extra. The game's story is straightforward and generic, but it barely intrudes on the gameplay, so it doesn't hamper the experience either.

Chasm is one of those metroidvanias that ultimately feels like it's a little too enamoured with Symphony of the Night to find its own voice. Had it come out ten years ago (or perhaps when it was first pitched as a Kickstarter project) it probably would've been regarded as a very fun and neatly designed entry into the genre. Unfortunately metroidvanias have evolved significantly since those days, and simply doing the same things SotN did doesn't quite cut it any more. Now we have games like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest to look up to as the monarchs of the genre, and when stacked up against its modern counterparts Chasm falls significantly short.

In terms of difficulty and play time, I managed to 100% the map and town completion in eight hours with only a couple of deaths. This is one of those games where the difficulty is largely determined by how many consumables you buy/grind to sustain yourself (again, much like SotN). The main challenges you'll find will be self-imposed ones, which I personally don't have a problem with. Cheesy tactics can overpower most encounters in the game, but Chasm's combat wasn't tight enough for me to want to fight everything 100% fairly in the first place.

Despite the negative sentiment to a lot of this review I do still think Chasm is a good game worth playing. It's just hard to sing its praises beyond the quality of the art because it doesn't really define itself through anything new or interesting otherwise. If you want a game that does a lot of the same things Symphony of the Night did, you've got it right here. It plays decently, has lots of nice flavour fluff, and it looks and sounds great. But if you want something new, fresh, and genuinely fantastic to play, then there are much better options out there in the metroidvania genre right now.",1533339629,1533339629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The enemies can get slightly repetitive/monotonous when it comes to countering them. A lot of the enemies have similar attacks, making the way you approach and counter them a lot alike, which feels somewhat repetitive, but no biggy.

The game overall is very smooth and responsive, beautiful art, great soundtrack, and extremely nostalgic(for me personally). I do wish there was voice acting, and that the story grabbed you more in the beginning, but thats not a huge deal. Very Castlevania: Symphony of the Night like. Which is why I was so interested in it. 

If you're looking for a great metroidvania, you're in the right place.

And even though there's things to like, I find myself, in my head, pretty much counter pointing every pro I can think for this game with even bigger cons. 

The major issue and question, though, is: Was it worth the wait? Honestly, no, it wasn't.

This game took 5 years since being Kickstarted. Not inherently an issue in of itself, but the thing that stings is that they clearly spent most of this time ""perfecting"" random generation in level design, which is honestly a completely wasted gimmick.

This game all in all is a bog standard Metroidvania. It lasts for anywhere from 10-15 hours. Having random level design is pointless because there's just no use for it for 90% of people. This is a one and done game. I will never see the reward for such a gimmick, and likely not many others will either. And the randomization isn't even all that great. The progression stays the same. You'll face the same bulwarks and item acquirements. It's like changing the furniture in a room. It's just not all that interesting or meaningful.

Time should have been better spent on the mechanics elsewhere. Item and RPG mechanics are slight. And dear o lord the backtracking.

It's a 10-12 hour game, depends if you do bosses without getting hit.

[h1] Negatives	[/h1]
[list]
   [*]Combat is the most basic stuff you can imagine, fighting enemies boils all down to dodge their attacks get some hits in then repeat until the enemy is dead.
    [*]For all the weapons you get there are only a few animations (some have a different colour), for me that is a missed opportunity that you really only have 4 animation types for all weapons.
   [*]Magic is whatever is only used 2 out of 5 or 6 because they are just that much better (maybe there are some builds that use the other ones)

   [*]The backtracking is annoying and most of the time useless, it's not fun to just run through corridors of meaningless monsters to just find something that you don't even need. 
   [*]The jumping mechanics are sometimes weird.
   [*]The world most of the time doesn't feel dynamic or fluent because you just have a corridor where you meet 1 monster.
   [*]The combat is really not that fun, as said it's more dodging then make a few attacks.


[h1] Positives [/h1]

  [*] Nice artstyle
  [*] music is ok
  [*] if you try to kill all the bosses without getting hit you have a challenge (except the last boss because fuck that path to him, also he is the only one that felt like a hard fight)


[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
 That was my first 2D metroidvania and i did enjoy playing it most of the time but there are so many things that are just OK

Other than it's difficulty, I have no idea why people seem to dislike this.  Sure, the story is minimal, so far, but it doesn't have to be an epic every time - I'm more than intrigued by the basic premise.

To be fair, I got it WAY cheap on sale and I didn't Kickstart it.  It sounds like it went through some Development Hell, looking down below.

Still, if you just want a hard (and that's on Normal!) MetVan game, I'd easily recommend this.

Notes:
- I am only about 25% of the way through the game on Normal difficulty.  It's hard.  Not like Darkest Dungeon or Dark Souls or anything, but it's hard.  Expect to die a lot.
- The procedural generation is an interesting idea, even if it's not something you REALLY need to have here.  It's not a roguelike, after all (though maybe a ""roguelike"" option for the REAL masochist...?).
- Upgrading your equipment (not counting spells) looks to be one of those ""no longer a thing"" things.  Methinks they should find a way to return that function to the game.
- Learning Scroll upgrades a random stat.  Idk if there's any ""single stat"" or ""choose a stat"" items, but...that'd be cool.  Also you can buy Learning Scrolls from the magic gypsy lady, but they're expensive.
- My first villager rescued was the magic gypsy lady.  Acquiring the Magic Molotov spell was very helpful in the early portions of the game.

Movement and controls feel great and very responsive, and while a few jumps were annoyingly tight, the platforming was fun.

Unfortunately, however, combat was just a huge turn off.  As so many others have said, it just feels clunky and awkward the way you're locked into a ground attack unable to cancel by jumping or using the back dash. Your attacks do little damage and also lack hitstun, so you're completely open to attacks while stuck in these long attack animations, and most of the enemies I encountered that don't just ignore you or attack from range do so by rushing at you.  You have to adopt a pattern of baiting an attack, jumping in for one hit, avoiding the next attack, repeat.  Add to that your low total health, the damage enemies do, and the scarcity of recovery items, and combat quickly became a chore I did my best to avoid entirely.

I get that the idea is for you to learn enemy patterns and time your attacks, and I can understand that the devs wanted to make the game challenging, but maybe advertising as being inspired by hack n slash dungeon crawlers isn't the best thing to do when you have a combat system like this.

I've seen several reviews that mention something along the lines of ""if you liked SotN"" or ""if you love Igavanias"" that this is the game for you, but as a long time veteran of the genre, who still loves and replays several of those titles to this day, I don't know that I would say the same.

[list]
    [*]Прекрасный пиксель арт дарит красивую картинку. Враги, окружение, локации, анимации, сам герой - всё в гармонии и радует глаз. 
    [*]Враги. Их много и их поведение разное и интересное. В начале пути будут классические враги-идиоты с ИИ первых игр про Марио, но чем глубже в подземелье, тем они ближе к попоразрывающим врагам соулс-серий.
    [*]Исследование мира. Подземелье большое ветвистое со множеством потайных мест, ловушек. Нашлось место даже нескольким простеньким загадкам.
    [*]И конечно чувство ностальгии
[/list]
О [b]минусах[/b] игры:
[list]
    [*] Магия. От подобных игр как-то интуитивно ожидаешь магию и стрелковое оружие. Если стрелять из луков вообще не дают, то магия есть. И лучше б её не было или хоть назвали это иначе. Что такое магия по мнению разработчика? Магия, это когда ты кидаешь топор, кинжал, коктейль молота(шта?). Можно сослаться, ну типа такой особый вид боевой магии. Так вот этой магией обучает классическая ведьма. В самой игре при этом враги умеют кастовать настоящую магию и стрелять из луков.
    [*] И опять о магии. ""Магия"" имбалансна. Играл именно от ""магии"", поэтому вторая часть игры показалаь очень простой. Правильно снарядившсь, можно наносить громадный урон без необходимости близкого контакта, при этом маны тратиться минимально.

Минусов описал больше, но по факту, там лишь придирка к системе магии, а так игра качественная, но не стоит ожидать от неё чего-то нового в жанре. В игре примерно то, что можно наблюдать в трейлере и на скриншотах. Не больше и не меньше. Если нравится подобное - берите.  Цена высока, но для новинки нормально. А со скидками когда будет, так вообще отлично.

It's not a perfect game, by any means. Just gonna do a list of pros and cons, and talk about things I like and didn't like.

Pros:
-The core of the game is fun. Platforming, combat, everything feels very precise and methodical, and it feels good to get good at it.
-A perfect difficulty. Not too hard, not too easy.
-Tight controls. I rarely feel like my character didn't move the way I wanted.
-Loot and RPG mechanics
-Reminds me of Symphony of the Night
-Boss designs are fun
-Enemies are varied and all act very differently.
-Art is pretty great

Cons: 
-Procedural generation. It feels out of place here. Why did it have to be generated? To try to drum up replay value? If you make a really good game, the replay value will be there. Just look at Symphony of the Night, still being replayed to this day.
-In some ways, the combat is very annoying. Unlike SOTN, when you attack, you are locked in that animation a bit longer than you think you would be. You've swung your weapon, done the damage, but it essentially gives the enemy enough time to smack you. So, you can't hit them until you wait for them to miss you first. This turns into a game of running towards them, baiting out an attack, and then swinging, and then repeating that process until they die. For a game like Dark Souls, this style of patient methodical combat makes sense, but in a 2D RPG platformer? Not as much, and sometimes it's quite irksome, especially with my next point.
-The backtracking. It's worse in this game than any metroidvania I've played. Get ready for hours and hours of backtracking through the same levels because you got a new powerup and missed this one area back on level 1. I know SOTN (my main comparison) had some too, but it didn't seem to take nearly as long as it does in this game. I have 6 hours in the game, and I beat the second boss, and the rest of my time has been spent backtracking and running around.
-It's pretty fucking cryptic sometimes. Now, don't get me wrong, I like games that don't hold my hand. But some stuff is just plain confusing. For instance, I backtracked for about an hour to go to an area that was extremely difficult for my level. I made it through, but all I got was a hat. A bird hat. A level 1 bird hat. I have no idea what it does. It summons a bird if I wear it, but the bird does nothing. So, I went to an altar that needed a feather, assuming I needed the Bird hat. It did nothing. So, I wasted around 2 hours achieving nothing but confusion.
-Really annoying enemy placement. See, the AI in this game can be kind of douchey. As soon as they notice you, most will just shuffle towards you as close as they can, and try to attack you repeatedly. Unfortunately, this can happen if you're on a seperate platform. They'll go to the edge of the other platform, and just swing at you repeatedly. So, your options become A. Spam magic at them until they die, using up a chunk of precious mana. or B. Jump and take a hit. It feels really bad, since you didn't do anything wrong as a player. The enemy was just on the tiny platform you need to jump on. And what's worse is some of these enemies have projectiles, and will just shoot you, making jumping over near impossible without taking a bunch of damage.",1533291741,1533291741,True,1,0,0.497059732675552368,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Only played through once so far, so I'm not sure about the seeding or randomness.
Played using xbox360 controller. Pretty smooth controls using always jump attacks.

It was fun for the ~11 hours it took me to do one full playthrough. I was very impressed by the art style, the smoothness of the platforming and the combat, and the joy of exploration and discovery. The pacing of upgrades is satisfying and leveling up through experience feels like a reward and never like a grind.

My criticism lies in the illusion of variety. There are swords, clubs, whips, knives, punches, a spear, etc for weapon types, but I mostly stuck to ""club"" swinging weapons because of their large hitbox area. Using only jump attacks negates the downside of their slow attack rate.

The magic attacks I never really used. It was just easier to hit things with my unlimited club than to use limited ammo magic attacks that dealt less damage.

It was also a little disappointing to find so much useless equipment. Often the best part of finding a piece of armor is that it sells really well so I could buy more healing potions.

If you like any castle vania title this game will definitely be good for you.

I like how they are making the game challenging and not giving us everything

If you don't like retro games like SOTN then don't bother.


That being said, no game are perfect upon release and yeah some bugs are present. But i can't believe they wont be fixed in the coming updates.
My downside;
Equips other then weapon don't change character's look.
I wish there was more spell.


My Upside,
Immersive game play that keeps you on the toes.
Large area with lots of secrets and backtracking purpose
Not too easy!
Not too short.
Fluid character combat movement
Precised target area for each weapon
SFX ON THE MONEY.

Peoples' primary complaint is the combat and ""same-y"" looking rooms.  Well, the combat in the first area *was* a little weak, but as soon as I got to the second major area, the combat has been just fine.  It's an old-school style metroidvania with old-school style gameplay and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  As for the same-y looking rooms?  Each of the areas is pretty huge, but there are a variety of different areas.

I've played many metroidvanias, from super met to hollow knight, and despite the mixed reviews, this is a good game. 

the control style that people are complaining about is basically an intentional throwback to SOTN, not because of lazy programming or bad design. the random generated levels arent bad at all, either-0- the game is somply old school style, with limited ways you can attack and move around. if you hate old school style controls, give it a pass. 

But for those of us who enjoyed SOTN a lot, this combat style is extremely satisfying. Give it a chance. It's weird and jumpy but so fun.
It befuddles me that people are being so harsh to a clearly old-school style game by raging at the almost exact duplicate of SOTN controls. Also, although generating the environment differently every time has its drawbacks, it forces each player to find thier own way and renders most of the internet hive mind guides useless, which essentially forces players to experience it as gamers did before guides on the internet. To me thats 100% worth any repetitive environments. and they really arent that bad.  

Bottom line: This game is a love letter to SOTN set in a beautiful medieval world.

TL;DR
Music: It's alright, decent. Sound in general is also pretty standard/good.

Graphics: This is my kind of style, I love pixel art and I think the animation is well executed.

Gameplay: Overall, I really enjoy it, as a fan of pretty much any Igavania title, it gives the right vibes. It has a little La Mulana mixed in, which I don't mind.

Setting: I like the atmosphere. Areas get a little same-y.

Level design: I think the level design is fine. I read some people find it ""uninspired"", but I don't mind them. Maybe I got lucky with the procedural seed. There are some okay trap rooms and platforming, but I found them unfrustrating. It might be worth mentioning I'm playing with a keyboard.

Controls: I think the controls suffer a bit, but I'm getting used to them and find them tolerable, if clunky. The lack of animation cancels are a moderate annoyance, which I will now rant about.

Rant:

One of the best parts of SotN's controls was how responsive they are. Chasm really locks you into animations, you're committed to attacks in particular, and their cooldowns don't feel good.

If there's anything I'd like to see in an update, it's these:
- Ability to backdash out of a swing recovery. Some animation canceling for movement, please. It feels terrible how rooted you are.
- Ability to grab ledges in spite of an air attack. Again, animation canceling. Let ledge grabs and other movement tech take priority over the damn attack animation, it feels awful.

All said, I'd still recommend this game.

I'm a sucker for pixel art and Metroidvania-style games. I wasn't aware of the procedural aspects of the game until fairly close to release, however, that is a non-issue as far as I am concerned. 

On the whole, Chasm is extremely mediocre. Spell variety is limited. Exploration is a chore. Combat is tedious and boring. If Chasm had come out 5 years ago, it still would've been an underwhelming experience. The charming art style and presentation isn't enough to cover up incredibly dated gameplay. I can't think of a single thing that Chasm does that hasn't already been done, and been done better. With recent offerings such as Hollow Knight, it seems odd that an extremely formulaic, unoriginal and monotonous game took so long to finish. 

The story presented is extremely confined. Color palettes swap occasionally, but the game takes place solely in samey-looking tunnels. Combat is an exercise in tedium - wait for an enemy to finish it's telegraphed attack, jump in and attack, then retreat, rinse and repeat. There is no character development to speak of. Backtracking is an absolute chore and every single new power requires you to traipse through dozens of samey-looking rooms to find the one room that is now accessible with your new power.

While the game has different seeds to make use of the procedural world generation, I just don't see the point. Rearranging the samey halls filled with the same braindead enemies to look in samey-looking rooms in different locations to find the items to move forward sounds less like fun and more like busywork.

Rooms will repeat, and overall the world just doesn't have that designed, thought out feel to it. It's fine as it is, but it's just not great. In my instance, it was fun to explore initially, but then when it came to backtracking it was a massive drag as the map did not facilitate that well, especially in the end-game.

This game isn't fun! That's the real TL;DR

I'm so incredibly disappointed that I can't recommend Chasm.

I backed the game on Kickstarter during its original campaign at a tier that allowed me to play the Alpha builds. What I played then was promising, I thought - An interesting take on the formula, with large, randomized maps and puzzle solutions. I thought that the small flaws in combat, the maybe too-tight jumping puzzles, the lack of balance between weapons and magic, and the lack of enemy variety would be something that was solved as development continued. This hope was only further boosted by the long dev time and how responsive the devs were to feedback. I'll always wait longer for a more polished title, and it seemed that we were going to get that.

The final product, sadly, lacks polish that some of the genre innovators had nearly two decades ago. There is ""enemy variety"" in terms of the sprite work - which, I'll say, is fantastic - but many grounded enemies can be boiled down to ""Walk at you > pause momentarily for windup > dashing attack."" Every enemy will also tend to start that windup at the same distance, making baiting out their attacks incredibly easy. This wouldn't be an issue with interesting enemy arrangements forcing you to keep track of a couple or several even spacings at once, but enemies ALWAYS occur one at a time in a linear fashion as you progress down each hallway. A notable exception is that the spiders in the Keep can be close enough to one another or another enemy on rare occasions if your map just so happened to be generated such that they spawned that way, but this will vary from save to save and player to player.

Let's get into the meat of the combat. This is by far, after the art and sound design, the absolute best part of the game, though still with major flaws. There are only a handful of weapon types in the game. The vast majority of weapons you'll encounter are the longsword type, which a quick, short range poke in front of you, and the broadsword type, which is a massive overhead swing. There are some spears, whips, rods (higher damage, slower swing longsword as best I can tell), and daggers and fist weapons which are incredibly difficult and unrewarding to use due to their small range and the fact that every enemy's entire hurtbox is also a hitbox. Attacks on the ground will always play their full animation, but attacks in the air can be animation cancelled by landing properly, allowing for a decent learning curve in figuring out how to pump out a lot of swings quickly.

It's a shame that magic makes this pointless.

Chasm also has secondaries a'la Castlevania, force-mapped onto the alternate attack button. These can be quickly swapped between with the shoulder buttons (but weapons cannot). Originally the system here was magic or weapons could both be used in either hand, and balance aside it's disappointing this was cut. Every usable magic spell is purchased from the mage vendor, and upon completing her quest she gains the ability to upgrade your spells for gems. There are five spells - dagger that flies in a straight line, fire puddle that you throw and persists, shuriken that flies straight at an angle, axe that flies in a short parabola above you and then falls, and a magic shield that puts some hitboxes in an orbit around you. Upgrading the dagger and shuriken increases the number you throw per cast, and upgrading the axe makes it larger and deal more damage. I don't know what upgrading the other two does because the dagger, as of time of writing, is INCREDIBLY BROKEN.

Enemies in the game have no invincibility frames upon being damaged. This does allow for some of the weapon animation cancels to actually be useful. when it comes to the dagger and shuriken, however, this entirely breaks any semblance of balance the combat has. Each dagger and shuriken deals the same damage as the single you start with, making each upgrade a MASSIVE increase in the damage of the spell. The base spells are balanced versus their cost fairly well at first(only one mana), making it possible to cheese out some enemies from range but not an entire map's worth. At first. Firstly, spells are buffable via increasing your intellect stat, and the gear you can find and buy gives you a TON of it. Secondly, the plethora of mana orbs from all of the enemies and lanterns keeps your mana healthy between shortcuts back to town after you have enough INT or have upgrades to the double dagger. The triple dagger further trivialized everything, with bosses dying in maybe ten seconds with barely a dent to my mana pool.

The main issue here is that this spell (and perhaps all of them) are buffed much harder by INT than physical attacks could ever be by the companion stat STR. There just isn't a way to put out that many physical hitboxes to make STR worth investing in - but even if you could, that would still mean enemies dying prior to you even possibly dying to their damage output.

I wish this was the end of my critique, but it's not. Movement does not feel good in Chasm after the opening segments. Wall jumping is a staple of the 2D action genre as a whole, and this is its worst incarnation by a long shot. You're first trained to a pseudo wall-jump timing by a notch cling upgrade you get early on that is fairly responsive and virtually lagless. The wall jump feels like a downgrade to this because of the pause upon getting to the wall before you can jump off of it and the slowness of the special jump animation from that point. The wall jump upgrade also gives you a wall slide that frequently interfered with my ability to cling to a ledge, making platforming in some of the hazard-filled rooms INCREDIBLY frustrating when I would think I had clung to the edge, press jump to vault over it, and instead jump away from it and often into a hazard or enemy. It doesn't make sense to me how badly this is executed given that early 2D action games like Megaman X and Super Metroid already have done it, and better.

It's worth noting that most of the NPCs you rescue feel pointless. The blacksmith is useful very briefly but balance rears its ugly head again and even the hardest pieces in the game to craft, requiring a ton of grinding at the end of the game, are worse than random drops you can find hours previous. The innkeeper sells food that can heal you, but you can find the potion girl first, and her items heal for more, outright, and as far as I can tell she doesn't have an inventory limit like everybody else. Gold costs are utterly trivialized by the card player and slot machine, if you're patient enough to sit there and do it over and over again. One guy gives you a quest to grind kobolds for Venison, which I did at the VERY end and even with like 35 levels worth of LCK and another of the NPC's quest items boosting it by a further 7, a whole HOUR of my represented playtime was this grind. For another longsword-type weapon.

There's more to be said for some of the major backtracking being unrewarding, the bosses not being particularly memorable or difficult, how healing from a pause menu in 2018 really isn't acceptable in an action game anymore, and that one complete bullshit enemy in the Keep (the one in the Arena, within which enemies appear to have vastly higher damage) that for some reason teleports and fires instantly, resulting in one of my three total deaths in the game. I won't say more, though. I've said enough.

Sadly, this wasn't worth the five year wait for me.",1533223326,1653804638,False,12,0,0.550946056842803955,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Chasm is the epitome of everything that makes the genre what it is - exploration, fighting through halls of enemies, getting gear to open up more exploration, panicking to reach that next save point to heal. Admittedly, much of the content development seems to be focused around the procedurally created environment, so if you're not interested in replaying the game, or in it being layed out differently each time, then you may not get as much out of this game as others. Still, a solid 8 hours for a Metroidvania is nothing to brush aside (and that's just for some. Still plenty of game left after I passed that mark).

And the controls... exactly what I feel they should be. Responsive, predictable, and smooth. Full control of your jumps and different weapon types with varying swing delays - it's like playing Symphony of the Night all over again. I can't comprehend how controls can be a common complaint in other reviews, except when they try to compare to more fast paced, action-y games like Dead Cells which don't use delays, just constant attacks and movement. It depends on what you want to play though - Castlevania (Chasm) or 2D Warframe (Dead Cells). 

Story elements are light on the surface, just a basic 'help our townsfolk' on the surface, but includes extra bits of lore about what's really going on underneath littered throughout the dungeons. Definitely not enough for story buffs, but it's interesting enough.

Waited five years for this game, and the only possible disappointment will come when it's time to put the controller down ^_^

Edit:
Okay, so a few other disappointments ;).

Gear is awkwardly paced through the game. By the time you can afford to buy from the blacksmith, you've probably found better from drops or chests. By the time you have enough metal bars to craft gear with the blacksmith, you almost certainly don't need any of it.

Money is similar. In the start when it would be useful, it's hard to come by (understandably so), but once it starts rolling in easier, there's not much to use it on. I bought all the magic spells just because I could, and from there, I imagine I'll burn everything I get off on the random stat increase scroll - since you can apparently buy more then one. Being stronger is good, right?

Well, it would be more so if there was a New Game+ mode. There's only so much point in buffing stats near the end. Maybe it'll get added in the future though.

So all around, I still enjoy the combat and movement style, but that is really the only draw after awhile. Take it as you will.",1533219943,1533500696,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Wstęp:[/h1]
Z biegiem lat różnice pomiędzy Casltevanią i Metroidem coraz bardziej zaczęły się zacierać. Po latach nieustannej walki o pozycję lidera zawitała na świecie harmonia i wraz z nią nowy podgatunek growy nazwany METROIDVANIA. Podgatunek, który bardzo pozytywnie wpłynął na współczesny rynek gier video. Hollow Knight, Ori, Momodora, Axiom Verge, czy też niedawno wydany Iconoclasts to tylko parę gier próbujących oddać duszę starej Castlevani z zupełnie nową mchaniką. Niezależny Chasm jest kolejną grą, która na dość oblężonym rynku próbuje wpisać się do historii jako następca słynnych i popularnych niegdyś tytułów. Aczkolwiek czy młodej grupie zapaleńców prosto z kraju sukcesu, pieniędzy, koksu, i pięknych kobiet - Ameryki, udał się ten wyczyn? 

Mówi się, że stworzenie dobrej gry wymaga wiele czasu i precyzji. Zdarza się że twórcy nawet mimo wielkiego wsparcia tworzą grę okrągłymi latami i tak samo było w tym przypadku. Chasm śmiało można nazwać dość chwalebnie ""grą legendą"""". Pierwsze wieści o grze pojawiły się już w 2013 roku, natomiast niecały rok później gra została sfinansowana na Kickstarter zbierając blisko 192 tysiące dolarów. Proces produkcji był długi, męczący, i wiele graczy straciło już nadzieję na to, że gra kiedykolwiek zadebiutuje
W końcu jakby za sprawą telefonu Gabe Nawella zdarzył się cud - twórcy ogłosili, że gra jest skończona, oraz że zadebiutuje na komputerach osobistych, a także konsolach 31 lipca 2018 roku za dość przytulną kwotę 72zł ($19,99). 

[h1]Rozgrywka[/h1]
Chasm często mylnie był nazywany ""roguelikiem"",  choć rzeczywiście trochę prawdy w tym jest. Podziemia są całkowicie losowo generowane. Deweloperzy zapewniają, że każda nowa gra powinna być nową przygodą w zupełnie innym świecie... Właśnie ""POWINNA"". Bardzo często pokoje się powtarzają w różnych typach podziemi, co jest sporą bolączką Chasm. Gra oferuje dość prosty, ale zarazem ZAJEBIŚCIE WCIĄGAJĄCY gameplay - wchodzimy do mrocznych zakamarków podziemii, zwiedzamy, walczymy, ekspimy. Często jak to jest w topowych metroidvaniach musimy się wracać do poprzedniej lokacji, aby coś nowego odblokować. Gra oferuje blisko 6 unikalnych typów podziemi. Każde z nich będziemy swobodnie eksplorować. Możemy pójść w prawo, możemy pójść w lewo, możemy pójść do góry, możemy zejść na dół, możemy ekspić i zbierać na zupełnie nowe bronie. Gra nie zmusza nas i oferuje ""małą swobodę""... Małą - ponieważ zawsze nieważne gdzie pójdziemy będziemy wracać do punktu wyjścia i zawsze, jak to przystało na typowę metroidvanię będziemy wracać w poprzednie lokacje gdy coś nowego odkryjemy. Zakamarki podziemi różnią się stylem, budowlami, przedmiotami, przeciwnikami, kończąc na zagadkach. Bardzo często w podziemiach napotkamy różne typy npc'tów. Często droga do nich jest przepełniona pułapkami, ale WAARTOO. Każda odblokowana postać teleportuje się do naszego miasteczka. Możemy z nimi rozmawiać, kupować, jak i sprzedawać przedmioty. Niestety gra nie posiada czegoś takiego jak ""questy od npc"", mogłoby to znacznie wpłynąć na rozgrywkę.

[h1]Fabuła:[/h1]
Pod względem fabularnym Chasm nie jest za bardzo rozbudowany. Otrzymaliśmy prostą, ale zarazem dość klimatyczną historię. Gra opowiada losy młodego niedocenianego żołnierza Daltyna, który został wysłany w celu znalezienia zaginionej załogi górniczej w małej górskiej miejscowości Karthas. Tajemnicze miasteczka widmo będzie nam towarzyszyć przez całą grę. Bardzo często będziemy do niego wracać w celu nabycia nowej zbroi czy też nowych przedmiotów. Na samym początku miasteczko ma charakter miejsca opuszczonego, nieżywego - I o ile jest to zamysł twórców aby podkreślić marazm tego miejsca, to z czasem gra na tym bardzo cierpi

[h1]Grafika[/h1]
Jestem wielkim fanem pixel'artu, a jeszcze bardziej efektów cząsteczkowych pikseli i Chasm miał wszystko czego oczekiwałem. Gra pod względem graficznym bardzo przykuwa i często w drodze do następnej lokacji staniemy w miejscu, zrobimy ss i będziemy podziwiać pięknie wykonany krajobraz. Wszystkie animacje drzew, animacje walki, animacje chodzenia, a nawet animacjie wody są ślicznie wykonane

[h1]Muzyka:[/h1]
Na wielką chwałę zasługuje również świetnie zrobiona muzyka. Prosta bo prosta, ale w całości oddająca ducha starszych retro produkcji. Muzyka jest bardzo klimatyczna i przyjemna dla uszu. Co ciekawe, każda lokacja zawiera inny podkład muzyczna, a także podkład dźwiękowy. Efekty dźwiękowe istnieją. Nie są może na bardzo wysokim poziomie, ale są wykonane na naprawdę profesjonalnym poziomie. Przeciwnicy, woda, wiatr, a nawet zwykły kamień gdy na niego nadepniemy wydają różne dźwięki

[h1]Reasumując:[/h1]
Chasm była to jedna z tych gier, w której pokładałem wielkie nadzieję. Liczyłem na prosty, ale przy okazji świetnie zaplanowany gameplay, który w pełni oddał by ducha starego Metroida, czy jak ktoś woli Castlevanii. Niestety Chasm przyjął się na steam, a także innych platformach dość średnio i  tym samym rozwiał moje wszystkie wyidalizowane marzenia o tej grze. Gracze słusznie podkreślali, że gra jest momentami za wolna, zbyt trudna, niesprawiedliwa, a sam system walki jest denny. I niestety rzeczywiście tak jednak. Mimo wszystko Chasm jest to naprawdę bardzo dobra gra, w której bawiłem się świetnie. Niezwykłą przygodę w tajemniczym, niewybaczającym, zagadkowym uniwersum Chasm uznaje za udaną. Warto kupić, ale za maks 60zł

Before I get critical, I want to say even with its flaws, this is still THE BEST METROIDVANIA to come out in a very long time, and if you are a fan of the genre, you should stop reading and just buy it. The cons are really only cons when held to the gold standard that is SoTN. With that disclaimer, here are the things that I think miss the mark, even if just by a hair.

The jumping feels really good, but with jumping backdashing and sliding being uncancellable, and jump height being just a hair too low, trying to avoid boss patterns can be a bit annoying.

Drops are scarce as hell, I've leveled up before i got a drop on more than one occasion, this combined with the SoTN way you dont know what enemies drop until they've dropped it, makes item discovery a pain, and something you probably just wont do. Money is a drop. and money is pretty scarce in its own right, up until mid game.

The last complaint is the enemies are a bit easy. They are sometimes difficult to avoid, and sometimes take too many hits, but you can pretty much just walk through them.

None of these are dealbreakers for fans of the genre, good metroidvanias just dont really come out. If you enjoy that kind of game, pick this one up, if you don't, well this one isnt for you.

Running into over 75% of the enemies in the game follows this exact pattern: you're walking down a tunnel, and then you spot an enemy sitting there alone, possibly patrolling left and right slowly. Your progress is halted completely as you stand near it, waiting for it to slide forward and swing their weapon at you / shoot their projectile. You jump over the attack, then do a landing air attack on it, then if you know the enemy is slow enough you get in another attack or two. Now you wait for the enemy to attack again, so you can repeat until it's dead.

Hard mode gives enemies 50% more health, so in the above situation, you need to wait through at least one more attack cycle for each enemy you run into.

Why is this so painful? The clunky feeling of melee combat. Swinging while on the ground locks you in place for a half-second after your swing ends, and that's for fast stuff like swords or daggers. Doing midair attacks with the sword felt like it was always the safest and fastest way to do melee damage. If you could backslide or jump to instantly cancel ground animations on most weapons, it would make things so, so much more fun. Or, if your attacks caused any real enemy stun or knockback, especially when using big, slow weapons.

Melee weapons feel very limited in scope. Swords have a good balance. Knives don't attack fast enough for how little reach they have. Spears/whips/greatswords are slower and have long delays after attacks and don't animation-cancel when you land from air attacks. And, that's it for melee weapons.

Spells are lackluster. You have access to all of them very early in the game, and none of them feel inspired or exciting, especially if you've ever played Castlevania. Upgrades are really underwhelming for half or more of them. I ended up using upgraded daggers for the entire game because it was up to three hits for only one mana per use.

The exploration abilities you unlock feel like they're out of order, and only one of them gives you a new way to attack enemies. They make you wait until the very end of the game to give you the one that would make the rest of the game feel so much more fun to play. I can understand wanting to toss things up a bit by subverting expectations on when you get which upgrades, but in this case I just shook my head and imagined how much more fun the game might have been if I could do that since beating the second boss.

Platforming is frustrating and often unnecessary. There are platforming rooms where there are no dangers at all to falling, except if you mess up a jump with about two pixels of leeway you fall to the bottom and get to start over. The wall jump is so delayed that you need to buffer your jump before you hit the wall, otherwise you slide... sometimes making you fall off. There are vertical tunnels placed JUST low enough to reach, so sometimes you have to try repeatedly to properly get a wall jump started, which could have been resolved by having the tunnel start like five pixels lower.

Long stretches of hallways between save points / fast travel points and an extreme lack of money in the first half of the game make every bit of damage you take a potential reason to backtrack for free heals. Backtracking is particularly tiresome in this metroidvania thanks to the repetitive backdrops, especially when you're traveling to grab a chest, and it just turns out to be a white chest with some money and a gem inside, or a weapon objectively worse than the one you're already using.

For me, the roguelike elements were a waste. It took me 10 hours in-game time to 100% the game (except the bestiary), and I felt frustrated or bored for hours of that. Why would I want to play through the same boring tunnels again with the rooms swapped around?

They didn't hardcode the maps to have a save point near the arena, AND the healing/mana refillers outside of the arena are only good for one use per visit. Did you get hit on the way from the nearest save point and want to have full HP before the arena? Sure, you could use the red healing fountain... but then after the fight you will need to survive returning injured to the save point.

Fight your way to a chest through long minutes of backtracking and want to return home to save your progress without dying on the way? Just use a warp scroll. Except, you'll only find 2 in the game, and buying them costs 500 gold each. That's a ridiculous, overwhelming amount! They should have been 25 or 50, not 500. EDIT: And apparently the shop can run out of them, so even if you grind enough money from the slot machine to buy more of them you're out of luck eventually.

Want to travel through the gate system from zone 1 to zone 5? Stand in front of the gate and press up, wait three seconds for animations, press up, wait three seconds, press up, wait three seconds, press up, wait three seconds... And, now you can move on.

All in all, this adds up to a pretty mediocre metroidvania bogged down by endless frustrations and a lack of richness that might have been due to the focus on making it a roguelike. I am almost jealous of the people who look forward to replaying this multiple times, because I kinda wasted my time 100% it just once.

但是细节方面还差的多。例如进村子后雪上行走没有脚步，动态效果少

撸掉4个BOSS。BOSS战跟月下就差的不是一星半点了。月下可以说撸BOSS有一种快感。但是这个游戏没有。干巴巴的感觉。
小怪方面基本熟悉后可以无伤。

可以说完了10个小时，有一半的时间都是在跑图。跑跑跑。。。我还以为我买了个跑酷游戏，还没有跑酷游戏爽。。

打击感还行。听说不是有什么暗黑风格的掉落。。不好意思。。没感觉。只能通过不断切换地图刷新小怪来刷装备或者素材。
有铁匠后，拿到锤子能够打造一些武器和盔甲。

魔法系统略显鸡肋。没有魔杖类似武器。更没有什么搓招系统。（或许有，我搓不出来）

目前武器就是小刀（攻击范围奇小，直接PASS）剑（攻速一般，有一定硬直）大剑（攻击力略高同价格的剑，攻击速度慢，范围大，不好用）锤子类（同大剑），鞭子（攻击呈现一条直线，范围比剑长，跟大剑差不多）。还是老实的用剑吧。

系统整体不完善。如果想要达到月下水平。暂时还没看到月下的屁股。

这游戏最烦的就是赶路。没什么快速移动的方法。滑铲来说稍微快一些。只能说是聊胜于无。不知道再后期是否有快速位移技能。

好在按键能改位。原始键盘位十分憋屈，建议键盘党一定改键位。

总体来说暂时不值价格。但是建议玩玩。
如果跟《死亡细胞》对比。手感，节奏差距巨大。

一周目完成了。
什么赶路技能是不存在的。乖乖的慢跑吧。

一些之前因为（魔导器）拿不到的箱子。在后期显得毫无意义，属性低，不如当时装备。不过是一场空洞的跑图。

最终BOSS就是一只大眼睛。必须一直跳起来才能打到。而且经常闭眼睛。闭眼睛的时候是打不到的。

建议将魔法系统升级后，用魔法系统打。比如飞刀，飞镖等都可以。尤其是飞镖，本身就是向上标的。一标3个。把智力堆上去后，比用什么武器都伤害都高。例如我现在36智力。3标都中就是108点伤害。用武器一刀也就是几十的伤害。武器在后期显得鸡肋无比。不如用技能打怪。而且MP也是够日常探索用的。打BOSS完全几十点魔法值就够用了。

中后期可以拿到一个帽子，召唤剑（有点像是月下）。还一个帽子召唤小鸟。抱歉。纯粹就是一个宠物。虽然有攻击能力。但是靠这个打怪。别想了。

流程方面，还算比较容易。不看攻略只要乖乖多跑跑没去过的地方，都是可以走的通流程。

The game has many great ideas, but bad implementations of those ideas:
- Almost all weapons feel the same, boring, not rewarding or satisfying to use.
- From all the sub weapons, the upgraded knife can carry the run, because it only cost 1 mana and does x3 it's damage.
- The damage formula is bad and there's no scaling. For each point of STR, you gain 1 flat damage regardless of the weapon you're using (so the faster and more projectiles you can dish out, the more overall damage you'll be doing, which is why I said the knife is too good).
- Interesting mechanics, such as familiars, should not be linked to head pieces, especially if the familiar has a level linked to the head piece.
- The game is too grindy and long for its own good. Gold is very slow to accumulate and items drop rate is very low. By the time a weapon drops from enemies, the weapon is outclassed by something you bought/crafted.
- The character attacks could be more fluid and allow canceling/dodging/jumping to avoid incoming attacks, instead of stalling/baiting enemies and taking turns attacking (this gets old really fast for normal enemies).

Враги без анимации? Ну да, самые первые действительно просто идут на вас. Они, по сути, тренировочные.
Босс имеет две атаки? Так он тоже ради обучения. Да и не босс он по сути, просто жирный моб.
Прыжки с пиксельной точность? Вообще не нашел таких.
Кто-то даже писал что когда персонаж визуально приземлился, на самом деле это не так. Чушь. С управлением вообще нет проблем.

Из озвученного пожалуй согласен только с бэктрекингом (возврат назад ради каких-то недоступых без определенных умений мест), телепорты есть только между этажами и пометок на карте реально не хватает. То есть даже когда ты видишь место в котором не был, ты не знаешь что тебе там нужно. Иногда это двойной прыжок, иногда ползание. Пришел без нужной абилки? Облом! И обход этих мест может быть долгим. Впрочем не для всех это является проблемой.

Отскок назад сосёт, он слишком медленный и короткий. Попробуйте ""Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia"" и вы поймете о чём я. Впрочем пока что мне это не мешает, враги телеграфируют свою атаку очень рано и многих можно просто перепрыгнуть, а потом напихать в спину.

Графика это отличный пример того как нужно делать ""пиксельные"" игры. Задача художника выразить максимум деталей при помощи минимального количества пикселей. Многие думают что можно просто нафигачить пикселей и их игра станет ретро, но это не так.

По геймплею это самая что ни на есть классическая метроидвания, вроде ""Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night"", только медленнее и с процедурной генерацией. Описанные выше проблемы не портят впечатление, тут всё еще интересно бродить и исследовать подземелье.

Had a permadeth run on nightmare, died in like the 4th area. Honestly, I could've done better but wasn't mad. 

Just kinda annoyed since I spent a chunk of the time farming health items to restore me since save points don't heal you on this difficulty (for the added challenge but also annoyance, would've been better to just have a full recovery when in town)

For context sake, however, this is a game that's been worked on for half a decade, and released just around the time when Hollow Knight got the word around of being a good game, and The Messenger would come out just abit later and both would prove to be impactful and fresh with ideas that had to a degree some success and effect on future, some inspired games.

This game, on the other hand, is okay. It's neither so bad that it'd make for a fun case study, but it's also uninspired and overall shallow as it feels like a reskin of the Castlevania series I grew on. Being a metroidvania player gives that sort of bias.

I won't go too lengthy on it this time around, but I will say that there are no general problems with the game, afaik. Loot system's kinda unique(?) with different rarities, although probably exploitable in some cases, combat is semi-simplified but on harder challenge you're required to prepare to loosen up some MP for trickier foes, there's also some cool hidden item effects that you have to find on your own but that's where the pros end.

The game overall had too much of a focus on procedural generation that it made levels feel hollow and not really memorable in any sense, whatever unique puzzles that were around ended up being lackluster and not thought provoking (although it is a metroidvania, so I wasn't expecting anything in high regard on that one).

So anyways, here's a final recommendation after another 12 hours sunk into this: It's not terrible, get it if you want a metroidvania like, but if you're expecting something more interesting or in a higher quality...Yeaah there's definitely more on the market for about the same price.",1533184656,1657974290,False,2,0,0.4601307213306427,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Если быть совсем корректным, то это клон Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance - упрощённой версии Симфонии Ночи для Gameboy Advance. Родство определилось, когда я открыл меню инвентаря, такое же консольно-минималистичное, и увидел скопированную один в один систему атрибутов. У персонажа четыре основных параметра - СИЛ, ИНТ, КОН и УДЧ, да тремя буквами, как-будто какие то системные ограничения помешали написать слова целиком. Ну и понятно, остальные аспекты игры также скопираваны из Кастельвании.

[b]Экипировка.[/b] Также как и в Кастельвании, герой может использовать самые разные виды оружия. Мечи, булавы, ножи, копья и, разумеется, кнут [strike]охотника на вампиров[/strike]. Имеются также и различные виды доспехов и экипировки, которые, к сожалению, не отображаются на вашем персонаже. Наконец, в Chasm есть различные предметы и ресурсы, которые можно выбивать из врагов. Система фарма такая же как и понятногде - есть небольшой шанс, что из монстра выпадет какой-нибудь предмет. Что-бы повысить этот шанс надо надеть аксесуар, повышающий атрибут LCK, то есть УДЧ.

[b]Вспомогательное оружие.[/b] Помните топоры, метательные ножи, кресты и святую воду? Всё это есть в наличии, но в слегка изменённом виде. Так вместо крестов, в Chasm герой использует бумеранг. А взамен святой воды используется ""магический Молотов"", что я нахожу забавным. В отличие от Кастельвании, в этой игре вспомогательное оружие можно прокачивать, но прежде нужно спасти торговку, которая продаёт заклинания, и выполнить для неё задание. После улучшения, поначалу жалкие, метательные ножи стали наносить такой огромный damage, что я почти позабыл про свои мечи и кнуты.

[b]Артефакты.[/b] Что за метройдвания без артефактов, благодаря которым герой получает новые способности? Ну, в этой игре всё традиционно. Можно сказать банально, это зависит от ваших взглядов на ""старую школу"".

[b]Бестиарий.[/b] Бестиарий это самая интересная сторона подобных игр. В Chasm он большой, качественный и интересный. Полно отсылок к Кастельвании - летучие мыши, разные скелеты, мумии, анимированная броня и летающий глаз. Есть отсылки и к серии Метройд. Есть отсылки и к другим играм, например, ""мясной"" человек или ассассин с характерным капюшоном. Все монстры мастерски нарисованы и анимированны - пиксель арт в этой игре с большой буквы А. Также все монстры отличаются разным поведением и разными паттернами атак - приходится изучать приёмы монстров и подбирать почти под каждого свою тактику.

[b]Геймплей.[/b] Играется Chasm, очевидно, как вы сами поняли что. Герой бегает по коридорам и выбивает из [strike]канделябров[/strike] фонарей [strike]сердечки[/strike] ману. Боёвка в игре ""олдскульная"", ну или немного кривоватая. В этом месте есть за что игру покритиковать, но мне не хочется, потому что я думаю что это сделано намеренно. На любителя, короче. Также в игре есть паззлы и полосы препятсвий из ловушек. Кстати, в этом аспекте Chasm превосходит Симфонию Ночи, где, если я правильно помню, был на всю игру один паззл с ящиком. Один! Но, в этой игре упор всё же больше на коридорные драки. И мне кажется, что раньше у игры было другое направление, если судить по альфа-версии. Это субъективно, но мне бы хотелось больше хитрых ловушек и паззлов. Но, в целом, хорошо и приятно играется.
Наконец, надо сказать про процедурно-генерируемые локации. По словам разработчиков это самая значимая возможность игры. И честно говоря, это провал. Потому что на игровой опыт это влият минимально и это только формальный повод поставить игре модный нынче тэг ""роуглайт"". Сами комнаты с ловушками созданы вручную, меняется только их последовательность. Во-первых, я уверен, большинство людей пройдёт игру один раз. Во-вторых, последовательность комнат не влият на геймплей и не создаёт уникальных ситуаций. Проблема в том, что существует игра Spelunky - вот где процедурно-генерируемые локации. В Spelunky уровни мутируют просто радикально, что многократно повышает интересность игры. Каждый раз это действительно новая игра. Кто играл, тот меня поймёт.

Самая большая проблема Chasm это её большой ценник. Игра Hollow Knight, новый эталон в жанре метройдвания, стоит дешевле. Hollow Knight имеет превосходство абсолютно в каждом аспекте и контента там больше в три раза, минимум. Spelunky также стоит дешевле, и демонстрирует настоящую процедурную генерацию. Однако, Chasm это приятная игра. Это далеко не лучшая игра в жанре метроидвания и её есть за что критиковать. Но со скидкой, для любителей жанра и олдскула, её можно рекомендовать.",1533184524,1533185212,True,5,0,0.558278381824493408,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Did the first area again on Hard.

1) Hard just seems to drastically lower you lrevel based stat upgrades, absurdly (by 20% stat growth or lower)

2) There's no procedural generation around anything but the room placement between key rooms.  The general location of all primary rooms are identical, so this is far more like Shattered in terms of how generation works.

3) The item chests are in the same exact rooms as they were before.  The mid game side quest chests from the first area are in the exact same rooms.

There doesn't appear to be any real value to the procedural generation.  It is just going to make the game ""slightly different"" between runs.  It's a gimmick on a game that itself isn't really a standout in the genre.

Original:
This is really an unfortunate instance of a game that would have done well to have gone through early access instead of being in the myst for 5 years and then coming out.

There are so many things wrong with the design of the game that have nothing to do with the procedural nature.

The Stat scaling system means most weapons are useles.  There are like 7 swords that are +1 or +2 strength over the previous version, which isn't worth anything.  Most weapons are worse than swords, and you'll have to be lucky to get the exceptions.

100% of the game's spells are purchased, not found.  All upgrades are purchased, not found.  The spell mana cost does not correlate to ease of use or damage potential.

Many of the rooms that are gated behind power ups make exhaustive requirement of the use of those power ups to navigate them.  The navigational abilities are not really fun or enhancing, so this turns into a slog.  That combined with many jumps that require you to perform the jump near optimally to be high enough to reach platforms, and then single square platforms spaced out to jump across to, minor failures lead to having to repeat these horrible ""jump puzzles"".  (This is not to be confused with some people's complaints of the platforming as if the game controls oddly, it controls fine, the only difference is that 

At least in my particular iteration, the game was largely linear with periodic backtracking when receiving new skills.

The ""end game quest"" unlocking of things gave me items that were worse than the items I already had.  This was common throughout the game, but it's really fun as a capstone to get the Infinity Sword when you already have the Infinite Sword +1.

The game is loooong.  It's 9 hours and there's not a lot that happens in the game.  Far too many of the rooms (that I got) were long pieces, leading to large swathes of my play being just extremely long treks.  There is a speed potion that you can get (that I didn't buy any of) that allows you to 

While the art is great (I mean that, really, it is very sharp for pixel style, and the backgrounds and parallax are really good), there is only one music track per area and they're not particularly good, and you'll be hearing them for long periods.

The 7/10 common rating for this game is about on par, but I'm on the fence about this even being a Metroidvania, because of the linearity.  It's superficially similar to SotN but, at least with my seed, it felt more like I was beating stages than I was exploring anything.   7/10 is probably fine, but that's not high enough for a recommendation.

The procedural generation is, at the least, not the same problem that Shattered has, where it adds nothing to the game except load times.  The load times in this game are nearly instant, even the inital game generation, which is more than can be said for games that rely on procedural generation.

I'm curious if the procedural generation actually offers any kind of replay value, that is mixes up the experience enough with enemies or other weapon options or pogressions, or mixes up the order of the power up unlocks, but I'm not so interested in dropping another 9 hours into the game to find out how another run goes.

This game is also steeply priced at $20 because it doesn't really offer anything special, which is such a shame.",1533184494,1533397736,False,21,0,0.612825632095336914,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Chasm is a great metroidvania with combat very reminicent of Castlevania: SotN.  Combat feels good, requiring knowledge of enemy attacks and ranges rather than just letting the player jump in guns blazing.  In addition, there are some neat animation cancels that can be performed when landing aerial attacks that feel super satisfying when pulled off.

The exploration feels good too, secret walls are all over; rewarding a ""check everything"" mentality with health or mana bonuses (rather than any key items), and the variety of items and weapons that can be found feels varied and useful.  

My only criticism right now (which I would expect to get fixed in future patches) is in the more advanced movement options, especially the wall jump.  It just feels clunky to use, resulting in the player falling away from the wall rather than performing a jump most of the time.  It seems like the player just needs to enter the wall-slide animation quicker and that would solve most of the clunkyness.  That's in conjunction with some weird number/balance tweaks (two examples being in damage: a midgame boss had large fist attacks that did just 1 damage to me, but bullet hell projectile attacks that did 22, and pricing: there's a sword that drops from an enemy in the second area that can be sold for 6x the sell price of most items at that point, allowing for some early upgrades and purchases). 

The key takeaway is that the game is great as is, but with a couple minor tweaks which I'd expect to see soon it can be incredible.",1533184154,1533184154,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

To be absolutely clear, while this game shares some superficial similarities to games like Rogue Legacy and Dead Cells, the long-form gameplay is very different and involves actual exploration, backtracking, proper observation and (very light) puzzle solving to advance -- much more akin to a Dark Souls or Metroid game than any roguelike. The reviews on this game definitively prove most Steam reviewers don't have a clue what they're talking about.

As one of the original Kickstarter backers, I can say with confidence that I got precisely the retro-throwback metroidvania I've been waiting for. Great music, a wide variety of weapons and equipment, tons of different enemies, bosses and minibosses and oodles of neat things to find deep in the chasm. Plus you're promised that every playthrough will be different. It's not perfect -- the equipment options could use to be better balanced (hint to dev: nerf magic knives/shuruken, buff melee gear).

Chasm feels like a classic snes game and that's great, it should be a classic, but it's not a inovative masterpiece. Maybe its problem lies on the time it was on development, it took 5 years to be ready, and with this amount of time comes expectations, which weren't fulfilled. 

[b]So let's talk about the good parts of Chasm[/b]

-The art is gorgeous, impecable pixel art work, the places feels lively, and not always with a happy aspect, which is a plus 
-The animation is smooth and controls are really tight
-Music is great, is not a soundtrack I would listen outside of the game, but it manages its purposes perfectly and blends nicely into each environment 
-Puzzles are rare, but fun to do 
-Power ups are not exactly generic, but shares the same aspect of metroidvania basis, it takes some time to grab everything but once you do you will reach anywhere and walk through like a ninja
-The game is fun overall 
-No bugs whatsoever from my end, no crashes and a constant 60fps on an old MacBook Pro 

But unfortunately that's it, I took around 8-9 hours to beat the game, and plan to play it again to beat on other modes and achieve everything, but I feel that the precedural generator isn't needed here, is not exactly short or fast paced with perma-death for it to shine, as it only generates another map once you start a new game. 

But the game doesn't feel long as well and I found it really easy on normal, whereas I was expecting something more challenging and intricate. Yes, we have the Mortal and Hard mode for this, but even with that I feel the game should have a longer learning curve, because if you explore the map and grab everything while leveling up, by the time you reach the last area you don't even need to get close to the creatures 

[b]So basically, my cons for this game are[/b]  

-It should have more content, more bosses, more abilities, more areas and harder puzzles
-The game could've used some more intricate side-quests that could envolve more difficult challenges, like hunting things, bounties, exploring unrelated places to the main plot and so on 
-The colisseum was really easy 
-Secrets never feel really rewarding, you get some hp here, some mana there, but not even the final weapon you get in the game made me swap my Claymore 
-A bit of spoiler, but the last boss [spoiler]has only one form, and it's easy, so c'mon, give me 3 at least and made him escape into the surface so I can fight there for the final battle[/spoiler] 
-No secret final boss, or it is really really secret 
-Backtracking is a moto for metroidvanias and the thing it should be more enjoyable, but here it feels like a chore because the plot backtracking is really long, even with the shortcuts. Normally you would have the streamlined backtrack for plot, and the long haul for secrets, but since the secrets don't feel rewarding backtracking turns a bit on the bitter side
 
I was really looking forward to Chasm, and I had fun playing it, but after finished I couldn't help but to feel like ""wait, that was it?"" 
So it breaks my heart to write this review, as Metroidvanias are my favorite genre and I was really expecting to be blown away. 
But I still recommend it, because it feels like a classic metroidvania that just happens to be late for the party, and while it was getting ready, other games of the genre arrived first and set the bar way too high, and Chasm didn't dressed as fancy as we're waiting, but is still a solid well developed game leaking with love for the genre.

1: Controls are not very fluid.
The game handles much like Castlevania:SOTN, but makes almost no effort to improve on it. Jumping and attacking is by far the most effective way to fight almost anything in the game and the backdash may as well not be in the game with how it functions. Slow to start, can't be used to interrupt an attack, can only be interrupted by jumping. This was updated to be more controllable in later castlevania games such as Dawn of Sorrow, so it feels like a downgrade.

2: Music is dull
Not to say that it isn't good, or that it's particularly bad, one of the defining features of Castlevania games was their catchy music. Most of the tracks would keep you cruising happily even through long walking segments with nothing interesting happening. Since backtracking is apparent in this game, it feels like the music needs to be more motivational and upbeat.

On the positive side of things now, the animation and graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the characters, world, and story are pretty much all they need to be, and set up the game perfectly.",1533177334,1533177334,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

They're not the same.
They're in deed side scroll action but they're not the same from fundamental.
First is controller,there's lag of when you're turning left to right which make you able to attack on another side of where you're heading which is what castlevania is. (which is saying that it's not very responsive to some players)

This make me feel nostalgic toward old castlevania game AKA. Symphony of night and this is high praise because I beleive that this is my favorite castlevania game. There's annoying issues like no checkpoint,you died,you go back to last save which I hate and love at the same time,it make your choice matter.

Sadly,even with all strong points I love there are weak point that I hate as well such as how gear work,some gear such as swimming gear is kinda...like you have it so you can use in 2 places. I think if the creator add more water level like sewer area where we can't dive in at beginning and let us explore and find more treasures after we obtained it would be great and be sure that it's optional for backtracking.... What I am saying is,don't make us go back to the place we had been to get some optional treasures but you should make some quest that make us go around that part so that we should consider go off the path a bit.

Графика: Очень хороша, просто отлично, глаз радуется, а не дергается, как это бывает в подобных играх, есть несколько конечно довольно глупых графических эффектов, как например сгорание поверженных противников, но в целом картины это не портит, так что придираться не станем.

Музыка и звуки: не особо прислушивался, но на паузе мелодия очень приятственная, эдакий ковбойский мотивчик, звуки битв хорошие, без изысков, но ухи не режет.

Боевая система: По сути вы воин, магия тут есть, но мана не регенится просто так, а выбивается из светильников (Где-то заикалась Castlevania) так что все магические предметы я вообще не понял зачем, если весь упор сделан на ближний бой, а нужная магия тут только одна - защитная аура (которая по сути вообще не защитная, а дамажущее кольцо камней, крутящееся вокруг вас и довольно неплохо вваливающее, даже без магических предметов, брать обязательно, ибо перфекты с боссами с ней делать в разы проще.) А вот все оружие ближнего боя делится на классы: 
Мечи (средний урон и дальность, быстрая атака) 
Булава (высокий урон, средняя дальность, медленная атака)
Хлыст\Копье (средний урон, большая дальность, средняя атака)
Кинжалы\Кастеты (очень большой урон, контактный бой, быстрая атака)
Двуручное оружие (большой урон, большая дальность и удар поражает зону с вверх до вперед, очень медленная атака)
Из всего этого стоит выбирать что вам ближе, но я бы крайне рекомендовал именно Копья, ибо дальность и скорость атаки тут самые важные параметры.

Прокачка: По сути ее тут как таковой нет, просто при повышении уровня вам дается определенное количество каких либо характеристик из 4 основных: Сила (Ближний бой) Интеллект (Магия) Концентрация (Не понял на что влияет, но по идее это шанс крита) Удача (Шанс дропа с монстров золота, на предметы, как я проверял, не влияет) И вот оно аппается, вы одеваете предметы с определенными хар-ками и вуаля, все РПГ система на этом замыкается, можно еще прокачивать заклинания за драг. камни. либо поднимать случайную характеристику с помощью свитков. Все в силу и будет с вами победа.

Геймплей: По сути все сводится к такому порядку действий (Привет Omega Strike): вы выходите на зону, бродите по ней пока не найдется какая либо возможность позволяющая пройти дальше (крюки, скольжение по стенам и тд. и тп.) по пути освобождая горожан и открывая телепорты. На счет секретов: в каждой зоне есть один большой секрет (оружие, броня, предметы), он обязательно находится в комнате с сундуком\алтарем и пару мелких (Бутылки + макс ХП и МП), что бы попасть в них вам просто надо прыгнуть на иллюзорную стенку и вы там. Ходите вы значит, бродите так, и вас это постепенно утомляет, ибо на карте дофига мест остается где вы еще не можете пройти и вам все это приходится держать в голове, можно ставить метку на зоне, но подписать ее нельзя, что есть плохо. Зоны затянуты, локации повторяются по прорисовке и тут вы отчетливо начинаете видеть ущербность рандомайзера карты. Вот это, пожалуй и есть основной минус игры, она откровенно затянута и если например в Symphony of the Night или в том же UNepic, игра держит до конца и не отпускает, то тут зоне к 3тьей вы откровенно подзадолбаетесь. И еще один совет: перед каждым основным боссом есть сейв, советую выучить противника и валить его с перфектом, за это вы получаете очень офигенское оружие/броню, на первых двух я о таком не знал, а вот Титана завалил абсолютно случайно и дали просто офигительный Громовой Молот, который пускает волны на пол экрана, что по сути переделало война в мид рейнджа.

И в заключении: Игра стоит того что бы с ней ознакомиться любителям жанра, у нее есть пару минусов, в основном это затянутость локаций, непонятный дроп с мобов и отсутствие как такового сюжета. Но приятная боевка, возможность прокачки и классная графика не должны дать вам скучать первую половину игры уж точно.",1533175560,1533175727,True,5,0,0.551569521427154541,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[list]
    [*]Good difficulty if you set limits on how you play. Otherwise pretty easy.*
    [*]Fun bosses
    [*]Great art/animations
    [*]I encountered no bugs
    [*]Good game to mindlessly play while you watch or listen to other things
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
    [*]No interesting traversal items
    [*]short (7 hours without going speedy and while getting stuck a few times. I did not get 100% completion though.)
    [*]Sluggish feeling controls
    [*]Mediocre room design
    [*]Has level ups for infinite scaling
[/list]

*You can pause the game to eat food to heal. This means that you can pretty much never die if you want because you can just stockpile food and eat it when you're getting low. You never need to learn bosses' attack patterns ect. If you choose to not use the food the game is a pretty good difficulty.

I'm going to recommend it because its good for people who want something new, but there are a few games that I would definitely recommend getting before it if you haven't played those.

I'd put this one squarely in the maybe-yes category if I could, for a couple reasons, but one major one.

The whole 'procedural' fad is pointlessly shoved into so many games, and this is one. It does nothing for this game other than make areas feel kinda disjointing and weird at times precisely because they are procedural rather than being designed with some kind of intention in mind. I'm glad it's not 100% procedurally generated, but it still feels very 'random' in a 'this is put together kinda awkwardly' way rather than a 'this is new and exciting' way. It makes the game worse, not better.

Second, the ""Spells"" would be better described as ""basically copies of the items from castlevania 2/3/4"" which was a big let down. There are a couple that kinda stand out but several are pretty much straight carbon copies, and also your mana are hearts in essence, and refilled via candles in the same fashion. I was excited to maybe see a game of this sort really flesh out a magic-y side, but they really are subweapons by another name and don't add much ultimately.

Other than those two gripes it's pretty okay - I wish I could say it knocked my socks off, but it just lacks depth. Weapons are pretty rigidly scaled with the only real difference being reach and attack speed, nothing stands out otherwise so far and the loss of range for some heavier/faster weapons just isn't worth the risk at all given the amount of damage you take and general lack of readily available healing, so it doesn't really feel like there's a lot of genuine options.

The sound design is pretty good, didn't stand out to me either way, and the music is there though none of the tunes have really struck a chord with me as of yet. Graphics are pretty damn well done as far as pixel art and such goes, so I can give points there at least, even if they made the usual ""it's pixel art kinda but sorta not really"" mistakes/choices that always bother me a bit.

If more time had been put into just hand-designing a huge, sprawling, interstingly-laid out world rather than procedural-ing, and more effort into making spells that are more than subweapons all but copied from the Castlevania series, and the weapons had more variety to them besides a single attack that varies only in reach/damage/speed, this game would really stand out.. but I fear it just don't.",1533171157,1533171157,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game for sure is trying to be Symphony of the night, the physics are nearly the same, animations are nearly identical, the only thing thats missing is choking enemies death as poisonous gas cloud. While movement feels great it's everything else that becomes a problem. The modular, algorithmic construction of the game lends itself to nothing more than corridor after corridor of the same enemies. Where SotN would have interesting locales, enemies, and items to find in nearly every nook and cranny. Instead, Chasm just has the same corridors for each area with maybe 4 unique enemies and a somewhat better weapon to use. The construction of the map also lends itself to such boring and disjointed backtracking. The upgrades are also incredibley boring with ledge grab, slide, probably a double jump later on. Combat suffers from the same monotony that plagues everything else. You walk up to an enemy, get a hit or two in, back off, let them attack, repeat.

I can't give this a positive recomendation, it's too mundane and boring to be worth the price.

Attack animations: Yes, a few of the enemies in the first room do not have one. HOWEVER, these opponents are mean to be easy to beat, and fit the bill. Later, as you go deeper down, this changes, and only a few, small enemies behave this way, most will start actively trying to kill you once you reach the second area.

Platforming: I'll give them this one, it is a little hard to master the movement controls, and the platforms themselves feel a little off, i.e, the edge isn't quite where you might be expecting the first time around, but it is something you can get used to over time.

Is Hollow Knight better?: Well... yeah, but that can be said of most metrovanians if you ask me. What this game has going for it is that it is different. Hollow Knight has much more emphasis on reflex, speed, and skill. Chasm is more about timing, strategy, and evaluation, that is to say, the solution to beating each enemy isn't obvious all the time. You'll have to think your way out of a few. It also has a level system, which though not necessarily a better way of doing things, is a nice change of space.

Is it worth $20: Honestly, I'd value it closer to $12-$15. I might wait for it to go on sale before buying it, but if you can get a deal on the game, yeah go for it.

Lastly, I have to commend them on their weapon and spell system. Each type functions in a different way from all the others. This allows you to have a very specialized and unique play style, custom to your preference or the environment. It kind of throws in an extra element of strategy, which I enjoy.

The combat itself is more technical than most players might be used to. That is, you're less dependent on existing game mechanics like an invincible dodge, and more dependent on your own skill / ability to get out of the way of attacks. The different weapons have their advantages and disadvantages, which I like. I find it interesting that I'm actually considering what weapon I'm going to take down a specific monster with.

Recommendation: SotN fans, check it out

The reviews for this game are baffling. It's almost as if people are expecting it to be a game it's not. Perhaps that's because so many other metroidvania games have come out in recent years, warping people's expectations a bit.

If you played and loved Symphony of the Night, this should be right up your alley since the movement and combat have the same weightiness to them here as they did there (including the need to time your swings for maximum effectiveness, and the little double-slash you can do with swords if you jump-hit at first).

The graphics are very well-done, the music is very charming, the leveling-up is handled the exact same way as SotN as well (no picking stats, you just get stronger each level up), and there is a large variety of weapons available: Classic swords with a medium-range, medium speed slash; daggers with a quick, short slash; spears with a long-range, medium-speed poke, greatswords and hammers with a slow, powerful overhead smash; whips with a medium-speed, long-range forward slash, etc.

Magic as well has a decent variety, although they aren't all very useful. The knife ended up being my favorite, since it's low-cost and allows me to kill enemies at a distance if I can tell they will get in the way of some future platforming, plus it becomes rather insanely powerful when upgraded.

Speaking of the platforming, the controls are incredibly precise, and I felt immediately at home coming from SotN. There were a few moments after I unlocked the wall-slide where I accidentally jumped off of a wall I wanted to do a ledge-grab on, but if I had just been patient and waited for my character to slide down a bit and grab the ledge on his own, I would have been fine. Other than that, though, I had absolutely no issues getting my character to do what I wanted.

The combat as well is very precise. If you flail around, mashing buttons as fast as you can, you will miss the timings and most likely die. If you slow down a bit and time things out, however, combat is rather fast and responsive. The bosses are tough but fair (memorizing patterns, as always, is the key to success), and you're always given warning and a save point right before the fights as well, which is nice. There's great enemy variety, too, with 87 total enemies to fight (that includes the 6 bosses and just a few re-skinned enemies), each of which has its own attack patterns, telegraphs, and loot drops. I do wish that the back-slide thing didn't have a delay at the end where you can't do anything for a second afterwards, though. I honestly just never ended up using it.

All in all, this game is a great homage to Symphony of the Night. Combat is responsive, platforming is tight, the magic is familiar, the music fits incredibly well, the graphics are perfect, and there's upgrades, crafting, and quests. If you're expecting it to be like Dead Cells or Hollow Knight, then you will probably be disappointed (did you people even TRY the demo?). If, however, you're expecting something more closely-related to the classic ""vania"" in Metroidvania, then you should find more than a few things in Chasm to enjoy.

At the point of writing this I am sitting at 40% game completion rating, so it may well be that some aspects of the following write-up may change later on.

What is Chasm?
Chasm is a procedurally-generated metroidvania title. It tries to emulate a lot of the mechanics and overall gameplay found in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night; this holds especially true for the amount of weapons that can be both bought or obtained as random drops off certain enemies as well as spells and equipment. 

+ Great art
+ Lovely soundtrack
+ Light RPG mechanics with attributes, many different weapons, equipment & spells
+ A sense of progression in the town, as you gradually unlock access to more NPCs and their services as you rescue them from the dungeon

- Clunky & slow combat (Why can you diagonally attack downwards mid-air, but not in other directions? Why can you only attack straight ahead when standing or kneeling?)
- Exceedingly long ""recovery frames"" on nearly every animation make your character feel unresponsive and sluggish
- Enemy design is uninspired and their difficulty tends to gravitate towards the extremes of 'easily avoidable and never a threat' to 'frustratingly designed'.
- Procedural generation leads to a pile of dungeon room layouts thrown around haplessly; exploration is made somewhat less interesting by this, as you will never discover interestingly designed places (since those would need to be hand-placed and connected to the story), but instead are going through randomly assigned rooms with treasure chests here and there.
- The metroidvania aspect in this game seems to be solely focused on obtaining an item and backtracking to a previously inaccessible area in an extremely linear fashion. Typically (at least in most metroidvanias I have played previously) there is some form of non-linearity, where you can explore multiple areas and even sequence-break the intended progression route. I don't know if this was due to the dungeon layout the game generated for me or what, but Chasm has been absolutely linear so far. I had to progress through area A to be able to get the item to access area B, where I had to get another item to be able to access area C.

I am left confused as to why Chasm's ""Mortal Mode"" (permadeath) is locked behind beating the game. For how big the emphasis on procedural content is in this game, I feel as if Mortal Mode should've been the way Chasm was meant to be experienced in the first place: exploring a completely re-shuffled dungeon when you inevitably die! As it stands, having to beat the game (and therefore see all the bosses and weapon/gear/spells) before you get to experience the game mode in which the procedural generation really comes into play just seems silly to me.

Situations like this is where I wish there was a ""neutral/mixed"" option on Steam's ""review"" system. Chasm is not a terrible game; but the clunky combat, the unresponsive-feeling character controls and the odd implementation of their procedural generation made my time with it not nearly as fun as I had hoped it would be.",1533151255,1533151255,False,3,0,0.52575218677520752,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I am very picky about video games but the first time I played Chasm I had to force myself to stop after playing 4 hours (which is a lot for me). To me it plays like a retro (in a good way) but with modern additions, cool original features and obviously amazing art direction! I feel like there was a lot of thought and time spent on nice little details in the environment, etc. I like the music and sound.

As far as combat I like that you can’t just mindlessly run, slash and button mash - you have to be more strategic with battle. The only thing I would say is maybe it takes a few milliseconds to long after an attack to move, jump, dash, etc but that is how I remember a lot of other great retro games from the past.

Melee action platformers are without a doubt my favorite type of game. From Symphony of the Night to Hollow Knight, I play all of them that I can get my hands on. I absolutely adore these games. You're free to consider me a little biased here.

Chasm has a retro combat feel, like the early Castlevania games with uninterruptable animations, and enemies that can hurt you just by bumping into you. You need to be more careful and precise with your attacks, especially when you use slow attack speed weapons on higher difficulty levels. This is a big difference if you're used to games like Dead Cells with very fluid and fast combat systems (which I also love) but I appreciate the variety and additional difficulty.

While you'll spend a decent chunk of your time swinging your weapons around, the focus is more on exploration for key items to unlock access to new areas. There are a lot of rooms that present a puzzle or challenge to find your way to a treasure chest that might contain new gear or upgrade items. You'll haul the upgrade items back up to town to create new potions, weapons, or higher spell levels.

Graphics and audio are excellent, and the controls are solid. I think some of the enemies in the early game are too simple with their limited patrol patterns, but they do improve quite a bit a little way into the game.

I own the game on two platforms now, and I'm happy with the money I spent on it. If you're into these sort of games like I am, Chasm is easy for me to recommend to you.",1533147785,1533147785,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The combat is slow, monotonous (you will be doing the same strat over and over). 
Its random map is something you will prob see once since you won't want to play another run after the first one that takes 10 hours (prob lower on normal or easy), which makes me question why even have a randomly generated map, you will see the same tileset throught diffrent levels where the only change is color and enemies according to the zone, so this feature is only for the hardcore metroidvania fans,
The pixel art might be pretty nice but the animation (frames per animation, per entity) was kinda lackluster aspecialy when you will see your character doing the same attack over and over.
Gear is most of the time just a number increase with maybe a flashier looking sprite when you swing.

I tried to refund after 5h of playing, but that didn't go through, even though I effectivly played like 2 hours since a lot of the time is spent going from A to B and if you die along the way, well back to A you go, and a lot of times you are going to have a platforming section thrown in there which really made me not enjoy this game. During platforming you needed to do precise jumps off the edges of platforms, which is infuriating when I swear that should have been enough.

The game just doesn't feel polished, combat is boring, movement is super boring, the looks are bland, story? It had one I guess.

+ The pixel art is incredible
+ Big variety of well designed enemies

+/- The movement/combat are ok, but nothing exceptional. I wish the movement was a little faster

- Death is very punishing. Imo the game lacks savepoints
- Extremely slow to move around in the world, and you have to backtrack A LOT, which makes it frustrating to play
- The puzzles are poorly explained, if at all.. And you have to complete them in order to continue the game
- The boss fights are slow and boring.. You can just nuke most of them
- I feel the game should lead the player a bit more. You never really have an objective. Most of the important items you need to continue are located in random rooms or you get them after an event has occured
- The random generation doesn't even seem to have that big of an effect to the game
- The levels quickly become repetitive 
- The walljump is hard to use, and it messes up the ledge hangs
- Some annoying platforming rooms
- Most of the useful consumable (teleport scrolls for example) items are too hard to come by

Some times it is redeculas stupid hard to kill an bat becasue it is out of your hit range, it is flying a bit to high, when jumping it is to low, then jopping higher and wait to attak works sometimes but for the most part the bat hits you.
In general it is hard to duge attakts after you attakt. So like you attak and want to jump away because of counter attak, but it taks 1 second before you can do anything again after your attak, so when you finaly jump you got allready hit.

You lvl up by killing enemie but because it is so anoying to kill them, because of hard do doge and very very rarly save places aka get full health, I try to skip most of the enimes.. this is a bad loop.
And when you got trough a part of the cave, and thinking yeah nice, know I need a save place, so I hope I found a new one or play save and go back to where you know one is, all enemies respawned and getting back without dieing is a fricking pain in the ass.
It need more healing option or not respawn of enemies... it is unbalinced right know.

The fight is just not fun, and thats sad because it should be in this kind of game.

Also really anoying is, when you day, the game say ""GAME OVER"" and you a back at the main menu, why? Why don't respawn me directly, now I need to select my gameslot and conform to load it, time wasted on not playing..

I am preatty sure this will get better with the time, it is not the first time I bught an indigame just at releas and it was okay but not great, after some weeks they fixed alot of bugs and inproved the things player complaint about. 

So yeah you can buy it now and play, but the controll is not easy, wait 2 or 4 weeks (after realeas) and it proberbly got way better.",1533140780,1533143403,False,4,0,0.426253944635391235,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I didn't back Chasm but I have been excited about it since I came across it a few years ago, and has unfortunately become one of my biggest disappointments. 

Chasm's biggest problems: 
-Save points: The game's save points are so far and few between that the majority of the game you will spend back tracking or putting yourself at risk of losing 15-20 minutes of progress.  This could be due to the procedurally generated layouts, but so far every area has at most one save point, and dozens of rooms that branch far, far away from those save points. Get to the end of a branch and save a villager? You better head back to that save point and hope you don't die or you'll be doing it al again. Beat a boss and progress forward only to find there isn't a save point nearby? You bet you'll be fighting that boss again.  

-Combat: Unfortunately, the combat in Chasm is not very fun. There are a few types of enemy behaviors: ones that will path and pay you absolutely no mind but damage you if you touch them, ones that will walk towards you and attack then pause, and ones that will throw, shoot stuff at you.  The biggest problem with the combat comes from the lack of responsiveness from your character when you really want it. There are definitely times where animation cancelling would be welcomed, but it never comes. 

-Unispired map designs: This one is no surprise since the worlds are procedural, while the rooms themselves are hand crafted. Theres almost never anything interesting to find in the connecting rooms, other than enemies and lamps evenly spaced out. Get used to the bland maps cause you'll be trekking back and forth through them constantly. 

-Pacing of character upgrades: I spent the first two hours of Chasm having found only one new weapon, a club. The club wasn't even necessarily better, it hit harder by a couple of points but was dog slow.  While some metroidvania games will feed you upgrades on a perfect cadence, this is a prime example of being drip fed. 

Overall, Chasm has a lot of problems, and a lot of things that just end up being ""meh"". The entire game feels like a bland and unispired idea of a metroidvania game, without taking the time to implement any of the systems that make these games fun. I hate that I have to not recommend this game.",1533135829,1533135829,False,28,0,0.589121639728546143,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Eh, its not that bad. Mainly the issues that come from this game are how exactly finicky the jump controls are and how mediocre the controls feels over. After playing a week solid of Mega Man X and Hollow Knight and jumping into the mess that is Chasm? There's just no comparison. Even Hollow Knight, a game based around a Dark Souls-ian level of despair and doom manages to evoke more life and power from its game feel and controls. Mega Man X, a game that's 25 years old, plays and feels overall better. Now I know that's almost an apples and oranges sort of argument but in the end I feel that ""good game feel"" is a universal concept and for ME, Chasm just misses the mark JUST enough that I can't recommend the game to anyone in this state.

Dead Cells and Hollow Knight have officially eaten its lunch with their superior mechanical and game feel fidelity.

A decently good, if short Metroidvania that potentially offers more replay value but lacks some polish in areas. If you like this genre and don't mind ignoring some blemishes you could definitely do worse.

[h1]The Long Version[/h1]
Do not go into Chasm expecting a modern day Symphony of the Night or even anything close to the quality of modern Metroidvania classics like Axion Verge or Hollow Knight. Chasm is definitely not playing in the big leagues with those titles. Overall Chasm is still a fine game with some quality presentation and the procedurally generated aspect of it's dungeons that give the game some additional replay. 

This replay value may be hindered though by the fact that it's not an exceptionally long game, nor terribly hard to accomplish everything in your first playthrough. In just over 7 hours I 100%'ed the game and began playing on Hard mode but found it to be a less than pleasurable experience. 

Production value is well done on both visual and audio fronts but likely won't be something anyone remembers years from now. The music runs on a constant loop for each area and given how backtrack heavy Chasm is the tunes make begin to wear on the player's patience.

The biggest negative to the game is the sluggish controls; especially in combat. In particular the backward dash button might as well be unbound for how worthless it is in the current version since it cannot animation cancel from an attack but jumping away can on most weapons. Weapon and spell balance leaves a bit to be desired as well with most spells costing more they further down the purchase list they are with no really good reason. For instance the Magic Shield spell (which is actually a defense field of whirling diamonds) costs 10 mana to cast and mana does not regenerate naturally.  Meanwhile a lv3 upgraded Magic Knife spell throws a spread of daggers across the screen for 1 mana and is hands down the best spell in the game for all occasions.

[h1]The Final Verdict[/h1]
Chasm is worth your time if you enjoy the Metroidvania genre and need a fix. Just go in with realistic expectations and you should be solid.

[h1] 게임 특징 [/h1]
전반적인 그래픽과 기본 연출은 아주 깔끔한 편에 속합니다. 주인공이 어떤 이유로 마을에 찾아왔고 싸우게 되는지의 이야기도 분위기 있게 잘 그려졌습니다. 그래서인지 작품 초반을 진행하는데 있어 흡입력은 상당히 좋은 편입니다. 여기에다 음악까지 좋았으면 완벽한 첫인상! 이라 생각했지만, 아쉽게도 인상 깊이 남았던 음악은 없었네요. 

이 작품이 유저 호불호를 크게 받을 수 있는 곳이 있다면 바로 인게임 전투에 있다고 생각합니다. 요즘 액션 어드벤처 게임들이 속도감을 대단히 중요시 하고 있는 반면 Chasm 에서는 그런 모습을 볼 수 있는 점이 거의 없었기 때문입니다. (변화가 적고 느린 진행이다) 성장 부문에서부터 짚어보죠. Chasm 에는 캐릭터 레벨과 스테이터스가 존재합니다. 레벨업을 하면 그에 걸맞는 장비를 장착할 수 있거나 혹은 스킬, 콤보를 배울 수 있을 것이라는게 일반유저가 가지고 있는 기대심리가 되기도 하죠. 하지만 Chasm 에서는 게임 엔딩 볼 때까지 별도의 콤보나 고유스킬이 일체 등장하지 않습니다. 어떤 무기를 착용하냐에 따라 공격 모션이 달라지긴 합니다만, 레벨업을 해도 / 다른 장비를 붙여도 보이는 성장이 '수치' 이상의 것이 없습니다. 그러다보니 다른 게임에 비해 노가다 하는 재미가 떨어지는 편입니다. 

다음은 난이도 부문. 캐릭터가 한번 죽으면 바로 게임오버인 작품인데 자동저장 기능이 존재하지 않습니다. 그렇다고 세이브 포인트가 그리 많이 있지도 않은 편입니다. 게임 후반에 이르게 되면 필드 어디에도 세이브 할 수 있는 곳이 없어 포탈 타고 마을로 왔다갔다 하지 않으면 안됩니다. 돈 수급률도 꽤 낮기에 어지간한 노가다 플레이가 없는 이상 아이템 사용도 신중을 기해야 합니다. 몬스터 하나하나의 공격도 강력해서 조금만 방심해도 체력은 바닥을 기기 쉽죠. 꽤나 코어한 난이도 덕분에 게임 끝까지 긴장을 놓을 수 없는 점은 있다고 생각합니다. 이로 인한 단점은 오히려 액션 부문에 있었다고 보고 있습니다. 살아남기 위한 컨트롤을 우선해야 되다보니 가뜩이나 기술도 적은 이 게임에서 효율을 찾기 마련이거든요. (회피 동작은 전혀 쓸데가 없다던가..) 정신차리면 점프 공격과 단검던지기 이외엔 아무것도 안하는 자신을 보게 됩니다. 뒤로 가면 갈수록 단조로운 전투로 진행되기 쉬운 점이 유저의 집중력을 떨어지게 만들 수 있습니다.

마지막으로 편의성 부문. 게임 내 퍼즐을 풀기 위해 이미 방문한 지역을 몇번이고 왔다갔다 해야 되는 경우가 상당히 많이 발생하는 등 이쪽 서비스는 좋지 않습니다. 세이브 포인트가 적은 만큼, 장거리를 오가기 위한 이동 포탈의 숫자가 적다 보니 어찌보면 필연적인 문제기도 합니다만.. 퍼즐을 풀기 위한 대부분의 가이드가 문자로 안내되고 있다는 점이 가장 큰 문제로 보고 있습니다. 영어를 잘 모르는 유저들의 경우 그저 안가봤던 지역을 일일히 다 순회해보는 것 이외엔 방법이 없으니까요.


[h1]게임 평가[/h1]
이제 Chasm 에 대한 제 개인적인 평가를 말해보겠습니다. 저는 꽤 재밌게 즐긴 작품입니다. 전반적인 게임 분위기 자체는 나쁘지 않고, 단조롭긴 해도 게임 기본 난이도가 높은 편이라 컨트롤 하는 맛도 있습니다. 하지만 현 단계에서 유저 추천의 문제로 말하자면 저는 비추천을 외치지 않을까 싶습니다.

저는 이 작품이 가지고 있는 가장 큰 장점은 분위기와 스토리로 보고 있습니다. 유저가 게임을 재밌게 즐기기 위한 요소 중 하나는 목적의식을 유지하고 있는 것인데, 이를 위한 가이드 중 하나는 스토리를 보는 것이 됩니다. 이해를 하고 퍼즐을 푸느냐, 그냥 헤딩하다보니 풀어졌냐에 따라 느끼는 재미가 다르듯 말이죠. Chasm 에는 적지 않은 스토리와 텍스트 가이드가 많았던 만큼 스토리 이해 차이에 따른 유저평가가 꽤 갈릴 수 있을 거라 생각되었습니다.

영어를 모르는 유저는 말 그대로 전투만 보고 판단해야 되고, 그런 시점에서 봤을때는 이 작품이 가진 단점은 결코 적지 않아 보였으니까요. 개인적으로 한글패치 되면 좋겠다라고 생각한 작품이었습니다. 그냥 단점 평하고 끝내기엔 조금 아까운 게임이라는 생각이 드네요.",1533123236,1533123236,True,6,1,0.607625126838684082,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Short lived game. Lack of save points discourages extended exploring. Furthermore, potions are difficult to come by because they are tied to gold which is difficult to obtain.

Uninteresting enemy designs, and some enemies are frustrating to fight i.e. Skeleton Knights in tight corridors. It keeps blocking and its difficult to get a hit on them.

Soundtrack and story are passable. 

Certain spots which should have a save room nearby do not have them (see below.)

The good:

Getting a equipment item from a enemy was exciting, the art is fantastic and the controls are responsive and tight.

Improvements that can be made:

Boss rush mode, increases replay-ability.

Place a safe spot just before the Final Boss and Arena.

Have a artifact which gives super-speed instead of the potion.

什么是Metroidvania，简单地说，它就是由Metroid（银河战士）和Vania(恶魔城)组成而来，包含两种类似风格的游戏类型，也被称为类银河战士恶魔城类型。这类游戏的剧情发展往往不受限制，属非线性流程，拥有非常大的游戏场景，每个场景一定程度上相互关联衔接，玩家只有通过不断探索，获得新的能力后才能继续扩展之前不能通过的区域，从而进一步探索。像是硬核类家喻户晓的Hollow Knight(空洞骑士)，还有人见人爱的Shantae and the Pirate's Curse（桑塔海盗的诅咒），Shantae: Half-Genie Hero（桑塔半精灵英雄），Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight(莫莫多拉:月光下的遐想)等等，随着游戏的不断更新，诸如此类题材的游戏也是愈来愈多，因此除了好不好玩以外，有没有新颖的特色显得更为重要。

[h1] [u] GAMEPLAY	[/u]	[/h1]

Chasm(深坑)于2013年众筹成功，终于在2018年发售，包含PS4和steam两个平台，那么在经历了5年开发后游戏质量到底如何呢，让我们一起拭目以待吧。游戏一开始就直奔主题，玩家接受指挥官的任务，前往西方的Karthas进行探索，从镇长身上得知镇上的人都被出现的怪物带走不知去向了。玩家要做的就是去地底探索，救出镇上的村民，消灭聚集在地底各处可怕的怪物们。另外从最开始新游戏时候的SEED能够想到所谓的地牢随机性是指在通关后再次游玩时，地图分布才会随机改变（或许会更大或更小），这样一来会多一些新鲜感，同时也避免了背板带来的熟悉感，有点像带存档点的的Dead Cells(死亡细胞)。

[h1] [u] PROS AND CONS	[/u]	[/h1]

[h1] +优秀的像素表现	[/h1]
画面风格是大家熟悉的像素风，无论是夕阳下的城堡，飘落着雪花的村庄，寂静无比的矿洞，还是压抑不安的地下墓穴，郁郁葱葱的花园等，其各自有着鲜明的特色，树枝摇摆，烛光摇曳，河水流动，甚至是人物呼吸等效果更使得游戏彰显活力，给玩家带来沉浸式的游戏体验。

[h1] +人物的成长系统	[/h1]
人物有等级设定，但是不能进行属性调整，其能力值都是随着等级提升而自动改变的。想要进一步提高实力就得靠装备系统，装备可以在商店购买，也可以通过消灭怪物来获取（一定概率），因为不同怪物掉落的道具不一样（有种玩冒险岛的感觉），加上怪物种类较多（70多种），游戏中还加入了图鉴收藏功能，作为有收藏癖的强迫症玩家来说感到很满足。图鉴里对于怪物的描述也十分详细，有怪兽的实体图，基本介绍（血量/等级/经验），掉落物品，甚至连被击杀数量也有记录，真可谓是一本百科全书。不同的装备武器能带来不一样属性的提升（HP-血量/MP-法力值/力量-物理/智力-魔法/防御-抵抗/幸运-运气），不同的武器根据其特性，攻击方式，速度，范围也有不同，因此在战斗过程中应该适当地根据敌人的攻击特性来调整自己的武器类型。

[h1] +流畅的操作手感	[/h1]
对于横板平台操作类游戏来说，手感的好坏很大程度上影响游戏品质。在Chasm里，无论是跳跃，攻击，翻滚，甚至是爬墙，爬梯子等动作都十分流畅到位，丝毫不拖泥带水，特别是游戏中类似于跳跳乐平台的场景有很多，要是人物有着脚打滑一般的惯性存在的话，那么将会是一场噩梦。人物攻击也是存在硬直的，所以想要得到更好的操作手感，也离不开一定的技巧，比如连续跳跃攻击通过滞空来缩短硬直时间，或者借用跳跃攻击落地瞬间后的攻击重置，能更快速地追加额外攻击等。总之，该作能玩出跑酷般的体验也是很有可能。

[h1] +难度很亲民	[/h1]
游戏一开始可以进行难度的选择（不再是固定默认难度），接着每一次BOSS战前都会有很明显的标识提醒玩家，更有存档点方便玩家保存进度（避免死亡以后大量的跑路造成时间的浪费）。说到存档点这个问题，有人谈到游戏死亡后只能从存档处复活，不能捡尸，要是忘记保存的话，每一次死亡后还得丢失保存前的进度，挫败感极强。其实这不能怪游戏，首先游戏自带多处存档位置，且每一次存档都可以回复血量，其次，通过击杀怪物获取足够多的经验，升级以后也是自动回复满血量。实在要怪就怪自己的技术不到位，因为游戏难度相比起其他同类游戏而言已经非常低了。

[h1] +自主经营模式	[/h1]
这算是游戏另一个特色吧，起初镇上没有多少人，通过不断的地牢探索，解救越来越多的人后，才会依次解锁诸如铁匠，魔法，厨师，赌徒等人物的功能，不过有趣的是玩家光解锁了铁匠还不够，还得找到丢失的铁锤才能解锁武器的创造功能，光解锁了配方师没用，还得去获取配方才能进行药物的研发等。随着人物解锁得越多，镇上的人也越来越多，原先封闭的房间也会相应开启。也就是说，人是玩家解锁的，资源是玩家找到，钱也是玩家花的，所有的一切都是需要玩家付出才能得到的，有种玩模拟经营的味道。

[h1] -单调的地图探索	[/h1]
尽管和其他同类游戏一样，通过探索有限制的地牢，发现获取新的能力，回头探索之前不能通过的区域从而进一步推动流程发展。但是由于游戏的音乐不怎么出彩，加上探索内容很少（无非就是每个区域通过发现跳跳乐房间完成跳跃挑战开启各种宝箱而已），加之游戏地图比较大，且没有单独小地图显示，每一次翻阅还需到设置菜单中进行查看，略显麻烦，时间长了，整个探索过程有点单调，没有太大的趣味性。不过也不是完全没有，比如地下墓穴大门前的解谜，不留点心的话，还真的不容易破解呢。

[h1] [u] SUMMARY	[/u]	[/h1]
作为一款开放的地牢探险游戏来说，它并不是如玩家说的那样不好玩，只要耐心下来还是能感觉到游戏的趣味，起码操作打击手感，音效很到位，BOSS战斗也十分有特色。游戏中创新的东西很少，玩法上也没有太多亮点，过长的开发时间最终换来的游戏质量给玩家一种也不过如此而已的感受。纯粹当作为一款怀旧类怀旧银河战士恶魔城来玩或许会更好，推荐打折后入手。

The combat is clunky and poorly thought out. Platforming ranges from annoying to frustrating. Exploration is monotonous and tedious due to most hallways being enemy tubes that take you to either another enemy tube or one of the few rooms with verticality. Save points and shortcuts are about as common as boss fights, and if you end up low on health after 30 minutes of exploration without a potion, you better hope you don't die backtracking or kill mobs until you level up or they drop food.  The story is not particularly noteworthy and feels like it was added because video games should have a story.

As I played through the game, I often was telling myself that this game can be so much more.

The gameplay can be clunky and I believe that's being held back by its progression system that by the time you finally reach the end of the game, your character has developed enough to improve upon the gameplay slightly.

Pro's:
- Game rich story keeps the game world together pretty well.
- The music is beautiful.
- The Game has beautiful pixel art in the environment, each zone is unique in some way.
- Chasm combat is divided into 2  main branches, Melee Weapons which will require different use and gameplay.
    And of course, Magic - which works like it did in Castlevania - you gain mana by collecting mana orbs and cast spells 
    based on your mana pool.

Con's:

- Game art as much as it is beautiful in environment, it seems to me like enemies were not matched up to par with the environment quality.
- Game Story is not gameplay though, Game platforming consists of nearly Pixel-perfect precision required to jump across platforms.
- Combat mechanic is recycled through mobs - Mainly it will consist of 3 steps ( Baiting Attack -> Dodging -> Attacking while enemy recharges).
- Alot of skills are counter intuitive, and you will find yourself struggling
- Even though there is leveling system, you posses no power of actually adjusting your build.
- The Game advertises for Metroidvania, however it does not seem like pure one, if anything this is more Rogue-Like.
- Big Nono for this kind of game is that sometimes if you wish to progress with tasks you might find yourself Farming mobs (For example for one quest, [spoiler] for vension or in general for mobs to level up [/spoiler])
- The game lenght isn't anything special, it requires alot of backtracking which extends the gameplay.
- In Lategame once you upgrade your spells you will find yourself suddenly switch to the magic oriented spells, as each enemies dont posses different gimmicks to themselves, [spoiler]you  will most likely use highly upgraded knife throw which still costs 1 mana and does as much damage if not more than your highest melee weapon - but at safe distance[/spoiler]).


In short; I Feel like the game isn't what it was hyped to be, if the game play was done well it would be a great game to enjoy, however there is alot of balancing issues and recycling which is blatantly obvious.

我本身是不推荐买这个游戏的，这个价位去买个 盐和避难所
比这好玩的多。

先不说好不好玩，反正自己买的游戏哭着也要把它玩完。
这算是攻略吧：

前期第二大关的 “回旋镖骷髅” 会有一定几率爆出 “骨鞭”
这是非常好用的武器！我一直用到通关，虽然后期地图伤害显得低了，
但是比大剑长枪直剑不知道好用到哪去了。

装备都留着，尤其是戒指类，可以配出物理系和法术系以面对不同情况。

第二大关的密码是拉杆下面地图中特殊房间的壁画。

五颜六色的宝石都留着，用来升级技能，技能可以在红衣老婆婆那买到。
法术建议买飞镖，后期买会围着你转的那玩意，或者是飞斧。升满！！！

宝箱里开出的像纸样的东西是药水配方，拿到后和药水NPC对话就能解锁新药。

前期买个锁子甲，然后攒钱买个铁匠卖的倒数第二的那个胸甲，后期换金甲。
金甲需要锻造，锻造需要锤子。

平台跳跃非常蛋疼，不要灰心，多试一试吧！

有两种特殊帽子，一个可以召唤出鸟一个是剑，它们可以升级，怪物被随从
击杀才能获得经验值。

后面会获得一个黑色羽毛，是放在第二关的祭坛上的。

城堡关卡的钟的提示可以在图书馆最上方获得。顺序就是从左到右跟
钟的声音大小无关。（别问我怎么怎么知道的）

打完城堡关卡BOSS后可以获得一个火山岩戒指，然后回到森林遗迹关卡，
有个很多牙齿的门需要这个打开。在这之前有段剧情。

潜水能力在城堡关卡的角斗场处。 角斗场第一次简单，第二次伤害就上去了
后面建议用飞镖躲在角落输出（升满装备加法术攻击的装备）。
最后一次是老板亲自出马，用飞镖可以莽过去。
奖励是：战神头盔  战神胸甲  战神直剑  潜水能力

一共有有六大关卡，后面两个关卡建议用飞镖biubiu过去，因为没有存档点！！！
我的法术攻击最高是31，飞镖全中有93的伤害，比你用手撸不知道好到哪里去。

膜法遗迹（紫呼呼有许多电的关卡），需要关闭三个电源后可以通过有三个电
的门，里面有个会飞的boss，多备些药，因为boss的攻击真的很难躲，
我用飞镖biubiu过去的。

打死boss后获得一个黑色宝石？用来打开通往最后一关的门，门也在森林遗迹。
（你应该知道）

最后一个只有一个存档点，没有传送门，把你的钱全部买药大概7个红瓶，3个蓝瓶
就行，用会绕着你转的法术可以对BOSS有效输出，血量低于100就回血，不然可能会挂掉。

解锁狗狗在旅馆内获得的金蛋（光石）是城堡关被铁栅栏关的宝箱的钥匙之一，
然后在药水商人那买珍视明，75块钱的绿瓶药水，然后第二大关地图是有个小点的地方就是
隐藏宝箱的位置那儿有第二枚光石，里面有个还可以的剑。

The art is wonderful, I enjoy the areas and the design and I keep coming back to the game because I'll be damned if I don't beat it after all the frustration! I've reached the final area and have my thoughts/opinions pretty well collected.

This game _will_ punish you if you're not precise. Combine that with almost-but-not-quite platforming mechanics and you have a pretty frustrating experience. But when it's fun, it's _fun_. I've really enjoyed myself playing this game. It's posed a good challenge, even though sometimes it feels like I just got lucky enough to hit certain platforms, thanking God I don't have to unlock that chest again.

So on to specifics:

- Art: killer job. Love love love this.

- Music: Also good, no complaints here.

- Weapons: the range of attack on most weapons is way to short for my preference. Most of them (swords and clubs) are also only directly in front of you, so when attacking arial enemies, you often have to put yourself in range to get hit (which is really frustrating). Whips ended up being my favorite weapon because the hit box is slightly above your head and extends really far in front of you, often outside of the hit range of most enemies. The claymore is similar, but way too slow. Weapons are either powerful with short range or slow. Whips have great range and hits-per-second but are underpowered.

- Movement: Late-game platforming abilities need some tweaking. The wall-climb mechanic and parachute feel very rough. Many of my frustrations surround these two. Honestly, I would be super happy if they were removed from the game in their current state. You have to be super intentional about hitting the A button, otherwise you'll jump off a ledge when you don't intend to. I Also would have loved the double jump much earlier in the game. You don't get it until the 5th of 6 areas.

- Magic: Early game I tried a bunch of them and they were all pretty disappointing, except for the Magic Shield. It's _very_ handy and melts tougher enemies when buffed correctly. The Shuriken is thrown at an angle that feels useless (up and to the right at a 55 degree angle or something). The ax is literally thrown and hard to use against enemies that move (which is nearly all of them late game). The Boomerang is ""ok."" The Shield is great when powered up to level 3. It does great damage if you have the proper armor (25 for me at the moment).

- Health: I won't complain about this too much because that's part of the challenge of the game, but you definitely have to manage your health well. Horde those coins to purchase potions and pray enemies drop health items so you don't have to run across the map every so often to save and recharge your health.

- Map traversal: This is really annoying. Things are pretty far apart and it can be a pain to traverse the map to get where you need to go. Part of the problem is combat and having to be really precise and making sure you don't get hit. It gets _much_ easier when you've leveled up quite a bit and going back to areas meant for when you were lower level because you can one-hit most everything, but when you're exploring a new area and everything still takes 3-5 (or more hits) to take down and they hit just as hard, it makes getting through 4+ rooms quite challenging.

- Movement: I really wish the back dash was more usable, but the halt after swinging a weapon can be too long to get in and do what you need to do.

Developers: if you're reading this, you really have done a great job. I'm a Kickstarer backer and really believe in the project. I hope you hear this and find things you can tweak because I _super_ want to keep playing this game. The diversity of enemy types, maps, bosses, etc, have been great. There are just some annoyances that can be improved. Thanks for all your hard work!",1533104501,1533151195,False,115,1,0.797201037406921387,11,False,False,False,False,,,

I went into the game knowing little to nothing about it and couldn't have been happier. A lot of people are going to underestimate just how retro the gameplay of this title is. Fighting enemies isn't a fast and slick affair, but more about remembering movement patterns and striking at the right moment than it is about reflexes. This gives it an almost arcadey feel for me, which is just perfect for what I was looking for. In this regard it is a lot closer to titles like Castle In The Darkness or Odallus than it is to Ori And The Blind Forest or Hollow Knight. And as much as I love those two, I prefer my gameplay a bit more on the classic side and Chasm provides. Plus in Chasm I never feel like I'm lost with dead ends everywhere, just like I felt when playing Castle In The Darkness, which I prefer over the ""where the hell do I even go"" of many other Metroidvanias.

The story is well written and a nice little mystery so far, but never gets in the way which is highly welcome. I don't expect a novel, but a platformer instead and don't want to sit through endless cutscenes, so I'm happy that what's there is  as good as it is, but also that it doesn't keep me from playing.

I'm scratching my head, because Chasm is a pure Metroidvania, and a damn good one, better than most in the genre. It must be young vs old in the review section, because If you like older Metroidvanias, while it's not SotN 2, Chasm is the best around. I'm an older gamer, and I've played them all, and I really like the old school look and feel of this game. 

I have recently played Hollow Knight and I like Chasm much better. Hollow Knight bored the s*** outta me as it's focus is on exploration while offering scarce upgrades, one weapon, and non-existent level progression, a sin in a Metroidvania made post SotN. 

Controls in Chasm are tight, combat is simple fun that includes sub-weapons pulled right out of Castlevania, and loot is hard to come by, which makes finding it more exciting. I am playing on ""Hard"" and the game is providing a good challenge for me, not frustratingly hard, but not a cake-walk either. 

8/10 so far and more than worth the price of admission. Not a backer btw, but the game has been on my radar since I played a demo of it on a Game Stop's PS4 about 4 years ago. The full release has not disappointed me.

Update:
After completing the game I decided to update my review. Chasm has a lot going for it; #1 is absolutely beautiful graphics. Wow. Incredible. It's also a fun metrovania-style game with some classic mechanics and powerups. But, the first few hours of gameplay are extremely slow. Everything is unessisarily far away and enemys seems blind and unresponsive. You can literally walk around them, they move from point a to point b and do not interact with you at all. Halfway through the game you're tasked with retracing all of your previous paths and struggle to remember what small thing you noticed in what small room. A few time I just gave up since it was too annoying to retrace my steps and I busted out a walkthrough (I know, lame). The music is horrendous. Turn it off before it makes you insane. So. Fucking. Repetitive. The difficulty settings are out of wack. Hard is almost impossible, especially with how far things are apart. And easy is essentially invincibility. The enemy's never drop anything good. I get more cash breaking lanterns (which turns into one of the most tedious and some-what enjoyable parts of this game after a few hours). All-in-all, if you're really into games like this, I would recommend it. But in general, wait for a deep discount.

TLDR;
If you're really into Metrovania-style games this is a great addition to your library. If not, skip it until it's at a deep, deep discount. Play on easy, turn off the music and use a walkthrough to enjoy the beautiful graphics.",1533095988,1533613150,True,0,0,0.488372087478637695,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Chasm is a great looking, tight feeling action RPG in the vain of Symphony of the Night. All the mainstays are here: backdash, after images while running slow, hats that summon familiars, candelabra smashing. You can fairly early on (at least in my first run) get the option to buy ""spells"" which are without a doubt weapons close to our hearts - if you know what I mean. The game scratches every Symphony itch!

While I wholeheartedly recommend the game it does indeed have a few flaws. The backdash does not cancel your attack making it somewhat useless. Monsters can boil down to two groups: minding their own business and beeline to you the moment they see you. Beware snakes! Magic energy can take its sweet time getting to you and if you switch rooms any uncollected magic chasing you just dissapears.

Also, I have not played a lot of this game, but I feel like I know where it is going. 

I like the art, music, and general aesthetic of the movement animations. I do however think the font is a little annoying to read. But the real problem as many people have said is the pace of combat. The backdash has little use because you have to wait until the any animation is done before you can use it and it has a start up, so you are better off jumping away from your enemies. Some people think it is okay to have slow swinging animations because it promotes planning out your attack. I think that is a poor excuse for clunky controls. I think the aerial mobility and the general movement is very fluid, but the attack animations/ dash animations just lock you into animations for too long. Whenever I am running around and only need 1 hit to kill enemies, the game is genuinly fun and fluid, but reaching an enemy that takes more than one hit feels like a chore. I wouldn't mind if the animations are shorter (which makes it easier for all skill levels) or if there are animation cancels that are useful (better for more skilled players. But as it stands, it feels very clunky. Some people say that this game doesn't have to be like SotN and I agree. I also enjoy old NES platformers, but this game was clearly designed with more fluid controls in mind with how the characters move and it just feels short of that when in combat. All it really needs is for the ability to interupt long animations or to just in general have shorter animations. The landing cancel is nice, but there needs to be more options.",1533094900,1533094900,False,2,0,0.476056218147277832,0,False,True,False,False,,,

1. 90% of enemies have no sort of recoil, so you are trying to sneak your short range weapon just close enough to hit without getting walked into
2. Your ground attack is useless, you will spend 100% of your time air attacking if you want to swing with half the speed and thus not get hit.

Minor grievances include, unimaginative magic system, I get that you want to pay homage to Castlevania, but everyone else has already done it, add something new.

I have counted 9 or 10 enemies with the same dash forward overhand swing attack, why waste the sprites, should have just recolored the same enemy.

In general the visuals are okay for me, not super inspired, but they're fine. The music is rather lackluster as well, I think the Catacombs is the only track I really got into, and its still quite spartan.

Hard mode is definitely challenging, but I'd rather it be for the right reasons, I'm fine with dying in a handful of hits if I have tools to timed dodge effectively, or at least interrupt the opponent. A dodge roll of some sort would be vastly more intuitive than the slide back manuever, which is vestigial in most cases.

I'll probably slog my way through to the ending since I've invested several hours, but I don't see myself having any incentive to replay.

One final comment, please try to think of something more exciting for a boss to drop other than +3 max health. After killing seven bosses at this point, that doesn't even add up to one more hit worth of health.",1533092806,1533154674,False,13,0,0.549648582935333252,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Its unique claim to fame is procedural map generation that unless you purposefully use the same seed value, ensures everyone will get a unique layout with different enemies, loot, etc.  While this sounds very interesting in theory, in practice the room pieces that are used to build the levels are going to feel broadly similar even when remixed somewhat, mostly due to identical ability progression.  It is an interesting novelty that feels like it has much more potential than the game makes use of currently.

The core of the game is very much inspired by Igarashi's Castlevanias, Symphony in particular.  It nails certain aspects lacking in other titles that try to emulate those games, such as weapon and item variety.  Control responsiveness is somewhat low due to a tendency to lock the player into animations and limited jump and backdash canceling, but once the timing is adjusted to, feels solid.

- Backtrack heavy. Most of the times you get to explore 6 new rooms till you get the next tool to proceed in the next area or just end up with gear that is weaker then the stuff you can find in the area you backtracked from.
- Terrible drop chances. You get a bunch of quests that ask you to kill a certain enemie. Devs boasted about a playtime of 6-10h and with me spending 50min on getting 4 items for a single quest makes that statement more then just ridiculous
- Walljump controls combined with the parachute are bad
- Many rooms have enemie & trap placements that lead to unavoidable damage.
- Bare-bones combat, later on with frustrating enemies that have a 50% block chance or a 100% block chance against your abilities.

[b]*저는 이 게임을 구매하지 말라는 말씀을 드리고 싶지 않습니다. 가성비로 보면 제값은 하는 게임이라고 생각합니다.*[/b]

[h1]이 게임의 가장 큰 단점은, 이 게임만의 독창적인 점이 없다는 점에 있습니다.[/h1]
나쁘게 말하면 단순히 고전 메트로배니아 게임의 카피게임에 불과하다고 까지 말할 수 있습니다. 물론, 그렇기 때문에 기본적인 메트로배니아 요소는 즐길 수 있어서 이 부분은 게이머의 취향에 따라 호불호가 갈릴 듯 합니다.

[b]장점[/b]: 유려한 도트 애니메이션. 퀄리티 대비 저렴한 합리적인 가격. 기본기는 갖추고 있는 메트로배니아. 랜덤 시드 맵 채택.

단점: 

[b]굉장히 지루한 BGM[/b]: 음악은 게임에 있어서 대단히 중요한 위치를 차지하고 있다고 생각하는 저로서는, 이 게임의 지루하고 반복적인, 특색 없고 단조로운 음악은 정말 참을 수 없을 정도로 끔찍했습니다. 특히나 이가바니아류에서 맛볼 수 있는 야마네 미치루씨의 환상적이고 압도적이며 이야기를 가지고 있는 음악들과 비교가 되어 더더욱 끔찍했습니다. 농담이 아니라 저는 블러드스테인드를 킥스타터 해놓고 전혀 걱정을 하지 않았던 점이, 아무리 게임이 시궁창에 돈을 버릴 셈이냐씨의 배설물처럼 나오더라도 적어도 야마네 미치루씨의 사운드트랙은 얻을 수 있으니까! 란 점이었습니다. 게임에 있어서 음악은 대단히 중요합니다. 이거 시험에 나오니 적어두세요.

[b]비효율적인 루트맵[/b]: 이곳 저곳에 존재하는 워프존을 숏컷 개념으로 사용할 수 있는데, 이럴거면 워프존에 세이브존을 만들어 두었어야 한다고 생각합니다. 세이브 하기 위해서 워프존까지 가서 또 숏컷 타고 마을까지 몇 맵이나 이동해야 한다는 것은 대단히 고통. 더군다나 한 존에 세이브룸이 하나 있을까 말까한 구성이기 때문에 더더욱 괴롭습니다. 죽으면 바로 게임오버가 되는 시스템인데 말이죠. 게다가 말이 숏컷이지, 숏컷이 한 지역 당 3개 정도 밖에 없기 때문에 숏컷을 타고도 한참이나 점프, 전투를 번갈아가며 진행해야 되돌아갈 수 있어서 괴롭습니다.

[b]단조로운 전투[/b]: 메트로배니아의 전투 시스템 중 가장 기본적인 요소만 있으며, 무기는 여러 종류가 있지만 그 개성이 강하지 않아 그저 공격력만 보고 사용하는 정도입니다. 블러드스테인드가 데모버전에서 보여줬던 다양한 무기마다의 개성적인 공격모션, 속성능력치, 필살기 등의 특수능력등을 보면 분명 메트로배니아는 점차적으로 진화하고 있는데, 이 게임 무기의 개성은 고전 월하의 야상곡과 비교하기도 부끄러울 정도로 단조롭습니다.

[b]적의 패턴[/b]: 역시 매우 단조로워서 보스 조차 3~4 패턴 정도를 가지고 있는데, 일반 적들의 대부분은 단순히 박치기 공격/원거리 공격을 해오기 때문에 상대하면서 패턴을 파훼하는 즐거움이 모자랍니다. 또한 중반부 부터의 적은 백대시의 거리를 훨씬 넘게 추적해오는 공격을 해오며, 쓰러뜨려봐야 출혈대비 격파기대가 낮기 때문에 무시하고 넘어가게 됩니다. 피통도 상당히 많기 때문에 귀찮기도 하고요. 적의 배치도 지형이나 그런 것의 상성을 고려하지 않은 단순 배치라 아쉽습니다만 이 부분은 랜덤 시드 맵이기 때문에 어쩔 수 없을지도 모르겠네요.

[b]백대시[/b]: 가 준비되어있기는 한데, 흔히 메트로배니아에서는 공격모션의 후반부를 캔슬이 가능합니다만, 이 게임은 그게 불가능 한 대신 *백대시 중에 공격이 가능*합니다. 적의 공격을 피하면서 공격하기 위해서는 백대시버튼+공격버튼을 동시에 눌러야 합니다. 다만 엑박패드의 버튼 배치를 바꿀 수 없기 때문에 X+Y버튼이라는 귀찮은 동시입력을 해야합니다. 애석하게도 이 게임은 아직 패드 버튼 설정을 지원하지 않기 때문에, 이 버튼 배치 때문에 삑사리가 자주 나서 죽게 되면 대단히 짜증이 납니다. 다만 패드 설정 부분은 개발자가 도입을 준비중이라고 합니다.

[b]RPG요소[/b]?: 광고 문구에는 RPG적 성장요소가 있다고 합니다만, 사실은 그저 적을 쓰러뜨리면 경험치가 모여 레벨업이 되는 점과, 아이템을 쓰면 *랜덤 능력치 1 상승*정도 뿐이고, 장비 마련에 있어서도 자원을 모아 크래프팅 하는 요소가 있긴 한데 단순하고 깊이가 없는 그저 구색 갖추기 정도로만 존재합니다.

[b]캐릭터 커스텀[/b]?: 은 당연히 불가능하고, 장비를 교체해도 외관에는 전혀 변화가 없습니다. 또 월하의 야상곡 처럼 독자적 레벨을 가진 패밀리어 같은 것이 존재하는데 웃기게도 이걸 레벨업 시킬려면 특정 장비(모자)만 사용해야하고, 패밀리어의 레벨이 올라가도 장비의 능력치는 성장하지 않기 때문에 이걸 쓸려면 쓰레기 능력치 아이템을 고정적으로 장비해야합니다. 패밀리어 같은 것은 따로 시스템을 빼두던가 했어야죠.

[b]진행의 점프 의존도[/b]: 메트로배니아 라기 보다는 점핑 플랫포머 게임을 연상시킬 정도로 점프를 많이 해야합니다. 그것도 대부분은 최대거리를 아슬아슬하게 조절해야 하는 구간이 많아 점프혐오자(?)인 저는 짜증이 많이 났습니다.

[b]*총평*[/b] : 메트로배니아 팬으로서 느낀 부족한 면이 꽤 컸다는 점으로 부정적인 평가를 남깁니다만, 가격대비 구성은 합리적이라고 생각하며, 게임 자체의 완성도가 치명적으로 낮다거나 하지는 않기 때문에 시간과 자금에 여유가 있을 때에는 부담없이 구입해서 즐겨보시는 것도 괜찮지 않을까 합니다. 그런데 스팀의 마스터피스급 메트로배니아들(Deadcells, AxiomVerge등)도 가격이 대단히 저렴하기 때문에 경쟁력이 있을지는... 지금 상태로는 올해 출시되는 메트로배니아 최고의 작품은 역시 이가가 직접 만든 블러드스테인드가 되지 않을까 싶네요. 백커 데모 버전도 대만족이었으니.",1533086115,1533086213,False,17,1,0.709101676940917969,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a game that rolls a seed at the beginning and then you keep that seed the entire game. Much like a Randomizer. This is not a roguelike in that every time you die it re-randomizes everything. This game is a metroidvania with items and backtracking and fun and exploration. Not just murder murder murder fast fast forward forward. it is chill and fun.

Feels very much like I'm playing an SNES version of Symphony of the Night w/ the ability to mix the layouts up every time I want to play again. 

This review is more in response to the negative reviews of people who haven't progressed past the first zone, because I feel sorry for anyone who reads those less than one hour of playtime reviews and doesn't pick up the game because it's a treasure.

Yes, the first enemies in the game don't have attack animations. This is called a difficulty curve. So new players can learn how to many from easy enemies to harder enemies over a period of time. The first enemies in SOTN were zombies that surprise surprise, didn't have any attack animation. Oh, what's that? The most highly regarded metroidvania in the world has enemies with no attack animation. My word! 

The same goes for the first boss having easy to read tells / not a lot of variety. This again, is just called difficulty curve. Pretty standard or used to be. Not every game needs to focus around murdering the player horribly at every opportunity.

If you want classic metroidvania action in a beautiful retro art style with classy sound and tunes. Grab Chasm. Play game. have fun.

If you want to more roguelike permadeath lots of resets and  progression walls, this is not the game for you.

Overall: 90/100 (Tentative - Once I finish my Hard Run, I'll update this with a final score).

Pros:
- Platforming feels great, ESPECIALLY after getting the [spoiler]double-jump ability[/spoiler].
- Combat can be really fun, especially when getting some cool new weapons.
- Plenty of unique weapon types to mix and match for certain situations.
- Lots of little secrets, and loot drops.
- Looks amazing, sounds great.
- The random-world generation is done phenomenally, honestly feels like someone hand-crafted it and it wasn't random at all.
- Difficulty on normal feels just right. (I'll update this later once I finish my hard run).

Cons:
- A few of the tracks can get a bit repetitive, but I wasn't annoyed by any of them.
- Some of the loot drops (unique items) can be insanely rare (in my experience).
- Depending on your seed, the world generation can be a bit of a pain to backtrack through.
- A few things could use a bit of extra info on what they do or the limits of their ability etc. (Some of these were fixed before release, so it could always change).",1533081380,1533081380,True,0,0,0.49746173620223999,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I'm looking at you, worm boss. Why did you remove the goddamn cling points and add one-pixel areas that you could bonk your head on, completely foiling your attempts at dodging? In beta the boss was relatively intuitive and decently fun to fight. Now it's nothing but a mess of poorly-telegraphed attacks that require pixel-perfect timing to dodge. 

Also the combat feels as slow and dull as it ever did, which people also complained about when it was still in beta, but apparently no one on the dev team cared.

When I'm avoiding your enemies rather than fighting them after playing for only a few hours, that means they're not fun to fight, that's a failure of design. Every enemy is pretty much just a dull slog of wasted time because they have one trick, over and over, that you have to respond to, over and over, for like half a minute just to kill some random goon unless you're super overlevelled for it.

I really wanted to like it since I am currently finishing Hollow Knight and I wanted more Metroidvania awesomeness in my life.
Sadly, this is neither Castlevania Symphony of the Night nor Hollow Knight.
The levels are desperately empty. It really feels like this kind of amateur GameMaker games but with ultra-polished graphics.
Sadly, graphics are not enough for a game to succeed and combat is way too basic to fill the level design void.
Also, the story is not engaging at all. Maybe it would improve some hours into the game but most likely it will not.
The music is not bad, it's just generic and not thrilling at all. More like relaxing easy-listening. Not the kind of thing you expect in a supposed Metroidvania.
Nothing in here that will engage you to play for hours.
The thing is, this game COULD have been very cool: the graphics, movements and technical aspects are great. It is lacking in the gameplay department. It needs better monster IA (right now they are REALLY dumb), more variety and quantity of them and an actual carefully crafted map that makes you WANT to know more and explore!
In the hour I have played, I saw at least 4 times the exact same screen but with slightly diferent monster positions.
Return to the drawing board guys. This game could be so much more...

(Dead cells, Hollow Knight, Rogue Legacy, Binding of Isaac). 

The sad part is I feel really misled.  All the trailers I saw for the game and even the pictures on the steam page show really amazing sprawling and inspired art-work.  But 90% of the game is the caves underneath all the gorgeous scenery, and its all procedurally generated, so it doesnt have a polished artistic feel to it.  It feels very.... seems like some corners were cut.  

Aside from that, the combat was very shallow, and the ""RPG elements"" were weak at best.  There is no space for alternate playstyles or builds, its just basic weapons with no special moves or attacks, and very generic magic spells which feel dull and flat.

I was very ready to love this game and devote the next 2 weeks to it, but if you come to this game expecting depth, go somewhere else my friend, cuz its not here.  Go play Hollow Knight or Rogue Legacy.   

It kind of makes me angry to be honest, because everyone is always trying to rally for the little man and cheer on the indie devs and shit on the AAA games.  But games like this that feel half-assed and 6 years in the making I heard.  I mean thats no excuse, and I can't give that a pass.  Also, when the game released, it didnt have an exe.  file.... lol it was literally an empty folder.  Go check the dev's twitter if you dont believe me.  I was willing to write it off but it wound up being a canary in the coal mine.

Chasm is designed basically to simulate the general feel of SoTN and the GBA/DS Castlevanias with a bit more precision platforming and some procedural generation of the map from premade pieces (similar to what Enter the Gungeon does).

That includes the whole control, look, and feel of the game. Backdashing, lock frames at the end of attack animations (promoting jumping/short hopping to get extra hits), backtracking through previous maps when you get new movement abilities, etc.

There's not really a lot of wrinkles to it. There's a full range of equipment slots (weapon, magic, helmet, chestpiece, two accessories), consumable items, levels with stats, a main hub you can recover and purchase supplies at, and the overall ""world"" is broken up into several unique biomes that loop back on themselves into a central teleport hub for each and have connections to the other biomes within.

I enjoyed it a lot because that's basically exactly what I wanted. All the other 2d Metroidvanias/Metroid type games all kinda scratch a particular itch (Axiom Verge for example basically literally being Glitchpunk Metroid) and this one fits right in there. You want really nice sprite art, tight controls, and the Metroidvania-style gameplay loop of exploration/backtracking/risk (i.e. getting to another savepoint before dying)? Chasm fits the bill. TBH this game screams to be played on a portable because it's easy to pick up and put down, the length is just about right (~8-10 hours), and the game doesn't overcomplicate itself.

If you want my gripes as someone who played a bunch of earlier builds (did you know this had a Dark Souls thing going for a while?):
-For some reason the Mines theme was redone like a half a dozen times and the release one isn't as good as one of the earlier themes IMO (Sorry Jimi, for some reason I kinda liked the chanting in the theme a couple versions back)

-The loot table could use some sprucing up and needs to be tiered out a bit more. I got a lot of really samey stuff about halfway into the game that was a wash for what I already had equipped. White chests are kinda underwhelming and should give gear + additional loot IMO

-Quest items for some quests don't seem to hardly exist. The kitchen one is the worst.

-Few too many long hallways, little too much forced backtracking through them resulting in usually you being kinda overleveled at the end if you're trying to fill your map mostly out.

-Monsters don't always react to being hit, so once you upgrade your magic knife spell you can basically cheese a ton of enemies.

-Bosses/mini-boss difficult feels insanely random. Some are really hard to no-hit, some you almost can just stand there and just mash them to death. Final Boss looks really great but is not very hard.",1533074007,1533074007,True,1,0,0.521276414394378662,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Chasm is a good game, is not great, is not bad. If you are a fan of Metroidvania, buy it. If you just like Metroidvania, there is better games for the same price, wait for a sale then buy Chasm.

Pros:

-The art is great;
-There is a great variaty of enemies;
-It's a metrodivania with elements of RPG, and for those who are fans, we don't see much of this games around;
-The dev is reading the forum and is listening, so there is a great chance that he will fix the cons and the game will became a lot better.

Cons:

-The dev need to solve the evade system, i beat the game without using the evade button not even once, because it's just sucks, there is this weird delay between attacks, and the evade don't cancel any action, so it's just better run than trying to get the right time to use the evade;
-The story is kind of meh... There is no deepnes in the characters, nothing that hooked me up to carry about;
-I did not liked the ""no hit"" system. In this game if you kill the bosses without taking any hit you will receive a secret item (weapon, armor, etc.) But the thing is, that you spend more time restarting the game and walking around to the boss room, than actually fighting. I did every bosses whithout taking hit, but i did not enjoyed and din't feelt rewarded.

What i really missed:

In my opnion the dev putted so much efforte in the artwork of the game (which looks amazing) but din't put any customization for our charater, for me one of the biggest aspect of getting a new armor is to see how badass you look wearing it.

- Game looks pretty, that's about all I can say positively about it. 
Cons: 
- Movedment is very slow and unresponsive. Makes combat a bitch when you know the enemys pattern but you can't dodge out of the way cause your so damn slow.
- Hit registration is laughable. If 2 enemys overlap you only hit 1 of them so the other will hit you.
- Gas clouds everywhere. Feels like the developers intentionally left little things everywhere just to kill you slowly, forcing you to replay the area. 
- Combat is terrible. You touch anything you take dmg. Enemy has knife in front of him, yes I should take damage. I jump behind him walk up and touch his back, damage. Makes no sense. For some enemys it makes sense but if you dodge behind a large enemy you get stuck in a damage loop that you can't get out of unless you just run away. Hate this mechanic in games forces you to play a poke and run style for everything. 
- Like others have mentioned when you die you don't feel compeled to fight anything so you're just run past everything cause that shit is boring as hell. 

TLDR movement isn't great and that bleeds into everything. Combat is terrible with a poke and run style too it. Don't buy, give it more time to improve. I may try again in the future but for now it's being refunded :/

- The crafting/enhancement system is loveless and shallow
- There's a shortcut system which isn't terrible, but tedious. Instead of giving you another save point, you have to use this system to get back to your hub, because [i]there[/i] is a save point.
- You'll learn way to much stuff which you do with A. I don't want to spoil movement abilities but having so many of those on A makes your final movement capability feel surfeited instead of flexible.

So I decided to give it a try as soon as it's available and I wasn't disappointed.

I'll start with the pros:

+Enemy design: there's about 50 or so common enemies and meeting a new type of enemy every time felt really great, wanting to learn their patterns and attacks and figuring out how to counter each one felt really great.
+Art and music: not much to say here, they just fit perfectly.
+Puzzles: even though there weren't a great deal of puzzles but it kept the gameplay interesting unlike your typical dungeon crawler.
+Metroidvania experience: your typical metroidvania feel, backtracking didn't feel repetitive and kept throwing new discoveries so it won't feel useless.

now I'll be talking about things that might differ from person to person, though in my book I call them pros

+-Combat: It's right that combat doesn't feel fluid specially when you're attacking since your character is stuck in his place, but I'm pretty sure that's a design decision. When you attack you should think about the consequences of your attack. Should I attack? or would I get countered by that specific enemy?.
+-Platforming: It wasn't the greatest aspect of the game but it wasn't the worst, an alright platforming experience.

now for the cons

-Trial and error feel: Some parts, later in the game, were definitely a trial and error. for example, going in a dark room where I needed to climb a long wall using wall jumping where there is two chainsaws going up and down on both sides which you can not see definitely needs many deaths until you get the timing right. Also, this brings me to the second cons which is....
-Wall climbing: it's just a ******* inconsistent angry inducing skill. I couldn't make this skill to work and it drove me to the point where I just mashed the bottom and hoped for the best. it even ****s up your normal platforming sometimes.
-World design: It's true there's different areas, but they just felt like re-skins with the same layout.
-Save points: Going into a new room and seeing that it's connected to 3 other rooms and going in and out each one and hoping for it to be a save point isn't that fun, it's not a game breaker for sure. But, the urge to check every connected room before proceeding and hoping it's a save point is a little bit overwhelming.

Last thing, about the price of the game. I didn't start a new game yet so I'm not sure about the replayability aspect, but it's definitely a polished game and delivers a 10-15 hours for the first playthrough.

Verdict: A good metroidvania rogue-like game with minor issues, I'd recommend it to a friend.",1533069533,1533069533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pixel art is great, I loved how the artist draw the forest, the mountains, but the caves look pretty... ordinary. And I'm afraid that most part of the game take place in the caves. Anyway it makes process of coming back to the village more awesome - finally me and my character can breath some fresh air ha-ha.
The plot seems to be interesting. In any case dialogs are well-structured and funny to read. I can't say the same about the long notes but it seems that there are only ""not necessary"" information there so it's okay to skip it.
Music is fine, nothing special, but it doesn't annoy.
At firs I thought that the game is too easy but I was wrong. When I find myself in the cave with the skulls I finally saw the ""Game Over"" screen for the first time and then made a run with almost zero HP to the next checkpoint. I want to say that developers put the checkpoints to the perfect places they should be. Level design is good, backtracking is not annoying, the only thing that made me feel myself really uncomfortable - repetitive tilemaps. Too many rooms were build with the same objects, but it's not a serious issue.

I had it on my list since they announced it, didnt back it on Kickstarter though because i dont do that for several reasons.
Since then it underwent many years of development.
I dont want to sound mean, but i honestly ask where those years went as its quality seems not reflective for the time invested.
Well developing a game is hard work that takes time especially when being a small independant studio. 
I get that and it is a finished game at last instead of another title spawned into Early Access.

But when i played the prototype once back then when it was fresh, i felt that the concept was much better than what i played now. 
It felt like a 2D Diablo with randomness and i liked that a lot.

I normally dont do reviews that early, but after 4-5 years or so waiting for it, i feel like i even will refund it and have to give people an honest opinion. 
I dont see light at the end of the tunnel for this game for the following reasons.
Some of which were named already and i didnt even pay attention to those points (although reading them thinking it couldnt be that bad) until i noticed them myself.

One major point, that is rather many points in one, is the Backtracking.
I cant remember it that good but i dont remember that backtracking was a negative thing in the Prototype. 
For those scratching their head or not knowing the language well enough, Backtracking means that you have to move the way you just went back to do important gameplay.
Clearer phrased this means that after you went into the dungeon and cleared several rooms, collected gold and experience, you want to get back to town to buy items, better weapons and do other stuff.
In Chasm there is no convenient way to do that, instead you have to clear all those rooms you just went through backwards again.
Which takes quite a lot of time, as there are also a lot of platforming sections to do.

I dont know whether you were transfered to town after death in the Prototype, however, it would be a really good idea for this version of Chasm.
As it is now, the game is a simple ""you restart where you saved last time""-game. 
But even worse, you are thrown back into main menu instead and have to load your last save which then spawns you where you saved last. 
So even time is wasted. 
I dont get why you just dont lose a bit of gold and experience and spawn back at town.
Just mentioning, you cant save whenever you want, instead you can only save your progress at specific rooms with statues.
You know, Bonfire-esque, just bad.

I further dont get why i have to move back to town by hand, sometimes quite long ways. 
Why not giving me a portal option or even offer Town Portals at Vendors like Diablo?
The way the game does Backtracking feels tedious. 
That is because it does spawn the enemies right where they were, once you move from one room to the next.
Since it isnt a continuedly flowing game, you will kill the same enemies at the same spots over and over, when moving back and forth. 
Their positions and types arent even randomized to at least give variations. 
And their presence isnt impacting enough so it might cause situations super unfair to the player. 
Which means there is no real reason to not have randomized enemies and enemy locations in most rooms.
But because of the way dying works by spawning at the last savespot, it is even worse than the quite similar title Hollow Knight, which does slightly the same just not as bad.
Honestly i feel like Hollow Knight is the better Chasm.
In fact it is exactly like Chasm, just with more character, more polishing, more content, more story and not as many flaws.

Boringness in Presentation:
Chasm is also one thing, not really interesting, or in short, boring.
Its quite boring to look at, its boring to listen to. 
Items will NOT cause any change in appearance, at least till now i havent found that they do although equipping different items.
The music is absolutely horrible and tedious. 
The game played one track for the starting location, then one track for the village, then one track for the whole dungeon. 
ONE track for the area you are going to spend hours in.
No switching for bossfights. 
No switching for specific and unique rooms, no switching just to provide variation.
I can, at this point, only assume this will change later. But even if, this isnt enough. 
Which makes presentation not satisfying at all. Certainly not 4+ years development satisfying.

Controls:
The controls and hitting of enemies, the responsiveness and platforming are also not feeling smooth.
Its not that anything of that is super bad or that you cant get good at it, but it feels not well designed and accomplished.
While typing this, i  ask myself why there arent different attacks for each weapon.
Equiping other weapons will cause different attacks (although no different animations) but each weapon only has one attack type. 
It would have potential there.

I often enough was damaged because the controls are too sluggish in connection with what i had to do.
For exaple: 
There are enemy types that do a charge attacks after a brief pause of animation.
So you stand infront of them, hear a sound that indicates that they will attack after half a second of charging and then they attack with a sudden swoop forwards. 
Problem is, if you attacked first, then you cant evade because the delay between your attack and  the moment until you are allowed to perform a jump forbidds that.

Which means you have to bait your enemy into an attack, then wait for that to happen before doing your first attack. 
Not only does that stop and interupt your gameflow, its also unfair when you get damaged because the game is unflexible. 
Further it means that combat only allows one tactic to make it successful and doesnt allow a more dynamic way to do it.
It takes away player agency this way.

Resumée:
I had high expactations when waiting for Chasm. 
I waited many years. So much happened in that time of it being developed and i had as much hope for it, as i had in other games that were done in such a long time. 
Like Owlboy.
But contrary to a game like Owlboy, i couldnt notice the long development time here.
And contrary to a game like Hollow Knight i cant recommend it.
If you like the idea of Chasm, get Hollow Knight.
If you want a touch of randomness and more RPG elements with stats tweaking, leveling up and item looting, then get Vagante instead.
Vagante even has multiplayer (also online) which is quite a rarity in this genre.
So there are two really well done recommendations that take the place of Chasm.
If you already have enough of both games and search for more, then Chasm is maybe worth a look for you, although being a noticeable bit worse than Vagante and Hollow Knight.

Im sad Chasm cant deliver. 
Its an ok game it seems, but nothing special. 
Certainly not ""i waited 4 years and longer for it""-special. 
What a let down, i really didnt expect Chasm to become a game i wait until i get it in a Humble Bundle for approximately 2$. 
I thought this was a no brainer purchase. Sadly its not and before you buy it you should play both of the mentioned titles.
Doing so will just leave Chasm appear blant.",1533063593,1533064629,False,13,1,0.449852287769317627,11,True,False,False,False,,,

Many times I'd see myself just trying to run past the enemies (and would get damaged by trying to do so)  because fighting them feels more like a chore than anything else.
The procedurally generated aspect of the games brings nothing to the table and just adds more on the feeling that everything feels like a chore. Depending on the seed you get you may find yourself fighting 2 to 4 rooms of enemies on a narrow corridor and getting nothing at the end of it. If that wasn't enough, you still have to revisit many of these rooms in order to get chests you couldn't otherwise access because you didn't have the necessary spell/item/skill to do so. 

The combat is uninspiring and boring. You have your regular straight attack, an air attack which is your basic attack in air and most weapons have a crouch attack. The only weapon I've found that has a different attack pattern is the club, which attacks in a arc. Besides that the only difference you will see in weapons is damage and a minor difference in range and attack speed. There is no directional attack and no special attack so most of the time you will pick the weapon with the most damage output, not one the suits your playstyle (because there isn't any).

The pixel-art is nice, but the only place you will see it at its full potential is the city. The dungeon rooms are dull and empty looking, usually with a ok looking background and your usual chandelier hanging from the ceiling. From time to time you may bump into the rooms that are necessary to progress the story and those are a little bit better looking. Overall, the looks just feels empty and, like something is missing.

The controls are easy to use, nothing complicated so anyone can pick up the gameplay just fine. The animation is as expected of a side scroller which is beautifully done. the UI for character menu has an easy layout that you can find what you're looking for, a beastiary that keeps track of what monster drops for grinding craftable items or loot (they unlock after you kill a certain amount of the same monster type)

As soon as the animation finishes, there remains this awkward couple of milliseconds where you're just waiting. That same ""frozen"" animaton state exists with the sword as well.

I think if the combat had just a touch more fluidity, I'd be completely down for this game.

This is metroidvania. The ""dungeon"" you're exploring is generated each time you start a new game. I can't say how different each run will be yet, but so far - the generated world gives me challenge I've been waiting for.

I'm kinda missing weapons and armors, or ""souls"" dropping from enemies - you know, right? Soma made us like the abilities from enemies. 

You start as a plain soldier with a sword and through your journey you have to save people, who will return to abandoned town and repopulate it (You know the drill), unlocking new shops and gear. And you keep crawling down to the root of all evil.

The controls are not fantastic, but good. As other folks stated here - the backdash feels a bit stiff. Jumping and navigating feels great though.

The combat is just what you expect it to be - good. So far I've met just one boss and he was quite easy, really simple pattern.

What can I say? Just buy the thing, it's definetly worth your attention. Even if it happens that replayability is not that good - you will remember your first run. I do hope that developer will add more over time (like boss rush mode, or some dlc's).

Some changes may occur between this and the release version.

Chasm's a game I've been looking forward to for a long time. I love Metroidvanias, I've been interested in procedural generation for a long time, and I adore moody retro pixel art -  Chasm has all these things and more.

The gameplay is basic, but polished - you hack and slice your way through randomly-generated and respawning rooms, fighting bats, rats, trolls, kobolds, then later fighting through an undead horde, a poisonous garden, and other locales. The Metroidvania-ness is there - you keep exploring 'til you hit a dead end, then you backtrack to find a way around it. You unlock teleporters as you go, which makes traveling around the map a lot quicker.

You find different equipment as you play, be it from monster drops or by purchasing it in town. Different weapons have different swing speeds/animations - a heavy 2 handed axe takes longer to swing than a dagger, but hits in a large arc. Weapons also have their own graphics, though armor does not - your character looks much the same at the end of the game as he does at the start.

The map generation works. It doesn't feel randomly generated, but it also lacks some of the fine tuning non-random Metroidvanias such as Hollow Knight show. The art is gorgeous, but some map seeds can generate multiples of the same room (though usually only 2 or at most 3), leading to some less-than-perfect exploration. Still, for a seed-based map system, it's one of the best I've seen so far.

The combat is great. Hits feel nice, and you honestly feel like you're a better fighter once you get used to the controls. At the start you will get hit by every other enemy, but towards the end you will be jumping and dodging around, landing blows and retreating before the enemy can counter you. Enemy difficulty ramps up towards the end, but I didn't have too much trouble once I found some good equipment.

Healing can be a hassle - enemies do not drop health ups, leaving save points as your primary source of replenishment. A death wipes your progress since your last save and kicks you back to the title screen. Enemies can very rarely drop food (and you can buy more later in the game, but the cost often outweighs the benefit), but your primary source of health will always be learning-to-not-get-hit. Much like combat itself, it was a hassle at the beginning of the game but quickly tapered off once I learned how combat and the game itself works.

Bosses are great. Fun experiences, unique designs, challenging fights, and almost always come with a savepoint mere moments away.

Storyline is pretty basic, but there for those who care to look. It's delivered via optional note pickups. It's nothing mind blowing, but it gives a nice insight into the lore, and is backed up by the again-beautiful pixel art.

Music was fine, I do not find myself humming the tunes but I also did not get frustrated by hearing the same tracks over and over.

The game has a couple of unpolished gimmicks - a bestiary that fills in as you play, a basic crafting system that uses rare ingot drops, a potion you only use in a couple of rooms, exp/defense/money shrines that are often completely useless, but these might be polished more in future updates, be they before release or after.

As far as updates, the devs have been working their butts off since the beta was dropped - they have already fixed a plethora of bugs, and I'm sure they'll keep polishing at least until the game drops on the 31st July.

А если вы не согласены, то она вырубит вас дубинкой и сделает еще чего похуже [spoiler] например,  закопает лопатой.	[/spoiler] 

Оружие условно делится на корокое и быстрое, длинное и медленное, и сбалансированное. Казалось бы выбирай на свой вкус, но нет.  Игра то и дело заставлет тебя пересмотреть свой выбор. Этого врага лучше держать на расстоянии. От этого увернутся и быстро заколоть. А к этому вообще лучше не приближаться и закидать его ножами пока не заметил. И вот, не смотря на все разннообразие., ты бегаешь с мечом: он хотя бы ударит вовремя.

Как вы поняли, просто закликать врага не получится. Увернутся в любой момент тоже. У.В.Ы. Уклоняйся. Выжидай. Ы атакуй. Благо моделей поведения у стандартных врагов немного. С босами  и мини-босами также, только укланятся придется чаще.
В целом чего-то архи сложного нет, напоминает Hollow Knight, только с метательным оружием.

Beautiful art, fluid animations, combat is fun (even if its a bit clunky), levels have a lot of different bits and pieces that make it feel unique with every new room you enter. Finding townspeople and improving your character is fun, solving puzzles is great... I was expecting this game to be around 80-90% on Steam when I checked back.

When I came back, this game was getting trashed! (mixed rating with below 70% as of right now)

So, what went wrong?

In my opinion this game commits two sins that are probably keeping it from being great:
First one: no originality. If you've played many Metroidvanias, this game literally has not one single unique idea to offer. Absolutely every mechanic, weapon, enemy etc in this game is copy&pasted from other games. And I mean every single one, even down to the art and boss fights.

Is this a reason to downvote it? Some players might think so.

I think the worst sin this game committed was releasing the exact next day after La-Mulana 2 released. No wonder you have a tough crowd when you release with such extremely well crafted competition.

If someone is reading this, hoping for a good time with a Metroidvania in the style of the good old classics with a modern face-lift, I say don't worry too much about the review score and give it a bash.

The magic spells you can buy are copies of classic spells, including the Axe, the Knife, and the Molotov (Holy Water). You can smash lanterns for loot, and enemies burn up in flames when they die.

Unfortunately, it suffers heavily from long, drawn-out, and uninteresting corridors. The mines were incredibly same-y, and the following area wasn't much better. There, it took me upwards of 20-30 minutes to hit something unique and interesting, and it ended up being an excuse to spend 30 more minutes traipsing through a bunch of boring hallways.

I really want to like this, but it seems to have taken all of the base gameplay of post-SOTN Castlevania games, and none of the wonderful level design. I get that it's procedurally-generated, but honestly I don't think it works in this case. It doesn't help that the backgrounds are all pretty much the same within an area. It just ended up feeling like a chore to continue playing. Also, where are the varied weapon types? The only things I found in the 2 hours I played were a knife, a sword, a longer sword, and a longer halberd, all of which attack straight ahead in a line. Where is my big axe that hits overhead?

After so long in development, many might ponder if it was worth the wait at all, and I can stoutly say it was. The game looks, sounds, and feels fantastic to play. It runs wonderful even on my potato (for reference, my terrible laptop can barely even run Enter the Gungeon and experiences choppiness on Hollow Knight, so...) and the combat, movement, and platforming are smooth as butter. 
The story is nothing to write home about, but it's engaging, and the overall gameplay loop of exploring, rescuing townsfolk, and reporting back was satisfying and fun. Map markers make backtracking much less cumbersome than one might think - simply mark your map each time you run into an obstacle and you don't have to stumble around blindly to find that one spot where you needed a slide or a higher jump. 
It should definitely be noted: This isn't a roguelite. There is a hardcore mode and the maps are procedural, but the game is meant to be completable first-go, equipment isn't as random as, say, Robot Named Fight, and I'm pretty sure the bosses you run into are set instead of pulled from a pool. I can say this as a positive despite being an enormous fan of the genre, it very much works to the game's benefit. The devs have stated they worked hard to make the map generation perfect and I daresay they've done pretty well - it never really feels samey or repetitive, so far, and the smattering of quick travel points and save spots are very nicely placed. Same with the villagers, who provide either narrative or gameplay bonuses to the main town (like shops).

The story is enough to make exploring every aspect of the proceduraly generated map worth it. The story is smattered throughout the levels so it's not an excessive amount of exposition, but still enough to string me along. I love the combat (it's rather satisfying) with its smooth movement and pattern-based enemies reminiscent of the games of my youth. Newer versions of old enemies come along and keep the challenge high enough as you progress to be entertaining bordering on frustrating until you can master the newer patterns. (Except Titan. That giant floating head can suck it, him and the ceiling spiders.) There are some difficult jump puzzles and a fair amount of backtracking, but progress can be made if you keep at it. I also don't lament this because the world can appear large, but once you've unlock specific short-cuts, the world gets a lot smaller.

Chasm looks great, plays smooth, offers a challenge and doesn't make me want to punch a kitten or crash on me. If you love Metroidvanias or Action/Adventures games, Chasm should be a welcome addition to your library. For me, this is a fair contender for Game of the Year.

Eventualmente, o level design sofre de um problema de repetição de telas, mas isso não é nada que chegue a atrapalhar. Enigmas como o dos sinos, o dos quadros e o do pendante de ulak são bem bolados, mas podem deixar muita gente perdida. A música é envolvente, agradável e quase hipnotizante, mas não chega a ser marcante.

基本的な事としては重要アイテムを拾い、行動範囲を広げ、道中のモンスターを倒してレベルを上げて進む…というキャッスルヴァニアの月下の夜想曲スタイル
最初のキャラ作成時に設定されるシード値を変えることによって同じダンジョンに会うことがない、レアアイテムの収集など色々と飽きない工夫がしてある

しかし敵の種類や行動パターンが少なかったり、ダンジョン構造がただ長いだけでやる気がそがれたりしてなんか肩透かしを食らうためガッツリ遊びたいという人にはアプデやセールを待ったほうが賢明…という印象を受ける

けれどキャラや景色のドット絵は本当に素晴らしいので好きな人は言い値で買おう、見てるだけでも楽しいぞ！

キリのいいところまで進んだので追記(8月3日)

モンスターの種類が少ないと書きましたが全然そんなことはありませんでした、中盤〜終盤にかけての敵は非常に敵意が高く、考えなしに戦うと返り討ちにあうぐらいに動いてくれます
あと倒したデーモンが石になって崩れ落ちたりとキャッスルヴァニア経験者にはニヤッとする演出もあり非常に作り込んであります

しかしこのゲームのシステムであるマップのランダム生成が致命的に噛み合っていないという印象が強まりました

というかマップチップが少なすぎて隠し通路を一度見つけてしまうと「あ、ここに隠し通路あるな」と解ってしまいます、本当にマップチップが少ないです

全ての部屋が１つだけで完成されているためあそこにアイテムがあるけど通路がない…きっと壊せる壁があるに違いない！といったワクワク体験がありません、ただ今取れないのなら後で取れるだろうといった冷めた考えしか出ません

宝箱のある大部屋を生成するためには周りに細長い通路を配置しなければならないためその結果同じような長〜い通路が生成されます、探索の楽しみがなくただただ退屈です

しかもマップに印を一つしかつけれないため行動範囲を広げるアイテムを手に入れた時には記憶を頼りに長〜い通路を歩き回ります、そしてまた同じような作りの通路…

あとランダムイベントとしてルーレットを回して永続的にステータスボーナスを得られるミニゲームがあるのですがハズレもあり、ハズレれば永続的にステータスが下がります、なんでだよ

今のままではちょっと強くオススメできません、せめてマップチップを大増量してくれるか道中に様々なお楽しみオブジェクトを追加してくれたりなどのアプデをお待ちしています

ノーマルモードクリアしました（8月4日）

11時間ほどかかっていますが9時間ほどが移動に費やされています、後半は本当に移動するのが苦痛でした

というのも後半では電撃イライラ棒みたいなギミックが追加されるんです、それが本当に辛いうえに行き先がマップに表示されないワープゾーンなどもありさらに移動を辛くします

一応移動速度を上げるポーションもあるのですが店売りでしか手に入らず高いうえに効果は短いという嫌がらせ

そして苦労して開けた宝箱にはいま持っている武器の方が優れているザコ武器などが出てきてさらに疲れます

あとサブウェポンもバランスが悪くナイフを最大レベルにすれば他はいりません、他は持ってるだけ無駄

このゲーム開発に6年かけたそうですがあと1年ほど練ったほうがよかったのではないのでしょうか？本当になんか勿体ない…",1533043545,1533383853,True,26,0,0.698931097984313965,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Been watching it on steam listed for ages and i finally get to play it for a night of fun....only to be met with disappointment. Terrible disappointment. It's had 5 years of development time and the end result shows that something has gone wrong in it’s development.

The gameplay is slow and clunky. That's two major sins in this type of genre there that can make the game rather boring unless it has ways of compensating for it somehow such as pretty scenery, interesting story or unique mechanics. Unfortunately you're stuck in an underground, procedurally generated cave that makes every room look the same with a story that’s...ok for the most part. It somehow reminds me of the early game of Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia with the missing villagers and finding them restores more features to the hub town. Mechanic wise it does ultimately nothing new other than the fact that the majority of it’s content is done by procedural generation but even then it drops that pretty hard by the fact that the core powerups are the same, along with it’s design generally being boring as hell to slog though. It’s been done before and better (A Robot Named Fight or Dead Cells for example).

Frankly I'm just not captured at all by the game. It’s tiring to play and doesn’t bring anything new to the table. If you want a more compelling Metroidvania then i recommend something else. Incidentally, La-Mulana 2 came out on the same day as this so i recommend that over this.",1533034690,1617787812,False,23,2,0.477668225765228271,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 The gameplay is fun, it is not fast paced so anyone looking for a game where you can just annihilate hundreds of enemies in mere seconds should move on. The combat also isnt just hit and get hit till the enemy dies. It has a lot more of a strategic point where you need to really think your movements.
The death system is not too unforgiving, it really depends if you have saved your progress. If you just breeze through the game without trying to find an altar to save at,  you will lose all your progress. It really isn't that bad, I enjoy games having repercussions if you die because it forces you to think more when engaging enemies.

Avoiding death isn't especially hard, but healing items are rare to come by without grinding early enemies for them or spending a significant amount of gold. It's easy to run out of healing when exploring news areas, and backtracking to rooms with save/healing points is very unfun to me. Progression in the rest of the game so far hasn't felt rewarding or enjoyable enough to compensate for the slowness, so I'm not excited to play more of this game, and I find myself wanting to replay something like Rogue Legacy instead. Maybe I'd be more into Chasm if death kept map progress and/or items collected since the last save instead of obliterating all progress made.

I've followed development for a long time but never got a key until launch. 

This game is good. Not amazing, but good. Maybe very good. I do have some complaints. 

1. It's a rogue like, so if you die you lose progress. Keep this in mind. I just had to quit because I lost enough progress to make me annoyed so I need a break. 
2. It's VERY polished. AALLLLMMMOSSST too much. This is the type of game where you have to have virtually pixel perfect platforming. You need to learn where the hitbox for a platform ends, even though the graphic extends slightly beyond the hitbox. There were multiple jumps where I thought that I would need some kind of air dash or sprint and come back later... but I'd try again and watch the feet of my character and I made it. I find this pretty frustrating, even when I make it. I'm sure some people particularly long for that kind of thing, but it feels like a relic of SNES games I used to rent only once from Hollywood video to me.
3. It's a bit simplistic for me. Very solid game, but a bit simplistic. The type of game I can just blow through for 20-60 mins but besides the frustrations, it's a bit of a bland, samey experience so far. This might change, but even finding the first movement enhancing skill didn't change much IMO.

Overall, I enjoy it and recommend it for around $15, which is what I paid. If you particularly like roguelikes, $20 is probably fair. Otherwise, maybe pick it up at -20%+ off.

Pro: 
+ The artwork is awesome.
+ The music is good and non-intrusive.
+ It has the one-more-run feel.
+ Awesome developer.

Mid:
+- They may have been a bit too faithful to the Axiom Verge design - some of what I would consider to be its flaws seem to have been copied over. Others may disagree.
+- I intially found the character blur effect distracting but after some time you don't notice it at all. Nevertheless, it would have been nice if you could disable it.
+- The platforming mechanics need some time getting used to. Most of the games difficulty seems to lie here. For me it wasn't a smooth transition from other similar games.

Con: 
- The text font is hard to read so i just ended up skipping most of the text and dialogue. (EDIT: It seems to be more readable at low resolutions and in windowed mode)
- The combat isn't as fluid as I anticipated based on the design updates. The dungeon design is used to artificially make attacking enemies more difficult than it is (e.g. enemies appearing in narrow, no jump sections, holes, or hills). 
- The backward dash isn't as responsive as I would have wanted. You can't just use it, you need to plan to use it. EDIT: Backward dash seems to be a little more responsive now. 
- You make the most progress (e.g. by conserving health) when you just avoid troublesome enemies (e.g. mostly head level hovering enemies such as bats, jellyfish, wisp, etc.) and grind for experience on more straightforward enemies. Constantly avoiding enemies to make progress makes the game feel bland.
- The bosses project information on their attacks too early that it kills the thrill a bit.
- I have no problems backtracking in these types of games but on some levels backtracking can be really annoying, even when you've unlocked all the shortcuts.

Bugs:
- You're not shown on the map after you teleport.
- If you save the game while you're poisoned, you fully heal but the poison remains in effect. As you can heal yourself indefinitely until the poison wears off, there is no point in keeping the poison status after a save.

Verdict: Highly recommended to Axiom Verge fans. Caution to Guacamelee, Ori, Hollow Knight, Sundered, Dead Cells, etc. fans though at its price point it could be worth a try.",1533021859,1549924227,True,164,4,0.868020534515380859,0,True,False,False,False,,,

　進行が非常にスローテンポというか序盤からアドレナリンが出るようなポイントが著しく不在のゲーム。
　最初の攻撃手段は一種類しか攻撃モーションがなく、それもテンポがとてもいいとは言えない片手剣か素手のみ。
　初期アクションはバックダッシュとジャンプだけ。ガードやカウンターは（今のところ）なし。
　よって、戦闘はちょこまかジャンプして、ただ歩いてるか突進してくるだけの雑魚をジャンプで避けてからちまちまと殴る展開がしばらく続く。

　ある程度進んで武器が増えて斧・ハルバード・鞭・棍棒などが使えるようになっても、ゲームスタイルはそう多くは変わらなかった。武器はどれも攻撃モーションが一つだけだし、リーチが微妙に違う程度で、なんというか代わり映えしない。一応、防具やアクセサリといったものでステータスのどの部分を伸ばすかを選べはするが、武器攻撃・魔法攻撃・防御のどれを伸ばすかをちょっと考える程度で、これもプレイスタイルをガラッと変えるほどではないし、魔法については後述するアレな部分があるのでそこもしんどい。

　ほんの少し進んだところで魔法というかサブウェポンが使えるようになるが、このうち、「射程無限の水平射撃攻撃」とかいう文字に興しただけでクソ便利とわかってしまうMagicKnifeという魔法があり、ほとんどの雑魚はこれを遠距離から投げるだけで死ぬうえ、魔法のリソースは自然復活する、しかもそこらじゅうにある松明を壊すだけで無限に回収できるので、魔法というかナイフが強すぎてバランスがよろしくない。殴るよりナイフ投げる方が早くて強い。


　このダルさというかヌルさに耐えられない人とかはHollow knightとかDeadCellsやってたほうがいいんじゃないかなというか、序盤盛り上がらないゲームはそれだけで評価ガクっと落ちるのしょうがないと思う。
　この垢抜けない感じのドット絵とまったりしたプレイ速度に懐かしみを覚える懐古系の人なら手を出してもいいかしんないけど、正直近年のメトロイドヴァニアは飽和気味というか、強力なライバルが多すぎてこの程度のぬるーい作りだと太刀打ちできてない感じがすごい。

8 hrs in: I really thought I was going to love this.  I just assumed that like with most metroidvania style games that things just started slow and had something great to build to.  Playing Chasm I never felt there was anything truly rewarding in completing each challenge.  I never felt strong enough to take on the next area.  Screen swap farming seemed to drastically drop (if not completely remove) item drop chance.  Exp gains are so small that farming any particular mob for level gains just seems completely out of reach.  Getting a decent amount of gold seems impossible.  You never have enough gold for potions, or other support items.  I've played every Igavania there is and this game just falls short.

Yes this game is like SOTN if you took 75% of the equipment and items out of SOTN, removed unique button combos for special weapon moves and hidden spells, drop the 32-bit sprites down to 16-bit, take out all of the breakable wall secrets, remove all voiced dialog and have virtually no meaningful story progression cutscenes/dialog...  Really, if you took all of that away from SOTN then yes, Chasm is a lot like SOTN.

그만큼 첫인상이 중요한것이라 생각하기 때문이다.
삽기사가 너무 갓겜이었다... 그래서 인디게임을 보는눈이 높아졌는지 모르겠지만  
확실한건 이게임은 뭔가 시작한지 얼마 안됐지만 벌써부터 게임이 별로란걸 느낄수있다.

처음에 키설정 할때는 예를들어 점프가Z에있고 기술이C일때 점프를 C로 설정하려하면 지가알아서 서로바꾸지않고 중복키라고 안바뀌려고한다. 오늘 나온게임이면 이러면안되제!

게임을 시작하려하면 이지, 노말, 하드 세가지의 난이도가 보인다.
이것에대한 부가설명은 아무것도없다.
하드로 시작했는데 진행하고 있었는데 처음빼고 저장하는곳이 안보였는데 죽으면 자동저장으로 거기서부터시작인가? 하고 죽어봤으나 제일 처음 1레벨부터 시작인거다! 저장은 마법진같은곳 빼고는 존재하지않는거 같고.
아직 노말난이도는 안해봤지만 만일 하드난이도라서 세이브가 안나왔다는거면 부가설명도없이 이러는건 너무하지않나 싶다.
뭐 아직 자세히 모르니까 이건 거기까지하고 

처음에 얻는칼로 연속공격이나 다양한 공격자세같은건없고 서서베기, 앉아서베기, 점프해서베기 공격모션은 전부똑같다
심지어 메이플스토리도 단순공격할때 베는것과 찌르는게 있었다.

주인공은 첨부터 백대쉬를 쓸수있다.
근데 백대쉬를 쓸수있으면뭐함??
공격하다 중간에 캔슬하고 백대쉬를 쓸수있지않느냐?
천만에! 공격모션이 다끝나고 상대공격을 쳐맞은다음에 백대쉬를 쓰고있더라 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
백대쉬로 상대공격을 피하기위해선 공격을 미리 멈추고 써서 피해야하는데 그냥 공격을 멈추고 뒤로이동하는거랑 다를게 뭘까싶다...

처음에 나오는 몹은 짧은거리를 순찰구역을 돌아다닌다 .
그러면 그 순찰구역에서 조금만 벗어나도 절대로 맞을일이없다.
설령 몹이 내 코앞에있어도 몹은 내앞까지만온다.
뒤돌아본 몹을 때려도 그저 정해진 자기 순찰구역을 절대로 벗어나지않는다.
따로 공격모션도없고 부딫히는것으로 옛날 메이플스토리 몹마냥 공격한다.
그후로 나오는 박쥐나 쥐 몬스터는 전방에 주인공을 감지하면 달려드는데 그전까지 나오는 몹들은 목숨을 위협받아도 그냥 자기 순찰구역만 돈다.

결론 - 처음 시작하자마자 재미가 너무 없다. 공격은 단순하고 몹도 단순하고 백대쉬는 액션성이 1도없다. 제발 얼마 해보지도 않고 평가한다고 뭐라고 하지말자. 첫인상을 조지면 그거로 끝인거다.",1533019000,1533019671,False,19,0,0.594080567359924316,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I beat it, cover to cover. But it just has too many problems from the design up. 

tl;dr: The controls are deliberately stiff and the unique features of this game (random maps, etc) work against it rather than for it. 

The biggest problem this game has is the fact that the map is randomly generated, rather than hand-crafted. This leads to several issues. There are only a total of six unique areas in the game, and the last two you only ever need to go into once in the last hour or two of the game. So you'll be spending the majority of your time in the same four environments, constantly repeating. This makes things really confusing to navigate, as every room looks more or less like every other room. There are no landmarks or patterns that you can follow easily. This could have been fixed by having sub-areas, like having a section of the mine be covered in fungus, ore, or glowing rocks. Or if it was a different color. But this isn't the case. So it's very easy to get lost, and in a game that's primarily about navigation, this is a huge, huge detriment. The map doesn’t help this at all. The map is too minimalist for a game where it’s absolutely required, especially considering that because it’s random, there’s no intent, foreshadowing, etc. to follow. This makes the backtracking frustrating and tedious, since you’ll end up going to the wrong place. You can technically “mark” your map, but you can’t add any details or write notes on it, meaning that if there were two or three marked locations that are “towers”, you’ll likely end up having to go to all of them, since you can’t remember which one had what features. I don’t expect the game to add these details automatically, although many other games in the genre do, but even being able to write a little hand-written note on your map at areas so you could remember “I need to be able to double-jump or something to get up here” or “this area is flooded, so I need to be able to swim underwater to access it”, or even just “double-jump” and “underwater” would have been profoundly helpful.
 
This sort of flows into the second major issue, which is that navigation on a macro level is a pain, but on a micro-level it’s a nightmare. Enemies respawn any time you leave a room, and your ability to bypass them for most of the game is limited. Meaning you have to fight your way through every room every single time you need to go anywhere, and the maps are large. This is made all the more frustrating by the fact that you never really get anything that makes you faster. You gain certain movement abilities involving platforming, which allow you to bypass certain platform segments, but the most useful of these you don’t get until the absolute end of the game, by which point you barely need it. But it goes even further: The platforming sections in this game are quite demanding, and failure often means completely restarting the puzzle. These are sometimes almost pixel perfect, and the controls aren’t responsive enough to back it up. However, get gets so much worse once you start getting multiple abilities that involve platforming. I found the wall-jump to be the biggest problem, as you automatically cling to walls you’re jumping towards, and then immediately start sliding downwards. This means that if you fall into a pit filled with molten lava, for instance, trying to jump out will likely leave you clinging to the wall and jumping back into the lava, or sliding down into it. The sliding for wall-jumping, by the way, is literally never used and is a pointless feature. Your down-slide Megaman style is also nearly useless. It’s required for a few sections, but it’s an awkward length and never once does it go the distance you need in one shot. This is a minor issue but it’s one that could have been easily fixed by either changing the length of those walls, or changing the length of your slide. I’d recommend the latter, for reasons I’ll explain further below. You’ll run into the same issue with swimming. When you get the ability to swim underwater, you mysteriously lose the ability to swim on the surface, meaning that crossing large bodies of water is a huge chore. Thankfully this only comes up in a handful of areas, as water is rare, but it’s still an issue that could have been very easily fixed by having diving be assigned to the dodge button.
 
Speaking of “dodge”, the other reason why navigation point-to-point is a nightmare: The combat. The combat is so, so unfun. Your character purposefully has a huge delay after you swing your weapon, meaning any time you swing your sword, you’re left standing in place for half a second, making you vulnerable to attack. This is made doubly-damning by the fact that your weapon reach is usually abysmally short, meaning you have to get right up close to enemies, and then stand there after you swing while they react. The clever players will notice eventually that you have absolute complete control over your jump, meaning if you time it right, you can swing your sword and jump at the same time, allowing you to go in and out quickly, without having to deal with being stuck in place. I don’t know if this was by design, but based on how silly it looks with the sprites, I’m guessing no. However, because this is the best(well, second best, as you’ll soon discover), it means that almost every weapon is utter garbage. Fist-weapons and knives have too tiny a hitbox to take advantage of this, and heavy weapons, such as clubs, spears, two-handed swords are all too slow to pull it off easily. Their swing animation and recovery is also so long that the slight increase in damage is radically off-set by the amount of attacks you can get in. So swords are your only option, unless you’re lucky enough to find a whip that does enough damage at your level to justify using it. You can try using the weapons along with your dodge, which also has a strange delay on it, but the dodge is so short that I never once found it got me out of the way of an attack. And you’re not even invulnerable during it, at any point. You also can’t block, which for a game mimicking SotN so strongly, that seems like a weird oversight.
 
But all of that is negated by the fact that the melee weapons all suck compared to the best weapon in the game: The throwing knife. It’s a spell you can get very early that never stops being the most useful thing you own. For one MP it shoots a knife with unlimited range out directly in front of you, and you can shoot them very quickly if you hit your targets consistently. And until you hit over 30 intelligence, the damage is 1:1 with it, meaning if you get say the Onyx Ring early, you can be doing a huge amount of damage very quickly. Even better, you can upgrade the spell to throw two, and then three knives. This means that halfway through the game you’ll be throwing three knives for thirty damage each once per second. On larger enemies (like say, bosses), that’s 90+ damage per second. And because it has unlimited range, you can often kill enemies before they’ve even seen you. There are a few late-stage enemies that I don’t know anything about beyond what their death animation looks like. A few of the other spells are useful in some situations for similar reasons. The Shuriken goes up at a 45 degree angle, which is useful for some bosses. The barrier spell utterly wrecks the last boss. The Molotov is useful against enemies that like to block frequently. If this sounds really boring and sterile, that’s because it is. You end up fighting a lot of enemies, and they’re all boring as hell.

Tight platforming, combat feels nice. Slow start to get you used to the game, after an hour or so the game starts opening up, the enemies become more interesting and you get more options in combat and movement.

The game looks great: good looking, non-lazy pixel art. All enemies look visually striking, and the levels don't feel or look procedurally generated most of the time.
I'll admit I haven't paid much attention to the music, but at least it's not grating right? What I've noticed seems fun and has a retro style.

So far, it's fun. I can't imagine the rest of the game getting worse; it keeps expanding further in terms of gameplay options and exploration.",1533015142,1533015413,True,4,0,0.510261178016662598,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Since that time (possibly due to pressure from the community) the developers have made numerous alterations (some say improvements, others argue otherwise) and I no longer know if this review can be considered accurate. Upon official release of the game, the forum was flooded with a myriad of complaints from players incapable of grasping some very simple concepts such as patience, exploration, back tracking and even practice itself (trying a jump more than three times). Revisions of the game immediately followed which included such things as puzzles being dumbed down, platform locations being shifted, and many combat and statistic changes, just to name a few. Personally, I think the game was fine as it was and did not need half of the changes that have been implemented. Please take this review with a grain of salt as it may potentially be completely outdated and/or obsolete.

---------

Chasm is an old style Metroidvania game that doesn't hold your hand. It has a number of different areas to platform and fight your way through, each with its own unique and beautifully crafted visuals, enemies and music. Combat is simple yet challenging, requiring a different tactical approach for almost every enemy in the game, but not taking long hours to master. Each area holds its own little secrets and puzzles, and comes complete with unexplorable areas that must be returned to later on.

Armour, accessories and weapons are plentiful, allowing for custom equipment choices and catering to a number of preferences in play style; keep your enemies at a distance with whips, or get up close and personal with short range, deadly knives. You even have a number of different spells at your disposal with which to dispatch the ever respawning monsters that stand in your way.

As you progress through the game, you will have the opportunity to acquire not only pages from books to reveal the history and lore of the game's world, but abilities that will both aid in your movement around the environment and allow access of previously unreachable locations.

Chasm has spent a few years in the making and that time has served it well. The beautiful and detailed pixel art is a timeless classic aesthetic and fitting homage to classic games of this genre. The music is easy to listen to and does not distract from the gameplay, instead, each score compliments its respective area and enhances the experience of being there. The areas themselves are extensive, but not overly so, and are procedurally generated using a large selection of rooms that prevent passing through them from becoming dull, repetitive and ""samey"". The environment itself is highly detailed and beautifully crafted, from a rocky mine to a lush, overgrown, underground garden, and even an old, ruined keep. There's plenty to see and do in Chasm, and just as much replayability. Challenge yourself to play a different way, or just do it all again to see a different layout of each area. You can even share your map seeds with friends and other Chasm players to share the experience of a specific layout.


And now for the negatives; there aren't many, but they should be touched on none-the-less.

The early stages of the game can be brutal and even frustrating at times, especially if you're not a particularly skilled gamer. Enemies hit hard and although they can be dodged with relative ease, it's inevitable that you will be tagged. Now, you might not think this much of a problem, but save rooms (which fully heal you) in Chasm are set far apart and in the earliest stages of the game, healing items can be scarce to almost non-existent. Dying early on will likely see you lose a good bit of progress if those hits manage to pile up, and with enemies respawning every time you enter a room, this can make going backwards to a known ""safe point"" just as dangerous as going forward into the unknown hoping to find another such life saver just on the next screen, especially if your life points are already dangerously low.

This becomes less of an issue as you get further into the game when you are eventually able to buy health potions and have probably picked up better armour. In fact, towards the late stages of the game, you might just find yourself caring less and less about those occasional taggings as you start to be able to just tank your way through even boss fights by chugging health potions and shrugging off damage dealt with your armour. This can be both a good thing or a bad thing depending on the type of late game experience you want. Some people prefer to retain the high danger challenge throughout the entirety of a game, while some enjoy the sense of growing stronger as they progress. Either way, you still can't ignore enemies entirely; becoming too reckless, no matter how much defence and health potions you have, can still see you meet your untimely demise.

The controls are very generous and lenient, allowing total control during jumps and falling, and feel smooth and fluid. You'll no doubt become accustomed to leaping through rooms with precision and confidence quickly, but in the later part of the game you'll gain an ability that will give you cause to readjust your parkouring manoeuvres. It's not a particularly bad thing, but it can be a bit of a curve-ball to those not expecting it and will take just a little getting used to, forcing the player to once again pay closer attention to their movement about the environment.

The only other negative I can think of is the drop rate. Almost every enemy has a couple of different items they drop, including weapons, armour and even quest items. On the one hand, the high number of enemies you will be leaving bursting into little flames on the floor would leave you with a very full and annoying inventory to go through if the drop rate was higher, but on the other hand, the low drop rate makes farming for specific items tedious and slow.

Overall, Chasm is a great casual game to play, and even something more dedicated if you choose to challenge Mortal(permadeath) mode. A lot of time and love went into the making of this game and it truly shines through. Despite the few negatives, as a whole, Chasm is a great and fun game to play and shouldn't be passed up by fans of the Metroidvania genre. If you want a challenging platformer with plenty of places to explore and lots of ways to slaughter monsters, I strongly recommend giving it a go.

After a dozen hours or so, here are some final thoughts (as a backer, I was given access a day early):

World Design: Chasm makes use of procedural generation for part of its world design, and while it does show, the repeated rooms and layouts don't become monotonous. Unlike a recent title I've been playing (Enter the Geungeon), Chasm doesn't make the same mistake of copy and pasting the same enemies to said rooms. That being said, there isn't much in the way of puzzles in the overworld, which is pretty disappointing. Also, there is very little to no interactions with the environment. There are dissovling platforms, but I would have wished for some more offensive tools the player could make use of. Also, while I did enjoy combing through previous dungeons after acquiring some powers, the map marker is a pretty pool tool in that you are not able to clear the markers unless you happen to be in the exact room where you first placed it. I would have liked the map to highlight certain ""special"" rooms that require certain keys to make backtracking less tedious.

Enemy Design: Easily my favorite aspect of this game. There is a plethora of enemies in Chasm, each with their own unique behaviors and looks. There is very little re-skinning to see be seen here and, at least for me, was a great driving force in my will to continue playing. I loved learning the tells, and attack patters of the regular enemies as well as the bosses. I played the game on Hard and I was encouraged to learn the enemy's patterns to succeed.

Itemization: Pretty disappointed to say that any loot you find and equip does not change your avatar's appearance, HOWEVER, weapons & upgrade rank are represented visually, which is much appreciated. A fire sword will have a red slash, a poisonous dagger will have a green slash, an upgraded Knife attack will have more momentum, etc. Given that there isn't a considerable amount of loot, it really begs the question why the team didn't make the effort (budgest constraing methinks). Regardless, not a big deal for me anyway, I place far more importance on the enemy variety.

Performance: The game ran flawlessfy for me, and I saw no real bugs or issues. However, I do find it highly questionable that environmental hazards DO NOT affect your enemies, even if they stupidly rush past you and fall into a lazer field, or a of lava. This inconsistency bothered me some, but not much.

Skill Progression: Again, Chasm is much more combat oriented, than puzzle oriented so most of the skills aren't super major in progressing in the game. I don't believe you ever need all of the skills to beat the game at all. Maybe there was some cut content that was meant to use some of these items (swimming gear, parachute) but I think the game would have been just fine without them.

Combat Mechanics: I definitely think that Chasm has a solid foundation for future titles. There is a committment to swinging blades that I really like. You have to be careful when you decide to attack sine some enemies relaliate quite quickly. Or you could level up your play and learn the jump+land double strike combo! I also appreciate the variety of attack animations, larger weapons have greater vertical reach, combared to the basic horizontal swing of the sword. This definitely helped my strategy in taking out the final boss, or enemies who happned to be above me. I never found much utlility in knives since they demand that you be extremely close to enemies. Also, I tend to not bother with most magic systems since I like getting in close and learning enemy behaviors.

Conclusion: While I was a bit down on the game at first, I'm happy to say that I had a great time with Chasm and found in it a pleasurable title that follows in the footsteps of the classic Igavanias. Speaking of which, I think it's high time I started Order of Ecclesia.

I’ve been fortunate enough to have played *many* versions of the game along the path of its development. It’s true the game missed deadlines; but if the phrase “worth the wait” ever applied, it applies to CHASM.

I don’t want to spoil the wonder and surprise of the game. The Metroidvania adventure and exploration. The lore. The heart. The crafting, combat, incredible art. It all adds up to a true indie gem, and one I’m thrilled to be able to support.
