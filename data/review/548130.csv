My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707171890,1707171890,True,2,0,0.533100366592407227,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Amaç, çeşitli gemilere pilotluk yaparken onları renklendirerek monokromatik düşmanlara karşı savunmaktır.

İşte Scribble Ships'in bazı önemli yönleri:

    Gemi Çeşitliliği: Oyuncular, her biri kendine özgü güçlü ve zayıf yönlere sahip beş farklı oynanabilir gemi arasından seçim yapabilirler. Bu gemiler farklı oyun deneyimleri sunarak oyuncuların tercih ettikleri oyun tarzını bulmalarını sağlar.

    Özel Gemi Yapıcı: Daha da fazla özgürlük isteyenler için oyunda oyun içi özel gemi yapımcısı bulunuyor. Oyuncular kendi gemilerini çizip yaratarak oyun deneyimlerine kişisel bir dokunuş katabilirler.

    Düşmanlar ve Patronlar: Scribble Ships, oyuncuların becerilerini ve reflekslerini test etmek için sekiz düşman türü ve beş zorlu patron sunar. Oyuncular daha zorlu düşmanlarla karşılaştıkça oyun giderek zorlaşan bir deneyim sunuyor.

    Küresel Liderlik Tabloları: Oyuncular küresel liderlik tablolarına tırmanarak dünya çapındaki diğer oyuncularla rekabet edebilirler. Bu özellik oyuna rekabetçi bir unsur katarak oyuncuları yüksek skorlar için çabalamaya ve arkadaşlarının başarılarını geçmeye teşvik ediyor.

İncelemede oyunun elle çizilmiş grafikleri, keyifli müzikleri, ilgi çekici oynanışı ve özel gemiler yaratabilme özelliği sayesinde tekrar oynanabilirliğinin yüksek olması gibi birçok olumlu yönünden bahsedildi. Oyunun uygun fiyatlı olması da olumlu bir faktör olarak vurgulandı.

Bununla birlikte, incelemede, işbirliğine dayalı çok oyunculu modun olmaması, sınırlı silah çeşitliliği ve daha çeşitli arka planlar arzusu gibi birkaç olumsuzluk da tespit edildi. Bu eleştirilere rağmen, oyunun genel izlenimi son derece olumluydu ve incelemeyi yapan kişi oyunun eğlenceli ve bağımlılık yapıcı doğasından duyduğu heyecanı dile getirdi.

Sonuç olarak, Scribble Ships benzersiz sanat tarzı, çeşitli gemileri ve zorlu düşmanları ile renkli ve kaotik bir arcade atış deneyimi sunuyor. Sıradan oyunlardan hoşlanan oyuncular için keyifli ve tekrar oynanabilir bir deneyim sağlıyor. Uygun fiyatı ve güncelleme potansiyeli ile oyun, Slothzilla Games tarafından geliştirilen eğlenceli ve ilgi çekici bağımsız bir oyun arayanlar için tavsiye edilir.",1688892240,1688892240,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Suggestions to creators to make this game even better:

- Add a (ctrl+z) undo feature when making custom ships, because missing by a pixel when you've been trying to draw a cool thing for 10 minutes and then having the entire thing get washed out in the wrong color is a huge letdown.
- Allow more precise drawing with smaller brushes.
- A gallery of custom ships you can trade with other players.
- When we reach certain scores or find ""rare drops"" from kills, let us collect them to pump up custom ships, so they don't all end up the same stats.
- Or at the very least, give us some of this customization stuff as a modest DLC. lol",1529738565,1529738801,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But my refund didn't go through and the game was fun enough to try again when I saw there was an update. I'm glad I gave it another shot! It's a lot slower-paced than other shoot-'em-ups but still pretty exciting because of the way every shot counts. The bosses that show up every once in a while are also fun and unique for this type of game. It's really a nice change of pace from similar shooters.

A few flaws in no particular order though:

1. The create-a-ship thing doesn't let you choose your ship's build. It's always a light-weight fast ship that dies in one hit. This is especially important to note because it means the game's main selling point is kind of misleading. 
2. It's okay to have a ship that's slower than the other ships for balance, but the Hake is so incredibly slow that certain bosses are basically impossible unless you luck out and pick up enough movement speed boosts that you can take them down. This is compounded by the fact that additional firepower upgrades aren't actually that great on the Hake past level 3; it just gives you a weird spread-shot that's oddly useless in this game.
3. When the Leviathan shows up the game slows down to the point of basically stopping completely, for a moment. This has also happened for me against late-game bosses, probably thanks to the number of other enemies around at the same time.
4. The game may not crash during play anymore, but it does sometimes crash in the little doodle program where you draw your own ship.
5. There's no sound when a power-up appears, and you can sometimes kill off-screen enemies, meaning that essential upgrades can disappear before you even know they ever existed.
6. Homing missiles sometimes pass right through enemies.

Overall it's a nice little score-chaser, and none of that ruins the game for me so I'll go ahead and give it the thumbs up... But, buyer beware.",1500631102,1546371770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay is very odd, it starts mind numbingly slow and then becomes very fast paced. The difficulty seems to lie in a manic flurry of enemies and random movements rather than strategy. When I succeeded it felt like luck not accomplishment. Within 15 minutes I had a top 17 in the world score.

The game drops you in without any explanation. You get points for killing enemies (I think?) but you can also pick up colored orbs for extra points. There are a handful of powerups but I was again unsure what they did. One with 3 colored balls made me shoot more but was time limited? A shield which lets me take an extra hit and lasts until damaged. Rocket which turns your bullets into rockets, and maybe there was another one?  At the top of the screen there is a bar that you fill and as you do your weapon seemingly increases power but its so obtuse I hardly noticed anything happening until I looked for it. You also have a ""boost"" which powers you through enemies. I seems like the type of attack that would work well for the slower stat ships. I'm not sure why each ship doesnt have a different special power.

For no reason what so ever you can draw your own ship. Neat. But you can't customize your ship in any way other than appearance. You have a set of stats for each ship but they are locked even for a custom ship. 

As one of the other reviews said this feels like a college project. Its seemingly well made (except for not having Steam Overlay and crashing every time I tried to exit.) I just found it lacking any depth and fun. As a proof of concept or an alpha this product is solid enough to show investors and devs to continue work. As a finished game it feels hollow and 1 dimensional.

I will go through and list the positives and and negatives I found after playing this game for about an hour or so, a grain of salt is not provided but feel free to take one if you need to.

Graphics: 8  What do you expect, it's hand drawn on crumpled notebook paper and then animated! The kind of crap we dreamed of doing in Jr. High or High School. 

Sound: 8 It is a light blippy and bubbly soundtrack and though I reside on the dark side of the spectrum, I can't help but wiggle and dance just a little bit from the overflowing and overwhelmingly happy music.  The sound effects are equally as happy and add to the overall experience.  I was expecting pew pew pew and got bloop bloop bloop.  

Gameplay: 9  This is a top down shooter like Asteroids or Space Invaders.  I can see this becoming engrossing and completely addictive if you have a weakness for casual games.  While the gameplay isn't super face melting fast paced by any means, it is extremely anxiety inducing once you get passed The Leviathon boss.  

Replayability: 10  So it is permadeath in the sense you only get one, maybe two chances if you have a shield.  The ability to custom create your own scribble ship allows you to play the same ""map"" over and over again and each play through is completely different.  

So here come the negatives that I found.  
-No coop multiplayer.  Couch coop for this game would make it 10x better!  
-Not enough variety of weapons: This game needs paint cluster bombs, paint (flame) thrower, proximity mines, paint lasers, something...you get your basic bloop bloop gun and some targeting paint missles but in the hour or so I played the weapons are just more of the same, but faster.  
-More backgrounds needed.  I love the fact that when you ""destroy"" a ship with your paint guns, it is added to the paper background you are playing on.  This only looks so cool for so long...variety is the spice of life.  I would love to see a few more notebooks or desks or tables etc added as backgrounds.  Maybe a bathroom stall wall or something :D 

Overall Impression: HELL YES! for under $5 you get a casual game that keeps your interest, supports independent devs, and is an amazingly fun experience.  I look forward to seeing if the devs keep this game fresh and new feeling with updates.  Will this be my main game with 100s of hours, probably not.  Will this be a game I fall back on when other servers are down or when I am feeling casual. Oh yes! This has the potential to be a huge black hole of time, in the most positive sense of the phrase :D
