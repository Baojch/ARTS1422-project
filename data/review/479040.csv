Also I suggest you don't Alt Tab because sometimes it freezes and won't put you back in BUT also acts like your mouse is still in game which can be hard to close the game or really do anything else because... the mouse is locked in a full screen game thats frozen.

There are 2 levels where you have to make some sort of weird bridge to get across, but you have half the area to do it. These were the levels that took me the longest to figure out and one of them was pretty much luck on the physics/gravity.

The setting, a visually simplified, plotless, Portal-esqe environment, isn't all that spectacular, especially with the issues I had that made water textureless and glitchy. The music is uninteresting and a bit hard to listen to after a while. With the later levels, I never felt like I solved them in the intended way. I would usually either solve an area in 2 or 3 placements, skipping large sections, or spend long periods of time fighting the game's physics to try and get pieces to behave correctly. Even once I knew a solution to an area it would often take several attempts to get it to work. I'd much rather play a game were the time is spent solving puzzles rather than wrestling with seemingly inconsistant physics. Some of the controls seem over complicated - after returning to the game after a few months was unable to remember or figure out how to solidify a piece (you hover your cursor over the piece, hold q, left click, then press e). This was further complicated by the lack of a control menu in the game's settings, and while it was mentioned 2 years ago it was in the works, there isn't much indication of dev support since then. 

I don't think Metamorphic is a bad game, but I didn't really enjoy it, particularly the last few levels, primarily due to puzzle design.

I really tried to enjoy it. But, well, I guess it's too much. I liked music, a lot of visual elements that were borrowed from Portal series.

First issue I had with it -- mechanics offer some interesting ideas, whole gameplay is somehow alike Portal, Grappling Hook (small portal-like indie game, it's pretty much alike it in visual style as well) and Antichamber. I don't have anything against core gameplay and mechanics, but level design is just... ugh. It feels like levels were built not around mechanics, but more around unexpected ""tricks"", so it feels more like bug abuse.

Altho, it's not the main problem. The game is still great and I'd like to say that it's around 7.5/10, but it's unplayable. I've completed around 10 levels out of 12-16 (can't remember actual numbers, but the idea is that I was close to the end) and on every level (except the first one) I've had an issue in every room. Starting from lost blocks, inability to get them in my ""gun"", ""flying"" around and not dying to water and ending with dead black screen. The reason why I abandoned this game is pretty sad: I ended up with black screen every time I started my last level. I tried it on another machine and it seems like these issues aren't exclusive to my configuration. I'd not recommend to buy and play it right now, but I hope that these issues will be fixed soon.

White blocks stay where you place them, green blocks fall down unless there's something solid underneath them, red blocks rise up unless there's something solid above them.

I like this genre. I've played several excellent games, including the Portal series, Talos Principle, Qube and Qbeh. Unfortunately, Metamorphic is a terrible game, and I regret buying it. I was actually close to refunding it, but I could see there weren't many levels remaining, so I thought I might as well finish it.

It only took me 3 hours to finish the game, which is far too short. Puzzle games will usually give you some basic puzzles to introduce the key concepts, and then build the difficulty up with increasingly more complex puzzles. Metamorphic gives you a few basic puzzles, and then just when you feel like you're ready to tackle the more complex stuff, its all over. You'd probably expect to see lots of puzzles where the solution requires you to use the different coloured blocks together in interesting ways, but I only remember that happening a couple of times.

Most of the time the solutions are pretty obvious, but the thing that slows you down is the physics. These blocks have curved edges, so they tend to move around when you stand on them. It can get a bit frustrating when you've built a structure that should allow you to cross a gap or reach a ledge, and then just as you're about to do the final jump, the whole thing collapses and you have to rebuild it.

The control system is ridiculous. To place blocks you first have to left click to place an outline, then hold Q and left click again to select the outlined blocks, and then press E to make them solid. That's right, you have to press 3 different buttons to place a block. Maybe its a good thing that the game was short, because that's quite annoying. Also, you can't change any of the key bindings. On a PC game in 2016. This is unacceptable. Furthermore, there's a post on the forum dated 9th July where the developer says key rebinding will be added in a couple of days. Its now December, so that was a lie.

Finally, this game is SO buggy. Here's a list of all the bugs I encountered in my 3 hours of gameplay.
- On the first green block puzzle, I initially couldn't figure out how to place the blocks. They were just outlines that I couldn't stand on. After consulting a Youtube video, it turns out a tutorial message was supposed to pop up on screen to explain the controls. It never appeared for me, even though ""show tutorials"" was definitely ticked in the options menu.
- Every time (and I mean, literally, EVERY time) I finished a level and was walking towards a train that takes you to the next level, the game would freeze for a second while it loaded in the next area. All forward movement stopped, and I had to release and repress the W key to carry on walking. I remember a similar bug happening in another game recently (it might have been Killing Floor 2?) and it was patched within a day.
- On two occasions near the end of the game, after I died and respawned, I was unable to collect or place blocks. It was like the game had stopped responding to mouse clicks. I had to quit to the main menu and reload the level.
- After the end credits finished and I returned to the main menu, the mouse cursor was gone and I couldn't interact with any options, including the one to close the game. I had to kill the game on the task manager. It actually seemed quite fitting that my very last experience in this game would be a bug.

Jene haben je nach Farbe andere Eigenschaften und Möglichkeiten des Einsatzes.

Die Performance ist gut, selbst auf altersschwachen PCs, wegen der Struktur beim Levelaufbau (Quader halt, damit viele vertikale und horizontale Linien) sind hier Mängel beim Vsync oft recht unansehnlich, was ich hier allerdings nicht bemerkt habe. Das Optionsmenü ist relativ spartanisch.

Musik und Sounds sind unaufdringlich, wenn auch das knistern der ""Schilde"" auf Dauer nerven kann.

Ansonsten ist das Handling manchmal ein wenig mit Feingefühl verbunden, aber funktional.

The puzzles are completely different though.

You're provided with a fixed number of cubes for each room. There are 3 types: white/sticky (remain anchored in place) in the early game; green/normal in mid/late game; red/helium in late game. Just when you're getting used to one type you get a new one and have to change your thinking so the game stays fresh throughout.

You build structures to help you climb up or bridge gaps to reach the exit and you often have to think of a way to transfer the cubes past a screen before you can start construction. The unique feature here is that the structures you build are physics-based so they can lean in corners, anchor into holes, roll around, collapse, fall etc. all of which a) can be used to solve the puzzles and b) can scupper what you thought was a solid bridge. Some levels have mixtures of white/green/red which you have to use together for the solution.

A common scenario I found myself in was thinking I had the right solution but couldn't quite make it work, for example the jump was just a little bit too far, so I would try nudging the structure a bit or keep trying the jump over and over... then eventually realise that if I changed the structure a bit it became much easier. The physics encourages you to poke things around to try and make it work. I remember at one point thinking it was like trying to manhandle a big sofa up a stairwell but without the sweat (the same amount of swearing though).

[h1]Things I really enjoyed[/h1]

Not having to boot into horrid MS Windows.

The satisfying fffffftttt noise when collecting cubes, especially when ""hoovering up"" multiple cubes.

The scope of the puzzles. There are 4 aspects to every solution: a) finding the exit (not always obvious), b) devising a solution, c) executing it - this can involve a controlled topple, time-sensitive build etc and d) travelling it - you often need to be very nimble and sometimes you have to make a dash/jump for it before your structure collapses! The green/red structures are cylindrical and I've slipped off more than a few times.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

There were a few easy levels that I got straight away but most involved varying degrees of head-scratching and a few were rage-inducing (in a good way). There was only one puzzle I gave up on and Youtubed the answer, but even when you know the solution it often takes multiple attempts to construct and travel it. There can be more than one way to solve the puzzles due to the physics.

[h1]Length[/h1]

There are 16 levels with an average 3 puzzles per level, so around 50 puzzles total. There's talk by other reviewers about completing the game in 3-5 hours but I have to say I'm dubious. I got a good 15 hours out of it.

[h1]Performance[/h1]

My specs: Ubuntu 16.04, i7 with 8Gb RAM and midrange nVidia graphics. Apart from the occasional glitch (see below) it was smooth and responsive. I encountered none of the performance issues reported in another review here.

[h1]Minor annoyances[/h1]

- Fullscreen only, no window mode.
- No controller option.
- Some minor glitches: on rare occasions the cube frame disappears so you can't see where you're placing it; I once had a glitch where my right-click action stopped working. In both cases quitting to main menu fixed it.
- No trading cards (yet) and only one achievement.

[h1]Medium annoyance[/h1]

Some areas of rooms are too dark to see anything, especially in daylight. In retrospect these are always dead/unimportant areas, but especially in early game I kept wondering if a crucial element of the solution was hidden there.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

I highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of Portal or Q.U.B.E. then this is a must-buy. Watch out for the final puzzle if you suffer from vertigo!

The controls feel incredibly sluggish. Looking around feels ""off,"" as if there's mouse acceleration, and movement is fairly floaty. Passing through a doorway causes the game to grind to a halt for a second to load the next area - not necessarily a huge issue, except once the loading is done, it eats your inputs. Every single time you pass into or out of an area, you find yourself not moving anymore, you need to let go of W and press it again. Checking for your inputs after a loading screen is basic stuff, and combined with the slow movement speed, it just eats away at one's nerves.

All of that could be forgiven if the puzzles were good. They're not. The very mechanics of the game are bad, to the point where I don't actually know how you're intended to solve half of them (I managed to exploit almost all of them - we'll come back to that). The game starts off with you placing and removing blocks to platform, basic stuff, but satisfying. Before the game does anything interesting with a mechanic, about a fifth of the way into the game, the entire concept of placing blocks is completely abandoned until the very end.

The majority of the game is spent using green ""blocks."" The gimmick here is that you can't actually interact with the blocks, but turn any collection of your placed blocks into pipes. This is where the entire premise of the game falls apart - the pipes themselves are subject to physics, making them completely unreliable. And the game expects you to rely on them. You need to make pipe bridges and cross them, without them falling over, or bugging out and falling over, or without you sliding off. You need to jump up pipe pillars without them toppling, or without them bugging out and toppling, or without you sliding off. Making pipes and pushing them around is a major mechanic here (I think), but pushing them is a trial of misery. It's a physics-based puzzle game where you have little control over the physics.

In one level, I made a seesaw with an L-shaped pillar at one end. It was perfectly balanced. Apparently the player has no weight, so it was stuck. Until I pushed the pillar at the end, at which point that side sunk down. I was pushing the thing I was standing on and moving it around. Because physics.

Towards the end of the game - I'd say the final fifth - you get the ability to place antigravity pipes, which are exactly the same, but they go up. Quite frankly, this is the only point where the pipes came close to being enjoyable - the fact that you could use them as elevators made them much easier to work with, and there were some good ideas involving using both sets of pipes. Ideas that would have worked MUCH better if they were blocks, or if they had at least followed less realistic physics that followed more predictable rules.

There's also another white blocks section thrown in the middle of the red pipe section, as if the developer suddenly remembered they had them in the game. I believe there is only a single puzzle in the ""green section"" that had white blocks, and it only had a single one. There's basically no puzzles in the game that actually take advantage of combining the white squares with the pipes - presumably because they'd be too easy to exploit. This game is actually terrified of letting you ""cheat"" - you can't jump and place a block under you, nor can you peek over the edge of a block to place a new block there. Abilities that are arguably as standard as jumping, and the game restricts them. Which, like before, wouldn't be a problem if the solutions to the puzzles were logical - but I don't have the slightest idea how you're ""expected"" to solve most of them. I ended up solving most of them by cheesing them, sliding pipes into awkward positions and making tight jumps, often ignoring most of the space I was given to work with.

Were those actually the intended solutions? Possibly. But while it can be liberating to solve a puzzle in a way the game didn't intend for, it's not really gratifying when it doesn't feel like there was ever actually an intended solution. Ultimately, the real crime here is that the game takes away player freedom to prevent players from breaking the game, yet the game is still easy to break, so what was even the point?

And a minute to talk about the final ""puzzle"" (if you're willing to call it that). You have to build an elevator to go up a long tunnel. So, naturally, the game gives you tons of antigravity blocks... and green blocks, and even white blocks. Why? Are they useful here? Am I missing something? So I made an elevator, and it immediately went topsy-turvy. I guess your player model actually does have weight. I made an elevator with railings, and made it a bit higher before falling out... just before the elevator passed through the ending trigger and disappeared, taking its precious blocks with it. By the way, the game has no save feature, you need to exit to the menu and reload whenever something like that happens.

Brief mentions about bugs: aside from the physics being terrible and the loading being a pain, I've had pipes spontaneously jump into the air upon placement for no reason, I've had the ability to construct pipes completely disappear and require a restart, I've fallen through the world (and as far as I was willing to check, there's no killplane down there), and been able to grab blocks through the phase fields when you're not supposed to. Also, if you press the mouse buttons during the credits, you can hear the sound effects of your gun. (Speaking of which, the train in this game has the goofiest and least-fitting sound effect ever).

Oh, and the puzzles in the second and fourth-to-last screenshots don't seem to be in the game.

This perhaps became more of a rant than a review, but I was extremely disappointed by this game.

[h1]TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION![/h1]

Metamorphic is a first person puzzle platformer inspired by games like Q.U.B.E. and Portal. I’m a big fan of puzzle games, and I was thoroughly pleased with the puzzle gameplay in Metamorphic. Each puzzle chamber is unique, and designed well. There are different coloured blocks with different properties. You absorb the blocks with your gun, and you shoot them back out to place them almost anywhere you want, except on the dark blocks. You can walk through the green, and red blocks until you transform them into solid objects.

After I had finished a couple of the puzzles, I realized that I was doing the puzzle the WRONG way, or at least not the way it was intended, but hey, it still worked! Metamorphic reminds me a lot of Q.U.B.E. with its style, and gameplay. Although Metamorphic has fewer puzzle mechanics than Q.U.B.E. does, I found the gameplay was more satisfying, less twitch oriented, and seemingly more flexible in how you go about solving some of the puzzles.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list][*]puzzles are fun, and enjoyable; some are easier than others, but it gets more challenging as the game progresses - a few of the puzzles took a while to figure out, but it never felt frustrating
[*]some of the puzzles seem to have more than one way you can solve them, and that is something that was nice to see
[*]soundtrack is good, and it didn't feel repetitive
[*]the colours, and lightning are done very well, and the voxel-based environments are elegant (especially the vibrant red, and green)[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list][*]some sound effects are a bit loud by default, but there's a separate volume slider to adjust it, so it's not a big deal
[*]there's no story or narrative (similar to how Q.U.B.E. was when it first launched)[/list]

Metamorphic doesn’t NEED a narrative, and the game is enjoyable, and worth playing without it. However, if a narrative ever got added in the future, I would absolutely play it again, just like I did with the Q.U.B.E. Director’s Cut version.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
The game took me about 3 - 3.5 hours to complete, and like most linear puzzle games, there’s not much replay value once you finish it, unless you want to speedrun it. If you’ve enjoyed the gameplay in similar puzzle platformer games like Q.U.B.E. or Portal, you will most likely enjoy Metamorphic as well. It’s a solid puzzle game, and definitely worth playing.
