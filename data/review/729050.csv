I felt like I was on the holodeck playing the 24th century classic game.

Solo was fun to practice but the game is even better with friends.

I recommend this game to anyone who plays VR. Try playing with fruit or other nontraditional balls.

There is some glitchiness when you start a level where the leaderboard is visible. The menu is also quite sensative to touch. Overall though it felt really nice.",1520142137,1520142137,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,True,False,,,

You use the Sun as the white ball and pull back and aim for shots.

Has single player where you try and sink as many planets in the least shots and multiplayer but as with many MP VR games it's an empty server list and will probably stay that way as a Large glassed flamboyantly dressed gay man once sang ""It's lonely out in space"". Has the option against AI but that grows stale real fast, faster than a fart in an Astronauts  space suit


Not the most fun I have had playing with balls and seems a little expensive at $4.99 more of an under $2.00 game or bought in a bundle. Might help to get some MP action going at that price.

As Neil Armstrong famously said ""if you fart in outer space does anybody hear you scream""",1519006621,1519006695,False,5,1,0.457143872976303101,0,False,True,True,False,,,

It is a a unique 3D pool experience that needs to be in every social vr setting. The controls are smooth. I thought it would be confusing to line up shots, but the interaction with the balls is so natural. I also like how you can interact with the table, it is nice to feel in control of your shot. Very interesting to watch the other player fly around with their jet packs. I can only imagine how I must look.  Playing multiplayer is a blast! I love pool, and It is really inspiring to see this on steam. I can't wait for the active user count to go up so I can play more multiplayer!",1517036602,1517036602,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,True,False,,,
