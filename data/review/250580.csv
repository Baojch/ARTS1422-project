Hell, if what chances are it's more known as the game taken down for it's dev cursing at and threatening Gabe Newell on social media, resulting in the title being taken off Steam for some time, than it's actual merits.

Now, first thing first, as far as unappealing blocky visual styles go, this game takes the cake with really rough pseudo-voxel enemy designs and UI, and level design even more angular - while it tries to be an arena shooter, like Quake of sorts, with lots of projectiles to dodge, the individual areas are way too small and primitive to fully capitalize on this. One thing that redeems style and levels is dynamic lights that indeed look neat and distinct but that's it.

Now, the gameplay, it's pretty predictable roguelite as genre is established meets arena FPS faire, with the roguelike bit sometimes offering interesting gimmicky pickups but too often boild down to flat bonuses to stats, like max lives or whatnot, whereas the FPS kinda suffers from enemy AI being primtiive and simple, running circles is always enough to deal with most threat and the failures usually happen due to fire density getting too high for you to deal with, so the main skill here is dodging, not much space for buildcrafting, most playtroughs feel quite similar as a result.

Just... was nice for it's time but now there's so many more titles with a better sense of how to make something a roguelite, and even more titles that are just fun simple singleplayer shooter so this comes off weak.",1708638210,1708638210,False,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Rule number one is that if the first 40 minutes are filled with me wanting to do anything else with my time, I don't continue. Rule number two is that I don't like spending money on games that aren't finished. Paranautical Activity met both rules.

This game is an ancient relic from a time when the indie world was dominated by people who wanted to be the next Spelunky  or Binding Of Isaac. Compared to both its classic and modern contemporaries, it is sorely outdated and is blatantly an unfinished product sans the early access tag that should be on the storepage. The whole game feels like a pre-alpha that lacks polish.

As documented pretty extensively in other reviews, the developer of this game was not a nice man, stiffing his composer and saying that he would personally kill Gabe Newell because Steam accidentally put it in Early Access when it should have been full release (although this game deserves to still be in the former.) The developer also advertised and promised features that never came to the game, and now will never come to the game due to its unsupported nature. Hilariously, the game still advertises potential VR support in the menu. However, beneath all the controversy, there is a game, and it's not very good.

I don't actually believe this game is finished despite the storepage saying otherwise. Combat is very bland; you have one weapon that you'll be firing over and over and an alternative weapon that, depending on your luck and starting gear, ranges from situational to near worthless. All of the different areas of the game make make minor aesthetic changes every now and then, but they are still mostly gray boxes with the same few room layouts scrambled together. How far your run goes depends heavily on luck. You can get a powerful weapon for free in the first floor, or you can be forced to slug through multiple floors with your starting weapon with no upgrades ever given out, as is unfortunately standard for indie roguelikes, especially ones of this era. The guns are also bland, with even powerful weapons feeling like piddly little super soakers.
 
Monsters do not make sounds except to attack, which is REALLY bad in a game that's trying to be a supercharged first person shooter, because keeping track of monsters via noise becomes a valuable skill in most fast-paced FPS games. I have died several times to monsters I didn't even know were there because I backpedaled into them. Almost every room requires me to seek out monsters after big battles to get the doors open because they have a habit of crouching silently in corners and staying there.

I could go on, but in conclusion, please just go buy Tower Of Guns or Ziggurat or any other FPS roguelike. Or hell, go buy STRAFE. All of those games are far more deserving of your money and time than a game from a developer whose instinctive reaction to a technical difficulty is to threaten harm to an employee of the company who hosts his game's store page. They also have the nice side effect of being fun.",1679118786,1679118969,False,10,0,0.63540184497833252,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This game was released in 2013, a full 17 years after the Quake game it's ripping off, yet is worse in every single respect.  Graphics are worse, and gameplay is non-existent as the developers were unable to come up with meaningful level design, and were hoping procgen would be a viable subsitute.  Developers must learn that procgen is not content.  To try to disguise their failure at the basic task of story/level design, they made the game ultra difficult in the hopes gamers wouldn't see enough of the game to notice.  We noticed.  The icing on the cake is the core gunfighting FPS mechanism is woefully bad, with sloppy loose aiming and controls, where FPS games must absolutely be tight and precise on this.

The game's a little too random. The kitchen sink vibe with weapons, power-ups, and enemies is kind of appropriate for the throwback vibe the developer is going for, but the level layout gets samey.

It's almost as bad as Postal 2. It feels like someone took a bad atari 2600 game and somehow made it into 3D. There are no sound effects hardly at all besides when you fire and maybe one or two other things but that's it. Only a few weapons have sound effects anyway. Enemies have none, the environment has none. The weapons in the game, all of them, are just god awful horrible buttgarbage. The music is about ten times louder than the sound effects unless you fix it in the options, which I didn't even bother looking to see if I could because I alt+f4'ed right the hell out after 9 minutes of torture. The music never stops either. It plays on a loop and dying, going to the main menu, nothing stops it except maybe turning it off in the sound menu. This feels like a super generic Doom knockoff from the late 90's, basically vaporware. Actually it feels like the alpha of a super generic Doom knockoff that got abandoned and just released as shareware/freeware. I played a bunch of those back in the late 90's and they were suicide inducingly bad, and this is just as bad if not worse. It's like playing this is giving me flashbacks and triggering my 90's bad-game PTSD. Nam was bad enough, I don't need this shit now.

I got a key online for around 80 cents and that was about five dollars too much, which in other words they should pay people to take this trash. As for me, if I had a physical copy I would take it alright. Take it right to the dump. I would lay it on top of the dump, climb up a big ladder, tape a live grenade to my arm, and do a Macho Man Randy Savage elbow drop onto it and pull the pin on the grenade in mid-air so it explodes when I hit.

Holy fucking shit this is GARBAGE.

Paranautical Activity: Deluxe Atonement Edition (or simply Paranautical Activity) is a game developed and published by Digerati Distribution

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Paranautical Activity: Deluxe Atonement Edition (or simply Paranautical Activity) overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring and tedious if being played for a long time, but is a great rouge-like action game to play in short bursts!

No wait: that's trite. Let's be proper about this.

It genuinely amazes me that the dev of a buggy chunk of voxelated turd like this really thought they were such a badboi that they could threaten Gaben. It's just as staggering that anyone considered this worthwhile enough to let it come back to steam.

Here's my experience:

Game starts. Music is blatantly made from a ""DIY Dubstep pack of loops and samples"" (my old job used to be designing cover art for these, so  know 'em when i hear them). I see a static menu, and can't use a (regular xbox) gamepad to select anything on it. Mouse pointer is present, but menu options don't light up on hover. I click new game. Nothing happens for about 2 minutes. Then I'm dropped into the game, which is paused. Gamepad can now move the selected pause menu option, but no button on it actually selects anything. I click resume or whatever with the mouse instead. It lags for about 10 seconds, then unpauses and my PoV swings around wildly and i end up looking at the floor, despite me touching no inputs during this. I try to mouselook. That's a nope. I use the gamepad instead, and look around. Turning is sooooooooo slow by default that it takes 15 seconds to turn 360 degrees. I consider pausing, but neither esc nor gamepad start seem to do it, although they do make the music hiccup. I take a rough guess that the pause button is set on high speed autofire, and decide ok no pausing. I walk into the next room. Walking on gamepad is at a reasonable pace, but as i get into the next room, shots are fired and i see that something to my left is attacking me. After SEVEN WHOLE SECONDS of turning, i see that it's some kind of devil guy and i get a bead on him just long enough to squeeze off one shot, or rather i slam all the gamepad's shoulder triggers and bumpers in order, and 1.5 sec later, my gun fires. I'm amazed i even notice, mind, because there's no visual feedback to indicate this other than a few voxels at the gun muzzle. No kickback. Maybe it made a noise, but the music is turnt up so high I'd never hear gunshots. Then I dides, because of course i took 7 sec of being fired upon before i could even look at what attacked me.

Weirdly, using this exact same PC multiple years ago, I've seen this game run at a reasonable speed with mouse and wasd.

Based on my experience with it today, which is my only firsthand experience, this is a laughable borkfest, and so is its author if they ever considered it anything worth defending with such spite as death threats.

Why you shouldn't buy this: This game was halted in development after it was removed from steam. The Deluxe atonement part of the title refers to that.

 One of the two main devs for this game, the one responsible for coding if I'm not mistaken, made a post intended to express his frustration with how steam handles update pushing, in this post he said that he wanted to kill Gabe Newell for this, as a not so proper way to show his anger toward the system. Now while I'm not saying he was right to say that, I also understand the joke there. Everyone who plays competitive online games gets that, its the same as that little kid threatening to kill your mother for beating them. As such it should be obvious that the Dev meant that as a tactless joke.

Unfortunately the guys at Steam didn't see it this way. And while it is completely in their right to do so, I believe they overreacted by removing this game. Do I think this was justified, not entirely, but the same could be said about the statement, Dev didn't Have to include the killing part and we would have understood his frustration just the same. 

This all occured right in the middle of a pretty consistent update stream from the devs, they were very active with the community and had Just started getting through some of the stretch goals from a kickstarter for this game. They were being the good devs that we want early access games. Unfortunately for everyone they had to sell the property to the new publisher, this made it so there would be No new updates, ever. The online Co-op that was promised and being worked on will never come as a result of this, nor will anything.

This game could have been big. There is already a ton of content in here and it was going to be so much more.. But a stupid statement by a naive dev and an earned, however unjust, punishment from steam, robbed anyone from seeing what this game could have been.",1540255850,1540255850,False,12,1,0.593980252742767334,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Lo que me gust√≥
-Gr√°ficamente distinto
-""Mazmorras"" aleatorias, que le da un toque de diversidad en enemigos, e items que podras usar
-Dificultad elevada, no es f√°cil superar todas las mazmorras

Lo que no me gust√≥
-No hay historia ni referencia de fondo, todo es porque si

-Muy corto, se puede terminar en minutos si te tocan los boss en cada mazmorra

Or B: You heard about the lead dev threatening to kill Gabe Newell over incorrect branding on the front page of steam. What you probably never heard is that it‚Äôs a good game.

Now, I don‚Äôt have the playtime to get deep into the mechanics of the game, and I‚Äôm not going to waste my time on a game I don‚Äôt like. So this is coming from a complete novice. But I can‚Äôt think of a game I‚Äôve bounced off of harder.

For starters, the movement in Paranautical Activity is strangely floaty and has a momentum to it that I wouldn‚Äôt expect from a game where you run around like you‚Äôre playing OG DOOM. There is something to the movement that just makes it feel bad‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt quite speed up like you would expect, and you don't‚Äô really stop where want to either. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre moving through water at all times. I‚Äôm sure that if I was willing to put more time into this that I could probably get used to it. But I find the feeling to be very, very, off putting.

Like most rogue-likes there are multiple starting classes, each with their own stats and weapons. Sadly most of the starting weapons suck. You either have a high damage, slow shot speed crossbow that‚Äôs difficult to land a hit with. A grenade launcher with timed explosives. A close range sickle. Or a Shotgun. The only gun that felt good to me was the shotgun, sadly it‚Äôs also comes packaged with the slowest starting movement speed. Perhaps I‚Äôm just bad, but I found that it was nigh impossible to avoid the first floor boss‚Äôs attacks with ‚Äúthe tank‚Äù. Nothing feels better in a game than being too slow to move out of the way of an attack. If you couldn‚Äôt tell, that was sarcasm.

The slow ass movement and the unappealing weapons combined with the floaty movement is a recipe for disaster‚Ä¶

Perhaps if the game looked better I would be willing to give it more of a chance. But no, the art sucks too. Paranautical Activity has a voxel based artstyle, making it look like it was inspired by Minecraft‚Ä¶ Which maybe in 2013 wasn‚Äôt done to death, but I‚Äôve never liked the blocky look of these types of games, where everything looks like it was put together with legos‚Ä¶ ¬†Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm willing to give this kind of art a pass if it does something interesting with it like say Paint the Town Red. Or 8-bit Armies. But this game really doesn‚Äôt do much. It has some nice colored lighting and a few interesting shaders, and that‚Äôs about it. Plus it‚Äôs almost like they knew the art wasn‚Äôt anything special so they made the game really dark to kind of hide it... But all it does is make enemies blend into the environment.

Now to continue beating a dead horse, the music is bad too. It feels straight out of a 2007 Newgrounds flash game. It has almost no thematic relation to the feel of the game, the beat is just a little too fast for the gameplay, and‚Ä¶ Well it‚Äôs just bad techno....

I almost feel bad because I know people spent a lot of time making this. But it‚Äôs just bad. No, it's awful. There is no redeeming quality to it. It's a waste of time, money, and hard drive space.

I cannot recommend this game in any way, shape, or form. I think I got it in a humble bundle, and honestly even that‚Äôs not a great value. If this game truly interests you, well you probably already own it and have played it enough to not care what I think.

But on the off chance that you‚Äôre coming upon this before you actually buy it. Turn back. Abandon hope, all ye who play this game.",1516148854,1516148854,False,9,0,0.514954626560211182,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Almost every positive about the game is countered with a negative, yet I'd still recommend it to players who are really into roguelites and mid-90's first-person shooters (and don't mind a game that looks and sounds like crap, if I'm being honest). They could get a few hours of genuine fun out of it, and maybe even find it addicting, like I have. However, if you're not totally in love with both of those genres, the game's flaws will probably be too much to ignore.

When the game works well, it's honestly a lot of fun. It elicits some of the same excitement one would feel from playing the original Quake, or even Doom 2016: you're circle-strafing all over the room, leaping from platform to platform, hopping over lava pits, looking for escape routes, dodging fireballs, setting off explosive barrels at just the right moments, and prioritizing targets based on what kind of attack capabilities or strength they have. It's an old-school FPS treat.

When the game [i]doesn't[/i] work well, you enter a room and are immediately swarmed by melee enemies who move too fast to avoid getting hit by, who are hard to see and shoot because the game's visual style is so dark, and who can easily sneak up on you because almost no enemies in the game make any sound, all while relentless homing fireballs chase you everywhere. Then you spend a minute sweeping the room to find an enemy that's stuck behind a wall so you can kill it and clear the area. That's when the game feels remarkably clumsy.

With this being a roguelite, you can expect perma-death and levels with randomized layouts and object placements. Map design here is extremely simple, with every room being a cube, identical in size and shape to every other room. Thankfully, each room is decorated with a variety of multi-tiered platforms, staircases and hazards to keep things exciting, though it won't be long until you start noticing repeated room designs--sometimes several in a row. Randomly, modifiers will also kick in that make levels darker (as if they weren't dim enough already) or icy and slippery. These modifiers are a cool design concept, but the execution tends to just make the gameplay more annoying.

You can obtain equippable items from shops and bosses. The thing is, the game never tells you what an item does until you've actually collected it (and sometimes not even then). That makes item collection a real gamble, as you might spend money on useless equipment, or get stuck with something that messes with your stats and actually makes you weaker. That sort of random chance and learning curve is part of what makes roguelites enjoyable, as a single decision can drastically alter the difficulty of a run, but the game being so vague and unhelpful can induce frustration as well.

Saving your game isn't an option either. A full playthrough generally isn't terribly long, but it still sucks to have to lose your progress when real life calls you away.

The game has a nice unlock system at least, where new items, playable characters (with unique stats and weapons) and game modes are introduced when you perform certain achievements. This encourages skillful play, and gives you fresh stuff to look forward to on subsequent runs. Admittedly, a lot of the items in the game are generic buffs and debuffs, but there are a few creative powers--an item allows you to shrink down and become a tiny target who can hide inside small openings, for instance--that fundamentally alter the gameplay, sometimes to a deliciously broken degree.

In the end, despite all the flaws, I kept coming back to this game. The core gameplay constantly demands dextrous movements and careful aim. Couple that with the inherent roguelite charm of experimenting with different characters and getting lucky with item shop selections, and I found it pretty engaging. But it's definitely rough around the edges.",1511174300,1511440123,True,33,1,0.777046680450439453,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Paranautical Activity is a bad dungeon crawler, hands down. An indie game which is rotting here on Steam since years and imho, it did nothing to redeem itself. It's bugged, the difficulty is contrived... It's empty; initially i was attracted by it for the pixels' gaudy tones and the frenzy fights, but then i've found this and nothing else. It's also very easy to die in unpredictable ways and for the aforementioned frantic gameplay, so in the end even this thing is a negative point (mind you, i'm all in for games like Quake or that sort of thing, but this is just a bad kind of cheap bullet-fest). It's true, each time you play there's a random layout of the rooms just like 'The Binding of Isaac' and other similar games, but actually there isn't that much of variety. Zones are copied and pasted continuously, to put it bluntly. This is perhaps the most ugly and messed up review I've ever wrote, but i don't know how to say it otherwise. This game is petty, boring, unsatisfying, incomplete, bugged, unmotivated. If you like the genre, then just stick with the pillars and don't waste your time and money. Don't get me wrong, i like novelties and niches, i've played a lot of these games and i even appreciated more obscure gems like Ziggurat or Delver, but this one... This one doesn't have neither head nor tail, for me you should avoid it and give a shot to something else on the store. Could be worse, but it could be way, way better.

Paranautical Activity √® un brutto dungeon crawler, poche storie. Un indie game che sta marcendo qui su Steam ormai da anni, e imho non ha fatto nulla per redimersi. E' buggato, la difficolt√† √® artificiosa... √® vuoto. Inizialmente mi attirava per i toni sgargianti dei pixel e la frenesia dei combattimenti, ma poi mi sono ritrovato questo e nient'altro. Che poi √® facile morire in modi imprevedibili o appunto per la ""frenesia"" appena citata, quindi alla fin fine anche questo diventa un contro. Certo, abbiamo il layout randomico delle stanze un po' come succede su giochi come 'The Binding of Isaac', ma non si riesce a percepire chiss√† quanta variet√†, anzi. Le zone sono trite e ritrite, detto in maniera molto schietta. 
Questa √® sicuramente la recensione pi√π brutta ed ingarbugliata che potessi scrivere, ma non so come dirvelo diversamente... 'Sto gioco √® meschino, palloso, insoddisfacente, incompleto, buggato, immotivato. Se prediligete questo genere, tanto vale continuare a stickare con i pilastri, piuttosto. E badate che non sono contro le novit√†, o meglio, le nicchie. Dopotutto non faccio altro che giocare a questo genere di giochi! Ve lo dice insomma uno che ha saputo apprezzare dungeon crawlers pi√π misconosciuti quali Ziggurat o Delver, ma questo... Questo non ha n√® arte n√® parte. A mio avviso √® da evitare.

[b][i] --- Onto the actual game review --- [/i][/b]

This game is great to play for a while.  You load it up and feel great like you are slamming down some monsters.  After a while you notice the rooms are repeated and use the same few types over and over.  There is little diversity to what you experience after a while.  I mean everything is repeated.  Mob types, graphics... everything.

Code Avarice made an update to ""Delux Atonement Edition"" which fixed a few things.  It is obvious the mobs and weapons had some work put into them and they're interesting in themselves.  However everything remained repeated like in the original version.  They added diversity by adding a static picture of lava to the floor.  It was nice at first... but it is not moving lava or anything with smoke/steam particles.  The same picture on the floor on every lava room.  Just like the first version with everything being repeated.  I was not impressed as there are so many particles on everything else... could of reused that code for a little diversity.

All together with the bugs, lack of updates, *zero* developer involvement and generic repetition of environment in this game.  It makes it difficult to play for more than a few hours.  I enjoyed [i][b]Ziggurat[/b][/i] more than this, or [i][b]Tower of Guns[/b][/i].",1502726910,1504199010,False,68,2,0.800840079784393311,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I don't know what it means, but it sounds cool. In terms of gameplay, picture Minecraft, but with guns and bombs and samurai swords, flying skulls, spiders, bats and sharks all trying to kill you, and add a drums and bass/dubstep soundtrack. That's Paranautical Activity in a nutshell. The way the game works however, is that on each floor, there's a number of randomly-generated rooms with random enemies in them. Kill the boss on each floor to advance, but here's the catch. If you die, you start at the very beginning. Now, this makes PA more punishing than some other games, but I suppose it's niche is for people who enjoy the grind, or the process of constantly dying. While I don't personally have the patience for such a game, it's actually entertaining, but above all intense. The run and gun aspect of the game makes it incredibly fast-paced, and were it not for dying and restarting from square one over and over, I think I could easily keep playing Paranautical Activity.

Is all I can really say if someone asked for a quick description of this game.
The long one is here:
The game has a pretty good soundtrack which I really like. But it is too quick for the gameplay, which is slow and should be much quicker. For example, you have 4 classes David Bowie, Di-no-mite (or sumtin') , (the really quick one), and The Tank.
Out of these 4 only 2 are playable. (David and The Quick One) Becouse Di and Tank are too slow. When I played as them it was extremely boring going to room to room slower than a snail on salt. And even with the quick guys (B and T.Q.O) you sometimes can't run away from the enemies. The A.I. mostly tries to get as close to you as possible, and most of the time it's faster than you. So you get stuck in an endless party of pain. Which sounds cool but when you're in one it's really frustrating. 


I won't list any ways in how the game could get better simply becouse it's 4 years old and It's in a ''Deluxe Atonement Edition'' and if something has that big of a name, and still sucks. I don't think the creator is going to fix sh**.

It feels like a budget game by one or two people, and it makes a lot of rookie mistakes in its design. Everything is very basic, but doesn't feel very stable. Enemy AI is very simple, always firing where you are instead of where you're going. Most fights just boil down to repetitive kiting. 

Nothing is explained or discoverable. There aren't any tutorials or controlled settings for you to learn how to play, you're just dropped in and expected to figure it out without any signposting. This wouldn't be a big issue in some games, but because of how hectic the fights are, you don't get a chance to absorb information or experiment. When you inevitably die to something that blended in to the chaos fired by an enemy that blended in to the background, the screen presents you with the option to ""restart"" or ""quit"". ""Restart"" sends you back to the main menu. ""Quit"" closes the game. 

I could go on for hours on the tiny mistakes the game makes all over the place, but overall the game isn't objectively bad. A lot of the problems could be fixed relatively easily. Regardless, I still can't recommend this game considering how many other games on steam are essentially the same game with a hell of a lot more polish.

Now, I haven't really followed the controversy surrounding the game since I'm not interested in developer drama but I am glad that the current developers are actually putting effort into it. 

The game itself, to me personally, is nothing more than a nice time waster. Kind of like The Binding of Isaac, you play in randomly generated levels with rooms you must clear in order to advance to the next floor. What differentiates it from other so-called ""time wasters"", however, is the pure adrenaline you get from fighting multiple enemies or hugh mungus bosses. Even though I haven't played many rogue likes (mostly because I'm not a fan of the genre), I think this game is a great introduction. Your reflexes and coordination will be put to the test, along with your sense of direction in the sometimes overwhelmingly confusing levels. The voxel graphics are nice to look at for what they are though the level design is pretty bland and not memorable in the slightest.

I'd personally recommend the game if you find it on sale. I see a lot of people saying Ziguratt is better and even though I haven't played it, they seem like two entirely different games.

However, be aware that the learning curve may be steep.  There's no single starting character that is well balanced for someone new to the game.

Pros
-Great music.  The music may be the best part, imo.  I don't know if I'd call it dubstep, as the outline has.
-The voxel artwork is interesting, and the bosses are all pretty great in their own ways.
-The Seafarers Guide pdf is useful and the mini documentary is interesting. (To find it, right click your game and click properties, then click the ""local files"" tab and ""browse local files"")
-I believe a lot of thought was put into the pickups and weapons and effects and differentiating objects from each other.

Cons
-There's no well balanced character for a begginning player to pick up the game quickly with.
-It's not obvious what pickups do.  The seafarers guide will tell you, and google might.  
-A lot of pickups can be detrimental to gameplay, and those seem to be the items I get most.  For example, I seem to get a lot of slow down items when I'm the tank until I move too slow to get out of the way of anything.
-When there are a lot of particles on the screen it can be hard to tell what's going on (this may just be an unavoidable side effect of bullet hell shooters)
-The menus can feel a little cheap.  I can't put my finger on why exactly.  But they're menus, so they don't really matter.  They are the introduction to the game.  Also,  the Unity frontloader always feels kind of amateur(cookie cutter) to me. Moving the controller options and video options into the main game menu and dropping the frontloader would have remedied that.  Again, it really has no effect on gameplay, so it's not a big deal to me.
-On my machine, in OSX, there seems to be some issues with music lagging and possibly other kinds of lag.  An fps counter would be nice, so I could know for sure.  This could just be my machine, or just OSX.  I don't know.
-The controversy surrounding this game is highly disconcerting.  I hope those at fault learned the right lessons from the experience, and that everyone involved was compensated fairly for their efforts.


Games are hard as hell to make, and overall I feel like this was a really good effort.  Without the controversy, and with some incremental improvements, I feel like this game could have gone much further, and been a lot more successful.

Was meine ich mit fragw√ºrdigem Hintergrund? Dann schonmal vornweg: Ab der 5ten Ebene des Spieles kommt man auf ein Gebiet, wo √ºberall Hakenkreuze zu sehen sind. Man k√∂nnte hier denken, dass man ala Wolfenstein Nazis abschlachtet oder sowas √§hnliches, jedoch scheint der Entwickler(nach den Ger√ºchten) doch diese rechte Einstellung wirklich zu haben. Als das Spiel von Steam kritisiert und darauf von der Plattform entfernt wurde, bedrohte der Entwickler Gaben (Chef von Steam) und und drohte damit, ihn umzubringen. Jetzt wird das Spiel von einem anderen Entwickler gef√ºhrt, jedoch hat der kaum etwas ver√§ndert, au√üer den Startbildschirm und des Einf√ºgen eines Darkfloors. Das Spiel entwickelt sich also nicht mehr wirklich weiter. Es kamen sogar Ger√ºchte auf, dass immernoch derselbe Entwickler an dem Spiel beteiligt ist und der Publisher nur zum Schein gewechselt wurde. Die Hakenkreuze sind auf jeden Fall immernoch da, jedoch kann man es auch so verstehen, dass man eine Unterwasserbasis der Nazis zerst√∂rt. Naja, das war die Vorgeschichte, jetzt zum Spiel:

[b]Gameplay[/b]
In Paranautical Activity gibt es zuf√§llig generierte R√§ume, √§hnlich wie in Bindings of Isaac. Darin befinden sich verschiedenste Gegner, die man schnell und ohne viel Leben zu verlieren, umnieten muss. Dabei hilft es, schnell rumzulaufen und m√∂glichst viel zu springen. Das Spiel ist recht schwer, aber gerade das macht ja Spa√ü daran. Ansonsten kann zwischen mehreren Charakteren w√§hlen(die man auch noch freischaltet) und es gibt auf jeder Ebene immer einen Boss, Nebenboss und einen Laden, wo man sich mit neuen Items eindecken kann. Diese Items sind teilweise sehr kryptisch, was ihren Nutzen angeht. Manche sind mega praktisch, manche bewirken nur, dass der Charakter ""ouch!"" sagt, wenn er getroffen wird und manche Items sind sogar sehr negativ. Daher sollte man sich vielleicht nen Guide offenhalten, damit man irgendwann mal wei√ü, was man da eigentlich tut. Zudem gibt es noch eine Nebenwaffe, welche Munition ben√∂tigt und kurzeitige Buffs, die man gelegentlich einsetzen kann.

Ich habe es erst nach knapp 10 Stunden Spielzeit geschafft, alle 7(8) Flure durchzukriegen. Mitunter liegt das an nen paar Bugs, wo die Gegner auf mich zukommen und ich quasi auf ihnen stehe und so innerhalb von 2 Sekunden tot bin, da ich mich net wegbewegen kann. Das d√§mpft nat√ºrlich den Spielspa√ü. Dennoch macht es wirklich viel Spa√ü, von vorne anzufangen.

[b]Story[/b]
Naja, es hei√üt Paranautical Activity, also unter Wasser. Ein paar Gegner sehen so aus, aber sonst gibts da keine Story. Da es die bereits angesprochenen ""Nazi""-Inhalte gibt, habe ich die Theorie, dass die Nazis die ganzen Gegner erschaffen haben und man selber soll sie aufhalten. Nur eine Theorie. :D

[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]
Tja, wir habens hier mit Voxel Grafik zu tun, die wie ich finde, gut umgesetzt wurde. Nur auf den geheimen ""Dark Floors"" ist es manchmal schwierig, da manche Gegner nicht genug leuchten, um sie wirklich zu finden. 
Der Soundtrack ist eigentlich recht gut macht irgendwie s√ºchtig. Auch die Waffensounds sind sehr sch√∂n passend umgesetzt worden.

[b]Fazit[/b]
Es ist schwer, Paranautical Activity zu bewerten. Das Spiel kann ja nichts f√ºr seine Hintergrundgeschichte, aber dennoch st√∂rt diese mich. Zum anderen fehlt mir die n√∂tige Itembeschreibung, die nicht mehr kommenden Updates und ein paar Bugs, welche echt nervig sein k√∂nnen. Aber dennoch hat mir dieses Spiel viele lustige Stunden beschert, die einfach viel Spa√ü gemacht haben. Ich gebe daher nen Daumen hoch, der eigentlich auch weiter in der Mitte zu finden sein k√∂nnte. F√ºr den derzeitigen Preis 9 ‚Ç¨ w√ºrde ich es vielleicht grade so noch empfehlen, w√ºrde aber auf ein Angebot warten.

Paranautical Activity es un FPS combinado con elementos Rouge-like y con un aspecto bastante interesante, y hasta cierto punto, agradable de ver. Tiene un estilo visual basado en cubos que es muy bueno y orignal, ademas, tiene una generosa dosis de contenido.
Hay un par de problemas en el juego que me gustaria recalcar:
El primero es que el menu luce bastante sencillo, incluso para los estandares de hoy en dia. Parece que fue hecho de forma sumamente desganada, lo mismo quiza con el HUD, aunque este ultimo se ve mejor trabajado.
El segundo es, y por mucho lo peor, es que los enemigos no hacen ruido alguno. Pareceria que no fuera un gran lio, el problema es que muchas veces los enemigos te saltan por detras o estan escondidos detras de un pilar o debajo de una plataforma, por lo que terminan causandote da√±o de a gratis o te preguntas porque las puertas no se han abierto aun.
He visto rese√±as de gente que se queja de que la unica clase buena para jugar es la del tanque, aunque, personalmente, la clase que maneja el lanza-granadas me parecio un poco mejor y mas divertido, aunque tiene 3 puntos de vida menos que el tanque.
Yo compre el juego con un 75% de rebaja, asi que realmente no me siento estafado. Eso si, no te recomiendo comprarlo a precio completo, hay mejores Rouge-like FPS por ahi si buscas un poco.",1477184129,1477184129,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gameplay is really basic: murder bad things with weapons, run & jump & dodge, enhance your character with power-ups, and progress forward. This is all just fine, but there's not much that makes it stand out here, just like this paragraph!

A fun roguelike shooter with pixelated graphics. Not the best in its genre, but fun nonetheless.

In Paranautical Activity, you have a few classes to pick and they differ in speed, damage, fire rate, health and starting weapons. After picking your character, you'll be traversing through randomly generated rooms, defeating enemies on the way, collecting money and using said money to buy upgrades when you come to a room with items for sale. At the end of each level, you'll fight a boss before progressing to the next level.

The main issue with the game is that it can be very confusing at times. As a roguelike game, it's expected that the game won't hold your hand and a lot of trial-and-error will be involved, but even then the game does little to tell you what each item does. The game could certainly benefit with being at least slightly more descriptive.

Another issue is that because rooms look mostly the same and enemies repeat themselves a lot as well, the game can become quite repetitive.

In comparison to games like Tower of Guns or Ziggurat, it doesn't stand out, but it's still recommended for those who enjoy roguelike shooters.",1475738223,1475738223,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

     The grindy industrial music adds a lot to this epileptic bullet hell fps but everything else in this game is extremely lacking. Stylistically, this game is total garbage. There is no consistency to any of the art you find in the game and the ""nautical""  of this game is forced in to what seems like a random set of enemies. You're on a nazi ship and you'll find anything from moths to snails if you get the just. They only have two different room backgrounds they apply to rooms with different torch placements. Yes you heard that right two room backgrounds on a FINISHED GAME IN A GAME WHERE YOU ONLY GO INTO ROOMS. And the graphics oh my lord the graphics. These graphics looked like they were made by a 15 year old learning how to use voxel. Holy shit are they just flat out terrible. 
     There is no such thing as balance in this game classes or items. That wouldn't be such an issue if there was such a thing as building your character but its all 100% chance based folks. That boss that gives you double jump which is essential? Well you are just about as likely to find a shitty boss who gives you a garbage item. Wanna beat the game as the Tank? Well you might as well play bouncer because you don't need a speed up item or skill. OH BOY I got another dark floor item even though I didn't and will not get a single DARK ROOM. 
     Progressing in this game is like using a cheese grater as a fleshlight. You have no fucking clue if your build will win because you might just die to a totally random room because it was so fucking impossible.  Its almost like you're not even building to win, you are just building to hopefully surive to floor 7 MAYBE. The first playthrough where you think you're going to win is tarnished when you walk into a room and take 10 damage. This isn't even due to lack of skill, the devs flat out made layouts where if you don't see every enemy in the room and the room itself and react before 1 second 95% of the locations you try to run to will lead to 2-3 damage. Do you feel like you are making it anywhere with your build? No. Never. You seriously will get fucking destroyed sometimes and all your left with is why am I still playing this game.
     This is game has its fair share of bugs, there are so many I don't even know where to begin.I swear the more rooms you enter the game gets laggier by the end so you might as well just not try to stock up. I've had so many fictitiously good builds and then I get to the last boss and it drops to one frame rate. The only poor soul I got invested into this game has a super computer and after it released as a full game it could barely run at 10 fps for him. Enemies will like the caustic dogs and the flipping monkey men will get caught on room obstacles constantly. Enemies in general will sometimes get stuck in walls and you are literally just trapped in a room and have to restart. 
     Don't even get me started on their cheesy excuse for an update. They somehow made the game worse and managed to overlook anything any player of this game might want. All I can imagine is the devs for this game sitting at a table thinking ""Lets make a floor type that fucking blows, a poor attempt at a hardcore mode, and a couple of new rooms that ARE TOTALLY UNBALANCED."". Well thanks devs thats about as good as an idea as sending death threats at Gabe Newell and losing all the poor souls paying too much for your game. The devs even made fun of the players of their OWN GAME on twitter. WHO EVEN FUCKING DOES THAT.
     If you are looking to buy an fps roguelite don't buy this one. Please do not buy this. The devs are trash, the game will only ruin your hopes for what it could have been,  and it will give you a sezuire. Speaking from a player whos been playing since early access, it is not and it will never be worth your time sadly.",1468559416,1468559416,False,8,1,0.578018844127655029,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You can choose from 4 different guys, 2 of them worthless and unplayable, and 1 pretty bad. Then theres the game. Half the stuff you pick up on the ground you don't know what it is until you get it. Same for pickups from boss drops. Some items will tell you what it is called before you pick it up, but you have no idea what it does. Then theres the permanent items that you can't even read what they are, so you can't reference an item list from a guide. So you can be completely screwed. I was shotgun guy and picked up 1 slow down but more health, but i had no idea thats what it did. I was too slow and lost and had to immediately restart. I shouldn't be screwed bc of the game's fault for lack of info. Many items are just tradeofs, like temporary armor for perm speed reduction, which is just dumb and screws you, but once again don't know till its too late and you lose. There's no item list or info from the game about what items do, so you need outside lists. Enemies can spawn on top of you once you enter a room, leading to cheap damage. Some enemies also blend into floor and background, leading to cheap damage bc u can't see them, once again game's fault. Then there's worst of all. I was half way through game and first room I got had lava all over, and then these skulls that can auto catch up to you and you can't run from and home you and you get hurt. Able to kill them but took damage. Next level 8 skulls spawn, auto catch up to me, and I die in 5 seconds. It's so stupid I got auto loss when there's nothing I can do about it. 

Every room is almost the exact same with maybe some stairs. You fight the same 3 enemies each floor, and usually most of them on the floor above. Bosses are the only cool or original thing, but they usually just shoot colored balls at you anyways. You keep no progress. Can't start from higher floors. Keep no boosts nor money. You don't unlock new guys or any reason to keep playing. You get random unlocks from doing achievements but all that does is make it so an item has a chance of dropping now, which isn't much bc of the randomness. Very poorly designed how you can get into a room and bc of spawn there's nothing you can do  to keep from dying, and you auto die bc of the game, and lose all progress with nothing new to use next time or beefed up character to take going forward. Tons of better roguelikes, that are fair and well made that have incentive to continue playing.

I will make the review as short as possible since I was not impressed at all and was so frustrated.

[h1] The game [/h1]
Paranautical Activity is an FPS Rogue game that copies the style of binding of isaac, from the character voices, to the weapon description, the level progression and more, which I think is great but sadly they screwed up something so bad.

[h1]The Good [/h1]
Fast-paced action, nice controls, easy to understand weapons and items.
Nice enemies, good level progressions, replay-ability, a lot of secrets.

[h1]The bad[/h1]
There are some levels that just throws the game for me and sadly you have to go through some of them ""random luck"" to finish a run, they're the dark room levels, your vision is dead, the rooms are TOO DARK 
I get it they tried to add a horror factor and maybe copied the idea of the shadow curse of binding of isaac but they did it so bad, this is FPS you cant make it impossible to see the floor around me and the enemies thats so dumb.

So many times I had an op run I was killing bosses so easily, but then I encounter the dark levels and I die from normal enemies because I cant see them.

All you can do is keep on jumping and shooting around like a maniac hoping you might see the red glowy small light that some enemies have, but eventually die because its almost impossible to see them coming, this really REALLY threw the game for me, reached the point where its not even funny anymore I just barely finish those levels by jumping constantly, then next floor ? Same level ...

There are a lot of bugs in the game, I keep getting glitches every time I start a new run that brings up the menu and doesn't go away ""I think they tried to force pause the game so you cant move while the level starts but screwed up"" 

The music is REALLY good but even at my best headsets they do sound a bit ...static I guess ? or maybe thats how they meant to do them, I don't know.

The game could have so much more but it ruined all of that with the shadow levels it just threw the entire game out of concept, ruined my experience, made the game unbelievably frustrating and I just had to alt+f4 when I got 3 dark levels in a row.

From a technical point of view this is a quite fine game. This is a FPS game where every room and every level indeed is randomly generated. We have some patterns like a boss room or a shop room every level although everything else is mostly random.

It's really hard to give a thumbs down to this game as it is technically a good game. This is just my personal opinion.

Pros:
- it's quick
- four distinct character classes - different starting weapons, hit points value, speed and so on
- randomness - after every boss fight we get a random item that changes our stats
- nice graphics, looks like Minecraft on steroids

Cons:
- music is a dubstep mess - personally I don't like such kind of music although someone might find it amusing
- this game is really hard. Maybe not Dark Souls level of hard but still hard
- well character classes are distinct but only Tank starts with 9 hit points which relates to higher survival chance
- I don't see a point in playing this game - this is only imo

So in conclusion - we have a technically decent game that lacks some kind of main motive. Or guts or spirit, whatever we may call it. 

If you like randomly generated shooters then go for it, it's ok, it's hard as nails, it's quick as Quake 1 and so on. 

I personally cannot recommend this game as it lacks something vital. I can't really describe this value in one words but let's say it this way - this game lacks a value that makes a player want to play this game.

Original developer and publisher: Code Avarice
Current developer and publisher: Digerati Distribution

Initially the game was placed on Steam Greenlight on Aug 31, 2012
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93241332&searchtext=

Then they had a successful Kickstarter campaign that collected $12,540 USD. (August 4, 2013 - September 3, 2013)
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1125357480/paranautical-activity-old-school-fps-meets-rogueli

There were issues with the greenlight campaign:
""Code Avarice already set up a placeholder Steam Greenlight page and Steam 'didn't want to send the message that indies can seek out publishers to bypass Steam Greenlight.'""
http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-04-first-person-roguelike-paranautical-activity-not-allowed-past-greenlight-even-with-a-publisher

But Officially, the title got Greenlit by 8/28/2013.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1125357480/paranautical-activity-old-school-fps-meets-rogueli/posts/582749

Subsequently, in October 2014 the developer threatened Gabe Newell's life over a Steam listing issue associated with the title. 
""harsh lesson Paranautical Activity developer Mike Maulbeck learned today when after a Steam snafu erroneously advertised his game as an Early Access title he crossed a line and tweeted a death threat to Gabe Newell. Following this outrage, the game was pulled from Valve's distribution service.""
http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-21-valve-pulls-game-from-steam-following-devs-tweet-threatening-gabe-newell
http://gameranx.com/updates/id/17237/article/paranautical-activity-on-steam-early-access/

Needless to say, the developer didnt handle the situation and associated fallout well:
http://www.pcgamer.com/paranautical-activity-removed-from-steam-following-developer-outburst/

This caused the game to be removed from the Steam store, the offending dev to resign from the studio (""Code Avarice""), the ""Paranautical Activity"" IP to be sold to another company (""Digerati Distribution & Marketing""), followed by the offending dev rejoining his original studio.
http://www.polygon.com/2015/2/17/8053713/paranautical-activity-death-threat-gabe-newell-steam
http://www.pcgamer.com/paranautical-activity-returns-to-steam-with-deluxe-atonement-edition/

On the Early Access Steam store page, they claimed ""We're planning to add multiplayer co-op in the very near future, as well as a ton more content, and of course some bug fixes and polish."" https://web.archive.org/web/20140418040048*/http://store.steampowered.com/app/250580

They also claimed that:
""Paranautical Activity multiplayer is definitely a thing that is happening...We‚Äôve been really busy trying to get MP working...The multiplayer patch will be going live before the year anniversary of the game (february 14th)[2014]""
http://web.archive.org/web/20140407082949/http://codeavarice.com/post/71570505839/paranautical-activity-mulitplayer

Subsquently, the devs disclosed that they would not add a multiplayer mode.
""Sorry to those who purchased this game under the guise of the fact it will be multiplayer. We just couldn‚Äôt rebuild the entire game to make this happen, there is only two of us.‚Äù
http://www.pcgamesn.com/indie/paranautical-activity-developers-fight-community-over-cancelled-co-op-mode-insist-roguelike-fps-not-being-abandoned

Allegedly, the devs were asking for good reviews of the game and doing some ""heavy moderating"" ie. censoring of negative critique, on their forums.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/2jspdu/paranautical_activity_devs_begging_for_good/

The offending dev claimed he was ""quitting the video game industry."" 
However, he is already working on 2 new games:

It
is
bad.

You pay 10 bucks for a full game, that gives you 0 motivation or exciting gameplay. While the beginning is boring and you often die to bosses, the end just slaps you in your face and makes you run around, shooting everywhere at the same time, hoping you hit enemies.

Countless bugs occur during this time, such as getting stuck in walls or having a constant 5 FPS when there is too much stuff on the screen. ( I run Black Ops 3 on ultra settings, so no, it is not my PC ).

After uninstalling the game and wasting over 2 hours on it, I cannot reccommend this game at all.
The gameplay is boring and repetitive, the Wiki unfinished, thus leaving you puzzled when picking up items and the balance is non existant.

Oh and the soundtrack will drive you insane after 1 hour.

For me: 7/10 For others 3/10

Let's just be honest right off the bat: you might not like this game. It's not nearly as replayable as other roguelikes, maybe 20 hours at most. it's very repetetive, which is something I personally am okay with, but many people aren't. The power ups aren't interesting, the gameplay is pretty good, even if it's just strafing in a circle for every boss or room, dodging is annoying especially with homing shots. for homing shots, the only way to dodge it is cling against the wall so the bullet flies into the wall. There are some things in the game that make it very laggy, making me rush to kill the boss before it lags too hard ( talking about the snail boss ). it's not well optimized for sure. But it's fun to play in my opinion! Like, it's almost literally binding of Isaac in FPS form!

This game is not for everyone. It requires patience, reflexes and somewhat grinding for achievements - therefore the items. 

Now if you are not a fan of rogue-like, action genre, this game wouldn't be the best match for you. If you are, however and want to have some fun, this game suits your needs perfectly.

I will start with saying that the game is really hard. This doesn't make the game frustrating though. After you get the grasp of the mechanics and familiar with the items, it will be only a matter of time to finish the game. 

David Bowie (RIP) is a playable character in this game (Though I don't think he would appreciate the choice of soundtrack.). 

Gameplay is fast-paced. That means there will be times you won't even understand how you died or took massive amount of damage. So never rely on your health being full. You always need to be alert and keep your reflexes up because the ways to die in this game are just too many.

Like most of the rogue-like dungeon crawlers, RNG factor is significant. Game has six different characters with a huge item pool. There are many things that could make reaching the end a piece of cake. You can get the most OP items on the first floors, you can pray to RNG gods and get some ridiculous stats with the passive items,  you can find the boss room without too much wandering around the rooms and these thing also could make the runs really hard vica-versa.  

Simple, pixelated, yet colorful graphics makes the game charming and kind of fits the style of the game itself, in my opinion. 

Music is... well, it is dubstep. Depends on your approach to electro music. Although I don't like dubstep myself, it fits the fast-paced theme and makes you randomly jump and shoot to everyone and everywhere, because the groove is real.

There is a sprint button, yet it completely fucks with your aim. Doom also had a sprint command but in Doom you can't look up or down and your weapon ""auto-locks) on the enemies you aim at.

Just like in The Binding of Isaac, this game plays on several different floors, each with rooms that have to be cleared before proceeding into the next room, each floor with two bosses, one of which is optional and rewards the player with an additional power-up.

The graphic is quite simplistic, yet is nicely colourful and blends well with the very arcadish sound effects and the not-deplorable dubstep soundtrack.
Regarding the soundtrack... I can't abstain from admitting that the quality isn't great: it's dubstep, raw, crude, pumping and absolutely ""videogame-like"". The final product is an OST that is hardly playable outside of the game, but if you let it run on background as you play, if you can bare with it for a while without getting an headache, it becomes a fantastic soundtrack that only makes you more and more eager to keep playing this apparently mediocre videogame.

Paranautical Activity isn't for everyone, it's an hardcore game that will surely faze any casual gamer in matter of minutes: this game is unforgiving, it requires fast reflexes, great aim and ability to adapt to the new. The dozens of power-ups and the repetitive yet different level design can offer a new experience each and every new playthrough; on top of this, the player can choose up to six different characters, each with its own stats (such as health, speed, power, etc.).

As final note, the customisation in terms of graphic and sound options is minimal, however, it is possible to modify the FoV (Field of View) from 30 to 150.
If you need ratings:

Graphic: 6/10
Sounds: 7/10
Gameplay: 8/10

It can be great fun a lot of the time, but you will find yourself dying for stupid reasons more often than not... not once did I die and think that it was my fault, but instead usually down to some stupid item I picked up not knowing what it did and completely killed my run. For example;

The ""Eye of Dubbbz"" item. I got to stage 7 and picked this up. It made all of the rooms completely pitch-black (until the end of the game). I literally just quit. Why is that even in the game? That's a stupid idea for an item, especially when rooms become more cluttered with obstacles so you run into walls like the Kool-Aid man and die

+ Skill-based gameplay which is fun
+ Movement is spot-on 
+ Music is AMAZING (Produced by MACAskill) 
+ Weapons are fun for the most part and each have their different gimmick
+ Punny names for weapons and items which is cool

- Classes are basic and just have different health & armour, weapon, and speed.
- Nazi levels seem out of place
- Bad items that are there just to be bad and ruin your experience
- Gameplay isn't addicting like other rougelikes
- Exploding enemies can spawn in front of you as the enter the room

Paranautical Activity is mostly a game about movement, and I love how a lot of the items such as the Recoil Rifle allow for some top tier gameplay, To make the classes more unique I think each class should start with a specific movement item (Such as dash, double jump, small etc)

The aesthetic of this game is also confusing... it's like a nazi, pirate, demon shooter? What?

TLDR: It's a fun game, but I recommend you get this game on the cheapest sale and give the rest of the money to MACAskill (the music producer), as they shafted him out of payment and basically took his music.

The moths are what you need to look out for because there shots home in on you and these shots WILL hit you and the WILL lower your health to zero eventually if you don't concentrate on dodging there shots these two enemys aren't that bad but they're the only really difficult enemys in this game.

Bosses are strange some bosses are easy and basically the only way to get hit by the easy ones is if you stop circle strafing around them.

The only bosses you need to look out for are the ones with homing shots because they fire a lot and if you aren‚Äôt glued to a wall and moving fast your dead for sure. The other hard bosses are the ones that melee you because those ones fly right at you and deal damage and if you aren't moving fast and jumping constantly your dead for sure. However if they aren't FLYING towards you and are just something like a skeleton or something they aren't a problem at all.

So bosses and enemys are alright just might need to change a few of their attacks to make the easy ones harder (recommended change) or the hard ones easier (not recommended change)  to stop making the easy boss fights feel like a circle strafing chore.  

Now lets look at the bad part. The items often horribly unbalanced and some items being flat out jokes that do almost nothing is AWFUL.

There is one item in this game called Doxxy that will put me off this game until it gets removed completely. The item changes the sound that you hear when you get hit. That‚Äôs. It. You went through an entire blue skull room boss fight where it was that moth with homing shots and you barely made it out alive? Well here‚Äôs this completely useless item! You saved up all your money to buy an item in the shop? Well this item is free! It's also useless and takes up 1 of 3 slots in the shop! You only get to items in the shop this time! Should have gotten lucky and had a random dice power up drop so you can reroll this item. 

There are so many items that just plain suck. The one that flips gravity when you jump (makes the billion jump upgrades useless cuz you can't really jump anymore)
Doxxy 
The one that permanently lowers your speed for a couple of very temporary armor pieces (speed is essential if you aren't going fast then you WILL easily get your health gradually lowered to zero by moths and stuff. See above where I mention that speed is important to fight the bosses and enemys.).  
Rage which is a damage up when you kill enemys! What could be wrong with that? Well, it's also a damage down. It is many damage downs. Every 10 seconds or so it lowers your damage by 0.083~ I think and when you kill enemys it increases damage by the same amount lowered so if you aren‚Äôt constantly instakilling enemys then you are losing damage. You can't insta kill with this item because its lowering your damage. 

Not to mention the item pickup tip for rage simply says ""Damage up for killing enemys"" and doesn't mention this damage down I'm glad I looked at the pdf file supplied that explains items. If I hadn't done that I would think this item was good!

Same with Fool, an item of which simply says ""doubles damage"" on pickup and doesn't mention that enemys deal double damage too! I could imagine myself spending hours ingame with the fool item dying quickly and not realizing it was fool's fault. (Fool is a good item because of an item called kamikaze which turns those normally useless bombs your carrying into armor and deals damage to enemy that melee you. The downside to kamikaze is that it completely removes your health so if you don't have any bombs and you get hit you die. The whole idea behind kamikaze is that if you now spend health to shoot bombs but bombs require so many upgrades that you wouldn't be shooting them even if you didn't have kamikaze. 

I would often find myself getting kamikaze and running around with 40 bombs that I wont use because I have 40 health and it would take so long to get me to zero that the final boss is a cakewalk. I could even take fool to insta kill everyone and it would STILL take a long time to die. bombs are more plentiful then hearts as you can blow up explosive barrels get a 3 hp up at almost any time. 

The other way of getting health is to take some health upgrades. The two I found were this one that doubles your health but lowers your speed. Because your speed is lower you are going to get hit easier and speed ups are so rare that this is never worth taking. The other just gives you two health and some armor which helps but both of these are nothing compared to kamikaze.  

I would say that kamikaze=win and if you don't get it you will have so many awful items thrown at your way that it's basically restart for kamikaze.

I can name a lot more if I look at which item does in the little pdf file that says what every item does but that would be boring to see me explain why almost every item you find is bad. 

So a few items are good and the majority are bad.


The point of item systems in roguelikes are that these items change gameplay and keep it interesting and a lot of these items have potential but are so imbalanced that they aren't worth taking and it turns the game into a restart early to get good items fest which is bad because this means that all your runs are the same because your taking the same items every time. This run is the same every time feeling is magnified by the low number of rooms the made for each floor. The number of rooms they made are so low that I found myself memorizing enemy spawn locations in only a few hours of playing.

Because of the sheer amount of bad items in this game the devs have a lot of stuff to fix. I heard that they are spending most of there time right now adding net co-op but I'd say if you wan't to fix this game then ditch the co-op idea for now and spend all your time on balancing these items and removing doxxy. 

I got this game on sale for 3 dollars and it's so bad because of the item system. I don't think this game is even worth 3 dollars as pressing the restart button over and over again isnt fun. If I wanted to press the same button over and over again I would just play cookie clicker.

TL;DR \/\/\/\/\/

Pros
+FOV slider goes from 30 to way to high
+music is nice

Cons
-enemys are easy except for one or 2
-bosses are either easy or really hard and there's only 2 or 3 hard bosses. 
-The items are so bad that it encourages restarting 
-music is nice but it isn't tied to floors or rooms or anything it's litterally like they just took some youtube playlist and put it in the game. There is no boss fight music
-I met the system requirements but expereinced harsh lag on lowest graphics because when you kill things the fall into a million cubes some times on later levels these squares become so plentiful that it becomes unbearable
-game sounds are underwhelming. I looked at the credits and it had links to sites like freesounds which makes me feel like they just searched a shotgun sound . mp3 in google  and downloaded the first thing they saw
-item pickup tips are helpful sometimes but other times don't mention a that an item has a secret bad effect. This encorages reading the pdf guide that comes with the game which means playing this game blind is a bad Idea
-speed is essential for dodging and so many items lower this stat that most of the items become useless the game does have good movement but this good movement is gone if you take too many speed down items 

Yes, the only good thing about this game is the fov slider and maybe one or two of the enemys.",1445824306,1445824378,False,13,0,0.4006824791431427,0,True,False,False,False,,,

By slipery movement, I mean that when you let go of the movement key, you keep moving about a foot untill you stop. 1 Foot may not seem like much, but being that platforms and catwalks are only about 6-feet accross in this game, it ain't a pleasant feature. Couple that with one third of the framerate of Minecraft (I can run MC at 60, this game at 25, dropping down into single digits) and you have a very rage-inducing combo.

Cringe-worth eh? Padded: Tampon picture, Heh Heh Heh: 69, ParaNUT, stupid pun, you get the idea. Now that I look at it, I'm nitpicking at the names, but answer me this: Why did the game need achievements in the first place? Is such a short (Per playthrough) game not interesting enough without them?

IMO; Get one of these instead, they both are far better games: http://store.steampowered.com/app/266110/

so messed up the game was taken down by steam and then brought up later by some publisher
they cheated their own music composer guy out of the pay
he put so many personal dreams on hold because he was told he would get pay'd (keep in mind he was VERY GOOD at his job aka songs are good)

This game is a FPS with fast paced combat and randomly generated maps.
The best way to describe the gameplay would be taking the the movement and gunplay from Quake and putting it in The Binding of Isaac, where you walk through randomly generated mazes constituted by many small arenas linked together.
It's a great idea but unfortunately this game sucks.

Even though the game is randomly generated it gets old really quickly since there isn't that many enemies or rooms. The lack of variety is evident ever since your first playthrough.

Most of the weapons in the game feel rather powerless or too slow. Even when they're actually effective, like the demoman's grenade launcher, they still feel unsatisfying and awkward due to the lack of sound effects and impact. In my opinion this is a huge problem since most of the fun you could have with the game simply vanishes.

There's not much to be said about the graphics and the sound either. It's pretty much what you see on the trailer, except not nearly as exciting.

I also get a terrible headache everytime I spend more than 15 minutes playing it. That doesn't happen when I'm playing Quake or Ziggurat. Go figure.",1438698481,1438698481,False,29,0,0.491643965244293213,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- Buena eleccion de hacerlo en habitaciones para ir subiendo niveles.

Now where is the Doom part and the Quake part because I didn't see any! The game plays more like a slow paced modern shooter than a fast paced old-school shooter. The shooting feels bland. The randomized rooms feel repetitive. Also, strafing and jumping feel kinda clunky. Just on par with other crappy so called ""old-school"" indie FPS such as Rogue Shooter and Wrack.

Aside from that, there is at least one thing Paranautical Activity is good at : heating my graphic card like crazy...

If you're in need of some modern FPS with an old-school feeling made by indie developpers give a chance to one of these games :

-Hard Reset (2011)
-Serious Sam BFE (2011)
-Shadow Warrior (2013)
-Eldritch (2013)
-Tower of Guns (2014)
-Ziggurat (2014)

Gabe Newworld did a great job for getting rid of this atrocity from the Steam store. Too bad it came back to haunt the living as a ""Deluxe Edition"" because I am now experiencing ""paranormal activity"", not Paranautical Activity...

    [*] Only 3 starting classes ( one is too slow to even progress far)
    [*] Not much variety in weapons or enemies (most enemies and bosse were too easy to kill)
    [*] The mechanics of this game don't feel fun to me ( gunplay is weak)
    [*] Got to level 4, then game crashed ( had my recorder on, could of been the problem)
    [*] Your speed determines if you win or not ( brings the true class count to 2)

Very good idea and very fun game but sadly ""ditched"" from its developer due a discussion with Valve's CEO (Yes, Papa Gabe). After that discussion caused by Valve labeling the game as ""Released"" instead ""Early-Access"", the game got removed from steam and re-added 4 months after under ""Digerati marketing"" , a distribution company. But sadly since then (feb '15, and to be precise the last update it's dated Oct '14) the game hasn't been updated once.

[b]So, before further talking let's go on with the recension.[/b]

[h1]Appearance:[/h1]

[b]Graphics:[/b] 2/5
Menu appearance it's not one of the best. Also in-game huds are way too ""simple"" in their appearance despite their ""Cubic 32-bit"" style. A graphical enhancement would be really appreciated.

[b]Sounds:[/b] 3/5
Not so much to say about sounds, the music it's really nice but sorta repetitive during the whole floor, maybe add a boss and mini-boss music?

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

[b]Classes:[/b] 4/5
Paranautical Activity grants the player a bunch of playable classes that can get unlocked by completing achievements and each one of them it's really different in their weapon and stats.

[b]Movements:[/b] 5/5
The character it's really easy to control thanks also to items pickup that grants you the ability to double-jump etc.. Watch out for snowy levels and falling platforms! ;)

[b]Longevity:[/b] 3/5
Not so much to say here neither, the game it's really fun but after a while playing it becomes slightly repetitive.

[b]Bugs:[/b] 2/5
As already said in the introduction the was supposed to be an Early-Access instead of a release, it has a lot of bugs and glitch like Monsters getting stuck under staircases, double doors, glitch with powerups etc... But despite that i won't give a lot of weight to this voice because the game it was and still is a beta. 

[b]OVERALL: 3/5[/b]

Would I recommend this game? Yes. Would I recommend it for 9‚Ç¨? No.
It's a really fun game but developers ditched it by not updating it anymore, It's a really nice mixture of Fps and Roguelike and definitely fun to play if you enjoy both genres. But still.. in its conditions it's not really worthed 9‚Ç¨ if you want to get it, i suggest you to wait until it'll be in sale.

- Decent music
- Decent enemy variety
- Items and other stuff to find through out the dungeons
- OK boss fights

Cons:
- All of the weapons suck, usually difficult to aim or use, lack impact and are never multi-purpose. Trying to use any of the 4 main weapons to fight most of the enemies is a real challenge. 
- Classes are pretty useless. They all seem to be extremes with only 1 balanced class. Other classes include, guy with 1 hp, guy who moves slower than a rock, guy with ultra useless weapon.
- Extremely repetitive locations. Every room is the same as the last and it's the same shade of blue most of the game. 
- Floaty controls, the movement just feels wrong. View bobbing is annoying too.
- Colliding with oddly placed staircases and other pointless structures.

Overall:
I don't recommend this game. Each play session is so damn short it's ridiculous. No matter how many times i try and with any of the classes, I rarely make it to the 3rd floor. Often getting hit by things I can't even see or are unable to dodge with the slower classes. It lacks content, isn't very fun and gets very repetitive very quickly. Unless you like shooting the same enemies in the same rooms with the same 4 textures using awful weapons, stay away from this game. There are many better shooters out there. The roguelike elements aren't used in any interesting way here either. Just another excuse to stretch out a game's length when it otherwise lacks content and substance.",1433906159,1433906159,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

But let's put that aside and talk about what the game IS and not its troubled release history.

Paranautical Activity is a first person roguelike. From a gameplay perspective it borrows a lot from The Binding of Isaac, notably the room grid approach where the player needs to defeat all enemies in a room to progress instead of moving freely in a continuous level like in other roguelikes. And like Binding of Isaac, each floor has a boss at the end as well as optional minibosses. The first first person perspective alone and the three-dimensional design of rooms makes the game very action oriented and keeps you on your toes.

EDIT: Although what I said here is true, I'd like you to ignore it. I was able to fix the problem with not opening. It still for some reason on macs it seems, freezes whenever you get an unlock in game or a steam achievement. I'm not sure how to fix it. I find that the game that you can actually play itself is really fun and interesting and amazing. But I keep crashing so until I either 100% it's gonna keep doing this.

Paranautical Activity began to pick up traction within the Steam community, but then went off the rails after one of the two developers went on a childish twitter rampage against Steam and had [url= http://www.vg247.com/2014/10/21/steam-gabe-newell-death-threat-paranautical-activity/]the game pulled after a comment about killing Gabe Newell[/url]/
Much like Fez, despite all the nonsense and bad publicity because of a developer, Paranautical Activity is still a pretty unique, adrenalin pumping fast blast of a game.

[h1]Highlights[/h1]

* Excellent timing/pace and very quick off the mark
* Unique enemies and design
* One helluva Soundtrack

[h1]Mistakes[/h1]

* There's a sentiment from Steam gamers to avoid this title because of the twitter comments and attitude of the former developer. While I personally think the former developer was a childish idiot, I separate my choice to purchase a product from any attitude or conceptions I have on people involved with the creation of a product. For some people the attitudes of people working for a company go hand in hand with their choice to purchase products from that company, and may take issue. However the the developers are no longer involved and the title has [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/250580/discussions/0/611698195153627563/]now near-completely changed hands[/url].
* There are noticably too few enemies, and arguably a lack of weapons, which means gameplay becomes repetitive after long stretches.

Pros:

Cons:
> None of the classes seem very significant and are all hard to control
> There's no storyline
> It's hard as balls to get play
> There are other reasons, but other reviewers seem to have covered them pretty damn well

><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><

I admit that I haven't played all that much of the game, but from what I COULD all I discovered that it is immensly easy to die and is almost insanely hard to get even a single power up.  Also most of the ""Abilities"" you can get have no explanation and don't seem to affect anything upon use.  There's not even a stat menu to see if any of the power ups have changed them.  

And did I mention how easy it is to die?  Most of the beginning weapons barely have any effect on the enemies sometimes and it's almost like you lose health way too fast in some encounters.  You can survive for a much longer time in the Binding of Isaac compared to this game.  Not only that, but everytime you die it doesn't even feel like you've accomplished anything.  I know the point of a Rogue-Like is that you only have one life to do everything, but this game takes that aspect way too seriously that it feels pointless to even try.  

As for the storyline... well... WHAT STORYLINE?  

I don't know who I am, where I'm going, or what I'm even doing this for.  There's really no point in doing whatever ""Mission"" I'm trying to do if there's no real goal in mind.  I'd say to get this game if it had a great storyline despite the weird and often annoying gameply, but since it doesn't even have THAT then I don't recommend that anyone really get this.  

The only redeeming feature are the graphics, and while I admire that, it takes a bit more than fancy creatures and pixel guns to make a game work.

Originally taken down due to shitty  devs, and reuploaded for god knows what reason. I purchased this game when there was a rouge-like sale going on, and even though it was only about $2.50, I regret it. Now, before I go one, I have to preface this by saying that I played the Tank 99% of the time. I greatly enjoy heavy characters, and From the stats I thought I would enjoy playing as him the most. I did, as the others were shit. However, whenever the Tank fires his shotgun, theres a full second of the game registering the damage or if it hit or whatever, where the game entirely freezes up. This mostly happens on larger enemies, but it makes the game utterly unplayable due to it. You stop, and the game doesnt. Id be fine with this if it was purposefully implemented, but its clearly not as when you attack smaller enemies or hit with fewer pellets, the game doesnt freeze. The cannon on the other hand is completely worthless even without a glitch, not that it doesnt have one. When firing the cannon, sometimes there will be a visible projectile but sometimes there wont be a charge up time OR a projectile, just immediately dealing damage to whatevers in front of you. It makes the gun entirely unpredictable, which is not a good thing in a game about avoiding death. Bomb's usefulness varies from very good against slower enemies, to absolutely worthless on bosses and slightly faster enemies. A major MAJOR problem in the game, however, is the fact that not every class can beat every boss. While playing as the slow Tank, I encountered a snail-like boss that immediately curled up and unrelentingly rolled at me, much faster than I could move out of its path while it immediately snaps to wherever I run, making the entire fight a DPS race which is NOT A GOOD THING. It might be that I just didnt figure out some secret strategy of beating it, but that's a moot point. There is no point in making a game unplayable just for the sake of difficulty. 
There's some good things about the game, for as much as Im harshing on it: The concept of an FPS Roguelike is a very fun one that has tons of potential, of which they use none. The graphics are very adorable, giving even what are supposed to be hideous monsters a very huggable and blocky appearance.

Roguelike?  FPS?  Cool voxel graphics and that 'simplistic but awesome' lighting system reminiscent of games like Quake?  Multiple classes to choose from?  It's just too good to be true, it seems... and sadly, that's the case.

It COULD have been good, could have easily been fixed and polished and balanced just a bit to create a fantastic experience, but in all the months and months I've had this game in its early access phase and even now after this 're-release', it's failed to address any of these issues.  In fact, all it seemingly HAS done is added a couple new enemies, achievements, and made shop prices even more impossibly high.  Great.

The main issue is that it's simply too difficult.  No, NOT ""haha hardcore fun!"" difficult like your Dark Souls or Binding of Isaacs out there, but cheap, excruciatingly painful and unforgivably frustratingly difficult.  From the beginning of the game most rooms are PACKED with unreasonable amounts of every variety of monster and there is little strategy beyond  moving around wildly and hoping dearly that you don't lose too much health (which is generally far too difficult to come by, besides) as you struggle to fight back.

If you're not lucky enough to be wildly powerful by the 3rd or 4th floors you're likely screwed, and by the 5th floor?  Forget about it.  I've never, ever been able to pass the 5th floor of this game in the tons of times I've attempted it, no matter how perfect my drops were, and this is coming from a guy who Platinum God'd the original Binding of Isaac and did all but the Lost achivements in the Rebirth version of that game.  I know FPS skills =/= overhead shooter skills, but I'd like to think my FPS ability is at least decent considering how many thousands of hours I've put into that genre over the last 15+ years and it proves I know how to weigh options, gauge danger, memorize enemy patterns and tackle various situations in action-roguelikes as a whole.. but no, I've never gotten past floor 5.  And I've only gotten TO it like three times ever, for that matter.

The problem is, by the time you get there, so many enemies are... well, they are very fast, charge you, and deal damage so fast that there is NOTHING you can do about it.  No matter how fast you kill, they're coming from all angles, many types, and with traps on top of that.  And if they get to you, one of these melee enemies, from the sharks near the beginning of the game to the skulls and imps later to the chainsaw boss that you're almost certainly screwed if you ever fight?  The damage is so rapid that it's going to be all over, no matter HOW much health you have.  The game sorely needs a 1-2 second invulnerability period between taking damage, especially with how low the health values are, how much damage you'll invariably take simply exploring the dungeons, and how few and far between health restoratives are.  But no, once you're in the jaws of one of these melee enemies it's ALL gone nearly instantly, even if you're a tank with 15+ health and 10+ shield which should be an incredibly beefy amount -- it'll all be gone in about 5 seconds and you most likely won't be able to kill them in time to escape it even with tons of damage boosting passives.

And did I mention they (aside from the sharks) are FAST?  Like, so fast that you won't be able to outrun them without loads of speed passives.  And did I mention that these passives only drop from bosses and shops, most the boss passives are jokes and you won't be able to afford 90% of the good shop passives by the time you get that deep even if you clear out every single room in every level up till then?  And that you'll DOUBTLESSLY have to buy some of the lesser passives as you just barely scrounge up the money to do so if you even want a vague hope of REACHING that floor to begin with?  Yeah.

So there you have it.  An exercise in frustration in which you're going to be suffering through gauntlets of way too many enemies per room in such placements and combination that it's virtually impossible to avoid damage no matter how good you are, difficulty restoring the damage you took, and the knowledge that it's quickly going to become too overwhelming to even have any hope of moving forward no matter how good you are or how good the items you find are.  And no, it's not something you're going to learn and get better at despite the excrutiating difficulty like a GOOD action-roguelike; you're just going to suffer.

Firstly, the concept: It's basically a bullet-hell game in-first person, giving you an incredibly poor idea of where you are in relation to all the projectiles that are incoming from every angle and making it distressingly common that you sidestrafe into an obstacle, get stuck and eat a face full of projectile salvo.

Secondly, the graphical/UI design: Pretty much everything that isn't a projectile is the same colour of shadowy gray-ish mess, meaning that about the only way to spot enemies is their glowing eyes(when they have them), which are obscured by the helpful volleys of glowing projectiles all over the damn place.

Thirdly, it's a high-paced, dodging-heavy shooter... in a game where every single area is a cramped cube often further obstructed by stairs and similar. This one should speak for itself.

And then there are just all the gameplay issues. For instance, on the third level I encounter a melee-attacking boss who moves so fast that even at constant sprint away from him, even bunny-hopping, he constantly catches up with me and hits me. There's literally no way to avoid damage, hitting him doesn't slow him down, Nothing does. Your only hope of beating him is that your damage output and soaking ability beats his, which is entirely down to what pickups you've been lucky enough to get.

Did anyone ever playtest this? Or did they just slap a bunch of things together and go: ""FAST-PACED MUSIC. PIXEL ARTSTYLE. IT'S A WINNER.""?

The music's pretty nice, though, so there is that.

(Also why would you saddle one of the playable options with a melee weapon when every single enemy is either charging towards you to make its own melee attacks or constantly vomiting bullets? It's impossible to use it without taking damage.)",1427382080,1427382080,False,1,0,0.490665853023529053,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is not polished, it has many bugs, it has really poor optimization. And the devs first mocked with people, then mocked with Gabe. then got kicked out, then sold the game to a different publisher in its unfinished state.

Yeah aim of the developers is not reached since they lack basic courtesy. Anyway, what was that aim? It was simply replicating BoI in FPS setting. Shops, bombs, most of the skills and upgrades were designed on this. This is not bad, since BoI is really fun, but this does not add anything original to the genre either. Every addition came from some other roguelike, e.g Ghost from Spelunky. It is good knowing that developers also like the games I like and many likes, but a collection of features from some well known very well executed games to build a buggy, unfinished mess is completely different thing.

What is the original side of the game? To be fair it has two. First, its art style. User interface and menus are poorly designed, and game plays like the worst possible Unity example once can imagine, so expect stutters when passing through different menus. But in game voxel art is not that bad, and it feels unique. Also the soundtracks are not that bad, and distinct from other roguelike games. But being unique is not always a good thing, check some gameplay videos first, you may not like dubstep at the end.

I am not a good FPS player, so I did not reach past floor 3, but it is not necessary to finish the game to see that this game is abandonware. Any obvious no brainer bug will be there until eternity while new publishers find publishing the new version with a gameplay video and a pdf file rather than some content wise and bug crushing patch.

If u LOVE FPS and also LOVE binding of isaac, u may enjoy this a little, if u also are good with ignoring its bugs. If your feeling towards one of those two is more mediocre, u are advised to go and play some other FPS-roguelike. I can also advice you some other FPS roguelikes, since I have tried many:

Deducted points go exclusively for graphics, sometimes making it diffictult to understand wtf is going on and how big explosions are.

Is it a fun game? I'd say so. It's fast paced, action-packed and the graphics are surprisingly unique. However, there's just too much I personally don't enjoy for me to keep playing. I'm all for hard games, but in some parts, the difficulty spikes in unfair ways. I'm not even talking about the bosses, which, while cliche (flying skulls? really?), are fun and pleasantly challenging. I'm referring to enemies like the land sharks that are nearly impossible to hit and can grind your health away in seconds after noiselessly charging you in packs of 5 or 6. Another issue I had was the item system. Some items, when activated, seem to do absolutely nothing. I'm sure they were performing some function, but some feedback or even a short bio displayed when picking up the item would have been appreciated. Also why does the sword use ammo? That's nitpicking, I'll admit, but something just seems odd about that to me, especially since it appears to be just a standard medieval sword. While fun, Paranautical Activity doesn't really enough to keep me playing for more than half an hour or so.

However, as ubiquitous as roguelikes have become in the last few years on PC, there have been few to try it in an FPS, and fewer still that succeed when they try. Paranautical Activity was actually one of the first as it went through Early Access, but controversy stemming from the game‚Äôs original developer delayed its full release to just recently, when a new publisher bought the rights to the title. It‚Äôs a good thing too, because Paranautical Activity feels like Doom made in a different age, and certainly deserves recognition for setting the standard of what a procedurally generated shooter should be.

And frankly, this game isn't too bad. It's just not... fun and doesn't feel too interesting. Think Doom and Binding Of Isaac, but with a worse Health system, weapons that feel powerless at times, and surprisingly bad frame drops.

Paranautical Activity (Deluxe Atonement, for its re-release after the whole ""threatening Gabe Newell"" thing), is a rogue-lite FPS game. It takes notes from Doom and Binding Of Isaac, yet it seems to do it in ways that work against the game. While it does use its inspiration in a decent manner (fast paced shooting, randomized rooms and floors, varying stats on each character), it also just... doesn't.

Weapons feel decent to use, although some of them are absurdly weak. The shotgun, from my point of view, felt like the biggest letdown of all the weapons, with the bow being powerful at one or two-hitting enemies.

Power-ups feel nice too when you find out what they do. With next to no context as to what they do, you're basically gambling your run (just like Isaac).

Enemies are... alright. Mostly tedious to deal with, since some range from simple ""fire a bolt, wait for a while, rinse and repeat"" to ""Is this Touhou?"". Surprisingly, the most annoying enemy I faced was the floor sharks. Why? Tank-y characters can't dodge well and with the floor sharks, I've ended up being juggled by them, shooting them with a shotgun that did abysmal damage, until I either died or survived with a massive chunk of health gone.

Levels are pretty much the same square box with randomised preset props and enemies are dumped in when you enter. Nothing to write home about, except for what could amount to some problem with moving under staircases. Ended up getting stuck there and the AI seems to have the same problem. And I mean stuck in a way that feels like when your clothes gets stuck on a door handle and janks you back. There also seems to be some odd dissonance with the enemies that spawn in some rooms? Sometimes you get enemies who spawn in that get stuck in parts of the level geometry and just kinda... sits there... like the aforementioned stairs.

The characters have different spawn weapons, health and speed, meaning that you have some variety in what you can do and can't do. And by variety, it boils down to how far you can get with the fast characters. I mentioned above that the tank-y characters are slow. They got extra health to offset the lack of agility, but that trade off is imbalanced. Along with some of the characters getting weapons which would be ideal for fast ones, since they promote ""attack-retreat"" tactics. However they work against the character, requiring them to take risks that never really pay off due to the weak weaponry. Compared to the bow or the sickle, the shotgun feels like that Penny Arcade comic about videogame shotguns, except the shotgun is shooting gumdrops at pointblank.

The bosses are... okay. They look interesting, but their design and looks are pretty much meaningless, since most of them just shoot at you non-stop, until they spawn enemies or do some third thing that makes them marginally different. And,honestly they could be interesting if most of them didn't feel like a palette swap. They just move around the area and shoot, not really doing anything else, than maybe a specific animation set to the model. Which sucks, cause the bosses I fought looked really interesting and were creatively designed (aesthetically, anyway).

Is the game itself worth it even after all complaints and negatives? If you've run out of rogue-lite games it could be. If there's some more tweaks to the game, such as a revamped health system, characters and weapons being buffed, as well as some changes to make bosses less dependent on luck or power-ups along with making them more mechanically interesting, it could be a decent game. Also the menu font is atrocious. And the menu looks really amateurish, like stock Unity asset bland.

Was I satisfied with the product? No. I felt like I bought a game that could've benefitted from more time in Early Access or even an extended time or open beta or even a massive overhaul. Hopefully, some patches since this review was written has made the game more fun to play and less annoying to deal with.

Mainly bought it for the advertised co-op, but the dev decided to cancel that. And the recent update forced a ""Ghost"" on the player, where it spawns if you take too long, forcing the player to speed run rather than plan ahead. If the Ghost get's altered to where it's optional or get's moved to some sort of Speed-run/Hardcore mode, I'll remove that complaint, but the advertised co-op canceled is a big slap on the face,

I personally wouldn't recommend it out of principle, but in the interest of fairness, this is a nice fast paced action game with permadeath, though the Ghost is annoying.

[b]Edit 1:[/b] In a post on the forum, the dev claims he will be putting out patch that will make the Ghost only appear after you beat the game once, THEN it's forced on you with no other option than to delete your save(and cloud), to start over. It's not like there's some sort of progression system, but it's an annoying hurdle. Dev said that new players hate it, but 'veterans' love it, which I think is big assumption  thinking that only vets love it and noobs hate it. Whatever, this post will be updated when he updates and I'll add on details on his choice.

Oh, and by 'no progression system', I meant progression that carries over between games. There's plenty of power-ups that make you stronger or have more health, speed, etc.

[b]Edit 2:[/b] Firstly, I was wrong about the progression system. There's an 'unlocks' menu that shows a bunch of things you can do and it'll unlock various things like weapons, characters, powerups, items, new starting/findable items for specific characters, and game modes. I think it's a very nice system.

For the Ghost part: There are 3 game modes. Classic has no Ghost and you can't reach the 8th floor. Hardcore mode has both the 8th floor and the Ghost. And Infinite mode, which is basically Hardcore mode, but when you complete the 8th floor, you loop back to the first. Not sure of all the details for Infinite mode, but thats the basic gist of it.

Paranautical Activity is a first-person shooter roguelike set on a nazi U-Boat. If you like shooters there is plenty here to enjoy, if you like roguelikes there's even more, and no two runs will likely ever be the same. Being a roguelike, each of the eight stages is filled with procedurally generated rooms. These rooms are filled with an increasingly difficult selection of enemies, along with a boss, a sub boss, a shop, and bonus rooms with various bonuses and challenges. Each floor is also a race against the clock to beat the the boss and progress before an unkillable phantom comes to hurry you along under threat of murder.

There are several playable characters, each with unique play styles. Some, such as Gorton, require precision but do crazy amounts of damage; and others, such as Dy-No-Mite, allow for a more loose play style at the cost of self-destructive splash damage. There is a selection of super weapons that range from a ninja sword that wrecks shop up close, a cannon that demolishes most things, and a gun that uses its ammunition to create more health, bombs, and armor.

There is a wide selection of items that can help you along (and more than a few that will make your going much tougher). Some can make you immune to explosions. Some can basically remove the cap on your rate of fire. Some can give you much more health at the cost of your speed. Some can make all floors dark. Some can do nothing other than change your character's injured sound to a selection of girlish ""Ooches"" and ""Ouches.""

The varied enemy design ranges from rocket-propelled turtles that fire missiles, glowing monkeys that jump back and forth between the floor and ceiling, and sharks that hunger for your feet. Bosses range from a pair of flying eyeballs that divide themselves when they die, a battleship with kamikaze planes circling it, and a nazi scientist that can resurrect the dead.

Though the game doesn't officially release until around halloween, the final content patch just went live a few hours ago, so I feel comfortable finally officially recommending this game to anyone who enjoys the concepts behind it's design. If you like shooters, I recommend this game. If you like roguelikes, I definitely recommend this game. If you like games that marry the two concepts, then I can't imagine why you wouldn't love this game.",1411823728,1411862783,True,5,1,0.545761644840240479,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I do recomend this game, it is worth buying even though everyone else says it is not.
I would recomend it however, to wait until it is on sale or on another humble bundle to avoid spending too much for something that isn't your taste.

So this review is to reflect -current- gameplay and content.

I have greatly enjoyed Paranautival Activity, and it has probably frustrated me about as much as Binding of Isaac has with regards to finding hard bosses, picking up bad items for my build, etc.
If you like games similar to Binding of Isaac or Tower of Guns, this one is a great middle ground. The weapons all have their own advantages (Personally, the sickle is the best weapon in the game hands down) and each item is useful in its own right and can add interesting or frustrating abilities. For example, one item gives you the same jumping mechanic as VVVVVV has, that is, switching gravity and standing on the ceiling instead of jumping. It's cool, but can be a huge pain sometimes.

The enemies are all interesting and difficult in their own right, and certain builds will find some enemies easier than others. I'd give the graphics, gameplay and amount of current content a good 8/10. I'm extremely excited about more stuff being released when the time comes, as I'm sure I'll come back to this game more.

A lot of the trobule is you are constantly surrounded by enemies, which normally is'nt so bad, but like most FPS when you take damage there is usually a damage indicator, so you know which direction to turn and shoot, not with Paranautical Activity, so you figure that you'll use explosives to handle everything, well that's where another game breaking flaw shows it's ugly head, when you kill an enemy it burst into red pixels that skatter onto the floor and stay there for a few seconds, not bad right? Well every explosion also has a particle effect to the same degree, just orange pixels, so if you kill a group of enemies with an explosion you're in for a lot of particles, and unfourtately the game can't take all the pixels on screen, so it starts to lag real bad, and I know it's not my computer, because I can run games like Skyrim, and Dark Souls with no problems.

Just as the developers have never really shown love and in the middle of this conflict between the players and the developers is a game that had unlimited potential. It's a sad sight to see it die over something as lame as the dev's folding on the co-op support. For me personally, no biggie, yeah it sucks but that just means devs need to step up and deliver something spectacular to their backers for their own short commings on their promises. 

I understand the trials and tribulations that a developer goes through to see their vision come to life, another reason why it is sad to see it die but this is still no reason the devs need to go on the offensive or even the defensive as the backlash should have been expected from the community. A more inteligent tact would have been to go back to the drawing board, like maybe consider scrapping their developed engine because of it's short commings and using an outside engine, as there are a lot of free ones to choose from. The point is that, there were alternatives to how this could've been handled, but instead of putting their energy into fixing it, their efforts went into some kind of 'fight the community' damage control and broke it so bad that it is now unfixable. Thus, the world is less one good game. 

In all, the game wasn't half bad. It's a great idea but it needs a lot of polishing, the random generating algorithms need fixing and even though, technically that this game is still in early access (of which my review is based on) at this point, needing the polishing and fixes is not a good thing, as I have felt the heart leave this game a long time ago.

It's just not that fun..well, at all after awhile.  The challenge overides the novelty of it all and even though a rogue-like seems fun..it doesn't quite add up.

I purchased [i]Paranautical Activity[/i] out of curiosity during one of the Steam sales event.
I obtained the game under the impression that it could be a nice pass time game allowing me to go on a rampage;
the game definitely delivered in that aspect, I was given an environment and monsters to shoot at.

The problem with this game, however, is the fact that the entire game seems to be just a showcase of an idea.
Due to this very fact, I was no longer able to endure this game past the 25th minute mark.

I do realize that this game is still in early development, but I would in no manner consider this a game.
The definition of providing early access is to allow people to purchase the game and test it for the developers,
with the fundemental qualification for an early access game being having most, if not all, of the core mechanics present.
This was not the case.
This game feels like it is showcasing the classes and the monsters, with overly simplistic menus with very lacking choices.

This game delivered a functioning showcase, as I have yet to encounter a debilitating glitch,
but other than the above point, there are several other problems I would like to point out:

1) The game does not receive updates frequently enough.
Out of the some eight months of owning this game, the game has yet to receive major function and mechanics update.
The update frequency can easily rank just below the notorious [i]Cube World[/i].

2) The classes are extremely unbalanced, for future update reference.
I have been playing tanks most of the petty amount of time I have endured this game, 
as I was shown time and time again in the game that tanks somehow have amazing advantage in both offensive and defensive capabilities compared to many others. I could mow down all mobs regardless of the distance with just the shotgun.

3) The game still does not have multiplayer functionality.
The developer's blog did mention encountering problems on December of last year with creating the multiplayer function, but that was seven months ago.

4) Despite randomized, the game has a very limited amount of mobs, rooms, bosses, and items.
As such, the game was not very engaging, as within twenty minutes, the player may have already encountered every single possible instance. Hence why I could not hold my attention onto the game for even 30 minutes.

Until the game performs a major update with multiplayer capability, and also have far more variety in its instances,
I do not recommend purchasing this game.

TL;DR:
Ranging from instance variety and mechanics, the game is too lacking in too many manners.
Until this game has a multiplayer function and an expanded library of instances, this game is not recommended.",1405601542,1405628077,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- La jugabilidad bastante fluida. No paras de correr y saltar.
- Tienes poderes entretenidos: desde doble salto hasta cambiar tu gravedad y poder caminar por el techo.

Contras:
-No multijugador.
-Solo vale la pena realmente la escopeta.
-El menu tiene un fallo que a√∫n no han arreglado de modo que lo ves descuadrado (pero durante el juego si est√° todo bien.

From the very excellent gameplay to the fun and varied bosses that you encounter.[/h1]

NOTE: This review will change as the game changes, this review is as of 1.8

[u]PROS:[/u]

+ Classic FPS gameplay that you've come to love including Doom and Quake, with over 10 upgrades and fast paced action that many people crave, and NON REGENERATING HEALTH! YES!

+ The game is randomly generated and thus there are thousnads of possibilities for level layouts which is actually done really well, with every corner you turn being completley surprising. With over 50 differnt room enviroments its hard to see the same rooms twice on the same floor.

+ There are many different bosses that you encounter with over 10 in the game, each with their own moves which are pretty insane to watch, with balls of glowing lime green light flying everywhere as you attempt to dodge them with precise movement, just hoping it will die shortly.

+ Variety is a strong point in this game, with many many enemy types and each room having a random layout of enemy in every room, each enemy has its own attack patterns with ninjas that teleport to you in a blaze of white voxel blocks to sharks that dive into the floor leaching up onto you after they swim.

[u]CONS:[/u] (Unfortinutley this game)

+ The music is boring a repedative with only a small handful of tracks that all sound the same.

+ The game has its fair share of glitches (Doors closing before you walk into them causing you to be stuck) But it is early access so I can cut it some slack

+ The developers have no clue what the hell they want in this game, from discontinuing multiplayer to saying updates would come quickly and sadly have come at a crawl.

+ The level's appearance doesnt change often enough (the first 5 levels use the same wall texture and gets bland and tidious after a while) And the bosses aren't really seen as bosses as nothing happens when you enter the room it just spawns and a health bar appears, a nice boss spawning track or some sound effects would really help.

+ Movement doesn't feel right, the lack of bobbing correctly to the very slow walking speed at the start doesn't work well with a game that depends on fast paced movement

[u]OVERALL:[/u]
This game does have plenty of falws in it from glitches and the lazy developers but I keep coming back to this game, why? Because, its fun gameplay, great level layout and enemy variety really makes this game fun to me. I recomend only getting this game if it goes on sale in its current state, because currently it is a very fun game but there isn't enough variety from its very huge variety to make it worth it.",1403740364,1403740364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

However, being that the developer is underfunded and has some poor PR skills, I warn you to take caution when buying this game and (possibly) from this developer. Why? Well, the seemingly important feature of multiplayer has been cancelled (and aware that it wasn't going to happen around [i]2 months after 1.8 patch was announced[/i]) with no official announcement on the community hub or the official site (Code Avarice), instead announcing it through Twitter and streams (Source - 5th comment with replies: http://codeavarice.com/post/85125508953/by-mike-paranautical-activity-will-be-receiving-2#disqus_thread).

The setting of a sunken(?), haunted(?) Nazi ship is very unique, one which I've never seen before, and enemies are bizarre and in some cases disturbing. 

I have yet to beat the game due to it's difficulty. It starts off nice and slow with giant demons and landsharks, but eventually you're fighting ninjas, flaming skulls, and numerous other creatures, each with their own attack patterns and annoying things you have to deal with about them.

There are 5 characters to pick from, each offering a different suite of pros and cons, and each with different playstyles. There's David Bowie, with his powerful crossbow and revolver, Dy-no-mite, with his short range arsenal of a grenade launcher and a katana, Giliad, with his fast firing machine gun and laser, my personal favorite, Gorton, wielding an immensely powerful sickle and a gun that shoots homing explosives, and finally the tank, who deals with how slow he is with massive amounts of health and astonishing firepower.

The gameplay is adrenal, not as much as something like Hotline Miami or Super Hexagon, but still very gripping and exciting, and I found myself physically tense several times while playing. Take this as a good or bad thing, but the game is intense for sure.

The powerups are many and varied, although it does not tell you what they do a lot of the time, and the enemies, as I stated before, can be simply chilling, especially the bosses. Going through that red door, I have faced everything from a floating skull with spiders pouring out of it's mouth to a nazi chainsaw murderer, all of which were tough in their own way. Some bosses have special items that you get when they die, and it makes you really happy when a boss with the item you need comes up. This being a roguelite, that might not happen often, as the levels are procedurally generated.

The game will throw a variety of non-enemy obstacles at you, making the game far more intense. These gamechangers include swinging blades, lava floors, and low light levels, which might not seem very hindering until it happens.

The voxel graphics may be a turn off for some, but I found that I liked them a lot most of the time, and it added a level of uniqueness in it's visuals, along with the amazing lightshow caused by the projectiles and some of the enemies in the darker levels, that made the game all the better.

There are a few things I dislike about this game, from getting stuck under stairs, some glitchyness, and a few annoying enemies, but this being an early access game, I expect that those will be ironed out at some point.

PROS
- Fast-paced do-or-die action gameplay
- Variety of weapons and classes (recently updated and balanced, every class now also has a secondary weapon)
- Variety of enemies (recently updated with a rocket turtle :D)
- Recently updated ""free weapon"" door (you'll see when you play)

CONS
- You can get stuck under stairs (a pain, given you only have a few hits and no recovery time between hits)
- Some boss doors have pentagrams (a moral preference)
- Some bosses seem unbeatable based on your class (some you need to outrun, like the Snail Skull, but the Tank class is too slow)

NEUTRAL (Pro or Con based on preference)
- Unoriginal cubed ""Minecraft"" look
- Can't change the music (I happen to like some songs. I've heard by others that they are obnoxious)

TIPS
- Don't stop moving
- Try out all the classes for their weapons to see if you like them before you buy replacements in the gift shop

It should be called Bunny-Hop Activity, because if you're going to survive you will be jumping around way more than is either fun or comfortable.  

The concept of a bullet-hell FPS with perma-death, randomly-generated floors and item drops sounds great, but the execution here is really rough.  The bullet-hell is way too difficult to be fun for anyone less than a pro FPS player.

Also, I they might think they're being cool by not telling you what the items do, and experimenting to see what is what would normally be okay with me, but it is totally unfeasible when you can almost NEVER get enough money to buy items, making experimenting really slow and unrewarding.  That, on top of the fact that most items have nearly un-observable passive effects that make figuring them our nigh-on impossible.  Couple that with the ""usable"" items and ""super weapons"" being unable to use until you go to Google to figure out which key does what, because you're given NO INSTRUCTION OF ANY KIND EVER.

I understand learning by experimentation, and games not taking you by the hand, but it has to be fun and worthwhile, like a Binding of Isaac or Dark Souls.  This game is simply not fun enough, rewarding enough, or well enough explained or made to be worth it.

Paranautical Activitiy, currently still in Beta, is such that if someone said ""Oh, first person shooter roguelike - wanna play one?"" I would tell them ""No, are you crazy? I'm awful at first person shooters!"" But then this game came out, I saw Bisnap playing it on YouTube, and I literally fell in love with the game. Honestly, I think this game will actually make me somewhat ok at first person shooters, and not the failure I was before I started playing. I've put in a little over 2 hours at this point, as of now I'm loving it, and I would recommend it to everyone - especially since there's multiplayer coming up (as a definite thing the devs are working on), and more content as well (I'm assuming). This game is SOO good and is literally an homage to Edmund McMillen's The Binding of Isaac, one of those games that will forever have a spot in my favorites section on Steam. As a result, this game will, too - for sure.

As a side note, if the devs see this, I just want to mention that there are a couple of bugs I've noticed. First of all, when you start as Tank, you don't have a secondary weapon, and as a result when you press shift the game switches you to the weapon you already have (the shotgun) and resets its shooting timer. As a result, one can manually keep pressing shift to shoot, making the tank an extremely exploitable character. Something else that was actually pretty isolated (only seen once) was that when one of the small people that shoot orange balls of light at me fell down from a higher platform, and it shot at me immediately after, the shot was fired from midair, above where the little guy landed, shortly after it fell. (I apologize if the terminology is off, I don't know any of the character's names except the playable ones and the Gileads.)",1399064725,1399064725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

ways that would improve the experience as follows;
- Make the main menu more presentable just looks quickly hashed right now.
- More weapon variety and costumization with weapons than the 4 you can use now.
- Give the world of Paranautical Activity a personality e,g charm, character instead of a dark dreary boring rooms even binding of isaac has personality not only through it's art style but through menus/enemies/environment etc.
- Don't ever resort to normal text font for the shop items or anything other than your own, if it isnt worth it to you it isnt worth it to people to play.
- continue with the funny name approach with the guns
- update more regularly atleast month to month bases if it cant be done weekly or alternate weeks.(more reason for people to play everytime there is an update)
- maybe even the option to play with friends online/local co-op through the game (easier said than done i know)

at this place in time i hope it gets improved but right now it isnt really worth it to play

The gameplay is mostly inspired by the Binding of Isaac but in a twist with a First-Person View instead. Where do I start with this one? Fantastic graphics, exciting gameplay, and there are so much creativity with this game.

The music however, is what makes me really into the game. I'm not a fan of Dubstep or DnB, but the music in this game is just wonderful, they have that ""Pendulum"" feel to it. (Favorite track: MACAskill - (Down In The) Trudgemank).

The bosses are pretty bizarre and fun to battle with, some of my most favorite would have to be Poseidon, Dobee (or ""The Flying Whale""), and Speiga.

There are 5 characters to choose from when you start a game. These 5 characters include:
Gilead: All-around average character equipped with a Gatling gun.
Gorton: Wielding a sickle that can be thrown, this high speed character takes a while to master.
David Bowie: Above average stats equipped with a crossbow.
Dy-No-Mite!: Hands down, best character in the game (In my opinion of course). Wielded with a Grenade Launcher and a Katana, this character reminds me a lot of the Demoman in TF2. One of the main reason I love this character, is of the massive amounts of bomb upgrades that makes this character very powerful.
The Tank: And last but not least, The Tank. This character is equipped with a Pump Shotgun which is easy to use and very powerful. The only downside of this character is of his speed being very low, hence the name being The Tank, but to counter that there are many upgrades for speed.",1391817124,1416286547,True,1,0,0.5,0,False,False,True,False,,,

~Story: The game doesn't seem to have any story, or perhaps it's less of a spoken story and more of a ""your guess is as good as mine"" story, but the feel of the game and the environment as you climb higher and higher is great.
~Gameplay: Smooth controls, great aiming, sensical spread to the damage and the enemies remain difficult despite your improvement at the game, ensuring that every game is fun and interesting
~Sound: The audio is simply amazing, the music is addictive on it's own even worth listening to on it's own! The guns have a nice sound to them making them feel quite real
~Replayability: I can see stacking up voer a hundred hours in this game before I grow bored of it and that's if the game doesn't get more content through updates. With the updates I forsee 300+ hours.
~Graphics: Greatly stylised old-school look, taking in the old pixelated guns and making it the style to make this game quite beautiful and always pleasing to look it. The dark theme keeps everything intense in feel and makes sure your eyes focus on what is moving.

All in all: Despite my love for a great story and this game lacking an obvious one, I don't typically expect one out of shooters or most games I buy to lose a few minutes here and there. Adding that to the rest of the game simply being this addictive I can't say much more than it is a must try, the game is lots of fun and can even startle you at times and despite some of the enemies feeling a tiny bit cheap I associate that to my innability at aiming than the enemy itself being cheap.

I think I've cleared enough floors and played enough to really judge my experience.

This title aspires to be a throwback to the '90s with an emphasis on constantly moving, strafing around enemies and shooting from the hip. You go from room to room, kill all the enemies within and make it to the boss of the floor before taking the elevator down to the next. Repeat this many times over, with the rooms that you fight in seeming very much the same and the annoying music blaring at all times.

That is Paranautical Activity in a nutshell.
A rougelike take on Doom/Quake this is not. In fact, with all the open seeming environments I was stuck in, it felt more like a grossly simplified voxel take on Unreal Tournament with much less mayhem and enjoyment. Needless to say, I don't quite like this game at the present. It may change for the better due to it being early access, but I think the core designs are already in place and the devs won't flip turn them upside down anytime in the future.

At the very least, I didn't pay full price (a whopping $10) for this. I might be a touch more upset in writing this if I did.
But it WAS the thing I was most looking forward to in the bundle, though...

In closing, I wish the devs the best in improving this...experience and will give future players some advice.
Do not stop strafing, ever. Pick the Tank class if you want a glorious boomstick. The David Bowie class does not have an ultimate move where he transforms into Ziggy Stardust and shoots lasers from a guitar.

The game is advertised as being a roguelike version of Doom/Quake, but ironically Doom and Quake actually feel more dungeon crawl-y thanks to their intricate maze like level designs and emphasis on strategy and resource management. 

Paranautical Activity is basically just a first person Binding of Isaac, in that it just lays out some square rooms at random, populates them with enemies, and calls it a day. In essence, there's really no reason to brag about this game being procedurally generated, because all it really does is switch up the order in which you face the games small pool of monsters while throwing slightly different stats at you.

PA also locks you into every room once you enter it, and won't let you out till you kill every monster inside.  This might have worked for Binding of Isaac since that game was essentially just an arena shooter pretending to be a roguelike, but here it just makes things more mindless. Unlike Doom and Quake where a large part of victory was not only reflexes but picking your battles, escaping at the right time, and thinking strategicly, PA instead reduces things to a guessing game by forcing you to blindly pick which room you enter and than not letting you leave if it turns out doing so might be the smarter strategy.

The controls feel a bit clunky also. I think you have to move for a bit before you accelerate, which feels like shit in a game where moving and turning fast could be the difference between life and death. The enemy designs are decent, but nothing special and are never put to much interesting use thanks to the arena based structure of the game.

Aestheticly it's of course as bleh as it looks. Same not-memorable chiptunes you've heard in a million retro indie games, same cuby graphics you've seen in a ton of Minecraft rip offs. I also have no idea why they thought it was a good idea to name their game a pun based on some dumb horror film people will have forgotten about in a few years.

I think the point of all these action roguelikes is that people want a game that feels like a dungeon crawl but with enjoyable skill based combat and that feels new each time. The combat here may be be skill based, but it's rather bland and the games structure doesn't make it feel like a dungeon crawl at all, it also starts to feel repetitive even on the same playthrough. Doom and Quake did every aspect of this game better, and PA doesn't bring anything worthwhile to the table.",1391299879,1391381851,False,6,0,0.533635795116424561,1,False,False,True,False,,,

Despite being denied the previlage to be put on Steam because of the whole adultswim business, Parantautical Activity proudly pulls off what you would call a Binding of Isaac FPS, if you just add lots of shiney lights, weird but freakishly cool creatures, dubstep and voxel-based graphics.

Paranautical Activity is a throwback to the 'old-school' FPS where your reflexes determine your success moreso than your utilization of chest-high walls. Enemies come at you fast and furious from all angles even from the first room you step into, and the increasing variety of enemies each with unique attack patterns keeps you on your toes. Combine that with a dash of random from the procedurally generated layouts along with all sorts of randomized items that can fundamentally alter your playstyle and it makes for an original, highly replayable game.

Though the ultra retro graphics might be a turnoff for some, in reality it goes along way towards making the combat manageable. There are no particle effects or fancy frou-frou textures to distract you, meaning you can easily identify where everyone and every game-ending bullet is, and because of that the game rarely feels like it cheated you. Rather than trying to surprise you with gotcha moments it presents its challenge openly, leaving it to you and your skills alone to survive.

The only major disappointment is in the room sets. While the layout might randomize, each individual room pulls from a fairly limited pool with static monster locations, allowing you to anticipate exactly what you're walking into before the door closes behind you. With any luck, expanding this room pool will be part of the 'more content' the developer is looking to build in before final release.

I greatly enjoyed playing it, and recommend it to anyone looking for a change of pace to the more routine FPS experience. If the lack of overall room and monster variety disturbs you I'd wait and see how the game evolves on its way to a formal release. 

Here's a video look at the gameplay:

If I had to use other games to describe it I would end up using The Binding of Isaac mixed with Borderlands. With that being said the setting of this game pits you against every increasingly difficult enemies and bosses depending on the selection of your rooms. To mix the game up the rooms always have a random enemy spawn rate making it impossible to really prepare for what you will be facing. The bosses offer a great level of difficutly in exchange for an random item that will help you in your journey to clear all the rooms. Eventually you will find a elevator room that will take you to the next level of insanity increasing the spawn rate of enemies and the stats of boss characters. The fast paced action mixed with the frantic dodging of attacks mixes into a great rogue-like formula. The variety of items keeps you wondering what the next thing you pick up will do. Keep on your toes because if your not Paranautical Activity will suck you in and make you press Restart way too many times.,1390931773,1390931773,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Take a pinch of Doom-esq run/gun, some Spelunky random levels, and the often used basic rougelike elements in order to get the end product of Paranautical Activity

however... once you get past the hype... its pretty dull for a game

it plays like a 3D ""bullet hell"" game with avatars in the ""cube based design"" that has been done to death


You die a lot in this game, even for a rougelike its to the point of frustration. Not the good ""gah, I was so close"" of other titles like Spelunky. But the ""ugh, i died. Again."" repetitve slog that makes playing this game seem like a chore, more than some recreational gaming


When the enemies are not busy spamming endless projectiles at you, or just swarming you, their combat stratagy shows a decided lack of polish and sophistication... In laymans terms: they are idiotic

You go behind even the smallest of corners, with a small bit of your (unseen) avatar obscured... and its like you never existed. Or failing that, they will just spam a projectile at the wall in vain hopes of breaking it down (which will never happen)

- The overall presentation and menus look very rushed and unpolished, even for an early access game.
- The music, oh god, the music.... 
- The total lack balance overall. Not only between classes, not only between enemies and you. 
- Dying feels often unfair and frustrating. I won't say how many thousands of times I've died in tons of other roguelikes, and yeah, there's a difference between dying by lack of skill and dying because the game is poorly balanced. The second option doesn't make a roguelike good, hard or anything, it makes it an unnecessary pain in the ass that any sane player should avoid.
- No sense of progress at all. TBOI, Rogue legacy, etc.... they have a sense of achievement after each run. Doesn't happen in this game, and that's a no-go for me.

There are 2 bosses per level, a sub boss and a main boss, each of which give you an item when killed. Beating the main boss allows you to goto the next level. Room locations, enemies, bosses, and items are randomly generated on each level.

Despite this being nearly the same game, it still remains a very fun experience. Being controlled in a first person manner adds some depth to the control scheme, playing very much like old school shooters like Doom or Quake. The music is amazingly catchy, although the sound effects are a little terrible (they sound almost exactly like The Binding of Isaac too). You have a choice of 5 characters to choose from, all with a different weapon (shotgun, crossbow, machine gun, grenade launcher, boomerang hook?) , stats, and playstyles.

This game is still in beta, so there isn't much content yet. There's enough for a complete game, but items tend to become very familiar, very quickly as there aren't many of them to find. The crosshair is a single dot in the middle of your screen which is almost too small at times and there's no option to change it, so hope you don't need one to aim. Mostly, the game just feels unfinished at this point, though still very playable. Get it now when it's cheap and give it a try.",1390668872,1390668872,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

A game that claims to mix the gameplay of Doom and Quake with the roguelike aspects of games like The Binding of Isaac? There's gotta be some major patchwork to be done in this game. And it's true, there DOES need to be additional content to be added. Right now, at the time of writing this (January 2014), this game is very much still a barebones basic game (and I'm not talking graphically). 

The gameplay is very satisfying. The level design is random each and every time, so it's got one part of its description on the store page right. It IS like The Binding of Isaac in that way. The randomly generated levels and mix of enemies gives one a feeling of helplessness and unaware of what will come next. Bosses are fairly tough, and defeating one, depending on which character you play, is actually quite rewarding. For example, fighting a boss as Gilead is very different than fighting that same boss as The Tank. 

The character stats, however, are not very balanced. At least all the characters have similar stats, and there's no real pros and cons to choosing one over the other. Out of the ten times I played, I chose Gilead 7 times and The Tank 3 times. Now, while this doesn't exactly seem like a good sample size, you can just look up the character stats online. All of them are fairly even and not balanced at all. I suspect this will get fixed in future patches and updates, and I do hope it does, because if these are actually the final character stats, I can't see myself playing this game much longer. 

Back to the gameplay, the FPS integration is absolutely wonderful. A slightly minimalist HUD, simple weapons, great gunplay. These are the cores of any FPS game in my opinion if you want a good mix of immersion and good gameplay. There's nothing really much to say on the guns and the FPS aspects themselves other than I AM very much reminded of Quake and Doom in the level design, specifically with the wide open spaces you often encounter in the many rooms you'll be running and gunning through. 

Overall, I give Paranautical Activity a 7.5/10. For an Early Access game, it's actually pretty well done. The level design, gameplay, and integration of two vastly different genres are definitely what I found to be unique about the game. However, as with most Early Access games, be wary: developers can just stop updating at any time they please.

What could be a great game is ruined by class imbalance, difficulty in aiming with certain guns as you dodge enemy bullets and lack of information on boss attack patterns.

Heres a small example of why this game sucks:

You are playing with a 3/3 HP class, boss has a lot of health, you haven't got upgrades or double jump because the game is just starting, you already used your few bombs on another boss. The boss spawns 5 spiders that quickly come at you while the boss keeps shooting fast travel speed bullets at you... and it keeps doing that until you are dead. So you have to move and aim around a small room with hill-like object placement, forcing you to stay rather close to the boss, but because the boss shoots with fast moving bullets, you can't dodge all of it because you also have to focus on evading and killing spiders, ESPECIALLY if you are using a single target, slow weapon

http://paranautical-activity.wikia.com/wiki/Skullito

Here's another frustrating example:

You complete stage 2 and pick up a powerup that decrease your speed but increases your damage.

The next boss you meet hits you for 5 damage (5x1 quick hits because he's so fast) every time after he casts his special attack because you are too slow to run from him, even if you are running from one end to another, or around the walls.. it takes you 20 hits to kill him, but before you can do that, he's already killed you in 3 combo attacks. like, wtf seriously

This has to be the most toughest and yet addicting games I have ever played in a while.

You start out with a selection of people to play as and then off you go, no explaining, no story, just go out there, kick some @$$ and DON'T DIE. The monsters are weird as hell even as voxels, and the Bosses are a BIT.CH to kill, but once you kill them, gives you that really good feeling that you kicked that boss real good in the @$$... But it gets worst from there. More and more of those bloody bast*rds get more crazy, more strong and what not. When you die, you don't want to quit, you just want to keep playing to get to a higher level than last time you died. The use of RPG elements is actually workable as well. Gives you a bit of those other games with RPG Elements like Saints Row 4, Wolfenstien, Bulletstorm and so on.

Music is amazing, mostly the song that plays in the trailer. When I heard that, it made me scream ""DIE DIE DIE YOU F***ING BLOODY BAST*RDS!!!"" with a side of Dubstep with that. 

Quality of the game is like that of Minecraft meets Doom, it just sounds awesome even saying that... well when I think of it.

So overall, it's a blood bath orgy of fun. Music: Awesome. Graphics: Nice. Monsters: @$$holes... But still fun. Game in general: Awesome Sauce Overload.

The one thing I would like for them to add is some Achievments, some sort of leaderboard to show how far you got, and some Steam Trading Cards, just for the hell of it. Plus the game is still in a Early Access so I bet the company that made this will add some stuff like that in the late future.

Okay, if you wanan play DOOM buy it off of Steam/GOG and put the .wad into the downloadable ZDoom application, bam now you got DOOM. Want Quake? Go to Quake Live's website, it's F2P, minus the P2W. They both do the emphasis on movement so much better. Also, if you call this a DOOM clone, you're being an idiot and I'd question if you've even played DOOM.

The enemies are really dull, and are just hitscans. Yeah strafing is fun, but why not just play strafing in the game that does it best, Quake? i.e. why play shitty Quake-clone mechanics when I can just play Quake?

Okay, what about items?

Oh good luck finding those. Binding of Isaac was a lot nicer about giving fun items. The items are dull. You might as well be playing Quake with a few mods, as this is basically Quake + Binding of Isaac, but being shit at either.

Mechanics are uninspired, dull, and level generation is really dull too, AI is horrid.

Das Gameplay ist aktuell recht unsauber und f√ºhlt sich nicht ganz perfekt an. Da gibt es noch Optimierungsbedarf.
Sch√∂n ist die Levelgenerierung (wie auch in Binding of Isaac z.B.), die jedem Spiel einen individuellen Touch gibt. Am Anfang wird eine Auswahl an Waffen angeboten, mit denen man k√§mpf. Anschlie√üend betritt man die R√§ume, woraufhin Gegener spawnen, die bek√§mpft werden wollen. Erst danach √∂ffnen sich alle T√ºren des Raumes wieder. Ist ein Level clear, geht es mit dem Aufzug weiter ins 2. Level, wo neue Gegner warten, die den Spieler t√∂ten wollen.

Even though this is an alpha/beta build with a good number of glitches.  I had a good time with the 6 hours I played it.  

The basic idea is that each level is sort of square built like Zelda on Nintendo (or more recently Binding of Isaac) where you get randomly generated levels, collect power ups, fight random bosses, and move to the next floor.  The twist is that it is a first person shooter with a lot of water based monsters/weapon/power up ideas.

In its current state it is fun, but flawed as the monster curve through the levels generally out paces your power ups.  Most games end not through skill but an unfair situaiton, but I imagine those will be worked out over time. 

Anyone who played it during this alpha/beta phase knows that if you have a grenade launcher/no speed upgrades and you fight the chainsaw boss... just restart because your dead anyways.

The power ups were fun and creative - at times I felt like I was playing a strange Quake Mod and other times it just funny.  The music is also energetic.

A pretty cool game for the price - as of 1/14/2014 - I will revisit once the game has been fully updated and complete.",1389697741,1389697741,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Maybe. (Note, this reflects an Early Acess game that will likely change over time, potentially negating this review. Dec 23, 2013).
PA is best described as a rogue-lite FPS, where the gameplay mechanics are boiled down to the near most simple understandings of the FPS model. The goal is to reach lower floors, but I'm not sure if there is an end due to my constant dying. Nagivating each floor is much similar to the Binding of Issac and NES Zelda - Enter a rectangular room and clear the are of enemies before you can advance. The game controls near exactly like the original Painkiller and early entries in the Quake and Unreal Series - fast movement, circle strafing, and bunny hopping. The hook of PA is using your skill to stay alive with your limited health and advancing with a mix of your class weaponry, passive power-ups, and active power-ups. 

Classes include Crossbow user, Sickle thrower, Grenade Launcher, a Minigun user and a shotgun user (I forget the names of these classes, except Tank for the shotgun user). Each have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of weapon mechanics, secondary weapons (if any), damage output, range, and health. You can also get other weapons from gift shop if you are able to save up enough cash from them, which is often tough (Weapons seem to cost more than I have ever earned early in game, and when I do save up good funds, I'm usually on level 3-4 where I die). Enemies are varied, some which shoot a single a bullet or two every two seconds, some shooting a continuous hail of bullets, or even those that can nearly teleport to you for melee or enemies that can hop towards you and explode on proximity. What most shooting enemies have in common is that their projectiles aren't hit scan, so it takes timing, skill, and room knowledge to be sucessful. Each floor has a miniboss that usually provides a power-up, money, and sometimes health, weaponry, or items.

The art direction is much like 3D Dot Game Heroes with an interesting lighting selection - where there are very few lights but each projectile also emits projectiles. However, most players will simply say something like ""DARK MINECRAFT VOXELS WITH GUNS"". There is not much sound assets besides gun shots, door openings, item chimes, and the player's ""Oof!"" from being hit. Much of the sound is in the form of a nearly rave-like techno beats that reminds you of other ""Futurisitcky"" games like Wipeout, Extreme G, or Forsaken.

I actaully personally enjoy the base mechanics and idea behind the game - it's actually very easy to get a grasp of circle bunny hopping and learning when is a good time to strafe or sometimes stand still. You can skip the majority or at least the remainder of the floor if you desire, provided that you are able to find the boss room quick enough. The game is both easy since I am decent at shooters and because circle strafing the whole room though the entirety of a fight is almost always sucessful, but hard due to limited health, and the unprediticable nature of roguelikes (random enemies, random power ups, random room types).

My main problem with this game is once you reach level 3 or 4, you often encounter enemy flying skulls which are often hard to dodge, can gang up on you and ""combo air juggle"" you against a wall, and what makes it worse is that they can get so close to you that are behind the point where your bullet will spawn, leaving you literally defenseless (unless maybe you have a melee weapon). This is compounded when you have a group of skulls that for me, seem impossible to deal with unless I'm in a room with a floor plan that will block them or at least slow them down a bit. And of course, like Rogue-lites/like (and Adult Swim games apparently) it needs to be punishingly hard, so despite me doing well up to this point, I die and have to start all over again. Since I'd like to clear my massive Steam backlog, ""Ain't nobody got time fo' dat"". But unlike other rogue-lites where it seems like patience, skill refinement and a bit of luck will help you beat the game, I hit this brick wall to completion once I meet these skulls and my enjoyment of this game is wiped away, much like my progress once I see that annoying Restart or Quit screen.

Paranautical Activity is very enjoyable, but a fairly shallow experience, which is multiplied by having to constantly restart. If you are into the resurgence of rouge-like style games as well as old schoold FPS games, there's a fun and simple game to be found here. But I fear the skulls will kill many player's enjoyment.",1387852268,1387852486,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,False,False,True,False,,,

The soundtrack is also AWESOME!!

The issues that I have with  with this game is that it can be a bit slow at some points, because sometimes you have to go through many rooms that you have already cleared to buy items and get all the way back to the next floor

[b]What It Is:[/b]
A relatively barebones roguelite from early in the days of the genre revival.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
You begin with one of several unique characters, shooting enemies and progressing room to room as you do in most roguelites. It has a very quake-like movement system.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Unbalanced at best, far too hard at worst. Item drops are near non-existent, currency drop rate is wildly too low, progression is sporadic rather than somewhat linear.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Ranging from charming voxel based to absolute MS paint drool. Lighting is some of the worst I've seen, with no real way to improve it.

[b]Audio:[/b]
Grating, awful electronica.

[b]Replay Value:[/b]
High, but not relevant at this point with better titles available.

[b]What I Like:[/b]
It was a good game when it came out. The characters are unique and offer a lot of play style variety in the beginning of the game. Its bosses are some of the more unique I've ever seen, on the level of Enter the Gungeon.

[b]What I Don't[/b]

Having your game pulled from Steam is one thing, but then to get it reinstated and completely blow off any semblance of QoL improvements is...sad...at best.",1387731179,1678377953,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There is little playability besides different weapons, which can (and should be) purchased from the shop on a playthough, and the enemies have little to no variation besides melee enemies, enemies with straight shot, and enemies with a slight homing shot.

It uses a similar random room system as Binding Of Isaac which helps keep the game from feeling non linear, In its current state you will be facing the same type of enemy a lot.
So far I have seen maybe 4 or 5 types of enemies excluding boss battles.

It controls like a twitch shooter like the early days of quake, and gaining powerups to double jump etc. adds a lot of fun jumping and dodging bullets around the rooms.

The minecraft esque graphics look beautiful with a great lighting system. When you destroy enemies and explosive barrel's you will see a lot of 'particle' like effects which look great.

Each floor is composed of randomly selected preset rooms, which lock until the player kills all the enemies therein. As you move down the different floors, more hazards are introduced, such as lava and bladed pendulums. Bosses battles are randomized, divided between mandatory (the room with the elevator to the next level) and optional, and an easy way to get free items. The game is fun, in an arcade-y ""how far can i make it"" sense, though it's not without problems. The dim lighting and voxel-based graphics sometimes make it hard to pick out enemies from the background, and getting movement powerups makes it very easy to run into something dangerous in the often cramped rooms. The different weapons are often more trouble than they're worth-the shotgun and the sickle are your best choices, hands down, and even then, you're at the mercy of whatever powerups are randomly generated in boss rooms or the store in terms of damage or firing rate. That said, the soundtrack is extremely catchy, and it's hugely fun dashing through the levels when you luck out and get the right upgrades.

Mixes ideas from Binding of Isaac with first person shooters that has a Quake/Doom feel to it. The replayability isnt too great at the moment (This review is being written while it is in early access.) Also The devs have mentioned they are working on multiplayer co-op and are also going to be adding a ton of new content. I have yet to beat this game but it sure does provide a challenge in the later levels. (Things crawling on the walls, projectiles everywhere, etc.) I would say this game is worth buying. It's really fun and quite a challenge and i'm sure once the Multiplayer co-op with all the new content is released it will be even better. I'd give it a 8/10 because there are some minor flaws such as it needs more content (Items to be exact, maybe more weapons aswell. Not to mention maybe some more room layouts.) but other than that it's a great game and I highly reccommend giving it a go.

After Early Access edit: Well, the old developers went completely haywire and did some stupid stuff, but now there's a completely new owner and hopefully they take the game in the right direction. My old review still stands as it is still pretty fun to play.

2nd edit: The new devs have done absolutley nothing. This game is just a mess.",1386140511,1443407177,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A fair warning to those that prefer a more ""easy-going"" shooter where you do not have to pay attention to every moving pixel on the screen: This game is not for you. It is REALLY fast and can get ridiculously fast-paced and frantic, so those who cannot really take too much stress are better off with other games (Sorry, but this really is getting frantic fast and keeps that pace going all the time).

The shooter elements are incredible and have this ""Quake"" feeling, able to move and shoot in one fluid motion. The shooting seamlessly combines with moving, jumping and the enemies keep you going in many different ways (even though there are not a lot of different types). The item system is well-implemented and even though there are not too many of them they offer more than just an increase in stats, but also unique effects that are real game changers.

this is literally one of the worst games i've ever played in my life.

the aesthetics are universally offensive. graphics are hideous, enemy and weapon designs are laughable, music is eardrum-bludgeoning garbage. the weapons themselves are horribly unfun to use, with no sense of weight to them and no sense that they are inflicting damage on anything you aim them with. every audio asset in this game is stolen. enemies don't even react when you shoot them, whether it be with a crossbow or a grenade launch. even wolf3d and doom gave you enough feedback that it felt like you were firing weapons that damaged the target, something that this title has completely failed to do. all of this might have been forgivable if the game was in any way enjoyable to play, but to top everything else off it also controls like steaming garbage. you move like a greased pig on ice skates and the limited field of view and terrible movement guarantees that you will get hung up on the slightest obstacle in your path.

the real crime here isn't that this game was yanked from greenlight, it's that it was ever allowed on steam to begin with, and i sincerely regret that even a single cent of my money has gone into the developers' pockets.

EDIT: since i have written this, this game has been taken off steam because Mike ""SpooderW"" Maulbeck threatened to murder Gabe Newell on Twitter. at this point this miserable software abortion was removed from steam and Maulbeck resigned from code avarice. except code avarice hired him again and sold this garbage heap to another publisher to get it back on Steam. do not pay for this game.

You would think that this would make the game unplayable, but the number of different room layouts is so small that you will start remembering enemy spawn locations after a couple games.

Since the game is rogue-like, it is really tempting to play round after round in order to see new items. However, few items really change how the game is played. You are going to be running backward holding down your left mouse button a lot.

I only got as far as the floor where swastikas start appearing on walls and tiny fast moving raptors run at you (6th? 8th? I don't remember). That is when I realized I would have to memorize a whole new area of layouts, and that I had stopped having fun four hours ago.

I did *not* expect this game to be so addictive and absolutely satisfying. A long-overdue and well-executed fast-paced, circle-strafing, old school twitch shooter feel with a lot of elements very much like Binding of Isaac (a very good thing, and I mention the likeness only to its credit.) Different starting characters/builds with different stats and starting weapons to choose from, randomized/procedurally generated rooms and floors, health/armor/gold/bomb drops off enemies, shops on each floor, tons of unique personal upgrades to buy or earn at the end of each floor, etc. With even more content to come, and co-op multiplayer on the way (dear god yes!), I haven't been this pleased with and addicted to any indie title since FTL.

Most importantly, the core controls and mechanics are an absolute joy. The pace and precision of the controls and the action feel absolutely spot-on. This is something many games destined for mediocrity have overlooked in lieu of trying to do everything else. When it comes down to it, the core mechanics, the precision and pacing of the controls of any shooter are at *least* half of what we either enjoy or can't stand about them. And more often than not, we barely even consciously realize that, if at all. Paranautical Activity absolutely nails it in terms of *exactly* how a shooter like this should feel, and it's a feel that is too rare these days.

Es imposible no nombrar ""The binding of isaac"" ya que la sensacion es muy parecida, pero con graficos basados en voxels y en perspectiva FPS. Niveles generados aleatoriamente, como en TBOI, bosses con drops especiales como TBOI y tienda de objetos. Podemos empezar con diferentes personajes, cada uno con un tipo de arma que se juega de manera bastante diferente. Por ejemplo una escopera de corto alcance pero devastadora, un arco que hace mucho da√±o pero que tendremos que tensar tras cada disparo, o una hoz arrojadiza con efecto boomerang, que hace da√±o pero que nos deja indefensos en algunas ocasiones. Como punto negativo, a√±adiria que al ser beta con acceso anticipado, la cantidad de enemigos es limitada (aunque he jugado poco y seguro que no los he visto todos). Planean a√±adirle modo cooperativo en breve y muchos parches de contenido.
