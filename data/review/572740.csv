THE SECRET OF SHADOW RANCH
Good lord, the games are just getting worse. Nothing is done right in this game. Despite the UI improvements this is the worst one so far. I'm just going to list awful things about this game until I run out of space.

- The To-Do list. I played on Senior difficulty. On this difficulty, Nancy says she doesn't need the to-do list. Are you kidding me. This is fake difficulty. Haha, if you wanted a fun game you should have picked the Junior difficulty, dumbass!
- Chores. I'm used to ND games starting with a round of chores for Nancy to do and sometimes it's fine. It helps you, the player, get accustomed to the game and learn the level layout and the characters. This game sucks about it. There are too many of them and instead of just doing them at the start, you have to do them at the beginning of all three in-game days. Meaningless filler.
- Speaking of chores... Nancy is a GUEST at Shadow Ranch. Why the FUCK is she being asked to do chores. These people have no sense of hospitality. You do not make your guests tend the farm for you.
- While we're on chores... collecting eggs. You always need six. Sometimes you go to collect and there literally aren't six there. You have to leave and come back and hope more appeared. Meanwhile Shorty acts like it's your fault you couldn't find more.
- Another chore... making the cake. It's already bad enough that you gotta suss out the ingredient ratios in a tedious and boring sequence. But then you have to choose a pan. There is no in-game hint that tells you which one. If you guess wrong, the cake won't cook right. Try again, asshole. Oh, also, there is no indication how long to cook it for or at what heat. Chose wrong? Haha, you are bad at the game. You have to do this minigame again. Devs can kick rocks.
- Every single time you leave the ranch, you have to go through the process of saddling your horse, which first involves going to get the saddle, then putting it on the horse, tightening it, and then leaving. If you forget any of these things, you waste even more time. Then when you return, you have to remember to untighten the saddle, take it off, and return it to its hook in the stable. Otherwise it's a game over! This is boring and tedious. I do not care if it's realistic. Once I have demonstrated I know the proper procedure for riding, the game should not make me go through the steps again. You have to ride the horse many, MANY times in the game, even assuming you play optimally. I am here to solve a mystery, not to spend 25% of my time figuring out where to click before you let me go to another location.
- Using the lariat (the lasso). This involves just waiting until the lasso loop is a perfect circle. If you click at any other time you will miss your target, which means you have to wait for the animation to play and then try again. Sometimes when you click while the lasso is a perfect circle, it will change shape right when you click, and you will miss. The shortest I ever waited for the lasso to be a circle was probably six seconds. You have to use the lasso a minimum of four times *outside* the lasso tutorial. And since you will miss a lot, this is minutes of the game dedicated to trolling you.
- The slot machine. Oh boy, the slot machine. Like a real slot machine, it is ENTIRELY random whether you win or not. On your first use, you will have, at max, ONE coin to use. If you lose the slot machine, you have to ride your horse all the way back to Mary's and play all three levels of the arcade game again to get another one. The only way you will save your sanity is if you save right before playing and then just load your save if you lose. Even then, you could - like me - have to play NEARLY FORTY TIMES before you win and the game lets you continue. Imagine if you didn't save scum and had to make the several minute detour FORTY TIMES. The devs should have been fired and blacklisted from the industry. They clearly do not know how to make a game interesting, fun, or good, and they do not care about their product nor their customers.
- The plot is not as coocoo as the previous entry but it's still not believable. I'll buy Dirk's weird and stupid hints that are somehow still applicable 120 years later because that's just tropey video game stuff. What I won't buy is the culprit's plot. The culprit is trying to chase the Rawleys off their ranch in order to track down Dirk Valentine's treasure. First off, they can do that even if the Rawleys are there, nothing is stopping them. Second, the treasure isn't even on the Rawleys property, so what's the point. Third, no grown-ass adults are going to be scared by this Phantom Horse trick. I realize it's a kids game, and yeah, if KIDS saw a ghost horse they might be scared. But adults capable of running a ranch would not say ""huh, this ghost horse showed up and then the water pipes burst! Must be haunted spirits and not sabotage. We don't have insurance because we're idiots. We should just sell the property instead of calling the police to investigate."" Come on. In order for the culprit's plot to work, no one in the game can act like a rational human being.
- Also, the culprit is [spoiler]Shorty[/spoiler]. This character has NO reason to be the culprit. No established motive. Just, you get to the end and, surprise, it's [spoiler]Shorty[/spoiler]! We TRICKED you. You couldn't guess the culprit based on any in-game evidence, motive, means, or opportunity! We're SMART writers and this is a PLOT TWIST.
- I am getting tired of the stock puzzle where you have to change the word or set of symbols, but clicking on one letter/symbol changes multiple symbols and you have to figure out which symbols do what. I put up with it in earlier games because they had at max five symbols. This one has EIGHT.
- The magnet puzzle. If you back out of the puzzle five or six times, the cover over the maze disappears and you can just solve normally. The devs realized they had made a stupid puzzle and apologized for it IN GAME. Fuck you.
- Hope you like combing the desert for arrowheads. You need ten, which means the devs only put ten in the game, so once you have nine it is a pain to find that last one. Even better? Once you're done, it turns out you only needed nine, so Mary lets you keep one. Are you going to use that one? No. It just sits in your inventory. Fuck you.
- Every element of this game is designed to waste your time. Your playthrough will probably be around 5 hours but it would be 1 to 2 hours if you didn't have pointless filler. You gotta do all the chores. You gotta bake the cake. You gotta lasso the tree like eight times. You gotta play the slot machine a million times 'til you win. You gotta wait forty-five seconds every time you want to travel. You gotta click on every little rock on every screen if you want to find the arrowheads. You gotta throw bricks at the key until you magically intuit which power level and angle will be successful, just guess! That's fun. Trial and error is fun, right, kids?

OVERALL: 1/5
The only thing keeping this from being a 0/5 is that the game at least functions and wasn't made by literal neo-nazis. Otherwise the most infuriating and terrible entry. Worse than Stay Tuned For Danger, which only beats this one because its failure was charming. I was enjoying the ND games until the last stretch of three (Haunted Carousel, Deception Island, and this). I do not like how the devs are turning to complete bullshit to pad out their games. I hope they were all fired and replaced with competent creators so the next games can be fun.

Вот только в чем заключается дело они решили рассказать на месте. Их срочно вызывают по неотложному делу, поэтому они будут вынуждены покинуть ранчо и сообщат нам все детали по телефону. По приезде на ранчо мы знакомимся с его обитателями и людьми, которые за ними ухаживают. Выясняется что по ночам эти места посещает некий всадник, на призрачном коне. Он наводит ужас на персонал и всячески вредит репутации этого места, ведь многие гости поспешили покинуть ранчо, чтобы избежать лишних психологических травм. Нашей Нэнси предстоит разобраться в этом загадочном деле и изгнать призрака из этих мест.

По классике этой серии, большую часть игры мы будем заниматься рутинной работой. На ранчо мы будем ухаживать за лошадьми, собирать животноводческую продукцию, вроде яиц или овощей и помогать с уборкой в сувенирной лавке. Параллельно работе, мы будем активно общаться с персоналом и наводить справки, касаемо ночных происшествий.

I've very rarely met a horse that couldn't find some extra space for a few more rolled oats), and the vegetable-picking one gives you bad information to start with, and will give you a game-over and a long lecture if you get it wrong. Oh, and the ones you outright can't do until Nancy's dumb *** catches on, because she has to come to a realization on her own so the puzzle can officially be open to solving, no matter what you've already figured out.

All in all, I can't  recommend this game to other people. I have no idea if all of the Nancy Drew games are like this, but if this one is any indication, steer clear, it is infuriatingly boring.",1647322627,1702424345,False,2,3,0.498113185167312622,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As far as I can tell it's a perfect port of the ""regular"" version (haven't played a physical copy, but it runs the same as others I've played), although I have issues with the interface, particularly with how Nancy's phone uses the center of the arrow instead of the arrow point as the interactive hotspot, so I was often clicking an entry I didn't want. Also, it gets tedious having to saddle/unsaddle the horse every time I need to do one single thing at the ranch before going back out, since Tex yells at Nancy if she doesn't, even if the horse is perfectly fine staying saddled for however long Nancy is off doing her own thing anywhere else off-ranch.

Also it is SO HARD to tell what vegetables are ripe other than the tomatoes. Extremely annoying puzzle.

Small nitpick is I adjusted the speaking volume to be quieter, but this doesn't affect the cutscene volume. Probably an oversight but nothing game-breaking. Bigger nitpick is inventory management, how you have to pick the item you want to use, then click the TINY ""X"" box to exit the inventory, and if you miss, it drops the item back into your inventory, at the BOTTOM of your inventory. Irritating.

The main reason I wanted to play Shadow Ranch was to see how it compared to the book, but I've forgotten most of it by now, so while most of the major points are similar (to the rewrite, not the original from like 1931), all I can really comment on is that some parts were streamlined for execution in a game (such as the location of the green bottle and the fact the game has only one villain), and some of the game additions are completely silly (an Old West outlaw building a wooden magnet maze puzzle??).

I was entertained, it wasn't as easy to clock whodunnit, the mystery was intriguing and heart-tugging, it was properly lengthy, and some of the puzzles were really fun. THAT BEING SAID.... oh my god, was this game ANNOYING. 

It always shocks me that games like this one and Blackmoor Manor are huge fan favorites, because both of these games are TEDIOUS, and NOT in a good way (for us, at least). The chores were dreadful. We are NOT fans of when Nancy Drew games force you to do a lot of back and forth chore-doing as opposed to actual sleuthing and puzzle-solving, and this title was one of the worst we've recently replayed in this respect. So many of the things we had to do were also not explained very well anywhere in the game, and you had to just... guess? Unfortunately this is one of those mistake-heavy titles as well, because almost every single corner if you hit ONE button incorrectly Nancy would DIE or GET KICKED OUT and it honestly made me too anxious to do anything. Guessing was out of the picture, so we had to resort to hint-receiving, of which Bess/George and Frank/Joe were useless at, so we had to go to UHS for help for honestly more than half of the game. I hated it!

On top of all of the annoyances, this game was SO OUTRAGEOUSLY glitchy, moreso than even the older titles. The journal entries were totally messed up and convoluted, the check list hardly ever worked, phone calls and the use of the web was frustrating and difficult to navigate, items would only show up if you clicked around several times, some items actually never appeared and we had to cheat to get to the next part, and some puzzles were so ridiculously confusing or frustrating that we would spend ages on them and have to give up because we just couldn't stand it anymore. 

Overall, of course I would still recommend the game.

HeR has revamped the interface in this part, to allow more ""play area"" space, so now we can see even more detail in locations. Sadly, there is a downside with this new interface - the inventory screen. Before it was on screen all the time and easy to access/use. Now it's a separate button and it gets cumbersome to close it after you chose an item or to open and close it, when you want to put an item back.
Most of the puzzles were great, but then there are daily chores... You spend three days during the plot and each day you have to do two of the same boring ""puzzles"" with picking up ripe vegetables and getting eggs from the chicken coop. Both have their game over conditions. Nancy is here on vacation and the staff forces their chores on her and, if she gets them wrong - she's kicked off the ranch! She's not even working there, but failing at a task when you are a guest? Get out of here and never come back, you are scaring our best chicken.
There are a couple other frustrating puzzles, like baking a cake or picking up arrow heads. With cake it's easy to mess up and either you start the long process again, or get a game over. With arrow heads - they are scattered over most locations and you need to find them all in order to progress at one point. Missed one? Good luck checking every single location with a fine tooth comb.

You are staying on a ranch in Arizona, where the appearance of a ""phantom horse"" accompanied an accident. You have to help out with some ranch chores, which is something I was looking forward to because of nostalgia. While some chores are one-offs you only do once (fixing wiring for chicken fence, preparing animal food in proper proportions, baking a cake), some you do each day (3 days). The daily chores are collecting chicken eggs and vegetables. Different variety of vegetables are picked at different stages, which you can read up on in an in-game website from your phone.

When you finish with your chores, you can work on solving the phantom horse mystery, which turns into a local history treasure hunt. You have to get help from a writer of cheesy historical fiction novels for some info about daily life to help solve clues. I feel like the characters of this game are particularly good and memorable, especially the ranch cast.

This game marked a fan-favorite quality of life upgrade: the portable checklist. In a couple of the games immediately proceeding this one, you get a text file checklist on a computer. As mentioned above, the keyword searches using a web browser on your phone is back in this entry, as well. That is good from a story-telling perspective since it helps space the content more appropriately than just having 10 books you can pick up and read from the beginning.

Educational content seems more focused on domestic/craft/DIY type stuff. In addition to the basic farm stuff, there is measuring ingredients for a cake (and even having to guess at correct baking time and heat), learning about knitting patterns and how they're made, redoing historic beadwork according to a pattern. You also get some helpful tips about surviving a downed powerline (hint: don't run, shuffle away) and rattlesnakes. You learn not to be cruel to Bob, the horse you ride to different locations, as you will be scolded and guilt-tripped if you don't take the effort to remove his saddle when back at the ranch. You also have to make sure the straps on the saddle are tightened or you'll fall off.",1596386390,1596386412,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I think most of the puzzles are good apart from a magnet one that you have to do near the end which just sucks, its so annoying it took me 15-20 minutes because it kept getting stuck. A lot of people hate the vegetable and egg puzzle but I actually liked them an enjoyed doing them but you have to do them everyday so it gets quite repetitive.

Some problems I do have is I got stuck trying to end both day 1 and 2 which was annoying as I had to look at a guide which I don't like as they usually ruin the story but :/ I also think having to ask Tex every single time you want to ride or else he gets mad at you is a complete waste of time as well as his ""quiz"" as you actually never need the information. Also having to take the saddle off, put it away, talk to 1 character, get the saddle, ask Tex to ride and then go was so annoying and got extremely repetitive VERY fast.

I like the setting of this game, places like the ghost town and Mary's little shop being two of my favorites. The soundtrack is my absolute favorite of all the ND scores, and I'll listen to it frequently. I also loved Bet and Ed, even though you don't meet them, because they feel so real! And although I guessed who the villain was, I felt like there was proper motivation for anyone to be the villain. But I'll be honest; this one isn't for everyone. The puzzles can be atrocious (the fricken veggie picking), and some of the game mechanics can be tedious (taking off Bob's saddle EVERY TIME, and having to return it to the storage room EVERY TIME). There's also a puzzle that is pure chance, and I absolutely hate these. And if you lose, which you will, you have to jump through a ton of hoops to be able to try it again.

- Моноязычность (только анлийский) не знаешь анлийский - проходи мимо!
- Нет карт и достижений
- Высокая цена
