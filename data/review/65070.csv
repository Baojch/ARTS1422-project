Игра по сути имеет 2 режима: Гонка на ставки и танцы на лоурайдерах. Первый режим полная копия L.A. Street Racing (Кто играл, тот поймёт). Второй же, обычная миссия из GTA San Andreas с более проработанной анимацией. Для 2012 года, да и сейчас - это просто сырой продукт. Порадовал саундтрек, он действительно заслуживает внимания. Купил ключ за 50 рублей, 82 рубля игра точно не стоит, похожа на Unity проект из Google Play. Тюнинг в ней довольно скудный, не зацепил. Графику всегда ставлю на последнее место в играх, тут она приемлимая.
Мне игра понравилась только потому, что я люблю нечто странное. Чисто на любителя - лучше сыграть в более интересные продукты. Ах да, игра от создателей Need For Russia 4 (Это тупо её клон) :).",1602020057,1602020869,True,4,0,0.554476380348205566,0,False,False,False,False,

Lowriders aren’t a common presence in video games. Most car customizations and the certain subcultures which might entail them, rarely go beyond scratching the surface. Ride ‘em Low wishes to combine the hydraulic system competitions with more conventional street racing. It succeeds in a large part and despite not aging so well (2013 release), it’s still among the few titles focusing on this particular type of cars. It was the Steam debut of Red Dot Games and this is quite obvious even if in recent years, the developer has shifted towards comprehensive and far more entertaining  Car Mechanic Simulators than the game I’m writing about today.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Much like the hot rod/rat rod car customization style and subculture, the lowriders also trace their origins in Los Angeles, California and share a similar time frame, even if the similarities end there. Lowriders never go to the same extremes of stripping an old car apart and keeping just the essentials which are also exposed to the elements, most of the time. No grandpa’s car which youngsters decided to “freshen up” and also offer an entirely new look. Low rider vechicles focus more on what’s under the hood than the aesthetics. In case you’re wondering, I’m a fan of any type of customization, cars included. Stock parts and looks, simply don’t offer owners the same satisfaction as an object which they took an interest in and decided to add a personal touch to it.

I first came in contact with the term and the (digital) visual representation of lowriders in 2005, while playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The slick maneuvers and stunts which were achieved with those custom hydraulics as well as the subsequent portrayal through rap music videos, captivated me. Back to Ride ‘em Low, players get to forge their own tales in real time. As with the older titles within the Need For Speed series, you also get to name your in-game avatar and have the freedom to choose which car model you want and then go crazy with the customization of it. The car brands themselves aren’t named as such, for obvious reasons. Time has proved that even more established series such as DIRT and GRID, may suffer from costly licensing issues. So naming the car as “Caddy” instead of Cadillac, makes sense in the long run.

American car brands, naturally. Even if you have limited interest in automobiles, you’ll still recognize the form factor on those generic names used in Ride ‘em Low. For some weird reason, opting for the Metric unit system instead of Imperial, also changes the currency from US Dollars to Euros. A career mode is implemented in the sense in which players shall have to earn cash through racing events before even having a large enough budget to install a noteworthy hydraulics system and participate in the traditional lowrider competition involving that iconic bouncing and “dancing”.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
From the looks of it, Ride ‘em Low features a proprietary graphics engine. The cars are rendered quite nicely, with both the textures and reflections to show off the attention to details. If only I could say the same about the racing tracks or the fonts and scaling within this game. Those are abysmal. Playing in my monitor’s native 4K resolution, I had to choose between downsampling  enough until the cars looked like they came from a PlayStation 2 port or accept the glitchy fonts to all the in-game text which had line collision or even fused sentences & words. First time I experience this with a Steam game and I’m quite disappointed since I couldn’t find a workaround.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The sounds are all repetitive and forgettable. Take my advice, mute them altogether and blast off some old school rap to your heart’s desire. It will make those races and hydro competitions far more enticing.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
What more can I say of the gameplay? It certainly offers a challenge at the very start of your lowriding career. The stock car you purchase is underpowered and no matter how much you cheap out, you won’t be able to afford crucial upgrades until you grind those race tracks and up the ante by betting on yourself. Not a exactly the definition of sportsmanship but hey, these are street races afterall. I doubt something like this would be legal in real life. I would have enjoyed some more details relating to the mechanical upgrades instead of just naming the next upgrade which seems like an improvement only because it costs more than the previous one. At least you can customize the exterior as well. Don’t expect the absolutely bonkers customization from the Saints Row franchise though.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
If I didn’t find the lowrider topic and the classic cars even remotely interesting, you can bet I would have rated down Ride ‘em Low. 60/100 is my minimum prerequisite for recommending a Steam title and I felt generous enough since my scaling issue can’t be replicated by those which play in lower resolutions. Your mileage may vary and that pun is intended. I’m also not gonna act as if Steam game from 2013 absolutely had to include Cheevos and Cards. It would have been a nice touch, if added in a future update, but even as it is, you almos get your bucks’ worth out of this title. Waiting for a Steam Sale or bundle is ideal and the game shall certainly entertain fans of the lowrider subculture.

[h1]Strong Points[/h1]
+ Pleasant graphics.
+ Decent customization options.
+ Sufficient racing track & vehicle diversity.

[h1]Weak Points[/h1]
- No Steam Trading Cards nor Achievements.
- Resolution and font scaling issues.
- Limited sound selection.

The game sets out to bring the player into the world of street racing and car dancing.  While the goal is noble the implementation is lacking and leaves the entire experience feeling hollow.

Some of this is on the content being presented, a drag race is by definition going straight so the play can just numbly hold down the accelerator.  Races are against single cars without any rubberbanding so you know early on if you'll win or not.  This may be accurate but in game form it's uninteresting.

The hydraulics gameplay of car dancing is hilarious as you DDR your car through a set routine.  Freestyle events appear to be bugged which was dissapointed due to it being so ridiculous to make the car hop around.",1456161380,1456161380,False,2,0,0.504947781562805176,0,False,False,False,False,

The handling is terrible so let's rule out all the circuit racing etc. Drag racing is incredibly easy. I slaughtered everything in my path every time. Betting full amount I can each time I had copious amounts of money, bought the best I could and once I reached the boss, well... he was too easy.

The customising part is minimal. Has a few set things you can do. Things such as wheel size can affect speed so there are small factors that can come into play but you're never that close in races for it to matter other than you own personal best 1/4 mile times etc. As for styling you can do a few basic things but nothing major. Paint, wheels, tires, ride height, window tints, and some special things like gold trim.

There is a mode where you can use hydraulics to complete in competitions. I can't get it to score any points in the freestyle no matter how much I try. Probably bugged. It's fun to play around with hydros for a few mins in the test mode but it gets boring after that.

It has a score system for reputation for each race. No idea what that does. I think it might affect multiplier in the hydro mode but again, can't score, so useless.

I was hoping it would get more difficult as the game went on but nothing changed. It was the same from start to finish.",1419099911,1419099911,False,20,1,0.733498752117156982,0,False,False,False,False,

[b]Graphics[/b]
Even though it has been a while since i've played NFS:Underground, I would say graphically Ride 'Em Low is somewhere on the same level as NFS:U was back in 2003. Personally, I don't mind if a game is not up to date on todays standards, as long as it brings something new to the table.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Ride 'Em Low starts like most race games these days; Buy a second hand car, tweak it and start racing. Unlike NFS:U, you do not get to drive around the city (as in freemode). The races themselves are pretty boring compared to other race games and I can't even name anything great about them. It seems that if you tuned your car well enough, you will win the race otherwise you will simply lose.

[b]Sound/Music[/b]
Obviously a low budget game can't get the licenses for music like EA could with NFS but in this game the music is worse than the original Need For Speed game. Uninspiring Music which will most likely annoy you after a few game rounds. The  other sounds are nothing special either.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Ride 'Em Low is only interested to people who do not own and have never played any good race game over the past 15 years or own the game because of some bundle like I did.

I don't know what is worst about the game, but I'll just point out some facts:
- Specs are pretty high, had to turn some graphic options down on my notebook (i5 with Nvidia 3100 1 Gb and 8 Gb DDR3) to run 100% smooth. I expected good graphics when I saw that, I was wrong
- Graphics look like a 90's game, some light effects and shadows that seem to be more modern, but it still sucks.
- Gameplay seemed promising from the description but it's just awefull. Racing sucks, car control is bad, turning just makes you lose speed, which is low anyways, you can't hit or do anything to your opponent, you will always race in straight lines, car upgrades have sick prices and you get close to no upgrade. you have to bet your money on races on straight lines and you will lose to opponents with weaker cars if you don't upgrade enough.

I have to say this is a challenging game, you have to know what you're doing in order to win and trust me you will lose and even when you have no more money the game gives you $250. In the beginning you really have to choose if you want your car to be a ""Racer"" or a ""Hopper"" for you can not have both. If you choose to go with a Racer, modify engine, gearbox(A.K.A.

Pros: Customizing the cars and racing

Recommendation- Get it if its on a bundle or very cheap like less than 2 dollars.  
Early review : It gets repetitive real fast and as well as pretty buggy on video quality. . Will play more to see if i change my mind of the game.

The production values are very low, and the mechanics are quite limited for a racing/driving game. Being a fan of racing games and having grown up in a city where modified cars were a part of its culture, this game quickly caught my attention. Sadly, it did not fully satisfy my expectations. The pleasant surprise arrived when I noticed the many parallels to the Street Rod 1 and Street Rod 2 DOS games I played many hours as a kid. The premise and mechanics are very similar, and all three games also share similar problems and limitations. You start the game with a lump sum of cash, head over to the car dealer, and buy a classic muscle car of your choice. From there, you will begin racing other drivers and then modifying your vehicle with your race earnings. You will also be able to gain respect points with each race win. On the other hand, races that are lost will decrease your respect points and decrease your savings. I have found little to no value of having any amount of respect. What matters most in Ride 'em Low is money. It will get you part upgrades, new cars, cosmetic changes, and best of all, it will move you up the drivers' ranking. The game relies heavily on your income while driving skills have nearly zero impact on the outcome of races, unless you are competing in the top ten. In addition, car part upgrades do not scale well at all in comparison to your direct competitors in the driver ranking. Because of these flaws, progression in Ride 'em Low means you will be forced to grind wins for money against lower ranked drivers with much inferior cars in comparison to yours. After a few hours of grinding, the game suddenly clicks together, and you will be progressing through the ranks and acquiring upgrades enjoyably. After much racing and climbing up the ranks, you will quickly realize that maxing out all available upgrades for your current car are not enough, and you must purchase a better automobile. The feeling of improvement as you buy new parts or upgrade your existing ones is satisfying. There are even subtle audio differences depending on what parts you have equipped. Edging out an opponent for a win that you have lost to previously is quite fun and rewarding. As I mentioned before, winning races has very little to do with your gained skills as a driver, but everything to do with how expensive and powerful your vehicle has become through part upgrades. With that said, there is some minor experimenting with tweaking your car's gear differential in order to achieve better overall performance. As you calibrate this, you will be able to go on test drives and find out how well the changes have impacted the car's acceleration. This can be fun after each major upgrade, and depending on the parts, differential configurations do make a difference in beating an opponent in certain events. Which introduces another major flaw in the game. There is a severe lack of tracks to race on. Even though there are four different race modes, each utilizing alternate track variations, they are far from exciting, and do not feel like an actual event. There aren't any city drivers around, ever. If the developers had added city drivers throughout the tracks and some interaction with the police, the game would have been so much better. This goes in line with the rest of the game's lack of polish and content. It's also very clear that there is much to be desired graphically. The car models have had the most attention, while the tracks and other objects around them have low resolutions and look like they are about fifteen years out of date. Competing against your opponents as you go up to the number one rank can be fun, but not in all race modes. Strangely enough, drag racing is the race mode I prefer to take part in. It's fast, satisfying, and puts your parts tweaking to the test in their purest of forms. There are three other longer race modes around very bland and uninteresting tracks, but I resentfully participated in them. The cars available to the players are all very large and heavy beasts of classic machinery. They handle, feel, and move like massively heavy boats on quicksand, and racing them around tight corners and chicanes is not fun in any way. The car physics while racing are decent, but the weight and feel of the cars as you turn are not fitting to how they should handle and perform after being fine tuned with expensive, maximum performance parts and engines. In Ride 'em Low the only simulation aspect is left to car part modification and upgrades. I have hit a solid cement wall going over 215 miles per hour a few times, backed up, and continued on the race without any problems. I have also been involved in or witnessed some extremely unrealistic but funny crashes, only to see the cars land back on the road and continue driving to win the race. Going back to the game not requiring very much of your driver skills and track experience, the true opponent challenges will only exist when you reach each of the events' top ten driver ranking. Then, the developers opted to provide you with some artificial difficulty, as many of your opponents will be driving the exact same or inferior cars and go much faster than you, even if your top of the line car has maximum upgrades and the absolute best parts. There is also some senseless performance instability coming from your opponents. Sometimes you will have to drive the same challenger more than once, and their performance will become better or worse, seemingly at random even though they are the same driver with the same car as before. The uninspired tracks also suffer from some bugs. Sometimes your car will be stuck to a light post or even a sidewalk. The only way to continue is to go to the menu and restart the race. The game client itself also has some awful problems regarding the occasional crash and the operating system's sound. After each time I play Ride 'em Low, it causes severe issues with the system sound, completely muting most of the channels, in addition to producing some very strange noises during gameplay. The only way to get the system's sound back to normal is to restart Windows. This is clearly an issue tied to Ride 'em Low alone, as I have not experienced anything like it from any other game or software. Besides the main racing events, there is also a hydraulics competition. In this event, there is no racing involved at all. Your task is to equip your vehicle with hydraulic suspensions and perform for a high score. While the idea is novel and there aren't that many games that provide the player with such a genuine lowrider experience, once you do three or four of these, there isn't really a reason to participate again. The main event in the game is truly the actual racing, and your objective is to reach the number one spot in all four racing competitions. There is a surprising amount of fun to be had tuning and racing classic muscle cars, and the game thankfully does not outstay its welcome. If you can ignore and overlook some serious flaws, and if you liked Street Rod 1 and Street Rod 2, then Ride 'em Low is at least worth a try.

There is also a multiplier that you get by applying upgrades from the ""special"" section in the modification tab. But I must say there alot of upgrades. Still with four tracks and one lowrider arena I still managed to suck up countless hours of fun from this game, just annihilating every car in sight by taking over the lead from the start. There is no greater feeling then that. The game is a MUST HAVE for lowrider lovers, but it is fun for average players that just wanna race n' stuff.

It looks like something that came out ten years ago, the UI is terrible, it's full of typos, and it doesn't have much to pass for gameplay. You get to pimp out non-trademark-infringing knock-offs of classic cars (Gazelles and Walkers instead of old school Impalas and El Caminos) and then race them or show off how ridiculous your hydraulics are, except both types of events have very little depth and kind of iffy controls. If you don't win, you will have absolutely no idea why you didn't win or what you should've done differently. The rate you do get money from winning is quite low and makes it feel like it's meant to have microtransactions so you can actually afford to upgrade your car in less than six months of playing. It's also very easy to completely run out of money if you buy the wrong stuff and then lose a couple races, and the amount they give you to get going again if that happens is so low that you might as well just start over.

That said, the keyboard controls for driving are still somehow better than the keyboard vehicle controls for a lot of mainstream games, especially console ports, even though they're kind of meh, which should make a lot of major publishers/developers ashamed of themselves.

Also when you Challenge Them they say things like ""Okay Sir I Accept"" and no low rider person talk like that, ive listened to a Rap CD once or twice and it'd be more erealistic if theyre like OOOOOOH SHEEEZ DADDY-OH I BE ALL OVER DAT CHALLANGE LIKE FLYS ON THE BEES KNEES or soemthing i dont care i dont know this game suckds. its godawful.

you CAN make your car bright pink and glossy as a High Gloss Topps Trading Card so thats a good feature but the rest of the game is tedious. HOPE YOU ENJOY HOLDING THE UP ARROW KEY SUCKA BECAUSE THATS ALL THE DRAG RACES ARE and ok so what.
