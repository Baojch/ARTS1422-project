Lets start with the positives first:
+ The idea of a rock crawling game is cool
+ different worlds with ok size
+ upgradable car

But the negatives is way to many:
- awful depth, making it hard to read the terrain
- the game suffers from myopia (nearsightedness), 
which means everyting in front of you is blurry, a really big drawback
- the camera angles is often awful and controls itself, making it even harder to navigate
- bad graphics
- buggy as h***, making it really hard to finish some levels
- physics is bad and not realistic at all
- you need upgrades just to do basic stuff, but you dont get alot of cash
- suddenly the game doesnt remember the upgrades you bought
- very little rewarding to play, its feels grindy
- only 10 levels and 2 cars

It took me over 4 hours to finish it, but it should have taken maximum an hour.
So why did it take so long?
Because of the horrible bugs and faults it was very hard to finish levels without getting stuck or crash. And having to do the same levels over and over again to get enough cash to upgrade the car and unlock the next level.

To sum it up: why should you buy this game? 
Well unless someone fixes it, alot, just dont.

For an early access game, it shows promise.  But EVERYTHING needs work.  You can technically climb some rocks, but don't bother if you want to actually play a good 4x4'ing game.  Play it if you like to laugh at a broken game.  

It's UI is really holding the game back.  There is no indication of what gear you are in *at all* and that's so crucial in a game like this.  I found out you can hover the controls thing and it shows you if you are in 4x4 or 2x4 mode but he didn't even put the current gear in that popup.  He needs to make a proper UI.

The engine repair thing looks decent in the screenshots but in reality when you ""check the water"" all it does is zoom the camera into the bottle and it gives you like +2% repair for that part.  Not only is it a waste of time and a joke to look at, but you are forced to do it over and over.

Sometimes you crash into an invisible wall and you die instantly.

Level 3 is so confusing.  At the start, there is no clear indication of what to do.  If you crawl over this mountain, the starting gates are there.  But it doesn't really tell you how to get to each next gate.  I guess after some practice you could figure out the order, but there isn't any real payoff in this game.  

The whole thing is basically a waste of time.  It would be more enjoyable if the game was $1, not $7-8.  The controller support is terrible, virtually unusable.  I upgraded my tires to the large ones and then upgraded my suspension and it reduced the tires back to the tiny ones.  I ended up breaking the game at the end with -1% health and it was not possible to repair even with doing the full service nor could i continue playing.  The whole thing is an absolute broken mess.  But as I say, for a buck it would be fun.  A better name for this game would have been ""Wonky Rock Crawler.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiIIRdYaLHM

My initial instincts looking at this game were right on.  And I should have listened, however I wanted to review it anyhow, and had just enough credit for purchasing it on my account.  And now, well... I will get about my 100th practice run ar refunding a game on Steam.. YAY!  :-P

Bugs galore, everything from god awful camera controls and angels, your truck glitching through rocks and terrain, to scoring that makes absolutely no sense.  

The controls are also a mess, while using WASD makes sense, pretty much every other key doesn't and you cannot map the controls to your own liking either.  

While you can upgrade your vehicle with money earned by scoring points while driving to the finish line, that also is buggy and a a slow, tedius process.  It's likely that you'll never want to play enough to actually buy many upgrades anyhow because after spending five to ten minutes in agony trying to work your rig between checkpoints, you'll likely be ready to uninstall and request a refund ASAP!

The editor you ask?  Half the time when you try to test it by placing your car, the game locks up (for me anyhow), and the editor is a clunky, unresponsive, slow, and unfriendly mess.  It's even more frustrating then playing the levels that come with the game, so no thanks, UGH.

No, just no.  It scored a 20% in my video review and there's no excuse for this being listed as a final release and not in early access so that at least we could maybe give the developer half of an excuse for a product this bad.",1453794056,1453828873,False,49,9,0.635924637317657471,15,False,False,False,False,,,
