[b]- William Shakespeare (Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1)[/b]

[h3]Non Spoilers[/h3]

Elsinore is a very unique game, with regard to the original source material. Specifically, the moment you truly begin Ophelia's story is during Act 2, Scene 1 of Hamlet. The developers  picked a great character for the story they intended to tell. Without saying much else, I highly suggest that you give this game a try if you are a fan of Shakespeare.

[h3]Spoilers[/h3]

[spoiler]Overall centering the entire narrative around Ophelia's time shenanigans felt oddly in line with how the original story portrayed her. She was often very much in the background, besides a few instances of making herself known. This lines up beautifully with how she seems to slip into any location or scene she finds herself in. During my first play through, before gaining the looping ability, I played the game as if I was actually in the play Hamlet, letting the events carry themselves out. I've owned this game for a while now, and I still find myself coming back, just to experience the world of Elsinore, and Ophelia's sprawling narratives. Overall, my favorite ending has got to be the one in which Ophelia, her father, and her brother escape away.[/spoiler]",1712175435,1712177728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Already it hooked the theater kid in me with the combo of Groundhog Day meets Hamlet. The only thing I'd say is... It needs a little more polish.

There are plenty of paths of thought you can pursue, and in 18 hours I've probably seen almost all of it (Except a few options that don't lead to a specific ending, but lead in someone dying likely including yourself). 

I won't spoil anything, but the creators really enjoy the idea that no ending is perfect. You can't really ever WIN in Elsinore's story, but you can go with what you believe is probably the best ending. I've been told you can go into several endings, but at least most of them pretty clearly explain what the ending looks like. If you're at the end, completely done and paralyzed by choice, there is at least a youtube video which shows all the endings.

Now in terms of my overall feelings, I think it's worth experiencing. Like I said, there are some things that need polishing though. I won't expect them to have fully voiced lines for everyone, but there are some times when the exact repetition of lines can kind of get boring. Ophelia will always say the same thing when she discovers this item, as if she hasn't discovered it before. She'll act with shock when a choice she makes leads to a result she's already seen. If the creators have time at some point to add onto the game, I'd just suggest more awareness from our MC. 

Another thing I'd suggest is 'The Current Timeline' of events. In Elsinore, people will go about and do their scheduled tasks. If I follow around Hamlet all day, not changing anything at all (Creepy, true, but useful) then I would expect to have it marked down where he'll be and when. If something changes? Sure I can imagine that might throw things off. But after a few times when you want to get all the endings, it would be nice to just see the default timeline and potentially some of the conversations involved.

There were a couple bugs, but nothing game-breaking. Sometimes the camera would zoom over something, showing the dungeon when I'm above ground. Nothing major at all but worth mentioning.

Also, it feels weird to have a option to enable modern clothes, but only have it on the main characters. I get the idea behind it because there are plenty of modern renditions of Hamlet where they'll wear modern clothes, but I would've loved if they'd gone all the way with it- even if it was something like a $1 DLC or something to justify to the creators using it.

Also, yes you can pet the dogs and cats.",1705698735,1705698735,True,1,0,0.527410209178924561,0,True,False,False,True,,,

正如商店页面简介所言，这是一个以《哈姆雷特》为背景的以“时间循环”为主要特色的游戏，玩家需要做的是在不断的循环中搜集信息，并将自己掌握的情报在特定的时机告诉特定的人，从而引发特定的结果，这个结果可能是一个会提供更深层信息的事件，也有可能是一出玩家故意编排让某人出丑的恶作剧。玩家可以按照给定的传闻任务探索事件的发展结局和幕后真相，也可以出于纯粹的好奇心扰乱NPC的行为期待事态如何发展。这一点倒是和《星际拓荒》和《遗忘之城》有一定相似之处。

同时，在上述这个相当类似侦探推理游戏的玩法下，本作有完善的时刻表，会展示（玩家目前知道的）每一位角色之前已经做的和之后确定要做的特定事件，可能比一些推理游戏的时刻表都要更加细致以及易用。对话记录、人物档案、当前传闻、已搜集情报这些功能也是都有专门的栏目，略简陋，不过麻雀虽小五脏俱全。

文本相当戏剧风、或者说舞台剧风，会在一定程度上唤起久违的阅读书籍的感觉。整体剧情在《哈姆雷特》的基础上进行了相当大胆的改编和填充，同时一些原作桥段演出效果还行，对熟悉莎士比亚的《哈姆雷特》（以及其他几部戏剧）或者不熟悉的玩家其实都有照顾到。作为一个可以算是个多分支多结局的以文本为主的游戏，剧情上的几个关键点还是有一定难度的，需要充分探索互动。而游戏的多结局，看起来像是“热情莎翁粉丝疯狂写原作的IF线结局”，其实也是主角奥菲利亚对自身、对家人朋友、对国家、对命运的苦苦挣扎求索。游戏在“结局”之后还有“结局”，在“结局”之后，流程的最后期有一连串颇有戏剧性的反转，相当有意思而且比想象中要长不少，涉及剧透言尽于此。

音乐算是蛮优秀的，好几首都比较抓耳，整体的配乐数量不算特别多但对于渲染气氛已然相当足够。配音算是每一段只说开头一两个关键词或者语气词的形式，比较适合配合眼睛阅读的速度。几个结局的文本是全配音的。我要特别提到结局[spoiler] sacrifice reality for joy [/spoiler]里女主角的配音，对人物状态把握十分到位，配合这个结局特有的[spoiler] 突然猛拉卷轴的 [/spoiler]演出效果，非常有感觉。

如果要说缺点的话，除了“不喜欢文字类游戏”、“不喜欢人物长相”、“没有中文”这些可能的游戏外因素，慢热可能是一个不小的问题，在早期游戏的乐趣点并不是展现得很充分很直接。而在流程中期，“已有线索 X 人物 X 时间”这三个变量的组合带来的巨大数量的潜在可能性有点令人望而生畏。有些剧情关键点的解锁方法非常不明显，可能会卡关不短的时间而不得不查攻略。文本在多刷时的快速跳过功能其实还是有点慢了，如果是在连续几个循环尝试同一目标时，相同文本的这种文本速度可能会带来一定的烦躁感。

总结：《Elsinore》是一款以“时间循环”为题材、以《哈姆雷特》剧本为基础、以侦探推理玩法为主要特色的一款文字冒险游戏，有一些瑕疵，不过难掩其光芒。在“时间循环”这个另类的、说大不大说小不小的游戏类型之中，《Elsinore》理应占据一个不低的位置。推荐对上述要素有兴趣的的玩家尝试本作，应该会获得一段不错的游玩体验。",1699461110,1699726791,True,5,0,0.580152690410614014,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Handling so many alternative timelines and having them almost always turn out coherent is really impressive. My one quibble was how they handled the characters. They made Hamlet too much of a bratwimp - that is there in the character, but his intellectualism is completely denigrated and dismissed, and I think the adaptation would have had more integrity if they'd tried harder to preserve something interesting in the Prince: his refusal of his social role, his anti-militarism? Ophelia's transformation from the insipid character of the play into an absolute girlboss might also have been handled in stages rather than taken as the premise of the game. I think the handling of Gertrude, Claudius and Polonius was more successful, and did enough to preserve the sense that this was still the same play, Hamlet, which was what contributed so much to my enjoyment.",1690724645,1690724645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The only thing I can critique is the fact that the romance endings are horrible and devoid of logic and feel rushed, and maybe there are a couple endings that are not easy to get organically. Also, while I get that we are stuck in a time loop, repeating dialogue for repeating actions gets tiring, a ""skip all dialogue"" option while still getting information for the timesheet would be ideal, and I would have loved to be able to skip entire days without having to forward time until night.

I mainly want to something clear to people before playing this game: It's a tragedy. Without spoiling anything explicitly, when you're closing in on the ending you might feel frustrated and lost. Given what the game's about that will feel wholly appropriate. But it also feels about as frustrating as a regular point and click puzzle with fifty times more variables to think about.

In many ways, [I]Elsinore[/I] is incredible, weaving an intelligently-told time-looping story around the setting of Shakespeare's [I]Hamlet[/I]. The game sees the player taking control of Ophelia, who, after being killed within a couple of days, find herself waking up again into an ever-repeating loop, doomed to die repeatedly in some manner within at most four days. The task, then, is to explore Elsinore castle from an overhead perspective, interacting with its various inhabitants (via a point-and-click interface) in the hopes of working out what is causing the loop and, eventually, how to break it.

It's an engrossing premise, told with superb writing throughout and the level of detail and nuance available in the character interactions, alongside the huge range of permutations of events, is a highly laudable achievement. There's the occasional nod to actual Shakespearian dialog that's enjoyable to spot, but not overused and the game is perfectly accessible to someone with no knowledge of the source material. Of course, [I]Hamlet[/I] is a tragedy, so don't expect happy endings to be in abundance!

It must be said that some extent of repetition is pretty much inherent in the time-loop premise, which can become a bit frustrating when exploring events that take place later in a cycle. A fast-forward control alleviates this to some extent, but a way to accelerate the text-based dialog further would have been appreciated. Just occasionally, the event logic breaks a little - so you might encounter, for example, references to a character who's just died as if they're still alive - but this is rare and honestly, with the complexity that's involved here, this is forgivable.

You can speed up time, but if you are waiting to correct an error at the end of a loop, it can be a hassle) I also experienced a couple of bugs, though usually these were charming and a bit silly at worst.

另一位群友：“当年读书时，有大佬来讲 progressive storytelling，这个就是PPT上的代表作。”

玩家扮演《哈姆雷特》女主角Ophelia，在4天的时间循环里尝试破局、改变悲剧，13个结局各有缺憾。

原著是男主自我陶醉的绝对男性中心叙事，而本作着重描写各配角人性的另一面，以及尖锐地指出女性、有色人种、性少数等弱势人群的困境。[spoiler]我真想把哈姆雷特这个大猪蹄子丢进海里喂鱼。[/spoiler]
双商一直在线。尤其是女主，跟原著里那个脸谱化的白幼瘦无辜羊羔工具人迥然不同，外柔内刚。

缺点：
1、个别剧情有点为drama而drama，但这个缺点跟原著比已经有极大改善。
2、没有已读快进功能略为不便。
3、基本不可能出官中。（不过DeepL截图机翻效果非常好！）

我忘了备份存档文件，进了烧书结局就困死在里面了。幸好可以去油管看13个结局的后日谈。
虽然群友建议不要看攻略，但她一向侧重于原汁原味的RP体验嘛……
更倾向于收集全剧情的我的建议是：前半不看攻略，随意试错（最好是没心没肺地多制造修罗场，不然会像我这样中期卡关），卡关了或者想快速收集全结局时再去找攻略；收集了命运之书11个结局后，去C盘找到存档文件备份，之后随你喜欢，反正有油管录屏兜底。",1674163021,1712131688,True,3,0,0.550408720970153809,0,True,False,False,True,,,

・良い所

◎ストーリーとタイムリープシステムの相性
→ストーリーの奥行きがとてつもない。
主人公のオフィーリアは自分や、城の皆を救うため、
そしてタイムリープから脱出するために行動していくのですが、
問題Aが解決したら問題Bが出てきて、問題Bを解決するためには、ほっておくと発生する問題Cと問題Dをうまく起こさないようにしなきゃ…
などとやる事がいっぱいで、走り続けるはめになります。
問題を解決するために行動していくうちに、城に住んでいる他のキャラたちの秘密や真実関係などが明らかになります。
オフィーリアはそれらすべてを記憶していて、その知識によって話題が増えたり、思考してヒントをくれたりします。
そして、関係性や秘密などを把握していき、
それらをまた、人に話すことで、人同士の関係性や生死を左右することができるようになり、
それによってまた起きる出来事が変わっていく…という物凄い数の分岐が発生します。
問題の解決法も一つではないので、自由度が高い、高すぎます。

◎キャラ
→どのキャラも美点・欠点があってよかった。
何より主人公のオフィーリアが大好きになりました。
：：
オフィーリアは有色人種の母と白人の父を持ち、肌の色によって過去に辛い思いをしたこともありますが、
貴婦人という立場とオフィーリア自身の性格により、城内では大切にされています。
オフィーリアの母は逝去しており、父であるポローニアスと、兄であるレアティーズは
オフィーリアを心底愛しています。
（家族愛を感じる展開や台詞が多くあり、とても心動かされました）
原作ではヒーローであるハムレットも登場します。
過去にオフィーリアと交際していました。
今は別れていますが、ハムレットはオフィーリアに未練を残しているため、
オフィーリアの選択によっては復縁できたりします。
このハムレットが曲者で、序盤はハムレットのあらゆる方面への暴走具合に引きつつ、ハムレットが巻き起こす問題たちを解決or把握しようとする形になります。

◎エンディング（直接的なネタバレはありません）
→[spoiler] 複数のエンディングがあります。
何かを得ようと思えば、何かを失う流れになるため、ほんとに容赦ないです。
最初にエンディングにたどり着いた時は、
ここまで頑張って来て、この結末なのか…と思いましたが、
エンディングのどれもが美しすぎて、何も言えなくなりました。
オフィーリアの選択とその代償の結果と、その中で掴んだものの中で生きてゆく強さが眩しすぎて。
ちなみに、このゲームに限っては、”複数のエンディングを見る事”自体がおすすめされてはいません。
本来は、どれか一つのエンディングを見たらセーブデータが削除される仕組みだったようで、
しばらく後のアップデートで、他のエンディングも続けて見れるシステムになったようです。 [/spoiler]
エンディングの終わり、スタッフロールで流れるCount onをぜひ聴いてほしいと思います。

An intricate timeloop game focused on manipulating characters by telling and withholding information. There's a great variety of events, gossip and outcomes here, which makes the game never feel too slow or repetitive. 

[h1]You will always betray me. Every time. You cannot do otherwise.[/h1]
This might sound silly, but I'd actually describe this game as an ""information roguelite"". Elsinore is a narrative-focused timeloop game, and as such, every new timeline becomes almost like a 'run', exploring different characters' backstories and trying to achieve different endings by manipulating certain events.

And there's a lot of variation here, by the way. By using Shakespeare's Hamlet as a canvas, the game is able to craft a very intricate web of relationships, conversations and happenings that the player is able to pull in various directions. By orchestrating the death of certain characters, chaotic domino effects can occur, resulting in wildly different outcomes. As a story engine, it's a great game.

Well, what about the story itself? Is it good? Yes, yes it is. The developers do make certain alterations in regards to the original text, but I'd argue these are a net positive. Most of the cast is pretty well-developed and charismatic, and although you do become numb to their deaths after seeing them so many times (which I actually find great), I found that I still cared deeply for them. Hamlet, Ophelia, Horatio and Polonius were personally my favorites.

All in all, I enjoyed my time with this one. With me being in the control of the story, exploring different weaves and facets of each character in every 'run', I almost never became bored with the game or found its pacing slow. The storylines all intertwine and regularly reveal new information, peeling away at the layers of Elsinore.",1667769493,1667769493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Mr. William Shakespeare's classic tale of vengeance and betrayal. We ALL studied it in school. Some of us may have even performed it on stage or on camera. But whether it was really Shakespeare's best play is debatable - there are several other worthy contenders. 

Regardless of which was your favourite (or maybe you don't have one - that's cool too), one thing we can all agree upon is that the female characters in that play get the thin end of the wedge. None more so than the long-suffering ex-girlfriend of the play's titular moody prince. I am of course referring to the ill-fated Ophelia. Throughout the play the poor girl is abused, chastised, denigrated and generally put through the ringer. However, in ""Elsinore"" Ophelia is no longer a hollow plot devise but the catalyst for the whole narrative. 

The best way to describe ""Elsinore"" is if the story of Hamlet was given the ""Life Is Strange"" treatment and gene-spliced with the ""Happy Death Day"" movie franchise. In much the same fashion, Ophelia mysteriously finds herself caught in a time loop, forced to constantly live out the events of the play repeatedly for all eternity until - like Dr. Sam Beckett  from Quantum Leap - she is able to put right the calamities put in motion by her former beau and free everyone from existential Hell. 

Much of the game plays out like your typical crime investigation narrative. As Ophelia's interactions with the various other characters in the titular walled city unlock new information and new avenues toward the final timeline become more and more evident, the player discovers a largely unexplored world being constructed around them. Clearly the developers of this game made a painstaking effort to ensure that every character had an evolving backstory. Every character now feels like a well rounded person with their own thoughts, feelings and motivations. Polonius' and Gertrude in particular are taken from being largely ineffectual side characters and reframed as deeply sympathetic figures; and the side story concerning Ophelia and Laertes familial origins is worthy of a play all on it's own. 

In short, Elisinore is a fan-fiction as critique of literature. 

Which is where the one (sort of) flaw in the whole package lies. It doesn't take long for a player to notice through this game that, in comparison, the play on which ""Elsinore"" is based feels tragically thin on the ground...if you'll forgive the pun. Even as a fan of Shakespeare, it can not be denied that this retelling of the bard's work completely revises and reframes how it's viewed. For one thing, any ideas an audience might have that Hamlet is the good guy are totally demolished. Many scholars have noted that the titular prince is ruthless and oft times cruel. Here, he is at times bratty and downright cantankerous. His abuses of Gertrude and Ophelia are made beyond blatant in this game and as such players are encouraged not so much to empathise with him as to distance themselves from his selfish machinations. Perhaps this is what Shakespeare originally wanted? 

One can speculate until the cows come home. At any rate, ""Elsinore"" is an interesting expansion of the Shakespearean universe. Do look out for a cameo appearance by Shakespeare's visiting Rude Mechanical Peter Quince who drops by from the (arguably superior) ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" and the many playful references to ""Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead"". If you like your literature, your time travel narratives and your classical RPGs, you should like this game. However, Shakespeare purists may want to look elsewhere - I didn't mind though...truth be told, I prefer ""Othello"". :P

3.拥有一定的英语基础[spoiler]实际上英语难度不高，比四级低[/spoiler]，或者拥有相关翻译软件之类的
4.（加分项）对游戏内某些不和谐之处能有所包容

elsinore是一个互动剧情游戏，主要讲述了主角ophelia[spoiler]（没错，就是哈姆雷特里面那个）[/spoiler]在一次意外死亡后发现自己身处四天的循环，从而踏上寻找解开循环的道路。游戏对原作哈姆雷特的处理十分精妙，在忠于原作的同时大胆创作，弥补原作的空白。elsinore最值得称赞的是无论是主角配角，都有自己十分[b]丰富[/b]的过去。同时人物的设计也不单单是扁平的，随着时间的推移与事件的发展，你可以看到不同人的内心深处的变化——通过他们的举动。

在elsinore中，玩家与主角ophelia将一次次经历着循环，而每当循环重置时，一切都会恢复原状，无论玩家在上个循环做了什么，都不会影响到下个循环的正常进行。为此，elsinore提供了一套[b]十分完善且实用[/b]的系统，你可以通过日志查看当前事件发展以回忆线索；当玩家做出了个可能会影响到未来的举动时，时间轴系统会告诉你未来可能因你的行为而导致的变化；快进时间系统可以让你不会在什么事情都没发生的情况下毫无意义的挂机；当然如果这个循环不小心操作失误的话，也不用一直等待循环重置，死亡系统可以帮你强制重置循环。

对于新手的建议：
1.前期最好不要使用时间快进和死亡，即使你可能知道这个循环的结局是什么。
2.卡关的时候，多看看日志
3.shift键可以显示所有当前场景可以互动的东西
4.制作者设计了不止一条路线来推进剧情发展

But finally playing it now, and I think something just didn't click for me. Maybe it's that I didn't really get attached to the characters at all. Maybe it's that I had some decision paralysis while playing. Maybe it's that I didn't really feel any true connection between all the different threads of events I was investigating.

The characters do seem well written with distinct personalities, but I honestly couldn't bring myself to care for almost any of them. It's probably a ""me"" problem, but I could only really see most characters as a hurdle to get past for my next objective, with a few exceptions. Because of this, I can't bring myself to care enough to save them for the sake of saving them, only for the sake of trying to get to my next objective. 
Characters also have the problem of having what appear to be massive personality mood-swings. You can trigger an event where two characters are arguing and moments from killing each other, and then 5 minutes later they're just talking to each other like normal. Or two characters could plan to elope together, and then 5 minutes later they're arguing in the church like they've never really talked together before. Obviously with so many events to keep track of there will be some scuff with this stuff, but it's still very jarring when it happens.

One problem gameplay wise I had was that I didn't want to risk making decisions. During the game, you can speak to people about different rumors/questions you have for them, in order to get more information. The problem is, several times that I did this, a character would get mad and not talk to me for the rest of the day/loop, or do something to create a massive butterfly-effect that would impact something else I wanted to experiment with in that timeline. Because of this, I internalized that talking to people too much = bad. Obviously this isn't true in 90% of cases, but I still never wanted to risk it, which undoubtedly impeded my progress.

Another gameplay problem was that there lacked an ability to easily tell what events/dialogue you've already seen. There is a faint indicator on the Timeline window, but I would've liked to see something like greyed-out/slightly transparent dialogue, so I would more easily know what I can safely ignore when re-living events I've seen before, and what events have changed.

I also think I had a misconception about how I would reach the conclusion of the game. What I expected to happen was that there'd be a few separate plot threads that I'd need to investigate separately, then I'd bring it all together and solve it all at once in one final loop. Instead, most of the threads are relatively isolated, but you can pick which threads ending you want to make reality, after completing a specific ""main thread"" objective. In other words, there's multiple endings, which in hindsight makes sense for a time loop game like this. But again, I don't really care about the characters enough to try and reach any of these endings.

Jeg kunne ikke lide dette spil og jeg kunne ikke lide teaterstykket. Nogle siger, at Hamlet er Shakespeares bedste stykke, men det mener jeg ikke.
Men selvfølgelig har du ret til at have en anden mening, det er en grundlæggende rettighed at tage fejl.

Det minder mig om et af de kinesiske spil som Little Lilly Princess (jeg vælger dog et godt spil). Faktisk er dette spil, Elsinore, et lille uafhængigt spil, og det er ret godt, hvis man sammenligner det med en amerikansk tv-serie (minus porno), men det betyder ikke meget, blot at udviklerne ikke har råd til at gøre det så dårligt. Resultatet er dog langt under gennemsnittet.

Jeg tvivler på, at danske børn ignorerer deres lands historie, men måske kender de ikke Shakespeare og har ikke læst bogen eller set stykket men hvis du ikke kender Shakespeare eller dansk historie, kan du måske lide dette spil.
Bebrejd mig ikke, hvis du ikke kan lide det, fordi jeg ikke anbefaler det.

Note on Hamlet : 
-------------------------------
Saxo Grammaticus' version af historien er anderledes. Selvfølgelig foragtede han som kristen kvinderne (GD 4-2-3) : (*)
""Quamobrem Herminthruda virilem professa fiduciam ne in acie quidem se eum deserturam spopondit, detestabilem inquiens feminam, quae marito morte conseri formidaret. Quam promissionis novitatem parum exsecuta est. Nam cum Amlethus apud Iutiam a Wigleco acie interemptus fuisset, ultro in victoris praedam amplexumque concessit""...
""Ita votum omne femineum fortunae varietas abripit, temporum mutatio dissolvit, et muliebris animi fidem lubrico nixam vestigio fortuiti rerum casus extenuant, quae sicut ad pollicendum facilis, ita ad persolvendum segnis variis voluptatis irritamentis astringitur atque ad recentia semper avidius expetenda veterum immemor anhela praeceps cupiditate dissultat"" 

Augustin af Hippone og Tertullian ville ikke have sagt det bedre.

(*) For non-latinists and non-native dansker :  Hermutrude, therefore, declared that she had the courage of a man, and promised that she would not forsake him even on the field, saying that the woman who dreaded to be united with her lord in death was abominable. But she kept this rare promise ill; for when Amleth had been slain by Wiglek in battle in Jutland, she yielded herself up unasked to be the conqueror's spoil and bride. Thus all vows of woman are loosed by change of fortune and melted by the shifting of time; the faith of their soul rests on a slippery foothold, and is weakened by casual chances; glib in promises, and as sluggish in performance, all manner of lustful promptings enslave it, and it bounds away with panting and precipitate desire, forgetful of old things in the ever hot pursuit after something fresh. 
So ended Amleth.",1640560897,1640560897,False,3,1,0.546205580234527588,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Elsinore is a complex adaptation of one of the most widely-adapted works in Western literature, which circles out from its source material to develop the stories of each character in the play, and show how Ophelia’s fate might change if she had not only agency (absent in the original), but also the ability to see each individual story through to its conclusion. Elsinore takes the idea of the play within a play as far as it will go, with layer upon layer, backwards and forwards in time, until one of many endings is reached[spoiler], which itself is not really the end[/spoiler]. 

The writing sensitively addresses complex themes without becoming didactic and, due to the looping nature of the narrative, is able to show characters changing, based on how the player acts (or does not act), which in turn changes the player’s perception of who is right or wrong in each situation. Even after 41 loops I did not see it all, as every action has some effect, and each character has a story that continues whether Ophelia is there to observe it or not. 

Players are encouraged to take notes outside the game, as the key mechanic is the timely use of an inventory of information, whose effects change based on with whom the knowledge is shared and when. In its final stages Elsinore becomes a puzzle game, as there are ways to unlock particular outcomes that depend on specific orders of events, and finding these while gaining no new information can feel overwhelming, but the instant text option exists for a reason, and players are encouraged to use it. The bittersweet epilogues are very well done, and after spending so long with the characters, each has a real effect and reminds the player that every ending is both good and bad, and in this sense the game captures some of the human nuance found so frequently in Shakespeare’s texts, and so absent in many modern games. 

Given the source material, comparative works are numerous. Ophelia 2018 is interesting but Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead 1990 is probably a better companion piece. The historical visual novel Hampton Court is set during a slightly earlier time period but offers a much more narrow range of choices and possibilities. Well done to the Golden Glitch team (and their cats and hamsters) for making such an interesting game.

The story is intriguing. Characters can spiral into really wrong way, makes the whole time travel to save someone thing meaningful. (The key plot is a little bit contradictory and confusing in my opinion.)

However, sometimes it is very confusing. It is ok for the main plot branches, that you feel like you got clues and make an intellectual decision of what to do. But for some plot branch, you literally have to keep talking to everyone with every topic. (Same mistake of an old GBA game Detective Conan: The Dawn Monument, that you basically go through every single character and interrogate them about every single clue!)  Very discouraging when you thought you made some differences but the loop just repeated exactly the same and you have to loop through it again for one conversational change. 

Some of the branch doesn't feel too convincing. I managed to get a few more ""generic"" ending then I feel like it's too repetitive for me to reach all branches, even when I look at online hints or walkthrough. Then I decided to stop.

Unique mechanics that I hope I will see more in the future. Neat early game but later game feels less polished and thought through. Became repetitive and confusing.

The modernization of characters to make them less uniformly straight and white is pure genius, causing a very old tale to feel relevant and truthful.

The core idea, the majority of the writing and the plot are very good. The concept is fantastic, and the mysteries and options for endings are great. Including the secret ones. 

But! Boy is it not very polished. Graphically the characters look a bit silly, which is normally not an issue for me, but for the fact that your desire to repeatedly watch the same interactions over-and-over are built on the idea that you care about the characters and wish to see good/bad things happen to them. So when you have to care, and stare at them so often, the lack of polish on their appearances adds up.

By itself, probably not worth noting, but there are a number of other illusion-shattering issues. Bugs where characters suddenly disappear in front of you, or characters respond to you incorrectly (e.g. you catch them doing something, but then another event triggers and you both act like the opposite happens). These issues, when so omni-present, really become frustrating issues when you realise you have to repeatedly view/experience them, potentially 100 times, to get the information and endings you want.

Elsinore will leave the story quite literally in pieces if you don't ""manage to get it right""; and the player frustrated beyond measure once you've buried someone your character loved during your third playthrough.

But! This isn't all there is to it. In fact, you're quite literally pushed into changing things for the better - or so you presume. We slip into the role of our heroine, Ophelia, at the start of the game and get to witness all kinds of situations unfold with only one big question in mind: [i]how can we change things for the better the next time we are here?[/i] Because make no mistake, we [i]will[/i] be coming back; growing more intrigued by the plots we've discovered so far and restless in our goal to see what'll come of the decisions we've (not) made. 

Each time you step back into the familiar castle, to be awoken by Hamlet's mad ramblings and thrown into a chaos that may unfold in a completely new way, the gods roll the dice. Whether or not they are in your favour? Well, you'll find that's entirely up to you - as long as you don't bite the hand that feeds you.

My playthrough was scattered throughout several days but that only served to heighten my anticipation whenever I got around to playing another chunk of the story. The narrative is interesting and culminates in various twists and turns. Shakespeare's Hamlet was told a trillion times already so we all are at least vaguely aware of what the story entails but this game truly excels in retelling it in a way that makes it even [i]better[/i]. That is no small task but it was done with so much love and care which, despite the small bugs here and there, was truly the highlight of my gaming experience for Elsinore. I honestly commend the developers for the effort that went into this and hope to see more creative, innovative products similar to this one in the future.

I immensely enjoyed the charming, somewhat ""quiet"" structure of the daily activities in Elsinore which was a breath of fresh air. As someone who enjoys shooters as much as the next person, there's something special about a game where you just get to [i]talk[/i] to people. Ophelia isn't some kind of ""Chosen One"", she's not a hero with superpowers but an average woman with a penchant for curiosity who's thrown into an unfortunate situation she needs to figure out all by herself. This realization is actually somewhat hard to come by when you, as the player, know what she's capable of, the strings she's forced into pulling to avoid or achieve an (un)happy fate but it makes your attachment to her and the other characters that much stronger. As time goes by, you'll realize that no character in Elsinore can be treated as a black-or-white caricature of their counterparts in the original [i]Hamlet[/i], but only products of their conduct and their environment. And it's with this knowledge that you get to watch certain characters experience loss, grief, sadness and even madness over and over again. So: at which point do you stop trying to prevent a specific future from happening? How much death does it take for Ophelia to cast aside her own humanity?

For me, at least, Elsinore is not only a unique and complex way to approach and engage with the story of Hamlet, it's the only way I can imagine loving it as much as I do now. 

It's hard to point to a single feature or quality of this game and identify it as the crucial piece in that puzzle. Some combination of the modernized language, the clockwork structure which reveals the richness of the source material, the game design which asks you to become intimately familiar with the events of the play as well as the characters and their motivations and desires: all of these things, and more, come together to make the game truly worth playing, whether you're familiar with Hamlet or not. 

So if you've not read the play or seen it performed, I urge you to play Elsinore, because you might find that this game is your ideal way to experience this heartbreaking story.

[h1] Elsinore: To loop or not to loop? [/h1]

[b] Closest comparison: [/b] Zelda Majora´s Mask but as a Sims game

[b] Short description: [/b] Time loop-ish point & click adventure with Hamlet characters and a theater theme, you are trapped in a never ending story of you dying in all sort of different ways, and then waking up some days before, and you need to escape it, you can alter the outcome and ending of every loop and the more loops you do more tools/info you´ll have to do so

[b] Estimated Duration/Replayability: [/b] 4-12hs depending on how many endings you get, there are 13 endings and some require more than one loop, but there is little reason to go back once you have seen them all

[b] Best features: [/b] Lots of dialogue, well written Shakespearean characters with cool interactions and secrets to discover, lots of replayability due to it´s looping design (at least until you unlock all endings), fun puzzle-ish way of piecing together information and using it to solve different situations. I expected a kind of murder mystery but... it´s hamlet, all murders are somewhat obvious, but there IS mystery all around Elsinore and discovering secrets to later use against your enemies can be a very fulfilling experience, also getting the [spoiler] ""Exeunt All"" [/spoiler] ending was quite a fun surprise

I looked up the story after playing, and when you don't change the story, it seems like the events in the game are the same as the ones in the play.

I loved that there were many ways you could impact the story, and there are 13(!!!) endings that you can acquire. This is also one of my few gripes with the game. I wish the game would give me a bit more hints as to how to obtain all endings. With that many endings, you're bound to overlook events or things that give you a new ending. Fortunately, there is a nice non-spoiler guide here on Steam if you're a cheater completer like me :).

Repeated dialogue can't be auto-skipped, which was sometimes a bit tedious (considering that this is a time loop game), but not terrible.

The soundtrack was at its worst pleasant, and at its best gorgeous. Big thanks to the devs for the inclusion of a diverse cast of characters.

This game is amazing!!! I don't think my review will do the game as much justice as many of the other ones have, since I just finished playing it basically nonstop for two days and my brain is basically just like ""GAME GOOD!!!"" I actually upgraded my extremely old laptop partially because I was so curious about this game and wanted to play it. I love time loops, Hamlet, and mysteries, so I knew this game was gonna be perfect for me. (It even has a few easter eggs to Umineko no Naku Koro ni, which is one of my all-time favorite mystery games!)

I really love how they made the cast more diverse than a lot of other adaptations you tend to see of Hamlet. Bisexual Ophelia is admittedly what first piqued my interest in the game (I follow a curator who posts LGBTQ-friendly games), but there are many queer characters even besides Ophelia, as well as a lot of racial diversity. Elsinore is by no means a dating simulator, but it honestly just made me really happy to see some nice casual representation, and it's all handled very well & actually directly addressed in the text. (Also, I never knew how much I needed female Rosencrantz and Guildenstern until I played this! They were definitely my two faves in this.)

Some spoilers: [spoiler]I expected some sort of ""golden route"" where you could fix everything, but I was actually relieved that there wasn't one. It felt true to the tragedy of the original story, just with Ophelia given some degree of agency that she was denied in the original.

you might love and hate every individual character in their own way for their choices. you might cry at a classic tragedy without expecting to react so strongly to a tale you should already know inside and out. you might cling to these versions of these characters and never be able to look at the original script the same way again. for me, all of these things became true.

there is so much to recommend in this story that feels also impossible to do so without giving away more than i should. there are very much experiences in here that i feel strongly must be encountered on one's own. there are also secrets hidden away in unexpected plaes that, seeing all the ways the story can end, are still waiting to be found should you return to look for them once more. or many, many times more.

I quite liked it then, and I would say this game made me love it even more. As a concept, I love characters stuck in time-loops, where every time they die their story gets reset. Picking Ophelia was definitely a good option.

Now, for the gameplay. The main point is trying to solve a few missions / mysteries and advance the main plot. I have to say, I was genuinely intrigued by many of the mysteries and surprised at their eventual answers: such as, ""who is the assassin?"" While I still haven't found every ending and chosen that as my fate, I am aware that once I (or you) do that, the game resets your file and you have to restart everything. Honestly, I don't like that so much, but I can manage.

Moving on to characters, I love how the game gives more layers to Ophelia. We learn more about her backstory, see a lot of her interactions with her family, and with every time-loop, she develops into a stronger individual, making her quite a dynamic character. Similarly, to her, many other characters have their backstories expanded, adding more depths to them, such as Gertrude, Horatio, Bernardo, and so on. And the new characters aren't bad either, being integral to the story, rather than just negligible addons. Lady Brit being a prime example.

A bit of a SPOILER TERRITORY, but I found interesting something that two characters tell me in the game. That no matter how hard I try, there is no Golden Ending where I manage to save everyone and everybody gets a happy ending. It was actually quite thought provoking. The idea that you can't ""create a perfect world with imperfect human being"" (as one character puts it), who will always find some way to screw up, no matter how much Ophelia tries. I guess that explains why every ending is labelled as ""Sacrifice X For Y"". And given both that and the story, even though I don't love the idea, I can see why the game deletes your files.

Elsinore is nothing if not unique. Particularly in all the many ways it can become tedious. The game tells the story of Shakespeare’s famous tragedy [i]Hamlet[/i], but gives you the power to alter the ending by repeating the days (but not always your decisions) leading up to the play’s tragic ending. 

[b]Disclaimer: It’s impossible to talk about Elsinore without referencing the ending to [i]Hamlet[/i]. So if that is an issue, be warned: we have a spoiler-fest coming that’s over 400 years in the making…[/b]

[h1]Melodious Lay to Muddy Death[/h1]
The story of [i]Hamlet[/i] is long. Shakespeare’s longest, in fact. It begins with Denmark’s Old King Hamlet’s suspicious death and the sudden, rather odious ascension of his brother Claudius to his throne. Young Hamlet, leery about the circumstances surrounding his father’s death and roiled by his mother’s immediate willingness to jump into the sheets with his uncle, is visited by the ghost of his father. The Ghost confirms Hamlet’s worst suspicions. Armed with the Ghost’s accusations, Hamlet (not entirely by himself) kicks off a series of events whose conclusion results in the untimely, gruesome death of nearly every character.

All of this is done under the very real threat of an invasion from Norway.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2259752011

In this game, you play as Ophelia, Hamlet’s former girlfriend. In the original script, she drowns herself after succumbing to madness caused by, well, a lot of things—most of which can be attributed to her former lover. In Elsinore, instead of dying, Ophelia has a dream, or vision, detailing the original ending to the play, and thus knows the future. Armed with that knowledge, you are tasked with changing the circumstances that would ultimately lead to the play’s original tragic result. So. CHANGE IT! But be warned, should your changes not bear proper fruit by the final act, then you’re doomed to repeat time over and over until fate is satisfied. Which means…

Hamlet Part II: Mortal Coil, Time Looping Edition!!!!!

The choices you make as Ophelia, even ones that seem trivial, can alter Shakespeare’s ending. Though you have complete autonomy over the actions Ophelia takes, you don’t know how those actions will affect other characters in the world. It’s like solving for X. And with a  story as dense as [i]Hamlet[/i], trust me, there are plenty of events that can be altered. So many in fact, that it’s easy for the player to be overwhelmed by all of it. To Elsinore's credit, the game makes much-needed cuts to the original story for brevity, but still remains extremely faithful to Shakespeare’s major plot points. Same story. Less density.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2259752634 

[h1]What’s in a [Game]?[/h1]
So, now that we understand Ophelia’s objectives, what is it that you actually do in the game—read [i]Hamlet[/i]? 

Not really. At its core, the game simply delivers what one might expect from a text-heavy, story-first adventure game. No more, no less. The player’s charge is to click on all the items, speak to all the characters, and question everyone about the clues Ophelia picks up along the way. The more Ophelia learns during each attempt through the timeline, theoretically, the less she’ll have to learn later. It’s like a memory game. The player eventually learns the equations that make up the calculus within the game’s systems. 

So what are those equations?

If the player chooses an option that sets off a series of events that inevitably lead to a negative result, then the player will learn not to choose that option on their next trip through the timeline. But Elsinore is more complicated still! There will likely exist layers within each option that lead to important clues otherwise hidden. This means that many clues may only be revealed once negative results have been achieved. So you must take risks! 

The player will need either a good memory or intimate knowledge of the source material, or both. Preferably both. The game, by its nature, tends to demand more from the player who has never read or seen [i]Hamlet[/i]. 

And that’s pretty much the long and short of it. It’s a “choose your own adventure” of sorts, with an existing literary crutch. The likes of which will leave the player either enthralled or bored. It’s hard to imagine there existing any sort of middle ground. But for those who enjoy puzzle solving and exploration games with solid story foundations, or for those who enjoy a good old-fashioned “point-and-click,” Elsinore is really onto something.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2259752322

[h1]Aye, There’s the Rub[/h1]
Elsinore poses a unique challenge to the player by requiring a precondition. [i]Hamlet[/i], the play, serves as Elsinore’s strategy guide (the most famous strategy guide ever written). That’s not to say that players who haven't read it couldn’t figure out its systems and mechanics. Of course they could. But would they enjoy them? Aye, that’s the rub. 

[b]What makes Elsinore so special is also what makes it so exclusive.[/b]

It’s important to emphasize that. Normally a story-based, text-laden adventure game will repel many gamers from the start. It’s built in and it’s expected. This isn’t wholly different from most genres. But Elsinore goes beyond that. It also asks players to click through several scenes they may have already experienced many times, just to see what their new selections have wrought in their current time loop. This can get dull. The entire endeavor (rather flippantly) risks alienating many potential consumers.

But you have to respect how bold it is. 

Setting a game in the midst of [i]Hamlet[/i] is nothing if not brazen. But taking on and changing Shakespeare is even bolder still. However many people this content may drive away, it’s important that Elsinore be commended for achieving its vision. It does exactly what it intends to do.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Elsinore is one of the more difficult, unsatisfying reviews I’ve written because whether or not the player will enjoy the game can simply be broken down into these three survey questions: 

[b]Do you like story-heavy games?[/b]
[b]Do you like point-and-click adventure games?[/b]
[b]Do you like [i]Hamlet[/i] and/or Shakespeare?[/b]

If you answer “yes” to these questions, then it’s very easy to recommend. Otherwise, it’s a bit like recommending a chess game to someone who doesn’t know how to play chess. You shouldn’t do that. On the other hand, knowledge of [i]Hamlet[/i] (or the lack thereof) would also affect how one might [i]review[/i] Elsinore too. What might the reviewer say if he/she has never read the story? How might that shape their own opinions on Elsinore? It’s all I ever kept wondering.

There are games for everyone and then there are games for [i]someone[/i]. Elsinore is the latter. Even equipped with all of its unflinching pomposity, it’s still exactly what it wanted to be: a Shakespeare game.

So if Shakespeare be your food of entertainment, play on!

Each character has so much depth and color to them that I found myself in love with the story more than I already was! With so many endings, I still have to play through all 12 other endings, I can't wait to see how all of them play out! Every loop of the story keeps pulling you in and has you wishing for hope!

With small changes in the music during stressful or different events was also a fun thing to notice as I played! The voices of each character was a fun addition to imagine each character talking as I played through. Even the more stressful scores of the soundtrack were still so amazing and added a bigger depth to the scenarios at hand and placing so much more emphasis on the choices one needed to make.My only problem was the save file issue with the game, I was never truly sure if I saved before I quit, yet I somehow always did and had my save the next time I logged in to play. Everything other than that was so excellent that I don't mind the question on whether I saved or not!I do recommend this game to anyone!

The dialogue is well done - touching and witty, a nice mix of modern simple prose laced with Shakespeare quotes from this and other plays. There is a little bit of repetition due to the time loop concept, but the game shortcuts things so that you don't have to do the same set of actions each time.

Apart from the alternative paths that characters take, there's some revamping - gender-swapping of a couple of characters, some LGBTQ sub-plots, optional modern costumes - that adds to the fun and to the richness of the world.

This is a narrative disaster.

It's a bit like a book, but less interactive. And without the good smells.
You spend time reading insipid dialogue, displayed character by character of course (that's a signature move of slow designers, or maybe their idiocratic equivalent to a masonic handshake,) while listening to sighs and other silly noises. I thought it was obvious that no voice-acting at all is way better than speaking the first word of every sentence; it wasn't.

There are also silent pauses in the middle of conversations. Without a hint, so you'll try frantically to DO things, as if you were in a game, but nothing will work and the current dialogue will eventually resume.

Maybe the problem comes from the fact that the thing is advertised as a Point & Click, when in fact it seems to be nothing more than a vulgar visual novel.

I've got it: It's a gossip manager with button-smasher elements. Buttons-smashing being the only way to accelerate the gossip.
I couldn't find any way to interrupt a dialogue.
I didn't find a way to identify and avoid dialogues I had already read.
In short, that's a terrible interface.
Mind you, there isn't even a save system, so what did I expect?
Looks like the world has 1 unlimited resource: devs who don't know that the U in UI stands for User. Let's export them.

This game varies A LOT based on what you as Ophelia do. Entire plot lines and segments will or won't happen based on your actions (or lack thereof).

There's been quite a few gimmicky ways in which time-loop games have been designed. Some use knowledge checkpoints. Some allow you to bring stuff or special abilities with you back in time. Some trap you until you successfully change the fate of someone about to die. Some allow you to explore separate scripted branching paths in the story.

Elsinore does not use a gimmick. It's a fully-developed sandbox game filled with meaningful details spawning four in-game days. Everything in the game is trigger-based. You can talk about any known in-game event to anyone anytime, and it may trigger a chain reaction that will completely change the story from that point on in surprising ways, or simply create an interesting side-story that doesn't affect the grand scheme of things. Considering that the default story in the game is the tragedy of Shakespeare's Hamlet retold in modern English, and that attempts to alter it may cause even bigger issues, it is a delightful world to explore.

There are more than 10 different endings. Most have multiple, completely different ways to reach, while a few require extreme precision to satisfyingly achieve. In addition, the game features a narrative that transcends the time loop. Some of these elements feel a bit forced into the original Hamlet play, but overall it is very successful and keeps the mysteries fresh for a long time. The only real negative on that front is that as of this writing (patch 1.4.1), some endings lock other endings and require erasing all save data to access.

The game has many handy features such as a map tracking important characters and events, a timeline, a journal and a few ways to speed up time and text display, and I'm not sure how I would have finished the game without them, That said, I still feel like some important quality-of-life features are missing, such as being able to skip known events, foresee future events beyond the very limited scope already provided, replay a series of actions, classify the numerous conversation topics in a way that is actually useful, or review everything since the beginning of the game. I estimate that the lack of these features caused my gameplay time to double.

In addition, I noticed many small bugs during my first playthrough that are common in sandbox games, but nothing that really bothered me despite my high sensitivity to bugs, except for one time where I ended up out of bounds and needed to restart my game twice to escape the resulting softlock, fortunately without loss of progress.

Maybe it's just cause I'm a literary nerd, but this game felt like vindication for plowing through the misogyny, lack-of-diversity, and emo-boy Hamlet in the original.

Pros:
+A wonderful update of the classic play that is neither afraid of literary allusions for those who have studied Shakespeare while not letting that get in the way of telling a good story.  The languages is modernized but stays true to the original.  This even goes for the many endings which [spoiler]all incorporate some tragedy...even the satisfying endings.[/spoiler]

+Mechanics are very intuitive, and while eventually a little tedious (see below) it took at least a dozen hours to get there (by which point I plowed through for the sake of conpletionism.  Before then the gradual revelations left me always with a sense of what I would try next.  Stayed up far too late one night working to gain entry to [spoiler]Claudius' room[/spoiler].  Even when I thought everything had been revealed, there was more to find.

+The graphics are simple but really lovely and used effectively.

+Inclusivity was really well integrated, with gender/ethnicity/religion/sexuality all playing active roles in character stories.

+Getting to get Hamlet killed in as many ways as you can.

+Music is fitting and, while looped, was  ever grating.

Cons
-Somewhat repetitive for completionists.

I was just tired. I looked up the rest of the endings instead of playing it 12 more times just to get a few lines of dialogue and a CG.

There's just enough puzzling to be moderately challenging with no moon logic. The intrigue of how the characters will play out in each new story keeps most playthroughs fresh. Joyous moments of representation for marginalized groups and Shakespearean in-jokes are sprinkled throughout. 

There are rough edges to this indie game, to be sure. I ran into a few anachronistic dialog trees while trying to set up too many questlines at once. On one occasion, an event took place with no set up. On another, I was punished for not attending an event which did not occur. Some aspects of movement feel klunky, and the sound design and VO is inconsistent. However, such issues are relatively uncommon for the amount of time spent unraveling the game. They're worth being aware of, but don't let them deter you if you have an interest in playing.

Como recomendación a alguien lo está por empezar o recién lo empezó les aseguro que el juego arranca realmente una vez que se activa el sistema de ciclos (loop). Hasta ese momento nos va a parecer que no podemos hacer mucho o no entendemos la historia.
La verdad este juego me hizo tener ganas de leer la obra real (o por lo menos ver alguna adaptación al cine/tv!).
También como alguna especie de crítica tengo que comentar que para obtener todos los finales tuve que buscar algunos hints ya que habiendo activado todas las frases que podemos decir es difícil mantener en la mente todas las variables distintas que manejamos para producir algunos resultados.
Lo otro que no está tan bueno es que habiendo elegido un final el juego directamente borra el save con lo cual habría que rejugarlo por completo 12 veces más para ver todos los finales (esto lo solucioné copiando el save en el momento en el que los 13 finales estaba desbloqueados, ejecutando uno y al final volviendo a copiar el save).

The characters are remarkably well-written, the time period was researched thoroughly, and the themes of the game were beautiful. 

Two conversations really struck me throughout this game. One was when two characters discuss the pain of unrequited love, especially in the context of loving someone of your same gender. It's so rare to see fully developed, well-rounded LGBT+ characters in video games, and it's even rarer to see this kind of solidarity so beautifully expressed. Not ashamed to admit I cried the first time I saw that conversation. The second was when two characters of color discuss making space for themselves in a world that doesn't want to allow them that space. It struck me as deeply authentic and emotionally honest, and again, a kind of solidarity and love that isn't often represented in video games.

I also love how the writers updated Shakespeare's language while still keeping the overall message intact. That can be hard to do, and as an English teacher, I'm genuinely impressed.

Elsinore is essentially a time looping point and click game. You play as Ophelia, converse with the other actors in the play, witness events, and gather information. You can then use this information to try to influence the outcome of the play, changing the story as you go along. Whilst there is a strong element of repetition, this is mitigated as you can click through conversations fairly quickly, and fast forward through time. This unique game mechanics really works, keeps you hooked, and leaves you yearning to explore more and more of the timeline, with a multitude of different ways events can play out.

In addition, the music is great, and helps bringing about a truly Shakespearean atmosphere. The graphics are modest but functional. The only thing I wish is that the game would be fully voice acted.

All in all, Elsinore represents for me a really great and unique vision towards game design. The way the story evolves across each loop is so cleverly executed, and there is so much choice to ensure that every loop can have its own unique feel and touch.

I regret not taking a screenshot for posterity, especially since I would now need to play another twelve or so hours to get another chance; in contrast to all the time loops you go through while exploring this take on Shakespeare's Hamlet, they really want you to feel like your choice of ending is both meaningful and irreversible, to the point that you've gotta start from scratch if you want to play again. But there's already a screenshot of it somewhere in the Community section, as well as a Youtube video of all the ending narrations, so that alleviated some of the bitterness...even if such flippancy about the cast's fate is more in-line with a villainous perspective.

Anyways! Elsinore is a fascinating experience. It ran mostly fine on my i3 core laptop, though for a couple of cinematic moments, the store page's suggested minimum of i5 would be preferred. The cast of characters are fascinating reinterpretations of their classic portrayals, with even the traitorous Claudius having some sympathetic moments. The gameplay, focusing more on conversation and manipulation than the item-gathering and combining of similar adventure titles, was mostly entertaining. There was decent difficulty in figuring out how different people react to the same rumor, though some reactions just make your other efforts seem wasted, and a myriad of developments that you could see play out as well as directly get involved in.

All in all, I would call this an experience worth sharing, even for those that aren't familiar with classic literature.",1580252776,1580252776,True,3,0,0.516619741916656494,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Elsinore takes a story everyone knows and turns in into a intricate puzzle box of characters, plots, and twists equal to some of my favorite adventure, role-playing and visual novel games.

It balances between adventure-game style puzzle solving and a more expressive style of role-playing and connecting with the characters in ways you don't often see in adventure games - a style similar to an otome game (but only partially). It's a unique combination rarely seen as it puts a hefty burden on both content and structure to remain cogent. Ultimately a game like this lives or dies by its writing, and in this case it lives (and lives, and lives, and lives again).

Overall the writing tends towards making bold and striking choices - no mean feat for an adaptation of a legendary part of the English canon. Just when you think you've gotten your head around one aspect, it throws you for another loop (pun perhaps intended). Yet for a narrative focused game, the degree to which it places the player's attitudes and thoughts in a place of pride is a feat of interactive artistry. Compared to a field that sometimes punts on ""narrative mechanics"" and reduces it to a systemic set of meters, it's elating to see a game that treats the communication of concrete information and gossip as the mechanics of narrative gameplay.

[h1]Theatro Mundi[/h1]

Elsinore est le nom d'une ville Danoise qui est le cadre supposé de ""Hamlet"", la fameuse pièce de Shakespeare dans laquelle se place notre histoire. Cependant, nul besoin de connaître Hamlet pour jouer à Elsinore, le jeu explique très bien ce qu'il faut savoir et le but n'est de toutes manières pas de reproduire exactement le déroulement de la pièce, on ne joue d'ailleurs pas le héro éponyme mais Ophelia, un personnage secondaire, ancienne compagne d'Hamlet qui finit noyé. Votre première partie se finira donc de manière plutôt abrupte.

[h1]Une semaine sans fin[/h1]

Voilà donc que votre personnage se réveille dans son lit, pleinement consciente que son père se fera tuer de la main d'Hamlet et qu'elle mourra peu de temps après de la main d'une personne masquée. Comme on le sait, le savoir est sans doutes la plus puissante des armes, c'est vrai pour vous, mais aussi pour tous les autres protagonistes. Découvrez l'identité de l'assassin et il vous sera aisé de le faire arrêter. Apprenez les secrets d'une personne et il sera aisé de vous la mettre dans la poche. Vous avez l'éternité pour comprendre chaque rouage de cette semaine.

[h1]Au bord de la folie[/h1]

Bien sûr, il ne suffit pas de lâcher des informations au hasard pour obtenir des résultats. Personne ne vous croira si vous leur dites que vous être coincé dans une boucle temporelle, le simple fait de votre assassinat sera difficile à croire, et comment pourriez vous annoncer l'attaque imminente sur la ville sans qu'on vous prenne pour une folle ? Il vous faudra aussi collecter des preuves, chercher des indices, enquêter et suivre des pistes, manipuler et intriguer. Quant on a l'éternité devant soi, on apprend à être patient.

[h1]Au son du luth[/h1]

Elsinore est accompagné d'une musique parfaitement cadrée dans le thème. Adam Grubman est peu connu sur PC, mais est un compositeur expérimenté travaillant beaucoup pour différents médias. La musique colle si bien au thème qu'elle semble parfois se fondre au jeu, on en oublie qu'elle existe jusqu'à ce qu'elle change, donnant une nouvelle tonalité au jeu, appuyant les moments graves sans pousser à l'excès dans une émotion.

[h1]Comme une peinture[/h1]

Du côté graphique, Elsinore possède un joli style haut en couleur, évoquant quelque peu la peinture, alternant quelques détails précis dans des décors et quelques éléments plus grossiers, simplement évoqués du pinceau. Les dialogues sont accompagnés d'un portrait de l'interlocuteur qui montre avec plus de précision les expressions des personnages que ne le laisseraient voir les modèles 3D.

[h1]Des bases solides[/h1]

Le jeu est stable et les quelques bugs qui peuvent être rencontrés durant une partie ne bloquent pas la progression, beaucoup sont même plutôt rigolo, tel que des personnes assises dans l'air ou des erreurs de Pathfiding. Bien qu'Elsinore soit un projet de passion, créé sur le temps libre d'une petite équipe, les créateurs sont des professionnels expérimentés du milieu informatique, composé d'ingénieurs en IA et d'employés à plein temps dans des studios de renom. En revanche, Elsinore n'existe qu'en anglais et même si le jeu ne reprend heureusement pas l'archaïsme de la langue de Shakespeare, il faudra tout de même un niveau correcte pour pouvoir suivre.

[h1]Contrôler l'information[/h1]

Concrètement, Elsinore est basé sur le contrôle de l'information. Le joueur possède une sorte de journal de quête qui donne des indices sur les possibilités à étudier. Il existe une douzaine de personnages avec lesquels on peut évoquer une liste de sujet qui s'étend au fur et à mesure qu'on apprend des choses. Ce qui est intéressant, c'est que certains de ces sujets permettent de partager une information avec quelqu'un ou de changer ce qu'il pense. Le jeu nous signale, à l'aide d'une boîte de texte d'une manière qui semble grossière et plutôt bizarre au début, tel que ""Quelqu'un pense désormais Quelque chose"" et que ""Tel évènement arrivera dans le futur si possible"", ce qui s'affichera alors sur l'agenda du joueur.

[h1]La reine et ses pions[/h1]

Chaque personnage est donc entièrement prévisible puisqu'il reproduira à priori les mêmes actions lors de chaque partie, qu'on pourra vérifier sur l'agenda. Mais la force d'Elsinore, c'est que certaines informations vont radicalement changer ce que les personnages font. Quelques paroles suffisent à donner la mort ou à protéger des vies. Plus le jeu avance, plus nos options sont connues et plus on se sent puissant. Pour autant, il nous est toujours impossible de briser la boucle.

[h1]Contempler l'abîme[/h1]

On finit peu à peu par perdre pied, par ne plus voir les autres que comme des leviers qui peuvent être manipuler. On se voit appuyer sur des boutons, expérimenter avec des vies humaines, mais dans quel but ? Existe-t-il seulement une conclusion à cette histoire ? Quel prix êtes-vous prêt à payer pour arriver à vos fins ? Vous possédez un grand pouvoir, mais personne pour vous mettre face à vos responsabilités. Conserverez vous votre raison ou deviendrez-vous un monstre ?

The graphics and controls are smooth and pleasant, and for the most part, this game is a joy to play. Well done.
Unfortunately, the game also feels like a preachy comment on modern social and political issues, and that sharply pulls focus away from the story of Ophelia/Hamlet, the story we're all here to enjoy. Much of the artistic license has absolutely no purpose other than to serve as the creators' soapbox: A handful of characters were changed to mixed race, a black character was pulled in from another play, some of the male characters were changed to women, one of the characters is a lesbian, another is a gay man, one straight character decides to sexually experiment with a character of the same sex, and another character is nonbinary and transgender. I swear I'm not joking or exaggerating. Add to this the out of place conversations about racial and gender inequality and transgenderism, and you've got a disappointing game that had SO much potential.

[i]Elsinore[/i] is a pretty spectacular time-loop organization game based on Shakespeare's classic tragedy [i]Hamlet[/i]. And um... word to the wise, but it really does make you feel like garbage. Which is good, I think. If I was groundhogging the deaths of everyone I loved over and over I'd feel terrible, and [i]Elsinore[/i] captures that slow climb to desperation as you relive the same four days over and over again trying to math together how to get to a reality that's [i]maybe[/i] better than the last one you stumbled into by killing the Queen accidentally and then sleeping with her widower.

It's a game that explores a lot of ugly emotions: cruelty, hatred, boredom. Which I like actually, I like a lot, and feel that gaming needs more of if it really wants to call itself an art form. Between the ugliness and the overall emotional difficulty of the story, there lies a lot of humor, lost loves, resolute wills, tenderness, humanity. And of course there's a #GenocideRoute. Which to me is kind of high school nihilism, but I digress.

I'm really impressed. I think it's a shame that this game seems to not have received much visibility, because as a work of design, it's staggering how neatly woven all of the ripple effects are. How every little thing you do touches the world around you and yet ultimately affects nothing, furthering the feeling of being trapped. As a work of narrative, it's amazing how you get to understand all the characters so well that you know all their motivations and believe that yes, this is an inevitability for this character, whether you're getting stabbed by them or sending them to get executed.

It is kinda buggy, which given the amount of everything that's going on, I can understand. Lots of characters clip into one another when scenes overlap, triggering too many things to happen simultaneously sometimes skips you ahead on dialogue. Scenes get interrupted by scenes with more priority. Nothing major, nothing crashing.

It does have a real ""indie"" feel, with limited voice acting, character models being quite simple and limited in poses, the world, of course, is small in scale. I'm not against those things, but I know some people have grand expectations that everything be [i]Outer Wilds[/i] or something of the sort.

Otherwise I have little criticism. The game contains LGBTQ+ stories, which I love. Takes the ideas of race and class seriously in its portrayal of the world. Discusses and makes visceral its very nature, the nature of the game, and if choice is possible within a game.

And that I guess is the criticism that is not mine, but should be addressed? Choosing an ending deletes your save. There are 13 endings. None of them completely happy, as befitting a tragedy. The philosophy the game holds is that there is no real choice in a world where everything is possible and you can always turn back time to change things. A problem I have held for a long time with games where supposedly ""choices matter."" It upsets people, but I think the game is all the better for holding true to it. You get your chance to experience a story again and again until you feel numb to the idea that you have any control at all, and then you get to make a single true choice that ends it. That's pretty powerful.

[h1]A work of art, best experienced as intended... [b]but many regret how it's intended to be experienced.[/b][/h1]

The review is shorter than what I want to tell to potential new players(what I want to tell is part of the final Con actually), so here goes, my short (+)pros and (-)cons review:

(+)[b]Story[/b]= main selling point. Of course, heavily inspired by Hamlet, and I can't speak much about how well they adapted and modified it, but I like the story and it's possibilities.
(+)[b]Voice Acting[/b]= Not fully-voiced lines, but not just sighs/sound effects, although [i]basically just sighs and sound effects[/i], it voices like 1 or 2 words per sentence spoken by the characters in-game. Seeing as it's an Indie game, I think the devs have done their part and it's better than no voice acting at all.
(+)[b]Music[/b]= fitting. not spectacularly distinct.

(-)[b]slightly tedious[/b]. Basically, follow around characters, or click the map when you see a room in blue(which signifies an event/conversation is happening), learn things, talk about things to people and further investigate and try possibilities, learn from your past, die, repeat. this alone is not enough to make me dislike it. But the fact that the Timeline shows possible events only based on what we currently learn this loop makes no sense. A good example is the ""missing lute"" lead in-game. If you talk to 2 NPCs about ""missing lute"", they meet up in the castle ground. If you hear their convo, you then learn they'll go to the walls. Hear their convo, learn they'll go to the ponds and find the lute. However, the next loop/life, after talking to them about the missing lute, you only predict the 1st possible meetup on your timeline, as if you forget the things that'll happen next. BUT, information/leads, you remember/know between loops. Makes no goddamn sense to me. Atleast all things that are put in motion still happen even when you don't attend them.
(-)[b]Game could be more transparent[/b] with it's ""what-leads-to-what"". Lots of things to keep track of. If the game doesn't really provide ""what leads to what"", only relying on the player to remember things that happened in past loops, atleast I think the game should give us an in-game-notebook to type out any things we want to tell ourselves to remember in future loops. It's annoying to do wrong things over and over again because we forgot what we should and shouldn't do, example, if mentioning something causes someone to kill themselves, on the next loop, the game should warn us before we click on it.
(-)[b]Ending[/b]. Not the ending plot-wise, but how the game treats endings. Minor spoiler but you will get a magical book which contains 11 possible endings. Actually, there's 2 more secret-ish endings. However, to pick an ending, that ending must happen in a previous loop. When you do pick an ending, the thing you will get that you haven't seen before is a 5-10 minute narration/video, all either poetic, beautiful or tragic. [b]then the game DELETES YOUR SAVE FILE. not only that, YOU LOSE ALL YOUR LEADS. not only that, PLAY THROUGH THE PROLOGUE AGAIN. also, TUTORIAL TIPS. literal full on delete.[/b] This is where it has become a topic of issue with most players. I understand, by picking ""cement your fate"" on an ending, the developer intends for us to never replay the game, due to the fact you probably spent 10-20 hours on your first playthrough and wouldn't want to spend 10x10 more hours on the game. but we, gamers who like to achieve, complete, and be curious about other possibilities, want to see all endings. Well, this is what I want to say to potential new players. YOU DON'T need to see all 10 endings out of 11. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP4IczoHEJk
there, 13 endings, [b][h1]you would not lose anything by watching that video,[u]provided that you HAVE unlocked the ending in your book[/u][/h1][/b]. However, the last 2 endings are [b]best experienced on your own, since there are gameplay parts and in-game dialogue critical to those secret endings.[/b]

Further more, in my quest to see these ""secret endings"" and how to obtain them, I stumbled upon a steam thread https://steamcommunity.com/app/512890/discussions/0/1606022547904296852/ where someone attempts a speedrun of Elsinore.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl2H5gitZ_M

Now, the important thing is this. [b] you can obtain the book in less than 1 hour from a blank slate [/b]. So don't be too discouraged to see the 2 secret endings as I earlier was.

on the second video's description, there is a link to Pastebin, a site for notes basically, which provides the rundown on what to do and when, although slightly confusing. https://pastebin.com/LRGKawFZ Alternatively, just watch the speedrun and do what they do. 

Final thoughts: Good game. I wish someone told me what I'm telling you now about the endings.

It also resembles choose-your-own-adventure games to an extent, but most of the choices you make are implicit, i.e. you walk around and do things, instead of explicit stop-the-world decision prompts. And the time loop game mechanic means that most decisions are not irrevocable: you can always choose differently on your next run.

This game is so drastically better than the bulk of adventure games I’ve played on steam that it’s just quite frankly embarrassing.  I do have a degree in literature with a focus on Shakespeare…so I might be a tad biased.  The game literally feels like it was made for me. The only negatives I can even say about the game are that it’s unfortunate it’s not fully voice acted and it’s a shame the soundtrack isn’t bigger.  For a game where you are reliving day after day having a more robust soundtrack is pretty important.  However, those are minor issues in an otherwise incredible game.

So many games say your decisions matter…those games are a joke compared to Elsinore.  Every line of dialogue you spout has ripple affects that change the course of events in the game.  The idea that you are stuck in a time loop and hence constantly reliving what is happening was genius.  Having the ability to see how those ripples unfold and then going back and trying again was a joy for me.  I assumed that’s what the “Sexy Brutale” was going to be.  A murder mystery where you can use time travel to change the course of events…that was a lie.  That game is just a linear puzzle game with an extremely weak story.  Elsinore is the game I thought “Sexy Brutale” was going to be.  

Going around spying on people and finding out what type of person they truly are has a very detective feeling to it.  I found myself changing events just so I could spy on different people interacting.  I wish this game was a murder mystery with the exact same premise.  That would probably be my ideal.  Everyone knows Hamlet so it’s not really a “mystery,” but there are enough twists here that this game does border on being a mystery/detective game.  The real fun in the game comes from the simple fact that everyone knows Hamlet and probably at one time or another has thought, hey maybe if only someone had said something to Hamlet the play would not have ended in a bloodbath.  This is your chance to do so and try all sorts of ridiculous machinations.  It’s just so perfect.

Anyone who knows anything about Shakespeare can tell how much craft and care went into this game.  The writing in this game is just superb.  These developers have really outdone themselves.  I just paid $50 for Greedfall…a game with horrendous writing and a game where basically no decisions matter.  Elsinore is a bargain at $20 for the quality of writing in this game.  Sure wish these people worked on Greedfall, that might have actually been a good game if they had.  I am so excited to see what this dev team does next.  They have shown they have the writing skills that are worlds beyond the bulk of most videogames.

[spoiler] My biggest issue in the game for me is simply their seems to be no way to make Laertes King married to Brit…it’s confusing because they have dialogue that leads me to believe they will…but I never saw such an ending.  I also hated Hamlet…I never felt he should be King…he’s a crazy person, who had just an idiotic plan.  I wanted an ending where I could Kill Hamlet and either have Claudius and Gerturde happy or at least Laertes and Brit together.  I certainly didn’t want Ophelia marrying Hamelt, he’s nuts…which sure comes across in his ending since he banishes the rest of your family if you marry him.  I also do wish there was a way to turn the play from a tragedy into a comedy by having everyone happy and married off at the end…sadly there is not. Again…this is a minor concern, I'll settle for the Guilda ending huzzah! [/spoiler]

This game really gets at the idea that so many of Shakespeare’s tragedies are only tragedies because of one person’s critical flaw or misstep and all of his comedies are one misstep away from being a tragedy.

All that, however, is just a matter of minor polish, because you can easily imagine the scenarios in which those were intended to occur. What a game like this lives and dies by is its writing, and in that, the game excels. As you play, it becomes very clear that the writers have an unparalleled love for Shakespeare, and that they've honored the Bard's work in the best way they could, short of using iambic pentameter themselves. Anyone who still remembers Hamlet will note a number of interesting twists they've put on the classic play, and will be pleasantly surprised by how progressive the story is, given the era it originates from.

Ophelia has the power to change the course of events by investigating and sharing what she’s learned with others. It’s a highly interesting and thought provoking game. I would highly recommend it if you like mystery games and/or visual novels. It isn’t without its problems. I took a bit of an issue with some of the controls, the saving, and the darkness of the game.

Pros:
- Characters are extremely deep and complex. Most behave in a way that totally makes sense based on their personalities and experiences. And you even continue to learn more about their personalities and pasts as the game went on.
- So many variations in the loops! It was amazing how effort went into this game to make each loop feel so different and fresh!
- Don’t need to have seen Hamlet to understand what’s going on. It also has a lot of new stuff for long-time fans as well.
- Great story with well executed twists and turns.
- Cats and dogs you can pet
- Great music and environments
- Easy to use GUI and simple controls
- For each step in the story there are usually multiple intuitive ways that let you get there. I never felt like I knew something Ophelia didn’t. When I tried to solve the problem using dialogue options given to me by the game in an interesting way, the game let me.
- Was thought provoking enough to be challenging but intuitive enough to not be frustrating. I probably didn’t need to use a guide.
- Diverse characters! POC characters and queer characters! This isn’t just an aesthetic choice either, the issues the characters face based on their backgrounds and identities is a major focus in the game. I love a strong female lead, especially a WOC!

Cons:
- No dialogue skipping means a lot of rapidly clicking or punching the spacebar over and over again to get through dialogue you’ve seen before. Setting text speed to instant is helpful but doesn’t entirely eliminate this issue.
- Can lose dialogue options in the sea of dialogue options sometimes and spent minutes searching for what you need.
- Save files are wiped when you choose and ending (unless you hunt around on your computer and back it up). I think this was an interesting artistic choice to make your choice seem final, but in reality it didn’t work so well. In real life people don’t choose an ending, we continue to make choices until death. There were some endings where I felt like I got roped with an ending I didn’t really expect and wanted to go back and see the others had in store.
- I feel like there’s a lot of options missing from the game which would make it nicer but ruin the theme it’s trying to present. I wished I could quote Hamlet’s soliloquies back at him. I wish there was more I could do to warn and convince others of what was happening, but  that would make the theme of the tragedy not work as well, and perhaps make the bad things too easy to avert.

I really enjoyed the beginning and middle of the game, but I got disillusioned at the end with just how dark it went. [Spoiler about the nature of the endings ahead, nothing too explicit:] [spoiler]There is no purely “good” or “bad” end. Most are just depressing as hell. I did the one of the darker and morally disturbing endings last which left me a bit shaky and with a rather sour taste in my mouth. Very few ended with hopeful tones. I know the theme of the game is the inevitable tragedy, but it was just such a downer. I didn’t feel like there were lessons to be learned from most of the tragic endings. They were just sad, dark, and sometimes just disturbing. Ophelia felt so lonely without many people to honest to god talk to or believe the nightmare she was trapped in. I’m definitely someone who likes a bit of fluff, so I’m gonna have to sacrifice some reality for joy I think. [/spoiler]

I wanted to wait until I finished the game before making a review of it but honestly, I have had decision-anxiety over the ending for so long (plus, I got busy and forgot).  I bought this game because I follow one of the writers on social media and wanted to support her work and was interested in what she was producing- so going into it I had no idea what I would be playing. I've never seen or read Hamlet so the story was completely new to me as well. After playing for 8 hours I watched a YouTube video on Hamlet and the way Elsinore tells its version(s) of the story is so eloquently done! 

The mechanics are all well done. I have to say that I fully utilized the timeline, the fast-forward, the character descriptions, the map, etc. There isn't any waste in what they've supplied for you to use. In a time-loop game the dialogue can easily get obnoxious but this game does a great job of reiterating what needs to be seen again and skipping through (even comically) what doesn't need to be. The ""puzzles"" you need to solve range in challenge level and even if you don't solve one of the puzzles there's always another puzzle that can get you to the end of the game. 

Which brings me to my next point- the endings. My one issue about this game doesn't even lie with the game itself- its my own decision-anxiety that has rendered me unable to finish it. I absolutely love that you can get to an ending through so many ways but my nature as a completionist and also decision-anxiety has stopped me in making a game ending decision. 

This is a game that you could play multiple times, taking a different approach and receiving a different result every time. I'll definitely just bite the poison tipped sword and choose an ending so I can jump back in and start again! Well done Elsinore team!",1567425909,1567425909,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Ophelia relives a set of critical days over and over again, given a chance to change the course of events by learning the secrets of the court. The game it reminds me of most is Majora's Mask without any of the dungeons. The game has a living timeline which in some sense functions as the Bomber's Notebook, but the twists and turns are much more involved. It might be more fair to compare it to certain works of interactive fiction (text adventures) such as Hadean Lands, Varicella, or Lock & Key that similarly focus on solving puzzles through resets.

Fair warning: If you are the sort of person that will take issue with the fact that Ophelia and Laertes are persons of color, this is not the game for you. Some of the content seems anachronistic, but this wasn't a problem for me since this is a game about time-traveling shenanigans.

Not to say I don't have criticisms. A couple issues are minor mechanical gripes that only really started to wear on me at the end, namely that sometimes finding particular conversation topics in a large list is tedious and sometimes I wanted to be able to straight-up skip ahead in time rather than use the given fast-forward feature.

The more substantive issue is an issue with how the game handles endings. Once you want to choose an ending, the game up front lets you know that any ending will delete your save. You thus have to start from square zero (or back up your saves) to see any others in full. Now I get what the devs were going for, but when it comes down to brass tacks it's just gating content off through extraneous tedium. If only one or two endings triggered save deletion as opposed to all of them (and there are a fair number) I'd probably be OK with it.

Overall, however, the game was a unique experience and well worth playing. It ran well considering how ancient my computer is. The visuals and audio do are suitable to set the stage for the writing, which is strong.

You get to explore and dive into a surprisingly deep range of possibilities, from various murders to various romances. You get to choose narrative paths and dialogue options, like an adventure game. You also get to experiment with characters bouncing off one another, like you’re playing a game of the Sims. While doing so, you get to experience a fleshed-out world of Hamlet. Characters are adapted, reinterpreted, given expanded backstories, and feel both freshly relatable and believable to the source material. Thematically, the game dwells on the long recent fixation on choice and agency. What’s interesting is how the game emphasizes that there’s no perfect way to play or end. There are many ending outcomes, each a different flavor of bittersweet, and each feel earned and appropriate. The game’s art style is like a living painting, and while the graphics, such as the character models and animation, lack polish, they are serviceable. The music feels appropriate to the mood and setting, but can at times sound repetitive, as the game’s main theme is often reused and replayed.

That game had fantastic characters and story, so I had high hopes for Elsinore, and I was not disappointed. It also helps that I'm a Shakespeare buff--it's so fun to get to explore all the ""what-ifs"" of the play. And despite all the forking paths, added dialogue, and subplots not in the original text, it still feels true to Shakespeare's work. There were also quite a few Easter eggs for the Shakespeare fans.
It's impressive how rich the game is, especially considering the developers did this essentially in their spare time. Every time I thought I'd solved something, some new path would crop up--in a good way! There were so many great side conversations you could discover that weren't necessary to the main plot but were given depth all the same. A lot of these conversations involved issues of gender, race, and sexuality, and the underlying message, of a tragic Shakespearean woman taking control of her own fate, is a powerful one. 
The only downside is one that you would expect from a time loop: it can get tiresome having the same conversations again and again to trigger a certain action in each loop. I wish there could've been some sort of shortcut for these or a way to skip a convo you've previously had. But on the whole, an excellent game!

First of all let me just say I was HYPED the second I first heard of this game YEARS ago, a groundhog day game based on Hamlet as Ophelia? Awesome! I was in and now that it's finally out I have to say... it's just as good as I had hoped.
The game is fascinating. It takes the timeloop concept and runs as far as it can with it, depending on what you say, when you say and to whom to say it to, you can change the outcome of the tragic story of hamlet. 

The game is HUGE, not in the sense of games like No mans sky or Skyrim in terms of scale as it all mostly takes place in Elsinore which is quite small, but of scope, EVERY character you can meaningly speak to are fully developed characters, everyone with their own philosophies, vices, issues and secrets, It's an exploration of PEOPLE. Not only that, but EVERY character has a schedule you can follow or alter, it feels ALIVE in a way most open world games dream of. You have SO MANY options to change events around i'm pretty sure I still haven't seen all there is to this game. It's what's so great about the timeloop mechanic, you become intimately familiar with each location and person, I can't stress how FANTASTIC such a concept is and you know what? It made me realise that I would love this type of storytelling to be more common.

Naturally because this is also based on the story of Hamlet which I am sure most people were forced to read in school at some point, you know how it goes and you can use this information to your advantage, it rocks. What I also found pretty interesting was combining elements from other Shakespeare stories, which i'll leave for you to discover.

The voice acting is unusual in the sense that it's there but also not there, oh there were voice acters but the dialog uses the Zelda approach of words and sounds to start off each paragraph, I am okay with this, it just felt weird when characters did say full lines. Not really a point against the game, the amount of text must have been notably longer than the book so I don't blame them. But it would've been nice. The character models... aren't amazing but you'll mostly be looking at the great character portraits when they speak so again i'm a-ok with it.

Also yes, Ophelia is a person of color in this game, in fact numerous characters have had their race and even genders changed up and while I'm sure this will annoy some (for stupid reasons), my goodness does it enhance the story in every way. it does something that a lot of ""woke"" re-imaginings of older things get wrong; THEY ACTUALLY ADDRESS IT, the fact that she is a person of color in Denmark is not only explained but absolutely integral to her character and makes her WAY more interesting, the same applies to all the other characters, explaining their actions and beliefs in ways that make perfect sense and make the story more interesting and a little more fun.

NOW THERE IS ONE THING TO NOTE THAT STOPS ALL THIS FROM BEING DAMN NEAR PERFECT
With a game like this where you have so many options, you naturally have multiple endings, however with ONE, MAJOR, CAVEAT.
When you choose an ending, you lose your save files and you have to start from scratch to see them, which is likely several hours work. Sure you will be warned when certain courses of actions will lead to an end, but it still is rather obnoxious that this is a thing. Which is why I recommend you BACKUP YOUR SAVES if you wanna get the most out of the game. This is the ""almost"" part of my title and if you keep it in mind I think you will enjoy the game even more.

With that being said, I REALLY liked this game, it made me think at night of how to change things in specific way to reach a specific outcome until you get that ""AHA!"" moment, anyone interested in a relatively relaxed casual but deep heavily story and character driven based game should give this a go.",1565209873,1565209873,True,25,1,0.761714458465576172,1,True,False,False,False,,,

There's a surprising amount of representation in this game too, that I would have to say wasn't there in the play. I don't think Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were a couple of lesbian/bi women in the original, somehow. You may have noticed Ophelia is black (she's of mixed heritage) and its actually talked about!

Elsinore is hands down the most thoughtfully crafted, addictive game I've played in a really long time. 
The narrative of being an outcast and of not having power over our own lives were explored in such amazing ways with a number of characters in this game. Given that Ophelia in the original story is a girl who is used crudely by her father Polonius, Hamlet, and the king for their own gain, and goes mad and kills herself, this game asks WHAT IF that wasn't true? It's freakin empowering and entertaining to play this character with the agency she deserves, FINALLY. 
Other observations: 
1. The Story/Writing: You don't have to know Hamlet to enjoy the very compelling story of this game. And the game is welcoming and well written enough to get you familiar with the plots very quickly. Surprisingly, I never got bored. The fast forward button made it so that even though we were stuck in a time loop, it rarely got repetitive. Even then, there was SO MUCH to explore that things were constantly changing to the point that I was constantly on the edge of my seat. The story struck just the right balance between challenging and giving you hints when you need them, in my opinion. 
2. Characters: Again, you don't have to know these classic characters beforehand. But if you do, you can tell the team did their research, plus added a lot of their own twists. The character's point of views were strong and their actions logical. The relationships were deep and interesting. I found myself very emotionally invested in them. 
Diversity of Stories: Although I have played lots of games in my lifetime, it is rare if not unheard of to play as a fully realized WOC protagonist. I was also THRILLED that there were POC and Queer folks in this game. In Shakespeare's world, in gaming, and let's face it: the media, a lot of these voices are excluded or stereotyped to stupid extremes. This game did not do that. More than that, these people, including Ophelia herself, are not in the game to simply exist as faces, but are REAL and COMPLEX HUMAN BEINGS WITH hopes and dreams. I don't have to remind anybody that this type of representation is what we need in this day and age. 
To the creators, of this game, this game truly made me happy. Brava! THANK YOU!!!!!!",1564626096,1564626096,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It even has a built-in timeline view where you can see when the consequences of your actions are scheduled to come up (and which events you have made impossible in the current timeline). It's really impressive from a mechanical standpoint.

From a narrative standpoint, it also holds together remarkably well. This game often feels like a sandbox simulation, giving me a lot of freedom in how and when I try to accomplish my goals. Despite that freedom, I've almost never managed to make the game do anything weird or glitchy. The sequence of events flows admirably.

The writing is smooth and life-like. Every character has at least a little bit of backstory to them which can be discovered in a variety of ways. Some artistic liberties and embellishments keep things interesting, and I appreciated them. In a dialogue-driven game based on a Shakespearean play, what could be more important than words, words, words? Fortunately, [i]Elsinore[/i] excels in this department.

The voice acting is a nice touch. Rather than fully voicing all the lines, the characters have short utterances that convey their tone or mood alongside their dialogue text. These do a great job of establishing their personalities. For example, Hamlet's dialogue is surly much of the time, but it's his accompanying grunt of exasperation and his incredulous, ""What?!"" that firmly expresses just how restless and agitated he is.

The music is beautiful when it shows up, predominantly warm guitar and flute.

The art is an interesting combination of painterly backdrops and 3D models walking around on them. I was especially impressed by the real-time shadows when watching how they crept across the land while I moved time forward. My only complaints here would be that the 3D model animations are a bit cartoonish (they are more akin to pantomime and noticeably reused throughout), and that there are several scenes where Ophelia ""hides"" in rooms very unconvincingly. But if we can suspend our disbelief about the positioning of characters, and focus on the dialogue instead, this is not too big of a problem.

Overall, this is a well-written, well-made time-loop simulation adventure. I greatly enjoyed trying out many different strategies and watching how my choices played out. These were characters I liked spending time with. I am left wishing for more games with this amount of depth, quality writing, and clever design.

Everything I hoped. I've been waiting for this game for a very long time and was nervous it wouldn't live up to expectations, but it's far exceeded them.

Instead, you are Ophelia and if you remember your Shakespeare, you'll remember she has a rough go of it. Well, the game starts out that way but Ophelia gets to start over and see if things can't turn out a little differently. 

The positives? Great graphics, a fantastic timeline that lets you see upcoming events and plan accordingly. You also can review dialogue and even visit past timelines. You also have a nice map with the location of all the characters so you tracking your moves is very simple. I love the watercolor artwork (especially the backgrounds). A small warning, a picture of my likeness is in the gallery; the developers had to work with what they had so I apologize to all of you for any ocular affront that may occur. Remember, Elsinore is not a happy place, my picture just adds to that. In a more serious statement, the music is wonderful. The dialogue is good but the voice work is not 100% but rather a summary of what is going on. It works here but I found it took a little bit to get used to it. Finally, LOTS of endings. This is a very rich game and once you figure out what is going on (that is, why you keep repeating the last few days), the game plan shifts and you have many interesting choices; for a small development team, you will be amazed at how rich this game is.

There is so much going on within the game during each time loop that one of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to catch people at certain points. The UI in the game does a really good job of helping track all of these.

UI pros: 
[list]
[*]Easily see the upcoming events in the timeline, as well as on the map (areas where events are about to take place are deep purple, then light purple while happening)
[*]Know where characters are at any time via the map (also see which events will involve which characters based on the timeline indicators)
[*]View current and past timeline choices
[*]Goals: View your list of objectives, and see which ones have been ""stamped"" as completed. Easily read your progress under the details of any goal
[*]Characters: Don't forget to read the bios from time to time. If you figure out a particular key element, it sometimes records the info here [spoiler] - for example, if you figure out the conditions to avoid Polonius' death, or how to keep Laertes in town[/spoiler]

The only part of the UI I haven't found much use for is the hearsay section - as this mostly seems to be redundant of the goals.

But only in an RPG like Elsinore can you actually explore all the various consequences of these counterfactual possibilities, because you're constantly looping through them, so you can test and retest theories and explore multiple avenues of consequence with a player character who is just as aware of these consequences as the player, because Ophelia remembers. Just go up to Claudius and tell him you know he killed Old King Hamlet? Sure! See what happens if you tell Gertrude about her husband's ghost wandering around the battlements that you saw the other night? It's an option! 

Rewriting a game like this and centering it on Ophelia reinterprets the story as her struggle for agency in a world that ultimately seeks to limit it. It allows the player to explore a ""Hamlet"" in light of what Ophelia's increased agency would hold for the development of the story's plot, and that to me is what honestly makes this game so powerful, because it's not just ""Hamlet but Groundhog Day"" - it's ""if we gave Ophelia just a little more capacity to act in Elsinore, what might happen?""

What if she was suspicious of Claudius and decided to investigate? 

And it's very telling that, without spoilers, that the first loop the player must complete is finding some means (there were multiple, last I checked) to keep Polonius alive.

If you like Hamlet, but you love Ophelia, and you wish directors gave her a little more agency than hysteria, and you absolutely love decision-based RPGs (I'm a big Dishonored fan) where cumulative decisions matter, this is a fantastic game for you, I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Der Spieler kann sich dabei frei durch grafisch einfache, aber durchaus schön gemalte, Welt bewegen, mit Charakteren über ausgewählte Themen (Dialogoptionen) sprechen und gelegentlich weitere Entscheidungen treffen. Die Spielwelt ist so gestaltet, das an mehreren Orten etwas zur gleichen Zeit passiert, so dass der Spieler die Geschichte mehrmals spielen kann und neue Inhalte vorfindet. Wissen aus alten Zeitschleifen kann in neue mitgenommen werden, so das diese Geschichtsabschnitte auch nicht wiederholt gespielt werden müssen. Es gibt verschiedene Geschichtenstränge denen der Spieler nachgehen kann. Die Geschichte des Spieles ist sehr verzweigt: so bietet z.B. ein Schauspieler an verschiedene Aufführungen an und je nachdem welche der Spieler wählt, trifft diese Aufführung auf eine andere Resonanz bei den Zuschauern und die Geschichte nimmt einen völlig anderen Lauf. So eine Aufführung kann z.B. einem Mörder spiegeln, das andere von seinem Mord wissen. Der Inhalt ist relativ umfangreich, Wiederholungen lassen sich im Grunde genommen durch die Zeitvorspulfunktion übergehen und das Spiel bleibt auch nach vielen Wiederholungen in der Zeitschleife (Ich bin jetzt ungefähr bei 20) interessant.
Fazit: Elsinore ist ein gutes Spiel, welches eine ungewöhnliche Geschichte bietet.",1563996147,1563996147,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're interested by ""time-looping Hamlet"", or exploring interactive narratives, or you love messy melodrama, then I really recommend playing this game.

High points: 
- There is SO much that can happen in this game. One of my plans was totally foiled because one character, who I was trying to have murdered, ended up killing themselves, and then the OTHER character who was meant to get murdered ended up seducing me, and I thought ""sure why not"" and it went totally off the rails from there.
- Ophelia is a fantastic protagonist
- The difficulty is tuned well which can be really hard to get right in these kinds of games. I was often tempted to use a walkthrough, but never had to
- Many cats and dogs that you can pet
- The music is great
- The overarching story is very fun and has plenty of twists
- The supporting characters are really nicely developed. It's impressive how much they manage to get out of a few conversations. I ended up loving them all, even though you can see how their flaws line up in a way that leads to tragedy
- It actually made me like Hamlet (the character) even though I really hated him after seeing the play

This game also has a very interesting spin on the time loop mechanic and the 'accretive player character' format. It's an incredibly interesting way to adapt a work of fiction, particularly a tragedy, particularly a story that's had so many iterations already with different things happening every time over hundreds of years. 

This game is lacking polish in some parts - you will have to get used to Ophelia 'hiding' in completely plain sight, and sometimes dialogue is inconsistent with previous events. The way characters dash from place to place is a little unnatural, but it does feel like a play, too.

I'd recommend this game to fans of visual novels or interactive fiction, like Long Live the Queen or the Zero Escape games. This review ended up being way too long, but in short, BUY THIS GAME!

Note: this review is of an early access version of the game.",1563904920,1563904920,True,54,3,0.851234138011932373,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's very narrative-rich, complex and mastered. There's always something new to discover, so the sense of repetitiveness is not really felt before near the end of the game.
You don't need to know Hamlet's story already as the game deals accurately to not lose the player. There's enough options of ergonomy. It's still a rather difficult game, but in a good sense in my opinion.
You'll need 20 to 30 hours to complete it. It's really not a small game, there's a huge sum of work within it. Know that there are 11 endings to unlock plus one or two ""true"" endings after that; don't reach for a ""perfect"" end that you cannot attain before you have access to the conclusion.

On the minus side: the side stories added to the original piece may or may not please you, but can you harsh a writer for not writing as well as William Shakespeare ? I find some of them were great.
And the game I played, before the public release, had numerous bugs, including some that requested relaunching the game. But they were patched one after the other.

I highly recommend this game.",1563902495,1563902495,True,15,0,0.682658016681671143,0,False,False,False,False,,,
