When you play on the the more difficult settings progression really feels like progression. Once you go from a lower tier energy system to the next tier the increase in capabilities is  so noticeable that when I go back to other games the progression feels lackluster.

Aside from the gameplay the support is also amazing. The community has produced a lot of QoL mods as well as new features. The game does have bugs from time to time (especially in multiplayer) but even when we encountered a bug it was fixed incredibly quickly (see https://steamcommunity.com/app/254200/discussions/0/3185740024689050560/?ctp=2#c4142816945494022153), even in 2024 (almost 10 years after release!).

It feels like Minecraft and Satisfactory in one game. I love the alien environment. In Minecraft I am a builder-type where I love creating villages and in FortressCraft I can use near-infinite construction paste and a paint gun to make cool creations. The way you can fast-build is very satisfying and gives me ASMR tingles. Thanks to the community there are some cool mods that give me the opportunity to be really creative in the game. While being creative I love exploring the world as it has really cool world generation with many levels of danger as you go down the mines. The game has been keeping me busy for a long time already and I think it will still keep me for hopefully a few more years even! There are so many possibilities and upgrades and researches and projects you can do! I feel like I'm not even halfway the game, (maybe because I like to chill and be creative a lot of times instead of progressing) and that s a GOOD thing!!!
I am planning to create a Youtube video of the dedicated server that I am in right now and I am planning to create a series of the next run when we start over to create a whole different kind of village/city/factory (has yet to be decided).

Yes there are maybe some buggy hiccups. Most of the time it's because of MODs (that's kind of normal and expected xD) But with the great community and the hardworking developer that still has heart for the game we are able to fix it or make a workaround together <3 I hope I can help building recognition for this game! I would love to see it grow!

I am currently playing on a dedicated server wth @ferumu and @ximin. We are using the following expansions and MOD's :
-Adventures Pack (I am only using this one yet and I am excited for the other expansions!!)
- MOD list: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2394454483

This is a LOT more complex than older versions of Minecraft, and it requires a wholly different mental gymnastic routine from even modded Minecraft to master this game.

This game really comes in four acts: Survival, factory management, tower defense, and conquest. And then you get to do it again in the add-on materials (if you invest). Honestly, I think it is all worth it if you get the add-on content, the challenge of this game is significant even if you take the easy options on the game. Winning this requires a very industrial mindset, a bit of foresight in your planning and processes, and a sodding lot of exploitation of resources. I have gone through some games where I had to chew down millions of Copper Ore by the end of the game beause of how much you use at the end of the day. And speaking of day, even in superfast mode this is not going to be a one-session game, so plan on attacking it in phases. That's what I do, attack it in several-hour segments over the course of a couple months until the aliens fear my defenses!

All in all, well worth it.

Se puede personalizar la partida, si hay muchos o pocos recursos, ciclo de noche y dia y otras generalidades, impulsas las cosas con electricidad.

No lo jugue mucho por lo cual no termine el titulo, creo que esta bueno pero tambien con limitaciones, creo que podrian haberle agregado mas contenido de Lore y musica, no solo opciones de construccion y ya.

Es un juego de ULTRA nicho, solo para un publico MUY selecto de personas, salvo que te guste la tematica de Crafteo y bases y grindeaje de recursos, te sugiero que pases de largo.

Como detalles mas positivos debo destacar el Workshop, Multiplayer y editor de niveles, Ademas de los cromos. Lo negativo es que los DLCS no fueron agregados al juego inicial y es realmente amargo ese detalle.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The game itself is quite interesting the ovelall mechanicks are good and well implemented. This can be a nice and interesting game to play. And in the same time, it is quite old game, which is still rough on the edges. Feels like an unfinished project.
The game has build in help/wiki, and some items descriptions still says 'No description added yet' or something like that.
The progreshion and science reaserch can be confusing at times, or at least it was confusing for me, when I didn't know what am I missing to unlock some receip and the game didn't help much in figuring that out.
The gates for unlocing thing are sometime implemented simply incorectly, eg: there is a receip for MK4 batteries, which require MK3 batteris to craft, and the game was showing that I don't know the ingredients for crafting MK4 battery, even though I knew the crafting receip for MK3 battery, I just have not crafted it yet.
In summary if you are reading this in 2022 or later and are into such kind of games, you should be much better of getting and playing some different game then FortressCraft Evolved!",1668196545,1668196545,False,2,0,0.443542152643203735,3,True,False,False,True,,,

That was at 1 hour.
162 hours later, I can say this is probably the most fun I've ever had with a clearly unfinished game since playing Freelancer 18 years ago.
If you're expecting Minecraft, you'll be disappointed.
If you're expecting Terraria, you'll be disappointed.
If you're expecting Factorio, you'll be disappointed.
If you're expecting GRAV, you'll be disappointed.
HOWEVER. If you're expecting a weird orgy-hybrid of all of those games, you will not be disappointed.
For the sake of direct comparisons to those aforementioned games: 
You build with blocks and explore caves, craft items with things you find underground as well as drops from enemies. This is the Terraria / Minecraft influence.
You have to set up conveyor lines, often converging, to construct factory lines to build more complex machinery. This building attracts the attention of... things... that you must defeat. This is the Factorio influence.
You have to explore a strange, often vibrantly colored world, full of very strange flora and fauna. This world is janky, and sometimes things will just straight up kill you without a second chance. This is the GRAV influence.
The very last bit of the game is constructing a device with which to escape from the planet you wind up on, and spend the entire game on. I don't have any games I've enjoyed that have this premise, so I cannot directly compare it to anything personally.

Now where it diverges from all of these concepts is where I actually enjoy it. I'm prefacing this by saying that I've never really enjoyed conveyor-based logistics games. I'm bad at them.
You start by simply setting up resource extractors for basic minerals; copper, tin, iron. You move farther underground to more precious, rarer, and harder to extract metals. You also have to build a power grid, and use laser transmitters to beam power around to various locations, and there are many means to accomplish this. Most everything requires power, so figuring that out is a boon to your gameplay.
Conveyor systems are where I'm having a lot of fun. To a certain depth, you can adequately use conveyor belts to move your ores, bars, and machinery pieces around. I'm finding a great satisfaction in watching my ores move from the smelter, then the bars to various splitting points, to go into different machines, making different parts. It's VERY cool to watch some of this happen and has distracted me for a considerable amount of time.
You use an almost metroid-prime style scanning system to find new things and acquire new crafting recipes. This is supplemented by researching, which is supplied research pods through several crafting lines.
I have actually slightly neglected research in my first and current world because it does take a fair bit of planning to supply research pods, i don't recommend putting off research. 
At 163 hours I am at Tier 2 of 3? maybe 4 or 5? I also am refusing to look at guides or a wiki, and a lot of the streamers playing this game aren't natively English. Can't spoil it if i can't understand it, right? :D 
Anyway, this is a very fun, janky, unfinished, unpolished game. I was not expecting it to pull me in after not giving it a fair chance a few years ago. It's cheap, and it's frequently on sale. EZ recommendation.",1661592340,1661592340,True,27,0,0.756622135639190674,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I would totally recommend this game to all my friends. Pretty cool game.

One problem, for new players that have a crash in the game while in tutorial, the players has to redo the tutorial again which i got stuck on the step where i have to scan an unknown block which i already have scanned. It won't let me skip that step and move on.

I have to end up creating another survival world to fix that mistake. 

For new players who are new to the game, please do not leave the world while in tutorial. You have to progress all the way so you won't end up re-doing it again/ get stuck on a step that is already progressed before.

เราจะถูกล็อคตำแหน่งเริ่มต้นโดยฐานใหญ่เรียกว่า CPH ซึ่งย้ายตำแหน่งไม่ได้ และจะมีบอสใหญ่ Overmind เกิดใน 4 มุมแนวทแยงห่างจากตัว CPH ของคุณไปทิศละประมาณ 320m (ในเกมนี้ 1 บล็อค = 1 เมตร(m)) ซึ่งตัวบอสใหญ่ Overmind ทั้ง 4 ตัว จะคอยสร้างฝูงแมลงออกมาโจมตี CPH คุณเรื่อย ๆ ตามปริมาณการใช้ไฟฟ้าและแร่ที่คุณขุดออกมา ถ้าคุณไม่ผลิตอะไรเลยก็จะไม่มีศัตรูมาโจมตี ดังนั้นช่วงแรกคุณสามารถค่อย ๆ เรียนรู้ตัวเกมไปได้

แร่ในเกมจะมีหลายชนิด ยิ่งหายากก็จะสุ่มเกิดลึกลงไปเรื่อย ๆ บีบให้คุณต้องขุดลึกลงไปเพื่อหามัน โดยในแต่ละระดับความลึกก็จะมีอุปสรรคขวางทางคุณอยู่ด้วย เช่น ที่ระดับความลึกมากกว่า 50m เครื่องผลิตไฟฟ้าจะไม่ทำงาน เพราะไม่มีออกซิเจน ที่ความลึก 80m ลงไปจะมีต้นไม้สีม่วงสุ่มเกิดบนสายพานคอยแอบกินแร่ของคุณ แล้วส่งไปให้ศัตรูที่เรียกว่า hivemind คุณต้องสร้างป้อมปืนป้องกันสายพานเอาไว้ ที่ชั้นน้ำแข็งระดับความลึก 200m คุณต้องสร้างเครื่องทำความร้อนติดตั้งในชุดให้ได้ก่อน ไม่งั้นจะหนาวตาย และสายพานธรรมดาจะไม่ทำงานในชั้นนี้ ฯลฯ สิ่งเหล่านี้จะทำให้คุณต้องวุ่นวายในการหาทางแก้ปัญหาและหาทางขนแร่ขึ้นมาด้านบนให้ได้ 

ส่วนการผลิตของจะเป็นการสร้างระบบ automate เราวางสายพานลำเลียงแร่มา วางเครื่องจักรต่าง ๆ เพื่อเปลี่ยนแร่เป็นสิ่งของจำนวนมาก ส่วนนี้จะมีความวุ่นวายในการวางสายพานและเกมจะบังคับกลาย ๆ ให้คุณต้องมารื้อสายพานกันบ่อย ๆ เพราะยิ่งมีแร่หลายชนิดก็จะยิ่ง unlock ของให้สร้างเยอะขึ้น ดังนั้นตัวสายพานสำหรับส่งของต่าง ๆ ไปประกอบกันก็จะซับซ้อนขึ้นเรื่อย ๆ จนถึงระดับนึงก็ต้องย้ายทั้งโรงงานกันเลยเพราะพื้นที่ไม่พอ สำหรับสาย OCD ก็จะเหนื่อยเป็นสองเท่า เพราะแค่วางให้ผลิตออกมาได้ไม่พอ ต้องสวยงามด้วย

ตัวปัญหาหลักของเกมก็คือคำอธิบายที่ย่ำแย่ เกมจะมีข้อความสั้น ๆ บอกแค่ว่าให้ขุดหาแร่ XXX , YYY ไล่ไปเรื่อย ๆ ตามระดับความลึก แต่จะทำยังไง ทำไปเพื่ออะไร ไม่มีบอกอะไรทั้งนั้น นอกจากนี้เกมยังมีระบบ research ที่จะให้คุณสแกนบล็อคใหม่ ๆ ที่เพิ่งเจอครั้งแรกมาแลกกับแต้ม research point เพื่อปลดล็อคของคราฟใหม่ ๆ ประเด็นคือ คุณจะไม่รู้ว่า ควรจะ research และปลดล็อคอะไรมาใช้ก่อน เพราะคุณไม่รู้ว่ามันเอามาทำอะไร !? นี่ทำให้คุณจะเสียเวลามาก ๆ ในการเล่นครั้งแรกเพื่อลองผิดลองถูกอุปกรณ์ต่าง ๆ ในเกมครับ",1644895175,1644895175,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Release in 2015 by ProjectorGames, it introduces innovative mechanics that make it stand out in a genre that includes mainstream titles like Minecraft and Terraria.

Firstly, let's talk about gameplay. FortressCraft Evolved stands out for its complex resource management and automation system, reminiscent of Factorio. Players have to mine resources, construct elaborate conveyor system networks, and manage power grids. This automation aspect means players are constantly problem-solving, optimizing, and even reconfiguring their fortress layout—it's this intellectual rigor that keeps the game engaging.

Visually, despite being a voxel game which might remind players of Minecraft, FortressCraft Evolved has its distinct charm. The game uses detailed textures and dynamic lighting, and that provides significant visual depth. Weather effects, including snow and fog, add to the atmospheric immersion. Alien creatures are well-designed, providing a stark contrast to the largely industrial design of the player’s structures.

Narratively, like many other sandbox games, FortressCraft Evolved doesn't have a traditional story. The game employs environmental storytelling. The world is littered with traces of an extinct civilization, pushing players to be curious and explore, effectively using the narrative design philosophy of show, don't tell.

Lastly, let's consider cultural context. When it was released, the market was saturated with voxel-based games, yet FortressCraft Evolved carved out a niche due to its unique blend of genres, automation-focused gameplay, and exceptional depth in its mechanics. The game has a technology tree progression system that is practically an engineer's dream, providing the title with a sense of achievement and progression. Something to note is that like many complexity-heavy games, its steep learning curve could be a barrier for casual gamers.

In conclusion, FortressCraft Evolved is an appealing amalgamation of sandbox, survival, and tower defense genres, plausibly catering to a wide array of gamers seeking mechanical depth and strategic gameplay. The commitment to a distinct aesthetic, engaging mechanics, and subtle environmental storytelling showcases impressive game design intent. The game has definitely made its mark as an ambitious independent title in its genre.",1631140552,1699094127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

How long have you been in pre-alpha...oh sorry....I guess it's full release?
I have such a love hate relationship with this game.  I pick it up and get sucked into it for hours and then suddenly realize once again I'm just not having fun.  
There is no other game, not even Satisfactory that has the insane scope and depth of this mental passion project of...I think it's just one guy still actually.  There is so much you can do, such insane flexibility to the builds and the amount of time you can put into building city sized factories.  Yet, at the end of the day is just a Minecraft clone with a really cheesy tower defense mechanic.  There are still baked in bugs that the dev never bothered to fix that make it look so underdeveloped while he continued to pile on miles of new content.   The Arther companion bot is nearly pointless, a floating battery and flashlight that never points where you want it that you can dress in stupid costumes; because I guess just having more battery storage and a flashlight that doesn't consume power faster than your super beam wasn't annoying enough?  The enemy attackers look like blimps designed by an 8 year old and don't get me started on the early game balance or the lack of a proper explaination of core mechanics or research progression.

Despite this, I recommend it.  If you love complex builders that will suck up tons of your time figuring out the mechanics and how to optimize mass automation, this will always scratch that itch.  I will offer this quick guide to getting to the T2 machines which is the slog you must endure to begin enjoying the true game.  

Reaching T2 machines (learn from my suffering)
The T0(white) beams can be connected to each other to reach distant areas.  Use the T0 conveyors despite their very very slow speed, the idea is to automate what you can early so you can focus on progression.  You are going to need to go down, eventually to about -420m, which is a chore.  You want to dig down, carefully so as not to fall into a chasm, and then use platform lifts to go up and down.  Fit the lifts with the controllers so you can then use them as a platform to work at the desired level.    Use auto excavators to dig addition shafts back alongside your platform lifts, these will be for power down and cargo lifts up.  Always always cargo lifts to go vertical, even for short distances.  Before T2 power and beams (blue) you never have enough power anywhere, fatten up your transfer lines and have large banks at all levels where you use power.  You want to create a central working shaft where the ores come up to go into your smelters.  Don't waste your time with some sort of stair step or otherwise diagonal cutting method, dig down.  

When you hit the cold caverns, ping for air, find a cavern that you can stand above.  You want to find line of site on the cold rock so you can scan at a distance and go research the suit heater.  You absolutely cannot survive for more than seconds in the full depth cold caverns without it.  

Get organic rock for basic smelters from the weird cube camo bots that creep about in the caverns.  Don't go hunting all over creation for small amounts or risk your neck with worms walking on soft resin.  Always overbuild your defense, you never know what might tick up your threat level,  Don't bother with T1 guns, T2 are vastly superior in all ways.  Set up manual mini automations for things your cannot yet automate properly or ones you run multiple types of metals through, like stampers.

When you hit Nickel you're good, and that's when you begin proper automation.  You should have all ores rising up by sequential cargo lifts to the surface for smelting and sorting.  At that point, the true game starts and the more focused you are in getting there the less of a slog everything will be.   Avoid the following techs until you get there, robotics, minecarts, rooms, anything related to organics, anything above T2 power.  Absolutely research resin handling, advanced power grid, and alloys.

You need to set up a crazy amount of stuff to start mining some basic ore, conveying it to your base, then converting it into bars, sheets etc, then the ore vein you were mining runs out and you need to find another one, build another conveyor to your base, and after all this you might get to build something interesting. Or just more conveyors and extractors and batteries....

I've played other games where building these sort of supply chains is fun but here it's janky and awkward. Nothing makes sense from the UI to the resources or buildings, everything is either given to you too early, or too hard to obtain, too underpowered or overpowered, and never explained.

Positives:
- Lots of different buildings and per-building upgrades
- Lots of options for automation and base configuration late game
- Clever use of temperature and energy for buildings and player space suit
- Clever use of smelting and intermediate manufacturing technology (e.g. having to convert metals into sheets, wires etc)
- Cool alien voxel landscapes and sci-fi setting
- Neat scanner for finding ores and unknown stuff and researching unknown stuff
- Research isn't just based on some arbitrary ""research points"", you actually need to find and analyse things in the world  to unlock particular branches of tech

Negatives:
- Utterly inadequate tutorial
- So utterly inadequate tutorial that it needs to be mentioned as both the first and second thing on this list of negatives
- Even with guides its no help as half of them are out of date and the game has been significantly changed since they were written
- The in game tutorials and half the text descriptions seem written for previous versions too
- Lack of useful early game gear apart from initial inventory makes it more about making best use of your starting equipment than crafting new stuff to start with
- Lack of direction in early game, you are told to find your nearby crashed ship and then.... nothing
- UI is hideous, cluttered and confusing
- Nothing about the available resources or buildings is adequately explained at any point
- Resources are nonsensically extractable (e.g. it's easier to mine ore, smelt it and manufacture sheet metal than just... get wood from trees?)
- Resource availability and renewability is equally bizarre and hard to manage
- Tech tree zig zags all over the place in terms of effectiveness vs effort to research
- Also, things that require late game research to build because it has some sort of decision making circuitry should logically be just as advanced as some of the stuff you start with that has similar decision making circuitry 
- Amount of ore available seems to be unrelated to how many voxels there are (e.g. one single block of coal may have 1000000 worth of coal but a nearby vein of 12 blocks might only have 1000), adding to the general feeling that nothing in the game is balanced or makes any sense
- Poor performance even with minimal graphical settings",1624720441,1624721116,False,12,0,0.636067092418670654,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I admit, my 62 hours in this game was a blast, for even till now this game is my preferred choice over most tech involving games.

That being said, this game in its current state is no longer playable and is just a hassle to endure. The game now only works for the first 10 to 15 minutes before sucking your GPU and RAM dry, making the game run at frames that are abysmal to experience. The saving mechanics are something to frown at too, for the long waits of having to use old methods of saving game data to your disk, having the player wait several minutes just for 5 minutes of work put into your world. Of course, this game had seen better days, back when I bought the game this was crazy fun with frame drops and lag not even being a concept. Nowadays, you are just buying a bench-marking tool to see how fast it will overload your GPU and RAM before becoming unplayable. Including forcing the player to turn off the game and re-open it just to experience another 15 minutes before turning it off again.

For some good news, ProjectorGames said on October 5th on Twitter that development on FortressCraft 2 has started, for this is news I was waiting to hear. Of course, the current state of the game is nothing much but a shell of a great project abandoned, but with this news, I'm sure FortressCraft Evolved will be revived through their new game.

Highly recommended if you enjoy Factorio or FTB/Tekkit and couldn't care less that the game sucks.

The game plays similar to Factorio in its early stages. You crash land on an alien world surrounded by danger and you must automate your way to victory. Sounds pretty straightforward... Right?
...Wrong. The game throws you in with a barebones tutorial that just tells you to do things without any explanation of their functions. It then forces you to rely on an in-game guidebook that is hardly even finished, and tends to bug out with mislabeled entries or broken buttons. Sometimes entries don't even exist! (Lithium coils please?)

Now here we get into the main gameplay element: Automation. The game expects you to progress RAPIDLY. And that might honestly be an understatement. The game shouts at you to build things that you are nowhere close to having access to with your current resources, and on top of that it expects you to know how everything works off the bat from lousy descriptions. Also, despite being one of the main focal points of the game, the automation is extremely difficult to do. You are expected to be automating the tier 2 versions of most things before you even have access to iron, which is required for basically everything (not to mention just the extraordinary amount of it you need... I mean come on, 5 entire ingots of iron for a single tiny gear?! How does automation change the amount required? Where does all the material from manual crafting go?!)
Now you might be thinking, ""I'm smart, I can figure all this out on my own!"" Well, that's where you're wrong, kiddo.
The game requires that you upgrade everything ""immediately!"" even though the upgrade materials are stupidly expensive and not worth your time for the meager amount of efficiency that the new versions provide. On top of that, it's not clear from the start that you can PLACE CONVEYORS SIDEWAYS, UPSIDE DOWN, AND ON WALLS AND THINGS STILL SOMEHOW TRAVEL ON THEM FINE.

And i'm not even going to get into the DLCs which are abhorrently priced and only serve to pad the length of the game with unnecessary shit like Mutators. (Mind you, the game on NORMAL settings is projected to be 80+ hours of playtime even though, realistically, it's more than double that.)

This game looks and plays like it's in Alpha yet the dev decided it was polished enough to release...
Dude, you can't even exit to the main fucking menu from in-game. You are forced to QUIT TO DESKTOP in order to return. What kind of dev allows their game to have such a massive oversight after nearly 6 years? Also I've heard through the grapevine that the dev has abandoned this thing, as has said on twitter ""perhaps it's time for a sequel.""

Dev, if you care at all about your games, and even read these reviews, DO NOT MAKE A SEQUEL, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. FIX THIS GAME FIRST! I can't stress enough how janky and poorly executed this game is, on top of how confusing it is to learn... 

With that being said, play this game at your own risk. I admit, it is fun, but it is NOT a good or polished game by any definition of the term.

When opening machines, another button is required to open the inventory (every. single. time.) and the devs refuse to fix it. Annoying voice when changing hopper settings.

When opening machines, another button is required to open the inventory (every. single. time.) and the devs refuse to fix it. Annoying voice when changing hopper settings. Incredibly annoying warning sounds for leaving machines inactive (dev expects everyone to play the same way he does), when learning to play, machines will be idle. The button to turn off only one of those warnings is not particularly obvious, and is per machine. There is research that can be done for dlc you don't own, you only find out after doing the research. Machines have inconsistent inputs and outputs.

The plot of the game is the usual survival one: you crashed on an alien world and craft stuff to survive. Like many survival games you do so by mining resources, obtaining new recipes, etc. Where Fortress Craft is different is everything can and have to be automated. You build your factory using blocks: collectors mine ore, conveyors transport resources, machines transform resources, etc. But it is not only a factory creation game: you live on an hostile planet! Aliens do attack! The more you produce, the more they attack in response. So you can not produce as much as you can but as much as your defences can handle. It adds a nice strategic layer to the game. Another important aspect Fortress Craft shines in is terrain generation. It's not a simple height map. On the surface there are a lot of caves, holes, mountains, etc. Under the surface there are lots of huge caves, ore veins, etc. The terrain is fun to explore (and actually beautiful), both on the surface and under. Exploration is driven by the need to find resources and taking into account the terrain is essential in designing your base defenses.

The game is challenging but accessible. The tutorial is short but gives you all the information you need to start. In addition, there is a in game documentation about everything in the game (every resource, tech, etc). So you're never lost not knowing what a thing is. In a nutshell, it gives you the tools to succeed. Fortunately Fortress Craft rewards experimentation. Failing is never a big deal. You may lose some resource or time but not a lot. For example when your main unit get destroyed, you don't lose and your factory is intact. You just get no power for a small amount of time. There are lots of example like that. It makes experimenting fun and failing not frustrating.

On the technical side, the game runs very well. My system is a pretty old Linux Arch (6 years old) so I'm used to see some lags in games but Fortress Craft is actually very fluid. This feeling of fluidity is reinforced by the gameplay: removing/adding blocks is super easy and super fast! I played around 60 hours now and I haven't see any crash either. This is a very good Linux port.

To conclude, if you like base building games in survival mode, Fortress Craft may really interest you.",1602187654,1602187654,True,7,0,0.598990857601165771,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1. Крафтинг, позволяющий добывать ресурсы и создавать инструменты и технику.
2. Построение производственных цепочек для обработки добываемых ресурсов и дальнейшего развития своих... заводов, что ли.
3. Tower Defence - защита построенных строений от атак неписей насекомоподобного вида, бедных на анимацию.
Первые полчаса вам нужно только крафтить и строить базу. С этим значительных проблем у игры нет. Если бы можно было сосредоточиться на этих механиках, то всё было бы лучше, чем есть.
К сожалению, в какой-то момент начинается этап нашествия насекомых, добавится обязанность защиты построенного от местной фауны. Этот этап настолько плох, что хочется закрыть игру и не вспоминать. У местной агрессивной живности нет никакой тактики. Вот вообще нет. Они просто прут напролом волнами. А ещё они практически не анимированы, поэтому на них смотреть не хочется не только из-за назойливости. 
Когда будут отбиты несколько волн тварей, восстановлены постройки, налажена автоматическая защита, придёт понимание, что больше в игре делать нечего. Да, можно исследовать пещеры как в трейлере, строить добытчики в недрах планеты и что-то крафтить, но... Это всё не имеет смысла. Интерфейс не очень удобен. Графика - ну, она никакая, все объекты раскрашены в мрачные цвета. Ещё и дальность видимости плохая - цветной туман, через который почему-то четко видны спрайты дыма, огня и искр, только мешает. Какого-то вызова игроку нет, кроме испытания терпения из-за элементов Tower Defence.
Полагаю, если возможность установки модов означала бы тонкую подстройку игрового процесса, у игры был бы шанс. Но с момента выхода игры прошло больше четырёх лет, а модов не так уж и много набралось. Улучшающих среди них игровой процесс и графику - с гулькин нос, и те, судя по комментариям, не всегда корректно работают. Видимо, игра не особо-то и востребована. Не нужна она и мне.",1592338111,1592338111,False,7,0,0.613327860832214355,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I played this game during development and I'm still playing the game 4 or 5 years later.  The developer has added a lot of content to the game in those few years.  Purchase the Adventure Pack DLC and you have the option to specify mutators to spice up the game and make things a bit more interesting.  Frozen Factory DLC extends the factory building aspect and pushes the player underground.  I highly recommend getting these, along with the Dapper DLC.  

I have seen the developer catch a lot of flak for the DLC packages but in my opinion, by the time you buy the game and the DLC packages, you've spent around $50, which is the going rate for most games.  If you aren't sure about the game and don't want to spend $50 for all of the content, you can buy just the base game and you'll be out a whopping $13.  I don't understand all of the complaints in this regard but apparently you can't make everyone happy.  

The key to understanding this game is understanding that machines are designed to do the work for you.   If you need a hole dug for a cargo lift, use an auto excavator,  At the same time that is happening, use the Auto Builder, to install a conveyor line for iron or lithium.  The Workfloor Excavator is excellent for leveling the landscape to provide a flat area for your automation.  Getting tired of picking up bug drops?  FALCORs will do that for you.  There is very little that you will have to do by hand, if you use the machines that are available to you.  

I see multiple reviews saying there is a steep learning curve.  That may be the case somewhat but it wouldn't be much of a game if it was too simple.  That game does have an in-game suggestion system to keep the player moving in the right direction.  ""Build a resin detector"".  ""Build FALCORs"".  If you follow the suggestions, you'll generally be heading in the right direction.  

One suggestion for reducing lag as you get more and more automation running, make full use of rooms to house your factories.  This allows the game to avoid rendering things inside or outside of the room (depending on the location of the player).  Unlike modded Minecraft, the machines are more than just blocks.  They are animated and look awesome (props to the 3D designer).  The only downside to all of the animation is the game takes a performance hit as you progress.  Rooms are the developer's solution to that.  

All around good game from a single-developer team.  

Also, I hear there is a sequel being developed (Fortresscraft: Phoenix) and I look forward to playing it.  The developer does stream his development, if that interests you.",1591672474,1591672474,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

My original review is below, but I've recently picked up Dyson Sphere Program which gets ""Overwhelmingly positive"" reviews.  DSP borrows heavily from this game, and while I enjoy DSP, it's not nearly as good as this.

Original Review:
Frankly I don't understand how this game only gets mixed reviews and ""Satisfactory"" and ""Factorio"" (EDIT: and DSP) get the reviews they do.  The game is both of those with a near-infinite vertical dimension, better tower defense than Satisfactory, more complexity, depth, and exploration than either of them.

I've done multiple play-throughs on this up to the beginning of Frozen factory and after 500+ hours still get the urge to go back to it sometimes.  With random gen maps the replayability is limitless.  Different strategies can be adopted each time through, the first time I used lots of turbines and jet fuel.  Second time was lots of solar and third time was coal.  

While there combat elements are light and the game does a good job of a creepy, eerie feeling as you start going deeper.  

  It's also nice that the Frozen Factory DLC has a specific cut-in point in the game progression, so you can buy the base game for starters and not miss any content until you decide to progress into the DLC.

So many things I don't understand and you never know what kills you. 

Mind you it has a quite steep learning curve, and lot of the things I had to google cause couldn't figure how they were supposed to work. But it is an indie game from a very tiny developer, so naturally not all the way polished and chewed up for you ready on a platter. I see a lot of complaining about the UI, but I was never bothered by it. I guess as an old time gamer I'm rather comfortable with it.

Interestingly enough I never got into Minecraft, but other complex base building games like Oxygen Not Included do have my heart. This game went right on that same alley, with much more spookier touch to it.

Things I wish I knew right off the bat: superbuild by holding down ctrl, train to use that grapple hook it will save your life, building vertical upward conveyor lines is much easier by standing on top of it, than using the lift, the way the ore ping works is that the sooner the mark disappears from the view the closer the ore is, and the craftable single ore pings work really nicely deeper down.

Also, by the time I'm researching tier2 items my base is already such a horrible tangled up mess I won't be taking any screenshots anytime soon...  :,D",1588400669,1588400669,True,17,1,0.6775704026222229,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's got a steep learning curve for sure.

It's rough on the eyes at times and the performance isn't great (my rig is pretty tough and it has a hard time with this game). 

That said, it is fun. It has a similar gameplay loop to Minecraft, ARK, etc. One level/tier of technology begets another with the main caveat being that this game is all about that automation. Getting a mining-op going seems tough at first. It'll take you a long time to learn a few key components about transport and such (I definitely recommend reading the latest beginners guide for some useful tips like conveyor belts can go vertically on walls... like.. UP the mine shafts. o.0 ).

Once you get your first assembly line cranking out hundreds of copper bars and partitioning your bars off to plates, wires, coils, etc it'll start to really sink in. The biggest flaw in the gameplay loop is the way ore spawns. I'm not a fan of the system, but tbf I haven't figured everything out yet. Locating and extracting it is usually one thing, but some of the deeper ores can be way more difficult to deal with the extra challenges that come from them.

Around the time I started to learn the game's system I was met with the Tower Defense aspect of things. If you've been automating your assembly line that it should be simple enough to grab the materials you need for defending your base while your base gathers more. And once your base is strong enough to repel invaders you can continue on your merry mining mission(s).

It's rough around the edges, but there is a great game here. I sincerely hope some of the more glaring issues with graphical bugs and performance get worked out, but I don't think if you like survival crafting games with a satisfying gameplay loop that you wouldn't like this. I got it during the sale for $2.59 and I can't say I'm disappointed.

I really, really do.  But it's just not fun, in the exploration sandbox sense, or the procedural exploration sense.

I'd liken this game best to a poorly executed alternative to a tech-modded Minecraft (such as a 1.2 era FTB pack, with Buildcraft and Industrialcraft).  Minecraft provides a compelling procedurally generated exploration challenge in and of itself, while the tech packs allow players to extend much of the challenge with an equally compelling Factorio-like automation management game.  This games fumbles both aspects.

I'll start with the procedural exploration.  This game's world is utterly bland - unlike Minecraft, which makes exploration fun with a good diversity of compelling biomes and the possibility of overpowered items, this game forces you to go on wild goose chases with the resource scanner.

Meanwhile, the tech aspects are poorly executed as well.  The onboarding process is horribly designed - rather than Factorio and Satisfactory, both of which give the player access to a bare minimum to start automation and then layers on the complexity through a well-designed research system intimately tied to the player's use of existing mechanics.  The game also fails to motivate players to use the tech system.  Modded Minecraft manages this with its compelling world, which becomes easier to explore with tech; many mods add to this exploration aspect as well with additional natural structures or dimensions.  Satisfactory and Factorio both use their research system for this.  FCE utterly fumbles both its complexity escalation, and its mid-game motivation, by combining this poorly designed research system with a lackluster world, and as such this game is a chaotic jumble.",1587626083,1587626083,False,2,0,0.481994450092315674,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you are still reading this review - regardless of your answer above, you probably want to look at FortressCraft.

I think of FortressCraft is a mashup of Factorio and Minecraft.  There is some of the factory building from Factorio, and the blocky voxel-based cube wacking and building and crafting of Minecraft.

First impression: ""The UI is horrible!""

30 minutes impression: ""I am very confused and I'm not sure I'm going to keep playing.""

2 hours impression: ""This is fun.""

4 hours impression: ""This is really cool.  I can't wait to set up things in a more automated way!""

Of course this is only scratching the surface at a 2 hour mark, and even the 4 hour mark.  But at least I did not ask for a refund, and I'm pretty sure I will be playing this game long-term just to explore the technology tree and learn about how things work, mostly without following guides too much too.  The way the game presents itself is a little strange and frustrating, but it hides enough to keep my interest.

I'd say give it a try, and if you don't feel the same after 2 hours, get that refund form filled out pronto!  Otherwise you might find out, like me, that you've found a new gem.

BASIC GAME-PLAY PREMISE:
Nothing can be manufactured without power, and the only source of power is your base, which can convert fuels (such as coal) into electricity, that you can charge your suit with.  Mining modules can be placed next to batteries, which can be charged from your suit at first (and later with lasers coming from the base).  So for the first hours of the game, I find myself running all over the place to recharge batteries that the mining extractors are using, and emptying their inventory, then bringing the ore to be smelted into ingots, and moving the ingots to be used for manufacturing plates, wires, coils, etc.

Eventually all this can be laid out as a factory with belts moving ingots around and lasers keeping batteries charged.

What cannot be automated is the need to explore the map, where new objects, and flora can be found and scanned - the scanner allows obtaining research points to learn new crafting recipes.  Go deeper and further - but don't let your battery go dead or you'll start to freeze to death in the deep underground!  I really love the tension while exploring!

There's also the persistent tension that enemies may start to show up in swarms at your base, while you are frantically trying to build up a defense system!


Pros:

- Very heavily automation-oriented.  You are building a factory to mine ore from the ground and manufacture ingots, plates, wire, coils, machine housings, iron gears, ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... well hopefully you get the point... this is a VERY LONG LIST, and things won't be conveniently located so that building belts to move stuff around will become a nightmare and spaghetti factory.

- There's a grappling hook, for fast traveling.  This is convenient when trying to pull one-self out of a hole and hopefully avoid dying the 3rd time in a row in the same hole.

- If you've played Minecraft and you're used to digging holes and building up stuff - this feels exactly the same.

- Tower Defense!


Cons:

- The UI and key-shortcuts turn my fingers into a pretzel.  It's not intuitive, and was a big turn-off in the first hour of playing, and even after 4 hours I don't like the flow of keystrokes I have to go through to do things.  But this should get better after more stuff is automated.

- I haven't seen any mods for re-skinning the blocks to look better.  For example, Minecraft has mods to allow different shaders for the blocks ( https://youtu.be/EGuKYh6hTHY ).  If you find something like this, please post me a comment about it - I would love to play with changing the appearance of the game to be more atmospheric.


When this first came out many years ago, I remember thinking it was unfair that someone would so blatantly rip-off Minecraft.  Not that important, and the gameplay here is different enough, now having played it - that I think the games appeal to very different audiences.

Have fun!


UPDATE: I do get very claustrophobic playing this, because when tunneling the walls can close in and it gives me a headache and makes me nauseous.  But I later found the UI to change the Field of View, which helped.

UPDATE2: There is an ""Atmosphere"" mod for this game which makes the sky light blue and the light that hits the ground is more earth-like - it's an improvement at least.",1587613250,1708268067,True,8,3,0.520443081855773926,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It all began when I started the game in creative mode, hoping to hop into a joyful world of blocky artistry and fun times aplenty. I laid down my first block and was impressed by the game's efficient use of voxel technology! My next move was to fly over the next hill and begin construction of my superbase. I flew upward, and immediately realized something was terribly wrong. I couldn't go back down! I pressed each and every key I possibly could, smashing away at my attempt to get the hell back down to earth! But alas, my efforts were for naught. I opened all of the menus and settings pages and all I could muster up was just a few measly and useless options. There was not one to change or even look at the control scheme. Once I found out that any effort to return to land would be to no avail, I reached for the heavens and flew upward for 5 minutes. Following this, I randomly got an achievement and I'm not really sure why.

and were separated from your regular build list.  It didint bother me much because they were more or less decorative items.  

I just downloaded the game again ,today and thought i could have some fun while this virus stuff is going on.  I soon realized they put lots convenience item in DLC and they are no longer in a different tab.  They are mixed with your regular build tab and I cant seem to filter them out.   I see some shinny icon and wanted to check what the item was about, i read through and thought ...god dam ,the game have improved a lot , there are so many new items that only exited in MOD back in the days.  guess what, at very bottom they are all ""DLC only"". I see them eveytime when i open my build list and only knowing I cant build them.

I have no problem with them selling convenience buildings early on, at least put them in a different tab. but they are pushing those DLCs in a fked up way. I paid for your dam game when you were in EA...sigh

This game I can play for hours and hours. It is great fun, challenging and one of the best builder/factory/infrastructure games out there Period!
I do however recommend getting frozen factory and adventurer pack. Those packs will make the difference and well yea, game doesnt feel complete without em.
There are also some awesome mods made for this game, making it even better.
You can find a small but very helpful community on discord, and workshop is great for finding the best mods.

One last tidbit though, this is a game mainly developed by a single person, so if you expect AAA quality, you may expect to much.

Minekravt+BC,ICと似たように見えます。違うのはだいたい以下の通りです。
まずこのゲームでは下がやけに深いです。まだ底は確認していませんが2000mぐらいまでは掘れました。
→下に64mしかないとつまらないという方はこっちのほうがいいでしょう。

アイテムや機械たちがまともな解像度の３Dモデルでできています。敵のモデルには違和感あるけど。
→ピクセルグラフィック(ドット絵)はあんまり…という方はこっちのほうがいいでしょう。

Terraria等にあったフックショットが初期装備
→移動がおっそいとだるいと言う方はこっちのほうがいいでしょう。

敵が攻め込んできます。
→防衛ゲーが好きな方はこっちのほうがいいでしょう。factorioっぽい感じと説明する方がいる理由のひとつかも？

ゲームシステムがややこしく、説明を読まないと厳しい部分が多いです。
→今現在日本語には対応していません。あしからず。英語がわからない方やわかるけどマシンの説明読むのが面倒臭いという方には他ゲーのほうがいいでしょう。

敵のデザインがきもちわるいです。
→虫が嫌いな方やウネウネしたなんかが嫌いな方は他ゲーのほうが良いでしょう。

建築用ブロックの種類は少なめです。
→わしは建築がやりたいんじゃ！！！！！という方は他ゲーの方が良いでしょう。


操作はヘルプに書いてあるのでショートカットキー一覧なんかが気になったら見てみたほうがいいでしょう。

I want so much to like this game, I really do. I've put almost 150 hours into it. I've been urging friends to play it with me. I've wanted so much to play it without mods the first time then with mods the second time. I am finding myself unable to enjoy this game much anymore. Now I am pushing to play the game instead of looking forward to it anymore.

THe game is incomplete. It's not finished. This isn't just my opinion this is clear facts when you play the game and from the words of Devs in their own discord. The ""point"" of the game is to defend your starting structure from bugs that periodically attack. When it's desroyed you are mildly inconveninced for a few minutes while it 'reboots' then everything is back to normal. There is pretty much no losing in this game. In the first 60 seconds of the game you crash your ship and then you start playing right next to that crash.The crash remains there the whole game. You can't do anything with it. It's just there taunting you the whole time. Resin expands is big bursts and surges to the point that it seems like it spawns in hundreds of blocks at a time rather than the slow trickle you would expect when mynocks can't stay alive for more than a couple seconds at a time to feed anything.

YOu don't really get to craft a meaningful fortress. The enemies all just fly right over your walls.

If this was an early access game I would give it a pass. But not only is this NOT an early access game... this game has already gotten multiple DLCs published. 2 cosmetic, 1 that is mostly cosmetic but has a couple bonus items, and 2 that are actually intended to expand the game into new realms of gameplay. New realms of gameplay when the core game is not done yet.

I am going to allow comments on my review. My hope is that sometime in the future when this game gets an update that brings the core game to a more finished state, someone will yell at me. I'll come back and give it another try. Maybe my review will have to be changed then!

One of the lessons you have to learn quickly is anything worth making by hand is probably worth making thousands of using automation.

The gameplay follows a deeper is better strategy, where the farther you dig, the better resources you can collect, but put down that pickaxe, you won't be doing it by hand.  Instead once you find the ore you need, you craft a miner machine, supply it with power, find a way to bring the spoils up to the surface using conveyors, tubes, minecarts, elevators or a combination that best suites the situation (you can't refine underground) and refine the resources so you can set up assembly lines to craft the componants you need.  You of course also need power for all this, and power attracts the local fauna to attack.  Thus you need turrets, missiles, etc to fend them off (they all fly though so walls aren't going to cut it).

All in all, it's a different sort of minecraft-like game, which couldn't really be made in minecraft even with mods.  You can (and will eventually need to) dig thousands of blocks down, and encounter huge caverns that are legitimately terrifying to witness when you first break through the roof of the cavern.  It is quite a sight.

In any case, I highly recommend this game to those who like modded minecraft or factorio, but you will have to likely put more then 11 hours into it to understand the depth of gameplay there is to be had.

I feel like I've robbed the developer now that I know it's one guy that created the game with some help. One guy. He created all the stuff in this game. In his home office. 

It's an older game, so the graphics are not going to push your GTX 1080 to it's limits. However, it's not about the graphics; it's about the mechanics and progression. Some say it's ""Factorio in 3D."" Well, perhaps. There are similarities and parallels you can draw between the two as far as automation techniques, but FortressCraft stands on it's own. 

Many reviews state the game doesn't tell you how to do anything, which has only been true in a few aspects from my experience. I had to search up some stuff on the Fandom wiki once or twice, but beyond that, it was pretty obvious how things worked after fiddling around with placement or settings.  

For the most part the tutorial gets you far enough along to get up and running. The in-game reference / guide will help you after that. The reference only has one potential spoiler if you read past the spoiler warning. Otherwise, if you haven't discovered something yet it just says it's ""unknown material.""

You can sink a lot of time into this game. I've seen people with 800+ hours on it. That's after building a massive base and mastering the mobs that it will attract. 15 hours in and I'm only tunneling down to level 120 or so; hitting tier 1 / 2 ores and starting to unlock improved smelting and material transport machines. There's SO much more I can do in the game.

Overall, if you like Factorio, I think you'll enjoy this game. You have to like puzzle solving, automation (efficiency / production) strategy, and making revisions of your existing layouts.

plants, trees and the worst  world design in gaming history . i love being full of seeds cause i can mine them from 800 blocks away. pair that with if you have a full invetory you cant even add to existing stacks. 

want to remove a big rock  or tree just hold a button and watch it dissapear.  non stop beeping from the ui has me wanting to go bull in a china shop, sounds like im at mcdonalds seriously dev you are garbage  for subjecting me to the nonstop  beeping for hours on end cause the developer dose not have a clue what a ""good game "" is

 Decoration  blocks are beyond dumb in a game of automation if i want 1000 wall, floor or window  blocks i must click my mouse 1000 times. represented by a ill conceived system of making paste outa blocks then turning them back into somthing 1 block at a  time. 

the world setup is weak if i want less resorses no just less resorses no no no if you want it down by one you get overall less ore blocks with less minerals per block takes twice as much ore to make a bar and you dont get nearly as much starting materials. that is one hell of alot of small changes just for one setting but its what i have come to expect from a product as crude as this. the world menu is sucks aswell as i have accidentally deleted worlds a problem i have never had on any other game but this one. 

the recepies  are also a dissapointment why bother having recepies that make sence when the rest of the game makes little to none.

the spider bot is always glitching out leggs spinning, walking through blocks, floating just like eveything else

 the tower defence mobs like everthing else are hollow and lifeless 

the worms cant see them if trigged by my coop players just like not seeing the guns or elevetors they are using. and when i can see them they just run one animation again and again while looking just as out of place and lifeless as the tower defense mobs. 



i would spell check this but  steam dosn't seem to do that and given i spent like 575 hours on this turd. a number that will never see another hour. Im done with this crap. and to all the people that cant figure out how someone can be unhappy with a game with 100+ hours invested. this is how.

 the money i spent on the base game and DLC. frozen factory, adventure pack, and vip skins i could care less about. Im more upset i gave this game a fair shake when i knew dam well it sucked from day one.  so i wish i never played one hour on this product. i wish i was within arms reach of the developer. although its probably a good thing i am not. 

summary get a second job instead of giving someone money a game that plays like a job  aka fortresscraft evolved.

But this review is going to be mainly about the negatives of FortressCraft Evolved.

First of all, it clearly isn't complete. There are still glitches happening, some people's resolutions have issues, and a new player starting up the game isn't exactly learning much with the tutorial. Adding to this issue, they've literally given up on updating the game any longer. It's a problem.

Second of all, progression is confusing. After the tutorial ends, you still have to figure out how to do most of the stuff in the game, you don't know what to build and when, plus I thought this was supposed to be a tower defense. That means players need to prepare for a fight early. And I managed to get through the WHOLE GAME (not including the annihilation of all the Hiveminds) with only a ray gun. And not only that, you have to journey far from your base to research, and the game's environment and enemy hiveminds aren't exactly encouraging going more than freaking five inches from a turret.

Otherwise, the game is great. Worth buying, but I really think the developers gave up on it while there were so many issues. If the developer of FortressCraft Evolved is reading this review, please continue your work on this game. It could become one of the best sandbox/tower defense games on Steam with enough effort. And if you don't want to continue updating the game, at the least, get someone to continue updating FortressCraft.",1575237249,1575237249,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Fortresscraft evolved is nothing short of amazing.
An open world, procedurally generated to be actually limitless (you cannot reach the edge of the ""X"" axis on the map).
Starting out with a few simple tools, finding the resources needed to automate your production line, making it more efficient, gaining the ability to grow your assembly and protect it from attacks by the hostile entities seeking your doom.
I love the power supply system.
I love the conveyors, hoppers and smelting aspect.
The machines that take a purified and smelted ""bar"" of a metal and form it into so many different things.
If you were to imagine it as a ""tree"" of creatable objects it would branch fairly far.
And each one useful, each one needed, arbitrary ""advancement"" items kept to an absolute minimum.
I believe they've nailed it, there will never be a game like this again, it could not be done without basically ripping off FCE's format.

One of a kind, nearly perfected, and still being perfected.
This game has been growing and changing for years and the effort of the result is clear.
Anyone who likes the ""make a factory self sufficient to achieve ""X"" will love this game.
Buy it, try it.

Not part of the review but more a note to the devs:
To be straight I love factory games. Creating a complex self sustaining system with the ultimate goal of ""escape from planet you're on"".
Fortresscraft elvolved is the ultimate example of this game format, and executes it better than any other ""construction line"" based game I've seen.
Many attempt this, it's a massive, and I mean MASSIVE goal. The work that has gone into making FCE what it is is nothing short of impressive, and the devs need to know the community sees this and understands what's gone into doing what they've done.
So here you go. I see it, I understand it. And I'm impressed, and grateful.

FCE is similar to tech-based Minecraft mod-packs like FTB and Tekkit. There are a lot of differences in the way things work, but I think this comparison is the easiest way to explain what FCE is about.

There are some long term goals provided in FCE such as building an orbital energy transmitter or defending your central power hub from resin growth and mob attacks. 

You won't need to mine ores by hand in FCE as the game is heavily focused on automation. Ores are gathered from veins with ore extractor machines. 

Eventually, you can build cargo lifts which carry materials up from 500+ meters below ground, auto-crafted missiles fed directly to launcher turrets and more.

The tutorial is terrible & unclear about many things so learning to play is a chore in itself, and I'm from the old days where games didn't have tutorials at all, you simply deciphered how to play. But that isn't anywhere near the worst of it because you can eventually decipher how to play the game. The interface doesn't allow you to change many settings, for example keybinds, while the game is running. You must completely close & restart the game to change most settings, or even look at them. Still not the worst part. The game is BUGGY AS HELL. Was playing with my friend but he was frequently being disconnected. Spent more time troubleshooting why he was being disconnected than I did playing the game. Thought perhaps 1 of my other devices was consuming all my internet or my ISP was being buggy or something, but nope. After many hours of testing & monitoring my network/internet for various causes, I found my internet went to absolute shit every time somebody connected to my server. No, not because my internet wasn't good enough. My router has a bandwidth monitor I frequently check, and my internet was at less than 1% utilization while my friend was connected to my FortressCraft server, but I could watch my PINGs to Google increase from 24-26ms with 0 dropped packets to 400-700ms with 10% dropped packets. It would become so severe it would disconnect my friend, at which point my internet returned to normal PING responses, but all the while my internet utilization never exceeded 1%. That isn't even talking about the server crashes experienced after building some objects, which caused the server to very quickly fill up all 24GB of the server RAM before crashing.

there were more hiccups with this game than there should have been. confusing mechanics, enemies that were broken, confusion as to what to do next. and the gravity was just a nightmare to fight with.

this is NOT a finished game.

i understand that the game is done, its not being developed anymore and that's why i'm writing this review.

the premise is really good, the gameplay has a lot of promise, but that's all it has, its not done, it is really messed up in a lot of places that need work but the work will never happen so i have to give this a negative review.

i understand that some of it is my own incompetence with playing, there were mechanics i never understood, but some things are outright broken and the devs knew but never fixed them.

on several occasions i died to invisible enemies that are only visible inside their kill range, energy management isn't bad mid to late game but early game its so frustrating to make elevators without outright dying to holes, and momentum while using your grappling hook is a dice roll every time even after i got better at it.

digging which is one of the main aspects of this game is not fun sometimes, you hit a single ore you cant dig? too bad dig another 400 deep hole a few blocks to the side, or build a bunch more lasers which takes all your resources.

i spent 30 minutes digging through an ore deposit i didnt want to go around because i kept running out of energy using superdig, it took FOREVER and was tedious.

the game can be fun. i had fun, but its not done and the longer you play the more you need to do and the laggier everything gets, and theres less reward for significant more time-investment. 

i had automation for pretty much EVERYTHING and dang was it satisfying at first but then the next tier of stuff was just... it was still so far away. it wasn't a triumph anymore, it sucked it away.


this game was new and interesting and fresh feeling when i first picked it up but the more i played it the less i liked it, to the point where i just didn't want to play it anymore and it hasn't gotten any better. theres no more promise of bug fixes or improvements, its done, its abandoned by the devs and i cannot recommend this to anyone.",1569650175,1569650175,False,19,1,0.640323996543884277,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Build an array of jet turbines to power your Orbital Energy Transmitter, then launch an orbital strike on the Overmind.  Build a gigantic Magma Bore in the Cold Caverns.  The bore, nearly 80,000 cubic meters in size and requiring 1 billion power, pipes in lava from the depths to take out the creeping Cryoplasm.

Not to mention teleporters, minecarts, jetpacks, gems, hydroponics bays, solar panels, missile turrets, rail guns, explosives, logistics drones...

And it's multiplayer!

(Minecraft und Factorio sind mit Mods zusammen sicher auch so komplex wie dieses spiel, aber FortressCraft Evolved kann das ohne Mods, im Gegenteil ich benutze Mods um FortressCraft Evolved einfacher zu machen LOL. Ausserdem Greifen dich Monster in Wellen an...)

 ICH LIEBE DIESES SPIEL
 
Es soll von 1 Person programmiert worden sein...
wen ja ist er oder sie ein GENIE...
Das Spiel ist nicht überall sauber ausgearbeitet einige kleine Bugs gibt es durchaus. Einige Animationen wirken so als würden sie nicht zur eigentlichen Welt gehören, wie diese Wurm-dinger... aber der spiel Inhalt gleicht alle negativen dinge wieder aus. Ich weiss nicht ob ich je alles Automatisieren können werde. Ich verstehe auch die Kritiken an dem Spiel aber an die Leute die wie ich das spiel für 2.60Fr.(80% Rabatt) Bekommen haben und jetzt eine schlechte Kritik schreiben: Ihr seit Unfair!

Update:
Seems like dev abandoned this, and before that made some nerfs, so even what was playable is gone. Oh I regret getting this and not refunding it, SO much.

The game has only a minimal tutorial (there even is an option to make it shorter).
Reminds me of my beginnings with Minecraft, same style go-and-see. Not having a clue.
The wiki is poor for this game.
In-game help section is long.
I have no idea of a crafting tree, how big is it, exactly what are the prerequesites.
Energy mechanics took me a while to figure what stores, how to send, ptg seems to expensive at first.
The game requires for you to go far and scan unknown blocks, otherwise you wont be able to progress with your base, which for me was interrupting my workflow.
I once ran out of research points.
Once I got stuck in the tutorial.
Keybindings and interactions with inventory are not intuitive. Using different key to open and then to close each screen is not ergonomic. I cannot drop items. I cannot pick them from a belt. Animation for each item picked from floor was too much.

I wrote AHK script after 4 hours of playing:
[code]
#IfWinActive FortressCraft ahk_class UnityWndClass ahk_exe FC_64.exe
CapsLock::
Send e
Sleep 10
Send i
return
[/code]
It opens a chest (hopper) and then my own inventory so I can put items there, instead of only being able to take them out.

Interface confuses me so much.

Toolbar kindof cluttered, I mean [7] for the seventh slot, why the brackets, thats not looking good.
Another aspect are those names: extrudor, vexen, pyrothermal (which I couldnt even get to be able to craft it), excavator, 4+ types of transport belts - occupying only space.
And icons: frequently i found myself looking for an item and it was hard to distinguish them.
Lack of tooltips near the cursor, bottom of inventory is not a convenient place for them

After a while I had recurring notifications on my screen, and they were not helping.
Many types of those stampers, extruders, okay I get that, but the lack of my basic resource flow setup and splitters all added to the difficulty to plan and make items go where I want them.

The look and feel turned out to be too futuristic/ space themed for me.
When I was looking for help, I saw videos of an earlier version and there was even grass! How pleasant!
I had purpleish sky around my base, and even darker: nights -- werent encouraging me to quest for scans.
I wanted a gun but couldnt get it.

Nice tools and concepts.
Just too hard to accomplish a working setup.

What I don't like about Fortresscraft are optimization, clunky automation options and progression. Things like belt filters, merging belts, requesting items from chests are really inefficient to use.

Zrażała mnie jednak cena, która w początkowej fazie odstraszała.

Teraz kiedy rozwój gry został zakończony skusiłem się i zakupiłem tytuł. 

Gra jest przemyślana i mimo, wydawałoby się organicznego rozwoju i dodawania do niej przeróżnych nowości, stanowi jednolitą spójną produkcję. Podział na poziomy technologiczne, sam sposób przechodzenia na nie i jednoczesna presja ze strony kilku diametralnie różniących się zagrożeń, sprawia że gra się przyjemnie. Dodam, że to w jaki sposób jesteśmy atakowani, zależne jest bezpośrednio od stopnia naszego rozwoju, a w szczególności od 3 czynników: produkcji energetycznej, wydobycia surowców i ich przetopu, ostatecznie zwiększa się poprzez kończące rozgrywkę, ładowanie Orbital Energy Transmitera. Za sprawą tak przemyślanego systemu możemy obronić się przed zagrożeniami bardzo łatwo, nie ma wymuszonej czasem presji.

Sama gra posiada 2 dodatki powiększające rozrywkę o kolejne godziny walki z nowymi zagrożeniami poprzez nowe sprzęty i technologie.

Co do zagrożeń i walki z nimi.
Gra się w systemie tower defence, bronimy naszego centrum dowodzenia przed atakiem przerośniętych os, pszczół czy szerszeni i ich jeszcze bardziej wyrośniętych mutacji. Prócz tego w ziemi czyhają olbrzymie twory przypominające raka trawiącego ciało człowieka, same zaś rozrastają się poprzez sieć narośli, które atakują pasy transmisyjne przesuwające ciężko wydobyte złoża. To tylko w podstawowej wersji dodatki, rozwijają nowy typ zagrożeń. 

Całość jest robi wrażenie rozmachem. Wielkie konstrukcje, potwory i duże przestrzenie, a także bezustanna penetracja ziemi w poszukiwaniu nowych złóż metali, kryształów czy paliw daje dużo frajdy.

Minusem gry jest oprawa graficzna, która odstrasza surowością. Nie jest to rzecz niszcząca przyjemność z rozgrywki, ale na wejściu może zrazić do zakupu. Jednak to co jest zaletą wymienioną w poprzednim paragrafie zostaje uwidocznione i dla niektórych może odstraszyć. Optymalizacja, mimo że twórca poczynił ogromne kroki, przy dużych bazach i hordach przeciwników, również jest piętą achillesową. Gra daje szeroki wachlarz maszyn oraz sposobów ich zastosowania co sprawa, że chce się rozwijać bardziej i bardziej, co w pewnym momencie skutkuje zmniejszeniem FPSów. Na szczęście nowe sprzęty nie odczuwają dużych różnic, szczególnie, że gra oparta jest na Unity, ca daje możliwość zmniejszenia detali.

It's been a long time. Seeing the development of it build up gradually over time has been quite interesting to say the least. I've gotten endless hours of enjoyment out of the game all the same. There's something relaxing about getting something set up and watching it do its job. Hard to believe it's finally out of early access.

For those who don't know anything about this game, think of it like a sort of marriage between Factorio and Minecraft. Primarily you'll be building a base, but building the base up attracts waves of flying insects to assault the base. My recommendation is to play it so that if the bugs kill your base, it just disables it for a time. Treating the game mode of ""your base can't be destroyed"" as the default would be like playing Terraria or the other two aforementioned games with permadeath right off the bat, you'd have a bad time of it.

Don't worry too much about the influx of negative reviews recently, I assume people are upset because there won't be more free content/fixes as the developer has finally put in the last patch. For its price the game is well worth the cost, cheaper than minecraft yet with more content I'd say, at least for an automation buff like myself.

The game has a bit of a learning curve to get into it, but once you get rolling you'll be laughing. Plus it has jetpacks and grappling hooks, did I mention that? Endless enjoyment grappling around places. There's mod support too for those who enjoy that.

Unfortunately almost every idea in this game is half baked and poorly implemented. It's an incoherent jumbled mess of unfinished and buggy machines.

There are tons of cool systems and tools built into the game, and it is visually cool to see the automation at work, even if the draw distance is pretty limited and unoptimized. 

On the other hand, a lot of core gameplay basics are tough to get going, and requires that you move really fast to not get taken out early on -> you will need to find and exploit a ton of resources to get basic defenses up and working at all since things like lithium are not quickly available to help with solid logistical automation. 

I would recommend it... except that Factorio is just a superior game - it lacks the 3d component and some of the crazy energy management - but Factorio has better features, development, and core gameplay loop.

Ultimately I like a lot of what is here, but it is tough to recommend it across the board.

バージョンアップによってかなり遊べるようになったそうです。私はついこないだ購入したので昔を知りませんが、プレイしたところ、特に致命的なバグや、操作性の悪いところ、カメラワーク、いろいろ見てもMineCraftと比べても特に劣っている感じはしません。
唯一、フック付きロープのアクションがすさまじく激しく速くて酔います。ただ、高い所から地面に叩きつけられない限りはノーダメージであり、使いようによっては垂直の壁も登れるし、穴に落ちても斜め下にワイヤー連打しながら落ちればダメージ無しだったりして、使いこなせば行動範囲が広がりますし、無理なら階段なりリフトなり作ればいいので無問題です。

MineCraftより優れている面もあります。「CTLキー＋設置」で、設置場所から自分の位置まで一気にブロックを配置できること、建材のブロックは所持していなくても材料の建材ペーストがあれば配置時に自動的に生成配置してくれること、この２つがとにかく便利。
電力がレーザー送受信なのは電線を引かなくていいメリットと自由に曲げられないデメリット両方あるかな。

マイナス点としては、日本語不対応で、装置の使い方や研究の重要性などを理解するのは相当大変な点です。特にホッパーチェストの動作はトリッキーでコンパクトに密集させると思い通りに動かないことが多々あります。この装置はなんで動かないの？と思ったら、ゲームプレイ動画を調べてみましょう。これも主に英語ですが配置は真似できます。

あとは、探索面では世界が広すぎることも注意点で、具体的に言うと鉄鉱が70m、リチウム鉱が120mくらい地下にあります。これらが無いと基本的なアイテムであるところのホッパーチェストや電池が作れず、よって銃やバッテリーブロックを作ることができず、それまでは初期から持っているチェストやバッテリーブロックでなんとか工面する必要が出てきます。
というわけで、とにかく早い目に縦穴を120m掘るんだ。なぁに120mの穴でもワイヤーで簡単に出入りできる。話はそれからだぞ。

ちなみにその次の金鉱は地下300mくらいだそうです。遠いな！

Factrioみたいにチュートリアルシナリオ（車まで作るとクリアとか）とかあればもう少しとっつき易いのかしら。

This game goes deep. Deep into the underground and deep into complexity. While many other ""infinite world"" games tend to focus on overworld exploration and expansion, the typically used overground play-field in FortressCraft Evolved wouldn't exceed far beyond a 600 blocks wide square surrounding the spawning point. It might underground though, depending on the resource scarcity settings. But no matter the scarcity, you will have to dig several hundreds of blocks deep to find the later game resources. Even deeper with the Frozen Factory expansion. And to make this comfortable you get a grappling hook, elevators, lifts, rail systems and even teleporters along your journey.
This game doesn't focus on building pretty houses (Although the creative mode does allow that!). You're mainly going to solve problems. Simple ones like how to get iron from the underground to your surface base and harder ones, like how to supply your missile launchers with a constant supply of plasma imbued (or cluster) missiles to defend your base from the ongoing stream of attacking aliens who just do not like the fact that you are exploiting their planet's resources. To accomplish this you get to research a metric ton of different tools that you can combine in creative ways to build a factory in three dimensions that will completely satisfy any automation needs you might have. But first though, you'll have to learn to use them.
The learning might take a few hours and can be frustrating at times, but the community is very responsive in giving answers and a plethora of information already exist online, should you not find answers in the in-game [H]elp. Throughout the game, there is always a mission to accomplish to progress further to endgame. But it is in no way necessary to follow that right away - you can just go run around, improve your smelting setup, refine the auto-crafting, experiment with a machine you haven't used yet or just watch your machines do the work for you.
There are two expansion DLC available that will expand the playtime for hundreds of hours and then some more DLC of cosmetic nature. Even if you don't buy this on sale, you get a bargain of playtime per money.
Be warned, this is not a casual game. You will want to invest many, many hours into it and if you don't like thinking, go play some shooting or bouncing game.",1549741076,1550411008,True,5,1,0.481088846921920776,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is shockingly unpolished for its age and the developer flat out saying “I am done working on the game.”

On the positive side, if you’re looking for a game where you mine resources and make stuff, this game provides. Badly. One of the problems I’ve always had with Minecraft is the lack of anyone explaining things to you. FCE follows the same thing by giving you a tutorial on mining coal and how to make/transport power…and that’s it. The game doesn’t explain storage chests and how to use them without contamination, why you have no gun to start with and oh by the way you’re under attack by something that has no consequence for losing. Half the game’s items are missing their help files and the in-game help isn’t substantial enough while the only wiki around is severely lacking.

Reasonably your objective is to leave the planet but you never do that when you “complete the game”. Instead, you land, you build stuff, kill some stuff, build a big thing, kill more stuff, kill enemy spawners and then dive down 250m to do it all again. Then come back to the surface and spend tons of resources and power to make a really big gun. What’s the reward for all this? Nothing. The enemies stop attacking but you might have wanted those for resources.

The DLC feels almost exploitative with some of the things you might expect to be in the base game to be packed behind there. While we’re here, could somebody explain the use of robots to me? This isn’t to even bring up the numerous technical glitches regarding pop-in, blocks not visually disappearing when mined, everything ignoring walls when it comes to flying or combat, teleporters teleporting everyone when anyone but the multiplayer host uses them and rooms (as a concept refusing to cooperate.)

Which brings me to the game’s largest problem. Scale. In the beginning of the game, some items may require a few or a dozen ingots to manufacture. As you continue you might run into some stuff needing maybe upwards of 50 ingots. Then you get to end game and suddenly everything and their dog costs THOUSANDS of ingots. Simple upgrades to your lifts to double the capacity? That will be about 1,500 ingots please. Want to beat the base game? You need to build a giant device of over 1000 blocks and charge it with one-hundred million power and your strongest power generating option up until that point gives only 1,800PPS (you can build in multiples to attach).

So why did I play it so much? I dunno. Maybe the desire to actually achieve something with the money I spent on the game? With that recommendation, don’t.",1548525066,1548525066,False,20,1,0.584262371063232422,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Most notable issues currently are
 - you only start with 1 smelter, can't make more until much later, and have no good way to filter or alternate ores so you can't set up continuous production until way later on.  Just conveyor ore to your base, drop it on a box, and have to hand load the smelter boxes
 - Factorio was careful to make sure that all materials to make the starting equipment (mining, smelting, generating power, transmitting power, making conveyors and storage) are all locatable from your starting location.  Where in FortressCraft you're missing iron which is essential to transmit power, and make storage contaners.  And it's almost never locatable from your starting position (found at depth -65, location is pure rng) which is very confusing to starting players.
- It feels like the grappling hook and drop damage were heavily modified to skirt around actually desiging the map generator to make sense.  Lots of islands randomly floating with nothing on them, and massive canyons over 50 yards deep with likewise nothing.
- Scanner range is either too small, or spawning probability is too small and seems massively off. (related to the missing iron issue)

Of my first 3 hours, about 2 of them were spent just scouting the world looking for iron.  Finally found some but it's in an akward spot and it spawned me without enough power transmitters.  spawned with 6 but need 12.  The math here is pretty simple, typically need 3 for each ore miner [one each for x, y, z relative to your base] and have 4 basic resources to make more (coal, tin, copper, iron).  4*3=12.  But you start with 5 in your inventory and 1 in the field.

I've played it from the beginning and found the game always a bit of a grind. I don't mind grinding when the reward is worth it and I couldn't never tell with this game, since it was in development so long. 
When it was released and with the DLC my first big issue appeared. It was around the claim of how it offered such a deep depth to explore in the game but locked it behind a payed DLC. Never bought the dlc and put the game a side for a year.
That was just before the rail gun was added  as the group of friends had pretty much done everything  upto the DLC frozen depth, non of us saw the value in playing for what should have been included in the base game. Plus the reviews reported the grind just got worse.
We all just decided to give the game a go again to find out what was changed by DjArcas's team but only lasted 2 days.

Found the grind to be WORSE, net code still has issues (worst was being hacked by another player to give himself admin permissions and then corupting the game experiance). Saddly FortressCraft  gets a big thumb down vote  and the experiance has left a bad taste that I won't touch anothe game by ProjectorGames or Digital tribes for the final game state.

I managed to catch one of the Youtube streams during which the devloper was working on adding rooms I believe. I brought up a bug about minecarts that would be injected sideways into the air because every block you place is oriented based on the surface of whatever voxel cube you were looking at. Meaning that if you were playing the game for 6 hours, a little tired, and dont notice that your minecart loader is attached to the track like spiderman rather than sitting on the ground it would inject the 100's of minecarts into the air and they'd sit there for all eternity complete with minecart sounds. 
As I brought it up DJ said to just put the injector down correctly and it wouldn't be a problem. Yeah no kidding but sh*t happens and it is or was a bug idk if he ever fixed it and I don't care. After this he went on about how he is a poor me solo indie devloper making free updates to a fully released game (in an alpha state) and went on wingeing about how he could look into the code and how it would take a lot of time. I then pointed out that he already fixed this object orientation issue with the BFL (big freaking lazer) but that was because people were using it to bore downwards which somehow hurts the ""natural progression"" of the game. 
At the time and before this conversation I was a massive fan of FCE and loved playing it, but after actually getting to have a conversation with the devloper and experiencing first hand what an enormous and sensitive TWAT he had about his broken little Minecraft clone.

We have had to install and deal with the bullshit of Logmein Hamachi as a 3rd party VPN program to play coop. I understand it is not required anymore but it requires a bit of firewall setup and other shit and I've been there and done that for all of us as the ""tech"" guy and it worked then stopped working again, so I've reverted back to Hamachi. I hate Hamachi but it works - sorta. 

Anyways, I have spent (as of this review) 981 hours in this game. 2nd only to my top favorite, Space Engineers which is over 2000 hours. I did give this game a thumbs down for now and it was a very hard decision as I have really enjoyed it and it deserves a thumbs up for all the hard work DJ did and the countless hours I've put into the game. I want to make it clear that I will defend DJ as a great game dev to the bitter end. He is one of the best indie game devs I've had the pleasure of spending money on, several times including patreon even when I lost my job and couldn't afford even $10 a month.

With all that said, the reason i can't recommend it is simple. DJ can't control that the game didn't make the sales he needed to continue development. I know he had many more plans to further the game even more. No one can help that he nearly lost his life in a triple digit speeds motorcycle accident and miraculously surivived and even more amazingly had recovered fully. Thank the good Lord above for that. The hospital bills must be unimaginable. No one can help that more people didn't buy the game and make it even more popular. I wish DJ didn't have to give up on FC at this stage but to me that is what it feels like, giving up. DJ works with a very small team to do what he does and accomplishes amazing things with limited resources. I am truely impressed with DJ. What hurts for me is that the game is not complete and now never will be.

Beyond the fans control, DJ's control, or anything else... the game is finished on development because it didn't provide enough income to support further completion so I can't be upset at anyone for that. Understand, I have bought an early access game (at the time of purchase)  with the understanding that there is a chance it may never be completed. This isn't my first rodeo and I do get that. That doesn't change that the game did not meet my increasingly higher expectations it was giving me by the amazing dev team's progress. They fell short due to means outside anyone's control and that ended the path the game was taking.

The first level is the surface attacks which are very ""tower defense"" style and alot of fun. With the expansion of the Frozen Factory came a second ""level"" if you will, where you move down to the Cold Cavern and defend against a terrifying Cyro-Plasm based enemy that can't be killed with conventional weapons. Then the Adventurer's Pack added more end game tech that is fun to play with.

Unfortunately, that is where it ends. Development never got around to the Toxic Caverns or the Hot Caverns... nor did it touch the lowest cavern with the super hard ore, uranium ore, etc. Yes yes there are mods that use a bit of it but they are community mods and not dev born additions. DJ had a great imagination and could've / would've done so many amazing things with the rest of the game had it not fallen short for him. My family and I have supported the game for years and believed in it for so long and put up with Hamachi's trash to play it together for so long and in the end it feels like we were just abandoned even if it was not by choice. It just really sucks to know I will never see my clients on map shooting or throwing glow sticks or what could've been with the deeper caverns with how amazing the Frozen Factory was and how it alone changed the game. Now it feels like the game is finally dying and I don't want to say goodbye to one of my long time loves.

I'm sure this review will piss off some of the more die hard fans that will defend it to the death and I don't resent anyone for that. I really feel more half and half on the thumbs up / down thing but that isn't an option. I have got my money's worth for sure and it was not a waste of time or money on that note. It is a unique and awesome game that is worth every penny and on that note I would recommend it all day long. But it has been abandoned for good reasons and on that note is unfinished and never will be and that is where this review gets it's emotion from, just disappointment on what it could've / should've been but never will be.

I am not done playing by any means but I can't help but to feel a little pissed off and sad about how it turned up in the end. So much potential that will never be realised. Sorry for the long winded review but it is from the heart with no ill feelings to the game or the awesome game devs. Idk if the sales it did make will prompt a FC:E 2 but I would buy it and every DLC all over again for me and all my game mates to continue supporting DJ. He's amazing. One of the few game devs that are active in the community and responds to fans regardless of if it is positive or not. He is one of the very few that actually LISTENS to his fans and implements there opinions or requests. I send a ton of love towards DJ and anyone who helps him.

Goodnight all

P.S. I enabled comments for anyone who has it in their hearts to add to what I said or politely disagree. I hated to give a thumbs down but i felt compelled to emotionally. All I ask is don't crucify me for it.


*Update*
As I stated in the original post, I was 50 / 50 about thumbs down. I wanted to hear from the community and enabled comments for that reason and everyone has made very valid points against my thumbs down vote originally. FC is a lot of fun and always has been. DJ is one of the best indie devs I've bought from and would support future titles in a heartbeat. Is FC perfect? No. However it is pretty affordable and really what is 1,000 hours of gameplay worth anyways? I never desputed that I got my money's worth but I would still like to see the tooltips and multiplay sync finished and improved and I'd really be fine with the state it is in. I feel the game is 95% done and those are minor complaints compared to the rest of the game.

I am not a game dev nor do I understand how hard, time consuming, irritating, or expensive it is to run a small game company or develop games so on that note, I can not understand what it would've taken to finish FC fully (in my mind at least). I know DJ didn't want to make that decision and had no choice but to move on. He really cares about FC and what it could be and I know he had much more he wanted to do with it but was unable beyond his control. Maybe a couple more patches would've prevented this review being on the fence at all but ultimately FC is worth the money and time I've put into it. Coop / hosting a map personally is a bit more complicated than I would've liked as many games do the setup for you and it has lead to additional time spent fixing firewall crap and other things that have popped up over the years but I have enjoyed my time with FC:E.

Rumor has it there is a predecessor coming out someday and I highly look forward to checking it out. DJ did do a great job on FC and I have no doubt that the next FC will be awesome.

Всё плохо.

Начало довольно неплохое, поиск Т1 руды, способ доставки и ее переработка не вызывают трудностей, но чем дальше в лес тем больше и острее будут вонзаться проблемы, которые попросту невозможно решить никаким образом, а именно начнутся дикие проблемы с производством энергии. Угольные генераторы будут основным источником 90% времени! Изучение вроде бы профильных открытий не даст вам новые способы выработки, которые бы были лучше углежогов. Конечно уже пройдя 80% всех исследований будут солнечные панели, которые не являются конкурентоспособными и только потом таки турбины. Ладно, дошли до турбин. Второй дисбалансный аспект - передача этой самой энергии. Лазерные передатчики работают только в 1 точку (что логично) и для увеличенной скорости передачи им нужны линзы (действительно, почему не всунуть еще один гринд материалов), другие способы передачи энергии на расстояние отсутствуют (в лейте есть беспроводный передатчик с минимальными показателями и с такими же возможностями его применения, а в эндгейме один упоротый способ, но лучше не надо давить на больное). Силовые кубы, созданные для хранения энергии тоже могут передавать энергию, но их скорость отвратительная и должны стоять вплотную к машинам. Под конец игры возведя оружие против разума улья (эдакие боссы местной враждебной фауны, от которых прут волны вражин на вашу базу) нужно овермного энергии и проблема передачи в него этого количества энергии становится просто адски болезненной. От цветового лазерного шоу можно глаза выжечь (пропускная способность лазеров даже с линзами неадекватно мала по сравнению с требуемым количеством). Также встает вопрос о приоритетах передачи энергии между кубами хранения двух разных типов в сетапе ""т1-т2-лазер"" - один может быть заряжен на 99%, а второй вообще на нуле, пропуская абсолютно весь поток энергии сразу на лазер. 
Ах да, научные исследования жрут тьму энергии, что на старте просто неприемлемо, учитывая что основным источником энергии на первые пару часов будет ваша база. 

Еще один аспект - отсутствие сортировки. Да, вы можете на грузовом лифте из глубочайшей шахты привезти 3-4 вида руд, но сортировать то как? Думаете тут будут логистические конвейры? Нет. А может манипуляторы, как в факторио? Есть, но матерь божья, какие же они медленные! Вручную быстрее отсортируешь, чем манипулятор перевернет 1 единицу руды с одной линии на другую. Может как нибудь еще? А никак. Запихиваете абсолютно все в массовое хранилище и дело сделано, попутно выстраивая просто колоссальное по занимаемой площади производство тупо вокруг хранилищ. Хотите как то увидеть что внутри всех этих хранилищ собралось? Неа, не получится товарищ. Просто от-вра-ти-тель-но.

Крафт и рецепты не вызывали отторжений и ладно, допустимо. Исследования по типу ""увидел - отсканировал - новый вариант исследований"" не новшество конечно, но вполне гармонирует. А вот окружающий мир... Он пуст. Живности, кроме разума улья и червяков (которые появляются исключительно на ""порченой"" земле) плюющих кислотой вы не встретите, пейзажи серые и унылые что на поверхности, что тем более под землей. Все враги будут генерироваться только в момент нападения на вашу базу и тупо лететь на маяк. Из плюсов можно отметить механику 2 видов ""эвент"" мобов - один вид спаунится на конвейрах и жрет вашу руду, второй будет присасываться к кубам энергии, неприятностей доставляют достаточно.

Разное:
Персональное оружие - как с зубочисткой против мамонта.
Некоторые машины/приспособления просто бесполезны.
В мультиплеере есть нюанс - лифты и некоторое другое у каждого игрока ""свои"".

The game really lacks some polish, despite being realeased for years. It looks like the devs have nearly finished with it now, so this is not going to improve. In my view, the devs have fallen into the trap of wanting to keep adding more stuff, rather than making all the existing stuff work well together.

The tutorial is almost non-existent - it doesn't show you even 1% of the basics. So unless you think you know exactly how this game will work, you will probably spend a long period of time in a frustrated state trying to figure out how to play (like me). There seem to be quite a lot of bugs/glitchy behaviour. Nothing major, but it just adds to the frustration. e.g. The notifications were clipped off the edge of the screen, one of the messages was missing so I got error text instead, and the help text overflowed outside its text box.

I also find the controls quite confusing, and (this is probably just me), but find it really fiddly moving around the map to get to resources, place belts, etc.  Probably personal taste, but I just don't think first-person 3d is the right design for this sort of game (yeah, I know, it worked for minecraft...)

The game seems like it is probably cool once you get into it. But I've spent quite a bit of time on it (the hours I've logged don't include the time I've spent watching youtube videos and reading wiki pages), and have had enough. I probably would've refunded it if I hadn't got it for so cheap. If you're prepared to get through the overly long frustrating phase, you might enjoy it.

Taking heavy inspiration from and love letter to many of the factory mods for Minecraft with tower defence attached to keep things interesting. 

Getting past the surface layer of the game however is where the faults show. The pacing of the early game and factory set up feels like wading though treacle and is an absolute slog of grind. However, once everything is up and running, it is a joy to watch everything ticking along.

Dealing with critters that cling to your lines and eat your produce is wonderfully engaging, add that to the ever creeping threat of aliens that they feed that not only spread and grow, converting nearby blocks into their own mass, their growth cannot be pushed back by your own tools on hand and need to be pushed back with specialised machinery that need to be placed and powered in world make for an enjoyable challenge.

The tower defence however is possibly the weakest aspect of the game with only the most basic implementation. I can sympathise with what at the time was no doubt a difficult task of trying to implement path finding over distances on voxel maps, the end result leaves it feeling as more of a nuance to interact with.

Not only the ability to redirect the attacks completely unavailable as all attackers simply fly over everything (no doubt as a solution to the above mentioned pathing difficulties), your push back against them is limited to a simple tier line of turrets that just do progressively more damage

Getting said turrets up before the 1st wave is likely to start heading your way is a challenge due to the before mentioned slog of getting your factory going and if your fail... well... either nothing happens, or you loose everything depending on the settings you have. The whole TD gameplay makes it feel as though this pat of the game is more a gimmick added to give it something more or the dev was unable to find the right way to mesh it with the rest of their game.

There is a good game here, of that I am 100% certain. However the balance either feels off, of the way it is meant to be played eludes me. and I do not regret picking this title up and I am looking forward to the next iteration that is apparently in the works.

The attempt at merging the genres together is novel. However I would recommend other games that have their focus on either the factory management OR the tower defence rather than the one that tries to do both, though if it is on sale, not a bad choice if your wanting something a little more experimental from an indi dev",1545584322,1688277402,False,11,0,0.462760686874389648,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But don't let that decide if you buy quite yet.
The base game alone can be, even when knowing the gameplay loop and having a favorable seed, a day of active gameplay before you could feasibly finish the objectives laid out before you. With Frozen Factory and Adventures, you can double, even triple that time very easily for your save file. This is not a small adventure, it will be time consuming and very rewarding to those willing to tackle the problems with a bit of logic and reasoning.

So what exactly is this game? You are the survivor of an incident, a ship you were aboard was only just about to dock into a station when a stray comet struck, clipping your vessel, destroying the station, and sending you down to the surface of an untamed planet below. With an Central Power Hub that links all of your technology together (and serves as your core in defense sections of gameplay), you progress from having the most basic technology you salvaged to building an ion cannon network and destroying the four segments of the hivemind that have been growing increasingly hostile towards your presence as you have begun developing on this planet. You achieve this with mining, automating resources for bulk processing, generating, buffering, and transferring electricity across the world, and defending yourself from hordes of oversized insects.
The defense sections of gameplay consist of guarding against the four diagonals of your Core, where the four hive minds are located on every world. They send progressively larger waves of enemies based on your threat which is assessed on power and ingot production primarily, so you can artificially reduce difficulty by going slower. Turrets will be one of your largest consumers of electricity as the game goes on,  with basic defenses being laser turrets and more advanced options being missiles you construct from raw materials up and launch from yet still powered turrets for massive damage against equally massive and dangerous targets. Mastering your defense is critical, as you will have to complete four exceptionally grueling gauntlets from all sides while charging the Ion Cannon to complete the base game's objective and destroy the hive mind. Failure, without optional changes, will only drain your power from buffers and knock out lights from all sources, including torches, while the Core reboots. 
The game is fairly deep and fun, and a good first for someone who wants to get into something of a management sim. The objectives are clear, there is a fairly complete built-in helper by way of your companion bot Arthur, and in general the game has a low skill floor.",1545367628,1704463759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This game is still great if you have the patience to work around the not-so-great features. It's got a lot of bugs so the quality has gone down a bit, and it's not optimised very well either, so playing multiplayer is a hassle unless it's done through a very stable LAN connection. I'd probably only recommend this game if you've got friends to play with and mods to play with, otherwise it's not super great.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Excellent community; within 30 minutes I received a response to my questions
[*]Basic learning curve that once you learn things you can progress exponentially faster [Typically how I like my games: If I have to restart, I'd like to restart and get to where I was last time quickly]
[*]Logistical nightmares for sorting [But hey I like those kinds of games; you should see how much I've played Factorio]
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Multiplayer is somewhat annoying to set up; but if you have Hamachi the problem is mitigated
[*]Creative mode seems a little broken HUD-wise, and somewhat interaction wise...
[*]I can use the Frozen Factory machines on a non Frozen Factory creative world..?
[*][strike]The game has been abandoned, with a bit of forewarning from the developers. It's sad that this game won't get any more updates, but to be honest the dev did the right thing.[/strike] Scratch that, I noticed an update last year on December. And there is very much an active Discord. So I'm wrong on that part. Good job!

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
I liked it, and I totally recommend this for anyone who has spare time to kill and loves Minecraft yet can't get mods to work properly, or simply don't have time to install official packs. After all this game DOES have quite a bit of content, and there's even the Steam Workshop.

EDIT: Just snagged the Frozen Factory expansion pack due to it going on sale. Get the game now while it's 75% off!

in short: the game is recommended.

i first got hip to it after posting during a steam sale asking for games that had an incredible ""gameplay time"" to ""dollars spent"" ratio, and this was recommended. it lived up to that promise spectacularly. it actually blew me away, never having played any kind of block or factory game before and i was at 400 hrs before i knew it. now i'm over 1.5k. although in any case probably only 1/2 those hours are real as i let the game idle for days while i'm afk, or while i sleep so my world can get owned and i can wake up to an interesting next day, etc. ;P

it's not for everyone.

but if you think you like ""this kind of game"" -- factory games, I guess -- you should check it out.

it's not overtly a logic game, but if u are a logical person u will probably like it. 

7 friends own this game. 1 has >100 hrs. the rest have under 5, and one is zero. which, combined w/ my personal experience in the game tells me that if u don't make it over that ""hump"" to the misc. big ""a-ha"" moments of this game, it's probably just going to leave u confused and not really wanting to play again. and some ppl are probably going to get to that a-ha moment and go ""wtf? i still hate this game anyway."" it's not for everyone. (which btw is ""everyone""'s fault, not the game's fault.)

it does have some rough edges. it was done by a small team, mainly one dev, and as such there is definitely a certain level of ""polish"" that many games have that u won't find here, but it's actually incredibly impressive for a small team nonetheless. in the end, it does what it's supposed to do: give me hundreds of hours of amusement.

it does requires some imagination as well as an interest in the particular gameplay style, which is actually far more about building your factories to achieve mass automation of production and achieve meta-game goals, vs. outright conflict w/ mobs. at a point killing the mobs is token. they're just another source of certain mats for your factory. the survival aspects are also pretty token although u can turn up the ""coreness"" on both fronts in misc. ways. but most of those just sound frustrating and unfun to me. and i've dabbled w/ them a bit, to confirm. there's also misc. other mutators, some of which i've tried. most feel kinda bolted-on, i.e. unbalanced, or ironically, not mutated enough. the core game is fine though. i wouldn't totally discount the mutators, but don't count on them either.

overall i'd call it slow paced.

in terms of progression, .. it's as fast as u want to go/are able to go, but the first time thru the tech tree you're going to be spending a lot of time figuring stuff out. it's a game about figuring stuff out. :) if you're seriously cool with that and u can handle this game on its own terms then u will probably like it. if u need to be methodically shown [i]everything[/i] then u are probably going to have a rough time.

but afa the actual conflict w/ mobs etc., again, it's pretty abstract. and u as a player are passive; your turrets do all the killing. (w/ a few rare insignificant exceptions). reflexes are not a requirement. the only fast-action stuff u might be doing relates to mobility; u will probably learn a few tricks to navigating the world but that's about it.

it does have a separate creative mode for building artistic creations btw. i have not used it as that's not my thing but i have seen shots of some amazing things. it also lets you actually design your own blocks by building them on a large scale with other blocks and then snapshotting that whole area to tell the game ""make this a block"". very cool! the survival mode of the game does not support this although there is a mod, a work in progress, which I have not tried, which somehow allows it, partially at least.

speaking of mods ... i started in vanilla, and because of that ""rough around the edges"" tag, i did quickly find some misc. QoL issues w/ this game and started looking at mods. (tbh tho once i moved beyond that ""i want to make the game more comfy for me"" and just started to appreciate it for what it was, i see that some of the things i thought were of consequence when i was a newb (yes, even in terms of QoL), are actually not. u live and learn.)

but anyway, there are many cool and varied mods available, and the mod community is still active (as is the discord, including the dev)

there are mods that are minor, there are mods that add some amazing misc. tools and capabilities that are not in the base game, and there are mods that are literally cheating. i'm not usually a ""you have to get the mods"" person and actually that typically turns me off when hearing about a new game -- mainly because I find modders, community devs, etc., strongly lacking in the area of reasonable balance and sometimes just overall quality -- but in this case i am using about 25 mods right now, and probably about 5 of those are core that i just could not live without at this point (mainly QoL related, one of which I designed); a few are definite nice-to-haves and the rest are just gratuitous or ""that sounds cool"", and many of which i have installed but have literally not even built/used in the game yet. just saying: there's a robust and active mod library. but there are still many possibilities to explore and i say that both in terms of things u could conceive, and in the sense that the game itself appears relatively friendly to modding because it's in unity(?) and u can use the harmony plugin.

multiplayer, i have only dabbled in, but if u have a committed scene of ppl, i could see it being cool. especially w/ experienced players where ppl kinda know what they're doing and u can compare advanced ideas etc.

this also reminds me though that on the ""con"" side, the game has several achievements which cannot be legitimately earned. so if that's important to you, now you know.

more to say about misc. aspects but i've covered a lot and left u a lot to find out for yourself. the previous review my tone was more critical for misc. valid reasons but at this point i'm enjoying the game, and having knocked out most of the major goals and i'm basically feeling close to having mastered it and probably getting ready to move on. it was a good experience and i wanted that known.

Механника, крафт, автоматизация и прочее - все очень захватывающе и интересно, ""Майн ради крафта и крафт ради майна"" - все как я люблю.

Плюсов много, пересислять долго, так что о минусах подробнее:

1. Вышеупомянутое отсутствие локализации. Ее присутствие заставило бы меня взять игру даже без скидки (а так купил ее лишь из-за выгодной цены) 
[upd] на данный момент локализация много лучше чем ранее, процент перевода и его качество гораздо лучше и вполне хватает для играбельности! Так что минус пункт =)

2. Не уверен, часто ли встречается эта проблема, ответа я так и не нашел - я не могу использовать оружие. То, что якобы достается на клавишу V. Вот никак. Возможно оно доступно только в каком-то DLC, но ответа я так и не нашел - опять же все на английском, с коим у меня все плохо. 
[upd] с пушкой разобрался сам. плюс добрый человек maikl.olsen написал об этом: пушку надо сначала скрафтить, а уж потом стрелять с нее. Логично=)

3. Присутствие красящей блоки пушки, которой можно пользоваться только при покупки DLC. нафиг она в обычной версии, если я не могу ей воспользоваться? Попытка заставить меня приобрести DLC? Эффект обратный, как по мне. при наличии проблем с вышеупомянутым оружием - вдвойне обратный. 
[upd] как оказалось все работает, просто не все блоки могуть быть перекрашены=)

4. ЛОКАЛИЗАЦИЯ! 
[upd] да да, см выше =)

5. Яркость. многие элементы игры просто выжигают глаза своей яркостью и ядовитостью цветов. Надо бы больше света и более мягкие тона. Серьезно, глаза прям устают, последний раз так было... да даже не помню когда. Возможно решило бы проблему поднятие качества с минималки хотябы до среднего, но увы, мой динозавр тянет 30фпс лишь на минималках.

Si lo hubiese valorado este verano, o el anterior, habría dicho que el juego me encanta por su complejidad y lo bien hecho que esta, pero hoy precisamente, el día que tengo que jugar a un juego nominado por mi, me encuentro con un problema que es la segunda vez que me afecta. Y es un mundo corrupto. 

Desconozco porque, siempre lo cierro de forma correcta, me espero incluso a que termine de cerrar los archivos no esenciales y que el juego indica que no pasa nada si lo cerrase en ese momento y en fin soy cuidadoso. 

Pero si cuando entras en esa partida que llevas jugando 3 o 4 meses, el mundo esta cortado con una pared invisible, y si al explorar un poco descubres que ya no puedes volver por el camino que has seguido porque el juego se ha borrado detrás tuyo. Se te quitan las ganas de volver a jugar, porque no sabes si por haberse actualizado o por que si, has perdido tu partida para siempre, la primera vez paso sin mas, cerrar y abrir el juego a los 10 minutos.
y si me dijeseis ´y que mas da, pues empieza otra.´, os respondería, ¿para que, para que se estropee cuando me he cargado 3 de 4 jefes o peor aun en la zona helada de abajo, en donde no he tenido ocasión de explorar y disfrutar de la expansión helada ...?
Esto solo me ha pasado en windows, en ubuntu no tuve ningún problema en 1 año, de hecho lo primero que hice al meter windows 10 fue comprar todos los DLCs, ¿ es eso lo que va mal ?, quizás, pero ya no vuelvo a jugar.

Edito, 26 de noviembre 2020. Ya me había olvidado de porque deje de jugar y un amigo me animó. En tres meses seguidos no ha habido problemas graves, quizás porque ha dejado de actualizar. Pero aunque se volvió a reproducir el fallo de los cubos invisibles, se corrigió solo al cerrar y abrir el juego. han habido algunos cambios en incremento del coste de las cosas que no me ha gustado, pero bueno, es aceptable.

Los 4 jefes me los he cepillado con mucha comodidad, porque aunque nos han quitado los tranquilizantes de bichos y ahora te machacan, al final te acostumbras y pasas de ellos.

There are many parts of this game which are very frustrating. For example, I regularly found myself unable to use the crafting menu, as it would simply stop displaying any items at all until I figured out how to manually reset it by typing in the search bar, then deleting what I had typed. Another example is that you start out with hoppers (chests) that only hold two items. TWO. It took me several hours of play, much of which was not fun, before I managed to acquire iron, which apparently you need in order to build a chest that can hold much of anything. That made setting up my intial assembly lines quite annoying, as I never had enough hoppers, and couldn't build more. Automating iron production is quite tough, as iron only appears at significant depth, and for the first few hours of the game, you simply won't have the materials to automate that far down yet.

The other thing that annoys me about this game is its DLC pratices. When starting the game for the first time, several times more space is devoted to the 'get DLC' buttons as the 'new game' button. Then, after starting a game, it always shows you all the DLC recipies in all the crafting menus, even though it knows you don't have the DLC. Heavy handed much? I get that you're trying to sell DLC, but when someone has just bought your game, and is still trying to play their first game, that is NOT the time to upsell them to all your DLC every place they look. They've already paid for the game. Let them enjoy the game for at least five minutes before you shove huge ads for DLC in their face.

Exploration in this game looks good in screenshots (there really are some big caverns, and pretty visuals) but the actual gameplay of exploration is not so great. It takes you several in-game hours to even craft any kind of weapon, which means for the most part you're walking around, surrounded by little blob monsters, who you can't touch. Then you go back to your base only to find out that no, nothing you found was useful, so you have to try again. And again. And again. Teching up seems to be more of a process of trial and error more than anything else. You can ping to search for ore, but it takes many, many pings to try to find the ore you actually need. 90% of the ore you find won't be the one you're loking for.

This game does have nice features. Moving power in a straight line with lasers, for example, is really nice and avoids having to tediously lay wires. Having a built-in flashlight and grappling hook are again great. Automation from the start is a big improvement over manually mining rocks with a pickaxe for ages.

Thing is, the innovations that this game offers ultimately cannot save it. Every time I boot the game up, it bugs me to buy DLC. Once I've loaded in, I realize that there's yet another ore I need to find, but I don't know where it is, not even a direction beyond 'down, somewhere', and my tools won't help me find it because its 'unknown'. So I think about spending ages pinging different ore clusters, tunneling to them and then realizing that they aren't the right type... before remembering that I could just play factorio, or minecraft, instead and probably enjoy myself more.

I'm not sure what it is about this game. It has nice graphics and some innovative mechanics. It just... isn't fun to play. You almost never look at what you've built and think ""awesome, I'm proud of that"". You almost never look at your base and think ""perfect"". There's always something on your screen nagging you to do some task which you have no idea how to do. There's always some element of the interface, or your task list, which you know you'll have to come back to five times because you can't remember the steps required to do it. There's always some other ore you need to find, goodness knows where, probably at the bottom of a cavern somewhere.

My advice: buy factorio instead. It isn't 3D, but it is much more fun. If you absolutely have to play in 3D, then Minecraft with mods is better than this.",1542952964,1542952964,False,18,2,0.599024951457977295,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you don't mind not getting achievements, there is a pretty good selection of mods that work around some bugs, but you will never get all the achievements because there is one that was never coded into the game for Steam to recognize it was achieved. 

I used to recommend the game because it was fun if you enjoyed factory type games with little guidance, inconsistent help/information, and didn't mind watching hours of outdated you-tube videos on how things worked and then spending the same amount of time figuring out watch changed (because what they did and what you can do are two different things). 

But the nail in the coffin is that the author released a final patch/dlc that added a who bunch of new stuff/changes, and then ran. The new content broke old content, added new useless/buggy stuff, and the author ignores the problems and the userbase. He has moved on to his other projects on steam and beyond.

It’s just a really satisfying building game. Like you start the game with a few ore extractors and batteries, and you turn that into this huge network of conveyor belts and power generators and factories cranking out components to make even more factories. It’s just this beautiful engine-building experience.

Okay, so I've gushed about the game, but I just want to summarize what you do exactly, because there’s a good chance you haven’t played anything quite like it (it is very different from minecraft). So I’ve mentioned you start out with a few ore extractors and batteries. From there you locate some ore using the scanning tools provided to you. You plop an ore extractor onto the ore, you set up a conveyor belt so it brings the ore to the surface to be smelted, and then you set up some power lines to keep the whole system running. There you have it, that little assembly line will just crank out metal bars for you until that vein runs out, and it won’t run out for a long time. And then you start looking for different kinds of ore, and you set up assembly lines for them too. You also set up factories that can refine the material you mine. But soon you have to dig deeper, and you have to set up turrets to defend your assembly lines, you’ll need to set up lifts collect the really deep ore. And with each new ore you collect you unlock new tools to make your operation more efficient. Make tools that dig vertical shafts for you, make machines to sort the massive quantity of ore you’re producing, make missile launchers to shoot bugs out of the sky, make machines that grind up all the useless rock you end up with, make vaults to store all the stuff you mine, make teleporters so you can visit all the mini-factories you built underground.

Now there is another gameplay element I want to bring up: game speed. Like, this is a slow game. Your first playthrough is going to take you 30+ hours, and that’s on easy mode (trust me, your first playthrough should be on easy mode). Even with all the tools you unlock, building your all these factories takes time. Personally, I still enjoyed it. I felt really clever setting up machines that could do work on their own, and I found the whole planning and organizing aspect to be very satisfying, almost like I was growing a garden. That said, I understand a slow planning/engineering simulator may not be to everyone’s liking.

Another thing I should bring up is the learning curve. The game comes with a handy little handbook that you WILL need to consult every once in a while. You may also need to google some things. Again, I personally didn’t find this to be a huge negative. There are a lot of machines and materials in this game, but you encounter them gradually as you play so you shouldn’t be too overwhelmed by it all.

Honestly, if the game seems interesting I encourage you to check out some Let’s Plays on youtube. The trailers and screenshots show the cool stuff you can build, but a Let’s Play will give you a sense of the game’s pacing and it’ll show you what you have to do to build this cool stuff, and building is the meat of the game.",1542833881,1542833881,True,3,0,0.501295685768127441,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yep, it doesn't have the polish that a big budget game has, but that's part of the charm. The game itself works well, and I've encountered zero actual game breaking bugs - most of the annoyances are things like the right click to remove, which took me a while to unlearn from my time playing minecraft (""I'll just open this thing..."" -muscle memory right clicks- ""whoops it's instantly gone"", and some way to peer over a crevasse or mineshaft without falling down it, like Minecraft's hold shift to crouch.

I also haven't found the learning curve to be too steep.

I had quite a lot of fun but the game seemed extremely buggy. I thought to myself, alright, the game just got out of early access and there seems to be lot of development ongoing. I will wait a while and hopefully this will turn into a fun game to play with friends.

I just returned to game hopeful that after few DLC and lots of development everything would be much better. Sadly it seems that while there is now more content, getting started has actually gotten worse. I think the game used to be more intuitive and far more forgiving in the beginning. The help and tutorial system is just bad and sometimes almost dangerous. 

For example the tutorials seem to indicate that it would be good idea to mine some of the first materials by hand. However if you actually do that, a single ""Super Dig"" that is needed for the ores drains your beginner gear batteries fully and leaves you freezing to death. 

Mob balance also seems to be way off for someone just starting. You do not get a gun in the beginning anymore (which is quite confusing itself). I was just barely able build a single turret for the first mob attack and I did remember lots of things from playing earlier. However that turret did not actually kill anything and core was destroyed. While the game does not end it leaves you fairly frustrated.

As though that wasn't enough, immediately afterwards a huge worm spawned right next to the base, pretty much preventing me from using my base at all. Maybe I should have done something to prevent that, but that certainly wasn't in the tutorials. This basically ended my newest game. 

For me it seems like in two years the game has turned into something even less balanced and more confusing than it was before. As it is, there aren't many friends I can recommend this to.

While the issues that could use polish seems very long, here is few suggestions to improve the start for newbies:
-No worm spawns until lot later in game, especially next to the core. Even then make it clear to players how to prevent them without Googling.
-Start with gun or lower the build requirements to copper and tin so that every newbie can build it before first attack. Attacks without tools to even try to defend yourself just leads to frustration.
-Rebalance the turrets and mobs. You should feel proud for building a fun powerful new item that then gets slowly gets overpowered by mobs later in the game. Not build a turret and immediately feel disappointed in the result.
-Show different tools and the keys for them as part of the toolbar / visible interface. Easy enough to make it an option that can be turned off later when user is more familiar with them.
-Things like buildable ore pings seem to add unnecessary complexity and steps to a core part of a game without really adding anything positive to the experience. Just one more thing to craft. Sometimes less is more even in complex crafting game. Simply allowing pinging specific known ores from scanner would be a major QoL improvement and once again make things less confusing for new players.",1539977519,1539977519,False,11,0,0.59279865026473999,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While the game feels like it could do with a few hundred hours of polish, the core gameplay is solid. It's also updated regularly with improvements, and of course the mods just make the game even better.

A few tips: I like games with scarcity which kick my arse, and FCE already does that on plentiful mode. Also, because it's not immediately obvious: you can place conveyors on walls and ceilings and they work just fine.

If you want a logistics game that will pull you in, and aren't afraid of a Dwarf Fortress-esque learning curve, then FCE is a steal at the current price. I imagine it would be even better with friends!

The ""survival"" part is less critical, as it essentially slows you down, but doesn't really prevent you from playing on, which - to my taste - works to the advantage of the game. The game clearly focuses on building up, improving, getting bigger, building more etc. 
While often compared as ""Factorio in 3D"" I think it offers quite a different playing experience, as navigating the world during building and rebuilding gives a unique viewpoint. But it is true, that people enjoying Factorio most likely are the same kind of people enjoying FortressCraft Evovled. (I enjoy both.) 

To get the most out of the game, you should have a decent ""modern"" gaming PC, though. I'm a bit left behind with only a i7 DualCore laptop and a (nowadays) mediocre graphics card. In fact, the card doesn't even supprot proper DirectX 11 drivers, which makes me technically ""out of specs"", and I do see minor issues. Why am I telling this? Because despite this all, I can and am enjoying this game big time. 

And the best part (so far) of FC Evolved is the last part: Evolved! I've been with this game for several years now (Really? Is it that long? I guess it is...) and the dev is _still_ making this game better with each new patch, adding new things, fixing others. 

This was all a lot of pro, so where are the cons? 
I guess, the biggest ""problem"" of the game is its complexity. Don't expect an easy-ride with just a few hours invested. The game is a real time-eater, and it will take you a bit of time to get used to everything, including the - as far as I know - rather non-standard way of interface. Most of it is short-key driven, and until you've learnt your way it might feel a bit cumbersome. But once you're in the ""flow"", the interactions with the game make sense and feel good.

That is where any similarities end. But as others have already stated, if MC and Factorio had a child, it would be FCE. After nearly 40 hours, I'm still captivated by FCE. With an apparent total of 4 tiers to work through, I've currently progressed to tier2 ores and machinery until recently. There is a bit of learning curve, but its well handled by the beginning in-game tutorial and should get a new player up and running in about 10-20 minutes. Some yt vids help to. ;) 

If you like logistics, resource gathering, building type games, you'll like FCE! The game excels at taking you deep into the crafting & research rabbit hole. It does have a bit of a survival aspect in the form of random alien attacks, but you have plenty of time to learn the game and get some resources and machines up and running beforehand. There are also difficulty options to choose from. FCE requires you to explore in a vertical fashion as its different types of biomes are separated by depth rather than lateral space. I find the ambiance at different levels (ie depths) to be well done. Some of the deeper biomes actually do feel a bit creepy and many times you'll find yourself breaking through a wall only to find a pitch black cavern that goes hundreds of meters down, or one imbued with florescent pinks or greens or yellows due to the flora found there. What first attracted me to FCE were its use of colors and graphics. And for what it is, it runs well on my older GTX 680, AMD 8350, even with a multitude of machines and conveyors and ore processors and FALCORS, and wasps etc all doing their thing.

You have nothing to lose by giving FCE a try especially if you enjoyed MC and or Factorio. There are some improvements I'd like to see such as the ability to shift+click items in and out of your inventory. A more intuitive help guide as I generally resort to using the internet wiki when I have questions about the game. Having a search function in the help guide would be handy. If you've ever played modded MC before you'll probably enjoy FCEs' depth of crafting, e.g. build this to make that so you can build those to make these and eventually have it gameplay, that is until you've researched whatever it is you're trying to build by accumulating enough points from scanning and building even more assets to do the advanced research and after of course you harness the needed resources by exploring (oftentimes hundreds of meters down).

[h1]Engine[/h1]
From the technical side, this has all of the engine features I'd always wished for GT to have. Infinite world generation in all three dimensions, a modern rendering engine, proper multithreading and machines being simulated whether you are watching them or far away. There's even a room system that can be used to nullify the performance impact of complicated factory setups.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
From the gameplay side, this game offers way more depth than I've seen in similar games, literally. You'll have to explore deeper and deeper into the alien planet to discover new resources and advance the game. It's not uncommon to be mining resources a thousand meters below the surface. It used to be rather challenging to transport these resources to the surface, but fortunately many new logistics tools have been added since to simplify this task.

Crafting recipes become increasingly complex and exponentially more costly as you advance in the game. Thus, a lot of automation and factory building is needed. Patches seem to be pushing even further in that direction, so you better automate everything or it will be nearly impossible to progress. Luckily, automation is generally being made very easy, but can be infinitely optimized. There are a lot of great mods to help out with automation, in case you feel like you need more tools at your disposal. 

[h1]User Interface[/h1]
The user interface comes with a few practical tools for factory building. You can place down entire conveyor lines with a single click, turn your jetpack into hover mode to build mid-air and super-dig to quickly clear out underground pathways. If this doesn't suffice, these tools are complemented by dedicated machines like auto-builders and excavators. There's also a context-sensitive help menu in case you're wondering what a specific block/research/machine is meant for.

[h1]Graphics and Sounds[/h1]
The graphics and sound effects are ok for a voxel game. The underground atmosphere always astounds me. Whether it's a freezing cavern or a scorching lake of magma: particles, fog, UI and sound effects are effectively used to convincingly portray the atmosphere. 

When it comes to the factory though, you'll notice some questionable designs with a few graphical glitches here and there. I'd personally always turn down/mute the game volume before stepping near lifts, especially after enjoying the cave atmosphere beforehand. Supposedly the reason for lifts being so loud is that you can hear them coming from a 200 meter deep mineshaft.

By default there's a strong bloom filter running. Make sure to spread bright components like powerblocks apart or the colors will start bleeding all over the screen. Otherwise the postprocessing makes lasers look cool and generally works to enhance the sci-fi look, only lacking some anamorphic lens flares to complete the cliche.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you love exploring the underground, building a transport infrastructure and simple automation, this game is for you. It'll offer lots of content in each of these categories and can be made to be as complex as you want. Don't expect there to be much of a story or scripted gameplay. This is the kind of game where you create your own story.",1536973585,1536974708,True,5,0,0.531018853187561035,0,True,False,False,False,,,

nach über 1200 Stunden mit Buddeln, Bauen und Ballern denke ich, dass ich hier mal eine kurze Review verfasse. Wer Minecraft/Factorio und Konsorten mag und noch dazu viel Spaß daran hat Produktionsstätten zu Planen und zu Bauen ist hier Gold Richtig. Als Bonus gibst es dann noch eine gute Portion Tower Defence dazu. 

Pro`s:

- Bessere Optik als Minecraft (ohne Kosmetik Mods etc.), 3D Vorteil zu z.B. Factorio. Geschmäcker sind verschieden, ich finds hier Besser gelöst. 
- Ein rundes Paket an Dingen die man Bauen kann für Automation, Logistik, Räume, Waffen usw.
- Wühlmäuse können sich Quasi unendlich in jede Richtung Buddeln, dem Gigantischen Ameisenstock steht hier nicht im Wege… außer ggf. die eigene Lebenserwartung; aber das hat nix mit dem Spiel zu tun...
- Logistik, Logistik, Logistik … hab ich Logistik schon erwähnt? 
- Sehr interessantes System zur Basisversorgung mit Energie aus unterschiedlichen, wählbaren Quellen.
- Grappel Hook, fühl dich frei, schwing dabei :) Später gibts ein JetPack oben drauf!
- Kleine Feinde, mittlere Feinde, dicke Feinde… Overlords!!! 
- Dazu passend, kleine Waffen, mittlere Waffen, große Waffen, Missiles und Orbital Laser… Herz was willst Du mehr.
- Mods, Mods, Mods, die Comumunity produziert regelmäßig gute Mods die das Spiel um ein vielfaches Erweitern und Komplexer machen oder auf Wunsch auch Einfacher machen. Jeder wie er will.
- DJ Arcas, netter Dev der auch gerne hilft, wenn man ihm nicht auf die Nüsse geht ;)
- Dedicated Server sind Möglich! Yeeeeehaaaa!
- Umfangreicher Creative Modus zum Austoben, man muss nicht nur Survival spielen!

Man kann Sagen, hier ist Alles dabei was man so zum kreativen Buddeln, Bauen und Produzieren braucht, was das Spiel selber nicht hat, kann man über diverse Mods nachrüsten. Ein dicker fetter Pluspunkt!

Con`s:

- Das Spiel ist ein echter Ressourcen Fresser, je größer die Basis wird, desto mehr Speicher etc. braucht das Spiel… Die Systemanforderungen der Shopseite passen so (seit Patch 16 glaub ich) nicht mehr. Viel Speicher, eine schnelle HDD und ein schneller Prozessor mit mehreren Kernen sollte es schon sein. 
- Nicht alle Texte zu den Modulen/Teilen etc. sind Hilfreich, man muss schon hier und da ein bissel Kreativ sein und selber fummeln. Nicht wirklich ein Con, aber es sollte erwähnt werden/sein. 
- Knappes Tutorial

Alles in Allem, ein sehr schönes Spiel für Leute die auf Buddeln, Bauen, Logistik und Ballern (Tower Defence anyone?) stehen. Wenn das genau dein Ding ist, dann bist Du hier richtig.  Eine hilfsbereite Community ist auch Vorhanden, falls es mal irgendwo Hakt oder Klemmt.

Es sei noch Erwähnt, das Spiel wird noch aktiv weiter Entwickelt und es stehem dem geneigten Interessenten neben dem Stable Build auch Nightly Builds oder Bleeding Edge Build zur Verfügung. Ein neues, weiteres Addon/DLC ist in der Entwicklung, nennt sich Adventure Pack.

I've put a decently substantial amount of hours into playing. HOWEVER it feels like the further you get in the game, the less the design choices have any rhyme or reason to them, let alone how unfinished everything starts feeling. I get development shifted to Frozen Factory to allow for some income, the problem is the base game is just too janky to feel like I should be spending any more money on it.

The UI is sickening.

I kept having to lower my gfx finally down to lowest due to something in my factory just being a performance blackhole. 
Im pretty sure it was cargo lifts because I wasted my time putting literally everything else into rooms for absolutely no gain.

The enemies are just annoying and tedious, especially towards late game when you need to charge the OET.
Setting up towers in four diagonals is just to waste your time I think. Worms popping out of the ground and killing you instantly as you accidently fly into them is a treat. Better yet, when they die and their body not only flops onto you but even spins to kill you until their model clears. Slimes only purpose is to randomly decide to shoot a ball at you when you least expect it. etc. etc.

I feel that many of the negative reviews it gets are pretty unfair - but I understand where they are coming from. Fortresscraft has a steep learning curve and relatively slow progression compared to other games (if you exclude Korean MMO grinders lol) which can be frustrating for new players. It has quite a bunch of minor bugs, the UI could use an overhaul, the handbook could use some more work and so on and so on - but so far I never found anything really gamebreaking. Ignoring such minor issues, the game is very playable and very fun once you get used to its mechanics. And there's also a fan wiki with extensive information about those mechanics if you got trouble finding the relevant infos in the handbook. (UPDATE: Since I wrote this the handbook has seen a lot of improvements!!!)

I'm currently 600+ hours in and still far away from the endgame (though I admit that ""beating"" it is not my top priority, I spend way too much time exploring and experimenting with the machines, changing my setup to optimize it, terraforming the surface and covering it with decorative blocks because why not?). There are so many machines and things they can craft and there is so much stuff to explore and discover, phantastic. So, looking at the price of the base game and its DLCs I feel the purchase was completely worth it.  I've spent way more money on some so-called AAA titles and got much less fun and playtime back from those.

If you like voxel games and Factorio and are willing to spend hundreds or even thousands of hours to build your perfect fortress, this game is for you. I never played Minecraft, for me FCE feels like a nice crossover between Dwarf Fortress and Factorio with 3D voxel graphics.

However, if you prefer streamlined and ultra-polished AAA* games which you can beat within 20-30 hours, FortressCraft is probably not going to be your thing.

Oh, and about the dev:  he's pretty active on the forums (and also on Reddit and Discord I believe), listens to feedback, wrote more than 20 free content patches. This is awesome if you ask me and I don't understand the criticism he seems to get here. FortressCraft is not perfect and still has some issues, but when it comes to complexity and scope it's a masterpiece. So, at this low price, I can fully recommend it to anybody who likes this genre (building stuff, crafting stuff, automating stuff...).

This is a hardcore survival game which has similarities to Factorio and Satisfactory with the exploration of caverns as in MineCraft and Terraria.
Combat is here not a focus as in Terraria, it is more a measure of effectiveness as in Factorio.

The building and logistics part is not as complex as in Factorio or Satisfactorio,
but the vertical expansion of the base and the thrill of exploration make this game special and more immersive than it's competitors.

Sadly tutorial and user interface make it very hard for new players to get into the game.
The game is neither really finished or polished. Some mechanics are broken, confusing and difficult use.
The ingame feedback is often not helpful leading to frustration, when it is not clear why something does not work. There are a lot of techs which need a specific setup that is not intuitive, and until figuring out who something works can be a chore.
The in-game help system and even the wiki only make sense when one understands the mechanics through trial and error.

Even as an experienced player it is difficult for me to get back into the game after a long break.
Changing the controls makes it even more difficult (don't do it until you know the game good).
I advice to watch a youtube tutorial about the start before playing.

The game is also very grindy, suitable only for hardcore players, even when played with the lowest difficulty settings.

This game is extremely hard in the beginning and keeps beeing hard but it is also very rewarding. 
The Frozen Factory expansion is worthy addition but even more grindy than the base game,
so it's only interesting for those who mastered the base game.
Nevertheless I recommend the Frozen Factory and Adventure DLC to support the developer.
The game is worth every cent.

Pros:
+ good concept (a mix of base building, exploration, survival)
+ choose your own playstyle (sandbox, survival or a forgiving survival)
+ crafting with automation (like in Factorio)
+ survival mechanics is mainly based on energy
+ exploration is made interesting by survival mechanics
+ atmospheric music when exploring underground
+ immersive gameplay
+ stable not one crash
+ good workshop support with usefull mods

Cons:
- steep learning curve
- user interface and inventory management is too confusing for such a complex game
- searching for ore is chore
- controls can't be changed within the game (only in a splash screen before start)
- controls can't be easily reset (not even a fresh install helps)
- some clipping failures
- spiderbot not working (only sometimes visible)
- graphics, controls and user interface are not on a level with Satisfactory
- some techs (like grav lifts) are only usable when the player buys the dlc. Those techs are not necessary but this dlc policy gives the game a bad taste
- ores that have no icons and purpose",1533045223,1584830792,True,3,1,0.531707584857940674,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Its unfortunate that the UI is so difficult to work with because once you figure things out, the emergent gameplay is pretty decent. Getting a belt and power to a copper vein is a nice first accomplishment.

About the UI, when I'm looking for the relevant info that I need to figure out what I'm doing, I have to wonder aalmost every time, which corner of the screen am I going to find the relevant information? do I have to be looking at the item? do I have to press E on the item and go to a different window? do i have to read wordy text on the bottom to find out what I need to do once I look at an item? for a new person seeing this for the first time, its not obvious where I should be looking. And why are descriptions so wordy and not consistent with each other? too much time is spent deciphering information to get into the flow of the game.

The UI design doesn't seem overly conserned with design conventions from other games, and it almost comes across like the designer didn't think it would be very important to consider how a new player would learn how to play. Sure it may work in a technical sense but intuitive user focused design is not a strong area for this developer.

It can be a bit...much if your new to logistics and building, but if you remember the beginning tutorial, it will carry you the entire way. 

In the latest version there has been a new UI overhaul which I personally do enjoy, as it feels far less clunky to me then the old one. (sorry dev but its true) , as well as a decent optimization.

The game wont hold your hand, and you will be bombarded with questions... but i feel like that is a good thing.

It's that simple.

FortressCraft is pretty much a mashup of Factorio and Minecraft. But even more complicated. It's a massive time sink, but the time is enjoyable. The game is in constant development and honestly the price right now is a steal for the content and quality of the game!

If you do get the game, hand holding is at a minimum and there's not much in the way of let's plays or other content that helps yet. Getting the basics of starting isn't so bad, but trying to figure out your logistics for pulling up the first tier of ores, smelting them, turning them into the products you need, and making sure everything gets to where you want it is going to take a few hours alone. Once you have that basis, the game starts to really open up. You'll be digging even deeper for the next tiers of resources and a variety of effects will have you changing your tactics, such as the chill caverns forces you to research and create a heating element in your suit, but also prevents your grappling hook from firing constantly and conveyor belts won't work through it. So you have to find a new source of transport (lifts, pipes, matter teleporters, hauling it yourself, you have options). And this continues further down.
On the surface you are facing attacks on your base. The strength of attacks are completely based off of your production performance providing a naturally scaling of difficulty. Don't let that worry you, though. If the base is destroyed, the only real harm you face is the base doesn't generate power for some time and all the ""torches"" you've placed will not be on until it has repaired itself.
Honestly give the game a go! If you hate it, step away from it, clear your head, and come back. This is one of the most underrated games on Steam and I've sunk dozens of hours into the game without even properly getting into the tier 2 ores.

You're encouraged and rewarded for really investing in your world, long term, and planning out your builds. I'm also happy with the tech progression. Frequently you're able to re-use your knowledge, designs, and resources to improve your builds. Every advancement in tech feels significant, like you got a promotion for your hard work.

A little about me: I really enjoyed Minecraft, and sunk my share of hours into Subnautica and Factorio. I like 'toys' rather than 'games' - the distinction being that I get to 'play with them', rather than being led through a prescribed experience. Which brings me to Fortresscraft Evolved. 

I almost bounced off the tutorial. I blundered about in darkness for half an hour, trying to apply 'knowledge' I'd learned from other games, and - of course - FCE does things its own way. In general, I prefer to experience games as 'un-spoiled' as possible, but knowing things like 'you can use the grappling hook to go downwards' really speeds things along. I'm sure smarter people than me are fine, but after a few minutes watching a Let's Play and I was off and away, happily setting up Tier One production and research chains. Keep the faith - there's a game here!

Inventory-management becomes a pressing issue within a few hours. You can't just dump surplus stuff in a chest. There's a mass storage device available, but I doubt I'll ever figure it out. It's fine. I run small buffers, and maintain even throughputs. 

Where some games give you incremental increases with each 'tier' of machine, FCE gives you 10x or 20x of 75x. Each level of gun turret and power transmitter is a huge step up from the previous one. It's properly satisfying to slap down the next tier, and watch it go to work. Like, 'ohh yeaaah' satisfying. You get to design and build your own custom machinery to run turrets and smelters and such. It's hella fun when your big turret arrays start banging away, belt-fed on enriched coal. It took me a very long time to unlock the regular ore smelter, but it was all the sweeter when I finally got there.

It's tricky to play a world on more than one PC. The save system is large, with myriad small files, and my small world took nearly an hour to sync across. It's easier to roll up a new world for each machine. It runs fine on my potato PC, so no probs there. 

Yes, there are pain points; obdurate ores impede early downward progress, and the grappling hook freeze kills me two times out of three. And hunting for organic rock. And wood. And that 'snow' is a thing. I'm sure the dev would have his head in his hands if he were watching over my shoulder. So far, I've found out about every threat the hard way. 'You froze', 'You got poisoned'. 'Don't touch those big worms'. 'What's all this black stuff in my base?' However there's no meaty feeling of success if the problem is trifling, and the solution is handed to you with a silver spoon. Sometimes the game is frustrating, but mostly I'm frustrated with myself. In order to be lazy, you gotta do the work. And then it's awesome.

Most games want you to win, some games (Nethack and FCE) seem indifferent, but give you all the tools you need. I'm guessing I'm in the 'early-mid' game right now, starting to process the next tier of fuel ore. My fortress is humming along, and feels well defended. I'm eager to find out what's deeper.",1531954539,1531954539,True,22,0,0.675778090953826904,0,True,False,False,False,,1532114193.0,"Honestly, this is perhaps the most accurate and best review I've seen on the game in a long time - thank you!"

Since the game was released in 2015, there have been 20 post-launch patches, with another coming within a few days. Each patch has brought more and more content as well as addressing complaints in the reviews.

Oh, and a Note About the Tutorial.
Reading other reviews, you may notice varying opinions of length and usefulness of the game's tutorial. Some say it's too long, not long enough. Too 'hand-holy' or not enough. 

The tutorial exists in three major pieces;
[list]
[*] The starting tutorial - Which is short and covers suit and battery power, research and crafting, and finally, a basic usage of conveyors via 'Ghost Blocks'. This lasts 3 – 5 minutes max.
[*] One off popups – These popups tell you about smelter automation and the first basic ores. You should only see them once, or multiple times if they are ignored. If you complete one and it keeps coming back, let the dev know. 
[*] The mission system - Which shows up on the top right of the screen with suggestions on what to do next, important and/or critical status messages about your base and other useful information. It lasts the entire game and if you really want, it can be turned off in the in-game options.

Regarding the DLC's; FF adds enough content to pull me back in, extending a worlds playtime by a huge margin, and while adventure pack is still patreon only, the mutators make the game fresh every run. While I dont generally pay for skins, I purchased Dapper as well, the game has earned it.

I have played solely multiplayer, so others experiences may vary, but the network experience is great, and only causes rare annoyances.

As said in some reviews, the tutorial only gives you a very basic idea what to do. However, consider this to be some sort of puzzle, unless you want to look up stuff on youtube or guides. The game gives you a way to automatize everything - including dealing with enemies and taking advantage of them. ""Process everything"". However, the game can be harsh on strategic errors you made simply because you didn't understand a mechanism or didn't use in the right way. 

All in all, not really polished, but has a lot of stuff. As with any such game, in the late game, there are many options to do things, but only a few are viable/efficient.

If you want to by entertained by building intricate logistics/processing setups, this might be the game for you.

Oh, the game isn't taking itself very serious - the robot with a monocle and mustache should be a giveaway. Your enemies are mostly slow-moving bees. So, if you want a ""harsh"" survival/building game you somehow must get into the state of mind that you're very, very scared of slowy hovering bees - to the point that a supervillan lair supported by a large and intricate underground mining operation ist the way to got.

at one point i also managed to dig a hole in the ground bellow where i was told to place an object. unfortunately there was no way that i could figure out how to fill it back in. this meant i couldnt place the object and in turn couldnt progress through the tutorial. then to compound the frustration it seems there's no return to main menu option, forcing me to exit the game completely just so i can restart the world.

Pros:
Visually its pretty decent.
Controls are nice and fluid.
Many actually useful gadgets like glowsticks and the grappling hook.
Energy system is much better than the typical food/water survival.
Mining/transporting is so much better than other voxel games, find a vein, stick a havester up to it, run a conveyor system, profit.
Watching your base wrech hordes.
Mining tool is amazing, if you can see it, you can break it or place something there, no making or repairing hundreds of pickaxes.
AUTOMATION

Cons:
Mostly little things, when interacting with a hopper, it doesnt open your inventory aswell.
Item management is kind of bad, the largest storage only holds 100 items until late game.
Generating power early game is annoying because your starting hub is all you get other than a small generator that doesnt produce much power or for very long.",1530914805,1530914805,True,9,1,0.613025486469268799,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Is this game for everyone: No
Is this game perfect: No
Does the tutorial walk you through step by step on everything: No but it shouldn't have to, part of the fun is figuring new things out
Is there a ton of content and things to do: absolutely (and the dev keeps updating with more things)
Do I recommend you try the game for yourself: 1000% YES

With that being said there is a bit of a learning curve to get started in on the game. There will be some trial and error on figuring things out, but so far there hasn't been anything completely out of left field that I couldn't piece together fairly easily. I can see a lot of the reviewers giving negative comments that have not spent enough time to even get into the game, saying it's boring and just another knock off clone to other games, that's far from the truth. Does it play similarly to other games in the same genre, of course it does, but it also has enough unique qualities to make it stand out as well. 

The mining and automation aspect is great. It gives you a sense of purpose and accomplishment.  The Building Gun is a great addition to building (if you've played with Builders Wands in Modded Minecraft, imagine that only better). 

There is a nice progression system that keeps you on task (if you need that). You are also free to explore the game as you see fit, add in the Grappling Hook and you're free to explore high and low.

Bottom line: if you are a fan of Building/Survival games, Minecraft Mods that rely heavily on automation, or the likes this is one that you should pick up (especially for the price). 

As an A-side I have watched some of the developer videos and I can see why some people think he might be a ""not so pleasant person"", I see it as this. Most of the backlash i've heard from him are people saying ""This doesn't work, or it's not useful"". I don't think he's open to straight criticism but rather solution based criticism. If you don't think something is useful or isn't working, provide a solution rather than just ""This sucks, it's broken"". 

He has a specific vision of the game (as can be expected being basically a sole dev on the project), he doesn't say you can't do certain things but he will blatantly say ""That's not the best way to do it"" or ""That's now what I envisioned"", there's no sugar coating it. I think he's entitled to say things like this with the amount of effor he's put into it. You can still play the game the way you want whether it's in line with his vision or not. Most likely you will have a great time playing it either way. I have no affiliation with the dev's in any way but after playing my fair share (and I plan to continue to get a ton of enjoyment out of it) I feel like a poster child trying to sell the game on their behalf, trying to get friends and family to invest as well haha.

Your first playthrough, expect at least 20 hours just to learn everything you can do in this game, and how not to die, aka, get your base blown up. Yes, there is that much content to learn about. Every trip out from your base nets you a new thing that must be researched/investigated! Even if it isn't that exciting, it generally leads to something else that is. 

After about 40 hrs. you've probably mastered automation and are nearing the expansion content, fully powering your OET at least once. 

~20 hrs if you started automating ore smelting early. 
Longer if you hand carry everything and don't build storage. 

After about 200 hrs, you probably have a good grip on how to fight bugs and automate things. Congrats, you now own your own planet. 

With just the base game, you can get a couple hundred hours out of just one map if you enjoy any kind of base building.
With the expansion, you can easily double that. 
With friends, mods, and different difficulty/map settings...100% worth the small investment for the game and extras.

Ignore that with friends part. Make them charge their own OET. They would probably just steal all your bug parts and have glow stick fights while you are the only one doing any work anyways. Screw 'em.

Commenting negatively about the game with less then at least 1 hr of playtime just makes you a dick. Not just that, but an uninformed, unknowning, lazy dick that can't even automate your coal production first. But you go keyboard warrior. Fight on!

p.s. The dev isn't really a dick.

For example: at the start you go find tin and copper ore, and build miners on them to gather resources. You carry those to your start base, and smelt them in the 1 smelter you have into bars. From those you can build power transmitters and conveyors to bring the ores to your base automatically, and have them fed into the smelter. That part is nice and makes sense, doesn't it?
However, for the next step of automation you require various different kinds of metalls (next tier lithium and iron get added to the mix). Okay, that also seems reasonable at first. bit harder to get them as they are deeper, but you can do that with your initial setup. But you will soon run into a simpel problem as you try to progress: It is insanely slow, because you only got 1 smelter. And an additional smelter first requires you to find additional resources that are randomly scattered throug the world, and even then only gives you cheaper version fo the smelter that eat twice as many resoruces for every bar you make in them. And the list goes on like that.

It's just very unintuitive, and overall really, really unecessarily slow for the start.

I absolutely love this game, and have some offline hours. I just got too much going on in life to play it now.. the game takes time to play. Anyway...

Love the atmosphere. I disagree with one player's comment that voxel/3d is not a good mix--it's fine, don't be a w@nker. Factorio aspect is obviously fun and interesting in 3d. Exploring is really fun, especially with the deep caverns.

I guess there is a bit of a learning curve. You'll get the hang of the helpfile (""h"" button) after a few tries. Between that and discussion board/wiki/fandom and a little trial/error you can figure it out, and once you get the basics, you'll be hooked I promise. Personally I liked that there was less handholding in terms of learning the game (I'm still learning new things after 7.0 hours). I've never had a hard time finding an answer on something.

YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE. Dude, Factorio sells for $30, and Empyryon (my personal fav as far as exploration/crafting) sells for $20.

Even a bit afraid, because the dev had a rough personal patch and I thought ""welp this game is over, let's move on"". For some reasons, I checked again the game recently. To my surprise, the development cycle resumed and a lot of interesting patches were released, and it's still going strong. I don't write much reviews, but given the amount of efforts the dev put in what appears to be a love project, I feel like I have to recommend the game :-)

[h1]Let's start with the bad[/h1]
The game is fugly. Seriously. Lightings are all over the place, the mix between cubes and 3D does not work, there are a lot of contrast problems and it gets really hard to differentiate everything. And the menu/UI could really use some love. And even if the tutorial is okay, the learning curve/progression is pretty steep. The sound design isn't great as well. (what's up with the constant notifications)

[h1]But there is so much more[/h1]
I am a big fan of automation games and sandboxes. Think of the baby of Factorio and Minecraft. Fortresscraft really scratches that itch and once you start automating everything, it is very, very satisfying. Lots of optimization have been done and the game runs pretty well. There are hundreds of items and you always want to dig a bit deeper. The game is extremely stable, not a single glitch. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Is Fortresscraft a perfect game? Far from it. But it definitely caters to its audience and has been thoroughly followed up by its developer during the years. I read he is planning on finishing the game in a couple of versions, and I think it's a good choice.

评测这个东西的写法并不唯一，我就姑且想到什么先写些什么吧。
在谈游戏内容前先说说另一个玩家的评测里提到的时间消耗问题。我的记录上的时间算是从去年这时候开始到现在断断续续基本完成两次本体内容和一次dlc内容的合计时间，两次通关本体中一次是rapid一次是plenty，说来惭愧，rapid那次花了上百个小时，简直给统计数据丢脸……但实际上在我看来rapid速度并不像游戏内的介绍一样适合新玩家上手，反而更适合熟悉了游戏的基本流程的有经验玩家来体验mutator或是挑战测试，因为rapid速度一上来资源积累过快以至于新玩家根本没时间消化理解第一次接触到的游戏概念。在我看来plenty速度的资源积累更适合新玩家了解游戏初期的设置自动化生产线，发现和解决基地中出现的问题，以及……有足够的反应时间来应对第一波蛾子的攻击——要知道在通关解锁的rush mode里第一波蛾子只要不到一个小时就能刷出来，这对于上来就被数据和说明淹没，而且手里原本有的小手电激光枪还被更新给锁在研究科技后的新玩家来说可不是什么正面的体验。用plenty速度灭掉一个overmind熟悉基本流程后就可以尝试用解锁的rush mode二周目速通基本盘以后开始正式体验各种意义上恐怖的dlc——Frozen Factory了……
老实说，在我看来这个游戏的精华其实就是这个通关平均时间基本上数百小时的令人发毛的dlc了，倒不是说这dlc做得有多么的优秀——相信我，我的至少四百个小时的FF内容的游戏时间里并不是每个小时都是开心和满足的——而是制作者他的理念在逐步完善这个dlc的过程里里体现得淋漓精致，至于玩家会不会喜欢这个理念嘛，你看这作者和有些评测玩家的沟通就能看出来，他并不会像有些玩家所期望的那样去巴结讨好玩家，但也并不会那么有效的和玩家沟通就是了。喜欢的人自然会喜欢，不喜欢的人也不会浪费时间，steam如此之大，总能让有爱之人找到所爱之物的。
说到制作者的制作理念，我其实不时的在游戏过程中会冒出这是个恐怖游戏的感觉，你看，在充满凶恶未知生物的异星上，主人公得独自一人忍受夜晚冻死，坠落摔死，冰洞层冷死，毒洞层毒死，熔岩层烫死，以及dlc里被手下的各种机械恁死的千奇百怪的死法，以及洞穴探索中那诡异的背景音效，还有喜欢从各种角落和表面蹦出来吓人一跳的恶心妖孽。这一切如果没有游戏里那些怼天怼地的凶暴自动化机械，足够让我恶心出一身鸡皮疙瘩了。可是有这些工业化武装到牙齿的部队在手，我的心里面对环境的种种刁难只有“不过是个/群XX罢了，渣渣。”的不屑一顾的感想。就像游戏的商店页面题图一样，真正掌握了这个游戏后，是会感受到factorio一般的征服乃至毁灭自然的快感的。
诚然，数千万乃至上亿的T4矿消耗是很多，可玩家应当已经从对游戏本体这个巨大的教程的学习中应当已经获得了解决问题的办法——不断扩大生产，优化物流，分析目标，规划路径，做好数手准备。
——关于汉化的分割线——
先说结论，总体来说现阶段不推荐给中文玩家，因为汉化问题。

如果汉化出来了，视乎汉化质量可能对向中文玩家推荐仍旧持保留意见。
原因如下：
1. 这个游戏的本地化工作并不是由开发者本人进行的，而是类似于众筹一样挂在第三方网站上有爱好者自发进行的，所以开发者本身完全无法对本地化质量有任何保证。
2. 基于此一先决条件，结合在本地化网站上看到的汉化之不足，我不需要估计也能预见到这种汉化一旦推出，在当下蒸汽中文社区之“无中文玩不了”“汉化差给差评”的潮流影响下期待高质量本地化的中文玩家应该也不会玩得很舒服。
3. 既然玩家玩得不开心，那么这游戏推出汉化能得到的大约不会是好评如潮。如果十分熟悉这个游戏或是留心原因1的玩家应该会发现这个游戏其实只有一个全职的开发者。这位猫奴腐国小哥Dj，并不是当年只会开发游戏穷得揭不开锅而痛定思痛拥抱发行商道路而从此堕入dlc狂魔邪道的p社，所以应该不会有耐心处理没营养的差评，更没能力改进本地化质量。那么可想而知在本游戏已近开发尾期的当下，Dj也许就因为心灰意冷放弃了原本也许可以期待在下个补丁中加入游戏中的内容而转身投入下一个游戏的开发了。

于是，这个结果对那些发泄完过一晚上就忘了这个游戏的玩家来说自然没有任何影响，可是对像我一样期待着新补丁新玩具的玩家来说是莫大的损失。

所以综上所述，我不会推荐这个游戏给中文玩家。

不过我还是会给好评，因为我喜欢这个游戏。

最后，说个有趣的事实，这游戏有个国旗皮肤dlc，里边有中国国旗的主题涂装，期待买了的玩家尝试一下。

I have brought up issues I have had on the community board and heard and seen nothing.

For gamers who use a left handed mouse, it's typical to use PL;' for direction control as opposed to WASD.  Not every left-hander, but many.  The coders have made a mistake where when you bind the apostrophe key to Strafe Right, using it in the game will instead open up the Console in the top of the screen.  I have a second apostrophe/tilde key on the top left of my laptop and it too will open the console.

Another problem is during the tutorial you will be prompted to press default keys to perform actions.  What if you've re-binded them, do they get updated in the tutorial hints?  No.  This wouldn't be a problem if there weren't so many commands in this game.  You might not have a problem with this, thinking that you can hit ESC to pause and check your keyboard settings?  Wrong.  The only time you can see what you set the multitude of kind bindings to is when you *launch* the game.  If you want to see what you set a command to, then you need to quit the game, and restart it and look on the splash screen.

In short, it's too late for me to get a refund.  Since the game makers do not address my concern and since I don't get my money back, I get to leave a review suggesting that people coming from the same place I do avoid this one.

However I've chatted with someone who finished it and he explained the game to me. Since then I've picked it back up and played some more.

All in all the game is fun if you like a factorio/minecraft mashup. There are a few bad things and a few good things - however you will have to invest a bit of time (definitely more than the 2h to return the game) to see if you'll like it or not.

Good:
1. Progression feels somewhat slow, but that might just be my inexperience.
2. Automation is logical and fun.
3. The grappling hook is not only a life saver, its also fun to fly across the map with it.

Bad:
1. The UI is still bad - there is a help screen, but you have to fiddle around with it a bit to notice that e.g. the research tab only shows topics you can currently research. A graph or similar would've been better. It's also never explained that the little tube above the hotbar is the charge for the robot. 
2. The glare is a massive problem unless you disable it through a command - there's still no option to disable it through the menu.
3. 'Sonar' sound when scanning is incredibly neauseating.

## Old review:
The premise is good. However everything else is bad: The UI, the gameplay, the tutorial, the graphics. The graphics wouldn't be that bad if the rest were enjoyable - but it just isn't.

The scans for ores are so bright that you're unable to see anything else. Once you get hypothermia due to low energy (with no warning) you can't see anything because there's a thick blue layer over the entire screen which gets even thicker to the sides.
Edit: This is a common issue. You can disable this by hitting enter and then typing `/detail glare`, which turns the glare off. The developer doesn't deem it necessary to make this option available though the UI though: https://steamcommunity.com/app/254200/discussions/0/458605613405550432/


The only way to propagate power on the y axis is to stack batteries onto each other.
Edit: I've been corrected, if you put a power transmitter on a wall you can send power on the y axis.

The sound design is horrible as well - it's either not there or annoying. Specifically the scan noises are nauseating.

It's only possible to have up to ten worlds.

First came Minecraft, where you start on a planet and build Houses and Farms, then move onto bigger projects; then came Factorio where you build automated supply lines to go on to build rockets to escape the planet, but between that, came Fortress Craft on the Xbox, which at that time was a mining game that mostly creative and almost looked like a clone of Minecraft that was 2014. In 2016 it evolved. Fortress Craft Evolved dumps you onto a unknown planet after a ship crash reminiscent of  Phantasy Star Universe though completely unrelated, leaving you to fend yourself in a strange environment.

[u]Fun Factor & Gameplay[/u]

This game is really quite fun, your first task after the tutorial is to mine and smelt metals to build a upgraded supply line, then you need to research new technologies to build better defences like lasers an rocket to defend your base against what might come. Can you do that in Minecraft?!
Later on you get cargo lifts and minecarts to haul materials from deeper levels, which is loads of fun, however if you are a slow player it might take you longer to build up a proper base. There is also a aesthestic side to Fortress Craft Evolved where you can build 'rooms' to speed up machines,
and later on you can go into the cold caverns and build a “Frozen Factory”

[u] Controls [/u]

Most of the game is controlled by a mouse, and the interface is overall easy to use, The interfaces are easy to use, and read,another form of control is to use the joypad which can be confusing to use but, the controls can be configured in the start up dialogue.

[u] Graphics [/u]

The graphics are pretty impressive even on Good, as you improve the settings, the graphics improve immensely.
There are 5 different game modes,but the one you ought to use is Good. There is also Simple & Fabulous plus a few others. Good is recommended for most computers, the graphics are clean and the text is easy to read, there is no
slow down. Next is Fabulous, this increases the graphics quite a bit and everything looks quite prestine,
however this might slow down your PC, if you don't own a good graphics card, or playing on a laptop.
If you're machine isn't that great, there's less intensive graphical modes to use, such as Simple, Fast and Fastest.
There is one more game mode which I wouldn't recommend for quite a few years.

[u] Sound [/u]

Sound wise it is clear and music adds atmosphere and gameplay elements,
the intro music is reminiscent of Halo. The sound effects of missiles and lasers sounds futuristic and the aliens have splatter effects.

[u] Replayability [/u]
This game has loads of re-playability, since the game is evolving, with the latest “Adventures Pack (WIP)” adding mutators and new game modes.

[u] Conclusion [/u]
This game is a brilliant indie game with loads of fun things to do, and has loads of replayability, the graphics are next level and the sound and music are great. You'd be living in a 'Phantasy Universe' to think this is a bad game. 

The Good 
[list]
[*] Loads of Fun
[*] Great Sound
[*] Excellent Graphics

The Bad
[*] Can be confusing if using joypad.
[*] May take longer for slow players.

If you've ever played Factorio that's a 2D version of FortressCraft, and as far as it being a Minecraft clone forget about it, MC  won't even come close to what FCE is capable of world-wise with depths of 4 quadrillion meters!!!

Graphics: For a voxel game the graphics are amazing with Day/Night cycles, real-time shadows, screen-space reflections, reflection maps, diffuse lighting and more, enough to make even a top-notch pc cry with settings maxed out.

Sound: Not much to say about sounds other than they are crisp and clear.

Gameplay: With over 400 machine you can build there is no lack of things to do in FCE from building basic conveyors to move resources to setting up solar panels to collect sunlight to digging 100's of meters underground to setup a cargo lift to bring raw materials to the surface, to setting up a massive arrays of missle launchers to defend your base, 

Other things to point out:

- The Frozen Factory DLC and soon to be released Adventure Pack DLC can add hundreds of more hours of gameplay EASILY justifying there completely reasonable pricetag.

- FCE has steam workshop support and already has a number of mods created by the fanbase adding even more playability

- 64+ player Co-op can be played locally over TCP/IP or by running a dedicated server for which anyone can join.

- Replayability is endless in FCE as no two play-through's will ever be the same.

- There is no limit to the amount of machines you can build, you are only limited by the power of your PC.

- The developer is very active on the forums, constantly releasing updates, even streaming test builds of his progress.

The sound effects have been changed recently and I can now play the game without having to mute the speakers every time I want to scan the area.  This is a huge improvement in the game play for me.

I still think the balance is off and there are still issues with the base game for me, I dislike the caverns and find them pretty uninteresting and they do not suit my playstyle at all.  I currently dig down and then place a machine that digs a vertical tunnel upwards while the entire time wishing I could place a machine to dig lift shafts for me.

Most of the issues I have with the game are superficial now and can easily be worked around, however, I still have to choose between a yes or a no and ultimately while I enjoy the game in the most part, I wouldn't actually recommend it to anyone unless they already know they would like the style of game.

We really need a neutral review setting on steam and if one is ever added, I'll change this to reflect that.


Old Review:

1. The sound effect from scanning ore can induce migraines and nausea.  (I understand why it is used, but there needs to be a toggle for those it affects rather than muting the sound completely).
1a.  The noise that indicates crystals are nearby would have been more interesting if it was based on a sonar style representation and would avoid the main problem with it.  I do hope that they either work to change that or at least mitigate the problem by allowing you to silence that one noise with a toggle.


2.  The new landscapes do feel better than original but I'd like to have more control over the starting area, especially being able to select a flatter larger starting area.

3.  Early game balance still doesn't feel right (this is entirely a subjective thing).

4.  Research and UI need a lot more polish.

There is a good game hiding underneath it all, I just can't recommend it while it has these issues outstanding, in particular the first one.",1524931927,1533741552,False,11,2,0.498336434364318848,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I adore this game.  It's basically the love child of Minecraft and Infinifactory, taking everything good about those games and making something better from it.  The basic gameplay loop - find resource, mine resource, automate crafting with resource - is incredibly satisfying, and the occasional break for tower defense elements blends together surprisingly well.  Balancing your time between expanding your power grid, increasing your ability to mine resources, and defending against alien attacks is a lot of fun.  In many ways Fortresscraft is 3D Factorio, but the constant waves of enemies (and the subtle quest to find a way to stop them permanently) give the game a focus and direction that I feel Factorio lacks.

The game has an occasional issue with overly-insistant tutorials/missions, but thankfully in the latest patch the dev added an option for experienced players to turn them off.  I definitely do reccomend that new players leave the missions on, however - there is a lot of depth to this game, and a bit of guidance can make the difference between having a blast and wandering around frustrated not sure what to do.

The dev is always adding new features and tweaking existing ones; you can walk away from the game for six months and come back to it feeling fresh, which is something I enjoy greatly.  Sometimes new features feel a little unpolished, but the dev always seems to come back and iterate until they hit a good spot.

As of this time, I have over 500 hours of playtime and I expect much more in the future. This is an amazing cost to time investment. At its heart, this feels largely like an automation game. You'll find though that there's also farming, tower defense, exploration and logistics. The game has lots of configuration options for creating your world. I have yet to explore them thoroughly and I plan to make use of them. The way the game is played and how these settings effect the value of machines (not all are as useful depending on your settings, but playstyles differ) enhances the mystery and makes for a challenging and enjoyable puzzle.

* A helpful community.
* Great time investment and replayability.

After 500 hours, I figure any survivors have had ample time to land and help. If their landing was rough, abrupt, or just terminal.. That's too bad, they had their chance!

Much has changed in this time. The planet looks so much nicer. Moving around is so much smoother. I now have comfortable, climate controlled rooms to make my life easier, and my base less cluttered! I believe this is due to the planet's mysterious $deity, a force known as 'Dj' which has been very active over the last couple of years. It is mostly benevolent, but woe unto those who take his work in vain!

Ore veins. Yes. Those. That's where my journey began. And coal veins. The lifeblood of the planet. I started with some rudimentary equipment, sufficient to power my hub. From there, new abilities were revealed, allowing me to expand my manufacturing capabilities, enabling more research! But I wasn't alone on this planet, and not everything was friendly. 

Luckily my research library included designs for weapons to defend my base, and eventually, take the fight to the enemy and defeat it.. Or so I thought.

So it's been a fun 500hrs, and more content is being added, optimisations made, and features like mutators to tweak planet generation and increase replayability. And we can even watch the developer working on the game! Plus there's a healthy modding community, and if you just want to make your own tweaks, many of the key game files are in friendly .xml.

The game is a block-based logistics simulator with a healthy dose of base defence thrown in for good measure. If you like Factorio, or similar, you'll probably like this. Plus it's 3D! Which means glorious caverns to explore, rich with ores, gemstones, wildlife.. Some of which have a mean right hook. Sneaky lil gits! There are multiple biomes, which come into their own with the Frozen Factory expansion, but the base game has much FUN!

So, buy now if you haven't already! Support a hard working indie dev, and this underappreciated gem!

And some bonus tips:

Read the hints!
Think 3D. Many devices have multiple faces. This can be the difference between a tidy base, or a shrine to Cthulhu
Give yourself space! One smelter, good! 3 lines better! 5 lines is generally enough for most bases
Use rooms, especially on a lower spec PC. There are a lot of animations and pretty things, so putting production lines inside rooms can take the strain off your machine. Or just make for a tidier base
Always keep a few explosives charging. For reasons. Or just <KaBOOMs!>. Express landscaping! Stand well back..",1522953435,1522953435,True,10,1,0.56699824333190918,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Game is really fun - if you like base building.

GUI is at least unusal and needs a little adapting.
Inventory at first glance seems weird, like it is global, but is not and that feeling, in my opinion, is caused by default, easy settings, were you don't lose stuff on death.

Enemies is the week side of this game. They do their job, I can't say they don't but are very minimalistic. Wave enemies just attack CORE, nothing else. Im not sure if this is configurable but at this state feels kind of bad. Fortunately there are other hazards, most passive and give more depth to the world.

Bugs, little bugs are common but non game braking and no crashes. Synchronization is not full, even firearm shooting is not synchronized. Body movement of another player is pretty off.

There is pretty good descriptions in game about items, crafting, etc under H key. Rarelly information is missing but wiki page is quite good. I used wiki just later in game for minor things so I think it speaks for itself.

I have to say I was very skeptical about this game, mostly because of the appearance. Even after first run it pushed me away.

This game allows you to setup complex and automated manufacturing lines. Which you will need to use to build up your defences as the more you build the more the wildlife won't like you and they will attack you in waves like a tower defence game. There is an option though to disable them or make them trivial or even harder. The options at world creation gives plenty of options to set the difficulty of the game.

Though as with every game there are also a few small points in my opinion that could be improved and I'm only going to mention one here. And that is navigating the world, even with the Holobase > Map mode. I found this mode not to helpfull as it didn't show any explored terrain or dig out shafts. Also lining yourself up perfectly in this mode with some machines is hard.

But there are solutions to a lof those problems if you just look into the workshop, for my navigation problem I have a mod installed that adds a GPS suit upgrade.

（欲购买DLC，请读完我最下面的回顾，谢谢）

白手起家，建造超级工厂，抵御虫族入侵，当你有足够的电力和资源时，发展你的武器系统，摧毁这个星球上的异虫基地。

喜欢“我的世界”的小伙伴们绝不要错过这款游戏（官方汉化进度已经超过95%了，目前还没有加入，估计快了），自带光影，高清材质，最NB的是，这款游戏支持多线程运行，效率比我的世界高N倍，也就是说，容纳同样多的机器的情况下，我的世界会变成慢速PPT，但这款游戏只是少有卡顿（除非你用的是赛扬CPU，当然好显卡也是必须的）。

游戏内容上，不加mod（原版，注意加了mod不能解成就）就已经有超多内容了，海量的科技研究和各种各样的机器，足够让你玩一阵子的了，支持多人，但需要开启网络uPnP才能创建服务器。游戏中暂时没有主动攻击敌人（只有试图摧毁你的信标的敌人，但是信标会自愈），敌人基地必须用轨道炮才能摧毁，没有像我的世界那样紧张刺激的战斗和操作，唯一比较紧张的就是探索深大4000+米的地下世界，天空貌似是没有上限的，有一个成就是让你突破高空1600米，可见这款游戏的自由度有多高了。

虽然游戏还在“抢鲜”阶段，多少还有些小问题，但我还是强力推荐的，正在玩一周目，做完某些任务还能解锁更多模式，喜欢抖M的玩家也可以考虑启用死亡掉落、蜂窝地形、资源匮乏、发电无力、毁信标删档等变态设定，一定超刺激的，哈哈哈哈哈。

DLC之FFE内容非常坑，如果你不想被花太多时间的话，请不要尝试，原因如下：

T4矿石的生产问题，16矿石冶炼1锭（6高炉，铬、钼最高熔炼速度0.5锭/秒），12锭一机械方块，100机械方块做5组件，75组件造一个地热电机（满足MagmaBore运行的最低供电需求，需要多少台依难度而定），还不算矿车、货梯缓冲时间，以及造制冷液那一套东西，我感觉不睡觉没1个月下不来！

就前些天开分矿，被HiveMind吃铁轨厂和堵竖井不说（离基地太远的地方HiveMind是横行的，到处滋生），包括发电、输电、开矿、冶炼、物流这一套，就搞了3天，挂机刷材料用了超过90%的时间（bulk货梯升级是最坑的），然而又过了4天，才把magmaBore造出来，制冷液那一套需要的材料更多，但这还不如造Geothermal要的多，后面如何清空bore上方80米高度区域的麻烦事简直怒不可言。

综上，我只能说，如果你真的“有时间”的话，你可以考虑购买DLC中的FFE。


========================================= 更新于  2020-03-08

新的AP内容吧，都有什么内容其实介绍里都说了，谈谈我的感受和看法：

高级传送器的描述为什么是missing_string，什么鬼，新开发的东西难道都不做测试就这样发布了么？

机器人，我没有玩，感觉就是一种没有轨道的矿车（玩过，效率真心不怎么高），但需要电，效率上感觉并不不怎么很高的样子；

轨道炮，简单计算了一下，制作所有1400+终极升级件需要超过870k钛锭，当然还不包括其他各种金属锭，我已经挂了4天了，只有500终极升级件而已。看描述建设好的轨道炮还需要1km的轨道，是不是还需要材料有待验证，做轨道炮的代价可想而知；

游戏优化吧，真不敢恭维，也可能是我电脑太老的缘故。和上一周目相比，这次工厂机器明显减少，但卡顿程度几乎不减，当然大规模存储更是不敢做了，规模太大能卡到1fps以下；

hivemind到处滋生的问题貌似已经去掉了，至少我厂房里再没出现过突然冒出个hivemind的情况，倒是离基地远一些的地方时不时冒出来个新的也还是常事；

这个游戏真的是让我又爱又恨，我还整理了一些游戏内容改进上的建议，想给开发看看，但是一看AP发布到现在都几年了，也不知道发了他们还会不会看，看了会不会更新呢。。。


========================================= 更新于  2020-03-13

关于冒险包DLC的轨道炮和GPS，我想说，开发是不是脑子有病。

花了大把时间和精力造好的轨道炮，居然只是个显示数字的摆设。发射有没有动画就不知道了，那可怕的充能时间，充满自动计数1次，还显示什么充能时间。从社区一查，这玩意就是个资源无底洞，想要快速充能，你需要给他塞大量的资源，而回报，就是让跑上的显示数字变得“好看”一点。就这样，社区里还有人炫耀自己的跑花了多长时间充能，充能速度有多快，发射了多少次…… 这游戏的意义难道就是为了挂机看数字么……

不如这样，做一个有计数功能的垃圾桶，把你基地里能删除的所有东西全丢进去，过上几个月，比比看谁删除的东西最多！

GPS依然只是摆设，他永远是offline，除非你是在活动期间加入了个什么pornton群，那你才有GPS功能。我本以为轨道炮是用来发射GPS卫星的，真是失望至极，既然不能用，干脆你就别显示GPS那些字，碍眼。

From what I can tell, this game is optimized *extremely* well. It quits loads very quickly. So quickly that I can quit out instead of just leaving the game running and come back to it a few minutes later. Compare the same with Minecraft with a Feed the Beast modpack. Minecraft with FTB barely runs on this laptop, and it takes about 10 minutes to load. Fortresscraft Evolved takes under a minute. 

It runs at a very solid framerate on this old laptop despite lots and lots of in-game things going on (single player). In the many times I've ran this game, it's never crashed, ever.

Yes it has its bugs, but so do the mods for Minecraft. Could it be a little more polished? Sure, but it's one guy.

Updated Review: 100 hours into a 2nd world.
Got this game as a gift, and it says it's Full Release, but it feels more like an Early Access game.

--The flashlight is such a powerhog as to render it virtually useless.  By the time you can really use it a decent amount it's almost moot.
--If I want to put something in storage I need to interact with the storage unit and then I need to open my inventory.  Doesn't sound too bad till you've had to go through that several hundred times in the early stages of your base.  Why doesn't interacting with a hopper automatically also open my inventory tab?  
--There's NO compass.
--There's no good way to set waypoints for anything you find and want to revisit.  Want to mark the XYZ coordinates of a large vein of minerals you found?  Too bad.  The ""Waypoint Machine"" is not a good substitute for this.  It requires power and you can't see it if it's too far away.
--Research points...  Your first world, you are probably going to screw yourself.  Second world you are going to be VERY stingy on unlocking recipes, only unlocking the ones you KNOW you need and skipping the superfluous ones.  Otherwise it's dig deeper than you want to go at the time or scour the landscape for crashed ship parts with their crate of research materials.
--The Power System:  You're gonna need a lot of Laser Energy Transmitters to get power where it needs to go even for a medicore starter base.  This is because all generators only work close to the surface (40m or less deep or so) but you need to go HUNDREDS of meters deep to get all the ores you'll eventually need.  Mostly annoying because you can't randomly explore and then easily build back to base.
--Your base must be 100% self defending.  Build a decent number of turrets for defense...  Then build 4x more.  Because what you initially think should handle an attack won't be enough.
--The Tutorial needs work.  2 hours in and I didn't know I had a rifle.  Only learned about it because I read a comment on the forums.
--Plants that grow on the surface can be harvested and seem to have the single use of being made into Ampules which apparently aid in healing.  Would have been nice to have this mentioned in the Help Menu.
--The ingame Help Book is incomplete.  The info for numerous items is something along the lines of ""Tooltip info not yet implemented.""


This is a logistics game.  It's all about building a massive automated logistics structure.

As the name might suggest.  You have to build a base.  but what 95% of the population would consider a base the developer clearly doesn't.  There is no need for walls, or doors, or windows or anything for that matter.  In fact if you were to ask the developer, he might actually say that they look stupid and are a bad idea.  

So then really what is FortressCraft Evolved.  to put in plain and simple. it's a game about automation with a little bit of tower defense built in.  And you also can't forget that of course you're also playing the way the developer wants you to play with no room for deviating from his master plan.   Because if you play in your own style which of course is totally wrong, the next patch, or a few patches later, he will change it, so you can't play like that anymore.  What there is, is a bottoms up approach to mining underground.  What I mean by that is.  instead of drilling or digging down to resources from up above like you would expect.  You first have to dig down and then build your infrastructure back up.  A classic example is the Auto Excavator which is a device a lot of people will use for things like cargo lifts and shafts for lifts.  the only problem with it is.... it digs up, and not down, and I might also add that it's not a self contained device, it requiers power.    

From a design standpoint, there is nothing really ground breaking here, more like eye breaking from the rainbow colored terrain, the overly bad use of light shaft effects and bloom that leaves you blind to the stuttering and cracling reverb effects when you start digging down in to the different areas.   The game surprisingly performs fairly well on an older graphics cards but take that with a grain of salt because some people tend to have issues with larger bases.  

As for the Automation aspect of the game, which claims to be it's main selling point, it sells the game short for the simple reason you're not given a complete set of tools to really automate.  There is no control logic and or flow control and besides a few devices that can join two lines in to one at fixed ratios you're petty much stuck building in one continious line until you get your final product with little to no support for branching off of a line.  

Overall, I would say that this game is EA beta quality at best.  The developer is still adding FUNDIMENTAL game mechanics that completely change the way you have to play the game.  About the only positive thing that I can think about that is at least he is being considerate enough to create multiple snapshots of the different patches so you can choose to leave out changes if you want.",1518568160,1518568160,False,18,3,0.514853835105895996,10,True,False,False,False,,,

Others have said it before but the graphics are voxel and so it invariably will be compared to Minecraft.
It isn't Minecraft.
The best comparison is some sort of lovechild between Minecraft and Factorio (although I haven't actually played Factorio and this does bear similarities to Tekkit) in that it's voxel-y but relies heavily on automation.

That said, this isn't really a survival game either (unless you play ironman/hardmode) as there's really no kind of death penalty unless you opt-in.
It's really more of a logistics game so if you like big bases and you cannot lie and enjoy designing the ""best"" way to do a thing then you'll probably like this. I took a punt on it and after I got past the, admittedly sketchy, tutorial I lost quite a lot of my life to it.


Some things in here are a bit overpowered but then there are others that are underpowered which begs the question of why they're there at all (I'm looking at you MK1 Turrets). There are a bunch of criticisms you might launch at this game but considering it's the work of a single guy he's done pretty well I think. Most of the things that irk me about the game I can avoid by merely doing something a different way.

It's a pretty solid game and everything seems to work properly. I've run into a few ""bugs"" only for it to turn out that I'm just doing something wrong (which, oddly, is a good thing). 
One bad thing though that you'll likely run into is lag as the world is loaded when you travel quickly (i.e. with the jetpack). Flying over relatively long distances faster than the chunks load can cause you to be frozen in place whilst they finish loading and your battery pack will continue to drain whilst you're stuck there and can lead to an ignominous fall.

I'll just mention here that I've played through the base game twice now and will start FF soonish. It took ~220hrs the first time and ~120hrs the second. I'm the type to play it safe though, so I go slowly. YMMV.

The long and short of it though is that if you enjoy automation and logistics games and you have a little patience getting to grips with it beyond the tutorial and you have nothing pressing to do with your evenings (you'll look up after ""just 15 minutes"" and it will be 4am, set an alarm to go to bed) then you'll probably love this game too.",1518034523,1518034652,True,6,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It still showed as early access but was quite playable and it's continuing to change and that change is mostly for the better.

At a glance it seemed a bit like games like Minecraft but you're basically headed toward some serious automation as you work to protect your base from hostile native lifeforms (I guess the fortress part) as you explore and find new materials to grow your base. It has some tower defense elements due to the way the enemies come in but that helps focus your base defenses so when an attack comes you should already have automated defenses so your puny raygun isn't really needed to defend your base.

I've started a number of worlds as I can't quite seem to fully appreciate that you have an entire world to build your base on and as I start getting to the more advanced tech the base keeps getting crowded. SO I eventually tire of tearing stuff up to move it further out and start fresh. I'll get it right yet. Might take a couple hundred more hours though. Actually FortressCrack may be a more appropriate name.... :)

Overall an enjoyable game if you like building and automating things. And what a sense of accomplishment when you get to the point where you have a fully automated setup from extracting and smelting the ore and the resulting machines making all the parts and assembling and fueling missiles then distributing them to the launchers as waves of huge bugs try to attack your precious Central Power Hub and you can merrily go about your next project as all that happens automatically.

[h1]What the game is[/h1]
Fortresscraft is 
[list]
[*]95% logistics
[*]4% Tower defence 
[*]1% survival shooter
[/list]
[b]Most[/b] if not all of the negative reviews seem to be people who don't know this, and are expecting a different genre of game.

It's about building a big mining operation and the most efficient factory you can as fast as you can. If you go slow it's easy, if you try and progress fast it's hard.

This game is meant for automation. You can manually craft things but that feels slow and grindy. You are meant to set up a production line that will make things for you while you do something else.

[h1]What the game is not[/h1]
This game is not a suvival game in the sense that danger awaits you around every corner. It does have some survival elements, but these are secondary to logistics and automation. There is some danger from enemies, but most of my deaths are due to fall damage.

This game is not a shooting game. Yes you have a gun, but think of it like a tool for killing mynocks and defence against camobots. The but bugs have far too much health for you to even hope to take down. Build turrets.

This game is not a Tower Defence game. It has some tower defence but that is secondary to logistics and automation. You should think of the enemies attacking your base as a resouce. You want to kill them for the loot. If they kill you base, usually the only consequece is you don't get all the loot they would drop (as they disappear when you lose) and the threat scanner records your loss. However to ""complete"" the game you must charge the OET for times, if you do lose while charging, you have to start all over.

[h1]What I really like about this game[/h1]
I like many types of games from Modded Minecraft to Ark: Survival Evolved. The closest game I've played to Fortresscraft is Industrialcraft for Minecraft. I wouldn't compare it directly with minecraft however. The way I play modded minecraft for the most part isvery similar to the way I play Fortresscraft Evolved.

Very atmospheric! 

Dig deep, There is no limit to have deep you can dig unlike other games

Massive cave systems. Many caves are bigger than the entire build limit of other games.

Grappling around giants caves is endless fun!

The game is still being developed! Patch 18 is releasing such good stuff!

Next I feel should weigh in on some on the other things I've read in the other reviews.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
This is one thing that saddens me about this game. Sure in ""has"" multiplayer, but anyone can cheat/exploit to their heart's content. The Dev is correct in saying that people will always fing a way to cheat, but he uses that as an excuse not to plug the obvious holes. So if you're like me and want hard non-cheaty gameplay, only play with those who are like-minded, or better yet play solo. I'm the kind of player that loses interest if people are cheating. Without having the necessary tools to set permisions for what people are able to do on my server such as console commands or altering item recipes, I don't even consider this to be a multiplayer game.

[h1]The Dev[/h1]
The dev is the most accessible dev I've ever seen, but you could view this as a good or a bad thing. Other games where the devs rarely respond to players, if a player posts a suggestion on the forums they don't even know if the devs read it. This dev is active on the forum and will respond to suggestions. If your suggestion is to add a bunch of survival elements in and giant monsters for the player to get killed by, he's likely to say that that's not type of game this is. I've suggested several things and not all of them were received well, but one is in the game now. Armchair game design is what too many player think they're good at. If you make a suggestion, don't be so invested in it that you're offended when people disagree with you.

This game is being devoloped by one guy as his sole income. He's having to balance between people who tgink the game is too hard, and too easy. Many of the players who are unhappy with the game seem to be expecting a different genre (like survival) so they suggest things to make it fit into that genre better, and get mad when people tell them they're playing the game wrong and they're suggestions don't fit into a logistics game. They then write a negative review complaing that the dev was mean or something. He can be a bit blunt, he's not in PR, but writing negative reviews as ""payback"" makes it less likely new content can be released for free.

[h1]DLC[/h1]
There are 4 DLCs for this game, 3 are purely cosmetic, the last is a [b]very[/b] large expansion. Many people get upset seeing paid DLCs, but you should consider that he is actively working on [b]free[/b] patches for the game, he uses cosmetics DLCs to be able to afford to live. You don't have to buy them, but I did, the skins are cool :) I would rather keep supporting this game buy buying DLC than having no more patches with content, and that these DLCs are not pay-2-win and are strictly costmetic is commendable.

[h1]Patreon[/h1]
He also has a patreon, which I've seen some negetive comments about. I'm not a patreon because I'm on a fixed income, but I realized without it, the dev [b]Would[/b] have to abanded this game, call it a final version, and move on to another project. Not because he wants to, but because he has to make a living and a niche game like this simply doesn't sell enough copies. Patreons get access to a special skin, and unfinished game elements. Basically they get to beta test things that aren't even slated for the next patch (anyone can beta test the next patch)

[h1]Summary[/h1]
I would highly recommend Fortresscraft evolved [B]IF[/b] you like logistics games. If you only want to play survival games or adventure shooter games you will be disappointed. This is a very good game in a very niche genre. I feel people are writing negative review because they want this game to be something it was never meant to be.",1517566850,1525772527,True,39,1,0.717927813529968262,0,False,False,False,False,,,

So. Nice to meet you. I’m a computer engineer as I’m certain many of the other people interested in this game are. On a professional level this is a fun game.

If you’ve played Factorio, you’re familiar with the genre. You’ve crashed on an alien planet. You need to set up infrastructure to provide power to your base, explore to search for minerals, harvest those minerals and set up a pipeline to automate manufacturing of various and sundry things to build bigger and better things to go out and kill the bad things that don’t like you building the things.

FC:E takes this formula and puts it into 3 dimensions. There are a few twists – rather than a singular power grid, FC:E has point to point power connections. I.E. you transmit all power by laser. The logistics networking happens in straight lines and 90 degree angles as well. At different parts of the map there are different twists to how you have to handle your power and logistics networking. 

For example, at a certain depth if you try to use conveyer belts, enemies will spawn on the conveyers that will ‘eat’ the items on them and feed them to a larger creature that will grow VERY hard blocks up toward your base, eventually smothering it if you continue to feed it. These blocks, hardened resin, are later a resource and feeding things off of a conveyer to the enemies makes it renewable.

One of the advantages FC:E has over Factorio and Minecraft modpacks is its pacing. There’s usually something to do, but manufacturing is very slow and the different things you need to optimally manufacture different items are difficult to get, making a first playthrough suboptimal and allowing plenty of time to experiment with the technologies as you progress. This is in stark contrast to Minecraft modpacks that drop an absolutely overwhelming amount of stuff on players immediately upon launch.

One of the disadvantages FC:E has versus Factorio and Minecraft is its scaling. With Factorio having tens of thousands of things happening at once was possible, and with Minecraft modpacks it was possible to get very large, very complex factories set up. FC:E limits this somewhat. 

Now, that’s just my perspective – my last Factorio game had literally 30 trains running to keep my mid-game base pumping. FC:E does scale up, it does allow for automating your factories, and it’s got a ton to design – in many cases the designs are more complicated than vanilla Factorio because FC:E is 3D.

On a professional level, I’ve enjoyed figuring out how FC:E works. The modding community is fun to talk to, and it’s been interesting to me to find bugs in the game. One of the goofiest bugs I experienced happened when I was trying to stay within my bandwidth cap. For some reason FC:E was taking up 10+ Mbps! It turned out that the railcarts were sending a deluge of updates, most of it with empty data. My friend and I got around it by using OpenVPN’s lzo compression. Oh well. It happens. It’s fixed in the latest patch.

Speaking of patches, the latest patch took 11 months to come out because the developer ended up in a massive wreck. There are some people being snarky over this, but seriously. I’ve not interacted with the guy directly, but based on what I’ve seen in this game he puts a helluva lot of thought and care into its design. It’s one of the most stable factory sandbox games I’ve ever played and there is a ton to do in it.

He has a Patreon page so that he can continue developing it. I’m not subscribed to it. The Patreon addons have so far been visual only. He isn’t trying to get you to dump time and money into the game to try to foster a sense of pride and accomplishment, and the DLC he’s added so far is really awesome.

If you’re like me and like factory sandbox games that are just complex enough that you don’t solve them outright with pencil and paper, FC:E is one of them. It’s in the same genre as Factorio and Technic Pack/Feed the Beast/et al.

-The game has only has two modes, both are pretty sandboxy, one sandbox creative and one survival; 

-In survival nothing actually come after the player except sporadic camobot that can one shot you.

-Dev state ""my idea of difficulty is not sending random thing's after the player to kill them"" but aformentioned camobots fit that bill and are the only implemented thing that goes after the player and only in some places/depth.

+Setting up turrets and supply chain is cool!

-Ennemies ignores buildings(and player) and go directly for core building.

+About 10% as good/deep/content as Factorio for automation/base building, mixed in 3D makes for cool concept on paper.

-Very limited player progression, the steward bot following you is cool, but player upgrades are for the most parts to bypass artificial milestones ""Craft this upgrade or you will die near instantly when you enter a certain depth even tho the block right next to is safe"".

-Prognosis/Worth a Buy? Imo this game should still be in Early Access;

FCE has very limited future growth potential. If you feel the game in it's current stage is just the thing for you, then knock yourself out. 

I can confidently say if pointless sandbox is your thing, you will really like it.

As far as people complaining about needing to pay for the new upcoming content (through patreon or future DLC) I really don't understand why they expect to keep getting new stuff for free on a game that is two years old.  The base game alone has at least a hundred hours of play time (I still haven't charged the orbital transmitter, but I decided to restart my world 3 times now), and the Frozen Factory DLC adds dozens more.  The recent patch had massive QoL and performance improvments (seriously, look at the patch notes: http://steamcommunity.com/games/254200/announcements/detail/1569933508738753010) that are completely free to everyone.

No because what this game can be (and there is much that can be), but for the game it is now or was one year ago.
The experince of exploration, the set up of the automatic suply and production lines, the exhilaration the first time a worm kills you... it is something really special.
It is not Factorio but you automate things (all the things if you care to), it is not minecraft but you build and explore the deepest, darkest, coldest receses of a really alien wold.

The goal is to create a sustainable source, advance to the next stage, and explore. 

The game is great if you like to build factories and love leisurely designing processes, especially when playing with friends, however I felt the threat factor for enemies and even the boss didnt really feel that dangerous or... smart for that matter. I would love the option for a more dangerous gameplay that didnt just target your main base or steal your energy, but would attack different portions of your base.

Another portion I liked but wish there was more focus on would be the complexity of automation. I love that you have to connect chains like creating PCB's, but theres not a whole lot of depth between the materials or utilities for advancing research. For instance, research for the most part only needs certain experimental pods, if you make all of them, nothing further is needed other than large numbers of them. Would love to see some complexity added to the process, bigger factories, more demand, count me in.

What this game is: 
The first (released before Factorio) fully realized survival factory game.  It is an extension of Minecraft Automation mods but it is the first that put them all in a game that stands alone.  This game is about exploiting resources, automating your base, exploring new areas, moving up a tech tree, continuing to fine tune your aotomation, build up defenses, charge our orbital laser, and destroy the source of the bugs.  Then there is an entire DLC that adds an entirely new threat of a giant frozen blob monster underground.  

The bugs that attack your base are just an indicator of how much big your base is - the larger the base the more bugs attack.  Wehn you start charging your laser A LOT more bugs come and then you have to keep them off your CPU or you lose all the progress on your laser.  

The first time you paly it your base will be crap, the second time you play it your base will be better, the third time you can start shaving time off your charge time and THEN you get the DLC and there is even more to do.  

The game runs very good, looks great, has mods, and voxel based.  

People are just thrown off beause the bugs look stupid - and they do look dumb - but they are simply there to test your base efficiency.  The Cryo blob underground is a better enemy and mechanic but the surface bugs serve there purpose.  

Very few people actually have completed this game compared to how many people own it.  It is a VERY long learning curve but that is what makes it rewarding.  Eventually you will see that processes that used to take hours in your old base can be completed faster with some more advanced automation, larger drills, and a better setup.  

Eventually you can speed run the lasers.  

There are videos on Youtube of people who actually know how to play this game.  

Do not listen to the reviews by people who do not really know how to play this game - even if they have over hundred hours ... tihs game is very complex and satisfying.  

And i forgot to mention the alien blob that grows around you called resin - it is an organic obstacle that consumes your base.  No other factory typr game has these environmental challenges.  Also the game has some very advanced spelunking.  

Factorio and Satisfactory both came after this game.  Factorio just left early access and they put in a Spidertron in the game.... completely ripped off of Fortresscraft,   absolutely.  Spider bot has been in this game for YEARS and is customizable and 3D.  

Seriously ... Fortesscraft is a direct evolution from Minecraft Mods ... everything else falls short. 

Also it was made by ONE GUY who worked on it for years.  He has since moved on to other games but he still hovers around the forums and he has stated that the game is finished (and it is finished).  It is also cheaper than both Satisfactory and Factorio and runs better.",1516075456,1597425903,True,12,2,0.438198715448379517,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I like it, you may, you may not.

FCE is a very 'niche' sort of game, I think it will appeal very strongly to a small number of us who like efficiency and optimisation but not so much to those that like fast paced exploration and progression, if you didn't enjoy Minecraft or Factorio or even sandboxes in general then I would not recommend.

In a single line, I would describe it as Minecraft with Buildcraft/Tekkit built in and ready to roll.

The game is heavily focused on automation, with a side of combat and exploration. Its up to you whether you enjoy these things.
The tech tree is massive, there are multiple tiers with a huge multitude of machines and items to construct and the best part (for me) is you can near on 100% automate everything! For an example: you need to mix 2 elements to create a new one, sure you can go build the machine required and mine and transport and insert the elements and wait around..... 
OR!
You can set up and automatic mining system underground, that uses your auto transport system to bring it up, which then feeds into your auto refining system, THEN it feeds the elements in and all you have to do is reap the rewards at the end :) 

Remember when you spent hours (or still do!) in Minecraft building that huge storage system and then have problems with redstone interaction and sort of wish that there was a block that would just do the damn job for you? Look no further, in FCE, there is a machine for everything!

I see the game is still being patched and Dev has plans for even more content, I can't see this project being abandoned any time soon and even if it does and I stopped playing today, I feel like I would have had my moneys worth.
I would also like to mention that the game runs very nicely with the Unity Engine :)",1516070799,1516070799,True,5,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ich habe damals FortressCraft Evolved für 13,99 EUR in einem Sale gekauft. Fernab von DLCs und modifizierter Grafik.  Schon in dieser Zeit, hat FortressCraft Evolved bewiesen, dass Early Access nicht immer teuer sein muß und sehr nützlich sein kann.

Anders gesagt, in diesen Zeit möchte jeder so wenig Geld wie möglich für ein Spiel zahlen.  Auch ich!  Wenn ich aber ehrlich bin, habe ich nie verstanden wieso FCE so günstig im Preis verkauft wurde.  Daher stell ich Dir nun die Frage ""Wann hast du mal ein Spiel gekauft und dich gewundert warum es so günstigt ausserhalb eines Sales ist?""

Wer wirklich dieses Spiel mehr als 40 Stunden gespielt hat, der kann nur bestätigen das man für diesen Preis eine Menge und ich meine wirklich eine Menge an Content, Innovation, Ideenreichtum, Abwechslung und viele Features erhält. 

FortressCraft Eveolved gehört zu den Spielen, die ich als Sandbox bezeichnen möchte. Denn den Spielverlauf schreibst du dir als Spieler selbst vor nicht aber das Spiel. Es gibt kein Richtig oder Falsch. Du könntest dieses Spiel 100 mal neu Anfangen oder starten, von der Strategie her wird es sich immer anders spielen obwohl der Weg immer gleich ist.

Es gibt nur eine Hand voller Spiele auf Steam für die ich eine uneingeschränkte Kaufempfehlung aussprechen würde. Aber FCE gehört zu 100% zu dieser Auslese. Wenn es da draussen Spieler gibt die auf der Suche nach einem tollen Spiel sind, und nicht ein Spiel direkt abstempeln nur weil es in Voxelstyle programmiert wurde, dem laßt gesagt sein ihr macht keinen Fehler mit diesem Spiel.

Ich glaube auch, dass dieses Spiel etwas für dich sein wird, wenn du dieses Review bis hierhin gelesen hast. Denn es zeigt ganz Klar dein Interesse an diesem Spiel. Und ja, du kannst es bedenkenlos kaufen!

Ich würde gerne neben dem Spiel etwas über die Entwickler schreiben.  Leider oder zum Glück muß ich sagen habe ich nur wenig Entwickler hier auf Steam erlebt die etliche Stunden mit der Community chatten. Ich selbst habe zig Stunden im Prtivatchat mit DJARCAS verbracht der mir bei Problemen oder gar bei Tipps zur Seite stand.

Auch der Discord zu diesem Spiel von den Entwicklern ist zu empfehlen. Denn dort bekommt man fast in Echtzeit Support rund um die Uhr. Und ja die Entwickler schreiben Euch persönlich an und lauschen eueren Fragen.

Mit dem DLC ""Frozen Factory"" erhält man meiner Meinung nach fast nochmal ein weiteres Spiel.  Bis heute habe ich das Spiel auch wie oben genannt nach 600 Stunden nicht geschafft durchzuspielen.  Das liegt aber eher an mir und der Unmenge an Content was dieses Spiel bietet. 

Darüber hinaus bin ich mir ziemlich sicher, dass ich mindestens im Jahr 2018 noch weitere 600 Stunden in das Spiel investieren werden. Und ja, sogar wieder Neu anfangen möchte weil es doch vielleicht einen lukrativieren Weg gibt Erze zu transportieren und komplexe Firmenanlagen und Maschinen zu bauen.

Entschuldigung das ich erst jetzt zum Ende des Review eigentlich erwähnen kann was FCE ist. Aber es gibt soviele Dinge die man positiv hervor heben könnte das man nicht weiss wie man es glaubhaft formulieren kann.

Dieses Spiel bietet Unmengen an Möglcihkeiten Maschinen, Transportwege, Sortieranlagen, und Erze zu verarbeiten, zu veredeln, sich Gedanken darum zu machen wo man die nächsten Forschungspunkt investieren sollte und gleichzeitig eine Art Tower-Defense bietet, weil m,an wieder vergessen hat Punkte in Raketen und Abwehr zu investieren weil man lieber fliegende Drohne erforschen wollte die für Euch den Loot einsammeln. 

Mit dem Grafik-Update und Umstellung auf DX 11 hat meiner Meinung nach FCE nochmal an Qualität hinzu gewonnen. Es sieht noch hübscher aus.  Es läuft flüssig und unterstützt Windows 10. 

Was mich ein wenig traurig stimmt, ist die Tatsache, das ich Fortresscraft Eveolved jetzt im Weihnachtssale für unter 10,00 EUR gesehen habe. Für uns Kunden perfekt jedoch für Entickler kaum tragbar. Ich glaube die Spieler die FCE gespielt haben verstehen meine Aussage. Ich wünschte mir jedenfalls das es mehr Entwickler wie DJArcas und Team gibt die Innovation und neue Ideen in die Spieleentwicklung bringen.

Vielen Dank für dieses tolle Spiel!

EA Games has similar business practices and thats saying something. Finally the dev is incapable of accepting criticism, and went so far as defending his right to sell you a game at 10% completion noting that he was under ""No Obligation"" to deliver a complete game at any point. And then he whines about his ""income situation"" while riding motorcycles at 300KPH on the highway. Its just the gift that keeps on giving... not to mention the ""white knights"" that defend him day and night, they probably think that Jessica Nigris Chest is real too !

Update: After doing some research (source http://steamspy.com/app/254200) this game has sold a total of 118527 copies which at the base game price of 12.99 would have (before steams piece of the pie) have brought in 1.5million USD. Ill be conservative and deduce that after taxes and giving platforms etc a piece of the pie only 1 Million dollars are left over. If you REALLY believe the dev that he has an income issue, you need to seek Psychiatric Medical attention IMMIDIATELY. If you brought in 1 Million bucks and whine about "" income"" and ""ill work on what brings me money"" your just a petulant gasbag thats out for cash. EA 2.0

UPDATE2: Patch has been released after 10 MONTHS of time, Dev talks about high hopes for next patch, ill be holding my breath about actually seeing it before the end of 2018. At current still cannot find a reason to change the review to positive

Update 3: Dev marked my post as ""off topic"" Steam Support has deemed it to be On Topic and removed the block to review updates, just a further supporting statement to the juvenile behavior of this dev

Update 4: In his next pathetic attempt to get the post removed the dev marked it as ""abusive"". Steam moderators reviewed it and deemed it not abusive and reopened the post

Update 5: The Dev continues to emphasize that his updates are ""free"", generally Video Game devs take it with pride that they deliver a full, bug free, complete game when everything is said and done, its what they charge money for. I should not pay for a product and then have to thank over and over for it to just function with the content as ADVERTISED. Get off your high horse, grow up, and just make the game, you arent special for doing what you advertised in the first place to get paid.

Update 6: Game is now ""complete"" with the release of another PAID DLC. Dev continues to sit on his high horse discussing the volume of praise he deserves for all the FREE UPDATES. I have never in all the years i have played video games ever seen a dev wish for praise when UPDATING his game. No i see some DEVs with a PASSION for their games wanting to deliver the most top notch product they possibly can. 

STAY AWAY from this DEV
STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME
If you have the game and it is still within steam refund policy? REFUND IT

YOU. HAVE. BEEN. WARNED.

FINAL UPDATE: So this guy decided to call it quits and move on... you boys want to know how a REAL 1 man Indy dev that deserves our money and our time sounds ? Ladies and gentlemen i give you the dev of the game Rise to Ruins and his statement for his game going 1.0.

""The Road to Release 1, leaving Early Access, and the future of Rise to Ruins.
FEB 24 @ 12:41AM	- RAYVOLUTION
Greetings fellow deities,

Rise to Ruins is planning to launch out of Early Access this year. Release 1 will be a huge milestone for Rise to Ruins' nearly 5 year development cycle! I've put a ton of work into this game, and I'm proud to finally see it complete enough I can call it a ""ready"" in 2019.

But here's the thing; Development won't end. I have no intention on stopping development once the game leaves Early Access, nor do I plan to stop anytime soon. As long as you are all here supporting my work, I will be here to support it too. After Release 1 expect plenty of additional content over, hopefully, years of future development.

Before release, I have a few more major patches planned, one of the most important ones being a complete redesign of the save system that will hopefully nearly eliminate your saves becoming ""obsolete"" and having to reset your progress. As for content, I am planning a bio, hygiene, trash, fishing, hunting, and cooking systems, as well as workshop support for custom skirmish maps and a fundamental redesign of the corruption system before release. All of these will likely span 3-4 major patches throughout the year, starting with InDev 33, introducing the new save system.

As for post release content, I'm still planning a procedural map generator, more holy/religion things, bridges, building walls on water, more equipment, spells, monsters, per-map difficulty/weather, more goals, perks and a ton of other content I couldn't even begin to list out in a single post. So while the game is going to be released this year, it'll never be done. There's always more to add, and I'll be here to add it.

For the nitty gritty business side of things, roughly a month prior to release, Rise to Ruins will increase it's price and the standard 50% discount price will change to 33%. Although what that price will be is still somewhat up in the air, and I'd love to hear your feedback down in the comments what you think the price should be.

I thank all of you that have stuck with this long journey, working alone has been both an overwhelming challenge and very rewarding, I am grateful for all of your support all along the way.

It can be a bit grindy but not as in ""ok, now I have to wait 2h for sth"" but rather ""I have to expand my production/transportation otherwise I'll have to wait 2h for sth'... so.. just don't be lazy and then complain :P

pros:
- it's hard to find a game which will give you more bang for your buck and there is no denying that. it has loooong hours of content
- it has rly nice graphics, much better than your average voxel game
- it nicely fills the gap between factiorio and all those voxel-based games like MC and alike.
- there is always sth to do/to improve, you never run out of tasks to be done
- there are goals to achive - it's not just a sandbox
- there is an active discord community where you can ask anything game related and you WILL get an answer
- the developer is still fixing/polishing stuff - last bug I reported got fixed in few hours

cons:
- there are few minor bugs here and there (nothing game breaking!) but that's to be expected from a game made by one person. At some point you just have to decide how to spend your development time - fixing minor glitches or adding new content or maybe just playtesting.. there is only so much that can be done by 1 person in 24h
- not rly a 'con' but it requires a decent computer to run endgame. Not just graphics but CPU too. You need a big base with tons of machines, lot of dynamic stuff and that just needs a lot of computing power - there is no way around it, so if you have a potato PC.. well... set the graphics to minimum and hope for the best :)",1514555467,1514555467,True,21,0,0.579972207546234131,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have a hard time stopping when I have real life responsibilities to handle.  It's a little rough around the edges as one might expect from an early access game still very much in development.  If you can't handle quirks, bugs and glitches, you might want to wait just a bit longer for the next release.  It's due to drop any day.

Game play is fun and can be fast or slow paced depending on how aggressive you want to be.  If you like exploring, the world is endless.  If you like logistics there are always a million things going on and it helps to be organized.  It's easy to get side tracked with a new task when you are trying to work on another.  If you like puzzles, try designing a new system to fabricate subcomponents and then assemble them into a final product.  I am definitely addicted to all aspects and I’m excited to see what comes in future releases, not only in game play but also stability and performance increases.  

I've read some posts about the dev being rude or whatever, I suppose he might come off that way to people who don't know how to provide actual useable feedback or can't put together a coherent thought.  I, for one, laugh when I read the dumb stuff some of these people get so bent out of shape over.  Oh, you don't understand what a ping is, how to troubleshoot latency, what a switch or router is?  Well WTF dude?  Why are you trying to run a server and then complaining when you don't understand the basic troubleshooting steps to resolve it?  Experiencing performance problems? If you’ve got an old clunker of a system, don’t expect a smooth running game, especially one in early dev that’s not optimized for old junk.

Enough raving about how great this is and ranting about lamers who wanna be gamers.  I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes a challenge and can deal with a diamond in the rough.

The game isn't without flaws, but as a programmer I have immense respect for the developer. Whether or not you can perservere to complete the game is up to you, the whole game is a reflection of you. I don't think everyone can beat the game, its actually hard to win. I've seen different people play and engineer different solutions to the problems and tackle technology in a different order. The game has a steep learning curve, and its honestly got a lot of brutal mechanics - but I love that. There are also places where the game is generous, like giving you one of the sweetest grappling hooks ever from the start of the game, or the amazing build gun that I would love to port into minecraft. 

More than anything its got a cohesive theme and rich universe. Whether clearing out working space with a giant laser or building crazy generator setup or turret array to fight the buggers, each project is rewarding and lets you choose you own path to success.

No other game has the ability to make my brain run at 100% (Except for Hex Cells, but that's totally different). Figuring out how to build a machine just right, or how to route ores/bars back to your base and organize them efficiently, or a thousand other things are just plain rewarding.

Do you like Tekkit/FTB-Packs and other ""tech"" focused modpacks for Minecraft?
Did you enjoy the heck out of Factorio - but wish it would've been made in a 3D engine?

Look no further.

Yes. - The 2D and some of the 3D artwork do need some love. Its colorful, it's flashy.
But neither of these ""niche-discover-your-inner-engineer-games"" focus on graphics. Why would they?
And boi.. once you get past the initial learning curve you're in for a real treat.

You mine gazillion of ores - to process them into stuff manually to build equipment/machines that does it automatically - to build machines that do it faster, better and more reliably. You feel like managing a huge mining operation & an industrial factory at the same time. All that while defending your base against critters from outter space and paying attention to the status of your energy generation, logistic systems and your own survival. And so much more.

Invite friends to play Co-op for ultimate time-melting fun.

Buying this is a no brainer if you like these kinds of games, imo.
And even if there is a small bug here and there... Jesus.

The voxel art style, rather than enjoyable, helps demonstrate why Minecraft and similar-styled games employ a better use of low-res texture while keeping a solid player engagement. The mid-quality textures most blocks display just serve to make them look awkward in the finished product. Maybe I'm not playing with the right skin, or maybe I should set my graphics card lower, but coupled with a resulting low fps (again, maybe my fault, going on a 3GB GPU) it feels poorly-implemented as of its current stage in the development. 

The movement feels clunky. There's no way around it. When you place an object, highlighting the box that object was placed in automatically targets that object, which I understand the idea behind, but the results are a lot of clumsily-destroyed objects thinking I had nothing impeding my way to the ore I was facing. The auto-jump feature also feels very thrown-together, as the awkward textures and automatically-ascending controls make it feel very difficult to navigate an area properly.

The UI is overcrowded. Even after disabling alerts on certain machine parts, you've got your item bar, you've got your tutorial goals/missions, you've got a box that will forever tell you about the item you've highlighted in your item bar (why?), your health window, your power/temperature/biohazard window. These have already shrunk the screen, and made things feel VERY cluttered.

The crafting just feels lackluster, and needlessly complex. I could compare this to having been given a few wooden pallets and a decently-sized toolbelt and being given the instructions ""Go make a chair out of these"". You've got the wood and tools, but it's just. not. happening. Things are explained poorly, and at inopportune times (I didn't even know I could manually mine until I'd automated my copper and tin!). Some things, which should be touched on more thoroughly, are left entirely unapproached. Also, why does my crafting station have to say ""Crafting"" like a Portal Turret every time I manually craft something? The first time was cute, but it wore out its welcome soon after.

Fianlly, why does FCE get a free pass for releasing DLC while still in Early Access, while ARK was torn to shreds? I'm not excusing ARK, I'm putting the onus on this game to defend itself for demanding more money for additional content toward a game that isn't even finished.

I've thrown a lot of shade, but please let me say this: I love the idea behind this game. Factorio and Minecraft are both gems, and I can see the inspiration FortressCraft draws from them. However, it takes all the pieces that shouldn't mesh together, and tries it anyway. It takes the laissez faire-style introduction that Minecraft employs, while utilizing similar graphical and resource-management system like Factorio. These don't go well together.

I'd love to see a special tutorial world, where the player has the chance to explore the possibilities more naturally, because there are a LOT of them. Give us a world where we can explore mining, gathering, resource-management, and automation in an organic setting, allowing for goals on multiple fronts working in tandem with one another. I realize it's a challenge, asking for an entire scenario, but as it stands, the steep learning curve is REALLY putting me off from wanting to pick this game back up.",1511730285,1511730285,False,15,0,0.641165673732757568,2,True,False,False,False,,,

What progress me see it?
Well me can sure there are more bugs than previously.
First time placed elevator can you push above obstacles. As well as elevator can push you out from map border when you are below platform.
Still no progress with lights, when you place to many light sources some tiles will be bright to much.
There are more options in graphics but view/shadow distance render wasnt matter if game wasnt optimised.
Previously me never had it ""freezes"", now me had it from some time to some time, propably some data save.
Still weird looking thing, like conveyor belt on riddiculus angles, items on belt can go even if there are belt flipped upside down on roof this make slooped conveyor totally useless and wasting of resources.
In caves there are still really annoying noises (from crystals) with can be accumulated by others sources.
Controls are still bad. Plenty of shortscuts splitted around keyboard, where you must figure out by you self what to do.
l,f,n,m,x,c... and more the things what you would be able put into god damit mouse roller or somekind popup menu where you can do fast choice.

After so much time me not played, me cant even say game progressed even a little forward. At this rate game will be finished propably in 10 years, to that time we should have it even much more simmilar games.

Pros:
-Responsive building with a reach as far as you can see
-Pretty solid research system, could use a bit of work but it's a good system as is.
-Challenge for your logistical mind, having to figure out ratios and working out the best ways to bring around the resources you require and to properly process them.
-Works alright on moderate end pc's, not a lot of games you find that plays like this can run at a decent FPS, this game can.
-Slimes, always fun to kill
-Upgrade pretty much anything from your suit, tool/weapon, even your helper bot and defensive bot.
-Grappling hook, dont hate, you're just not skilled enough to use it propperly if you do. It's so much fun once you get the hang of using it, being able to fly around and swing about like you're spiderman but more badass.
-Depth. Holy hell can you go deep in this world. When you start on the surface, it's jaring to understand how deep the world is beneath your feet.
-Head mounted flashlight. You have no idea how needed one is when most of the game is played underground, and handheld light sources dont add much to the game. If you can see and can do stuff, that's fun, if you can only do either or, that's a hinderance. props for a head mounted light.
-Multiplayer through steam, always fun to set up a game with a friend.
-Build to me option. It's tedious to set down a row of 100 of something, making sure they're all pointed the right way, and you gotta do it one at a time. This game has the option to set one, walk the distance, and build off the first set block right up to you. Makes platforms, conveyor setups, and storage options much easier to set up.
-Modded support. Mods always make a game better, it expands on other people's ideas for the game and it gives the player more freedom to customize the game to their liking. The modding comunity is a bit lacking but what is there is a good start.

Cons:
-Development is a bit slow, but it's not abandoned from what I can see.
-Research as I mentioned is good but it can be improoved upon, if you dig straight down untill you die you can rack up a bunch of research easy. So while it can be easy to cheese, it also has the habbit of putting you in a standstill when you've reached as far down as you can go and you've scanned everything already.
-Combat needs work, the ability to have automated defenses is a neat part of the game, but when it comes to what you can do as a player, it tends to lack until you get further into the mid game and have better gear.
-Horrizontal variety. What I mean by this is you can find new stuff and biomes out in the distance, but once you've seen the first couple you've basically seen them all. It's basically a recolor of a prior aspect from a list of biome atributes.


I'm sure I've left stuff out, but regardless it's a fun game dispite it's shortcomings. I reccomend this for anyone who is a fan of minecraft with a factorio twist.

For multiplayer, just steer clear.
The game has some issues, i suspect its related to a slow or buggy send queue on the server.
You'll fairly linearly notice that it takes longer for each block you [the joiner] place become visible to you.

The host can see it, if you relog you can see it, but it takes longer and longer for every moment you're logged in, until *you* see it. The devs seems to brush it off as connection issues etc despite filing a fairly reproducible test case.

It's not an issue as you start up, but as your world grows, the joining client simply won't be able to catch up.
(Again, not connection related, even on a 1gbit lan this is the case, and low server cpu load)

If the dev(s) ever fixes the issue, feel free to comment on my review.

Its complicated and it has a lot of functionality, still there are not much bugs. Sometimes I have a minor visual bug and thats it! The game runs smooth, both by my old pc and my new one.

Lets start with the cons;
- The learning curve is very very hard in the beginning. Some of my friends quit this game in the first 10 hours because they did not understood how it worked. I was really happy I did not!!! But I came close. Expanding the tutorial seems for me the best option. What you want is to hold your new player by the hand until he needs to automate Iron. So automatin Tin/Copper should be in the tutorial.
- User interface is somewhat ugly. This is also a pro and a con. Because I am not complaining about the usability of the user interface, that one is fine. But I hope the developpers with take a closer look at the user interfaces of ROKH or Rust. And yes the current icons are fine.

- It is fun to build up things. 
- It all works good!

Great concept, but almost impossible to get to the late game unless you spend a lot of time on it. The game is all about automation, which is the part I love, but they dont tell you about the plants that grow on your conveyor system. The plants eat your resources and will choke out your industry if you dont handle them, which is cool, but very poorly implemented. The solutions to this problem include:

1. Build turrets to defend your conveyors (problem with this ""solution"" is that you have to supply all of those turrets and on long conveyors, this is a logistical nightmare and you end up spending hours building this defence system and waiting on resources  to build it rather than building more industry)

2. Get better tech so you dont have to use conveyors. (this is the most frustrating solution I have been told of. This means that you have to wander around the world searching for new materials to ""discover"" for hours just so you can have the appropriate tech, but then to use that tech you have to have mass amounts of resources that you cant supply because you have to automate your factory to have enough materials in a reasonable amount of time, but you couldnt automate because the plants stop you from doing that. It is a circle of defeat that takes far too many hours to get past.)

I spent 4 hours on this game after watching a couple hours of tutorials that must have been outdated because there were no plants in those tutorials. In those 4 hours, I accomplished almost nothing and my conveyor system is choked out and I cant build enough turrets in any reasonable amount of time.

Unlike MineCraft which you can typically tame within a couple of day-night cycles, this has a much more extensive tech progression system, forcing you deeper and deeper within the world of FC to find elusive materials to take that next major step.  Think 3D factorio and you won't be far off.

The survival part is fairly basic, just holding off waves of flying surface-dwelling creatures.  The hardest part about that is keeping your base sufficiently powered to keep the guns firing, easier said than done when your tech levels are low, but trivial later in the game.  The only threats in the deep are your stupidity if you fall too far, or run out of power and freeze to death in the dark.  There's no random mobs to contend with.  

The game is quite confusing and slow-going at the start, but that's part of the challenge too.  Keep a browser open to search for tips, some Wiki sites are very helpful.  I definitely recommend the workshop mods.

There's a lot that's difficult to understand as the game's own tutorial is somewhat basic, and even now i don't know how *everything* works, but I've gotten a gist and give some pointers for new players, as the in-game help menu is not ideal, and the wiki is *massively* out of date, from what I can tell:

Don't leave belts unattended (by yourself or a turret) underground. creatures will appear over them, they steal your resources (and besides that alone being a bad thing, this has additional negative effects in the form of hive growth.)

Attacks come from the four ""overminds"" *so far* they always seem to spawn at diagonals from the CPH in the world (you can find them yourself easily, they're *very* hard to miss, and you'll want some of the resources that spawn around them somewhat early on), so plan your defenses accordingly. Also leave some space between your defenses and the CPH, as enemies have ranged attacks too and will attack the core even while under fire.

Your personal crafting menu (""C"" by default) will allow you to craft more 100slot hoppers before you have iron by combining 2slot hoppers, this is resource inefficient, but useful at the very start.

Rooms! more than just a roof over your head: they act as a way of ""partitioning"" your base, and anything inside a room isn't rendered from the outside, and vice versa. this improves the performance quite a bit when things start to get a little cluttered, If you're having performance issues that get worse as you build, consider moving some of your setup into a room.

truth of it though is that this game had to be pulled from development so the dev could move on to new projects and continue to do that eating thing, and a *lot* of the dev's ideas never made it to fruition for this one... HOWEVER! they are working on a(nother) sequel it seems, by the name of ""FortressCraft: Phoenix"" (a rather fitting name). there's lots of info on the discord's pinned messages, if you can find a link to it.

Overall yes this game has a lot of major issues, like a lax tutorial and a somewhat messy UI, and as stated earlier a *lot* of stuff is difficult to understand. However the game has a certain charm to it, the way things aren't always a direct upgrade of others makes you consider carefully what to use for certain situations, the uniqueness of the vertically stacked world biomes, and the rather fun ways of dealing with problems with the tools you have make for a very fun experience in my opinion, and both the frozen factory and adventures pack DLC add sizeable amounts of content, though adventures is more about multiple playthroughs, and frozen factory is an additional chunk of content for *any* playthrough. there's a couple other DLCs, but those are the main ones for content as far as I can tell, having only gotten into this game recently.

This game is great for someone who likes problem solving on a 3D level to reach a end goal. There is so much to think of just because it is 3D and not a top down.

Having ANY enemies gives you a goal to survive and maintain to play the game.

[b]Preface[/b]

When I first started playing this game, I was annoyed by the notifications. They wouldn't stop blinking and making noise, telling me to do various things that frankly, I didn't care about handling right at that moment. It drove me up the wall to be reminded, once every second, for hours at a time, that I would ""Build a Spiderbot Base"" or whatever. Frankly, it's a horrible implementation of an otherwise OK idea. Because of these notifications, I quit playing the game and gave it a negative review out of frustration.

I eventually came back to the game and ran the console command to disable the notifications [i]/missions[/i]. This command must be run every time you start the game, and it disables ALL notifications, even helpful ones, but it solved the annoying beeping and let me enjoy the game.


[b]The Good[/b]
[list]
[*] The game has ok in-game documentation
[*] The documentation includes a build-in recipe guide (think NEI / JEI from minecraft), so you can figure out what a material is used for
[*] The machines look pretty cool. Stampers have animation of physically crushing a metal bar into a plate, for example
[*] Good array of world generation options, to allow people to tweak the difficulty to their liking.
[*] Nice amount of content
[*] The cave terrain gen is pretty nice. There are some absolutely huge cave systems
[/list]

[b]The Not-so-good[/b]
[list]
[*] The surface terrain gen is bland. It's a series of hills and mountains, populated with various rocks, plants, and 'trees', which is ok, but the colors are wild and ugly. Purple, orange, yellow, green, all blending together as you travel around.
[*] The grappling hook is awkward to use. I can't really explain how awkward it is, but it has all sorts of little nonsensical quirks which make it not reliable when you need it.
[*] The in-game options menu is quite lacking. A single volume slider, for example.
[*] No ladders! It's kinda hard to travel vertically in this game sometimes, which is odd, since it's a game all about digging deep and extracting the riches of the planet. There is an elevator lift, which works pretty good, if it weren't for...
[/list]

[b]The Bad[/b]
[list]
[*]Arbitrary gameplay restrictions! 
[*] The grappling hook doesn't function properly from depth 200m to 280m, or from 450m to 650m. This is not a bug, it's intended, but not explained! Everywhere else in the game, the hook has no cooldown, and can be used effectively to slow downward descent in a vertical shaft. However, between these depths, it can only be fired once every 5 seconds, leading to a swift demise if you were counting on it to slow you from smashing into the ground. As mentioned in the above, this makes building an elevator lift a real chore. Excavate out a shaft (using the machine that does specifically this), come back later when it's finished, and plop in your elevator! ... except, you need to place the elevator at the bottom of the shaft, and you can't GET to the bottom of the shaft, because your grappling hook stops working partway down the shaft, and you just fall to your death. Why? Who knows!
[*] Coal-burning power generators don't work below the surface, due to 'lack of oxygen'. This forces you to place your base on the surface of the planet, which is ugly.
[*] Smelters don't work underground either! According to the forums I've read, this was a balance concern, because the developer thinks it's imbalanced to smelt ores right outside the mining operation, and therefore, nobody is allowed to place smelters underground! It makes no sense and basically forces the player to build everything on the surface.
[/list]

In my playthrough so far, this led to a lot of frustration. I would expect that if something works, it continues to work as I go onwards. I understand conveyor belts are not very efficient, but if i wanted to scale up and use dozens of them in parallel, I would think this would work! And it does, until you reach depth 200, then it stops working because it's too cold. Brr. Ok, what about these 'tubes' I've heard so much about in the crafting menu, that specifically advertise ""not effected by cold'? Oh, I can't build them till much later. I guess I have to use the one and only thing that works, the CARGO LIFT! Granted, the cargo lift is pretty cool, but why is it the only option available to me? I won't go into further nitpicky specifics about the game, but it's definitely got it's problems.

All in all, I would say this game is OK. Just remember to turn off the popup notifications using the [i]/missions[/i] command every time you launch the game, and it can be fun!

HOLY SHIT, SHUT UP! I'm still new to this game, why is there this extremely annoying sound effect playing once every second? It's like, ""GEE, I HAVEN'T MINED ANY ORE IN A MINUTE, I WONDER IF I NEED A REMINDER EVERY 1 SECOND TO ALERT ME THAT I AM STILL NOT MINING ANY ORE?""

Fortresscraft says ""Yes We Do""!

UPDATE:
Trying the game again, I decided to progress less while I explore around my crash site, figuring maybe I had done too much building and inadvertantly triggered state where I receive these messages. Upon completing the tutorial segment within the force field, I immediately went exploring around to find things to scan, etc. Then this happened:

Updates sometimes involve balance changes. This is great as it adjusts progression to account for new features and mechanics, but may change how old bases work on new versions. Balance changes are intended to be used from start to finish, and when played as such you shouldn't ever notice. Aside from having to adjust old setups like this, older saves are forward compatible in my experience. There are technical workarounds which take around 10 minutes for using old balance with new features if you want to update, but don't like the balance changes.

Most negative reviews are indev problems from people unwilling to use existing workarounds, as the game is still in development.

I had originally reviewed this game negatively a few years ago, which as the developer DJArcas clearly pointed out in his response:

[b][i] Review marked game as quote 'unplayable' 9 months ago. A quick peek, 9 months later, shows : ""Not Recommended - 33.3 hrs last two weeks / 313.3 hrs on record""

Perhaps time to update the review, given that you're still playing it, some 9 months later? [/i][/b]

I found the game unplayable.

By the way, for every other review/discussion that points out the developer is being condescending or an asshole, I think that comment takes first place. I'm an asshole to though so I respect it.

I didn't notice that comment until well after it was posted, and I had already stopped playing by the time I read it, so I didn't feel like bringing it up, but now that I tried giving this game another go, I feel like I should address it as I ""revise my review"". Yes, I did continue playing after saying the game was unplayable, because I was playing the game with mods that actually made the game enjoyable, and while not everyone does this with the games they play, I only review games based on the vanilla game, because none of the work the modding community does is rewarded when the game is sold, and it promotes developers (not necessarily DJArcas) to lazily release unfinished games and let the community fix it for free.

That being said, most of the mods I used are no longer supported and cause issues, and quite honestly the base game still lacks anything to keep me involved for the lengths of time I used to play it, and as many people have claimed and I want to reafirm for anyone trying to purchase this game, this game is [u] NOT[/u] complete. 

But I hear you say, wait. It has some functioning mechanics, it has an end goal even without DLC, theres stuff to do. Yes, thats true. You can play the game. But its not complete. If anything its even more ""early access"" than what I was referring to in my original post because now there are even more ideas, mechanics, and items that are implemented that are not polished, not balanced, or in same cases not even really usable.

[h1] Here are a few examples of why it feels incomplete: [/h1]
-My personal favorite, the fact that the glow tubes still drop tree trunks (the game had trees once), which you can place and it clearly looks nothing like the glow tube.
-ARTHER, a flying robot with hands and a potentially useful light, is nothing more than a glorified battery that yells at you, and serves no purpose other than being extra power or the very brief time you have him operate a turret (which i never actually got to fire at anything consistently).
-The headlamp draws so much power than its basically useless for anything other than lategame, after its upgraded and you have Arther with 2k power.
-Glowsticks, a way to see, generate smoke, blinding your view. (I think my mod to fix this still works so if they don't anymore normally lmk)
-The game still has no music, now, I actually looked into this further and saw DJArcas's post about legal problems and youtube takedowns, so while I don't fault the removal of the amazing Fortresscraft OST, the game benefited greatly from having it, and replacing it with actual music should have happened before it was ""finished"". And while the ambience is no longer nails on a chalkboard, its still not really pleasant to listen to for very long, especially by comparison.
-Slimes now are drawn towards your machines. They don't do anything to it, they just crowd around it, occassinally getting killed (or despawning).
-Scanning for new blocks is incredibly inconsistent, sometimes the scan will go away quickly, other times it will remain present on screen for over 20 seconds, blinding you with bright neon lights if you look in its direction.
-Most enemies completely ignore your player, and there is no real penalty to losing you CPH, theres no tension, or concern. You could never build a defense and still play the game. There is no true survival aspect. (fun fact: in one of the previous builds of the game, setting your mob difficulty to hard actually gave you the ""CPH doesn't heal/when it dies its game over"" condition from hardcore mode, but without the penalty for dying, this was my favorite way to play, but it was removed because it wasn't intentional. There used to be a mod to restore it, but it no longer works with the most recent build.)
-I still do not understand what purpose rooms serve. When they were introduced (which was the only time I used them) they didn't do anything significant enough to warrant blocking huge sections of your base, and to me always seemed like an excuse to increase performance due to the games poor optimization [i] (to be fair, this game has improved greatly in performance, even without rooms).[/i] (If rooms actually have a significant impact now, lmk.)
-Construction paste. Just why. Chevorns should be used almost immediately, and they used to be able to when they were just made from rough hewn rock, but now you will already have several holes in the ground to various machines by the time you get it that you have to mark with other things.
-Uranium, its been around since I started playing. It looked like it held such great promise. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe it was ever actually used in the base game.
-The UI and item management (moving/splitting/dropping/etc) is still very clunky.
-Many machines have distance limits, usually 64m, your character, on the other hand can collect and give power, collect and give items, and place and remove objects at any distance.
-the crashed ship still serves no purpose and is just an obstacle to your view.

I could go on, but this is already going to be too long.

Bottom line is simply that the game feels abandoned, whether or not the developer believes it to be that way, and its only kept alive by the community that takes the time to make something more out of a game that had amazing potential that, ultimately, wasn't reached. But I want to be clear, I am not trying to discredit the work that DJArcas has done. Its not easy to make a game, especially to the scale that is Fortresscraft, and its clear that he did put in a lot of effort, but set the game up to be more than what he was capable of doing given his life situations, leading to several players who followed the development feeling like their final product was incomplete. It just had that much wasted potential, and the path the developer took with the game is not one I enjoyed. I will however watch and see if anything comes of Fortresscraft: Phoenix, but I probably won't buy it as quickly as I did this one, if at all.

While this review will remain negative even while ""revised"" consider it less negative than before. To anyone wanting to play the game in a somewhat simlar way to how I found it most enjoyable, go into betas and choose patch 15, the one before they got rid of the actually nice planet environment. (This is also the patch that has alpha VR support, for those interested)

Atmosphere is very important to a game, and I really just want to make it clear that this:

おすすめしませんの評価が上にきていますが、レビュー日時にご注目を。
昔は確かにひどいゲームでしたが今はかなり改善され、全然問題なく工業化を堪能できます！ぶっちゃけ楽しい！
Factorioと比べてしまうと、多少霞んでしまう作品ではありますが、
それでもやはり３Dの工場を建設できる楽しみはこのゲームならではです。1280円の価値あります！

以下、Factorioとの違いを中心にレビューします。

＜醍醐味・頭を使うポイント＞
Factorioは製造ルート構築・大量生産化を工夫するゲームでしたが、
こちらのゲームは一次資源の確保を目的とした探索と物流構築が主軸になっています。
地中深くまで潜り、そこから工場中心部までのルート確保する点は３Dだからこその醍醐味ですし、いかに大量のアイテムを短時間で運ぶのかを豊富な物流手段の中から選択する事も重要な工夫要素となっています。

また、エネルギーの概念も大きく違います。
Factorioでは電柱さえ立っていればどんな設備でも動きますが、こちらはエネルギーを必要とする機器には一つずつエネルギー供給経路を構築する必要があります。
その上でエネルギー供給の太さも大きくかかわっており、大量にエネルギーを使う装置には、それ相応の経路や高級なエネルギー供給装置、照射レンズが必要になります。

＜自動化＞
Factorioに比べかなりシンプルです。というのも一次資源の種類が多く、また組立機や炉のコストがかなり高めな事もあり、工場の規模は控えめになります。
また研究ポッドは原材料の違いがポッドの違いでレシピは１通りになるため、複雑な回路を組む必要は一切ありません。Factorioでインサーター用の自動工程を組めた人なら、自動化という点ではこのゲームを最後まで余裕でクリアできます。
Factorioが複雑すぎた人にはちょうど良いレベルと評価もできますし
逆の人には物足りないと感じるかと思います。ここは個人次第かな。。

＜厳しい・難しい点＞
序盤のエネルギー情勢や収納環境は厳しめに設定されていて、
それを解消する為のリチウムや鉄の自動生産が行えるようになるまでが遊び始めの頃は一つの山場と言えるでしょう。
ここを克服しないと、実際の様々な自動化に行き着けないのが
このゲームの最初にして最大の(精神的な)初心者殺しだと思います。

また先述の通り、各組み立て機や機器の手間を含めたコストが一つ一つ高めな事と
大き目の設備が多いこともあり、設置・撤去の手間から、気軽に工場を拡張させる事は難しく、自分のやりたいこと・しないと行けないことをすぐに実践できる環境ではありません。

＜だからこそ・・＞
トライアンドエラーでスマートな工場の立ち上がり、拡張を行っていける環境を生み出した時の脳汁はやばいですｗ
私は３００時間オーバーで今でも遊ぼうと思えるほどドはまりしています。
自動化が好きな人にはもっと知ってもらいたい作品です！おすすめ！

＜ノーマルプレイのガイドについて＞
以前に比べ、ゲームの基幹部分は大幅に調整が入り、大分プレイしやすくなったようです。
とは言いつつも、相変わらずパッと見では分からないアイテム、仕様は散見されており
最初に結構な根拠を要求されることに変わりはないようです。
その一助となればと思いガイドを立ち上げてみました。

ご参考いただければ幸いです。

Yes, I know, 0.4 hours. Quick summery of my experience.

      So it looks pretty good. Seems to be getting decent reviews. So I figure why not. Bought the game and all of the expansions. Downloaded quickly, and were off!
      I have a tri-screen setup so I choose my screen resolution, best graphics ect. Soon as I get in my screen is very distorted, can't read anything. Turn's out this game defaults to my VR setup. No problem, I can't be the only one to experience this right? Pull up google and find this....


 DjArcas  [developer] Jan 22 @ 7:07pm 
 Yes, you press spacebar. Like what it tells you to. ;-)

 You can blame Valve for their horrendous implementation of the software, I'm afraid :-(

     Newsflash Dj, I can't read the fu*king screen. So now I am getting out the VR rig to get it out of the VR mode ""Which BTW don't work well at all."" I hit the spacebar and bam, fixed? No, no that did not fix it, it crashed the game. Disable overlay you say? No, no, that don't work either, also crashes the game. So Dj? what else we got?


DjArcas  [developer] Feb 2 @ 5:14am 
I can't provide separate execurables without literally shipping another copy of the game. Thanks Unity.

I can't provide a way to not load the VR stuf at runtime. Thanks Valve.

    Ok, ok, so you are telling me... Unplug my 1500 dollars in VR equipment to play? ""Wish you would have said this to begin with, 30 minutes later"".  Fine, fine, why not right? 
    OK, finally, I can read everything and the menu is up! Great! Finally! BAM I am in! Looks good, Sounds good. Pick my map, ""By the way, confusing, Why not one map with just the options?"" So in I go!.... Nope, crash.
    So again I ask professor Google and he tells me i'm screw*d. Yes, heavy issues on crashing riddling my search. So rather than read another hour of old post and pleas for help I go to the old tried and true, Backwards compatibility and full admin rights. Sure enough, It worked.
    So I go threw a cut scene and before you know it I am ready to play! Orrr.. not. At this point i'll keep it short, Absolutly confusing. Even the initial machine you first come into contact with is a massive cluster of boxes of different shapes and sizes. By the time the tutorial gave me one walkthrough I had no idea how to get back to the last function. Just absolute clusterf*ck. I know, I know ""You just want to refund it."" On the contrary I have no intent on any refunds. I can see this fella has created a game that has a lot to offer. I seen the work that has gone into this.I will definitly try it again when I have more time to read that 30 chapter help file. 

Here is what I would like to see. This only covers the first 30 minutes in game of course. 

1) Get that VR problem fixed. Other games have already done it, figure it out.
2) Fix that menu. No need for a multitude of redundant map options. One or two choices with options. It's a bit confusing
3) For god sake simplify that starting machine. Something as simple as labeled ""buttons"" would be a huge improvement. Possibly even seperate the funtions entirely? Many choices available to make that thing new user friendly. 

My crew and I was looking for a game to play over the long weekend. I was the tester. This is not the game we will play. Is it a bad game? I have no idea, after that mess I was just happy to get away from it. I will return to this on a later date and update my experience then.

The first time i played this game. I can't wait for an even more perfected game, like this one.

The mix between TD and crafting is epic. But to be honest, the TD part in not at all balanced or well made. What had me hooked was the fact that i could build fully automatic assembly lines from the bowels of earth, and all the way to the surface. To pump out ingots and materials i needed to build even larger assembly lines. With options like building fully automatic mibecarts and elevators, to transport everything around my base. from coal to the burners to get power. To copper that gets turned in to electronics, and turrets. I love almost everything about the game.

A big plus is also the miner gun. Almost all games gives you a some kind of mining pivk, and have you go at it 1 stone at a time. But in this game, i have litteraly been cutting down whole mountains, and not having to move at all.
And if that was not enough, i could move from one end of the map, all the way to the farthest object i can see in the horison. With the ingame grappling hook. So movement and mining is not an issue. Just having pure fun with building, and protecting the base from swarms of baddies.

Gameplay Pros:
- The game provides a ton of options for building the automated mining operation of your dreams, and poses any number of real time logistical puzzles for you to solve. If you enjoy design based problem solving of that sort, this is a great game for you.
- Spelunking in the treacherous underworld beneath your base is very enjoyable, with just enough light to make the occasional monster proximity sound very creepy. Expect to do some twitch spins when you hear something sneaking way too close behind you in the ice layer.
- The grappling hook is a blast, except when it murders you by failing in the ice layer.
- The smart help system is a great innovation that should be copied throughout the genre. It considers what you are looking at on the screen when you hit H and sorts your list accordingly. Simple. Genius.

Gameplay Cons:
- The core defense system is very, very primitive, to the point where it just seems tacked on. The only base attacker is a wasp swarm. Not weird alien wasps with tentacles or horns in weird places, they're just wasps. Everything else in this setting is alien and unsettling, then you get attacked by something you have killed in your back yard with a can of RAID. (To be fair, the end game wave is more alien looking, but that is hundreds of hours in for most players, after the normal wasps have already ruined the immersion.)
- The wasps only vary in size and HP. They don't gain new tactics, they don't start attacking you or the cannons or the cannon supply lines. They just fly in the same straight line to the base each time, and shoot slime at it until it goes offline. For 30 seconds, then it is back and nothing has changed. Until you get to end game, there is very little reason to even bother defending the base, unless you are playing on the highest difficulty, in which case one failure to defend will wipe out weeks worth of work by instantly ending your game. There really is no middle ground there.
- The base defense(s) are/is a cannon on a tripod. It changes color as you get higher tiers of it, but it's still the same cannon. The primary challenge of defending your base is keeping the battery charged on said cannon during the zerg wave. That's it. No phalanx anti-air weapons, no rail guns, no tesla coils, no anti-matter fountains. Just the cannon. End game, you can get some missiles, and that's it for your sci-fi arsenal. Cannons and missiles. I do like the defense spider-bot, however. Even though he is automated and requires no strategy or input from the user to function, he is a good example of a cool sci-fi style weapon you might expect in that setting.
-Death by pop-up. It was acceptable when I was playing puzzle games on my Macintosh computer as a kid. In 2017, it just seems lazy. You're walking along and you see a big alien in the distance. You go to investigate the big alien and suddenly a Dune sandworm pops out of the ground and you are dead, with a snarky pop-up to announce said death. No fight, no panicked grab for your rifle, no dodging or strafing, no shield damage or heart loss. Pop, death, Death Pop-up. Start over. 
Or you are ascending your newly dug deep core tunnel on your way back to your base when you pass a blue layer of rock in the middle of your flight. You tap your grappler to make the next ascent, but nothing happens. No ""cold sensation"" or icing warning on the grappler. It just doesn't work anymore. You drop, grappler still does nothing even though you are now in a warm layer. Splat. Death. Death Pop-up. Start over.
Or you get past the Dune sandworm and go investigate the giant alien overmind you saw before. At an unmarked distance from the overmind, but well before you actually touch it... you guessed it, Death Pop-up. Start over.

It isn't to say there shouldn't be dire risk. There must be dire risk for the game to be fun. In fact, I think the risk to your base from the wave attacks should be higher. But this is a game. In playing a game, the ""playing"" part should be emphasized. There is no game-play element to death by pop-up. Lots of people enjoy the challenge of a good fight, but very few enjoy being randomly brained or splattered with no option to defend oneself.

All of that aside, the logistics puzzles and the spelunking alone make for a fun experience. If you can ignore the tacked-on nature of the combat/defense element, I'd still say give it a try when you see it on sale.",1492671714,1494602654,True,3,0,0.501966536045074463,13,True,False,False,False,,,

Sci-fi voxel game with cool machines, lasers, weapons and monsters!

FCE is a great construction/destruction type game that offers a lot of depth and creativity and I fully recommend it.

You will enjoy this if you enjoyed these other games:

From The Depths
FCE isnt as complex but still has a technical aspect and is very stisfying when everything works well like you imagined.

Terraria
FCE is more tilted to the scifi and is 3d of course.  It feels very progressive, like terraria, and you are only limited by your imagination.

Anarchy Online
The grind in FCE is there of course, and is very adjustable...so much so that it feels like your not grinding at times. Anarchy online of course is not a construction type game, but it has great character progression and a satisfying curve, like FCE.

If you mash the 3 games mentioned above together, you get a simulacrum somewhat like Fortresscraft Evolved...I love it.  My brother and I play together on our own server and we both highly recommed it!

Update 2018 / Actually reviewing the game:
The developer is back after 10 months injury time. Because of the injury, the game has earned a slightly worse reputation because of the long standing bugs this last year. Most/all of these bugs are now fixed, and new patches are going out constantly!

In short, this is a highly detailed and satisfying 3D logistics game that also ties in tower defence mechanics and survival mechanics.
Despite its looks, this game is nothing like Minecraft, whatsoever. It is so much more, and intensly much bigger!

After crashing on a planet, you are almost all alone on a strange frozen alien world. Luckily, your trusty helper ARTHER, and some equipment has survived. You are able to survive the cold nights by feeding coal in your Central Power Hub (CPH).

You soon realize that manually feeding the CPH is too much work, so you setup an excavator and some conveyors to automatically feed the CPH with fuel. Great, now you have power to excavate other resources. You will need resources to fend off the incoming attacks and perhaps find a way to get off this icy world.

After a while, tinkering and crafting, setting up system after system, you suddenly have a huge sprawling factory with resources going everywhere, powerlines stretching as far as you can see, and huge underground networks going literally thousands of meters down and in each direction.
You are slowly taking over this world, harvesting its resources for your own benefit, utilizing your tools to a greater and greater extent, optimising your systems bit by bit, and eventually conquer the beasts that keep coming at you.

There are so many ways to conquer this game, and so many systems to build, you will never run out of something to do. The best part is, with the recent years optimisations, you can build over a million machines without noticing a slowdown. After my 700+ hours of playtime, I still feel like I haven't seen it all.

I especially like the complexity, the scope, and the many larger multiblock machines. I love the cascading troubleshooting throughout your systems, when something goes wrong. E.g: The defence game may look simple, but being tied into the logistics system, it makes for a very satisfying challenge. Why aren't those rockets firing? Because your rocket production line ran out of gold. What happened to the gold? The cargo lift ran out of power. Why did it run out of power? Because the jet fuel production stopped due to being overrun by the hivemind. Fix the hivemind issue, and watch your systems fire up one by one as the jet fuel production ramps up, feeding that jet engine, powering that cargo lift, providing that gold used to produce those missiles, that will, finally, blast the waves of incoming terrors into small pieces that you can use as resources.

Don't worry though, if you have a life and a family, simply start a world on the ""Rapid"" setting, you will avoid spending hours planning and building, since you can use simpler and faster systems while still feeling like you accomplished something grand by the end.

Should you get this game?
If you like planning, power, systems, HUGE bases with literally hundreds of thousands of live machinery and conveyors: YES.",1492536345,1517748660,True,3,13,0.477321833372116089,0,True,False,False,False,,,

About The Game:
I wont re-bother saying all the things already pointed out about how it's like this or that game.  I'll just let you know what I like about it.  To start, It's great for the OCD in me as it gives one the tools to learn what you need without holding your hand so tight that you can't do what you want.  Less about building awesome castles, more about building awesome factories that automate every little task you can think of (Though you can still build castles that like, shit or even a castle factory).   Best part of this game is when after you've been doing things by hand for hours and finally figure out how to automate the process with logic systems and cool conveyor routes, the reward is a bit like a king sitting on his throne looking out over his land as the farmers and soldiers toil for his gain.  But much less 'slavey' than that sounds because they are all machines.

Anyhow, this game is great for the creative in me and I bet if your easily addicted to fine tuning systems until they are perfect then you'll get sucked into this game right away. I'm 85hours in and still unlocking new tech.  From the looks of what the interwebs has to say, I'll be unlocking things for quite some time to come too.  Not all of it is just the next tier up kind of stuff either.  Research is done in a very creative way as there are two different ways it's tackled.  Early game most of it is just scans, a few hours in you'll build machinse the process cores and spit out research you can use as well. When you finally get a good automated process for it, it's very satisfying.  

Anyhow, I've said enough.  I just thought this game specificly desereved some good praise as it stands alone unto all the clones you see around.   I hear a lot of people thinking this is just a minecraft clone but that couldn't be farther from the truth.  About the only thing these two games have in common is voxel landscapes.  Everything else is unique and from what I've seen, completely origonal.  And you can go a LOT deeper in this game then you ever will in minecraft.  Infact, if you go too deep you'll need special heating unit in your suit to keep your ass from freezing to death.",1492436577,1492436577,True,2,0,0.52704310417175293,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I really don't understand the negative reviews. The single developer has delivered a large amount of content and updates over the years. The game is priced low enough to make the DLC an easy choice to buy (plus you are supporting his efforts). The mod support is great. The game runs quite well considering the incredible size of your bases and world, and the massive number of enemies being hurled at your defenses.

As far as as gameplay goes, if you enjoy resource gather, mining, and automation then this is about the best there is. Even after hundreds of hours I am still sometimes in awe at the massive underground complexes I have stumbled across and built myself. I do agree that sometimes the game can be a bit obtuse in the beginning, but once you understand that things are meant to be built on a grand scale everything gets so much more enjoyable and easy. Also, I will agree that some mods are must haves for quality of life improvements, such as, infinite ore stacks  and Tricky's hoppers.

It is so insanely grindy, tedious to play, too many unnecessary objects to craft, too many steps in the production of each item, zero content over the land everything is deep in claustrophobic caves, tower defense aspect is a total afterthought that you can just ignore because it is meaningless, etc, etc.

Terrible gameplay but the graphics are a major problem too. If you enable shadows it tanks your framerate even on a good PC, and if you disable them it looks so basic. But even besides the shadows, nothing was optimized so your frame rate is going to die once you start building all the millions of different objects. In one of the last updates he made it so that you should build a block box around every part of your base to save the framerate...

It is also comparable to Factorio (with Factorio beeing way more complex).

It is very addicting to automate everything, but this is not all there is. The game also got tower defense elements, as you have to protect your base and certain buildings from regular waves of enemies with turrets and proper logistics, to keep them working.

Sadly the game also has some drawbacks. Especially the depth of the map is annoying. Just getting from T1 to T2 ores needs you to dig hundreds of blocks down which also means you then have to create ways to transport energy down, ressources up and a way for yourself to get fast up and down. And this game has actually four tiers. There are ways to make this easier, but those arrive quite late (e. g. a quarry that digs a 3x3 shaft down so you can immediately use a elevator).

Also the tech tree is quite weird at times. For example, it takes hours till you are able to use mincarts and when you have them, you simply don't need them anymore.

The game has also some technical issues. The UI is ugly as hell (and feels like it is done for a tiny resolution) and the draw distance is quite low. Also items on conveors are invisible regulary.

Other than that it is a fine game if you like fiddling around with machines and automation. It is better than Minecraft with mods in that area.

-saving the game uses such a weird compression algorithm that crashes the game 100% of times, may be aswell hardware specific (reproducable)

The optimization for rendering is bad too. I have to set all the detail to lowest with 1/2 resolution (Yes, I have to play the game in a window which sucks) to make it run at around 30 fps. At the same time, I can play Minecraft very smoothly so I assume it is this game's problem.

However, I really love factories-designing games. Although similar to factorio, this game is really creative in its own ways.   I really love how energy is transferred through lasers. I also love the concept of hoppers (which are similar to inserters in factorio though).

Also, I really love that you can go (almost) infinitely deep in this game. It really gives me a sense of being in a 3D world. factorio is 2D obviously. Although Minecraft is 3D, the height limit thing is just annoying. When you are playing Minecraft you can get to the bottom very quickly. It feels like being in a paper world.

Last but not least, I also love the ""op-ness"" of the main character. You basically get the ability to fly (even though really hard to control), infinite long reach, and very fast health regen from beginning. You also almost lose nothing when died. All these settings really let players get into the actual designing instead of worrying about getting to some where.

*edit*

Turns out I was wrong!  And so were the YouTube videos I watched!  Steam Reviews works again!

Still have more time before the next Factorio patch, so will try again this week.  Would have been nice if the interface or in-game help had explained this after I had laid down the ore miner or looked up conveyer belts in the in-game help, but I understand many games are too busy being awesome to explain themselves.

*edit edit*

Well, previously this was a negative review.  This isn't wholely a positive review either, wish there was some more shades in the middle for Steam.  As I mentioned previously there are some teaching issues.  Mass-building/build-to-me really should be in more help files or hand-hold explained (not the rest, but something as core as that should be clearly laid out from the start, especially on any kind of not-hard-mode).  At the very least it should show up in the help files of commonly mass-built things like conveyer belts.  Additionally the quest/tutorial system that is trying to tell me generally what to try building next started useful but then got very seperated from my current progress, recommending things that I had already done/experimented with a long time ago at sometimes and then recommending things that are way past my tech level (or usefulness) at others.

Also, you don't normally expect a Nvidia 1080 with a i5-6500 CPU to hit framerate issues in games, but the center of my base where most of my conveyer belts meet causes noticible chug.  Some gameplay mechanics to encourage spreading out or optimizations would be useful.


I also prefer the inserter model from Factorio instead of the way hoppers and belts interact here (that may be due to me paying Factorio first, but I am fine with the different ways they do power).

But... building conveyer belts in 3d... digging and building elevator shafts... carting energy to deep mines and barely making it back to the surface before hypothermia sets in....  Very enjoyable in a similar but different way than Factorio.  (although similar to factorio, killing bugs is a bit meh, and the starting wasps have a longer range than the starting turrets, which is frustrating)

*edit edit edit*

Framerate issues fixed.  When the game starts up, the launcher was pre-set to ""fantastic"".  Downgrade that to ""good"" and the graphics quality does not noticibly go down, but the framerate improves around your core considerably.  Turns out the developers consider ""good"" the effective top-tier for their game.  That's fine, but was not expected and I didn't feel it was communicated that well compared to expectations for that kind of launcher.",1489371624,1491530322,True,2,1,0.525086343288421631,7,True,False,False,False,,,

If you don't know what I'm talking about, but you like Automation, Logistics, Production, Multi-tasking or games that can actually feel alien, hard or challeging, then you should try it out.

Although the 'FortressCraft' name may make it seem like another one of the infinite Minecraft clones and knock-offs, the only thing it shares with Minecraft is the voxel-based world. A bunch of other things can resemble modded Minecraft, however, it's still unique and easily stands on its own.

FCE is all about exploring and finding resources, and getting machines to exploit those resources for you. Instead of spending most of your time manually digging and mining, you'll spend your time actually thinking, planning and implementing solutions of all kinds, expanding your base and coming up with cool machine designs and setups to do boring work for you while you run around using your time where it really matters.

I've first played FCE years ago, and now that I came back to it, it's much different. There's a lot of improvements, from visual, to technical and gameplay improvements, which really makes it all an even more solid experience.

If there's one thing I would complain about FCE (and how it changed), is that some things take insane amount of resources to craft. Indoubtly those were (re-)balancing attempts, but I'd prefer more sensible requirements. 
I'm still barely on the mid-game, though, so I can't give a proper, full review on its balancing and wether such high requirements make sense.

To be really concise, FCE is not for everyone. So I do recommend you check videos out if you can.
It can be time consuming and it will make you think about solutions and designs when you're away from the game. It might make you draw setups in notebooks. It might make you want to stick solar panels wherever you can.

The developer, after all those years, still works on the game. Which is why I'll be buying the DLCs soon - it's really admirable to see someone working on something for so long after it's release, without it being bullshit features or updates.

There's something satisfying about striking the earth, exploiting an alien planet's resources, and using said resouces to murder the innocent creatures that lived there before you.

You'll have to take your time to learn how everything exactly works. This will take a while. And after that you can still put hundreds of hours into this game even without the expansion. So basically if you aren't patient or don't have much time then this game isn't really something you're looking for.

The game itself is currently more a sandbox, where you have to progress further by automating all the boring stuff. How you do it, is up to you. You want a huge coal power plant, then go for it. You want to generate a lot of green (and free!) power? Sure, there are enough solar panels to choose from. If you like building complex stuff and make huge automated factories then this game might be for you.

It also does have a tower defence aspect, but most of it can be ignored without any side-effects. This might be better later on, but currently you only have [spoiler]hives[/spoiler] which will try to ruin your day. If you expect much tower defence strategy then you should look elsewhere for now.

The graphics need some polish here and there, but I think they are fine. You have an infinite world, in each direction. I see some reviews have at least once 'minecraft' or 'factorio' in them, though this game is still different, basic minecraft graphics look ugly compared to FCE. Also content-wise, factorio is indeed more polished in various ways, but that doesn't mean it is a better game for everyone.

Last thing is about multiplayer. Some might not like how multiplayer works in this game. Especially on public servers. The issue is that you [u]have to communicate with all the people on that server[/u], because you only have one CPH. I didn't like this, because there are some players who think they can do everything better, and as soon as you leave, they start to remove the things you have built and they build it the way they like. This can happen without them even asking if it's okay to remove your setup(s).

Summary:
Get this game if you like sandbox games and you want to give it time to learn, and of course you like thinking about efficient ways to make a big factory. If you don't have much time, then go for another game.

Le but est d'extraire du minerai (7 principaux et plusieurs secondaires) afin de produire les machines qui vous permettront de construire et d'emmagasiner assez de puissance électrique, pour déclencher des frappes orbitales contre 4 mega boss (intuables sans cette frappe orbitale) disposés aux 4 diagonales, assez loin de votre base.  Ceci pour le jeu de base, l'extension ""frozen factory"" prenant le relai ensuite pour un défi logistique encore plus vaste mais je ne peux pas en parler je n'y suis pas encore. Ma partie la plus avancée, en est a 3 jour et demi de played, et j'ai mis en place mes chaines logistiques pour automatiser la recherche, qui se fait par le biais de la transformation de ces 7 minerais principaux. 


Ca a l'air simple mais çà ne l'est pas. Il faudra creuser profond, explorer des cavernes (connectées ou non entre elles, tout est procédural et plutot bien réussi question forme du terrain mais j'en suis qu'à la moitié du contenu de base.. ) afin de trouver les veines de minerai, certes abondantes (paramétrable en début de partie) mais il faudra remonter tout çà à la surface tout en défendant la logistique contre des monstres mangeurs de minerai: les mynocks, qui, si on les laisse faire, font grossir un ""hivemind"" (sorte de boss dans une gangue de résine très dure et quasi incassable, inoffensif en soi, si ce n'est qu'il peut donc grossir, et grossir, et encercler votre base => monde foutu ^^

Le jeu est en anglais. De l'anglais minier (enfin un peu faut pas exagérer non plus! :p ). Donc pour celles et ceux qui ne parlent pas anglais, le jeu sera d'autant plus compliqué. Mais rien d'insurmontable, surtout si vous avez déjà joué a Factorio (que je recommande également), en tout cas en ce qui concerne les automations et les tourelles pour se défendre contre les ""creeps"" qui viendront inlassablement une fois votre base un peu agrandie. D'ailleurs à cet aspect, ne deployez pas les tourelles lasers mk1, elles sont ni plus ni moins là comme composant intermédiaire pour les mk2, qui sera l'ossature de votre défense passé -80m de profondeur (profondeur à laquelle les mynocks commencent à apparaitre) et sur le perimètre extérieur de votre base en surface (renforcez surtout les diagonales depuis votre Central Power Hub (CPH, votre base initiale et inamovible, meme si plus tard on pourra bouger le smelter avec le ""gun v2"" mais plus tard..)

Les monstres ne s'attaque qu'à votre CPH lors des vagues, ils ne cassent rien dans votre base ni ne vous tirent dessus. Si le CPH tombe a 0% de santé, votre énergie accumulée dans votre réseau est remise à zero, sauf si vous avez augmenté la difficulté en début de partie (paramètrable donc), ce que je ne recommande pas pour apprendre, tout comme il faut jouer en survival, le ""creative mode"" est le mode builder sans challenge (tout est constructible a volonté et gratuitement, pas de monstres, enfin je crois, j'ai pas testé! ^^ )

Donc oui je recommande ce jeu, pour peu qu'on supporte les cubes et les voxels, l'ambiance cavernes et catacombes est fort sympathique sans être oppressante, les cavernes sont plutot vaste, et on peut creuser comme on veut (ctrl clic gauche pour creuser plus vite au prix d'énergie de la combinaison du personnage..) tout comme remodeller le terrain facilement, constuire des blocs transparents (en recyclant de la roche), bref pas mal de choses sympa pour faire une base vraiment unique et détaillée.

La progression est lente d'autant qu'il faut prendre le jeu en main et comprendre les machines et leur fonctionnement. Il y a de bons guides de la communauté dispo, en anglais. 

Au niveau mod, si je devais en retenir que 2, çà serait le GPS tool (upgrade de combinaison pour connaitre votre coordonnée exacte, car de base vanilla n'offre que le profondimètre, donc on peut facilement se perdre sans. (/kill pour respawn a la base, çà peut servir! :p )
Et l'autre c'est le pointeur de mesure laser, car il permet de sonder les blocs (savoir s'il y a du minerai, de la roche ou de l'air) et son rayon passse au travers de la roche donc idéal pour connecter ""proprement"" des cavernes et autres réseaux que vous construirez au fur et a mesure et de plus en plus profond. 

Pour passer les cold cavern il faudra le ""suit heater"" disponible seulement avec le labo avancé, qu'il vaudra mieux automatiser, puis ensuite un ""toxic filter"" pour les toxic cavern, ect, bref... :)

I have had this game since the early days of early access, I've had fun playing it but it's never been ""finished"" and time after  time I have to set it aside before picking it back up due to ground breaking bugs. Scroll to the bottom for the TLDR;

I've had worlds corrupted on me, ones that have had hours worth of work put into them
I've had major work lost due to sudden crashes
Several updates have causes existing worlds to no longer be loadable
Granted all of these are while it was in Early Access, frustrating but can be expected from a game in development (hence putting it aside and trying it again later)

Well it's been out of Early Access for a while now so I thought I would give it another go around, unfortunately there are still issues that while not ""game breaking"" are 'game breaking'.

I have a HTC vive and the game starts up in VR mode every time, unfortunately VR mode isn't useable as the game won't load pass the world creation ""into"", even while loading the resolution is lowered to the point that it's not even playable.  That's fine, I can play it 2D except:

There is no way to force it not to start Steam VR
When it starts Steam VR it doesn't start it properly causing Steam VR to error out until restarted
I have to catch the right time in the loading screen to hit space to switch over to 2D mode

Then there the other issues with the game:

Still crashes occasionally
When you exit the game it doesn't quit, steam thinks it's still running and won't let you restart until you quit steam and reopen steam (not just the game)
There are still issues with block placement and Orientation and getting everything to align correctly

I understand that the developer needs income to continue development, and I'm good with the fact that additional content is coming in the form of DLC but am rather on the fence with the patreon content.... There is something to be said for the privilege of getting early access to something, but some of those items are in my opinion ""Core"" items, that should be part of the base game (Mutators, since mods break achievements) as well as the fact that the ""base"" game isn't finished and is still buggy.  It comes across that new content is being developed to bring in income, bugs are being fixed while new content is being made but of course new content takes times and effort (which in turn slows down bug fixing), it leaves a bad impression on me that new content is being made to bring in income before the base game is even  finished.   The fact that the content is good and useful is conflicting, I want to support the game and the developer but at the same time I won't be buying DLC for a game that still doesn't function properly.

TLDR version;
I really want to like and recommend this game but I can't, it's still isn't complete and New content is being released before bugs are fixed in the base game.
Game is buggy, crashes to desktop.
Even if you quit properly it won't relaunch unless you completely shut down steam and restart it
If you have VR capabilities (HTC Vive) it forces the game to launch in VR mode, except VR mode doesn't work

I pick up these types of games with relatively low expectations, if I can get a few days of enjoyment out of them hey, I'm relatively fine with that, but I have to say the developer of this game has made a completely unenjoyable game that many have picked up with hope for what it could be.

the (lone) developer's attitude ammounting to this: I'm not doing it wrong, and my game is just as good as or better than x other game, people are just too stupid to realize it

rather than accepting the fact that he has made an unenjoyable game that's idea of content is long ginds and waits, where you are forced to play longer than steam's main refund policy in before you can even begin to realize how little (and unenjoyable) content the game really has.

whats more, rather than properly fixing their game, when an issue showed up relating to directX and unity, rather than fixing than putting out a patch to fix the problem, instead he left people to dig for the fix, even if he did post the fix, it is extremely poor customer service

relating to the developers live streams, which I've frequently watched both him and streamers he was talking to while they played. 

the developer of this game uses being a 'lone developer' as an excuse constantly, despite constantly going on about how great his game is doing, if the game is doing as well as he says it is, he can afford to hire proper help

the developer has reached to point of unsulting those people who have been unsatisfied with the game giving negative reveiws calling them 'abusive' and with ill intent

the maker of this game has no intention of delivering on this game, he slapped together a game, perhaps with good intentions at the start, but he slapped a 'finished' label on it as though that 'finished' label would magicly make people happy with the game

his attitude towards the people who play his game, is that he shouldn't need to update it, and we should be happy he gives us anything since he decided the game was 'finished' 16 major patches ago, and describes those patches were 'free content' despite the fact that the game was marked as being 'completed' when it was no where near it, and his attitude suggests he could just abandon the game and run with the money if he chose to. 

now for the POSITIVE (yes there is a positive): the most recent patch, PATCH 16, seems to be a shift in the right direction, polishing the game in a way that fortresscraft has long needed

 that developer still has a bad attitude, but watching his interactions with steamers suggest that slap from reallity is coming, and he is at the beginning of seeing it coming 

he talks about how his game would be so much greater if people would just stream and post videos of it more, meanwhile he goes on to their streams and insults them when they do to the point that the big youtubers that took interest in the game in the early stages, now completely ignore his requests. ( in the recent stream by cpw, a well known developer of numerous very well known mods for other games, the djarcas (the developer of forgresscraft) spent a great deal of time saying it wasn't his fault that the person playing was stupid, when the game did a poor job of explaining what needed to be done )

now to wrap things up, I've seen enough upstart developers in my own personal work who later got a nice slap in the face from reallity, I'll wait things out a bit and give them time, but the developer of this game needs a serious reallity check if this game is ever to be recomended by me, even as insiginficant as that will likely sound, telling your customers that they are wrong for disliking what you've done with the game is and extremely poor buisness practice.",1486024326,1486025954,False,17,1,0.369163006544113159,25,True,False,False,False,,,

It does live in the same family with Factorio but it's not fair to either to say they are the same. I'm a huge factorio fan myself but have spent more time in FCE due to cosmetic and the more in depth base building aspects it provides.

i played the game for 90 hours, and i've to say it's a great game and make absolutly fun.
this game isn't for all types of players, you must like crafting and building and it costs time :P

The Game:
The most one will describe it in a mix of Factorio and Minecraft or Factorio in 3D, and yes it's like that.
In the Workshop you also find interesting and helpful mods (GPS Tool, is a great help).
The Game hasn't an easy start, because before you can automat everything you need to get the stuff, but if you have the first automated smelters the game speed increases.
You also be attacked by aliens, so you need a base defense, so don't forget it ;D

Please notice it's a early access game so some bugs could be possible (if didn't found one) and it's a one-man-project.
But it get still patched and new content.

For the MP:
- to host a game you need uPnP (my router doesn't support it or i'm just stupid)
- and don't forget open the Port 27012
- I could play with my friends but sometimes, it don't work but i seen some let's plays where it works without problems (normally)

I got this game pre-release. And even then its was more polished a year ago than most pre-release games out there.

Guess I'll go create a world (no other available options).  Start typing in the world seed, go to click ""ok"", mouse cursor has vanished... Ok, so it's gonna be like that, eh?  Hit ""enter"", mouse is back... Strange way to start things off.  All menu's to this point are waaayy too big (playing on a 43"" 4k monitor), but yeah, whatever, I'll probably find the settings in-game.

Start the game, watch the initial cutscene which I guess trying to explain what's going on?  Get into the tutorial, but have absolutely no clue what to do, anywhere.  There's zero consistency in the presentation of information, no idea what the keys are (as I didn't find a settings menu before starting to check!), and the tutorial is pretty vague.  Information is arbitrarily displayed when your cursor is over random items, but there's nothing to really direct you.  I patch together some basic directions (pretty sure I missed half of course), one screen tells me to craft something, which I do from a menu (without the slightest clue as to its material requirements, purpose, or process), and bam, the tutorial ends... wait... what?

Absolutely nothing learned in the first 15 minutes of the game.  I figure out how to ""dig"", make a hole (figure why not?), can't get out, tutorial didn't cover that (or anything else really).

Whatever.  Enough for now, Exit game. Screen whines something about trying to compress something or other... Let it run for 30 seconds... Says you can exit, but nothing is clickable (even if it was, none of the buttons display when being pressed, etc.).  No progress, alt+tab / force-close.

This game needs a serious tutorial/UI overhaul before it's worth wasting any time.  FWIW, I can manage to build asparagus staged rockets in KSP, I've finished Factorio (*with* bobs mods), etc.   The basics of a tutorial/etc. should be well within my capability to grasp, yet somehow, the first 20 minutes of this game were about as clear as mud.

[update - 01-Mar-2017]:
Well, I took the plunge and gave it another go.  I reset the world, played the tutorial up to the point it dropped the shield.  Honestly  -- it looks exactly the same as it did before.  

The UI is absolutely terrible in every regard.  Maybe it's my 43"" monitor/4k resolution -- but the text is enormous, the dialogue boxes are all at minimum opacity with crap going on directly behind them, the fact that all of the icons are fuzzy and look like excessively-inflated 16 bit art that doesn't match the rest of the landscape rendered in ""fantastic"" mode.  

The tutorial gives you a set of directives that you follow because you're told to, not because they provide any compelling narrative, or stitch together actual game mechanics, etc.  

And then at the end of this little mini tutorial, there's a robot floating off to your left, with the text ""press h [blah blah blah]"", but when you turn to look at him, he perpetually shifts away to sit in your peripheral (and the text rotates away, so if you missed it, you can't read it now).

Bottom line, DjArcas: have an actual UI dev take a poke at your game, if you can't draw somebody in during the first 15 minutes of gameplay, then they're never going to discover what's beneath the hood, and that's your lost/flipped sales at the end of the day.",1485580694,1488439085,False,9,0,0.48336520791053772,9,True,False,False,False,,,

Am Ende gibt es ein paar nützliche Tipps für Beginner

----------------------------------------------
Kurze Zusammenfassung für Lesefaule:
----------------------------------------------
- Nein, es ist kein Minecraft Klon! Fortresscraft gab es bereits vor MC.
- Es gibt richtige Ziele, viele Gefahren und einiges zu entdecken
- Unglaublich umfangreich und extrem süchtig machendes Spiel
- Wer Automatisierung und kreative OpenWorld Spiele (wie zB: Factorio) mag, ist hier genau richtig
- Hauptspiel + FF-Erweiterung bieten ca. 200 - 300 Std. Spielspaß
- Man benötigt keine der DLC für das Hauptspiel
- Es gibt nur einen Entwickler, was die weitere Entwicklung und Updates etwas schleppend macht. Dennoch bekommt man - ohne zu bezahlen - kostenlose Updates.
- Du willst nur Multiplayer spielen? Kauf es nicht!
- Nochmal: Macht extrem(!) süchtig!!!

----------------------------------------------
Nun aber etwas ausführlicher (Achtung, kleine Spoiler):
----------------------------------------------


Beginn:
-----------------------
Man startet auf einem fremden Planeten und hat zu Beginn nur eine zentrale Energieversorgung. Das heißt zuerst sucht man sich Erze, schmelzt daraus Barren und baut damit seine Logistik und Energieversorgung auf. Hierbei kann man schon zu Beginn relativ schnell alles automatisieren. Auch wenn der Anfang im allgemeinen etwas schleppend voran geht. Dennoch hat man ständig etwas zu tun ohne dass Langeweile aufkommt.
Energie wird mittels Laserstrahlen übertragen und in Batterien gespeichert. Materialien werden mittels Transportbändern bewegt.


Ziel des Spiels:
-----------------------
Es gibt 4 sog. Overminds, welche in gewissen Abständen (proportional zu eurem aktuellen Energieverbrauch) Gegner spawnen, die auf eure Base zufliegen. Diese könnt ihr dann mit Geschützen, Raketen, Robotern usw. beschießen.
Ziel ist es, alle 4 Overminds zu zerstören. Dazu muss man ein Gerät bauen, welches unglaublich viel Ressourcen benötigt, welche man durch Automatisierung später zusammen craften muss.
Sind alle 4 Overminds zerstört, kann man natürlich trotzdem weiterspielen, oder sich den DLC kaufen.


Hauptspiel:
-----------------------
Die Meiste Zeit bewegt man sich eher vertikal als horizontal. Dafür kann man aber Minecarts und Aufzüge bauen um sowohl Materialien, als auch den Spieler zu transportieren. Man befindet sich einen Großteil eher unter der Erde und sucht nach neuen Erzen oder baut die Logistik aus um Materialien an die Oberfläche zu befördern.
Hier sind auch keine Grenzen gesetzt. Man kann seine Basis so groß skalieren wie man möchte und so ziemlich alles automatisieren.


Entwicklung:
-----------------------
Leider gibt es nur einen Entwickler. Und da das Spiel nicht so bekannt ist, wie es eigentlich sein sollte kann er es sich auch nicht leisten weitere Entwickler einzustellen.
Je nachdem wie es finanziell weitergeht, wird er nach dem Release des nächsten DLC (Adventure Pack) aufhören das Spiel weiter zu entwickeln.
Das ist sehr schade, vor allem weil er nur ca. 10% von den Dingen umgesetzt hat die er geplant hat. Aber von Luft und Liebe lässt sich leider keine Miete bezahlen.
Mal sehen, wie es weiter geht. Aber ich schätze das wird noch mind. 1 Jahr dauern.

Der Entwickler und die Community ist übrigens sehr aktiv in Discord, falls man sich da mal unterhalten möchte :)


Multiplayer:
-----------------------
Aktuell ist der Multiplayer fast unspielbar. Es gibt einfach massenhaft Bugs, die den Spielspaß kaputt machen. Vielleicht wird das mit Patch 17 besser. So ist es zumindest geplant.
Ich würde sehr gerne auch einen Multiplayer Server starten, aber es macht einfach keinen Sinn.
Wer also nur Multiplayer zocken will, sollte lieber noch etwas mit dem Kauf warten oder sich ein anderes Spiel suchen.


DLCs:
-----------------------
Dapper Indie & Skin Pack: Diese sind hauptsächlich zum Unterstützen des Entwicklers und enthalten nur ein paar kosmetische Elemente.

Frozen Factory: Wenn man das Hauptspiel beendet hat, lohnt es sich definitiv dieses DLC zu kaufen. Hier gibt es eine ganze Menge neue Maschinen und eine neue Gefahr zu besiegen.
Hier verbringt man 95% der Zeit unter der Erde.
Hat mir fast noch besser gefallen wie das Hauptspiel

Adventures Pack: Zum Zeitpunkt des Reviews noch nicht veröffentlicht. Ich werde es mir jedenfalls sofort zulegen.


Tips für Beginner:
-----------------------
Ab -75m Tiefe spawnen auf euren Transportbändern sogenannte Mynocks. Diese fressen Ressourcen von den Bändern und füttern damit den aktiven Hivemind.
Was bedeutet das jetzt?
Es gibt Hiveminds, welche umgeben sind von ""Hardened Resign"". Dieses bekommt man nur sehr schwer wieder weg, gerade am Anfang. Pro Ressource die von einem Mynock gefressen wird, wächst der Hivemind um 25 Blöcke und bewegt sich damit immer weiter in Richtung eures CPH (Central Power Hub). Wenn er diesen erreicht habt ihr ein Problem und könnt eigentlich schon fast die Welt aufgeben.
Wie kann man sich schützen?
Also zuerst sollte man den aktiven Hivemind finden. Es gibt immer nur einen aktiven Hivemind und es ist immer der, der am nächsten zu eurem CPH liegt. Wenn ihr die Holobase öffnet (K) dann ist der aktive Hivemind ein rotes Kästchen und alle anderen Hiveminds haben ein grünes Kästchen.
Ab -75m sollte man entweder Transport Tubes (bekommt man später) verwenden, oder alle Bänder mit Geschütztürmen absichern. Abundzu kontrollieren ob die Energieversorgung noch steht!
Später kann man übrigens den Hivemind farmen, da man daraus eine sehr wichtige Ressource erhält. Wie das genau geht findet ihr schon selber raus :)
--
Ihr braucht Augen, diese bekommt man nur von Alines, auch von den Slimeys. Dafür kann man eine kleine Farm bauen:
Grabt ein Loch ca 5 Breit und 20 Tief. Unten rein stellt ihr ein Slime Attractor und nebendran 4 Hopper mit aktivierter ""Saugfunktion"". Einen Hopper füllt man dann mit organischem Material.
Nach und nach fallen jetzt Slimes in die Grube und man kann die Augen aus den Hoppern sammeln.

- Mit dem Haken (f) kann man sich sehr schnell vertikal bewegen. Achtung, wenns es zu kalt wird funktioniert er nicht richtig.
- Verteilt unter der Erde regelmäßig Arther Ladestationen
- Auf jede(!) große (Orangene) Batterie gehört eine 3x3 Solarzelle! Free Energy
- Versucht möglichst früh Jet Turbinen zu erforschen
- Man kann normale Transportbänder auch vertikal bauen oder sogar Kopfüber an die Decke
- Die Ingame-Hilfe ist sehr umfangreich. Einfach ein Item anvisieren und (H) drücken.

Folgende Gebäude lohnen sich mMn eher wenig bzw. garnicht:
- Basis Transportbänder
- Coal enricher
- Raketen jeder Art

-----------------------
So, ich hoffe das war ausführlich genug und ich konnte euch bei der Kaufentscheidung helfen.
Für den hier angebotenen Preis bekommt man ein sehr durchdachtes und umfangreiches Spiel was unglaublich viel Spaß macht. Kreativität, Planung und räumliches Vorstellungsvermögen werden gefordert und gefördert ;)

Wenn dir das Review gefallen hat, gibt mir doch ein Daumen hoch :)

8/10

Factorio meets Minecraft. For those of you that aren't familiar, this game is about planning and constructing logistics systems to gather and process material (Factorio) set in a voxel based world with essentially no limits on the ways you can build with those voxels. (Minecraft) 

If you like Factorio, go ahead and get FortressCraft Evolved. I think you'll like it. If you like Minecraft however, you may want to watch some game-play videos, as there are many aspects of Minecraft that don't exist in FortressCraft Evolved. 

This one really gets your brain going. Resources are abundant on default settings, but difficult and time consuming to extract. As such, intelligent and cleverly constructed logistics systems will provide an immediate advantage to players with the smarts to create them. Maximizing the available resources is a constant goal, and to that end the player can continually upgrade or change their systems in attempt to better utilize what's available. On top of that, building is a key mechanic to the game and players can spend as much, or as little time constructing decorative building as they desire. Oh, and there's a wave defense mechanic slapped over the whole game. Not really sure how I feel about that, but it doesn't get in the way.",1485208592,1485208713,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,
29447664,"{'steamid': '76561198022921731', 'num_games_owned': 0, 'num_reviews': 78, 'playtime_forever': 48832, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'playtime_at_review': 39037, 'last_played': 1514954108}",english,"This is an updated review. Recommendation remains the same.

I hate tower defense games, and I despise them with a passion. There are a few exceptions, if they are cleverly hidden or done in such a way that a player does not feel punished for playing an overly specific strategy. FortressCraft Evolved, accomplishes this feat, so I give it a glowing recommendation.

Let's start this off by saying it is less about ""building"" a base in the sense one would in other survival games. You are essentially building yourself a self-sustaining factory that will get increasingly more complex, and better defended in a nearly endless cycle. Oh, and you're going to have to do this with a constant threat of aliens that will scale their attacks to how well you are doing.

This does not mean the game is punishing you for doing well, but rather rewarding you with better loot, and always having some sense of urgency. There is a tipping point where you can outright utterly crush the alien threat if you so choose. With the Frozen Factory Expansion, ending one threat allows you to focus on a new threat, or fight both at the same time if you are feeling adventurous. With many survival games, it gets boring once you hit a certain point, but in FortressCraft Evolved, the game will try harder to wreck your progress.

Naturally, the player is not going to want to lose all that progress after investing many hours into their elaborate base. This is not a problem, because once the aliens kill the CPH, they all leave. They don't blow everything up to get to it either, so they rush that part of the base and only that part (with exceptions). Your goal is to have enough firepower to prevent that. Which, with a giant mechanized spider warmachine, turrets, missile launchers, and your crappy laser rifle, give the player lots to work with. Of course, keeping missiles stocked, turrets powered, and the spiderbot fueled is the player's responsibility.

This may irritate some players, as they'll either feel ""too rushed"" or ""not rushed enough"" which comes down to player preference, not balance. There are also some people who feel the game is too grindy, yet there are settings to speed things along, so if this is a complaint, they never bothered to actually use them. Many of the negative reviews are people who either A) Didn't follow the integrated tutorial. B) Did not check any settings ever. C) Had issues that Unity caused, not the developer. This isn't some rampant fanboy comment either, as the same issue arose in several other games at the same time!

To add to that, the developer is active, and involved with the community. Visiting streams, streaming while working, and on several occassions personally fixed a bug on the spot. I'm not joking, I had a bug and brought it up on stream, and that bug was fixed within minutes. There are few developers that care that much. Yes, they are blunt too which might seem a tad arrogant, but at least you know where you stand. Sometimes a suggestion is met with a good discussion about ""why that won't happen"" which means that the developer has a vision, and not prone to ""feature creep"". Despite a few heated discussions personally (usually on why not x feature from Factorio), I still felt respected as long as respect was given. For a game review, I mention this because developer interaction is important, even long after the game has left Early Access.

If you can swing it, I'd highly recommend the Frozen Factory Expansion as well. It adds more stuff, a new enemy threat, and is a seemless transition from vanilla to the expansion. With another Expansion down the road, there has been a lot of new free content that has been added as well, so the game is still going strong.

Overall, I recommend FortressCraft Evolved. I would like to mention that as a fan of ""logistics"" style games like Factorio, this game feels right at home so I enjoy both for different reasons. Co-op is stable, and quite fun. I play with the same group for a lot of different games, and every playthrough we're always trying/finding something new. For the hours I've put in, the money I've spent (even on the dev's Patreon) has been well worth it.

Though often compared to other things like Minecraft, FC:E is far removed from the style Minecraft presents and should never be considered in the same vein.

You're on an alien planet, for a start, crashlanded after a great big asteroid smashed into the station you were about to dock in. So, where to begin? Well, you start with a Central Power Hub, some simple machines, a fantastically powerful Build Gun (which is upgradeable) with which you can mow down mountains or build massive plateaus with little effort, and you have to find yourself some resources.
With the handy Scanner, you must scan the world around you to be able to research new machines, ping for ores, and plunge the dark depths of the grandest caverns you have ever seen to discover new resources further down, beneath the surface.
Then comes the automation part of the game, which is arguably the largest part and a great logistical challenge. You'll have to start with simple automation: getting Copper and Tin to your smelter. A few conveyors, a storage hopper or four, and before long you have bars with which to build new items, blocks and machines. Next comes Iron, which is deeper down in the ground. Then Lithium, though this ore is deep enough to attract the voracious Mynocks to your conveyors, which fuel a dark threat hidden in the caverns if they eat stuff off your conveyors. So, after having placed some turrets and provided enough power, you have Lithium safely automated.

So, now with plenty of bars to spend on base expansion, what does an accomplished crash survivor like yourself have left to conquer? Worry not, for there are still several hurdles to overcome. Enemies will come to find your base, attracted by the increased energy your base produces as you expand. Vast deadly caverns lying below those precious Lithium veins provide new challenges and environmental dangers. Hiveminds stalk your base, lying in wait for that one block of conveyor not covered in turret fire to plant a Mynock on it.
As your base grows, so do the dangers, so there is never a dull moment.

That's all I will say, since you really should experience the game for yourself. I have more than 900 hours in this game, and I have enjoyed every one of them. There's nothing quite like putting all your hard work to use in calling a bombardment from orbit to exterminate your enemies.

This is a review of the direction of the game and the developer. Make your decision on a purchase accordingly. 

I have a factory which I have just spent 100 hours building. With one fell swoop the dev has decided that I will practically need to rebuild my whole power production (by releasing a patch that drastically changes production of fuel). For a factory this size, it is no small chore.

After having complained about the lack of warning for this change, I was given in-game suggestions to fix this - again, no small chore redesigning/rebuilding.

And basically told to suck it up.

To the dev: being ""the only developer"" for the game is NOT an excuse for shoddy, poorly-thought-out decisions and not looking after your gamers. 

This decision is clearly poorly-thought-out, as you didn't even realise the effect it would have on other systems downstream. 

And while you maintain your skepticism that I use 300fuel/min, I (and others) have already pointed out you need only 100/min to hit this bottleneck in my game. This furthur shows you have not thought out the effects on games running settings other than default (which are available within the base game).

(I might add that 300items/min isn't even the default setting)

All I have asked for is a way to roll back the changes via beta-opt-in, which you have previously provided for players for AESTHETIC changes.

And as a developer, telling your players to ""stick to facts and you might get a better response"" is a very almighty way of saying ""I don't give a damn"" after all of the above.

Like I said, I am frustrated.

It's a wildly popular game, and I'm sure this will be a wildly unpopular review, particularly with the short amount of time I've spent with it...but that is simply because the game is NOT friendly to new players, whatsoever.  There is a tutorial, but it is perhaps the single most confusing and least helpful tutorial of any video game in existence.  The player is thrown into the tutorial which does not explain anything whatsoever and instead, just tells you what buttons to press (without explaining what you are doing and why you must do it).

There are in game pages you can read (like a reference), but that assumes the player as the patience to actually read through it all. It's 2017. Relatively complex games come with in-game tutorials,  This one doesn't and thus, only those who are extremely patient are likely to take an interest in it.

For me, there is too much competition out there (other games) to be forced to learn the mechanics of this one. IMHO, lack of proper tutorial in a game like this is a sign of development laziness. There is no excuse for it.

////// EDIT ////////

Played the updated tutorial after Patch 16. It is better. However I didn't get far with it. It tells you to place the Holo-Laser Power Transmitter. Yet no such thing exists. I did find some sort of Power Transmitter in my inventory so I placed that, nothing happened...the quest didn't go away.

Play with friends? Perfect but good luck. 
Is it my favorite game, Yes... Just not a fan of its final form, it ruined the game.  

The long review (and why after 586 hrs, its negative)

NOTE: Don't buy the DLC unless you can actually complete the main game. After 586hrs, I never touched the frozen factory. 

Gameplay

- Controls are funky, there's an expectation of key bindings when playing these kind of games and this one just doesn't agree, not huge deal but slows you down. 
- There are too many intermediate products, machines, and requirements from the start to end product (T1, T2, T3) variations all requiring different variations of said product. 
- *Turns into Inventory Management System by player, very annoying.* 
- Poor terraforming capability in game which is really needed. 
- The struggles the player faces doesn't get fixed by technology. 
- Setting the hopper status voice, extremely annoying after awhile.
- BREAKING MY LEG sound effect, annoying. Especially as my structures got larger. 
- In game notification warning system will drive you crazy. Even hourly reports will get annoying after awhile. 

Visual
- This game used to have a Earth feel, then it was switched to these dark hues (final product), its dark and the lighting system is broke. Its either dark or be blind from lights/machine/block reflections, take your pick. Eye strain and headaches are sure to follow. 

Probably my biggest complaint is the DEV, a lot of the game updates or changes were to force the player to play to a certain expectation or play style which is why I think we are at the final product that feels unfinished. 

Overall, its just a hot mess, layers of updates/revisions to the game just adding on top of what was already there with what appears little consideration on how everything stacks up. The community is small so the hardcore fanboys defend rapidly but the slow but steady decline in ratings say it all. 

At this point Frozen Factory is a distant dream with how painful this game has become, buy the base game and see if you can finish it before buying the DLC, I've owned the DLC since day 1 and after 586hrs, I still haven't used it.

The DEV is working on the next revision of FortressCraft Evolved, I'm sure it will hit EA but I'll probably see what that becomes as a final product before I jump in.

So i edited this to reflect more about my experience.

However i still leave this review as negative, mostly since there is no ""neutral"" button, and since positive would not reflect what I exerienced / felt, while playing it.

I must admit, that I havent progressed further than starting some basic automation.
The UI get's in my way too often, and the tutorial is minimal, not explaining you lot's of things.
Geting into automation is way too tedious at start.

There is some weird sound problems for me too, like if i scan down there in a hallway the shrieking echoes forewer, having me to turn down the sound to an allmost absolute minimum.

While the idea might be nice, the 3 dimensions just make it horrible for me personally, since the grappling hook probably needs hours of training to make you go up and down a mining shaft without dying every second time (after another two hours i found that shooting it repeatedly towards the wall while ""falling"" down a shaft you can actually land...). Digging deep and then bringing those materials back (automated, not running down there every 5 minutes) is a pain at the start too.

The idea of needing unidentified blocks to scan for research is in my eyes not really good game design. An increased amount of ore or other resources per research would be much more apropriate (or did i not progress far enough still?).

One of the things that hinder me most is the limited energy at start. Just because of this, and for no other reason i run forth and back 10 or more times to just set up a mine and build the conveyors and energy supply for it. While it could be fun to dig it, find a way for the belts and the energy transmition it gets dull, because 50% of the time is ""running forth and back for energy"".

Some things are really nice in there too. Like distance not mattering for interacting with things, or the ""build to me"" feature. Unfortunatly nothing of this is explained in the tutorial, and i had to check some youtube videos and guides to even get the basic understanding of the game (and i'm one of those that dont like to have to watch let's plays to understand a game, i want immersion and learning in game).

There is potential in it for sure. And i'll check on it again some time later.

UI is atrocious. As far as I can tell there isn't even an in game list or option to look at control keys.

Tutorial is bad. Seems like this one bit has ""scan uknown item"" but if you bump into it before scanning it flys away and becomes impossible to continue.

Keeps crashing. Just constantly. And this is just the tutorial. Tried lowering graphics even though I have a decent rig but doesn't seem like that's an issue. Doesn't chug and it would have the be insanely unoptimised for that to be the case. 

I'll keep toying with it probably for a bit. I'll be surprised if it forces me to change the review.

Edit: Nope! The crash fix they said would work doesn't.

Edit: Holy crap so many controls. No in game control list. kmn.

Edit: It was fun throwing all my glowsticks to see how many I had in one spot to make it frame rate lag. Could not figure out how to pick them back up.

If you like complex games that make you think and experiment and don't mind a little rough around the edges gameplay/difficulty curve typical of a one-man development studio, you'll most likely get your money's worth out of this title.

An interesting and fun take on a survival, factory building, and tower defense game. After crashing on a frozen planet, you're forced to bend that planet to your will in an attempt to destroy the native life threatening your very existence. You'll dig deep and unearth the resources to build ever more complex machines and the defenses to protect them. Don't let the voxels used in the game fool you, this is not a Minecraft clone even though there is a creative mode available. The real draw is survival. If it's too difficult, you could always bring a friend as FC:E is also multiplayer with both local and dedicated servers available!

This is a true indie gem written solely by DJArcas who streamed most of his development and is accessible via Steam forums. This title has come a long way since it has come out of Early Access and now has a full expansion titled the Frozen Factory, which further utilizes the chilly methane gas filled caverns found hundreds of meters beneath the surface of the planet.

Most of the negative reviews are from veteran players that are upset about changes to the game that force you to [b]*gasp*[/b] build machines and production lines (a.k.a. play the game). These changes include not being able to carry unlimited amounts of ore in your inventory and being unable to smelt ores underground. This is done to force the player to utilize the plethora of machines and automation at their disposal to accomplish these tasks and craft their factory. I'd like to reiterate that these negatives will have no impact to new players of the game as they haven't been spoiled by these shortcuts. This is akin to the players complaining that there is now fall damage in-game and now have to work around it (yes, this also happened). If you absolutely have to cheat, FortressCraft: Evolved is also Steam Workshop compatible and has mods available that basically enable cheating. Many other negative reviews are due to the game no longer being in development. After almost a decade and 24 patches post release, development has stopped. Fear not! The game still has hundreds of hours of content. Bring a friend!

First off, this isn't a clone of a well known game.  After researching this game I knew I wanted it.  Spent almost an entire night reading and watching videos for this game.  Happily, when I woke up the next morning, this game was on sale.  Immediately bought two copies: one for me and one for a good buddy.

I am having some occassional issues with crashes, but mainly when I do something graphically intense, such as ping colored ores.  I have not yet even cared to try the DirextX9 workaround, because it really doesn't crash all that often.  And most times it does, it's after hours of gameplay and I just take a break anyways.

The game is still being updated and bug fixed by the dev, which is good.

Alright, I'll address the elephant in the room:  yes, it looks like Minecraft.  Yes, it's similar, in regards to you are a guy that can craft and make things and uses the world around him for resources.  However, it is so much more than a clone.  It's very much like a really good immersive mod for Minecraft with elements of HQM (hardcore quest mode) which add the purpose to the gameplay.

Hin und wieder kommt es vor, dass ich mich durch meine Steam-Bibliothek klicke und einfach nichts zum Spielen finde, ich vergleiche dieses Gefühl immer damit wie sich Frauen wohl fühlen müssen, wenn sie vor dem Schrank stehen und nichts zum Anziehen finden.

Jedenfalls war es wieder einer dieser Tage, ich hatte irgendwie Lust auf ein Crafting-Spiel, sprich etwas in dem man Ressourcen sammelt um daraus wiederum bessere Dinge herzustellen, um wieder bessere Ressourcen zu sammeln usw. Kurz zuvor hatte ich Infinifactory durchgespielt, was an und für sich ein Denkspiel ist, in dem man Fabriken bauen muss um diverse Aufgaben zu erfüllen wie beispielsweise Raumschiffe zu bauen und Ähnliches. War an und für sich ganz nett, allerdings stellenweise viel zu leicht und auch viel zu schnell durchgespielt.

So einen richtigen Kick hat mir Infinifactory also nicht gegeben, sodass meine Suche weiterging. Einige Zeit später erinnerte ich mich zurück an FortressCraft – schlechte Kritik, schlechte Präsentation und von vielen als billiger Minecraft-Abklatsch totgeredet. Einen wirklichen Erfolg hatte FortressCraft wohl nicht, allerdings war mir der Entwickler damals schon irgendwie sympathisch, weil er in der damaligen Berichterstattung zum Thema „Billiger Minecraft-Abklatsch“ als ziemliches, arrogantes Arschloch abgestempelt wurde. – Wie gesagt, sofort sympathisch. Ich mein er hatte ja recht mit dem was er damals sagte, aber das ist ein ganz anderer Punkt, auf den ich hier auch nicht weiter eingehen möchte.

FortressCraft ist auf Grund der Negativschlagzeilen bei mir in Erinnerung geblieben, sodass ich einfach mal im Steam-Shop danach gesucht habe. Kein FortressCraft… aber Evolved, sprich weiterentwickelt oder fortgeschritten – und das ist es tatsächlich. FCE ist seither eins der wenigen Spiele oder genaugenommen das einzige, das immer in meiner Steam-Bibliothek als installiert zu finden ist, doch wieso?

FCE ist ein technisches Spiel – was mir damals bei Minecraft schon Spaß gemacht hat (soweit es der Umfang der Redstone-Schaltungen zugelassen hat) konnte ich nun endlich ausbauen, aber das wusste ich anfangs natürlich noch nicht. Anfangs dachte ich: „Ja gut, man muss Basen bauen und sich gegen Aliens verteidigen.“ – stimmt letztendlich auch, jedoch gehört dazu eine Menge Vorbereitung.
Die Story ist recht simpel:

Man fliegt mit seinem Raumschiff durchs All, wird von irgendwas getroffen und landet auf einem fremden, anfangs scheinbar unbewohnten, Planeten. Auf den zufällig generierten Welten ist lediglich euer Grundstein gesetzt: das CPH (Central Power Hub) quasi eure Basis, eine Forschungsstation und ein Schmelzofen für den Anfang. Hm. Und nun? Anfangs war ich etwas überfordert und wusste auch nicht wirklich wie ich vorgehen muss, habe etwas rumprobiert und mir ist aufgefallen, dass man über eine, nennen wir es mal „Baupistole“ (dem Ding mit dem ihr Blöcke setzen und abbauen könnt), einen Scanner und ein Lasergewehr verfügt. Bauen – klar, Gewehr erklärt sich auch von selbst, aber was ich mit dem Scanner anfangen soll wusste ich zu Beginn nicht.

Ich fing also an dem Tutorial zu folgen, versorgte mein CPH mit einer Kohlezuvor und bewegte Blöcke von A nach B. Soweit so gut. Wirklich viel zu bauen gab es nicht also schaute ich in die Forschungsstation. Einige Rezepte waren vorgegeben, benötigten aber Forschungspunkte um sie freizuschalten. Hm… woher sollte ich die Punkte nehmen? Klar! Der Scanner! Als ich dahintergekommen bin für was der Scanner gut ist, machte ich mich auf den Weg und fing an alles Mögliche zu scannen: Schnee, Pflanzen, Steine, Bäume, usw. – alles wurde mir als unbekanntes Material angezeigt, also ging ich zurück zur Basis und erforschte die eben gescannten Objekte und siehe da: Forschungspunkte! Für die Forschungspunkte erhielt ich dann wieder Rezepte und konnte anfangen meine Basis zu erweitern wofür jedoch Erze und anderes Material wie Eisen, Kupfer, Lithium, usw. nötig war. Auf der Oberfläche war abgesehen von Schnee kaum etwas zu finden und ich musste auch ständig mit dem Erfrierungstod kämpfen, sodass ich mich dazu entschloss in den Boden zu bauen. Wenig später stieß ich schon auf meine erste Höhle und siehe da: Eisen und Kupfer – genau das was ich gebraucht habe. Der Abbau ging mehr als langsam voran, denn alles was ich zu Beginn hatte war diese doofe Baupistole und zwei Bohrer. Die Bohrer benötigen jedoch Energie und Hopper in denen sie die Erze speichern können.

Bis ich meine erste Versorgungslinie aufgebaut hatte vergingen einige Minuten, wenn nicht sogar Stunden. Ich fing an die Basis mit den Bohrern zu verbinden und das Erz automatisch zum Schmelzofen zu transportieren – alles viel zu langsam. Die Laufbänder waren lahm – die Energie ständig leer und im Großen und Ganzen hatte ich noch gar keinen richtigen Plan was ich da eigentlich tat.
Ich baute mich tiefer in die Erde, erweiterte die Basis und Versorgungslinien, entwickelte mein Stromnetz weiter und kam schnell an meine Grenzen. Irgendwann reichte die Energie, die ich unter Tage transportierte um im Gegenzug Ressourcen zu fördern nicht mehr aus. Ich baute mehr und mehr Batterien und Generatoren doch ich kam nicht mehr nach, denn immerhin musste ich mich auch noch um meine Verteidigung kümmern, denn man weiß ja nie was einen erwartet.

Ich musste forschen, benötigte ein Labor und dafür die nötigen Komponenten. Es war ein schwerer Start, aber als ich einen passenden Lösungsweg fand,ging es einige Zeit gut voran – vorerst. Inzwischen konnte ich einen „Gefahrenscanner“ bauen, ein Gerät welches automatisch das Umfeld nach möglichen Bedrohungen… em ja… scannt.

Bevorstehender Angriff in 30 Minuten!

Oh nein! All die Arbeit und in 30 Minuten wird meine Basis gegebenenfalls vernichtet? So nicht! Mehr Lasergeschütze! Gesagt, getan. Ich bin gerade noch damit fertig geworden meine Verteidigungslinie aufzubauen als der ganze Himmel voller Riesenwespen war – scheinbar wurden sie vom Energieausstoß meiner Basis angezogen und wollten diese daraufhin zerstören. Mit Müh und Not konnte ich die ersten Angriffswellen abwehren und mich dann wieder um den Basisbau kümmern.

Keine Bedrohungen. Gut, sehr gut sogar. Schnell ging ich wieder in den Untergrund um neues Material zu Scannen, um bessere Anlagen zu erforschen. Der ewige Kreislauf von FCE.

Kurzum baut man sich immer tiefer, ähnlich wie bei Creativerse, erforscht neue Dinge, erweitert seine Basis und die damit verbundene Produktion, automatisiert möglichst alles, um sich unnötige Arbeit zu ersparen und kümmert sich parallel um die Verteidigung und Stromversorgung.

Irgendwann ist man dann in der Forschung soweit fortgeschritten, dass man eine Orbitale Laserkanone bauen kann (nach ca. 100 Spielstunden), welche Unmengen an Energie benötigt und mit welcher man die vier umliegenden Alienspawner ausradieren kann (jeweils einer in jeder Himmelsrichtung).

Ist dies geschafft hat man zwar an der Oberfläche ruhe, doch im Untergrund geht es dank „Frozen Factory“-Erweiterung noch weiter. Die Erweiterung liefert locker noch einmal 100 Stunden Spielspaß, was man da aber genau machen und wie man vorgehen muss spare ich mir jedoch an dieser Stelle.

FortressCraft Evolved ist eines der besten Spiele, das ich je gespielt habe – es ist aufwändig, umfangreich und anspruchsvoll, regt zum Denken an und bringt selbst Erfahrene Baumeister teilweise an den Rand der Verzweiflung. Obwohl das Spiel bereits „fertig“ ist und sich nicht mehr im Early Access befindet kommen monatlich neue Updates mit neuen Maschinen und Gerätschaften hinzu was auch einer der Gründe ist wieso ich es nach wie vor installiert habe.

Aber wenn man die ersten 2 Stunden hinter sich hat und einigermaßen die Grundzüge des Spiels zu begreifen beginnt, dann sind hier viele tolle Konzepte zu einem halbwegs gut umgesetzten Spiel verarbeitet.

Beispielsweise hat man eine virtuelle Übersicht seiner Energieversorgung und Verarbeitungsstraßen. Damit hat man alles im Blick ohne sich bewegen zu müssen.

Dann kann wirklich unheimlich tief buddeln (und meistens muss man das auch) und findet ständig Höhlen. Es wird also auch in der Vertikalen nicht langweilig.

Über den Mehrspielmodus kann ich nichts sagen, ich habe bisher alleine gespielt. Aber ich denke das hier mehr Spaß drinsteckt als in Minecraft, da die Automatisierung (wie auch in Factorio) erst richtig Spaß, macht wenn alle mit anfassen.

It is exactly the genre I'd like most but unfortunatly the game design philosophy behind Fortresscraft is >>>HORRIFIC<<<.

It has a decent amount of content, more than you would exspect from an indy game, but it is balanced in such a weird way, that it is almost not playable for me.
Almost every upgrade is actually a downgrade.
For instance Smelter Upgrades. You double your smelting speed, but increase the energy cost 8-fold! So you are stuck with just building more unupgraded smelter.
And this principle is EVERYWHERE.

50% of the content has weird behavior and is gimped imo and just does not make sense.
The reason why most people do not care about this, is because they are casuals and play on very easy modes, but if you play on more advanced settings these broken game design choices completly ruin your game. Yes, Id even state that you cant play on scarce/scarce (the mode I prefer) without cheating starter items in. I tried greg mode but when I found out that the greg settings actually resulted in coal giving more energy than biomass(one of the many things that do not make sense or are semi-bugged) I disgustingly quitted and restarted.

Also it seems that the last updates did more harm than good. I am the last who is whiney about not-perfect patches, but the last ones really made some things considerable worse.

Its sad, because Fortresscraft could be insanely good but what It keeps it down is its weird (or rather non existant) game design philosophy which results in many weird hardcoded constants which are not chosen with finesse, but randomly.

I really hope that the successor Fortresscraft PHOENIX solves or understands the problems I mentioned but for what I have seen in the last years (watching patchnotes and the forum) there is a complete lack of basic understanding how to make gamesystems work with each other in a balanced and meaningful way.",1482969298,1595315312,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I ran the game on i5 4690K, MX100 SSD, GTX 1080, 16GBs of Ram.

One thing i didnt like in its gameplay aspect was that its extremly complicated, hence why i had to request a refund because if theres no multiplayer you wont be able to try things out with more than just one brain >_<.
I dont wanna say complicated games suck, hell no, but when i started Factorio it simply made more  fun with a friend so you could try things out together.

watching tutorials or lets plays suck because they take away any learning factors.

But you should try it out yourself, people say its as good as factorio - maybe they are correct and in singleplayer this game is excellent? For ~4€ Sale nothing to do wrong and with steam refund theres nothing to do wrong twice.
Just try it, maybe you dont get frustrated so fast as i did.",1482572496,1482572496,False,11,0,0.478332191705703735,4,False,False,False,False,,,

The latest Update finally fixed the clunky UI split over the place with a much more streamlined interface which was much appreciated however it could still use a few more tweaks IMO.

Gameplay has been streamlined and made to make much more sense at the end game. no more big number mental arithmatic XD

I am on the fence about recommending it because of how buggy it is, which I will explain later.  

The Good:
Gameplay consists of a voxel based mining simulator with base defense elements. There is a heavy emphasis on automation with mining rigs doing nearly all of the mining.  If you are smart, it shows in the machines and networks you build. You can build incredibly complex machines to do things like assembling rockets and feeding them into your rocket launcher, or you can build the rockets and hand feed each turret's hopper.  FC inspires you to be creative out of necessity.  I bought the expansion pack three hours into the base game, 117 hours and I'm just at the front door to the expansion pack. 

The Bad:
If you aren't smart, this is going to be a really hard game.  Some things aren't intutive and are missing, like more of things sometimes/always going north from a hopper or energy source but no big compass. Which means that some configurations only work when the machine faces a certain direction. I would also expect at least one entire base and save file to be lost due to god know what because bugs@fortresscraft.com didn't respond at all to my email. You will lose so much progress.  Don't make any huge works of art.  I found a way to get items from my broken base's save file so I could finish my review.  Also, you can only kill 3 types of enemies with your gun. Using your gun is a hassle. The grappling hook is so cumbersome and frustrating to use, because of how you get caught on things and dropped (down a mine shaft).  Also the BFL is completely broken or has unlisted usage requirements. And the Laser Borer kills you even when it is turned off.

The verdict: Get it, there are bugs. Lots of bugs. The base I lost was a one refinery, two turbine dump.  The base I have by end game has 7 refineries and two towers of turbines. (It also has hedge mazes and a cabin.  Because it takes 30-40 minutes for the end of game weapon to charge and you have to fire it 4 times minimum to beat the base game.) In the end, the gameplay is solid. 90% of it is trying ot figure out why something isn't working.

Also the UI looks a bit clunky in places.
____

EDIT 7/2018: Sadly all gameplay changes, patches do these days, don't seem add really to the gameplay. It feels like the dev has run out of ideas and now changes make things harde, more complicated, more tedious, more grindy. And i DON'T mean the endgame. 
The gameplay in earlier stages has suffered massively by this. Where it was factioresk, it's now bobsmodesk. 
I think these early stages are now really overcomplicated and offputting for new players.

The reason is ""to force players to automate more and earlier"" because they ""play the game wrong"". Making it very tedious is a poor way to enfoce  that. 

Factorio doesn't do that. It doesn't hit you over the head with an automation club..It let's you play, have fun, make msitakes, be inefficient (thats FUN) and learn things and then, on a SECOND attempt you automatically do it better and more efficient.

There are earlier, newcomerfriendlier version available in the beta-selection. But that also excludes good improvements  to performance and netcode.

EDIT end.

That 3rd dimension. makes things much more interesting, immersive but also nicely confusing.  Walking THROUGH a messy (first) factory is a greater experience than watching it from far above.  And of course there is the 3rd dimension thing.  It goes DEEP. Setting up a little (or big) base in a huge cave 500+m underground feels good but is challenging due to some balancing issues. But theres mod support.


Some balance decisions are a bit questionable. EDIT: And with the Tedium patches i mentioned earlier, that has become a lot worse. EDIT  end  Like the first real ore smelter being so far down the research tree. You're stuck with the 1 free one for a long time and can't even move it for a long time. 
Also wrong choices in research can get you seriously stuck (Suit heater&Toxic filter!). And there are some gaps in research vs access to resources that feel poorly selected..
Especiall since you see no tech tree (like in Factorio). Which becomes a massive problem in later stages. So often there's no advise what you need first or in order to get a much needed technology (Heater, Toxic filter, jet turbines) Only google tells you, what you need for what later on.

While i don't always like the balance and think, it gets way too grindy later on AND now even earlier,Mods save the day.

The game is open for modding. Which can cancel out problems or personal issues with balance, design and the ruined early game.


I use a personal mod that makes stuff much cheaper (Transport Pipes ftw) and moves certain things down(or up?) the tech tree to ease the grind. Also i like seeing stuff move about, while the intended go-to methods are more teleporty stuff (and lifts). 
But equally there are game options and mods to make it more challenging. So you can adjust it to your needs. The steam workshop has a decent amount of mods.

Also due to all storage systems being imho undersized (without mods), it remains despite automation, more manual and demands more micromanagement in the longer run, then factorio. Or a much more planned approach then mine. Then again, imagining some of the gigantic Factorio factories in 3d graphics ... it would be hard to do it with any performance left-

The biggest design problem: Research and unlocks feel erratic and chaotic and esp later without external sources you can't even guess anymore, what would make most sense to research.
The ever increasing tediousness  does NOT help.

The world/game creating options have several parameters suiting new players. Like  the amount of ore or day/night settings. Like keeping inventory on death. I can't possibly imagine doing the deep game without ""dying back home"".
Maybe with much more experience..

 But if you liked factorio and look for something  kinda similar but in 3D AND can forgive a few rough edges, its really worth it (maybe at reduced prize).  Be aware it's far from intuitive and the once gentle start for new players has been patched out.
Fun, trying and exploration has been replaced with  a demand for effiency, which is NOT how such a game should start.



PS: It runs stable for me, native 21:9 support, although it looks VERY stretched at the sides.Graphics not amazing but nice enough. Lighting at times can be annoying. But overbright pipes have been fixed in recent update. Full Steam workshop support. All is ok on the technical side. Performance is also ok but can get wonky later with very large and complex factories.
Can't really tell about multiplayer. Improving it technically seems a major focus in dev though.
And THAT part of the patches i appreciate.

PPS: There is no Steam or game option, to change language. So its only available in english. Apparently translations are work in progress and will come.

Ok there are a shit ton of quality of life improvment, the game is kinda grindy etc, but it's part of the ""fun"" of games like that and factorio etc...

If i could make just one suggestion about the game, since it's quite close to minecraft in term of look. You should add a few blocks (quite sur it's not complicated to do so), just for the aesthetic part. Add a few ""door"", colored block, wood and stone type in some kind of ""DECORATION FABRICATOR"". Why ? it would appeal to more people. My gf looked at it, kinda like it, but was like ""can i do a house etc?"" and sadly not... I mean, i spent 28 hours building my little industry, and i m quite sure a lot of people would love to take a small break and be like ""ok let's build myself a pretty house now while everything is harvesting.

I nearly gave it a thumbs down, but I think, overall, it deserves a recommendation. Most say it's a combination of Factorio and Minecraft, but it largely reminds me of Power Towers, a TD custom map that involved defending your base with towers that needed to be routed power from power generators. I enjoyed the grand majority of my [thus-far] 150 hours in FCE, despite ignoring the missions most of the time and playing my own [undoubtedly slower] style. Even not on sale, it's easy to get your money's worth out of FCE, with plenty to see and do. If you don't like busywork, there's plenty of tools for automation to build a base limited only by your imagination [and PC specs]. My biggest complaint is lack of polish, including user customization; for example, the music is ofttimes just whistling tones, just begging to be turned down or off [there's no setting in the options to adjust only the music volume, nor a setting to disable music all of the time - it must be switched off every time you play] - just little things like this that drive home that this is an indie game that needs some more love around the edges. Dev seems to listen to the community and continues to add content [even as DLC - which costs more than the base game?!? - it's an excellent value]. In-Game handbook and wiki seem to be incomplete/out of date, but I think there's some focus on improving this coming up [why the official wiki doesn't have info built directly from in-game data beats me]. I only ever played single player, so no comments on MP.

That said, it's definitely a niche offering. I used to play a heavily modded Minecraft (let's start by not pretending the game isn't influenced by Minecraft), but there was always the issue of mods not working well together. Different machines needing different sources of power, for example. Then everything would break when there was an upgrade. It was a hassle. FCE provides the experience I was looking for w/o that hassle. It's more akin to a 3d Factorio than Minecraft. 

There are negatives, of course. FCE has the nickname toilcraft for a reason. There's a lot of manual labor involved in ramping up automation. Resources are generated slowly, and you'll spend the first several hours waiting for ore to smelt into bars, even AFTER you know what you're doing. You start with one ore smelter, and there is a lot to do before you can even build a second. I find the slower pace relaxing, but I'm old. YMMV. I like the fact that I can carry on a conversation with my wife & watch TV w/ her while playing.

There IS a rapid resources mode now that makes this somewhat less of an issue, but you'll still be doing a lot of running around manually smelting stuff for hours to get things going.

The world is also really bleak and depressing. That's by design, but after a while it gets to you. A bit of biome diversity would have been nice. I haven't tested it, but it also doesn't seem to have Minecraft's nigh-endless size. It's big enough, though.

데디케이트 서버 맵을 바로 만들었더니 원석 25개에 주괴하나
원석 1개 뽑는데 30초
즉 12분 30초마다 주괴하나를 뽑는데
20~30개씩 들어가는 애미나이 조합템

근데 싱글맵을 만들어 봤더니 25배는 빨리 만들더라
6시간 존나 인생낭비

원인은 데디케이트 서버는 난이도같은거 안보이는데 실은 어려운거
따라서 싱을 월드를 만들때만 난이도를 조절할 수 있다

멀티 할거면 존나 싱글맵 만들고 멀티 파시길
안그럼 존나 겜 켜놓고 30분마다 에너지만 넣어야 할거임
아차 에너지도 부족하겠구나
암튼 멀티 바로 하지마셈

싱글로 해보니 갓겜 느낌이더라
이제는 이녀석이랑 잘 해볼 수 있을거 같아
친구놈들 설득하는게 일이겠지만

어디서 부터 손대야 할지 모르겠다는 놈은
나처럼 바로 만들어서 튜토리얼도 못해봤을거야

정리하자면 일단 싱글맵 파서 튜토리얼 꼭 해보고
싱글맵을 멀티맵에 덮어씌우기 해라

2주동안 100시간을 해버렸다
시간루팡 같으니라고


팩토리오와 비교해 보자면
팩토리오의 몬스터는 점점 체력만 많아지는 저글링 히드라였지만
여기는 뭐 웨이브몹은 같은 수준이지만
길 뚫는 몬스터나 자원루팡 몬스터
하이브 코어같은 특색있는 몬스터들이 좀더 존재한다
맵을 직접적으로 변형시키는데 보면 신기함
근데 구글링을 해야 뭔지 알수있음...


여기도 있을건 다 있다
채광기 발전기 컨베이어벨트
레일 운송 시스템(사실 드럽게 느리지만 귀여움)
화물 엘레베이터
드론 운송(사실 용도가 매우 제한적이라 안쓰임)
텔레포트(사실 콘솔 명령어로 때울 수 있음)
건설로봇(은 미구현 ConstructoBot 이거땜에 1시간 날림)
몹 경보기 자원 경보기 자원 탐색기
자동 건설기(직선만 팩토리오의 청사진 아님)
수직 굴착기 수평 굴착기 평평하게 깎는등 각종 테라포밍

자동으로 템을 빼가거나 채워주는것도 있고
멀티라면 나간유저의 광물을 수집하는것도 있다


근데 이것들을 사용해 보려면 직접 만들어서 바닥에 깔아봐야 안다
도움말에 나와있긴 한데 부족하다
깔아봐야 비로소 이놈이 뭐하는 놈인지
상자가 필요한지 컨베이어가 필요한지
어떤 아이템이 필요하고 에너지는 얼마나 잡아먹는지 
정확하게 알 수 있다
모르는건 유튭에 동영상을 보는것을 추천

이것이 나중에 문제가 되는게
어느정도 규모가 있는 시설을 구성해 놨더니
아니 TQ이게 여기 들어가? 하면서 갈아엎는 자신을 보게 될 것이다



이 게임의 목표는 메인 건물인 센트럴 파워 허브를 지키면서
오비탈 에너지 트렌스미터를 풀 차지시키는 것이다
1억을 충전해야하며 센트럴이 털리면 충전은 충전은 초기화 된다
충전중엔 몹이 더 많이 끊임없이 쳐들어 오므로
통상 방어시설보다 몇배는 구축해야 하는데
이놈들 에너지 때문에 더 쳐들어 오므로 10배 20배는 구축해야 한다
아마도 나도 아직 하는중...

센트럴만 지키면 되기 떄문에 시설 확장하는데 고민은 없다



이 게임의 단점으로는
구린 텍스쳐 이다
특히 메인화면은 정말 구리다.
게임을 실행해본 사람들중 몇%는 메인화면만 보고 껐다고 한다
인게임도 낫지는 않지만 하다보면 적응됨

텍스쳐는 구리지만
모든 파츠들이 전부 움직이기 때문에 CPU와 메모리를 잡아먹는다

아주 맑은 쨍쨍한 날이 있는데 이런 날은
눈뽕이 정말 심하다.
여기에 후레쉬 3단계를 키면 게임을 하는건지 
카메라 플레시를보는건지 착각이 든다

그리고 전력 연결하는게 매우 짜증난다
2D인 팩토리오에선 점과 점사이 거리만 되면 연결됬지만
3D임에도 불구하고 직선으로 직접 연결해야 한다
<0 0 0> 과 <5 5 5> 를 연결하려면
전선(레이저)가 3개가 필요하다는 뜻이다

생산 건물 말고 기본적인 에너지관련한게 자원이 상당히 많이 들어가서
확장하는데 시간이 오래 걸린다
난이도를 플랜티 말고 더 쉬운 레이피드로 하면 2배 더 빠르게 할 수 있다

아무래도 유저수의 차이로
모드가 적다는점


그밖에는 가성비 좋은 게임이다

One major plus to the game is that the main developer (DJArcas) streams a lot of his creation process, between bug fixes and new features, and is relatively easy to get in contact with in a variety of ways- causing a unique sense of being part of the game's creation.

The game itself is amazing. Starting with the graphics, all of them are fabulous. They might as well be considered the best- loading very quickly, with little to no lag, unlike most games that try to have good graphics (even with a not-so-good laptop or PC!).

On to the gameplay, there is a ton of content, tons of machines to build and resources to gather, while still not flooding the player with too many options. There is a story, somewhat, as well. You crash on a planet and try to get off (this is definitely not the best description of the story), which adds a point to the game, rather than pointless building.

But be warned that this game is not for everyone as it is complex and takes time.
Time for gathering resources depends on world difficulty and can range from fast to taking forever.
Base building time is not so much affected by difficulty (once you have the resources) but takes some thought to have a good layout. You can even screw up without knowing until it is too late. For example when you do not protect your conveyor belts and have uncontrolled hive mind growth.

So before starting I recommend to read some guides and/or the wiki. If you are not willing to read then you may have a hard time. The tutorial is very basic and the ingame help is not enough to understand everything in the game. There are no scenarios or extended tutorials that show you how to master the game.

Once you know how things work out it is really enjoyable to build up your base and to automate the tedious processes.

The frozen factory expansion is not required immediately for this because it extends the late game. Have played over 100 hours and just about to begin with the additional content. For that amount of playtime it is well worth it in my opinion.

The user interface is the part of the game that needs the most improvements. It makes some tasks more complicated than they should be. If you are deterred by this fact then better wait for improvements. It already improved over time but still needs more time.

My recommendation:
If you are looking for a complex game that requires time or already played minecraft with technical mods like industrialcraft (especially if you like Gregtech) then this is likely a game for you.

If you are looking for a game with less complexity and quicker progress you should look into Factorio first and come back once you need more ;)",1480025149,1480025226,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is pretty much the work of a single dev who cares for his game and puts a lot of time and effort into the development. Unfortunately all of that falls short because of the poor execution.

FortressCraft Evolved is a great example why you can't develop a game on your own after it reached a certain level of complexity and player base. It desperately needs a texture+model artist, ui programmer, and sound designer. Right now the game is completely out of balance. The poor visuals are overcompensated with needlessly high poly models and excessive lights. The game takes advantage of the engine's most cutting edge features yet you can't turn the music off or go back to the main menu once you've started playing. These and many other issues lend the game an unpolished feel and greatly hold back it's success.

FortressCraft Evolved could be one of the best games this genre has to offer. It could be an excellent game to introduce new players to ""blocky"" games while still challenging veteran players. Unfortunately in it's current state the game is totally unappealing. If you are a hardcore fan of the genre you will be able to overlook the numerous shortcomings otherwise stay clear, FortressCraft will yield you nothing but anger and frustration.",1479903897,1527415328,False,14,0,0.550991237163543701,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1. Game design seems like the dev did try to cover many bases and be thorough.  I left the game several months ago and came back a few days ago, and a lot of tech has changed dramatically and there are many more buildable structures.  It has become much more complicated in a matter of a few months.  I.E., you might have to relearn a lot of things if you leave and return later.  The overall concept of the game seems to be focused on automation, which is expensive short-term and time saving long-term, as in many automation games.  

1.25. As someone else has said recently, this game's progress is very linear compared to games in a similar genre.  They also said it better than me when they described the dev's forcing of a set pathway based on his vision of how the game should be played, and how relatively inflexible progress is in this game. Some changes/nerfs that have been implemented have forced that, for example making underground smelting extremely impractical or non-functional.  It forces everyone to do things one way: The dev’s way.  I have often thought that the dev doesn’t want anyone to do anything he didn’t originally plan on them doing in his game.

1.5. Automation elements similar to factorio include building ingots from smelters, heavy use of conveyers, and eventual (much later than in factorio, except research-fueling parts) automation of building components to build higher tier products.  This game uses storage hoppers as the primary transfer device instead of inserters in factorio.

1.75. There is a tech tree and research, probably continually getting updates along with the tech.  I've never had any major issues with it, but the components for research were very simple several months ago and are probably still the same.  It's the volume of resources needed and the power consumption of a research lab that limit research speeds.

2. Music is not very good IMO, about on par with Empyrion for that.  It's adequate.

3. Game seems generally stable, not many crashes.

4. There are still some multiplayer glitches (such as doubling items) mostly related to delays, lag and bandwidth oddities that result in items not being picked up promptly, objects not loading visually correctly/delaying being shown, etc., plus IMO the game demands pretty high bandwidth from users when doing multiplayer servers with large bases.  Maybe he's corrected this, but I doubt it. 

5. The game has what I would consider a pretty rudimentary tower defense system.  There are flying enemies (insectoids) that surge at intervals and attack your central hub, originating from 4 directions at approximately 90-degree angles away from your hub where there are hives or overminds (or whatever he calls them).  There are no pathing considerations, excepting that I think they do not go through original/unaltered naturally-formed mountains.  Otherwise, they travel in a straight line from source to target (hub).  There is a spiderbot utility NPC which can be used to aid in tower defense and now has several upgrades to damage and power reserves, etc., and I believe your personal helperbot also has a basic gun upgrade.  You have several tiers of turrets and a range of consumable missiles to defend your hub with.  Defense of the hub involves destroying the enemies before they can inflict enough damage to bring your hub down to 0% life.  The enemies drop items, mostly inert items that can be recycled later in the game, and a few items that are useful (perhaps now even critical to building certain things) and drop rarely.  The dev long ago told me that he didn't believe in the philosophy of losing progress through enemies destroying your base/etc., so that philosophy affects how the tower defense is played.  Today, just before banning me, the dev told me that pathing calculations for a 3-dimensional game like this would result in unreasonable amounts of calculations, probably especially for an online multiplayer game, so that's why enemy pathing isn't implemented to go around your buildings/etc.  The enemy spawns increase in frequency, number and tier/HP based on something called ""threat,"" which I believe is affected by how much power you generate (and possibly other factors I don't recall).

6. The game IS steam-compatible for public servers, but right now there is only one public server (and another one for patreons) and AFAIK it has stayed that way ever since public servers were made available.  The dev says at present there are about 140 private servers, but the central communication hub for the game (discord channel) doesn't have more than 1-3 of the servers' users/admins on it usually, and one of them is the public server owner.  Private servers and password-protected servers are not listed in the server list in-game, so it makes it feel very quiet.

7.  Last time I made a large base capable of charging OET (several months ago), I had significant framerate drops in the above ground world running the game fullscreen on a 1080p display on my i7-4930k @4ghz, 16gb 1600mhz ram, GTX770 graphics card, Samsung EVO 840 ssd in Win7Pro, medium settings.

8. The dev has a massive chip on his shoulder.  He is sarcastic, rude, and verbally abusive if given the chance.  He has the potential to be very helpful, but your words have to conform to a specific format for him to be receptive enough to give helpful information without also being extremely rude.  He and I do not get along, mostly because I have differing opinions and express them freely.  The dev does NOT like (and in my opinion doesn't comprehend) impulsive initial impressions of things, although his own highly reactive manner (like putting a 9-volt battery to your tongue) suggests that he bases his opinions of people and their statements on knee-jerk reflex responses, very much like most people with a persecution complex.  He would disagree that he is very intolerant of other opinions and feedback that differs from what he believes about his game, and he would disagree that he is unfair to many people, but in fact he is very clique-ish and only tolerates certain types of feedback, his methods, etc., from an established group of people.  

The easiest way to get on his bad side is to say ""this item/equipment/etc. isn't very useful,"" at which point he will almost always highlight how invalid and wrong you are, then sometimes demand to know why you feel that way so he can tell you that’s wrong too.  Today, he accused me of disagreeing with him about pathing being too computationally demanding for the enemies (which I did not disagree with, I only stated that there was no pathing and it results in a more simplified/limited tower defense system).  It didn’t matter that his accusation was provably false.  I asked him not to talk to me because all we do is argue, and he used it as an excuse to ban me from his discord. He stated that a number of people had blocked me in the communication, which while possibly true does not change the fact that he was the only person I “sparred with” in the entire time I was talking, and then only because he always reacted to everything I said because I have opinions that don’t often conform to general views and I defend my views as vehemently as he forces his.  It takes 20 minutes to prove yourself correct, but only 2 seconds to be wrong in his eyes.  You are guilty until proven innocent.

If you are very fresh, he will tolerate you briefly.  However, if he doesn’t agree with you almost immediately, he absolutely wants to believe you are wrong and will push that personal agenda.

He is, at once, the single most important aspect of this game and its biggest detriment because of his extremely thin tolerance of other views.  I recommend the game, but the dev is not a nice person.",1479666713,1479672268,True,43,4,0.732417821884155273,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Just having finished the second world in basic (no DLC) it is definatelly one of those games that eats time.  Sometimes it is just redesigning the logistics chains, sometimes it is waiting for research/smelting/manufacturing, and sometimes you are lost in deep caverns and swear the path home is just around here somewhere...

As many other reviews have stated, it is a voxel game so it looks like many others in the genre, but definately has it's own place as a hybrid explorer/builder/tower defense.

Playing it will require you to plough through any of the inevitable boredom or irritation you will likely initially experience. I wouldn't be surprised if only 1% of the people who bought this game played over 10 hours. If you consider yourself a tolerant and patient person, and loved factorio, then perhaps this is a game for you. You may even love this game as I did. I would especially recommend it on sale.

If you do decide to buy this game, I recommend watching some playthroughs on youtube, specifically Tango Tek or direwolf20. They are both entertaining and provide a great tutorial of at least the early-mid game. Enough to get you started. But yet again this comes down to the effort you are willing to put in. If you have a life rather than a sinkhole of hours, this game is not for you. I very much enjoy this game, but the game suffers numerous flaws.

I'm going to say what I didn't like about the game, as I feel it would be more useful to the reader. Main points are emboldened, so just read those unless you want some detail.

-- [b] Lack of a proper tutorial [/b] --
You start with a bad joke of an unfinished tutorial which is totally unbefitting of a game as complex as fortresscraft evolved. There is a LOT of material you need to get to grips with, while the tutorial shows you the basics in as minimal a way as possible.
Granted, there is a brilliant help mechanic known as contextual help, showing you suggested items found at your stage in the game, selected hotbar items, current research etc. I found this essential on my first playthrough, and it's more helpful than I feel I'm making it sound. However as useful as it is, it much feels like dragging my eyes through page after page in a sort of wiki. This game has a [b] HUGE [/b] learning curve. It really just needs a proper optional tutorial.

-- [b] Game is Buggy/Unpolished [/b] --
This game is very raw and has quite a few bugs. It should certainly still be in early access. Some even accuse the developer of trying to get more sales through an incomplete release. All the 'little things' that fill out the detail in a game and give it life often just can't be found, which I believe is due to a complete lack of motivation when it comes to the developer refining such aspects.
The UI is quite ugly. There aren't any sorting algorithms in inventory. Item transfer to storage is poor, totally manual, and tedious. Animations are short, or non-existant; dying in every way will result in a message popup on screen before you respawn. Alien attacks consist of 3 (sort of 4) enemy designs, (most of which you won't see for a very long time), all fairly basic and all essentially only feature variations in health; a total lack of effort in that field. There are about 7 enemy creatures in total. Progression is a little erratic, which I pin to bad design. You can see through unloaded chunks in the game and see certain objects. The game has placeholder items that do not yet exist. Crafting recipes that are 'to be removed'. Some items are missing icons. Game progression is clunky and non-uniform. This game should NOT have been seeing a release for quite a while. 

-- [b] Gameplay and progression is slow, unintuitive and erratic [/b] --
This game is entirely about gameplay.
That said the gameplay in this is so slow that it's comparable to a civilisation game. This is not a bad thing in itself, but the game is not entertaining enough through all portions of this time. The main reason this game takes so long is the learning curve, but also the complexity of the game. If it were employed correctly, this complexity would be a delightful thing. Some of the complexity of this game could be considered to be filler, 'fleshing out' time where it doesn't and shouldn't really exist. Looking into what's been [partially implemented/recently introduced] into the game so far, it looks like this isn't going to improve. The game is also a little asymmetrical in terms of its progression. Certain things will be required to progress, which may depend on luck, and can be infuriating, especially given how unintuitive parts of the game are, and how there can be missing information that should be in the game, or on the wiki, etc. For example, organic rock and the smelting bottleneck. Perfect eyes as the T3 (and T2 and a half) barrier and hardened resin. These examples are those on luck. It should also be noted that in my playthroughs I've been quite fortunate, recieving comparatively large ore veins so that I had to do less restructuring and relocating in between other tasks. Others may not be as fortunate and may have to spend time backtracking in addition to the awkward progression. Certainly no fun when you're waiting on resources for conveyors. A positive element of the gameplay would be the tower defence, which I quite enjoy and wish there was more focus on, providing a logisitcal challenge, and later even a minor tactical one. There is an emphasis on efficiency in general in this game, which means it can be quite rewarding of good ideas and consideration to the mechanics. 

— [b] Graphics [/b] —
The game is generally quite ugly. Very little emphasis on visuals and even less on visual effects. Some effects may look quite cool, and some machines unique, but the rest of the game in general just looks bad or plain.
However my beef here is with the lighting system. It makes everything look completely crap. Bloom everywhere where you place lights, or during the day, and total pitch black darkness everywhere else anytime else. This area really needs some work.

-- [b] DLC, the dev and the community [/b] --
While nowhere near as bad as say... Payday 2, DLC is certainly starting to become a noticeable concept within this game, which can only barely be considered complete. they're even selling skins for your character at this point in development (despite being first person). A full display of the dev's priories.
The community is toxic in some spaces. It's like a stream of people with the attitude of professional youtube commenters come for a ride on any fortresscraft forums. Lots of baseless hate. Some pretentious arseholes. See other reviews for more detail on that. Dev is sometimes a bit of a dick himself where he can get away with it.

I'd love to see more games settle in this genre, it's generally fun, but poorly executed in this case, maybe because of the small idea-pool. Overall community response to dev and communication with the community from what I've seen is displeasing, despite the game supposedly having been in early access. Maybe someone can pick up the baton, perhaps even the dev, even if only little further.",1478824819,1478824841,False,34,3,0.683187782764434814,1,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Pro:[/b]
[u]If you like building things and seeing stuff work then you owe it to yourself to buy this game[/u].  The game also has an interesting tower defense side to its gameplay where part of the stuff you build needs to be geared toward taking down waves of angry bugs which increase in strength as your power usage increases.  The workshop mods also offer interesting options to tailor the game to your liking.  I.e. if you hate worrying about inventory space there is a mod for that.. or if you like building stuff but dont want to go for full automation you can get a mod to have much bigger hoppers.

[b]Cons:[/b]
For me, the UI was not built the way I default assumed the controls should work.. however, it turns out the developer put alot of thought into how to setup the UI to allow you to build some really complicated stuff and I found that the more I played the more I was totally happy with the UI choices.

There are some points when I first started the game where I didnt know how I was supposed to proceed.  With the help of google and the very friendly game forums these were often quickly resolved.

[b]Why all the drama...[/b]
There are alot of reviews focusing on the personality of the primary developer and things he said in this place or that place.  Frankly, I couldnt care less if he insults everybody or offers a massage with a happy ending.  Its irrelevant.  The game is fun, and I found it rediculously worth the price.  I did not buy it because I needed a new friend and hoped the dev was that guy.

Langtext:
Tiebra Nachtwind und ich spielen nun bereits seit über 100 Stunden FortressCraft Evolved.
In unserer neuesten Lets Play  Staffel (03) haben wir nun auch das DLC: Frozern Factory installiert und befinden uns nun auf einem Wissensstand der es uns erstmals erlaubt die Anfangsphase unbeschadfet zu überstehen.

Was mich auch gleich zum einzigen negativen Punkt des Spieles bringt: Tutorial gibt es nicht, Guide und Hilfe bringt einem nicht immer zur gewünschten Lösung des Problems. Die Anfangsphase des Spiels gestaltet sich sehr schleppend und oftmals scheitert man aufgurnd fehlender Informationen.
Erst wenn man eine halbwegs brauchbare Energieversorgung und ein ortdentliches Fördersystem entwickelt hat holt einem das Spiel ab und man geratet in den typischen Sog aus Erkundung, Forschung, Produktion usw.

Der Beginn des Spieles ist eigentlich wie bei allen Survival/Sandbox Spielen, man beginnt mit weniger mehr als dem eigenen Körper und erwirtschaftet sich alles selbst. Während jedoch bei den meisten Survival Games Attribute wie Durst, Hunger usw. eine große Rolle spielen wird bei FortressCrafdt der Schwerpunkt auf die Industrialiserung gelegt.

In den ersten Spielestunden baut man einige Erzförderanlagen und einfache Produktionsstraßen um sich eine erste kleine Base  zu erwirtschaften, was sich noch sehr übersichtlich und einfach gestaltet.

Spätestens wenn man jedoch soweit ist, neue Forschungen im Labor zu betreiben wird es schlagartig komplex und fordert den Spieler immer weiter.
Der Suchtfaktor und die Langzeitmotivation ist aufgrund der zunehmenden Komplexität immer höherer Technologien und dem damit verbundenen Auffinden neuer Ressourcen extrem hoch und anhaltend.

Wir freuen uns bereits auf die vielen Neuigkeiten und Überraschungen die uns Frozen Factory bieten wird, denn ohne zu sehr zu spoilern: wenn man glaubt man wäre sicher, kommt der Untergang auf leisen Sohlen. ;-)

Pro:
Grafik: Für eine Spiel im Minecraft Blöckchen Stil sieht es eigentlich sehr gut aus.
Bedienung und Steuerung: fühlt sich sehr flüssig an und nach kurzer Einarbeitung läuft alles wie geschmiert
Wirtschaft, Industrie und Logistik: nicht die Komplexität von Factorio, aber trotzdem motivierend
Gegner, Action, Kampfsystem: KI ist nicht gerade die intelligenteste...
Gegnerdesign: ohne zu spoilern, freut euch über ein paar wirklich gute Ideen...""Hivemind""

kontra:
langweilige Anfangsphase
Produktionsabläufe und Zusammenhänge muss man sich großteils selbst erarbeiten.

beste Grüsse

(If you didn't get that: Fortresscraft Evolved is a 3D Factorio.)

It is complex and requires some patience/time to get the hang of things but, once you do, it's a blast. You go to sleep thinking about how you're gonna automate the extraction of ores, how to optimize power distribution, etc., and wake up eager to put your ideas in practice. If you are not afraid of some hard work and like figuring out how to make things work efficiently, you're probably gonna love this game.

It also must be mentioned that this game is being done (you could say it's still in Early Access, there's a lot of content yet to come) by a single guy, which is baffling.

----------

I'm going to adress some of the points raised by most of the negative reviews to try and set your mind at ease in case you are considering buying Fortresscraft Evolved--and because I believe this game deserves much more praise than it seems to be getting:

1 - It has some rough edges indeed (a few Help texts missing, some not quite clear, conveyor belts blinking every now and then, the Spiderbot getting stuck, ...) but they are all minor issues. All the machines and everything else that matters works perfectly. Since the game is being developed by one person, I think that's forgivable and his priorities make sense.

2 - The UI is not beautiful, but you get used to it really fast and it fulfills its purpose just fine.

3 - The tutorial kinda sucks indeed (you gotta take a look around your base to spot some signs telling you what to interact with and how) but it gives you the basics and its extremely short (I hate long ones.) A small message will pop up on the top right corner of your screen after the mini-tutorial is done to suggest you what to do next so you don't get lost. If you keep an eye on the help-box on the lower left corner of the screen when you point at something, and check the Help Book when needed, you can figure pretty much everything out. (Land your pointer on any item in your inventory then press H and said item will show up on the top of the Help list... I think it's neat how that works.)

4 - Some claim the Dev is an A-Hole. Well, I never talked to him directly nor anything but I've seem him answering appropriately and politely to every single Steam-forum topic/question I looked up. The guy seems to work a lot and hard, apparently answers every single question about his game personally and who knows what else, and we, players, can also be annoying with our requests/demands/suggestions quite often so... I think the guy is doing the best he can, I didn't actually see anything that made him look like a jerk.

5 - I read about performance issues. I, myself, have an average computer and run Fortresscraft with fixed 60fps and never had any issues other than the eventual crash (rare, about 6 in 70 hours playing so far.)

6 - ""The DLC policy."" Okay, this does suck at first glance. The game is not really finished and there's already a DLC. When you are playing, your research one tech tree or go down to a certain layer of the underground and realize you can't mine these ores because you don't have the DLC, or can't build some of the stuff you just researched for the same reason. It pissed me off too--specially because nothing warns you you need the DLC to do this or that, it's just there like everything else and then... you can't do it (and that's the worst flaw in the game for me.) But then I went to take a look at the Devs writings and some other stuff and... well, the game sells well during sales, but not so much in between them. The guy needs money, like everyone else. But the thing is: he deserves it.

I was playing and run into the problems I just mentioned. I quit it to check on the DLC and wonder whether I should get it or not (not on sale, and it costs 30 bucks here in my country while it must be 10 or so for Americans... and our wages are lower as well so I'm paying, essentially, about 6 times more for it.) Well, long story short, after I read everything I did (the Dev's Patreon page, the spread sheet with his schedule for future updates, ...) I just came back and got the DLC, for the reason I said above--I believe the guy deserves it. Fortresscraft is a great game but, sadly, its sales rate doesn't do it justice. So I'm helping him out by buying a buckload of content with the Frozen Factory expansion (only one other game ever inspired me to help out, and that was Tales of Maj'Eyal.)

7 - Most of the other complaints seem to be mistakes. People who couldn't find a certain item, or figure out how to decently farm a drop, or where to find something else. I had no problem of the sort--it's all there. In the worst case scenario, you can Google it and you'll find the solution.

----------

So, summing up: Fortresscraft Evolved is great fun and pretty solid for a one-dev game. If you get it (and I recommend you do) I suggest you get the DLC as well. If you don't, by the time you need it you'll realize it's worth its price and probably end up buying it anyway, like I did.

And don't be intimidated by the game's screenshots. Fortresscraft Evolved is intricate, but it's not that garish fanfare they make it seem to be--unless you want it, of course, but it's totally NOT necessary.

----------

One last detail: you can become a ""Patreon"" by donating 10 bucks or so monthly to the Dev (so with the steady income he can hire a 2D and 3D artists to help him out.) Patreons get some aesthetical bonus items and beta-access to new stuff.

----------

EDIT: Ok, now that I sank some 200 more hours into the game, I gotta say you spend a lot of time just waiting for resources to pile up--and by ""a lot"" I mean about 2/3 of the time.

The base game ""ends"" when you charge the OET (Orbital Energy Transmitter or, as I like to call it, the Over-Exaggerated Timewaster.) Anyone who played 150 hours or more spent about 100 of them just piling up resources to have enough power to charge this thing and defenses to survive the non-stop, overpowered waves of monsters that come when you actually start charging it. If you manage to do everything right (enough power, enough defenses) it's gonna take you about 10 hours to charge the OET once. You gotta do it 4 times. You just sit there, waiting while it charges, because there's nothing left to do until it does.

After that's done, you get into the DLC (if you have it, of course, which I do.) At first it's fine, then it starts to get a bit grindy once again, until you are finally able to build a machine called ""The Magmaborer"" which is to the game's expansion what the OET is to the base game. But, doing some quickly calculations, it turns out it's about 25 times worse than the OET. I closed the game--and never went back to it--as soon as I realized that (the OET itself has already been the biggest time-waster and the most artificial game-time increaser I've ever seen in my life.)

That stuff needs to be balanced.

Nonetheless, when you're actually PLAYING the game, it's great--so my positive recommendation stands. Even with the OET crap and the Magmaborer even-crappier crap, I'm still glad I bought this game (and the DLC as well.)",1478345840,1480155992,True,2,0,0.494386136531829834,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pretty much everything about this game is really good. It's fun and me and a friend played it multiplayer and absolutely loved it for about 4 days. So why thumbs down? Well there is one huge flaw that I just can not get over.

In order to progress beyond a certain point in the game you need an item called a Perfect Faceted Eye. It's a drop you get from killing creatures in the game world, or supposedly get from creatures in the game world, me and my friend found none after more than four days of game play. No matter how many slimes, wasps and or other creatures we killed we never got this drop. We tried multiple worlds, increased our threat level, built slime magnets, killed everything in site for hours and hours and hours and still no drop. The problem is you need at least a few of these items to mine crystal and without getting any in drops you can't even get to the point where you can manufacture your own. Crazy huge flaw, feel like I wasted my time and money, should have multiple ways to get this item and or mine crystal and without it you pretty much hit a giant wall that you'll never be able to get around. Tutorial is a little weak too, like for the longest time I was possitive that you could not add items to the hopper. I was amazed when I found out it was the T key. LOL, no drag and drop option like everything else you literally have to select it in your hot bad, face the hopper and press T. A little funky but not enough for it to be a problem. Fix your drops and I'll come back and give you a better rating. Until this I honestly can not find myself recommending this game to anybody.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that if you look online this is clearly a problem that a lot of people are having and is something that isn't taken seriously by the developers or the community for some reason. I can only guess that most people are not having this problem but after 70+ hours, my friend having played 190+ hours, and after receiving every other type of drop except this specific drop shows that there is a problem with this game.

As far as I can tell, if you read the most helpful negative reviews, you'll find everything I would have said myself (lack of game presentation polish, business practices, rude developer and rude close followers of said developer). Even the ones that are a little aged at this point still ring true in a lot of ways.

A lot of people compare this game to Factorio for its similar logistics puzzle/mining and refining automation premise, and to Minecraft because they both have a ""blocky"" world that you can dig around in, I guess. If you liked Factorio, then I feel that these are the main differences you should be aware of before you try Fortresscraft out:

-While Factorio is much looser in how it handles player progression (It's there but you don't really have to follow it very closely), Fortresscraft has a far more linear progression path in general. Sure, you can expand your mines, or your filter systems, or anything else when you want to, but the developer has a very strong vision on what he expects you to be doing at X point in the game, and the game is made to remind you of what you should be doing at any given time. Constantly. You may like it, you may hate it. I grew to dislike it, and you can thankfully turn some of it off, but not all of it.

-Unlike Factorio's two dimensional world, Fortresscraft incorporates a third dimension into gameplay. This is probably where the Minecraft comparison comes into play. You can build into the sky or dig into the ground for what looks like far longer than it would take to hit any sort of world border, but you should know that there's nothing in the sky (that I know of), and that after a certain depth, there isn't really a point in digging deeper (that I know of).

-Fortressscraft is far more complex than Factorio. Sometimes this is interesting and adds some fun to the equation, but there are other times where it feels like needless padding of gametime being moved onto the player. There are a lot of machines that craft one item, and only one item. Some of these machines aren't very used either, just collecting dust until the off time you want it to craft whatever it crafts.

While the differences between the two games are largely subjective tastes that you may love or hate, here are some cons that you'll see in many other reviews:

-The UI, while often displaying a lot of information to the player, is often unintuitive in how it displays this information, and in my opinion can be quite ugly. It also often lacks basic convenience features found in many other games, such as the more common stack management keybinds. Be prepared to click and drag your items a lot.

-Progression is slow for anyone new to the game, or anyone not interested in busywork. There are many systems in the game that function at a snail's pace until you sink in the time and effort to expand your mining or logistics systems considerably, and it often feels like an artificial means of padding the game's gameplay hours for marketing purposes. While some of the information is there, a new player is probably going to have a rough time learning the game's complicated and often nuanced systems. The in-game documentation can help, but seems to often be written from the perspective of someone who already knows the nuances and doesn't really see why they need to be explained, in my opinion. This attitude shows in bright colors if you try to ask for help on the forums, and that's not really just in my opinion. More on that below.

-While there are some very nice and helpful people in the general community, you're going to get very familiar with the same gaggle of people who seem so passionate about the game that they come off as passive aggressive, snarky or downright rude. A quick browse of the comments in the review section will show you about a dozen of them. Unfortunately, this attitude is often demonstrated by the developer himself. If you're coming in expecting baseline respect and consideration for you as a community member, or even as a paying customer, you should prepare to be confused and disappointed, especially if you have any questions or constructive criticism of the game. Replies include ""Maybe you just don't have the IQ for this game :)"" and ""Well, it was obvious to me, so I don't see a problem with how it's presented"". There's a small book that could be written on this point, but I won't get that deep into it.


TLDR: I don't really want to rant any longer, so I think I have a nice summary of my feelings about this game. In a word, I feel it's all about patience. The game was fun to me after, and only after I was patient with the game's unpolished presentation, the unituitive in-game help system, the pretty steep learning curve that's partially caused by the lacking tutorial/in-game help and the deplorable help often received on the forum, the clunky control scheme, numerous naggings to do exactly what the developer expected me to do in the game, the abysmal way I and others were treated as community members and customers by the developer and his followers, knowing little to none of the concerns or criticisms of the game would ever be taken seriously by anyone not paying into the developer's Patreon, and finally, the clear financial infleunce the developer's refusal to get a job to support the game has on the game itself. The game is still definitely in early access, and being ""released"" was to get more sales. It means absolutely nothing for the game's state. There's work done on the base game still, but the game's clearly going to be sold in DLC parts now. Frozen factory is a huge part of the game and it's looking like there's another DLC release coming soon. No game should be unfun until I'm patient with it and the aspects related to it for a number of hours.

Finally, to the four followers and the developer who are undoubtedly going to thumb down and debate this review in the comments like children, I'm just going to tell you now that you shouldn't bother. I have the IQ for the game. I know how to play. I muscled through the crappy tutorial and the crappy UI and watched video after video teaching me what I should've been taught in game. I loved Factorio, so this ""genre"" is for me. I actually enjoy the idea of a more complicated, more content rich Factorio in three dimensions. What I don't enjoy is how this idea was implimented in Fortresscraft. There's too many valid criticisms that are just being ignored, and often openly ridiculed for being provided.

Fortresscraft could've not only been as good as Factorio, but it could've easily been better. It feels like such a wasted effort to me, and the fact that Factorio has over 10 times as many concurrent players than FC is completely understandable, not to mention an all time peak that crushes FC's. That's not even mentioning that Factorio has a standalone client off of Steam and it's only been on Steam for a relatively short while, so it's even higher than that.

But hey, I'll just take the wise advice I've seen given on these forums. ""Haha. That's great. Please by all means take your attitude elsewhere. We have no need of it here.""",1478028305,1523572946,False,181,5,0.796185076236724854,29,True,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay seems to be and tedious and not intuitive. Most of the time you just run somewhere, do 2 scans and then go back, because energy in your suit runs out almost immediately. Its annoying and terrain is boring.

Graphics is similar to minecraft and yet after awhile, you feel dead inside, just from looking around.


I did not get to the part with automatization, which seems to be main point of this game, so i could fit in two hours for refund. Just basics, seemed to be logical enough to understand. Just conveyor belts had some issues for me, trying to connect, because up and down conveyor belts are different blocks and look too similar, when i was trying to place them.

It might be playable, if some improvements to graphics, gameplay and especially big improvements to tutorial are made.

The game is mostly about resource gathering, processing said resources and the infrastructure between. The game is slowpaced, it WILL take time before you have everything set up as you like it and even then you are very likely to rebuild it later as you figure out better ways to do things. It will require quite a bit of thinking ahead and possibly a few world restarts once you reach a point in your current world where rebuilding everything is just too much of a hassle. 

Each restart will be much easier than the last though as you learn more tricks. What took you 2 hours before, may now take 30 min and when you have played for quite a while not even that long. The time it takes to do stuff is usually down to player skill, be patient and you will get a lot from it.

If you do decide to stick around for the first 10 hours, you are very likely to play at least a 100, and that is without the DLC Frozen Factory (have a look at the positive reviews, most have well over a hundred hours play and still haven't run out of content). For 13 euros this game is definitly a bargain.

A common complaint about this game is that it feels like Early Access with all the updates. Do note that the game has had a working end goal for well over a year and hence can be considered complete. The larger part of each update is also available for free, no paywall here unless you've already spent said 100 hours and want at least 50 more. There are a few bugs, but hey, you just spent a dinner for two and the bugs will disappear at the end of the month.

And lastly as I said this game may turn you off quite quickly, please have a look at lets plays before you consider buying and if you do, you won't regret it.

[u]1.) Lighting:[/u]

The lighting system as it is currently implemented is completely broken.  Bloom effects are amped-up through the roof while ambient/""natural"" light is nonexistent, making this a very dark game - such that it is borderline unplayable.  I cannot begin to describe how difficult it is to see anything while playing.  Reference the attached images and judge for yourself:  

[url]https://www.dropbox.com/sh/esvp0oxvj0acs7v/AACsUL_dAlfPxAZReeVmVO2ea?dl=0[/url]

Depicted is a subsurface coal vane about 1-2 blocks below the surface that has been exposed.  One screenshot shows the coal in natural light, the other with a flashlight directed at it on maximum power.  Also included are screenshots of various tunnels being illuminated by a flashlight on maximum power.

[u]2.) User interface:[/u]

There are very few user-configurable audio or video settings.
 - No brightness/gamma control
 - No UI scale control
 - No key binding (must exit and change within the Unity launcher)

In addition, the control scheme is extremely awkward.  It is completely alien to that of any other game, including Factorio and Minecraft.

[u]3.) Save time on shutdown:[/u]

For some reason, this game implements a savefile compression system that activates after you confirm that you want to exit to desktop.  This system will operate for well over a minute before allowing the game to shut down unless you cancel it by clicking ""exit now"".

[u]4.) Sound design:[/u]

The sound design in this game is a bit of a let-down.  It tries way too hard to be a blend of retro-futuristic bleeps, bloops and machine sounds, but ends up sounding more like a bunch of stock files that were tweaked in Audacity.  This is not a deal breaker by any means, but it really helps to make this game feel like a cheap one-off.  (The main menu alone contains audio elements that pop and crackle as they move around, and at least one horribly obvious 60Hz ground loop.)

I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone.  I was very hesitant to try it based on the other negative reviews below, but I purchased it for ~$12 w/ DLC nonetheless at the recommendation of a friend.  I will be refunding this title immediately.

Caveat emptor.


To the developer(s?):  The main problems with your game are not related to lack of features or content.  Your game is [u]desperately[/u] in need of usability refinements and technical polish.  When it comes to your UI and lighting systems: Instead of trying to defy convention at every opportunity, take a few hints from other games that have been massively successful.  In addition to everything mentioned above, focus on the little things that make a huge difference - like placing ""tutorial"" elements into dialog boxes, instead of floating them above peoples' heads or behind machines where they will never be seen.

The game is far from perfect. There are bugs and annoying things. However, the dev is constantly working on it (and if opt into one of the branches you get nightly updates).

In the course of a year, the game will seem like a completly new game with all of the the additional features and content. Yes there is DLC, but there are still free content updates as well. However, even if there was not, you are more than getting your moneys worth with this game.

I find it rediculous how peopel will hem and haw over buying this when it is on sale to like $5. If you like the game you get 100's of hours of gameplay (Many players get 1000's of hours). If you don't like it, you are only out $5.

The fanbase is supportive enough that many people donate to the dev through Pateron. This is one of those games (like Dwarf Fortress) that will continue to be in development for years.

FortressCraft Evolved is like factorio mixed with minecraft.  With all the cons of both.

******************************************************************************************
Complexity
******************************************************************************************

Factorio gets its complexity through simplicity.  FortressCraft gets its complexity through complexity.

Factorio has these eight raw resources: wood, coal, iron, copper, stone, oil, water, alien artifacts.  Very different and used for different ends; of these most everything is done with: iron, copper, oil.  Simple, it becomes complex as your create new resources.

FortressCraft has 14 (? by the wiki) ores alone, each one can be turned into plates, wires, coils, pipes, and PCBs.  It also has 13 (?) other resources which you find, they can be very hard to find based on your starting seed. (Organic Rock I am looking at you).  FortressCraft also has 11-13 (?) items dropped from mobs that you need to collect.

I will start with my frustrations with organic rock.  You need organic rock to make smelters, why? I have no idea.  Organic rock is sometimes found in caves.  Caves are dark and cold.  You only have so much battery to keep yourself warm and the cave lit, so bring 1000 torches made from coal they provide light and warmth.  But don't stand too close or they will begin to overheat your suit, stand precisely something like 1.5 blocks away from it or it is worse than not having one.

The first time you look for organic rock it will be easier as you can scan for unknown objects, not all of them will show up but hopefully a couple will.  As a new player instead of collecting all of them you will likely be like, ""wtf is this weird thing, i'll scan it for the research when I get back.""  After this there is no organic rock scan to use later.

All this to make a couple smelters.  But smelters also require tin plates and Basic PCB (the copper ones) and all the dependent research.  See the problem.  Fortunately the game starts you off with one smelter you can use, that will deliver you the high throughput of 4 bars per minute at a 4:1 ore to bar ratio.  This leads to maybe being able to make a smelter within the first hour of playing.  Don't worry you will definitely be mining enough ore with the extractors provided. The game will constantly bug you to improve the extractors and also bug you that they are constantly offline as they are backed up. If only I could smelt all this ore.

You will be manually running around fetching ore for several hours as conveyors require a copper bar and a tin bar per square. 2 bars each, 2 conveyors per minute, need hundreds of conveyors to connect mines to smelters.

Then you need to build the machinery to make plates, wires, coils, PCBs.  Keep in mind storage is very hard to come by as hoppers are very expensive early on, so you can't just build a storage bin for each of these materials immediately.

Now you can make the research lab (if you didn't accidently spend all your research points on everything else and screw yourself permanently.)  The lab itself takes a lot of copper, but smelting copper is trivial right?  That isn't the problem with the lab though, the lab can consume 15000 power per second (pps) and the assembler can consume something like 500-1000 pps.  Up until this point power has been trivial, an extractor takes roughly 2 pps, the smelter takes somewhere around 5-10 pps.

Do not connect your lab directly to your central power hub, it will take all the power just to charge its own internal buffer.  

To combat this you need to make more power generators and energy lazers and probably make a new coal mine at this point, so while you are waiting on the metal to set this up, you are waiting on the lab to finish its research, also did I mention that about now you are going to get attacked, better build turrets.  Also did I mention that your lithium mine will probably have a bunch of plants eating all the ore on the conveyor you built, better build some more turrets and batteries and lazers to power it all.  But you need those for the lab too, better get more smelters going, but guess what your suit also needs all that power so you can find more organic rock without dying of hypothermia.  Also you can't leave your base because a bunch of wasps are attacking and they don't seem to stop coming and you need that lithium to build those batteries and the purple plants keep spawning and you need to shoot them too.

So you run around killing wasps, trying not to die from hypothermia, out of research points, making sure lithium isn't getting eaten, and collecting metal bars so you can hopefully do something is this silly game.

You have now been playing for ten hours.
******************************************************************************************
How it fails
******************************************************************************************
It is so hard to explain how needlessy complex and slow this game is.

To pull from minecraft and factorio, the furnace is made out of stone blocks.  It makes perfect sense, the limiting factor is how much ore I can find.  Which leads to needing more furnaces, which leads to more ore, etc.  It is an exponential that I want to ride up.

To mine something in FortressCraft it needs an extractor, lets assume we have those.  They need power, each one needs at least a basic laser of power.  Lets assume we have those.  They each need to have line of sight to that laser or have batteries to connect them all and the laser needs to be powered likely by another laser.

So what should happen is I run back and forth making this mine amazing and making my smelting amazing too.  But you are bottlenecked constantly.  Your new basic smelters will take 8 ore per bar, so we need about 4 extractors.  Which is 4 basic lasers, which is either going to be some crazy triangular setup to keep line of sight or you are going to need 16 ish batteries.  For each of the three basic ores, maybe more lasers for lithium as it is found deeper underground and more everything for copper as you will need a lot.

That many lasers just isn't going to happen early on so we will need to upgrade.  Good news there is a better type of laser available early on, the MK1 laser is 10x stronger than the basic laser.  So we can just point one in that direction easy.  Next the conveyor belt can only carry one ore at a time, so perhaps we need to use normal conveyors instead of basic conveyors but replacing the conveyor is being bottlenecked by the very smelting we are trying to upgrade.  So lets just smelt the bars right at the mine its an 8:1 throughput increase.

But each smelter takes a full MK1 beam of power, now you are running multiple MK1 lasers to your mine and you have the same problem you had before.  Plus smelters stop working at lower elevations (for some reason?).

FortressCraft is like 4+ seperate linear functions instead of one happy exponential.  And once you finally decide to stop increasing one of those functions none of the others can increase either.  For myself it was power for the lab, I just stood there feeding plates, PCB, and research packs into the lab for hours.  It was already running 10 power generators out of energy, even at that my 1 million coal mine was already draining faster than I would like.

It is always the same answer: There is a solution to that, that you can't make.  I can't even talk about how research works as I am out of space. Basically you scan unknown blocks, there are only so many unique blocks in this game.",1477697362,1479755806,False,15,0,0.497079908847808838,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a combination of automation, base building, and tower defense.  Before I get any further, I would like to mention that this isn't a fast game.  The process of getting started can be quite lengthy and there's a lot to learn, so if you're impatient then you may want to look elsewhere.  

There have been countless changes since I played the game back in '16.  I am in the process of playing it again now with over 200 more hours spent in game.  I still haven't finished building the devices needed to defeat the Overminds, but I'm taking my time to learn to automate more things.  Automation is key for this game, however the extent to which you automate is completely up to you.  If you played the game years ago, one of the first things you'll notice is that machines cost more to build.  This will force you to start automating and some people don't like it.  There are some reviewers who state the changes have ruined the game, however I disagree.  By using automation, you can build components necessary for machines while you're busy doing other things.  Some players will automate everything from power storage blocks to turrets and hoppers.  While this can make things easier in the long run (you don't have to stop to manually build, you can just grab and go), it isn't completely necessary.  Personally, I enjoy having things to do and that includes some manual building.  I tend to think that if you automate everything, you spend many hours watching everything run itself.  Some things, such as conveyors, coils, wires, and missiles should be automated, because you'll need tons of them.  

The process of learning efficient means of building/automation can be time consuming.  If you look on YouTube, the videos are years old and not very helpful with the game changes, however they may still get you started.  A fair warning though, some of the videos/screenshots of this game show six parallel conveyors going everywhere and dozens of machines.  Don't let these intimidate you.  Once you get started automating small amounts of components, you'll think of ways to increase production.  If you need help for learning what a machine does or how to use it, press H, which brings up the Help Screen.  There is an in-game tutorial which will help you get started learning the basics as well, something that wasn't there years ago.   Start small until you're comfortable, then build some more.  As you play, you'll see what components are most commonly used and then you can automate those.  

Tower defense, you say?  Yes!  Producing power, bars, etc raises your ""threat"" level.  Upon reaching 100, alien wasps will be sent toward your Central Power Hub, which is the device emitting a ray of light into the sky.  The more power you produce and the more bars you smelt, the higher your threat.  There are a couple of other variables which determine threat, but it's really not necessary to know.  As your threat increases, so do the number of enemies, until you reach a point where ""Heavy"" enemies will start to spawn.  After that, maybe around 5000, you'll start to get ""Boss"" enemies.  As you progress, you'll build defenses to prevent your CPH from getting destroyed.  Don't worry, though!  If your CPH gets destroyed it'll reboot and repair itself, ending the attack in progress.  This may happen dozens of times until you figure out what to do.  What's the point if it doesn't do anything?  Well, toward the end of the game you'll have to charge an orbital device with tons of power, which could literally take hours.  If your CPH gets destroyed during this phase, the device will discharge and you'll have to start over.  This is really late game so don't even worry about it.  When you start a game, you can set variables to make it more difficult, such as ending the game when the CPH gets destroyed, if you really want to do that.

I recommend leaving the power/ore options set to ""Plentiful"".  Even on this setting, the game will take a long time.  Don't let the Par times fool you, I think those are after multiple playthroughs, when you know what you're doing and where to focus your efforts.  I also recommend playing on ""Clumsy"" death, meaning you drop your inventory when you die.  It gives the game a bit of a challenge and makes you think twice before taking unnecessary risks.

TIPS:
-Don't dig straight down, make steps
-You'll go through hundreds of research pods, so automate those, even if you don't need them right away.  The orbital stuff late game will require over 1000 of several different types, plus refined resin.
-You have a Grappling Gun!  Press ""F"" 
-Spiderbot is a little janky but awesome!  He will really help with defense but requires charged lithium coils once you give him weapons - automate!
-Don't like the blue flares?  Change the color!  Throw a flare by pressing G, then press N to bring up the paint gun.  Right click and choose a color, I like white.  The flares should change to the color you select.  You can also color certain blocks and lights
-Laser Power Transfers will send power constantly, unless you press ""E"" to switch options.  The second option will only send power when the attached power block is full.  This is useful in certain circumstances but I don't want to give anything away.
-Come visit me and several other fans for help on Discord!  Search Fortresscraft Evolved. 

SPOILERS!!  Keep reading if you want some more tips, but be warned that there are some spoilers which may ruin some surprises or give you advanced knowledge, which may help reduce headaches early on!



-The enemies will spawn and attack out from the corners of your Central Power Hub, put defenses out from the corners!  
-If you hear a weird droning sound and then a splat, that is an enemy called a Tunnelnuker.  If there are hills, mountains, anything between your CPH and the Overminds (located far from the corners of your base, they're huge), the tunnelnuker will spawn and destroy the blocks, creating a clear path to your base.  CAUTION!  The nukers leave behind what is called soft resin.  There are huge worms that spawn when there is enough of the stuff and their attacks will kill extremely quickly.  You can manually clear out soft resin if it gets close enough to your base, but it's easier to use automated excavators to get rid of large amounts
-If you place conveyor belts below -80m, creatures will spawn on them and eat your ore, causing hiveminds to grow.  Those are the weird hard resin structures located on the surface.  If fed enough, they'll reach gigantic proportions, reaching up into the sky and over toward your CPH.  You'll need hard resin for the mid/late game stuff but don't feed them until you can process the resin.  Use MK2 turrets on power blocks to defend your conveyors.  Use the alternate laser power option to only send power when the block is at capacity, so the turrets maintain power.  Even ONE conveyor below -80m will spawn creatures
-FALCORs can be used to pick up parts from enemies.  The quality parts will remain longer while the bad ones will despawn quickly.  You'll need the quality parts to make lenses and other things.  Logistics FALCORs can be used to bring cutter heads to your excavators, which really increases efficiency so the ore veins last longer",1477654915,1575246960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Fortresscraft is only like 1/2 completed and you would think that this game is full release I think not. There is no Teir 4 or 5 ore useage in the base game which is a complete let down.

I will not be supporting this game development further.

As of 1/18/2018 Although I still play this game every once and awhile the removal of the soundtrack music from the game makes this game even more dull and boring to play. I would still stay away from this game. Now if we actually had some music rather then ambent sound it would feel a ton better to play. 
Side note a day later this game also doesn't have Borderless Window Options which is also a negitive.
A couple days after the side note I also noticed when removing rotors with the convenint click method that you lose the rotator which is a massive bug in a full release game that is unacceptable.

This is actually the first game where I really felt a compulsion to do so xD

I'll start with a simply pro and con list for a quick reference of what to expect, before I write a bit more about it:

+ lots of puzzle solving and planning ahead
+ game occupies your head even when not playing it (a rarity)
+ great sense of accomplishment when you see a personal project finished or succeed (I cheered when I saw my first Cargo Elevator come up fully loaded with Iron Ore, unloading it all on conveyors towards smelters)
+ graphics (may sound odd for a voxel-based game, but on the higher settings it has great lighting effects
+ a good intuitive 'rule-system' (the first 5 minutes is a tutorial which shows the very basic controls, but after that you will have to figure out all the rules on your own mostly, unless you want to be handheld the entire process by reading wiki's every 5 minutes. The ingame help encyclopedia (H) gives you just enough information at times, but doesn't give everything away thankfully).

- Occasional bugs (I only remember falling through a lift at times, or a lift only going up to 32m instead of 64m, though that was because I was playing the game on low-end pc at the time instead of my regular pc, if I read some comments correctly)
- Occasional freeze (mostly when doing multiple Coloured Ore pings too rapidly, probably my processor not being able to handle that though?)
- Annoyance of the constant wasp attacks, where at one point I simply stopped building Threat Reducers since they required too much power compared to what they delivered. Besides, the penalty for not killing the wasps was absent, you only lose your command module for a minute which didn't bother me that much, since most of my power came from other devices which were not affected by the Wasp attacks.

In short: Fortresscraft Evolved is an amazing game, really. I never played it's predecessor or any other 'Minecraft-clone' as people sometimes refer to these kind of voxel based games. But really, from all the MC vids I have seen, FCE really adds quite a few layers to that formula.

It's been a long time since I played a game that has me thinking about it almost the entire day long. 'How am I going to deal with this or that', 'What am I going to do next?', 'What's my next project going to be' are questions that occupy my mind the entire time, even during work or on the train home :D Now, that's the sign of a great game, if you ask me.

Apparently I actually bought this game during Early Access phase, but wasn't really impressed at the time (mid 2014). I only tried it out recently and it truly feels finished right now (and yet still it gets regular patches, the developer actively approaches the community for new ideas, etc.)

I think the best way to express why this game is so great is through a few examples, instead of writing too generically about it. Basically the entire FCE adventure is a constant chain of small puzzles that need to be solved in order to continue:

Last night I had just dug a second shaft towards a Lithium deposit, right next to an older shaft which had a Iron deposit I was already mining and sending upwards using a cargo elevator. These two shafts were only separated by a wall of 1 voxel wide. Within this wall I had also dug a 1x1 voxel wide column downwards to place the Laser Power Transmitters to send power deep into the earth (like the name says: these devices spread your power/electricity to remote places easily). However, this second shaft was right in between the bottom of the first shaft and the horizontal tunnel where I was mining the Iron. In order to keep supplying power to this horizontal tunnel whilst also delivering power downwards into the second shaft I had to fiddle around with batteries and Laser Transmitters in such a way that these devices were not in the path of either elevator shaft, yet still were in sight of the ore excavator at the end of the narrow Iron Ore tunnel. The solutions are often numerous, but each has it's up- and downsides. 'Do I dig an entire new shaft upwards just for these Laser Transmitters?', 'Do I widen the Iron Ore tunnel so I have more space for the batteries/Laser Transmitters to place inside the wall between the two elevator shafts?' or do I simply abandon the project altogether and find a new place to mine Iron. 

The answer to that last question is almost always: 'NEVER!'. You always want to find a solution, constantly analyzing the situation, figuring out the most efficient and best way to solve the numerous puzzles that you will be facing. And the beauty is: these puzzles are not bound by any hard limits (like most puzzles games, where you have 'levels' that you need to solve to proceed to the next) but they overflow in each other; the solution to one problem brings an entirely new problem with it! Or it might solve multiple problems at once! 

Also very important to acknowledge: You create your OWN puzzles! Everything you face is your own doing. You were the one that dug this shaft here. You were the one that decided to mine this Iron vein instead of that Iron vein. You were the one that decided to place certain machines too close together so that when you had to expand your base you ran out of room for lack of planning.

I could name more and more examples, but I think the above illustrated perfectly the feeling you get when playing this game. You either crave that sensation or you don't (basically if you have a logical, analytical mind you enjoy this game, if not...  stay away :P ).",1475146563,1476969595,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Eine Mischung aus Minecraft und Factorio mit einer Sciencefiction und TowerDefense Komponente.

Unfreiwillig gestrandet auf einem fremden Planeten mit nichts als einem kleinen Kraftwerk und eienr handvoll (vergleichsweise zu späteren sachen) primitiver Tools muss man versuchen zu überleben und eine funktionierende Produktionsbasis zu errichten. Die Rohstoffe dafür bietet der Planet selber. Angefangen bei Kohle über Kupfer, Zinn, Eisen bis hin zu Biomasse muss man sich nach und nach geeignete Förderstellen erschliessen um seine Basis zu Grösse und Wachstum zu verhelfen. Es gilt unbekannte materialien zu erforschen, neue rezepte für Maschinen oder nur Maschinenteile freizuschalten und Technologien zu erreichen. Immer weiter und weiter in die Tiefe neue erze finden/fördern/verarbeiten.
Den einheimischen Aliens scheint das jedoch nicht zwangsläufig zu gefallen und so kommt es, dass man sich plötzlich einem schwarm Wespen erwehren muss. also muss zusätzlich zum entstandenen Maschinenpark auch noch verteidigungsstellungen errichtet werden.

-Has a good chain of progression, so you can't just build the best stuff right away.
-There is always something to do, usually a long list of things.
-If you like building complex logistic networks of machines, you'll like it. It's funner than it sounds.
-Spiderbot is awesome, buggy, but awesome.
-The ""Build to"" function is incredibly useful

CONS
-If you don't like building complex logistic networks of machines, you'll probably hate it.
-AI is really stupid.
-Lots of clipping issues.
-There is no pause, so if your base is under heavy attack and you need to go to the bathroom, you can't pause the game.  You have to exit the game completely.
-Help file doesn't give you nearly enough information.
-Inventory sort by type option makes no sense at all.  If I sort by TYPE, I would expect all of my ores to group together, all of my bug parts to group together, all of my machines to group together, but it just seems like the sorting is very random.
-The organization of the crafting menu is very odd. It desperately needs a search feature.
-NO LONGER AN ISSUE - As you progress, the game gets buggier and buggier until large chunks of the level just won't load at all no matter how long you wait.  At this point the game becomes unplayable, which is really frustrating since I was getting close to beating the game.
-NO LONGER AN ISSUE - It locks up a lot and needs to be restarted.  This happens at least once an hour.

OVERALL IMPRESSION
-Despite its flaws, I really enjoy the game and there are plenty of mods to fix its shortcoming.

REQUESTS
-I would like to see hostile monsters in the underground caverns to make exploration more exciting.
-Lower the volume of the power storage cubes by at least 50%. That constant hum gets annoying after a while.
-Make the smaller enemies attack you if you get near them.
-Make it so you can delete the ship wreckage, maybe with the level 2 build gun.",1474241707,1622316870,True,0,0,0.620854794979095459,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I hoped this would be something of a cross between Minecraft and Factorio — and it is, kinda — but without the charm or appeal of either one.

The survival mechanics are cranked up to an excessive degree.  You're in a hostile environment, so your suit has to spend power keeping you warm (or sometimes cool), and also powering your light and your scanner and etc.  It recharges slowly during the day, but VERY slowly, and days feel incredibly short.

So at least in the beginning, you're going to need a recharge every couple of minutes.  That ties you to your central power hub, which the game states is irreplacable, meaning you literally cannot explore very far (or deep), nor set up base in a place of your choosing.

The grind is similarly cranked way up.  It doesn't just offer you automation, it forces it on you.  For example: While the ore smelter will take ore from (and put bars into) a neighbouring ""hopper"" (chest), there's no way to manually load said hoppers, as far as I can tell.  It wants you to use conveyor belts to automate everything, but conveyors cost tin and copper bars, which need smelting.  Just getting the initial conveyor network set up can be a royal pain depending on how far (and how uphill/downhill) your mines are.

Research is a total mess.  The game will happily let you research advanced devices without researching the components that go into those devices — like inventing the car before you've invented wheels and motors.  If those were your last research points … congrats, you're screwed.  At least until you find more things to scan — which might be impossibly far from your base without some basic suit upgrades, which you can't afford because you haven't found the materials, etc etc.

And finally, the graphics.  This might be a question of taste, but personally, I'm amazed they managed to take Minecraft and make it even MORE ugly.  Same blocky world, but with a very limited colour palette, almost everything in the dark, and constant snow.  Not pleasant.

I only played for a couple of hours — not long enough for enemies to show up, whenever that happens — but I simply wasn't having much fun.  YMMV.

Builders, perfectionists, architects & problem solvers - read on, this game is for you.

You toil endlessly creating complex systems to do some work for you so you can go back to toiling endlessly, but with a goal to achieve.  Sounds like torture?  Skip it.  Sounds like fun?  Buy it.

It's like Factorio got moved into MineCraft.  A 3D block environment where you dig and mine, but not to gather resources.  You dig and mine so that you can place down machines to gather the resources for you.  Then you build a transportation system to move those resources to your base to be turned into more machines.  So you can dig and mine deeper, to place more machines to gather more resources.  Thats the ""Craft"" piece of the game.

The ""Fortress"" piece is about defending against the waves of attackers.  Fortress isn't really an apt desription, I'd say its more of a camp with a heart that you defend with craploads of guns.  Again, you don't do the defending so much as your machines do the defending for you.  Granted, the waves of attackers are a bit simplistic - very much like the waves in a tower defense game, they mindlessly hover toward the exit (in this case not an exit, but the core machine in your base).  If they reach it, they attack and you 'lose'.

The game has several tiers, each reachable only by solving the previous tier; and a little bit of the tier itself that you're trying to reach.  Problematic enough to cause some frustration along with the satisfaction of having overcome that obstacle.  Several times as you try to get to the next tier, you find the machines you have access to come up a bit shy and you need to temporarily resort to doing things by hand again for the earliest parts of of 'leveling up' to the next tier.  How you go about solving it is all part of the fun, and there isn't just one right answer either.

This sort of problem solving, improving and perfecting is found throughout the game.  For me, it was an everflowing cycle of frustrating problems and dopamine reward.

This game is mind-blowing. I didn't play for that long (only around 300+ hours and i want a lot more), but what i can tell for sure: FortressCraft Evolved is addicting, amazingly fun (mostly because of your own actions), diversified and sometimes (logistically) challenging.

For me it has a good mix of gameplay pace, as it offers situations where you have to react fast (or let's say you want to be fast) and on the other hand you have relaxing base management, where you can think about your next ""project"" or just waiting for resources.

Furthermore the game gives you more than one moment of satisfaction. In fact you have a lot of small and big moments.

It currently makes an unpolished and buggy impression, which may be acceptable for an early access game, but not for a game that has been officially released.

For example, it took me several hours just to get my interface working. It turns out that the game seems to assume a 16:9 aspect ratio of your monitor. When I tried to load the game with my monitor's native resolution, which has a 4:3 aspect ratio, the interface was completely buggy. For example, windows were overlapping that were not supposed to, so that I could not see the entire interface. The game does not provide any warning when selecting an unsupported resolution.

Other bugs that I have encountered include items on conveyor belts not being rendered at all under certain conditions (thereby making them invisible) and turrets not firing at the enemy, but instead making jittery movements. Also, I have encountered several bugs in the user interface. Additionally, the game crashes frequently when doing certain things, such as scanning for ore.

Because this game has a great design and shows a lot of promise, I hope that the developer will fix these issues. Afterwards, I will gladly change my rating to a positive one.

Meanwhile, if you are interested in resource management games with complex assembly lines, I would recommend buying the game Factorio instead. Even though it is officially still in early access, it is already a lot more polished than FortressCraft. However, the main disadvantage of Factorio is that you are limited to two dimensions (i.e. the surface of the planet), whereas in FortressCraft you can also build in the third dimension, digging deep into the planet.",1472073464,1474805989,False,17,1,0.439176499843597412,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That being said lets go over some of my thoughts on this game


[b]Things that I like about this game. [/b]

Self contained machinery, automation, building, and resource gathering that plays much like a minecraft modpack based around a single tech mod. 

The graphics, while based around cubes for the terrain, is actually pretty good. It has vastly improved since I got this game a year+ ago. 

Caving is just fun in this game. There are massive cave systems that put other digger/builder games like minecraft to shame. Example, there is a cave with a ravine right next to my starting base that is almost deeper than the entirety of the building area minecraft allows (at least vertically). 


[b]Things I dislike/are Meh about[/b]

Some aspects of the game are rather grindy, even on the ""fast"" paced version. Ore collection and smelting takes time, and as you get later into the progression tree you unlock things to speed this up. 

Unfortunatly the cost to create everything also gets pretty high. 
Energy production is really small unless you are playing on the fast version, Solar panels are almost worthless unless you choose to have eternal day.

The ""expected"" time to reach the endgame (OET) is not bad, but the charge time is really long. Although this gives you a good reason to make a well fortified base!


Overall those detractor points are rather insignificant to me, as they just extend the time until I ""beat"" the game and then get bored. Heck.... I haven't even gotten to the end game yet and I'm almost 50 hours in! 

This game is well worth the money to me and DjArcas is great developer that is active within the community!

I watched the development for a long time even before I bought it. The main developer (and the team as well of course) are very nice. I watched many live streams on Twitch and within Steam. What I want to say, the developers and the community are very nice and polite.

After the first twenty hours of gameplay I still not finished the game. Just scratched the surface of what it can be and do. It is hell of fun (just like to see how everything works once set up and what is beneath the surface).

The price is quite fair (more than that), DLC prices are fair as well and these are really adding content (Frozen Factory i. e.). Other DLCs are just for supporting the devs wich is also very good done.

It isn't a game to sit back and relax, and it continuously keeps you busy, which can be exhausting at times.

In almost every game, I find myself wishing that X would be automated in some way. Such as, hiring bots, employees, or machines to do marketing, sales, shipping... whatever the task happens to be in the context of the game, and I'm invariably let down every, single, time. No developer has ever gotten this workflow right. In fact, some even argue that too much automation takes away ""work"" from the game. I've hand delivered X item to X person 100 times now; Why do I have to keep doing this same damn mission over and over Elite Dangerous? I literally can't hire a space mailman to deliver packages? I gotta do it myself? Jesus. 

Thankfully, FortressCraft: Evolved has none of that grindy crap and they did automation properly. I spent a 1100hrs playing this game. I've been on Steam for 6 years and never bothered to write a review before. You need to buy this game. 

The entire purpose of this game is to automate production. You build a machine that poops out other machines, which poops out crafted items. Automate all the things!! In one sense, that does make it feel like Factorio, and it has blocks like Minecraft. But boiling this game down to simply those observations shows how little you actually understand. FortressCraft has snap-to production building like Big Pharma and tower defense like Clash of Clans. Unlike Minecraft, there actually is a goal to achieve in FortressCraft. Quite simply, this is the best game of 2016 and I doubt you've played anything like it before. 

If there were any downsides to this game, I'd say it will take longer to win than you think it will. You will lose a few times because you don't know how much power all the guns take. So, you try to half ass it and get power. But, then you find out you need 10x power you though was required, and your production chain is a mess. So, you have to rip things up and move them around. Some  people don't like ripping everything up and redoing their base design. But, that's part of the experimentation and learning process everyone goes through when they play this game. 

The ""winning condition"" is to power the orbital transmitter, and the expansion goal is building a machine that will drill down to planetary magma. Pro Tip, you can not power the damn thing with just 10 generators you started out using in the beginning of the game. Don't be ""that guy"" who complains the game is taking days to power the Orbital Transmitter because you are using coal you found in the beginning of the game. 

If you find yourself complaining FCE should build products like Factorio, then the problem is that you are not automating properly. See, as long as you have the technology in Factorio, you can build products without setting up the proper production chain, and that's cheating. In FCE, you need to place the wire maker down, and supply it with copper, or you will have no wire. No Factorio style cheating here. What I'm getting at is that the game isn't badly designed. You are simply being lazy and spolied. If you can't be bothered to place your own machines and conveyor belts, then you can just go play any LEGO game where you mindlessly click on some self assembling blocks and be done with it.

Additionally, the limited graphic style of Factorio means it's all 2d. But in FCE, you build 3 dimensional. This creates interesting tasks to do for people that like to do things ""just so"" in a quest for perfection. The most inefficient automation is always better than manual effort, and multiple solutions will all work, so don't worry about perfection. The thing to remember is if the game feels ""tedious"" then you're not automating enough. Like if you find yourself shooting enemies with your pistol, that means you haven't built enough gun or missile defense. So, stop trying to gun down bosses with the god damn pistol. If all those guns you made drain your power, then guess what? Yeah, the next thing you need to do is build more power. In fact, it's the consumption of power that drives the game foward. More power creates more enemies, which require more guns, which creates more loot drops, used in machines which requires more power, etc.

There is enough stuff to do that you shouldn't be sitting there watching machines tick away. That's means you're wasting time. Yes, that landscape clearing machine does work slowly. It's supposed to. You're not supposed to sit there and stare at it like a tea pot. Give it power, and go do something else for ten minutes. Mine more coal, research something, harvest some crystals, and by the time you get done with that the base will be clear. This is what makes you fell like real game progress is being made. You will literally be absorbed into 10 things going on at once before the sun comes up. If you're bored because ""things take to long"" then what you need to do is multitask.

Unlike every other ""something-Craft"" game, there is no ""build order"" to follow by rote memorization, or a plan to spend your power efficiently. Such as; make 10 tin, then make exactly 2 hoppers, then make 2 lasers... No no no no. This isn't StarCraft. Consume all the power you can. When you run out, just build more generators. Build thousands of missiles, burn hundreds of coal a second. Consumption. This game is a consumption simulator. It doesn't matter that a quarry is less efficient than an excavator. Because the whole point of this game is to build all the machines, power them, and have them do stuff automatically! What I said will take the average player 100hrs before it finally clicks, ""Oh, build lots of everything. I get it now"".

The developer made sure you can play the game ""to the end"" without needing the expansion. The thing is, much like a Star Wars movie, you've just watched Star Wars, and your NOT going to see Empire Strikes Back... are you crazy? You have to see Empire!

It is basically heavily modded minecraft meets factorio.  You are in an open world / sandbox with lots of resources.  You can explore and exploit those resourcs similar in a manner to minecraft.  However, there are enemies which wish to destroy your base, so your resources go to teching up and building defenses.  Id love to see a lot more games like this.  I had a lot of fun, but I didn't finish it.  It does have its problems.

The good:
It is a wonderful minecraft like game and the designer does a lot of nice things that other games can certainly take a hint from.  For example, you can access any object at any distance as long as you can see it.  IE:  To craft things you do not need to walk to your crafting table, you just have to look at it to use it.  To pull stuff out of a storage system, just look at it, even if you are 60 blocks away, and you can access it.   Then you also get a grappling hook that lets you move around very quickly.  This is an invaluable too.   There are lots of technologies and systems to build.  

The Bad:
The documenation is terrible.  You have to spend research points and you only have a vague idea of what it is you are getting.  You also can research things early on that you can not build for a long time, due to tech requirments.  Also sometimes there are ""packages"" of research items where buying just one item is useless because you will need to buy 2 or 3 others to complete the set.  If you spend too many RP points, you may end up stuck (although ultimatly you can get out of this hole, but it can block you for a while).   

The tech tree is also just a mess and the organization on the build tab makes little sense.  Often I have to search for the item I want to craft because I have no idea what tab it belongs.    

The mechanics of how to progress and how to use things are often mysterious.  There is a wiki, but it is often out of date.  You shouldn't have to use an in-game wiki.

The ugly:
This game is grindy.  The designer just makes things take a rediculous amount of resources in terms of materials, power requirements and crafting time.  A good example of this is some machine that will take animal parts and turn them into some generic part that you can craft items with.  This machine takes a huge amount of power, and takes 5 MINUTES to craft 1 component.  You may need 20 to 80 components to craft some of the items you want.  So for 20, you are looking at 1 hour and 40 minutes.  It gets even worse, it takes 10 raw material to get 1 component.  And gets even worse, that these components will rot unless they are put in yet another setup that is also power hungry that extends their life time.  Its nuts.

That is just one example, there are others, like the 100 MILLION units of power needed to charge a certain object, that you need to do 4x.  With several stacks of turbine generators, it can still take like 4 hours per charge.  This isn't fun, its boring.  Many of the crafting recipies just require rediculous amounts of material for no good reason.


Summary:
For the price, the game is a great deal.  I had a lot of fun with it until the grind killed me.  Maybe Ill check it out again in 6 months to a year.",1470574916,1470784246,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Waited for the sale--although I try not to spend more than $5 on a game, I figured I'd go to $10 for that one.

When the steam sale came, it was the only game in my list that didn't go on sale.  With tears in my eyes I started looking at related games, the first one of which was FortressCraft

I was somewhat burned out on the Minecraft type games so I was reluctant, but on sale it was a good deal and looked interesting so I tried it.

LOVE the game.  I've spent way over 200 hours on this now. On top of that, I've recommended highly enough that another 6 copies have sold to my friends and family (Including at least a couple of the expansion).  I see a few of them on playing FortressCraft into the night.  I'll probably buy the expansion eventually at full price just to support the dev too.

If factorio had gone on sale (Or fortressCraft hadn't), I'd be playing that (But I'd probably be doing so alone since it's not available for the Mac like FortressCraft is).

Infelizmente muitas das analises negativas que esse jogo tomou é devido a inaptidão de alguns players de entender o jogo, realmente o jogo é muito complexo tendo como objetivo carregar o OET (transmissor de energia ) para poder destruir a overmind ( Monstro gigante) e parar com os ataques a sua base, porem como disse é muito complexo e é preciso pensar muito em como automatizar cada uma das funções, cada vez que você coloca uma maquina para fazer um trabalho que você fazia é um passo a diante.


pros:
- jogo complexo ( muitas coisas para fazer e maquinas para experimentar)
- atualizações constantes
-ideia unica (junção de sobrevivência + crafts + defenda a base)

contras:
- bugs ( como disse com as atualizações constantes isso se torna um pequeno problema)
- jogo complexo ( sim é um ponto negativo e positivo) muito difícil para jogadores casuais ou acostumados com os jogos da atualidades que te dão tudo na mão


CONCLUSÃO:

como disse é um ótimo jogo que tem muito potencial e com as atualizações fica cada vez melhor, se você gosta do estilo sobrevivência e tem paciência para aprender a usar as ferramentas e aplicá-las em uma linha de produção totalmente atualizada esse é o jogo pra você, agora se você é mais casual, procure em outro lugar.

And in that sense it's a good purchase. It has fairly unique feel to it and in the beginning the open world mantra of feel your way around to figure out how things work and what your goals are is a lot of fun.

In this phase you can overlook a lot of little things, odd interface for dealing with inventories, an apparent disdain for chests to the point of letting you hold 1000's of bars in your inventory. No RPG like interface to hold upgrades for your character ( which are essentially armor upgrades ) so they just sit in your general inventory. Tons of little visual and animation glitches that don't affect the game play. Some odd sound choices like your power storage ( batteries ) making a lot more noise than your generators, which leads to the odd situation where when you run out of power and your generators power up , it suddenly gets quite. 

But at some point all of these little things start to get harder to overlook and the game starts to change from fun to a grind that will have you leaving it running in the background while you do other things.

The big problem is near the end game, the design philosophy suddenly changes from one that provides fun and rewarding game play while designing your automation systems to one of forcing you into massive grinds. You are no longer automating for the joy of designing virtual machines or because you feel rewarded for doing so, but because the game forces a lot of pain on you if you don't.

In the end I don't regret getting the game, I had a lot of fun with it for a good amount of time.

Pros/Cons- Since game is still ""under development"" things may change drastically to the point where old setups will not function the same way. This can be a good thing if you like the challenge.

Cons- For inexperienced gamers this game may be a little difficult to get into due to (IMO) insufficient tutorials and guides. (Edit Tutorials and guides have been added/advanced)
        -If you're looking for a Tower Defense game wherre you can channel your enemies down a certain path, this is not one (enemies fly right through walls).

 Overall I would suggest you just try it out. It's not expensive and you can get 80+ hours of enjoyment before looking for DLC. And if you get to that point, the Frozen Factory expansion likely would add another 100 hours of gameplay (depending on skill level).",1469825154,1490717957,True,6,0,0.515936076641082764,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's not for everybody, it doesn't offer a steady dose of action packed mini achievements and it isn't something you just pick up and go, before you reach the end you'll have put in around 200 hours into it and it's said that the Frozen Factory expansion adds another 100. And that's not counting the time you spend outside the game planning your base if you're like me.

Most of the time in this game is spent building stuff and setting up elaborate pipelines so you can ... build more stuff. You can avoid the automation but then the game gets grindy, plus it's becoming harder and harder (both because of extra limitations to push people towards automation and because barriers to automation are removed so it's always the easier option).

The game isn't very hand-holdy. It purposely drops you in a situation with fairly little guidance outside of the first few hours and leaves you to your own devices. That said, recent changes like the mission system have made things easier by pointing out short and long term goals.

The developer is active and about once a month there's a big patch. Usually that means extra functionality too, new machines and/or new abilities. Often there are some nerfing changes that force you to rethink some things, a bit annoying at times but ultimately for the better (or so one hopes).

I've had this game since it was in early access and it has really gone a long way since then. Back then it was a nice demo which showed a lot of potential.

But then, you are trapped in a tutorial bubble, with the instructions to press E by some f#@$#$ing hub.

Ok there is a center hub thing, that has allsorts of other things around it, you can build and process things, and make power...

Neat! 

Well... WTF now?!?! Press E near the hub does not advance the tutorial..... Pressing E near the devices just activates them..... 


I have owned this game for over 2 years now, and have installed it 4 times. Each time I end up in the middle of WTF land.


I have no idea why they can not have a normal tutorial.... you know, go here, click this, do that,......

F#@#$#@$k no... You get to just walk around and be confused, constantly being nagged to press E to interact with a bunch of Sh!t that does nothing for you.


I can understand why this game is totaly unpopular, unpopulated, and unknown... It is because NOBODY has a f-king clue on how to play the god dammed thing.

It has nothing to do with fortress crafting or anything... it is all about being in a f-king bubble pressing E walking in circles , and playing like you are interacting with a bunch of cryptic crap.

Wish I had heard about this game sooner, I happened across it purely by accident while browsing around steam. 

I've played a lot of games and never come across something like this. I'd best describe it as an automation/crafting/logistics simulator, mixed in with a bit of Spider-man of all things!

The ""blocky"" look initially turned me off as I thought it looked too similar to Minecraft (which I have not played, mainly due to the low rent blockyness). Yes, the world is made up of blocks, but the similarity ends there - the textures are quite detailed, and while everything you craft/place in the world is using the same large block grid, the machines and other items are quite detailed and have excellent animations.

The game's premise is you have crash landed on an inhospitable world and must mine resources, research new technologies, and gain enough power to eventually escape. The open-endedness of this allows you to build up your base and production systems any way you see fit. It doesn't take long at all before you have a fairly complex system bringing in several types of materials from deep underground.

The whole experience can at first seem VERY grindy, but this is where the beauty really lies - in automating everything. Everything can be as automated as much as little as you like, and if you have the right materials over vast distances!

There is just so much to do at every stage it can seem overwhelimg - in a good way! The best games give you consistent challenges to overcome, with multiple ways to approach the problem, and this one has it in spades. The development cycle is very active and new things are being added all the time. If something is too easy or exploitable, its patched! As soon as you think you have a handle on things and start expanding your operations, digging deeper, or upgrading, new mechanics will come in to play to keep you on your toes.

You WILL die quite a bit, especially at the beginning - from falls or exposure to the extreme temperatures. As you buld up you will start to have waves of creatures attack your base, but at this time there is no real ""death penalty' or loss when your central base hub is destroyed. The inconvenience of either of these is more than enough of a deterrent however, and the attacks can apparently set back your progress on the end game run. It can seem a bit lonely, as the planet is generally devoid of any wildlife on the surface or anything that attacks you directly without being provoked. But there is multiplayer which I have not tried, but it seems like it could be a blast building up with friends.

That is where any similarities to that oft-compared ""other highly popular voxel-based game"" ends.  The point of FortressCraft is to build your base/machinery/infrastructure, and let it do the work for you.

You start out having crash-landed on a planet with with the most basic of machinery.  Your Central Power Hub to produce power, a research station to perform basic research, a smelter to smelt ore into bars, for use in the crafting station.  Selecting the easier resource difficulty levels will also give you a bonus coal deposit right near your CPH with the machinery needed to automate coal delivery right off the bat.

You then start finding resource deposits, placing extractors to mine from them, and collecting ore to smelt to then craft the machinery needed to automate that whole process.  As you discover different types of blocks, you can perform research to be able to craft new machinery to work faster or perform other tasks.  Once your basic research at the research station is all complete, you'll need to build a laboratory to continue higher levels of research.

Once you've got your infrastructure rolling along nicely, producing metal bars and power at a good rate, your base threat will increase to the point that the wasps start attacking.  Thus begins the tower defense aspect of the game.  You'll need to build a defense network to deal with the bugs.  And, of course, upgrade that network as your research and production levels increase, to deal with increasingly strong bugs.

The best part of this game, though, is the developer.  DjArcas is constantly adding new content into the game, and live streams development quite often.  A lot of game developers claim to be highly involved with their community.  And some even live up to that claim.  But Dj is the only one I know of that interacts with his community live on Twitch while he's writing the code for things that he's talking with the community about.  Many of the machines currently in the game are the result of suggestions made while he was streaming development.

If you like to manage those machines to get the most efficient designs, you'll like this game.  

If you're really into tower defense, you might be a bit disappointed.  There are a good variety of enemies, but generally all you do is build A LOT of guns around your base.  The only strategy that comes into play is keeping them efficiently powered through your machines.

To win survival mode, you really need to think BIG.  Expect some of your structures to expand 1,000 blocks away from your starting base (although the majority will likely be within 500 blocks).   A general rule that worked for me is whenever I first build something, I make sure to leave space around it to build 4 or 5 more in the future because it seems like you always need more than you expect.  You'll feel like you have a lot of empty space around, but by mid game you'll be wondering where all that space went.

One complaint I've seen people bring up is that they get bored waiting for materials to be crafted.  If you're bored, you're doing it wrong.

If you're sitting around waiting for research to complete - how about using that time to build more power generators to vastly improve research speed?  Don't have the materials to build more power?  Then go explore the world for new ore veins and build more machines to harvest it for you.  You have the tools and resources to build more mines and assembly lines to create more supplies than you know what to do with.

My only knock on the game is that a lot of information is missing from the in-game help.  If you want to learn many helpful tips that will take your base to the next level, expect to spend some time looking online or in the steam community pages for information.

The positive spin on this is that the developers are very active and are improving the game and adding new items/features on a near-daily basis so perhaps they haven't found the time to finish the help menu or aren't settled on the final stats of an item yet.

But i have underlined a few aspects of the game below. 

This game is really fun, but i have experienced many multiplayer bugs.. something i only intend to do with this product. as i would not like to play alone. 

The developers are responsive and are actively looking at their forums to fix bugs. i have adjusted my review to accomodate that. 

My summary for the game is good. lots of play time. but there are certain things that i think will be refined over time.. and i really hope that they do happen.. 

i have seen many games that the devs are not actively involved in. so i hope this isnt the case for FCE. because its complex. and diverse. 

The tutorial is a bit lacking. but apparently the missions are intended to slowly teach the player how to do things. 

is this game worth the money. yes.. you get bang for your buck. 
is this games multiplayer experience going to improve: we have to wait and see .

It's not that you die from cold if you stand around for too long, or die of heat if you stand too close to a heat source.  It's not that you regularly fall to your death or can't see the open sky above you when you descend down a big hole in the ground due to the Superman 64-style fog this game bafflingly has implemented.  It's not even that you can't craft anything useful by hand and have to build a bunch of one-off machines to do it for you (and you only have the resources to build one machine at a time, meaning you have to deconstruct your machine after each step and build a new one to complete the NEXT step.  It's not how the blocks don't stop enemies from moving through them, making every single block you put down decorative in nature - and it's somehow called ""Fortresscraft"". Heck, it's not even that the only enemy that can kill you is a weird octopus monster that doesn't move.  Not even how the game is broken and barely functional, but has paid DLC to put a top hat on your little floating robot man.

The worst part is the developer and his goons.  He rejects any criticism you give him, telling you that you're just playing it wrong.  Don't like the enormous nerfs and usage of one-off construction machines? ""That's just how the game is played, idiot"".  Don't like that you can't click on a chest and have a UI appear so that you can take and place items in it? ""you're doing it wrong, that's not my problem, that's not how it's done In ReAl LiFe"".  Ask a genuine question for help on a bug or an issue?  God help you, his toadies will blast you and call you stupid for not understanding the ""gEnIuS"" of this terrible game.

The last time I went through these reviews, I saw the same 3 or 4 names popping up insulting the posters who said anything negative about the game.  Look yourself - it's guys saying ""you're playing it wrong, this way is more efficient"" or even ""well REAL smelting facilities in REAL LIFE don't have smelters built underground, so why should they here?"" It is honestly just a bunch of fanatic fanboys going through the comments and saying ""you're all wrong and dumb, you're playing it wrong, stop being stupid and whiny"".  Infuriating.  The game is unfinished despite nearly A DECADE of development; the developer refuses to acknowledge anything other than praise; any legitimate questions about the mechanics are dismissed and you are implied to be stupid for not understanding this game; the dev is incredibly condescending to people who even so much as suggest that a feature is unbalanced or could use work and seems to take EVERYTHING incredibly personally; and his goons will dogpile you if you dare say anything negative.

I'm dead serious about that.  Go ahead, click through some more negative reviews that have replies in them.  Go on, do it.  The same 4 people are MOCKING reviewers and treating them like idiots for not liking part of the game.  ""that's not how it's done in real life"", ""god forbid you have to use a machine"", ""dId YoU rEaD tHe PaTcH nOtEs"", ""you're just too lazy to play it properly"", ""you're playing it """"""""""wrong"""""""""" "", ""smelting underground doesn't make sense in this game where slime monsters attack you and a giant octopus monster kills you in one hit"", ""I guess you left your brain behind"" to quote one specific fanboy-reply, etc.  Do you see them?  They're a bunch of weirdos who are OFFENDED you aren't worshiping the ground the dev walks on.  They're UPSET if you think a change wasn't good or that some aspect of the game could be better.  Instead of addressing your concerns, they insult you for having them.  Other game devs have commented on these reviews and said ""this is such poor practice, don't lash out when the players find a way to play the game you didn't expect them to"". I've even read multiple comments claiming that when the dev sees the score dip below ""mostly positive"", he sends his Discord goons out to bump it back up.  It's insane, and honestly pretty pathetic.

This game is terrible, unfinished, and the dev hates you.  Do NOT buy this game if you value your time.  I'd rather PAY to not have to put up with this game.

There is already dlc for it, one of which is an expansion that costs more than the original game.

I went into this game expecting to like it. For the first 30 seconds, the tutorial seemed very hand-holding which I liked for this game because after that, I didn't have a clue what to do next. After 22 minutes, I gave up and decided to try again later. Saving the game took about 2 full minutes; That's excessive. Came back the next day having no objectives. I didn't have any idea what I was supposed to do. Only after 20 minutes did it finally tell me what I was supposed to do. So I put ore in smelter thing and it just sat there. There was no on/off button to it so I thought, I know, I'll add power to it. There was no way to do that directly so I tried to add power to the central hub. My suit drained power but the machine didn't gain any. This had worked for me the first day though and continued to work for other machines. I decided to quit once more, saving seemed like it was going to take a while again(why is this even a thing? I'm not the only one with this problem), so I alt-tabbed, when I clicked on the icon to see the progress, it disappeared. I assume it crashed without errors.

The whole suit having power thing is completely stupid, it drains so fast. Literally running back and forth to the energy block thing(that fills up very slowly) after trying to mine twice which collects like 10 ore total. I don't know if this energy dilemma is a problem late-game but it's realllllly annoying at the start. Unless you can upgrade your character, which I didn't see a way to, I imagine that will always be a problem throughout.

Something I personally didn't like was the UI. The rainbow colors weren't pleasing to the eyes and the white font on top of it only made it worse. Very difficult to read.

Spending the first two hours trying to figure out this unintuitive game will be too much trouble for me. Maybe the game is good for all I know but it certainly doesn't start out that way and I'm sure it's part of the reason people will be asking for refunds.",1468503746,1468503746,False,13,0,0.546498894691467285,9,True,False,False,False,,,

It bugged me enough to not give the game a chance, and seemed more like a creative mode minecraft at the time with some fast building tools but I wanted a survival mode.  Uninstalled and didn't touch it again.  I believe that was December 2013.

Then recently the Frozen Factory Expansion came out and took another look at the game (and apparently all the updates to the game over that time period added a ton to the game).  Amazing.  Like minecraft and factorio mashup but better looking, fast digging and building tools, lots of machines to research, every block type has to be scanned, super fast travel with the grapple, using lasers to send energy to remote excavators.  Been playing and watching ""flexible games"" play this on youtube.  I'm hooked just like when Minecraft and Space Engineers first came out.

With the current sale I bought another copy of the game and the DLC for a family member to play with.  Edit - And because I have fallen in love with this game, just bought a copy full price for another family member, but they are going to have to earn the expansion by playing the game.

Es ist zwar auch ein Voxel-Game, aber es ist nicht nur besser programmiert, hat von haus aus eine bessere Grafik und hat in jede Richtung eine Mapausnehnung von 500 Lichtjahren.

zum vergleich: Minecraft gehen auf der x/y-achse nach ca 60.000.000 Blocks die Berechungen flöten, was zu den Berüchtigten ""far lands"" geführt hat. Darüber kann FortressCraft nur müde lächeln. bei 9.460.730.472.580.800.000 Blocks Ausdehnung auf [b]jeder[/b] Achse macht eine Spielwelt nicht so groß wie ungefähr ein zwei Wöchiger trip mit einem minecrad, nein, ihr würdet 1000 jahre mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit unterwegs sein um von einem ende zum anderen zu kommen. Da wir alles wissen das wir nicht so schnell sind wie das Licht, müssen wir uns damit zufrieden geben das der Developer hier eine Welt geschaffen hat, die nicht nur Tödlich ist, sondern auch schier unendlich.

Die lernkurve für was man tun sollte oder nicht, ist eindeutig steiler als die von anderen Voxel-games. Weil man nicht einfach friedlich vor sich hin bauen kann, sondern der planet auf dem man Bruch gelandet ist einen gar nicht da haben will. Das fängt an bei kleinen, aber leicht besigbaren Mynocks, zu einer ganzen invasions-Armee an gigantischen Insectioiden, die sich nichts sehnlicher wünschen, als das man den planeten als eiszapfen erhalten bleibt - aber nicht lebendig.

Durch das neue DLC #Frozen Factory' wird auch eine ganz andere Gegner Art eingeführt - anders wie das gehärtete Harz, welches die Hive-Minds hinterlassen, ist die Cyro-Masse, die jetzt auf die neuen Maschienen in der Cold Cavern reagiert um einiges Gefährlicher. Ein zerstörerisches Plasma, das Hitze sucht um sie zu eleminieren - und genau das ist man mit dem neuen DLC am versuchen, die eisigen Temperaturen (weit unter -100 °C) etwas zu erwärmen. Das zerrt nicht nur am Powergrid, das man sich vorher mühsam aufgebaut hat, sondern auch an den Nerven, wenn der neue gegener sich wie eine Welle nicht entfernbarer Blocks auf einen Stürzt.

FCE ist ein gutes Game, für das ich gerne mehr als 14€ auf den Tisch lege und ich bekomme für das geld ein Voxel-game, das eine Strategie erfordert und neben bei immer noch ausschauen kann, wie ein Voxelgame eben ausschaut.

Allem in allem ein grundsolides Games, das einem auch einen Crash ohne Murren verzeiht, dabei aber nichts am Schwierigkeitsgrad einbüßt.

Ich denke, ich werde hier noch einige hundert Spielstunden drin verbringen können, ohne das mir langweilig wird, weil irgendwo gibt es immer was zu fixen.

- Find precious minerals and extract them from the earth.
- Now use those minerals to do research.
- Apply that research! Its base building time.
- Now defend that base.
- Now automate that base.
- Now use that automated, well defended base to find even more precious minerals!
- Now use THOSE minerals to build more. More what? More turrets. More Robots. More Power. MORE.
- 1000 Hours in take a step back and reevaluate your base. ITS ALL WRONG. Revision 2.

4. Нужно больше ресурсов? Строим много шахт.

[h1]Как добывать ресурсы в FortressCraft[/h1]
1. Строим экстрактор.
2. Надоело вручную заряжать экстрактор от энергокостюма? Строим на базе генераторы и подводим энергию.
3. Надоело бегать за добытой рудой? Строим базовый конвейер.
4. Все работает. Но медленно. Исследуем технологии, ставим в экстрактор улучшенный двигатель.
5. Все равно медленно. Процесс тормозит Logistic Hopper, выгружающий руду из экстрактора на конвейер. Меняем Logistic Hopper на Storage Hopper.
6. Вот теперь улучшенный двигатель сможет показать себя во всей красе! Если хватит энергии. А ее не хватает. Меняем передатчики энергии на более совершенные.
7. Технологии не стоят на месте, и появилась новая модель двигателя! Но теперь с нагрузкой не справляется конвейер. Заменяем его на улучшенный.
8. Повторяем пункты 4-7, пока объемы добычи не перекроют потребностей.
9. Теперь у нас есть много олова, меди, железа. Что еще нужно для счастья? Правильно, литий. Копаем, выполняем пункты 1-8, это мы проходили. Стоп! Почему ресурсов идет все меньше и меньше? И что это за растения на конвейере? И почему руда исчезает, когда доходит до них? ... Строим цепочку турелей для защиты непосильным трудом нажитого добра.
10. Что-то рудные жилы начали быстро истощаться. Да и встретились залежи кристаллов, которые не берет экстрактор. Две проблемы  - одно решение: новые режущие головки для экстрактора.
11. Пришло время добывать продвинутые ресурсы: золото, никель, титан. Разве с нашим опытом это проблема, пусть по дороге к ним и лежит слой вечной мерзлоты? Строим энергосеть, линию турелей, конвейер. ... Вот с конвейером и возникают проблемы: на морозе он работает оооооочень меееееедленно. Строим грузовой лифт.
12. Оказывается, украсть могут не только ресурсы, но и энергию. Разбираемся с камо-ботами.
13. Так как грузовой лифт работает медленно, копим ресурсы, и со временем переводим инфраструктуру на транспортные трубы.
14. Транспортные трубы не справляются с нагрузкой? Строим железную дорогу и вагонетки.
15. ОЧЕНЬ много лишней энергии? Строим телепортаторы материи для мгновенной транспортировки.
16. Хочется чего-то более масштабного, чем экстракторы? Строим карьерный экскаватор.

А еще в игре есть производство, защита базы от летающих насекомых, исследование карты вглубь и больше сотни машин разного назначения. И это без учета дополнения, в котором обещают добавить новый режим игры и кучу усовершенствованных машин (да-да, в том числе и для добычи ресурсов:).

Pros:
+ Great game concept. 

Cons:
- Progression is broken. This game is about automation, but buildings' prerequisites and research requirements are set up so that you WILL spend hours grinding through things manually, and you WILL spend hours waiting on unavoidable bottlenecks. The game fights you every step of the way
- UI is broken. There's so much information that's not presented to the player (eg what research does), or presented in one of multiple places. There is a contextual help, but it really needs to be fleshed out to fill in huge gaps.
- Mobs are completely uninspired. Wasps will fly without stopping directly to the heart of your base, only attacking a single structure (the one that gets less and less important as the game progresses). There's no strategy to defense aside from supplying power to however many turrets it takes to kill the enemy.
- Low quality models and animations. Not super important considering the above points, but jerky conveyor belts sending items through each other, guns and enemies shooting globs of goo through walls, and everything else is just kind of distracting.

Those are some pretty massive cons for a game with only one pro, but I've got 38 hours in this game and only spent $8. Buy it and play it while watching TV or something. Or don't buy it and just play Factorio.",1468199255,1468199255,True,5,0,0.544976174831390381,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Без знаний языка можно долго копаться в вики и в итоге нифига не понять. Без желания конструировать вы уйдете из этой игры через часов 5 - 10. Без этого тут никак.
Хочется отметить продуманность линий производства. Огромнейший выбор вариантов развития вашей базы и конечно особенно радует отсутствие лагов. 
Количество врагов растущее по экспоненте, а соответственно и необходимость постоянной модернизации обороны.
Графика? Как-то за 260 часов об этом не задумывался... В смысле вообще. 
Однозначно рекомендую, но увы только любителям крафта и проектирования ))) 
И конечно минус, точнее два:

Разработчику отдельный поклон за:
- графику - кубизм (да, опять кубизм) но он тут смотрится отлично;
- проработка цепочек производства - супер, далеко не все становится понятно сразу;
- огромные территории для исследования - не надоедает, что приятно;
- много биомов - сразу проскочить все не получится при всем желании;
- мультиплеер - он работает, причем вполне прилично!!!!

А теперь как и положено ложка дегтя:
- все еще греет видеокарту - так как даже если вы уходите за горизон или в глубину Ваше производство продолжает работать и соответственно общитываться аппаратно.
-отсутствие русской локализации. Даже Великий Гугл переводчик не всегда справляется с глубиной мысли разработчиков)
- ну и конечно системные требования. Далеко не для всех машин.

The game is early release so understand that it is not completly finished and evolves. Sometimes things get nerfed to ensure balanced play, reduction of exploits that deminish the fun quality. But also things are constantly added, and new features arrive on an almost daily basis (when using bleeding edge version). Additionally a fair number of mods have been created, with more on the way that make your life even easier. 

Think of factorio and minecraft put together, but in a super cool symbiotic way. 

Follow the tutorial. Sometimes things are spelled out to you but you just have to look (example blue text hints that flash occasionally), or the mission system that shows outstanding items. Do them in order and make your life easier. the key to everything is automation, but it can take a little bit of time to undersand that and get setup. There are also modes for those who need an abundance of resources to blast through the game as quickly as possible. 

Think real mines in the real world...ore comes out of the ground, transported to crushers, and smelters and then transported further. The game thrives on being very spread out, and you have a huge world to do this in, so spread out! Think giant fortresses built that consume your resources.

""А какой в этом смысл?"" - спросите вы. Смысл - исследование мира. Эта игра скорее не про решение логических задач, интерес игры больше в познании неизведанного, спрятанного под тысячами метров глубины.

По ходу продвижения вниз у вас будут возникать проблемы и сложности в виде неблагоприятных условий среды, каких-нибудь монстров и постоянных атак на базу.

I think the research in Factoria can be a lot faster, but then I haven't really automated enough in FCE yet to know if that is true. 

The 3D aspect is a lot of fun, and the world shaping and stuff just eats up my time. I level hills, fill in valleys, build walls, make neat tunnels, etc. I have never played Minecraft, but my understanding is that the movement and shaping in FCE is much faster and easier. I guess it looks similar but does play very different from my understanding.

All in all I have really been enjoying the challenge of finding the ore, building up enough to work to automating getting it to the surface so I can smelt it and then use it for research and more building stuff.

I would recommend watching a play through or two on youtube, there are some great folks there. Even though the game has changed over time the mechanics are mainly unchanged so you get a good feel for how much there is to do and to play with!

The game is good, no arguement there or it was good. Now the developer continues to push his agenda of forcing people to play the game the way it was ""designed"". The 150 ore limit is my breaking point. Sometimes I like to wait to do the automation because I'm working on another project that required that I use x material that I just found. I am much more interested in getting that project working. That is wrong. I should be automating extraction first according to the dev. 

Bad news man Creative Intent ends as soon as you let someone else touch the thing. Let me know where the inventory controls are in the source files and I will be happy to change my mind but I dont like being told how to play. I will get around to automating but on my schedule not on the size of my inventory. It is a dumb change to make this long after the game has been release. This is only the change that set me off. There have been uncountable numbers of changes that accomplish exactly the same goal.

Not only is the developer quite entitled about how good the game is with his evangelical followers that, too, are entitled, but they are defensive in such a way that they are very rude when someone may be giving a civil criticism on the game.

The tutorial only teaches you so much... and by so much, I mean it only teaches you how to set up an automatic mining drill, how to power the base, how to transport items (on a very simple scale), and how to research blueprints (which requires you to go out and search for random stuff to scan with a very high chance of what you're scanning to be something you've already scanned. There's no way to gradually funnel in research points periodically with random materials (or even the minerals we so desperately need with how sparsely scattered they are), which is a pain in the you-know-what and leaves you to get lost in the world that was more than likely pre-generated.

Depending on which world setting you go with (Though I only know of the frozen world one), you're bound to either be too hot, too cold, and ALWAYS stuck with hardly any useful materials. There is no guide we can look at when we first open the game, or even when we are in a level.

The tutorial is, as one could imagine from my previous explanation and comparison, short and bittersweet. Those pictures and videos of gameplay may look fun and entertaining, but they're just to reel you in for the developer to take your money and give you an experience that is nearly as hard as Darksouls even though you're not really likely to die every few minutes of gameplay. In my honest opinion, even Darksouls NG+++ is more fun than any mode of this game.

The creative mode is borked in the bad way, so don't even bother playing in creative mode. How is it messed up? Well, THE GOD FORSAKEN ITEM IMAGES ARE ALL SQUARE TEXTURES THAT COMMONLY DO NOT CORRELATE WITH THE ITEM YOU WANT, AND THE NAMES ARE ALL OVERLY COMPLEX TO THEIR SURVIVAL MODE COUNTERPARTS.

-Another thing I would like to see is more enemies like camo bots, so when exploring you come across different types of aliens, some hostile, some not, or at night something happens. That would make exploring more fun and challenging.

This game used to be fun.  Key is USED TO.  If you played in earlier versions you will understand.  Every new patch he changes things to force players to do things his way.  Things that are(were) fun are being nerfed all in the name of because you are not playing the game in his vision.

He has removed the ability to craft things manually and now force you to make these one-off machines because these are 'new machines'.  So now players need to make a production chain just to make some of these infrequently used intermediate items instead of allow players to craft by hand which many of has only a single purpose.

Not even considering previous nerfs, the current nerfs already announced include the inability(or limited) use of the grapple so they will not work in certain areas as well as the inability to smelt anywhere but on the surface.  AND NO... CC Furnaces does not count as that requires a separate PAID subscription to patreon to access currently.  And the newest nerf announcement of limiting the amount of ores you're allowed to carry so you have to play the game as he sees fit.

The nerfs aren't even the largest issue.  The attitude of the developer is just bad.  Many of his replies on this very forum are just condescending replies.  So instead of discussion he would routinely just reply ""You do know there's a machine for that, right?"" or the ever helpful ""You have read the help files, right?""

Fundamental changes should have been done from the beginning.  The game has been in Steam's Early Access since 2013, but waits til NOW to make some of these changes.  Which brings up the final point.  All these changes are always justified because of 'serious discussions with other players and we feel it's for the better...' type posts.  These are usually the hardcore players who sit on his daily stream and chats.  These evangelical players are not always the best gauge for tuning and balancing and you will see them defending the developer tooth and nail for these changes on these same forums.  

I fully expect many of them to vote down once he tells his stream viewers but many things needed to be said.  IMO if you are interested in logistics and think this is factorio in 3D, you would be sad.  If you wanted a sandbox game, this is not it.  If you enjoy survival, there is only one single aggressive mob in the entire game.  And he's stationary.  99% of your deaths will be because you fell or you stood in fire too long.... or you stood in cold too long.  

So if you're wondering about the great number of hours put in, I've played this since v1.  And reading this last round of nerf announcements has finally made me take a step back and reevaluate the game as a whole.  It is no longer fun and for the past several patches this is the direction it's headed with no signs of changing.  And so unfortunately I can no longer recommend the game anymore.

I'll re-evaluate the game in some more patches down the line and see if it feels like it's getting better or worse.",1466705707,1466705707,False,764,20,0.833741128444671631,54,True,False,False,False,,,

Objective is to mine ore to be able to build faster more powerful equipment to power and mine deeper. Eventaully the game becomes a defend your base type game with waves of flying insects. The bigger your base becomes the harder the waves get. A lot of the fun is figuring out how to make your base more efficent by building more ore transports and researching new tech and then upgrading your base.

Game is updated almost every 4-6 weeks for release buids of game but there are also bleedign edge builds that are updated multiple times a week.

This is a great casual game. Great for kids. 

If you are still on the fence, watch some videos on youtube. Thye may look very complex but it really isn't too bad and the game spoon feeds you new blocks so you don't get too overwhelmed too quickly.

Some of the negatives of the game is sometimes it seems you are waiting around for ore instead of doing something fun. You could always be making your mine shaft bigger but in the begining you don't know how much space you will need. There really isn't much guidance after a very short tutorial. Also, if your base gets killed, it is no big deal. It repairs itself, So there isn't a real reason to defend it. Of course that might not always be the case since the game does get updated often and there is a large DLC being created that should be out this year.

For what looked like well over a dozen patches...

But as I went to get this information to back up my review, for your 'Are you joking?' question, I noticed you've posted about 'defecting from Twitch'. I'm glad you have. However, you were in the habit of simply posting a single paragraph followed by a link. If I (We) wanted to know more we had to follow the link and/or search for the patch info on our own. Yes, I know. It's not very difficult to do so. Especially if your game is the only one I care about. It'd likely take me 2-5 minutes to locate a change log. It gets rather annoying when you have a dozen, or even hundreds of titles in your library. And frankly, I'm getting more and more tired of hunting such info down. I've uninstalled many that either do not patch very often, or patch but don't inform their fans what they're installing on their systems.

Maybe some things have changed. Or rather, obviously some things have changed. Or one thing? Never mind, I'll change my review. The reason for the review was because i was uninstalling several games.

Framerate glitches and stutters consistently, on a 4790k @4.7k.

This is a great example of a very poorly optimized game from a struggling developer trying to pay his bills. He is baiting you in with ridiculous grind time for minimal content. He hides additional content behind Patreon support. It's cute that he has gathered a small, mediocre following to manipulate into paying his bills.

He is also Steam's most condescending, arrogant and patronizing developer. Which is remarkably self-defeating due to his narrow skillset.

This is not an easy game to review.  And I am not a reviewer.


Played a full game on Rapid/Plentifull settings.  Took about 350 hours.  Was awesome.  I'm mid-way in a coop game with a friend and I just started a new world, solo, with slightly less beginner-friendly settings.  Still love it.  Still discovering new strategy.


This is the most addictive+long lasting NON-MMORPG game I've played.   Ever.   Over the course of the last 30 years... !



First, I want to give my 2 cents about the comments from some reviews about ""the developper"".  It seems that some people have some problems with some aspect of the game, report it to the developper, who refuse to fix it... and then down-vote the game.

4 things about this : 

1- This game is pretty ""elitist"".  It's slow paced, strategic, atmospheric... not easy and not for everyone.  It can be quite punishing at times, but also very rewarding.  Some aspect that do not suit some players are there on purpose because the developper (and the targeted players) love it this way.  It's not lazyness.  (Not the way I see it)  Exemple : there is no ladder to ease vertical movement.   You have to deal with failing hookshot.... or build/manage elevators... or, later on, teleporters are jetpacks.  A ladder would just make it all too easy !

2- The developper (a single guy) actually reaches a new level of customer support/interraction, the way I see it.  Not only does he spends time on Steam forums and comment/answers on many posts, but he develops the game while streaming near-100% of it, while interacting LIVE with the payers.  
I actually posted some questions in the forums (for the general public ! I was not targeting the developper at all !) the DJ (the dev) actually answered 3 out of 4 of my questions himself ! Kinda awesome.

3- Some people complain about ""core parts of the game are locked to supporters"".  That is not true.  Developper gives early access to the patches he is working on to the early supporters so they can TRY (and help debug) the UN-COMPLETE, ""IN PROGRESS"" patches.  But they get no bonus materials ""in game"". Except maybe a few more ""skins"".  Nothing ""un-fair"".  

So yeah, he may take decisions that you do not like.  But..... that's too bad !

4- EXPENSION PACK (FROZEN FACTORY) : Some people complain about ""DLC"" and its price.  This is not a ""DLC"" as per now-days definition.  This is an EXPENSION PACK, like in old times.  The game alone will give you 100++++++ hours of game play.  When you're DONE with the base, you can optionally buy the expension pack to reach deeper layers of the game.  It's a full fledged expension pack bringing an additionnal 50+++ hours of gameplay !  And the expension pack content ""begins"" after the base game ""end-game""...  (and obviously it's not ""free"" since the developper needs to... you know... eat !)



Now, the game.

A cross-over between Minecraft and Factorio.  That's what it triies to be, and that's what itis.  With some features that differ from both games.  It has its own identity.

Part 1 - Compared to Minecraft :
The ""surface"" of the world is no fun to explore.  You space-ship-crashed on a desolated, icy planet.  The surface is very rough, with huge mountains and huge holes and caves.  But it's a single biome.
The exploration is more vertical.
3rd ore begins to spawn under -180-ish.
4th around -300-ish.
6th around -400-ish.... !  
(the max depth is like, -2^64 (or -10 quintillions.... or infinite, basically), but for now I think there's nothing new under -2000)
And you will find HUUUUUUGGE caves to explore.
The games allows some nice little twist to instantly build whole lines of block and such, which can allow you to build a 50x10 plateform in about 15 seconds.  This is nice.
This game is NOT centered on building random, useless strucutres for no reasons.  Materials are ugly and the planet is somewhat dark.  Even during the day, you never get a beautifull sun that will make your structure shine.
It's all about being functionnal and automated.  GEtting your ressources manually won't work.  You need to build machines to automate the ressource gathering and transformation.

Which  brings us to :

Part 2 - Compared to Factorio
Similar yet different.
I LOVE Facotrio.  
Factorio is ""all about building your base"".  No exploration.  No digging.  Just gather ressources, and build. 
In 15 hours, in Factorio, you'll have a huge, top-tier base.
Since Fortresscraft has a whole ""digging"" and ""exploroing"" part and you have to deal with the 3rd dimension, it'll be much slower.
In 15 hours if played on ""casual"" settings(default), you'll barelly have time to automate the extraction and transformation of the 1st tier of materials... !
Factorio is somewhat linear and never felt overwhelming (to me).  What you first build will be used to build the next tier, which will be used for the next, and so on.  Your first building are never rendered useless and you always grow from what has already been done.
Fortresscraft allows more freedom on those aspect and can sometime feel overwhelming !  So many possibilities !  And news building CAN make older ones useles.  So spending a lot of ressources on early stuff CAN eventually feel useless...
A bit more hardcore.... not a bad thing : I'm just saying.


Edit - I triied the ""faster"" mode.  Extractors can hold more ores, power is abundant, receipies requirement are divided by 4... I did in 2 hours what took 20 hours in my other game.  This is good news for people who are in a rush.  The difference in pacing between the various game settings are huge.



So yeah, I give it a huge thumb up.

Progress has a much more rewarding feeling to it, setting up automation and watching something automatically complete itself (Which before needed you to move seperate parts all over) it the best. Exploring this game on my own, with little to no help from outside (other than asking wikipedia how much power a solar generator makes) is one of the most fun things I have done in quite a while. When I found out there was actually some degree of threat found in the wasps, I was amazed. My first playthrough had these little robots floating around occasionally, but nothing like the threats I have seen here. I'm not even mid-game and I still enjoy the slow process of manually carrying ores to the surface, because I know that these ores are going to be turned into bars, which will be turned into circuits and plates, which will be turned into research pods, which will be used to research automatic transportation methods for those ores I have been bringing up manually. When something comes full circle in this game, it is probably one of the most satisfying feelings.

It has a steep learning curve.
It is a challenge.
It is a factory game.
You get attacked.
You try to endgame.
You try to endgame again.

If you love slow paced 'crafting/automation' games (like Factorio, but not 1 hour and you're done), with a sense of acheivement when you build that massive (3 dimensional) factory that does exactly what you ask, while you are being attacked, and trying to grow your factory, so you can be attacked more while you try to endgame, then you will very much love this game.
It starts slow, and has a steep learning curve, but players who can bear to not have their hands held, will love it.

NTL;WTR:

I love the Battlefield series of games.
I love getting into a fresh round of fast paced action.
I love killing those 4 blokes who all came up the elevator at Siege of Shanghai C.
And most of all, I hate the fact that players who have all played the game a long time and acquired knowledge and experience in the game think it is their right to ""Always be on the winning team"". Where is the challenge in fighting a bunch of noobies that don't know what they are doing? Where is the fun without a challenge?

FortressCraft Evolved is nothing like Battlefield, thank goodness.
There is no teamstacking. There is no ""How the f did he get me"". But it is a challenge. And it is fun.

I've only owned it for a little bit. And when I first started playing it, I wasn't sure what I was doing, and not much has changed for newbies. Spend a week on making a proper tutorial for new players, and the player base may just grow.

The primary developer does listen to community feedback. Heck, he even ASKS for it. Sometimes he downright ignores it. But few times has the primary developer's actions been detrimental to the enjoyment of the game.

Edit: Some people are commenting about a virus link within the help pages via. a mislink to a youtube video.

The reason he can't release a hotfix is he simply doesn't have enough manpower to update four  platforms running different versions easily and release the new patch on time. The developer also adressed this issue and replied to the thread talking about what he's doing.

There were probably three or four minutes in the entire day of total playtime that I actually enjoyed myself. But the more I invested myself in the game, the more I felt determined to get something out of it, and the more time I shoved into it. I spent almost all of yesterday (5/16/2016) playing, desperately trying to make progress.
There are several problems with making progress.
First off, this is not a single player game. It may have the ability to be played single player, but it's not single player. There just isn't enough progress for it to be single player. In order to make a reasonable amount of progress on my own, I edited files in order to vastly speed up my gameplay. Somehow, that made it go from very boring to incredibly boring.
Nothing happens quickly on your own. Even with the game settings set all the way to the quickest, easiest, fastest settings. You need 32 bars of something to build x. Well, settle in, that'll take a while unless you've already got five or six systems running. And it's not like setting those up is quick. Or cheap.
And don't get me started on how long it takes to research pretty much anything once you've got the laboratory. The projects take ages to complete, and enough resources that after a day of highly sped-up gameplay, I was barely able to make some of it.
But that's not the worst part about this game.
This game is NOT finished. This game was early-access, and still should be! It's nowhere near complete. I find bugs everywhere I go. I come back to my base and all my turrets are facing firmly in one direction, a giant laser firing out. The ship I crashed in is on fire (it's only been two months in-game since I landed, I'm sure that's normal). The CPH is projecting some kind of field that is making it awfully hard to see. Various other things are making all sorts of very bright frames of animation that make it practically impossible for me to see what the hell is happening in my base.
My laser turrets are still working fine. It's just impossible to tell that.
I place another laser turret on top of another block I've placed, and all the bugs disappear in an instant.
Before I do that, the ship hurts me if I get too close.
Now? No worries, I can walk straight through it.
I assure you, this is one of many, many bugs that I've encountered. The list got so long I didn't bother remembering them.
Then, there's the simple fact that some things are either badly implemented, have missing icons, mismatched icons, or maybe their help file doesn't exist.
Make some iron pipe if you can. Or find something that requires iron pipe and look at the picture. As of this moment, the picture is a big red x and the words ""NO ICON"". Go grab some cave flora from the cold or toxic caverns. One of each. Then, place them. Place them against a wall, and turn them twice, so they're actually right-side-up. Don't ask why. Now, compare the flora you just placed to the icon. They're mismatched. A is B, B is A, C is D, etc.
How about auto-excavators? Place one on a wall, and you'll probably think it can dig a 3x3 hole horizontally. Maybe if you place it on the ceiling, it can dig down, instead of up! Why would you think that? Because the column of light indicating where it can dig shows that!
You'd be wrong. Once you power it up, no matter where you're trying to 'aim' it, it shoots up.
The list goes on. There are things that are just plain problematic. Things that are useless. Things that make no sense. Things that are poorly implemented, buggy, unfinished, and more. It is, quite frankly, awful, and if you look at the pictures saying ""Oh, I want that!"", then either join a server with a dozen other players or be prepared to keep playing for WEEKS (Actual time played, not number of days you played for a little while) in order to get there.",1463489026,1463489026,False,65,3,0.669271945953369141,8,False,False,False,False,,,

Ohne zu untertreiben kann ich sagen, dass mich in den letzten Jahren selten ein Spiel so in Besitz genommen hat wie dieses. 

Aber langsam. Erst einmal eine grobe Beschreibung. 
Wir haben hier eine sehr geglückte Mischung aus einem Aufbaustrategiespiel im Stile von Minecraft. Um die Wahrheit zu sagen, wer Minecraft kennt, kann sofort loslegen. Es gibt hier keine Reibungsverluste (zumindest am Anfang). Wie auch im genannten Konkurenzprodukt gilt es auch hier zu Überleben. Kernresource ist hierbei schlicht „Energie“ und natürlich „Lebenskraft“. Dabei wurde Fortresscraft Evolved aber sehr intelligent weiter entwickelt und nach und nach schleicht sich immer komplexer werdende Technik mit ins Spiel, die es dem Spieler erlaubt immer weiter fortschreitende Automatisierung einzubauen. Wo man zunächst alles mühsam von Hand abbauen muss, bilden sich später, sozusagen von alleine, mächtige Industriekomplexe unter der Erde die dem Spieler alles praktisch abnehmen (sofern man das möchte). Was bleibt ist der Spass sich die Technologie zu erarbeiten, zu knobeln, zu verzweifeln, zu lösen und zu jubeln. Es ist immer irgendetwas knapp, wird gerade angegriffen, will überwacht werden oder ist einfach nur zu „Verhübschen“. Es gibt immer zu tun, ohne dass man sich gehetzt fühlt. Ohne Übertreibung, dass ist Brillant gemacht. 
Das Spiel spricht aber auch Entdecker an. mächtige Höhlen warten darauf erforscht zu werden. Und mit mächtig ist auch mächtig gemeint. Teilweise erstrecken sich diese Höhlensysteme über hunderte von Metern in alle Richtungen und ein Fehltritt genügt und man landet in einer unbekannten Tiefe. Mancher Abstieg ins Ungewisse und zu den Schätzen die unten auf einen warten, ist nur mit einer guten strategischen Planung möglich. Habe ich genug Fackeln dabei? Reicht meine Energie noch? Was tue ich gegen die dort unten herrschende Kälte, Giftgase, Magma etc. 

Gleichzeitig kommt hier noch ein 3-D Tower Defence Spiel hinzu. Mächtige Hiveminds wehren sich sozusagen gegen den spieltechnischen Eingriff in die Natur. Eine auf begehrende KI die mit dem „Frevel“ des Spielers am Planeten sozusagen immer mächtiger wird. Auch hier gibt es Möglichkeiten den Gegner etwas zu besänftigen oder sogar noch aggressiver zu machen. So schickt der Gegner diverse Viecher gegen die Basis. Auch hier kommt das Strategische nicht zu kurz. Wo stehen meine Verteidigungsanlagen? Wieviele Verteidigungs Linien muss ich aufbauen, wo sind diese zu platzieren und haben alle genug Energie? Kann ich schon Raketen bauen etc. Neuerdings hinzugekommen gilt es auch Versorgungsgüter zu bergen. 

Auch unterirdisch hat man keine Ruhe vor den Störenfrieden. Laufende Steine die Energieleitungen anzapfen möchten. Erzfresser, die nur darauf warten dass eine Versorgungsleitung unbewacht bleibt. 
Die Lernkurve ist steil aber alles in sich schlüssig und fast schon selbst erklärend. Manches könnte noch besser dokumentiert sein. Z.B. muss man erst ein bestimmtes Mineral finden um in seinem teschnischen Fortschritt weiter zu kommen? Wenn ja, welches?  

Man möchte auf keinen Fall meinen, das Spiel wäre noch in Entwicklung. Nicht falsch verstehen. Ich lieeeeebe die üppigen überbordenden Ideen und die Fantasie der Entwickler. Jeder Patch ist geradezu eine Offenbarung und verlockt einen sofort alles Neue aus zu probieren. MACHT AUF JEDEN FALL WEITER SO! Aber vom rein technischen läuft Fortress Craft Evolved bereits jetzt schon vielen „fertigen“ Spielen komplett den Rang ab. Es gibt noch einige kleinere Bugs, die keinesfalls den Spielspass eintrüben oder gar entscheidend wären. 

Preis Leistung: Gäbe es mehr als 100% ich würde jedes Mal das Maximum geben. Hunderte Stunden Spielspass für das bisschen Geld? Bitte unterstützt die Entwickler Leute. Kauft das Spiel! 
Familienväter und sog. „Casual Gamer“ kommen auf Ihre Kosten. Es ist kein Problem mal kur 15 Minuten zu zocken und dann wieder die Kinder zu hüten oder Windeln zu wechseln (100% bestätigt). Natürlich kann man auch Ewig darin versinken ohne das es Langweilig werden würde. 

Wünsche: 
Nahrung. Irgendetwas anbauen, jagen, essen zu können wäre grossartig. 
Eine Karte mit Kompass. Bitte gebt uns eine Karte! :-D Gerade an der Oberfläche ist die Orientierung besonders heftig. Sich im Dauerschneesturm zu verlaufen ist geradezu ein Todesurteil. 

Fazit: Verdammt wieso schreibe ich so viel… meine Titaniumleitung muss noch ausgebaut werden und ich muss noch die Geschütze auf der Südflanke verstärken und überhaupt müssen die Bohrköpfe 500 Meter unter Tage langsam durch sein…. Verdammt :-D !!

I have put a lot of time in the last few months into this game and keep coming back to it almost daily to try new strategies and to see what dev has added to the game (which is done almost daily).   I have never personally experienced a game that had such an open forum for the development of a game.  As a long time game player from games back to Everquest, WoW, Minecraft, etc (and even back to the days of Zork and before) I can't remember ever having the opportunity to give feedback on something and have it actually become a part of the game.   (Don't expect every idea you come up with to be implemented, but if you have a well reasoned and thought out idea you stand a shot).

Fortresscraft takes some work.  If you are looking for a game you just start up and have it hold your hand all day while you mindlessly hit a few keys, then this might not be the game for you.   But if you like a challenge and are looking for a game that is constantly evolving and growing, a communitity of players who will help you if you have questions, and a game where you can go online and watch the developer streaming as he builds new game content then you may want to consider this.

I am addicted to the game and although I have a lot of hours of play time I am nowhere near completing it.   Like the old saying goes, ""it isn't about the destination, it is about the journey"".   The journey of playing Fortresscraft Evolved for me has been a blast.

I tried a couple before I found one I was happy with.

At first, you will have to babysit things. You simply don't have the resources to get things rolling on their own for the first hour, maybe two. Watch a couple of videos on it. You'll see how others do things, you'll get a good understanding of the basics, and you'll have some ideas as to how to set your own system up. It takes a lot of time to really get a lot going on, but if building up to that isn't your cup of tea, then I might advise a different game type.

Since then it has degenerated into the mess that it has become today, an unfinished hodgepodge of ideas found in other games with no clear direction, no character and no fun. The mob graphics are shoddy and the loot system is incredibly weak. Players consistantly complain that they find progression to be awkward and the game has no real aim or endgame amongst other flaws in basic game design which prevent them from working through the messy research system but the one-man-band developer refuses to accept their concerns, maintaining that his design is flawless, and original of course, so they walk away having wasted their hard earned cash on a bad clone. This game should never have left early access at it stands and shouldn't really even be on Steam.

I asked one of the devs why there were no building blocks available in the survival part of the game and they told me... and I quote from Skype...  ""I can't be bothered to write the recipes""  I later find that they're selling the survival game blocks into the game one by one to Patreon supporters as though they're a commodity.  I've never heard of anything so stupid.  A voxel block game with no voxel blocks until Patreons 'buy' them for the playerbase?  What a joke.

If you're considering purchasing this game you should know that even though the base game is unfinished, the developer is now concentrating on a paid expansion pack which he intends to sell for $8 (subject to Valve approval). If you buy this game now you will not be able to use the resources you see ingame unless you pay an extra 8 bucks for the expansion. No, he didn't tell the rest of us that either and while comparable indie games like Space Engineers and Factorio are a huge success with 1,700 players ingame consistantly without this kind of failed-game pay-to-play mentality, these guys are either too lazy, inept or don't have the brains to see past their own short-term pockets and even though this game has been on Steam for years, are attracting less than 500 concurrent players ingame and trying to make up for the shortfall in popularity/profit with useless paid DLC. I'm all for buying good DLC for a good game but the game has to be finished and popular first.  God knows how much I've paid for Payday DLC but those guys deliver content.

I'll move on to content after the next round of developer downvotes.

The biggest problem with this game is it's developer's attitude. A very rude guy who doesn't listen to players, is struggling to earn a living from the game because of that and is now begging for money in his stickies on the forum with threats that he will stop development and go & find a job if the game continues to fail.

The developers were also begging players for positive reviews a few months ago because the game had a red 'mixed' review tag, now each time a negative review is made he sends over his 50 cent army to falsely manipulate the Steam rating system and argue with the reviewer, incredibly obvious because the same names appear in the comments section of each negative review and they are mostly using fake, private profile, Steam level zero accounts. The same fake steam accounts are also being used to pump up the positive reviews for the game. Steam really should do something about it because they are cheating customers. People from the publishing house with financial interests in the game no doubt and it certainly doesn't help that a steam moderator is involved with this game's development, also fairly despicable that the same Steam moderator is fully aware of and allows this kind of manipulation of the Steam review system, time for Steam to remove him I think.

Now for those who don't know, the developer's previous job was working in a limited role on Borderlands 2 which obviously didn't include game design. Most if not all of the 50 cent army downvoting this and and all other negative reviews for the game have only Fortresscraft, Borderlands 2 and a couple of other free games in their limited Steam level 0-5 game list. What conclusions can you draw from this? The developer's friends from his previous job who've been gifted copies of Fortresscraft are defending him? Or the developers friends have been gifted both Fortresscraft and Borderlands 2? Either way it sounds like they're cheating Steam and their customers to me.  2K Games employees too, that should be interesting.

While the game developers and other financially or emotionally interested parties keep sending the 50 cent army here to downvote my review, abusing the Steam rating system I'll remove their abusive remarks and downvotes by posting it again, they just keep reminding me of more flaws in the game to add to the review & that way it will stay on the recent review list forever until they learn to accept genuine reviews with genuine ratings from genuine customers and stop manipulating the Steam rating system and cheating Steam customers.",1463064633,1463072338,False,271,26,0.781682729721069336,16,True,False,False,False,,,

And that's a good thing!  I find myself constantly experimenting, changing, and iterating my systems to take advantage of new tech or just to maximize efficiency.  As of this writing, I have 200+ hours in game and I plan to at least tripple that.

At first glance, it might look like Minecraft or Factorio.  But this game is much more than that and really isn't comparable.  This game rewards efficient, scalable design, not one-off systems.  You can do many things by hand, but eventually, everything must become automated.  And that is a good way to understand the game.  You must automate everything.

For the price, this game is definitely worth it.  I've spent more on games that I've played less.  Additionally, the planned expansions sound exciting and definitely something I will want to play.

My recommendation: if you like designing or building systems, this game is a must-have.

Does the idea of taking 6+ hours to achive even basic automation which you could accomplish in Factorio or modded Minecraft in under 30 minutes appeal to you? How about 2 hours to be able to safely explore away from your base for more than 5 minutes at a time? And that's in what this game calls easy mode - ""Casual"" mode it literally say is for people with jobs and families. (Who is the target audience, then?)

Every upgrade and machine will cost more resources than it should, and perform below expectations. The game's basic generator can only function in the shallowest biomes (not enough oxygen deeper apparently), and even then it will decline to near 0% efficiency before you reach the next layer. Said layer will freeze you to death in under a minute until you build a suit upgrade... using ore from the layer below it. Everything about the gameplay feels like it's punishing the player.

Apart from the mindbogglingly slow gameplay: The graphics are generally unappealing - it tries 'realistic' textures which don't look good in voxel games in my opinion, but I will acknowledge that's subjective. The surface is ugly as sin - you will never go exploring looking for a pretty place to build an outpost, because none exist. The 3d models are passable for an indie game. Animation is barebones.

The sound design is decent, the effects get the job done, some of the (brief and intermittent) background music is nice.

I didn't notice any bugs whatsoever, so good job on that.

Much of the flavor text in item descriptions includes the author's attempts at forced humor, which I found grating.

I actively played this game for about 15 hours, with several more afk idling while waiting for automation to process materials. I did my best to give this game a chance, I kept waiting for it to become fun, and it just never did.

Dear lord, this game is fun. It has all of the creative potential of minecraft, but automation removes all the boring negatives like manually mining and smelting and even building block by block. Instead of wasting time on that boring nonsense, FortressCraft Evolved allows you to focus on advancing your tech, building your base, and defeating your enemies! 

There are tons of awesome aspects of the tech aspect of this game, with my favorite being the ability to build blocks from a specified block to your location using control-click. AFAIK, minecraft doesn't let you do this. At least, it didn't back in the day when I played it. Also, this game has a grappling hook. Let me repeat that for you. THIS GAME HAS A GRAPPLING HOOK. AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO UNLOCK IT. There are multiple power source types for your machine, and your enemies (bees native to the world you're stranded on) provide you with valuable building materials. There's a lot of variety in every aspect of the game: building, smelting, mining, etc. 

Also, this game is gorgeous for what it is. I'm running it on an intel g3258 that I haven't gotten around to overclocking yet and an AMD r9 270 and it still runs decently on high-ish settings. And it works on linux! :D

There are a lot of complaints from earlier in the game's development about the creator abandoning the project. He came back, and has been consistently releasing updates since the beginning of the year. He's a bit snarky, but he's really fun to interact with, and he actually listens to player feedback.

There are not any noticable bugs which I have noticed and I have personally seen how the developer has dedicated his time by watching his development stream where he is creating and growing the game.  That being said, I recommend you watch it to get a feel for his passion for improving this game continuously and takes direct customers input to add content and keep rebalancing the game.  He does this because he loves his game and it sounds like it will be around for a long long time and I am tempted to become a patreon as well because the game has so much already paid for itself in pure enjoyment.

You are stranded on a foreign planet, but somehow a small friend called Arthur and a giang spider-bot survived the impact (or you built them after the crash, I don't know). The world looks like Minecraft, but feels more realistic, and your task is to gather ressources and build up a working factory (not like a big plant, but several small pieces put together to smelt, craft, shape, improve, research many things you find on the planet) so that you can finally be rescued or something (don't know, I didn't came so far yet).

The more you proceed down the earth (or however this planet is called) the more you attract some kind of insectiods, which will visit your factory from time to time and check if you need anything (like terror and death). They seemed driven by a higher intelligence, and yes there is something like that. Either somewhere burried in earth are some huge globbing eyes hidden behind a undiggable wall of ... don't know what, looks like the stuff from the Alien-Movie. Those ""Eyes"" send small creatues to steal ressources from unprotected conveyors to reach with their ugly arms after your factory. The other ones are vastly huge, four-headed, brain-thingy, glowing ... things. Well, you will recognize once you see them. And, I don't know wether I was day-dreaming... but I think I saw something like that worm from Star Wars that was hidden inside that asteroid trying to eat the Falcon...

However as a full release, there are some glaring flaws I noticed in just the first hour. 

Foremost, the tutorial for a game this complicated should continue through the first five hours, lightly stepping in whenever the player encounters a new mechanic to explain it. I spent over an hour in this game trying to do one thing, and one thing only. I wanted to automate power transmission from the main generator to the coal mining drill, and subsequently automate coal transmission from the drill to the generator that burns it. In over an hour, I came no closer to figuring this out than I did watching the video at the top of the page.

Secondly, the crafting system interface needs to be scrapped and redone. Impossible to find crafting requirements without more than a minute of searching through menus and lists, meanwhile 60 percent of the screen is taken up by ridiculous ""sci-fi"" window borders that do LITERALLY NOTHING AT ALL. If you are going to copy minecraft, at least copy the parts that were user friendly.

Thirdly, do you know why blocks take a few seconds to break in minecraft, but appear instantaneously when building? ITS BECAUSE IT WARNS YOU WHEN YOU HAVE ACCIDENTALLY DONE THE WRONG ACTION. I spent more time than I can measure switching from the thing I actually WANTED to build back to BLOCKS OF DIRT just to fill in A HOLE I DIDNT MEAN TO DIG. This is utterly ridiculous.

HOWEVER

The concept has incredible potential. Adding automation and base defense to a minecraft style operation creates both drama and empowerment, and it would be something I REALLY want to enjoy, but these initial issues with the OBSCENE learning curve, clunky interface, and other oversights overshadow a very good idea. Fix these issues and the game will improve.

A lot of people have compared it to minecraft but main difference is that there is no weapon or armor upgrade for your character.  This is mainly because this is more of a tower defense type game, so if you are looking for a shooter this won't be it.

That said, the tutorial does give you the basics of how to figure everything else out for yourself with fairly extensive in-game help and tooltips, so with a bit of trial and error along the way, for which the game imposes no penalties on the easy difficulty settings (my personal recommendation until you know what you're doing), you soon get into the swing of it. 

Automation is a major part of the game, and your strategy of implementing this will heavily determine the pace of the game. Want it to go faster? Simply increase whatever factor is limiting your progress, be it power, materials, or machine throughput. 

Just as you're getting the hang of all this, you'll come across the Threat Analyser and probably end up building one out of curiosity. This will warn you of incoming attacks and keep you informed as to how much attention your base is drawing from the native life forms. Very useful in determining when you really need to change your focus to building defences against said life forms, but again on the easier settings the only penalty for failure is that it temporarily stops your source of comepletely free power.

I've restarted this game several times now, because after developing my base setup a certain way I get further then come up with a better way to do things, which would almost certainly be easier if I did it from the very beginning. The fact that this game can still cause such epiphanies is to me a mark of a very well thought out game indeed.  That said, I could just tear it all apart with no penalty, and rebuild, but I prefer a clean slate.

The game is undergoiong continual development on a daily basis. This does not mean that the game is unfinished, having watched the developer's daily live streams of the work being done I can say that it if the game had stayed in Early Access until he ran out of ideas and had implemented all the current thoughts he has for late-game content, it would still be Early Access ten years from now, and the game already far surpasses many titles that I've seen launched from EA.

It's true that the developer is planning explansion packs as a way to introduce large chunks of extra content to the game, and a lot of people have slammed this decision, despite the fact that he has clearly said that if he can afford to do so, these will be free expansion packs rather than paid.  Given how many games are released in an almost episodic fashion these days, this is by no means unreasonable, especially given the exceptional value for money the FCE represents. How many games can give hundreds of hours of enjoyment for £10? 

At this price give it a try, it's a steal and if you enjoy any kind of tower defence, voxel building, crafting, gathering or logistics/assembly line games you should have a blast.

But I've a simple rule: Games that are incomplete and not marked early access get the thumbs down. 

There are many resources with descriptions like ""not implemented yet"" or ""has no use yet, but will soon."" There are big mechanics of the game (losing a base assault for example) which don't do anything. The game is quite playable and enjoyable, but it's not even in beta yet.

Alot of people were complaining about this game, and honestly I think it was because they didn't understand the mechanics. I remember one guy complaining that generators don't work underground so you can't go very deep... i guess he didn't see all the power transmission devices? But then, blocky games with ""craft"" in the title are clearly targetting the minecraft audience, and I think this game requires a bit more maturity to understand.

The game really is pretty good, although a bit rough around the edges. I think the game could use a rebalance to make resource management less cumbersome. Specifically, late game components (mk III lasers for example) take quite a few resources to build. But hey, it's an automation game so that's perfectly reasonable, you just need to build more mines. The problem is that if you build enough mines to keep those your factory making those at a reasonable pace, the storage of resources becomes a nightmare.

In my situation, I've got two or three machines making late game components, and my storage facility (which is really big btw) is either completely empty, or overflowing to the point where my transit lines jam up. I'm constantly running up and down my mine to turning drills on and off so that my storage won't overflow, becase honestly (and here's the important part) it's easier to turn them on and off then to make a storage facility large enough to support the flow.

I often see the developer on the forums asking things like ""what would you like to see?"" I'd like to see cheaper storage and transport in the early game (so you can ramp up faster without all the waiting for tin bars), and higher tier transport and storage in the late game. Just something as simple as a ""super hopper"" that's expensive but holds 1000 resources would go a long way. A faster transport system then the tubes would be nice too (or maybe mk 4 lasers and more powerful matter-movers). Just something along those lines.

Anyway, that's my take on it. I love the factory games, and this is the best 3D one I've found, although it still has a long way to go. To those who like the automation aspects of this game, do make a point of looking at Factorio though, because it is the best IMHO.",1460570293,1460570293,False,49,1,0.660528063774108887,5,True,False,False,False,,,

I honestly didnt think i would like this game now im hooked i Dont notice what time it is till its waaaay past the time i need to get off. it is a lil slow in the beginning but once you start getting conveyer belts going you cant stop.

So I crash land first time nooo idea what I'm doing. scan some blocks research some stuff find some ore. make trips back and forth to charge power and get ores. thought this is tedious make some belts n laser power no more trips. look for more ores.... WTF im under attack by what ... ooooo i made the wasps mad. set up turrets go back lookin for more ores. died died died some more. ooooo im to cold down here make better gear go deeper. ... how'd i die that time ... oooo toxic fumes..... make more gear go deeper. build lots and lots of more goodies. go exploreing ..... wth almost craped my self when i ran into a giant worm spittin acid.  more turrets ( feels safer .... ) 


Honestly i could go on and on but theres so much to build / explore n do in this game it would take a long time to explain it all. but if you enjoy crafting / survival / builder games with logistics n factory line setups i would suggest this for you its waaaaaayyyyyyy better than minecraft it just has blocky voxels that look waaaay better than minecrafts anyway.",1459031086,1459031086,True,4,0,0.52499997615814209,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's hard even on the 'easy' settings to do anything really. With the combonation of heat/cold, energy storage of your suit only one begginer smelter and a whole lot of things early game take way too long! It is a time sink that is in my opinion far worse than other 'builder' games. I will compare to one that most everyone should know: Minecraft.

Comparing Minecraft to Fortresscraft
*You can easily build multiple smelters right from the start really/ Fortresscraft you may finally unlock a basic smelter after a few hours play.

*Ores are generally spawned with more of a pattern/ Fortresscraft is more luck based. Meaning it may take a few hours to even build the basics.

*You already know all crafting, you just need the proper tool/ Fortresscraft you need to scan almost everything, and research it. Use the researcher to gain building rights. Making the beginning game so long and tedious.

These are just a few issues I have.

One could argue: Recode the recipes in the data files. I shouldn't have to. One could say use creative mode. Then I lose out on needing anything and lose on battling enemies. Plus you don't get all the energy stuff or anything. Or none that I could see.

I wish there was a kind of hybrid creative/ survival mode. Kind of like how you can switch between the modes in Minecraft with commands. And the creative mode in Fortresscraft had ALL the blocks plus being able to battle enemies should you choose to.

So unless you have hours to sit down and figure this game out, don't expect anything to be built quickly. As it is, I can't reccomend it. Maybe it's not for me since I don't have hours and hours to sink into it to find everything and such. Which is why I like Minecraft better. If you want something that does similar to this but qucker, Try Factorio. You can even cheat if you wish, and I don't feel cheating ruined the game for me on that as I still do a lot.

It has potential. I love the idea of having a factory with belts/ transporters, and building a defensive base and all that. So I WILL check in on this game from time to time as I do like the ideas. It just needs to be a little more open I guess you could say. Allow us to do what we want, if we wish to speed things up some allow commands to do so or something.

Another is the spiderbot, which is supposed to defend your base, however it is a rubbish shot, and it spends its time getting in your way or damaging the terrain around and under your base making it difficult to move around. Need a way to switch it off or disable it.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Coming into FortressCraft my only survival building game experience has been minecraft. So I'd like to say my expectations were high. I had read FC Evolved was similar to Tekkit modded minecraft and I was getting excited. 
Firstly I dislike space themed anything - and this is definitely space themed - but I've found it to be fine.

My first 10mins of gameplay I was confused AF. It's fun to learn and work out what you have to do - which could be avoided by watching a gameplay of FC Evolved on YT, but I wanted to throw myself into the deep end. I'm at 20+hrs in, 17hrs of which in this one world, where I like to pretend I know what I'm doing. And I feel I've barely scratched the surface.  Once you figure out a methodology and approach, and are fast acting on it, I think you could have a world up and running a LOT faster than what I've done in this first attempt - and that's one of the selling points, become efficient.

[h1]Pros/Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Loads of gameplay
+Looks pretty [I run at good, and occasionally stutters - my gfx card runs Farcry 4 at decent settings]
+I love the mobility [compared to MC]
+I love the grappling hook mechanic
+I love ctrl+clicking to build 30blocks in a straight line
+I love seeing a base grow and become automated
+I love pressing K to find where I placed that ore extractor, because I totally forgot where I put it
+Addicting gameplay
+Always something to do/alter/change/move/collect/kill/mine/ping
+You can leave it in the background/ALTTab and even on single player, the world continues to simulate - so if you have automated mining set up, you can do other things away from your PC and come back to collect smelted ores.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-I wish there was lights - early on. Throwing a bright green torch is ugly and hurts my eyes :')
-I wish conveyor belts could be placed with ctrl+click, as that would save me time
-I wish the music was better? A lot of annoying sounds. I find it actually nicer to play with sound off becaues of this.
- Confusing progression.

Overall, I paid ~$15.00 for it[?], and it has been worth it. I plan to put a lot more hours in.

Ausrüstungsteile für Bot und Anzug verrotten im inventar und verbrauchen unnötig speicherplatz. 

zudem öffnet sich immer und immer wieder die Develop console in Höllen und verdeckt knapp den halben bildschirm.

I have played for many hours(although a lot of that time was spent afk... I tend to forget I have games running) The basic concept of the game is great, gather resources, build massive assembly lines, defend against attacks, all to save yourself when you crashed on a freezing planet.  So then why the negative review?  

The game appears to be a released title but upon deeper investigation (after I had bought the game, stupid me) I realized that it was still in Alpha/Beta but the developer wanted to make more money so he ""released"" it on steam.  The game has missing icons/textures, wonky AI, and is still has a MASSIVE list of features to be added, bugs to fix, and balance issues to address.  I havn't encountered the game breaking crashes/bugs others have reported.  IF I WANTED TO PLAY EARLY ACCESS I WOULD BE HAPPY.  The game is being updated and features are being added.  The negative review stems from the fact that it is not a complete game even though it appears that way at first.

Oh, also the dev has stated that he is breaking the game into several expansion packs.  So you only get part of the content for your initial purchase.  However he only recently decided this(or made it clear).  I can understand wanting to get paid but it is sneaky and dishonest to publish an unfinished game and then charge people more money if they want the finished product.  If all this were clear on the store page I wouldn't be writing this review(and would probably be fine with it... although i would have waited until the game was complete before considering purchase).  The sneaky way it is handled is what bothers me.

So FOR NOW I do not reccomend purchasing this game.  When it is finished (provided it get's there, i've had baaad luck with early access titles, I will rewrite this review.

[list]
[*] the inconsistent naming scheme for PCBs and research pods - why not just name them after what they're made from like everything else?
[*] the agonisingly slow start - early expansion appears to be restricted solely to add hours played, even though most of it is just waiting for ore to be smelted or items to be researched
[*] the boring reliance on tiers, or multiple versions of the same object as a way to increase complexity - having fewer items made from multiple ore types would be better IMO

It's like a cross between Factorio and Minecraft like others have said, a couple key features that really stand out though. First is the fact I'm pretty sure there's no limit to how deep you can dig. Gameplay zones right now go as deep as what, 1000 blocks or something? A minecraft map is 128 blocks from the tip top of the ceiling to the very bottom of bedrock, with only around 60-80 of those being actual land blocks and not empty space. In Fortresscraft, you keep digging down to progress further in the game, and right now I think the last zone is around 1000 blocks or so with plans to develop layers even deeper than that.

Second is the uh, the holoview or whatever, where you hit a button and you can see all your constructions through walls. So when you're digging around and trying to get all your power lines to match up underground, you don't have to count blocks. You just hit a button and bam, everything is visible. It's truly amazing. Also yes, there's elevators.

If you have any interest in this kind of thing whatsoever, give this man your money. Even in its current state you'll have a blast messing around with stuff, and future plans to develop it into a full PVP base-versus-base type game have already been stated, so seriously, give this guy your money.

That is not to say that building is a wasted effort.  With a little bit of creativity and ingenuity you can create some pretty impressing structures and fortresses.   

The method of researching new tech through discovery and a later stage Research Laboratory was a welcome change to other methods I have seen leveraged.  I cannot wait to see what awaits for Tier 4 and beyond.

The survival mode GUI is still a bit rudimentary but it has been promised by the developers that it will see improvement by the time the game is finished.  A hopper GUI is a much anticipated addition.

Het leuke van dit spel is dat je het minen en verwerken op een zo goed mogelijke manier moet automatiseren (omdat het anders verveelt), maar de automatisering kost ook weer resources. Een redelijke planning is wel noodzakelijk.
Apparaten die je bouwt kan je overal meenemen zonder kosten gelukkig. Maar ze hebben meestal wel stroom nodig, waar dus ook je grootste uitdaging ligt.

Edit: The developer commented, so i figured I'd give a bit more detailed reasoning as to why I returned this game.
a) the game runs like ass on a current gen ASUS,
b) the first game I played I spent 20 minutes debugging why the power hub and conveyer setup wasn't working (the hub spawned a block too high), and had to restart
c) you've published the game with the developer console active
d) the robot tries to fly into the optimal place to display its message(which was clipped by the edge of the screen for me), and it took me several minutes of chasing him down before I realized that's what was going on,
e) there's a general lack of visual communication when you look at objects to try to figure out what they do,
f) things that, I assume, were working normally, looked buggy and unpolished, like the intro screen and the level generation screen
g) the visuals and audio, while hardly placeholder, desperately need a polish pass (the lighting and shaders especially)
h) you can die in the starting zone simply by not learning the game fast enough.

Then they played that for a bit and thought, ""This, too, is pretty fun. But it wasn't really made for this...I bet I could make something like this, but better."" And so they did. 

Starting out can be rough, depending on your world. I tried a couple before I found one I was happy with. It will take time.The game is heavily based around automation, so you can continue to dig deeper and find new things, then automate those new things to get it all back to your base. At first, you will have to babysit things. You simply don't have the resources to get things rolling on their own for the first hour, maybe two. Watch a couple of videos on it. You'll see how others do things, you'll get a good understanding of the basics, and you'll have some ideas as to how to set your own system up. It takes a lot of time to really get a lot going on, but if building up to that isn't your cup of tea, then I might advise a different game type. There are several more mechanics at play here than in MineCraft, and pretty much any other game in this vein. It takes a lot of the concepts explored in Space Engineers, removes space, and instead focuses on mining materials and setting them up to work for you. 

Never played anything else quite like it. As of this writing, the devs have moved to a new engine and made several quality of life improvements.

And on to the review itself...

Fortresscraft is something I have difficulty playing objectively. I snagged the original back when I was a gamer on the Xbox 360 before switching to PC, and I was not impressed. It was a 'Minecraft clone', in the sense that it was blocky and HD and there was not much value in it other than blowing up the water and watching the broken physics for it cause it to spread across the entire world, but only after you had reloaded the level.

Upon seeing this title on Steam, I was, understandably, not impressed. So, after downloading the Dev-given game and booting it up, I found a few things out.

First, the game has some derps and issues. The tutorial can be confusing and derped at times, leaving you with little idea of what to do. I have heard there's a wiki up at this point, but there was not one when I started.

You enter with little idea of how to do things, which can honestly be great. I've played Dwarf Fortress with less. Still, however, it's not a great introduction.

Further on, I can see hints that this is something that I might enjoy and thrive in if I could only [i]get it[/i], for lack of a better word. It's not that the game is complex, it's that I just can't figure out where to go, after a bit. So many things that would really improve things for me are either missing, or I am not finding them.

I know, and I can see, that this is really a good game, especially where it came from. I did have a bit of fun, and the mechanics are mostly solid, but I just couldn't get very far.

Overall, the reason this is 'recommended' is because, in the end, I know it's a good game. It just isn't my type of game. I'll stick with my complex RTS addiction for my fix.

I currently have ove 500 hours put into a game that I payed 12.99 dollars US for, even for a single play though of the story you are looking at a 100+ hours of game play.

Not to mention that the developer is all over the forums, Twitch and updating the beta build of the game often multiple times a day. If you play the other voxel based survival game you should do yourself a favor and try out this one, or check out one of the several streamers on Twitch, or YouTube. We are trying to get the word out and dispel some myths about this game.

If you like Factorio and Voxel Based games you really need to check out this game.

After even more development and the release of an expansion the game just keeps getting better. Alot of people use the words MineCraft Clone and Factorio to describe this game, however this game stands on its own and is much better that way. 

I love this game and will continue to play it and see where the developer takes the game.",1457098749,1511617879,True,8,0,0.590640604496002197,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Highly, Highly recommended game especially if you enjoyed modded minecraft and/or Factorio.  Why?  Becauase this takes the best of both of them and puts it into a really nice game.  Developed by a really great guy who is both always improving the game and always listening and responding to comments.

Since my last review on march, 2015 it would take too long to list all the items that were added.  Even since the first paid expansion, Frozen Factory, was released it would take too long to list all the things that were added to the base game for NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.   This is free content that doesn't even require the DLC that was released after the DLC.  The entire tutorial system has been changed, a new robotics system is being worked on, induction chargers ect.  Just to give a little idea of how much the game has changed, there has been 14 content patches since my review(16 since exiting early access) each giving new quality of life features, new machines, new mechanics along with a major expansion.  Each patch has a public beta that updates every day or every few days with balance changes, bug fixes, ect.  

It is a game that can take as little or as long as you like.  On the easiest settings a 50 hour game is possible.  on the hardest settings alone, you are probably looking more to 200-400 hours even more with the expansion.

It's a game where you can design things as simply or as complex as you like.  You can for the most part play it however you like.  Don't want to setup complex automation, it's possible to do everything without using some of the advanced stuff.  Might not be as efficient but still possible.

Without a doubt if you like automating stuff, if you like to add some base defense to that automation, and if you like the thrill of going up a 400m mineshaft using a grappling hook at high speeds this is the game for you.  It's a game where in the 50-200h of playing you can always find something to do!




<old review follows>

Let's start by saying that this game is still being heavily developed despite being out of early access.   Some of the newer stuff doesn't have icons but besides that the game is basically 100% completable in what constitutes a pretty decent end-game that can take 50-100+ hours to get to, with additional difficulty settings for pretty good replayability.

The game does a good job of combining a minecraft style sandbox with tower defense.  It takes some of the slow and annoying parts of minecraft and removes it and gives the player a lot of tools to assist them with common tasks such as building.  building 50 blocks in a straight line in survival mode is very convienent, not to mention no wait on breaking a block and protection mode from breaking multiblocks.  The grappling hook is quite fun to use and makes grappling up a verticle mining tunnel a lot of fun.  On my 4 year old computer the game runs smoothly even with a lot of stuff going on.  

Overall when buying this game remember some developers wait until they have everything that they can possibly do to the game done with before exiting early access, this allows them to make excuses for whatever bugs are in the game.  This developer has done a great job at leaving early access and releasing a very stable main build along with a constantly updated bleeding edge build.  The game might not be as complete as some other games that have exited early access, but it is stable, there is a lot of fun things to do, and my biggest complaint about the game is that $12 is just way too cheap.  I would of gladly paid $20-$30 for it possibly $40",1456995723,1497372362,True,10,0,0.600671589374542236,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I decided back then to let it mature before buying it. As such I was excited to see it was out of early access and the full release was out.

As another voxel based survival game this one seperates itself from the pack by focusing more or automation and refinement, matched really only by Factorio (but in 3D!!!). It looks great, at first glance, until I bought the game and played it...

It played smooth. REAL smooth, in that it was between 150 and 200 FPS. There is an option in the Settings menu to change that, but it didn't do anything. No change whatsoever. So you try restarting the game, and there is still no difference. Now that is a pretty basic thing to set up, so why it doesn't function is beyond me (again, in a full title out of early access). It hogged all my computers resources to keep up with that rediculous update speed. But ow well, let's play on!

So you start in a tutorial setting, protected from outside influences by a forcefield, which lifts when the tutorial is done. Awesome! The tutorial is short but informative, so even after restarting hundreds of games I can't see much of a speedbump there, and it's practical...Until the shield lifts and a giant spider robot walks over your base, its feet several blocks away from its legs (assuming said legs aren't jerking over it's head).

At this point I noticed the text at the bottom right of the screen saying Development Build...Okay, probably started a Beta through Steam???...uhm...no...the game is still in beta...and the spider is supposed to be some kind of boss enemy to be encountered later in the game, which was left at the players spawn probably to debug / test.

Why do I have a Development Build for a game that has been out for 5 / 6 months and without running a Beta?

This game is not done, and it is out of early access. I concider that seriously disrespectfull towards the customer and a violation of my consumer rights. I don't mind buying a product that isn't finished, as long as you're honest about that and don't play morally and legally questionable games.

In 10 years of Steam patronage I have never ask for a refund, and to be honest I thought Age Of Survival warranted it, but at least they are honest about the game not being done yet...

EDIT: People don't seem to understand, so to make a bit more clear: I liked this game, I really did, but there is no excuse for selling a game that isn't finished, that is still a 'Developer Build'. The moment we as consumers accept that as 'okay' we collectively accept blatant disregard for our consumer rights and those rights will disappear.

Steam has agreed with my complaint by refunding my payment, so at least I know I'm not entirely wrong by fighting this...",1456855318,1456940558,False,10,0,0.510346889495849609,15,True,False,False,False,,,

Если с чем-то сравнивать, пожалуй больше всего похожа на майнкрафт с индустриальными модами, есть что-то (и немало) от факторио. Акцент делается на разнообразную машинерию и подземный мир. Можно копать очень-очень глубоко и, помимо руд, находить разные интересные вещи. Продуманная система развития: на изучение новых технологий, помимо ресурсов и энергии, расходуются очки науки, которые можно добыть, исследуя окружающую среду. Присутствует подробная контекстная справка, напоминающая мод НЕИ для майнкрафта - не нужно часами изучать вики, чтобы понять, что из чего крафтится и для чего и как используется.

Отдельно стоит обратить внимание на уровень сложности - он очень хорошо сбалансирован в сравнении с большинством игр данного жанра. Мы защищаем центральный хаб (главная постойка базы) от волн мобов. На дефолтной сложности никто не мешает спокойно играть - если хаб расстреляют, он просто перезагрузится. Однако, чтобы пройти игру до конца (само по себе наличие логического завершения большая редкость для подобных игр), на поздних этапах игры хаб необходимо защитить. Другими словами, можно сколько угодно играть свободно без каких-либо ограничений, но если хочешь достичь поставленной цели - надо постараться. 

Особые мазахисты, помимо изменения условий смерти (например дроп или полная потеря всего инвентаря, либо смерть навсегда), могут поставить режим, при котором хаб при взрыве не восстанавливается, и игра заканчивается (по-моему даже мир удаляется) - своеобразный местный хардкор-мод. Плюс можно поменять скорость конвеерных линий, количество ресурсов в мире, объем генерируемой энергии, в общем скорость развития. Таким образом сложность настраивается очень гибко.

И последнее, но не по важности - на данный момент (февраль 2016) игра активно поддерживается разработчиком. Периодически выходят апдейты - оптимизация, фиксы, новый контент. Если почитать планы разработчика (где-то на форуме игры в стиме), можно увидеть ОЧЕНЬ много всего. Впрочем это относится ко многим играм, но в большинстве случаев эти проекты так и остаются проектами. В данном случае есть реальная надежда, что автор сдержит обещания.

Короче говоря, можно с уверенностью рекомендовать любителям покопать, подобывать, построить, покрафтить, и главное - позащищать базу :)

ЗЫ. Игра не так уж проста, требует логического мышления: строить линии добычи и производства, грамотно распределять ресурсы и энергию, и т.п. 

ЗЗЫ. Не смотрите на время, проведенное мною в игре - играю с выключенным инетом, и стим не учитывает это время. Реальное время игры несравнимо больше :)",1456420359,1456420359,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The developer, a single person, continually releases patches on bleeding edge. I'm in the beta (which is a step higher) and even there you get a lot of nice updates still. The core version won't tend to see updates often, so i recommend opting into beta.

There is so much potential for this game. If you like minecraft but sucked at building and making things look nice, or like playing with redstone, then you'll love this game without a doubt.

Multiplayer, at least ""out of the box"" did not work for us.  Computers would not connect and always generated a ""connection timed out"" and UPNP needs to be enabled or port 27012 forwarded statement within the game.  Sadly, there is no option of just clicking on your steam friends name and sending an invite.   

  I ended up spending over 3 hours troubleshooting this error to finally give up in frustration and decided to refund this.   UPNP was enabled on both PC's.  Port 27012 was forwarded in the router and added to the firewall exemptions. I even went as far as to drop all the firewalls and see if that would allow the games to communicate. It did not.

 In this day and age UPNP enabled on both PC's should just work. It doesn't with this game, or at least, doesn't with me. 

 Throw me in the ""computers for dummies crowd"" or whatever, but I can say with complete confidence that many titles on Steam and elsewhere have a very smooth multiplayer connection system that works with a few clicks of the mouse. This does not.  

When I spend more time troubleshooting a games systems than playing the game, it's time for me to move on. 

In summary, right now the multiplayer connection system for this title  is archaic at best. It feels and looks like something I'd play in a Early Access game.   

I suppose it could be a good game, and I'd love to revisit this title once they clean up their attempt at multiplayer connectivity.

I must say though, that if your computer is a toaster, it'll get frustrating with the game turning into a slide-show. This game isn't exactly friendly on your ram or proccessing capabilities, but you can drop the detail and graphics WAY down and still have a good time, it'll just look like it was done on the N64. But, normally this game is gorgeous, provided you have the computer to handle it.

For those of you who are experienced in minecraft (particularly tech mods) you'll discover that you will be making LOTS of controll based mistakes. Also, you'll have a decent understanding of tech progression, however, it is dificult to know ahead of time what you need to do. I would recomend that you play a few worlds to better understand what to do, and what way you prefer the most to do it. Your first few worlds are likely to fail in your eyes, this is fine, and fixable at just about any time, but you can always start fresh.

I would like to see a more comprehensive creative mode, as it does not lend to helping you actually mess around with logistical ideas, and what not, which I would like to see. currently, if you have an idea to use a system, you have to just try it out, which makes experimentation a potentially costly endeavour.

As for the gameplay itself, it can be very technical. You have to build a logistics and mining network to defend your base from attacks, generate power, and be very careful not to feed any near by hive minds.

Auf vieles wird bezug genommen und ich lese auch häufig Beiträge von den Entwicklern, aber auch hier scheint es keine konsequente Linie zu geben.)*

Das Spiel selbst bietet mir, was ich erwartet habe und mehr.
Eines der Zeitintensivsten, interessantesten und komplexeten ""Survival-Crafting-Spiele"" die ich so bisher kennenlernen durfte.
Stets denke ich mir ""Wie, noch mehr, noch tiefer?"", was das Spiel gerade so reizvoll mach.
Der Umfang ist enorm und mit genug kreativität und einsatz, lässt sich eine vollautomatische Produktion einrichten.
Grafisch ist das Spiel weniger erwähnenswert und die performance könnte auch stabiler sein.

Beispiel:
Egal ob ich nun in meiner fortgeschrittenen Welt spiele, wo viel Kram existiert oder ich auf einer neuen Welt starte, die Spielwelt wird ungenügend geladen, was den Spielfluss dramatisch behindert, bis hin zur unspielbarkeit.

Inzwischen hat sich viel getan. Die Welt ist atmosphärischer geworden und auch die Leistung hat sich verbessert. Der Umfang ist weiter gestiegen und es gibt inzwischen ein DLC (Frozen Factory). Kosmetische DLC zähle ich nicht! Da sich einige Dinge verbessert haben, werde ich meine Review ändern.

However, FCE is focused on machines, rather than farming. Even in an unfinished state it has significant depth, and the blessing of a dev who is happy to listen and to incorporate ideas from the community. The game has had constant updates since I first purchased it, and I keep coming back after the major ones to replay and see all the new content. 

It's already great, but once finished it will be fantastic. It's very worth the purchase.

*UPDATE*

The latest updates have had some issues IMHO. The game is still a lot of fun, but the Frozen Factory expansion is very grindy. The only reason I've kept playing is because I can fire it up at work for 6 hours and leave it alone.

There's also a distinct feeling that the developer is no trying to force players into playing a very specific way and thus destroying the freedom that made the game so great in the first place. That's his prerogative as the designer, but that doesn't make it any less disappointing. 

If some of the more heavy-handed tweaks are able to be turned off in the future, I'll update the review, but that doesn't seem likely. I still recommend the game, but not as wholeheartedly as before.",1454716691,1474282336,True,3,0,0.514856100082397461,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Hooray!

This game's been out of early access for a couple months now, but it gets more content in its free monthly patches than a fully supported Blizzard game.  There is an upcoming, 8 dollar expansion pack that I'd gladly pay for (Dev's cat's gotta eat) based on what I've seen thus far.  To anyone confused about the patreon bit: A patreon sub enables a very small handful of cosmetic, VIP ""bling"" blocks if you will, and early access to the expansion.  It's a donation with a tiny thank you; not a sales' offer.

My original review, less my comment on multiplayer:

Factorio meets Minecraft, kind of like playing feed the beast/Industrial craft mods but with the cohesion of a single dev behind it rather than 100 separate mods in a package that never works or updates quite right.

If all of that's greek to you, the game consists of finding raw materials, and constructing the logistics to extract, move, and process them, either into more logistics, research pods, or defenses against attacking wasp things.  

The GOOD:
Engaging base building game
Lots of recipes to craft across several tiers of stuff.
Good visual feedback on logistics letting you know what's working or not
Still being actively developed (IE more's coming)

The BAD:

Currently there's very little variety in the enemies that attack you, or your defenses to deploy against them.

Gameplay between the last available research and charging the OET (winning) is currently just a huge grind for more power generation.  I expect this gap will later be filled with more interesting content, but were the dev to win the lottery and stop making the game, it'd be poorly balanced in its present state.



Overall, I could recommend this game: it's less than the cost of minecraft and basically takes the most interesting parts of minecraft to me and expands them.  WIth the mulitplayer issues fixed I expect this will be a fantastic game to play on LANs or with a small group of friends.",1454625122,1465479562,True,4,0,0.514856100082397461,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Looking for a minecraft clone? Then you're not going to find one here. After many years of running modded minecraft servers, I was quite sick to the back teeth of the game. That being said, I did get this game thinking there would be some similarities and expected to get bored very quickly. This game, quite simply put, is amazing. The developer is nothing short of a genius!

The game has you start with afew supplies, after crash landing on an Alien planet. You are given a small tutorial, and then thrown into the deep end. At this point, I went and watched a few episodes of Direwolf20's lets plays. After being educated a little.. I jumped back into the game. 

You begin by scanning for various ores, and setting up mining equipment. While this is happening you will be also scanning new blocks and plantlife. This accumulates research points which you can use to unlock new research projects and equipment. 

It's not long past this point, you realise that 5 hours of game time has passed, and you've simply got lost in this enormous game! By this point I had found my first 4 ore types, and had begun building a system of convayors that could fill my smelters on the surface. Research seemed very simple at first.. but another few hours in and I was now constructing a lab and researching new projects was taking several hours at a time. This was ok though because I had so much other stuff to do while this was happening. 

However.. the bigger your base becomes, the more power you use.. the higher your base threat becomes.. and it's not long before you threat analyser is telling you.. ""Attack immanent!"". Now for those like me who love the tech, and the factory side of the game.. the invading alien swarms will only attack your central hub.. and once it's health is 0, it just reboots. That is unless you're playing hardcore.. and then its game over. 

So as I went deeper into the ground, I realised just how big this game was. Some of the caves, from top to bottom, were bigger than minecraft, bedrock to sky... I would liturally hold my breathe incase I fell off a ledge, as death meant I would drop all my equipment. So far i've been 1,187 blocks deep.. and everytime I go exploring, I just can't explain the feeling of being so small, in caves so large.. 

This game is great for those wanting some survival, some tower defence, and some tech. I love all the machines that automate the ore collecting and the minecarts that collect the ores.. the way the power system works, and the defending of my base. It really is very well balanced... and it has just the right difficulty level to keep most playing, and not getting bored.

this is my first review ever. Really like this game. I find it hard to remain interested in games after a day of smashing them, but im still playing this one. So that says something pretty big. Also my mrs is starting to hate this game as im on it too much.

Pros 
-Exceptionally fast load time. once you double click the games shortcut, you are in world within a 15-20 seconds. great for those of us impatient or busy people. I really really hate bull**** loadtimes. I want to play a game not make a cup of coffee and come back while waiting for the main menu.

-Good game progression.  for once a game that doesnt bog you down waiting for research, construction, or resource gathering/grinding. It has a nice balance of automation to the point where all that stuff can be done while you are off exploring. Ive often been off exploring a cavern and come back only to find that the slowest part of the system is myself and it is easy to get to the point of automation that most things become trivial (Wtf do i do with 5k copper now?)

-enemies and death. you can make the game as hard as you like, and the consequences of death as permanent or trivial as you like in world gen. Which is really nice when you are still learning how to grapple around a massive cavern or falling down a really big hole.

- The world. OMFG it is huge. The underground caverns are enormous, like really really really big and the terrain changes with depth, always serving up something different.

-in game help. it is incredibly intuitive. It could be a little more indepth with some items but still very well thought out and just a blessing.

-holobase function. you can track realtime how your network is functioning and where any bottlenecks are

-good steam community who have most answers for you.

-developer that is active on forums and takes interest in our feedback.

cons

-there is no way to pause the game as yet. you can camp out next to a torch or leave and come back (which is not that big of a deal due to fast load times) but pause would be awesome when you have the mrs trying to talk to you or a baby screaming at you. I understand the dev has said that it is a survival game but it could be a deal breaker for some gamers.

-controls take a while to get used to. now and again im still trying to access hoppers with e. 

-the options could be a little more in depth with the sounds and music. took  google to find out how to turn off music (ctrl -m)

-a coordinate system would make digging holes to your mining operations soo much easier. 

all in all a great early access game. very well thought out and designed. a clear development roadmap and it gives you what it promises. anyway back to the mrs tasks",1453694921,1453694921,True,3,0,0.508644700050354004,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The downsides I find with this game are primarily in its aesthetic. There are no biomes excepting the default snow/hill template. This makes the surface world uninteresting to explore.

If you enjoyed modding Minecraft with things like machines and power, then this is basically that done properly.

The immense fun in this game comes from building bigger and bigger..  More power required, more ore required.. More, more, MORE!  You always want and need more!  But that's a balanced gradual process and before long you have a sprawling power network powering deep mines and a massive turret network on the surface to defend against the planet's creatures' attacks which ramp up and up as you grow.

It's constantly being developed (sometimes 3-4 patches a day on the bleeding edge line) and the main dev is fantastic and very active on the steam forum, always listening to and answering comments.

Automation from the ground up is aim of this game, so it's good to see a game like this, in it's current state, with the vast array of machines and upgrades it's possible to get. And it's blatantly clear how much there is for the developer to add, this is a game that you will spend well over two days (not two days in real life, but 48 hours in game) on now, come back and lose even more time later, with a bunch of new content.

While the tutorial maybe boring and dull, leading you through utter basics, the game features a world gen that is awe insipiring, with canyons carving scars in the terrain and caves seemingly without a bottom. Not to mention a literally infinite world.

A gem that I might have otherwise over-looked.

EDIT:
I will clarify about the games ""status"". It is a FULL release, with active support. It means there are bugs still in the game, but these are patched and fixed by the developer. It is by no means early access, the main game itself is complete, with DLC (coming, as of time of writing) to expand on the current content, not a cash grab.

Fortresscraft Evolved is one of those few games in active developpments since many years. My last review was in 2013 and since what was a creation sandbox game is now a very good MC like with a true survival twist.
The goal of FC is to build a base and make it grow in order to survive against monsters and leave the planet. The more the base grow, the more enemies are dangerous. So this is a giant tower defense mixed with a FPS and some Minecraft. A very good mix !
But in front of all, FC answer the question ""Why do I have to build all those things ?"". Here the answer is clear: To survive and reach the ultimate goal after MANY hours.
FC is a very good game, which brings the MC concept ahead on a new path, and the love of the dev for his game is no more to prove ! A real indy game in the spirit as all should be.

Fortresscraft Evolved fait parti de ces rare jeux ayant un suivi étonnant de la part du développeur. Ma dernière évaluation datait de 2013 et depuis ce qui était un jeu de construction bc à sable est devenu un minecraft-like à la vraie sauce survie.
Le but de FC est de faire grandir sa base suffisemment pour enfin séchapper de la planète. Et au plus la base grossit au plus l'ennemi attaque. Nous avons donc à faire à un mega tower defense mélangé avec du FPS et du Minecraft. Un superbe mélange.
Mais surtout, enfin, FC est un jeu qui répond à la question ""Pourquoi contruire dans ce type de jeu ?"". Ici la réponse est claire: Pour survivre et atteindre votre objectif après beaucoup d'heures.
FC est un très bon jeu, qui ose emmener le Minecraft like sur un chemin peu exploité, et l'amour du développeur pour son titre n'est plus à prouver. Un vrai jeu indé dans toute sa splendeur.

Take the technic mod from Minecraft and make it 100 times better.  

This is one of those games that are pretty simple to figure out, but as you progress it gets a bit more complicated.  Mainly this game is all about logistics.  Getting resources transported from your mine to your base so you can smelt it and make new items and do research.  All while defending your base from aliens that attack you if your base threat gets over 100%.  If you like a game about logistics you will love this game.  At first it starts off very slow and you manually do everything, but as you progress you start to automate.  It is when you get to the point where you start automating everything where it can either be a whole ton of fun or a logistics nightmare.  You have to make sure you have enough ore coming in to feed your smelters.  So you are always looking for new veins of ore to tap and send up to your base to be smelted.  Plus having to figure out how to get power down to your mine and also keeping a nice design of your base.  

One thing to remember is you can just about move anything except for the CPH and the research station.  So don't be afraid if you build your base one way and want to change it later.  I have done so many redesigns to my bases because I didn't play far enough ahead and had to tear most of it down and rebuild it.

I am not going to do a Pro's and Con's list.  Because it is still in early access and things change almost on a daily basis.  Also remember that this game is early access and things do change.  

Overall it is a very enjoyable game and I have put in tons of hours into it and I am looking forward to new things as they get added so I can implement them into my base design.  

I do recommend you run the Bleeding Edge beta if you are planning to play it because it has all the newest stuff in it.  

Also the Dev is really awesome and have talked with him several times and he loves input about the game.  I stream this game and he has watched my stream several times and has even helped me out a few times because I didn't have things setup properly and he walked me through it.  He talks with others in chat in the stream and answers questions people have.  This is the first time I have actually seen a dev actually watch a stream of their own game and ask for feed back from those watching and from the person streaming.

One of the games more creative solutions is a game option to let the system adjust graphic options based on a framerate you set. This can be annoying at times but it works fairly well in keeping the game running smoothly which is especially useful for older machines.

The one bllindly bought game like some many others has done with so many games.But this one particularly is the cherry on the cake :). With so many already included items and machines,the possiblities for this game is only limited to your time and imagination. Grappling hooks,automated quarries and excavators.Endless conveyors and much much much more... If you are truly into building automated machinery (Minecraft:Industrail craft/Mekanism etc.) or (Factorio) then this game truly is worth a try.
Combining tower defence,both on the surface and underground(to protect your resource extracting monster machinery) and combining the creativity of all the Indie/sandbox games out there.

First experience?

-Spawned in...

-Got a fright due to gaint spider robot

-Built my first automated copper extractor

-Felt like a boss

-Found a cave...fell down deep below

-Figured out that F was grappling hook

-Used it...and died a horrible death

The world made of cubes and mining had already been around before minecraft, and moreover its an aesthetic that is not something minecraft owns. If you can't get past the ""all cube based games are minecraft copies"" then stop reading here, onto the meat.

Pros:

1. This is a common one yet still important, the option to play with high or low difficulty in finding ore, the strength of hostiles, and even obtaining the energy you will so dearly need throughout the game. This is important as being able to enjoy the game from both a higher level and casual standpoint is a must.

2. The hostiles, they are exactly what should be in a game like this, instead of only straight forward hit you and the face type ememies you have an enemy that will attach itself to your conveyor belts and such and devour all your ores making its nest ( the hivemind ) larger, and a little stealth cube thing that will drain power from your mining set up underground. Better yet, they still include a straight forward hit you in the face mob, and a little or dropping resource mob to boot for your tin needs.

3. Instead of making you dig out a staircase, one of the most tedious  hardships one usually faces in ""cube games"", this game offers a high powered grappling hook, you can dig straight down and then grapple back up, this may seem overpowered however it will already take you quite some time to acquire resources and set up your automated mining and power system, if getting back to the surface were to take forever each time this game would be rendered unplayable by those of us who just dont have enough time.

4. The automation that can be achieved in this game is satisfying, when you go from having to run back in forth to your copper mine set up to watching the copper roll in on a conveyor into your hopper then into your smelter, and at the moment you are looking at the 200+ stack of copper, you will feel a level of satisfaction on par with properly heating a plate of pizza rolls and not burning your tongue and throat.

Cons:

1. Despite what I said earlier about the hostiles, the game could probably use a bit more in this area, if you know what you are doing they are pretty easy to handle as is, there doesnt need to be too much more of this but some for sure.

2. The learning curve, if you dont watch some videos, you are likely to flounder about having no idea what you are doing, this does hurt the game quite a bit. If you are against checking out some videos to figure things out this might be the deciding factor for you.

3. Being a little to intense with the autmation, if you arent a fan creating (sometimes) complex systems to acquire, smelt, and convert your ore into useful objects then this game just isnt for you.

4. The name, if you have played the old fortresscraft, then you go in expecting something quite different from what you will get, it is misleading and could be the leave a sour impression depending on whether you did your research or not.

Conclusion:

I gave an equal number of pros and cons, what comes down to is if you enjoy automation, and thinking, then theres a pretty high chance you will enjoy this game, if not continue on, and if you arent into that, but you still want to give it a go, thats awesome.",1452081796,1452081796,True,3,0,0.53016817569732666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Quite feature-rich and playable, while still being in active (and community engaged) development, yet designed with the innate desire (I would say promise, if this wasn't the world of software with its ever-emergent unknowable bugs) that its development will never force a world reset.  The dev is on the forums almost daily, actively engaging with users re: feature tweak/addition suggestions, bug reports, balancing issues... rather than buying a buggy in-development game and getting cryptic or dismissive responses to your suggestions/issues from the obvious PR arm of things (as opposed to the techies who know what the bleep you're talking about), you're buying Minecraft-esque access to a living, /thriving/ beta version, with much less endemic issues than Minecraft, ALONG WITH front-row tickets to real-life large-scale game development unfolding in front of your eyes.

And, it is incredibly well-optimized when it comes to visual/computing-resource playability.  My favorite feature of the game, far and away, is found not in the gameplay, but in the settings menu: click a checkbox, set your target framerate, and the game will take ahold of the quality and render distance settings in order to keep you achieving that.  In a frenetic base with umpteen-gazillion things going on, it'll automatically turn down shadows and maybe kill the render distance - just like our IRL brains would tend to focus on a small subset of the goings-on in a real hectic factory - while during landscape exploration, you can get the voxel equivalent of Skyrim's brilliant vistas.  (Hint to DJ: World-gen structures of awesomeness maybe?)

Geeky stuff aside, the gameplay... wait, never mind about ""geeky stuff aside.""  If you just want another alien shoot-em-up with resource management and base-building mechanics in the tactical background, then this game isn't for you.  If you want a tower-defense game where mobsKilled is proportional to resourcesAvailable through some arcana, this isn't the game for you.  If you want another (Modded) Minecraft, where you have the option that the base can be there just for aesthetics, or for helping you The Player become the Great Lone Warrior and Loot-Collector of Your Infinite Domain (not that many take this option, but from some of the forum posts, quite a few do), this isn't the game for you.

BUT, if you want a game that blends ALL these elements, plus ever-present environmental factors, automation systems that would appeal to Rube Goldberg and Henry Ford alike, and a strong requirement to Go Forth and Explore... then as long as you can handle the irreducible complexities of such a system, this IS the game for you.  This is the game for the MacGyvers of Minecraft, the Fords of Factorio, the Kings of Kerbal, who want to apply their problem-solving, epic-failing, and grand-constructing skills to an infinite-yet-efficient landscape and a stable-yet-expanding game mechanics platform (with official modding support much closer than with Minecraft).

The game is incredibly deep. It has found the perfect balance between difficult and fun - nothing comes easy, but everything feels great once you get it. To the same note, the game has an incredible amount of complexity, but with the research system, it's rarely (if ever) overwhelming.

Even more than this, the developer is really responsive. You can just tell that this is his baby, and he is doing everything that he possibly can to make this everything we (the community) wants. -- And to that note, he has succeeded.

If you took a poor resolution minecraft texture pack, added rejected alien and weapon models from Garry's Mod, and threw the Tekkit mod in for some more ""originality"", you are left with Fortresscraft. 

- Gameplay is slow
- Block textures are disappointing
- Objects that are not a copy/paste from Minecraft texture packs do not fit the ""feel"" at all. Seriously, you are standing on blocky voxels but then pull out a Doom64-like building gun.
- Did I mention the game is slow?

I will be putting 1000's of hours into this game because its that good. The developer patches frequently, listens to the community, and even responds to tweets :P The whole experience is refreshing!

It's decent enough, however I personally found that the early game suffers from ""many paths, only one that is any good""

The tutorial teaches you about power automation, which is good.

The tutorial does not teach you that you can put multiple ores into the same hopper, and the game obscures that fact by only showing you the most recent item.  It seems you 100% need to do this to get your smelter operating with any sort of efficiency.  It should be part of the tutorial.

It feels like giving players access to the research path before they have _built_ the smelter upgrades and the suit & robot power upgrades is a mistake.  It consumes a ton of resources and takes focus away from the income engine.

There's lots of other odds and ends you can waste resources on early game, research is just the one that got me.


So the early game is not as broken as I thought, however I suspect it's been optimised for someone who already knows how to play.  New comers without existing knowledge are likely to get harshly punished for sub-optimal play.

pros 
-liberty you are free to start the way you want and explore the direction you want build you base the way you like it and  automate in the order you prefer 
-awesome automate system really look awesome to just go and watch all machine and robots take ore smelt them take the bars make them into plate then into pod and all that really awesome
-potential almost infinite  this game got huge potential it could be develop in massive amount of way lots of mode could be create and got to say map are huge 


Cons:  
-ill just die  something you will discover ore deep way deeper than where you usually hang like -500-600  and you gonna say like i should use the elevator every 38 to make my way up after i came here collect or to refill my coal or what ever but you gonna end up count up the ressource cost to do so(since elevator is crap only +38 height is the max i made it works(and i did try multiple times)  so you end up using solutions i wont pick up my toxic filter just go down collect everything out of the storage hopper i got there and wait to die ..

Dont get me wrong it work(on default setting) but it dosent feel right

-conveyor going vertical i know the devs did it because people complains too much about pipes cost and i got to agree you got to do it in order to progress at decent speed(in solo play anyway)  cause building pipes requires days of farming 4 nickel if i remember right per pipe mean if you wanna extract titanium at -400  you need 1600 bars wich mean 6400 ore in the best smelter got to agree the veins you were extracting will be empty by the time you collect all those ressources for me anyway

마인크래프트처럼 사각월드의 땅파기게임이라고 생각하면 편하지만, 조금 더 할일이 많다.

플레이어의 목표는 크게 5단계로 나뉜다.

1. 페이즈마다 몰려오는 적들을 물리치기 위해 터렛들을 지어 중앙허브를 지킨다. 지키지 못할경우 노멀모드라면 최후탈출포드가 리셋되고, 하드모드라면 바로 월드가 파괴된다.
2. 마인크와 같이 ""땅을 파기 위한 도구를 만들기 위해 땅을 판다"". 
3. 최후엔 탈출포드를 지어 행성에서 탈출한다.
4. 1,2,3을 위해 발전을 한다.
5. 4를 하기 가장 효율적인 에너지와 방어,땅파기 등을 할 건설을 기획한다.

주의점이라면 마인크래프트처럼 한 블록마다 한개의 광석으로 계속 땅을파며 캐는것이 아닌, 광맥을 찾아서 착굴기 등을 설치하여 그곳에서 계속 ""추출""하는 개념이다.
쉴새없는 일중독인 멀티테스킹 애호가라면 상당히 매력을 느낄 수 있을것이다.

사소한 단점들이라면, 급하게 미리해보기 개발을 끝내서 중후반 단계가 조금 엉성하고, 벨런싱이 그다지 좋지 못한편이다. 또한 개발자가 대놓고 말한 ""이 게임을 한판이라도 클리어하려면 최소 300시간을 들이도록 만들려 합니다""가 얼추 현실화 된것. 매우 긴 플레이타임을 자랑하며, 문제는 그 시간을 보내고서 게임을 클리어하고 나면 남는것은 허망함뿐이다. 탈출을 할만큼 발전을 했다면 천문학적인 건설과 기획을 반복했을텐데, 이런 자기만의 문명을 두고 몸만 우주로 다시 떠나야한다는것. 조금 슬플지도...
아, 게임을 하는놈들이 좀 광적빠돌이들임과 동시에 빠가들이다. 게임을 조금만 까도 몰려서 욕을 하고, 단점을 말해줘도 무조건 반대표를 던지며 동문서답이 특기인녀석들이다. 가급적이면 영어를 잘하더라도 스레드에 가서 질문을 하지 않는것이 옳다.

개인적인 평이라면, 이 게임은 아직 얼리엑세스를 탈피하지 못한 미완성의 게임이라고 느껴진다. 아니, 감히 평가하자면 이 게임은 최소 1년내로는 얼리엑세스를 벗어서는 안된다.

가령 ""OOO게임 출시! 패키지 3천원!""이라고 쓰인 간단한 게임을 켰을때 아이템 아이콘이 비어있거나 텍스쳐가 미완되어 벽 뒤가 보인다거나 하면 얼마나 분통이 터지겠는가? 이 게임이 그상태다. 그러면서 개발자가 꺼낸 말은 ""이제 출시도 했으니 버그픽스같은것도 돈이 되는데까지만 개발할랍니다. 솔직히 이거 돈 잘 안벌려요 ㅎ"" 라면서 이미 얼리엑세스로 구매한사람들에게 빅엿을 날리고 있다.

Everything about this game annoys me. I wanted desperately to like it, but the excessively busy graphics just meant I could hardly tell what I was doing. There are also a lot of tiny things that peeve me greatly with this game. One thing that annoyed me was that rotating lasers was such a pain. Lasers are your basic power transmission system: instead of moving electricity around with cables, you convert it to a laser, which you bounce around into your destination. Seems like a cool idea, right? Problem is, to do this, you have to rotate lasers to face the correct direction. However, there's no way of rotating it to face a specific direction; you just have to cycle through all its rotations until you get the one you want. In addition, for whatever reason, you can't point it perpendicular to the plane you placed it on. In other words, if you place it straight forwards and want it to point up instead, you can't even rotate it to face that way. Instead, you have to place the block again so that it's on a vertical plane. But if you're going to base it on the way I put it down, why not just do something more intuitive, like have it face towards the player? This is just one example of the tiny things that build up and eventually break the camel's metaphorical back.  I thought modded MineCraft was the least refined an automation builder could get, but despite being built from the ground up for this exact purpose, Fortresscraft Evolved is fiddlier, less visually appealing (in spite of its higher resolution), and unpolished.

Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) here to bring you a short overview of our review for FortressCraft Evolved. If you'd like to read our full, in-depth review, you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/fortresscraft-evolved-overview-and-review/

I've been watching FortressCraft Evolved evolve over the course of its development ever since we first previewed the game quite a long time ago and it's become an incredibly impressive and fun survival based game.

I'm normally the type of person to avoid survival based games in truth but out of the many that we've previewed so far FortressCraft remains one of my favorites, with it's incrediblly massive world to explore, tons of craftable equipment and excellent gameplay, it's a joy to play.

I will also say that the game requires an immense amount of time and patience to really get anywhere and since I lack the patience to create vast mining cities I found myself a bit bored after a while. This doesn't mean the game is bad however, it's just that I can't play a game for that long haha.

Definitely a recommended title though and I enjoyed following its development from a relatively small Early Access title to what it has become now. Still much more to come I imagine, 8.6/10.",1449259928,1449259928,True,12,2,0.500970363616943359,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Alright I started playing this game in early acces around patch 4. We are know on patch 10, beginning work on 11 soon. The game is fantastic. I found this game on the featured part of steam one day and thought, ""Hey I like modded minecraft, this might be fun."" I had never heard of games like factorio, but This game introduced me to that as well. Both of these games are similar and while  Voxel Games tend to be considered a minecraft copyright just due to popularity,  these are not that similar in gameplay. I consider this game to be much more mentally challenging than simple despite using a cube world generation (which actually makes the game much more enjoyable when compared to non-voxel games like Space engineers which does share some similarity to a vague extent with this game). 

The game starts you off with a nice tutorial introducing basic concepts. An ingame help entry is available for every block, machine, and item you see in the game. The game tests the players' ability to create well balanced logistics systems, mining operations using automated technology, and tower defense skills.
I never understood what big meant in a voxel game till playing this one. Minecraft worlds are 256 blocks tall. This game's first cave systems is found at -256. World's currently include content that is fully implemented all the way to -2000 meters down. 10x the depth of minecraft and 100x the content. There are around 11 different resources that need to be automated and all of them come with unique challenges involving their logistical transport. some are so far down that cargo lift elevators are needed to move 1000s of items at a time from deep underground to the surface for smelting. The game takes the logistics fo factorio, the easy to grasp gameplay of minecraft, combines them into a 3d world, adds unique challenges and mobs, throws in a bit of towerdefense early game, and a VERY UNIQUE enemy later with the first DLC that adds literally the same amount of content as the base game alone. These all combine to create what has been one my favorite games of all time. It's still updated almost daily on the beta branches and a new patch adding tons of content comes to the stable mainline every month. 

The 800 hour reviews that don't recommend the game simply have salt with the developer who I have never had an issue with and I've given him proably 50 ideas that have been shot down with logical reasoning as to why they shouldn't or can't be implented. Love the game, love the devs, and love the cost. 

I honestly don't see any downsides, and the game comes with over 12 different difficulty combinations that you can use to fine-tune the challenge to your liking. 200 hours seems like a lot for a full playthrough? drop it to Casual mode and you can speed run the thing in around 40. It's not nearly as hard, but it's still extremely fun. And upon completion of the survival mode, alternative game modes are unlocked offering new challenges. There is so much content in this game and even if a few things here and there aren't everyones cup of tea, $13 is not something that anyone can complain about. Call of Duty and other AAA games offer less content for their respecitve genres, less community interaction, and most of all, MUCH less balancing of implemented features based on player feedback. 

Buy it. Just do it. Thank Me later. And if you honestly don't enjoy the game as much as everyone else does, then refund it and say ""I tried something new and didn't give it an awful review on YELP"" No harm, no foul.",1448826427,1468379695,True,6,0,0.486666649580001831,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Haven't played the game in a while, made a new game last week but was busy with work.
Now I had a chill day before my shift tomorrow so I was gonna enjoy 4-5hrs of gaming time!

I was just gonna fix my smelting setup...
That was around 18:00.
Now it's 04:30 and I'm contemplating how to fix my turbine setup...

Is it worth it?
Choose your poision, go for a bad game and play for a few hours or go score some addictive Fortresscraft. You'll lose time, but oh my it's so worth it.

Good Night folks <3

-- Edit 1:

The game has recived a lot of free updates past release (in addition to a paid DLC/Expansion).
Update 16 which came out a few days ago added a full overhaul of the game for beginners by adding a nice tutorial which starts the player on the right path to automation.
It also adds missions to guide the player in his progress through the game.

I've just returned to playing the game again after several months of playing other games and I'm impressed by all the work that's been put into this game since last I played.
Still very much an enjoyable game with a very active and helpful comunity.

--

I love this game.
The dev's are very active on the forums and updates to the bleeding edge happens frequently.
And by active I mean he's actually reading and responding to threads on the forums.
Even helped me out with my mynock problems x)


Edit: After many more hours of playing I still LOVE the game.
This is my reply to a question of ""Is the game worth it?`"" asked on the forums now when I've had about 80hrs of gameplay underneath my belt:


YES!

Now let me elaborate:

I loved Minecraft, especially along with Buildcraft, Industrial Craft etc.
I also enjoyed Factorio and other similar games.

And I absolutely LOVE this game!

// Rambling start

I've played about 80hrs now and still having a blast!

The developer is really active and working hard, his plans for the future seems (in my opinion anyways) awesome and so does his attitude.
In it's current state I already do love the game. I would easily spend another 80hrs or more on this game in it's present state without any updates. 
With the updates then I expect that number to grow to insane amounts :=)

Speaking of updates, you can either play on the regular early access branch or you can opt into testing the latest freshes code. 
The latter will crash and break so you'd HAVE TO MAKE BACKUPS (DAILY!) , but you would get frequent updates and get to test everything as soon as it's coded!
Awesome!

If you'd rather want things a bit more stable then don't opt into the Bleeding edge and you will be fine. Keep in mind however that this game is under developement and it's NOT a AAA+ development team behind it, but some indie dev which means this a true early access game.
If you can't stand work in progress games, then you'd better wait untill it's more polished and done before you jump in :P

// Rambling end


TL;DR

I've spent around 80hrs and will probably spend another 80 in it's current state (without any of the updates) which means it's worth EVERY CENT I've paid for it already!

I absolutly adore this game and has tons of wonderfull ideas and features with literally constant updates. So lets get into the game. What is it? You could say its minecraft but in all honestly...it kind of isnt. It is its own unique game with tons of unique blocks and features that I would love to have in minecraft, that not even modded minecraft can offer. So lets get the good and the bad in the game listed in a nice little list. This is a little lengthy so if you dont want to read all of this and want to know the short version

SHORT Version: Its a good game lots of features and updates, little bugs, if there are it gets fixed pretty quickly, dev streams and listens to his watchers. Also they look at feedback and love to get feedback on the game.

LONG: If you want more depth here you go.

PROS:
-It is constantly updated on a daily baises. There are new features almost weekly and when they did a poll on their twitter, literallythe next day there was a solution and was implemented within a pretty short amount of time. A day or two before it was in the game.

-Bugs are quickly addressed when reported and usually will have a patch in a decent amount of time, depending on how game breaking it is of course.

-Multiple tiers that you work your way through as you go deeper into the world.
-Researching those tiers. The deeper you get the more Research points you get (RP) The more blocks and flora you scan the more you unlock.

-Replayability. Theres a lot of replayability in this game and with constant updates and a lot of features being planned it is always a new experience. (Especially if they add the planned features like space)

-ARTHER. An amazing little robot that you can dress in a top hat, eye monocle and an good looking moustache. Love it! Though hes really useful ingame with status updates and back up power if you run low.

-Much more to list that would just make this ungodly long.

-Multiple game modes that are pretty fun ranging from hardcore and rush mode one or two others that I cant think of atm.

CONS

-Not everything is implemented yet. Some stuff is in there but it hasnt been properly fleshed out. (Though this isnt in early access, it still technically is because of a lot of reasons that you need to game developers point of view to understand. (Which the dev actually explained to us in a stream in depth which gives you a big understanding of the gaming industry. Like the top games make 90% of the money. Even though fortress craft is in the top 500 for steam games they still struggle, so even though this is the con section, I highly suggest if you buy the game you buy the DLC with it to help support them))

-Things can be a little difficult to piece together, even with the handbook, so it may take a little bit of time to figure things out or do a little research (Again its being fleshed out and the handbook is still unfinished so its understable)

-Your kind of stuck in spot defending the same area. Now Im sure they have plans to change that especially when they plan to implement space, so for right now your kind of defending your castle.



Honestly Im just prying cons out of anything I can just to make this seem fair, but there really arent to many cons. If you cant launch the game then talk to the dev. They'll try to help you. Trust me, they want to help you and expand their player base. You can listen into one of their streams and their ideas and viewpoints are really nice to listen into and really put time into their game. It is a bit of a tedious game so it takes time to make things but once you get the hang of it you will surely have fun. This is truly a fantastic game and you should give it a chance. I would honestly even say that this game should be valued way more then 10-15$ for the amount of work they put in, so its a pretty good deal for a game like this.",1448568328,1448723341,True,31,0,0.674173116683959961,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A great voxel builder. Lots of interesting systems to figure out and problem solve with.

At only 30 hours in I can't speak much about the end game tower defense game.
The fact that it even exists adds spice to the early game...

The early game tower defense game is only required if you choose to
pay attention to it.  You can play hardest core where it is absolutely required
to win every battle.  Or you can play easy ignore it and let the mobs ""kill"" you
central core - which reboots in about 2 minutes and your are back
to another hours of building...

Unlike some voxel/pixel builder games, this one is about setting up a system to do the work,
not grinding through the building process yourself.
We build new structures, we explore, while we explore - the machines mine, refine, shape and build parts from the ore.

PRO: Big world, Interesting systems, Interesting tech tree
  Tech growth comes from an interesting combination of exploring and crafting.

CON: Small team, very active development (which are pros) means that
community resources like wiki's stuggle to keep up.
While there is in-game help, you can only find out about topics as
you run into them, and the explanations are not complete.  
If you like to plan ahead you will need to scour forum posts
and the guide seciton. The FAQ in the guide section is essential to understanding
some key concepts.  Other steam forum posts contain key tidbits.

The lack of documentation combined with all the things you can get the
system to do make for a steep learning curve (at 36 hours I am just getting
out of the ""early"" game.)  But puzzling out how to get what you want to happen
with all the games systems is a LOT of fun.  You have to work for your tech
upgrades, but they are all the more enjoyable that way.",1448406039,1448406039,True,6,0,0.544946193695068359,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Try and argue with the developer is like arguing with a brick wall.  

Problem 1: Play style and lvl a simple difcuality level is needed.
Peaceful - Those who just want to do the manufacturing part of the game and make stuff.
Easy - Some monster shows up on rarity.  Start setting up defences etc form here.
Medium - Diffcualtiy as normal 
Hard - Go for it and make it a little tougher enemy etc.
Hard Core - If you die, you game is erase but your highest stats will be listed.


Problem 2 - Generators does not work below 300.  I really don't care but like to generators to work at all levels.  

Problem 3 - You spend more time mining and collecting resources then building an actual base.  Its already complicated as it is.  You don't need to add more problems on top of problems. 

Problem 4 - changes are soo annoying that when they do changes it makes the game worst then what it is.
  - Examples
  - Generators don't work below 300.  I have an entire system setup for that and now I have to go back and fix it.  I barely have enough materials to make a power laser to get that far down let alone finding a way back down.  
  - Monsters spawns soo much that all your ore is gone before you get it up.  Plus going back to make all those changes is a pain.  Even Minecraft changes is better then this.
  - Force to use high speed tubes vs oonveyors,  It means hours of replacement again mining speed of the ore is slow going even after upgrades.  
  - 8-1 ore - yea millions of ore and on turns into 20 k or so.  With so much needed to build, who needs ore monsters.

In addition, read the forms and you can see all the crappy changes they keep making.  Yea, its there game; but, who is paying for it???  Us of course.",1448235126,1448235126,False,5,0,0.440290749073028564,23,True,False,False,False,,,

Игра индивидуальна и уникальна. Система добычи руд и исследования мира тому подтверждение.

Плюсы:

+ Автоматизация всех процессов, вы не копатель, а руководитель исследователь.
+ Изучение  новых типов крафта.
+ Защита базы от мобов, жаль ни разу не снесли мне базу
+ Джетпак

Минусы:

- Супер сложная ориентация в пространстве (нет карты или я просто не нашел как ее делать)
- Отсутствие различных биомов ( разработчики пишут, что биомы появятся)
- Однотипные враги, весьма тупые.
- Джетпак на далеких стадиях развития
- нет Русского языка ( базового английского вполне)

 Alright... where to start? Well, I suppose I should start off by saying I can tell this game takes inspiration from ""industrial""-themed Minecraft mods, in that you're setting up production chains and transporting items and mining and all that stuff. The problem is it's only taken inspiration, and pretty much fails in every other regard.

[b]The good:[/b]
 Fortresscraft is initially simple and you might have fun for the first hour, but the fun soon stops as the game becomes a parade of [i]annoyances[/i], either due to bad game design, intentional grinding, and a slew of other bullcrap that keeps you from that carrot on a stick; progression.

[b]The bad:[/b]
 Now, you may be wondering, ""Higgs, what's so annoying and bad about the game? Look at all the positive reviews!"" To that I say; everyone is stupid except me, and you... if you listen to my gripes about this game.

 Starting off, the graphics. Now, I might be playing this on an ancient GTX630 graphics card, but that's still no excuse for a game with these sorts of graphics to not be hitting 60FPS, at the very least on low settings. The models are simple and bland, they look like they're out of a PS2 game (a bargain-bin one at that), and the blocky terrain clashes with this. The textures are muddy, dull and needlessly high-res, and have parallax for the most mundane things. The developer seems to have slapped on as many special rendering effects on top of the game to cover up the mediocrity of the art style, to the point that it can be difficult to see when some of the bloom effects or screen overlays do their best to blind you. As a result, the game tends to chug despite the low poly-count.

The gameplay itself is, to a point, what you'd expect from a Minecraft ripoff. Break and place blocks. Simple enough, if the UIs weren't a goddamn nightmare to navigate. Every single screen seems to run on a different set of rules, and despite what might seem like a solid framerate your clicking and dragging will be laggy as hell. The focus of the game, the machines, are obnoxiously unexplained; even with the in-game help it either seemed to gloss over the function or rules of things lioke hoppers, which never EVER behaved in the way you wanted them to. I'd be fine with that if I could mine by hand, but you CAN'T. Ore blocks aren't supposed to be broken apparently, and yield junk when you turn your laser onto them. You have to place a grinder thing beside an ore vein, then wait for it to chew through it sluggishly. It's obnoxious and it just doesn't make sense. Even breaking normal blocks manages to be awkward and clunky, they break far too fast and the range for the laser is too far, making digging stairwells a chore when you accidentally dig at more or less than a 45* angle, meaning you have to dig out the ceiling or place blocks to make the stairs smooth again. With the way blocks break in Minecraft, you have far better control over what you're digging, to the point that I find mining to actually be one of the more enjoyable activities even after at least 5 years of playing the game, Fortresscraft's awkwardness just vomits all over that sense of zen that I get. 

 It's worth mentioning again that almost nothing is actually given context in the game. Despite dismantling a tree with my laser I can't make planks to make a crate to store all this garbage in my inventory. What do all these over-detailed glowing plants do? Slimes everywehere? Are they bad guys? Sometimes when I'm underground a block decides it hates me and kills me (dying has no consequences outside of respawning, yet another annoyance). Are THOSE bad guys? How do I fight them? I had to go down to -150 meters to find lithium ore, yet the device that beams power underground requires that I already have piles of lithium? Why do I have to nrun back and forth between my power station because there's little option for providing power to underground drills? How many times am I going to get HYPOTHERMIA?

 Also, no pickaxes in the game apart from the logo. That really miffs me for some reason, maybe because I can't mine myself and the machines are frustrating to deal with. Placing conveyor belts is an exasperating chore; they never go the way you want them to the first time, and you'll often need to dig a hole to stand in to get at the right angle to place them up a wall (that doesn't even make SENSE).

[b]The ugly, ugly, UGLY:[/b]
 Did I mention this game is ugly? Holy hell is it ugly. Again, I have to reitterate that the flat, blocky terrain clashes with the semi-detailed models; Minecraft might be ugly too but at least it's a consistent sort of ugly. Every texture is far more detailed than it needs to be, to the point that it looks less like a texture and more like a grey blob at every distance apart from directly in front of your eyes, in which case it's got so much detail it looks almost uncanny valley in a way. The lighting SUCKS, it hurts my eyes. I hate looking at this game.

 In conclusion, if you really, absolutely must play a voxel-based mining game with machines, buy Minecraft and install Technic launcher, there's dozens of well-made and POLISHED mods for you to play, with far more content and without the graphics drain and constant frustrations.",1447643592,1447643592,False,8,1,0.485634833574295044,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The depth of the game is the same as the horizontal size; the FortressCraft world is approximately 1,000 light years in all dimensions.

Biggest. World. Ever.""

1,000 LIGHT YEARS ACROSS!?!

Wayyyyyy biiggeerr than Minecraft!!!

You can build any size world in ""Create"" that your imagination or your time will allow!!!



2nd, in ""Create"" you can build ANY type of block that you want or could ever imagine!!!

Minecraft, not so many, that's why there are so many people making MOD's to improve on the ""bland"" gameplay.



3rd, the game is SO cheap compared to Minecraft!

Right now it's on sale for about $10-$13 with ALL the 'Bells and Whistles'!!!


4th, the developers and designers ""talk"" to you faster via discussion, email, etc. than the Minecraft staff.


In conclusion, IF you want to play a game where you can do MORE than Minecraft, then buy and play FortressCreaft Evolved!!

I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who likes building, creating, using their brain in artistic ways, etc., to buy and play this game!

I Have played the heck out of this game and even tho it has had it's share of bugs and issues over the years I still supported it. 

The dev announced he was no longer going to be updating the game anymore and that he was doing one last update. Which would have been fine he continued to update and add to the game for years even tho not many people was buying the game and it was no longer in alpha. I get needing to move on and dont have a problem with that.

The problem is before his final update the game was fine, it may have had some minor bugs and what not but overall the game was playable. Now spider bot which is a robot that helps you defend you factory in this game has always had an issue with his legs going kind of weird, which was not an issue with game play but a visual thing only. The final update had a fix for his legs to make them not get weird or turn backwards and what not. Problem is this update broke spider bot to the point he is not even usable. He will just fly up in the air and do nothing. 

Instead of the dev just putting spider bot back to the way he was before the update he just walked away and left him broken. Some will say you dont need him to play the game. While this may be true to some point, lots of things do revolve around him and he is a big part of the game, for something that is nothing as some would say it's funny you can buy dlc's that reskin him. So you can spend money on something thats in game but broken and you will not see because he flies high into the sky and does not help at all. 

Sorry for a developer to just make a change that breaks his game then walks away after breaking the game is just wrong and really sad. It goes to show what he thought of all the people that did support him and buy lame dlc's just so he would get extra money.

It has a great concept and hopefully continues to evolve over the next few years as the developer hopes!

The sad thing here though is that 'out-dated' negative reviews are killing this games progress as reviews do not expire as a game evolves.
I think the review system on Steam is flawed in that respect as it does not retire reviews after a certain period of time, especially if the devs fix the issues, instead if a game has a rocky launch(as this did) it is forever doomed with that mark on its name, even if the dev fixes the issues.
Looking at the negative reviews a lot of the negative reviews are from a long time ago before fixes etc and some things claimed by some users are no longer valid.

That aside,
Gameplay wise, this is a voxel technology/research game.
You need to build systems to power your base, and research new technology to progress.

If you enjoy tech mods in minecraft, this is definately worth a look.
In my opinion it is very generously prices.. I have paid a LOT more for games I have played a lot less off.

The game just left Early Access, but it's far from being done. I mean that in a good way: The devs are committed to adding features as long as they can afford to.

Your job in this game is to build a massive industrial complex to save yourself and escape the hostile planet you've crashed on. If you find yourself doing something tedious, there's probably a machine you can use to do it for you instead.

Pros:
[list]
[*]Zillions of machines to automate your base
[*]Fun tower defense aspect can be ignored if you don't like it
[*]World size is basically unlimited. Dig as deep as you can!
[*]Good graphics
[*]Multiplayer
[*]Creative mode allows construction of amazing things

Cons:
[list]
[*]Documentation is mediocre. (Used to be poor, so it's improving.) Best source of info is the Steam forum, which is disorganized because it's a forum.
[*]There are some rough spots in scaling your industrial output. There are no machines to gracefully handle thousands of resources. (But they're working on it.)
[*]Not much plot or story; if that's what you're looking for, it's not here.

This game doesn't allow you to travel to other planets like Empyrion, it doesnt allow you to travel to the nether like minecraft and it doesnt have mobs chasing you the whole time..... This game is an INDUSTRIAL oriented game, being an engineer makes it even more fun as I plan my production plan for a certain resource. You have questions like how many extractors I need?, how many conveyer belts per resource? should I create a line of robot arms to selectively pick my ores or should I seperate the belts? What  will my production be with one smelter....how about two...how about a hundred? What would the energy requirement be? Can I fullfill it or should I tech up?....and the list just goes on....

Bottom line this game is huge, with thousands of mega projects that you can endorse that can keep you entertained for hundreds of hours.......(note: I just reset my account and I play offline quite often).

Auch ist der Entwickler im Forum sehr aktiv und man kann dort Feedback hinterlassen oder auch direkt neue Vorschläge unterbreiten. 

Zum Spiel selbst. Nach einer Bruchlandung startet man auf einem zufallsgenerierten Planeten. Im Winter. Ein kurzes Tutorial macht einen mit grundlegenden Konzepten und Funktionen vertraut, beispielsweise wie man verhindert, dass man erfriert und an neue Technologien kommt. Ziel ist es einen automatisiertes Bergwerk zu errichten und darüber nach Wunsch eine Festung um sich gegen angreifende Rieseneinsekten verteidigen zu können. Außerdem gilt es einen großen Energietransmitter zu bauen, der Energie an einer Orbitalstation transferiert, was meines Wissens momentan als Sieg gewertet wird. Ich habe das noch nicht umgesetzt, weil ich trotz hunderten Stunden Spielzeit, einfach noch nicht dazugekommen bin. Zum einen kann man sich eigene Spielziele setzen und die Tiefen ergründen (was zunehmend schwieriger wird), zum anderen ist es sehr reizvoll, effiziente Energienetze und komplexe Transport- und Lagersysteme zu errichten. Gerade in diesen Bereichen gab es auch viele Verbesserungen seit den ersten Early Access  Versionen und es ist schon ein tolles Gefühl, wenn alles summt und brummt und funktioniert, wie vorgesehen. :)  Dies in Verbinung in mit einer rudimentären Produktion und u.a. auch als Versorgung für den momentan ebenfalls nocht recht rudimentären Tower-Defense-Aspekt, machen das Spiel meiner Meinung nach ziemlich einzigartig, Auch wenn es mit einen Megapack an Mods und Totalconversions für Minecraft vielleicht auch möglich sein mag, etwas in diese Richtung zu gehen, ist es doch schon ein Unterschied zu einem Spiel das maßgeblich dafür entwickelt wurde.

I have been playing this game on and of since I got it over a year ago, and the following is my thoughts on the game and it's development since then. Pls.forgive spelling :)

When I first got the game I saw great potential in this game, I mean.. SPACE, Building, Tower defence, and combat... how could I go wrong. Well I will till you this, my first opinion was a negative review, the game was a resource hog, there wasn't much to do, was able to beat the game to my satisfaction in just one sitting on the weekend (-8 hours). But hey, it was EA and as such I do not give bad reviews to EA games that are still being worked on, because you never know right? However if I had, I would have given the game a 3/10.

Over the year I have been part of the ""Bleeding Edge"" bate patch group. AKA the, ""this game is now broken"" patch where new stuff was tested. there were several hickups when patches were relised, however all you had to do was report the issue and 9/10 the problem was fixed with a new patch in just a few hours. NICE JOB DEV'S. main patches we constent 1-3 days apart, except when RL issues delayed the Dev. However being a one person team sometimes this happens. It was not uncommon to even have several main patches a day if the DEV was on a roll. So is the Dev dedicated to this game??? I would have to say he is more dedicated then 99.9% of the Devs out there. Just for that point alone the game then became a 6/10.

What's my opinion now that the game is out of EA???  Well I have to be honest, the game isn't done to my hopes and dreams that the potential first showed. but I need not worry because the Dev still plans on putting in just as many hours a week now as he has in the past so MUCH more stuff to come. the game is still a bit of a resource hog on top settings, just when you take in consideration when I fist started the game I was on the lowest settings and getting lag, I can now play abouve recomended with little no no lag... 1000% improvment Many items, and tings to do have been added taking an 8 hour game well past 150 hours (depending on your play style) the dificulty with the added features have made a game that I use to play on hard settings into a game I need to play on below normal (still learning the new stuff). 

I have been typing to long now so I will give you my ""out of EA"" rating. I would love to give this game a 9/10 but due to some bugs and glitches still active I can only give it an 8/10. losing one point for the glitches (all games have them even ""finished"" games) and losing one just because you can always improve the game right? BTW 8/10 is the highest rating I have ever given a game... so that alone is a ""WAY TO GO DEV""",1447132784,1447132784,True,92,6,0.766806304454803467,0,False,False,False,False,,,

""Is it finished?
No. 

Part of the reason for leaving Early Access is the massive change in the Steam landscape since we entered Early Access. 
Touted as a place to put unfinished games and get feedback from the community, many games haven't lived up to this expectation, with broken games, abandoned games and 'oh we aren't making enough money to finish it, it's done now!' games. You know who you are ;)"" 


On the contrary, you are doing it because noone buying your crappy game which placed your game as ""New"" courtesy of Steam's milk maid method of earning money.

Edit 1/26/19:

Saw that the game was out of EA after not playin it for a few years, decided to load it up and see if anything had improved from the buggy, albeit entertaining beta. Turns out yes, a lot had changed!

Best change by far: YOU CAN SUPERBUILD CONVEYORS INTELLIGENTLY.

Spiderbot had buggered off which was a nice change from him stalking me thru my spaghetti base. It appears to be locked behind research now. ...except when its not? Sometimes I'd see it wandering around off in the distance on invisible terrain or floating in the air.

It appears there's some blocks that the circular room-builder-thingie cannot break which is nifty, but very poorly explained: Reinforced blocks. They're made from Construction Paste. As are Chevron Blocks. But some of these Chevron Blocks are categorized as garbage, plucked from your inventory by the Garbage Theif, and clog up the machine that converts garbage into Paste.

Inventory management is still abysmally horrendous. Yes, a few sort buttons have been added. But they dont really help much. AZ, Type, or something else I didn't use. You have about 100 inventory slots to work with and they quickly fill up with random stuff. Be it bars, ore(which only stacks to 150 btw), gears, wires, plates, ruined bug parts, unruined bug parts, dedicated fabrication machines... Minecraft-style trees have been removed. Crates to store this random crap require wood, which confused the hell out of me because I couldn't find any trees. Then I shot everything on the surface and the problem fixed itself. Wood was acquired. The crates still suck. 2x slots per block, stack of 100 per slot or something. Shift-click into crates was added while I was still playing initially. But there is no shift-click to pull stuff from the crates to your inventory? ...Really?

The Surface... Minecraft has biomes. You can find different things in different biomes. The colorization is logical. 
FC:E appears to have gone on an acid trip since I last played. Seriously. You might be in an orange snowfield, or a green desert. Who knows. I certainly don't. The only real way to figure it out is to mine a block. There is no rhyme or reason to the colors and dear god they're an eyesore. 

ARTHER or whatever is still annoying. Constantly telling me to go deeper and ping unknown to find a fuel source. For hours. Before and after I'd scanned Biomass. And researched the correct whatever. and unlocked the Jet Turbine. Seriously bot, shut up. But at least I can stash its upgrades in the suit menu. Oh yeah the suit menu actually works now! One can cram all their suit gear over there! 

Machine behavior is completely inconsistant. Many of the new dedicated crafting machines that were added are modeled with conveyor belts on them. One would think that one could feed the items it needs then, with a conveyor belt. ...One would be incorrect in some scenarios. Some can be fed via belts, but many require hoppers as their neighbors. One would also think that if it has conveyors on it then it'd only output in one direction. This is also inconsistant.

I've encountered more than one item with unimplimented in-game help data. This was bog standard a few years ago but I'd think a game touting itself as 'finished' would be, well, finished. Then I saw this gem: ""Future Machine - use this to improve the Clean rating of your room, required to hit Clean Room designation. Clean room has no current effect."" So... is it? Isn't it? Which is it?

Found a fun, potentially game-breaking bug with the room system where if you place a block that the game doesn't think belongs there in the room, the rest of the worlds textures will stay unloaded when you leave the room. 

WHY IS /DETAIL BOOM STILL A TYPED COMMAND. WHY DOES IT STILL NOT REMEMBER SETTINGS WHEN YOU RESTART THE GAME. WHY IS THE BLOOM STILL SO DAMN BLINDING.

-
After another 30 hours or so additional play time to see if the game had improved substantially, I'd say it really hasn't. It still has potential, just like it had back when I wandered off to Factorio. The difference between the two though? POLISH. And a third dimension, but thats beside the point.

I say mining-ish because your resources are 99% dug out of the ground, but this isn't just a dig and build kind of game. You need power to live, you get power through different means. One of these means that takes it away from just mining are things like solar energy and the ability to store the electricity in batteries. If you like a sandboc voxel game and the idea of building a self-sustaining operation this game is for you. There is also a creative mode, but I can't speak much on this because that is simply not my general area of interest. The early game has a very good push to make you want to expand and evolve. The energy requirement to keep you alive feels very real when the game starts and after about 30 minutes of keeping yourself alive I most certainly experienced the wanting to keep myself alive with less direct input and the only solution to this was building things to sustain themselves. I would say I have done about 50% of what can/could be accopmlished in an average scope of the game (not a 100% copmletionist have to get every achievement kind of view). One way I like to way games is how many good hours a got per dollar. Currently I have 65 hours and I believe I bought it at $10 (USD). That's 6.5 hours per dollar which is far above my threshold of a game that should be considered bad if you play it less than 1 hour per dollar. I definitely got hooked on this game and stayed up late hours wanting to keep playing.  

One of the best things I can say for this game is the small development team. The developer is ALL OVER THE FORUM. The developer always wants more feedback and seems to spend all day speaking to players and improving the game. It gets updated constantly and has a well thought out road map of what is next.  

I would say invest now. Get your money's worth and enjoy I great new take on a voxel game. 

Also, I forgot it is moddable and the community will help with that.

Where to start? This is a really well thought out, high quality game that encourages players to take advantage of its in-depth building system to achieve levels of creativity not found in other craft games. 

Mixing exploration with creativity, the game world modes cater for just about any gamer. Survival mode is possibly the most interesting, feeling fresh and challenging to just about any gamer. Survival mode gives a subtle drive to the creative player, besides creating visually stunning environments.

Other modes offer a more relaxed experience, with vareity to suit the player. All modes are customizable in terms of difficulty and resources, in order to create the most suitable game world for the player.

Though in terms of fun, multiplayer is where it's at. Co-op mode is a blast and working alongside your buddies to create and delve is great. 

Visually the game blows most other craft games out of the water. The textures have a hand made, consistent quality not often seen in games today, and compliment the models considerably. The sheer level of effort put into the visuals is very noticable, and the torch light in underground areas is pretty cool, gives a real sense of exploration.

The sound effects are great and the music is decent, complimenting gameplay. Listening to the ambient wintery wind howl as you dig and search for resources in survival mode is pretty awesome. Gives a real sense of being in the game.

Best thing though? The deep building system. You can do all kinds of cool stuff like powering generators with coal or materials for equipment energy, check out objects to find their hidden secrets with your laser scanner, craft new gear with materials you find along the way. It has to be seen to be believed really.

Sadly the game has had some slating in the past owing to early beta releases, though in comparison the game has gone leaps and bounds miles away from what it came from (and I hope past reviewers amend their posts.) and exceeded my expectations.

Overall, the game is a great choice for craft game fans and players who want to dip their feet into the world of creative games. Highly recommended.

Honestly it makes more sense to use T to Toggle the hopper settings, instead of Throwing selected item on toolbelt into it. Would be Consistent to have a UI for the hoppers, see exactly whats in it, then you could pull specific things from it.

1a. When I finally started tossing iron in, I would have to press Q repeatedly to get everything out of the smelter feed hopper. Then drop the iron in, and if I dropped in anything else, it would randomly select what to make next. So I'd have 1 iron bar, and then a bunch of copper and tin. Although, it's indicative of not random, but a LIFO type system. Last In First Out. Since copper and tin were already automated to that hopper.... So in order to get JUST iron out, I'd have to rotate a belt, empty the hopper, put the iron ore in, wait for the iron ore to finish processing, then rotate the belt back, and drop stuff in again. 

2. Mobs pathing through solid objects. Got a nice recording of a slime inside my CPH and also inside the crafting machine. Can't shoot it there.

2a. Kinda got lucky on my base placement, although at the same token, unlucky. It's been a while since I've started a world and had my base nestled at the foot of a mountain on one side. Because the last time that happened, I had to DIG OUT a mountain side, because the green balls of wasp vomit? poop? were flying out of the mountain side at my CPH. Once I dug out enough, I found 2 wasps just chilling inside the mountain, shooting at my CPH. Like solid walls? who cares! we don't have the programming to respect solids. With the slime just willy nilly oozing into and out of my CPH, I'm going to have to assume that nothing else respects solid surfaces either. Arther sure as hell doesnt. 

3. No display showing how much charge arther has. At least he's no longer holding a digital sandwich board, cracking jokes, but it's impossible to figure out how much charge he has now, except with a charging station I'm told. (UPDATE - I heard the charge display for arther was implemented, but since the whole game is still basically in early access as far as what was promised by the developer and what was ultimately delivered...)  It's nice that his text now shows up over your toolbelt, but the sound is a bit obnoxious. Reminds me of an old NES game, where when the characters talk, it would make little blip noises with each character... like Zelda. 

4. Arther upgrades still reside in your inventory, and same with suit upgrades I'm assuming, since pressing S in the inventory screen opens a screen for suit upgrades that looks clearly incomplete. I made Arther's power core, why the heck does it live in my inventory? Why doesn't it go to it's own area? IIRC, you can take arther's power core out of your inventory and put it into a storage box. As long as you pick it up before you log out, and it's in your inventory when you launch the game, Arther counts it as having it. 

5. Still wish there was a compass. The holobase does seem much better somehow, and there's these red arrows in it, no idea what those are about. (UPDATE - I've heard rumors that the dev actually added in a compass! But not before the dev added in a bunch of stuff that will murder you instantly if you get too far away from your base.)

6. Logistics Hoppers, the white ones, although they still didn't spit things out as fast as a Large storage hopper, you could use them to empty a mining drill and send the contents onto a belt. Now they are slower some how. The point of the logistics hopper was to get the ore out of the drill and into transport. Now there's no choice but to stick a storage hopper on them. Which also seem slower in their dispersing speed. 

7. New Issue. The automation machines, the stamper, the extruder, the coiler, and PCB maker, used to just zip right along. Since they updated the recipe for laboratory pods, to use 1 PCB per three plates, for a total of 2 PCB to 6 plates for each lab pod... I would build a belt turntable, put a hopper on top of it, stick conveyers on each of the outputs, 3 sides leading to a stamper, 1 leading to the extruder, coiler, PCB maker, have the belts meet at the bottom and move up into a second hopper at the same level as the first one, so you could waste less resources and make lab packs... The whole build occupies slightly more space than the New and improved Behemoth of a CPH. But seeing as the speed of those automation machines is excruciatingly slow now, it causes a backlog, throwing the ratio's off. That's when I decided I'd had enough FCE for a while. 

The early game of FCE is Excruciatingly slow. Now with the improvements to the speed of the automation machines, it's going to be EVEN SLOWER... 

What FCE feels like to me: Solitary Confinement. 
When I shut the game down, I don't feel like I'm leaving FCE, I feel like I'm escaping.

I'm really happy I got two copies at such a cheap price, but to be honest, unless it goes F2P, I'd leave this alone and spend your allowance on a game that was made by a developer that cares more about giving you a quality game, rather than how much money they get for making it. 

I will delete comments on this review at my discretion. I'm tired of being harassed by FortressCraft Promoters for expressing my opinion. I'd like to lock it so no further comments can be made. But apparently I don't get that option. So if you love FortressCraft Evolved, write your own review and stay off of mine.

If you were unfortunate, and you actually bought this... tragic waste of a concept, Do yourself a favor. Find the game in your steam library, right click on it, go to properties, find the tab that says 'betas' select veryoldsurvival- from that dropdown, and have a blast in the earliest alpha version. It crashes sometimes mere moments after launching it, or at some point during your modifying of the game environment, but I'll say this. It's still more fun to play that way than the living color hell it eventually turned into. And for those that are looking for a peaceful survival mode? It'll qualify.",1446600326,1568478318,False,198,18,0.738403618335723877,5,True,False,False,False,,,

I am a veteran of Minecraft, FTB, MITE and various other custom maps and challenges particularly in survival mode. FCE is similar, but different, to all of these and is centered around your base. You get most of the tools you need from the beginning, and from there it is up to you to build your base around the ore you find, and to automate it. Automation is really cool - you can do things the hard way, yourself, or build a conveyer belt and laser power and it does it all for you! You can just stand there and watch it go, and I often do! After a while you will have to deal with mobs too, so base defences come into play. There is a tech-tree for you to discover which unlocks a lot more of the game, and the ""limits"" are not what you are used to - there is no bedrock, you can just keep going and going. Super-dig and build-to-me features are ""wow"" as is the x-ray vision mode, grappling hook and jetpack.

You might think that after all those hours I have done everything there is to do in this game. Well, I have played out a few worlds but no, I still have plenty of things I want to try.

Even though there is Witcher III and Fallout 4 (coming), I'm already calling this my ""game of the year"". Stick with it and you will find it great fun. Sure, it is still in ""early access"" but this is already better than a lot of fully released games. What are you waiting for? get it now!

You start at your home base, with nothing. (As standard.) You wander around, dig stuff up, look for stuff with your scanner. Go back to base. Check out what you've found, discover a few new things to build.
Dig up more stuff, build more stuff, research more stuff. That's the basics.
You can sculpt vast areas, build huge supply chains to feed the machines you build, build bigger machines, set up defenses against the evil natives. 

And the more you do, the more you are thinking, ' Just need to do that, then I can do this, and that let's me do that, and then.....' and so it goes. This is a damn big game, and very addictive. Like I said, a lot of games in this genre, but this is the ace in the pack.

I played it since early stages and seen it evolve and I can say that devs are really working hard to make this game aversome.

What i feel playing only survival mode that it's Minecraft on steroids. You get building gun that has VERY long range, infinite world with no bottom and TONS of things to craft. And its not simply digging a few blocks and just making them into some items. You need to use machines to mine ore and coal, power it up and get ore to smelter to get bars for stuff to make. You need to research new machines and tools, and some research proyect requie several machines setup and TONS of power and metal to get.

But the best thing about this game is building automation. You can set up a mine, connect to storage, to engine, load with coal and just come back for ore later. Or you can connect conveyor belts and your ore is transported to smelter, power mine from some sorts of power that is supplied by coal from other mines and your mine will work by itself until it runs out of ore. You can sort your materials, set up complicated structures and watch how its nicely work by itself.

AND IT IS NOT A MINECRAFT CLONE! (If you think its a clone, go ahead, play it, form your own opinion)

Detailled review:
I have played the game in very different stages in its development. It changed vastly, and IMHO it is ALOT better!
Since I moved to bleeding_edge updates there is an update at least once a week.
That is a very nice update paste and its very calming to my mind, that if I find a bug its fixed rather quickly.

Now to the features:
Machines, machines and even bigger machines. Automation is a key feature in this game. From time to time some mob waves attack you, which can be fought with LASER turrets! I mean, LASER TURRETS!

Is there Multiplayer?
- Yes there is and its fun!

Is there more content coming?
- Yes, alot is planned, but it obvisously takes time to implement and test properly.

Do I recommend the game?
- Yes, I fully embrace you to buy this game and play it! It really is fun to play!

Before I proceed, I have a suggestion; Do the following:

[b]Step 1.)[/b] On the Store page for this game, where it tells you whether the reviews are Positive, Mixed, or Negative, click on that (It says mixed for me right now, but there's no telling what it says for you).

[b]Step 2.)[/b] You should see a Heading that says ""Helpful customer reviews"".  Observe the filter.  I suggest you click on ""Negative"".

[b]Step 3.)[/b] Read a few of the negative reviews.  I read about 6 of them and noticed a trend.  See if you notice something as well.

[b]Step 4.)[/b]  Now, keeping everything you've read in mind, go back to the main store page and scroll down until you find the link on the right that says ""View Update History"".  Compare the content of all those negative comments with what you see now on the update history.

Now we may proceed.

Did you notice a pattern?  A trend?  My observation was that it appears that the bulk of the negative comments on this game consist of individuals who do not comprehend the meaning of ""Early Access"".  I say this because, before writing this, I did those above steps.  I read what they had to say, and compared it to what the game is now, as of this writing.

I found all of their arguments invalid, because they failed to understand that what they were playing was a work in progress.  Their complaints are/were all worded in such a way as if they were reviewing a finished product.

All too often, we see detractors whine and complain saying that ""Early Access"" is an ""excuse"" for their poor quality.  I suggest that people who make this argument are either trolling, or lack the intelligence to comprehend what it is they are saying.

The entire purpose of Early Access is to allow the community to support and be involved in the direction and development of the game.  If you expect a game to simply spring forth, fully developed with all features intact and no bugs to speak of, then you aren't looking for an early access game at all, but an ordinary full release product like any other of an endless list of games elsewhere.  You cannot influence a game that is already finished. 

This game was very rudimentry when it was first made available to the public.  Some basic block placement and a creative mode.  That was IT.  Early reviews claimed it was a ""Minecraft Knock-off"" and ""Boring"".  This is why I asked you to read through all the negative reviews.  Because if those people were to say those things about the game now,  any reasonable person would wonder if those people were even playing the same game.  Remember this when someone says that saying ""Early Access is a cheap excuse"".  Because those people obviously lack the reasoning to understand how this system works.

There are few games on Steam that I have seen with the level of developer interaction and update frequency observed on this game.  Look at the discussion threads.  You will find that the developers actually engage in conversation with, and consider the input of the players.   That interaction is the POINT of early access.  We as players get to influence how the end-product turns out.  You can't do that with a finished game (barring MODs of course).

I have no way of knowing what your experience with survival sandbox games consist of, but if you're reading this review, there's a strong chance that you are not new to it.  If you are new to it, then you are fortunate to arrive on the scene when you have.  The genre has evolved quickly, and it is continuing to do so.

This game is still early access as I write this, and that's why I wanted you to follow the steps above before reading what I have to say.  I hope that ultimately, if you do decide to purchase this game regardless of it's state of development, that you will be pleased with the outcome. 

I myself enjoy this game.  I have watched as new features are added, changed and removed, tweaked, or radically altered.  Ultimately, only you can decide if you like it or not.  But I hope that you'll be able to make a more informed decision whether you want to invest in it's development.  Or if it's done by the time you've read this, only you can decide
if it's worth your money.

My humble opinion is that it is/will be.   

[h1]Here's why (took me long enough didn't it?) :[/h1]

FortressCraft Evolved takes the basic block-based voxel genre and adds automation, tech trees to research, and ever increasing risks and rewards for exploration.  Furthermore (depending on the difficulty setting) you'll find complacency to be ill advised.  There are threats looming on the horizon and you [b]can[/b] lose.

Some of the more rewarding technologies require exloration into hard to reach areas, requiring you to upgrade your survival suit in order to acquire them.  Some of these areas require an investment in infrastructure and defenses.  Whether you are playing single or multiplayer, you'll find the whole thing challenging and rewarding.

Again, this is just my experience having played the game from very early development until Early Access 1.20. 

I have no regrets.",1442775989,1455093226,True,256,16,0.785030126571655273,13,True,False,False,False,,,

You'll certainly feel the grind early on, as you work to gather resources. Getting to know the controls is a must; mining ores using only the automatic things is slow, so make sure to read through the controls to get to know all the stuff you can do to save time (Superdig is invaluable). I never really got to any of the advanced machinery, as the grind just got a tad boring. Also, the creative mode's fun, I guess. All the block textures are highly situational, which is my main gripe with the game. Other than that, it's a fine game.

I'd recommend this game to anybody with some time to burn (this game is great for passing time; one moment it'll be 8PM and the next it's 2AM) and a bit of money to spare. It's nothing outstanding, but it is certainly the sort of game you can use as a filler between games.

EDIT: After some of the more recent updates, I've found that the game can be a fair bit more fun. I found the combat (while flawed in some areas, like the lack of a crosshair and the charged shot doing nothing more than the regular shot) to be rather fun.

Also, after messing around in creative (I was exclusively playing survival to this point) I found that the detail blocks have been MASSIVELY improved since Chapter 1. The ability to have the block textures as either scaled or not is a brilliant addition, because that was one of my main issues with the original. The detail blocks can actually be used for seamless detailing, which is brilliant.

It certainly is an improvement on Chapter 1 in near enough every way, and (in some ways) is better than Minecraft for building larger creations. With the addition of texture pack support, I should hopefully be able to customise the game to the way I would like, which is a brilliant feature.

Overall, I'm changing my rating from ""time waster"" to ""generally good game"". It's a good game in pretty much all aspects (if a little buggy at times. I'm looking at you, spiderbot on hills.

My initial impression of the game wasn't great, which was largely thanks to the greatest difference between stable and beta branches in a game I've ever seen.   Once I opted into the beta, and selected some easier difficulty options, I found a game that was somewhat similar to some of the tech mods for minecraft, but with far more depth and coherence.   But this game, unlike minecraft, or most other mining games for that matter, requires you to build infrastructure that mines and processes for you, rather than you mining yourself.   The early mining process requires you to locate a sutible ore vein, plop down a ore extracter on it, stick a storage hopper on it, and dump a bunch of power into it, and leave it for about 10 minuites before coming back, recharging it, and taking the ore to refine.
However, every step of that process is automatable, from the very start of the game.   Progression gives you faster, more efficient ways to mine, and automate the mining devices, while encouraging you to dig deeper to get access to more valuable ores, to research and build more advanced and effective machines.

Pros
-Advancing tech keeps you building and modifying structures
-Tower defense aspect adds mid and end game goals
-Scanning and visual tools lets you quickly plan out the most efficent way to set up and debug structures
-All the information needed to progress can be found in game, no immersion breaking forum trips needed
-Large difficulty range
-Multiplayer (Still buggy, will likely be improving with time)
-EXPLOSIVES that you can make as powerful as you have power for (maybe not so great in multiplayer)

Cons
-Not much in the way of a wiki to look up information for optimizing setups, particularly base defense
-Single threaded- hard to run unless your computer has relatively good single thread performance (I have an AMD 3.7 GHz processor, and I have to run it on a lower graphics setting to avoid framerate drops)
-Mob difficulty tends to get grouped- if you want things to fight back, you also have to deal with ore eating mobs that spawn on your conveyers.
-Falling too fast kills you, makes it somewhat hard to go down mineshafts, you have to spend a fair amount of time building and navigating stairwells or platforms
-Some dead spots while waiting for materials to be mined or refined",1441909963,1441909963,True,11,0,0,2,True,False,True,False,,,

Research and automation are the core progression of this game. As this game is in early access, it does need some polishing and bug squashing.

So far (15hrs), I've found 2 bugs: A minor issue where I had to re-open a UI (such as an inventory screen) to get my cursor to work instead of mouse-look, and an issue in multiplayer where other players could not see my placed blocks. The multiplayer issue was annoying, but the devs are actively working on addessing multiplayer bugs in newer builds.

FortressCraft appears to be built on Mono, instead of the resource heavy Java that Minecraft used. This means it runs in 64-bit, can be multiplatform, and runs very, very smoothly.

Yes this is an early access title and yes EA can have bugs. That's not what i'm talking about.

The overall concept of the game is great.

The balancing and core ideas of the game are great too. It's very clever above all how the progression in survival works and forces you to preserve materials on every corner even after a couple of hours.

But just about every core feature that's in the game feels irky / buggy to work with:

[b]The bad[/b]

- Right click accidentally with your building gun on any machine and it will deconstruct Losing ressources that were in it and generally being a nuisance.

- The whole interface is very problematic, disappearing cursor, unintuitive controls, buttons that dont work as they should. Nothing gamebreaking, you eventually learn how to work around them. Inconsistent use overall. (Some things require ""e"" to charge them, some need to be opened first for instance...) Annoying nevertheless.

- The Energy and Transport system are cool but very annoying to work with. Moving a line one block lower because you misjudged something and built it a bit off, good luck with that, will cost you a shitton of ressources and a blob of interconnecting logisticshoppers.

- Energytransfer. We have lasers that transfer power over 64 blocks but no cables that distribute power to something 2 blocks away. Instead you have to kinda misuse batteries to connect things. I suspect it's because of the 1 block 1thing development philosophy that this game went for. In the early days of Industrialcraft over at Minecraft they used cables that measured 1 x 1meter... not a perfect solution but at least you had something to work with. If there is anything in the techtree then it's way to far down. (Solar panels before basic cables ? Really ?)

- The energy grid is very simplistic and lacks complexity once you see through it. It's just batteries / machines that have energy, or they dont now distribute evenly with limited tools.

- Combat... should have left it out, it just looks really bad and unfinished and doesnt add anything to the game.

- Once you have a bigger base you need some sort of navigating tools so you can dig straight tunnels to where you need them because the game is seriously annoying if you have to build 2-3 blocks to connect things. The game has a holomap for that and a map that is very confusing to use and needs alot of time to get used to. Simple coordinates on the scanner would have solved this problem entirely, but no, we have a bloated graphics effect.

- Death doesnt mean anything. It just ports you back with ALL ressources. Take the survival aspect out of it if death is meaningless.

- Unnecessary robots flying around in your face, and the spiderbot. Have fun with the spiderbot, it doesnt do anything except block your view in your base day in and day out.

- The Scanner doesnt work proper. While the scanner is cool if you scroll the mousewheel once up or down you see that the thing is buggy. Pretty much sums up how such an easy spottable bug got past the Dev or that he didn't care about it.

- Graphics are somewhat dated. Not a huge thing.

- The name... has nothing to do with fortresses, should have named it Factorycraft or something.

- Multiplayer is very buggy. The dev is not capable of reproducing alot of the reported issues. We could reproduce them on every single client in the first try. Well... yeah.



[b]Whats cool:[/b]

- Ore distribution is really cool and works better than in minecraft as it forces you to branch out the base naturally and think of ways to make things easier.

- The Scanner is cool.

- Energysystem of your suit forces you to be carefull about your ressources.

- Progression is really smart and fun. You can't just step away 10 hours and then have a shitton of ressources, the limited automated storages make sure of that.



[b]All in all[/b]

Have someone that does quality control and treat this as a conceptual prototype.

Es wird nicht mehr weiterentwickelt aber noch gepflegt.  Es wurde im wesentlichen von einem Entwickler mit viel Leidenschaft programmiert. Und ich muss sagen es hat eine bessere Qualität als viele bekanntere Titel. 

FortressCraft ist schwierig zu beschreiben. Am ehesten ist es eine Fabrikationssimulation wie Factorio, aber mit unterschiedlichen Gameplay Ebenen. Bei Factorio wird das Gameplay je mehr man erforscht hat einfach immer aufwändiger aber das Spielprinzip bleibt das Gleiche.
Bei Fortresscraft kann sich das Gameplay im Verlauf des Spiels verändern. Auch gibt es ganz unterschiedliche und interessant gemachte Gefahren mit denen man unterschiedlich umgehen muss.

Es spielt in einer Minecraft-ähnlichen Welt und das Hauptziel ist eine automatisierte Industrie aufzubauen, die es erlaubt sich auf dem fremden Planeten wohnlich einzurichten. Wobei mehr der Weg dazu das Ziel sein wird. Einfach gesagt ist es eine Art Kombination von Space Engineers und Minecraft und ist aber trotzdem anders, so dass es auf keinen FAll eine Kopie ist.

Der Einstieg ist nicht ganz einfach (ich gebe unten ein paar Tipps), aber wenn man es ein bisschen verstanden hat, dann kann es richtig süchtig machen. Es kann ziemlich aufwendig werden und viel ""Arbeit"" kosten. Damit man sich das Leben vereinfachen kann, muss man forschen und neue Maschinen freischalten.

Um was geht es überhaupt: Erze finden, Energie erzeugen, Energie an die Abbaustellen bringen, Erz abbauen, Fliessband (oder andere Möglichkeiten) zum Schmelzofen transportieren. Zu Beginn ist die Basis an der Oberfläche und die Herausforderung ist alles von der Oberfläche zu steuern. Dann mit den gewonnen Barren kann man Unmegen an diverse Ausrüstungen und Maschinen bauen. Vor allem aber auch sogenannte Research Pod's  mit denen man einen (unbekannten) Technologiebaum erforschen kann.

Im Vergleich zu Minecraft geht man deutlich tiefer ( Ich war bis jetzt auf - 330m) und es geht sicher 1000m tief. Man durchstösst  mehere Zonen mit verschiedenen Schwierigkeiten z,B. wird es -200 Grad kalt und hat anfangs ein Problem den eingenen Raumanzug warm zu halten.
Die Welt ist mit einigen Lebewesen und Pflanzen bevölkert. Die man auch looten kann und z.T. zum Craften benötigt. Es gibt diverse interessant gemachte und sehr unterschiedliche  ""Monster."" Ein Typ frisst das Erz, das man rauftransportieren möchte.


Ich kann es aber voll empfehlen! Ich finde viele Reviews hier zu streng, wahrscheinlich weil es mit dem alten Fortresscraft verglichen wurde.

Noch ein paar Tipps:
- Jeder Block muss mit dem Scanner (Taste M) zuerst gepingt dann gescannt werden. Dann beim Reseach Center erforschen. Dies gibt wertvolle Research Punkte. Mann muss immer tiefer gehen, um neue unbekannte Blöche zu finden und Punkte zu sammeln.
- Wie gesagt die Anfangsstation kann man zu Beginn nicht verändern. 
- Das Fliessband kann für den Transport auch vertikal in die Höhe ( mit R Richtung rotieren)
- In der Regel kommt zu Beginn und am Ende ein Storage Hopper
- Energie kann mit Laser transportiert werden. Hier kommt am Ende immer ein Energie Storage Block (weiss den Namen nicht so genau)
- Verwirrend ist der Bau der der höherwertigen Research Pod's. Diese braucht man im Laboratory (zuerst bauen) Die baut man nicht  mit dem Manufacturer sondern mit einem Research Pod Assembler (zuerst bauen).

Came back to this after about a year as we're all locked in at home and I fancied sinking a couple of dozen hours into a new world and generally seeing what had changed. This game has somehow managed to get worse, even less noob friendly,  and appears even further from finished than the last time I played it.

Also you appear to need to have already automated your base in order to build the stuff to automate your base, right from the get go. I remember when rolling a new world was fun because it gave you an excuse to actually explore before everything turned into tedious running back and forth along km long lines of conveyors, now it's straight in with the conveyors. First person factorio, but far less fun and will probably never actually be finished.


Original:
Great game, with great potential, and frequent updates from the devs. Most recent update has made it for more noob-friendly. Not a finished product but still a great way to waste several days of your life, there's nothing like snaking kilometers of conveyors through caverns taller than the depth-limit on minecraft, all so you can sit back and watch your machines dutifully smelt exotic ores while you sit back and have a cup of tea.",1440678919,1587817992,False,0,0,0.501234054565429688,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Sure, it's still rough around the edges and has still many (non game-breaking) little bugs, but the developer is very active and patching and updating the game constantly so that you can solve little problems in as short as a few days span.

Now about the game:

- Minecraft inspired (blocky world and such)
- Story driven: you crash on a planet with your ship and only have some basic stuff to survive and your final goal is to find a way to go back out there where you came from
- Creative mode too (with much more stuff than survival mode)
- Most of the game is about setting up a mining operation and get the necessary resources/ores to finally build the stuff you need to leave the planet (game end)
- Mobs / Tower defence mode has been introduced: so while building/exploring the alien planet you also need to fight and/or setup defences depending on how much you get noticed by the local aliens
- There are ""Hive Minds""! O_o
- If you like crafting and building automated stuff this is the game for you!
- This is mainly a single player game IMO but they put in a multiplayer mode too (I don't use it) which is a bit awkward to setup, but they're still improving it

So basically my tip is to go buy it!
If you're not convinced by now then just wait for the next sale and grab it, IMO you won't regret it.

I was abit unsure as I have burnt out playing modded minecraft over the years with my son (Aye, I'm a mature gamer). This game is not like minecraft, it takes abit of getting used too when you first start out. It took a few resets and a couple of videos to figure things out.

I started off on Normal difficulty instead of easy and you really need to work to keep everything going at the start. The game keeps you busy as there is always something to do but even when things start getting automated you still find yourself running around like a loon on the next project.

I love building up my automation really slowly and planning thing out, this game allows you to do that.. even tho I am a real life automation engineer :D

I reckon if you are an older or experienced Minecraft/Technic player you will love this too.

Right now it is in early access and as such there is a variety of things to be sorted but I have watched and dabbled in this over the years and its always been interesting. The Devs keep well on top of this game as well and there is no doubt they are serious about crafting a work of intricate design. 

The biggest draw right now, as an early access title, is the machinery. It is one of the focal points of the game and you can craft a variety of machines to do much of the mining, crafting and distribution of materials so you can research, mine and craft even more powerful machinery that takes increasing power to run meaning you will need to upgrade your power network to keep up with the demand of an ever growing base of machines. I like machines.

There are still issues with the U.I. and there are gameplay mechanics not yet implimented but the Devs are attentive to their community and listen to suggestions. This is one early access title thats gonna go the distance.

needless to say the game is fun and adicting. it is right up my ally and i really wish this was a total conversion mod for minecraft... but it is not, and i don't really care.

for the most part the temerature mechanic is broken. it is not very realistic, and i can't see temps going from 100 degrees celcious to -5. granted it is not unlikely, as a fire in the dead of winter kinda works that way, but you can still feel the heat from a few feet way. then with enclosed spaces, especially underground that heat retains and continues. so if you have a heat source you undergound it should heat better than out in the open, i don't see this happening. it seems that the code does not diferenciate between materials and how enclosed something is. i built a building heated it, and the differance of temperatures was not really that great from when it was not enclosed.

searching forums would be great and dandy but the information is not always current like i said he moves things around changes where they go which means an old topic could tell you to research something entirely different and researching in the lab isnt an easy thing that takes a little power and a few moments.

I highly recommend this game!

Despite that, playing it is kind of soothing. I mostly play games like terraria, FTL and minecraft. I make a new review so that I can point out the positive pieces.

Energy system, ores, ingots, intermediate building materials such as PCB:s, copper plates...

It is a bit difficult to move far away from your home base since the power quickly drains. Besides that, I say it's a challenge. So far, I haven't got to the point where I think this game has ""everything"". The most bothersome challenge is moving far away from the home base and finding the resources that you need. Canalizing coal into the main hub is one of the most usual things that you will do in the beginning. This is done by hand (taking coal from a mining block into your infinite inventory space, then staying at the base until it has enough power).

I imagine that a larger operation would take a lot of time. I sporadically play games with or without liking them, so I would usually not recommend this game because ""bitterness"". But I got into it a bit more by watching someone making a let's play on it. For example, the tutorial in the beginning was added with the latest patch. Before that, I had to watch the let's play in order to know what to do. Mostly, games like minecraft gain introduction level experience by being simple. As complexity adds to the time that you spend fumbling around, these ""cellular automata"" games almost require an intro course.

I have no idea how to get the complexity that the game promotes by its videos. As usual, the actual gameplay is similar to any minecraft-like game. As usual, there is some difficulty getting to the point where you feel you've achieved something. Things like putting coal in the main hub will predate the point where you've found your first source of copper.

Tips:
X <--- changes to block breaker
M <--- changes to block scanner/pinger
L  <--- turns on lights (drains energy)
The scanner is necessary to find the first piece of copper deep below ground.

Right now, candles are extremely cheap (infinite power!) and craves coal which you get cheap in the beginning (most of the times)

What about the game? Well its minecraft style construction and world building but that's where the comparison ends. You extract ores to creat ingots to create new machines to support your lazy butt because the name of this game is automation. There's been more than once where I just sat back and let my machines work to produce some ingots i needed or research modules.

Het is altijd even zoeken om een game juist te beschrijven. Fortresscraft situeert zich alvast bij games zoals minecraft. Dat had iedereen waarschijnlijk wel al door.

Je crasht op een desolate planeet en je krijgt een mini basis en een korte tutorial om wat mechanics uit te leggen.

Om te beginnen draait alles in fortresscraft rond stroomvoorziening. Je hebt een pak aan dat je tegen de elementen beschermt en valt dat zonder stroom dan sterf je traag aan onderkoeling. Hoe erg sterven is, dat kies je bij de start van het spel, maar ik raad zeer sterk aan om de eenvoudigste setting te kiezen, dan kom je met al je stuff een eindje van de startbasis terug tot leven en mag je dus beginnen lopen.

Fortresscraft speelt zich in hoofdzaak in de diepte af. Momenteel zijn er dieptes tot voorbij -1000, veel meer dan in andere games dus. Graven gaat iets vlotter dan in Minecraft maar ook in deze game voelt deze diept als aanzienlijk aan. Er zijn een aantal grote resource types. Je hebt stenen om mee te bouwen, ertsen als basisgrondstof voor de meeste machines, crystallen en organic rock (te vinden in grotten) en dan brandstof voor je energie productie, zoals coal en andere.

Het hele punt van fortresscraft is om de ertsaders, die gigantisch kunnen zijn, automatisch aan te boren, de erts automatisch te verwerken en dan automatisch naar een centraal punt te brengen, zodat jij ze kan gebruiken om mee te craften. (Ook dit kan geautomiseerd worden indien gewenst.) Dit kan met transportbanden, afvoerpijpen, liften en futuristische 'treintjes'. Een punt daarbij is dat je wel ook stroom naar je machine moet krijgen, daarvoor maak je gebruik van de batterijen en lasers, stroom produceren ondergronds is moeilijk. 

Er zijn momenteel 2 mobs in het spel die je lastig vallen. 
Je basis wordt na verloop van tijd aangevallen door wespen in een soort tower defence game. Met waves die steeds moeilijker worden, afhankelijk van je energieproductie en een aantal andere productieparameters. De wespen afslachten geeft je kans op nuttige resources. Weet je de waves niet af te slaan, dan wordt je startbasis vernietigd en moet die zichzelf weer herstellen, of is het game-over afhankelijk van de instellingen. Daarnaast zal je end-game ook de 4 broedplaatsen kunnen vernietigen van deze aanvallers, maar dan moet je basis wel verdedigd blijven, terwijl jij een gigantische laser oplaadt.

Een tweede mob is de hivemind. Een parasiet die mynocks spawned op jouw transportbanden (eens je lager dan -40 gaat) die dan alle resources die passeren stelen. Die resources worden dan gebruikt om een beschermende coccon te maken, die blijft groeien en enkel met een 'nuke' is te vernielen. Deze hiveminds leven als kankers over de hele map. De mynocks kunnen met automatische turretten van je transportbanden worden geschoten. Daarvoor heb je natuurlijk weer stroom nodig. Naar het einde toe zal je de coccon ook kunnen/moeten harvesten voor resources en dat kost natuurlijk bakken stroom. 

Voor de rest loopt er wel wat rond in de wereld, maar dat doet je meestal niets. Al zijn er nog beesten die je stroom komen leegzuigen. De wereld staat ook vol planten, maar die zijn van minder belang.

Het spel heeft een heleboel elementen die je in minecraft niet terug vindt en die een enorme meerwaarde zijn voor zo'n spel. Je bouwt dus echt een gigantische installatie uit om resources boven te halen en je basis te beschermen en verder uit te bouwen.
Het spel mist echter ook een aantal dingen die je wel in minecraft terug vindt. De paarden en de konijnen buiten beschouwing gelaten. :-) Logic/redstone is er niet echt en pvp multiplayer staat niet op de planning, samenwerken is wel mogelijk maar een echte competitie is er dus niet. Het spel uitspelen kan trouwens lang duren en de easy setting is al moeilijk genoeg tenzij je geen leven hebt, met hoe meer mensen je samen speelt, hoe rapper de progressie zal zijn, early game buiten beschouwing gelaten.

De single player heeft een heel pak te bieden. Voor de huidige prijs zit er echt veel fun in. Het spel is vrij uniek en heeft wel wat weg van 3D factorio wat uitdaging en gameplay betreft.

De uitbreidingen brengen meer en betere technologieën en een nieuwe uitdaging die zich onder de grond afspeelt, het is dus min of meer de bedoeling om het spel uit te spelen en dan je productie infrastructuur te gebruiken om de uitdagingen van frozen factory verder aan te gaan, al kan het starten met frozen factory en het vernielen van het laatste wespennest wat overlappen.",1438266564,1560947297,True,13,1,0.656311988830566406,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Strong Recommend
Gameplay hours: at least 20+
Beta version updates happening weekly or better - very active
Devs active online and taking feedback, adjusting bleeding edge beta almost daily

For now, it is a mining game: you'll have the most fun if you enjoy building an industrial town/machine and gradually automate your mining operation.

Depending on how much you like to tinker, there is at least 20+ hours to get to current endgame (quarry), but that can easily extend as you learn to use the various components to achieve certain things you thought couldn't be done. A lot of the core fun is to figure out a way out of these challenges.

[u]THIS IS NOT MINECRAFT[/u]. It does sure look like it by fast looking on screendumps. But its not and in a good way. Let me try to explain what this game is all about.

You start by crashlanding on a planet. You got a limited supply to just keep you alive for a short time. So the first thing you do is searching for coal so you can power up your battery machine. Because nights gives no solar power. And you need to have your machine running to survive the cold. The suit drains energy in the cold as well so keep your battery loaded. 

You will unlock upgrades for the suit to make life easier but you need those ores and some are deep underground so you have to search for them. Gladly there is a mining tool so you can search for them, but keep in mind it drains alot of power from your suit. And it does not state clearly what it have found, so you have to explore the world.

At the time writing this, there is no real enemies in the game. The dev is still working on this. To be honest i dont miss them. Because i have fun just trying to survive the cold and build the best self working factory. Today there is 2 gamemodes Survival and Creative.

So what is the good and bad parts?

[b]Good:[/b]
-> Explore a massive world for ores, strange habbitants, plants. Research to unlock new tools and features for your factory or suit.

-> Researching unknown blocks is thrilling because you dont know what you have found before you have researched it. You can research block and plants to unlock new stuff to create in the world.  For example: Conveyor lines to your ores. New machines to operate your drills. New suit upgrades to make life easier. 

-> This game has stolen my life. Cant get enough exploring and trying to survive from the cold. The feeling when you have a working self sustained conveyor lines deep down is such is a nice feeling.


[b]Bad:[/b]
-> Learning curve is a bit high for new players to get into to the game. Thank god for youtube videos ;)

-> There is some ingame parts still not functional for example the upgrades you make for your robot and character should not take any inventory space. Cant understand why it must be inventory and not in a separate character window.

-> When using grappling hook you can sometimes get stuck in walls. (To get out, just use grappling again or just cut yourself out of the block)

-> You can only use grappling hook upwards and not to get down. I know this is game is about exploring and making tunnels but sometimes it would be so much easier to use it to get further down in a big cave. 

-> If you click on mining machine if already making for example iron bars with another ore it deletes that ore you are having in hand. Its a bug that needs attention.

-> Still havent got multiplayer in survival to work. There is no working serverlist so you have to send your ip and port to your friend to play the game. And sadly this has not been working for me. Co-op is where i think this game will shine even more.

-> Still early access after 2 years. Updates is comming but progress is going slow.

[b]End words:[/b]
Wish there was experience to gain for everything you do in the world. Because there is so much so you can do. I recommend this game to all who enjoys making a functional factory for surviving.

It's called, ""Factory Town"".  It's not first person, but you research for the things you need, build houses and buildings you need, gather resources, and they have cloth conveyors and metal conveyors.  If you really want to play a game worthy of having that automation with no distractions, then look it up sometime, it's A LOT better than this game that is for sure!!!  AND the DEV actually LISTENS to YOUR input and ideas!!

UPDATE for this review: Too many things have changed that I no longer play this game.  Not only was it the mobs, but it was also not being able to use generators where we wanted to.  You can have a generator in a game to provide power, but lasers were unfortunately more favored over generators for some reason.  One day, a game will come out, that will be a factory game, no mobs, and no BS, and that is the game I am looking for.  Full automation with no interruptions.

In the end, no I do not recommend this game.  

I have edited this review to show that I was 50/50 on my review, as a full recommendation for the game.  Now, I am 100% dead set, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

2019 Final Verdict: FACTORY TOWN.  It is on Steam, and it is definitely worth giving a look.  I have 103 hours of play time in.  It's one heck of an awesome game.  AND NO MOBS!!!

And the developer gives you a T O N of options.  Creative, infinite market consumption, you can set the size of the game world, even to infinite if you want, plus more options that I'm not even remembering because it's so many.  And that is the one problem we had with this game, lack of options, the developer of this game wouldn't even compromise or listen to feedback and ideas.  But the changes were so drastic that we felt it was no longer worth giving our time or money to.  That was the reason and still will be the reason I can never, ever recommend this game to anyone.

MORE PROOF THAT THE DEVELOPER OF FACTORY TOWN LISTENS TO WHAT WE SAY!!!  This guy has got to be one of THE most honest, and ""I give a darn"" devs I've run into thus far on Steam.  100 times better than the dev for this so-called game.

Edit du 21/03/2016
Le problème des raccourcis clavier étant réglé, j'ai relancé le jeu, et il faut avouer que je change d'opinion concernant ce jeu. Je le recommande désormais aux accrocs du genre, et à eux uniquement. 

C'est un jeu de gestion/crafting intéressant, mais sans grand challenge malgré tout. On ne peut que progresser, seul l'environnement est hostile, et la mort est non punitive dans le mode survival, car on réapparait avec tout son inventaire.

Le début de partie est assez fastidieux, avec ses nombreux aller retours pour faire des actions qu'on automatisera bien plus tard.

Mais, au final, on s'y amuse, et il est assez gratifiant de voir une chaine fonctionner comme sur des roulettes après avoir galéré à tout mettre en place. Avec de l'huile de coude, on automatise ses actions en enfonçant de plus en plus profondément nos machines. Je pense que je n'ai fait qu'éffleurer le jeu en plus avec mes 25 heures de /played.

Reste que comme Factorio, on s'extasie devant un système complexe qu'on a réussi à dompter (enfin à crafter, plus qu'à dompter, car c'est assez simple à comprendre) mais qui reste particulièrement vilain pour l'oeil. Ca pique un peu la rétine tout ça.

This game has changed alot since I last gave it a negative review, and please excuse me developer for comparing this title to minecraft as it's a voxel based game with ""craft"" in the title.

The game seems to have been updated heavily since my last review; by adding a tutorial and making the game much easier to get into.

I really enjoy this game (i only play on survival) and it's a verry good spin on the many voxel block games out there first off it's not focused on being creative as in making big castles etc ( i guess you could but there are other games that are better at this) Where this game shines is in optimizing your base you're building a huge factory/mining operation and everything needs to be powered by different means which makes it a little of a puzzle game in my opinion.

people have commented on the fact that the tier 1 takes too long and it's too hard to get to tier 2. I have to say i love starting over and beginning from scratch I actually do so after every bigger update (even though it's usually not even necessary).

other people have commented that the development is too slow or non existent and although it may seem like this the last few months if those same people would follow the twitter they would see what the devs are really working on and at this point that is mobs and battle this is not a small task so the smaller quick updates may be gone for a while untill this is done.

I'm not saying this game is perfect yet (far from it ) but isn't that what the early acces warning is for.
Too many people ragg on the early acces games giving negative reviews for things that are bugged etc that comes with the territory. People pay money for something and expect it to be a fully functioning completed product even though there is a big blue warning saying EARLY ACCES.

I also think the developers show great transparancy, through detailed patch notes and the ability from the player side to choose what build you want to run, as in you can choose to run the stable version, beta version or bleeding edge if you want to be up to date with the newest of the new developments.

This game looks and seems like it could have a lot of potential but in the current state that it is in I cannot and will not recommend this game. There is pretty much little to no content that really keeps it worth while in the current state. I played 1.2 hours of this in survival mode and pretty much just gave up on it because, for one the content that is in survival mode is little to none other then just ore automation and two once you get it all up and running there is nothing to use your precious ores that you have collected and you just feel like you have wasted time. The upgrades in the game are all still in development so you cant really upgrade anything either so you don't really win at all.

One huge mistake is they went upon development backwards in my opinion! They started the game out as multiplayer and did single player as a add on when they should have focused upon single player which would provide more things to do. Without a good single player core how do you expect to have a good multiplayer? It doesn't really make sense at all to me at least... Which makes me kind of sad cause this game looks like it has a lot of potential but in the current form I really just cant say too much good about it.

Please Dev's don't give up on this game because of all the hate! Just keep working at it :) If the game gets to a more playable and enjoyable state I will change this review! What we need is more things to craft,upgrade, and just simply do more then building a red and blue house with our buddies.

Review : ""You should not have released this feature until it was 100% bug-free""

YOU shouldn't have bought an Early Access game. ¬.¬""

---

FortressCraft could have been a really great game, but I cannot recommend it in good faith. I say ""could have been"" because development has all but stopped, even though it's still in Early Access. There are currently game-breaking bugs, such as segment loading/saving errors that result in lost items/constructions, invisible walls, unloaded blocks, etc. Sometimes half the world just doesn't load and everything you've built gets deleted. 

[b]What is FortressCraft Evolved?[/b]
There are two modes: Creative and Survival. Creative is the same as any other generic Minecraft clone. Survival is a bit more interesting, and it's where I spent most of my hours in-game. The premise of the Survival mode is a mix between Factorio and Minecraft, where your mission is to basically collect resources and build infrastructure with the end goal of...automating the collection of resources to let you build more stuff. There are ""plans"" to include enemies/combat to give a bit more of a challenge for players who don't just want to mine. Right now exploration isn't that fun. It's a fairly bleak surface world with repetitive caverns below.

[b]Why Should I NOT Buy This Game?[/b]
[list]
[*]Game-breaking bugs
[*]Lack of updates from dev team
[*]Poorly thought out game elements (e.g. The math behind power delivery is completely broken. When you connect batteries, they do not share power instantly, it ""leaks out"" over time. Even with fully upgraded lasers, which transfer power from object to object, it's impossible to fully power the most advanced types of objects currently in game, such as MatterMovers)*
[*]Fairly boring/lack of content after first few hours (Granted, that would be fine for any Early Access title, but [b]this game has been in Early Access for YEARS now and has completely stalled[/b])
[/list]

*Note: Some of these issues have been fixed by a third-party mod, called LazyMod. [i]Yes, a player made fixes to the game that the developer wouldn't/couldn't.[/i] The game Developer then asked the mod author on a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/254200/discussions/0/618456760260038741/?insideModal=1]Steam forum[/url] how he was able to manage these things...that's a bit disheartening. 

[b]Why Should I Buy This Game?[/b]
[list]
[*]You enjoy automation/upgrading/resource collection
[*]You don't mind weird glitches, placeholder graphics, or reverting game save files
[*]You want to support an independent developer who has, in all honesty, probably lost interest in the game

Me gusta crear las maquinas que producen energía poder tener mi propia central de energía, tienes datos de la producción en tiempo real de Energía y Producción de ores/lingotes, puedes irte a 500 bloques bajo tierra y encontrar ores poner un taladro y un motor con un hopper administrándole carbón y  despues otro hopper al lado  del taladro para sacar los ores,  poner una cinta transportadora que suba todos esos ores a la superficie y que lleguen a una  maquina la Smelter que es la encargada de producir lingotes, (8 ores =1 lingote) . 

Y esta es mi humilde opinion de este juego. Si te gusta la maquinaria y los bloques y explorar este es tu juego.

The game probably should have not been released as early access in current state. Enemies were not implemented yet, instructions are far from appropriate… If you bear this in mind, you are ford of creative mode and in survival you tolerate many aspects missing, you can like it. Otherwise give it another year and return then for better game.

[h1]Detailed Section[/h1]

[b]Creative mode[/b]

I tested only few minutes to get achievements, it seemed to work, but i tis not my cup of tea so for feedback on that check other reviews.

[b]Survival mode[/b]

This was the part I bought the game for and put full day of play in. The name „Fortresscraft“ evoked in me that I will face enemies and build fortress to repel them… well, no. Enemies are not implemented yet and so this part of game does not exist.

The survival in current game is about energy - how you prevent to lose it and how you handle when you on zero not to freeze/burn/die from falling damage, nothing more and nothing less. So far I play my first play and have not died once because I am cautious (although I twice did mistake nearly costing me life).

[b]Information / Tutorial[/b]

On start you have few pages to read – and frankly, who wants to read so much text? Afterwards, although there is nice feature of research of everything, it is not used to serve information in nice small relevant packets. What a shame.
I fear that this part was heavily underestimated with regards of „early access“ – and by that discouraging many new players not able to absorb the game system.

[b]Movement[/b]

Game gives player very powerful tool – grappling hook. It seems to me that easiness of movement around is dependent on mastery of this helpful companion. It allows quick ascending, but also horizontal movement.
And for moving down there is falling… 20 blocks of fall being ok was something I had trouble with in the beginning, but then I got used to it and started to make my digging to use this as advantage.
Summary: if you will make ways minecraft way, you will spend a lot of time makong stairs where they are not needed and simple shaft-mining is more rewarding.

[b]Resources / Automation[/b]

Game has two types of resources – blocks and ores- Blocks are rapidly mined by hand. There are many types of blocks but sadly with nearly no difference – why is there hewn stone, stone and deep stone is quite a question for me (it is not even to mark depth, as for that you have your HUD. And why only hewn stone can be used as item for crafting is again very questionable.

Ores are mined through mining devices – and are probably intended for core concept of automation (so you build way to provide them with fuel or raw energy and to bring what they dug back). But that is simply not working for me and is demotivating by fact that the ore vein is depletable so what I build will stop to work sooner or later. Also smelting the ore in smelter is example of punishing mechanism – if you do not set it right and provide not enough energy, all will be wasted on failed attempt to heat it up with no real smelting in the end.

[b]Summary[/b]

Although my comments are showing mainly negative aspects of current state of the game, I believe it has potential and as it is in early access, I give it positive result. Still, there is much to do and I believe that some of core concepts will need revision, especially when enemies will be added – they can change the game to be addictive… or not.

After spending aproximately 170 hours in FC:E I feel that I am able to give a fairly accurate review of the current state of the game.

FC:E basically has two modes to play in; Creative and Survival.

[b]Creative[/b]
The game looks and feels very similar to many other voxel based games out there - notably Minecraft. However, FC:E stands out from the crowd due to the rather powerful tools that are available to the player. The various tools that you are able to use allow you to make very large and very intricate creations. Copy/Pasting sections of the world can be done very quickly and the ability to create your own blocks using the ingame workshop function allow a level of creativity that has not really been seen in such voxel games previously. I myself have not spent a huge amount of time in creative, however from the limited hours I have put in it became clear rather quick that those who enjoy the freedom of making anything they want will really benefit from these tools and this level of freedom.

[b]Survival[/b]
Here's the mode that has stolen a huge amount of my time. In basic terms the survival aspect draws many of the gameplay aspects of those in Minecraft - mining, resource management etc. but here's where FC:E does it differently. A huge focus of FC:E's survival mode is based upon automation and logistics, creating large transport, mining and power networks to build a base and gather resources.

The blocks that exist in the game all have useful functions and although can be a bit daunting at first, are quite easy to use and options for creativity open up once you get the hang of things. If you've played anything like the Feed the Beast modpacks for Minecraft or Factorio then this is the game for you.

[b]Current state of the game[/b]
As far as I am aware the engine for this game was built by the developers themselves, allowing them to tailor it to suit the needs of a game like this. It's definately not perfectly optimised, but I have certainly seen worse and the development team are constantly working to improve on this as well as fix bugs, this is to be expected in an Early Access game.

There's a decent amount of content in the game to allow you to spend quite a few hours building and creating what you want. The development cycle is quite fluid and the creators are quite active on the forums, responding to questions, asking for feedback, addressing issues etc.

Mobs and combat are the next big thing to come, which will add quite a bit in terms of gameplay as you will need to defend your base and resources.

Multiplayer in Creative is complete and as far as I'm aware pretty free of bugs. Survival Multiplayer is currently in a working condition although there are some bugs still to be ironed out, but as mentioned previously the devs are quite open and transparent about this and work on this is constant.

Overall I believe this game is a steal at it's current price. Judging from what is already in the game and what has been discussed as the future of FC:E on the forums I really think this game sets itself apart from all the Minecraft clones on the market.",1431435446,1431435446,True,23,1,0.651171207427978516,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The Devs are pretty active in the forums with the communitite and answer our questions for the most part. They also will use ideas and thoughts we have for the game if they like them and will add them to the mainstream game if it is feasable to do so.

The only down side to the game for me honestly is the lack of things to fight while playing and no defenses that work at the moment. Thought I know that will change when they get to adding these features.

Overall good game with a lot more to be added as it develops.",1431383149,1431383149,True,6,0,0.523458957672119141,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- Nice graphic @ 60 FPS...
- awesome quick build...
- only spended 2,24€ on this game...

CONS:
- ...but really slow graphic build up
- ...with absolute no tutorial at all (if it's really only the 6 text boxes, when beginning the game, then make a better tutorial, like in Minecraft)
- ...but still want my money back, because the game doesn't work at all
- crashes continuous @ 60 FPS!!!
- the controller support is terrible, why not using the mapping of the X360 Indie Game version?
- the keyboard get's turned off every 5 minutes (runs perfect on windows)
- not working achievements (follow on Twitter, Run on 64 Bit version maximum settings, only two examples)
- absolute no music or ambient at all
- multiplayer games not really easy to set up
- crashes if I end the game

CONCLUSION:
I played this game allready on Xbox 360 before and it was a great game, but here in the PC version allmost nothing works. The controller support doesn't work, you can't configure your block set, can't switch tools and many other things too. The keyboard set up works so far, but often the keyboard get's disabled for some weird reasons. If I dig down, to get on lower levels, it get's stuck at 500 blocks lower level. The graphic doesn't build up anymore and the keyboard get's disabled. Please don't tell me, it's because my PC is too weak. The game runs allways at 60 FPS, so really no lag at all. Only the graphic doesn't build up. One of my biggest issue is, that there is no playable tutorial at all. It has so many new functions in comparisson with Minecraft, that a player can't know all that. To figure it out, would be probably a very long try and error. If the heavy bugs get solved and a short tutorial get's implemented, I give it another chance. Else I declare the game as dead. -.-'
I can live with not achieveable achievements, they're a nice add to games, but not necessary. ;)
But bad controls and tons of crashes are an absolute no go. :'( (\s/)",1431357573,1431357573,False,7,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I've not yet seen everything from the new stuff so some things may be outdated.

This game is voted more negative has it should be. It's quite interesting and plays like a big Minecraft mod but without some of the normal Minecraft features.
Things that could be better:
- needs cables. Using batteries as a replacement for cables for small distances is expensive at the beginning and also quite inefficient. The laser energy transmitter are bad for diagonal stuff. There should be something like cables for medium distances.
- there are hostile creatures by now which have several issues. The hitbox is often weird and they often glitch into blocks. It's not clear what to do with the big ones like the worms and this giant thing ""overlord""(?), some kind of information system like Navi/Phi/Midna from The Legend of Zelda would be great that give some hints after trying some things out or doing a research project about them after encountering them, like ""Oh seems like they are not affected by your gun attack, maybe ...[hint towards what could help against them, I still have no idea]"".
- lack of reasons to do stuff. You are only playing to produce more ressources to build more machines to produce more ressources... (minecraft and other games are having the same issues though) [this has been a bit fixes with the attack waves but those ""calming stations"" can be used to stop attack waves completely]
-- feels like there should be more survival in there. There's only energy and temperature, build a solar station and you are fine forever. Needs food and the need to hunt creatures and build farmes. Creature breeding would be nice too, they could give ressources needed to craft stuff.
-- there could be more interesting stuff deep down. Like stronger creatures who need better weapons. Like Minecrafts nether or ender world. The ""goal"" of the game could be to get super deep to the strongest creatures and best materials, build the best equipment and fortify a base in the hostile environment. [this is kinda the case by now, there are hostile enemies and things deep down which I have not yet seen everything of]
- the weather and ground level. It's snowing all the time and snow everywhere, that's depressing. Needs some sun and grass or sand or other variation. [this has been slightly adressed by now but it's still a rocky and snowy desert]

Update due to good point from from WolfWrag:
The development seems really slow considering it's not much cheaper than Minecraft. I thought it was free or cheaper, maybe I got it cheaper due to a sale. It seems to be a side or hobby project of like one developer. I don't know how many people bought this game so it may be a bad ratio of invested time vs. earned money for the developer. Though even the full price is relatively cheap compared to normal/typical games (thought even Minecraft costs ~20€ I think). I played a lot so my ratio of playing & ""had fun time"" vs. price is still super good, especially compared to those triple A games for 70€ where you are finished and bored after like 20 or 30 hours (or even after a few minutes). So I would still recommend it for people who like Minecraft and want something different with a different focus.
Comparing it to Minecraft is also a bit harsh as Minecraft was a much bigger success, has a higher price, has/had more developers and was developed over several years until it was like today, as most people know it. I joined Minecraft in Alpha or Beta stage and that was much more buggy, unfinished and had less features as FortressCraft has now. FortressCraft could add more stuff like survival with farming, animals and maybe something like the logic stuff with Redstone in Minecraft and it would be quite comparable to Minecraft feature wise (both would have stuff that the other hasn't but the amount would be comparable).",1430790733,1468486537,True,40,1,0.733816921710968018,7,True,False,False,False,,,

Fortresscraft does not have a good GUI, has numerous bugs, a good 90% of the mechanics have no explanation, the tutorial sucks, and although with all these flaws any other game would be ill-advised, I am here to say otherwise.

What has always bothered me about games like Minecraft (which I have played for more than 1500 hours with technical modpacks), is the downward limitation of the world, 65 layers are really insufficient. In FCE the world goes downward for thousands of layers, there are huge caverns to explore and in which to expand your crafting. Developing a production line in 3d with such large distances is one of the most interesting challenges in this game. The monsters that inhabit the planet are almost a nuisance rather than a real danger but they give that extra something that Satisfactory lacks to be a worthy heir to Factorio. In FCE there is not the Minecraft technic trend in wanting to reduce the size of factories, on the contrary mass production and higher tier machinery is really huge, fortunately even on older systems, the graphics load is never extremely heavy and it is possible to build on a really large scale without losing too much performance.

The Frozen Factory expansion is then the only really interesting DLC, it adds a new biome in the depths in which cold is a really major challenge making it even more complicated.

I would recommend this game at a discount keeping in mind, however, that it never has will have further updates and that to be played fully, the Frozen Factory dlc must be used.

The game is cool,I do like building and mining. 

Survival is fine but there really is no point in building defences there is no monsters no danger like in survival Minecraft.

The constant fear of freezing to death is very annoying,make sure to bring lots of torches if you want to explore and mine,everyone says upgrade your suit but its kinda hard when ya have to find the minerals to build the stuff to upgrade your suit. Most of the minerals are very hard to find except for the basic ores or if you do find them you don't get much of them,so its hard to upgrade your suit when the ores ya need are hard to find.

The graphics are nice.

Over all the game is cool but its still in early development hopefully they fix things.

I reccomend this game but don't expect it to be a clone of Mincraft,feels unfinished.

Дальше очень много текста:

Для тех кто не знает ""сюжета"":
1) Рандомно генерируемый мир
2) В этот мир е*нулся космический корабль
3) Вы - выживший, должны сделать...что-то, и это ""что-то"" заключается в создании небольшой инфраструктуры, которое, посути, не ведет ни к чему.

Все начинается с того, что вы очнулись и нашли точку падения корабля, где находятся кратер и 5 первичных блока: мастерская (создать что-то), энэргонакопитель на 250 единиц энергии, электропечь, солнечная батарея, лаборатория, где исследуются новые элементы или создаются рецепты, и некий командный центр по совместительству с маяком (блок из которого бьет луч света).

Очутились вы в негостепреимном мире, где постоянный холод, снег и неприятно. Есесно хочется улучшить свои условия существования, а для этого нужно больше ВСЕГО, те можете сидеть около маяка и периодически из энергоблока сливать энергию, но никто не гарантирует, что в первую же ночь вы не заработаете гипотермию (веселая синева на весь экран) и не подохнете к чертям собачьим.

И тут встает насущный вопрос: Че делать то? 

А делать надо вот что:
1) Нажимаем на волшебную кнопочку ""M"" в англ раскладке и достаем волшебный же прибор, с помощью которого ,кликая на ПКМ(правая кнопка мыши), видим, что мы можем исследовать, подбегаем к подсвеченным блокам (а-ля мечта эпилептика) исследуем их, нажимая я уже на ЛКМ и удерживаем ее, направляя на эти блоки наш прицел. После чего несемся к лаборатории (синий блок около маяка) и путем нехитрых манипуляций исследуем, чего за х*йню мы отрыли и че, собсно, с ней можно сделать.
2) Плавно переходим к рабочему станку, где мы можем создать что-нибудь для облегчения жизни своей задницы, видим, что для этого нужны всевозможные материалы, основой которых служат рудные слитки.
3) Изготовить их можно из руды непереработанной, которую находим пользуясь прибором ""M"" (см. п.1).
4) С помощью комбинации Сntrl+ЛКМ (эта хрень здорово сосет энергию) добываем руду, можно и просто ЛКМ, но в таком случае шанс есть только на добычу мусора и крох руды.
5) Несем все добытое непосильным трудом в печь, которую пытаемся разогреть всеми правдами и неправдами до температуры выплавлмвания руды, забираем все что получилось...
6)...и снова несемся к станку, где пытаемя что-то изготовить.

И вот тут то и начинаются проблемы: 
1) Для исследования необходима энергия, которой есть только 250 единиц от энергонакопителя, чего ну совсем не хватает. 
2) Для увеличения кол-ва энергии можно построить рядом еще один такой накопитель.
3) Для накопителя необходимы руды : с медью (copper ore) и оловом (tin ore) проблем не возникает, тк они лежат довольно близко к поверхности, а вот с железом начинается геморрой.
4) Железо есесно находится ниже олова и меди, но вот в чем прикол: на той же глубине, где после последнего обновления появился новый блок - коренная порода, которая идет сплошным слоем.
5) Чтобы сканером ""M"" можно было высветить железо, необходимо сначало исследовать коренную породу, а на нее энергии не хватает уже в лаборатории.
Примечание: можно, конечно, просто копать огромную яму, но терпения должно быть очень ОЧЕНЬ ОООООООЧЕНЬ много.

Таким образом: чтоб создать энергонакопитель, необходимо найти железо, которое можно отыскать только после изучения коренной породы, на которую необходима энергия из энергонакопителя, который нам опять-таки надо создать, а для этого нужно уже железо...

to get first things first, the game has LOTS of room to expand.

Graphics:
good graphics, some glitches here and their, nothing game braking or making it impossible to play. lighting in caves is grate, not to bright that one light lights up everything in the cave, not to dim that 5 blocks away and you cant see anymore. however it will take more than one to find your way around in one of the large caves.

Sound:
nice sound effects, could use some tweeking. everything sounds the way it should, ie, snow sounds like snow, stone sounds like stone, metal has a nice ring to it(guess were wearing combat boots, or walking around in tap dancing shoes)
they recently added in a ankle cracking sound that makes my stumach turn every time i hear it, which is often since their are such large open area's.

Game play.
oh so much can be added here its not even funny, going to be long nights wondering what they will put in next. if your an avid explorer like me, the caves in this game will keep you busy(alittle empty atm, but that only means so much can be added, but still much area to look around, and get lost in, with your suit runing low on power). their are many of these kind of caves, so if your not getting lost in them thats your fault. I spent 4 hours looking one over(the last half hour was just getting back to where i entered the cave)

I haven't personally had any bugs or game crashes.  Game loads very quickly as well as the world generation or world loading as you move around.

At the time of writing this I'm 14 hours in and still haven't reached mid game.  I would guess even at the early access level of development there is at least 60 hours of entertainment to be found.

If you're a fan of minecraft you might like this game, if you're a fan of factorio or crafting / automating style of games you'll really enjoy it.

The only negatives at the moment I have is that there is no real threat in surivial mode death just spawns you back to your base, and mobs have not been added yet, but again, still in development and the games current status works well.  Also the progression to being able to do anything efficiently besides manual filling/unloading miners, hoppers, etc. is a little much.  I ended my last game session to finally being able to build my 2nd smelter, which is a bottle neck that limits progression more so then having a consistant progression of acomplishments.  But as i've said several times it is in beta so I'm sure as more mid game and end game things are added smelters will be more available early on.
 
Overall the game is great and quite entertaining.  $9 bucks for what I expect to be 30+ hours minimium of enjoyment is better then any cost to entertainment ratio I expect from most AAA games.

Bought this game over a year ago. Nothing has changed. I saw the devs update less and less. Then Nothing. Then almost Months later come back screaming ""where not dead!!!!."" with no updates since then or anythign else done.

Its my assumption this game is dead.

Sure, some fun things to do in creative, but i bougth this for survival. And so its unplayable. So many bugs and glitches. You dig a hole and the wall disapears or you fall forever. Dig a deep hole to mine. No simple later to climb your way back up. Just that grappling hook which is ridicously stupid since you will grab a wall and will just fall instead of holding onto the ledge to regrapple to the next higher area.

No enemies even though they sit there. You can't find any specific ore, or be able to access the ones you need.The robots or other tech to help you gather the resources don't work and create a really big irritant. 

I spent majority of my time running between sites trying to repower them so they could work a little more.

Then you die by freezing to death. Go underground Freeze. Search for deposits, Freeze. Lose your energy, Freeze. No way to locate your base? Freeze. Repower yourself and end up burning yourself Alive.

Speaking of which, No compass or way to find your base again! Yes the map is small (which is another issue), but you can't find your base, because everyhting looks the same.

The map is small and you can't find any materials you need. I kept digging and digging, not a single material i needed (Lithium) *cough* *cough* could be found.

I thougth this game would feature defend you minning base or somthing cause aliens will attack. Nope....

And oh yes the UI.... Looks like a kid in HS made it. I mean its bad. Majoirty of the items in your inventory don't have images. Half the items don't work. and when would I make more than one item at a time? unless I'm in creative mode where I'm just messing around.

You need to mine to collect ores. But it isn't just ""Punch tree, get wood"". You need to loacate your crashed spacecraft. You need to fend off againts enimies. You need to stay warm, to prevent hypothermia. You need to cool down, so that you don't get heat stroke. No matter what it is, the game can prove to have difficulty. You can't simply afk and let all of your ores melt, you have to sit in just a precise place, so that you don't overheat, or freeze.
     But, it's not all hard. The game also serves with a small robotic friend(Who needs power, go figure) that helps you out. He doesn't do much, but he can keep your suit powered, so that you can maintain your heat levels. You can explore giant underground tunnels and caves, with boundless possibilities! You could simply enjoy walking around on the surface of the planet.

Hate using MC as the reference, as it seems almost every vox type game gets compared to it....but, unfortunately popularity & timing made it the ""benchmark"", and in my opinion, this game will well surpass that mark in unique playability. Love the fact that it's not overly easy to ""run away"" with production like some of the MC mods....you know, the ones that you play 3 hours and you no longer have to do anything except design a new house....the exploration & mining remains a requirement. I love laying out mines & methodizing my gathering/processing lines....Not much of a ""builder"" fanatic, I stick to industrial style buildings, so my typical asthetic is: square, gray, door, mine, the end....so can't really comment on the building aspect.
 Already polished for the stage it is in, going to enjoy watching it grow....at the time of this writing, dev released another primer for the next update, so no worries about the ""dev mysteriously disappeared after selling X amount of unfinished product"" as I've bought into many times prior, I'm pretty sure they're here to see it through.

But I gave it a second chance, this time more open hearted. The game is playable and fun, you get to mine, use the resources, build machines, and expand. You just need a guide to do so. The interfaces? Very counter-intuitive and inconsistant. Overall the game is rather well done, has room for improvement, uses a great concept I'd love to see more of in gaming (automation of resource refinement), but just has some painfully rough edges. If the developer(s?) would devote one long, productive day solely to interface enhancement and a bit of easier to understand starter stuff, then the game would feel a lot better.

具体的にはやはり他の人と同様に劣化IC2と劣化BC

劣化点は以下の通り
・マインクラフトとしての劣化点
直下堀をすると凍え死ぬ。
それを避けようと松明で暖を取ると松明で焼け死ぬ事がある。
ある程度地下に行くと無駄に怖い空洞音がずーっと鳴りっぱなし。
雪が全てを貫通してある程度の深さまで入ってくる。
スタート地点が雪原だと、World設定で常に昼にしようとずーっと雪が降り続けずーっと曇り。
歩いてるとなにも無いところでぴょんぴょんジャンプしたりする。
クリエイティブモードでクラフトできない。
　　　〃　　　　　インベントリ開けない。
　　　〃　　　　　エネルギー供給できない。
　　　〃　　　　　設置できるブロックが中途半端。
　　　〃　　　　は体験版以下。
　　　〃　　　　はメテオモード。（天候操作などが出来る杖でメテオを落とすだけ
鉱石は一回リサーチしないと不明状態で使えない。
クラフティングボックスに相当するブロックの製作難度が高く最初は作れない。そのくせ作って置いたら壊せない。
同様に竈の難度も高く、尚且つエネルギー消費が酷いため何度もエネルギーを補給する必要がある。
竈で精錬するとき、一個のインゴットを作るのに消費する鉱石数が8個と多い。
梯子が作れない。（フックはある
基本ビルディングツールで穴を掘ったりするわけだが鉱石はHP制なのか壊せない。（さらにツールだと100%鉱石が採れるわけでは無い
設置型のドリルで壊すことになるわけだが、鉱石のHPはくっついてる同じ鉱石ブロック全てで一つのHPになるためHPをゼロにするということはくっついてる全ての鉱石を取りつくすと言うことで非常に時間が掛かる。（LV3の16倍速パーツでも鉱石全体の大きさに左右されるため30分以上掛かる
自分のHPに相当するエネルギーの回復手段が乏しく、エネルギーが切れかかったら(序盤は)ベースに戻らないといけない
オートセーブ機能無し。セーブ機能も無し。セーブは終了時のみ行われるのでエラーで落ちるとセーブされない。長時間やってエラーを起こすと全てパァになってしまう。


・IC2とBC面の劣化点
製作難度が異常に高い。
大抵のモノがインゴットを10個以上要求するため、10個必要なら80個集めなくてはいけない。
ドリルにエネルギーを補給しに行く手間が常にかかるのがきつい。
リチウムが見つからないと詰む。
木箱の容量は少ないのでスズ鉱石で作る箱を使おうとすると無駄に資材を食う事になる。要するにゴミ。
同様の理由からこのスズ箱に入れる装置もゴミ。更に言えばこの装置、運搬速度が遅くてやってられない。
スズ箱に入れた鉱石は専用の装置を使うか壊すかでしか取り出せないという不便すぎるモノで利便性皆無。
事実上ストレージホッパーだけでなんとかなる。
ベース装置は石炭を燃やすことで追加のエネルギーを確保できるわけだが、ストレージっぽいところに入れようとしても入れられない。
リフトを作れるが、8マスしか上がらない。
リフトを横向きに設置しても上に上がる。
リフトに乗ったままリフトを壊すとバグる。
全ての装置のエネルギー消費が多すぎて大変。
竈一つ稼働させるとつきっきりでやらないといけなくなる。
熱発電装置のようなモノがあるが、前述の凍え死ぬ問題で序盤は取りに行けない。

こんなところだろうか。まだ色々問題点があった気がするが、キリがないのにでこの辺で。

・微妙な点
ビルディングツールはかなり遠くまで届くので設置などをするときは便利だが、ずれると面倒なことになる。
グロウスティックを無限に投げられる。が、凍死は普通に起こる。
ヘッドライト標準装備だが、エネルギーを消費する。
Arthurという自立ロボットが補佐をしてくれるらしく、アップグレードパーツを作ると予備エネルギータンクとして使える。だが、予備エネルギータンク以上の役には立たない。

・本家より良い点
その場で作れる松明等のアイテムは0になっても材料があれば勝手に消費して置き続けられる。
恐らく本家より動作は軽い。地形の呼び出しもユニークで、バーチャルな気分にさせられる。


ゲームバランスが非常に悪い出来で、もう少しゲームバランスが良ければ楽しめたんだろうと思った。
現状は不自由なマインクラフトというところ。
最近の更新がないということはもう期待しない方が良いだろう。

- At patch 7 or 8 game start to be good, and i tought its near to be finished.
- Now (patch 14) is game still in development. Author and eveloper still add more and more content, more buyable datadiscs, more machines, but core game is same same shitty as is was year before. Bugs still are everywhere, more than half of all machines havo no GUI and is dificult to operate them. missing icons, descriptions, ets..

This game already have content for 300+ hours of playtime. It DO NOT NEED more content, it need some funcking polishing!!
I returned to the game with patch 14 and in first 15 minutes of playing I found about 10 bugs.. No thanks.

So this game could be good, i like it, but bugs bugs buuuuugs everywhere and it doesn't change..

EDIT 12.5.2019
Its still feels like an early access, still full of bugs..

After defeating the original game it get's so much more in depth it's amazing

Basically with conveyors & matter movers just being better i don't understand the real point of them.

It seriously needs a blueprint system or something like it to create a planned already built system and you can just make it with the required materials.

primeiro de tudo: fique próximo na sua base e coloque tochas próximas dela , tenha certeza que você tenha carvão por próximo , se a sua energia acabar feche e abra novamente (porém perto da base) , veja ao canto superior se a temperatura permite lhe sair ou n , use as tochas para não morrer de hipotermia , não cave sem tochas , e sempre tenha uma escavadeira (número 1 do teclado eu creio) por perto, se você cair mire em um lugar alto e aperte f e se o local for muito escuro aperte g esses dois botões (f,g) são ilimitados sinta-se a vontade para usar, na sua base ela pode vir ou não com uma escavadeira com o carvão , ela vem com um centro de pesquisas onde você pode identificar itens atráves do scanner (botão m) , uma máquina chamada 'shelter' ou algum assim para quando vc achar minérios e outra chamada factory para fabricar itens de todos os nívels e por fim no meio fica junto com uma máquina que armazena energia. Temos duas energias no jogo... a que vc carrega (pode tranferir para máquinas , scanner , e armas para matar insetos entre outros (v) ) e a da base (energia que é distribuída para máquinas vc pode pega-lás ou tranferi-las energia para elas. o tutorial é bem complexo pq realmente da trabalho. 

passo 2: a conexão das maquinas são bem simples só posiciona-las no lugar certo, simples n? minérios podem ser encontrados ao redor do jogo use uma escavadeira e de um pouco de energia (em torno de 100) para coletar os minérios e se possuir dificuldade o scanner (M) pode ajudar bastante.

passo 3: para contruir coisas engenhas. Bom primeiramente você necessita ter bastante energia no personagem e um pouco de carvão ao hub (á maquiná centralizada que envia um grande sinal) vc necessita reabastecer direto até a energia ser suficiente ai então as outras abas de ""recipe"" e a do lado dela são desbloqueados com energia necessária e pontos de ""research"".

passo 4 : deixe sua primeira base bem simples aproveite as pedras que são mais fáceis de serem obitidas.

bom o jogo é muito bom e n é nehuma cópia de minecraft é mto mais engenhoso espero que vcs aproveitem bastante pq pra conseguir jogar bem é só com percistência ok? vlw galera xD.",1422033852,1422033852,True,22,0,0.711194276809692383,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Pour le moment, le jeu (du moins en mode survie) manque de contenu, et certains items (comme les gatling que l'on peut installer sur ses contenaires de stockage ou les bras qui permettent de prendre de manière automatique un minerai d'une chaîne pour le mettre sur une autre) ne servent pas encore.

it is currently a sandbox creative with a sandboxy survival modes game, soon to be a game with creative and a true survival game mode with creepy crawlies...

it has similarities to minecraft, sure, and no doubt people will compare the two games to each other, but it is different on a multitude of levels and scale, and in a lot of areas.
i leave it up to you, the new player to find out what exactly, as i found that some players find different areas overlapping then others...


as for what is actually in the game, it works for the majority and is good fun, though not to much is there yet, but if it doesnt work (properly) it is highly likely that there is work being done on the subject which fixes or improves it the next or coming update(s), and if you report a bug which hasnt been covered properly yet, the devolopers will be very happy to fix or at least as soon as they can, and they let people know what they actually do.
you'll likely get a response anyway unless its considered trolling.

there are currently big feature updates on the roadmap to diversify the game and improve it as far as i know, which will make this game from a good alpha/beta, to great up till amazing released game. (*cough* *transportation* *cough* *fluids* *cough* *to name a few* *cough* *cough*)


i'd say if you like voxel based games, give this a try, its different from the norm with its machines and ideas, definatly worth the few bucks/euros it will cost you, though i have to warn you, there are bug, but this is normal for a young game (currently alpha/beta).

I've been playing for a few hours now and I find it rather frustrating. Mainly because some of the features just don't make sense and are not well explained and the worst of all: survival you're basically locked to just one world, it's NONSTOP snowy and windy and all you actually hear is the generator's humming and the wind blowing. So not only does the frustration add up, it's basically also very frustrating.

I made the mistake and got my brother a license as well as multiplayer was announced and again... was very disappointed as many features were not included and to date I have not managed to actually get a server running and even if I managed, it basically would only be a creative server. No thanks.

It doesn't help that the EarlyAccess information box targets a release towards the end of 2014. It's 2015 now and still far away from release. Worse: if you follow the dev's twitter (or twitch) account, you can actually follow him streaming other games. I think I stopped following him after he started playing the borderlands pre-sequel and even gloated about how much he played and streamed recently... at the time mostly borderlands. I wonder at what stage he actually tries to finish the game, rather than playing and streaming other games but his own. Obviously not much, otherwise the game probably would have been finished before the end of 2014 as promised. And I will not go into all the whining he does on Twitch and Twitter how bad money making is via steam and that he could do with a bit more games being sold etc... 

So far, I cannot recommend this game at all if you're interested in the survival part. I cannot talk about the creative part, but then again - it says it's survival... and as that part is certainly by far not close to be finished or any good for that matter.

- world setup basically non-existant (other than free name choice)
- world setup features that are in with placeholders restrict to things like difficulty, and I think the amount of resources
- world setup cannot change the world you're landing on, or the weather, so you'll forever be stuck with annoying nonstop wind sounds... snow... cold... and wind... and snow... and wind... if you don't die of hypothermia, you'll either die real-life of boredom or the after-math of a depression
- it's nice that conveyor-belts etc. are being big announced in the screenschots but what's the point if it doesn't explain how the system works (and that's a big downer in general... many features have no explanation, i.e. research, what gives points, why would you scan things, what's the point... etc.) and for some of the resources I ran back and forth (very repetitive) for an hour and only had enough resources for one item, far away from any automatism... I wonder how some other players managed that.

Anyway, the game has been released December 10th in 2013. It's January 2015 and game is still in EarlyAccess.

I suspect that the developers really do not know who their customers are and this is actually very important thing in gaming, you depends on them. I see this because of some of your responses towards negative reactions and to normal questions, many of these reactions are quite bluntly and in most cases when you get a reaction like that in a store you walk to the next store.

And who are your clients ?? ..... I a gamer and beside me hundreds of other gamers. We have not always right but we do have when it comes to our game experiences. Besides, we are not your enemy but an ally (as gamers we want to help you), but we take care of our own brothers (fellow gamers) protects for mistakes we have experiance our selfs.

Last week began Fortress Craft Evolved again, because i got new information and I went deeper into the game. Because when I bought the game a year ago, the game was a disappointed for me and I marked it as not playable - Creative mode was boring for me and i didenn't have a goal and i didden't know there was a survival mode back then.

Now I'm starting over again (I discovered the survival mode) and I try to find some reading matirial on the game, but there where nearly none (there are a number YourTubers). Unfortunately, that is because there is no community behind the game.

How come there is no community? Then I come back to my beginning, by the failt of communication from you as developers, what result is that gamers have no connection with the game and walk away. Why should I as a gamer take part of a community when the developer think they are better than me?

I also know quite annoing to read bad things of your game, it's your baby, I also know that a bad reaction can hit hard and that the first reaction is to hit hard back in respond to it, but usually that is wrong. I would recommend writing a response, wait a day, after reading your responce like you  get the as customer get the response, throw your reaction away and write a respones you as your customer would like to get. It is all about your customers not about you as a developer/person. Every reaction you get is not an attack on you (exept this one), every reaction is there to make your baby better.

Give customers love you and they give love back but give them hate you get hate back.


I also promise to them when I notice that you as developers improve your behavior, my opinion (like many others) wil chance to the better. Because we as gamers want the best game as posable game and a few even better developers, but like the game you are not at your full potential and i feel i have to call you on your bad habbits.",1420544171,1420544205,False,6,0,0.498178154230117798,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game randomly hard-locks my computer. This happens with no other program and I have throughly tested my memory.

The menu does not pause the game, so you can die from adjusting settings (especially in the first 5 hours in a world).

You're in constant peril of death for the first several hours of the game and after patiently strategeicly attempting for almost 12 gameplay hours in a world, I just got to the point of crafting the first 2nd tier item. Survival is frustratingly slow.
You start with a single device to smelt ores, and to build another is a 3rd teir build and reportedly among the community takes roughly 30 hours of gameplay to get to. I have more than 20 hours and can still not yet survive going deep enough to *find* T3 resources.

Can very easily jump into a block and see through the level. There is even a four-click method to see through the world reliably at any time you want. Major game breaker.


Pros:

The mining is automated for the most part as you grow. Then the smelting becomes automated. Then the building.
Cool system, allows for huge top-end growth.

Really nice voxel graphics.

Read on if that confuses you.

I've played a lot more Minecraft in my time than I'm prepared to discuss. There's a lot wrong with that game, and FortressCraft Evolved seems to be on the right path to fixing it. I've always found creative mode in Minecraft to be dull - for me, there needs to be the chance of failure/death, no matter how slight.  I've always hated the amount of time that goes to waste just trying to mine blocks in Survival, though, and FortressCraft has taken a great direction mixing the two. I don't really appreciate that the only way you can die is freezing to death... I know you can take some form of fall damage (with a really annoying screen effect), but I don't actually know if it can kill you. But! It's Early Access, and I can appreciate that these things take time.

A few suggestions I would make, assuming that the developer(s) read(s) this:

-Portable block identification. Some way to make it not a pain to go back to ""home base"" and have to identify things before you can use them. I get that it's unrealistic for Steve? the wandering hobo to magically know what iron ore looks like and how to use it, but it's willing suspension of disbelief. Honestly, I would more readily believe that a space-man on what was probably a mining ship has basic earth metals committed to memory. 

-Make the particle effect for ""home base"" visible on low graphics (that is, if we really have to have home base to begin with). There was an interesting glitch when I first started up the game that made the ship just fly off into infinity instead of crashing to ground. Since I started the game on fastest graphics, the purple light particle never showed up... unless the ship legitimately never crashed and flew across the endless map. I reset that world anyway, so we may never know.

-The way chunks load is entertaining, but I feel like that has to be taking up CPU that could be used a bit more responsibly. I don't personally know enough about this to go in depth about it, just kind of suggesting that the animation be dropped in favor of chunks ""popping"" into existence.

In the end, the game is solid, and I really believe it has potential. It's not going to be the Minecraft killer, but that's alright, since Minecraft is enough of a danger to itself. There's plenty of bugs to iron out, but like I already said, these things take time. All I can really hope for is that these guys aren't the Terraria team in disguise, making a quick buck and running off, leaving an orphaned game that could be much more.",1419580060,1419580060,True,2,0,0.516971230506896973,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Second problem is balance. Prepare to wait a lot and to make many monotonous movements.

now, the bad points, (yes i understand it is early access and things take time) while there is a survival mode, there is nothing survival about it other than you can freeze to death which sure, is a cool mechanic, but easily avoidable, the ingame 'guide' feel's to be lacking in information, like whats the little icon next to the lamp icon? and what is the secondary battery? things like that could use some further explination, some of the textures are a little low quality and seem 'cheap' like basic model designs, the tool for example, the animation makes the whole think look like all the parts are just hovering there and aren't really connected to each other, but thats not exactly game breaking.

summery: basically this is a great game, while it lacks the features other games provide with mods, this has everything as stock, it runs brilliantly on even low end machines and i can only imagine what it loks like on a top end rig, as it is early access there are still plenty of things that can be improved on and added, which given how much i feel i get for this game paid £1.49 during a sale, is great, would i pay full price for this? as it stands sadly no i wouldnt, when more is added? certainly, at the time of review i have spent 8.2 hours game time having purchased it only two days ago, 10/10 will recommend",1418648259,1418648259,True,6,0,0.483981907367706299,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- Devs (I think there's only one dev - Adam Sawkins) [b][u]are making FortressCraft since approx 2 years[/u][/b]. We can see that on their Youtube channel, FC videos are 2 years old or more. After this long time FortressCraft is still in early access with lack of most interesting features. I'm wondering why this game development is so slow when the original FortressCraft was sold and earned milions $... Or maybe they lied about FortressCraft success?

- Game is still in early pre-alpha version where we have ONE world that looks similar every time we want to create it again, why to the fack there's always snowy biome?! Every new game starts in the same way, the same world, the same origin.

- Lack of block, there are maybe 40 blocks in whole game

- [i]The original FortressCraft was one of the best-selling Indie games of all time.[/i] Maybe it was... but this one will be dead soon, only 300 reviews in one year. 100 of them are negative. People are not intrested in making ripoff of ripoff again.

- Unique survival mode based on... well... nothing, because there's nothing hard to do. You as player, you are not forced to defend yourself using weapons, walls, shields, cannons or something. Game isn't challenging. The main difference between survival and creative is simple - there's no flying mode and you have to craft stuff. That's all.

- You can achieve all avaible stuff in this game in just one day

- There's nothing much to do, devs should play Factorio for some days and look how factory-based game should work

- There's no in game tutorial which could teach new players how to play this game, there's just some info what cartain block is doing, without example.",1418637623,1418637623,False,156,11,0.587173044681549072,17,True,False,True,False,,,

I don't know the first version on X360 but Evolved, in this Alpha stage, isn't so appealing. Wait until Early Access ends.

Why i didn't like it so much:
1- Graphics is the real problem. Low framerate on Good preset (but it's good on Simple, so kind of OK). Models are horrible, especially block ones (like ore deposit boxes, ore extractors, ore refineries etc.). Also still buggy, time by time i see through blocks; can't see distant lands.
2- Survival mode? What is that? The only survival in-game is hypotermia which doesn't affect your gameplay. You only die and respawn. Ah, and your robot companion needs a power core. That's all.
3- GUI isn't so useful.
4- You have to identify every kind of block which i found it as a donkey work.
5- This game needs small amount of interactive guides imho. Only a small amount of them.

I'd like to make a more solid recommendation but it's unbearable in this state so wait, don't buy it now. This is my last Early Access title, i guess.

The game, however, is not really worth a thumb-up at the moment, because the game is not really playable now.

The developer says that the creative mode is easy to use, but I didn't see how 'easy' it is. Well if you have played Minecraft, and you like building, you should probably know the plugin WorldEdit, and that really make building easier. But although this game have a 'powerful' building tool, it can't really make any different. If I want to place a chunk, that's OK, but it's really a challenge to make the chunk in proper size and position. The 'powerful' building tool seems to be more like a terrain brush rather than an assistant tool. In my opinion, something that can be called building tool should at lease have all the function that WroldEdit have. And the build to me function didn't work at all.

By the way, there are no slopes, even no slabs and stairs in the game. Although I can make it an model manually, is that really easy that I need 8 models of one meterial in order to create the roof? And I REALLY want some furnitures but I can't find anything that really seems to be furniture, and I even can't find doors.

Also the survival mode is really hard to play. The ping tool in the scanner really fustrate me a lot, because it can make the screen bright violin and it's hard to see through with these on. Energy things is almost OK, but why can't power centre charge the research centre? Every time I have to move the energy cell right next to the research centre in order to charge it, and transfer energy manually.

And the UI is hard to use. Something that I really want to complain is that, could I have an inventory? And also, drag-drop control is not featured, and I should first select the item in my hot bar, and then open the UI to feed it, and the energy centre have no buffer, so I have to throw in a coal every minute, before I can have any automatic machanic.

So with all these problems, why I still give it thumb-up? The main reason is that I only get the game for 2.24USD (and I purchased 13.44CNY), that's far cheaper than Minecraft. And also you can't expect a lot on a game in technic preview stage. 4 years ago, I used to play the classic version of Minecraft, and that has even less function than this game in this stage, but everyone enjoy that. There's still a lot of time for this game to be improved, and I hope that my 2 USD will worth 40 USD in the future.

So, it's still worth to buy it, but don't expect too much too soon. Buy it and put it aside for several years is OK.",1418550793,1418550793,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- Think you can start server from the multiplayer menu? Nope. You need to shuffle through vast amount of data to even find where you can start the server (which is ingame esc menu, because main menu's MULTIPLAYER would have naturally be too logical).

in any case i was happily surprised when i started up a new world again. before the game was simply too easy, 1 million+ piece ore veins and no hostile mobs were my biggest issues. the tech tree progression is a lot smoother now and makes more sense. 

Pros:
-extensive tech tree progression ( lots of new higher tier machines)
-survival is more apparent now
-unique mobs
-early game progression is much more balanced 
-more building blocks added (windows and a few others)
-very few bugs/glitches ... reletively polished
-new base defense system .. awesome :)

Cons:
-still some unfinished UI elements, nothing gamebreaking
-no penalty for death
-still no compass or map feature of any kind  .. lost your base? easy, dieing is the fastest way to find your base :)
-the giant Spider bot like to step all over you a lot :P (doesn't affect gameplay but is annoying when trying to see something its standing on lol)

now knowing what to expect from FCE has been a better experience for myself, so if you resource/power management and logistics and really strange mobs trying to hinder your progess constantly then grab this game.

 side note: the Developer seems to be a lone wolf on this game so dont' expect a lot of new content to be added on a schedule like other games. updates a little slower for this game but the dev is working his tail off to produce this game :)",1417393096,1451763982,True,0,0,0.460176974534988403,20,True,False,False,False,,,

leuke game   het is  minecraft maar dan beter  je bent in het begin lang bezig met het uitzoeken hoe je  je langzame base moet automaticeren maar heb je dat eemaal onder de knie  dan kan je gaan exploren
het nadeel van minecraft was
 dat je   90% van de tijd op zoek was naar  ores
   dat hebben ze hier aangepast met ore drils als je die aan sliuit en met een lazer door middel van een baterij die weer bevesticht is met je  base om  ze nonstop van stroom voorziet en dan met een opslag tank  ernaast en het met of een robot of een  rail je het door kan linken naar   je oven en dan  alles automaticeert maar  eer je dat door hebt hoe het werkt ben je  een dag verder 
nog een nadeel van minecraft 
is dat als je gaat diggen je op een gegevenmoment bij bad rock komt  en dat je niet dieper kan 
dat is hier totaal niet aan de orde  ik ben tot 1000 meter geweest en nog kon ik  lekker door diggen  wel kom je steeds meer vreemde  levende blokjes tegen
eerst was ik als de dood ervoor   maar in eazy  doen ze niets
leuk is ook dat je wapens kan maken en tier tecks hebt  hoe hoger je teck ho geafanceerder   je  je base kan bouwen 
en hoe sneller  het gaat 

ik heb mezelf erop betrapt dat ik meer bezig ben met  automaticeren dan  echt  mooie dingen bouw 
en dan praat ik alleen al over survival game

de nadelen  van vroegtijdige toegang is dat je af en toe   als je start je crash plane 
door de map valt en je dus je game moet resetten 
anders crast je plane niet
en  kan je niet spelen 
ook bugt hij alleen bij de eerste start dat je vast kan staan  simpel eruit en de game opnieuw starten verhelpt dit 
ook komt het voor  dat je als een spiegel af en toe door de map kan kijken  maar dat is minimaal
en heb ik al buggs megemaakt met   lazers die geen energie overbrengen  maar dat is in game te verhelpen door de lazer opnieuw te plaatsen

om mijn  stem schaal 1 op 10 duidelijk te maken geef ik  vroegtijdige toegang  een  9 
de nadeelen wegen niet op tegen de speel plezier   en als je minecraft met  red ore en zonnepanelen dingen automaticeren  leuk vond is en alles bouwen  wat je maar wilde  ook leuk vind is dit je game  als je meer in to the aanval bent  probeer dan ook eens robocraft is hetzelfde maar dan met machines  en het is GRATIS
deze game voor  9 euro

I have not played a lot, but from the meager 2 hours there are a lot of things that, unfortunately, made this a waste of money for now. The price tag would be justified if the game weren't the mess it is now. There are ofc a lot of pros to it but the amount of cons, and the form they take, is just a little too much. Also, as much as people would love to say it is a Minecraft clone, the similarities end at ""block based building"" and ""mining"". You could just as well place Space Engineers in the same category then.

Pros:

- Infinite worlds, a la Minecraft (better than the 256 block height it has anyways)
- Good potential for a crafting system, unlike any other Minecraft-ish game
- Research, blueprints, power system, different mining modes
- Much more realistic processing and production, with ore smelting, refining, and producing items and gear
- ""Health"" system with temperature, power levels and hypothermia

Cons:

- Buggy UI and menus, to the point it becomes very annoying
- Lack of a proper tutorial (there is one but it's messy and sometimes unclear)
- Buggy creative multiplayer with no proper netcode or player sync
- Extremely buggy survival multiplayer (lots of ore duping without even trying and more)
- Very odd color scheme and graphical design choices for blocks and machinery (more of a personal opinion, but ir sure seems off)

It's a good game, with a lot of potential, but it's a shame that the bugs and clunkiness of it made it very hard to play. I will definitely check back in a couple updates and hope it still was a good investment. For people who can cope with bugs and still enjoy a game, go ahead, but there are too many things either unfinished or (partially) broken right now. I still recommend it tho because of this future potential.",1414302274,1414302274,True,8,0,0.550710916519165039,0,False,False,True,False,,,

[EDIT]  Game continues to get better and many features have been added (more machines, more flexible placement capabilities)  Dev's are toying with leaving early access to avoid the stigma but, in my view, it still isn't a complete game.

In it's current state it is absolutely worth every penny and if the pace of improvements continues it will only grow in value and entertainment.",1414095974,1440624754,True,6,0,0.5049399733543396,2,True,False,True,False,,,

I decided to test this and built a structure going from the surface (Y:0) and built all the way up to 3,254...  I could have kept going, but let's be honest, that would have been pointless.  So then I decided to find the floor of the world, and dug down to 9,153...  And I could have kept going.  Minecraft's 256 block height limit is put to absolute shame, as this game shows its beefy and well-constructed voxel engine.  I'll admit, I'm going to use Minecraft as my comparison here, because Minecraft is the definitive voxel game to compare to.

The game's view distance is comparable to that of Minecraft's 15 chunk view distance, which means you can see a lot.  In Minecraft there's a survival situation which revolves around food.  Currently in FortressCraft Evolved the survival situation revolves around body heat.  You're in a constant struggle to keep yourself cool enough and warm enough at the same time.  Standing in fire makes your body overheat, draining your power cells, and will kill you of heat exhaustion.  Staying underground or out in the elements at night can cause you to begin to freeze, and you can die of hypothermia as well.

The game is looking good already in its pre-alpha state, and I absolutely can't wait for the full release.  Normally I'd say ""don't buy this early access unless you're ready to deal with bugs,"" but in this case, the sooner you get it, the less you'll end up paying in the end.  So it's at your discretion, buy now and save, or buy later for peace of mind.

-- The 64-Bit Version may crash upon Quitting the game to desktop.
-- Having more than one ore type in your inventory will confuse the smelter's ""Feed Ores"" button. (You cannot make a storage system without multiple ores.)
-- The A.R.T.H.U.R or whatever it is called, requires a Power Core to be crafted for it to work proper again. However, you do not know this recipe, even after researching the black box and power suit upgrades.
-- Right-Clicking items in your hot bar (using the mouse-enabled HUD) removes them from your inventory, forever. You cannot collect more of the item, you cannot see the item when using scroll wheel, etc. It's gone, forever.
-- Using your mining laser on coal ore (or any ore) constantly will seem to continue mining the ore incredibly faster than an ore extractor, this is not the case, the blocks that appear dropped are ghost ore item drops.
-- Game on ""Fabulous"" has issues with block animations, etc. The loading screen also freezes on that setting, even though the computer can handle said setting over 60 FPS (IE: Getting screen-tear since my computer can process faster even on Fabulous.) The setting can also lag computers that are far, far above the recommended requirements.
-- The spider mech enemy does nothing.
-- Your gun cannot hurt the spider mech enemy. (IE: The spider mech has no hitbox.)
-- Sometimes, during the day, the solar cell on the suit does not work.
-- Sometimes, even if you have enough power and research points, some research items will say they can't be researched.
-- The world select button on the Escape menu does nothing.
-- When creating a world with a custom name, the world's name reverts to ""World"" on game reload.",1412635328,1412635328,True,2,0,0.462794899940490723,2,True,False,True,False,,,

I especially enjoyed the idea of creating zed spawners. I must have created thousands of those things...

But anyway, on with THIS game.

I had to say this: it's not easy starting out. I had little time to read the help and starting tips before I realized that my suit energy was dropping fairly quickly. To top it off, I had to also wrestle with the controls before I was able to make my way to my crash site.

But once I managed to get the controls down, I was able to start mining for resources. I got lucky and found a tin and coal vein inside the mountain I set up camp on, and eventually found iron and copper (though they were a long climb down into the earth.

I think the suit energy idea is a good idea. It's going to keep you alive, and it allows you to stay out in the cold a while longer before you need to recharge. And the scanner idea was nice as well, though I think I know a tree when I see one. Unless it suddenly grows tentacles and tries to eat me. Then I'm just being eaten.

And the new entities in the the game have given me more questions than answers. There are these flying robots that, when I kill them, drop ruined stingers. Not sure what to do with those, or what they are suppose to do for the bots, but it's interesting. And let's not forget the wacky-looking spider thing I found stuck on the mountain. That thing wouldn't die, nor would it move. I'm curious as to how all of those things got there.

While this game is pretty fun to play, and the creative mode is a blast to mess with, I did have some general issues, ones that I'm sure some or most players will have run into.

1. Resource Management. 
While I can understand that resources are going to be important for your survival, it just seems kind of ridiculous to have to travel hundreds of blocks away in order to find even basic resources (it took me over an hour to just find copper). And the majority of the time, my energy is being used to keep my few ore extractors going, or scanning for more areas to mine new resources. I've yet to find anything new.

2. Control Layout.
This is one of my biggest beefs, and for a good reason. As I said before, I had to fight with the controls for a minute before I could get moving, though it took me even longer to learn how to switch back to my scanner from my gathering tool. It also feel a little clunky, having to reach across the keyboard to hit a certain hotkey. I know the keys can be rebound, but I tend not to mess with that. Maybe a few minor rethinkings of the layout would be nice. Or controller support! I'm honestly one for full controller support, so maybe that could be a future addition.

3. Crafting.
The crafting system is relatively straight forward, which is nice, but requires resources that could take a lot of time to find, and even more time to gather. And even with the resources that are almost immediately found, the process requires more time and more resources. To illustrate my issue:

8 iron=1 iron bar, 15 iron bars=1 ore extractor.

It just seems a little tedious.

4. Environmetal Hazards.
Now, honestly, this is a cool feature, but one that needs some working. Heat keeps you from freezing to death, obviously. But what makes me a little irritated is the fact that you can't make heated rooms. It just seems like one of those things that you'd think would have been implemented a while back to help players better manage themselves. I'm really hoping it's added in a future update, though. Cold nights would be so much more pleasant.

5. Terrain.
This one is just something small, nothing major. But I feel like it's something that could be implemented at some point in even a minor update. 
Having to jump to go up another block gets a little tedious, not to mention it's a little hard on the spacebar (at least mine, anyway). Maybe the option of automatically climbing up one block could make an appearance in a future update.

But other than that, this game is looking pretty good! I'm looking forward to seeing what the Devs have in store for futue updates, as well as what other players will suggest adding to it.

ハイクオリティなサンドボックス型のゲームが多数開発され、
このゲームはアーリーアクセスを長々とやってる間に時代遅れになってしまった感があります。
開発者がこのまま逃げそうな気がするので、おすすめできません。

※追記↓

アーリーアクセス開始から約一年が経過したので久しぶりにやってみましたが・・・
開始当初からから全然変わってませんｗ
バイオームが一種類しかないサンドボックスゲーム。アルファ版状態。

サバイバル要素もほとんどなし。死んでもアイテムロストもなく拠点に戻されるだけ。
主人公の死亡条件は低温、高温、放射能、毒、酸欠とアイコンだけがありますが、現状低温しか実装されてません。しかもトーチが一つあれば設置→体温回復→回収で絶対に死にません。
毒、放射能については、そもそもワールドのどこにも存在してません。
高温や酸欠については、生命維持装置のエネルギーが切れてスーツ内温度が５００度になろうが、
地下２０００メートルの縦穴に潜ろうが、主人公はピンピンしてます。
お前スーツいらないんじゃね？

半年に一回のアップデートでは、いろいろアップデートしたように見せかけてますが、
結局はブロックが１種類と使い道がないクラフトアイテムが増えただけ。
あとはエフェクトの色の変更やテクスチャの変更、効果音の変更という
やっつけ作業のどうでもいいアップデートで誤魔化してます。
バグについては前述のブロックバグを放置どころか、
むしろ主人公が勝手に左にスライドしてしまうというバグが増えました。（一度発動すると、再起動するまで治らない）

開発は完成させる気がゼロみたいです。
値段は当初は１５００円くらいだった気がしますが、いつの間にか９００円に値下げしてますね。
もう作る気ないから、安くして売れるだけ売っちまおうという腹が見えます。
ですが、プレイするだけ時間の無駄ですので、買う必要はないと思います。

Warum werden Sie sich wohl fragen. 

Im Aufbau der Welt ähneld FortressCraft dem Spiel Minecraft. Klötzchen soweit das Auge reicht. Aber bei genauerer Betrachtung fallen direkt die Maschinen und die Energeianzeige des Überlebensanzugs auf. Aber worum geht es überhaupt?

Die Erforschung der Welt steht im Mittelpunkt. Man gräbt sich mit einem Werkzeug in den Untergrund und sucht nach Erz. Der Clou ist aber wie man die gefundenen Erze abbaut. Entweder so wie bei Minecraft und Co, oder man lässt das von Maschinen erledigen. Abbaumaschine platzieren, diese mit Energie füttern und warten bis Minilager der Maschine voll ist, dann entleeren. Ok, mit der sekundären Funktion des Werkzeugs geht das schneller, kostet aber weit aus mehr Anzugsenergie. Auch die von Anfang an vorhandene Kopflampe verbraucht sehr viel Energie.

Die Energieerzeugung ist also sehr wichtig! Man braucht sie für den Anzug um auf dem kalten Planeten nicht zu erfrieren und auch für die Anlagen die man im laufe des Spiels baut. Und das schöne dabei ist das man alles automatisieren kann. Man lässt zum Beispiel die mit Maschinen abgebaute Kohle über Förderbänder zu dem Generator transportieren, der dann anschließend Energie erzeugt, diese dann in einer Energiezelle speichert mit der man die Maschinen mittels Energietransmitter antreibt.

Oder man lässt Erze abbauen, die dann per Förderband zum Schmelzofen gebracht werden und die fertigen Barren dann mit dem Förderband ins Massenlager gebracht und vollautomatisch ein oder aus gelagert werden. Aber keine Angst! Eine Abbaumaschine fördert solange das Erz bis die komplette Ader abgebaut ist und pro Klötzchen sind bis zu 600 Erzbrocken enthalten. Naja man braucht aber auch acht Brocken um einen Barren zu schmelzen. Und wenn das Lager mal zu klein geworden ist, dann wird es einfach um mehr Lagerblöcke erweitert.

Je tiefer man gräbt um so kälter wird es und um so schneller verbraucht der Anzug seine Energie. Der kleine Roboter, der den Spieler begleitet, opfert seine eigene begrenzte Energie um den Spieler unter Tage mit Energie zu versorgen. Wenn der Anzug keine Energie mehr hat erfriert man und spawnt oben am Startpunkt wieder mit voller Energie. Mit den nötigen Upgrades die man für Anzug UND Begleiter craften kann hört das ""Massensterben"" im Untergrund aber der Vergangenheit an.

Jeder unbekannte Block muss vorher gescannt werden, damit die genaue Funktion im Forschungsterminal ermittelt werden kann. Mit neu entdeckten Blöcken schaltet man neue Baupläne zum forschen frei. Den Scanner hat man auch von Anfang an. Aber man kann damit auch nach bekannten und unbekannten Erzadern scannen, was leider auch Energie kostet.

Zu den kämpfen mit der Alienbevölkerung des Planeten kann ich noch nichts sagen, denn sie verhalten sich friedlich. Entweder ist das noch nicht im Spiel eingebaut oder die fiesen Aliens kommen erst noch. Ich bin ja auch erst kanpp 500 Blöcke tief. Man hat von Anfang an eine Schusswaffe dabei, falls es mal zu Kampf kommen sollte.

Zur Orientierung im untergrund hat man zwar keine Karte, aber man kann sich eine holographische Projektion einblenden, die alle Maschinen und Transmitter anzeigt. Das ist auch zwingend nötig wenn man von oben nach unten graben muss um Energie von einer Energiezelle ohne großen Umweg zum Abbauroboter leiten muss.

Für alle die der englsichen Sprache nicht mächtig sind gibt es einen guten Guide in deutscher Sprache das die Grundlegenen Funktionen des Spiels erklärt. Das Spiel ist natürlich noch lange nicht fertig und es fehlt an Abwechslung. Aber das feilen an der Energieerzeugung, dem Energienetz und an der Barrenproduktion macht jetzt schon verdammt viel Spaß und schnell sind ein paar Stunden vorbei.

Nachtrag am 03.10.2015

The game is worth it. 

In the main game you start out in a seemingly random area with a supposed crashing ship that is locked on until it crashses. You find your crashed ship via light beacon piercing high through the sky. Your initial objectives is to stay warm which is done by burning trees or if you are lucky, coal if it is within eyesight. From here on out is just a slow climb to gather resources like coal , iron and so on to get upgrades and eventually some sort of automation of ore harvesting and smelting. 

There are some interesting features like the ore scanner which scans blocks and is further identified at your reasearch station . It also lets you scan for things that you have not identified, useful for finding new ores or for ones you have previously found. There are a few useful features that are thoughtful and useful and they blend in with game mechanics as to not seem overpowered.  

This game is not without its flaws. There are a number of bugs I've encountered. 

-When your ship crashes you cannot relocate your starting area without some sort of tool later in the game but it glitched and I accidently had it placed far from my base and I couldnt basically continue reasonably. 

-Saving your world and continuing later seems to initiate that crash scene again and again, destroying everything I've built that was in its crash radius, though it left me with 2 starting areas. I lost everything in my inventory though. 

The menus are convoluted and half of the buttons seem to work correctly. For example when crafting there are arrows that let you change the quantity of the batch but the arrows dont change anything as if they are just apart of the graphics.

I gave the game another shot and I managed to find survival mode as well.
The game has a really interesting mechanic as to transfering power from one thing to the other although I sadly had to say most things are still unclear to me. 
I really hope things will get explained somewhat better in the future. However assuming at some point the game will be a little more clear in what to do when and where, how to fully craft even the first thing, like the power core which the lovely robot assistance keep mentioning about.
Also the sort of short manual, starters guid if you may is nowhere to be found once I clicked it away.
I remain to my point a sort of forced manual could really help someone like me get through the first bit of the game learning the basics and how to craft just a few things. After that the helping hand may go away as in any other game and one is of to explore the world for oneself.

หลังๆมานี้รู้สึกว่า เกมส์อินดี้แนว sand box survival  เอะอะก็ซอมบี้ กับตัดไม้ ล่าสัตว์ ขุดขี้ดิน. เห็นมีไดโนเสาร์ กับคนป่าล่าคนกินอยู่แว๊ปๆ แต่ก็รู้สึกแปลกใจก่ะตัวเองว่าเหตุฉนัยจึงไม่สนใจจะสอยมาเล่น.  เพราะดูจากกราฟฟิกแล้วมันลูกหม้อ. D7D ชัดๆ แค่เปลี่ยนจากซอมบี้เป็นอย่างอื่นเท่านั้นเอง. (ถึงจะคนละค่ายก็เถอะ) 

สำหรับ. FortressCraft (ขอเรียกว่า FCละกัน ) พูดอย่างไม่มโนเลยว่า แซบ! เกมส์อินดี้ตัวนี้ไม่ใช่พึ่งออกมา. แต่มันหลงหูหลงตาร่วงไปไกลจาก top list. ของ stream อาจจะเป็นเพราะระบบที่ซับซ้อน (หรือเพราะไม่มีซอมบี้)หรือเปล่า แต่ถ้าให้เดาอาจจะเป็นเพราะตัวเกมส์ออกมาช่วงกระแสมายคราฟครองเมือง จนโดนเบียดร่วง. ซึ่งเป็นที่น่าเสียดายสำหรับคนที่คิดอย่างนั้น FC มีอะไรมากกว่าที่เห็น

ระบบเกมส์เนื้อหาหลักๆเลยคือการเอาชีวิตรอดจากดาวร้างที่อุณหภูมิติดลบ เพราะฉนั้นศัตรูตัวฉกาจ. ไม่ใช่หุ่นเอเลี่ยนอย่างในรูป. แต่เป็นสภาพแวดล้อมที่ฆ่าคุณได้. โดยเราจะมีเพียงชุดเกราะที่ป้องกันเราจากสภาพแวดล้อมที่โหดร้าย ซึ่งพลังงานของมันจะลดลงเรื่อยๆ ช้าเร็วขึ้นอยู่กับสภาพแวดล้อมภายนอก. จากคอนเซปการเอาตัวรอดที่ว่า สิ่งที่เราต้องทำคือการหาวัตถุดิบต่างๆมาแปรสภาพเป็นพลังงาน. ผ่านอุปกรณ์ไฮเทคที่เกมส์มีมาให้ตั้งแต่เริ่มต้น. วัตถุดิบทุกอย่างนำมาแปรสภาพได้ตั้งแต่ดิน ไม้ แร่. และแน่นอนว่าถ่านหินคือตัวเลือกที่ดีที่สุด. ต้องขอบใจเครื่องแสกนที่จะบอกตำแหน่งแร่ชนิดต่างๆซึ่งอยู่ลึกลงไปในชั้นใต้ดิน ซึ่งการกดใช้ทีนึงมันจะสูบพลังงานจากชุดเกราะเกือบ 25% แต่ก็ทดแทนด้วยปืนขุดเจาะที่กดจึ๊กเดียวบล๊อคก็กระจุย  ไม่ต้องขูดทีละแหมะด้วย ปิ๊กแอ๊ค. อีกต่อไป. ยกเว้นก้อนแร่. ที่ต้องใช้อุปกรณ์หัวเจาะที่เรียกว่า. Extractor และแน่นอนว่าเราต้องแบ่งพลังงานจากแบตเตอรี่ในชุดเกราะของเราให้มัน. -..-

จะเห็นว่า. พลังงานคือคีย์ของเกมส์นี้ ซึ่งหลังๆเราจะสามารถสร้างเครื่องปั่นไฟแบบพกพาและอุปกรณ์อื่นๆ ที่ต้องใช้แต้มวิจัยในการปลดล๊อค. และแต้มวิจัยที่ว่านี้ก็มาจากการค้นพบทรัพยากรณ์ใหม่ๆ (unknown ore) ซึ่งกว่าจะสำรวจครบจำเป็นต้องวางแผนการเดินทาง บนพื้นผิวไม่เท่าไหร่ แต่ใต้ดินนี่ โอกาศที่จะหลงทางกลับฐานไม่ถูกมีสูงมากที่ร้ายกว่านั้นคือมันไม่มีคำสั่งฆ่าตัวตายให้วาร์ปฟรี. -,,-

When I first played Minecraft, everything seems just simple and easy, but this game when you starts out it is very hard to understand what you are doing.  
Ok, first you need to find some ores, and let me tell you guys this: the ores are impossible to find, you would think ""oh I can just dig down and try my luck.""  So I did, i used super dig, used up all my power, made a HUGE cave from my super dig, and found nothing but rocks....
The guies are very unclear about what you need to do, and the machines are very hard to understand, I wish they made like a video about how to get started or something.
Did I forget to metion that there are few bugs?  (Of course, its Early Access)

Went to Creative:  Don't know what 95% of the machines does, seeing some robots following me around, not sure why or what they do.  I just wish they had BETTER/CLEAR guides on what to do and make it simple and easy, not 20 pages long.
I'm here for the cool machines and the ""FortressCraft"", not getting lost in what to do due to unclear guides!

Overall:
If you want to build: Just go to minecraft

Im gonna answer that right off the bat, no it can't. This game realeased in early access more than 4 YEARS AGO and I still have a better time playing the orignal one on the XBLA. This game completly fails to motavate you to do anything at all. It starts you out with a drill gun that can dig through ANYTHING IN THE GAME so I had no reason to craft a better one even if you can. It also starts you out with a FUCKING LASER CANNON so there is also no reason to get a better weapon either, y'know im not even sure if theres enemys in the game to shoot at. I did find little flying robot things that I could'nt collect like a perk (like in the first one) and I tried to shoot them with the Mega Death Death Ray Gun that it just gives you and it just wizzed right passed them. Speaking of robots you have a little robot thing that follows you around and shows you the block you're carrying incase your completly brain dead. Lastly, it spawns you with a 3 tourches  that emit enough heat to burn through the earths crust. See, there is this system much like thwe hunger in minecraft in here but with tempeture. And scince it spawns you in the middle of a blizzard I decided to make a house to get warm in. And after I made a house of wood and stone and waited for 5 minutes I did not get any warmer. So I dug in the middle of a moutain hoping to get warm and littarly nothing happened with 5 blocks of stone on either side protecting me from the cold. So the only way to get warm is by getting items that emit heat. But scince the crafting system is as easy to work as rubber stilts You're. Basicly. Fucked. But when I was on the brink of freezing to death I decided to die in good lighting, so I set down a tourch and withing 12 seconds I overheated and died ... so ... ya.

Frustrating at first, but already the developers have made it much better.

I've never played Minecraft but have always wanted to, but when I went to their website and would have had to sign up for an account before I could even see how much the stupid game cost, I became annoyed. I read on another site it was $30 (which I'm not sure is true or not, regardless I became more annoyed). Lo and behold, that same day on the front page of Steam I see FortressCraft for $4. Needless to say I got it.

The first hour was an incredibly frustrating experience because I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and the help menu wasn't helpful at all. Thankfully they have made it much more in-depth, so new users shouldn't have nearly as much trouble as I did. I read a guide and got into it, having quite a bit more fun even though finding ore was tough at first (they have also made this easier, using one key and scrolling to find the ping you want, whereas before there was a key combination for each ping type).

Now that I'm getting my base set up and things automated, I'm having a lot of fun! It's always cool to see your progress so clearly.

There are some bugs which is to be expected since it's an early-access game. Most annoying is that the x64 executable likes to go missing, so I've been playing with x32. There are infrequent crashes, and if you quit when anything is in your smelter the items get lost. Not a bug but slightly annoying when I first started playing: menus that don't completely work. Now that I know the features haven't been implemented it's fine, but before I was clicking and totally confused as to why nothing was happening.

The roadmap the developers have is great, and they seem to be very active here on Steam. Nice to know they're listening! Things I would like to see added are some ideas or guides for power plants and things like that, more detailed graphics (though I'm fine playing with the current ones), and maybe trees that regrow themselves. That would be cool. Seeds and stuff would be neat too.

Anyways, it's a great game and awesome for the price and all the stuff they have planned.",1399586818,1399586818,True,10,0,0.525862038135528564,2,True,False,True,False,,,

The worlds are huge, it's easy to get lost and fall down to somewhere far below your base, but that's what the grappling hooks for!

I don't have too many hours into it yet, but so far I haven't seen many bugs.  Occasionally the blocks go transparent if you're standing too close, and the pause menu doesn't seem to actually pause anything.  If you're going to walk away from it for a while, make sure you quit to desktop.

I was hoping Anthony's review was a bit of an exaggeration, but even after dozens of hours playing Minecraft, I was pretty lost after about a half hour playing this game. 

There were birds flying around that I couldn't kill, with text attached to them about crafting (Not sure if this is a bug or one of many confusing features), and even with tutorial screen at the beginning, I was still clueless. It kind of feel like it was written for someone who already has a lot of experience playing this game. 

I think I was supposed to find my crashed ship, but when I went to the area where it seemed to have gone down, there was just some ""power thing"" floating well above where I could reach it. I was able to mine a few rocks and trees, but couldn't seem to craft anything with them but torches. Even after chopping down trees, I saw no way to turn those into planks, or construct anything. 

Survival mode in Minecraft starts you with nothing, and no endless menu of things you could eventually build, which eases you into what eventually becomes a very complex game. I'm not sure how much more complex this game is supposed to be, but it's almost impossible to get into a game when I don't have the slightest clue what I'm doing. 

I'll try watching a Youtube tutorial on how to get through the first few days, but since this is still Early Access, I'd really recommend to the developers that they consider a very basic, starting from scratch, survival mode, and slowly introduce new features. I usually don't need my hand held figuring out games, but this one almost requires it. Assume the people playing your game have never even heard of a game like this before, and teach them how to play it. Right now, a 6 page tutorial on topics that make no sense to a beginner, isn't helping. 

I think I could really get into this game, but right now it's almost impossible, even if I wanted to. Please consider a more basic starting point for beginners, Devs, and teach as we go, rather than bombarding us with a bunch of information and features from the get go.

But all in all, I'm going to recommend this game because it is Early Access, and the Devs do seem dedicated to making improvements.

TL;DR: Survival mode is incredibly difficult to figure out, even if you've played Minecraft, but at this price point, this game is still worth picking up.",1399300178,1399300178,True,3,0,0.459081858396530151,4,True,False,True,False,,,

FortressCraft is basically a Minecraft + tech mod clone, minus Minecraft's charm. With a side of difficuilt and awkward to use interface. Plus an extra helping of bugs (even for early access). Not recommended. 

Longer version:
On startup Fortresscraft greets you with possibly the most detailed and intricate menu ever. This turned out to be a bad omen though as it's also possibly the most difficuilt to use menu ever. Difficuilt to the point of needing a tutorial to navigate. However after much random mouse button mashing I managed to overcome this hurdle and start a new survival world. Alas, I was one of the lucky few. We should spare a moment of thought for all those poor souls who failed to navigate the main menu, and instead flocked to Steam's forum for a solution... on how to use the main menu.

Once the world had loaded and the ringing in my ears caused by the really LOUD crashing ship passed I came to another hurdle, the help screen. I quickly browsed over the help text and tried taking in as many hotkeys as I could. There are a number of them as the only way to select a tool is with a hotkey. Which you can't rebind. 

After skimming the help screen I tried to close it by pressing escape, nothing. Tried clicking on stuff, nothing. Only after rolling my face across the keyboard, not once, but twice! Was I finally rid of the cursed help screen. (edit: The escape key sort of works in the latest version)

With arch-villan help screen defeated I was finally able to take in the world, the very bland world. This is where the clone shows through. Even the block's textures have that familiar MInecraft look, albeit high resolution. All other voxel games have moved away from cubes into their own form of voxels, and all of those new voxel games feel nice and fresh.  So coming back to a cube game can feel a bit underwhelming. Made worse by a world that has nothing going on. It's just snow and the occassional tree. Totally lacking in features that convince you this is an alien world.

The actual game, in it's current state, is centered around building an automated mining network similar to many Minecraft tech mods where you have mining machines that feed a conveyor of some sort. You then need a power network to run those machines etc.  So far the stuff in game is similar to stuff I've seen in mods. Which isn't a bad thing. Expanding on these ideas could lead to somewhere interesting. But.

And it's a big but. This game has a lot strange design features that either take away player agency or are there to piss you off. Like the decision to go against the convention of every other game in this genre, and reverse the block breaking and block placing mouse buttons. Those buttons are so ingrained now that I'm constantly wrecking my machines or digging holes when I meant to place a machine, infuriating. Then there is the bizarre inventory mechanic where you can't choose what you put into a machine. The game decides for you and it's pretty much always the wrong choice. So you have to wait around for the machine to finish then hope it chooses the correct material next go around.  

Finally the inventory or lack of. The inventory is just for show it lets you know how much of each block you are carrying and that's it. Since it's non-interactive you can't organise it or anything you can usually do with an inventory. The only thing it lets you do is spew blocks everywhere via another hotkey. A number of those blocks will often get lost because of physics bugs. Spewing is the only way to get stuff from your inventory into a storage container. The problem being another container in the vicinity will suck up your block spew. Meaning you need to empty that container then try again. As you imagine can this becomes a real chore, real quick.

OK, it has blocks, crafting, and mining. That's where the similarities end really. 

My daughter plays Minecraft, she plays it for hours. However, whenever I sit down to have a go, I get bored after about 20 minutes. You dig. You build. You dig. zzzz

FortressCraft is much more immediate than that. Your power is running out, you're going to freeze to death, so you need to organise. This forces you to think stategically, about power, about distance, about supply lines (and presumably, in the future, defending them from other players). It kind-of feels more like a RTS, but with blocks.

If you're used to other Mine games, this one IS even more complicated. But part of that is due to a very alpha GUI, things aren't as obvious as they could or should be. This will be fixed! 

for example, bringing up your inventory, you have a bunch of blocks. What are they? no idea, a mouse-over tooltip would be nice :)

Also, I'd rather you only had things in  your toolbar that you actually owned, it's too confusing with *every possible thing* being shown, yet you can't use 90% of it. Again, early access, these things are to be expected.

One thing that is immediately ""wrong"" with the game - shelter. If you build a ""house"" over your base equipment, put a torchfire or two in there, surely it should be warm enough inside that you don't freeze? What's the point of building a ""Fortress"" if it doesn't have any benefits lol :)

I absolutely recommend this, if you're a fan of Voxel miners or even RTS games. I see a bright future for this game, because unlike others, there is actually a game to be played, a point to it all. (you can, of course, go into creative mode and just build pretty stuff, but I kind-of don't see the point of that unless you can then turn the world into a survival one for you and your friends. No doubt that's coming too eventually).

Buy it, try it. If you don't get on with it, try it again the next update. and the next. It's going to be a good one :)",1398843262,1398843262,True,99,0,0.700628280639648438,9,True,False,True,False,,,

Original review:

Survival game is essentially unplayable in it's current state. Multiple menus don't work, large ""under construction"" images appear in critical places, like say THE INVENTORY. You have to stand exactly 2.5 blocks away from torches or you die. To place a dirt block you have to first find it in a list of 150 items. Critical functions are hidden in multi key commands . Want to progress at all? Better hit alt-M to locate minerals, had to dig that one out of an online guide, along with everything else because the game options menu doesn't even work enough to look at the controls.

It's an early access game. I get that. What I'm saying may not apply in a few months, but for now, version 1.8, that survivial trailer on the steam page is misleading at best, an outright fabrication at worst.

This game is bloody awful, a huge step down from the predecessor FortressCraft.
This abomonation feels like a bad minecraft mod, with cheesy, overdone 3d models that look lazily done, and not to mention the gameplay is elastic and horrible.  
The old FortressCraft was beautiful, your only limit was your imagination, but on this? the limit is you might not have a super powerful computer, WITH THESE GRAPHICS, THAT SHOULD NOT BE NEEDED. OPTIMIZED MY ASS. NOT TO MENTION THE GRAPHICS, EVEN THOUGH REQUIRING SO MUCH, MANAGE TO LOOK UGLY AS FUCK. This game blew up my last Power supply, so maybe look into that.
This game has an awful interface, confusing and downright stupid controls, and no point of purchase. 
I can NOT express my hatred of this game through words, they have taken an amazing game and DESTROYED it. 
If you like shitty games that feel like chinese knockoffs of already mainstream games, hell, give this a go.
But if you're like me and want your MONEY'S WORTH, DO NOT BUY THIS. 
Though there is SOME gameplay that doesnt make me want to gouge my eyes out with the rusty anus of a thousand demons, it is not worth the money. i feel pain for anyone else that has payed SHIT for this abomination.

(PS. the reason it's so different is because of death threats from minecraft fanboys, that projectorgames took seriously. yeah.)

2 years later I am playing again and just have to change my review.

This is now a really good game. You harvest, you have technoglogy and there is so much to do, I have yet no idea what IS the endgame. 
The settings for survival make it so, that you really can play 10 hours and are just starting to play this game.

You gather resources to get more resources, that is still true. But now you get so much info in game, you really don't need a wiki or forum for a long time.
You get a super cool elevator, so you don't have to walk all the way up and down.
Everything is simple to use but but you have to think about it how to use it best.

The game is just pure fun.

I was always looking for a Tekkit-Lite (MineCraft mod with technology) alternative. This might just be it.

I love it, that the destroying of blocks is so easy, that the building is so easy, that you have no ""realistic"" ground where you always fight to get it nice looking. Here you work with cubes in MineCraft size, the difference is, everything is fast and looks good and there is so much to do.

What I saw and what makes me wanne play a lot more but I  don't have the resources for it yet:
- Defense turrets
- Spiders
- Threat scanner
- Power storage
- [...] (I have researched not much yet)

And this is just the beginning. This game is now so good.
If you like MineCraft-like games, then this is a must have.

Really, this is not anymore a nice-to-have, this is a must have!

old: version 1.80d
[b]Mine to be able to mine more[/b]

FortressCraft Evolved is a nice game.
I did for sure not see everything about it, but I tried survival, did many things the wrong way,
got LOTS of help in the forum (1 troll, but lots of nice helpful guys) and had lots of fun and frustation.

I have to say, the frustration came from me reading the guide, which is a kind of tutorial, wrongly.
I was just to stupid to understand the guide correctly.
Nevertheless, that WAS my experience and it WAS frustrating.

You are in a cold environment and your armor can only keep you a living being if you give it energy.
That is easy enough, because you have a starting base.

Then you start to gather ores to smelt them into ingots to create thingies which help you to gather more ore.
That is it, it seems, for now.

In the internal version (like betas for other games, via Properties-beta) you can get a newer, perhaps less stable version of the game with more features and bug fixes and new bugs.

Perhaps the game has a target, perhaps you can have lots of fun, but I did not come to that point.

This is an alpha version.
And it is currently already fun to play.
Building is REALLY fun!

The game is easy to play, you can have some fun.
I really hope for it to get ""faster"" or just telling a new user like me better, why he should bother to gather more ores to be able to create machine which allow him to gather more ores.

But currently it is just not enough to keep me playing.
I will for sure start it from time to time, because it is even in the alpha state fun to play it a bit.
But it is for me no 24/7 game. By far not.

If you are bored with your current open world building, mining, crafting game, give this one a try.

De nombreuses idées très intéressantes en terme de Gameplay, un Super Build mode qui permet de gagner un temps fou (à l'instar de Starmade) et qui nous permet de réaliser ronds, cylindres et autres avec une précision et une rapidité étonnante. Un pistolet de peinture qui permet de peindre une face d'un cube seulement et un baton qui permet d'invoquer météores, orage, neige, faire passer les jours et les nuits et qui me rappelle vaguement Age of Mythology et son cheat code... 

En termes graphique/esthétique, le jeu se veut aussi être ""évolué"", une excellente distance d'affichage, une très bonne fluidité, des décors qui se charge avec une certaine élégance et des shaders vanilla que votre ordinateur supporte sans sourciller. Même au point de vue texture ce n'est pas trop laid. On ne peut pas parler ""d'empreinte esthétique"" mais ça ne pique pas les yeux.

L'équipe de Dev', à ce que j'ai compris, est composé de DJ (le lead dev') et une à deux personnes maximum pour l'accompagner. Ils m'ont l'air d'être des gens très dynamiques et à l'écoute de leur communauté.

Points négatifs:

Bien sûr on ne peut s'empêcher d'opposer tout ceci à Minecraft et de se dire: ""voilà un adversaire sérieux pour Mojang"". Etant fan de Minecraft, jeux voxels indés en tout genre, je dois admettre qu'il se pourrait que ce jeu devienne un excellent concurrent. Cependant on en est encore loin! Qui dit early-access dit peu de contenu à se mettre sous la dent. Du peu que j'en ai vu en créatif il n'y a qu'un seul biome: une plaine avec quelques arbres. Je n'ai pas essayé le mode survie donc je n'en parlerai pas... 

Enfin, là où la comparaison avec Minecraft peut s'avérer inutile c'est que oui, on a un excellent mode de construction, oui on a un pistolet qui permet de peindre, mais honnêtement, qu'est-ce qui le différencie tant que ça de Minecraft? Demain Mojang peut se dire ""on va ajouter un système pour peindre séparemment les faces d'un cube"" et ce sera fait. Ce que j'apprécie dans Starmade par exemple ou Cubeworld c'est que Starmade vous propose d'aller dans l'espace, Cubeworld est un jeu voxel mais qui refuse (pour l'instant?) l'interaction avec son univers et la construction cube par cube pour s'orienter vers un aspect aventure/RPG oldschool beaucoup plus prononcé. Pour l'instant FortressCraft m'a montré de très bons éléments qui peuvent donner un solide coup de fouet à Mojang mais rien qui ne les différencie et pas encore de plu-value réelle.

Je terminerai en disant que si vous souhaitez ""investir"" dans un early-access de type Sandbox/Voxel vous pouvez ""parier"" sur FortressCraft. L'équipe Dev' me semble très dynamique et créative il n'y a pas de raisons pour que cela ne devienne pas un bon jeu. Mais il me semble qu'un Starmade ou même Starbound me semble être une voie plus sûre si vous ne l'avez pas déjà empruntée. Je ne vous recommanderai pas Cubeworld pour cette simple raison: le lead dev' fait du bon travail mais ne sait visiblement pas donner de ses nouvelles même sur Twitter...

Sure it has some bugs and glitches but it is barely done! I want to go over the glitches and bugs before I get to the best parts first just in case someone wants to find out what the issues may be in the game. 

The glitches are quite bad sometimes and can seriously affect the gameplay, the glitches come at random moments, usually when you least expect it. We have the problem with not being in control any more, this happens a lot, it causes your player to just fly up into the sky when you press space bar, this can also make it impossible to float back down and usually I just turn the game off after that. We also have the copy and paste option, sometimes it leaves blue and green lights stuck on your walls, sometimes the wall has holes in it where the copy and paste didn't work properly. You've even got a glitch that makes you walk around when you don't want to and you have to just move to a block and wait until the player stops moving, then slowly tap on the 'W' key to make sure he/she doesn't do it again. There is also even on fastest graphics mode it can have a huge drop in frame rates quite rapidly. Don't let this scare you from buying this game.

I think this game is a must have due to its great potential, there aren't a lot of blocks but they are still developing the game and once it is done I am hoping it will have a larger collection of different blocks and materials. It's also a really big world and plenty of worlds for you to make, the copy and paste functions is pure genius and will definantly help to build huge structures! The little robot that follows you is helpful to show what block you currently have and for some reason it looks kind of cute. I'm very serious when I say this game has huge potential! I hope that more people buy this game so they can get more money to develop it better and faster! If you're looking for a game of fun and adventure then this game is for you! If you don't mind the bugs and just get on with it then this is extremely fun, this is my own opinion though so don't take it all to heart. But if anyone wants to join me when they have finished constructing the multiplayer then please feel free to add me. I hope this game gets the recognition it deserves!

At the moment however, it lacks the simple design of its predecessors (i.e. Minecraft?) which left me cursing several times.

It all starts with a rather buggy menu - there is a small camera driven animation which hovers in front of several signs.
...which - unlike any current games - do not light up when the mouse hovers over them.
Getting into a single player mission is even worse because you have to click the empty space in the middle of the screen (no text or anything like that to actually tell you to do so).
When creating a world, the dialogs appear unresponsive. (you click the button - wait for a second or two, click again, ... until you are thrown into the world)

In game there are some nice mechanics, namely the survival against the wild system. (your suit keeps you warm on a frozen planet and if its power is fully depleted, you die after a short time).
But in my opinion, this is one of the biggest flaws at the moment:
There is a brutal world out there, trying to kill you and you have to fight it from the very beginning - without much help or direction from the game.
While several games have recently tried this ""do what you like and see what comes of it!""-approach, this game has you fighting for your life from the very first moment and thereby hinders any attempt at  a shallow start (again, think Minecraft: hacking away at those mud-cubes, only to find out they're almost worthless - but you didn't die from that and could switch over to actually mining something useful)

However, there are too many unexplained phenomenons to actually rush into this game without any knowledge.
After reading a few guides it might start to make sense that you should simply search for coal to power your equipment - but if you've yet to read those guides you might spend the first attempt at survival cursing.
Simply because you start with several fancy technologies in your inventory and can't place them or know what to do with them in the first place.
Then there is the awkward mining process - it feels counterintuitive having to repeatedly press the mouse button to mine. (why can't I keep it pressed like in Minecraft and it simply keeps mining?)

I'd say its got potential once several flaws are fixed.
But at the moment there are simply too little hints to actually get started and enjoy the game without reading several guides.",1392992519,1393433682,False,34,0,0.503139853477478027,15,True,False,True,False,,,

Note: These are my first impressions based off of my first play session

Fortresscraft was first released in 2011, on the Xbox 360 and went on to become one of the most downloaded Xbox Arcade games ever. Fortresscraft Evolved is a complete remake of the original Fortresscraft in the Unity engine and was released on Steam Dec 10, 2013.

A lot of people will go ahead and compare this game to Minecraft and, while it does share some similarities with my all-time favorite game, it is actually quite different, especially in terms of creative building. There is a survival mode in the game, but when I tried to start a new world with it, I was placed in creative mode. No idea why that happened.

The creative mechanics in the game are fantastic. There are many features that make building a lot easier than what you'd probably expect from a game like this (try shift+left clicking with a block in hand). I was even able to whip up a quick tree house in about 30 seconds, and this was no ordinary tree house, it was massive. I really love what the devs did to make creative building as painless as possible.

The game does have some technical issues however, with the game sound being my major complaint. They seemed to lag behind. Oh, and is there supposed to be game music? I heard some at one point, but, other than that, it appears to be nonexistent.

Anyways, the game is fun, if you know what you're doing. The survival mode, however, simply is not as fun as I had expected it to be. Recommended purely for its creative capabilities!",1391117132,1391117497,True,8,0,0.488489627838134766,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Taking advantage of the power of a modern PC with several times more RAM and processing power compared to that of the aging console, FC:E offers a more expansive world than ever before.

The game builds upon its success from the console version by offering the best creative tools available in any vox game including:
Superbuild - An interface to quickly build geometric structures of thousands of blocks to save time for the detail work
Paint gun - Paint select blocks using nearly any color you could dream
Detail blocks - the micro blocks of the XBLIG version have returned with even more flexibility.  Choose from 2x2 - 8x8 blocks in your detail block design to add a finer touch to your world.  The PC version allows a nearly inexhaustible collection so you'll have plenty of options to add more detail to your world.
Copy and paste - Take a unique design and reproduce it to fill in your world with color or simplify a large project by reducing it to a set of duplicable pieces by copying and pasting elements of your world.
Build2me - Excellent for covering roofs, building bridges, or filling in gaps build2me allows you to place an entire line of blocks from your target all the way to your current location.
High graphical fidelity  - Incredible texture resolution, whole array of shaders, and a lighting engine that must be seen to be believed makes an incredible project look that much better.

All of these provide the player with the tools necessary to build beautiful constructions of a scale that until now has been unimaginable in a vox game.  In this regard it is a huge step forward from the console version.  As of the time of writing this review the primary missing feature from the creative toolbox is animating the detail blocks.  This feature has yet to return but remains on the roadmap so expect it to appear before the full release.  I highly recommend checking out some of the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/254200/screenshots/?p=1&browsefilter=toprated]Top rated[/url] screenshots to see some of the incredible things players have built already using the engine.

One of the most desired elements that I had waited on with the console version was the development of a survival oriented game to make the most of the engine.  That time has finally come as the survival mode has seen its public debut and with only a few weeks of development time it already shows promise for an entertaining experience that will last many, many hours.  The player is dropped into a world where the environment itself is hostile.  

The early game has the player battling the cold by sustaining a supply of energy to power his high tech hazard suit to prevent freezing to death by hypothermia.  The suit also appears to be designed for heat, radiation, low oxygen levels, and toxic environments so expect to see a variety of hazards to face from the world itself.  As of the time of writing the cold is the only threat.  Although the suit can be heated up by standing on a torch there is no danger from heat yet.  It will attempt to consume energy to keep you cool however.

The gameplay centers around the idea of your suit energy being your life and that venturing far from your main energy network is a great risk.  You'll spend much of your time developing a network of power distribution to your mining network which is driven by machines called extractors which collect ore from resource nodes albeit at a slow pace.  This process is slower than the player's own mining ability however it is more efficient and automated as long as you sustain the machines with energy.  Later on you gain the ability to make batteries to store power and provide it to your machines, lasers which are used to move power between batteries, a generator for burning coal to produce power, hoppers to collect the resources from the extractors, and robots to move items among the hoppers.  The end result is the complete automation of your mining operations and the ability to generate and move energy around your base of operations to keep everything alive and moving including yourself!

A few other relevant bits about the mode: torches can be placed as a source of light and heat.  They serve as little beacons of safety in the harsh world.  The player is provided with a grappling hook to quickly climb from the depths as the world goes down many light years.  Surival mode currently only utilizes the first several hundred blocks down but will eventually stretch to several thousand meters underground.  The player has a handy ore/cave sensor which consumes a quarter of your suit energy but provides an indicator of the closest ore/cave from the player.  This removes some of the tedium associated with finding resources and just getting about underground.

All of this is only after about a month of development.  There is already a list of planned features to expand upon the mode including suit upgrades such as increased energy storage, greater insulation from the cold, upgrades to the ore sensor to identify specific ore types, and more.  The first mob was added to the game which is a real treat.  The details of which I won't provide here as they are more fun to discover on your own. :)  He isn't much of a threat yet but I'm sure that will change as the tools necessary to combat him are added.  In the current state it takes several hours to proceed through the current tech tree and with additional features promising to fill out the game the survival mode is shaping up to be an incredibly entertaining experience that will be even more fun with friends given the natural scale of the game.

It is now I should probably place a reminder here of the normal warnings of early access games.  This is an early access title so it isn't complete yet.  Among the features still missing that is probably most desirable is multiplayer.  It is on the roadmap and even in development right now.  The devs have the [url=http://www.fortresscraft.com/features/]game roadmap[/url] including multiplayer progress on their website where you can keep track of progress if you don't wish to buy in immediately.  As mentioned above the animations are not available for detail blocks and survival mode is only a month into development.  Other areas that still need work include the menus where many options are still unavailable and do not use a mouse interface yet.  

In the end I guess the question that matters most is: Is it worth it?  If you enjoyed the creative experience offered by the XBLIG version or are looking for a more powerful block builder than you can get with other PC titles then FC:E is already a must buy.  If the survival experience is more what you are after then the answer isn't as clear.  Although the game is progressing very quickly it is still far from complete and there are many features required to fill out the experience.  There is also a lot of bug fixing and optimization needed as so much is being thrown into the game so quickly.  If you absolutely must have the end result then it is worth buying now at the introductory rate which is said to be 40% of the final price and will increase with each major milestone.  If you still are unsure then be sure to check out the forums regularly as new patches are released multiple times a week with fixes and new content.  At the rate the game is currently moving it will be making a big name for itself in voxel gaming this year.",1389675763,1390243804,True,47,0,0.531499028205871582,3,True,False,True,False,,,

Despite its shortcomings this game has a lot of potential to be serious competition for Minecraft, which up until now has had no real competition on the PC side.

There are things that need to be fixed. You still get the Creative Mode item list in Survival Mode, making it hard to determine which blocks you have available, and you cannot use the mouse in your inventory screen. In fact, you can't use the mouse in any of the interfaces for the game except for the ESC button menu while in-game. This needs to be addressed, especially for this PC port of the game.

Should I start with the amazing superbuild tool or the awesome weather staff?  I don't know.  I guess I'll start with the pros.  Two of the biggest advantages of FortressCraft (gonna call it fc from now on) are the superbuild tool and the copy/paste tool.  I find both of these EXTREMELY useful.  I can cut the time in half by just holding down ctrl + m1/m2, whereas in a game like Minecraft (I'm probably going to compare/contrast fc to Minecraft a lot in this review) it takes much time, patience, and effort to build things on a large scale.  Also, the way that the terrain spawns is pretty cool.  It moves in to take position instead of just appearing like in Minecraft.  Next, the list of blocks to choose from, in my opinion, is WAY bigger than that of Minecraft.  Configurable Lights, Ore Extractors, heck, even a huge laser gun!  Now before I start getting a lot of nasty comments on this review let me make one thing clear:  I do NOT hate Minecraft.  I actually like it. In some cases, I prefer it over fc, but remember:  this is the pros section. Okay, where was I?  Oh yes, the large library of blocks to choose from.  Ok, so moving on.  I also particularly like the lighting of the certain blocks that produce it.  I also like that the blocks to choose from are mostly sci-fi themed, whereas Minecraft has more of a 'survival' themed list.  Alright, I think that covers the pros!  Now to the cons.  Fc is probably one of the buggiest games that I've ever played.  Now, hold you horses!  This is an EARLY ACCESS game.  You would be a fool to think that an early access game wouldn't be buggy.  I'm sure that all of the glitches/bugs will be gone in time.  Also, after you fly around for a while and you land, your sight radius dramatically shrinks.  Sometimes, I can only see about 10 blocks in front of me, and that's it until I restart.  Again, early access game.  It will get fixed in due time as with the efficiency of the servers.  One last thing:  I know that it's being built/programmed as I type this review, but as of this moment, fc is ENTIRELY single player.  PLEASE don't leave comments about how it's being made right now.  I'm just saying that if you're planning to buy it right now then be prepared to play ALONE.  Obviously, the pros outmatch the cons by a landslide, so I give this game a 2 thumbs up!

If  you are a creative person and enjoy building, then in this game even at pre-alpha you can build anything you can think of, your imagination is your only limitation, if you have the patience to learn how to use the tools in this gaame to create whatever your imagination inspires then you will love it.     

You may like to check out the many screenshots and guides in the community hub

One of the main features i love about Fortresscraft are the creative tools we are given to make our creations.

....for example...

""the workshop"" 
a  plaace you can build and save your own custom detail blocks to then use to build your own creations, best of all you can create well in excess of 1,000 of them if you so wanted to.

""superbuild mode""
instantly create small or huge square areas of blocks, do the same for a cylinder shape, and also create Spheres, either sit back in amazement and watch as they build in front of you or go and build something else while they are being built for you.

""copy & paste and schematics""
wow........just...wow ....select something you have built like a house or in my case a Robot made with 50+ custom detail blocks, then copy it, then paste it somewhere else or save it as a schematic then go to your schematics at any time and select it and paste it whenever you want to. You can eeven rotate the whole thing before you paste it.... amazing

""lighting""
configurable lighting at that!!!! configure the colour strength and distance and even shadow type, individually for every single light you place.

I could go on and on but then if you are liking whats mentioned above then you are most likely going to enjoy the game and enjoy exploring everything else out once you start playing it and creating anything you can think up.

I hope this review is of help to you. For other info check the Community hub guides and screenshots, and if you purchase the game then i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been.",1387189271,1387191241,True,112,0,0.621151149272918701,46,False,False,True,False,,,
