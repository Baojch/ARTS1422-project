Que dire sur ce FF11, car c'est un chantier important. Je crois que le mot qui le résume le mieux c'est AUSTÈRE. Je m'explique. FF11 est ancien, très ancien. Il faut rappeler qu'il est sortit avant WoW. Et WoW, malgré ses défauts, a apporté beaucoup BEAUCOUP en terme de standards pour les MMO. Des innovations de qualité de vie, des choses qui nous paraissent logique et naturelles aujourd’hui, car tous les MMO sont construits comme ça. Et bien mon cher padawan, il faut désapprendre tout ce que tu as appris... Car FF11... c'est un autre monde... c'est un de ces MMO où on te lache sans rien t'indiquer et ou TU NE PEUX PAS progresser seul. C'est impossible. Le jeu est compliqué, tortueux, abscon, fastidieux. 

Ma grande chance ce fut de tomber sur un japonais avec qui j'ai sympathisé trés vite et qui m'a guider à travers mon voyage. Je te remercie Eisaburough, sans toi mon expérience du jeu aurait été bien différente.

Alors quoi, le gameplay est archaïque, les graphismes sont éculés, le jeu est une purge à avancer dans les quêtes... mais alors pourquoi diable le recommande-je ? Aurais-je perdu l'esprit, hmmm ? Et bien non, en vérité, il y'a un point, un seul point, qui rattrape tous les défauts archaïques du jeu et c'est l'histoire. l'histoire de ce jeu est exceptionnelle.

Combien de MMO auquels j'ai joué avaient des histoires tellement plates et fades que cela ne m'a pas du tout marqué...? Et c'est là ou on en reviens aux points qui font d'un jeu un bon jeu. Ils peuvent exceller sur certains aspects et pas d'autres. Concernant les MMO, je n'en ai vu aucun exceller partout. Mais certains sont sur mon podium, car ils excellent dans des domaines bien précis. SWTOR c'est sur l'aspect RPG avec des choix de dialogue et d'alignement, ainsi que sur l'histoire (parce que coté graphisme et gameplay c'est pas le top). BDO c'est bien sur les graphismes magnifiques (comme Terra) et également le gameplay (pas comme Terra). 

Et FF11 c'est l'histoire. Si bien que... cela fait 3 ans que j'y ai pas joué mais... J'aimerais tellement pouvoir terminer l'histoire de ce jeu... mais la progression est tellement fastidieuse que j'ai du mal à m'y remettre... J'avais du m'arrêter à un moment et maintenant je dois retrouver le courage de m'y remettre, mais je crains que mon ami japonais ne soit plus là pour me soutenir hélas...

Je publie cette éval donc, au cas où je n'ai pas la foi pour terminer (ce qui risque d'être trés probable) et que je le désinstalle.
Pour résumer, un jeu extrêmement AUSTERE et très fastidieux, mais dont le seul point narratif, compense la totalité de ses autres défauts. Mais attention, se lancer dans cette aventure seul est quelque peu rebutant.",1706433427,1706433427,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It might still be worth a look for old-school-MMO fans but everyone else should think twice about attempting a playthrough[/code]

First of, even though this is a non-recommendation review, I want to stress that I got nothing but respect for [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i]. Not many MMOs remain online after 21 (!) years of service and are still getting new content (!!) after all those years. And considering the immense ongoing popularity of [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i]’s younger sibling MMO, [i]Final Fantasy XIV[/i], it’s even more impressive to see this 2002 MMO still being actively supported by publisher Square Enix. Sure, from all the original platforms (PC, PS2, Xbox 360) only the PC version remains online but that’s still an impressive feat. Additionally, I’m very impressed by all players remaining faithful to this game through all this time and I do wish I could’ve been a part of you. Unfortunately, I just couldn’t get into the game.

My troubles with [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i] began even before I got to play the actual game and that’s of course thanks to the needlessly long and complicated registration process others have already described. Using a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=603627745]guide such as this one[/url] does make the whole registration process easier to follow but frankly, if I need a user-made guide to get through the registration process of a game, something went very, very wrong.

After the registration process and long game download, which can only be done through the game’s launcher, I also followed many player recommendations I previously read and [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/w0dx28/how_to_install_the_steam_version_of_final_fantasy/]installed Windower[/url], which can be used to quickly install various player-made addons and plug-ins for the game. Especially the minimap addon I installed proved to be a very welcome addition, significantly enhancing my game experience.

After some technical troubles involving my Xbox One controller and the UI being too small, I could finally start the game. The character creation is quite limited, such as only allowing for a few pre-made faces to be picked from, but that’s expected considering the age of [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i]. A big problem would be the world selection, however, as the game doesn’t offer any information about the player population or server location of its numerous worlds. As such, if you want to pick a more active server, you’ll have to do your research beforehand and without official resources to consult.

The first few in-game minutes of [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i] already show just how much MMOs have evolved since the 2002 release of this game. This isn’t referring to the soundtrack (which is just as great as expected from the franchise) or the graphics (which still hold up reasonably well) but the lack of a tutorial or general directions. After a short introductory cutscene and a few dialogue lines, you’re thrown into the world of Vana’diel with little idea of how things work or what to do next.

Now, there are [url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/intro/about/welcom.html?pageID=about]official resources[/url] as well as an excellent player-made [url=https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Quickstart_1-119_Guide]quickstart guide[/url] to help you out, the latter of which I consider absolutely essential if you want to give [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i] a try. But frankly, I didn’t have much fun constantly having to look up what to do next on my phone instead of the game telling me. And the game doesn’t tell you a lot of really important stuff - I wasn’t even told about the main story quests (“nation quests”) I’m supposed to undertake at the beginning of the game.

This is just one aspect of the general clunkiness that comes with the age of [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i]. The UI experience is far from modern, some settings are obtusely hidden in two (!) configuration tools existing separately from the in-game settings and many aspects are just more obtusely handled than the solutions modern MMOs offer (e.g. inventory management).

Another part of [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i] that’s really showing the age of the game would be its speed – or lack thereof. The few nation missions I undertook during my time with the game all involved a lot – and I mean [b]a LOT[/b] – of simply walking around. Watch a simple cutscene consisting of an NPC saying a few lines (by which I mean they’re posted in the chatlog, there’s no voice acting) and then spend ten minutes making your way to the location you probably had to look up in the fan wiki. Arguments can be made for this slowed-down kind of MMO gameplay, but personally, even I found it to be too slow (and that’s coming from someone who enjoyed the slow passages of [i]Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn[/i]). Even though there’s a teleport system, I felt like I spend way too much time just walking the same passageways for way too little story content.

Then there’s the combat of [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i]. Of course, a proper review of MMO combat can only be made once max level has been reached, so I’m unable to discuss this aspect of the game in detail. I do want to mention one aspect that I found personally annoying, especially for new players: there’s no easy way to tell the levels of enemies in your way. There’s an option to manually “/check” them and the game tells you about their level in a roundabout way (e.g. “This enemy could prove to be a decent challenge”) - which is just not helpful unless you [url=https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Check]look up the meaning[/url] of these “/check” statements. 

After a few hours of the game, which mainly consisted of resolving technical problems, looking up my next moves on the wiki and walking between NPCs for very little story content, I was unfortunately too bored to continue with the game. It’s a slow burn and the lack of many modern MMO conveniences is quite noticeable – at least for someone like me who spent more than 1000h playing the more modern [i]Final Fantasy XIV[/i].

I could feel that [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i] has much more to offer but as far as my experience goes, it takes either a deeply devoted player or a lot of love for old-school MMOs in order to start and have a lot of fun with [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i] in 2023. There’s a reason why [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i] remains online after 21 years after all. But getting into the game at this point is no easy task, even if you’re a big fan of the [i]Final Fantasy[/i] franchise like me. It’s not impossible but it requires a lot of time and reading-up on things, apart from a high tolerance (or love) for the characteristics of an MMO from 2002. So if you’re not sure if this description fits you, consider the fact that [i]Final Fantasy XI[/i] also requires a monthly subscription. Buying the Steam version comes with a “free” 30 days subscription, but after that you’ll have to pay a fee in order to continue playing. That said, there’s a [url=https://www.finalfantasyxi.com/na/?utm_source=playonline&utm_medium=top_upper-newbtn]free 14 day trial[/url] on offer at the Square Enix website, so if you’re still on the fence, you can take a look without paying a dime.",1684951950,1684951950,False,14,0,0.666003108024597168,6,True,False,False,True,,,

Игра не для всех, русских в игре практически нет. Я играю, давайте дружить: Mosya с сервера Asura. Здесь я на русском пишу новости игры: vk.com/finalfantasyxi

Очень сложно писать обзор «живой» MMO 18-летней (на момент написания обзора) давности. Серия Final Fantasy культовая и никогда не боялась смелых экспериментов. Один из самых смелых экспериментов, разумеется, был перенос номерной части в онлайн. Это первая кроссплей-игра, за что игра и попала в книгу рекордов Гиннеса. MMO (тем более консольные, ведь изначальный релиз FF XI был на PS2) 2002 года (т.е. pre-WoW эпохи) не отличались удобностью и практически никто не дожил до наших дней. FF XI смогла, потому что другой такой игры просто нет. Она не пыталась косить под популярные западные игры и всегда с боем прокладывала свой путь, по которому потом следовали игроки, периодически спотыкаясь о неудачные решения. Но именно её самобытность и непохожесть на других и приманивает людей. А потом  не отпускает.

Да, есть FF XIV, но будем честны, это еще одна WoW. Супер крутая, стильная, затягивающая, но это другая игра в сравнении с XI. FF XI делает ставки на другие вещи в эндгейме, поэтому здесь нет привычных зачисток данжей ради шмоток и рейдов в том виде, в котором мы их все привыкли видеть. Игра, разумеется, менялась с годами, но сейчас нет смысла мусолить прошлое, кому-то нравилось больше, кому-то меньше, важно сейчас то, что разработчик может нам предложить. За 18 (на самом деле чуть меньше, т.к. активная разработка прекратилась и сейчас выходят небольшие обновления) лет в игре накопилось масса сюжетного контента, а для эндгейма и того больше. В игре есть чем заняться, разве что любители PvP останутся не у дел. Но, повторюсь, игра много где устарела и с этим нужно мириться, тем более за 13 евро в месяц. 

С точки зрения социальной составляющей здесь всё очень хорошо: сервера не делятся по странам и регионам, есть только условности, что на Phoenix обитали русские игроки, а на Odin преимущественно японцы. Самый популярный сервер сейчас Asura, там я и обитаю. Отношение к новичкам ввиду необычности в такой игре появление новичка хорошее: менторы (да и не только они) всему вас обучат, подскажут, где что делать и всегда будут доступны для совета и подсказок. Для сюжетных приключений больше не нужно искать сопартийцев, система призыва NPC-компаньонов прекрасно решает эту проблему.

Технически стим-версия клиента игры была апдейтнута и больше нет проблемы, когда нужно 8 часов обновлять игру после установки. Теперь потребуется от 10 минут до 40, что не так уж и страшно. Страшно другое: костыльность столь сложной по архитектуре игры не могло не вести за собой технические неудобства: все еще может возникнуть путаница с аккаунтами (хотя это сильно упрощено) и невозможностью нормально запускать игру через сам Steam. Более того, вам с огромной вероятностью захочется модить игру хотя бы для того, чтобы вас не выбрасывало из игры, когда вы её сворачиваете.

Короче, у нас весело, давайте к нам.

I'm new, Linkshell, Can I have it?' "" > Enter,
You will most likely need a linkshell, unless you're overly stubborn on doing most things solo. The XI game prided(prides?) itself on being teamwork oriented, so a linkshell is highly recommended, if only so you can get pointers on how to get started.

Also yes even if I chose negative review, It's still worth buying for the music alone. There's something to being in the zone, versus finding the track on youtube.

--Review starts--
If there was a ""Neutral"" button, I would press that one.

I did set it on negative, because a new player today would likely be disoriented, and thrown into a massive environment with no pointers. A new player without friends also joining in, will have a lacking experience in comparison to when the game was in its prime (Original installment to early WOTG, people will find different times to be defined as ""prime"". But most I've talked to agree that Abyssea was a complete bust and ruined the game).

Adoulin, Rhapsodies and the new story that is currently being added, did steer people away from Abyssea, so it seems like FFXI is throwing on a few band-aids, and is recovering sliightly from the fall, although the game is overly casual-friendly now. Depending on the kind of player you are, there is a lot to do; Level to 30 (White Mage recommended), get the spells if you went a mage job, if solo, get ""Trusts"", get other jobs and check them out, find your favourite.
--Level to 99, get the best i119 armour for your job, learn your job, make the best macros,
become a crafter, instance-runner, Mog Garden Caretaker, Raise a Chocobo, Do quests, some have fun stories, learn the market, get the end-game abilities and weapons. and it is a MMO that has no microtransactions, due to being old. That is, unless you count the game being subscription based.

So the gaming aspect of the game, can be lacking, especially for older players that want to experience hours of grinding exp in teams where 90% of the grind is just socializing. There is content for those that have reached 99 with decent gear, instance-runs, instance boss fights, Reisenjima & Escha bosses, it can be done, it is just a rarer sight. (Or I could be in all the wrong places, not to mention server.)

The social aspect, is still largerly important if you want the fullest experience currently available of the game.
Thanks to the increased EXP gain, how some/most instanced fights in stories are no longer level-sync'd, and how easy the game is, it can feel like you're cheating. 

I feel like you can at least to some degree feel the difficulties some of the fights used to have, with the battlefields that become available to you through the purchase of merit points, and walk of echoes instances, as some of these battlefields are harder difficulties of Summoner Prime Avatar fights, or the Ark Angels, and other story-driven battlefields.

So would I recommend it today?
To a new player? I do not know. It would really depend on the player. If aforementioned ^ appeals to you, then go right on ahead. If not, I hope you find a game that give you as good a time as XI gave me back in the day. XI is HOME. It's nostalgia, it's where we grew up and developed ourselves as people. It's where we found many friends.
But I can not say with certainty that the current XI would give a new player that satisfaction. A returning player however? Yes, give it a shot. At least when the game is on a sale. The casual grind and easy mode may be a turn-off, but the new content makes it feel refreshing in its own way, the XI of today is a game that took inspiration from old XI's storytelling.

Keep in mind that this game is old (15 year), so some aspect of the gameplay are very different from the newest games, but you won't be disappointed by the story, the quests, the Endgame.

I have no idea why would you get this game on steam and heres why:
1) This game costs money on steam when it is actually free to try first month if you download launcher from square enix's website. So, it means that when you buy this game here you don't actually pay for your first month you just pay for the download lol. You will still have to get a trial subscription and  pay for your first month afterwords.

2) Horrible integration with steam. Developers didn't even bother to display Final Fantasy XI's image in your recent games. It feels like you are playing a non-steam/pirated version. WTF?!

3) The only reasonable option to play this game is by using windower.net because it allows you to run the game fullscreen borderless and also have a bunch of plugins. You can't alt+tab in FFXI without windower. Well, steam doesn't support windower. When you start your FFXI from windower steam won't display that you are ""in game"". 

4) There's just no benifits in using steam version over launcher because it's not really connected with steam in anyway.

5) If you didn't start your steam as admin steam will not count your total playtime.

Well, I managed to get screenshots to work as well as steam community. All you do is you start your steam as admin and then you play in FFXI.

However, it's still impossible to play with plugin using steam version. Really disapointed with this steam integration. Why it's not free-to-pay?

Final Fantasy XI is not recommended. [/h1]   (Review in german and english --> down below)

Ich habs 3x probiert.
2007 (PC), 2013/2014 (XBOX360) und im Januar 2018 (PC).

[b] Aber warum eigentlich? [/b]
Fangen wir an bei der Installation.
Den Client bzw das Grundprogramm zu installieren ist kein Hexenwerk.
Selbst Steam nutzt nur den Client zum Starten des ""PlayOnline-Launchers"", mit dem ein nervenaufreibenes Szenario beginnt.

Wenn man es geschafft hat sich durch den Irrweg durch PlayOnline-ID 
+ Passwort & SquareID + Passwort zu manövrieren,
beginnt die Patchphase. 

Nichts ungewöhnliches das ein MMO die installierten Dateien durchsucht aktuelle drüberpatcht.
Nun wäre es einfach wenn der Launcher ""normal"" patchen würde wie es jedes andere Spiel tut.
Das Spiel ist aktuell 13,5 GB groß und hat 61.591 Dateien und nahezu [b] JEDE EINZELNE DATEI WIRD EINZELN GEPATCHT [/b] , was durchschnittlich [b] ca 8h dauern kann [/b] .

Bricht der Patch ab (evtl weil die Internetverbindung sich neu lädt) , darf man neu beginnen.

[b] Endlich sind wir fertig mit patchen, lasst uns spielen [/b]

Charaktererstellung, Klassenauswahl ... passt. Etwas spartanisch, aber ausreichend.
Die Grafik ist auch OK. Obere PS2-Qualität in HD. Völlig in Ordnung.
Beim Einstieg wird man wie in neueren MMO's  nicht unbedingt ""an die Hand genommen"".
Selbstständigkeit ist gefragt. Reden mit NPC's um Infos über das aktuelle Quest-/ Weltgeschehen zu erfahren.

Da das Spiel 2002 erschien, darf man nicht erwarten das Quests über den Köpfen der Figuren angezeigt wird.
Mittlerweile ging man auch auf den heutigen Standard zu und hat für viele Dinge Bonus-XP eingeführt (10 Gegner da, 30 Level hier .. .usw usw).
Soweit komm ich damit klar.

Das Gameplay ist sehr langatmich.
Quests sind nur eine Entschuldigung für ""du darst erst rein wenn du mir XY bringst"".
Wo das dann ist.....naja ... man sucht selber...beliest sich ... erringt Zugänge für andere Orte.

Einfacher wäre es wenn man wie woanders auch einfach ALT-TAB bzw vom Vollbild in den Fenstermodus wechseln könnte.
Nein, gibts nicht. Tut man das...ist man sofort ausgeloggt. Früher gab es sogar ein inoffizielles Tool für den Fenstermodus, jedoch waren/sind die Entwickler sehr empfindlich in puncto Fremdtools und bannten in der Vergangenheit auch schnell.

[b] Was mache ich hier eigentlich?  [/b]

Bevor man auch nur annähernd was erreichen kann heisst es GRINDEN GRINDEN GRINDEN.
Denn Erfahrungspunkte gibts ausschließlich durch Kills (und mittlerweile die oben erwähnten Errungenschaften).
Trotzdem, man hat endlos lange Laufwege und Gegner verfolgen dich durch das komplette Gebiet wenn sie dich mal gesehen haben. Eine Flucht ist nicht möglich...und wenn man stirbt, belebt man sich am letzten Homepoint den man gesetzt hat. Wenn man Pech hat läuft man wieder endlos.

Passende Ausrüstung ist auch Mangelware, das Auktionhaus ist sehr ünübersichtlich und bevor man Level 50/60 ist, ist darin kaum was zu finden.

Die Geschichten sind interessant, jedoch ist es ein Krampf zu dem Punkt zu kommen an dem man wirklich Spaß haben könnte wie in anderen Spielen.

Zudem hat das Spiel zusätzlich zum Anschaffungspreis immer noch monatliche Gebüren.
In der heutigen Zeit rechtfertigen nur wenige alte Spiele eine Abogebür und bei diesem könnte man davon absehen.

[b] Spielt Final Fantasy XIV wenn ihr ein Final Fantasy online spielen wollt.
Das macht auch mehr Spaß. [/b]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried it 3 times.
2007 (PC), 2013/2014 (XBOX360) and January 2018 (PC).

[b] But why? [/b]
Let's start with the installation.
Installing the client or the basic program is not rocket science.
Even Steam uses only the client to start the ""PlayOnline Launcher"", which starts a nerve-racking scenario.

If you've managed to maneuver your way through PlayOnline ID + Password & SquareID + Password, begins the patch phase. 
Nothing unusual that an MMO scans the installed files.
Now it would be easy if the launcher patched ""normally"" like any other game does.
The game is currently 13.5 GB in size and has 61,591 files and almost EVERY SINGLE FILE HAS BEEN PATCHED, which can take on average about 8 hours.

If it cancels, it starts over.

[b] Finally we are done with patching, let's play [/b]

Character creation, class selection ... fits. 
The graphics are OK too. Upper PS2 quality in HD. Absolutely okay.
When you get started, you will not necessarily be ""taken by the hand"" as in newer MMOs.
Self-employment is required. Talk to NPC's for info about the current quest / world events.

Since the game was released in 2002, your should not expect quests to appear above the heads of the characters.
Meanwhile, they also went to the current standard and has introduced for many things bonus XP (10 opponents there, 30 levels here ...,so on).
So far, so good.

The gameplay is very slow.
Quests are just an excuse for ""you'll only be clean if you bring me object XY"".
Then you search ..... well ... you read something here and there  ... gets accesses to other places.

It would be simpler if you could change as elsewhere ALT-TAB or even from full screen to windowed mode.
No, there's not. If you do that ... you are immediately logged out. In the past, there was even an unofficial windowing tool, but the developers were very sensitive about third-party tools and banned some players.

[b] What am I doing here? [/b]

Before you can even reach anything you must grind.
You only get experience by killing monsters (and now the achievements mentioned above).
Still, you have endless ways and enemies follow you through the entire area when they see you. An escape is not possible ... and when you die, you revived at the last homepoint you have set. 
If you are unlucky, you run endless again.

Matching equipment is also in short supply, the auction house is very unclear and before you reach level 50/60, there is hardly anything in it.

The stories are interesting, but it's a mess to get to the point where you could really have fun like in other games.

In addition, the game still has monthly fees in addition to the purchase price.
At the present time, only a few old games justify a subscription fee.

That's also more fun. [/b]",1516891260,1516905365,False,11,5,0.466707080602645874,0,True,False,False,False,,,

XI gives you a set of coordinates and a pat on the bum. Best pray you've bought the map for the right area, and you don't aggro some random mob 20 levels above you on the way.

There are various quests and storylines throughout the world and there are also familiar characters from the rest of the series that reappear in FFXI with their own role in the storyline.",1487049155,1673859298,True,14,4,0.351907849311828613,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game was early critisized for being too hardcore which is was, the party of 6 to level up was truly awesome, but that has been replaced by an easier leveling system, but they have kept the endgame for hardcore people, although mainly its through shouts not linkshells. 
There are regular updates too the content every month to keep us going, but seriously look at my gametime and i'm still scratching the surface with what i have achieved.

[h1] After all these years it’s still alive and hasn’t aged a day… [/h1]

When World of Warcraft launched in 2004, there was a huge MMO craze. Everyone wanted a piece of the action in this exciting online genera where players would pay a monthly fee (or buy in game goodies). Most of the MMORPGs that came during that time are now either dead (shut down) or have adapted to today’s standards (gone free-to-play, changed entirely, etc.) Not Final Fantasy XI…

[h1] WAAAAY ahead of its time [/h1]

Final Fantasy XI actually came out BEFORE World of Warcraft and had a lot of unique things about it. It was one of the first games ever to support actual cross-play between consoles and PC. It has a unique character system where a single character can level up all available classes and subclasses making it less important to play multiple characters (toons). The battle system is very much turn based like in earlier Final Fantasy https://store.steampowered.com/app/359870/FINAL_FANTASY_XX2_HD_Remaster/ games but actually works well. It’s a bit slow, sure, but it’s very much functional and playable. It still has some of the best music I have ever heard in any MMORPG to date. I just can’t get enough of the various marching themes and the calming tracks when play in forests and deserts. Well enough praise,… allow me to bury this game.

 [h1] Installing this game and setting up my account took longer than I would have liked [/h1]

After you install the game, you will have access to an ancient launcher with a sweet piano score. The launcher will have to update the game and it will be really slow. Whatever, time to create an account, but how do we do that? Once you figure out on which website you actually have to go in order to create an account, you get another challenge: figuring out how to actually navigate around it. Not only do you need to set up a subscription for accessing the game but also for each character you have. Why? Not only is this greedy but it’s mostly pointless. Since a single character can play any single class in the game and you are able to change them whenever you want the only real benefit to having multiple characters is to have a bank character. I suppose you are ready to play now, aren’t you? Nope, you have to navigate around that website and located a single account code that you need to copy and paste into that ancient launcher. At this point you might be thinking: “Well, surely this is explained somewhere, isn’t it?” I mean, sure, it is, if you dig deep enough online you might just find it, I couldn’t. I just copied and pasted random codes around my account until I found the right one. Finally, we can log in and play.

[h1] From the moment you first log in with your character, the problems start popping up [/h1]

Oh, dear GOD! I don’t even know where to begin. First of all, if you want to play this game, just put your mouse away, in fact, go ahead and put your keyboard away too. This is a game that gained its popularity on the Playstation 2 and it REALLY shows. The menus are made to be controller-friendly, I guess, and even though you can use the mouse, it’s such a nightmare that you might as well just not use it at all, unless you plan to heavily mod the game, and I’m not even sure you can do that anymore. Even with a controller, the menus are confusing to say the least. So many things to select do and tweak and most of them seem pointless, unnecessary or just too inconvenient. Just talking to an NPC is a nightmare as you have to select it, choose the option to talk and only then, will you be able to actually talk. 

[h1] Just give me my quests, so I can be on my way [/h1]

Even though World of Warcraft is a 16 year old game, playing it is very easy. After setting up your account it’s really easy and intuitive to get started. You just make a character, pick a quest, kill some mobs, turn in quests and repeat. It’s an old formula that works well and has been improved quite a bit to fit the needs of a modern gamer (it’s faster, less tedious, easier, etc.). Oh but not Final Fnatasy XI, oh no, no, no. Figuring out ANYTHING in this game is a challenge. Where are the quest? Where is an important NPC? Where do I even exit this town? Where do I buy new gear? How do I use these points? Am I able to actually hire NPC bodyguards? Who do I talk to about that? None of these things are explained in the game and discovering them by yourself will take you a long time. So, what do you do? You go online and look for answers yourself. 

[h1] For years, nobody was even able to tell me how to play this game! [/h1]

For some reason, nobody even wanted to tell me how to play the game. When I searched online, all I could find was videos of people bragging or just basic information about status effects or what each item does. Nobody actually told me how to progress, until one day I found a step-by-step guide to 99 by Aysha. This was back in 2017 I think and this guide covered everything from creating your character to starting your quests to leveling, just everything. Props to the author Aysha for that but it just showed how desperately this game needs an update. The guide basically explained things I never even knew were in the game. I learned very early that because of the lack of players, I was able to summon NPC party members, teleport almost wherever, to not buy items from shops but by using another currency. The guide basically did what the game should have done in the first place: teach me how to play the damn game. 

[h1] An MMORPG that doesn’t want to be played and refuses to change anything about itself [/h1]

Final Fantasy XI used to be available on PS2, Xbox 360 and PC. Now, it’s only available on PC. The only people who seem to be playing this game are the veterans and I’m guessing they are all stuck in some endgame town somewhere. I say this because I haven’t encountered anyone playing this game and I pretty much have a good idea why that is the case. Simply put, this game doesn’t want to be played anymore. There are about a million things that could have been done to improve everything about this game and none of them were done. The game could have implemented a new payment model but it still has a subscription that’s extremely expensive for what you get. The tutorials for new players are non-existent and even when looking them up online can be confusing.  Sometimes, the game has these free-login-campaigns where you get to log in for free but even then the game is so barren and unfriendly for new players.


[h1] It’s still alive, I guess. It’s just a shell of what it used to be. [/h1]

Look, if you are someone who plays this game regularly, good for you, in fact, I envy you because chances are you have been playing it for a long time and have seen this game at its prime, and that is exactly my problem. This game is only good for people who have been playing it for years and extremely unfriendly to anyone else. Once the veterans leave, there won’t be anyone else to play this game and it will just die, a sad lonely death. Why did Square give up on this game? Why are people coming and going to Final Fantasy XIV https://store.steampowered.com/app/39210/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Online/ but not to Final Fantasy XI if it’s still up and running and even has a mandatory subscription? It’s a sad world we live in. It may have update graphics and it may run on modern systems, but this is a game very much stuck in the past and is only being kept alive by its veteran players and if things don’t change, it won’t be around for much longer.

Next game:
Final Fantasy XIV

You may moan ""why has this game still got a sub?"" The way YOU SHOULD see this is...""The game has been running successfully for 11 years, it has no need to shut it's sub down because IT WORKS.""

I spent many nights playing with the NA community as well as the JP community early morning, the auto translate function is one of the best things I have seen in an MMO and I am glad they carried that over to FFXIV;ARR. With new content came new areas, challenges, beasts and classes. I still think to this day with all the mmo's I have played, this one has had the best line up of class variety.

Yes ok, it is based on the Asian mmo tradition of xp party grinding, no xp from quests, a death penalty (we've all had that problem..ding..mob pull..death...de-level). You moan this game sucks, it's too hard..I suggest the game isn't designed to be easy, to hand you tier gear earned from doing a few dungeon runs, no. This game either makes or breaks you.

SqEnix always bring great lore and story to their games, and FFXI is no different. I have noted changes since returning for example, it feels more soloable in areas, though it seems Red Mages have been replaced so for this RDM I will continue to dabble every now and then and look forward to more new content they bring to the game.",1388780209,1430589664,True,17,0,0.557583153247833252,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As I'm seeing lots of unfavourable reviews, I start with a few warnings:

[b]Initial Account registation is confusing[/b], you have to make three, one square enix, one play online (using your CD Key ) then you need to add subscription details including a subscription for every character you want in game (you can play all classes on 1 character, alts are used only for increased inventory space)
[b]This game is old:[/b] the default graphics settings hurt (they're at PS2 quality) you will need to change settings before you play.
The default control bindings are really odd, you will want to look at the manual.
You won't have your hand held through quests (you need to read the quest text and will likely need a wiki open at all times).
The economy is not freindly to beginers, you will find no items suitable for beginers on auction (although good leveling gear is available through other means).
The patcher is awful and updates (especially after instal) will take AGES.

What this game does offer is a very old style MMO, in which progression is still reasonably hard and in which you won't be gifted with gear all the time (after lvl 50). You still have real choice in how you gear and will need to learn your classes. 
If you like the mechanics of MMOs 11-7 years ago and want one that's still active pick this up, it's also got decent storylines if you chose to follow the mission chains.

Some other points:
The game has made soloing and leveling much easier very recently, addtion of a system where you can get a party of up to 3 NPCs means you can level at a decent pace when solo and exploring all the content of the first 3 expansions (sure they can do stupid things but there are failsafes, like they can't pull).
The break point for content that's actually run by endgame players is around lvl 75-80 (this will take a few weeks), note that the quest to raise the level cap from 70 to 75 is very hard for some classes and you may want to main a class that finds it easier.",1387992872,1387995423,True,179,7,0.888727068901062012,7,True,False,False,False,,,

i managed to get both accounts needed into the game and yes 2 accounts and after all that the game still wont start.
it's not worth the hassle of even trying to get the game playing
