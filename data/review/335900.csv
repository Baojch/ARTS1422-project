Best equipment, every item maxed with christonia, and I´m still getting killed in one hit, ALL ENEMIES ATTACK BEFORE ME, every status effect just go through every one of my defenses before I could cast anything. The final boss is just... an insult to every player. 
Stun and party wipe with lighting. After seven tries this is just... well, noone tried to test this combat system. IT´s just bad, really bad.

As the developer helpfully points out, this is a remake of a retro pixel wannabe game from 2005, which also wasn't very good, and by their own admission, despite being a free browser game, couldn't exceed 50,000 people after they saw just how bad it was.   13 years have passed, but how little changes!

The goal of this game is to travel across four worlds and beat all of the dungeons/stages, after that is done, you will be greeted with a final dungeon/level that you must conquer.  It sounds like a simple goal but you will find it to be a very tedious goal as in order to gain access to a dungeon/level you must collect angels.
The battle system in this game includes both random battle and on-screen enemy battle. The battles themselves are turn-based to where everybody picks what they want to do and after that you will see everybody performing their actions.

A mediocre and boring RPG.

The developer is overzealous about policing the reviews, often dismissing legitimate concerns as ""trolling"" or flagging the review as off-topic. The recent steam review overhaul seems to have removed the erroneous flags however.

I get it, it's tough to take criticism about something you created, but this type of behavior is not doing you any favors. Just let the negative reviews be.

EDIT: I was wrong about this bit. Per dev comment you can indeed play full screen - I missed this.
As of writing this review, you cannot resize game window, it is very small, ~480x480. On a 4k or higher resolution screen this makes the game unplayably small.

The side quests in this game are ones where you turn in drops for rewards. You can get multiple of the same drop to turn in. But you have to turn them in one at a time, for no reason. When you have 100's to turn in you get annoyed part way through and just say sc*** it. Seriously, turn all of the same item in at once...

A number of the areas you go to are needlessly large. Ex: castles. I'm okay with the reusing of areas from one section of the game to another, but don't make them huge for no reason. The castle's are just a HUGE room with the entrance in the middle of one wall, and the king in the middle of the opposite wall. There is literally nothing else in this massive room. Nothing on the sides or anywhere else. Grandiose is nice, this isn't it.

Game become better, I can't say its literally ""best game"", but now you're no longer supossed to die randomly when you go to first battle zone (you can still die, but it depends on your playing not only miss rate).

On other hand there is [b]no more MMO[/b] (for now... well I weren't anyway able to make it work), let's hope they publish new version swiftly.

Review for old Ver. 1 (was more like 0.1)

Found some messages about author friends automatically downvote negative posts. So if you're not one of them write why you disagree.

[h1]I'm fan of RPG Maker games, but this...[/h1]

Don't even try to get this game for RPG (singleplayer) version until ""new version"" of RPG will be finished.

At start I was interrested in MMO, well even after fix using cmd. I got other error (Run-time error '5' -> after some searching it looks like ""bad"" code - some changes need's to be done to get rid of it).

(Q: What if game in 2015 needs manualy use cmd to fix [A: Congrat you have found unskilled ""programator""])

So about singleplayer RPG features:
[list]
    [*]Most textures are default, 
    [*]RPG Maker - only resolution 4:3 (I'm used to it so even when I have 16:9 it's not problem for me)
[/list]

And singleplayer gameplay 
[list]
    [*]Story looks fine but...
    [*]At start you have sword, in first room you can take armor for ally (but you don't have ally) and no skills / spells
    [*]You have no money, or potions. [spoiler] You can sell ally armor, but you will need it later [/spoiler]
    [*][b]When you get out of castle first random encounter can kill you.[/b] (I'm used to ""hardcore"" games, but this is *****)
    [*]Your gameplay until 25 gold ($Mirels) = [b][Save Game] get out of Castle -> 1 battle -> load game / go back to your bed (or kitchen) to heal yourself -> repeat[/b]
    [*]When you get 25 gold you can buy some teleporter (angel flight of fortuna) - after use you got ally (and possibly armor) so you can continue.

I have not finish the game yet but i want to give a short review .

I only play single player version

This game is like old classic JRPG style and i need a LOT of grinding to get through the game ( some really strong monsters that can kill me in one hit and some blocked areas that need grinding Mana to unlock) and many of expensive gears which make me want to grind grind grinding to get enough cash to buy them .

luckily i do love grinding in this game to get enough money to get items i want. ( sound like i am a shopaholic )

as well as get new strong magic when level up give me enough happiness that i can blow a pack of  strong monsters in one cast .

Annoying parts
- monsters on map chased and blocked me ( after beat them they won't disappear but only push back a little bit 
- no maps
- cannot exchange multiples Medal of Honor or Cristonia Nugget ( it need to keep pressing a button )
- F12 isn't screenshot but leave to main title ( please save often in case something gone wrong )

^_^ apart from that i like the game so far 8/10

the price is a little high in the UK but if you can get it on sale or cheap price then it is a must buy . 

ps. i will update review when i beat the game.",1440455884,1443236005,True,25,0,0.535188078880310059,0,False,False,False,False,,,

DISCLAIMER: I did not beat this game. I couldn't take any more grinding to get past the probably final dungeon, after the random encounter enemies were wiping me out despite being at level 50+ and having the best armor.

It's stock art, enemies and sound. RPGmaker stock stuff isn't bad but it shows a relative lack of effort. Major enemies and allies share sprites as well - I thought Samson had betrayed me or something but it was actually just some guy who was identical. The plot is relatively standard stuff: You, the sole capable fighter in the kingdom, must fight the entire army of darkness alone. Naked and armed with a long knife.

The main method of unlocking new towns and dungeons is mana collection. You collect mana by playing tag with angels inside of trees and caves. I'm not exaggerating, that's exactly what you do. You need to catch about 10 angels per dungeon (more or less, as the mana gain is randomized) while dodging enemies and going back to respawn the angels at a prayer point. It's pretty tedious.

There's a lot of grinding, but levels are useless aside from skill and HP/MP gain. Equipment is nearly the sole factor in victory or defeat. You also get only a pittance of money for each win. 'Sidequests' involve collecting a rare drop from enemies and turning it in repeatedly for a slightly better XP and cash gain.

The party system has some issues. The main character and his healer friend are permanent, leaving you with two spaces. The first three allies you unlock have the same class, equips and skills with only slightly different stat growths. The next three, halfway into the game, are a clone of the main character, a clone of the healer and a slightly different clone of the main character. There's also party switching. It's broken! If you do it wrong you can permanently lose a character, and even if you do it right your old and new characters lose all levels and gear! Why is this? Many games have figured out dynamic parties, it's not a new thing.

Item crafting is lame. First you have to grind enemies or certain respawning material points (similar to angels, but the ore doesn't run from you). It takes a good deal per item, and you need something like 2700 for a full set. Additionally, you're capped at 99 like every other item so you need to go back from time to time and drop them off. God forbid you pick up a chest full of the stuff without having  the space. The worst part of that is that after you collect the raw materials, you need to go 'refine' them. It takes five confirm presses to refine one item. There is no option for mass refinery. So if you want that end-game gear you'd better be ready to stand around and mash Z for a solid hour.

This may be a bug, but on-field enemies don't despawn. You can get caught in normal random battles, and flee or win as normal. But visible enemies pursue you and force you into a no-escape fight if they catch up. Even if you win, they don't go away - just take a step back (if they aren't blocked) and stop chasing you a while. God help you if you get caught in a hallway or have two enemies blocking you in a corner.

Pretty much the only thing this game has going for it is an active and interested creator. Overall I have no idea why you would pay $20 for this game! It might be good to kill ten hours if you got it for free.

Many of the things you pointed out are things we've acknowledged and considered needed changes.

Your review seemed honest, genuine and very inspiring. Although this is an old title, you (and through other player requests and suggestions) helped to encourage us to do a re-make of the game (not a sequel). Look for the new version next year.

As you may already know, we have since released a 2.0 version correcting a lot of the issues you've complained about. We are still working on a better version that is a total re-make done from the ground up. *I hope you will still consider trying our game in the future."
