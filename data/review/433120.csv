Visuals are not bad at all but everything else is done on a budget. Voice acting is God awful, antagonist sounds bored to be in the game and super quiet in contrast to the ship's AI who sounds like an old supermarket tannoy. Grammatical errors abound in the text, speech and even a quote from a famous scientist. Clearly made by a team for whom English is a second language but that's really no excuse for a half finished product.

Gameplay wise, this game plays sloooooow... So slow that I got bored before I even managed to leave the ship (all of which seems to be go here and switch this thing on) The character moves painfully slowly and for some reason can combat roll, crouch and jump but cannot run or even walk briskly (because you know, the ship will explode in ten minutes if you don't hurry up...) I only saw basic early enemies so can't really comment but I had multiple issues with melee attacks and did have one enemy stuck in the floor who could attack me but not be attacked back. Forced a reload as he was blocking a corridor and never moved...

This game COULD be good with a little polishing I think. Fix the typos, completely overhaul the voice acting and tweak the gameplay. Right now though, it may look cool but that's all it does right.

[h1] Story [/h1] Unser Raumschiff stürzt auf einem Unbekannten Planeten ab. Nur wir und die Künstliche Intelligenz des Schiffes sind noch am Leben. Wir müssen nun herausfinden wo genau wir gelandet bzw abgestürzt sind.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] In Klassischer Top Down Shooter manier laufen wir durch die Gegend und knallen alles ab was sich bewegt. Wir können verschiedene Waffen Teile einsammeln um Baupläne für Waffen zu bekommen, diese können wir dann an einer Maschine herstellen. Es gibt viele verschiedene Waffen (Pistolen,Schrotflinten,SMGs,Gewehre,Laser usw.) Es gibt auch recht viele verschiedene Gegnertypen, die aber mit wenig ausnahmen immer nur eine Nahkampf attacke ausführen können. Leider macht das Spiel den Eindruck als ob es nie fertig geworden wäre. Viele Bugs & Abstürze.

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Gute Grafik
+ Nette Atmosphäre
+ Viele verschiedene Waffen
+ Nette Idee mit den Waffen Bauplänen
+ Recht viele verschiedene Gegnertypen

- Viele Bugs
- Abstürze mit und ohne Fehlermeldung
- Spiel fühlt sich unfertig an
- Kein gutes Voice Acting
- Man kann nicht sprinten (dadurch fühlt sich alles so Langsam an)
- Leider keine Achievements

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein Spiel mit sehr viel Potential. Hätte man mehr Zeit & Mühe reingesteckt wäre es ein toller Top Down Shooter geworden. Aber mit den ganzen Bugs & Abstürzen ist es teilweise unspielbar. Leider so nicht zu Empfehlen

・当たり判定が不思議。食らいモーションが不明瞭。
・起動する度にオプション設定を忘れる。 毎回再設定必要。

The game is supported by decent graphics as shown on the trailer videos and screenshots but unfortunately suffers from many development issue that becomes quickly apparent after 0.2h of playing:
-  Control scheme that does not support running.  It might sound weird, but pressing left shift and not going for a sprint is, at least to me, highly unsual and quite disturbing in term of gameplay.  The absence of any kind of map which is replaced by a light spot moving around to show you where to go also points to the developper taking shortcut to go on a quick release.
- The absence of a game logo in your library (you can see the Unreal Engine instead) as well as the voice over in the game also reveal that the game was probably done on the cheap.  There is nothing wrong with that, but with the quite visually appealing graphics, there is a big clash between what you see and how the overall game really feels making not one that you will be willing to spend hours on.
- Additionaly the game misses a tutorial.  I generally don't like tutorials but since some of the controls here are unusual, a tutorial will be quite handy (possibly using the first sort of useless level to indicate what keys do what...).
- Dying at your first monster encounter (I don't think I spoiled anything here) because you are in a dark area and nothing told you to press F for the flashlight brings too much frustration on my side to keep playing.  

In short, Crash Landing could have been a good game without necessarily bringing anything new to the genre but some bad development decisions make it an average game.  Will I give it a try again? Probably yes... But I am quite sure at the moment, I will probably never attempt to finish this game unless the developer does major upgrade...Simply because I got better ones in my Steam collection.

Очень-очень-очень плохой. Черт, да эта игра даже хуже, чем Primal Fears. Сразу видно, что разработчики попросту лентяи, решившие что top-down шутер легок в производстве. Буквально каждый элемент игры сделан кое-как, лишь бы был, следов ответственного подхода к работе не замечено. Если по порядку: 
1) отвратная и заторможенная анимация, таких ""перекатов"" вы еще не видели; 
2) слишком низкая камера; 
3) скучный и банальный дизайн уровней; 
4) разброс пуль при стрельбе гигантский даже у пистолета, иногда пули пролетают НАД врагами (подчеркиваю - в шутере с видом СВЕРХУ, где высоту прицела вы не контролируете)
5) кнопка ""отключить озвучку"" в меню оказалась вовсе не зря - такое наплевательство на свою работу даже у наших отечественных актеров дубляжа нечасто встретишь.
На фоне этого в лучшую сторону можно выделить интерфейс, но только за счет того, что все остальное сделано неимоверно убого. А интерфейс просто есть, стандартненький такой.
Еще багов в первых двух уровнях нет и игра не вылетела ни разу за полчаса. Не ахти какое, но достижение.

This is honestly the first time I have ever requested a refund on anything.  I sincerely hope the developer works to patch this game and make some much-needed improvements.  My original review follows:

When I read in the description that this game ""follows in the footsteps of...Alien Breed or Shadowsgrounds,"" I was super-psyched.  The two Shadowgrounds games and three Alien Breed games are my favorite top-down shooters of all time.  However, my excitement quickly gave way to disappointment and, after about 70 minutes of play time, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.  There's a lot of potential here but the game feels like an unfinished late-alpha or early-beta release.

The setting is good (if unoriginal) and the beginning of the story is somewhat intriguing (if uninspired) though I don't think I played long enough to evaluate how any of that pans out.  Even so, it's hard to care much because of the horrendous voice acting.  The ship's AI seems to have more emotion than your character does - you seriously sound indifferent that the ship has crashed and the rest of the crew is likely dead.

The controls are clunky from the get go and movement is terribly slow.  There does not seem to be a way to run - the control for ""dash"" causes you to roll forward, like an evasive maneuver.  There is very little to interact with in the environment - what you can interact with will be glowing, including pickups, computers, door controls, etc.  Not sure what to think about weapons.  You start with just a pistol but you find weapons components along the way, yet there's no indication what they do, if anything.  I did not play enough to find and try any other weapons.  There's no inventory management at all - the few items you can have are displayed in the HUD.

Another criticism is the save system - you have one save slot, regardless of which difficulty level you play.  There's simply no excuse for that in a modern game.  I should also mention that, in just over an hour, the game froze twice, forcing me to kill it and restart.  I could go on and on about everything that's wrong with this game and how disappointed I am but I think I'll cut it short.  In conclusion, this game has a ton of problems.  It's a combination of being unfinished and bad design decisions.  The game most definitely needs some severe patching but even that won't fix some of its issues.  And it will certainly never rank up there with Shadowgrounds or Alien Breed.  NOT RECOMMENDED.",1455137974,1455245526,False,38,0,0.724215984344482422,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game so far is pretty damn good. I like the crafting, enemies, weapons, story, and the options menu is good. The game still has room for improvement though. I can never get a break from enemies, and always have to be conscious of them spawning behind me. I can't even stop to read one of the text pickups, and they keep coming when I am trying to craft a weapon. I also noticed my frames kept gradually dropping from 60 until I was at only a couple fps, then the game crashed. One tip I found is that the best experience is probably to play on easy difficulty, because at normal or hard there is so many enemies everywhere and they take so many bullets to kill that you will be reloading every 5 seconds and you'll die pretty quickly. Overall, the game is fun and good but could be fleshed out a little more.",1454780032,1454780032,True,11,3,0.460292547941207886,0,True,False,False,False,,,
