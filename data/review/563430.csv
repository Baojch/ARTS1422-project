You need to understand that you're not going to get every item in the game because skill challenges in the final area can require 60 points to achieve, and devoting your cash to upgrade all three skills will leave you lacking in all of them. Only focus on one, and put the rest into your combat stats, as even with my Health and Defense at 60, the final boss still took out half my HP with a single hit. Your goal should be to one-shot every enemy, while having enough HP and Defense to not get one-shot yourself.

Gameplay consists of choosing from one of three available classes, then bumbling around dungeons from a 2D top down perspective, doing skill challenges and RPG fights, and booking to see an optometrist because the jaggy pixel ""art"" damaged your eyes. 

Video game construction kits like OHRRPGCE are intended to educate and make little demos to pass around with friends, and shouldn't be used to create substitutes for professionally developed, cutting edge video games.  Using poor quality construction kits invariably results in poor quality games, and Void Pyramid is no exception.

They chose to use obsolete retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.  Resolution and controls are locked.  These flaws push this game far below minimum acceptable standards for PC. 

While a lot of effort went into filling the game templates for OHRRPGCE, the limitations of the engine and the choice to use retro pixel ""art"" instead of contemporary video game graphics are major detractors.

It has simple but surprisingly well-defined pixel graphics, making it easy to see where secrets are tucked away once you figure out what to look for and it's not hard to figure out what to look for. In a nice bit of nostalgia, there are three numbers (LIFE, ATTACK, DEFENSE) for combat and three separate numbers (BRAWN, WITS, AGILITY) for exploration and the beginning and end of combat. Combat is very simple, but so far not needed. It's more of an obstacle with a potential reward, rather than necessary grinding, since you can find a fair amount of currency and items just by exploring.

There are no experience points, just a currency you can spend on consumables and attributes. You always get some small amount of currency from fights, even if you instantly win via high BRAWN, but you also have a chance of getting a larger reward (80+ currency, an item, or a random attribute point) based on your WITS score.

The text descriptions add to the nostalgic feel as you explore, giving you a fairly clear picture of what you're looking at and what you're doing without being too precise or verbose. So far, it's all very well done, especially for a free game with no attempt to take your money that I can find.

The atmosphere and darkly comedic writing particularly stand out as great. The six stats (Health, Attack, Defense, Brawn, Agility, Intelligence) are all balanced very well with each other, each being equally useful throughout the game depending on the situation. The three different classes and how they interact with the pyramid combined with the multiple ways to solve problems and differences in endings provide a good deal of replay value, adding up to at least seven hours of gameplay if you go through once for each class. 

On the downside, around the end of the game things will slow down noticeably as you prepare for the endgame, and once you get there, the last few bosses are all balanced quite poorly with both you and each other. While the extremely basic and simple combat is fine throughout most of the game, at the end its flaws really show. Ammit, the last foe you must defeat to successfully escape the pyramid, who has been foreshadowed since the beginning of the game as an extremely powerful and terrifying foe who is the main reason no one has escaped before... is *tied* for *second* most powerful foe in the pyramid, thanks to some optional bosses hanging around doing nothing in particular as parts of one sidequest. And because of how stat growth in this game works, if you fight the optional true final boss, he will almost certainly be either be way too hard or way too easy; if you go in with little to no grinding after beating Ammit and completing all the sidequests, you will be slaughtered quickly while he heals himself for whatever damage you did, but if you spend just a bit more time on dull grinding for stats, he will die within a single turn before he can do anything at all.

Potential points of criticism are the battle instances, which don't quite aesthetically match the rest of the game (as someone said it looks a little like the backgrounds were designed in MSPaint), and the music, which is variously essentially 15-30 seconds of beats on repeat, but alternatively this apparent amateurness could be a charm...

There's a fair amount of grinding involved but then again, most RPGs have that. What I like though is two things: Instead of traditional levels, when you win a fight you get one of two, technically three, rewards: Either a point put into one of your stats or a sum of cash with larger sums being treated as said reward, and all that money goes towards items and more stat points, creating a nice sense of constant progression.

 Also, the game will give you a little heads up that maybe you're too strong for a particular area with the message ""Weak enemies give no rewards"". A little hint that maybe you should move along to a tougher area. The game can be quite challenging too, but rarely frustrating as long as you're careful with your items, don't go blindly charging into every fight and decide whether it's worth charging onward or heading back to your save room.

What I loved though was finding out how my three attributes, Brawns, Wits, and Agility, affected the world around me. Word of advice? Interact with EVERYTHING as you never know what you may discover.

My only real frustration came when I tried to take on an optional boss, got my butt kicked, and lost all my gear, which was irritating but I guess that one's on me.

I played as a Scribe and put roughly five hours into this first run and I still managed to miss the optional bosses and quite a few of the treasures. The ending I got was a mix of satisfying and confusing in some ways.

It takes a solid concept (grim Egyptian space-future of the 1980's) and triples down on it, using pixel art and brief blurbs to create a setting that feels more alive than some AAA stuff that's currently on the market. On top of that, the design is simple, but very effective. Battles are one or two-hit affairs, you progress by buying stats, you have combat and out-of-combat stats, with after-combat rewards increasing the lower your combat stats are...it's smooth, it's simple, and it feels good.

Despite being a concept that could easily have been executed with some stock rpgmaker hackery, everything in this game is custom. It feels like a love-letter to the old DOS days. If it had come out back then, it would have been a fondly remembered classic.

Although it's not really what you're there for, Void Pyramid has a central plot, and it's pretty solid. However, the writing shines in the small details. Practically every other tile is examinable, and the descriptions are good enough that they're all worth examining. Add into that ten or so different variables that make up your ending, and this is a really, really excellent piece of freeware.

The writing is particularly good, and is kinda reminiscent of these weird 80s PnP RPG manuals or Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, with MONSTER NAMES IN CAPS and an extremely serious tone applied to the most ridiculous subjects.

Your character has three ""dungeon stats"" (corresponding to the classic fighter / mage / rogue archetypes) which are used extensively through skillchecks, allowing you to explore rooms in different ways. There are optional treasures to find (which are described in detail and are a great contribution towards world-building, in a Dark Souls kind of way), and multiple endings (most of which being bad ends). Sadly, the combat is pretty barebones and usually amounts to spamming attack (or, when facing bosses, the item which allows you to attack twice), although the ""dungeon stats"" can alter the fights in a variety of ways (by allowing you to run away, killing the enemy instantly, or increasing the chances of a reward).

Although it's not really innovative gameplay-wise, it has that sense of wonder early 8/16-bit RPGs had, which is kind of lost nowadays.

I'm super proud of what Mr. Hagen has accomplished.

Void Pyramid's design philosophy is almost paradoxical. It strips the dungeon crawler RPG elements to a minimalist, barebones approach that resembles mechanics you might find in an early to mid 80s CRPG for IBM or Apple II, with a relatively tiny game world to explore. And yet the game world is full of a densely packed and highly detailed variety of novel situations and features, NPC and narrator flavor text is taken to a high art, and the hazy history and ecology of a dismal, far-future posthuman society is yours to discover and piece together as you go along. And of course there are a lot of ways to die horribly.

The tone of the narration is simultaneously dire, morbid, flippant and occasionally hilarious. It's rare to see descriptive text that's done this well in an RPG. If you enjoy games where the graphics are chiefly symbolic and the real details are to be found in word form, this is a must try.

The combat is frequent, yet mercifully brief - both you and your foes are liable to die in 2 or 3 blows, or even 1. Only health, attack and defense stats come into play during battles, and there are no spells or special abilities, only a few consumable items at your disposal. But each fight is tense, as the damage dealt by enemies needs to be gauged closely. Misjudging a single turn in combat even if you're at mostly full health can quickly get you immediately slain by a critical hit, randomly losing some or all of your gold or items, and sent back to respawn. Even with such simple mechanics at play, the combat is very strategic; players of tough single-hero RPGs like Dragon Warrior 1 will feel right at home. (There's no autosave on death, so save scumming is totally viable if that's how you want to handle the death setbacks.)

The music and sounds together have a trippy, somewhat psychedelic feeling and add to the atmosphere of the game without being obtrusive. The graphics are minimalist but done with style and originality, with a lot of bright pastels contrasting with brown and yellow neutral tones. The monster designs are generally pretty fantastic.

The lack of gameplay depth in some areas may be a turn off for some players, as well as the retro style and rough graphical edges, but if you enjoy exploring a finely detailed game world and overcoming challenges at every turn, you need to give Void Pyramid a try.

1) [u]Сюжет[/u]: давным-давно во времена расцвета египетской цивилизации, ведущими инженерами была построена дрейфующая в космосе пирамида, ставшая на тот момент вершиной человеческой мысли. Но прошли годы, рухнули древние царства, Пирамида пришла в запустение, пока новый Фараон не приспособил её под тюрьму для воров, изменников, мутантов и прочих замечательных личностей. Наш герой оказался одной из них, вот только оставаться здесь он не намерен. Сюжет в игре прописан весьма интересно, текст событий в игре меняется в зависимости от первоначального выбора героя и от его статов, вариантов концовок немерянно, и зависят они от времени игры, количества собранных сокровищ, выборов сделанных в некоторых местах, кол-во убитых врагов и множества других параметров, так что реиграбельность здесь довольно высока.

2) [u]Геймплей[/u]: игровой процесс представляет из себя некий микс из jRPG, и старых ролевок. В начале нам нужно выбрать одного из трех персонажей - у них различаются статы и взгляд на мир. К примеру солдат может собирать в некоторых местах из мусора оружие, раб имеет иммунитет к радиации и ловушкам на её основе, писарь умеет расшифровывать старые письменна и получать за это бонусы. Задача наша убежать из пирамиды. Выполняя её и бродя по карте мы натыкаемся на множество разных событий и боев исход которых (а также текст) зависят от статов и персонажа. Статы не прокачиваются а покупаются за местные деньги. Отдельно нам попадаются сокровища - всего 45, они влияют только на сюжет и на концовку. Если персонажа убьют, весь прогресс сохранится, но нас накажут понижением какого-нибудь стата, или отнятием денег\предметов. Концовок в игре довольно много, при этом есть 2 заведомо проигрышные. Всю игру можно пройти если постараться, меньше чем за 2 часа (за это кстати будет одна из ""счастливых"" концовок).

3) [u]Графика и звуки[/u]: в игре неплохая графика под старые ретро-игры (мне чем-то Амигу навеяло). Мрачная электронная музыка тоже неплохо работает на атмосферу этакого киберпанковского Египта, но малое количество трэков несколько приедается в процессе.

[u]Как итог[/u]: для бесплатной ретро-киберпанк-RPG, игра вышла весьма достойная. Любителям ретро-RPG, нео-древнеегипетского киберпанка (серьезно, по другому это не опишешь ;), и просто сюжетных игр, рекомендую!

The artstyle is charmingly simplistic. The controls are simple, W A S D and spacebar. It is strongly reminiscent of old games on older systems.

Different rooms have different levels of enemy, which is indicated by a number at the top right corner of the screen.

The levels are well designed, encouraging exploration and back-tracking. Your adventure can be experienced in different ways because the three roles of soldier, slave, or scribe give you differing stats that affect how you survive in the Pyramid.

What I love the most is the lore, written into many different forms such as items' descriptions, graffiti found on walls, and the aug terminals, it truly builds a unique and interesting world. I'd be very happy to pay for this, but since it's free, I'll just have to settle for giving it a 'would hew Prime Pharaoh again' out of 10.

I've played this before the Steam release and I have to say this is a wonderful game.  Graphics are little simple outside of combat but the game is rock solid.  Music is nice, combat is great and a bit rough at times.  Sometimes it's fun to walk into an obvious trap just to see what happens.

The three 'classes' you can pick from are different in their base stats but the important thing is that different ones can find and interact with different things on the map.  A Scribe can read archaic hieroglyphs, a Slave gets help from their fellows and enter irradiated zones, and the Soldier can repair weapons.  Death has a random cost.  You might lose money, a stat point, or all your limited use items.  Finding the hidden treasure items will change the ending.

You have nothing to lose in trying this out.  It's a wonderful weird game.  Go for it!",1480958675,1480958675,True,47,3,0.816118240356445313,0,False,False,False,False,,,
