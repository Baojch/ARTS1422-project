Затем был потрясающий стихотворный трейлер, проиллюстрированный профессиональными риснуками, рассказывающий будоражащую воображение историю безумного Мэра города Джеклин Хайтс. Затем я прочёл то немногое, что написано об игре на официальном сайте и сказать что проникся сюжетом и персонажами - ничего не сказать. Вообщем покупать игру или нет  - такого вопроса уже не стояло.
И должен сказать после покупки я нисколько не разочаровался, хотя игры в раннем доступе часто полны багов и недоработок. Здесь же мы видим вполне цельный и играбельный продукт, только немного пустоватый - персонажей всего три, не все надписи и элементы прорисованы в достаточной степени, ни и игроваая концепция и механика, уверен, ещё претерпит много изменений до релиза (а он обещан разработчиками через год).
Играть действительно весело и интересно - геймплей просто и ненапрягающий, умирать совершенно необидно. Весь игровой процесс - получение удовольствия в чистом виде. И от динамики боя, и от картинки, и от общей мрачно-гротескной атмосферы. 

За всё небльшое время, что мы играли (с целью записать ролик, который будет ниже), не было ни одного бага или вылета. Да, оптимизация пока не на высоте и фпс может быть выше, но если не вести запись как мы, то играть можно и на далеко не самых современных видеокартах.

Вообщем, мы в восторге от этой игры и всем ей рекомендуем. Вот небольшой обзор от нас.

And it's not just reflected by the environment, but also by the characters you get to play as. 

I like to play as Benny the barber most of the time, trying to find my next ""client"" who needs more than just their hair cut :p 

Although the game currently only has one map, the gameplay is actually quite dynamic and varied as there are different goals to pursue that are given out by the mayor.  There are multiple quests to complete per match, and each one plays differently. 

For example, the mayor could ask you to steal paintings from the rich and bring them to the slum part of town. So the rich team has to defend their valuables, and the poor have to grab the loot and run home. There's also a ""king of the hill"" mode, where you and your team must hold the center of town for a period of time in order to score. Then there's capture the flag, payload, and other types of quests.

Now this may seem a bit odd to throw all these game modes into a single match, but it works surprisingly well because the narrative of the mayor holds everything together, so that all these little quests turn into a story about how the poor managed to overcome the rich, or vice versa.

Overall, I feel like Jeklynn Heights is a rough diamond that primarily needs some more work put into the technical aspects as well as more content (new characters and quests). But for now, it is a good start with a strong theme and direction, and I'm excited to see how everything unfolds.

Time to plunge down the rabbit hole and into Jeklynn Heights, as I'm sure YOU also need more than just a haircut!",1464422782,1464477991,True,8,0,0.504057228565216064,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I've been following this game for a long long time and was lucky enough to beta test it the last month. I'm a huge fan of Savage 2, a now dead game, and I've been searching for a game with a similar combat system for far too long without success. Jeklynn Heights promises to deliver!

The developers are as friendly as can be, really dedicated and open to suggestions. The game is still in its early stages, but this also means great potential, the joy of seeing a game grow and the chance to affect the development by jumping on the early access train.

The combat is where it's at. While unpolished in its current state, the idea is what I love. A chain of different attacks with the possibility to block enemy attacks coming at you. Time your moves according to your enemy and you win the fight! With the different abilities and stats for each character, it makes for very interactive and direct fights and you feel you have control of what is happening. If you lose, it's on you!

The art style is also something I definitely like about this game. It has this bizarre vibe going on without exagerrating much. All the crazy things going on are just ""normal"". And the mad mayor's voice guiding you through the game is a great touch.

My main concern about the game right now is the playerbase. This is a multiplayer game and without players to fill a server, the experience is not quite enjoyable. There's an attempt to gather players at a specific time going on at the steam discussion page, 3 EST and 9 EST apparently, so I hope this helps.

I look forward to the future of this game!

The game is set in the village of Jeklynn and the Rich and Poor factions are battling to be able to leave the town. Players can chose from a hero from either Rich or Poor who all have different abilities (tank, glass cannon, healer etc.).

The art is amazing, and the music, although very repetitive actually fits the atmosphere so well that it adds to the game and doesn't get annoying. The extra addition of the Mayor who doles out little quests for the players as they fight and kill one another adds a fantastic element to the battles. I also love that he plays to each sides stereotypes and biases of one another, the rich blame the poor for their woes and the poor blame the rich, while the Mayor is really the problem. So you have these rpg elements and a simple little storyline turning what would otherwise be yet another first/third person shooter, into a really fun little experience.

Joining either the Rich or the Poor, your goal is to win matches in an event-driven battle arena.

Already great are the mesmerizing style and gameplay core. The dark fairy tale style is mirrored well in a detailed map, bizarre characters, atmospheric sounds and lore-fitting events. Thanks to shorter matches, this game can be easily played even when life is busy. Cycling events keep up the interest as well as the active combat system. Melee-oriented with ranged as support and ability-based, the outcome of the game heavily depends on your own skills, priority settings and team play.

What you might miss at the current state are more contents, technical optimizations (this game is nothing for low-spec PCs and Windows only) and top-notch visuals covering overall graphics, better animations, UI and interfaces. Those issues are known and will be countered in the future.  It’s planned to switch to a new engine, work on side-specific classes, more events and maps, better visuals, combat tweaks and fitting suggestions pushed forward by the community; not to forget matchmakings for competitive scenes.

The basics are promising, the lore allows lots of potential and creative processes and most importantly the communication between players and developers runs smooth. Bugs and errors were fixed fast and devs are open for logical and feedback-driven suggestions.

If you are unsure whether to buy or not, my recommendations are:
Wait with a buy if you expect a perfectly finished game with top-notch visuals. Keep in mind hitherto existing contents are functional and fun but limited.
Buy if you want to play for the sake of having chaotic fun, like to help developing or want to support this game growing. So far, I enjoy Jeklynn Heights very much. Got the game for free as a test player and staying for the overall good atmosphere and thrilled matches in-game.
