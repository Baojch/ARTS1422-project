Here is my First look at the game, Sadly its a limited game currently, as 1 player vs bunnies or multiplayer locally. 

https://youtu.be/vVYyUtxyFss
So now that you have seen what this game is currently as I write this review. Here are my Pro's and Con's

Keep on your notes this game is EARLY ACCESS, and I hope it expands into an massive game, with lobbies upgrades an so forth. it has an insane amount of potential and I can't wait!

This is a 2D side scrolling death chaos blood bath of bunnies. With 4 characters and several maps, and the option (grayed out when played) for a map editor, It fills the void of mindless chaos against your friends! Tho downsides currently outweigh the pros, most of the Con's will probably be fixed in the future releases allowing for a full Experience of the game. but this game is funny and funny looking and I hope to see it get even more ridiculous!



Pro
- THE PHYSICS!!! It was hilarious!
- Ton's of weapons, 99% realistic types with varying types of accuracy
- Custom Sprites Graphics sounds music maps... All custom!
- Blood 
- Explosions
- Chaos 
- Multiple maps and Character Types
- Map Editor (Unreleased yet)
- So much potential to become one hell of a great battle game!

Con
- The game name itself makes no sense to me
- Characters do not seems to make a difference other then bigger or smaller targets
- Maps seem to be limited on size or directions and obstacles sometimes are to well blended into the background.
- Weapon selection seems limited and needs more outlandish weapons even if they are mapped based such as the moon.
- There is blood spots but no Gore like exploding bunny parts and such
- Naked bunnies are cool but should be able to customize them that way you can tell your friends apart and pick on the weak one for free kills(hats, shorts, shoes, glasses, etc)
- No stages besides training (obviously this will be expanded on, but how? stages, challenges, puzzles?)
- No viewable leaderboard while in game.
- Character selection is just making a bunny bigger or smaller I did not see a difference, if they have ""Classes"" I did not understand it. and I hope to see more of them as well!
- You just jump, aim, shoot
- Non adjustable AI's, they are beyond stupid.

In the end this game in its current state would be a fun brawl style game when you invite people over, but its fairly redundant bullets fly by and kill you you re-spawn shortly afterward, so it will have its fun once in a while, but until it comes out with something that drives me to keep playing... such as a shop with customization items and you earn money from battles or something similar or just a goal to aim for!

But I recommend this game for anyone who has friends who can come over it would be a fun game to playing large groups. and when online play opens, The WORLD will have to play!",1476770826,1476776914,True,4,0,0.48251420259475708,0,False,True,True,False,,,

Before I write anything about this game I would like to thank Raving Bots for giving me a code to try the game and a code to giveaway a copy of the game too, [u] this doesn't affect my review in any way, shape or form. [/u] 

 [h1] A little description of the game [/h1] 

Carrotting Brain is a similar game to Worms where you grab weapons from crates and use them to annihilate your enemies, the only difference being you're a Rabbit instead of a Worm.

 [h1] Pros & Cons [/h1] 

Pros:
 [list]
    [*]Full controller support
    [*]Good graphics
    [*]Fun to play
    [*]Funny sound effects when collecting crates and things (The Rabbits in this game kind of laugh)
    [*]The maps are very creative
[/list] 

Cons:
[list]
[*]A bit over priced for what's available at the current stage of development (There's only training against AI and split screen but multiplayer and a campaign is coming soon)
[*]The AI are ridiculous to kill and Fatty sponges everything
[*]If you fall off the side of the map you're screwed (Ending up in the water completely froze my game and there's no way to respawn from what I could find)
[/list] 

 [h1] Extras and gameplay [/h1] 

[b] Overall this game is very fun to play, [/b]  I recommend it if blowing up your enemies and jumping around on the moon is your thing and it will be even better when there's more to do and bug fixes.

+ Quite a wide selection of weapons 
+ The low-gravity and certain stages adds a lot of fun especially when you jump between planets and get a kill midflight
+ Gore / Violence is pretty hilarious with cute bunnies
+ Destructable Environment
+ Multiplayer

- Not a whole lot of content or things to do at the moment.
- I feel like the movement could be greatly improved (i'd suggest upping the movement speed, jump height, and perhaps a way to crouch)
- I feel like this game needs a full campaign with a funny story and missions to complete. At the moment it's just an amusing little battle arena that will last a good 10-20minutes or so.",1453917550,1453917550,False,5,0,0.462677478790283203,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Here's my review (16-Nov-2015):

Somehow there's no way to play this game on keyboard because the default kb+m layout is messed up. So I hooked up my X360 controller and fumbled around in training mode for a while. Even in training mode, the controls feel awkward. Fast aiming is a key component in the game with all the bunny hopping going on, pro stick aiming is a requirement for this game. Only for melee weapon can you just go button mashing and hope your enemies don't come into the fight with anything non-melee or stronger-melee.

In short, this game really needs a lot of work and is therefor an Early Access Game. At the moment, I strongly recommend against splashing down EUR 11.99 which is probably USD 11.99 on this title.",1447693070,1447693070,False,6,0,0.528617143630981445,0,False,False,True,False,,,

[H1] Carroting Brain[/h1]

Carroting Brain is a cartoon rabbit shooter. The goal of this game is to kill as many other rabbits as you can with the weapons you find. Have up to 6 A.I rabbits to fight against in a total FFA. Choose from all types of weapons such as sniper rifles, assault rifles, various shotguns, various pistols and melee weapons and MORE. Go to various planets in the deep outer space, visit the moon and other made up planets to fight and destroy.

[H1] What to do in the game[/H1]
Theres not a whole lot to do in this game, its a 2d platform arena with rabits with guns. This game is early access and there will be more content coming soon. They will be adding more guns, more maps and more content. This game shows a lot of potential and can become something great. This game has some amazing and intresting physics that are fun to mess around with.

[H1] Pros [/H1]
[List]
[*] Bunnies.
[*] Bunnies with guns.
[*] Fun physics.
[*] Destructible maps.
[*] Bunnies... again

[H1]Cons[/H1]
[*] Not very many levels.
[*] No bunny customization.

[H1] Final Verdict[/H1]
Overall I rate this game a 7/10 it is still in early access and has some great content. It is still a fun 2d platform game with bunnies. Run, hop and gun your way to victory against the evil bunnies. I recommend this game to anyone who likes platform shooters.
