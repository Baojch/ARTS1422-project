Yet at the same time, I can't possibly recommend this in good conscience.

I should start off by saying this is unapologetically old-school. Not necessarily a good or bad thing, but it's worth noting.

I won't say it's brutally difficult because there's way more challenging (new and old) 2D platformers out there. 

But it does feel pretty barren as far as content goes.

The game is relatively short, and there's no unlockables or extra modes or side content. The replayability past the first playthrough is decent if you're into speedruns, but for the average player, you most likely won't want to touch this game ever again in your life, if you can even make it to the end.

Also there's no resolution settings, no achievements, no cloud saves etc.
It really feels like a bad port of a 90's game. Which sounds cool, until you realize you could be emulating some snes games instead.

The 2D sprite art is actually very nice, and despite the intentional retro look, it's actually rather colorful and detailed.
The mythological theme of the game is also a nice touch, and while keeping lore to a minimum, it still delivered some aesthetic flavor.

The soundtrack feels rather outdated, and uninspired. It conforms to the old school nature of this game, but the compositions don't fit the game's theme. In a sense, it feels like it could have been made for any retro game out there, not necessarily this one. And unlike some of the soundtrack gems from old retro games, this isn't any memorable or interesting at all.

Gameplay-wise, the controls feel very responsive, yet the level design ends up rather punishing for no good reason.
What I mean by that is, it gives you an arsenal of tools that are rather op, you can grab and hold onto walls indefinitely, chain wall jump on a single wall up to the ceiling, you can double jump, you can dash mid-air, you can even hover float upwards mid-air, you can attack around you mid-air, and all of it feels very responsive.
Yet at the same time, the game will still bend you over by overhead platforms that you can bump into mid-air as you try to navigate upwards and fall all the way down (often times in ""lava"" floor that will instantly kill you), sometimes you'll take damage as you try to hit an enemy mid-air (there's no invisibility as you slash so you have to make sure the enemy will be within your sword swing and not too close to you, which is common sense really, but not as easy to execute accurately while trying to chain combos mid-air, as you're watching out for platforms over your head, and trying not to fall into the chasing lava floor.) 
Maybe if some of those ""frustrations"" were not in place, your kit would end up too op, or the game would end up too easy, but bs level design is not the right way to balance this or make the game feel satisfyingly challenging.
Of course I'm not going to get all entitled over this, as I know that if someone cared enough to replay each level enough times to master it, it's absolutely possible to build up a lot of momentum and flow in this game. It's a high risk high reward kind of approach.
This lack of handholding, and somewhat steep learning curve as far as nailing a flawless execution goes (despite the straight forward and responsive controls), conform to the overall unapologetic, repetition based, old school take of this game, but at the end of the day, and as ""rewarding"" as a perfect combo chain should feel in theory, in reality, the game still isn't all that fun to play and feels rather gimmicky.

tl;dr: honestly, this game is total shit, and considering all the great 2D platformers out there, skip this one, even if you're a fan of the genre, whether you're looking for a challenge, or feel nostalgic.

L'avventura di Iola, guerriera caduta per mano del classico cattivaccio da mitologia spicciola, è infatti alla stregua di tutti quei platform dell'era 8 e 16 bit in cui bastava davvero poco per sentirsi degli eroi: tantissimi salti da una piattaforma all'altra, un fendente di spada come attacco primario, qualche potere magico come asso nella manica e tonnellate di nemici da abbattere. E monete da collezionare. Una valagna di monete da collezionare, visto che serviranno per pagare pedaggio ad un avarissimo Caronte ed accedere al livello successivo. Parliamo di un gioco tanto semplice e immediato, quanto impegnativo e bastardo al punto giusto, in cui la soddisfazione più grande è data dal tenere a bada orde di nemici a colpi di spada o con i tre poteri elementali che otterremo raccogliendo delle pergamene sparse per i livelli (un po' come le armi secondarie in Castlevania). Avremo il fuoco per arrostire i nemici con una fiammata, il fulmine per potenziare i colpi di spada e l'acqua per creare una barriera protettiva attorno alla nostra eroina. Il tutto, fino ad esaurimento della classica barra del mana a nostra disposizione.

Tuttavia, Olympia Rising ha qualche problema qui e lì che potrebbe rendere l'esperienza di gioco un tantino più frustrante del solito, come il fatto che il menu di pausa non metta effettivamente in pausa il gioco, costringendoci a battere in ritirata per metterci al sicuro. I nemici, tra l'altro, sono estremamente aggressivi, e dal momento che le hit-box sono piuttosto generose, in alcuni casi dovremo fare affidamento sulla classica tattica del combattimento mordi-e-fuggi. Qualora dovessimo soccombere ai nostri nemici, poi, verremo rispediti all'inizio del livello, con i progressi azzerati e senza magia elementale. Nelle prime fasi è un difetto di poco conto, ma nelle zone successive, con livelli enormi e centinaia di monete da raccogliere, il problema diventa un tantino più grande.

Ciò nonostante, l'esperienza di gioco resta comunque piacevole lungo le quattro/cinque ore che saranno necessarie per arrivare alla fine dell'avventura, soprattutto grazie alla foggia tipicamente retrò di cui è intriso Olympia Rising, compresa la gradevole pixel art che lo impreziosisce e una colonna sonora chiptune davvero orecchiabile.

Disclaimer 2: Not a big platformer guy, never liked megaman or the like.
I wanted to like this game, but it left me frustrated in the bad kind of way, and most of my problems are with the core game mechanics. This is a ""genuine indie experience"" meaning there is a lot of charm, but also alot of obvious design-mistakes. Here they are (in my shallow perspective) from experience-ruining to nitpicks:
- Time slows down for about half a second every time you kill an enemy, which is a crime against the player in a game that requires timing
- You move vertically, with bursts of speed. Off-screen enemies can be inside of you after only a fraction of a second. This, combined with the fact that your basic attack kills anything in your vicinity turns the game into a spam-fest.
- Platforms usually cannot be passed through from below. I thought the gaming-industry had collectivily agreed that this was a bad idea that breaks flow?
- Getting damaged cancels your jump. At first, I thought this was a bug. since the green goo spells instant death this often results in frustrating deaths. Why??
- You cannot attack while clinging to walls, and the clinging is automatic. I constantly got stuck on terrain, then damaged. Just a bad decision
- Starting from the bottom of the same, unchanging level every time you die quickly makes the first half of any level a chore.
- You fall way too quick, meaning in the vast majority of cases, missing a single platform leads to goo-death. There is little you can do except hope for a platform below.
- If you do well on a level, the excess coins carry over to the next level, making the game easier for excellent players and harder for those who needs more than one try.

Was certainly fruitful to me, gave me a few ideas to try out in the visual department. Nice tilings!

I also really like the combo mechanic. Basically, the game consists in collecting at least X coins in each level. Coins are found on the ground, or awarded by killing enemies. The great thing is that there are flying enemies who die in one hit, and each one gives you an extra air jump. For each enemy you kill without touching the ground/walls your combo rises, giving you +1 coin per enemy. The mechanic isn't deeply explored, but the idea is still nice! And there are some sections when you're supposed to get your combo up using this mechanic.

Would be nice if the game explored this with different mechanics (a bit like Guacamelee?), but hey.

The game's structure feels a bit unexplored. If you collect more than X coins, you get to keep them for the next level. But not if you die (and it is common to die), so it loses a bit of purpose. It's also very easy to get the coin requirement, even without worrying about comboing and exploring everything, so... yeah. The structure is enough for a small, unpretending game, but I think it should have been more fleshed out.

The exception to this is the lava levels, which are time limited. I really disliked this aspect of the game.

Controls are too unprecise - a single directional press will make the character move way too much. 

Something else that was almost good but ended up lackluster is the mana system. You can get spells to attack/defend which are okay, but you always have a movement spell that can keep you flying while you have mana. Again, this plays nicely with the combo thing! Unfortunately, you have little mana and only recharge by grabbing stuff on the ground. So it never really got anywhere, for me.

The extra coins being pointless, it would be cool to be able to invest them into mana or movement modifiers of some kind.

As it stands, the game can be a fun little distraction for 3 hours or so. But there are certainly good ideas here that would be nice to see in a more focused and fleshed out game.

◆ 敵を倒すことでコインを入手でき、更に主人公が地面に触れずに敵を連続で倒す事でコンボが発生し、入手できるコインの量が増えていく。主人公は空中で敵を倒すと再度ジャンプする事が出来るようになるのでこれを上手く決めていく事になる。必要数以上のコインを集めた場合、余ったコインは次回のステージに引き継がれるので、序盤のステージで多めに入手して後半を楽に進めることも可能になっている。

Правда есть нюансы, из-за которых я бы предложил вам брать игру по скидке.
Дело в том, что данная игра довольно однообразная в плане, того, что цель каждого уровня собрать нужное количество монет для перехода на следующий уровень. Уровни чередуются в двух видах: пройти от точки А до точки Б и убегать, поднимаясь вверх от смертного потока воды. 
Вторым нюансом является управление, на контролере от xbox 360 не задействовано движение на левом стике, вместо него управлять движением приходится крестовиной. Так, что советую играть с клавиатуры.
 В целом хорошая игра для убийства времени, но стоит учесть, что она может выбесить тем, что в ней требуется более-менее соблюдать точность, так как порой можно умереть только от того, что не правильно ударил врага.

+This is a really well made game. The controlls once fixed in steam are super responsive. 

+This game is not easy, and can be frustrating at times. But the gameplay is real rewarding once you figure out how to move through the level.


- If you start a new game you can not skip the intro dialogue, a real shame, because you bennefit from starting over (more coins)

- Password system like in megaman (write them down)

-This game is hard. You have to move fast, and often find yourself flying head long into an enemy.

I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GAME FOR THE LOW PRICE :)

[h1]エアリアルムーブが特徴的なステージクリア型2Dアクション[/h1]

　ギリシャ神話の世界をモチーフとしたステージクリア型2Dアクションゲームになります。生前の働きにより死後の楽園で永遠の休息を約束されていたLolaは訳あって、冥府よりオリュンポスのゼウスに会うため全6エリア構成のステージを踏破することとなります。生前と記載した通り、主人公Lolaは既に故人であり、仮初の力で肉体に辛うじて魂を定着されているに過ぎません。そのため、可愛らしいドット絵ながらもライフが0になると魂が肉体から抜けだしてしまいます。

　各ステージは概ね3つの種類に分かれています。規定のお金を集めてクリアするタイプのステージには、地面から接触で即死する床がせり上がってくる時間制限があるものと、時間制限はないがだだっ広いステージ内を自由に探索するものがあります。そして最後の1つはお金を集めなくてよいボスと戦うステージになります。お金を集めるステージでは、ステージの最後にカロンによってお金を徴収されますが、余剰金は次のステージに持ち越すことができます。但し、道中で死亡した場合は持ち金が0に戻されステージの最初からの再開になってしまいます。お金が0になる以外は特にこれといって大きなペナルティもなく、0になったからといってクリアできない難易度ではない点は上手く調整されていると思います。

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827235731

　アクション自体はとても軽快で操作性はすこぶる良好です。大股開きでピョンピョンSEが鳴りながら歩く様子も見ていて楽しいものがあります。アクションも二段ジャンプや壁つかみなどが用意されていますが、特徴的なのは空中浮遊挙動です。空中で敵を連続で攻撃していくと二段ジャンプの回数がリセットされ、敵を攻撃し続ける限り空を舞うことができます。その際、接地しない限りはコンボボーナスが計上されていきお金もジャラジャラ出てきます。また魔力がある状態で移動したい方向に入力し続けると、魔力を減らしつつ加速しながらその方向に移動することができます。かなり癖のある挙動なのですが、上手く使いこなすことによってコンボがどんどん決まってとても気持ちいいです。攻撃判定も心持ち広く取られており、背面などに若干の判定が発生していることもコンボを繋がりやすくさせています。


　オープニングの話だけを見ると踏んだり蹴ったりの主人公の境遇に何とも言えない気持ちになりますが、ゲームの内容自体は気持ちいいアクションゲームとして良くできています。2時間程度でクリアできるお手軽アクションを探している方は候補としてみてはいかがでしょうか。",1483344407,1483344566,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First off, the good things. 

Chaining together combos feels great, it makes you feel like a mighty warrior and bonus coins make the entire thing an incredible joy when the combo is over and you are rich. 

The exspansive, well put together levels that I loved to explore, running around and grabbing coins, fighting things, finding treasure rooms, all of that was great. If the whole game was just these levels, I would have so much fun with them.

Keeping your extra coins when you finish a level. A small thing, but it still felt really good. The game rewarded me for taking my time with a level, exploring all the nooks and crannies, and finding all the hidden treasure. It also created hope that eventually I would get so many coins that I could skip a level entirely because I can already pay the next fee. If I ever did this, it would have been amazing.

Now, the not so good things. 

Enemies That Take More Than One Hit. Now, I realize that eventually, there has to be an enemy that takes more than one hit, but this breaks the pacing of the game. Before you find an enemy, you're jumping around and racking up a huge combo, after you find the enemy the combo is over. Everytime I saw minotaur/ice warrior/lamia/wizard/turret head/thing that I couldn't kill in one hit I knew that the combo, which was the fun part, had ended. A nice work around for this would be if the higher a combo the player had, the more damage they deal. This would mean that the game rewards the player for working an Enemy That They Can't Kill In One Hit into their combo, instead of punishing them for finding it.

Terrain That Looks Like The Background. This was something I kept finding, and everytime I did it was confusing. Normally, the background is dark and what you can walk on is bright. This game has dark background, bright terrain, and darkish other terrain that you cannot jump up through. This becomes such a hassle, trying to check where you can and can't go, in moments when I'm trying to hurry because lava death is flooding the level.

Levels That Flood With Lava Death. These things were a massive cause of frustration, because of what these levels try to be. They are expansive, well put together that I would love to explore and collect all the coins, but they are on a timer. This means I cannot explore the level or I risk death, I cannot collect coins or I risk death, I cannot search for hidden treasure or I risk death, and I cannot blindly jump combo through the level just trying to finish it as fast as I can or I might not have enough coins by the end. One of two things needs to be removed from the rising levels, either the coin number or the timer. Having both turns the level into a stressful, memory game. The first run of a rising level, I told myself ""I am going to lose all my bonus coins."" I knew that I would win eventually, but only when I had run the level so many times that I knew exactly which way to go and where enough coins were.

Slippery, Slidey Shoes. This was a problem on two occasions, when I was pushing through a rising level, and when I was trying to avoid the next issue.

Touch Damage. I know that touch damage is a staple in videogames, that enemies are not things I should be getting near. However, I mostly only have melee and there are some enemies that don't make sense to deal touch damage, like birds that are trapped in them sized cages. The other place this becomes a problem is with bosses, because bosses can suddenly change the size and shape of their hitbox. This doesn't feel like taking damage, this feels like being robbed of a health point.

You Cannot Use Magic After A Double Jump. This sounds minor, and it is, but the thunder magic is the only way to increase melee damage and reset jump combos. When I find an enemy with two health in a jump combo, I use the thunder magic to kill it and continue the combo, unless I need to double jump to get to it in which case the combo ends.

That's mostly it, there's a few more things. The water magic felt worthless because you had to stop moving, the jumping attack was so much better than the standing attack that the standing attack felt worthless, exploring downward didn't feel good because I couldn't see what was under me and would frequently take damage because of that. 

So now, the final verdict, would I recommend this game?
NO. Don't get me wrong, there's some great ideas here, the game looks nice, parts of the game feel great, but there's so many little things that just wear on the player until the game becomes unfun. I can enjoy games that are challenging, when you win then that victory felt earned, not given, but this isn't challenging. It's frustrating. If the game was challenging, the player, if they are skilled and focus, be able to beat a level on their first try. They probably won't, but the possibility should still be there. With this, there's so many death that just came from things I couldn't see, or because I got stuck on terrain when trying to jump up, or because I took damage when I turned around to attack a stationary enemy.

Olympia Rising is a game about a hero named Iola who was killed by The Father of All Monsters, but has been reawakened and has to reach Olympus to talk to Zeus. She meets Charon, a greedy ferryman who agrees to help Iola get to Olympus, as long as she collects enough money every level.

Pros:
-Great Music
I love the music in this game. The main theme is really catchy, and gets me excited for playing the next level.
-Funny Characters
While I've only met Iola and Charon, I think some of Charon's dialogue is really funny. Sometimes I'd find myself throwing Iola into the next boss to hear Charon's next death joke.
-Fun Bosses
The bosses in this game are original and great, and while they can be hard at times, you understand why you died and you learn from it. The deaths are almost always fair and the ones that aren't are few and far between. I can't decide which boss is my favorite.
-Combo System
With each level concentrating on gathering money, the combos reward you with more money. The combos are fun to pull off.

Cons:
-Overpowered enemies
Some of the enemies, your main source of money, are incapable of being part of combos, certain enemies take 3-5 hits before you can kill them. This means you either finish your combos for the money, or ignore them.
-The Magic
The magic abilities are pretty much useless. The fire enchantment is ok for enemies you want to deal with from the distance, but the others do diddly-squat. I'd much rather use the magic for the double jumps.

While this game isn't perfect, the easy to learn gameplay, the music, and character(s?) have me coming back to play it every once in a while.

The inability to move the camera below you when you need to descend, resulting in numerous blind jumps and making the already annoying enemy placement all the more grating when exploring.

女にゃのこを操ってズバズバっと敵を切り裂いていくアクションゲームです。

ストーリーに関しては英語が読めないのでまったくわかりませんでした。

2段ジャンプに攻撃とシンプルなアクションで動きは軽快です、コインを一定数集めないとゴールに行っても最初からやり直しになります。
残機などはなく死ぬとそのステージの最初から何度でもやり直せます、ステージボスを倒すごとにＨＰが増えていくので中盤くらいが一番楽かもしれません、終盤はそれに似合う面倒くさいステージにコインを集める数も増えてきますがこのゲームは死なない限りコインは持ち越し可能なのでクリア可能より多めに拾っておいて次のステージも楽々クリアといった事も可能ですが死ぬとそのステージの最初から0枚からになります。

道中にスキルも少しあり、ＭＰを回復するアイテムやスキルアイテムをとるとＭＰを消化してスキルなども使えます、ＭＰを消化して連続ジャンプもできます、回復アイテムもありますが全快ではないので上手くとっていきましょう1ずつなんでｗ

ボスに関しては完全パターンでランダムはありませんので覚えさえすればラスボスですら余裕です。
ボリュームはトレカだすのに3時間ほど放置なので役2時間ちょっとでクリアなので短いです。

The animations and art are beautiful and feel fluid. The best part is when you chain enemy kills together and just continue to rise up fast, it is really satisfying. Sadly, the good things about this game end there.

The music was nice at first but then it got annoying when I had to replay the same level, repeatedly when I died. It is not too hard, but you are going to have trouble in some parts. This would be fine if the levels were not all pretty much the same but reskinned. The formula: normal level where you collect a specific amount of coins to beat it and then a similar level but just climbing up while acid is rising. Occasionally there is a boss fight, which I would describe as an endurance test. They are not hard since the boss patterns are predictable, but take too much time. The worst part about some levels is that money is scarce, so you better kill everything you see and try not to die before reaching the exit.

Still after all these flaws I was enjoying the game until, after like 6 times doing the same level again, the game glitched on me at the very end. I had just enough money and just rushed to the exit before something could kill me.

- It's cheap
- Graphics are wonderful
- Fluid animations
- Fluid and enjoyable combat

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- The camera's a bit too responsive. If I face the player left then right camera repositions immediately regardless of whether I'm moving or not.
- After you kill enemies coins don't always make their way to you which make the coin collection aspect in the air a pain.
- Bumping on the sides of platforms ruin your jumps.
- There's no option to exit the game in the menu.You either manually close the window or [Alt] + [F4].
- Awkward controls, you have to press down and attack to use magic...why not use another button?

Pros
+graphics

Cons
-floaty movement
-small weapon hitbox and larger enemy hitbox than the visible boundaries
-first boss is the most difficult enemy in the game...by several orders of magnitude
-coin collection as barrier to further levels 
-inability to pan camera
-password system (what is this, 1990? At least it looks cool)

This game would be great for things like speed runs, but due to the coin collection, you're forced to backtrack through branching paths. Backtracking wouldn't be so bad, but you can't pan the camera. I've taken many unnecessary hits as a result of this. I think a timer system (one that ticks down per level and one that ticks up throughtout the game for speed runs) would be a much better system for this game. I beat it in about 2 hours. It's enjoyable enough, but the faults will keep me from returning to it. Don't let the first boss get you down -- difficulty wise, it should've been the final boss. The bosses would even be a ton of fun if not for the rediculous hit boxes. Between enemies having too large of a damaging hitbox and the protagonist having floaty controls, I died more times than was reasonable to what I feel is poor design. Level design, sound, and music are really great. The art style is pleasant and unique. Try to pick this game up in a sale if you're on the fence. I think it's worth $5, but the cons truely are frustrating. I may sound overly negative, but I hope the dev will be watching the comments and improve. Maybe I'll come back to it one day in the hopes this is the case.

簡単に言うと「スコア稼ぎを強要される忍者龍剣伝」

動きはキビキビして楽しいんだけど
強制コイン集めにその楽しさを阻害されている感じ

ステージクリアにはコインを既定数集める必要があるのだが
雑魚敵もコインに換算される
つまり普通のステージではコイン集めに戻れるため
かなりのヌルゲーなんだけど
強制スクロール面では敵やお宝の取り逃がしが致命的となる

敵の配置もただ適当にばらけて撒いただけで
「こりゃダメ覚悟で飛ぶしかねぇ」というのが多い
しかしボス戦はあくびが出るほど単純で簡単だったりと
なんだかメリハリがなさすぎてクリアしようという気より
面倒くせぇもういいやって気のほうが大きくなってしまう

前ステージで余分に取ったコインは持越しされるけど
死ぬとゼロに戻る、新しいステージでは死んで憶えるのが前提なので
持ち越したコインもミスと同時に消えるため意味が無い

なにより本来、スコアアタックに使われるようなコイン収集を
強制でやらされるのは苦痛でしかなかった

The main focus here is definitely the combat, but it's designed in a way that feels pretty platformer-y as well. Killing an enemy gives you your two jumps back (reminds me of Dustforce in a way) and chaining enemies together using these extra jumps nets you more coins per enemy. The goal of each stage is to make it to the end with a certain amount of coins in tow, and the further the game progresses, the higher this number goes, and the longer the stages get. The end result is, unfortuntaely, a difficulty curve based mainly around level length, though each new world gives you an extra heart so you can survive a bit longer. Health pickups are more than sufficient, and tend to be very useful, as avoiding damage in this game is no easy feat. I never found myself having trouble getting enough coins either, if I searched around the level a little bit I ended up having more than enough. Coins can carry into the next level, too, but are lost if you die - I can see this making for some interesting speedrunning strats, certainly. I feel like this could be a pretty good speedrunning game, really, it's fast-paced and pretty challenging though never unfair. If I had to lodge a few other minor complaints, it *is* a bit short, but the game's not particularly expensive anyways. The wall jump also feels a little wonky at times (primarily around thinner platforms). I also found the music to not really fit, it's pretty forgettable and pretty minimal most of the time.

The core of the game in terms of the action gameplay for a 5 dollar game is solid: the flying mechanics and change up between fast/slow gameplay brings back feelings of the old NES games of days past. It's very good with level design and game design around the core of the game. But there's little things that annoy that start to add up, like the pausing of the game actually not pausing the game, and staying too committed to an NES like setup (with only using two buttons on the controller). But in the end, it's definitely worth the price of admission with solid gameplay and a good aesthetic even for a pixel platformer (that makes it stand out a tiny bit).

[b]Positives:[/b]
[list]
[*] Solid gameplay. Controls are fluid, sword swinging is responsive, and while there's some things to get use to in movement, rules are consistent.
[*] Flying mechanic adds a good unique mechanic that those who want to can really take advantage of in precision.
[*] Knew when to use typical platformer convention, and when not to, and that's hard with mechanics that you introduce. Very well done here.
[*] Good pixel art in terms of a style. Even though pixel platformers are a dime a dozen, the styles of the pixel artwork for enemies and your character work very well. 
[*] Faithful NES recreation in style and gameplay. Sound feels like it came from an NES game.

[b]Negatives:[/b]
[list]
[*] Pausing the game actually doesn't pause the game.
[*] Can't rebind controls. In particular, using down and x instead of another button for magic was annoying. This would be less problematic if the aerial element wasn't there: you have to use the dpad for a controller, and the stick would have made a LOT more sense..
[*] Um, exiting the game should be something that should be in the menu options. Even on the main menu. That's silly that it isn't.
