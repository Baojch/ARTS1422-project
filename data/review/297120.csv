I clocked most of my time during that time in 2015, then a little bit recently. I think I got my money's worth (sale + already cheap indie game) but I think my opinion on Heavy Bullets has remained the same: interesting idea, tedious in gameplay past the first two hours.

The only thing that's memorable about the game is its defining mechanic: if you shoot a bullet, it lands on the ground and you can pick it up again. The levels are just hallway mazes without changes in elevation and the challenge of the game relies on placing enemies at distance so it's harder to hit weakpoints and around corners as jumpscares. That would be fine if it was part of some bigger enemy pool and level design, but you essentially play the same encounter over and over again per run. There's some minute change in terms of enemy introduction if you're playing the game for the first time, but it's really insignificant.

The game is about 9 years old so I don't feel guilty spoiling the final boss: it's a monster that doesn't do anything in a narrow room of turrets and fodder enemies. You need to do a few runs to internalize the general pattern of the boss room because half the challenge is disabling the movement-hampering turrets so you can actually deal with everything else, then the other half is cleaning up the turrets. Again, you're essentially playing the same encounter over the course of each level.

Bad games are at least memorable because of the circus of errors that make up the game. Heavy Bullets is average and extremely forgettable; nothing about it is glaringly bad, but nothing about it is exceptional, unique, or interesting.",1702433732,1702433732,False,3,0,0.537484943866729736,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Not only that but I wish they would come back to this game and fix a few bugs and fine tune certain things that can sort of make people not enjoy the game so much.

For starters, its an FPS rogue-lite where you have a revolver with 6 bullets and when you shoot them you can pick them back up, which is a pretty cool concept. The graphics and details are simplistic but vibrant and there's not a lot of detail to levels and enemies overall but that's not a bad thing. If you're a fan of the Sludgelife OST you can say this is like a prequel to it, although I wish the music would play the whole time, since it only starts playing when you are in combat. The game has 8 levels (8 floors) in total that you have to do in one go, it lets you save and quit but only after you beat a floor. Overall its a pretty cool experience, its fun and I think you should give it a try!  

Ok, so whats wrong with it? Well...

I feel like this game has the same issue I had with Superhot MCD. Its a rogue-LITE. The rogue elements are there but it needs to be a little deeper at least for me to be able to enjoy it more than what it puts out.

I like the simplistic design of the game as a whole and everything, low poly is my jam, but you don't get a lot of difference between each level. The biggest difference is that it gets darker the deeper you go and you start to see a bit more panels with buttons on the wall and some pipes, but that's about it. If they can make each level a bit more distinct or at least change the color palettes or something, then it would keep you engaged as you see how much each floor changes (or at least make it look a bit more differently after reaching the midpoint). 

Not only that but I feel like the levels were a bit too long, I think if they would shorten the length of each floor by a bit, the game would have much better pacing and it wouldn't feel so detrimental to die in a run.

The enemy variety is fine, it ranges from animals to bugs to turrets... and damn, those turrets are killer. Sometimes they would shoot me as soon as they see me, other times it would take them a while and almost every time I try to peek the corner just so i can get a shot and kill it before it shoots me, 9 times out of 10 it always instantaneously shot me so i would take a hit. The hit-boxes for turrets are definitely funky on them sometimes when trying to kill them too, but it didn't happen to me that often with the regular turrets. [spoiler] However, when the game introduces the walking and even worse the flying turrets, the bugs started to show more, some turrets that walk/fly up to you would just shoot you every single time you peek a corner like if they had no cool down, which makes cornering encounters extremely dangerous.[/spoiler] Sometimes my bullets wouldn't kill them when I clearly shot them on their weak spot or they would somehow get to shoot me as soon as they died and end up hurting me. [spoiler] Not only that but there was certain occasions where 2 flying turrets somehow went inside the walls and started shooting at me, killing me and ending my run at floor 7. Not very fun! [/spoiler] There were also times where some turrets would be able to shoot me through the corners of the wall as I was trying to peak them so I can kill them, which happened to me so often that I ultimately didn't do that anymore and just tried to kill them as fast as possible when exposing myself to them. 

The midway boss and end boss do not change at all, which makes it lack in variety but at least doing them multiple times helps you learn a good strategy to kill them. [spoiler] There is also like a mini-boss in the 7th floor that you have to kill by hitting a switch in the room, that definitely caught me by surprise. [/spoiler]

You have 5 upgrades you can buy for yourself that permanently boost certain stats but I really didn't find a use in any of them besides for Maximum Health Upgrade and Reload+. Sometimes Carry+ but I never bought it for these reasons, you only have 1 inventory slot and you can only get a second slot if you find and purchase the backpack, which allows you to carry Items, but Carry+ does not affect the backpack but instead the individual items that go in the slots.

Some Items as well would of worked better off as just permanent upgrades instead of something you have to carry, like the scope could of just been something that attaches to your gun as soon as you find it, that would of been better then me having to choose between carrying a scope that zooms in or a potion that heals me, guess which one I went for. The same can be said for the different bombs and explosives, if I already have a slot for grenades, why not make me pick between swapping out my grenades for the mines I found or for the knife or for the homing bombs (which made no sense to me for having those specific items as carry items since it was just an upgrade to grenades). You can buy speed pills but again, that could of been a permanent upgrade. The same goes for the focus pills (they slow down time), just let me slow down time with the push of a button and have a bar that drains quickly while in use. 

I think the vending machines made sense and were a cool concept but sometimes the game wouldn't give you the vending machines you needed and would just spawn the same one 3 times in 1 floor. They could of at least made it that before you fight the boss, every vending machine was available to you in the room prior but instead you don't really get to prepare. So if you have 1 heart left and you are not close to a health vending machine, tough luck!

These are just the few problems I had with the game that I think, if ironed out, would make this a much more enjoyable and rewarding experience to play. Since the game is already difficult, these things just make it more frustrating because the consistency sometimes is not there. 

But Overall despite all the hardships, I did enjoy this game. I did want to come back to it and beat it. The game looks pleasing and it is also charming and challenging.

- 80~90년대 스타일의 배경과 그래픽.

- 맵에 배치된 은행 기기들을 통해 돈을 미리 저장해두면 죽은 다음에 모든 걸 잃어도 은행에서 돈을 빼내서 쓸 수 있는 시스템 : 덕분에 계속 특정 스테이지에서 죽어도 꾸준히 저축해두다가 한 번에 인출해서 아이템들을 할인가로 사서 좀 더 쉽게 도전하는 플레이가 가능하다.

- 가볍고 빠른 게임의 템포. 총기는 오직 하나뿐이고 탄피를 주우면 그걸 다시 총알삼아 쏠 수 있다. 다른 총기나 복잡하게 신경써야 할 건 별로 없다.

[h1]단점[/h1]

- 결국 운에 대부분을 의존해야하는 게임 구조 : 로그라이크니까 이 점은 장르적 특성이라고 볼 수도 있지만, FPS임에도 플레이어의 에임이 좋다면 좀 더 빠르게 클리어하거나 덜 피격당할 순 있어도 극적인 상황 뒤집기는 어렵다. 운이 없다면 의료 자판기가 도저히 나오지를 않는다거나 나와도 포션을 팔지않아 돈 내고 3회 힐에 의존해야하는데, 아무리 천천히 가서 스테이지를 어찌저찌 민다 쳐도 보스에서는 그게 안 먹힌다.

- 모르면 맞아야지식 구성 : 일단은 약점이 있는 적은 그 부위의 색이 다르다던가 하는 식으로 약점을 표시해주긴 했는데, 게임 내에서 전혀 알려주지 않는다. 피격의 리스크가 현실적인 FPS 급은 아니더라도 어느정도 있는 편인데, 모르는 개체가 나오면 게임 템포도 빠른 탓에 맞을 수밖에 없다. 원거리 공격을 하는 적들은 명중률도 높아서 어지간하면 피격되기 마련.

- 비직관적인 아이템 설명 : 이게 뭐 하는 아이템인지 인벤토리를 열어서 살펴보지도 못한다. 오직 액티브 / 패시브 여부만 알려줄 뿐 설명도 없어 스팀 가이드를 켜서 이게 무슨 아이템인지 정확히 무슨 효과인지 알아봐야 한다.

- 오래 하다보면 아파지는 눈과 어긋난 디자인 : 특유의 그래픽 탓에 눈이 쉽게 피로해진다. 심지어 수풀사이에 위장색으로 숨어있는 벌레까지 있어서, 그 그래픽에서 벌레가 있는지도 제대로 확인하고 가야한다. 이동속도가 굉장히 빠른 걸 생각하면 오히려 느리게 가야한다는게 아이러니하다.

[h1]총평[/h1]

난이도가 꽤 있는 로그라이크 FPS 게임. 심지어는 자판기들마저도 모조리 운이라 운이 없다면 제대로 뭘 해보기도 전에 끝나지만, 운이 좋다면 어찌어찌 보스까지는 갈 수 있다. 막상 그 보스는 패턴도 다양하지 않고 터렛과 잡몹 도배에 일차원적인 폭탄던지기뿐인건 아쉬운 부분. 그럭저럭 시간 때우기로 할 수는 있어도, 그 이상의 의미는 없을 것 같다. 75% 할인 때 사면 적당할 것 같은 가격.

You run, you shoot enemies, they die in one hit (although some of them might be tricky to hit), bullets you shot drop and can be picked up, and have to be picked up, otherwise you find yourself out of bullets.

There are two issues with that. First, it limits your approaches to the game. You will find yourself waiting for enemy to come closer before you kill them, because you always want bullets to drop nearby. This is also enforced by the fact that you virtually can't fight multiple enemies at once - all enemies are fast, and if something charges at you - you HAVE to kill it, otherwise you are going to be dead in a seconds. So you just lure them one by one, standing around a corner. Fun!

Another issue is that game claims to have roguelike elements, but the only roguelike thing game does is random levels. You virtually get no tools to add variety to how you do things. Like, you get bombs and rockets that help you fight enemies, but use 1-3 of those - and they are gone. There are also passive items, but there are very few, and you can only hold two at times (which also makes finding new stuff less exciting, knowing you have to leave something behind). The only way your character improves is getting more bullets, more health, and pickup radius. This obviously doesn't play well into having fun in continuous restarts of the game (which will be plenty, because you die FAST).

So, no, it is not worth its price. If you look into action based roguelikes - look no further than Risk of Rain 2. If you want FPS roguelike - even Tower of Guns would probably be better than this.",1681687188,1681687931,False,3,0,0.43415483832359314,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Back in 2014, however, they created this tiny little action roguelite, centered around ammunition scarcity, and a peculiar, minimalist aesthetic.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
[h2]PROS[/h2]
+ Interesting gimmick (sixshooter: you have to reload each bullet separately by mashing “R”, though you can get reload upgrades, to be able to reload more bullets at the same time
+ Very skillful, accuracy-based gameplay (in theory)
+ Interesting enemy ideas
+ Quite pleasant color palette, similar to Hyper Light Drifter

[h2]Neutral[/h2]
-) no item descriptions
-) few room and item variants
-) only two bosses (always the same)
→ less variety, but easier to learn

[h2]CONS[/h2]
- Weird hitboxes (especially on the turrets)
- Turrets and exploding enemies are way harder than any other enemy (uneven difficulty distribution); some enemies even blend into the background 
- Bad knife hitbox
- Small, weird bugs: [list]
[*] Random prompt to pick something up, that wasn’t there
[*] Shielding Enemies (Crawlers) sometimes shield after the bullet should’ve already stuck them, but it still deflects off of them (not good in a game with highly precious ammo counts)
[*] An enemy spawned right in front of me, as I entered a new floor once. Your screen is black for some time after you’re actually spawned in, and you start each floor staring at the ceiling, so it got two hits off on me.
[*] Momentary lag after killing an enemy sometimes (on a beefy rig!), even occurs sometimes while just shooting, and is particularly bad with [spoiler]flying turrets and the final boss[/spoiler]
[/list]
- Sparse graphical variety throughout the whole game (gets a little darker, and has slightly more tech and machinery haphazardly placed around the place towards the tail end of the experience, that’s it)
- Small amount of items
- Ludicrous prices at some shops, without money dropped from enemies scaling too much, if at all; sometimes a type of shop just straight up doesn’t appear for a while.
- The Random enemy spawns make for very inconsistent difficulty, even though the rooms are relatively the same
- Some useless/badly explained upgrades and items = like the magnet upgrades, which I see no reason for buying
- The bosses are bad. The first one suffers from the same hitbox issues as the turrets, and the second one is just enemy spam, that can, in my opinion, only be countered with HP upgrades and having a golden potion (best healing item in the game) on hand
- Janky stealth in tall grass
- Annoying enemy that hides in grass, and can sometimes poison you, basically putting you on death’s door a lot of the time, through one mistake (Snakeworm). Though, like Minecraft poison, it can only ever get you to half a heart, never kill you outright.
- Runs outstay their welcome; my winning run of the game was 44 minutes long

[h1]Longer Review[/h1]
[h2]Story[/h2]
The game takes place inside of a simulation. A little screen during the game’s startup sequence reveals a conversation, between two unidentified individuals working for a company named “Highrise Hunting Grounds”, on an emergency phone line together, who discuss sending the “janitor” over, to investigate a mysterious bug in the system mainframe, at level 8, which is “attacking customers”. They both explain how they’ll just advertise to anyone, that if they manage to do it, they get 5000$. They also, however, mention a high risk of death (one which they most likely obfuscate from the actual volunteers).
This tiny, and only, story excerpt sets up everything you need to know about what is occurring, particularly well. Even setting up a little intrigue, to make the player want to see what is causing the bug in the end.

[h2]Music And Sound Design[/h2]
The music is interesting, and discordant. An earlier, dare I say, more barebones effort by Doseone, who was responsible for music and SFX, and would later go on, two years after Heavy Bullets, to make the great soundtrack to Enter The Gungeon. Unfortunately the game only has two audio options, that you may tune in the menu: “Global Volume” and “Music Volume”, making it so that at any of the global volumes, from 1-10, the music is drowned out by the SFX. The music will also constantly, and dizzyingly stop, only to restart again, moments later. The music is alright on its own, its marriage with the gameplay, visuals and the context of the whole rest of the soundscape leaves a lot to be desired. The SFX themselves were simple and serviceable – no complaints there.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
You are thrust, immediately after pressing “New Game” and seeing or skipping the little story chatbox crawl, into the world of the “Highrise Hunting Grounds” simulation, armed with a sixshooter. The chambers of this revolver each have to be reloaded individually, and you only start with six bullets, which you have to pick up after each shot fired. You better make 'em count! You can acquire more bullets later, either by finding them on green item/pickup pedestals strewn about the maze-like world, or by buying them from vending machines. 
This is where the usual Roguelite mechanic, of carrying things over between runs, emerges. The game has a money and banking system. You will find shops in the form of vending machines everywhere, and often – but, alongside them, you may also find banks. Here, you can deposit or withdraw money, to buy things from the vending machines; most of which are very expensive, so you might get a leg up with that extra inheritance from the poor sod, who tried before you!
While this mechanic is quite interesting, and a fun, if simple variation on the “inheritance” mechanics of some other roguelites (Rogue Legacy comes to mind), it’s not quite enough to salvage the game for me. For while the experience is both frenetic and stimulating, it has also got a lot of monotony, through its lack of new visual stimuli or more interesting gameplay mechanics, past the first “huh, interesting banking system” and “huh, interesting weapon”. The upgrades and items are boring, and apart from increasing max health (which you’ll usually find yourself too short on cash for), or Reload upgrades, will not really provide you with much value, certainly nothing “spicy”.
“Nothing spicy” also goes for the game’s secrets, marked by tiny “X”s on the walls, similar to The Binding of Isaac’s tinted rocks. One, which I found, on my last run of the game featured the message “All the rocks here look the same”, which sums it up pretty perfectly for me: the game’s developers can make on-the-nose jest about their game’s shortcomings, but never, in the past 9 years, took the time to address them.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
“Nothing spicy” could actually be my tagline for Heavy Bullets: from the janky enemies of highly variable difficulty, to the often frustrating, random enemy placement and other things, which make your runs contingent, to some extent, on RNG; to the same drab environments making me feel like I’m going insane at times, the enjoyment of Heavy Bullets, to me, is very finite. The game’s overall jankyness (which is inexcusable in places) holds it back from me recommending it in 2023.
I’m not surprised, as it is the developer’s first major effort, and was pretty solid for 2014, a time when modern Indie game development was still learning how to crawl for the most part, but it couldn’t keep my attention. Not now, having revisited it on a whim, nor last time, when I played it for a few hours in 2015.

Either way, despite all the flaws:

⚜️Так как это рогалик, тут очень хороший рандомайзер локаций и т.д.

[h1]Минусы[/h1]
🛑Графика уж очень режет глаза, слишком простая.
🛑Управление, хоть и наиграл 4 часа но иногда чисто машинально, жмёшь пробел или шифт, чтобы прыгнуть или убежать, а по итогу вы бросаете гранату или используете предмет из ивентаря.

""Heavy Bullets"" von Terri Vellmann und Devolver Digital bricht mit diesen Konventionen und präsentiert sich als ein minimalistischer Shooter, der auf einzigartige Weise fesselt. In dieser Review tauchen wir in die Welt von ""Heavy Bullets"" ein und erkunden, warum dieses Spiel ein Meisterwerk der Einfachheit ist.

[b]Grafik und Präsentation:[/b]
""Heavy Bullets"" unterscheidet sich deutlich von anderen Shootern durch sein minimalistisches Design. Die Spielwelt besteht aus schlichten geometrischen Formen und lebendigen Farben. Dieses minimalistische Design zieht den Spieler in seinen Bann und schafft eine unmittelbare Verbindung zur Spielwelt. Die klaren Linien und leuchtenden Farben tragen zur Übersichtlichkeit bei und fügen sich nahtlos in das Gesamtbild ein.

[b]Sound und Musik:[/b]
Der Soundtrack von ""Heavy Bullets"" ist ebenso minimalistisch wie das Design des Spiels. Die elektronischen Klänge und subtilen Beats erzeugen eine surreale Atmosphäre, die die Spieler in ihren Bann zieht. Die Soundeffekte sind präzise und dienen dazu, die Spieler in die Welt des Spiels zu versetzen.

[b]Spielmechanik:[/b]
Das herausragende Merkmal von ""Heavy Bullets"" ist sein einzigartiges Waffen- und Munitionssystem. Der Spieler beginnt mit einer begrenzten Anzahl von Kugeln, die nach jedem Schuss manuell aufgesammelt werden müssen. Dies schafft eine ständige Spannung und erfordert taktisches Denken. Das Spiel zwingt den Spieler, seine Ressourcen klug zu verwalten und sorgt so für eine intensive Spielerfahrung.

Die prozedural generierten Level von ""Heavy Bullets"" bedeuten, dass keine zwei Durchläufe gleich sind. Dies fördert die Erkundung und Experimentierfreude, da der Spieler nie genau weiß, was ihn erwartet.

[b]Geschichte und Atmosphäre:[/b]
Die Handlung von ""Heavy Bullets"" ist minimal und dient hauptsächlich als Rahmen für das Gameplay. Die Atmosphäre des Spiels ist jedoch fesselnd. Die ständige Bedrohung durch feindliche Kreaturen, das begrenzte Inventar und die unberechenbaren Level sorgen für anhaltende Spannung.

[b]Fazit:[/b]
""Heavy Bullets"" ist ein eindrucksvoller Beweis dafür, dass weniger manchmal mehr sein kann. Das Spiel präsentiert ein minimalistisches Design, das den Spieler in seinen Bann zieht, und ein einzigartiges Munitionssystem, das für intensive Spannung sorgt. Obwohl die Geschichte und die Grafik schlicht gehalten sind, überzeugt das Spiel durch sein unkonventionelles Gameplay und seine fesselnde Atmosphäre. Für Spieler, die nach einer einzigartigen Shooter-Erfahrung suchen, ist ""Heavy Bullets"" eine lohnenswerte Entdeckung und ein Beweis dafür, dass Simplizität und Einfachheit oft die tiefgreifendsten Erlebnisse schaffen können.",1672631686,1698842865,True,4,0,0.583333313465118408,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Not a roguelike - after death you get no upgrades, you can only carry over some of your money to buy upgrades during next run, which are: max health, max ammo, magnet range, consumables like healing potion or few-seconds slow motion.
So the game is mostly about carefully exploring rooms trying to get as little damage as possible.
Seems to have no replay value, no permanent upgrades, so it will be somewhat fun for 2-5 hours, until you beat the game or get tired of trying.
Most monsters die from one hit, health gets costly to restore, you will lose most health either to snakes ambushing in the bushes or random weakling attacking you while you run around turret aiming for it's weakspot - it can't hit you while you are moving. So any run itself is not much fun.

Items are found or bought from vending machines, but from experience, nearly every item and explosive is really bad and the main item i would keep on me were potions or slow-mo pills.

The game can be beat on the first try if you get very lucky or play cautiously, and because there's no real progression system, aside from the banks you can store money and items or buy items that let you bring some of that coin to your next run, every run starts fresh. My only real complaint about the game is the full price and content. $10 is kinda steep in my opinion, but i guess in 2014 this type of game didn't have alot of competition like it does now with 100's of fantastic roguelikes. Its a one off honestly, i have no desire to replay it after finishing, but i enjoyed my time even if it was short.

I wasn't quite sure if I should write a review for the almost 8 year old game or not. Then I thought why not. It's not a bad game, so...

[b]But before we start:[/b]

Neon mode: 🔲 off ✅ on
LSD mode:⠀  🔲 off ✅ on

The mainframe in the company Highrise has gotten out of control, but unfortunately it is not around the corner, but on the eighth basement floor. So there is a small path ahead of us that we will tackle with a six-shot pistol. But there's a little catch. Ammo costs money and cannot be bought everywhere. But the fired ammunition can be picked up again so you don't really have to worry at first because it only gets a little tighter on the fifth floor.

I found the low-poly landscape with the, let's just call it quite daring visual style that resembles a neon LSD trip, took some getting used to at first. But then it went quite quickly until the eyes got used to it and it also gets a bit darker or redder with later levels. I didn't take screenshots this time because I think that a still picture isn't meaningful in this case and it gives the impression that it's a lifeless game. I find what is shown on the store page is meaningful enough.

I would say that [b]the gameplay is comparable to a shooter in the classic sense[/b]. Most opponents can be killed with a well-aimed shot, but there are also defense towers where you should hit the energy tank and also opponents who can only be done with a well-aimed shot in their backside. A bit of dancing skill, especially if you're wearing the right high heels, isn't necessarily a bad thing. And you'll find out exactly what the heels are all about in the game, or you can just take a look at the achievements for the game.

As I see it or understand it, [b]the levels are randomly generated[/b]. This means that if you die and have to start over, the path to the exit and also the opponent (position) will change and the gameplay will vary greatly. And even if Heavy Bullets is a fairly fast game, you should proceed carefully because you can very often encounter snakeworms that hide in bushes of the same color and are not only harmful but also have the property of poisoning the player. So always pay attention to the ground!

As already mentioned, you can buy additional ammunition. But that's not all. Everywhere there are vending machines where you can buy other weapons or medicines in addition to ammunition. If you buy a backpack, you get another slot and can carry another item with you. At ATMs you can also deposit the money that each defeated opponent leaves behind as booty, so to speak, into your account or buy “your last will”. This ""last will"" has the advantage that it is not only available in the current game, but also after death. This means that the inventory and upgrades are inherited. Another alternative is life insurance, which you can also buy. Unlike the last will, this does not inherit the inventory, but in the event of death, it pays a portion of the coins captured up to that point to your account. Furthermore, there are some (hidden) bonus items in the levels. It is therefore worth taking a close look all the more.

I recommend you, at least those who are looking for it or value it, to [b]take a closer look at the achievements before you start playing.[/b]

Technically I had no problems with Heavy Bullets.

[h1] WTF was that?[/h1]

Hyeavy Boolets is a game where you play as John Night Runner, a man on a mission tasked with ridding an alien species from a maze like labyrinth space-station. The alien has changed most of the creatures in this natural habitat into genuinely terrifying creatures. The game proves that you don't need high end graphics to make a game scary, you don't even need to make horror the main aspect of the game. Equipped with 6 bullets, and 3 bombs, John Night Runner must make use of limited resources to fight against this horde of mind controlled mutated animals, and automated defenses made solely to kill anyone not recognized. Such as John Night Runner. Why didn't you get equipped with something to turn over the defenses? The aliens must be blocking the signals. That's  the only explainable reason. And at the end of the game, through many technicoloured trials, you, like most Americans inact a hate crime, on what may be the only remaining individual of an alien species, effectively committing genocide with your best friend, Gun.

[h1] What's this Game have to Offer?[/h1]

A cool experience awaits you in this game, like most Devolver Digital games. Your gun is reloaded one bullet at a time, with you needing to pick up each bullet to get back your extremely limited ammo. As a shooter and a roguelike, you must get used to aiming very quickly and landing your shots, the reticle as such is tiny, and your boollets do not stray. Like most shooters, the game relies on sound. It's crucial for your survival to have your sound on. As every creature will first alert you by screaming at you, before turning into fucking nightmare fuel and rushing at you at high speeds, following you around corners and more. Like every small crawling child in every horror movie ever. You can spend money and sell items at vending machines, as well as blowing up vending machines, to boost your future runs, or help you on your current one. It's more of a true roguelike, you can save bullets, money, bombs, and a single item in between runs. But no permanent unlocks to protect your run from restarting to zero with the slightest mistake. A challenge that is quite awesome to run. And different runs grant some pretty easily completed achievements. The music good, obviously Doesone knows how to jam.

[h1]  TL;DR [/h1]

It's a rush of action, a bumb in the night, a jam to chill out too, and a challenge to be bested.

From brilliant music and visuals to engaging moment to moment gameplay, it's truly a unique experience for any fan of Roguelikes, First-Person Shooters, or just fun times in general. The combat feels tight and responsive, the enemies feel varied enough to present unique challenges while not being so complex that you need to think about something other than shooting them, and the items add a pleasant spice to gameplay to change up your runs a little each time.

There are only two major issues with this game that I can warn about. One is technical while the other is more gameplay related.

The first is the stutters the game suffers from. These really throw off your flow sometimes and can lead to you getting unfairly hit if you're not prepared to deal with them. However, they barely last a tenth of a second and aren't too intrusive.

The second is the scale of the game. With only eight floors that take about 2-5 minutes to clear each (once you get some experience under your belt), Heavy Bullets really leaves you hungering for more where it really can't provide. It seems like it has a ton of potential that it'll never reach, but this doesn't take away from the gameplay at all. It's still incredibly fun, if short and sweet.  

Lastly, strangely enough Heavy Bullets can be a very calming game. With all but two enemies requiring no more than a single bullet to kill, once you get more experienced, you can sit back, hunt monsters and chill out to the unique soundtrack as you glide from room to room.

You have a revolver and must make it down to the mainframe to reset.
Along the way you have enemies that will kill you. You fight back to protect yourself and get money from their dead body to buy items and upgrades. You can also find secrets in the game for unique items.
There are a decent amount of enemy variety. with those that will chase you and others that are stationary.
The game only has 8 levels, 2 of which has a boss fight which makes it a nice a short game. Can be beaten in 25 minutes, but if you're exploring the level for items it will take at least an hour. The game floors randomize each time making your playthroughs different each time.

I quite enjoy the game, it's fun if sometimes getting cheap deaths.
The game rewards you for being methodical approach to exploring the floor, good planning and strategy, for reacting fast, having the right items, and most importantly accurate shooting. The game isn't overly difficult to get through once you got your game plan.
The items you find are either useful or not as useful as expected. I highly recommend that you look up a guide on what they do so you can make an informed decision on the items you pick up, because some items you pick up have negative consequences.
The gunplay and mechanics are fun and it's very important that you put the correct settings for you, because if you got the wrong sensitivity setup your aim will suffer greatly as you try to compensate for your aim.

Overall I like the game, and having it be a rogue-like game with each floor having a different layout with enemies scattered around gives it nice replay value. Could it be improved? It could have some more enemy variety types, more interesting items to play with, some more unique environment(but then again the theme of the game is you're trying to get to a mainframe in some weird corporate building, so it doesn't make sense to have weird hazards). I would really like to see them have co-op in the game where you and another player and try to get to the mainframe.

Would I recommend it? Yeah sure it's a good game that you can boot up once in a while to play to try and beat it.",1642581417,1642581417,True,2,0,0.539170503616333008,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The gimmick of this game is that once you shoot your gun you have to go and collect the bullets for reuse because you'll only have a handful of bullets on you at a time.

I really enjoyed this because it really made me plan my actions a few steps ahead and kept me on the edge of my seat as I was always one wrong decision away from a game over.

This game is not without it's flaws though. Much of the area of play is randomly generated and similar colors, making it very easy to get lost in the mazelike maps. Many of the special items available to the player also seem to make very little difference to the game. Many items had very situational, almost unhelpful effects like throwing bombs slightly further or simply just taking up space in your inventory and being meant to be sold for a decent price. On top of this, you can only have one active item on you at a time meaning that you can't even collect a good amount of these and grow in power and have a ""god run"" like so many other roguelike games will allow you to do. This is not inherently a negative, though, it just means that how good you do will be more dependent on how well you know the game's enemies and items.

Overall, I think the Heavy Bullets is a game with a fun core but some unnecessary or unhelpful elements that can serve to distract from the experience. I think it has a really cool art style and it's definitely not easy! If you like roguelikes or difficult games I'd check this one out :)",1635300938,1635300938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

When you get in the zone and just nail 6 enemies with 6 shots, sweeping through and picking up all the bouncy pieces, it's really satisfying. It's focused, consistent, limited in scope and has a solid aesthetic to it - definitely worth your time.

Personally, I do have the stutter issue, had it on previous gaming rigs too, and it's not been so bad as to make the game unplayable. But it can definitely hurt your experience enough to make the game not worth it, so just watch for that.

What most hurts the game IMO is some inconsistencies with the general design. Turrets can shoot you either after a second or more of waking up, OR they can just instantly fire off a shot right between your eyes seemingly before they've even turned around. Your bombs barely move when you throw them and more often than not blow up in your face due to turret fire - for an item that's part of your basic gear, they do more harm than good, and go underutilized. Poison is a poorly implemented mechanic that seems to apply solely to a single enemy which is one of the most annoying and pervasive in the game. An enemy that already ambushes, damages and disorients you to begin with, which is quite enough. But the poison effect is rarely applied by their attacks, and it usually goes away after doing 1/2 heart of damage, making the effect too minor to justify wasting your only inventory slot on an antidote.

I just feel like some pieces of the game lack a certain level of polish and design effort that would take this game to the next level. There aren't a lot of moving parts here, and I really feel like it could use an extra layer or two of depth, and a bit more time in the oven to tighten things up.

[b] Gamplay: [/b]
Pretty standard stuff for an FPS, you aim the mouse and click to shoot, the main difference being the reload mechanics and different items to help you, and hurt you, alongside a couple of enemies that behave very differently from one another. 
As the game title suggests, the bullets you pew pew are so heavy you can reuse them on the one-hit enemies. There are also upgrade mechanics to help you reload, max out your health, carry more items and pick-up coins and bullets.  
The variation on enemies is little, but very effective and fun. Each have their own sounds, look and attack, so you can quickly react to each enemy type once you get fast and accurate with your shots (although sometimes, the enemies spotted me through the walls and got in a few cheap shots, but for most of the time I could react before the damage).
The rooms are procedurally generated, which adds to the replay value of the shooty shoot game.
The difficulty feels nice and achievable to master since it is so easy to pick up, more so if you are experienced with the genre.

[b] Art-Style: [/b]
I love the low-poly style in every asset and the use of a cold palette for the environments, enemies and most of the items is very well implemented. 
I usually don't like gradients, but this game does them really well and I didn't get tired of the colors and rooms and enemies. 
The sounds and quick bites of music are also really satisfying; Don't how to describe them but feel very bit-crushed and slowed down. It sounds pretty neat.

[b] Story & Characters: [/b]
Not a whole lot here. I think you are a janitor that took up the task of rebooting an infected system, which combine really well with the sounds and colors. 
There are only two characters that chat at the beginning and end of the game, who gave me the vibe of bumbling, clueless guys, just like me!

[b] Achievements: [/b]
Most of these are fun in concept, but they are almost all based on RNG. You must hug the wall to discover secret items that my not alway appear in different runs, so you mostly rely in luck rather than skill to 100% the game.
Patience is a must if you want all the achievements, but there aren't a lot of them so that's cool.
OH! There is also a very cool achievement to ""speedrun"" the game in 25 minutes, meaning you must do all 8 rooms in 4 minutes (approximately), which makes it very satisfying when you go below that quarter! That's a pretty cool skill cap.

[b] TL;DR [/b]
Easy to pick-up and satisfying to master. Nice colors and quick replay value!

There are items and upgrades, but the gameplay stays consistent for the most part and anything that changes how the game plays can be dropped (hold E or whatever key you have set to open doors and pick up items) or sold, so there's no commitment.

I will say this game needs more content to help make it feel like every playthrough is different that you can have a tiny spreadsheet with item in the game while compared to Binding of Isaac, Dead Cells, and Gungeon there is a lot of different items that can change the outcome of every playthrough. Also finding the secret items was annoying that some walls have an ""x"" on them and others don't. Finally the final boss was disappointing compared to the first boss.

HB is easy to dip into and out of, but I'm reluctant to describe it as casual: you're a janitor tasked with traversing a vaporwavesque safari cyberscape  populated by feisty critters and indiscriminate security turrets. Survival here requires speed, accuracy, and more than a little corner-peeking. Bullets are scarce, but retrievable and reusable. Everything dies in one hit, but consecutive misses are costly. 

HB's light narrative serves as a gentle capitalist critique, and this theme undergirds the game's second novelty:  a banking system in which cash deposited in one run can be withdrawn in a subsequent one postmortem. Money can be exchanged for precious bullets, additional lives and all manner of other equipment, and it's hard to beat the game (I've never done it) without a little starting wealth. Adjacent mechanics include a 'last will' and a life insurance system. 

Whilst enemies are numerous, varied and quick off the mark, they are all a little stupid. This is a  conscious design decision that makes sense for the game, but it also invites tedious strategies like backpedalling and waiting for a cluster of dimwitted imps to charge you in a straight line one after another. It's not game-breaking, but it doesn't really fit with the overall feel of the game, which generally rewards carefulness in conjunction with quick reflexes and accuracy. In any case the game is still hard: in 25 hours of play I've made it to the final boss a handful of times, and never lived to tell the tale.

[list]
[*]Micro-stutter: Frequently, the game just drops frames. This isn't a hardware issue; it was reported and acknowledge as far back as 2014, but was never fixed.
[*]Mouse-lock: After starting the game, the mouse will usually be unlocked from and out of sync with the camera, even in fullscreen, making targeting nearly impossible. This can be temporarily fixed by jacking around with FOV settings, but if you have the issue once it will return every time you start the game.
[*] AI clipping: Monsters appear to randomly gain the ability to clip through walls. It's unclear if this is actually frames dropping while an enemy is properly pathing, but the effect is the same - a monster not there a second ago is now spontaneously chewing on your face.

[b]Симулятор пострелушек из-за угла с рандомизованной зачисткой кустов[/b]

[h1]Положительное:[/h1]
+ [b]Визуальная стилизация вкусная[/b], но специфичная, можно даже сказать на любителя. Вся графика игры выстроена из мощностей движка (поэтому, игра весит 200 мб), но картинка довольно простенькая, хоть и стильная. 
+ [b]Пиу-пиу из револьвера[/b] делать приятно. Стреляет он точно, быстро и мощно, все враги отлетают от одного попадания (но револьвер МакКри получше будет). Необычная механика - вручную подбирать и перезаряжать каждую выстреленную пулю, по сути, ваши патроны бесконечны, пока вы их вовремя собираете.
+ [b]Требовательна к меткости[/b], те буквально, чем ты точней, тем легче/быстрей проходишь игру. Однако, частенько у тебя есть возможность пострелять ракетами, покидать бомбы и сделать чик-чирик ножичком, но вот тут начинаются проблемки...
+ [b]Полезный саунддизайн[/b] позволяет индентифицировать присутствие врагов, монет, пуль, магазинов. У музыки проблема со сменяемостью/своевременностью. Треки вроде задорные, но ничего кроме [b]BANG-BANG![/b] магазина вспомнить не могу (хотя играл 5 минут назад).

[h1]Отрицательное:[/h1]
- [b]Низкая вариативность[/b], сомнительный рогалик эта игра. С 1го по 8й уровень ты гарантированно встретишь все виды врагов, все типовые комнаты. У игры, на самом деле, нет реиграбельности, есть только подобие, ввиде банка (куда между сессиями можно закидывать доллары и целый 1 (!) предмет) и генерации типовых уровней. Те, пройдя игру единожды, в ней делать нечего, откровенно говоря.
- [b]Отстойная система предметов[/b]. По базе ты можешь носить только 1 предмет в ограниченном количестве (например, только 2 одинаковые пилюли в руках, больше ничего). Хочешь больше - качай количество за доллары, покупай рюкзак, чтобы носить целых 2 (!) предмета. А что можно носить? Аптечки, нож, мины/ракеты/бомбы, пилюли, завещание и артефакты (в основном, пассивные свойства слегка меняющие геймплей). В игре практически нет комбинаторики.
Большинство предметов бесполезно, особенно атакующих. У тебя есть мощный и точный револьвер убивающий всех врагов с одного выстрела, тебе не нужны бомбы, мины, ракеты и все их вариации в игре, тк они работают плохо и нестабильно, не говоря о том, что ими легко подорвать самого себя (а ещё, если ты получишь пулю, пока в руках держишь бомбу - ты взорвёшься). Большинство артефактов же влияют на геймплей слишком слабо, чтобы вообще их брать с собой. Вот и получается, что носишь ты с собой только аптечки да  пилюли (краткое замедление времени) или завещание, если дела идут плохо.
- [b]Тупые и сломанные враги[/b]. Все враги просто ждут пока ты появишься в поле зрения, как только заметили - и тупо прут вперёд на тебя (если есть ноги) и стреляют (если есть чем стрелять). Местные турельки знают о твоем положении несмотря на стены и стреляя по кулдауну в направлении тебя (даже если не должны видеть), тут и начинается это дёрганье от угла к углу. Со стенами вообще в игре проблемы, то взрывы сквозь ""непроницаемую"" стену пройдут, то монетки проедут, то враги ""почувствуют"".
Отдельно хочется упомянуть местных змей розового цвета, впиханных в каждый второй розовый куст, что развивает параною у игрока и бесконечную стрельбу по кустам. 
- [b]Декоративный фонарик[/b]. На 5м уровне тебе дают фонарик и ты такой ""ВО! теперь будет выживание во тьме, механики освещения, заметность/незаметность, игра свето-тени, вот это всё!"" Нет. Тебя обманули. Тебе просто дали фонарик светящий розовым светом. Ни на что в игре это не влияет, хоть +/- стильно выглядит. Враги видны всегда, хоть свети - хоть не свети на них.

[h1]P.S.[/h1]
Долго думал, как оценить эту игру. С одной стороны, у неё неплохой, напряженный и скилозависимый геймплей. С другой, он напряженный и интересный только в первую игровую сессию, а затем рутина с повторением одних и тех же паттернов.

dislikes: 
-the snakes!!! they're the same color as majority of the plants in the game so they hide in them making it tough to spot out when you are moving, meaning your going to spend so much time just slowly examining your surrounding, halting momentum. this sucks

-the slippery movement, it feels like your on ice. moving and shooting is ridiculously annoying to actually pull off right. in a shooter movement is important but when you move like your walking on a slip n slide it sure feels weird.

-lack of info on items, you'll get some passive item- cool! does not even give you a smidge of info about what it does, like the binding of isaac does it and even if its vague you have a noticeable diff of what it changed. here its just all vague

finally what i like:

What. A. Shame.
If it didn't give you an achievement for dying once, I'd have refunded this, as the stutter and frame rate skips are just THAT bad.

The first and most obvious is to have really engaging gameplay, like fun combat, exciting movement, or clever tactical options. The second is to just give it a ton of depth, I mean tons of systems or complex mechanics or a boatload of unlockables, all to give players something to focus on in their misadventures. My problem with Heavy Bullets is that it doesn’t seem to do either. The gunplay is competent but slow and methodical, practically the antithesis of the FPS genre. And there’s very little new to look forward to in subsequent runs, with little in the way of items to find or systems to master. Heavy Bullets needs more to keep me invested, plain and simple, and it’s just not there.

Don’t get me wrong, I love the premise. You’re one of a legion of janitors in a high-rise indoor hunting ground for the wealthy and decadent. Thing is, something went wrong with the security system and it’s started gunning down the wrong sorts of people. Nobody with any authority wants to risk their neck to get past the scads of automated gun turrets and reset the system, so the executives have put a reward out for anyone willing to do the deed. This might just be your ticket out of this dead-end dystopian job, which is why you’ve taken up your thick-ass company revolver and set off into the hunting grounds. And if the turrets or the wildlife get you, there’s always another hot-blooded janitor waiting in the wings.

The hunting grounds themselves are a tangle of vibrant hallways and dark foliage, like a laser tag arena that’s been viciously overgrown. Levels are roughly linear but the actual shape and connections of hallways are randomized, so you’ll be taking different twists and turns each run despite always heading in the same direction. You’ve got eight levels to descend through to reset the security system, and while there might not be too many differences between their neon gradient walls, the threats lurking within them do indeed change. Early on you’ll face toothy imps that charge you, poisonous snakes that lie in wait under bushes, and automated turrets that can lock onto you in an instant. Later the foes get leggier, denser, and more deadly, adding explosive critters and security systems with even smaller weaknesses.

None of these foes are very complicated to deal with, because you don’t have any complex tools to deal with them. Your main weapon (and only weapon, most of the time) is a revolver that fires six meaty bullets, bullets of such stature that they bounce off of foes after disintegrating them and must be scooped back up to re-use. Seriously, you start with six bullets, and the only way to get more is to buy them from vending machines or pray they appear as random rewards to grab. It’s not an issue early on because you can pop the one or two enemies in a room and then recover your rounds, but later you’ll need a deeper reserve to deal with more densely-packed rooms. You do also have a small supply of grenades, and vending machines and rewards also offer one-off weapons like rockets or mines to occupy your single item slot, competing with other consumables like health potions and passive boosters.

Aside from some purchasable upgrades from vending machines and the ability to bank cash and items for future runs, that’s it for the mechanics of Heavy Bullets. The bullet recovery gimmick is notable, but not all that different from grabbing pickups from fallen foes in any other FPS to keep going. What it really means is that every shot must be careful and deliberate, and enemies tend to either be stationary or bee-line towards you to make ammo conservation easier. There’s no running and gunning here, as charging forward will just get you iced by turrets. It shares its pace with something like Void Bastards, except there’s nowhere near the same level of interactivity or exploration to help balance out the pace of the game.

I think that’s what’s so disappointing about Heavy Bullets, the fact that it compares unfavorably to just about any other FPS you care to mention. The look and feel is similar to something like Receiver, but not built around anything nearly as compelling as the gunplay in that game. There’s no verticality or setpieces to any of the levels, but even something like Bunker Punks did more with that formula with gear to manage and more strategic choices. I wouldn’t say the core of the game is actually bad, but it doesn’t provide a compelling reason to play it over anything else in the genre. It’s a shame because I really do like the concept, and the satisfying THUNK of fat bullets against enemies doesn’t get old. I just wish there was anything else to invest in here besides that.

As a roguelite, Heavy Bullets only achieves the bare minimum,and then less.it consists of randomly generated levels ,a shop system, some items, and hard as balls enemies.however, unlike most roguelites. the level layout is almost entirely random. with only some elements reused throughout each run. this means that any system you encounter during one run, like a shop or item. has a high chance of straight up not being present on the floor at all on your next time around. this gives the floors a sense of unreliability , as you have no idea what will be on each floor, ruining the sense of predictable unpredctability that most roguelites have. everything else is nothing to write home about, your typical shop system, unintresting items. the whole lot.

as a shooter, it fails to be compelling whatsoever. the gunplay is very barebones ,with weak sounds and a lack of impact. repetitive enemies and strategies. the concept of reusing your bullets is neat, but it feels more cumbersome than practical as you progress. the enemy design is where it gets juicy however:as most enemies are very basic in terms of design. to compensate for this, the enemies move or act extremely quickly. unfortunatley they act so quickly that most of the time if there are multiple enemies you don't have even a second to think about how you're going to tackle a situation before having to hide behind a wall. not like it matters. as most charging enemies can be easily defeated by luring them behind a wall and just going to town.


The way Heavy Bullets is designed makes every single important aspect feel like an afterthought, despite being the forefront of the experience. it feels like multiple systems from multiple games were cobbled together in an attempt to make something cohesive, and it falls flat on its face at almost every turn. but hey at least it looks pretty

poison is awful, one attack shouldn't have the ability to deal damage multiple times

Everything about the aesthetic, to the difficulty, to the sound design and graphics are abrassive while being unique and really pleasing to look at and experience. It's a feast for the senses as it is for the mechanics. 

Heavy Bullets is the rougelike experience distilled to solid but simple mechanics and an equally simple premise. You're tasked with resetting the mainframe controlling the security systems of ... wherever in the hell you are, whilst dodging death and polygonial creature alike. 
There's one essence of permanency and that's in the money - you gain money from fragging monsters or contending with any of the rogue turrets or anything else you encounter in the maze - you can bank this for future attempts. There's also items like Life Insurance and Last will that'll perserve your items for the next run. It's very sparse on items but thwat's their serves their purposes well and keeps the loot pool from feeling overcrowded - a problem I find with many other games of this type. 

A big factor of games like this is also the difficulty, as of writing I haven't been able to conquer the maze but Iv'e gotten consistant at staying alive and banking money and buying suitable upgrades at around 4 hours of play-time so far, with my practice backing me up I haven't found many areas where the game was unfair. It's balanced as hell on top of it. 

The biggest detractor I can see is the high price point, at $10 the game still amounts to 8 levels in total and I've seen speedruns totaling out to mere minutes. It's absolutely a game recommended for those vested in the genre, or those willing to pick it up on sale - of which I had. Totally recommended under the circumstance of a sale, hell - I'd recommend it if your just looking for something new at all.

The main mechanic is your limited ammo. You start a run with only 6 bullets. The thing is, you can pick up your bullets after shooting them. You can buy more bullets from shops, but you're still going to want to be careful of how much you shoot.

Along with buying bullets from the vendors, you can buy things like health, items, and upgrades. Unfortunately, like every other FPS roguelite, this game has also had to choose between good gunplay or good run variety. There is little to no run variety in this game, even the level generation is lacking! Instead, it has some fantastic gunplay requiring more precision than anything else, and that's what makes it stand out from the other games.

I'd like to mention that depending on your PC, this title has some microstuttering issues, and most likely won't ever be fixed. I get the stutters, but they aren't too bad for me, yet others have it so bad it's unplayable. Your results may vary.

TLDR: No music. Samey repetitive corridors and gameplay loop. Limited ressources are like walking a tightrope for no payoff. Procedural.

This is a keycard corridor shooter with minimal branching paths and coins and dispensers. It is possible to unlock perks, but since everything is procedural and the grind is linear there is little incentive to go forward. Especially since the lack of asset variety gives you the distinct impression that you have seen the whole game 10 minutes in.

Conclusion: Could have had potential with the retro shooter movement, the simple aiming with manual revolver reloading. However the game just does not have enough meat around the bones to really sustain interest past a simple play session. For a minimalistic shooter with an improved level design and mechanics consider Superhot instead.

An assault rifle or shotgun would ruin the feel of this game.

Absolutely great game for when you only have a short time to play.  I kill a half hour, or even just 5 minutes here or there with this game.  I love rouge likes, and it's not the masterpiece The Binding of Isaac is, but it's easily worth twenty bucks, works well with a controller or K+M, and can be learned quite quickly.  It's lacking depth, but that's kinda why i play it so much.  It's a pure test of reaction time and skill, not a test of knowledge (to go back to the binding of isaac, learning the game is a huge part, and a long, long process.  100's of items with no descriptions you have to figure out).

This gun is insta kill on basically all enemys as long as you hit the vulnerable spot, wich is where the difficulty comes from. As shown by the screen shots graphics are very spartan, in that there is little detail but they are serviceable and the aesthetic is certainly unique.

Despite the pseudo random levels i don't think it has too much replayability after you beaten the game, mostly as a result of the very repetative combat. There is a few items in the game for sure, but they are all unlocked from the start, so there is no real progression to be had in that sense. The items are not very active in combat either and i find that the most effective way to play is often to simply use the gun rather that anything else.
 You will get money from killing and selling things, wich you can use to buy upgrades and items. But these upgrades are often quite boring, being things like extra life, more ammo, magnets to attract bullets or coins and so on.

You creep around a sparse and boring procedurally generated level shooting anything as soon as you see it. There's only one environment type and the pseudo-80s color palate isn't enough to make it interesting. There's only a handful of monsters in the entire game, and while some are kinda creative, after you've killed your 100th one in a run that creativity isn't notable any more. The game's variety and strategy do get slightly better during the later levels, but not enough to make up for everything else.

You can't run and gun, but also at the same time there's somehow no real strategy or stealth--you move slowly down the one corridor forward until something sees you and then you shoot it. The random items aren't enough to make it less of a slog because they usually aren't special or useful enough for you to keep around, so you just hoard money until you find a vending machine on the boss level that sells the two or so items that you need for the fight and then you just repeat the creep-and-hoard gameplay until the next boss.",1523374306,1523374306,False,2,0,0.474916398525238037,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay loop is boiled down to two actions repeated over and over. Most items are useless. Enemy variety are practically reskins. And the ""visual style"" causes eye strain for me. Movement [b]feels[/b] heavy/slow. Bosses are unfairly overwhelming. Sound and music sucked.

Early game: Kite the enemies to pick one by one, snipe sentry batteries, step on worm mines to get damaged for free.

Endgame: Consists of flying garbage rushing you, and now there are sentries that walk towards you and giant ones that shoots explosive missiles and their battery can't be shot, it is turned off by going up to it and pressing ""E"".
Boss fights happen in a room full of clusterfudge that you can't retreat from. (double door closes behind you and a slowdown sentry holds you in place as soon as you open the next door)
(the level 8 boss I barely saw but looked like the same but with 3 times the enemy density, spammed over twenty bullets everywhere killed everything visible and got safe distance to analyse the situation, during the same second, a Suicide Bomb enemy killed me through the corner of the pillar I was hiding.

Most items are useless, pills lasts the time you get to leave the room where you found it, just carry a Last Will or golden potions (or both with a backpack).

Level design is garbage, just a bunch of preset corridors procedurally mashed together in a straight line, many many dead ends happen in junctions between corridor blocks.

The ""artstyle"" is just lack of talent and investment, spacial awareness suffers from that, constantly going back and forth making sure I wasn't forgetting anything, levels were tiny enough and previous gates lock behind you so, not much backtrack is possible but navigating is a pain in the behind. Slight eye strain from playing this.

I even stopped using the bank after my third playthrough, and got to the end boss. The first playthrough I died at the second level, getting the hang of the sensitivity and hitboxes. The second time I got to floor 5 and died to a snake mine right outside the start since I defeated the boss first try but lost heath figuring out where to shoot.

So the third time it was a cakewalk, got full coin magnet early on, a backpack and stockpiled 3 golden potions and 26 bullets total, never used anything else just blazed the entire game easy. damage was mostly garbage jumping at me through corners, Snake mines and failing to dodge turrets when the movement is awkward.

At level 7 I got bored and decided to rush in and oh boy, circlestrafing turrets makes them useless, but gets difficult to dodge normal rushing enemies, having quick fingers was not a problem but snake mines chip away health in this playstyle. When I ended up using one of the golden potions I went back to the boring ""kiting rushers and poking turret batteries"" default playstyle.

The enemy idle sound cues were the only thing design-wise they did right, but most sound effects I can do it myself better by pressing Randomize in BFXR (a free 8-bit sound generator), they all sucked along with the music, it was just background noise made in some trial version talentless wannabe artist, that I even forgot to put in the review and editing this in now.
Every time I got to the next level it ""rewarded"" me with the most jarring sound effect I ever heard for a level ending. 

By the way, it's been 45 minutes since I stopped playing and the eye strain still hurts, I knew it was possible but not this quick and as bad as ""Dying Light chromatic aberration"" bad.

Garbage game, I did not have the stutter every few seconds like most negative reviews but I had to disable some visual effects to reduce input lag, it was near impossible to play at default config first run, This game feels like it was an early acess made in Unity.

I have played better roguelites similar to this, not worth it at any price, will try to refund.

Die Welt ist anders, stylish, farbig-neon, mit flächigen Texturen bestückt. Wir haben nur einen Revolver in der Hand und der hat nur sechs Schuß. Gegnerische Viecher greifen uns auf Sicht an, Turrets schießen auf uns und treffen auch präzise, wenn wir nicht ausweichen.

Aber wie sollen wir mit nur sechs Kugeln überleben? Ganz einfach: indem wir unsere Geschosse wieder aufsammeln. Denn wir haben heavy bullets, Geschosse, die nachdem sie auf etwas treffen, einfach liegenbleiben. Darüßber hinaus können wir noch eine Spezialwaffe tragen, einen Dolch etwa für den Nahkampf oder eine Bombe zum werfen. Allerdings können wir nur eine einzige Spezialwaffe tragen. Oder ein Power-up, eine schnellere Bewegung etwa.

Besiegte Gegner hinterlassen ein paar Münzen, mit denen wir an Automaten  Gesundheit kaufen können oder mehr Patronen oder Spezialwaffen oder Power-ups. Wir könmen das Geld aber auch einzahlen, dann haben wir etwas für den nächsten Run. Denn sterben wir, dürfen wir wieder von vorne anfangen. Ganz von vorne. Ohne daß wir irgendwelche Verbesserungen behalten. Nur unser Geld ist noch abhebbar auf unserem Konto.

Die acht Level des Spiels werden bei jedem Run neu generiert. Zwar treffen wir immer im ersten Level nur auf einfache Gegner, aber die Anordnung der Räume und die Positionierung der Gegner ist jedesmal neu. Und die Gegner sind zwar nicht variantenreich, aber durchaus fordernd. Oft ist es ratsam, vorsichtig vorzugehen. Überhaupt hat das Spiel einen gehörigen Schwierigkeitsgrad, der auch mal zu Frustmomenten führen kann, insbesondere wenn man wieder und wieder bei Null anfangen muß.

Spaß macht es dennoch, denn das Spiel funktioniert mechanisch gut und direkt, hat einen klaren und gekonnten Stil und sogar die Sounds und die Musik passen ins stilistische Konzept. Ewig wird man das Spiel dennoch nicht zocken, dafür ist es zu abwechslungsarm und durch die zufällige Levelgenerierung auch oft zu glücksbasiert. Für einen Run zwischendurch ist es alledings immer zu gebrauchen.

- Fast paced and challenging gameplay

[i]- You're in for an adventure[/i]

Heavy Bullets has been haunting me rather successfully since 2015, but since I recently beat the new game that the creator had time to make in the interim, I decided to go back and smother this helpless baby once and for all.

It's a roguelite. Lite because it doesn't match some arbitrary criteria that some people, who are very mad that the Nethack wiki exists, came up with, but I'd be attempt to slot it under there anyway. All the roguelike elements, brimming on the surface like fecal matter at a water processing plant alongside Action-Adventure and RPG elements, just aren't very good. They're about as bad as that analogy.

So for the premise, the corporate hunting ground -  this time not solely referring to the process of hiring and firing - has been solidly buggered and you, a janitor, and about 10-20 other janitors depending on how good you are at the game, have been tasked with going down 8 levels to sort out this ruckus at the source. You're signing a liability waver first, they don't expect you to make it back.

Don't worry, they give you a gun. Save a bullet for yourself.

Yes, it's got a nice sense of humour about the whole thing, although most of it is simply confined to condemning this completely fictional practice that the developer made up, and isn't quite as fun as the short conversational logs where they take what's left of that water processing plant by the gallon. Complete with emoticons. Ingame it's just snide comments.

[h1]""High Rise are like terrible.""[/h1]
[i]- Common saying in the secret rooms. More like secret cabinets.[/i]

Something the developer realised, because High Hell has roughly the same slant with a much better emphasis on humour. 

Whole lot of that trend here. Heavy Bullets, for all its flaws or depth or whatever close approximation of either it can muster, is just a bit of a step down compared to High Hell. Which is a good thing by all accounts, and not just because I'm heavily biased against procgen. Getting better with each game is a good thing, I'd say. 

So the gameplay involves walking through a series of randomly generated rooms - ""randomly generated"" meaning pre-existing stitched-together tilesets - filled with the lamest items the developer could muster. It just has an absolute lust for giving you a series of scopes and pointy helmets like the Cursed Gem that makes all your bullets explode isn't blatantly the most fun item in the game. 

Other than that you're just collecting cash to spend on the same pool of buffs and items, so not much to surprise you. It's threadbare and weaker for it, unless you really like the idea of continually running through the game until RNGesus blesses you with the items needed for that LOOK AT ALL THOSE HEARTS achievement. Not my thing. I mean I did it anyway, but I wouldn't recommend it.

So that's weak. But it's really the core gameplay that carries Heavy Bullets.

You start off weak. Panicky. Crawling around corners, abusing line of sight, and shooting at every potential snake-bush twice. After just one or two successful runs, you're a screaming Olympic-Athlete, feet drenched in the dregs of reused bullets and circle-strafing/firing blindly at every opportunity. It easily is a game that gets better the more you play it.

[i]Protip: Pre-first win, bomb banks for some nice starter coin. Rocks can just be shot with 3 or 4 bullets to break them, bombs are for banks.[/i]

But that first few couple of runs are incredibly weak and this was easily set up to be a negative review before crawling over the line.

Honestly, I would say to go check out the Developer's newest game High Hell if you're in the market for this, apart from being sadly much slower movement-wise it's just got all the pieces this doesn't. But if you are in the market for this:

ストーリーはほぼ皆無。いきなりフィールドに放り出される潔さは好き。

コントラストがはっきりしているグラフィックと大きめの的により、瞬間的に敵の位置を把握しやすく、且つ一撃必殺の銃でパパンと小気味良く薙ぎ倒していく爽快感がこのゲームにはある。
その反面、弾は沢山持てるものの、銃が6発しか装填できない上、一発ずつ自分で装填しなくてはならないシステムなため、残弾数の把握と無駄撃ちしない冷静さが問われるシビアな面も持つ。
また、基本的にBGMが無く静かなため、若干ホラーゲーム寄りな雰囲気でもある。

ローグライクの醍醐味であるPermadeath(恒久的な死)のシステムは、緊張感が生まれる反面一度死ぬとやり直す気が起きにくくなる弊害があるが、預けることでお金やアイテムを次周に引き継げる救済措置のおかげで、苦手な人でも再挑戦しやすい環境が用意されており、好感が持てる。

アイテムは多くても2種類しか持って行けないので、何を拾うか何を選ぶかを考えるのも一興。
強力でリスクのあるアイテムとも上手く付き合うことで思わぬ活路を見いだすことができるのも良い。

ボスが固定なので慣れるとつまらないが、それでも初っぱなのボスは強い。
対策しないとあっさり死ぬので毎度手に汗握る。

タイムアタックはやはりローグライクと相性がいい。
実績解除の達成感はひとしおなので是非挑戦すべし。

不満点としては
タレット型の敵が起動しながら発射してくることがあるのが気に入らなかった。
ドアを開けた時に不意を突かれることが多く、ちょっと不快。
一部の実績はアイテムを決められた数回収することで得られるものであるが、1周のうちに拾い切れるかは完全に運なので周回がかったるいこと。

Heavy Bullets is a combination of rogelite and twitch reflex shooter. 99% of enemies die in one hit, and make a very distinct ""I've noticed the player!"" sound. The alert noise for the Imp is forever seared into my memory. Anyway, your objective is to make your way through an abandoned hunting complex. You start off with a couple bombs, a revolver, and... six bullets. That might not seem like much, but that's where the game's unique mechanic comes in: Your gun fires truly massive rounds. Not only do they literally shatter foes like glass, they're so incredibly heavy that once they hit something, they fall to the ground, where you can pick them up and re-use them. It's a very simple mechanic, sure, but it's interesting nonetheless.

I know, that isn't a popular sentiment, but the truth it's just a fad and eventually good design will come around again.


Heavy bullets, while flying that banner upon which is written the latin for ""git gud"", is actually appallingly fun. I do not feel restricted by the games design, the controls manage to betray a ""protagonist"" that, while faceless, is able. And I genuinely feel i have no body else to blame for my failures. The game teaches you in the same way that one might expect the kung-fu master to rear his brash pupil. You'll take damage the first time you step on a snake, you might even get poisoned, but you'll watch out for those god-damned bushes next time.

Heavy Bullets actually makes me feel that frenetic pulse quickening moment when I step into new rooms and hear the individuals battle cries of several enemies at once, but I know, that I am quick enough and with a little luck I might be able to get a grenade in there.

Don't be fooled, however, this game is still elementary. The building blocks you come up against do not come in many flavors, but their use if artful enough that you shouldn't mind through a few good playthroughs, and their is a actually a semi-deeper story stowed away among the props.

Edit: Since it has come up twice, I don't mean difficulty and good design are mutually exclusive. I suppose my issue is with games that immediately posture as having a high difficulty but instead of bothering with good controls or tricky situations that savvy players may overcome they become mired in ruinous, frustrating controls and dodgy hit detection.

In most shooters you can unload clip after clip into to enemies with an array of weapons in your arsenal.  In this game thats not an option.  The revolver is the only weapon available and it comes with a mere six bullets.  You'll need to collect your bullets after firing them and individually reload them back into the cylinder.  If that wasn't daunting enough be aware this is a procedurally generated roguelike.  When you die you will lose everything on you and have to start from the very beginning.  Read on to find out if you're up to the challenge.

On each floor you'll find enemies, shops, banks, items, and locked rooms.  There are a variety of enemies from snakes hidden in the grass, spiders that can guard their bodies, to turrets that shoot out lasers and bombs.  You can use money dropped by dead enemies in the shops which can sell both items and upgrades.  Some upgrades can help you attract coins/bullets, some let you carry more of the same item, while others let you reload multiple bullets at the same time.  One time use items include weapons like bombs, mines, and rockets.  Other items offer passive effects much like the upgrades.  You can sacrifice a key card to open locked rooms and grab the random item within.

The mapping of the floors is different each time you play but they all basically feel likes narrow mazes with a couple openings here and there.  A series of doors break the floors into bite-size chunks to help give you a sense of progression.  Also, its important to know once a door has been open for a extended period of time lasers will stop you from going back for items or shops.  The maps aren't particularly pretty, their neon rainbow walls serve more of a practical purpose to help distinguish hazards than anything else.  The rest of the art is more cartoony with a lot of simple textures and polygons.  The art isn't awful but seems like its purely there to serve the gameplay rather than standout in its own right.

Caution and and steady aim is key to survival.  Audio ques are honestly just as important as visual ques as each threat will make a noise as its about to attack.  Some enemies even generate noise standing still, warning you that danger is right around the corner.  With such limited ammo its crucial to take your time, even just a second, to line up your shots right the first time.  You can quickly find yourself out of bullets and in the bigger rooms in can be especially dangerous to track them down.  Enemies move and shoot quickly so its best to take them on one at a time when possible.  Half the enemies will follow you allowing you to fall back and let them come to you.

This is just a wonderfully unique rogue-like that will keep you coming back for more.  It feels a lot like Spelunky with both the way the levels are laid out and in the sense of each death is a lesson.  Even with the procedural generation the game rarely feels unfair.  Its easy to get into a tight spot if you're not careful but if you take you time you shouldn't go through you're health too fast.  Just don't jump into Heavy Bullets expecting much visually as the gameplay was clearly the focus.  The bland looking levels get old pretty fast but thankfully the gameplay is fun enough to keep you hooked.

The gameplay is mostly the standard run and gun style that most games in the genre have. What makes it unique is the fact that the player has to reuse the bullets. After a bullet is fired the player will need to pick it up again. Thats a good thing because the player will have 6-8 bullets on average. 

This makes for fun and frenetic action as a player needs to rush past enemies to get his ammo back. 

The level design are good most of the time, although there will be a unfair level since the levels are randomly generated. The levels also lacks any verticality since every level is on one floor. There are no stairs, dips or inclines. 

The other unique aspect of the game is the presentation. The graphics are low-fi. The levels are low texture and low poly. The enemies are also low poly and kind of ugly. This style actually benefits the game since they are appealing to a certain degree and help the game stand out. The sound is also mostly a series of beeps and boops. 

The rest are all standard fair. Perma-death. Items. Banking money for the next run. High difficulty. The game is still worth a try since it will give a player a unique gameplay experience.",1496650879,1507995484,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Heavy Bullets is a rogue-lite game where you progress through floors while killing monsters and trying not to die. The gimmick is that you can pick up your bullets after you fire them. This makes it so you go into each fight with a very limited amount of ammo, so you need to place your shots well. This can be hard when you get jumped by something hiding in a bush and start to panic fire. It's difficult, but very well designed and feels fair.

L'essenza dello shooter nei suoi elementi distintivi è catturata con una fredda precisione e presentata in una forma quasi prototipale: spogliata della totalità degli elementi superflui ciò che rimane è l'idea stessa di FPS, in cui il gameplay semplice ma tecnicamente esigente rappresenta la sola ed unica chiave di lettura.

In Heavy Bullets dovremo farci largo tra strane creature aggressive e sistemi di difesa malfunzionanti percorrendo un labirinto dagli abbaglianti colori fluo, fino a raggiungere e resettare il mainframe situato all'ottavo ed ultimo piano: una ""trama"" che definire tale sarebbe una bestemmia, ma la stessa natura essenziale del titolo ci impone di stare al gioco e chiudere un occhio su questo aspetto.

Per tutta la durata della partita l'arma a nostra disposizione sarà sempre la stessa: un semplice revolver a 6 colpi. La particolarità della pistola sta nella gestione delle munizioni: avremo infatti a disposizione un normale tamburo da 6 colpi (cha dovremo ricordarci di caricare singolarmente), ma i proiettili sparati potranno essere raccolti e riutilizzati. Tutto ciò, unito alla scarsità di proiettili sostitutivi, imporrà una maggiore precisione di tiro, rendendo il gameplay molto meno frenetico e molto più ragionato rispetto al FPS medio a cui siamo ormai abituati.

Come in ogni roguelite che si rispetti, i labirinti da percorrere sono generati randomicamente ad ogni partita, e una volta esaurita l'energia vitale il gioco terminerà definitivamente. Ad alleviare parzialmente le nostre fatiche potremo trovare nei meandri del dedalo dei power-up sotto forma di oggetti consumabili o passivi; gli stessi oggetti potranno essere acquistati più facilmente da uno dei tanti distributori automatici, a patto di avere raccolto sufficienti monete d'oro dai nemici sconfitti. Saltuariamente potremo imbatterci in una sorta di terminale simil-Bancomat con cui potremo depositare somme di denaro, rendendole così disponibili per una run successiva, o prelevare denaro da nostro conto: un espediente da me personalmente gradito, che funziona bene come money-dump nelle fasi avanzate del gioco, in cui spesso ci capiterà di accumulare più monete di quante ne riusciremo a spendere.

Lato audio-video, come anticipato in apertura, vige una sobrietà quasi surreale che poco o nulla lascia all'immaginazione. Tutti gli elementi della scena, dalla nostra arma ai nemici passando per gli elementi decorativi (pochissimi) sono rappresentati da modelli poligonali estremamente primitivi, mentre la colonna sonora è praticamente assente e gli effetti audio a tratti sembrano uscire direttamente dal mio vecchio modem 56k U.S. Robotics (punti bonus per questo).

Heavy Bullets NON è un gioco per tutti. Non tutti infatti riusciranno a sopportare a lungo un aspetto grafico e un gameplay così basici senza farsi sopraffare dall'esigenza di maggiore varietà e contenuti: nella mia breve esperienza tuttavia ho trovato in Heavy Bullet un gioco stimolante ed impegnativo al pari di alcuni vecchi arcade, e mi sento quindi di consigliarlo a tutti gli amanti dei FPS alla ricerca di un'esperienza di gioco fuori dagli standard.

Heavy bullets isn't a particularly innovative game, nor is it a game of depth. What you see in your first playthrough is, to my knowledge, what the whole game consists of -- and that's not a bad thing. The gameplay is fast-paced but basic, with the ability to pick up bullets being the only thing that I would consider to be an unusual trend for a roge-like/lite game. money must be managed well, and there are no checkpoints. All pretty standard, albiet enjoyable stuff.

The MASSIVE con to this game is the glaring issue of regular stuttering. My rig, along with the vast majority of players', well exceeds the minnumum requirements, but regardless, consistent stuttering is a consistent problem. Because of this (deabably) game-breaking bug and the dev's lack of interest in patching it, I simply cannot reccomend it.

You can also buy 'insurance' and make a bank account so you don't lose all the money you make. The most negative thing about this game is feeling too cocky and trying to rush through at ease only to walk over some plants and get killed by a poisonous worm thing or something making you lose all. I often find my self yelling ""SON OF A WHORE,"" then deciding to call it a day. It's a pretty decent and interesting concept for an FPS, it's fairly cartoony but not overly so, ie when you shoot bullets they kill an enemy then bounce until you walk over them to which you can put them back in your gun. This can keep you on edge because if you don't make a habit of buying extra bullets (which aren't in a pack but single) or picking up your bullets, and quickly reloading, you will find yourself quite screwed as enemies do rush at you, and can often swarm.

An indoor hunting grounds complex has been hacked, and the turrets are now as hostile as the weird wildlife. As one of many disposable janitors, you've been assigned to go through the eight floors and clear them until you reach the mainframe and reset it.

Your giant revolver shoots oversized bullets that you then go and pick up and use again. That means each shot has to count. It also means if you shoot an enemy far away, you have to walk over there to pick up the bullet.

You'll be dying a lot. Being the dedicated employee that you are, you can collect the gold coins that enemies drop and stash them in ATMs  so the next poor sucker has a better chance of purchasing upgrades and clearing more floors.

Taken at face value, Heavy Bullets is a simplistic roguelike FPS. But once you've played a few lives, you start seeing the depth of the gameplay. I'm not experienced with roguelikes and usually I don't like them much, but it's all about playing the long game. Giving each run your best shot, but also planning ahead in case you don't make it all the way.

You'll be finding or purchasing upgrades such as a coin or bullet vacuumer, spare bullets, rockets, an Aliens-style motion detector, speed boots, health potions and much more. You have to decide whether to hoard your gold or go all out. Maybe you'll do a few ""farming"" runs where you just stash as much gold as possible, and then do a proper run to clear the game. And since you can only carry one special item with you at a time (unless you get the Backpack upgrade), you have to decide what to keep and what to dump.

One negative is performance. Mostly the game runs butter smooth, but despite the simple graphics I get a random stutter every now and then, on my GTX 980. Doesn't make sense, and can ruin an entire run in game like this that relies on split-second reflexes.

Also, watch out for the snakes in the bushes. Those fucking snakes.

Now, to be quite honest, the first time I saw this, I fell in love with this game, because it was simply a pretty easy game and then I tried to get good at it, almost beat the game until I misclicked.
Now, this was maybe, 2-3 years ago.

Now, the game itself lags at certain intervals and when the core gameplay of this game is based on quick reactions, it becomes near unplayable. The other bad part is, this game becomes progressively laggier the more you progress into the levels, becoming extremely stuttery at the last level. I used to love this game, now I can't even look at it.

I would have recommended this game forever ago, but now I cannot.
My other point in this review, I upgraded my setup from when I had it prior 2 years ago where i didn't have a single problem. So something isn't right when a game runs worse on a higher end graphics card.",1481927497,1481927497,False,9,0,0.5486106276512146,3,True,False,False,False,,,

La ambientacion, el diseño artistico, incluso hasta los sonidos, me parecieron excelentes, y a pesar de no tener jefes de nivel, si tiene un nivel de dificultad que te obliga a tener cierta estrategia antes de avanzar, porque en cada esquina hay enemigos listos para atacarte.
Hablando de los enemigos, mas de una vez me di un susto de muerte por culpa de las serpientes que estan bien ocultas entre algunos arbustos, por lo que recomendaria andar con cuidado y no confiarte en el momento en que veas algun objeto interesante frente tuyo.

Non innova un granchè nel genere e soprattutto introdue un enorme mucchio di stronzate.
Parliamo della struttura del gioco:
1) Le basi
[list]
[*]Come in ogni rogue-like, ad ogni partita rinizi da 0
[*]Ci sono vari livelli. Ogni livello è composto da un labirinto e varie stanze
[*]Hai a disposizione un numero limitato di proiettili. I proiettili possono però essere recuperati (come se fossero delle freccie)
[*]È possibile depositare i soldi guadagnati in una partita per poterli utilizzare in una futura partita (ma solo quando si trova la banca)
[*]ci sono vari oggetti che danno effetti attivi e/o passivi
[/list]
2) Il gameplay vero e proprio
Siete in un labirinto, tutto è super lowpoly e colorato in maniera molto strana. I primi nemici che probabilmente incontrerete saranno molto facili da distinguere, in quanto saranno neri (quindi un grande contrasto).
Poi vi capiterà sicuramente di camminare sopra una pianta e di perdere vita. Vi chiederete il perchè di tutto questo, e vi accorgerete che nascosto in una delle mille piante che avete già visto prima questa volta c'era una sottospecie di verme carnivoro nascosto e mimetizzato. Eh sì, perchè sto verme non si muove ed è dello stesso colore della pianta. se ne sta lì e spera che tu non lo veda e ci passi sopra per poterti mordere e avvelenare.
Il gioco quindi ti invoglia, o meglio costringe, a fare due cose: o sparare come un pazzo in ogni cespuglio (e poi raccogliere i proiettili, che ricordo essere estremamente limitati), o ad andare lento come una lumaca per ispezionare ogni singola pianta.
Prima o poi raggiungerete il secondo livello, e lì troverete altri simpatici nemici, come Kamikaze esplosivi tondeggianti rosa, esattamente come i frutti degli alberi.

3) I PRO
[list]
[*]Non l'ho pagato
[*]La grafica low poly in sè per sè è gradevole, così come i colori neon
[*]Carina l'idea della banca

4) I CONS

    [*]Having one of those charging bull-like things spawn around the first corner after reaching a floor, which makes it impossible to pass or even outrun because you can't get past it

Haven't gotten that far, it can be frustrating but the upgrades and items are in my opinion, very well designed. The banking and ""will"" system is pretty awesome as well (possibly unique), making it easier to set yourself up for success. I got this game a long time ago, and i always find myself coming back to it, so it gets more attention then a lot of other games in my library that I never come back too.

It is a simple plot and the art style is pretty sweet, the neon/contrasting scheme allows for the enemies to have more POP. It has most of the themes you will find in any other regular rogue likes such as secret rooms and random purchasable items. Not sure if there are any bosses, i have only come across the very fast/sneaky animal enemies and the turrets. Depending on your preference for gameplay (are you a fast paced go-go-go shooter, or are you a slow stealthy look for secrets) you may find this game frustrating if you are the first. I say that because the enemies move quickly and are sneaky shits, so for me if I am moving too quickly i get stuck in bad situations easily and i also miss key cards or secret rooms. There is a mechanic in the game that may piss some people off, which is the locking of doors behind you that can occur as you progress forward. This prevents you from going back to get items or find secrets etc. Kind of annoying but it forces the player (if they care enough) to move slowly through the environment and inspect everything before moving forward.

Combat feels awesome, you get a gun with 6? bullets and the best thing about your gun is you can pick up your ammo after shooting. Most of the upgrades do NOT apply to your gun, they are for giving you more tools to survive not necessarily for amping up your guns firepower. This game does not appear to be a bullet-hell, so dont expect crazy situations of 15-20 enemies converging on you as you blast a millions lazer jet flying, most crazy situations i have been in were maybe 7-8 enemies in a room and not all had noticed me. Now that might not hold true for later levels, but the upgrades and items dont necessarily lend to a bullet-hell play style. It is definitely more stealth focused in my opinion.

Like most Rougue-ish games you only get one life (although you can inherit goodies from your last go-though) and of course the levels are randomly generated. There is a pretty good selection of goodies to pick up and use such as knives, bombs, speed pills, sniper shots and more and not all of them are good for you. There is SOME character  development as you can also be upgraded with more hit-points, the ability to carry (oh boy!) 2 items!  (by default you can only carry one item at a time), increased pickup range and more. I really enjoy the banking system that allows you to store away money and items for your next playthough, or trade unused items for cash. It's just a small thing, but really helps flesh out Heavy Bullets into a more deep experience.  Play-wise it is a pretty sparse corridor shooter that focuses on short skirmishes with a small amount of enemies at a time. A couple small mistakes will generally lead to your demise as pretty much any of your foes will kill you easily given the chance. Oh, and watch out for the grass: they just love to hide in the freakin' grass. I warned You. The presentation is pretty simple: Atari 2600-meets-3d Playstation One graphics, with sound consisting of bleeps and bloops reminiscent of the 8 bit era.  It's a unique look and I like it quite a bit although I realize it may not be to eveyone's tastes. 
All and all I like Heavy Bullets: It's great to play in small bursts and has just enough depth to keep me coming back for more. Good stuff indeed.

You need to go online to figure out all the different things. That would be ok if the game were worth playing multiple times, because you guessed it, if you die you lose all your progress. What's worse is you dont start with bought upgrades, money, items, extra bullets, etc, which always makes it more enjoyable. Nope you can either put your money in your bank before you die, as if you know when thats going to happen, or you can put some money down to get a much smaller percentage of it if you restart. Also there's only 1 gun, and its a pistol. Also, if collecting coins isn't tedious enough, you also have to collect your bullets every time, and just like coins, standing almost on top of them doesn't even work unless you have bought collector upgrade, making it extra annoying. There's tons of cheap damage. You open door get immediately hurt. There's turrets that shoot every 1 second but you have to aim at this small bos with your TINY crosshairs so you often get hurt with more than 1. Enemies are much faster than you, meaning you can't run backwards if they're chasing you and kite them. Some cheap enemies like bombs that are right around the corner and you can't do anything before they are on your and explode if killed and hurt you. There's snakes that blend into grass and are impossible to see if not looking for, but there's grass everywhere, so you can get hurt by not always looking for them 100% of the time. Then there are cheap deaths like me fighting a boss, then I throw a bomb at it, it blows up immediately right in my face killing me instantly and I lost 30-45 min of progress for some inexplicable reason.....no want to try again. This is also because you fight the same 3 enemies in the exact same corridors with the exact same 1 gun the entire game. Then there's terrible design decisions like the fact you can only carry 1 single item at a time, and increased health, or backpack to carry 1 more item are super expensive or super rare to find, causing you to never get much stronger or change over the course of the level. So with repetitive play, lack of character strength and progression during play, and no carrying over to next life there's no incentive for this game.

The gameplay, as I said, is easy to pick up and play, and it was fun trying to conquer a room filled with turrets, while looking out for snakes in the grass, but after the initial shock and X runs, and despite being randomly generated, the game gets somewhat dull and repetitive.  Said repetitiveness must be plaguing roguelikes in general, so it isn't totally at fault, but at least for the first half, I just had to counter very simple AIs for quite a long time, in environments that only differ as to where the doors and vending machines are now set at.  I believe a simple game can still have a lot of depth, but this isn't it.

Another bad thing, the game stutters quite a few times, for 1/4 of a second, and whenever it happens, it's always right after I killed an enemy, oddly enough.  I'm well aware I sound like the ""Dur, it's only 720p and 30fps"" crowd, but when I have to kill 2 enemies that are aiming at me, thinking I could quickshot the both of them, the game freezes, stuttering me and messing up my sight on things, even for the briefest of moments, and the other enemy then is right up my grill without warning, it's pretty lame and it happened more times than I would be comfortable with, heck it happened during the first boss, leaving me as a very salty barnacle.

Lastly, if I have a Last Will, which SHOULD save my items upon death, and is in the backpack when I die, it becomes useless and I lose my 15+ keycards and bullets.  I'm perfectly fine with passive items not working in the backpack, but I think that this is just nitpicking right here.

I don't think it's worth 10 bucks but thats subject to each person's opinion. It has some replay value and even if it doesn't particularly grab me I find myself loading it up every so often. 

Pros:
It's got some pretty interesting mechanics what with the bullets being reusable and causing you to retrieve them due to the fact that you have nothing to defend yourself if you run out of bullets. The whole rougelike mechanics are pretty heavy in this game as well. You don't really make a lot of money off of enemies so with the prices going up the deeper you go it becomes really important to balance what you want to spend your money on. Potions, healing, bombs, the discount (which should be top priority), your life insurance, etc. With money being so important it both makes sense and sucks that almost everything in the game only sells for 5 dollars, with a few exceptions. 

Cons:
Although it can be fun I can't really recommend it to people, as interesting and unique as it is. As many have said there is an unsolved sutter issue that happens every so often. Its pretty random when it happens. You can go a whole game without it and sometimes you cant get it to stop. On top of that I feel like theres some balance issues with hitboxes and such. I've been attacked through a wall from around the corner by one of the imps as well as a crawler. Turret placement can be a real pain to deal with when its only weakpoint is behind it and it shoots two times per second. The turrets are deadly accurate as well, forcing you to constantly move in order to dodge them which can really put you at a disadvantage if theres more than one or other enemies in the same room. I've also had it on more than one occasion where a turret's bullet clipped a corner and still damaged me even though I was out of the line of fire/line of sight. 

On top of all that the developer has given up on the game so there won't be any updates in the future. It's a pretty barebones game that has the potential to be better but sadly wont be. I wouldn't mind seeing some more balances, bug fixes, and additonal items and enemies.

This game could be called a management sim: You're always keeping track of money, items, and the titular bullets, which you need to pick up after firing. At least then I wouldn't be making purists angry by calling it a roguelike.

Heavy Bullets is a hard game, but you won't know that until you've already gotten through one or two levels. It has a really nice learning curve that punishes mistakes just hard enough for you to not make them again in 5 minutes. You may be frustrated, but there are almost no moments in the game where you can call bullshit. 

I may be the odd one out on this, but I feel like the music takes away from the game. It plays at intervals, and then only for a short period of time. The music is good, sure.

I would still recommend this game, because the first 4 levels were fine for me and gave me a lot of enjoyment, but you might want to wait for a sale. The lag on the last few stages makes it hard to enjoy, especially for a game that is heavily reliant on fast reactions and twitch shooting. However, I would say that the first 4-5 stages are a lot of fun, and I would say it is still probably worth buying if you get the game on sale.**

If you enjoy twitch shooters, difficult indie games, roguelikes or dungeon crawlers, I can't recommend Heavy Bullets more.

I have not experienced any of the extreme lag others have said, but I do get the occasional stutter (maybe once or twice a floor) but that generally doesn't happen in combat and barely effects gameplay. **Edit: In the last few stages it rapidly increases makes the game almost unplayable. Be warned**

Even if lag might be an issue, it's well worth buying it. You can see if you experience the lag and if you do you can easily refund it.

Now, to the game:

The gameplay is addictive and fun. For games like this, a lot of the time I find myself getting bored and just being careless/running through quickly (looking at BOI). With this game, I find myself much more invested in each playthough, 

There is a sense of progression - upgrades make a noticable effect and the further you get, the harder the enemies get, but also the more equipped you are to deal with them. There are 8 stages (it shows you every time you load the next stage) and I have only got to 4 so far, but I already feel determined to beat the game. It might take a while though.

There isn't much to learn in terms of items and enemies (again, not like BOI), so you generally don't feel cheated after you get used to the pacing of the game (and learn about the three main types of enemies - charging enemies, worms and turrets). None of the items you pick up can effect you negatively and most are pretty descriptive as to what they are, so you are never left thinking 'What does this item do?'

The randomly generated aspect of the game can be annoying at times (I'm assuming that is what causes the occasional stuttering?) with some places being out of reach, but it also gives the game insane replayability.

The biggest gripe I have with this game is the explosives. You start with three grenades, but you only do a tiny throw when you use them. This makes them basically useless. There are several explosive items in the game and I barely find myself using them. There is an item that lets you throw them further but it is fairly rare and when I find it I am normally carrying more useful items anyway.

In summary, if you are interested in this game and think you might like it, get it. I don't know about full price but it is definitely worth it on sale. If it tags too much, get a refund.",1457982887,1461501052,True,2,0,0.550321221351623535,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Chistes aparte, que es Heavy Bullets?

Es un Roguelike/Dungeon Crawler/FPS, para dar una remota idea, un The Binding Of Isaac mas psicodeligo con un revolver en lugar de lagrimas y en primera persona.

La historia del juego es la siguiente, estas en una especie de sala recreativa, en que los usuarios pueden entrar tranquilamente a matar criaturas de forma segura, sin embargo algo sale mal y las criaturas empiezan a herir a los usuarios, ¿Cual es la solucion de la compañia? Enviar a centenares de conserjes con la esperanza de que alguno llegue al nucleo y resetee el sistema, ¿realista verdad?

El juego en si es muy desafiante, todo se basa en tu unica arma, un revolver que mata a cualquier cosa de 1 tiro, sin embargo el revolver usa una municion muy grande (Heavy Bullets, balas pesadas) que pueden volverse a usar, osea, nunca esta la posibilidad de quedarse sin municion -a menos que dispares a la desesperada a algun bicho y salgas corriendo sin municion- pero para poder seguir disparando tendras que volver a recoger las balas.

El sistema de mejora del juego se basa en tiendas, en ellas compras mejoras permanentes, objetos pasivos y activos y seguros de vida......¿seguros de vida? sip, seguros de vida, ten algo seguro en este juego, vas a morir, y vas a perder todo a menos que guardes tu dinero en el banco o tengas un seguro de vida, el cual te guardara cierto porcentaje de tu dinero al momento de tu muerte.

Los enemigos, no son muchos, pero tampoco pocos, y uno solo no es un problema -excepto los jefes y la,,,,,cosa con forma de chicle,,,,explosiva- pero son numerosos, en salas grandes, son desafiantes, Imps corriendo a por ti a toda velocidad, moscas gigantes volando a morderte, una mezcla de imps y arañas que pueden bloquear tus ataques, torretas disparandote, y mis odiados favoritos, los gusano-serpientes, esos hijos de p*** que le dan ese toque de suspenso y terror al juego.

¿Lo recomiendo? Totalmente, mas si te encantan los juegos Rogue-Like, es un poco corto, pero es muy entretenido

НО! Все эти приятности меркнут по сравнению с тем что у игры есть ОГРОМНЫЙ БАГ, это ПЕРИОДИЧЕСКИЕ ФРИЗЫ, которые очень часто мешают играть (СТРЕЛЯЕШЬ В ТУРЕЛЬ И БАХ ИГРА НА СЕКУНДУ ПОДВИСЛА, В ИТОГЕ МЫ ИМЕЕМ ПОТЕРЯННУЮ ЖИЗНЬ, ТАК КАК ТУРЕЛЬ В НАС ПОПАЛА).

Dejad que me explique.

Haciendo de la simplicidad conceptual su bandera, Heavy Bullets se presenta como un Shooter Rogue Like en el que deberemos avanzar por unos niveles minimalistas en color y detalle, pero no por ello ausentes de peligros y desafíos. Monstruos y máquinas de todo tipo se interponen en nuestro camino, y no dudarán ni un segundo en acabar con nosotros. ¿Qué herramientas disponemos los jugadores para defendernos de tales peligros? Una sola arma, un revolver. Y seis balas. Seis balas pesadas.

Y aqui radica el principal punto fuerte y punto débil del juego simultáneamente, porque cada vez que disparemos una de nuestras preciadas municiones, podremos recogerla y volver a utilizarla, tantas veces como sea necesario. Una idea original y muy divertida, un concepto simple y genial pero con doble filo:

- Por una parte es muy desafiante tener que ser preciso siempre, puesto que no podemos malgastar nuestras escasas balas, ya que a veces ir a recogerlas no es una opción hasta que la sala no sea segura. 

- Por  la otra este revolver es el único arma del juego, y aunque en dosis pequeñas no se nota demasiado, jugando durante horas puede resultarnos insuficiente. 

Existen una miríada de Power Ups y objetos que modifican, y bastante la experiencia de juego (la piedra maldita es uno de mis favoritos, convirtiendo nuestro fiel revolver en una suerte de lanza balas explosivas), pero solo parchean las evidentes limitaciones jugables del concepto. 
La variedad de enemigos es muy aceptable, y hacen un uso muy inteligente de la escasa paleta cromática del juego para jugar al camuflaje y a las emboscadas. Mantener el oido agudo te salvará la vida en más de una ocasión. Dicho esto, la música prácticamente brilla por su ausencia. No se la echa demasiado de menos, pero es escasa y hay que decirlo.

No me malinterpretéis, el juego es muy divertido y la mecánica de ""reciclar"" la munición es genial y muy refrescante, pero tener un solo arma disponible reduce y bastante las horas de juego que se pueden disfrutar seguidas. Yo personalmente pagaría por un DLC con una escopeta de dos cañones, por ejemplo. 
¿Recomendaría entonces este juego? Sin duda, pero con matices. Si te gusta el género Rogue Like, los shooters un poco diferentes y te atrae el apartado gráfico, adelante. Aún así lo recomiendo en dosis pequeñas: Jugar, avanzar, matar y morir. Morir mucho, porque Heavy Bullets es condenadamente difícil, como buen Rogue Like, y te hará volver a intentarlo una y otra vez.

毎回、多岐に渡る種類のアイテム、そしてダンジョンがランダムに生成され、リプレイアビリティは高く、短い時間で何度も挑戦できる。
このゲームのユニークな点として挙げられるのが、武器であるリボルバーの弾を拾って再利用する点だ。
一度発射された弾は敵であれ壁であれ当たると上に弾き飛ばされ、これを拾ってはリロードを繰り返す。
つまりこのゲームは無限で撃ちまくる前提でも無ければ、弾切れの憂き目にも合わないが、手持ちの弾の管理が重要となってくる、といったバランスである。

ステージの随所には楽しそうなBGMを奏でる各種自動販売機が設置してあり、敵を倒して得たお金で様々なサービスを利用できるのも面白い。
ATM機では死亡時の所持金現象ペナルティを軽減させるRPGおなじみのシステムがあり、様々なアイテムの中にはなんと遺書まで売っていたり、
ヘルス関係を扱う販売機や、予備弾販売機なんかもあり、買うと実物がゴロッと出口から転がってくる。かわいい。
ただし、販売機は弾の飛び交う射線上にあると大変なことになるので注意。
買ったり拾ったりしたアイテムの効果はESCを押したメニュー画面で確認できる。

移動も照準も動きは素早く、その中での精密射撃を要求されるので、FPSに慣れた人向けのゲームである。
また、ゲームは現状で日本語非対応であるが、英語はアイテムの説明くらいにしか出てこない上、とても簡単なので心配は全くいらない。

言うなれば、DOOM時代のドアを開ける緊張感を知っている人なんかには、特にオススメかもしれない。",1448729078,1448729078,True,8,2,0.612236618995666504,0,True,False,False,False,,,

E aqui em texto: 

FPS solitário e estiloso com mapas procedurais onde o objetivo é arrumar resetar um computador defeituoso, responsável pelos inimigos. São 8 fases e sua arma tem só 6 slots de balas, que são recicláveis. Atirou, tem que ir buscar a bala ou você fica sem munição.  Pelo caminho vários upgrades, itens médicos e armas para você achar ou comprar nas lojinhas. Para comprar os itens você tem à disposição caixas eletrônicos para sacar ou depositar grana. Depois que você morre, você pode começar o jogo do zero mas grana no banco. Com essa mecânica é fácil chegar ao final. Difícil é bater os dois chefões do jogo. 

Algumas dicas:

- Junte pelo menos 600 moedas para fazer uma tentativa séria
- Compre vida, o máximo que conseguir
- Balas, muitas balas

Is a low poly FPS with an abstract but appealing visual style, the neon colors have a good contrast so they never feel like an eyesore, and the style has a neat early 3D vibe, the sound design having a glitchy vibe to it.

The gameplay reminds me of the original Wolfestein 3D; there’s no jumping, you walk through semi Labyrinthic corridors killing enemies and finding secrets, but that’s where the similarities end. The random generation is really good; I never encountered myself stuck or in unfair situations that can’t be solved by your own skill. It has some heart pounding moments which makes this game memorable at times, but going through random adversity never gets old.

It has an interesting item variety, which can help you or ruin you over. However, while some items make for different and interesting play styles, I wish the game had more to offer.  Many of the items are only there to be used for the achievements or feel arbitrary, meaning you’ll be selling those or ignoring them altogether. An update that expands the item pool would be greatly appreciated, but I also appreciate that the game is mostly skill focused and you don’t need to rely on the items in order to make it to the end, but they help.

Don’t expect a deep plot or story in this tittle, it constantly contradicts itself (In purpose) and anything regarding the ‘plot’ is told via flavor text and some small things within the game. Its main focus its gameplay with very minor plot elements.

Overall, the execution is original and really fun. The idea of having to recollect your bullets in this manner is something I’ve never seen before, and it’s well executed. Being able to play the game at your own pace is a great addition too. Go slow or go fast, is a blast.

[h1]Warning![/h1]
There are people suffering with stuttering while playing, there are many theories for this issue and you can read up more about it on the forums. I play this game on a very out dated toaster and barely noticed issues regarding this, for me it’s rare to say the least. But the stuttering can prove unforgiving or to ruin the game entirely given its nature, if you suffer from it and can’t find a way to fix it, a refund is recommendable. As much as I enjoy this game, no one should go through that, and the creator should make a better effort to fix this problem.",1448263849,1448265311,True,21,0,0.735784769058227539,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Not much to say about the game that wasn't already on the store page. It's intense, colourful, playful and fun. You'll need decent reaction times and a good aim to deal with the enemies, as well as a keen eye to spot the kinds that like to hide in the environment. Levels are randomly combines, though you'll probably recognize some of the rooms from your previous playthroughs (this happened to me once in 70 minutes of gameplay). Ammo collection mechanic makes every encounter meaningful, the items you can get offer different approaches to a variety of situations and the banking system allows you to have your more casual playthroughs contribute as increased resources for the playthrough you try to beat the game on.

One complaint is the cheap death I got in the first boss fight: I had no idea what I might be facing, and there was very little time to react once the door opened. This is pretty standard in the genre though, and my first encounter did give me enough info to know what to do the next time, so that's not so big of a deal.

It took me those first few runs to realize that sprinting in guns blazing is not an approach that pays off here. Instead, you creep forward, peeking around corners to catch a glimpse of an enemy turret's weak spot, or one of those dastardly worms hiding almost in plain sight in the undergrowth. 

You hear the bark of an imp that you know is coming screaming towards you at speed, but you haven't got a bead on which direction it's coming from yet. You spin, spot the imp that's right on top of you and squeeze off a single round, all in the blink of an eye. You know that there's a medbay a little ways back, but you also know that you're going to have to press onward to find the money to buy the heal you so desperately need.

Heavy Bullets is *tense*, and it rewards your patience, care and attention to detail. It puts finely calibrated constraints on  every aspect of the game, from your limited titular bullets (a mere six rounds) that you can pick back up off the ground where they fall, to the single-item inventory that has you wondering whether you should have left that armor pickup and taken the megabomb instead. The powerups available for purchase are similarly well balanced, with you never quite sure that you made the right choice.

Heavy Bullets привлекла меня довольно давно.
И в основе завлекаловки - визуальный ряд. Такие цвета в играх встречать не приходилось, по крайней мере как основные.

Но разрабы пошли ещё дальше, это замечательное творение, которое впитало сразу ряд разных жанров.

[h1]Под какие категории попадает игра:[/h1]
[list][*] FPS элемент, вы и ваш револьвер
[*] Rouge-Like, где вы бродите по процедурным лабиринтам
[*] RPG, где вы собираете вещи, собираете деньги, покупаете, продаёте, прокачиваете способности на выбор
[*] Horror. не стоит пропускать нюанс, что местная фауна и антураж заставят вас ни раз дернуться[/list]
[h1]Жирные плюсы:[/h1]
[list][*] Общая идея ""ковбоя""! Это просто шикарно, когда вы - стрелок с несменяемым револьвером, и каждая выпущенная пуля может быть подобрана снова. Вы можете щелкать как опешивший от страха, спустив весь барабан, а потом быть разорванным на части. Одна из игр, где промахи игра особо не прощает. Нужно стараться держать хладнокровие и стрелять первым, амиго!
[*] Вещи довольно интересные. Местами они бесполезны, но это слишком субъективное заявление. Уверен, что найдутся те игроки, которые предпочтут поставить несколько ловушек, чем рисковать и предоставить всё своей реакции.
[*] Эта графика словно кому-то дали посмотреть 3D-фильмец, оставив только эти цвета, оттенки розового, черного, зеленого и синего. Это то, что продаёт игру, и это абсолютно серьезно. Многие пропустят её, но с этим видом всё обретает другие очертания <3
[*] Процедурность - это то, что дает игре возможность быть реиграбельной.
[*] ХАРДКОР. Вы можете попытаться пробежать все уровни до конца, но скорее всего вы просто помрете по неопытности, не зная какие существа Вас ожидают. Высокий уклон на скилл, вместо нелепых рандомов.[/list]

Можно сказать, что игре чего-то не хватает для полного счастья.
Но даже с этим чувством игрока ждет настоящее наслаждение от игрового процесса, особенно если есть склонность к жанру рогаликов.

After you fire bullets, you can pick them back up from where they land, and put them back in your gun.  Bullets and coins will gravitate to you if you get close enough, and you can upgrade that feature.

Shops, enemies, and levels are randomly arranged per playthrough.  Shop inventories are also unpredictable.

A lot of the game is good: The art design is sweet, the music plays in well, the enemy types are just varied enough, and the sensitivity and gunfeel is spot on.  It's gimmick, the way you have to pick up and conserve bullets plays out really well and the game does a great job of making that fun.

But there are all these roguelike mechanics that just make me not enjoy my runs.  You can bank gold and an item for a future run.  You can only carry one item at a time, or two with a backpack.  The shops are randomised, so you aren't always able to buy what you want.  There are some certainties: the Medical shop will always have heals and the ammo shop will always have bullets, but you are in no way guaranteed a shot at the rarer upgrades such as the backpack or increased MaxHP.  That last one's a killer, especially when there's no way to practice against bosses.

Furthermore, while the level design is complex and fun to run around in, it doesn't always make much sense.  You find shops before you find enemies and hence have no money to spend.  There are doors that go to empty rooms.  Some levels will have three secrets in them, and in some runs I can go three or more levels without finding a secret.  Now, since you can only carry one or two items, missing out on a few extra choices isn't so bad, except for the fact that you can sell items for money.  I just feel that having a few failsafes built into the level generation would be a huge boon.  Other games in the genre ensure a secret in each level, or a locked shop, or an item, or something, but with Heavy Bullets the only consistancy are the banking machines.

Perhaps that's part of the game's design, part of it's theme:  You have to grind up to win.  You have to throw away lives failing in order to pay to win.

This is a great, very elegant game for people with a sophisticated appreciation of crunchy design mechanics and genre-jamming.

The spare story elements and art style encourage, nay, demand a level of creative investment on the part of the player, ensnaring you into building a character, plot and context for your motivation to survive.

As you progress you fight various strange enemies who attack in either the most basic or most dastardly ways possible. The most basic enemy is an imp with huge teeth which just runs in straight lines to get to you and bite your face off. Imps won't dodge, won't curve paths, make loud noises to warn you, and won't stop chasing you except to rotate X amount of degrees when confronted with a corner; so they're boring, a nuisance instead of a threat, and lame. Another simple enemy is the turret. You encounter a number of laser shooting turrets which are either easy or hard based on how many other turrets are around, because they all fire fast and have to be hit in a specific location. If there's only one or two it's a bit of a cakewalk if you aim right. Otherwise they'll light you up if there's more. Conversely, there's also snakes which hide in the dense foliage, waiting for you to get close to leap out and posion you. Snakes are usually hidden well, quiet, and often manage to leave a lasting poison which I've had take off three hearts of health before (important note here is that you start with 3 hearts and I only ever maxed out at 5 hearts) so a cheap enemy is one of the biggest threats. Then there's my favorite of the game's many FU's. The living bomb bug. You get suicide rushed by small purple bugs that zoom at you like they're trying to win the fucking Indy 500 race so it can do a large AOE blast which does a full heart of damage and seems to stun you briefly. Remember, you only start with 3 hearts, slow movement for an FPS, and everything is overgrown and neon colors, so it's a HUGE THREAT. So, basically the enemy design sucks both for the player's survival, and for the player's lasting interest in playing at all, because they are so uninspired and have limited AI.

Continuing with gameplay feedback; there are a number of items in game to pickup, similar to say, The Binding of Isaac, where there's both ""use"" items and ""passive"" items. Unlike BoI however, you can only carry 1 or 2 items total in Heavy Bullets depending on whether or not you bought a backpack. There's a good variety in items, though most aren't as helpful as they should be. For instance, there's a ""use"" item called the Ritual Knife, which deals the player a heart of damage and used to give you as many coins as you would need to buy a heart on that floor, but now jips you a few coins. Another such neutered item is the ""passive"" Repelent, which claims to repel bugs and snakes, which would be so great if it actually did so. Instead the repelent only gives the player an extra secind before they attack. So, snakes and bomb bugs will still ruin your fun constantly anyway. The items that actually are good with no downside don't have a big payoff, so there's no full heal just minor, the antidote only cures poison for one instance of poison, and there's no lasting buffs- just ones that last a few seconds. So items play a smaller role than they typically do in this type of game.

As far as lasting thoughts, I felt like it was a game that would have been a gem had it been made in the 90's, as a lot of the ideas would have been fresher and more appreciable then. Rogue-lite's weren't really a trend back then, and the randomized dungeons would have been novel. The visuals are really basic, but 3d games usually were in the 90's. The music was not really very inspired, and should have played a lot more. Sound effects were quite bad. It's hard to get to like a big gun that makes a small ""boof"" noise, creatures sounded as robotic as the turrets, and everything sounded like it came through a bad chipset with a damaged speaker. I think the character was supposed to occasionally say things like ""Oh yeah!"" and ""Whew!"" but it sounded like the sound desginer(s?) burped and farted into a mic or attempted to go for 80's level synthization. All those sound issues would be easier to overlook in the 90's when it was harder and often expensive to get good sound in videogames, but here it's off-putting now.

Overall, a dissapointment on many fronts. I love FPS'es, Roguelites, and games with some style, but this let me down in every cateogory. Things just don't meld well in this game, and the existing content is rudimentary and unfun. 4/10.
If you want a good example of an FPS/Roguelite which delivered where this game failed, I suggest Eldritch or Ziggurat. Eldritch has more stealth, adventure, and horror elements complemented by immersive sound design. Ziggurat provides better FPS movement, more interesting items, weapons, enemies, and impressive visual flair.",1440300028,1440643360,False,2,0,0.507163345813751221,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Despite the above being true, this game lacks. Almost every death is cheap with snakeworms poisoning you with barely any health left on level 7. If it isn't snakeworms, it's the ridiculously powerful turrets (especially the ones that fire ROCKETS at you).
The bosses are the worst part - they're always far too quick for you to even understand what's happening as both of the 2 bosses last usually less than 15 seconds. Unless you have the focus pills (single-use slow motion powerup), you'll systematically either die or come out of the fight with half a heart left.
Besides all that, it's nevertheless a good FPS.

Did I mention performance? It's all over the place - I've read reviews in which performance was perfect, and others that complained about low FPS, which I have to confirm. The game runs poorly on a GTX970 and i5-4690k @ 3.50Ghz, a PC able to play almost any game on ultra with a steady framerate. This includes stuff like MGSV, Far Cry 4, Crysis 3, and other generally demanding games. 
The game doesn't look bad, but judging by the low amount of polygons and textures, there's really no excuse for it to dip down to 30-40FPS at random intervals.

(pour les flemmards - le résumé au début)
Résumé : honête qualité/prix, jolies couleurs/graphisme, rétro mais pas trop (bon compromis), original, difficile mais prise en main simple, configuration des touches possible (jouable manette ? je ne crois pas) et surtout même si la musique est peu présente l'immertion est total ! ... très bon jeu

Très efficace, joliement coloré, monstres interessants avec pattern spécifique et sons qui permettent de les différenciers. Beaucoup de die & retry, d'apprentissage des pattern tant au niveau des sections de niveaux que des monstres, très jouissif et peu stressant à ce que l'on pourrait croire.

Vos premières ""run"" seront (jusqu'à votre premier affrontement du boss final ... no spoil) immersive, intense et tellement lente car vous ferez des straffs (pas de côté) en sortie de mur histoire de voir ce qui va vous arrivez ...

Pour avoir fini le jeu à 100%, Speedrun y compris (première speedrun de jeu vidéo de ma vie ... personnellement) le jeu en lui même est simple, facile à comprendre et répétitif (mais non ennuyeux car tout est aléatoire.. j'y reviendrais après)

Donc il plaira aux vieux de la vieille qui ont jouer sur Atari ou Comodor et aux jeunes d'aujourd'hui call of / counter strike ... voir même aux jeunettes avide de jeu rétro style mais non casual.... car oui jouable souris mais difficile quand même (prise en main en 5 minutes chrono par contre !!)

Le point principal et non négligeable est le faite que le jeu se génère de façon aléatoire (mais pas à 100%) car chaque run sera unique, pattern du niveau / monstres et bonus / stations (medbay, bank, etc) seront plus ou moins là où vous pouvez les attendre et ne seront peut-être pas les même ! donc des run plus dur que d'autres !

moins négatif cependant, le jeu peut saccader cela arrive (attention aux options du genre Vsync à désactiver de préférence) et surtout peut devenir frustrant que vous avez la loi de murphy sur le dos ! (principe qui consiste à avoir le jeu contre vous : peu de bonus, monstres bien placés et/ou en groupe efficace du genre tourelle caché derrière un buisson et un monstre devant qui vous invite à le tuer... et pan ! tuer par derrière X_X)
dernier point négatif et/ou positif selon qui jouera est le fait que la difficultée n'est pas programmable... donc vous pourrez avoir une facilité déconcertant à faire le premier niveau en 45sec ... comme en 1.45mins... car certains monstres n'apparessant qu'au niveau suivant pourraient s'introduire dans se niveau et OH SURPRISE ! ^^",1436887598,1436887598,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Los enemigos no se andan con contemplaciones y apenas con sólo verles dos píxeles de sus cuerpos ya se giran para atacarte... y si decides huir, como el hombre del saco, te seguirán casi a tu ritmo, hasta que finalices el nivel o los elimines.
Olvídate de tener checkpoints a lo largo del juego, sólo te dan la opción de guardar y salir cada vez que termines uno de los niveles del juego. [b]Si mueres, empiezas el juego desde el principio[/b].
Otro de los desafíos que te puedes encontrar es el jefe que aparece a mitad del juego, bastante más difícil que el jefe final, pasarse ese jefe puede significar más posibilidades de completar el juego en esa partida. Pero lo peor que tiene este juego son las serpientes, vas andando/corriendo mirando con mucha precaución la próxima esquina hasta que, sin darte cuenta, pasas por un arbusto rosa y... ¡¡PAM!! Te llevas el susto de tu vida: una serpiente te ataca de improviso sin que la hayas visto antes y encima termina envenenándote.
Por si fuera poco, el juego va oscureciéndose hasta que sólo puedas guiarte con la luz que desprende la mirilla de la pistola, además de que el juego presenta ciertos picos de lag que arruinarán toda la cautela con que te mueves para eliminar a los terribles enemigos.

Hasta aquí todas las desventajas, pero este juego se puede caracterizar porque es un reto para quien lo juega, es necesario no desanimarse y perseverar. Al principio es fácil morir en los primeros niveles, pero a poco a poco nuestra pericia nos hará alcanzar los niveles más altos. [b]El juego no es imposible terminarlo, yo me lo pasé a los 7 días pese a que los shooter no es mi género predilecto[/b], e incluso ahora, tras pasármelo 6 veces, para mí es más fácil terminarlo que morir en el intento. Desde luego, pasarse el juego es de por sí la recompensa final después de un sin fin de adversidades. Pero si os parece incluso poco, conseguir todos los logros es un desafío aún mayor si cabe.
Los escenarios y los sonidos están muy bien pese a ser tan psicodélicos. La banda sonora no tiene tanta variedad, pero hay alguna que otra que realmente te motivan a perseverar en el objetivo de finalizar el juego.
Otra carácterística muy interesante es que todo se compra a través de máquinas dispensadoras de refrescos, pero hay un tipo de ella que es el banco, donde puedes ingresar/retirar dinero. Como consejo, mientras no os familiaricéis con el juego, id guardando todo el dinero que recibais (se guardará para la partida actual y para las futuras), porque si no tenéis el seguro de vida, lo perderéis TODO al morir. Por eso, incluso teniendo una fortuna en el banco y mucha experiencia, no garantiza que te vayas a pasar el juego.

Mi valoración general es que es un buen juego, muy interesante para aquel que quiera probar un shooter diferente o bien le gusten los desafíos, porque a pesar de la dificultad, se puede disfrutar mucho con él.",1434987226,1434987226,True,6,1,0.609731376171112061,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Heavy Bullets is a fast-paced FPS that really requires twitch shooting skills to make it very far. I don't have those. But I still have a ton of fun getting to level two then dying. There are weird dog-like creatures with giant teeth, malfunctioning security turrets that WON'T FUCKING DIE oh wait, you have to shoot the green box, well that was easy, OH SHIT A BUSH JUST ATE ME, oh nevermind, it's a snake in the bush, sweep sweep sweep, look around every corner super slowly and all of a sudden this isn't a fast paced shooter anymore, now I've spent thirty minutes on the first level nervously poking my head around every corner and emptying the gun, then picking up the bullets and scanning every bush for snakes.

This is coming from someone who appreciates bullet hell shooters and twitch-based games.

Success in this game is more heavily dictated by luck than by the player's actions, and rarely will you die feeling like you were to blame instead of one of the various ill-designed or broken mechanics that plague Heavy Bullets.

You will suffer from:
- Getting hit by explosions and turret fire that hit the opposite side of a wall (broken hit detection)
- Exploding enemies that spawned around a corner in a tight corridor and trigger immediately (no-win situation)
- Turrets that seem to fire with a set interval, but glitch and fire in quick succession out of nowhere
- Seemingly no player damage rate limiter (full life to death in no time if unlucky)
- Terrible enemy AI that's overcompensated with dumb attribute buffs in speed/damage.
- Grating sounds emitted frequently by every unpicked bullet and coin
- Uninformative and confusing menus
- Assorted glitches, such as the reticle jittering (on Windows) or even jumping around (on Linux) with mouse movement.

And I see no sign that any of it is going to be improved.

This game looked charming and fun at first, but it turned out to be frustrating, grating and unrewarding.
It just feels like a poorly programmed game, which is par for the course with Unity games, to be fair.

Why should I buy this game?
-Its a procedurally-generated level system, meaning, everytime you play, the levels change! You never know what to expect
-It's really exciting - theres enemies around every corner so you gotta be super careful and peek around. Survival gaming at its greatest. 
-It's super hard - but fair! Every enemy gives fair warning, so if you die, its either because you got careless, went too fast or wasn't prepared. So it makes you want to try again and again! Great replayability!
-You can grind to victory! In a sense. You can deposit the cash you collect in the bank for future runs, allowing you rack up a ton of cash for use right from the start!
-Design is super-unique! Apart from (and I'm stretching it here) Hotline Miami and Far Cry Blood Dragon, you won't find this neon retro style. The stark color contrast also makes things pop out, which is good for gameplay, such as the bright weak spots of enemies.
-Music and sound are all top-notch! The music picks up whenever theres enemies around - a nice jungle battle theme - than dies down when everything's dead. The sound effects are all delightfully (in my opinion) retro and the enemy popping (yes they pop in pieces, like Lego) sounds in particular are very satisfying.

What's not so good?
-Its nail-bitingly difficult. You can only take a few hits, and enemies hit FAST and UNEXPECTEDLY. Within a minute of your first playthrough you'll be left with 1/2 of a heart left, gasping and cringing at the low-health sound. Then, you'll reach the first boss and possibly destroy your controller as he destroys you in a split-second. Which is a good point for some, a bad point for others. I personally find it a tad bit TOO DIFFICULT.
-There's not that many enemies in the game really, but there's enough and their placement always changes.
-Can be confusing for new players. It was complicated to configure the xbox controller - it isn't automatic. There's no tutorial. You'll suicide by accidentally throwing a bomb. Enemies look like the rocks and bushes. In stores, it doesn't say what things do. You just gotta try it out and figure it out on your own.
-The game isn't terribly balanced. Some items are awesome, but most are terrible to useless. Most players will have to resort to stocking one particular item in the bank and ALWAYS USING THE SAME THING. That's kinda sad.

Can't really think of any real faults in the game other than that. Its just perfect at what it does, so it doesn't need to be overly ambitious like GTA V.

Best way to enjoy this game is playing on the couch with friends and watching them squirm as they go through the labyrinth! Pop open those beers! Drink everytime he gets hit! (one swig per half-heart).

Let's start with some pros and cons:
Pros:
-Level generation is very good and provides a high level of area variety with the occasional secret.
-The ammo system of retrieving your scarce bullets flows very well.
-In my experience, the game performed very, very well. No performance issues.
-Gameplay is fast with little downtime.

Cons:
-The game has VERY LITTLE content, and a pretty good amount of that content isn't very exciting. Within 3 hours of play, I had reached the final boss and experienced most of what the game has to offer.
-The graphics and sound, while part of the game's specific art style, are abysmal.
-Gameplay is VERY unbalanced. You will encounter large numbers of trivial creatures, while occasionally facing off against turrets that are much, much more powerful. While there are plenty of effective strategies I used against these turrets, I found that they are very inconsistent; with buggy mobile varieties that can glitch and shoot through walls, and stationary varieties that can turn their gun a full 180 degrees in the blink of an eye. This makes gameplay against these foes extremely frustrating.
-The game offers the ability to save your money and items for later runs, but this is very slow, boring, and grind-y. This is also the reason why this game should be considered a rogue-lite rather than a true roguelike.

Some other points to consider:
-There is no real story present except for a few lines of start-up text, but this isn't really a bad point in my eyes; I'd rather have no story than an awful story.

Overall, I'd say that Heavy Bullets isn't a bad title to play if you get it on sale (AT LEAST 50% off) or in a Humble Bundle (I got it in the Humble Roguelike Bundle), but you are overpaying if you pay the full $9.99 for it.

Overall, I'm quite content with my decision to buy this game, although there's still a few things that really prevent me from fully enjoying it.

The pros:

1. One thing I really like about this game is that each enemy is unique and challenging in their own way. No one enemy feels too easy or hard too fight by themselves.

2. A problem that you sometimes see with games that have randomly generated levels is that they occassionally throw something nigh-unbeatable at you if you're unlucky. This game never does that. It gets harder as you go, but every death you have feels like its because of a mistake on your part, not on the game's part.

3. There is a small way that you can make future playthroughs easier. By storing money in the bank, you can have a large stockpile of cash to use in different playthroughs to make things easier. If you have a lot of trouble with this game, or if you run across some items that you want to buy but don't have enough money for, the bank has you covered. This really helps to take the edge off of this game's difficulty.

The cons:

Now that I've gotten the praise out of the way, let me address the one thing that ""prevents me from fully enjoying this"" as I said. During the beginning of the game, I noticed that it had the occasional stutter. By this, I mean that the game had a rare lag spike, in which everything would freeze for a second, before it would unfreeze, with me in a different spot. This was tolerable at first, but as the game progresses, it just gets worse.

Now, I should probably hedge this by saying that my computer is relatively low-end, but there aren't any options in the settings menu that make the game run any smoother for me. It should be said that Heavy Bullets is the kind of game that you do NOT want to have this kind of glitch in. By the seventh or eighth level, the stutter is so frequent that enemies that really should not be a problem become a nightmare. 

Oh yeah, and it makes it nearly impossible to beat the final boss, so have fun with that.

However, maybe this is just a problem that stems from my pc's general mediocrity, and if you have a better computer, it might work. Alledgedly, the dev is working on fixing this problem, but untill then, it really mars this game's performance.

With all this said, I still feel that it is overall an enjoyable experience. 7/10. I'll be willing to give it an 8.5/10 when and if the glitch is fixed.",1431451748,1431451748,True,8,0,0.624258160591125488,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Tight corridors, blind corners, a limited eight-round chamber with retrievable bullets and fast, aggressive enemies and turrets. You usually learn lessons the hard way, but the smart design ensures you come across each problem one at a time; at the same time this design encourages careful, precise play over guns-blazing tactics. 10 hours in, I still don't know exactly what's going to be around each corner, but I do know that usually the best option is to keep my eyes and ears open, aim true, reload often, and shoot sparingly. The feeling of learning the game is highly rewarding.

Heavy Bullets punishes mistakes hard, but it does well to alleviate frustrations with some neat twists. The ability to save money across playthroughs ensures that each inevitable failed attempt doesn't have to feel like a waste. Keycards, vendors and items, each as randomised as the rest of the levels, encourage different tactics and using whatever's on hand to your advantage.

As of this date, there is one significant negative holding the game back. Many users including myself have experienced regular yet unpredictable microstutters during gameplay. In a game so tightly based around reaction time and precision, it can be positively maddening to drop hearts or even die from losing a much-needed split-second to the game's lag. While the game is by no means unplayable or unbeatable when played this way, several users have refused to play the game until this issue is resolved, and considering the type of game this is, I can't entirely blame them.

Other than that, once the initial hurdles are overcome you'll find the game isn't particularly long, and I don't see myself returning to it once I beat this final level at last. The graphics are simple but clear and easy to look at, and it looks smooth enough at 60fps, the aforementioned stutters notwithstanding. The audio is punchy and fitting with the style of the game, if not particularly catchy. As I've said, it's a simple game, but it delivers a tighter experience than so many games much more complex than it.

They are as alike as they are different. You have a gun, you have bullets. You load your gun one bullet at a time. You shoot turrets that stand still and take potshots at you, or you shoot things that rush you. Both are rules-lite, systems-lite. I keep coming back to both of them.

However, Heavy Bullets is bright, and simple, and teeming with life, where Receiver is monotone in color, byzantine in keybindings, and thematically devoid of life. Heavy Bullets has an end but not much story. Receiver has little more than it's story, but there isn't really an end to the gameplay. 

And I love them both for all of those reasons. 

I have a feeling Receiver is the game I'll return to in the long run, not strictly the better game, but there it is.

But Heavy Bullets: ""A+++ wuld shoot again!!!!""",1431056278,1431056278,True,2,0,0.532308220863342285,1,False,False,False,False,,,

In a move completely opposite to Borderlands billions of guns, Heavy Bullets has one, your trusty 6 shot revolver. Each time you fire a shot, you must then recover that bullet in order to be able to reload it and fire it again unless you are carrying more than just the 6 bullets your start each run with. This creates some interesting situations where you'll be aiming across the room and weighing up whether you're confident of hitting your target; missing may mean having to run across the room with no way of attacking enemies. 

Heavy Bullets features an ever familiar roguelike formula of randomized dungeons as you work your way through 8 levels with increasing varied enemies; at the end of levels 4 and 8 you will fight a fixed boss. Each enemy requires a different strategy in order to tackle them effectively but all drop when hit with one bullet to their weak spot (The only exceptions being the bosses and one enemy). Enemies are varied enough but if you take a methodical pace you can deal with them fairly easily, as long as you're accurate with your shots. I would personally recommend using keyboard and mouse for this game, I tried using a wired Xbox 360 controller but could never find a setting I was truly happy with. 

In addition to your gun there are a number of items in the world to help (or sometimes hinder) your progress. Each play through I'd race for a backpack which allows you to store an additional item as well as the one you have equipped, The only thing that is persistent between playthroughs is a bank balance which you can use to save money for purchasing items and upgrades, the bank can also be used to store an item for future playthroughs and purchasing discounts, life insurance and a last will. If you die with the last will in your possession all money on your person is deposited to the bank.

The duration of a playthrough will depend a lot on your play style; I tended to edge around corners slowly picking off enemies one by one and found playthroughs to be between 40 minutes and an hour but it is possible to complete a run in less than 10 minutes (according to the leaderboards!). The reward for dispatching the final boss is a fresh $5000 in your bank, Whilst I mention the bosses, I felt the final boss was a bit two easy once you figure out how to take him out and would clear the room of other enemies before finishing it off. The level 4 boss was a bit more tricky, but eventually you develop the skill to take it out with relatively little damage received. 

Overall, Heavy Bullets feels like a fresh take on a huge genre and felt very different to what one would expect of a FPS. It's psychedelic colour scheme and upbeat music make it feel like a strange trip and aside from minor disappointment with the boss encounters its up there in terms of a single player FPS/roguelike experience.",1431011496,1439144747,True,10,0,0.536900341510772705,4,False,False,False,False,,,

З фільму «Той що біжить лабіринтом»

Як тільки я запустив цю гру, я одразу згадав фільм «Той що біжить лабіринтом», і не випадково, бо у грі нам запропонують бігати по випадково створюваному лабіринту. А що являє з себе ця гра?

[b]Геймплей:[/b]
Гра являє з себе рогаликоподібний ФПС-шутер. Нам потрібно ходити по випадково створеному лабіринту(а ходимо ми дуже швидко), вбивати ворогів, збирати гроші і йти в наступні двері до нової частини лабіринту. У грі не запропонують стріляти на ліво і право, бо у нас лише 6 патронів до револьвера (і сам револьвер), які на щастя випадають з ворогів на землю після пострілу. Наявно багато ворогів, і кожен з них має особливу поведінку яку варто вивчити для подальшої боротьби з його братами. З ворогів випадають монети які можна скласти у банк, або підійти до терміналу і у терміналі купити нові патрони, аптечку, бонуси і інші речі які допоможуть пройти лабіринт. Вся суть це пройти з першого рівня лабіринту до 10 рівня. Відповідно на 4, 8 і 10 рівнях нас чекають сильні і великі боси.

[b]Графіка:[/b]
Поглянувши на стіни і ворогів, ми не побачимо краси і реалістичності. Ми побачимо райдужний сплав кольорів і відчуємо себе дійсно у грі. Адже у сучасних іграх графіка майже як у житті, а тут ти відчуваєш цю гру, відчуваєш що саме так створено гарну атмосферу. 

[b]Музика:[/b]
І звісно атмосферу гри доповнює музика. Швидка і кислотна музика асоціюється з графікою і є невід’ємною частиною гри. А цю чудову музику  час від часу розриватимуть рики монстрів, звуки пострілів і білі шуми які попереджують про босів.

I will be quite honest here.  When I first saw the screenshots for this game, I nearly laughed.  Most of the time they try to show screenshots on Steam that make the game look better than it is.  The sad fact of this game is, the opposite is true.  If you are turned off from looking at the screenshots, think again.  This game actually does have a unique and cool art style that looks too flashy and annoying from the screenshots, but in reality works great in this game.  This game brings a lot of challenge as soon as you start playing with limited bullets that you have to manually pick up and reload after shooting.  The enemies are simple yet well designed.  Although this game does not have a lot of depth and really no story, the fun  and replaying factors are off the scale.  Even after your health drops to zero and it is game over, you will want to play again.  Not to mention the fact that each time the levels are different since they are randomly generated.  There are a lot of other cool features about the game like a banking system and cool power-ups, but I will just leave my review there.  Overall, not a perfect game but a very enjoyable one that is a great time-passer!

Enemies drop money, which is used to purchase items, weapons, gear, and medical supplies at various vending machines scattered arond the randomly-generated maze. There is also a banking system.

Does that make it a good game? 

In Heavy Bullets, you're basically playing a person whose goal is to do something about the security system, but honestly the story pretty much ends there. Other than some really strange flavour text that pops up whenever you start up the game, there's nothing else to the story other than you're going around shooting spiders and turrets.

The ""music"" (more like sound) and graphics are beautiful. I have heard some people complain about the colour palette, and while I sort of agree at some parts mainly I think it's pretty to look at and the sound fits perfectly. There's usually no soundtrack in the background unless you beat a level or walk up to a vending machine, which even then is only glitchy ambience instead of actual full on audio tracks. When you're almost dead, a intense drum beat starts playing which amps up the tenseness (is that a word?) of the game.

That's where my positives mainly end. While graphics and sound are a big part of this game, the other is the gameplay- which unfortunately is not spectacular. The picking up bullets mechanic is at first, very interesting and fun until you realize that you're either going to be stuck at basically swimming in bullets, or no bullets at all and no way to proceed (which is amplified even more by another thing that we'll get to later).

But what's wrong with the mechanic? Isn't the point that you get punished for bad aim, and that you have to risk your life to go grab more? That is all fine and dandy- until you realize that it forces the game to become a slow, methodical almost stealthing game rather than the fast ""shoot or be killed"" shooter that the game's movement speed and controls hint towards it wanting to be. Moving fast and shooting fast FEELS good, but you get punished for it so harshly by the enemy design and the nature of dropping bullets that you are forced to camp behind pillars and take your shots slowly- something that would work better for another game, but for the twitchy controls of Heavy Bullets it just feels like it bogs the game down to unplayable levels.

In turn, this all creates a loop of camping and inching to preserve bullets and then running out of bullets because you're camping, making you have to camp harder and be even more careful as you try and make a sneak attempt to the bullet you dropped, probably ending up in your death unless you got a bunch of health to camp with or bullet magnet+ to grab it from afar. Overall, I don't think that this mechanic is pulled off well mainly because the dangers that are presented to you are too high to make the game that fun ""run-n-gun"" game it wants to be so much.

Other problems I have are more nitpick and personal preference- I honestly feel like the banking system kind of encourages grinding and money grubbing more than actually enjoying the game the first times through; although you don't have to play the game like this, and there's even an achievement for ignoring it altogether. I feel like also some of the items are death sentences, I've never used running shoes without me running into a snake and killing myself and bombs seem like they're kind of on the useless side of weaponry even though you get a lot which ends up balancing them out somewhat.

So, do I recommend it? Well, if it's on sale as it currently is for 2 dollars, I'd recommend it just for the graphical and audial experience, but otherwise I'd say no. The trailer of popular LPers screaming at snakes attacking them is basically all this game boils down to- being killed by hidden things as you camp in corners trying to hold onto your bullets.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Heavy Bullets is an extremely pretty game game that adds a few innovative features, but squanders them by wanting to be both a slow stealth-like game and a fast run-n-gun, making your twitch based controls and movement basically useless as you inch around levels hoping a snake or turret doesn't kill you around a corner as you camp behind pillars. Get on sale for the graphics/audio, avoid on non-sale price because the gameplay is kind of bad.

It's another one of the ""fps roguelikes"" that seem ever so popular these days, with a very retro feel.

 Although ""retro"", it manages to keep the player very immersed in the game, both with sound and mechanics, which is something games like Spelunky and Isaac tend to fade from doing as you get better and better at them. This may be good or bad, depending on how much immersion you're looking for from a roguelike.

Mechanics are very in-depth, with magnets for coins and bullets, homing bombs, and even the ability to invest in a discount on all other items, a ""last will"" that saves your items and consumables on death for your next run, and a ""life insurance"" investment that lets you keep money on death for your next run.

Finally, as far as performance, it runs great; maxxed, including FXAA, I get about 100 on a GT 640 / AMD FX-6100, which is a rather budget setup. There should be very few FPS issues, likely even on laptops.

The slow and methodical game loop does not prepare you for the fast and frantic bosses, and the speed at which they dish out death makes it very difficult to learn from them. Perhaps the devs intended the core game to be fast and frantic too, but if so they completely failed with the AI.

Original review:

I like almost everything about this game.

My one peeve is the bosses - particularly the final boss. Coming into it for the first time, without knowing what's ahead of you, you're almost certainly going to get slaughtered. It's somewhat annoying to have to play a further half an hour just to get a second go (I beat the level 4 boss without getting hit on my second run through - much easier when you know what to expect), or for another hour or more for a second go at the final boss (who killed me so fast the first time I STILL don't really know what to expect going in again). I think giving the player some way to observe the bosses before jumping into the fray would help, because at the moment you practically need to resign yourself to the fact that, if it's your first time reaching the final boss, you're only half way there. You need to gather as much info as possible before you're inevitably killed so you can stand a chance the second time around.

But like I said, everything else is stellar. Highly recommend.",1429928510,1563015230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sadly I don't.

The premise of the game, to have to pick up your bullets after firing them, seems novel until you realize that we've had this mechanic dozens of times with bows and arrows.

The real issue with the game is that deaths feel really cheap.    

There are turrets that have a glowing box that you need to shoot to take them out and they fire fast projectiles at you as soon as they see you and they track you through walls. This means that you need to move at max speed to pinpoint the spot and then pre-shoot after peeking from a wall. The game does have quick movement, but there are snakes hidden in the brushes that bite you if you come close, so you shan't move fast. Conflicting signals.
After seeing a turret, it shoots at you within half a second, which means you'll lose HP even if you instantly shoot it.
Having snakes wait around 90° corners feels cheap (they rarely make a sound).
There's a ""Repellent"" item that supposedly repels snakes, but it just makes them more aggressive.

You start with 3 grenades and besides the bullets, it's the only item that doesn't occupy ""the"" item slot, so you'd assume that they're a core part of the game. Most of the game plays quickly, but the grenades fly slowly and the throw distance is abysmal (am I playing a T-Rex?). 

Most items use up that one item slot so you end up leaving lots of items behind.

Technically the game has no excuse why it doesn't run at a constant 120fps. There's hardly any geometry to render.

Bullets and coins on the floor make sounds and jump around, which makes it easy to pinpoint them and is useful early on, but it becomes a nuisance later when there are dozens of coins on the ground, which mask enemies in their noise.

The environment has no variety at all, which makes backtracking to a vending machine very confusing, as you can easily get lost in the repetitive rooms.

There are banks where you can drop off your gold so that you can use it in a future run. It feels like they're excusing the unfair difficulty by giving you a way to grind currency.",1429895330,1429895330,False,19,1,0.55813223123550415,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I LOVE this game.  It's a first-person shooter, if you're into that sort of thing, with a semi permi-death thing going on.  It's rogue-like, and it has some gnarly colors (a good thing).  The soundtrack is sparse and electric, but pumping at times, which is surprisingly effective--it's quiet at times, but then it rolls up from the background almost like it knows things are going to get rough.

The enemies are a mix of almost trivially easy and ridiculously hard, though you won't see the hard ones for a handful of levels.  Everything except the bosses dies with one hit, which is good, but you're still going to have trouble, especially when confronted by groups, or when you have to hit a weak point.

You're forced to rely on items and upgrades, which is a pretty neat system, except that you'll lose them if you die, in all but a handful of circumstances; that could be a dealbreaker for some, and a challenge for others.  To say more would be giving away too much.

If I had to find flaws with the game, there are two big ones:

- It gets annoying pretty quick when you die over and over on the same boss, which can be hard enough to the point where your beating it is largely luck.  Should you actually beat it, and die later, you're stuck starting from the very beginning.  It's a near rage-quit.  In the same vein, sometimes your items will save from one game to the next (the result of an item), but sometimes they won't, despite having that item.

- The bigger problem for me is the frame drops.  It's not a terribly demanding game, and I have a decent system, yet, whenever I play (and I always have Steam's frame rate counter running), there are multiple times where the game will drop from 60 FPS (you can change this in the settings) to ~52 or 53 FPS.  It seems slight, but when you're playing a twitchy game like this, and the frame drop causes you to get snagged by an enemy, (and it happens ALL THE TIME, enemy on the screen or not), it's enough to really piss you off.  I've tried all the different permutations in the settings:  FPS caps on/off, shadows/vsync on/off, FXAA on/off...you name it, I've messed with it.  No change.  It's always just enough of a drop to screw you.

All in all, I give it a 7.5/10.  Worth the price, absolutely.  Fix the frame drops, and I'd give it a 9/10.",1429404946,1429405133,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's a very simple game. You are armed only with a Revolver, and you need to survive the 8 levels of the hunting grounds where various creatures and machines lie about to kill you. Your revolver can kill everything in one hit, and is 100% dead accurate. There's no bullet time travel, it instantly hits whatever you point at. You only have 6 bullets though, so you need to pick your bullet back up, and reload it back into your gun (Which is also instant with a press of the R key.)  Enemies will stop at nothing to chase you once they have you in your line of sight, but they drop coins which you can use to buy various items.

Many items and stations exist to help you along the way. Lots of items are hidden throughout the floors, or locked away in doors that require keycards (Which you get from killing certain enemies), so you should do some searching around the area, you might find something good. You have items that bring up passive effects such as taking one hit without losing health, resistance to explosions, or a backpack for additional storage; or they can be weapon items such as mega bombs, mines, or rockets. Other items are handy tools. Speaking of storage, you can only hold one item at a time, so you need to make your choices carefully when you have to pick from 2 or more items, unless you have the backpack, then you can hold two items.

There are 3 stations: Banks are the most important ones. You can store your earned money into the bank for future use when you die, you can also store items in the bank for another run. You can withdrawl money from whatever you stored, and you can buy a last will, or life insurance which'll transfer a percentage of your money on-hand to the bank when you die. There is also the Medbay station for healing items, and Bullets (And Stuff) for weapons and other weird little items.

This game is permadeath, so if you die, you're sent all the way back to the beginning, but there is the Bank station to help you out on your next run. It kinda brings a thought of ""should I store money in here now for better runs next time, or                    withdrawl some money from my current bank so I can have more help on this run?"" Same thing does for storing items, too. It's a bit of decision making when you think about it, so be smart about what you do.

It's not an easy game, either. Everything (Besides immobile turrets) charge directly at you, and aren't afraid to get in your face. You need to make your shots carefully because you only have so many bullets before you have to reload, so accuracy is a must for surviving large encounters. That means don't freak out; keep a cool head. Making it all the way to level 8 and beating the boss will be quite the challenge.

Overall, Heavy Bullets is a pretty unique rogue-like with it's fast paced nature of your insta-kill revolver, the metroidvania vibes of searching for items, and the strategic thinking of the bank and what items to bring with you. I think you'll find quite a bit of enjoyment out of it, and it's cheap too. It's something to try out sometime.

This game is a hot mess, the AI activation from enemies will always cause frame drops even on 2021 top tier GPUs and CPUs, it's not your PC it's the engine.

If you can handle that, which isn't too hard to do if you clear stages methodically (slow as fuck) then you'll enjoy this game.

I would not recommend it though anymore having beaten it thoroughly. It's not an awful game, but it is a bad one.


Initial Review:

Much much harder than I expected.

Just getting to the midway boss can be nerve wraking.

I haven't beaten this game yet but I would still recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge and enjoys the difficulty of rogue-likes.

The visual and sound design are a treat and the gameplay itself consistently has me coming back to attempt to get past my best run.

A challenge seekers game for sure.",1427682442,1627623352,False,0,0,0.496962487697601318,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It succeeds as far as atmosphere goes, especially on a sound design level. It's retro chip-tune design feels threatening in an almost abstract sense, with some hidden monsters in the grass only being given away by the little blip noises they make, though of course you also have sounds to signal uncollected items and jaunty tunes to tell you a kiosk to make purchases is nearby. It's a really terrific use of sound design to fill in the visual holes. 

Gameplay wise, the hook is gripping. Instead of collecting masses of bullets like most FPS's, you have to make due with a limited number of bullets that can be recovered after battle, and only one kind of gun. You can also collect bombs, but run out of both and you're basically done for. The problem I have is that there's really only one strategy for each fight; run out, listen for enemies, run back, wait for them to follow you around a corner, dispatch them, then poke your head back out and deal with turrets carefully. It's possibly an inherent flaw with smushing rogue-likes and FPS's together, since the former is based on randomization and making due with what you have and the latter is much more dependent on strong level design. I feel a lot of those flaws could be compensated for with stronger RPG elements, but leveling up is so far not that involved. You can buy or acquire more bullets, upgrade health, purchases a backpack to carry more than just one item, and of course find items that make you run faster, heal, or give you a melee attack. But in a game called ""Heavy Bullets"" there's no way to upgrade your gun or your bullets. Certainly I'm sure a lot of this has to do with the game's creator being a single individual, but I wonder if scaling down to a top-down shooter or even just making it a survival arena shooter and focusing on the gunplay wouldn't have made for a better game.

In any case this is by no means a bad game, so give it a try yourself, and I'll keep chipping at it to see if there's more depth than is immediately apparent.",1427569405,1427569405,False,4,0,0.553398966789245605,0,True,False,False,False,,,

GOOD
- Very original, you wont be able to find a game which offers the same experience as this one!
- Great atmosphere, maybe the graphics are not very realistic but that's oke. Everything is 8-Bit style including graphics and music, totally different from other games in this genre.
- High replay value, becouse the maps and item positioning are totally random.
- Challenging, you won't be able to finish the game within 15 hours.
- Every enemy has his own strenghts and weaknesses, which add some strategy in the game.
- Cheap, it's below €10,- and I even bought it in sale ;) .

BAD
- Most of the maps are almost the same, which can be repetive.
- You loose your progress when quitting in the middle of a level, exept when you quit when you finished a level.
- Limited amount of enemy types.

CONCLUSION
Just buy it, it's totally worth the full price and for that small price you get a whole new game experience you never met before.

Sadly, Heavy Bullets suffers from highly repetitive level generation. At least half of the items in the game are fairly useless, and the same can be said for many of the upgrades and extra weaponry. Although not inherently bad, the player's bullets are not projectiles in the traditional sense - should your reticle center on an enemy's weak point, they will die the moment you squeeze the trigger, regardless of distance or movement. Additionally, enemy aggro relies heavily on line-of-sight, making it easy to pick off enemies one-by-one in most rooms. These atypical mechanics add to the quirkiness of the game, and feel very appropriate amongst the other design choices.

Overall, it's a lite game, yet I can tell already I'll be pouring hours into this beast.  It isn't an ""action"" game so much as a survival (rogue-like), and you have to be careful and somewhat strategic with your limited resources or else you'll lose it all.

So, the developer has dropped this game and ran. After people complained enough in the forums, he finally said he was releasing a ""fix"" in the next coming weeks, which from what I can ascertain, never came out. So people pestered him on the forums some more, he said he'd try to get it out in the ""next week or so"" after it never came out, people, again, questioned him on the forums. What did we get? Nothing, and it's been like that for a few months now. Don't buy the game. The developer has given up on it. A shame too, it was a perfectly good game. Goddamnit, this happens too much to good games.

OLD REVIEW
NO LONGER RELEVANT, LEAVING IT HERE FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES ONLY.
-----
This game really takes a meat cleaver and cuts of all the fat surrounding the ""Rouge-like"" 
catagorization.
The game itself is simple, yet odly fun.
You go into the game, a suppposed security failure has happend and security turrets are opening fire on customers to the hunting grounds, you were sent into to, yep, basically kill everything. This game is just great, I don't see how it could get better.
Maybe another gun?
Hey, but that's just me.

The game itself is very simplistic graphics and style wise, and has a very dungeon-like feel, what with the 3 hearts and such.
The game itself is difficult, increasing each level, i myself got clusterf*cked by turrets on the 4th level.
All around great game, I usually play it if i'm bored or want ti oass some time, amazing game.
If you want a rouge like game, that dare I say is actually a ROUGE LIKE, buy this game,

* IMP : uma animal de cor escura que corre na sua direçao na tentativa de mordelo . 

*Cobra : que se camufla em plantas e o ataca o deichando envenenado oque faz com que voce perca vida com o passar do tempo e que só é anulado com o antidoto. 

*Vespas : sao como os IMP porém com asas 

*Arrastador: sao IMP com garras que sao usadas para se proteger dos tiros e que causam maior dano .

*Torretas : sao o proprio sistema de segurança , robos que morre apenas se voce acertar no nucleo de força (caixa verde que esta sempre ao lado deles ) 

*Inseto Bomba : uma especie de frambosao (aparencia de fruta) que corrre suicidamente em sua direçao e explode .
entre outros inimigos 

a também os itens que vao desde um poçao para regenerar vida ate , um bombas  ,cada qual com a sua utilidade voce só pode carregar um item por vez entao varia com o estilo de gamplay do jogador .

a mecanica da gameplay é muito interessante pois o jogador pode recuperar as balas disparadas pela sua arma, que só tem capacidade para seis delas. Quando o usuário atira, seja para atingir um inimigo ou em uma parede, a bala cai no chão e fica disponível para que ele a pegue de volta e recarregue uma a uma manualmente. Ou seja, munição é um elemento de extrema importância aqui, então, faça cada tiro valer a pena!. 
 Ao longo das fases voce se depara com caixas eletronicos e lojas fixas uma maquina onde pode comrar mais balas iten e etc (por sinal nome das lojas fixas tem o nome de ""balas e etc..) ja nos caixas eletronicos voce pode vender itens , depositar seu dinheiro  para caso voce morrer reiniciar com dinheiro e ter uma certa facilidade , alem do mais vc ainda pode comprar testamentos , e e o ""seguro de vida"" 
  Em Heavy Bullets a morte dos inimigos é facil porem a sua também pode ser caso nao tenha a ""tatica"" certa me cada fase ,alem do mais quando voce morre nao importa em que fase esteja voce volta direto para a primeira (por isso é muito util depositar o seudinheiro) 

Opiniao Pessoal :
Heavy Bullets é um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa que traz alguns elementos bastante originais para um estilo que envolve sobrevivência, gerenciamento de recursos e um bom nível de habilidade. A jogabilidade é bastante simple.
O fato de ser necessário recolher as balas e recarregá-las uma a uma adiciona um grande nível de desafio ao jogo. A experiência se aproxima de um survival, já que o personagem é perdido, caso sua vida chegue a zero.
Este fator é o que pode ser considerado o maior ponto positivo. pois graças a ele o jogo fica bastante dinamico e requer muita habilidade e sua cota de experiência em horas de jogo para chegar cada vez mais perto do mainframe a cada nova tentativa.
Os gráficos possuem um estilo não muito detalhado e repleto de cores vibrantes em neon.(ala Antichamber) Apesar de ser um visual muito bacana para algumas pessoas pode encomodar ou dar um certo desconforto .

é isso , no geral gostei muito do game , apenas tive que me acostumar com as malditas cobras com as quais voce tem que conferir cada planta para nao sofrer um ataque ""surpresa""

Heavy Bullets has decent enemy variety, and I like the art style. The shooting and re-usable bullets mechanics are not great in my experience, I would have preferred more variety. The bombs that you can throw are very hard to hit anything with and generally seem useless, so you're just going to be sticking with the revolver for the majority of the game. Items might be interesting, but I have no idea what any of it does. Some are self-explanatory, but what does a golden skull do? I just played a run through with one, and I have no idea what it did, if anything, because the game makes no attempt to tell you. I don't need to be spoon fed, but at the same time I do need information if I am to understand what stuff does. So I picked up some repellant, what does it repell? You can't test it by hanging around the various enemies, because you will end up getting yourself killed, and the game doesn't tell you one way or another.

The ease at which you can get screwed over by the game is not balanced with enjoyable game play, in my opinion. Stressful, tense game play is welcome, but there aren't any ""fuck yeah"" moments, no moments of ""that thing I just did was awesome"" to balance it out. There are also technical issues, if you are considering buying this game check the forums before you do. Currently (and for a while now) there is a bug causing really bad frame skips that can really screw you over if you happen to be trying to shoot something at the time. The aiming reticule is also not locked to the centre of the screen so it jiggles, and for some users wanders quite far from the centre making it hard to be accurate.

Unfortunately, it has just enough problems that I wouldn't recommend it to someone.

First of all, the entire gameplay through each of the levels is quite fun. It reminds of more of the type of shooting you would do in counterstrike as opposed to quake. It's all about peeking corners and out-reacting the enemies. Pretty much everything you can shoot gets destroyed in one hit, which makes the combat more satisfying and fast-paced. 

Sometimes, an enemy will notice you before you notice it and utter a cry, giving you a warning and a bit of time to respond to it before it gets the drop on you. Those sort of situations are definitely fun because you actually know what you could've done differently if you take damage. It keeps you on your toes, too, because you're always trying to listen carefully for enemy cries. I think it adds to the tense atmosphere in a good way.

Other times, however, you won't be able to get the enemies without completely leaving the corner and you'll have to strafe around the room trying to dodge the turrets and other enemies. The turrets' turning and shooting behavior is very unpredictable which makes these sort of forced situations very frustrating because there doesn't seem to really be a reliable strategy for dodging them. Furthermore, I found it very difficult to shoot while strafing in this game - it seemed like the game was always stuttering a lot when I was trying to do this, which is frustrating. 

Also problematic, for a game that's all about aiming and shooting and lightning fast reflexes, it absolutely should not be having occasional lag/stuttering. Unfortunately, it has that and it seems to have it right when enemies are attacking me or coming into vision. It's not very freuqent, but it's enough to be annoying and mess up my concentration or ability to track what is going on enough to start taking damage. I am not alone in having this problem, so don't assume you're not going to have this issue either.

Finally, the biggest issue that makes me not want to recommend the game is the difficulty spikes. Specifically, I'm talking about the level 4 and final bosses. The level 4 boss is ridiculously challenging and doesn't at all fit with the methodical, patient playstyle of the rest of the game. Going in blind, you're almost certainly going to just die in a few seconds. Further compounding this issue is that, once you die, you don't get to quickly try again to see how you could've improved (which would be a very satisfying game loop IMO). You have to then carefully plod your way back through the first four levels. I found myself getting impatient because I just wanted to have another go at the boss, and I would end up dying before reaching it because the game really requires a patient, methodical playstyle. This is, of course, highly frustrating, and it feels like the game is just trying to waste my time. It's like, I've already demonstrated I can handle the first stages, just let me go back to where I was at the edge of my abilities, where games are most engaging, dammit! 

The final boss is even worse in this regard. It's absolutely overwhelming when you first encounter it - there's so many enemies, new elements, sounds, etc... that it's just impossible to make sense of it your first time. And you have to play through eight stages again to even get to try to understand the boss after you inevitably die. While you're playing through the stages, you're not really getting better against the boss either because you play through the stages with such a different playstyle than you would need to use against the boss.

Overall, the game is intense, atmospheric, twitchy, and responsive (compared to the bullet-sponge type FPS gameplay in similar titles). If you like the sort of FPS gameplay in counter strike and are looking to spend a lot of time on mastering something like that, you may like this game. But if you're someone like me who just wants to have a fun gameplay experience, you probably will find this game more frustrating than fun because so much of your play time will be spent doing things that you already feel you've mastered.

Where to start? At first, I'd like to say that this game is nothing for people who expect to finish the game within the first or second run. Death is permanent in this game and one of the essentials in the whole gaming concept itself. Once you're dead, you have to start the whole game again. However, the effects of death can be overcome by thinking of a clever strategy and planning in advance. 

But what is this game even about? You start with a normal revolver filled with six heavy bullets and three bombs at the first level. The main mechanic of this game implies that you have to pick the bullets up in order to keep your revolver full to the brim. However, as you wander through the maze-like generated world, you encounter many sorts of enemies with their own and unique weak spots which you have to find out in order to make up your own way of beating the game. The game gets progressively harder and you'll be facing boss enemies at the fourth and the eigth level. Of course, you cannot beat them without proper preparation. That's when shops come in handy. You gain money by killing enemies, items by purchasing or finding them throughout the whole game (they can be both, passive or active) and special perks by upgrading your skills. With the right combination, you'll be able to finish even the worst enemies off. 

This makes the game amazingly challenging. If it seems like you can't get past a level, you have to try harder. Don't stop until you have successfully beaten the stage. If you do stop however, then you're in bad luck because you may never get past said stage. The game forces you to play extended sessions which makes you come back for more. Furthermore, I do have the feeling like the game is adjusting to your style of playing since the more you play this game, the harder the earlier stages get. (If someone could verify said assumption, that'd be great.)

This is not just a FPS game where you are supposed to kill every enemy in sight. It's quite the opposite once the gears are running. With every death the game teaches you about the things you did wrong. Being in a tricky situation doesn't mean that the game's random generation is trying to outsmart your tactics, but you may want to think about a new strategy then. 

The art style is very simplistic but still neat to look at which adds a bit of friskiness throughout the whole game itself. One thing I greatly acknowledge is the game's soundtrack. Although the game makes you think that you're in a serious situation considering that your inventory space is limited and you have to make choices wisely, the music emitted from the medbays, bullet shops and banks knocks you out of the skies and shows you that you may need a second to recover and think about how you're going to progress. It's not all about guns and bombs, you know?

However, there are a few minor bugs in this game which will (hopefully) soon get patched, but influence your way of playing heavily at some points. Sometimes, enemies recognize and attack you although you're not in plain sight (or/and if it's not declared in their attacking scheme), but hidden behind a wall. Sometimes, the game seems to lag out for a few frames periodically which can delay your actions significantly. However, like I said, those are minor bugs and will eventually get removed some time. They are no reason to consider not buying the game.

After all, I'd like to say that Heavy Bullets is a nice and refreshing twist for everyone who wants to take on a new challenge. The key to success is to never give up no matter how impossible a certain situation may seem. Everyone who thinks that this game is about blindly killing enemies is out of position. The game requires good reactions and a strategy to fulfill.

스포를 원하지 않고 정보만 얻기를 원한다면 
5화는 엔딩이 있으니 주의 바란다.

돌죽으로 시작된 로그라이크(이하RL)붐은 꾸준히 장르의 발전을 가져왔고
비록 젤다 1 던전의 아류이지만 바인딩 오브 아이작을 통해 
르네상스 시대를 맞이했고 그 아류의 아류들도 계속늘어나고 있는중이다. 
그와중에 변형장르가 생겨났고 
나는 이 장르를 FPS(일인칭슈팅) 로그라이크 (이하 FRL)이라 부르고 있다.

FRL은 로그라이크를 좋아하는 유저중 FPS도 좋아하는 유저들을 타겟으로 하는 
변형장르로 로그라이크와 같이 한번 죽으면 처음부터 시작하는 FPS를 뜻한다.
아직 이 장르는 발전단계로 나도 3개정도의 게임밖에 접해보질 못했다.

이상 기본지식은 끝내고 본론으로 들어가자.

헤비불렛은 6발짜리 탄창을 가진 매그넘을 들고 최종 스테이지까지 진행하며
적대 물체나 몬스터들과 싸우는게 목표인 게임이다.
일단 여타 로그라이크와 같이 이 게임도 플레이어가 성장하는 게임이다.
허나 그 성장에도 한계가 있기에 본인이 FPS 졸못이라면 
일찌감치 때려치우는걸 추천한다.
제대로 조준하여 맞출 수 없다면 게임오버 화면만 눈앞에 보일것이다.

이 게임은 플레이어를 몰아세우기 위해 만든 게임이다.
로그라이크 특성상 캐릭터를 업그레이드 하거나
상점에서 체력이나 관련 업그레이드를 살 수도 있기는 하다
하지만 일단 존내 비싸다.
물론 은행 시스템이 있어서 죽기전에 넣어두고 꺼낼수는 있다.

하지만 그게 쉬울까? 일단 예를 한번 들어보자.

일단 캐릭터의 기본 체력은 하트 3칸.
몬스터는 잡으면 3코인쯤 많으면 5코인쯤 준다. 여튼 한 8마리 잡다보니
초보라 당황해서 두방맞고 피 1칸이 까였다. 소지금은 28코인..
 
마침 자판기가 있어봤더니 힐링이 30코인이다  
힐링 아이템같은거 나오겠지하고 다시 탐험하다가 
폭탄을 잘못던져 한번에 하트 1개가 까였다 (폭발은 2배 데미지)

그리고 힐링아이템도 못찾고  어찌저찌 60코인을 모으고 
힐 가능한 자판기를 만났을때 이미 피는 반칸밖에 안남았고 
오아시스를 만난것마냥 기쁜 마음으로 힐을 누르지만 
한칸만 치유되는것을 보고 망연자실 60코인을 다써서 2.5칸으로 만들고
돌아서는 찰나 독벌레에 물려 독이걸리고  한 반칸쯤 까겠지 생각했는데 

피 까이는건 멈추질않고 결국 반칸이 되서야 멈추고 
망연자실하고 문을 열었더니 터렛 세마리가 반기고 겨우 돌파하여
출구문 발견하여 열려고 하니 적이 가까이 있어 내려 갈 수 없다는 
메세지 2개는 터트렸는데 컨트롤 미스로 사망
(여기까지가 실제로 한번에 겪은일-10% 각색)

다시 여차저차해서 회복도 안하고 500코인을 저금 성공 
처음부터 은행을 찾아 200 코인을 꺼내 체력업그레이드를 찾으려 했으나
관련 자판기는 보이지 않고 결국 재입금도 못하고 사망
(경험담)

그래서.. 재미는 어떻냐고요?

하...

빡치는게 재밌습니다.

레트로 감성도 살아있고.. 뭔가 싸이키델릭한 분위기에 브금도 좋음.
단 하나 아쉽다면 아이작처럼 브금이 계속 나올줄 알았는데
긴박한 상황에서만 간헐적으로 나오는게 아쉬움.

[h1] Heavy Bullets [/h1]

[i] My ordnance has some girth to it.. [/i]


Well, after spending what Steam says is 3h. I believe i can deliver a reasonable review. In that 3-hours i have managed to die about 5 times and the best run led me to level 7. Then i got blindsided by a walking turret, that might have no-clipped through a wall... That has happened before, i have my livestream VoD as evidence.

Anyway about the game.

Heavy Bullets is an FPS Roguelike, that is hard as f*@%ing nails. Sporting some rather simplistic, but strangely enthralling graphical style. I don't know why i feel that way, might be because of the strange neon-gradient hues. Which remind me greatly of Hotline:Miami.

Speaking of things that are great, the games soundtrack, again simple but the strange melodic beat of the main-menu is easily one of the more memorable opening themes i've heard in a while. And there seems to be a soundtrack for sale as well, so i might as well go pick it up since it is just that GOOD. There is also another game thats music is equally amazing, i must remind myself of playing it enough for a preview (because its in early access).

The main mechanic of the game is that bullets are recoverable, which is a great idea. Because it forces you to go and collect them back, this forces you to think and time every shot, as optimally as humanly possible. Which creates some tension, as bullets are somewhat scarce. Like any roguelike there are items, rather good ones at that. including a knife. Although after using it a few times i found it, both a bit awkward with the possibility of rather overpowered usage. Since it seems to kill (at least the little doglike things and batteries on turrets) one shot, not sure whether that's a plus or a minus..


Now, although i enjoy the game immensely. I must note some criticism i have for it, mostly on the side of optimization. Since even after i dropped all the special-FX, the game had strange small hiccups now and again. Now this has said to be a common accurance, however since there is no real reguirement set for the amount of graphical memory you need to run the game, i cannot say anything more about it.

Now the game still has some bugs in it, this is very evident since i managed to find two occurances where an enemy no-clipped through a solid wall and killed me. And just so you know, i got evidence of that.. It was one of the violent cranberry-creatures.

I cannot really say more of the game, it's still in early access. But since Steam up and changed everything, so the logo is not visible on the page. Make a note of this..

But to summarize:

- Simplistic, but effective visual style.
- A roguelike, in all the sense of the word.
- Interesting mechanic.
- Great music.

I would recommend Heavy Bullets, because it is one of the tougher and dare i say suspensefull roguelike experience. Not the best by any means, but it gets pretty close.",1412711429,1412711496,True,3,0,0.530797481536865234,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+ The atmosphere has just the right amount of unnervingly odd.
+ The RNG plays a moderate role neither too powerful nor too arbitrary.
+ The concept of scarce but retreivable bullets plays a well-executed and very central role.

The catch? You have only 6 bullets for your gun - fortunately these are the titular 'Heavy Bullets' and once discharged can be picked up and used again.

Don't think for a second the game is easy, though. As you might expect from a game with roguelike elements, your character is pretty flimsy, and each room usually contains about 2-4 enemies; with your finite bullets this prompts a steady yet swift aim to kill them. The enemy type themselves are few but they each have their own behaviours and traits to get used to and new enemies are met in later floors. Speaking of, there's 8 floors in total, with a boss at the halfway mark at then a climatic boss on the final floor (of course). 

Along the way you might come across vending machines to aid you and depending on what kind of vendor they are they will sell you health potions, extra bullets and... your last will (like you needed to be further convinced this is a game you won't complete in one run). Alternatively, you might get a keycard to access an otherwise locked off room, which will provide an item (or occasionally a powerup) to further assist you.

Graphically the game looks unique. It looks somewhat chunky and uses some vibrant colours; predominantly pink and purple, there's flashes of cyan, green and silver too. The bold visuals, in my opinion, contribute to the tension aswell, as it makes the enviroment feel alien and hostile. Combine that with the synthetic sounding warblings of your character and that of enemies, it feels like you're playing in one hell of a fever dream.

In closing, Heavy Bullets manages to provide an incredibly tense experience due its titular mechanic - its not so much a case of ammo conservation, more a case of good marksmanship under pressure (read: having 3-4 enemies chasing after you). The graphics and sound too will help you get immersed in this neon hell, but overcoming its trials is a deeply satisfying experience.",1412585341,1412585448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Well done 1st person shooter roguelike with Devolver-worthy art style. FOV adjustable up to 120° horizontal (which is how I played it). Has all the necessary options for regular PCs. It's really worth the 7.5€ full price, you don't have to wait for a sale.

You have a six-shooter. It shoots big bullets that you can fire infinitely many times, except you have to pick them up again first. While you can find or buy more bullets, the game is balanced for bullet recycling. You can buy upgrades that increase your pickup radius, but you'll go where you shoot anyway, because the levels are one long very broad corridor that is separated into slightly labyrinth-ish compartments that are procedurally assembled. Every level has the same length, and there are 8 of them, but every play-through of the game is different. The boss fights are in the same place each time, however.

Heavy Bullets is in a way a wee bit like those story-based 1st person action adventures we've learned to love (like e.g. Deus Ex) except reduced 95% to the shooter aspect. HB's story is only a frame in which the game takes place, nowhere is it actually part of the gameplay. The looting is there, but very limited: From time to time, a kill yields an access pass for (any of) those pink door rooms with a random bonus inside them. And there are pedestal in some places that have goodies (e.g. bullets) on them.

There are also several kinds of vending machines (which you can explode for money) where you can buy upgrades but also things like a permanent discount or like insurance that returns some of your carried money to your bank account when you permanently die - accordingly, there's a vending machine dedicated to banking. You can deposit to and withdraw from your persistent account (So, you can play, deposit, and die if you want to eventually make a run with lots of resources.), and you can even store/withdraw an item permanently.

The various objects (modifiers and weapons) that are available ask to be used intelligently, especially since inventory space is very limited (but you can buy a backpack which you absolutely should).

You even have a wee bit of open world / hub experience because you can go back (at least on the same level, of which there are 8 - each randomly assembled) to make use of vending machines and dropped objects (which don't go away, but you can't return to a previous level), and getting back to those places can be tricky because the doors are harmfully laser-protected if you advance too far beyond them (towards the end of the level - it's quite a corridor experience). But sometimes there are two doors leading the same way, so just open one on the way in, then open the other on the way back to fetch stuff. You can also just walk through the lasers, which costs half a heart - this can strategically make sense.

Comparing the game directly to Deus Ex and such of course doesn't make sense, but as you can see above, some of its gameplay elements are present in limited form, and incidentally I (Fervent Deus Ex fanatic.) have played the game already for over 40 hours even though a relaxed play-through takes from 25 (There's a speedrun achievement.) up to 100 minutes. I have no idea what happened on [url=https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=20940]HLTB[/url] where the average of all playstyles says something about 8 hours - nope, never, that's complete BS. Anyway, it's not remotely like those action adventure games, but in a very metaphorical way you have the same kind of game freedom / action / tool using / inventory managing going on.

Levels are not varied enough, items/upgrades barely change your experience of a run and there is a disheartening lack of any feeling of progression. In short, there is not enough content to spice up your countless failed attempts to beat the game.

Heavy Bulletsは見た目は微妙ですが、よくできています。
ゲーム自体は短く、30分ほどでゲームクリアできます。
ただ、難易度はそれなりに高く、初見殺しも大量にあり、初挑戦ではほとんど進むことができないくらいです。
しかし、何度も死んで、対処ができるようになると長生きできるようになっています。
少しずつ奥へ行けるようになり、また新たな壁にぶつかる。この繰り返しです。
どちらかというと、FPSの腕より、プレイヤーの経験のほうが大事だと思いました。

ランダムジェネレートについて

10時間ほどプレイしましたが、ランダム性についてはかなり良い物があるとおもいます。
意図的に地形に死角ができるように生成され、気をつけないと奇襲されますし、
また、注意深く壁を調べていくと隠し部屋が見つかったりします。
慣れるとすぐ分かるようになるのもうれしいです。

良い点

・スピーディーなゲーム展開
・ランダム生成
・銀行やLast Will(遺言状)といった救済システムの存在

悪い点

・ジャンプが無い
・ゲームのテンポを故意に落とさせる一部の敵
・やっぱり見た目？


最後に、

マップやレーダーといった物がないため、ときおり、
堂々巡りをしたり、道に迷ってしまうことがあります。
方向オンチな人にはあまり向かないかも。

It’s difficult to tell if they’re sinister or just willfully ignorant of human rights, sending a janitor down into the depths of their intricate hunting grounds to find out why the mainframe is going crazy and turning the park’s security systems against the very people they’re meant to protect. Plopped down into neon hallways that look like they could be very delicious popsicle flavors, all you have is your gun and your wits about you. As you progress through the 8 layers of hell, there are vending machines and hidden secret cases holding useful items like rockets and homing grenades, as well as a few items that make you wonder how they ended up there in the first place. Using the ritual blade will, for instance, harm you for an entire heart’s worth of damage in exchange for giving you back the exact amount of money you’d need to heal that heart back.

The crux of [i]Heavy Bullets[/i]’ gameplay loop is simplistic genius. Whenever you fire a bullet from your gun, you have to run over to it and pick it back up again in order to reload it into the revolver. At first you only start with just enough bullets to reload an entire cylinder but you can eventually find, buy, or have bullets given to you through inheritance. There’s a slight margin of error in most rooms near the start but you’ll need to come to grips with your twitch action skills before the halfway point. Messing up a shot will require you to dash into danger, more often than not to recover your rounds, and, even with your [i]Quake[/i]-speedrunner pace, you’ll still likely take a hit or two. My heart was pounding in the later stages of the game, even after I had upgrades to increase my reload skill, bullet recovery distance, and extra hearts!

As per the standard for roguelikes, you’ll be dying often as you come to grips with what the game demands of you. This will start off as a tad bit of an annoyance but the game does offer some small level of continuation to ease you into that one run where everything will go right. Available in the vending machines are purchasable items that allow you to pass a certain amount of money you’re carrying into your bank account when you die or, more importantly, the Last Will item which deposits every penny you have on you as well as any bullets, bombs, and keys. You’ll be given the latter three instantly at the start of your next run. This is pretty much the key to being able to afford as many health and stat upgrades as possible during a run. I, myself, had built up almost $1,000 in the bank before my first successful run, during which I spent a good chunk of that reserve.

Just when you start feeling comfortable, the game tosses new enemy types at you and changes up the scenery a little bit. Instead of the simple walls that looked like they could have been gradients on a new-wave CD stacked in Tommy Vercetti’s car, some blinking computer bits and crude technological chrome begin to adorn the walls. You’re also given a flashlight after a certain point, though the game never truly puts you in the complete darkness. Sadly, it only changes so much visually but, then again, you’re hardly really looking at the walls when you’re constantly fighting for your life.

In keeping with the minimalistic approach, the sound design is sparse but executed with razor sharp precision when it counts. Music occasionally cuts through the deafening silence to energize a particularly ballsy suicide run on a full room. Corny musique pipes through the vending machines, coming across more like slot machines tossed out from a casino on the dead end of Vegas city limits and re-purposed. Every creature and malicious turret has a unique sound of their own that you’ll familiarize yourself with rather quickly. Learning the telltale signs of each is key to surviving large and tricky rooms that use tall grass and rocks to block your line of sight. Some players complained about the music’s lack of presence, but I feel the use of silence is extremely important in not only building up the tension of every fight but also to let you listen in on these clues before things get really hectic.

For all that [i]Heavy Bullets[/i] does well, though, it comes at the price of not having much in the way of replay value. Once you’ve beaten the final boss you have nothing further to really do. The game’s achievements hint at a few challenges you could try but, in the long run of things, you won’t be able to easily put 100+ hours into this like many other games in the genre. When stacking it up next to games like [i]Eldritch[/i] or [i]Fancy Skulls[/i], it hardly has sea legs worth holding onto for more than a few playthroughs. Unless you’re a fan of replaying for the sake of the challenge, 3 heart only runs with no potions like some insane [i]Zelda[/i] speedrunner, it just may not be enough. The basic experience, the thrill of that first completion, gives a nice sense of accomplishment and I think the tense silent moments broken up by spurts of greased-lightning violence are exceptionally well done. But having limited ways of killing things presented to you and randomly placed setpieces which you’ll eventually become familiar with will certainly bum out players earlier than usual. Is this enough to dissuade you from picking up the gun? Well, that’s entirely up to you, partner. You just have to ask yourself one question. [i]Did I fire six shots, or only five?[/i]

There are many aspects that this game has pretty much succeeded in.
- Graphics, Designs, Animations, Levels, Idea, Style. sounds

Not sure if this should be called Retro but it is something like that.

Although it is a roguelike, you can use the bank to store your money or weapons or whatever for the next gameplay so it has some progression into it, you can keep storing it as you like.

A Shez load of items, Some can be used and some are passive effects.
The best thing i like is the Gun and reload technique it is quite entertaining, bullets fall on the ground you can pick them up and reload, so you cant just randomly shoot and then stay with 0 bullets while being chased by enemies , no you have to make sure that every bullet counts.

- Buying usable items as powerups or explosive stuff, and health potions and everything makes it a great Rogue-Like indeed i can see myself spending 40+ hours on this game, and it certainly would take a lot of time to finish it .


The game is very challenging, At the beginning its quite hard to understand but gets better the more you play you begin to understand what each item does and how they work, and the game relies on speed and quick reflexes so it keeps things interesting, and thats one of the things i really love about this game, the movement the actions the shooting its all fast the game is fast it does not feel boring or sluggish at all, its incredibly fast and relies on accuracy in shooting.

Shops, Some that sells Heals and antidotes, other sells bullets and items and bombs.
Theres even life insurance in the bank and a Will ( So your items remain with you even if you died).

I love those sound effects and music they are bloody perfect and the sound of every Gunshot is like music to my ear i just keep spamming it all the time  ( got me killed a couple of times )

Freaky fast enemies that gets so happy when they see you and run after you, and some hidden and hard to see and turrets and more and more and more!

TL;DR : 
A very addictive challenging Fps Roguelike that is well-done and has some progression in it not just perma-death and 100% worth trying.

Pros :
- Nice graphics and designs and levels
- Unique shooting style.
- Shops to buy items from and a bank to deposit money or withdraw and more.
- Nice set of enemies and things to kill.
- Great sound effects and music.
- Very high replay value, Achievements, Trading Cards and secrets.

Cons : 
- Not popular as it deserves to be.
- Steam did not promote it so i actually only heard about it after it existed early access states...

Yes i did not find anything that i disliked about this game.
no i have no connections to the dev or anything i am being 100% honest i really liked this game and i am still playing it now and will keep on for a long time ( Its my Rogue legacy Gun version )

You should definitely try this game out, i can honestly say in my opinion it is worth every cent ( although i got it for free so i have no place in forcing  that statement )
 never knew FPS Roguelikes can be this fun from now on i will try to expand to more games i thought i'd play.

Thanks to my friend Timmy for giving me this game ( all those who bought it at early access received an extra gift when it was released officially and he was kind enough to give me his). <3",1411150385,1432233480,True,22,0,0.511719286441802979,0,False,False,False,False,,,

FPS controls are super responsive and accurate, so it never feels like you've been ""cheated"" out of a shot - they always land exactly where you want them to, and this makes it all the more satisfying.

Mas o que me chama mais atenção, mais que o visual e jogabilidade, é o tanto que o jogo é ""hostil"".

It has the unique distinction as being one of the only Rogue-lite FPS games I've ever encountered, and it really milks that label for all its worth. With a colorful, neon design and blocky 3-D graphics, it's a pleasant break from all of the ""retro"" pixel games that have been coming out recently, so it's visually appealing as well. 

Now how is the gameplay? In Heavy Bullets, you are given a revolver with six slots. You can fire these six bullets and then pick them back up to reload into your gun. Sounds simple, but when enemies begin swarming you, you can quickly find yourself separated from your bullets, which are now all the way accross the room. The game itself is extremely challenging, though as you get accustomed to the controls and gameplay you can feel yourself improving. The gunplay is responsive, if a little finnicky at times and killing enemies is satisfying, as they explode into a cloud of coins and bullets. Secret rooms and locked doors make exploration a pleasure, and a unique banking system allows you to store money and items for future runs, a feature that I really appreciate. 

However, I must say that the control is a bit of a mixed bag. You move extremely fast in this game, far faster than any other FPS I've ever played, and this means positioning yourself for strafing kills or aiming can be a challenge until you acclimate to the lightning speed you move at. Items are also a part of the game, but they too suffer from some flaws. Certain items are more useful than others, and some are even detrimental. (why would I want running shoes if I already have trouble controlling my character?) Bombs are extremely difficult to use without hurting yourself in the process, and the in game text is a little bit vague and hard to understand. (Carry Item+ does NOT let you carry an additional item, it just lets you carry more of the one you already have)

All this being said should you buy Heavy Bullets? I would say absolutley. Even though it's still in development, the game is already really tight and feels really satisfying to play. Considering that the game is only going to get better as time goes on, I would say that it is worth it to purchase it now, especially if it goes on sale.

The 80's neon aesthetic along with the blips, bloops, and 8-bit electronica really complement the retro genre. Mechanics like the bullet recycling and the cross-playthrough banking system are fairly original and pretty damn genius.

The gameplay difficulty is just right too; hard enough that it's not at all a breeze, easy enough that you won't rage (too much). A lot of how you do is based on luck, but it only makes it that much more rewarding when you stumble upon some extra health potions or treasure. Good reflexes are key to making it out alive. Each playthrough makes you learn from your mistakes, making the next run that much easier.

Enemies are nicely varied, each requiring a seperate approach and strategy to fight. There is a plethora of items to use, ranging from the absolutely necessary to the down-right silly (most notably the high heels).

The randomly generated levels may be constructed from recognizable template layouts, but still manages to make the encounter around the next corner unpredictable. Enemy placement is also randomized, but not unfairly so (i.e. you won't open a door to find a turret in your face).

As far as what can be improved upon, as this is an early access game, a co-op or even multiplayer mode with friends would be really fun. Some AI behavior could use some tweaking, but none of it is detrimental to gameplay.

That's what this game says and it's what you'll say after playing this game. This simple (and incredibly small) shooter is definitely worth a purchase. Here's why:
- Simple, in build and in gameplay: Take away all the complicated controls and randomized gameplay elements in favour of concrete gameplay and exceptional playability
- Small: This game is less than 100MB, even better than that it runs on next to nothing memory wise!
- Fun: There's plenty of secrets, items, upgrades and options for playing this game. If you'd rather be a fast gunslinger then all power to you! Invest in run speed and extra bullets. If you prefer a calmer approach then improve your bullet magnet and get some extra health!

There's very little I don't like about the game, just one thing is there's a extra anti-aliasing option that seems to draw very excesssively on performance and for some reason reduced the overall look by a considerable amount. I also think the proceduraly generated thing is a bit of a gimmick because it seems moreso that rooms are randomly selected and given small changes to the walls without much else being different. 

Regardless, the challenge you face, along with an excellent soundtrack incline me to score this game quite highly, but small drawbacks are going to push my overall rating down to a humble 7.5/10

It's got a bright neon color palette, It's a Roguelike. It's hard as balls. What's not to like?

I can't exactly say I've gotten very far at the game (as of writing this I maxed out my run at Level 4), but it's apparent the first time you die and go, ""I could've done that better,"" that this game hits a sweet-spot between RNG and skill.

The main mechanic of the game besides the Roguelike elements is the fact that your bullets are limited. Specifically, you start off with only 6 bullets, and must retrieve your bullets after firing. For most of the game, it's not a particularly compelling mechanic, seeing as you're generally already headed towards whatever you shot to collect the coins, meaning you get your bullet back most of the time regardless. Where this mechanic shines, though, is those moments when you are absolutely screwed. The high-octane, adrenaline-filled moments when you're surrounded by 6 enemies and realize you only have 2 bullets in the chamber, and so you sramble between shooting the targets closest to you while scavanging for your fallen bullets. 

As you progress through the levels, you're introduced to a very nice curve of enemy variety that will all asbolutely pop up and scare and/or murder the hell out of you the first time you encounter them (looking at you, Bush Worm Thing), but never in a way that feels cheap, as every monster has their tell, so once you know what to look for it comes down to being able to accurately pull the trigger. That being said, it doesn't mean the enemies aren't challenging. Hitting a Bomb Bug before it gets too close, or successfully shooting the battery of a Turret while strafing its shots is downright hard, requiring a good deal of skill and sometimes level-design RNG.

You have the ability to store cash and items if you can find the right vending machine, which is really nice, and not as broken as it might immediately seem in a Roguelike, since the vending machines themselves are randomly generated, meaning that often times you can't actually make use of being able to withdraw that cash or you have to run the risk dying while carrying a boatload of cash while searching for a vending machine to use it on. 

Overall, if you're looking for a fun little FPS to play, you'll probably like Heavy Bullets. You might find other games for $10 that are worth more of your time if all you're looking for is a game to shoot things in, though.
If you're looking for a new Roguelike to battle the RNGods with, you'll enjoy Heavy Bullets. That being said, this game I'd say relies more on skill than RNG. I've yet to go a bout in Heavy Bullets and feel like the game just gave me a bad run, since FPS skills can pretty much trump any bad RNG you get, so it always feels like it comes down to your ability to shoot things well enough. 
If you're specifically looking for a Roguelike FPS, your $10 are certainly safe with Heavy Bullets. Go buy it. Now.

My only real complaint is that your character has a very strange soung design attached to him. Whenever you drink a potion, and sometimes when you take damage, your character makes a very deep gurgling-type sound. Scared the dickens out of me first time I heard it, and I still instinctively think it's an enemy by the way it sounds every time I hear it, but as far as complaints go, it's a very minor one.",1403730240,1403730240,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game is a Rouge-like FPS, given 6 bullets with a pistol, you are given the task of shutting down a mainframe, clearing 8 levels of enemies that can be incredibly tough or simplistic, you are given 3 hearts, each hit takes down half a heart, when you kill an enemy, you are given several coins and get to pick up the bullets you shot off, these coins can be used to purchase many things including more bullets, Bombs and Health as you do not regernate at all.

The 6 bullets you are given does count, miss numerous shots, and you will have to run over and grab them which could be near an enemy, it poses an incredible danger to miss, so don't miss at all.
Doing this review I've put about 4 and a half hours into this game, and I must say, it's one of the best indie games I've played, 2nd favourite Rouge-like game (Only behind Binding of Isaac). Encountered only one bug (Which is impressive) throughout the entire time, although had it numerous times, it's easy to fix thankfully.

It's incredibly addicting and very challenging, have not been frustrated yet but it's getting there for sure. In short, for the $10 price, it's one hell of a fun game, easily a worthwhile purchase. I cannot wait to see how this game turns out to be like, Since it's in early access, I'm sure it'll add many new things that will keep me playing for a long time

At first all they do is run straight at you but as you progress through the game you encounter more and more advanced enemy types, for example: one enemy has armor and cannot be killed by just shooting at it it requires you to bait it to charge at you, afterwards you dodge its attack and shoot its weak spot on its rear.

Fuck you, and your beautifully difficult game. You've introduced a challenge into my life that is both infuriating and addicting. The sound design is excellent, and forces me to enjoy Doseone's fantastic work while I actively avoid snakeworms and try to find that last round I errantly fired in a panic. The use of simple enemies and principles used to slowly teach you the unforgiving nature of this world is expertly done. I'm only about 5 hours into this game as I write this, and I still haven't managed to get past  the goddamned turret boss on level 4. I thought I had him dead to rights in my second encounter, but I was immediately immobilized by a snare turret when I entered the room, and died in like a chump with a red potion still in my inventory. I relish the idea of dying here, as I continue to get tripped up on other randomly generated bullshit on the way up. This is what my lunch breaks have become: an infuriating catharsis in which I swear more in an hour than during the rest of my day combined. And I wish it could be longer.

Bottom line: This is a fantastic randomized game. Roguelike, roguelite, whatever you want to call it, Heavy Bullets delivers a challenge that is well worth the price of admission, and I can't wait to see what future updates hold.

Everything is made of simple shapes and high contrast colours and shadows, combined with a sightly glitchy image filter layer over it.

The levels are short, the tempo and difficulty are high. You don’t have that much health and ammo and every corner bares the risk of dying. It’s fast and thrilling. The levels are randomly generated with every new play through. There are a couple of enemies and different items, which can be found in levels or bought at vending machines. I haven’t played it long enough, but there seems to be quite some depth buried behind the simple mechanics.

Heavy Bullets reminded me of Superhot or Eldritch in a lot of ways. Glitchy or retro graphics, fast gameplay, short levels, high stakes, many deaths.

The first thing you'll notice when you look at the game trailer for Heavy Bullets are the vivid neon colors that the game uses. The art direction for this game is without a doubt pretty unique to this era, it's something we've really not seen a lot of sine the early 90's.

The gameplay is to be expected from a first person shooter, it's fast, precise and simple without any unecessary features or buttons. The reload and ammo feature in this game must be its strongest feature by far, as it stops you from conserving or scavenging for ammo. The vendor machines that are scattered around also contain some nifty perks, upgrades and items for you to use and they will save your life when you're in dire need.

The roguelike elements compliment the game nicely, it keeps it all fresh and exciting so that you won't get burnt out by it. It has more or less everything you're looking for in a roguelike inspired game; permanent death, procedurally generated content, randomized monsters and items, high difficulty and so on.

The only negative I personally can say about this game so far is that it needs more content. It's currently an Early Access Game so hopefully the developer takes this to mind while working on it. More weapons, perks monsters, traps, items and rooms/areas would certainly help the longevity of the game.

If you're into roguelike inspired games, just want something new and unique or if you're into games like: Tower of Guns, Rogue Shooter, Black Ice, Paranautical Activity, Fancy Skulls, Eldritch or Delver then I'd highly recommend Heavy Bullets. It's a fun little indie game with a lot of charm and I'm really looking forward to see where the developer takes it further down the road.",1401005122,1401005775,True,2,0,0.50285714864730835,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Count your shots and steady your aim.
That is what you are going to be repeating to yourself in this frantic 1st person rouge like shooter that has the movement of a quake or unreal tournament game but with half the health and way less ammo. 
The game has an interesting presentation which is of that of a PS One era game with polygons as its main focus. It is nice to see this in an indie game since the indie scene has been oversaturated with 2d pixel animated side scrollers. It is a good change of pace and makes me think of LSD dream emulator. One game i kept thinking of when i was playing this game was Receiver. Receiver is another game that does many things this one does. They are both 1st person roguelike games, they both have a polygon style and both force the player to manually reload.
 This is where counting your shots comes in. You have an indicator in the bottom right corner of your screen that shows you how many bullets you have in the gun as opposed to just a number. This is important since the game only starts you out with six bullets. When you get into a fight you better be ready because they can be fast and only last a matter of seconds and if you miss your shots you better be ready to run, but with no ammo you're not completely out of luck though. The game allows you to pick up all bullets you have shot.This means unless you have a melee weapon you are going to have to dodge and weave past turrets and other enemies to get to the bullets you fired.
 Time to talk about the roguelike aspect of the game.Ugh, is it just me or am I tired of hearing roguelike lately. It has become a real selling point for games lately. Just slap on the roguelike sticker on it and its guaranteed to sell a few copies. Some do the roguelike better than others, so how does this game fair. Actually pretty good. Its nowhere near the best but it feels good and not just a way to give permadeath and have it lengthen the game. I mean it does lengthen the game but the challenge is good and the randomly generated items each time you play add quite the variation. It has a banking system that allows you to save money and items across playthroughs.
So you have only half a heart left and 100 coins, go put that money in the bank and make the next run easier. Storing items is also extremely useful to make it even easier.
I actually want to take the time to talk about the Items. In the game you can only carry one item at a time, some have active effects such as the rocket and others have passive abilities such as the silver heat that allows one hit of damage without you getting hurt. It also breaks in half and falls to the ground after you get hit, no my broken heart. There are also items that you can sell at the bank and get even more coins. Some items are potions that will give you special powers such as a few seconds of bullet time or just heal you.There are also melee weapons you can get such as the knife and the pickaxe with will let you break rocks to get ore which you can sell.
My personal favorite item is the teleporter. It allows you to set a portal in a spot and at any time jump back to it instantly. 
This game is a fun waste of time and for 10$ is well worth the price. I can’t wait till the game goes full release. I give it a 7.5 out of 10.",1400906347,1408255552,True,2,0,0.500241219997406006,0,True,False,True,False,,,

That, combined with the already 15% off'd price convinced me to give this one a go despite my typically intense dislike of both Steam Early Access and Procedurally Generated Roguelikes.

To the former issue, it's fine. The game is basically done and only really needs a release to throw down 'chieves, pokemon cards, and all the other heavy-handed fanfare that accompanies even the most bizarre and unwarranted of steam releases. The most I can say is that the music is a bit finicky, going back and forth between desolate silence and ZOMG COMBAT!!! mode at points where one or the other would be more applicable. It almost brings up the question of why the game is even on Early Access at all. It seems like the developer genuinely seems to want quick feedback from players to help polish the final copy before release rather than doing a quick cash grab to make everyone pay 40 to 80 bucks for a glorified wireframe alpha build like everybody else does these days.

But there I go being cynical again. Now then, on to the gameplay.

The gameplay is standard rogue-likey stuff except the combat isn't total floaty garbage. It has a few glaring issues, but for the most part is quite solid. You fire your gun, your bullets the size of soda cans hit your enemies in the soft gubbins, and then they explode in one hit. Enemies actually take a bit to bring you down since you get a pretty generous healthbar for a roguelike, able to take six hits from most regular mobs until dying. Non-boss enemies die in one hit, as stated, but some of them will only do so if you hit them in a particular weak spot, like the power generator for turrets a-la-Receiver. After firing your coffee-can-sized rounds from your Ruger 2.00 caliber Velociraptor, you can pick your bullets back up again like firing a nerf gun and then OCD-ingly making sure you picked up all the foam darts even though you have three more in your pocket because losing them will haunt you for the rest of your days. This adds a surprisingly fun and compelling ammo dynamic where you always have very little ammo and yet paradoxically more ammo then you'd ever need.

In the first half of the game, there are three enemy types: snakes, chompers, and turrets. Interestingly, these enemies represent the best, average, and worst aspects of the combat respectively. Snakes lie in bushes almost perfectly camoflauged and strike at you out of nowhere, more than once causing me to jump out of my chair and scream random expletives. They can also poison you, which sucks just about as much as getting poisoned has since Final Fantasy One and Pokemon Red and Blue. As much as I would typically throw these off as ""cheap"" or ""unfair"", the ammo dynamic meant that I really didn't have any excuse not to throw a bunch of gigantic bullets into the bushes before I went exploring for health potions, so they actually helped endear me to the game.

The chompers are typical videogame fair. They charge at you mindlessly, bite you when they get up close, and die in one hit. Nothing special, but they get the job done. Later on in the game they ""spice it up"" by throwing spider chompers, flying chompers, or that eternal unwanted scourge of all shooters that is apparently as easy to shake off as Zaire-strain Ebola and just as entertaining, the Kamikaze chomper. SSDD really, but nothing wrong with mindless mooks in a shooter. If anything, they make the encounters with snakes all that more epic.

The turrets however are somewhat of a pain. To kill them, you have to hit them in their power generator, which can often be placed behind them when you enter the room. Often you'll have to thread your shots to hit their core, which would be easier if your bullets weren't the size of goddamn coelocanths. Often, you'll attempt to thread a shot only to have your enormous rounds ping ineffectually off the turret's impenetrable hide. The turrets however are bound by no such restraint, as the most common ones fire lasers, which will ALWAYS hit you if you're not moving and will usually hit you if you are. Luckily, they can be easily evaded by jumping over them which has the slight downside of a jump button NOT EXISTING IN THE GAME.

Which brings me to my main gripe about the combat. The combat is essentially a modified version of an InstaGib Railgun match in Quake or Unreal Tourney, and as such it is ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE to not have a jump button. In addition, this would add to the dynamism of combat by allowing you to jump away from those evil snakes or jump over and around a horde of munchers. If anything should be added, I think this should be prioritised.

As to the rest of the game, it's a standard roguelike affair with upgrades, cash, and permadeath. Worth noting though is that the game has a rogue-lite banking system that allows you to store money for future runs, store valuable items, and even allow you to keep your items, upgrades, and a percentage of your unbanked money on death for a modest fee.

The problem with this aspect is that most of the upgrades just aren't worth their salt. Speed can be upgraded, but you already move like a crackhead. You can upgrade reload so that you mash in more bullets with each button press, but you can already reload as fast as you can push the button anyway. You can upgrade Bullet Magnet, but there's an item that does the same thing as having maximum rank in that stat, and it's pretty easy to find on each playthrough. The inventory system is a bit daft too, in that there really isn't one. You get to hold one item. That's it. This sounds pretty good in theory, especially for a roguelike, but in practice it means that you'll be ignoring just about every consumable you find because you found one item with a passive ability on it that turns you into a bullet god. Sure, you can upgrade your backpack to hold more items, but good luck saving up the 100 coins needed for that one, or having two items you want to store in the first place. In fact, why have a Bulletgod Relic and 3 consumable rockets when you could just have 2 Bulletgod Relics?

Really though, the game's actually pretty decent and it's worth a pickup if you enjoy roguelikes and other stuff like Receiver or Tower of Guns, though it lacks the intricate gameplay setup of the former and the depth and complexity of the other. If you're not into that kind of thing, it's still probably worth kicking about whenever it goes on sale. It's fun, but flawed, and that's honestly not half bad.

This exceeds any rogue-like FPS before it in every way, and ups the ante by having very well-thought out and carefully planned gameplay. The action and combat are more than solid, intense and the atmosphere is engaging; with enemies that can pop out of bushes killing you in a heartbeat, the panic of realizing you haven't loaded all those bullets you picked up, all powered by a pulsing electronic soundtrack that creeps up on you as you come closer to dangerous areas.

The roguelike elements here work *very* well. You are placed into the thralls of a glitched neon world with harsh and bright hallways randomly generated everytime, the goal is to reach the end of each floor and eventually make it to the 8th floor where you're tasked with resetting a malfunctioning mainframe. Sounds simple, but equipped with only your 6-shot revolver this will prove to be a true test in frustration as there are monsters, turrets, and worms hiding around every corner to whittle away at your already very limited life. The floors are randomly littered with items to help with this, and you'll find banks where if you're playing smart enough you can buy life insurance or deposit money that carry over into your next playthroughs, making things slightly easier each time.
