TLDR: Not a lot of gameplay and a lot of terrible design decisions kill this title's entertainment value

Review: Too narrow a script in which you get insta-killed for deviating. Unclear hint system in the form of birds in the sky that actually guide you to dead ends and police encounters. Visuals are untextured, environments are bloated and expanded but full of empty building shells, empty streets, with very scarce hotspots populated by the odd one NPC scripted to stand there or interact with a scenery object. Entire world is non interactable and will only allow any form of progression if you are at the exact right spot at the exact right time. Game feels self contradictory about the plot. Intro talks about quarantined neighborhoods and what sounds like martial law, but the game never mentions or enacts any of it. Going to the subway the protag mentions he does now know his way around a city as an excuse not to allow progression instead of something more internally consistent with the game plot. The game also gives you very mundane objectives like, find your dad, or drink a cup of coffee, while at the same time maintaining this nearly post apoc quarantine setting that involves a serial murderer no less. To make matters worse the game just decides that you are in fact the serial killer and you start getting hunted down by police in some kind of weaksauce cardboard black and white GTA experience. Eventually I got sick of walking into crime scenes, walking into buildings, or just taking a wrong turn across a street and getting given an immediate game over screen. Found a hideaway by following the dumb birds but ended up in front of a condemned building with no door handles. The game is woefully missing any kind of audio on offer, and for an atmospheric noire walking simulator that is inexcusable. The game takes some strange liberties with how it renders details. Such as not including pupils in the eyes of NPCS which gives it a surreal phantom-like representation but completely clashes with the wannabe ultra-gritty realistic noire sin city atmosphere they were shooting for. The game has a mechanic in which a sound effect is played when a plot event triggers. On my first trigger the sound effect blared like a siren for what seemed like two dozen loops. The game spawns you in a room with a revolver but wont let you take it, and wont let you come back to your room once you get in trouble.

On the positive side the black and white aesthetic and the occasional rain effect really goes a long way into making the visuals digestible if still barebones. The game has the class of making mention of all the free tools that were used in the creation of their product, as well as thanks the respective forum communities from these softwares for their help. The idea of adding a minimap was good, if not all that well implemented or useful in a city full of empty building facades. I also thought that giving the players the option to turn the nonsense survival hunger gauge deactivated was a good idea. Especially given how many insta death traps this game keeps shoving in your face to begin with.

In conclusion, I do appreciate the few areas in which this game shows promise but it does not offer a compelling experience in my humble opinion. It feels almost more like someone trying their hand a making a cityscape, making a few hotspots to try their hand at it and calling it a day.

The game received massive update. It is now more pleasent to play this game. There's what it is like after the update

Soo, I've tested it with new ending and all the additional chapters. I'll start with pros
- Dialogues (subtitles) are noticably improved. It is now more pleasent to read them
- The controls while you're drunk are less frustrating. That's super cool
- The camera work is slighty better
- New dialogues and sequences that help understand what is happening and what do you need to do
- Filled some gaps in story
- The idea of Extras and how'd you make it is great. I just notice it and I visited every room :D

But there're still elements that are bad
- Mouse pointer often disappears in pause menu and I can't do anything without a cursor
- The additional content VD Massacre chapter is still extremely messy. I know I need to get the knife, but HOW? There's police everywhere. I kill a policeman in Mindy's cafe and then what? I can't kill anyone, I can't do nothing.
- The inventory does not work in VD Massacre. The ""I"" key redirects to the pause menu

[h1]PROS[/h1]
[list]
[*] Cool idea with birds in the sky showing you points you need to be heading
[*] You can interact with pedestrians (not all of them, but still)
[*] I like the concept of story of 2 people blending with each other
[*] ""City is full of scam, why sohuld I be any other"" I really liked this quote ;d
[*] I didn't notice any bugs
[*] Multiple endings
[*] Free additional content
[*] Developers didn't abandon their game
[/list]

[h1]CONS[/h1]
[list]
[*] Despite I appreciate developers' design idea, colors are just too 'grey'. There're no contrasts, nothing. Everything looks the same.
[*] The subtitles are too small or just badly positioned. You need to stare at the very bottom of the screen at the dialogues while there's something happening somewhere else. 
[*] Ugly interface. Maybe menu is the only thing that looks better than the other elements.
[*] Big, vast city, where every building is almost the same. And most of the game you need to wander through this city. It gets really boring and it is very easy to get lost since there're almost no characteristic points.
[*] No tense. Maybe if music was little more tense it would help the game, but without it it is extremely flat and boring
[*] Some dialogues disappear too early
[*] You need to eat garbage food from trash in order to survive ( you can disable it ). The idea was good, but unfortunately it does not work in this game. It just frustrates sometimes.
[*] The controls when you're drunk (or high, idk) are some kind of joke. The most FRUSTRATING, BROKEN, IRRITATING part of the game. You don't know where to go, how to control your character. I was close to just close the game and put it in the traaaaaaaaaash. GOSH! Did somebody test it?
[*] The additional content ""Paint town in red"" or something like that is completely incomprehensible. The game does not tell you what do you need to do. You just wander around aimlessly. Do you need to kill someone? Or beat the game again as you did a while bedore? Who knows.
[*] Story and dialogues are numb. However, they're not the worst, I've seen worse.
[*] HUGE gaps in the storyline.
[/list]

[h1]STORY[/h1]
[spoiler]You play as two characters. Former boxer, who divorced with his wife and started to drink and a police detective who's drug addict and eat food out of trash. You wake up as a boxer with huge hangover and you hardly remember what did you do last night. It appears that there was a murder on a guy who was sleeping with your wife. When police officer tries to ask you a few question you kill him with a coffee mug. After that you are wanted by the every policeman in the city. You need to hide. All this time a police detective who has your case is chasing you. In the end, the boxer commits SUDOKU on the roof of his hotel and detective is getting praised by his boss. The end.

A small team and low budget production indie Game and walking simulator. I dont want to tell too much about the story, but it has 8 endings and some choices (like suicide by the pistol, jumping from the roof of the hotel) and a other few things to discover. Sure some endings are nearly the same, like have they evidence vs the real killer or not. Do you try to escape or go into a showdown. There are even some missions you can do for extra infos of the story, but sure there could be more. Thats what i hope to get for a 2nd game. Graphics have their own atmosphere, you feel lonely in a world with less details and people, but you can enjoy this little small details you found maybe, that normally will be overseen and you can focus on the story.Sure, I wished there would be some more version with more details like cats running, mountain bikers, skateboarder, rollerblades/in-line skates, scooter and a old woman with a dog. It wasn't in the budget but they can hopefully do more in the next game, if more people support this game. Sound is good at first, but if you hear it many times it loses a bit of its charm because there is a limit of sounds you can use with less money. In the extras you can see parts of the designs, sounds, other stuff like concepts and maybe a good hidden secret, but dont expect to much. The developers are friendly. If you have something you wish to change just ask The Pancake Man, he is very busy but very helpful too.  This game has 3 extras in the chapters, after you finish the game once, little extras like a darker mode, a little extra mission walk and an epilog. Enjoy the hole place on your first walk without the hungry system and then you can test it. 

Sure this game could be better, use vehicles like taxi or other fast movements and use more buildings like the museum, the pizzeria, the casino and make many different things.  Making a prologue where you can search your way to get the money and your target, but it has the first step on this way. I hope the next games can make it step by step better like using more rooms, but for that we need to support this likeable little developer team with fair reviews, contact to the developers and money. So i can only request all gamers, please give this game a chance and dont ignore it because the bad reviews. Test it yourself for 2.99 the price is between fine and adequate. If you want reading a fair review about this game then use that one from Moustached, because he played this game 30 hours and knows many more details than everyone else (developer not included). 

So i give this game because all of this arguments and hopes for the future a 86 % for walking simulator fans, 73 % for indie fans, and 57 % for normal/ neutral gamers. If you dont like indie or walking simulators, please ignore this game. Thank you for reading. I hope i could help you a wee bit with your decision and the buyers are happy with the game.

[h1] DEUTSCH: [/h1]

Dieses Spiel ist das erste Spiel von Rising Sun Interactive auf der Steamplattform. Ein kleines Entwicklerteam mit wenig Geld und einer unabhängigen Herstellung, da kein Herausgeber unterstützt hat, was in meinen Augen schon eine beachtliche Leistung ist. Die wenigen Entwickler haben eine längere Zeit an diesem Spiel gearbeitet. Zur Geschichte möchte ich nur wenig erzählen, aber es hat 8 verschiedene Spielenden und einige Wahlen (am Anfang selbst erschießen, vom Dach des Hotels springen usw.) und man kann einige Entscheidungen treffen z. B. flüchtet man ins Hotel um zu verstecken oder doch lieber zu einer Baustelle mit offener Kanalisation um die Stadt zu verlassen? Die vielen Schlussszenen haben meisten nur kleine Unterschiede, wie z. B. wird der wahre Täter geschnappt oder war er so klug und hat den Beweis verschwinden lassen? Manche Aufgaben sind nur da um weitere Einzelheiten und somit neue Erkenntnisse über die Geschichte zu erfahren, aber es könnte noch mehr Nebenaufgaben und Informationen geben. Ich hoffe es wird einen 2 Teil geben, der diese Schwächen verbessert oder im Gleichgewicht zum Rest des Spiels gar zu seinen Stärken macht. Die sichtbare Darstellung hat ihre eigene Stimmung. Man fühlt sich alleine in einer fremden Welt, die wenigen Einzelheiten an Gegenständen und Mitmenschen ist ziemlich gering, aber man kann sich freuen, wenn man an abgelegenden Orten wie einem begehbaren Hochhaus mal einige wenige Kleinigkeiten findet. Natürlich wäre ein Nutzen dieser gut versteckten seltenen Gegenstände noch besser gewesen, aber so konzentriert man sich eben mehr auf die Hauptsache des Spiels, nämlich die Geschichte als Mittelpunkt. Ich hoffe im 2 Teil wird es mehr Dinge geben, die das Spiel mit Leben füllen wie vielleicht einige streunenden Katzen, Katzen die Mäuse jagen, Katze die von einem Hund gejagt wird, Zeitungsjungen, Fahrradfahrer, Taxis, Busse, LKWs, Rollschuhfahrer, Inliner, Scooter und was nicht für Möglichkeiten gibt, aber kostet ja auch alles Zeit und Geld, diese Dinge ins Spiel einzufügen. Die Hintergrundmusik und Geräusche sind gut bis ausreichend. Das Spiel sollte anfangs ohne Druck ohne Hunger-System erstmal ausgiebig erkundet werden von Aussen nach Innen und erst beim 2 spielen sollte man vielleicht mal das einfache Hunger System nutzen, es ist eben nur ein kleines Extra um etwas Realität ins Spiel zu bringen, auch wenn Essen aus der Mülltonne natürlich schräg ist.

Das Spiel bitet in Chapters noch 3 kleine Extras, ein Modus mit 2 zusätzlichen Aufgaben, nichts großartiges, ein Epilog mit ebenfalls kurzem zusätzlichen Ende und einen dunkleren Modus mit Taschenlampe und falls man will einem Hunger System, dass herausforderner ist gegen die Zeit anzutreten.

Man sollte sich von den schlechten Rückblicken nicht zu viel abschrecken lassen und lieber die Kritik von Moustached lesen, der hat diesem Spiel 30 Stunden gewidmet und kennt es wohl fast so gut wie die Entwickler selbst.

Für 2.99 kann man bei der Arbeit, die so ein Spiel an Herstellungszeit brauch, nicht vieles falsch macht. Wer Gehnachbilderspiele mag sollte es testen (persönliche Note 86% Gut), wer einfach gerne alle Arten von unabhängigen Spiele mag (Note 73 %) und/oder hilfreiche/ freundliche Entwickler mag / unterstützen will, der sollte dieses Spiel nutzen. Für alle neutralen Spieler gebe ich 57 %. Die Entwicklern freuen sich über persönlich Mittelungen, was Ihr am Spiel mögt und was nicht oder weniger und wie man es vielleicht verbessern könnte. Ich hoffe einfach auf einen 2 Teil, der dann noch mehr bietet, aber wie alle großen Entwickler brauchen Sie am Anfang ihrer noch jungen Firmengeschichte Kapital um sich die nötigen Mittel für eine Fortsetzung zu haben. Vielen dank fürs Lesen und hoffentlich ein genügend Spaß mit diesem Spiel.

I played the demo of this game and after I've completed it, I simply couldn’t resist buying it. If you can’t decide whether you want to buy it or not, try the demo first.

tl;dr This game is one of the best I played in a long time. It's very organic and well balanced in almost every aspect: story, music, visuals and gameplay. 

[h1] Story [/h1]

Take role of one of the two protagonists striving for survival and/or better life (which is quite difficult, as you will find out). The tragedy of this city lies not only in the recent terrorist attacks, but also in the appearance of an unknown murderer wandering the streets. The game has 5 chapters (with more to come in updates) and multiple endings, depending on choices made by the player.

[h1] Music [/h1]

The developers used music from freesound, masterfully picked and corresponding perfectly. It may be repetitive sometimes but never bothered me, especially radio tracks.
Dialogues are completely silent and show up in the form of text, which some players will most probably consider a flaw, even though it doesn't affect the overall feel of the game.

[h1] Visuals [/h1]

The game has a minimalistic black & white (and sometimes red) graphic style, very atmospheric and pleasant to my taste. The city buildings and streets look very solid and appealing to the eye. If you don't expect graphics like in major studios titles and can get used to overall game style you won't be disappointed.

[h1] Gameplay	[/h1]

In each chapter you are free to go wherever you want, you can chat with people, visit different places and explore the city itself. The game has many little secrets which do not change the track of the main story, but can still amaze when you find them. Some choices you make are really important to the story and will lead to the different endings.

Navigation system is a bit confusing at the very beginning of the game, and you will sometimes find yourself lost in the city and not knowing where to go. The map and birds in the sky can help you orient though. After you play through the game to your very first ending and get familiar with the city, it ceases to be a problem. Your first playthrough can take up to 3 hours, the next ones will be shorter if you know exactly what to do, or may be even longer if you enjoy exploring as much as I do. Some chapters of the game are just literally jaw-dropping and had a high impact on me.

The quietness of the game makes it difficult to be attentive to most of the dialogue since subtitles seem to be overly missed in contrast with the dark, gray scales and obnoxious bright white that populates the game. Most of the time, determining what character is being controlled at the moment is difficult unless players are gifted in multitasking and can diligently watch the sky for birds while reading the subtitles that tend to show without warning. This takes much of the immersiveness away from the game since the story tends to be overlooked in favour of the gameplay.

      The basic environmental structure is bland to say the least, which is mostly the case for Noir themed media; and ironically “Bland” is a brightness option in the settings but changes are barely visible. Despite using the old-style theme in Angels That Kill, the tones utilized in the game are intense and harsh. Some players may find the game tends to strain the eye and that headaches ensue. 

      The gameplay is standard and simple with the options to pick up items, examine surroundings and run slightly faster than the default speed. The game implements a hunger bar but players have the option to switch this mechanic on or negate it from the beginning of the title. When the hunger bar is in effect, players must search for edible food in dumpsters to replenish it or fail to do so, which will result in your death. The hunger bar doesn’t really affect the gameplay much if players are quick to complete each chapter before the player even has to worry about it. Controls are sluggish and can be frustratingly annoying -- especially when one character is suffering through a drunken stupor -- and forces players to navigate the streets with inverted “WASD” controls that seem to interchange when you turn down a street. 

   Someday I would like to make another playthrough of the game if changes ever occurred.

The game’s city may have also been killed, because it certainly feels dead. It’s bland, vacant and every area looks the same so navigation is frustrating. The map isn’t very helpful because there’s so few distinctive landmarks. Crows hover over your destination, thankfully, because that’s the only way I could figure out where to go.

The game’s interiors are so dark that what little is there is difficult to see. There’s not much to interact with, and I’m not sure why there’s an inventory at all, as I failed to find a single item I was able to take with me.

Your character’s movement is glacially slow - “running” down the long empty roads is a chore. This is made even more irritating because you need to consume dumpster food to survive. You might spot a dumpster in the distance and traipse down the lane only to find that it's one you’ve already scraped out. It’s also disruptive and unnecessary, I had to leave a crime scene to find a garbage-meal before I collapsed where I stood and was forced through the whole scenario again, and I mean the entire chapter.

Also, it ain’t noire. Noire is more than rain and a monochromatic colour palette, it’s a mood, one that is largely evoked by music, of which this game has almost none. When it does, it isn’t noire.

That's what this game should have been called. It is empty and devoid of any logical story development, game-mechanics implementation and video-audio representation. I understand that this is a work of a small indie team, but clearly this game did not went through proper quality checkup. 
The messy and incoherent story, or what's left of it, is about a down-on-his-luck boxer and a detective who are involved in a series of murders. It was intended to be presented as a noir game in style and feel, but it ends up butchering its own ideas with many baffling decisions. It wants to be a classic point and click adventure game with ""meaningful"" choices where the player can take a look at every nook and cranny, but it also puts a ridiculous survival mechanic where you have to hunt and pillage trash dumpsters throughout the city to stave off hunger meter that keeps draining quickly. It looks like game developers put a fail mechanic in the game just to avoid labels like walking simulator. In the end, you are left with a police officer who has to interrupt investigation of crime scenes and talking to witnesses, just to run down the street and stuff his face in the pile of rotten food like a pig!
Game looks abismal, and while I understand it tried to keep a minimalistic feel to it, there isn't an ounce of texture anywhere, making the game look monotonous and painful to the eyes. Except a quick jazzy tune and a somber song, there is no music whatsoever, and that goes to sound effects as well.
I'm certain that Angels That Kill is not the worst game I've ever played, hell it's not even the worse game that I'll end up playing among many untouched steam games in the library as well, but it also isn't ""so bad it's good"" material. It's just bereft of anything meaningful; an empty, shriveled husk made out of good intentions.",1448383586,1448391709,False,29,4,0.736177027225494385,9,False,False,False,False,,1457411234.0,"This is a bit of a copy-pasta from another review I commented on but it still applies here.

I would just like to let you know that we appreciate all forms of criticism because either good or negative it helps us learn and build upon what we know for improving this game or for making a new game in the future. 

Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I am genuinely not mad at any of the reviews, Im just happy that I got to publish a game on Steam, I know a lot of indie developers do, but it still means the world to me that I was able to do that alone and I will continue to work on Angels That Kill until I feel that it is truly a finished game based off of the feedback we have gotten as a whole.

I know that this game wont please everyone and Im honestly not trying to because at the point where I would try to please everyone would be the point that Angels That Kill is no longer what it was intended to be.

This review is honestly one of my favorite ones for the game, it sums it up quite nicely and gives us enough feedback to be able to work harder and with a clearer focus.

I don't quite see why this argument(the comments below) even exists but it does seem a little pointless to me since the whole point of Steam Reviews is for feedback and to show other gamers your personal opinion on the game.

In any case this does seem like it has gotten a little out of hand and I really would appreciate if Leon could not be so forward in everyone else's reviews, while I appreciate the sentiment, it is not quite appropriate and I genuinely do not want to have to report anyone over a little indie game like this.

Everyone try to have a baller day and take care."

This game has been in development since 2013. For that couple of years in development, we have around a month of work, well, really lazy, unplanned work anyway. You pay around £10 for an extension to something that had to be rushed in thought and it very much shows. 

The problems that existed a couple years ago are still here; not being able to navigate effectively, comedically bad controls, absolutely minimal explenation for what youre even doing or where you should go and a lack of anything that could immerse you. In fact thats my main problem with the game, it tries to be something immersive, an engaging noir experience but what you get for your £10 is barely any sound, awful animations that were in the release a couple years ago and a camera that is constantly tilting down and to the right. The way the camera moves is enraging to say the least.

Earlier I mentioned the problem with navigation, allow me to indulge with you the pure idiocy of the navigation system; the whole you are located within a city complete with skyscrapers and fog, the ONLY way to know ehere you are going is either by memory (more on that in a minute) or by birds in the sky. Those birds do not stick with you and tell you where you are going they just hover over where you are meant to be. Now do you see the purely stupid connection between fog, skyscrapers and small birds? Exactly, you can only see them when you are close. The whole game you have to run around the massive, bland (immersion problem again )city to hopefully find your way. It doesnt help that your character os only outfitted by his, presumably, somewhat crippled legs. In the top right section of the city there is a map, you can find that map by conveniently running around confused and running into it by chance, handy right? That map gives you three landmarks by which you can identify the city. Only three.

Finally, people seem to have an issue with the art style of the game. I have to agree and disagree with them.
Why I disagree with them: 
I personally see what the developers were going for, i find the look of the game very charming but not very well done. 
That brings me to why I can agree:
The art style is very bland, the city has no sound, only about 7 buildings have any detail at all on them (the rest are just big, grey boxes) and the fog gets in the way more than it gives any aesthetic appeal.

So as a summary, its nothing more than an unpolished, bland, unappealing mess.

We have also noted the issue with the camera several days ago and have the issue posted in the bugs thread here on Steam, it has to do with controller drivers being on while using the keyboard to play the game. Turning them off fixes this issue."

[i]Game:[/i] Angels That Kill
[i]Genre:[/i] Noir Adventure
[i]Developer:[/i] Rising Sun Interactive
[i]Publisher:[/i] Rising Sun Interactive
[i][u]Copy supplied by developer[/u][/i]

[b]Angels That Kill[/b] is a first-person noir adventure game developed and published by Rising Sun Interactive. As some of you might know, I love the noir genre, but unfortunately this game was a big disappointment.

[h1]STORY[/h1]
The story follows two different characters: one is an ex boxer who is down on his luck, and the other is a detective who is trying to discover the murderer that's been terrorising the city lately. In the 5 chapters short chapters of the game you will see different situations from the eyes of the protagonists. While this is a good idea, the overall story is barely interesting (mostly because of the absence of voice acting). You can talk to just a handful of characters, and they are all very bland. However, I do like that you have some choices during the story that will lead you to one of many possible (albeit disappointing) endings.

[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]
The game uses the Unity engine, and the performance is pretty solid all around. Unfortunately, this game is graphically very unpleasant. While it isn't the first noir game to use black, white and gray as its main colors, my eyes were feeling tired while looking at the screen.
The huge city doesn't feature that many civilians, the buildings all look the same and there is nothing interesting to see, which is a shame. I do believe that making this a more linear story might have improved the graphical department.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
The game is basically a glorified walking simulator: you usually just go from one point to the other, and on the way you might find a couple of NPCs to ""chat"" with or an item to examine. There are also a couple of instances in which you must avoid police detection, which means you should stay at least 10 feet away from a cop car. Other than that, you don't do much. And the worst aspect that makes this game feel like a chore is the city: it's just too damn huge and confusing to navigate. You do find a map, but it's way too stylized to understand exactly where to go, and especially where you are. There are some birds that fly over your objective, but they are white against a white sky, so good luck finding them.

[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]
Other than the stealth sections, the game doesn't feature much challenge at all, and most of the frustration will come from you trying to find where to go.

[h1]SOUND[/h1]
Easily the worst aspect of the game: the game lacks basically any type of sound effects, with the exception being footsteps and the alarm of cop cars when you are caught. The music is mediocre at best, and it barely plays during gameplay. There is also no voice acting at all, meaning that all of the dialogue is written, and the cutscenes are completely devoid of sound, creating either awkward or boring situations.

[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]
There are 5 chapters, and in each one there are subtle choices that will change the outcome. There are also 8 endings to unlock and a some secrets that make replaying the game more rewarding.

Overall, if what you read sounds interesting to you, you will enjoy this game. However the lack of sound and boring city make this a game that will make you tired after a while. It sucks the fun out of most things.

The game isn't bad, Its strange, but not bad at all. It has its quirks, and its ups and downs like every game does, but by far it's not a bad game.
The style of the game, is dark, it even mentions it in the description. It following through with saying the games dark grey to black and white style is true to that of noire films, with a low detail style behind it, might not be the best choice for traditional noire but the game hits key points within the genre.
Pro's of the game are,
+Its style is enjoyable, I can see the minimalism in the game, but the fine details of the little things are what count the most.
+Its music is good, very pleasant sounding, even if a tad repetitive.
+The games minimalistic plot and Stark dialog leave a lot up to interpretation but after replaying the game several times, the story comes together bit by bit, adding a fulfilling experience.
+the game does have many small tasks besides the main story line
The cons of the game are,
-There are at times a lack of sound, making it somewhat daunting to keep roaming around. 
-sometimes the monochromatic feel of the game is off, but it's also based off of old noire movies which are black and white, along with being dark grey. (the brightness helps though if you turn it up)
-The game is directionless, and it is hard to navigate the city at times but without the map you can also find other things to do and people to talk to.
-It sometimes feels like a glorified walking simulator 
Overall, 7/10, It’s a good game, maybe not the best game. You should probably buy it when it's on sale.

I tried to talk to the kinda dark grey people with glowing white eyes, but they were feeling kinda dark grey and didn't want to talk. Bought a kinda dark grey coffee, and drank it.

Before I could leave, a kinda dark grey police officer with glowing white eyes tried to ask me something about a murder, but a coffee cup flew randomly into his face, and he went to sleep, so I decided to leave.

I wandered around the kinda dark grey streets overshadowed by tall kinda dark grey buildings for several minutes looking for some guy in a place, didn't know where, but I vaguely recalled it was kinda dark grey.

Realizing I had my journal, I decided to refresh my memory, and learned that I could get maps from the police station.

After wandering in search of the police station for several minutes, I ran into a kinda dark grey man with glowing white eyes who told me there was a pizza place to the northeast, but alas, I had forgotten my compass.

Then a kinda dark grey police car stopped in front of me. I was going to ask directions, but then the game ended.

This will be a summary of all the major points in my full review (linked below):

Story: The story seems fairly decent but the limited dialouges and frustrating gameplay elements make it difficult to desire more.

Gameplay: Easily the most frustrating part of the game. Unfortunately the game revolves around walking around a big, empty, boring city with absolutely no navigations. I found it extremeley frustrating and essentially took away all fun the game had.

Sound: I liked the music, sound effects were lacking however.

Design: I see a style I really like here, however with a simplistic design (little color, simple models, and no textures or lighting) you'd think the game would make up for it in other elements, it doesn't. Unfortunately the design feels extremely lazy.
