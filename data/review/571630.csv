The game consists of 20 physics based levels, some of them are very simple, others make you feel clever, others the main issue is your handling of the items.

The puzzles are pretty simple, where ""stacking"" will be your more required talent.

You throw ropes out of your hands, and you ""grab"" boxes, crates, barrels, spheres and other items and stack them so they are touching a floating orb, they have to stay there for a few seconds until it registers, then you finish the level.

Some levels made me think ""how am i gonna solve this!?"" until something clicked, or i looked up and around to find something i might have missed. A couple of levels where a bit frustrating as i felt it was more ""luck"" that i could fling something correctly into place (not that it took that many tries) or maybe i was trying to solve it the hard way??

There is teleport only, but you dont ever leave the island, which is the only environment in the game.

Overall the game has clever puzzles, a very calm setting, good music for the setting, and personally i liked the physics, performance was great (+120fps), graphics are... ok i guess, they are boxes.

You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/wOT5YdjFIzo

I actually bought this physics puzzler back in October of 2017 and back when it was meant for coop play. I paid $4.99 on sale from the normal $9.99 retail price. Well, now this game is out of Early Access and it's normal price is $4.99 USD and it is now meant for single player only (ignore all the old reviews). Yeah, I paid too much. This game isn't that good.

It's not that bad either though, as long as you can look past several issues. The biggest issue for me was the low frame rates. So this is a physics puzzler game. The problem is that when you try to do the physics part ... by using the rope or bringing several objects together, the frame rate takes a big drop. I went from a steady 90 fps to 45 fps whenever I tried to do the puzzles. 

You're in an island environment. It looks nice, for a 2017 game (just okay for 2020). However, it's probably causing the frame rate dips with all the waves in the water, the palm trees swaying in the wind, and the bird flying up in the air. I'd rather have a vanilla background if it would mean I could do the puzzles without these frame rate dips that effect gameplay. 

I found most of the puzzles to be super easy and I was able to solve most of them instantly in my mind. However, executing the solution was another matter. There were this one puzzle in particular that took me multiple attempts and many minutes before I was finally able to get a lucky throw to knock off a suspended crate that was up in the air. It was more frustrating than anything else. A few puzzles maybe took me a few seconds to solve. Those were generally satisfying to complete. In all, this game took me about 2 hours to complete. It can probably be completed in 30 minutes or less if it was a smooth & polished experience though. 

You have teleportation only for locomotion. You only have snap turning. There are no settings to adjust. I did experience a few bugs. There were some collision detection issues and clipping through objects. Sometimes the physics would just go haywire and the objects would go flying. I would also teleport suddenly back to the starting area.

[b]Rate 5/10. Do not buy if you don't like physics puzzle. Even if you love physics puzzle, I would say wait for a deep, deep sale or just completely pass unless you want to deal with all the issues the game has. [/b]",1589935922,1589936021,True,1,0,0.533073961734771729,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I really liked the island environment. the music and ambiance is very relaxing. I think I could just sit on that beach and mediate, without ever bothering to try and solve the puzzles.

The puzzles start out very easy, and serve has a good introduction to the mechanics of the game. The puzzles do a very good job of progressively getting harder as levels progress, but not overly so. I also really liked the items used for the puzzles, they reminded me of things that might have washed up on shore from a shipwreck. 

I was not a fan of ""ropes"" used for moving objects. I might have liked it better if I could have actually retracted the rope similar to a fishing line. Instead, it was ""attach"", ""pull"", ""release"". 

I also didn't like that I did not have free movement, and that I could not hold an item and ""warp"" at the same time. It made item placement more difficult than it needed to be, taking more steps to place an item. 

Use of the rope also meant ""room scale"" movement...which I have never really cared for. For a relaxing game like this... I prefer to play seated, not standing up and sitting down to place items. 

Floating blocks and ""respawning"" crates were immersion breaking to me. For a physics based game, I would have preferred puzzles that use real world physics. For example...if the puzzle requires that something can't be placed under the target...use a ""fire"" to show why a wooden object can't be placed there. Use trees or real world objects to suspend mission critical items in the air.

The thing that draws me most to VR is the ability to ""visit"" stunning environments. The environment in this game is sparse (a few sandbar islands with some trees, surrounded by ocean), but still manages to be one of the most attractive and immersive I have seen. The ocean wave effects, both the visuals and the buoyancy physics, are extremely well done. The puzzle props are realistic and fit nicely with the theme. The textures were detailed, even up close. I've taken numerous breaks from the puzzles, just to stare out at the waves. The Puzzle Island world looked beautiful on all three headsets. The clarity of the Rift S was particularly well-suited to showcasing the excellent graphics and water animation. I wouldn't mind an option to turn off the music, to enjoy the nature sounds.

[h1]Rift CV1 Experience[/h1]
There is a series of puzzles, with each increasing in difficulty. The problem-solving aspect is only one part of the challenge. The other part is skill. You are forced to pick up items using only ropes spawned from your controllers. The rope physics are believable, but the characteristics of the ropes themselves take some getting used to. They feel more ""limp"" than I would expect. It doesn't make the game any less enjoyable. Teleportation is done by pressing down on the joystick. Rotation is accomplished by pushing the joystick left or right. My only complaint about the controls is that the joystick must be held in position briefly before the turn happens. I am accustomed to being able to quickly nudge the joystick to effect a snap-turn.

[h1]Odyssey+ Experience[/h1]
The gameplay is roughly the same on the Odyssey+, but while the CV1 seems sluggish on snap-turns, the Odyssey+ has the opposite problem. It uses the trackpad and is hypersensitive. Even resting a finger near the trackpad will often cause a turn or sometimes a teleport. This certainly detracted from the game. I also notice that one of the menu prompts in the first tutorial puzzle appeared backwards (If I recall, I believe it was the prompt for turning).

[h1]Rift S Experience[/h1]
Like the Odyssey+, the Rift S had backward prompts during the tutorial session. Both the trigger (rope) prompt and the turn prompt were mirror-writing. Despite this, teleport and turning worked fine. As I noted in the beginning of my review, the visuals were amazing on the Rift S - the best of all three headsets. Unfortunately, the ropes would not spawn on my Rift S. I pointed the controller at the prop, squeezed the trigger, and saw the green sighting line, but no rope appeared. At the suggestion of the developer, I experimented with my controller bindings through the SteamVR settings. I changed the grips to behave as triggers. Now, squeezing the trigger gives me the sighting/aiming beam and squeezing the grip deploys and attaches the ropes. Unlike the momentary delay with the CV1, the attachment occurs instantaneously making it easier to catch objects in some of the levels that have them blowing in the wind.",1575224037,1575748679,True,1,0,0,4,True,False,True,False,,,

The playability and physics just take a moment to adjust to, but feel very realistic and responsive. The goal is to arrange the objects available in a particular way to touch a goal sphere. The level with the balls and barrels was the biggest hurdle for me, but otherwise was a nice gradual rise in difficulty. As it progresses, you have to learn to hold the objects still and strategically swing them into positions - or maybe others can figure out better ways to do it!

Thank you for making it, and I hope you will continue to develop it further into a full experience. Here's to you!",1515813580,1515813580,True,1,0,0,0,False,True,True,False,,,

Things it could use:

1. An option for background music. A simple and relaxing island style instrumental that just repeats would be good enough.

2. Hints! After spending 20/30min or more on a puzzle, an optional hint should be available. I definitely appreciate that the puzzles are hard but it can get frustrating to not see a solution. This can turn people away from the game for good or worse make them regret spending money on it.

3. Replayablility. A challenge for puzzle games it replay value. Once you finish it there's little reason to go back. Portal solves this with humor and a good story.

I didn't expect to play it for two hours straight but that's exactly what happened. It's set on an island which to date has the most realistic graphics I've experienced in VR. I've played 19 of 20 levels and so far it has been mostly hard puzzles. This was one of the first puzzle games I've tried on the Vive and it's now one of my favorite games. As a whole I truly recommend it!

[b]PROS[/b]
- Graphics are very realistic and to me it's the most realistic environment I have experienced in VR.
- For the most part the puzzles are hard.
- No instructions. This is actually a good thing seeing as it made it more difficult in the beginning.
- No mic in multiplayer. I've only been able to try out online multiplayer for 15 minutes or so but I liked the fact that there was no mic. Only being able to express myself with my hands actually made it more fun. Plus, he/she didn't hear when I raged about my failings!

[b]CONS[/b]
- [strike]Some puzzles seemed only possible for really tall people OR you'd need a high ceiling and a ladder![/strike] Edit: The developer answered and clarified that it is in fact possible to solve all puzzles no matter your own height or the height of your ceiling.
- Multiplayer doesn't seem to be an option, couldn't find an option to opt-out.
- Multiplayer latency wasn't great. Maybe a better matching system otherwise it gets quite laggy.

[b]Improvements[/b]
- Add more puzzles! There are just 20 levels right now. I've reached level 19 and soon I'll be done.
- Possibility to skip levels. I like the fact some levels are hard but it would be nice if it was possible to skip a level if the player has tried it for maybe 30 minutes or so.
- View solutions. It would be interesting to see other possible solutions for a level once you've completed it. Either visually in-game or just text instructions.

Total playtime: For me it took somewhere around 2 hours to get to level 19. I've not played many puzzle games before so for newbies this is great!",1484807190,1484828077,True,10,0,0.649346590042114258,1,True,False,True,False,,,

　　游戏画面制作精细，贴图也十分清晰，沙滩、椰子树、海水都栩栩如生，让玩家仿佛置身于这个美丽的小岛一般。
　　游戏的玩法是利用每关不同的道具，如木板、木箱之类的物体。玩家需要把这些道具搭建起来，从而使它们能够触及会发光的水晶球，就算成功过关。每一关的道具和水晶球的位置都有所不同，难度也有相应的增加，需要玩家们开动脑筋思考各种可能性。
　　目前《拼图岛VR》在steam上的售价为32元。游戏关卡虽然不多，但比较具有可玩性，唯一遗憾的是游戏在操作上并有任何反馈，使得游戏玩起来没什么手感。喜欢这类游戏的玩家可以尝试购买，若是游戏能够再降低50%到60%的价格会更适合购买。
