Mimic Arena is a multiplayer fighting game with a good idea, but bad execution. The central premise is that upon death, a mimic is created which does everything you did before your death. So if you jumped, shot your gun, then died, your mimic will spawn and do the exact same thing. It’s a unique mechanic with a ton of potential, but it’s largely wasted due to a couple bad decisions by the developers.

First, the game has no singleplayer modes or bots to play against, so a large portion of potential players are excluded. The lack of online multiplayer narrows down the player base even more. To make matters worse, there is no keyboard support, so you need to have 2 controllers to play. This leaves Mimic Arena as a purely local multiplayer game. For a game that is pretty rough around the edges, this is effectively a death sentence. Thankfully, you can use Steam Remote Play to play “locally” online, but this feature came long after the game was released.

As for the gameplay itself, it’s pretty decent, but also leaves me wanting more. It’s fairly repetitive, but the core gameplay isn’t strong enough to allow for it. There isn’t one glaring issue that destroys the game, it’s a series of minor issues that combine to make the game feel mediocre.

Mimic Arena has some decent visuals and the music is okay, but it doesn’t actually improve the game, it just doesn’t make it worse. In general, Mimic Arena is a game that could have been great, but was crippled by a few bad design choices. I’d recommend people give it a try if it intrigues them, but be willing to refund it, because it doesn’t get much better the more you play. The average player probably won’t love it, but it’s a passable game if you like the main mechanics and can look past its issues.

I can't begin to describe how completely baffling and incompetent the developers are.  There's no keyboard support for a PC game on Steam.  None.   The total failure from the developers to understand their target audience is only marginally higher than hiring a BBQ pitmaster for a vegan conference.   For the game to work you have to plug in not one, but two childrens console peasant gamepad toys.  Unbelievable.  I got this in a bundle and I sure wish I could remember which one so I never, ever buy from them again, because this is pure garbage.   The only saving grace here is the developers seriously think this is worth $8 USD.

As a father of 2 constantly keeping an eye out for Couch Co-op games that I can play with my kids, it's pretty rare to find a quality game like this. 

Seriously, this game was a fresh experience that came completely unexpected. I believe I got this game gifted from my father in law as he didn't feel it was his cup of tea; but my family LOVES this game. 

It's like playing digital tag so to speak, with the added challenge of doubling the amount of players and threats in game via ""mimic"" that copies your every move until death and then replays it in physical form. 

I don't have a ton of time into this game right now, mostly because I work full time, the kid's got school ect. 

My advise to developers; work on developing bots. I would hands down play the crud out of this game during lunch breaks or to kill time here and there. This game's ONLY disadvantage in my honest opinion is the fact you must have local players to play with; otherwise it's a dead horse. 

This game has SO much potential. Heck you could make bigger levels! Implement challenges! Man, I could wig out on how awesome this game is and how much potential it has. Heck even if you added online play, that could make up for a lot of this games loss. 

If you don't have people to play with locally, you're pretty much boned. 

this game is 4/5 stars, and ONLY because the experience is so much fun when I can actually play it with family/friends.",1547167771,1547167771,True,1,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,
