[h1]Intro[/h1]
[b]The Legend Of Tango[/b] is a short game that tells about how [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/276730/Tango_Fiesta/]Tango Fiesta[/url][/b] was born in a medieval setting with some advertisements in it.

[b]Pros:[/b]
Not sure what to say here.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Some parts of the story don't translate well into the medieval setting

[b]Specs[/b]
Intel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650

[h1]Should you play this game?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b]
[i]Why are you playing a free game that is clearly an advertisement for another game?[/i]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
The game uses default [i]RPG Maker[/i] assets without additional tweaks. There aren't many areas in the game, but the available ones are done well. There aren't many items that can be interacted with in the first place, though.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story is bland. The game gives a warning that it tells the story of how [b]Tango Fiesta[/b] was born, but it feels too general that anyone who has experience in participating in game jam will know roughly how it is. The rest is just an advertisement for [b]Tango Fiesta[/b] with some embellishments in fantasy and medieval settings. Despite being made in a medieval setting, some part of the story doesn't translate well; you can roughly tell what happened in real life, but it wasn't good game-wise since it ruined the immersion.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game is straightforward - you'll know what it wants without it telling anything. Someone appears at your doorstep? Talk to him. People ask you to kill monsters? Kill them. There aren't many interactable objects in the game and the optional ones are mostly used as the developer's space to express their thoughts. It feels more like a diary than anything.

The battle is straightforward too. You can basically win everything just by spamming the attack button. Since enemies and your party use game jam-related terms, it can be hard to figure out what you and the enemy can do. However, with the game being short as it is, there is no need to spend additional time learning them.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
My last in-game save clocked in at 18:41:00. The game is easy to beat since it's focused more on the story - you just can spam normal attacks for all fights. Consumables might be limited but you won't need a lot of them in the first place. I myself don't use it at all and can manage to beat the game just fine.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]The Legend Of Tango[/b] feels more like an advertisement than a game. The story was bland and it wasn't immersive enough to tell about how [b]Tango Fiesta[/b] came to be. You might be thinking about what goes through the design process, the obstacles in making the game, and other similar things when it said that it told about how a game was born, but you will find nothing here. The most it'll do is to express it in the form of monsters with the name of the problem that you have to beat in turn-based JRPG style. Heck, the only obstacle that was addressed in dialogue form was some guy touching one of the team members. 

At the end of the game, it feels too generic to be said as a game that tells the origin of what [b]Tango Fiesta[/b] came to be, and both the fantasy and medieval settings just make it more generic than needed. It ends up as an advertisement instead, with it telling you to check out the game at the beginning and the end of your playthrough.",1682698670,1682698670,False,16,0,0.706510186195373535,0,False,True,False,True,,,

1) Сюжет: в игре нам в антураже классической jRPG, рассказывается история о том как собрались четверо [strike]неудачников[/strike] разработчиков поучавствовать в джеме по разработке игры за 8 часов, на тему 80-х годов. Ну и естественно [spoiler]проиграли[/spoiler]. Все это подано с юмором, временами специфическим, но с отдельными смешными моментами. В частности в этой игре с багами надо биться буквально, тяжкая однако доля у разрабов.

2) Геймплей: вся игра это 2 локации: дом где можно побродить и почитать беллетристику, и арена - где надо замордовать n-е количество врагов. Все вражины забиваются простой атакой, урона они особо нам не наносят, навыков у героев нет, после нескольких боев они появится, но надобности в них все равно нет. У вражин можно выбить зелья, которые использовать тоже незачем, ибо читайте про урон выше. Плюс есть баги, через некоторые закрытые двери и предметы можно пройти. Баги правда не такие страшные как в недавно пройденном мной Raywin. А еще был такой баг, после выхода из игры, она отображалась будто бы еще включена, причем процесс как-то хитро заныкан ибо в диспетчере не отражается. пришлось вырубать через диспетчер стим. Продолжительность игры минут 20 не более.

3) Графика и звуки: в игре довольно приятная задорная мелодия, и симпатичния графика (ибо взяты стандартные текстуры для RPG Maker), при этом очень маленький экран, а настроек графики нет.

Как итог: очень короткая промо игра, с отдельными забавными шутками. Пройти можно, а можно смело пройти мимо, ибо ничего не потеряете.
