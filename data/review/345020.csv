It teaches you about upgrading your gear, and there's a nice balance of figuring things out for yourself in a quest, and also being guided through the objective.

Criticisms include jerky animation, a dodge/roll move that you'll miss if you blink (although repeatedly rolling does give you a speed boost!). Way too many of those tusk-beasts around, and while the squeak of a rat may work in a dungeon... spying those tusks in miniature form breaks the illusion.

Par ailleurs, la faible évolutivité du personnage qui consiste quasi exclusivement en une augmentation des points de vie et une amélioration de l'équipement fait plutôt de ce jeu, un jeu d'action plus qu'un RPG, de mon point de vue.

However I'm immediately having issues that need resolving. 

First (and I've a screenshot of this), in character creation there was a giant black box coving my character so I couldn't see them- I had to pick options by going in and out of the character creation menu- which thankfully allowed me to see at least a tiny bit of what i was doing. At the end of character creation, the button weirdly duplicated to make about 10 of the same character to select from. 

Second, the portrait of my character in the upper left near my stats looks nothing like my character. 

Third, and most importantly, upon clicking to enter the guild hall, I was stuck on a loading screen for 10 minutes- so I force quit the game. This is why my play time is so low. 

Bonus problem- the health potion in my inventory had a visual glitch. 

I'm definitely going to try again, I know this is in early access still and I like what little I've seen and heard of the visual style and music. I will certainly update this review if it turns out the problems were some strange anomaly, but I can't currently recommend this, at least not on a Mac (I note other people are playing fine and I haven't seen posts about the character creation issue).

It's really much more entertaining than that. It's a lot more worthwhile than that.

I won't say *too* much, but noting that your character snarkily writes notes into the journal as you do quests was cute. The dialogue is nice, where seen, and there's a lot of time and effort notable in a variety of areas; I found myself wandering around aimlessly simply because I could, and because I might find something somewhere to interest me. Finding NPCs or hidden chests or sidequests, or heck, just random mini-bosses, was always a nice little touch.

You can make it easier on yourself if you grind, but it isn't necessary; the items you get from chests don't hinder your movement speed nor did I find them lacking in providing moderate defense, and none of it's exactly necessary if you learn to time your little dodge rolls. (Sidenote; fun to roll around. I genuinely find how fast the character just Sonics into a roll and then up back into its slightly clunky normal state to be rather amusing. 10/10, spent the entirety of dungeon-delving rolling and I hold no regrets.) Still, the extra grind and investment, as mobs respawn when you re-enter a zone, is worthwhile and there are items that definitely make it easier. (Though, I *do* recommend holding off on grinding until you discover the bandits and onward, as they are actually semi-worth farming if you've been having a tough time.)

I've yet to try the spears, but the swords and mace I picked up were interesting and their power attacks were pretty neato. Light attacks are superior, of course, but the heavies are unique and are great for clearing mobs that can't penetrate your armor. Speed factors in, too, though not insanely as from what I can tell, though I do prefer the quicker weapons for the better swing-and-dodge strat.

All in all, I dunno' what else to say; I have had this in my library for a while, went and played it today whilst in a kind of poor mood, and found a game I intend to invest far more time in exploring and working at as, at the time of writing this, three dedicated hours has not gotten me to the whole of the game nor all of the weapons yet. For something I discovered was 5$ still, I can't say that that's a bad price at all.

If anything, it's generous.

The only complaint?
I hate the projectile mobs. Looking at you, catacomb wizard man... thing... Whatever.

However, as a fervent history nutcase, one thing drives me crazy.
The weapons.
They give real historical names to all the weapons, and then have the models have..... nothing close to the weapon theyre using the name of. its deeply odd. A falchion is a single-handed knightly sword like youd normally picture, but with a single edged broader blade for cutting unarmored targets better, in this its some weird large curved sword.
A Kris is a breathtakingly beautiful wavy sword from the philipines that i constantly question why is left out from fantasy because it looks like the epitome of all things elven, and this game has a sword called the 'kris'. The kris in the game, however, if a flamberge *greatsword*..... scaled down to the size of a knife in your hand. Which looks.... a little bit hilarious.
Longsword just means 'two handed sword.' The longsword in this game definitely isnt that and its description is 'maybe a little bit too long' if that gives you any indication.
A b*stard sword is literally a shortened longsword designed to be usable in one or two hands depending on the situation - all non-greatswords in dark souls, for example, are actually bastard swords because of how theyre all designed to switch from one to two hands. The description of a b*stard is ""Only the finest barbarians can wield this monstrous weapon""

Its just... odd. It confuses me on a deep, and spiritual level (im joking, if you cant tell.) Why go through the effort of finding so many real historical weapons and nomenclatures if you're then going to seemingly go out of your way to make them as wrong as possible?
Is this just a jab at history nuts like me to drive us insane?
Maybe, hell if it were i'd buy the devs a cookie cause thats clever as f*ck.

Rather just check the video instead of read? Me too:
https://youtu.be/o27cvILIlHo

I started a new short segment called ""Lost on Steam"" which features games that have few reviews for one reason or another. Definitely not necessarily negative, just games that slipped by people.

This is one of the featured games this week! 

A Feeble Saga is game that could be much more than it is. It suffers from a really bland selection of monsters and a rather confusing map / exploration system. Combat is EXTREMELY basic having not much more than a slice to attack monsters, no matter the weapon you're using.

Exploration feels tedious and the areas to explore aren't anything noteworthy. Honestly the project feels a little too ambitious for the people that made it. If combat were more involved I could rate it higher and look past the issues, but it's not.

tl;dr - Combat is too simple. Game is too tedious. Needs a lot of work before a worthy release happens.

You can now buy armor, you can block with your shield and fighting has overall improved.
The area of the game has grown. There are new quests.
Updates come slow, but the dev is honest about it, and honest about doing the things he promises. I still enjoy myself when  I come back to see how it fares.Still recommended.



The game is oldfashioned simple hack and slash. There isn't yet a lot of content, but what there is worked flawlessly on my rig. 
The fighting is very simple and you can't block with your shield, but the dev has promised that will be implemented.
The sword you have from the beginning is..yes..feeble! You can hardly manage the smallest critters, but you can attack bushes, and there is a lot of bushes, and they will drop money and hearts, which are a tiny bit of healing. Soon you can buy a better sword, and you can kill more critters and reach some small caves where you can smash barrels that have money and hearts. After a while you can get an even better sword and perhaps a shield, and then you are good to go adventuring. You can't buy armor yet. But if you explore you might find chests that has some armor.
You don't get xp, finding chests that holds bigger hearts that will improve you health, is, at least so far, the only way to get stronger.
I find the game charming and entertaining, and for that very cheap price, it is definately a recommended from me.",1554541678,1581314323,True,3,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True,False,,,

However, it's obviously a new game and could use some tweaking. I saw that the developer replied to a comment regarding the difficulty with keeping track of your location, so I'm awaiting the update that'll add a map to the game. There's another issue relating to location: when you die, you start from REALLY far behind where you ended at. I got to a cemetery deep in the woods and started back at the gate between the town and the woods after dying. Perhaps the developer could add some slightly more frequent checkpoints so we're not always starting back at square one? I think this game would benefit from the addition of some more elements from any of the FATE games. For instance, I immediately noticed that this game has no female avatars available. In FATE, you get to choose a male or female character, customize it, and select a pet dog or cat as a companion and fighting partner. There's also a lack of items available to buy from shops and traveling salesmen. I'd like to see some variety (and maybe some magical items, if that's possible). Last thing - when you use a portal to go back to town and you come back, the monsters and bandits you already killed are back somehow. It'd be nice if they'd just stay dead. It seems like a waste of time killing what was already dead a second time. Even though this game could use some work, I recommend that other fans of RPGs, Dungeon Crawlers, and Adventure/Quest games give it a try. I'm enjoying it despite its flaws.

The game starts off exactly as it's described, a village in need of a hero to take care of some of the dirty work. The quests and story take off from there, keeping you wondering what's next. Taking a step back and considering organization while questing comes in handy, but isn't a necessity. Exploring the area and the village is defnitely a plus to get the most out of the story lines of the villagers.

Summary:
Feeble Saga is a short and simple adventure experience that will appeal to old school gamers who are tired of some of the fluff and hand holding that comes with modern games. That being said it is also approachable to slightly more ""new school"" gamers like myself.

Feeble saga is a short and simple adventure game. Although at first look you may want to compare it to loot fest dungeon crawlers like Diablo or Titan Quest it is much more comparable to something like the 2D Zelda games and has a lot of old school vibe to its design. There is no leveling system and monster drops are primary currency and hearts. As long as you know what to expect and that is your thing this game is a fun little adventure! 

Obtaining new weapons and shields in the shop gives you a very noticeable feeling of progression when battling monsters. Combat is simple but manages to be challenging and interesting. It's variety comes from the variety in attack speed of both your weapons and enemies. In order to succeed later in the game you will really need to memorize the ""attack patterns"" of your enemies to avoid taking damage.

Feeble Saga does away with some of the hand holding that often comes with modern RPGs. There is no quest tracker or compass so you will actually have to pay attention to the instructions of the quest givers in order to complete your tasks. To many this will be a much appreciated feature. I generally don't mind hand holding but even I (a gamer with a horrible sense of direction) was able to complete all the quests without too much difficulty and found that I enjoyed having to slow down and actually pay attention, rather than just mindlessly follow arrows and hitting stuff.

At the time of this review I was able to play through the game in about 3 hours including all side quests. I can be a bit of a baddie at times so you could probably get through it quicker but I think this will be fairly normal for most. Personally I'm at a stage in my life where I don't have time for 60 hour  mondo campaigns so although I look forward to a few more side quests I think a shorter run-time is actually a strength and I felt like I had time to slow down and talk to all the villagers and take in as much of the game world as possible.",1551276004,1551978513,True,12,1,0.596158981323242188,1,True,False,True,False,,,

I'd love to see the developer add a use for the right mouse button in the form of a quick side jump or roll to dodge or heck just make it use an equipped shield to block attacks.
