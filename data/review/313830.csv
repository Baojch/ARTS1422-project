My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707194210,1707194210,True,1,1,0.515706777572631836,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Game's code is utter shit. 

It unlocks achievements for doing something completely different and It doesn't unlock achievements when you actually do the thing 
It unlocks ""without shouting"" achievements even though I shouted
It unlocked finish without dying even tho I died lots of times
Sometimes when I restarted... there were new enemies and traps in my levels... then i figured it out... If you spam restart level sometimes the game restarts to the ""plus"" version. you have to restart A LOT of times... the game's FPS also drops each time you Restart level
For level three, it didn't unlock any achievement until I did the restart spam on the last level. Then it unlocked plus and normal at the same time along with the others... 

I think the game simply doesn't clear the variables for the flags it checks for achievements as long as you keep the game session running and simply complete the levels... they count as no deaths/items on the floor. 

The coder was smoking crack and talking to his imaginary friends in the QC team.

To bring the change to the world the Seer has to come out of the depths and climb up the mountain. There he can let his voice to be heard.

I would describe the game as a Sokoban with sound control system and bit of a stealth. There are four chapters, each has a different setting and introduces new enemies and gameplay elements. As your enemies can't see you, you have to lure them out of your way with your voice. But as they lost their sight their hearing became much more sharp. And they are also better runners than you. You also have to stay clear of spikes and firing guns. There is no penalty for getting caught or dying, if you don't aim for the related achievement of course.

The visuals are… strange, but rather suits the game. I liked the music. Voice acting is good, pretty emotional. Difficulty of the levels is constantly rising, although even some of the later ones were easier. Few of them were on the other hand pretty tedious and a pain in the back. The hardest for me would be the 3rd chapter. After completing the game you can play New Game+ in which you revisit the same locations with enemies from higher chapters, with new layout or completely different levels (just few). Here begins the double challenge.

It is one of the first games I had ever bought here on Steam, while this is a very good game, there are also some drawbacks.

I really like the mechanics of the main character being blind and how you need to be very careful about the steps you take around the enemies or else you get caught.  I also really enjoy how each of the interactable characters, like the enemies and the people that stand on the buttons, all are blind and use their different senses to try and find the main character.  This is the first game I have played that has that.

The puzzles are also very interesting, and I enjoyed playing through them.  There were some puzzles that were very monotonous and were difficult to get through because of the miniscule details you had to input in order to solve a level.  However, I thought they were interesting.

While the game itself was very good, and very puzzle oriented, I honestly had been struggling to finish this game because there really wasn't anything driving me forwards, no story I could really see.  The puzzles also started getting mildly frustrating as a result because they would get more difficult, but I never knew what I was doing, outside of escaping some sort of prison.  

That being said, the very last level before the credits was absolutely incredible.  While it was just a walking scene with the enemies chasing after you, the poetry being spoken in the background really changed my perspective on the game I was playing, and made me realize how I was viewing life.  I've even gone through and just held the right arrow key to move and closed my eyes so I could focus and listen to the words more (and I've done this several times as of now).  

I do recommend playing this game, if you do enjoy puzzles, though especially for that final level.  I would give this a 7/10 for sure (that last level really bumped up the score because of how good and worth it the gameplay became).",1609749299,1609749299,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First, let me say that I was completely mistaken about it being zelda-ish...

Pros:
- Art style is pretty good
- Not gonna break the bank
- works great on linux

Cons:
- focus is 100% on solving puzzles. if you are looking for a brain-teaser, that might be a good thing. if you saw the ""Adventure"" tag and are looking for a zelda/metroidvania type game that involves wandering around, fighting, and some puzzle-solving then be warned that this is not that kind of game at all.
- Some of the puzzles are fairly challenging but personally I found them more annoying than endearing. This could be partially due to lack of sleep...
- Alt+Tab seemed to kick the game out of fullscreen mode. As did switching workspaces. (I play on Linux so this could be a steamplay/proton-only issue).

[h1] 가성비는 좋은 퍼즐게임. 아쉬운 점은 렉과 빠르기. [/h1]

일단 1100원에 이 정도로 컨텐츠가 꽤 많고, 그래픽도 나빠 보이지 않는 게임은 흔치않아 기대를 했습니다만.

제 컴퓨터에서는 렉이 걸렸고, 분위기가 개인적으로는 안 좋아하는 분위기라 아쉬웠습니다.

또한 걷는 속도가 느려서 박진감이 없었고.

퍼즐 깨는 재미가 예상보다 없었습니다.

그냥 가성비 하나보고 추천은 드립니다만.. 뭔가 모르게 아쉬운 게임입니다.",1601712659,1601712659,True,4,0,0.576719582080841064,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I don't like giving bad reviews to small teams but this game had flaws that made it a chore to play. 

From a gameplay perspective, your character is too slow, field of view is too small, and many of the puzzles were tedious rather than engaging. The character moves at a snail's pace at all times and is even slower when moving boxes around, there were a few levels that were enormous but simple and I felt bored as I trudged along, the character should move at least doubly fast. Some of the puzzle rooms are larger than others, and while your field of view does zoom out, it's not quite enough. I should be able to see all of the evil I'm trying to overcome. Perhaps this is intentional, but if it's meant as a mechanic, the game never expands on it. There were at least three puzzles that were relatively easy, but either required too much of the aforementioned trudging or put you into a soft lock at points forcing you to reset the level and slog your way back through.

Besides the gameplay issues, there were also a number of performance problems I ran into. My computer is by no means high end, but on some levels the game noticeably slowed, and it's not as if this game is boasting great graphics. I also had trouble with the sound redirecting horns. It was often difficult to immediately discern which way they were pointing without more boring trial and error.

The story was nothing to write home about. Simple narrative about a society that has closed it's eyes to progress by literally closing their eyes. It's a bit on the nose, and has a very ""wake up sheeple"" message to it.

The game isn't hard nor long. I only actively played it for about three hours. That said, it looks like only just over 5% of players have beaten the game. I can only assume this is because they gave up.

А теперь представьте себе цепочку из орущих дедов, каждый из которых переключает глыбы на уровне после своего крика (у чего тоже характерный, режущий и одинаковый звук), а обрамляет это шум из 3х пулеметов, каждый из которых стреляет раз в 3 секунды по 3 пули за залп.

Я не почувствовал от этой игры ни капли удовольствия, лишь усталось и раздражение. Прошёл я большую часть игры (4 акт, 6 уровень из 5ти актов) и дропнул её, что делаю крайне редко... Возможно, если выкатят патч-другой... Да кому я сказки рассказываю?!

Karakterimiz kendi ruhu ile ilgili bir arayışa çıkar ve uğradığı bir beldede rüyasında ""uzayı dinle"" , ""paralelde olan olayları hisset"" gibi enteresan cümleler duyar. Sonra kendini bir boşlukta bulur ve her tarafta onu izleyen gözleri görür. En nihayetinde karakterimiz çok farklı bir aleme geçiş yapar. Oyunda bu noktadan sonra başlıyor. Hikayenin eksik noktalarını her bölüm geçtiğinizde kelime kelime anlatmaya devam ediyor. 

Oyunda amacımız bulunduğumuz katın sonundaki merdivene ulaşıp bir üst kata çıkabilmek. Fakat bu a ile b noktası arasında her bölümün kendine özel ve geçtikçe zorlaşan bir bulmaca yapısı var. Bulmacalar ekseriyetle belirli renkteki taşları açık kapayan tuşlar, sürükleyebildiğimiz kutular ve ses iletimini sağlayan borazan benzeri ünitelerden oluşuyor. Bunun dışında da sese duyarlı şeytanlarda bazı bölümlerde labirentlerin içerisinde dolaşıyor. Hiçbir şekilde savunmamız olmadığı için onlara yakalanmamamız gerekiyor. Buda bulmacayı çözmenin yanında el çabukluğu gereksiniminide getiriyor. 

Oyunda 40 civarı bölüm mevcut. Oyunu bitirdiğinizde aynı bölümleri biraz daha zorlaştırılmış olarak tekrar oynama seçeneğide açılıyor. Açıkcası ben bulmacaları beğendim. Mantık ve zeka kullanımını zorlayan ve aşırı çözülemez seviyede değiller. Çabuk sıkılıp oyuna negatif puan verenleride anlıyorum. ilk 4-5 bölüm tamamen oyunu ve hikayeyi anlamaya odaklı olduğundan sıkabilir. Bende bu bölümlerde sıkıldım fakat devam ettiğinizde ciddi anlamda ilginizi çekmeye başlıyor. Zaten maksimum 2-3 saatte bitirilebilecek bir oyun. Arka planda çalan müzik de oyunun havasıyla gayet uyumlu. 

Bunun dışında oyundaki makineli tüfekli bölümleri saçma buldum. Antik bir dönemde geçen mistik bir hikayede makineli tüfek olması çok mantıksız geldi. Kafa dağıtmak ve biraz mantık yürütmek istediğinizde keyifli vakit geçirebileceğiniz bir oyun. 10/7",1538652567,1538652567,True,2,0,0.542168676853179932,0,False,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: Forget the blind sound oriented thematic. This is sokoban... with a bit of kiting and tactical movement. Unity engine and looking kind of plain and poorly designed.

See no evil is set up like a series of small instance sized maps in which you must navigate from point A to point B. Relying on leverpulling, using a shout ability to attract attention and aggro and the use of crates and whatnot either pulled, or pushed or set on top of triggers.

Unfortunately the character animation for movement is very slow in comparison to that of the NPCS and the game can get tedious as you retry over and over to defeat small sections with the inept tools and the odd AI you are faced against.

Conclusion: While it may, or may not, be a servicable experience, I did not get hooked on and the general lack of good design in the puzzles made me uninterested in really investing myself further. Would rather remove for declutter.

There's not much to like about it despite its eerie atmosphere, good voice actor and the slightest hint of a passable puzzle mechanic. It's far from polished and unfortunately not interesting enough to warrant a try.

The graphics are alright. The world and characters are presented in a generic but coherent comic art style. Only the muddy colour schemes make the game somewhat unpleasant, if unobtrusive, to look at. The sounds on the other hand are similarly unremarkable but feature a form of reverberation that, together with the voice acting, creates a thick, oneiric atmosphere. Its weird presentation mirrors the obscure story. Perhaps it has merit, but it's just not compelling enough to really get into it.

The main problem is its gameplay. The controls are unresponsive and imprecise, the puzzles fiddly and the edges of objects unclean. And that's just to name the most notable issues. Clipping or blocking are part of the regular glitches that interfere with the gameplay. They're seemingly minor but nonetheless capable of failing a level especially in timing dependent passages.

See No Evil has some unique traits but isn't worth it.

There are also some technical problems, namely a not functioning fullscreen mode and buggy achievements.

Название, как я понимаю, отсылает нас к 三猿 и принципу «see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil». Идея игры занятна. Большинство пытается спрятать взгляд от демонов этого мира, но наш герой не такой, особенный, ага. Из этого можно было довольно интересные механики разработать. Но что мы получили?

1. Наипаршивейшая физика. Хитбоксы слишком отличаются от моделек. Вы часто будете застревать там, где, казалось бы, не за что зацепиться. Из-за этого вы очень часто будете перезагружать уровень, так застревать будете в самый неподходящий момент.
2. Неуместная музыка. В играх такого жанра музыка должна быть практически незаметной, хорошо сочетаться с игрой. Здесь же музыка раздражает с первых же минут.
3. При сворачивании игры сбрасывается Full Screen mode.
4. В игре не сделать скриншоты. И, судя по всему, разработчик зачем-то сделал это намеренно. 
5. Игра жрёт больше 500 мегабайт оперативки ლ(ಠ_ಠ ლ)
6. Что вдвойне странно, на i7 игра порой скатывается до 15 fps.
7. Слишком репетативная, при этом, по ходу прохождения не привносятся новые механики. Вместо добавления чего-то нового разработчики просто увеличивают количество действий, необходимое для прохождения уровня.
8. Сложность уровней не консистентна. То вам суют лёгкие уровни, то сложные.
9. Судя по блогу разработчика, он забил на эту игру сразу же после выхода. Сложно представить, что этот же человек принимал участие в разработке Dungeon Defenders 2.

This type of game has the disadvantage of being unable to keep the player engaged by maintaining a good pace, since said pace is totally dependent on the player. Furthermore, in order to keep a person playing, a puzzle game needs one of two things (though preferably both): a good story/goal to motivate me to solve the puzzles or a sense of satisfaction from doing so. See No Evil lacks both. Up until the last two levels I played, it was mind bogglingly easy. The last two were plain frustrating. None made me feel that essential ""eureka!"" moment. There is simply no reward for being clever. Does it need to give me three star rating like some crappy phone game? No. An A+, million point score because I did my best? Of course not. But _something_ every once in a while would be nice. Maybe tell me why my character decided to see again or give some exposition as to what the hell is going on in this society. You know, something other than some vague narration (which is activaley discouraging me from progressing).

(Voice acting on the narration is nice, though. Gotta admit.)

The motivation you're supposed to have is you're trying to get to a mountain to scream in a horn and ""wake up"" all the people who decided to cover their eyes and live in blindness, which is apparently all of society. The problem here is twofold: first, while I might have been a little keen on saving the world at the start, that quickly changes when you discover that everyone wants to kill you. Second.... what? I spend the entire game sneaking around and trying not let enemies hear me so I don't get killed, just so I can then scream at them from a mountain? Maybe it's explained in the end, but I honestly couldn't force myself to care. I didn't play through the entire game because I wanted to make sure I could get my refund back, though I was halfway through chapter 3 out of 4 and I don't see it picking up that late into the game. Apparently there's a new game plus where there's more/tougher enemies, but if I could get through chapters 1, 2, and almost 3 in little over an hour, I can't see it taking much more than 4 hours to beat both ng and ng+.

The mechanics are interesting, but could use a little work. For example, there is an enemy that fears sound and moves away from it. This is implemented as a sound activated switch that consists of the enemy standing on a button and you having to scare it off in order to lower a barrier and progress. The enemy moves back onto the button after a couple seconds. I discovered, however, that walking so the enemy is no longer on screen freezes it so it won't step back on the button. Not knowing that you can actually keep it off the button makes two specific levels in chapter two unsolvable. I have looked online for solutions to those levels and they all use the same technique of freezing the enemy by leaving the screen.

There's ways for sound to travel diagonally by redirecting it through a sort of two sided megaphone, but you can't scream (i.e. make sound) diagonally. In order to use the megaphones that are diagonal you need to stand at a specific distance so that the expanding sound waves from your voice actually go through the funnel at a good enough angle to be registered. 

The camera is glued to the player and you can't use it to look around, so often you have to (very slowly) walk over to what you want to see, look at it for a second, then (oh so slowly) walk back. I understand and agree with the choice of making the character's speed what it is as some puzzles would be completely broken if he walked much faster. Nevetheless, it would make the game much more enjoyable if you could just drag your mouse over to the edge of the screen to look a little farther, or control the camera a little with wasd if you're moving with the arrow keys. Something like that would remove a lot of unnecessary (and very slow) walking.

TL;DR: good idea, good narration. The mechanics need a little work. No motivation to play or keep playing whatsoever. It's not a terrible game, just not fun.",1498590073,1498590073,False,10,0,0.592069804668426514,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Not enough content to keep the player amazed
- Some levels are confusing in a bad way, too many workarounds for a puzzle game
- Too many reflex moves for a puzzler, its a chore

See No Evil è un puzzle game sviluppato attraverso Kickstarter in una campagna apposita (sono stati raccolti oltre 2400$). Si tratta di un gioco sviluppato da una manciata di persone per cui nella recensione terrò conto del budget e del personale limitato.

Caratteristica peculiare del gioco è che gli enigmi, pur presentando le meccaniche solite del tipo spingi la scatola, premi il bottone e simili, è stato aggiunto un elemento che non è affatto comune. Il suono. Infatti i nostri passi faranno rumore, potremo urlare per attirare l'attenzione dei nemici o spaventare i vecchietti fermi sui pulsanti, o ancora sfruttare dei corni per estendere la portata delle nostre urla e altro ancora.

Il gioco è ambientato in un mondo dove le persone scelgono di chiudere gli occhi perché il mondo visto con gli occhi aperti è più buio di chi tiene gli occhi chiusi. Noi controlleremo uno che ha scelto invece di aprire gli occhi e vedere così la vera oscurità del mondo. Peccato che, invece, quelli che hanno deciso di tenere gli occhi chiusi non siano tanto d'accordo con la nostra scelta. Così, dovremo prestare attenzione a queste persone che pur non vedendoci, sentiranno e avranno un olfatto finissimo, aggiungendo un tocco stealth al gioco.

Per essere un puzzle-game, See No Evil presenta una trama abbastanza interessante che viene dipanata a poco a poco nel corso dei livelli attraverso la lettura di un diario rinvenuto agli inizi e di una voce narrante femminile. 

Purtroppo il gioco soffre di alcuni difetti quali in primis i controlli che sono risultati legnosi e imprecisi. Il nostro personaggio si sposterà lentamente, oppure girare il corno nell'angolo desiderato sarà spesso frustrante. Tali difetti diventano sempre più pesanti man mano che i livelli diventeranno via via più complessi e sarà richiesto un maggiore tempismo. 

Tuttavia, per un gioco che ho personalmente pagato 19 centesimi non mi aspettavo molto, anche in virtù del fatto che il gioco è stato programmato da uno staff molto ridotto e con un budget limitato.

С самим жанром головоломок познакомился глубоко впервые . Раньше только проходились пара - другая загадок во флэшевых играх , после чего реципиент забрасывался . А это творение с удовольствием прошёл до конца . 

И вот . Геймплей состоит из перетаскивания ящиков , нажимания на платформы , гудение в громкоговорители , манипулирование игровыми персонажами и разумеется криков . Завязано всё не только на работу головы , но и на определённую скорость реакции . В основном все головоломки лёгкие , только несколько последних могут заставить задуматься , но при определённом напоре и их можно с лёгкостью решить . 

Отдельное слово хочу сказать о сюжете . Хоть , к сожалению , речь англоязычная и не переведена субтитрами , но тем не менее  можно вполне составить себе общее представление о том что происходит обладая небольшим знанием английского . А вот для точного воспроизведения всех деталей среднего английского недостаточно . Если описать завязку с небольшими спойлерами , то - герой - Провидец , зрячий в мире добровольно закрывших глаза людей . Закрыли они их ,  чтобы не видеть всего зла , которое создаёт их развитая технологически цивилизация . Герой идёт по пути некогда шедшей до него группы и читает дневник , который вела одна из участниц . Отдельно хочется отметить - ПРОСТО БЛЕСТЯЩУЮ КОНЦОВКУ , которую хочется просто вознаградить отдельно . Заканчивается причём сие блестящее произведение известной цитатой из Сократа . 

И , по прохождении основной игры , открывается Новая Игра +  с новыми головоломками . Проходить её Я , наверное , не буду , но стоит отметить старания и качество контента разработчиков . В общем отличная игра . Также купил Я её за 2 рубля и честно говоря просто чтобы посмотреть и удалить . Такого качественного контента не ожидал . И игра стоит гораздо дороже чем 2 рубля .

Going in, I really wanted to enjoy this game. The synopsis was fascinating, and the reviews were mostly positive. I somehow had it figured for the next [i]Bastion[/i]. But after playing it, I can only picture [i]See No Evil[/i] working as more of a free internet flash game than something I would pay actual money for. [i]See No Evil[/i] is a puzzle game primarily, not the story-rich fable I had gone in expecting. A series of vague, proverbial journal entries from a book you find next to a dead man offer supposed clues to the puzzles you face in each room, and a female narrator occasionaly remarks on your journey as you progress from room to room. As far as I can tell, that is about the extent of [i]See No Evil[/i]. The gameplay is unbalanced and frustrating. The music and sound design choices are strange, questionable and, at times, uninspired. For example, your character uses sound to navigate and activate parts of the puzzles. While this is an interesting concept, his scream (""Loh!"") gets old quite quickly. Simply adding a few variations of his scream could have alleviated this. An example of unbalanced gameplay is that your avatar moves much slower than your enemies, making them nigh on impossible to avoid when they detect you, and as soon as they do catch you, you must start the puzzle all over, regardless of the progress you may have made. The only checkpoints are at the start of the level. The puzzles, might I add, can become very tedious, and the prospect of starting one over after making a considerable dent in one does not appeal to me very much.

Despite all this, I did enjoy the visual aesthetic of [i]See no Evil[/i]--the style minded me of [i]Bastion[/i]--and it did seem like there was an interesting story hidden in there somewhere. However, from a very early point this game failed to catch my attention or stroke my curiosity enough to overcome these shortcomings. All it has done thus far is frustrate, confuse, and dissapoint me, and for these reasons I cannot in good conscience recommend [i]See No Evil[/i]. I shall continue to play, perhaps with the assistance of a walkthrough, but at this point I doubt my oppinion will change.

See No Evil é um jogo do estilo puzzle singleplayer que junta uma atmosfera de terror com estratégia. Início do gameplay é normal que o jogador não se sinta muito a par da história do jogo, mas isso é normal, pois toda ela é explicada uns níveis mais á frente. Para prosseguir, o jogador tem que ultrapassar vários níveis, e cada nível contêm vários obstáculos (como por exemplo: sentinelas, espigões, metrelhadores), e tem que resolver diferentes puzzels que incluem placas de pressão, caixas móveis, muros, efeitos sonoros, e muito mais. A soundtrack, que por sinal é bastante decente, adiciona um clima de desespero e suspence, o que dificunta muito mais a linha de raciocínio do player.

↓ [b]Pontos fortes[/b] ↓
Bons gráficos / Gameplay cativante / Boa soundtrack

↓ [b]Pontos fracos[/b] ↓
Velocidade do personagem / Preço base do jogo / Final

● [b]Conclusão[/b] → Com base nas minhas horas de jogo, pude concluir que ""See no Evil"" é um jogo bastante desafiante e que nos leva a pensar com detalhe em todos os movimentos, tem como base uma história que leva o jogador para a pele do personagem (o que é raro de acontecer em RPGs). Aconselho este produto a todos aqueles que quiserem testar a sua inteligência (mesmo sobre pressão) e que gostem de se envolver numa aventura.

● [b]Importante[/b] → Procura comprar este jogo apenas quando estiver em promoção, pois o seu valor desce para os 0.20 euros.

● [b]Nota Extra[/b] → Alguns puzzels podem ser difíceis demais para passar sem ajuda externa, para contornar o problema basta acessar a esta playlist criada pela comunidade: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D5MJdQmZ08&list=PLDgTT7CsfMMMoJhpPBhoDnsingQhMELgt]Playlist See No Evil[/url].

See No Evil is a ridiculously engaging, unconventional sound-based puzzler developed by a small team at Noetic Games that blends original and challenging gameplay with a thought-provoking premise. It just dropped on Steam for $15 after a successful Kickstarter campaign earlier this year, and sports a surprising amount of polish.
Players are abruptly dropped into a discomforting alternate reality where humanity has sworn off sight and progress in favor of comfort and consistency. Voluntarily shutting their eyes, ostensibly for generations, the protagonist opens his when a body crashes through the roof. Belonging to another Seer, as the dissidents are known, the late individual’s journal is read, line by line, as players advance through the initial set of levels. He must use his newly-acquired sight to escape the dystopian realm.

See No Evil is a dark, isometric puzzle game about sound manipulation. A harsh fantasy where the willingly blind are hostile to the nonconformist. Sometimes, the world seems darker with your eyes open. Unfinished, unpolished game. Several bugged achievements and a nice big crash when quiting the game. Maybe you are lucky and Alt + F4 works. Otherwise you have to restart. Great work. Beside that? Graphics are freaking scary. Our hero looks like a cartoonish LSD version of our beloved witcher Geralt. Musics are good, sounds are basically screams.

Pros:
Thought-provoking concept and philosophy
Controls are taught by experimentation, not a tutorial
Requires critical thinking and reasoning to get through puzzles
Several puzzles require coordination and setting up elements to go off simultaneously
Creepy as hell antagonists
Suspenseful atmosphere

Cons:
Some of the puzzles are REALLY HARD
Protagonist is unable to run, which makes timing more difficult
Can only scream in four cardinal directions

I love this game. I get scared and sucked into stories very easily, so just the idea of sneaking around and nearly getting caught because of the sound of my footsteps is enough to raise my heart rate a little bit. The narrator raises interesting questions about the world of the protagonist and the philosophy they live by, and on occasion makes me question my own philosophy. Introspection win right there! 

I've had no issues with the gameplay itself, very smooth. The art is reminiscent of dystopian novels and movies, everything is familiar (everyone has seen boardwalks, boxes, and flowers) but vaguely unsettling. The soundtrack is okay, it's not too fantastic to distract from the story, but not mediocre or repetitive enough for me to hate it.

Soo i'll probably get a lot of hate because of this review, but whatever.

Lets begin with what I actually LIKE about that game:
[list]
  [*] The story is interesting
  [*] Voice acting is great
  [*] Good, artsy, comic-like graphics
  [*] Amazing concept
[/list]

[i]""So if you like so much why the negative review??""[/i]
Don't worry, son. Here comes the juicy stuff:
[list]
  [*] You're really slow
  [*] Music, main protagonist's scream and sound in general are just painful
  [*] You can't see a whole level, so you have to move around to figure out a puzzle... Did I mention you're really slow?
  [*] The ""tips"" in titles are sometimes obvious, sometimes meaningless (at least for me)
  [*] JUST GRAB THE DAMN BOX!!!
  [*] WHY CAN'T YOU SCREAM THAT WAY YOU PIECE OF.......
  [*] STUPID HORN MOVE THIS WAY NOT THAT WAY!!
  [*] Frustrating
  [*] There's sometimes more than one way to finish a level... Because it's broken..
  [*] Walking animation sucks. i.e.: he just snaps instead of turning like a normal homo sapiens
  [*] Plays veeeeerryyy slowly

The art style in this game is something else & it has a brilliant concept, the enemies are all blind & can only hear you. Which leads us to the games premise, sound is your friend.

As you move through the game, some of the puzzles do get slightly taxing, nothing too major though & you do feel good when you finish one that had you irked for a while.

If you see this for sale at 15p, buy it, it's that simple.

Чтобы приготовить бисквитный рулет, вам потребуются следующие ингредиенты:
*****************************************************************************************
2 ст. пшеничной муки
1 ст. сахара
400 г свежей или замороженной малины
8 яичных желтков
4 яичных белка
8 ст. л. сахарной пудры
1 ст. л. картофельного крахмала
500 мл 33%-ных сливок.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Как готовится бисквитный рулет «Сладкая малинка»:

1. Яичные желтки и половину сахара поместить в миску, вилкой растереть до появления белой пены. Белки взбить в миксере в пену, постепенно прибавить к ним вторую половину сахара, продолжая взбивать. В результате должна получиться устойчивая белая масса, которую следует аккуратно вылить в желтки, перемешивая ложкой сверху вниз. Муку смешать с крахмалом, просеять в яичную смесь, перемешивать тесто от краёв к центру, пока не разойдутся все комочки. Вылить тесто на противень, застеленный пергаментом и в течение 8-10 минут испечь корж при среднем жаре (170-180 градусов). 
2. Готовый корж снять с противня вместе с пергаментом, перевернуть его на чистый лист бумаги, посыпанный сахаром или сахарной пудрой, бумагу, на которой он выпекался, снять. Накрыть бисквит сбрызнутой водой салфеткой и дать ему остыть.
3. Малину промыть (ели Вы используете замороженные ягоды – разморозить), положить ягоды в дуршлаг и подождать, пока с них стечёт лишняя жидкость. Немного ягод отложить в отдельную посуду, остальные размять вилкой. Сливки взбить в пену с сахарной пудрой, выложить их в малину, перемешать. 
4. Бисквит смазать ровным слоем начинки, свернуть рулетом и поместить швом вниз на поднос или блюдо. Посыпать изделие сахарной пудрой и украсить ягодами. Пред употреблением рулет лучше на 1-2 часа отправить в холодильник.",1485705445,1485705445,True,8,15,0.469380438327789307,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A lot of the time using a simple graphical style, with a mostly basic story-line and more often than not, reusing the same puzzles and mechanics. So what sets See No Evil apart from the endless stream of clones and failures.
To begin with I’ll start by mentioning the fact that it’s not too dissimilar from a lot of games in the genre. The puzzles are somewhat familiar; pushing boxes, standing on switches all to reach the level’s exit. There is a bit of twist, however. Sound plays a very important part in the puzzles, in some more than others. Blind but dangerous enemies patrol some of the levels. If they hear your footsteps or your shouting they will hunt you down. Standing still can sometimes help you survive, but very rarely. This gives See No Evil a slight stealth feeling to it. Watching the enemies patrols and waiting for the right moment to move can feel very sneaky sneaky. You can distract them too with bell flowers or huge horns, allowing for you to tiptoe past while they check what’s going on. Some of the puzzles are quite complex and take time to think about before actually setting things into motion. Some blocks will lower when the matching pressure plate is pressed, which in turn can raise other blocks instead. Sometimes enemy patrols will prevent you from getting to where you need to be. There are a number of different obstacles to overcome in order to reach the exit, and as you progress through the game things gets tougher and a lot more complex. 

Graphically the game has a charming, hand drawn style to it. Levels are mostly simple, with an obvious theme running through them. Whether its through a crumbling castle, a lush, green woodland or an abandoned factory the style is somewhat refreshing. As well as that, it’s not overly cluttered or distracting, allowing the player to easily see the sound indications as well as which objects can be interacted with and not.
The sound effects are very clear as is the music. Each area has a different music track, which at times can get a little bit grating as it plays on a constant loop. But it has a somewhat retro or classic feel to it, along with most of the game for that matter. Even though the game has a dark and foreboding story running through it, the music almost lightens the mood. 
Talking of the story, you play as a Seer, whatever that is, and are guided by a journal left in your prison cell. You’re opposed by a group of blind evil doers that are afraid of what they don’t know. It’s not all that in-depth, to be fair, but it stops the game from feeling dry and emotionless, not to mention it helps with that feeling of progression. 

Lastly lets talk about the games mechanics. There are always small problems with indie games, when it comes down to mechanics. Sometimes they’re things not even worth mentioning. But there are some that affect a game in such a way that they can’t be overlooked. In See No Evil there are a small number of glaring mechanical problems. Interactions with certain object require the player to be in a particular spot for it to actually work, which can be frustrating when you might be against the clock or trying to avoid an enemy patrol. Alongside that, some of the walls seem to be made of glue as the player might find themselves getting stuck to said walls. This doesn’t count for every wall, infact I found it to be a rare occurrence, although it was a small annoyance when it did happen. Lastly it would be nice if the player were able to move even a smidgen faster. Moving about the levels seems to take a long time, a small sprint function or maybe just an increase in movement speed would be a welcome thing. 

But, to conclude, I’d say See No Evil feels almost original in its ideas. The graphical style is pleasing to look at and the music is refreshing to boot. The story is lacking however, but I guess you can’t have everything. If you want a different angle on the indie, puzzle genre then See No Evil might be worth your time.

Going into this game I was hoping for a fresh concept on this puzzle genre, unfortuantly it ended up being like all the rest, avoid the enemies, push some boxes, step on some buttons. See No Evil started out with me feeling immersed in the world and story and wanting to know more about this character I has taken control of, the feeling ended very quickly as the game just became what felt like generic puzzle room after room, losing the sense of adventure I had started out with. As far as difficulty, no level had me stumped, most people should have no issue with solving these puzzles especially if you have already played similar games.

Hint: Restarting a level does not count as a death, probably since there are actually a few places where you can get stuck. Make use of that when going for ""no death"" chapters.

+ Okay music
+ Okay story with cool delivery of the end
+ Great art style
+ Two instances, Game and Game Plus
0 Spikes sometimes walkable
- Some invisible walls and edges
- Some odd or inconsequent decisions regarding controls
- Some achievements are broken

Basically, you play the Seer, a pretty literal description of the avatar and you try to escape a dystopian society, reminding me of 1984 and The Giver. In order to escape, the Seer needs to pass levels by solving mainly lever-based puzzles. Don't worry, there is a sufficient variety of ""levers"". At the beginning of levels you get encouraging and instructive text messages and discouraging voice messages, both vying for your attention and compliance. Those two types of messages well fit the background story.

I really like the delivery at the end of the game, although the first time around I wasn't prepared for the end to come and couldn't completely enjoy the composition - well done.

What made me play the game, apart from it being a puzzler, was the art style. It's clean and pretty, functional and decent. Congratulations on that.

I did not quite catch when the second instance, ""Game Plus"", got activated. I guess it activates after the first playthrough and provides more levels as well as modified, read harder, versions of the levels in the first instance.

The second instance makes ""no death"" runs a challenge, although I couldn't be bothered to go for the corresponding achievement since a few of them are broken and if I can't get them all I'm not too enthusiastic about getting any.
Specifically achievements connected to the third chapters in both instances are broken. Each chapter 3 has one achievement for simple completion and one for ""no death"" run. Additionally, there is one achievement bound to a specific level and one OCD achievement - both of which can probably be earned in either instance (in theory). Of those six achievement I have earned all, with the possible exception of the OCD one, but I've been awarded only the level-specific one. By logic alone I should also have at least the simple completion achievements.

There is a number of odd decisions in the game. I didn't like that the Seer needs to stand still to scream.
Levels are presented in an isometric fashion with its horizontal axis corresponding to the screen's horizontal axis and its vertical axis being skewed a bit to the left. Yet, the Seer moves along screen axes or diagonal.
The Seer has eight moving directions, less than enemies, and only four directions to look in, NSEW.
I guess, the four looking directions come from the puzzle design and the moving directions got diagonal movement added so it doesn't feel like an '80s game. One problem here is correspondence of both type of directions. Looking up or down is favoured over right or left, so moving diagonal makes you look up or down. That makes the analogue stick too unreliable for puzzle elements requiring rather precise controls.
So unless you are in sort of a binary puzzle element keep your thumb away from the analogue stick. 
The Seer only grabs boxes when grabbing after running into the box. Since the grab button is not used for something else I'd rather have it also grab when pressing the button first then running into the box.
The double-horns, i.e. phonetic redirectors, have inconsistent turn mechanics. Depending on the Seer's position relative to a horn pressing, for example, left will turn the horn clockwise or counter-clockwise. It's the same rotation for standing left and right of the horn but the other one for standing above or below. Turning horns felt somewhat sticky, i.e. I often turned the horn involuntarily when I actually wanted to walk away.
I encountered only two or three invisible walls but a lot more invisible edge, i.e. obstacles where the Seer wouldn't move on without any visual representation. This may be connected to the movement not quite fitting the view.
Cutscenes are unskippable which might be just acceptable for the first time around but is irritating when repeated. There is not a lot of cutscenes, so that's not too much of a problem.
The scream ability sometimes doesn't make it across switches.

Despite the above, See No Evil is a good game and I recommend it for people who look for the next puzzler. I might come back and see if I can get the broken achievements.",1441420804,1441420804,True,1,0,0.500143468379974365,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Přesměrovávat zvuk pomocí megafonů. Vyhýbat se střelám z kulometů. Otevřít si cestu dál a přežít. Přemýšlet.

See No Evil is actually an isometric puzzle game focused on sounds. No, this is not a rhythm game, but a game where you have to manipulate sounds in order to advance through the levels.

The (rather vague) story of See No Evil takes you through several chapters, each chapter consisting of a good amount of levels that will test both your patience and intelligence. Like pretty much any puzzle game out there the game starts easy but progressively becomes harder. But, to be honest, there are some pretty easy levels later on as well (or easier, at least). So it has a nice mix of both. Great for the gamers that usually get stuck later when puzzles sometimes become too difficult to solve (like me). But it’s not so great for those that are looking to be challenged until the very end of a game. I do think the difficulty is a bit inconsistent here, because the game doesn’t need to throw easier levels at you in order to tell its story. Still, I appreciated the fact that it made things easier every now and then. After a hard day of work I don’t want to think too long about how to solve a certain puzzle.

So, the game is based on sound manipulation so whenever your character moves pulsating circles can be seen at your feet. These circles mark a certain distance before anyone hears you; get too close to an enemy and he will hear you and finally start chasing you. But push a box in front of you and it will block a part of these sounds and because of it you can easily get past this same enemy. 
Later in the game horns are also introduced. Scream into one and the produced sounds will travel further. These horns are shaped like an L so if you rotate enough of them you can let the sounds travel around in circles, or other any way you want them to, until something (usually a row of blocks) stops it from continuing. 
There are even more things that you have to manipulate before you can continue; for example, snow leaves a trail so it’s recommended to walk around a few blocks so that you aren’t immediately noticed by an enemy. Switches also have to be used to solve puzzles, sometimes with blocks, other times without them. The later levels will combine all of these elements together to create deep and tough puzzles.

Graphically the game looks pretty. It’s all made in 2D and the game itself has a somewhat dark atmosphere. But not too dark. There’s nothing twisted, freaky or creepy here, just some weird stuff. 
The main character reminded me a bit of the character from Bastion. This could just be a coincidence I guess. Anyway, everything is well animated and it all looks good. Your character does walk rather slow, though, and it’s one of my minor complaints. Speeding things up with a patch would only break the game so I know for a fact that it won’t be fixed and it’s not even game breaking, but it is slightly annoying if you ask me.
The sounds effects are fairly basic, with some guns rattling and a whole lot of screaming. I must admit that I’ve heard more comforting sounds in my life, but these do fit the game’s style.
The music on the other hand is quite good. Good but also repetitive.

So far the game has taken me 3-4 hours to get where I am (I think I’m near the end of chapter 3) and since there are 4 chapters I guess it could take one roughly 5-7 hours to finish it, which is more than enough for a puzzle game these days. For the hardcore gamers the developer integrated New Game+. I only assume the game will mix puzzles up should you choose to do this, and maybe there are some extra puzzles in it as well, who knows ?

See No Evil is a love it or hate it kind of game I think. But, this is usually true for most puzzle games. I for one enjoyed it (still am enjoying it actually) because it has a good mix of simple and complex puzzles and its mysterious story kept me intrigued up until where I am now. I will definitely finish this one soon, that’s for sure. 
If you enjoy puzzle games, even for just a little bit, then this is a game you should absolutely play. It can ‘easily’ be finished in one long sitting or in smaller sessions where you just finish a couple of levels each time. It doesn’t really matter; just take your time and enjoy the ride.

See No Evil es un juego de uno de los creadores de Dungeon Defenders que acaba de salir el 26 de agosto en Steam. Logró abrirse paso gracias a KickStarter y un 123% de los 2000 dólares que pedía su creador, Gabriel Priske.

Es un juego de puzzles en el que tendremos que controlar el sonido para seguir desbloqueando niveles, divididos en capítulos, que se diferencian por temáticas diferentes en cada escenario, además de un aumento de dificultad, que iremos notando gradualmente conforme avancemos. Nuestros pasos y nuestra voz generarán ondas de sonido que bien podrán ayudarnos a despistar a nuestros también ciegos enemigos, pero si no somos pacientes o no las utilizamos con cautela, podremos ser detectados sin poder escapar de la muerte.

El apartado gráfico es impresionante y para mí, que no me suele gustar mucho este tipo de juegos, me parece super adictivo.

The game controls very easily which leaves you to focus on the puzzles which will sometimes cause you to take a step back and think twice before entering into a level. The animation and art styles are unique and beautiful, and the puzzles are challenging but not rage quit inducing.
