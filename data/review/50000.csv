It's a whopping 13 years old at the time of this review.  It's a 3D rendered low(ish) poly puzzle action game where you control a little rocket ship and must make your way to the ""finish"" zone to clear each puzzle level.  The trick is, your floaty little ship has no propulsion, while you can turn around in little loops to slow down your descent, you won't be able to make it to the exit unless you use the various cannons and other environmental gimmicks to propel yourself.  It's a simple and somewhat shallow premise for a game, but it does ""work"" in terms of ""is this a game that can be played"". 

Despite the age, some effort went into the game design such that the game has customisable controls and even 4K support, although video tweaking options are lacking.  Regardless, meeting some of the basic minimum requirements for a PC game is unusual for indie/amateur developers, so this is an achievement. 

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the mid 2000s.  They're not completely bad due to some degree of overall polish on the game, and if there was more to the gameplay this might even get a pass for visuals.  Very close to line on what's ok and what's not in 2023. 

While this is on PC, it has all the hallmarks and deficiencies of a console game, from the clunkier than needed control scheme to the less than cutting edge graphics.  There's 10's of thousands of PC games on Steam, and PC gamers deserve only the best.  This might not appeal to many gamers due to the lack of PC-centric design.  It's unclear why this game was never accepted on the video game console appliances it seems to have been designed for, and in some ways that's a shame because the game would have had considerably more success on the consoles and mobile phones it's more suited to. 

Nimbus didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for bumping meat onto a bbq in world 2-4, trivial to get if you play the game for more than half an hour, but less than 29 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game... which goes back to my point about this simply being on the wrong platform.

Nimbus is massively overpriced for a 13 year old console-esque game, at $10 USD, it's not worth it.",1690528368,1690528368,False,5,1,0.287306278944015503,0,False,False,False,True,

Despite the limited number of inputs, it can be challenging at first to get your head around controlling your ship as its orientation changes. The first levels do a good job of easing you in, but ultimately i had to struggle for a while with right and left on the D-pad representing clockwise and counter-clockwise before it started to click in my brain. The game controls fine with a gamepad, though in retrospect i think i'd have been better off using a keyboard for a bit more precision in quick direction changes.

The levels are a mix of puzzle and execution, and both of those elements ramp up considerably in difficulty if you want to go for optional goals like time attacks or getting all the coins. That gives the levels a lot of replay value, and while i didn't intend to chase after good times when i started playing, i eventually found myself getting sucked into trying to find optimal routes through each stage and complete clean runs. There are a handful of levels i felt were a bit too demanding for the limited amount of control you have over your momentum (the levels designed around white holes in particular tended to be the most frustrating, along with some of the optional scrapyard levels), but that is mostly an issue with trying to speed run or complete hard mode, which disables checkpoints, and was probably exacerbated by not using a keyboard.

I expected a bit of physics inconsistency to be introduced by rounding error or frame speed, but it's very, very good at enforcing consistency.  Moving obstacles or cannon fire will always be at X time where they were at X time, and stuff like falling stacks of hazards will always fall the same way.

Momentum-based platforming is a highly underused mechanic and probably Nimbus is at fault here, because it did such a good job that there were no ideas left to explore for other games.

Getting through the regular levels has a nice difficulty curve and is an average dexterity challenge with light puzzle elements. Afterwards, you still have plenty of goals to aim for. Find all secret exits, collect all hidden coins, beat the game on hard (no checkpoints within levels), do the Christmas bonus levels, complete the scrapyard levels, complete speedruns on selected levels. There is plenty of content here.

At some point the game almost overstays its welcome when it asks you to complete the scrapyard to get all achievements. As the title implies, the scrapyard contains levels that didn't make it into the regular campaign. Most of the levels are actually fine, but two of them are just ridiculously difficult to the point of simply being annoying. Maybe even so annoying that finally completing them didn't even feel like a reward anymore, just a relief.

Some other reviewers criticize the game for having ""inverted"" controls. They are definitely not ""inverted"", they are simply ""relative"" to your spaceship. Pressing right will always do a clockwise turn. But if you are travelling downwards currently, a clockwise turn might feel like a left turn to you, if you aren't accustomed to it. Relative controls might not be very beginner-friendly, but when mastered, they are more precise. If you don't believe me, check out Rocket League. That game wouldn't even be possible without relative controls.

I like it.

The whole game is a level-based time trial where you're a projectile trying to fight against gravity to get to the goal. There are little trinkets to collect in some of the levels and the hub UI tells you when there is and isn't a coin in a level. And as confusing as the controls are starting out, they are at least consistent enough to get used to after a bit. All things considered, this game is way more polished than I expected it to be.

Video Review:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj0zZwFnBj4

Summary:
Nimbus is a fun game in which you are a ship with no engine, where you are constantly falling and have to rely on some great feeling momentum physics to solve puzzles and progress through the levels. The game has clean and colourful graphics that may not 'wow' you but they present the game well enough. The soundtrack is pleasant and sets a relaxed tone to the game, despite not being all that memorable. 

Really good level design is what makes Nimbus stand out to me as the stages do make the most out of the simple mechanics. However, because, in my opinion, there's not too much to these core mechanics of the game, I started to lose interest after a couple of hours. 

Overall an entertaining 'pick up and play' game that may be relatively basic in some areas, but some great level design means it is something I'm happy to have played through.

Score: 7/10

That is where the game shines the most: a unique gameplay, very addictive, oldschool-orientated and so hardcore! The difficulty is usually perfectly dosed (the beginning is easy and tutorial-ish, yet the more you go on the more you will take hours to finish ONE level...) for most levels, and finishing the game or ""really finishing"" the game are 2 different things!

Overall a great indie game, with a sweet oldschool style, reminiscent of the nineties and the arcade style. Perfect for retro gamers and for lonely rainy sundays! If you can close your eyes on many little casual flaws and average development aspects, and if you enjoy the classic arcade style, this game is for you. For me it was a very nice surprise and I still have not finished it, I savour it! I am looking forward to future games from this studio, ALTHOUGH their next one, SnakeBird, was not very interesting for me when I tried it on smartphone... but they have talent!

Beh, fatelo, merita.
La trama, vabbè, è un pretesto per infilarci un boss finale.
Ma è un gioco sostanzialmente molto semplice. Con le frecce si muove la navetta, e con un pulsante si frena. Fine. 
Il resto (la velocità, le planate, i rimbalzi, eccetera) è dato tutto dalla fisica, e dai numerosi strumenti messi nei vari livelli, che hanno una curva di difficoltà ben bilanciata e non risultano quasi mai banali, complici varie trovate (chiavi, interruttori, portali) che di volta in volta li rendono originali.
Ha però due difetti da menzionare:

- il sistema di controllo in generale è buono, ma diverse volte la navetta va un po' per conto suo, specialmente nei livelli in cui si cambia la gravità (e i controlli tipo si invertono) o in quelli (tantissimi) in cui bisogna prendere velocità per raggiungere aree lontane. Ecco, provare a controllare una navetta che viaggia a 300 km/h è un casino. Sì, poi ci si prende un po' la mano, ma non sono rare le volte in cui comunque si sbatte addosso a un qualche pixel, costringendo a rifare. 
- alcuni dei livelli più avanzati hanno elementi (palle, soprattutto) da far rimbalzare/rotolare andandoci addosso con la navetta e robe simili, il che va anche bene, peccato che però spesso le palle vadano dove vogliono loro (e qui vi lascio ai doppi sensi). Ok, seguono sempre la fisica ben fatta del gioco, ma la sensazione di avere poco controllo su questi elementi è alta, e a volte potrebbe risultare noioso. Fortunatamente i livelli così sono pochi.

Per il resto, il grado di sfida è buono, ci sono tanti segreti da scoprire e livelli extra che non sfigurerebbero in Super Meat Boy in quanto a madonne tirate giù. Il gioco in sè dura anche abbastanza, specialmente se si vuole sbloccare tutto, perciò se cercate un titolo all'apparenza semplice ma coinvolgente e quasi sempre ben realizzato, non posso che consigliarvelo.",1459535246,1459535246,True,2,0,0.508064508438110352,0,False,False,False,False,

Casual: A, I can turn this game on at any time to decompress, however there are some levels that just shouldn't be attempted if you have high blood pressure problems.

Difficulty Scale: C, they mark each level with a difficulty from 1-10, I find those markings somewhat arbitrary, you can accidentally stumble across hidden levels with low difficulty only to find them much harder than stated. *SPOILERS -->* the final level throws such a curveball at you it can only be compared to the final level of Trine.  It isn't necessisarily difficult per say, but its a massive shift in the pace of the game.

Replay value: B, you can easily get some of the bonus unlocks your first play through, the bonus tokens are very simple in the early levels, and the unlockable cosmetic modifications to your ship are fun, but it isn't going to bring you back if you aren't into that kind of thing.

If you liked Super Meat Boy, then you should like Nimbus. It's in the same category of game, in that it's an action platformer with puzzle-y elements.

It differs from Meat Boy in that you have to keep up momentum. Generally this means that, while you can slow down in Meat Boy, you can't here. There are easier levels and harder levels (and impossible ones), and I've found that I get the same sort of satisfaction from beating a level in Nimbus that I did in Super Meat Boy.

I don't want to compare the two games too much, because there are a couple giant differences. The momentum thing is one. Another is it's a fair bit more puzzle-y and less twitch gameplay.

The first time you play through it's fun to see what will come up next, and after that it's all about beating your friends (or your own) fastest time. Depending on what type of player you are, you'll also make sure to gather all the coins and secrets either on your first or a subsequent playthrough.

One minor complaint is that the game-logic is tied to your FPS, meaning that if you're on a slow computer (like mine) your ship will move slower, which will make it easier to complete levels and get coins while making your resulting times higher. This can be avoided to a degree by reducing graphical settings and resolution to the lowest possible, but you really need a capable enough computer if you want to compete.",1309716505,1309716505,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,

Your objective is to guide your ship to the end, but it has no propulsion of its own, meaning you must use gravity, and various methods of acceleration via interaction with other objects, to get there.

The game manages to be challenging, without being frustrating, for the most part. Another layer of gameplay lies in the timer it gives you, allowing you to attempt to get the best time for the level for leaderboard comparison. However, any in-level checkpoints don't pull back your timer, so the level will usually have to be completed in one life for a decent time, making some levels really difficult.

With lots of second exits which lead to secret levels, the volume of content is huge for an indie game. Yet to complete it, but I imagine I still have hours of playtime left.
