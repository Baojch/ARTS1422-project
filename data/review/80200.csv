Parts of the world have to buy technology you paid to develop from each other, makes no sense. (south america buys 'deep sea drilling technology' from north america)

Why give me this amount of detail, but so little control? if it's big picture, give me big picture overviews.

Its politics is also questionable as far as climate policy goes, as it is a firm believer in the power of managed capitalism to buy our way out of global warming.

It is also stuck on a strict 'developed world', 'developing', 'underdeveloped' framing. The end goal of human existence is the united states, not living in harmony with nature or something.

Máme za úkol do určitého času udržet ve dvanácti světových regionech podporování naší mezinárodní organizace, a dosáhnout do toho času vždy nějaký určitý cíl. Např v misi Fuel Crisis je úkolem zajistit, aby se do roku 2120 globální neoteplilo o více než 3 stupně a aby index lidského rozvoje (HDI) v každém regionu byl nad úrovní 0,5. Nebo v misi The Flood je úkolem zajistit, aby do roku 2200 nezemřelo více než 10 milionů lidí v důsledku klimatické migrace a více než 1,5 miliardy v důsledku preventivních opatření.

V každém regionu máme k dispozici své vlastní orgány - úřad pro ochranu životního prostředí, technologický úřad, energetický úřad, úřad pro sociální věci, úřad pro politické záležitosti a kanceláře pro různé projekty. Na každém z těchto orgánů máme na výběr 10 - 20 možností a z nich všech si můžeme vybrat dohromady celkově 6 zvlášť pro každý region. Můžeme například podporovat organické farmářství (bez používání pesticidů), rozšířit produkci biopaliv, spustit osvětovou kampaň v oblasti změny klimatu, zavést politiku jednoho dítěte, zavést v regionu bezuhlíkové energie, spustit dlouholeté programy zalesňování atd.

Vůbec však nestačí naťukat si zelený program a čekat na vítězství. Regiony jsou totiž postihovány i ekologickými katastrofami, jako povodně, znečištění a lesní požáry, které je třeba řešit. Stavy různých oblastí regionů jsou poskytovány prostřednictvím zpráv, grafů a statistik, které je třeba každý tah sledovat. Místní obyvatelé nás také zaměstnávají vlastními požadavky, které se do plánu vůbec nehodí - chtějí řešit nezaměstnanost, výstavbu silnic, zajišťování pitné vody, dovoz léků a potravin, jinak začnou být nespokojeni. Začnou se, nevděčníci, bouřit například i tehdy, když zavedeme opatření na ochranu přírody a ohrožených druhů (omezí to farmaření a lov) nebo když zavedeme vegetariánskou revoluci.

My potřebujeme zelený svět, ale zelený svět může redukovat možnosti a blahobyt lidí - a lidé chtějí blahobyt. Naštěstí máme páky i na situace, kdy začnou příliš vyskakovat - můžeme najmout si vlastní tajné ozbrojené složky, které budou dočasně zajišťovat naše cíle. Nebo tajně zafinancovat místní povstalecké skupiny. Nebo napustit antikoncepční přípravky do zdrojů pitné vody, a následně spustit kampaň Baby Boom, ve které se budeme tvářit, že se těšíme z nových dětiček - zvýší to popularitu. A pokud jsou lídři nějakého regionu nespokojeni s naší ekologicko-humanitární organizací, můžeme zatahat za nitky a zkusit je vyměnit. Nejkrajnější možností je vyvinout biozbraně, které budou usmrcovat místní populace druhu homo sapiens. Všechny nepopulární praktiky zároveň můžeme zahalit nekonečnými vlnami zpráv o celebritách a bulvárem, v rámci mediální dezinformační kampaně. Navzdory těmto možnostem Fate of the World však není nic takového jako Depopulation nebo Plague Inc, nekalé metody k výhře zdaleka nestačí - a pokud je místní odhalí, naše organizace může být v regionu zcela zakázána, a může být na jejího ředitele dokonce spáchán atentát (podobně jako v Democracy 3: Extremism) a tím hra okamžitě končí prohrou.

Navzdory tomu všemu, co jsem psal - přesto, že tato hra je obalena ekologickými tematikami, nejde o žádnou zelenou agitku. Je to jen takový podnět vložen do strategické klikačky, která je náročná na trpělivost. Ale výhodou je, že v každém tahu máme neomezený čas, tedy si můžeme pomaličku projít každý region zvlášť, aniž nás náhlý byl nějaké odpočítávání. Navíc si můžeme každý tah sejvovat a v případě potřeby se tedy vrátit o pár tahů zpět.

그냥 개발 하다가 게임을 너무 쉽게 만들지 않기위해 + 핵발전소 싫어 프로파간다가 좀 섞인것 같습니다.

이게 마음에 안드시면 제가 토론에 올려놓은 패치법으로 수정하시면 됩니다. 

고득점으로 승리를 해도 찝찝한 게임입니다.

-No one likes me, no one likes my reviews. Not even a microbe of the tiny air molecule reads my review.
-You will be disliked and insulted by many that comes randomly in your life , be it through internet or random shoulder bump on a mall or park, millions dislike you, they dislike what you do, they dislike your appearance, they dislike your presence, they dislike the fact that you have a profile on steam, they dislike because you are open-source human dustbin which can fill trash as insults, What matters is what you choose, Are you the one to chase behind those who rejected or insulted you or are you going to choose who still accepts you in their hearts for your mistakes. Are you going to chase those who blocked you for that one bad humor that you said or are you going to choose those who just likes you the way you are. STOP Caring about the world and stick with those 5-6 good people.  Rest are just epitome of evil embolded into humans that god sprinkled in front of you to make you stronger. They hate the way you dance, they hate the way you play, they hate the games you play, they hate that paintings you draw, but who likes you is what matters . Let them hate.

Your resources are limited. Do you focus on reducing emissions as quickly as possible, or do you start by building infrastructure to adapt the world for a changing climate? Which technologies will you invest in? Do you horde the world's resources for the developed world, or do you impose extra taxes on the developed world while investing heavily in education, infrastructure, and medicine for the developing world? The game even allows you to consider the darkest of options to deal with overpopulation, such as poisoning people to make them infertile, or introducing a man-made virus to kill off the population directly. It's not a one-dimensional game -- there are a number of different strategies and technologies you can apply to win. 

I had a ton of fun with this game, racking up 75 hours in order to beat all of the missions. I did not use any mods -- I only played the standard version (with all the DLCs). I would strongly recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of puzzle games and/or card-based games, and who doesn't mind losing each mission a few times in order to figure out, through trial and error, how to overcome this lovable, quirky, half-joking-but-half-serious climate disaster simulator. 

Good luck! The game is hard -- only 1 in 50 players has the achievement for beating the final mission (""Three Degrees""). Will you be among them?

Here are some strategy tips for new players:[list]
[*]When the global temperature increases above two degrees, arctic methane will begin escaping from the permafrost, hastening global warming and making it much harder to win the game. Ideally you should try to prevent this from happening, or at least delay it. You will need to research and play ""Deploy Sulfate Aerosols"" in four or five countries starting around 2045 to have a chance of holding the global temperature below two degrees. 
[*]The rainforests in South America and South Asia soak up a bunch of carbon dioxide and need to be protected from desertification. I suggest playing ""Protect Land, Soil & Forests"" in both territories starting on turn one.
[*]""Cap & Trade Carbon Emissions"" is a critical card that you pretty much need to play at some point during every mission in order to be successful. Aim to play this card in every territory starting no later than 2080 -- but the earlier you can start, the better.
[*]At the beginning of the game, China and India are belching out unbelievable amounts of coal smoke, and invariably these two countries will be your worst polluters unless you do something about it. I strongly suggest you play ""Coal-Free Industry"" in both territories on turn one, and build an Energy Office in both territories on turn one so you're set up to play ""Decline Coal Power"" on turn two. 
[*]As you reduce coal usage across the world, you will need a substitute energy source. I suggest playing ""Expand [Natural] Gas Production"" in Russia and in the Middle East starting on turn two, to flood the world with cheap natural gas, to ensure that any reductions in coal power get replaced with cheap natural gas.
[*]Cars still run on oil even after you change the mix of electricity, so you  need to make sure you don't run out of oil as the world's population continues to grow and develop economically. I suggest playing ""Expand Oil Production"" in North America and in the Middle East starting on turn 2 or 3, so people's cars won't run out of oil. 
[*]Try to build all of the Environment Office improvements in every territory, because the weather will become more severe over time and these improvements will become more and more important for keeping territories happy. 
[*]Note that educating the developing world will slow down their population growth while also increasing their GDP (and therefore your tax revenue) so it's generally a good idea to educate the developing world as quickly as possible.",1594526975,1594600231,True,3,0,0.555256068706512451,0,True,False,False,False,

The game models world population, economic activity, resource extraction, and of course climate change in a sometimes questionable, but not completely absurd, manner. The game consists of you poring over dozens of different figures for different regions of the world, trying to figure out how to stop the Indians from breeding or the Middle East from exploding into violence, choosing what policies to implement, hitting end turn, and repeating forty or so times. 

In a scenario you are given an objective, typically to keep global warming below 3 C, which you have to balance against keeping the people happy enough to keep funding your organisation. As a result just starving the world isn't always an option (though it does work sometimes). Not everyone's cup of tea, but it is mine.

There is a fan-made patch which is more or less obligatory.

Pros:
-- Statistics
-- While the game is rather heavy on the green propaganda, it does give you a surprising amount of flexibility in how you achieve your goal. Your task is to keep global warming in check: whether or not you keep society intact is up to you.
-- It lets you bioplague India.

Cons:
-- There is a lack of variety in the scenarios. Almost all require you to keep global warming below 3 C subject to certain constraints. It'd be interesting to have, say, a scenario to raise/lower the population to a certain level, or to change the world economy in some meaningful way.
-- Some of the mechanics are rather opaque.

Basic game play boils down to receiving a set amount of each world region that recognizes your authority. After this you assign agents to regions, which allow you to perform further actions in the region. There are several groups of policy actions that require you spend a slot and more money to access. These are the environmental, energy, science, welfare, and stability policies. Once you've spent as much money as you can, you press the end turn button to progress 5 years into the future. There is a complex system of working parts that runs, which will update each region's economy, ecology, energy and support for your agency. Finally, there is a global emissions total, and a temperature gauge that ticks up.

Information gathering in this game is a long and painful grind, and the mechanisms that run the world are simply not available for discovery. I spend so much time going through menus and digesting information that I don't get to actually go through turns, and often times information I want simply isn't available to the player. Those menus are difficult to interpret which only makes it harder to understand what's going on.

It seems to be a message about the complexity of climate change, but the approach sucks the time and life out of me each time I play it. Though I do think the mechanics are probably solid, I think there needs to be a serious UI redesign, and I doubt one will ever come.

There is a lot to like about this game. Do you care about climate change? Wish you could make a difference? This game lets you try out what being in charge of saving the world could be like. You try solutions and see what happens.

As a simulation, the game runs on statistics on a range of issues, affecting each region of the world. I don't think the data is current, but it was the best we had several years ago, so it tests you to address interrelated issues efficiently enough to make progress.

The Harsh
The designers were not wearing rosy glasses: this game can be really difficult. You might implement your favorite policies, only to see extinctions and massive fires proceed nonetheless. You might apply development assistance but see crises overtake a region and see they no longer wish to participate in fighting climate change. It's not easy to stay proactive instead of reactive as the world heats up and disasters accelerate. It's not easy to keep politicians on board.

Conclusion
This is a great game when you want to put your ideas and your mind to the test, but it's often difficult. It requires patience and tinkering, reevaluating strategies and trying others. Check statistics and adapt your plans. If that sounds like fun, I hope you enjoy diving in. If it sounds like a chore, Civ and similar games can give you a feel for climate change through rosier glasses, without so many hard choices.

This has been a guilty pleasure of mine for years. I’ve played it on and off, and since it’s turn based sometimes I can even play it while working on projects.  You take control of the GEO and do your best to fix the world from an impending environmental disaster.  It has so many factors that it’s insane to juggle them all, but that’s what makes the game fun.   It’s one of those games where it’s good to watch guides or read a guide to get the most out of it, and if you’re okay with that you’ll have a great time.  You can still mess around with it yourself and see what works, but there are many little sub factors to the game that have to be just ‘tried out’ sometimes. We don’t all have the time for that so guides are a godsend here.

I’ve played every scenario and beaten them all, though not with a perfect score.  By far my favorite is playing an open world sandbox and trying to make the world a better place for the long haul with cleaning up the world, keeping people having a high standard of living, and getting into space to make us a multi planet species.  I come back once a quarter and give the game a few hours to ‘relax’ and see if I can do better than last time.   The news from each region is essential to find out what disasters are coming next (floods, fires, droughts, etc.) Use them and see what you can do.

I THINK the game is done development fully and Fate of the World 2 failed it’s Kickstarter, which is a shame. It could’ve been a great game.  Obviously, with all the environmental factors in it, there are some ‘green overtones’ to the game, but nothing too major.   It’s just one of those games where, if you like to ‘be in control,’ you can have some fun, and you’ll realize just how BAD of a thing it is to be in control of the entire ‘Fate of the World.’   Enjoy!

Sadly, I was wrong. Yes, the underlying climate simulation engine may have been written by actual climate scientists, but its presentation is obtuse, and the game built around it is simplistic in the extreme.

The game is simplistic because you enact policies based on a one line summary of pros and cons, pay an implementation cost that is fixed irrespective of the particulars of the respective region (are you seriously saying that an eduction program for 300 million Africans will cost the same as for 1500 million Indians?), can not change the intensity of the policy (am I really taxing carbon without knowing the tax rate?)

The presentation is obtuse, because you are simply shown a set of measurements connected by glowing lines, but the meaning of the measurements, and the nature of their connection, is not communicated to the player. For instance, what is that ""capital index"" affecting ""agricultural production""? How can ""electricity produced"" be 20% lower than ""electricity consumed""? What is ""uranium take"", and why am I experiencing uranium shortages while still having untapped uranium deposits in every region? Does ""uranium market"" show supply or demand? Combine this with the simulation doing unexpected things (I reduced agricultural workforce by 20% to conserve water, only to have water consumption and agricultural emissions rise by 20%, while having agricultural production plummet by 50%) and it gets a tad frustrating ...

The UI is confusing, buttons and sequences that don't make sense, and Cards are simply awful to navigate & compare. I have no idea of the work my card does nor its outcome were I to play it.

Play a random agriculture card?? Suuure... I guess so?

本ゲームは環境破壊による人類社会崩壊を防ぎ、
持続可能な社会を構築していくシミュレーションである。
[b] 個人的にNo.1といって良いほど好きなゲーム。	[/b]
高難度な中トライ＆エラーしてクリア出来たときの達成感がすばらしい。


始まりの年は2020年。
環境破壊による破滅を防ぐため地球環境機関「GEO」の局長に就任する。
世界各国と協力して、森林破壊を防ぎ、再生エネルギーへの転換、
食料危機や貧困への対策を行い、地球環境悪化を防いでいく。

基本動作としては、各国にエージェントを派遣し
そのエージェントに施策を行ってもらい、問題を解決していってもらう。

ゲームシナリオは、2045年、2080年、2120年、2200年までの4段階ある。
また、その中でも世界環境の良し悪しで難易度が分かれている。
最初の方でも高難度だが、あくまでそれらはすべて""チュートリアル""なのである。
最終シナリオの「最悪環境下での2200年クリア」をするための学習なのだ。


とにかくシビアなのだ。

１手間違えるだけでミッション失敗となりうるのだ。
というか、数ターン先の状況を知った上で行動しないとほぼ積む。

とりあえず貧困がやばいので貧困対策していたらそのうち石炭枯渇して世界経済崩壊したり、
じゃぁ再生エネルギー拡大しようとしても後進国技術力足りなくて全然普及しないし、
そのうち石油もウランもなくなってまた世界経済崩壊。

がんばってエネルギー問題をクリアしていっても、
今度は温暖化による水不足により食料危機発生して各国で暴動発生しGEO脱退されてしまったり。

とにかくシビアなのだ。(２回目)

しかも経済活動や人口問題、エネルギーや環境汚染指数が複雑に絡み合っているため
各施策(カード)や技術開発の効果がすぐにわからないのだ。

そのため、セーブロードを繰り返して[b] 何度も地球を滅ぼしながら[/b]、
施策の長期的効果を探り、常に最善手は何かを模索していく。
この作業をエクセル等で数値をまとめながら効果を推定し(30時間くらい)
ようやく地球を救えた時は、やり遂げた達成感にとてつもなく包まれた。

[b]とにかくシビアなのだ。(３回目)[/b]


また音楽もすばらしい。
危機的な世界の暗闇の中、世界を救おうと奮闘しているGEOの活動に非常にマッチしている。
この曲を聞くとそのうち「地球救わなきゃ・・」と条件反射するようになることだろう。


[h1]さぁ、GEOと一緒にサティスナブルな世界をつくろうではないか！[/h1]


◆超重要◆
[b](農業+工業)*2＞商業でないと経済が崩壊し、GDPが急激に悪化する[/b]

注)ネタバレ
インドは[spoiler]とりあえずエネルギーを原子力一本化して大気汚染なくしとけば
いいんじゃないですかね・・・。その後のエネルギー問題はおいおいがんばりましょう	[/spoiler]

Reality game me a slap in the face at the following step though: no matter how many economical, social and environmental variables the games compute... it's nothing more than a card game at its core. The only thing you can do as a player is assigning 'agents' to certain areas of the world; you can then assign a card to any single agent. This card can be a policy, or a task. The policies are very generic, like ""Improve the basic education of the population"", or ""Make the commercial/industrial/agricultural"" side of the local economy grow. After having assigned the cards to every agent you deployed, you are just left at ending the turn and look at the consequences of the policies you adopted through the plethora of economic/social/environmental data. That's it. It's so disappointing. I've never seen such an unbalance between the complexity of the game engine (assuming that all those parameters are computed for real, and not just smoke and mirrors) and the limitations given to the player.",1509536069,1509536069,False,21,0,0.708699882030487061,2,True,False,False,False,

There's lots of colour to the game.

There are a few things I really dislike.  First, most of the information you need to make a decision isn't on the screen where you need to make it.   Should we spend on migrating away from industrial coal?  Well, first you have to go figure out how much coal is being used in industry, proportionally, to find the best place to spend that money.   Should I build facility X?  Well, that depends on what it enables (which is not shown -- you need to remember)

Much worse is that key commodities like coal and oil don't seem to have any price.   I mean, if oil is being produced, Japan is going to be able to buy some of it -- it's the POOREST places that get starved, not the ones farthest away.   And oil shortage = high oil price = new exploration, switching, and biofuels... the global environmental agency shouldn't need to fund more exploration.  Given that price signals (e.g. cap/trade or carbon tax) are a prime method of dealing with GHGs (both in reality and in the game) you'd think the devs would have modeled pricing.  

Last but not least -- ten years of 'security assistance' isn't going to suddenly stabilize North Africa.   Give me a break.

It still is?  Well then Fate of the World should still be relevant! 

Unfortunately it's still relevantly bad.   What was an interesting concept, comes out as a rather weak and mediocre card game if you can even call it that.    In fact it shouldn't be called a card game, but I'll get that to that in the moment. 

The entire game revolves around ""The world is going to shit"" for various reasons in each of the scenarios.   You have to control the world and make it better, and fix it with your... evil omniscience?  Ok you're SUPPOSED to be the good guys, but you have WAY too much visibility into the world, you can just ""Buy"" agents in different areas and have them enact policies... yeah a little twist and you're the villain trying to take over the world. 

But you're supposed to be GEO (a global enviromental organization ).  The Good guys who are going to protect the planet through... a card game system.  Uh oh, the planet is doomed. 

So the ""card game"" is really policies that your agents are implementing.   Agents can use one card every 5 years and some of them are on going.  The thing is this isn't a ""Card game"" this is a policy and politics game, but if you call it that no one would play.  This isn't like any card game I've played and the fact is, it's not a good change.  If it was just policies and instead of agents you could have ""employees"" or ""government workers"" we'd have a different story.   Instead there's a push for ""card games"" and so we call it and play it like that.  It's not and that's the first problem. 

The other problem is the ""cards"" are both not random and not that interesting.  You can use a card to build a technology office and then ""research biotech"".  That's sexy... too bad the explanation of what it does doesn't really leave any further insight.   In fact much of what you do in this game is the exact definition of government policies.  Poorly defined far reaching but hard to understand exactly what you did.  That's the government for you. 

And the thing is, often you have very abstract goals.  Raise HDI to .7 by yeah 2045.  If you fell asleep while reading that line, then you're probably normal.  The game uses these types of terms everywhere adding to the nebulousness.  There's wars and actions going on all over the game, and the fact is the player probably should care about this but none of it is that interesting and the player only has limited control or understanding of the effect of policies or why they aren't working. 

There ARE reasons but the fact is the user has to do so much digging understanding and learning and the game makes it so hard that to be honest, most players are probably better off going and playing almost any other game.  Even games like Diplomacy that I'm not a huge fan of do far better to explain their policies and subsystems, that it's a far better game. 

That's the real problem with this game, at the end of the day, the gameplay is abstract, the cards are uninteresting and while global warming/climate change/what ever we want to call it IS an issue, Fate of the World does the worst job trying to make it fun, interesting, or even worth the time to look into it.   This isn't even a game I'd say ""has a great idea"".  It's a game that probably sounded like it could be controversial or interesting at the time, but probably needed an entirely different design or team to deliver on it. 

But for what it is, I'd recommend pretty much no one to go play this.  Other games I've talked about there being a specific core group that should play it, but for this one, even the environmentally minded gamer is going to want something different than what this game promises.   If you do want governmental simulation, check out diplomacy.  But skip this.",1503266533,1503266533,False,10,2,0.367873460054397583,3,True,False,False,False,

I don't really know what Genre to put it into, probably some sort of strategy / cardgame, eventhough I find it to be more luck  and experience, than strategy, because it takes a very long time until you find out if an action has a positive or a negative effect, and there are so many actions that its extremely complicated to figure out everything - which you need to do to win.
So just by guessing, your chance of winning is probably higher (but still very low.)

2:Gameplay (2/5)
As many other reviews have already said: WAY TO HARD. If you like a challenge and never get frustrated , then feel free to try. Respect to everyone who has mastered this game. 
However, I dont like the cardgame-style of this game. With such a complex topic, it is very sad to let go of the potential the game has by turning it into just a complicated card game.
A tutorial would have been good for the playing-experience, but it wouldnt fit to the message of the game (at least the message I have gotten out of playing it).
The in-game menu is slightly illogical and complicated.

3:Story (4/5)
The best thing about this game is the story. Its really great that someone tried making a game just for fighting climate change, while maintaining high standards of living. And it fits very good to the human nature that the people start hating you, just for helping them, or rather not helping them enough. Which then leads to the player being kicked out of a country. Everything is pretty detailed, eventhough events repeat themselves often.
Negative about it is, what some people might understand as the message of the game :""It is nearly impossible to fight climate change, so you might as well give up trying."" Im sure this wasnt their intention, but due to the frustration you get from playing this, some might see it as such.

4:Playtime (3/5)
Of course you CAN spend many hours playing this, but at least for me it is not worth it.

5:Graphics & Sound (1/5)
Concerning sound: Nothing special
Concerning graphics: Some things too small and often you dont know where to klick, since its unclear which is a button and which just decoration.

Overall: (2.4/5)

In 2020, twenty years after a global cataclysm known as the US Presidential Election, teenager Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, the director of the special paramilitary force GEO. Shinji witnesses the United Nations forces battling a Tempurature Rise: one of a number of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Because of the Temperature Rise's near-impenetrable force-fields, GEO's giant bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Temperature Rises from annihilating humanity. GEO officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the GEO complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Unit-01 against the Temperature Rise. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the unit to go berserk and savagely kill the Temperature Rise on its own.

Following hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and begins settling in to life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys a Temperature Rise but runs away after the battle, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired and Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, a mysterious, and socially isolated teenage girl named Rei Ayanami. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Temperature Rise.

Ritsuko Akagi, GEO's chief scientist, reveals that the US Presidential Election was not caused by a meteor strike as officially reported, but instead resulted when the first Tempurature Rise arrived on Earth, codenamed Adam, exploded in the Antarctic. The pilot of Unit-02, teenage girl Asuka Langley Soryu, moves in with Misato and Shinji and joins her fellow pilots in defeating the next Tempurature Rises. Shinji's schoolfriend Toji Suzuhara is selected for Unit-03, but during his first test synchronization with the bio-machine, Unit-03 is hijacked by an Tempurature Risel. When Shinji refuses to destroy the rogue unit, his control over Unit-01 is cut off and supplanted by a prototype autopilot system known as the ""Dummy Plug"" system, and his bio-machine rips apart Unit-03 crushing Toji's cockpit. Shinji is devastated and quits piloting the bio-machine, but is forced to return to destroy a Tempurature Rise that has defeated both Asuka and Rei. Asuka loses her self-confidence following her defeat, and spirals into a deep depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an Tempurature Rise which attacks her mind. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji later visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is ""the third Rei"". Misato forces Ritsuko to reveal the dark secrets of GEO, the bio-machine graveyard and the Dummy Plug system which operates using clones of Rei.

Asuka is reduced to a catatonic state by her depression, and Kaworu Nagisa replaces her as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji, is revealed to be the final Tempurature Rise. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to thrive and asks Shinji to kill him. Despite his initial hesitation, Shinji kills Kaworu. Soon after this act, GEO and the US trigger the forced evolution of humanity, termed the ""Human Instrumentality Project"", in which the souls of all mankind are merged into one through Rei. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him. This allows him to be reunited with all of the main characters, who congratulate him.",1482544538,1549678426,True,3,13,0.434925496578216553,1,True,False,False,False,

# Beat up on coal early and also business and household regulations in the developed world. targetting high emissions / coal areas to give you a running start.

RInse and repeat. A happy world will open its pockets.An nagfy world jus gets angrier
# Don't neglect R&D. Japan is a good area to focus on since emissions are low and literacy high, so it can become the world's school.
# Go green. The investment pays back in willingness to invest, and a happy population that ultimately enables you to turn the corner on emissions .
# High priority early investments are infotech for smartgrids, energy for CCS, robotics for aerosols that then open latrr in the tech tree to powerful technolgies to be shared witht he world as soon  as possible.
#Use the news tab and telemetry tabs extensively since they will lead you to the high priority problem areas. The tech tree is also intermittently, useful since it will let you know how soona region will acquire technology showing if funding is worthwhile. You can be more judicious with the deeper drill tabs, but they are useful to indicate where the rescources and potenital for renewables will give most bang for your buck.

But there are a few neat rewards, if you can progress far enough in the game.  Interesting nanotechnology available at high levels to help clean up environmental problems, or quantum computers that you let you suddenly bring in a whole lot more money.

You are given the role as an underfunded leader of a global organisation set up to handle climate change and global warming. To do so, you are given a whole lot of options and a large chain of potential tasks you can tell your lackeys to do.

The first problem then is obvious, you have no idea what these tasks(Displayed as cards) do until you try them, and often only a vague idea of how they'll effect the various things they're supposed to effect. This will be frustrating, and may lead to you just restarting several times just to see what your policies are actually doing, and what they're effecting. Trial and error gameplay will be the first thing you notice, but that is only after you have spend a turn building offices all over, which you need before you can even see what policies and programs you can enact.
There is no real tech tree equivalent you can find that shows you what exactly you can do after building one of such offices, or what leads to what other things.
A real shame is that the game is excellent at hiding your options from you, and that it also hides the data behind a small tab in the top right. You can see practically everything you need to know about an area, but how your politices will effect it, or how these things interact with eachother is left completely behind the scenes. Only a few things you can do actually tell you the full extend of what they're going to be doing with the limited money you're spending on them.

In short, frustration. However, once you get over that and learn roughly what policies go where, you will find the game opens up to you, and lets you actually play it. And it is a much bigger game than it seems to be at first. Sure, it deals with global warming, and your goal is technically to stop it, but to focus purely on that is not going to help you. It's your end goal, while your organisation does not only have the authority, but also the responsibility to prevent wars, establish healthcare and education systems, manage economic growth, and fund technology. And all of these things are not told to you, and neither is it explained to you how to do them, you have essentially become the New World Order and everyone more experienced than you has died or quit. Indeed, one can ask what actual governments do in this game, and I so far haven't seen them bother with anything yet.

When they said it was all up to you to stop climate change, they meant EVERYTHING. Make the middle east a stable place, prevent the global economy from crashing, fund space missions, create anti-flooding and drought systems, establish healthcare all over the globe, stop deforestation, ease the use of fossile fuel, and many, many more things.
And to do this, you get barely a cent.
And even if you do know what you're doing, even a little, you will have trouble. There is very little margin for error, as a few mistakes will send Africa into a continent-wide civil war(As opposed to how it is right now with only parts of it being at war all the time), and you might start nuclear conflicts in Latin America if you don't personally check up on them every turn to make sure they aren't getting ready to use your nuclear power plants for weaponry. Fate of the World is difficult in part because there are a lot of factors involved, and you are told about none of them until shit has already hit the fan.

Make no mistake, it is a difficult game, but it is a great simulator. It simulates production of fossil fuels, transport, energy generation, industry, agriculture, economy, disasters and so much more. But it just doesn't tell you about any of this.
Aside from that, the moral lessons it tries to teach are questionable at best. As the only way so far that I have found to get close to succeeding every time I try is to start a genocide program targetting China, India, the Middle East, and if they keep complaining South Asia too.

Fate of the World teaches you(Or at least, me) that the only way foreward is to kill the asians(Except Japan), and to wipe the Middle East from the map. Africa is to be policed at all times and forcibly kept poor(but educating them) until technology exists to create emissions free power and industry for them.
The Americas and Europe are to be converted to renewable power, with media campaigns focussing on distracting them from the rest of the world. Japan and Oceania are pretty much empty as far as global population is concerned, so just give them a few defences against floods and occasionally some other protection if they need it.(To switch over ALL of Oceania's transports to electric instead of oil based costs the same as all of Europe or North America's for some reason)

Fate of the World is an interesting game that I would recommend for people who enjoy detailed simulators, and don't mind having to figure out everything themselves. But I would certainly not give it to kids.
Worth 10 bucks? I'd say so, if you are one of those people into simulators, or if you've seen someone play it and think you can do better",1441809299,1441809307,True,28,2,0.677181005477905273,0,True,False,False,False,

Fate of the World is a game where you have to save the world from disaster. It offers the player an onslaught of statistics for each major region of the world, and an interesting ""card"" mechanic for adminstering policies necessary to achieve mission objectives. 

This game was developed with input from Oxford University and Oxfam, so there is a strong factual basis to the whole affair. The missions are very tough, but each playthrough rewards the would-be GEO President with masses of insight on the challenges real world leaders might have in managing world affairs with limited resources in an unpredictible world.

My main gripe is the presentation of the statistics: it's not very thoughtfully laid out meaning lots of clicking between screens; better design would have solved this problem and made gameplay more enjoyable. The sheer volume of stats is a bit overwhelming to begin with, but after a few likely unsuccessful games, you get the hang of it. 

In my judgement, this is an excellent game. I'm not really into strategy games so don't know if it would appeal to the hardcore of that crowd, but for a generic gamer like me it's satisfyingly fun and also very informative.

It makes things very fun (if often hectic and complicated), in that you have a huge amount of complicated interactions to explore, and the actions available feel like they're genuinely interesting as a result.  It also makes the game educational -- while not everyone is going to agree with the precise model they used (or the research they based it on), it gives a good overview of the various environmental and resource-related issues facing the world today, and the general pros and cons of each of the numerous ways we have to address them.  Most of all, it captures how complicated these problems are; even with almost complete control over the world's policies, you're probably not going to be able to solve them without a lot of attention to detail and careful balancing.

The drawback to all this is that its heavy focus on the real world means that the game eventually gets fairly repetitive.  It comes with a number of scenarios, and there's a lot of room to try different options, but ultimately you're going to be facing the same general problem with the same general tools, and once you've figured out a working solution the game is pretty much ""solved"" -- some scenarios may be harder or easier, or might tweak your goals a bit, but since the overarching situation of the planet doesn't change much, it's more or less the same game each time -- it lacks the replay value of Civilization or similar games that let you explore alternate worlds.

Antes de nada, indicar que el juego se basa en escenarios, y todos ellos (salvo el de África, que es un tutorial) empiezan alrededor del 2020. Algunos terminan antes, otros terminan después, algunos son muy quisquillosos con salvar a todos los paises, y otros te dan más manga ancha. Pero en cualquier caso es un juego muy difícil.

Tenemos que manejar las finanzas de nuestra organización, decidir los agentes que situamos (o no) en cada región del planeta (ojo, que luego no se pueden retirar salvo que te los maten o te expulsen de ahí, y cuestan dinero), y una vez los tenemos, podemos jugar una carta con cada uno de ellos. Que no os engañe, aunque el juego se limite a turnos y cartas tiene muchas variables a tener en cuenta: seguridad del país, producción de recursos, consumo de recursos, tecnologías, medidas contra el cambio climático, proyectos a largo plazo (acabar con la deforestación y recuperar superficie boscosa), medidas humanitarias, especies en peligro de extinción... etc

Perderéis incontables veces hasta que le cojáis el truco (obviamente también representa lo mal que estamos y no queremos ver)

Hay varias formas de afrontar el juego, pero ninguna fácil. Y a menudo tendremos que perder turnos (cada uno son 5 años) en corregir problemas graves que no nos dejan sacar una región del agujero en el que está metida. A menudo, es mejor dejar a su suerte a muchas regiones para manejar los recursos adecuadamente. Sí, es duro admitirlo, pero necesitas su dinero para invertirlo en otras partes con el objetivo de salvar el mundo, no la región.

En mi caso, suelo dejar a su suerte a África entera, India, y China. El caso de China se debe a que la mejor forma de atajar el cambio climático sin depender de los aerosoles de geoingeniería después, consiste en convertir la industria de muchos paises a una industria libre de carbón, y después prohibir en todo el mundo la extracción de carbón. China es el país que más carbón consume y no se puede adaptar en un tiempo razonable (incluso tardando mucho mucho tiempo)

Original review:

Short summary:
This game is very interesting and induces the one more turn feeling. However, after many hours spent on this game, I've come to realise why I don't like it:
The lack of transparency around my actions.

More detailed explanation:
In other games, you're competing against other players (people or AI). Who wins is down to skill and chance.

However, in this game, you need to try various strategies to see what works best. If you play enough, you will be able to make good decisions and win the game. The only challenge is having to play the game a lot, to understand what works.

It'd have been better if the game told you what the consequences of your actions will be at the time that you're deciding what to do. It doesn't, and I'm now tired of looking at forums and wiki's to learn how much something will be affected by a choice I make.",1422202243,1475097186,True,0,0,0.511992454528808594,0,True,False,False,False,

The challenge is not a simple one. In charge of GEO, you are faced with all the global problems at the same time from floods and changing weather patterns caused by the global warming, economic crisis caused by the decreasing oil production rate and the social crisis caused by overpopulation. You tackle the problems by instituting 5-year plans. They are represented by issuing policies, i.e. ""playing cards"", each of which costs money and man power. And if you screw up, you will be lynched or disintegrated by a global nuclear war.

There are six card types, ranging from projects to several kinds of policies. Projects are special long-term actions that let you e.g. start space program or force people to go vegetarian. The policies allow you to do anything from e.g. constructing defenses against warming effects to using extreme measures of population control. These are used to affect the problems represented by charts and statistics available to those of you who want to see the concrete effects.

At first it feels easy to handle the problems. Then the economic crisis because of the lack of oil kicks in and you no longer have enough money to handle everything. Then you have to learn to prioritize or get lynched trying.

There are several scenarios to try out. The basic one, with several variations, is to try to survive until year 2200 battling the global warming and trying to save the humanity, but there's also a scenario where you're actually trying to destroy the world, if you're in a mood for some evil masterminding.

Mood and suspense are big things here, maintained by some awestrucking music and local news from around the world, listed by region. Interface needs a while to get used but most of the action happens anyway in choosing policies and judging, what you can afford and where to concentrate your efforts.

That is good.

The problems posed in this game are (mostly) real, and the solutions it offers seem plausible.
As some sort of leader of the world, you are tasked with saving it. Saving humanity from itself as it were. You will have to fight global warming, poverty and recession as you struggle to minimize climate change and human suffering (except in that one mission where you have to kill them all).
You play the game in a very board-game like fashion, you hire agents to carry out your decisions. These decisions are represented by cards, allowing each agent to play one card each turn. Individual agents are locked to world regions and can, if the situation gets bad, be lost.  Agents cost money to hire and cards cost money to play, and you have a very tight budget, therefore you must prioritise. Will you fight poverty and disease in Africa? Will you fight to reduce emissions in North America? Will you try to cool the political situation in the middle-east? All these things have to be done, but you cannot afford to do them all at once.

Of all the Simulation-games I've played throughout my life it is one of the deppest and most realistic simulations though.

You should definitely not play this game if you're afraid to start over again many times until you reach one of the desired endings. There is a reason that the 7th word in the description is ""dramatic"". You'll often run into bad ends or simply won't reach the neccessary mission goals in time. A great idea can backfire and make you think twice about adopting it the next time around.

The game presents choices for every region in ""cards"". This makes it look like a card-game to some people but it really isn't. I think the game desingers just tried to find a name to summarize ""Policies"", ""Research Programs"", ""Military Actions"", etc. and then they though ""Hey, those things are presented on stuff that looks like cards."" So they went with cards. Don't be turned away becaues you don't like card-games. FotW is not a card game and it might just aswell be called ""decisions""; There's no deck, no drawing of cards, etc, etc.

Play this game if:
-You like mental challenges
-You're not afraid to see our Earth go to hell (because of your decisions)
-You think Trial-and-Error can be fun

Don't play this game if:

Things are still playing out pretty much to the letter as this game predicted back in 2011.

----

I never thought I would enjoy this.

It's a world management simulator basically, though don't let that put you off.

What's great about playing it is that it uses a card based system which makes it have a fun gameplay element.

It is also brutally hard and has a learning curve like a cliff. I recommend watching a walkthrough of the game before you attempt anything beyond the first mission (tutorial).

But the main takeaway from the game is that it teaches you about the world, about the dangers of trying to deal with global warming, without actually trying to teach you anything.  It's amazing how that works out.

I first played it early 2011 and as time moves on, I continue to see things happening in the world that I already knew about due to this game.  It blows my mind.  It's also a real shame the world seems to be so ignorant towards global warming and the future of not only life on earth, but also the planet itself.

This is a must try for everyone, no matter what type of gamer you are.  Even if you don't really like slow paced strategy games, you might enjoy how it unknowingly teaches you about the dangers of the future, and how painfully hard it is to manage the world.
