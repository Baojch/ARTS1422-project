This badly made GameMaker Studio template job is a craptastic pixeltrash platformer with a loose ""samurai"" theme featuring a lot of hack and slash as well as your usual wall jumping, double jumping, hazard avoiding, and there's a minor ""adventure"" game element.  None of these individual factors is implemented remotely well. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

PC gamers will be insulted by the demand from the developer that a console peasant children's toy controller should be used, despite this being on PC.  Developers should try to be aware which platform they're developing for, and must never, under any circumstances dictate to gamers how their games are to be experienced.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the GameMaker Studio construction kit/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset favoured by amateur developers as it's cheap and requires little in the way of development skill, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  GameMaker Studio is most commonly used to make retro pixel shovelware and cash grabs.

A strong argument can be made that construction kits like GameMaker Studio should never be used to make games for profit, as the ""developer"", Blaze Epic has done here.  These construction kits are intended to teach people some of the basic principles of game development, and to make small demos to pass around with friends.  They're not intended to replace to actual work of real, professional game developers.  So it's inappropriate when amateurs try to use these for profit, without any actual, real game development effort taking place.  This doesn't result in products that have any real meaningful value for gamers.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Shin Samurai Jazz didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for finishing the first tutorial level, trivial to get, but less than 12 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

The poor quality of this game is also reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 8 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Shin Samurai Jazz is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 9,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

Shin Samurai Jazz is a platformer that takes a lot of inspiration from Ninja Gaiden, but tries to focus more on the platforming aspect, rather than the combat. The result is an okay platformer that occasionally has a few enemies.

The platforming was the only real highlight, and it was mostly a highlight just because of how different it is from Ninja Gaiden. You get air dashes which essentially allow you to fly when combined with attacks and jumps.

The combat mechanics feel awkward and unnatural. I was unable to find where my health was displayed, so I was always unsure how close I was to death. Enemy design is decent, but ultimately underwhelming. Enemies fit into the typical genre archetypes, but nothing more.

The soundtrack was also pretty poor. The music in the game ranges from being so generic you don’t even notice it, to being weird and unpleasant to listen to. Overall, it’s not the worst attempt at a modern Ninja Gaiden, but it was still a pretty weak game.

So, I don't have that context and it seems that some people who were a fan of the first were disappointed by this follow up. With that said, I, having never played the original, found this game to be really charming. In this little game, you play a sort of Noir-Samurai who fights off criminals, ghosts, and monsters. Beyond that, I am really not sure what the story is. It is more of an excuse for the game. Which is fine, I have played plenty of game like that. Though, this one didn't really seem to try and cover that up at all and can come off nonsensical, but beyond that, fine.

It is a retro-styled-game in full force. It didn't simply take the aesthetic of older games (which it did perfectly), but instead designed the game to feel like something you might have gotten from the NES or SNES. Granted there is some hindsight, but had it come out back then, it would be considered a cult-classic. Buuuuuut, with that said, it didn't come out back then so there are definitely criticisms to be made. But, in my opinion, none of the criticisms I have really break the game, but are things to think about for the future.

Let me start off by saying that the controls are fine. Some people think they are bad and clunky but I didn't have trouble with them. I did find it silly that so many buttons where mapped to the same commands but that isn't really an issue. Once I found the set up that was most comfortable to me, I didn't think about it that much. Though I do enjoy the controls, there were points in certain levels that I found it hard to nail certain things as perfectly as I wanted to, but that could easily be on me more than the developers.

There are two gameplay mechanics in this game. Platforming and combat. Combat is the simplest, so I will start there. If I am to be honest, it leaves a little to be desired. I ended up accepting it as it was, especially considering the other side of the coin was a lot more interesting, but there was almost no real layers to it. You have one button to attack and you kind of just hit enemies until they fall down. This wouldn't be such a big step back if the enemies had a way to work this style of combat into something interesting, like dodging or better blocking. That would at least make you think and cause you to perhaps use some of the platforming mechnics to work around them. But they just approach you, trying to strike and most of the time they would only get a couple of hits in before they die. Now, I make it sound like this is a horrible part of the game but sometimes it can still be fun as there are points where you get ganked by a mass of enemies and you have to try and work out a way to get rid of them all before they over whelm you and there even some enemies that float and shoot projectiles which makes good use of the ability for your character to jump and hang in the air while attacking. Though, again, it is just approaching and attacking with no real challenge otherwise. I wouldn't consider myself disappointed though until I reached the bosses. 

This is where the game goes from simple to just unsatisfying. Bosses are not good or interesting. They are just enemies which you need to hit more to be able to kill. There are no impressive attacks, interesting movement patterns, or anything to be afraid of to be honest. They are just not bosses. I don't know what else to say on that. If they had been more interesting, this game could have really elevated itself. Beyond that, the only other thing I have left to comment on is the fact that you have no visible health bar or counter which would have been nice since you can take an amount of hits but you have no idea where you stand. Sure You can figure it out through counting out how many times you can take a hit then remembering that but that isn't exactly fun. Having a symbol of somekind to see where you stand would have been nice but it didn't exactly kill the game for me.

Now, on to the interesting part. The very thing that the developers were obviously more focused on: The Platforming. And honestly, the platforming is a lot of fun in an oldschool type of way. The mechanics in the controls for platforming are a lot of fun. You jump a good distance and cling to walls which is super useful. Eventually at some point you find out you can dash (both on ground and in the air) which brings the game to another level in terms of layers. The game itself has an overworld which you can jump around in as you walk along the sidewalk. You can enter certain buildings; some being small on the inside where you more or less just talk to NPCs while others are where all the platforming really is. The levels themselves can range from entertainingly tricky to rage-quittingly specific. For the most-part, you will find yourself enjoying the levels where either you just have to get from one end to another or have to travel back and forth to either get a key or press a switch to open a door. This is can be addictive for the most part, but then there are some levels that become more of a chore and challenge your perception of whether it is challenging or just artificially difficult.

How? One word: Spikes. I am not saying it is unreasonably difficult to where it borders on tedious. But there are levels where I know exactly what I need to do but the timing has to be as such that it takes away the enjoyment of the mechanics themselves. It does so with spikes. Now, these spikes don't kill you instantly. Which is good because there is a comical amount of them in places like the mall and office buildings. Much like fighting, you can take some hits before dying which is great. The problem comes when you need to do something like jump, dash, and jump again to get under and around a pillar, but the pillar has spikes at the bottom. So, what happens is that you hit the spike and it will take away your ability to do the proper actions with any sort of effectiveness. I don't want to paint a bad picture like this is such a game breaking aspect. It really isn't. Because there are plenty of pillars with spikes on the bottom and I get passed it but then there will be a room where it is placed as such that it is in the perfect place for it to be just annoying. And honestly it wouldn't even be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that as soon as your toe touched the border of the screen with no platform, you instantly die. There isn't any slack which really is the enemy here and less so the spikes if I am to truly address what was bothering me. I personally would liked if at least your legs where allowed to sink through a little but maybe that is just me.

Also, there are some rooms where I am not even sure how you are supposed to get around the spikes so I just jumped into them with a hope of reaching a clear space before they killed me. I mean, it is nice that I can survive them but I don't like designs where you have to hurt yourself to proceed. At least not in a retro styled games based on an area where that kind of idea was unthinkable. 

But, with that said, the platforming is still a lot of fun and it is nice the kind of back and forth movements it can create. A big cheat to winning over my heart in a game is making me feel like a ninja which there is a good deal of in this game. Especially after completing those more tedious levels.

The music itself is good. Not the most mind-blowing in this era where Soundtracks can elevate your game to legend status, but a lot more interesting than the older games that it is imitating and something that makes the game easier to get through.

Overall, I recommend the game. I got it free but I think it is fair to pay 99 cents for it. If you want something that will REALLY remind you of old school platforming than this is perfect. If you are looking for something particularly smooth, then it might be a little rough around the edge.

In [i]Shin Samurai Jazz[/i] you're a ronin, a kind of samurai, and some odd people are assigning you assassination jobs.

It is a bit confusing though - I missed the reason why you do their bidding. I guess it doesn't matter that much anyway.

[h1]Awkward fighting[/h1]

Combat is too simple to be good.

There's adequate enemy variety. Some of them just recklessly walk towards him and hurt by their touch. Others have swords or long necks (there are ""demons"") or they shoot fireballs etc.

The enemy AI, except for the reckless rushers, is a bit silly. They usually simply come close, then stand there waiting for you to act. Fine, the fireball ladies be sending their fireballs, but other foes are bizarrely passive-aggressive, just looming over there.

Only if you move close enough will they start swinging their swords or necks or whatevers. You can usually block their strikes with the defense stance.

Then if you swing at them before they have a chance to act, they'll get stun-locked. Smashing attack then easily kills them, even with its slight knockback. Only groups are mildly dangerous.

[h1]Platforming[/h1]

Because of the utterly mediocre combat, the core is actually in platforming.

Ronin can double-jump, dash forward, and after-in-air-dash-mega-jump, effectively allowing triple-jumping. So that's pretty lot of maneuverability. And you need it too, which is neat!

There are spikes everywhere, some of them of the dreaded retracting-reappearing type. Darts are shot from the walls, and enemies spawn in groups to surround you at certain spots.

Sounds adequately difficult? Well, it could be.

But our dear noir protagonist can take so much beating (and maybe even regenerate?) that the spikes and darts (that only do a bit of damage) are quite harmless if you can avoid hitting too many (like six) in a row, in a single scene.

It's hard to assess your health exactly because the game's missing a visible health bar or other indication of damage.

Also, the sequences are slow: darts (and spikes when applicable) shoot out only every 4 seconds or so. And you can hug the spiky walls if needed to replenish the double-jump. So it's suddenly, counter-intuitively, easy.

Only the insta-deaths due to falling off the level into the endless pits are actually dangerous and force one to learn the controls, including triple-jumping.

Fortunately, the levels become moderately challenging by the end, which is cool. They're never [i]really[/i] difficult though. And once you get the controls, they are easily beaten on the first try even if not unscathed.

[h1]Some fun, some issues[/h1]

The graphics are attractively retro - I liked the artstyle. Music and sounds are fine but nothing special.

Controls are slick and responsive for what they do (I played with gamepad), so I don't get the issue with controls that some other reviewers have.  However, you can't edit the controls, neither for keyboard nor gamepad.

Each chapter begins with a game of ""finding the level"". That's good for pacing and I enjoyed all the weird, ominous dialogue. For once there are lots of people on the streets in a game, like expected of a city.

But finding the level can be tricky because there are not always enough hints on where to go, so you are forced to try every door to see whether you can enter. It's a short but tedious operation.

[h1]Good or not?[/h1]

I beat the game in a single hour, probably dying less than 10 times the whole time. That's a feat required for each chapter separately if you wish to get all achievements.

So I deem it rather easy as a platformer.

But maybe that's just because lately I've been playing [i]Super Meat Boy[/i] striving for no deaths: Take my assessment of the difficulty with [i]a pinch of meaty tears.[/i]

For its price ($1) its content is adequate. But it's got issues, and it's too easy because of the astonishingly durable protagonist. And the story's odd. I'd give it a mixed review if possible. Still, I had fun, so it gets an upvote.

In reality it's a mismatched game, adventure, sword combat and platforming, it only succeeds at one of them:

As an adventure, the quests are rather linear, the map is small, and dialogue is minimal.

Combat is very simplified and slow, tends to get in the way of platforming, because it stops you to grind some enemies. so simple that there isn't much strategy to those encounters, there are a few bosses in this game, all of them easily beaten by button mashing.

As a platformer i really like it. Fast, responsive, intuitive. It feels great. 

I wouldn't say it's highly recommended. As soon as you get used to the controls you will noticed there a few variations to the level design. I guess that's acceptable since the game is rather short.

But I'd REALLY love to see a speedrun of this game!

Samurai Jazz is, in a way, a hymn to traditional games that goes beyond what we may be used to: not only it looks retro, it also feels retro in terms of timing-related difficulty spikes. 

Following the foosteps of samurai_jazz, you control a beret-wielding samurai that must slice through its enemies. Unlike the original samurai_jazz, however, this game plays like a typical platformer with jumping at its core. Expect the precise timings of 'jumping' and 'dashing' to be your main cause of trouble from this game, but also the most exciting part to look at. 

Ironically enough, this switch in gameplay mechanics actually works for the better, when compared to its predecessor: you won't accidentally access some areas by mistake and there aren't that many issues caused by perspective, for you only go right, let and jump.

My main issue with this game, though, is not the fact that it's too difficult or that it seems cheap: it is, indeed, challenging and it should have autosaves for each time you change a room, but that sets the game apart, in my opinion. Rather, it's the fact that, sometimes, it feels like there are either bugs regarding jumping mechanics or something that wasn't explained to begin with. Right at the end of the game, for example, after sliding through a wall, I could jump, dash and then jump again. But some other times, I could only dash and jump. I can assume this is a bug, and it's a big game-breaking in my opinion, but not that serious. There seems, however, to be a way to jump higher which I never managed to  completely understand, and that was REALLY important at the end of the game: I believe it was caused by jumping while pressing the trigger for dashing, but I never managed to fully grasp it. It might've been just dumb luck!

I had another major issue concerning the interface. Like the first game, one might have difficulty setting all objects you can interact with apart. I felt this to be the most troublesome in a stage containing many gates that seemed well shut and, at the end, only one of them could be accessed to at a time. I had to watch a walkthrough to pass this part of the game, and since timing skill is the main focus of the game, this type of situation doesn't benefit the game itself. It just seems cheap!

I do still recommend this game, though, and it seems more polished than the original samurai_jazz. And for the price of a buck, I can still see Shin Samurai Jazz getting a cult following around speedrunners.",1499019505,1499019505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Summary: Shin Samurai Jazz is a platform-adventure game. It combines the likes of film noir and samurai cinema, presenting them with 8-bit graphics, an electro-jazz soundtrack, and a comic/manga-like style creating a unique atmosphere. Unlike its predecessor, samurai_jazz, Shin Samurai Jazz features jumping mechanics inspired by chuunori, an old technique used in kabuki theatre to give the illusion of flying. It's combat mechanics consist of hacking and slashing with the ability to juggle enemies and perform mid-air combinations, also inspired by chuunori. While the adventure elements remain intact, the puzzles are more complex with varied level designs and enemy placements/attack patterns that make use of the game's mechanics.

You think the combat would give it a Ninja Gaiden feel, but it doesn't. Combat only serves to occasionally offer you a cheap death after a period of tough (but repetitive and built around the awful controls) platforming. Half the time you want to jump away from a wall you turn right back into it. The other half your character just falls straight down off the wall because the controls appear to have never been actually considered. I wouldn't be surprised if the developer had never even actually played this game and kept rehashing particularly bad super meat boy levels that he never actually tested. Either way, this is unrepentant trash that is only difficult because 90% of the platforming is wall jumping off spiked walls with ever decreasing non-spiked surface area. This would be less offensive if the controls for wall jumping were good. They aren't.

I wanted to like this game, but even for a retro title, the combat is unacceptable. The soundtrack is nice yes, but it doesnt make up for lack of depth in the gameplay. The menu is hellish, and the graphics leave lots to be wanted. There are many retro games that just look ""nice"", this isn't one of them.

The level design is 90% filler, and there is one obstacle that, while cool, the game uses over and over and over again (which is to use dash to pass under and obstacle, followed by a double jump into a higher wall). Aside from this, which is a good use of the game's mechanics (though overused to death), the rest is just a way of prolonging the game long enough to be worth money (?)... I mean, the whole game consists of going into several buildings to key a key to the next, to get a key to the next, to get a key to the next, to finally get into the building you wanted to in the first place.

There a part in a mall where there are like 10 different door that you need to try out whenever you get a new key. It's absolutely pointless. Especially, as I mentioned, when the game has one good trick that it simply uses everywhere.

The enemies are varied enough, but quickly get redundant when you find the strategy. The combat isn't bad, but it's too outdated to keep up. It's mostly about keeping your distance, and timing attacks to keep enemies stunned.

I also don't really understand why the music gets so much praise. It certainly has a very definity style, but it's mostly elevator music. And it doesn't really play along with the game. It's just background elevator music...


Not much else to say. The platforming isn't bad, in places, but it could use far more variety. And you start with every ability from the start, so the game can't really build different sections for when you have only x or y ability, and them build up from there.

as good as the first but most certainly different.
the first game (NOT THIS GAME) was presented in 2D with the slant shift perspective and every level had a sense of depth. the player was able to move on each ground plane and climb up or jump down to another one; AKA a beat-em-up, with platforming/evasion elements.
THIS GAME is instead, a 2d platformer, with a perspective most notable for its use in ninja gaiden. so somehow it manages to have the feel and atmosphere of the first game (samurai_jazz), and a totally new game-play style. the trouble is mainly in wall platforming this time around instead of perfect combat timing.
this game certainly continues the saga of the first one, and the game-play is spectacular. instead of a guerrilla samurai style, the game is more quick paced arial get aways than combat, so more ninja than samurai.
its not a deal breaker, but i expected this to be some kind of meta narrative clue; it being the kind of clues that both samurai jazz games throw out. i expected it to be like ""you are actually dead"", or ""the crazy demon magic in the air has been affecting you""... the story is still good, better than the first,  (no spoilers) but the ending is just weird. it cant be the ""hero saves the world"" good one, and it cant be the ""we're totally screwed and its all your fault"" ending either. it just comes out of no where, like someone completed a masterpiece of GBC style game-play then they...",1459989664,1494394734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What this is is a precision platformer mixed with a really bad beat'em up. Like, the combat is aaaawfuuuul. Stunlocks everywhere. Soooo many stunlocks. Way too many enemies. Generally pathetic bosses. Just all around unpleasant. The combat basically ruins the experience for me because I hate half the game and like the other half. But the combat is what kills me more, so I have to experience it more. 

The platforming here is fairly solid, it makes good use of your character's movement abilities and it tends to be fair for the most part, though there are a few questionable moments near the end of the game, and the projectiles that pop up at times are kind of cruddy additions to the platforming system. But yeah. There's a small sewer sub-area that I find really dumb because clearing the platforming there requires the use of spamming attack to break your fall and gain more horizontal distance, which is really clunky. There's a moment in the final level where you really can't avoid taking damage because a jump is far too high to be made so you have to use knockback from spikes to get up higher. And the very last platforming room has a tedious combat section followed by a sequence of jumps, one of the basically pixel-perfect, that's reeeeally annoying. But on the whole it's good platforming, yeah.

The presentation kinda sucks, the visuals are all reused from the first game, as is the soundtrack, and everything looks very samey and kind of bland. Not a huge deal but a minor nitpick nonetheless.

The game's actually pretty decently long for its price, took me around two hours to beat. Though a small part of that was the game crashing causing me to have to replay the entire first world, which was less than fun.

One of the most telling signs, in my opinion at least, that a game designer is doing something really right is when I can spot his or her fingerprints immediately on a game. Eric Chahi's fingerprints are all over Another World and Heart of Darkness, for example, but one can feel his presence in Flashback's DNA, too, even if it's clear that the game wasn't his own work. Jordan Mechner's cinematic eye is similarly unmistakable, and elements of it can be felt most powerfully on another game from this author...but Larry Stover (aka Blaze Epic) rightly holds his place as a game visionary of his own, and his titles, though influenced by Mechner, have a distinct flavor of their own, and can be recognized by his fingerprints as readily as Chahi's and Mechner's titles can be recognized by theirs. 

If Mechner is Cheb Khaled, then Stover is Rachid Taha, a little wilder, a little earthier, a little more raw and visceral, and a little less constrained by form. The ponderousness of the flesh evident in the inertia of Mechner's unnamed Karateka and Prince is remembered but not heeded. Blaze Epic's games feature protagonists that soar, float, defy gravity, and whose true capabilities grow apparent only when you silence the empirical ""traffic cop"" chasing after them, demanding they stop making a mockery of physics. These games have flow, have a tight, bespoke timing and range of motion that would remind one of a slightly less punishing Ninja Gaiden (the NES version in particular), and a large part of their reward sets in once you enter their ""zone,"" and flow with the almost-flying protagonist. The controls of the game feel strange and alien until you learn to move with them, and then you're Zatoichi for a glorious moment.

Blaze Epic's games share a few common qualities; they're all finesse-driven platformers with a decidedly retro graphics style. (I taste SMS influence in particular, as the Jump/Boxer cover art suggests.) Significant, small differences tune the physics and flow of each title, but there will be much jumping, and the games' magic comes from learning what one can do with jumps. There will be many frustrating deaths. There will be many ""missed it by that much"" moments. Seeing the next screen is a palpable reward. For all that the simple combat controls seem, at first glance, to be button-spammingly simple, success in the game is much more about finding rhythms than rapidly hammering triggers. The controls are frustratingly literal in the way anyone fond of third-generation consoles will immediately recognize and love-while-hating. 

Having set the stage, let me tell you why Shin Samurai Jazz is my favorite of these titles.

The world of Shin Samurai Jazz is a noir pulp novel steeped in Jazz Age chic, with a rather Moby-esque low-key electrojazz soundtrack that anchors one in tones of rainy streets at night, distant music and laughter, secrets and mysteries. The atmosphere drips, and the mixture of goons and yokai encountered, with their markedly different combat styles, keep the fights interesting and particularly varied. Yes, you can try to power through by hammering the attack button, but learning your deceptively varied move set and employing it wisely has proven to be a far more useful strategy, in my experience. Once you really get the hang of dashing back and forth, dropping in and out of stance, and hurling enemies aloft for airborne slicing and dicing while taking advantage of the chuunori-inspired jump-and-dash physics, you'll appreciate just how much variety there can be in a one-attack-button game, and how much of a difference learning your moves makes.

The jump-puzzle elements work much the same way; learning your moveset, and slipping ""into the zone"" with the game's physics, is instrumental. You'll practice double-jumps, jump-and-dash, wall rebounding, wall climbing and sliding, and folks who just rush in and spam the jump button will find some of the trickier levels quite daunting. Understanding one's range of moves, and their relative advantages, is key. That's true, to a degree, in every game, but Shin Samurai Jazz elevates this to a real brightly-polished art. For all that you have a limited number of buttons and moves to worry about, knowing them, and knowing when and how to use them effectively, plays a large role in the game. So many ""retro"" action-jump-and-run titles focus so heavily on timing and pixel-perfect placement that they neglect to reward good mastery of one's range of options, and good planning, aside from pitch-perfect execution. Whether Shin Samurai Jazz is maddening or simply satisfyingly tricky is, in my experience at least, more a question of how well you speak its language.

Jumping, wall-rebounding, and clever timing play a role in many Blaze Epic games. If you find you'd like simpler combat and more of those deathtrap jumping levels, the Ninjahtic series will probably make you quite happy, and if you'd like even more of a nod to Mechner, The Way Of The Pixelated Fist is his most recognizable love letter to Karateka and Prince of Persia. Shin Samurai Jazz, however, remains my favorite of the titles, for its compelling atmosphere and flavor, and for its surprisingly versatile and mood-reinforcing moveset.

I enjoyed the NES Ninja Gaiden back in the day, quite a bit. Shin Samurai Jazz brings back much of what I loved about it, while fixing a few of the things I really didn't, like the very trouble-prone wallgrab and climb.

Finally, I don't normally discuss price as a factor, but the dollar-or-two pricing scheme of Blaze Epic's games really bumps them to must-owns, if the retro action-platformer with third-gen-console-style difficulty appeals to you. This one or Ninjahtic would both make excellent introductions to the Blaze Epic game family, and as fond of I am of Ninjahtic, I'd personally give Shin Samurai Jazz a recommendation over it, as I think it expresses not just the game mechanics, but the thematic and atmospheric je-ne-sais-quoi, that makes Blaze Epic titles so lovely.

You make a name for yourself as a creator by sticking your neck out, owning a ""flavor"" and saying, ""This is what I'm about."" Blaze Epic's games have quite a recognizable tone and character, and of course, tastes will differ, and this little storm of third-gen-consoles and remixed-Japan will not appeal to everyone. They'll surely appeal to some, though, myself emphatically counted among their numbers, and if you're even remotely curious as to whether they're for you, this is a splendid straight-into-the-deep-end plunge into the heart of Blaze Epic's catalog.",1436837108,1436837369,True,13,2,0.61753237247467041,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-there is one important movement trick beyond the double-jump and air dash: if you hold the dash key and jump WHILE STILL HOLDING DASH, you will jump even higher in the air (and you will also often still be able to do your second jump of the double-jump).

A lot of indie games these days go the ""Retro"" route because it is the ""In thing"" or  considered ""easy"" but I don't find that to be the case here. This game was clearly crafted by someone with a great admiration for classic game design and personally I think it feels right. Authentic, if you will. If you appreciate that than by all means give the game a shot. 

At first play the controls will feel a bit stiff but give it some time. Once you get a handle on things you will be flying around the screen deftly avoiding spikes as you make your way through the architectural death traps and easily take out groups of foes. I had no issues at all with the controls once I grasped how everything worked. Learning when to jump and when to air dash is all part of the fun and when it clicks you will be begging for more. 

Combat is somewhat simple but offers enough to keep it fresh I think. You have one attack button and pressing that in succession performs a basic combo that can knock some enemies back. I loved that enemy bodies will damage anyone in their path. It was especially fun to knock an enemy into another and send them flying off the platform into spikes. You can also perform a dash attack by simply dashing and attacking and this too will knock some foes back. Finally you can hold up and press attack to send an enemy into the air for a nice juggle combo and yes, his falling body can smack into other enemies. And that is about it for the most part. Like many games of the 8bit era, a lot of the combat comes down to learning a foe's pattern and then putting that knowledge to use. Many times enemies will be placed in ways to make you rethink your typical strategies and keep you on your toes. While we aren't talking about a super in-depth combat system I feel that it never wears out its welcome and is far better than it may seem at first glance.

That being said, the bulk of the gameplay is  definitely the spike-filled platforming. You will be using every trick up your sleave to make it through some of these death traps and later stages can be quite brutal. You will die and a few may frustrate you but I never once felt the game was unfair. When I died it was because I wasn't good enough to complete that section not because of something designed to fool you. These platforming segments are well designed and there are no surprises. It may ask a bit of your skill but you can leave your luck at home. The one complaint I'd levy at the game is found within these platforming sections but since it is consistant I can't really dock the game for it. Still, I felt I should mention it. Should your feet dip below the bottom of the screen you will die, regardless if a well timed double jump or dash could have saved you. This accounted for most of my deaths but again, it is designed this way and is consistant so once I got used to it it wasn't as big of an issue. 

A smaller porttion of the gameplay is the adventuring segments. This generally involves entering buildings and recieving cryptic hints on where to head next. Get a hamburger bun so the restaurant can make a burger for you to give a guy who will trade you his key. It is really a minor diversion meant to break up the flow of the game and keep it feeling fresh. I love that nothing is spelled out for you but there is nothing really all that taxing here with few opportunities to actually get lost. It is within these sections that you can save your game. Simply enter the market and talk to the worker. You have three slots.

A quick snippet on the difficulty. As I said, it is tough but fair. I've heard complaints of checkpoints being too far apart but I don't find that to be the case. Each room is designed to be completed in one go and dying at any point in a room puts you at the start of that room. That there are infinite retries and it starts instantly upon death with no waiting period cuts back on any feelings of anger or tedium. Look at it like a run in one of the Trials games.  If you are the type to save state your way through emulated NES games though, the game may seem cruel. If you were used to gaming on the actual hardware back when it was current, well, you might find the infinite retries a bit easy. Either way, I stand by my assessment that the difficutly is high but fair.

The music is great and very relaxing. It suits the game well and compliments the action by offering a nice mellow atmosphere when you are risking death constantly. The look of the game is either amazing or putrid depending on your outlook. I love it. It really captures that 8bit feel  and the design is right up my alley. My only issue is that the spikes can somethimes blend into the background due to color choices.

Just want to touch on the controls for a second. I highly recommend using a 360 pad as I can't imagine some of these areas on a keyboard. The main menu strangely is controlled by the number keys on the keyboard. Once you get in-game you can perform everything else via the controller save for...saving... which is handled via the numbers as well. If you do not have a 360 controller you may want to avoid the game. I can't in good faith recommend it on a keyboard.

Overall, I had a great time with this title and will be buying the dev's other games right away. There is plenty of game here for an absurdly low price. If you have even an inkling that you would like this than I urge you to give it a shot. I've paid far more for far less...",1434604061,1479950000,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,
