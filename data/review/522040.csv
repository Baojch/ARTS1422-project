I was able to beat it just under a hour, in 57 mins specifically. It finds its own eeriness and awkwardness in its aesthetics while also has a pretty music selection. However, its bullet hell gameplay loop, while fun, obviously does not evolve much (but has a fair skill ceiling, combat gets faster and more agressive as you progress) and it does not include exploration outside the locations you must visit in order to collect hearts (after you heal the people you interact with) and perhaps collecting some chests. Chests are usually hidden in rooms that seemingly unreachable (blocked by objects) but if you simply walk up on a few of them you'll notice they are actually red herrings and you are able to move through some of the objects/walls. I find that lame but again in a 1 hour game it's barely a sin. The game does not get much creative in dialogues as it also does not in its gameplay loop. I find it kinda disappointing given these types of Retro RPGs (although it's really hard to call Princess Remedy a RPG) heavily relies on character interaction through three dimensional & heartfelt dialogues and a strong script overall. Being able to date with the people you cure therefore also being able to recruit them is a cool idea but their skills are usually lame and it's just another very simplistic game mechanic.

However, the boss fights are very difficult even playing on normal difficulty and the sequel has tons of boss fights. So I can't imagine playing on ""Death"" mode. 

Regardless, I had a blast playing this and I hope Ludosity makes a third game to this series. 
Although, I did not beat the game as I keep dying on very last part of the mega boss tower fight which is super frustrating but I played enough to get an overall opinion of this great game. 

Therefore, I would recommend you buy this as it's much more fun and improvement over the first game and definitely worth $5 or even cheaper on steam sale. 9/10.

Tytuł zaprezentowany jest w bardzo old-schoolwym wręcz nostalgicznym dla wiekowych już graczy stylu, który tworzy nieziemską atmosferę i daje możliwości na przyjemne spędzenia czasu.

[i]Mała dygresja:[/i]

1. Gra nie jest długa można ją całą przejść w niecała godzinę, choć wszystko będzie zależeć od waszej zręczności w posługiwaniu się kontrolerem.

2. Jeżeli tytuł was zainteresuje to zachęcam by poczekać na wyprzedaż, gra choć dobra to cena jest absurdalna biorąc pod uwagę oferowaną  zawartość tego tytułu.

[h1]Ale do rzeczy:[/h1]

Jak już zdołałem wspomnieć na samym początku tej recenzji mamy tym razem do czynienia z tytułem z gatunku gier akcji, który zabiera gracza do tajemniczego świata fantasy w którym za pośrednictwem tytułowej księżniczki będzie podróżował po świecie w celu ratowania jej mieszkańców od tajemniczych niebezpieczeństw i dolegliwości które ich trapią.

Cała rozgrywka polega na eksploracji świata, napotykaniu postaci niezależnych i leczeniu ich z posiadanych szkodliwych dolegliwości. Leczenie przybierać będzie postać potyczki w której księżniczka będzie walczyła z przeróżnymi  stworzeniami – jeżeli je pokonamy to osoba dotknięta chorobą wyzdrowieje. 

[h1]Dalej:[/h1]

Co ważne każda występująca postać w tym świcie posiada specjalne zdolności, w sytuacji kiedy postanowimy jej pomóc, wyleczymy ją, wtedy będzie ona skłonna przyłączyć się do naszej wędrówki i dodatkowo podzielić się tymi zdolnościami z nami – co urozmaici i wspomoże nam w walce z coraz to silniejszymi przeciwnikami. Należy jednak pamiętać że w naszej wędrówce może towarzyszyć tylko jedna postać niezależna, wybierając inna postać tracimy dodatkowe umiejętności / zdolności walki, które posiadaliśmy wcześniej.

Gra stopniowo zwiększa swój poziom trudności, daje możliwość walki z jednostkami typu Boss, które stanowią nie lada wyzwanie a ich pokonanie jest bardzo satysfakcjonujące. Na mapie również możemy spotkać ukryte „znajdzki” skrzyneczki z elementami podnoszącymi ogólne statystyki naszej postaci, definiowane kolorowymi znaczkami – warto je zbierać i szukać po całej mapie.

Powyższa produkcja jest bardzo przyjemna w odbiorze, sterowanie banalnie proste choć w czasie walki będzie to bardziej zręcznościowa zabawa w której wynik będzie zależny od umiejętności samego gracza – jeżeli polegniecie w walce, nic straconego, pojawicie się w tym samym miejscu i będziecie mogli spróbować ponownie.

[h1]Podsumowanie:[/h1]

Princess Remedy In A Heap of Trouble to drobny, krótki,  lecz również bardzo przyjemny tytuł z gatunku gier akcji, swoista old-schoolowa odskocznia od bardziej rozbudowanych growych  tytułów.

That should illustrate the degree to which I was ready to enjoy [i]Princess Remedy 2[/i]. I was shocked by how outright bad this is in certain respects.

[u]Writing[/u]
This is the very first time I've encountered a game where I've honestly wondered if the writing was done by an AI. A significant amount of the in-game text is devoted to puzzling jokes about an NPC which are never funny any time they are encountered, and they just keep showing up. But at least I can look at them and think, ""Ah, the author intended these to be funny."" The jokes delivered by NPCs post-healing exist in an uncanny valley where I'm not even sure if they were supposed to be jokes at all. It's just a random bit of monologue that is maybe related to the character's quirk in some way. To make my perspective clear, I found the writing in the first game genuinely funny throughout, while here it's flat to a baffling degree.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
[i]Princess Remedy 1[/i] is often called a bullet-hell even though it isn't (except for maybe the final boss). This game leans into that descriptor far enough that it reveals weaknesses in its design. There just isn't enough precision in either the movement or the aiming to make navigating a field of bullets fun or interesting. I spent several of the boss fights actively trying to figure out the size of my own hitbox because it just isn't clear. There are also some miscellaneous changes that don't make much sense to me, such as changing the passive healing of the first game to a ""drain"" effect which is so slight in its impact that it might as well not even be in the game. Also, the stat growth feels so much more planned around that when you accumulate upgrades it doesn't even feel like they contribute anything because future enemies/encounters have been juiced to a matching degree. The ""dating"" system by which you can alter your subweapon is fine, although I rarely wanted anything other than the default flask weapon anyway.

I guess I should close with the things I did like about the game. It still emulates the visual style of a ZX Spectrum game, and this time around the visuals actually scale to match your chosen resolution, so that's a plus. Otherwise I can't recommend this at all, when the first game is better in basically every way and is free to boot.",1635637655,1635637655,False,2,1,0.505434811115264893,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Overall Rating - Seriously Flawed ★★☆☆☆[/h1]

[h1]First Impressions[/h1] 
It's not very often that I'll play a free game on Steam, but once in a great while I'll find one that interests me. I wound up playing Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt (PR1) in 2016, and after getting a copy of its sequel, knew I'd have to tackle it at some point as well. Princess Remedy 2: In a Heap of Trouble (PR2) was released two years after its free counterpart, so the developers had an opportunity to make a game worth being purchased. Were they successful, or is Remedy in a world of trouble? 


[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 
For those familiar with the first game, PR2 is going to be quite the callback, because it's basically the same game all over again. You'll speak with ill NPCs, which bring up small environments with blocks and enemies, but instead of a Bomberman like section, it's an overhead shooter. Some of the obstructions will be indestructible, but most of them will break after being shot for a few seconds. Each successfully healed person will increase your HP, which is also necessary in order to challenge the bosses as they have minimal heart requirements before you can fight them. Defeating a boss will either increase the power of your projectile or how many you fire at once, so you certainly notice the difference after beating them. 

Along the way, you'll open treasure chests and seek out secret items that'll increase how much HP you regain from hitting enemies and how many times you can use your ability. Regaining your health is incredibly helpful, so you'll always appreciate getting HP stealing upgrades. The ability you'll use depends on who you select to bring along on your journey, with the effects ranging from defensive ones that'll refill your health to offensive moves like laser beams. When speaking with an NPC who could join you, it'll tell you the name of the ability, but that won't necessarily convey its effect. If you don't like the one you have now, you'll just have to try another NPC's ability to see if it's any better.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2627399141
[h1]Controls[/h1] 
Some indie games don't have controller support, so that is a benefit of PR2, and is how I played the game. Additionally, there's at least two options available for the keyboard controls. This should suit most people's preferences, although the inability to rebind keys is a downside. A clever design choice was having the run button in the overworld sections slow down the character during fights, so that you can carefully dodge tight bullet patterns. 

With the controls working well overall, I'd say the main downside is not having an ability to fire in one direction and strafe your character around attacks. It means that dodging and attacking enemies take place separately, because you have to face enemies in order to shoot at them. 


[h1]Story[/h1] 
Even though the title screen shows a dramatic image of Princess Remedy, there isn't an introductory cutscene or transition as you start up the game. Instead, you're standing in front of an NPC who provides a very distilled summary of what's taking place, with the expectation that you go out and start helping the sickly right away. One could applaud the developers for getting to the point, but it's so brusque that it feels clumsy and unimportant. The unintended attitude this expresses is along the lines of, “It's the same idea from last time, how much explanation do you need to start playing the game?”

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2627398764
[h1]Visuals[/h1] 
If there was one area that could have used some improvement it was the art style, as it's one of the weakest elements of the game. The intentional use of the black background does create a neat effect, sort of like a black velvet painting, but the art is too crude to be very impactful. In fact, it's so basic that I'm not sure what kind of creatures some of the NPCs are meant to be, and the humans look like giant heads with tiny bodies. 

This also applies to the environment, as it can be hard to get the proper sense of space and perspective in relation to trees and walls. I think the item that looked worst of all were the NPCs made up of two colors instead of one, because their bodies would be bisected awkwardly, with each half made up of only one of the two colors. 


[h1]Sound Design[/h1] 
The music of PR2 has an NES chiptune vibe to it because of the beep and boop noises used to make up the songs. For a short game, there's a good variety of songs for the different locations you'll travel to. Personally, some of the notes were a bit grating, but I liked how most of the game's soundtrack turned out in spite of that problem. Considering what the music is comprised of, it's not surprising that the sound effects are of a similar style, which meshed together well with PR2's overall presentation. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2627398669
[h1]Pros[/h1] 
🌟 There's a good difficulty curve in the game, as enemies get more aggressive and have larger bullet spreads the further you go. This also ties in nicely with the range of difficulty levels, though the hardest one seems to have taken it a bit too far based on all of the discussion posts about it. 
🌟 Instead of only having one boss fight, there's a handful of them scattered around. There are also some secrets you can find, such as another difficulty level and a hidden boss. 
🌟 Some of the dialogue is pretty funny. 


[h1]Cons[/h1] 
❌ All throughout the game there are references made to Wash-Olof and people being obsessed with him, but I haven't a clue who the heck that is. Turns out he's the first person you speak with, but I still don't understand the obsession. 
❌ The first game was free, so when I finished it in an hour, I wasn't surprised. I finished this game in about 70 minutes, and it costs $5. Those additional 10 minutes must have really been something. 


[h1]Tips[/h1]
🔍 Although its the enemies that actually harm you, the biggest obstacle tends to be the cramped arenas, as they almost always feel a bit small. Focusing on a few enemies so they are killed off quickly will help with this matter, and make encounters much more survivable. 
🔍 If you're struggling on a particular fight, looking for treasure chests or hidden power-ups may tip the scale so that you can overcome it. 
🔍 There's quite a few abilities, so you might want to test them out at some point to see what they all do. 


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] 
When I played this game on a whim, I wasn't expecting to finish it the same session that I first tried it, or that it'd be almost identical to the free game that preceded it. My expectations for the first game were quite low because it was a freebie, but there was enough fun for it to be worth killing 60 minutes of my time. With the developers announcing a sequel, I got the impression that PR1 was a prototype and test of concept to get feedback for a larger, more developed project. 

However, instead of a sequel that expanded on its humble origins, this one is a doppleganger that hasn't brought anything new except for a price tag. I don't begrudge a game developer for wanting to make some money off of their product, but why would anybody pay $5 to experience something that's available for free? As the, technically prequel, is such a dud, I don't recommend getting it.

The Princess remedy games are fun retro style romps where you explore towns and villages and fight viruses in small battle minigames. The game tracks your progress by number of NPCs cured where the more people you cure the more areas you unlock.

Every time you attempt to cure someone you enter what is essentially a mini arena in which you have to kill all enemies before you can proceed. With each person cured, these battles get progressively harder. The game balances challenge and engagement well, and you never feel like battles are unfair or get too frustrated from losing. Other than its fun gameplay, Princess Remedy is aided by its clever writing and excellent soundtrack.

The Princess Remedy games are fairly simple and a playthrough only takes about an hour, but they’re fun for what they are. If this game’s price seems scary to you, you can always try the first game for free and see if its gameplay style is right for you.

Das kostenlose „Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt“ entpuppte sich als Überraschungshit auf Steam. Was liegt da also näher, als einen zweiten Teil zu produzieren, der zwar etwas umfangreicher ausfällt, dafür aber auch kostenpflichtig ist? So oder so ähnlich dürfte wohl der Gedankengang vom schwedischen Indie-Entwickler Ludosity ausgesehen haben. Also kreierte man ein Prequel mit den Namen Princess Remedy in a Heap of Trouble und veröffentlichte dieses am 09.09.2016 auf Steam, wo es aktuell für 3,99 Euro zu erwerben ist. Ob das Spielkonzept in seiner kommerziellen Form immer noch überzeugen kann oder nicht, erfahrt ihr im folgendem Test.


[h1]Zerplatzter Urlaub[/h1]
Wie bereits geklärt, handelt es sich um ein Prequel. Die Handlung spielt also vor den Ereignissen des ersten Teils: Eigentlich befand sich Prinzessin Remedy, ihres Zeichen Heiler-Azubine, im Urlaub. Dummerweise brachen zwischenzeitlich in der Nachbarregion der Heiler-Akademie, dem sogenannten „Boss Tower,“ mehrere seltsame Krankheiten aus. Also wurde Remedy von ihrem Lehrer Wash-Olof zurückbeordert, um die Bewohner des Boss Towers zu heilen sowie den Ursprung der Krankheiten zu ermitteln und zu beseitigen.

Und mehr gibt es dazu auch nicht zu sagen. Die Handlung dient nun wirklich nur noch als Mittel zum Zweck, um ein weiteres Spiel raushauen zu können. Aber das haben Prequels ja nun einmal so an sich.
Nichtsdestotrotz wurde der Schrifttext im Spiel wieder sehr charmant und amüsant verfasst. Die Krankheiten sind so bekloppt wie eh und je, und statt einer Hochzeit gibt es zum Schluss nun ein Tanzdate auf einem Ball – Tanz-Minigame inklusive. Ehrensache, dass man sich seinen Tanzpartner wieder aus allen im Spiel auftauchenden NPCs aussuchen darf und jeder von denen seine eigene Tanz-Melodie mitbringt. Besagtes Tanzspiel ist im Stil von „Dance Dance Revolution“ gehalten und variiert, je nach Tanzpartner von leicht bis brechend schwer. Das Tanz-Minigame ist jedoch ein reiner Bonus und greift nicht in die Endwertung ein. Ungeschickte Spieler brauchen sich diesbezüglich also keine Sorgen machen.


[h1]Jetzt auch mit Dating-Partnern und mehreren Bosskämpfen[/h1]
Die groben Spielschemata haben sich seit Teil 1 nicht geändert. Es ist eine unterhaltsame Verschmelzung aus Erkundung und Kampf, RPG-Elementen und Shoot'em Up. Das Spiel wird aus der Vogelperspektive gesteuert, unterstützt Controller und bietet drei Schwierigkeitsgrade sowie Speicherslots.
Der Umfang wurde seit dem Vorgänger angehoben und bietet nun ca. die doppelte Spieldauer bei gründlicher Spielweise (also ca. 90 Minuten).

Details zum allgemeinen Gameplay findet ihr in meinem Review zu „Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt.“ An dieser Stelle möchte ich nur auf die Änderungen und Neuerungen eingehen, da die beiden Spiele ansonsten identisch funktionieren: So wurde der Statistikwert „Regen“ gegen „Drain“ ausgetauscht. Soll heißen, dass Remedys Lebenspunkte nicht mehr automatisch regenerieren, sondern nur noch, indem man Gegnern Schaden zufügt. Die altbekannten Herzbarrieren, welche erst passiert werden dürfen, wenn man genügend Lebenspunkte angehäuft hat, offenbaren nun Bosskämpfe die zu bewältigen sind, wenn man in das neue Gebiet vorstoßen möchte. Die Bosskämpfe sind dabei erfreulich abwechslungsreich und halten eine gute Balance aus ansteigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad. Lediglich der reguläre Endkampf ist mehr oder weniger eine Kopie des Endkampfes aus Teil 1. Da hätte man vielleicht etwas mehr Kreativität erwartet. Aber als Ersatz gibt es ja noch einen versteckten Bonus-Endgegner.;)

Die größte neue Attraktion ist jedoch das Dating-System. Ihr könnt jeden NPC im Spiel daten, sofern dieser gesund ist. Das bedeutet im Klartext, dass er euch begleitet und Remedys Zweitwaffe, die altbekannte Flask-Granate, gegen seine eigene Spezialfähigkeit ersetzt. Diese Fähigkeiten können entweder Variationen der Flask-Granate sein, oder spezielle Funktionen für den automatisch feuernden Standard-Schuss, wie etwa Schnellfeuer oder zielsuchende Projektile. Oder wie wärs mit einer geringfügigen Heilung oder einer schnelleren Laufgeschwindigkeit? Ein gewisser Teil des Spielspaßes liegt also darin, mit diesen Zweitwaffen-Variationen und Sonderfunktionen herumzuexperimentieren und zu gucken, was einem am meisten nutzt. Wer darauf keinen Bock hat, kann das Dating-System jedoch auch komplett ignorieren und bei der altbekannten Flask-Granate bleiben. Dieses neue Feature schießt Puristen also keineswegs in die Quere. Da können sich andere Fortsetzung eine Scheibe abschneiden.


[h1]Remedys geheimer Egoshooter-Trip[/h1]
Etwas, was man nur mitbekommt, wenn man sich im Steam-Forum umschaut (oder dieses Review liest), ist das versteckte Bonus-Spiel „REALLYDAD.“ Dieses aktiviert ihr, in der Schwierigkeitsgrad-Auswahl, wo ihr mehrere Sekunden lang die Rechts-Taste gedrückt halten müsst, bevor dieser Spielmodus offengelegt wird.
Hierbei handelt es sich um einen sehr primitiven Egoshooter, der sich ziemlich mies spielt, da er, wie auch das reguläre Spiel, kein Strafing erlaubt. Während das im regulären Spiel verschmerzbar ist, da dieses um diese Beschränkung aufgebaut wurde, passt diese Einschränkung zu einem Egoshooter freilich hinten und vorne nicht. Man sollte also kein Spiel erwarten, das Spaß macht. Ein cooles Kuriosum ist REALLYDAD aber dennoch.

Die Handlung fungiert zum Beispiel als Prequel zu „in a Heap in Trouble.“ Eine Krankheitswelle ist in der Heiler-Akademie ausgebrochen. Remedy macht sich auf ihre Mitschüler zu heilen und die Quelle der Krankheiten zu beseitigen. Nach getaner Arbeit bekommt sie von ihrer Mutter, der Königin, eine Urlaubsreise geschenkt.
Der Egoshooter verwendet dieselben Gameplay-Bausteine wie das Primärspiel, weswegen ich nicht weiter darauf eingehen werde. Geändert wurden im Grunde genommen nur die Perspektive und die Manövrierbarkeit der Spielfigur, die hier auch rückwärts laufen kann. Dennoch fühlt sich Remedys Beweglichkeit nicht gut an und die Egoperspektive kostet natürlich auch den Großteil der Übersicht, was den Shooter nicht unbedingt leichter macht. Einen Dating-Parter kann man auch nicht wählen. Netterweise ist REALLYDAD vorbei ehe es zu sehr auf die Nerven geht. Im Endeffekt ist es halt nur ein kleiner cooler Bonus.


[h1]Grafik und Sound[/h1]
Grafisch hat sich seit dem letzten Teil nichts geändert. Auch hier wird der Stil alter ZX Spectrum Heimcomputer-Spiele emuliert. Es gibt also nur eine sehr limitierte Farbpalette vor schwarzem Hintergrund. Es ist ein minimalistischer, aber charmanter Grafikstil, der jedoch bei den meisten Retro-Gamern keine nostalgischen Gefühle wecken dürfte, da der ZX Spectrum außerhalb Englands einfach kein großes Thema war. Dennoch kann dieser Grafikstil gefallen, wenn man sich darauf einlässt. Witzigerweise wurde die Grafik auch recht ordentlich in den Bonus-Egoshooter übertragen.

Beim Soundtrack gibt es wieder nichts zu meckern. Die Tracks fangen den Charme gefälliger 8-bit-Melodien mühelos ein und die Soundeffekte passen ebenfalls. Wer die Akustik des ersten Teils mochte, wird auch hier gut bedient.


[h1]Pro und Kontra:[/h1]

Pro:
- geniale Verschmelzung von Shmup und RPG-Elementen
- ist extrem charmant
- toller Retro-OST
- sinnvolle Erweiterungen des Spielprinzips
- verstecktes FPS-Bonusspiel

Kontra:
- ist ein kommerzielles Spiel, der Umfang wirkt für 3,99 € vielleicht etwas gering
- es ist nur eine Prequel-Story, die den Charme des ersten Teils nicht erreicht
- keine Strafing-Funktion


[h1]Immer noch sehr charmant und spaßig![/h1]

+ Great soundtrack.
+ Simple, yet fun gameplay.
+ Full of secrets. World is full of hidden powerups. There also a lot of other secrets like secret difficulty, secret boss and a bunch of other cool secrets.
+ Great replayability.
+ Graphics, ""they suck"", the artstyle is similar to undertale's but I like this one a lot more. It features a huge environment variety, but all in poor quality if I can describe it that way. Still, game looks beautiful.
+ Improves over the first game with having a better replayability and much much more powers you can use in combat (First game had only one power, this game has atleast 15)

- Can be annoying if you want to date a character with a certain powerup and you forget which character had which powerup.
- Really needs Steam Achievements.

Princess Remedy 2: In A Heap of Trouble is a game in which our goal is to treat people we meet along the way, and even doors(yes, doors). We treat them by killing the viruses they have in their bodies.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

8-bit graphics can be enjoyed by many older players. I also liked it, although in some places the characters were similar in color to the surroundings and it was hard to notice them.

[h1]Sound[/h1]

The music is also 8-bit and adapts to the situation on the screen. It's different when we're exploring the map, and different when we're fighting.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
In general, the game is cool, but it has a few drawbacks like the dating system with the characters we meet. Theoretically, they should give us additional skills during the fight, but I don't think that's the case.

Ce drôle de mélange hétéroclite est de surcroît accompagné d'un délicieux retournement des conventions...

Malgré leur humilité, ces jeux sont pour moi deux bijoux extraordinairement distrayants, qui prouvent que l'on peut créer quelque chose de surprenant, transgressif et novateur à partir de ""vieux"" concepts des années 1980, même si le premier épisode (gratuit) vaut plus le détour que le second (payant)...

Básicamente este es el juego, sencillo, pero divertido, ya que cada vez ira subiendo en dificultad, aparte de esto, tendremos que ir investigando, ya que hay determinados secretos, e iremos hablando con estos personajes y conociendo más acerca de la historia, que básicamente es que hay que salvar al reino, pero cuyas conversaciones con los distintos personajes que nos iremos encontrando, tienen ciertos tintes de humor.

El juego se puede jugar con teclado, pero también con mando, la verdad que se disfruta de los dos modos, el manejo del personaje es sencillo y esta muy bien.

Lo recomiendo si eres un amante de los juegos Indies, o juegos de habilidad tipo Super Meat Boy, este juego tiene un estilo grafico a los juegos de los años 80, de los ordenadores amstrad o commodore antiguos, también recuerda al zelda de nes o los juegos inmediatamente anteriores a este, lo cual te sorprenderá, por que este juego es una demostración más de que un buen juego, para ser bueno, debe ser divertido.

En cuanto a la duración, yo he hecho una marca de 1 hora y 20 tantos minutos y completado al 92 por ciento de secretos, en una duración normal, y por lo que veo, es más o menos la duración media de la mayoría, e incluso menos, por lo tanto lo recomiendo comprar en una oferta, pienso que igual se puede encontrar por 99 céntimos o menos, precio por el cual, si eres un amante de este tipo de juegos, puede ser una buena adquisición para tu biblioteca.

También decirte, que hay una primera parte, la cual es gratuita, y creo que es muy parecida a esta, aunque no la he jugado, por lo tanto, es una buena oportunidad para probar el estilo y si te convence hacerte con esta segunda.

其次游戏的画面表现并不尽如人意。虽然游戏采用了卡通风格的画面设计，但整体效果却显得粗糙和缺乏细节。场景和角色的建模都显得简单，缺乏层次感和立体感。同时游戏中的光影效果和色彩搭配也显得平淡，无法给玩家带来视觉上的享受。

在音效方面游戏同样存在问题。背景音乐单调乏味，缺乏变化，无法为游戏增添氛围。而角色配音则显得生硬和不自然，让人难以代入角色。

更糟糕的是游戏的操作体验相当糟糕。角色的移动和动作反应迟钝，经常出现卡顿和延迟的情况。这使得玩家在解决麻烦和进行任务时感到非常不便，大大降低了游戏的可玩性。

最后游戏的稳定性也存在问题。在游戏过程中，我遇到了多次闪退和卡顿的情况，这严重影响了我的游戏体验。

综上所述，在剧情、画面、音效、操作体验以及稳定性等方面都存在明显的问题和不足。虽然它试图通过独特的设定和风格吸引玩家，但实际表现却令人失望。对于期待一款优质冒险解谜游戏的玩家来说，这款游戏可能不是一个好的选择。",1571909217,1710687109,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game can be played with a controller although keyboard would probably work fine as well since there are only 4 movement buttons and 1 action button required.

Like the first game, Princess Remedy 2 is a retro bullet hell shoot 'em up. You play as Princess Remedy who has to investigate a mysterious Boss Tower which has sprung up and caused the local townfolk to fall ill. To heal the sick NPCs, Princess Remedy enters a bullet hell match where the aim is to kill all the enemies while surviving enemy projectiles. As you win encounters and heal NPCs, you gain increases to your Heart stat which is required to pass locked gates to the next zones. You can also gain stat increases from treasure chests that power up your autofiring weapon. There are 3 difficulty modes, but the game is very difficult even on Normal. In this game, Heart gates are also boss battles which are ridiculously overtuned and are basically damage sponges that offer no interesting mechanics but continuously summon adds that just make the encounter unfair and frustrating.

The new gameplay mechanic is that Princess Remedy can date any NPC she has healed, which basically becomes her partner that follows her around on the field and she can use a special ability during bullet hell encounters. This feature is shallow at best; there are no romance options/scenes and the special ability doesn't do much to help against the insanely difficult boss battles.

There is still no world map, the game doesn't keep track of which NPCs you've healed and the pathguiding to the next objective is nonexistent.

Unfortunately, this felt like a huge mess of design mishaps and a downgrade from the first game in terms of execution.

In the original game, Remedy's hitbox was her entire sprite. This was straight-forward and didn't cause any confusion. In this sequel, the hitbox is significantly more ambiguous. I'm still not exactly sure what it is, but I assume it's her eyes, since that's where your shots come from. This makes it way harder to tell what's going on when facing upwards, since the character's eyes aren't visible.

The first game had several enemies, each of which all had their own unique pattern of attack and movement. This game keeps many of the same enemies (with adjusted sprites, but they still look mostly the same) but adds enemies that have redundant behaviours. 

Additionally, the first three boss fights rely on additionals (normal enemies just added into the fight) for a sort of artificial difficulty and incorporate too many background sprites. Specifically the third boss is the most egregious offender, where it's initially unclear what is and isn't going to block your path and the screen is visually too busy to tell what's going on thanks to the fast-moving adds that constantly spew bullets and the background elements being generally all-over.

If this were a game where one could control the direction of your shots independent of your movement, the first three bosses having additionals (rather than actually changing attack patterns) would be less of a gripe design wise. Every boss afterwards is an actually fun and interesting boss design both visually and gameplay wise; movement areas aren't unnecessarily cluttered by background sprites and additionals are both more thematically included and feel more organically part of the boss fight.

Even certain areas in the towns and overworlds feel like sprites and colours were used too liberally, the 'limited palette' look from the original game being sort of disregarded to add as many specific colours to certain items just wherever. This is however less of a problem as it doesn't directly affect gameplay, but it still makes certain areas seem weirdly out of place. 

It it nice however to see NPCs such as the girl who thought she was a rock, jealous chest, and a few others return from the first game to this one. 

Overall, this game feels like a let down as a sequel due to some design choices that probably weren't exactly necessary. Aside from the sort-of new enemies that just act like reskins of old ones that are still actually in this game, and some town and overworld designs that provide visual clutter, as well as visually cluttered boss fights.

Overall, if you haven't played ""Princess Remedy In A World Of Hurt"", you'll probably adore this game for its charm. If you're coming off the coattails of the first game, you'll still absolutely adore this game, since it's just more of the same. But I personally couldn't enjoy this, and found Remedy's first game to be all around better for both gameplay and charm.

If you enjoyed Princess Remedy in A World of Hurt (which you should definitely try out; it's very fun and completely free), In A Heap of Trouble is basically more of the same: you go around, interacting with NPC's and healing them of their illnesses by shooting said illnesses in top-down shmup segments, where Remedy fires automatically (so you just have to worry about positioning and dodging enemies and obstacles), and you get health upgrades for healing NPCs and a wealth of other upgrades from scattered treasure chests.

The main differences here are

1) This game is a bit longer and progressively gets more difficult than the first game; I died a few times near the end. Thankfully the only penalty for death is being booted back in front of the NPC.

2) Whereas in the first game, you could date any NPC in the epilogue to get unique ending dialogue, here you can start dating any healthy NPC from the get-go. Depending on who you're dating, you will have a different special ability, including faster movement, a backstep, freezing surrounding enemies, and laying down mines, among others, which can give you a good edge in combat. Almost every NPC shares the same ability with several other NPCs, which is a little disappointing, but there is still one primary difference between each NPC; but I'd rather not spoil that little tidbit.

3) The first game had one boss fight at the very end, but this game focuses on having multiple bosses, each one acting as a barrier between areas. Each one is unique, offering interesting visuals and a challenging fight, so these are very much appreciated!

And just so I don't forget to mention these, I adore the well-crafted ZX-Spectrum-style graphics, and the NES-style soundtrack is pretty great too!

Overall I'd say In A Heap of Trouble is basically a direct upgrade of In A World of Hurt, and I enjoyed it quite a bit! My only real complaints are that, like the first game, you can't strafe, which I think could have made the combat even more enjoyable, and while the dialogue from the NPCs is quite humorous, the jokes from the numerous bookshelves, radios, and signs you find in the overworld revolve around the same joke, which gets old quickly. Even then this is still a very fun and great title!

And honestly, the stuff you can do after beating the final boss - stuff I don't want to spoil - is very unexpected and makes this game worth the price in and of itself.",1571179474,1571179474,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

こちらのゲームは一応続編となりますので、知らない人はまず前作をプレイするのがおすすめです。
しかも前作は無料ゲームなので、まずはどんなゲームなのか遊んでみましょう。
それで気に入れば今作を買うのがいいかと思います。
https://store.steampowered.com/app/407900/Princess_Remedy_in_a_World_of_Hurt/

言語は前作と同じく英語のみ。ストーリーを深く理解するにはある程度英語が読めないといけませんが、英語が分からない人でもゲーム自体はシンプル。前作が大丈夫な人なら今作も大丈夫でしょう。

プレイスタイルは前作と変わりません。ゲームシステムも同じで、病気の人を治して旅するシューティング風RPGです。ただ操作性が良くなっていて、前作は1つのボタンしかなかったので誤動作が多く、会話しようとしたらステータス画面が開いたりしてましたが、今作はボタンが分けられました。

また今作は仲間を1人連れて行くことができ、これが前作の「ボム」扱い。なんと病気を治したキャラクターを誰でも連れて行くことができます。既に仲間がいる場合は、そのキャラと交換になります。
それぞれ違う「アビリティ」を持っていて、前作同様に爆弾をなげるもの、連射速度アップ、ホーミング弾等いろんな種類があります。流石に全キャラが違うアビリティというわけでは無く、被りもありますが・・・面白いシステムです。

あと今作はエリア移動に毎回「中ボス」がいます。そこそこ強いので、前作よりもちょっと難しくなってるかもしれません。クリアできない程では無いと思いますので、前作がクリアできる人なら大丈夫だと思います。

最後にプレイ時間は前作と同様1時間ちょっとなので、あまり変わりません。過度な期待をしては駄目です。前作よりもちょっとパワーアップしている程度です。プレイ時間が短すぎるので定価500円はキツイかも。
本当に前作が好きで欲しい人だけ買うのがいいでしょう。",1571076341,1571076547,True,3,2,0.520765960216522217,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I was not looking for the completely new gameplay of its hidden difficulty and now that I’ve experienced it, I long for another game in the series built entirely around what I’ve seen. Few games hide such wonders deep within a quality experience of its own, but Princess Remedy has the benefit of being built upon a rock-solid foundation of creativity and fun. If you enjoyed the first game you absolutely cannot miss this one, as it does just about everything better and tops it with one of the best surprises you’re liable to get from any game.

Сюжет - 10/10
Насколько я понял, сюжет заключается в том, что вдруг откуда ни возьмись из-под земли выросла Босс Башня (Boss Tower в оригинале), по виду напоминающая дерево, заодно подняв с земли (btw действия игры разворачиваются на Сатурне, лол) все города. Жителям делать нечего - поэтому они и не против особо. Но со временем граждане-обыватели стали замечать, что их народ терроризируют различные болезни, от грусти и печали до вывиха шеи. Помочь всем жителям и, самое главное, Принцу сего Королевства, доверили ученице Сатурнийской школы лечения, принцессе Ремеди. Неплохо.

There wasn't really ever a moment where I thought I should stop retrying a level to go run back for a different partner for a competitive edge. For me it's also worth noting that the dating amounts to what should be about 4 different lines of flavor text per character per play through. If you were hooked by the idea of the dating, know it's not really that kind of game. That's about it for complaints though.

The gameplay is an brilliant hybrid of a Shmup and a classic JRPG, in the best way I see it as a bare bones deconstruction of the two, all it has are:
-Party mechanics, you can have one other party member with one benefit.
-Stat increases from chests you find throughout the world.
-A single passive ability that drains life upon defeating an enemy.
-Shooting.
And this is all it needs! Overall, an extremely charming game and a perfect example of how in game design less can be a lot more, and how to perfectly ease difficulty up while leaving a player to learn mechanics of their own accord.

Same as the first game, the world is full of people and things suffering from various ailments. Your job is to heal them all. The main action occurs in a single screen shooter. Your character auto fires the normal attack so you can focus on aiming and strategically using your limited special ability. Outside of combat, you explore towns and dungeons to find people to heal. New to this game is the ability to ""date"" those you save, each of which gives you one of many possible special abilities.

[h1]What I like:[/h1]
Each person or thing you heal is suffering from a different ailment, often funny ones like lack of self confidence, which you heal somehow so they are confident. Or some guy had his face melted off from an amazing experience he had. You can fix that. 
There are treasure chests scattered and hidden throughout the world which contain permanent stat boosts. Some are located in secret areas.
Depending on who you are on a date with, you will have a different special ability, such as homing shots, placing mines, or instantly dashing toward or away from the enemy, etc. Some of these are better in certain types of battles than others. 

[h1]What I don't like:[/h1]
The game is still only an hour long, like the previous game, but the dating mechanic means you can have different experiences each playthrough if you choose.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
This game is just as fun as the first. I would recommend this to anyone who simply wants more of the same as the first game, ""In A World of Hurt."" If you haven't played that one first, go do so before you decide to buy this game.

I saw it was a free game and downloaded it, but boy am I glad I did. Though the gameplay is simple it provides a few interesting mechanics to the table, not to mention the depth it goes into. 

First thing's first: what is this game? Princess Remedy 2: In A Heap of Trouble is an rpg with bullet hell elements where you play as a princess who is a doctor, aptly named ""Princess Remedy."" As Remedy you go to various townsfolk, monsters, and sometimes inanimate objects and they'll tell you what's wrong with them, you're then dropped into a small bullet hell section where you have to defeat all the enemies  on screen to cure your patient, after you've finished curing them you get a quick, cute little dialogue where the person you saved thanks you. 

This is where an interesting mechanic comes in. After curing any, and yes I do mean any person, you have the option to ""date"" them. Dating a townsfolk makes them follow your character around the map and they give you a buff of sorts, they may range from changing how your weapons work to giving  you more health in the healing segments.

The bosses for this game are strong and fresh and after you beat the game, you may activate a ""first person"" mode, which sounds bizarre mostly because it is. You play the game in first person and gain access to a hidden boss, along with giving yourself a huge challenge. 

Overall, I do recommend this game. It's surprisingly fleshed out for a free game and is a great sequel to the first one. There's a surprising amount of easter eggs and some fun and quirky characters, not to mention the boss fights which range from pretty easy to ungodly hard depending on how much you decide to complete the game before bosses. This was a quick 2-3 hour game that I was able to beat in one sitting and it gives just enough for you to say to yourself ""wow I got all this from a free game?""",1561858064,1561858064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

i'll still give it a thumbs up cause its basically the first game AND this game for 5 dollars.....which.....is more fair? sorta. but even nboth these games together its too expensive at 5 dollars. HOpe there's another game, its a great character and concept and fun! THIS ONE wasn't as fun and was shorter but....u kno still good i hope we get more and this character is in other games like the fighting slap super smash ripoff game so that's really cool",1560797769,1560797769,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm definitely not complaining though, as I fit into that category of people perfectly and I always felt like Remedy 1 was quality enough to have payed for. The art, writing and gameplay are as fun as ever, the only problem being how samey it feels to the original. Also the one and only new mechanic and biggest change in Remedy 2 is the dating mechanic which, while utilized well as a way to shove in more funny dialogue, can otherwise be described and underwhelming at best and completely unnecessary at worst.

this is a nice little game and this may just be me but i find most fights easy or hard and rarely inbetween. i feel its do to the small screen limiting movement and attack space. encounters are easy unless its full of bullets then it goes to far the other way and more so when they remove the area you can move in.
this is a really good starter bullet hell game but i feel a expert would want more though this could be hard enough for them to enjoy. 5.5/10

Вы играете за принцессу ИСЦЕЛЕНИЕ (Хотя мне больше по душе выражение ХИЛКА) и вы должны исцелить большое колличество самых разных персонажей. Окончив обучение вы начинаете всой путь к замку принца. После исцеления любого персонажа вы можете взять его к себе в команду и... Блин, это просто нереально вам поможет! У каждого персонажа свои способности. Боссы здесь просто ужас! Не в том смысле, что они ужасно сделаны, а в том что они выглядят страшно! А про их сложность я вообще молчу! Это хардкор друзья! А я ведь играл нормальном уровне сложности... Но за что я так полюбил эту игру? Саундтрек... Он настолько прекрасен, что я не могу подобрать слов что бы описать его! Он выполнен в стиле чиптюна (8 бит) и этот жанр так и ласкает мои уши ведь я ценитель классики. Возможно заявление громкое, но я считаю, что он должен быть на одной полке с андертейлом.

It's basically more of the same. Since World of Hurt was free, I don't mind terribly.
If you liked Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt, you'll like Princess Remedy in a Heap of Trouble. If you didn't, you won't. That's pretty much all there is to it.
Remedy is a good game, with some minor annoyances that could mostly be avoided (primarily higher difficulties). It's extremely short, and Remedy doesn't get much development as a character, but the difficulty curve is reasonable (except for one particular boss), there's a few secrets that aren't easy to find but are pretty rewarding (though nothing as exciting as [spoiler]finding Frallan in the first game[/spoiler], and the Jealous Chest challenge is much more manageable this time around. Plus, while it's just as ridiculous, [spoiler]Reallydad mode makes a return, though this time it actually has some gameplay instead of being just a joke.[/spoiler]
Which isn't to say that there isn't one significant improvement! It's not going to change the mind of anyone who didn't like the first game, but this time, instead of only being able to marry people once you've beaten the game, you can date anyone you've helped, whenever you want, and have them follow you around the world and change your flask power. I was [i]thrilled[/i]. One of the major things I wanted improved upon from the first game was the love mechanics, and this game gives me everything I wanted out of them: I can take my love on my journeys, they comment on bosses, they give me a power-up, and I get [spoiler]a minigame at the end with them![/spoiler]
The biggest problem I had with the first game is still present, however: you can only shoot in the direction you're moving. No strafing. This is especially frustrating in certain boss fights where the game limits your movement to a single narrow line, and in Reallydad mode (though that's a joke anyway so I'm not too broken up about that.) There were more than a few times when I had to choose between dodging and attacking, and some enemies do so much damage that that's not really an option. I don't like bullet hells normally and this is particularly frustrating. If the game wasn't so good, this would be more annoying.
As always, I appreciate how much representation this game has. Remmy[spoiler]'s plump thighs[/spoiler] and Frallan is still my OTP.

Taking much the same mechanics as the first game and presenting a new world of kooky characters and strange locales, you could be forgiven for thinking this to be a simple continuation, an expansion, of the original. That’s what I thought, even as I began to explore the new mechanics and bosses introduced. By the end it had proven itself its own title, with enough setting it apart to show a real evolution of the series, if a modest one. But plumbing the many secrets of the Heap of Trouble revealed something so striking that it’s almost worth playing through just for that singular experience.

Going the prequel route, Remedy 2 catches up with our favorite little combat medic back in Saturnian healing school. An aptly-named Boss Tower has erupted from the land, sprouting giant tendrils that have lifted parts of the populated world into the sky. It’s also making everyone dreadfully sick, and who better to save the day than a sprightly littel healer? In her quest up the tower, Remedy will encounter all manner of afflicted citizens, collect a variety of powerups, face off against massive bosses, and drag hapless dates along for the ride.

It’s a more interesting setup than the original, with kookier characters and stranger lands to explore. I’ve healed birds with too many thumbs, chronic haters of video game writing, people that don’t exist, and the self-loathing embodiment of hype itself. Traveling the Dragon-Questish lands of opulent Moneyplace, airy Avian Peaks, and the grim Dead Gardens to name a few. The writing and creativity are significantly dialed up here, and complimented with running-gag collectibles to hunt for alongside the many, many hidden treasure chests in the walls of houses and floating in inky voids.

Combat is much the same as before though, a mix of bullet-hell dodging gauntlets of foes and blasting them away with your auto-firing bandaids or syringes. The mechanics have changed in a few places, though, such as the regen stat being swapped for drain which restores your own health as you damage enemies. Flasks also have dozens of different uses now, from screen-clearing clusters and devastating lasers to speed boosts and land mines. Your flask function is determined by who you’re dating at the moment, a new system that feels like a needed expansion of marriage in the first game, allowing you to bring along any NPC in the game as your little love buddy. They also comment on the bosses you face, taking the form of huge, creepy, screen-filling creatures to blast the weak points of. While they’re more engaging than the old heart gates I must admit they make the game feel more like a traditional battling RPG than the unique healing-centric first title.

There are certainly innovations to be found here, if only incremental ones. Starting out A Heap of Trouble didn’t feel hugely different from World of Hurt, though given how good the first one is more of the same is hardly disappointing. I came to appreciate the new dating and combat mechanics more and more as I progressed, and the writing started to get more and more chuckles from me the closer I got to the end. The final boss will be a familiar presence for fans of the original, and I was delighted to find a secret boss afterwards that presented a significant challenge. That gave me a hint to a special hidden difficulty that, honestly, I’m struggling not to spoil for you. It’s one of the most unique surprises I’ve ever seen in a game, and while it is indeed incredibly hard it’s also so different and so fascinating compared to the base game, you absolutely have to see it for yourself… especially if you’re a fan of the obscure classic Faceball 2000.

Princess Remedy 2 is already a modest improvement over the original, but its secret difficulty easily pushes it up into the realm of must-have. I came to this one looking for more adorable shmup action and I got it, with enhancements to the combat and punchier writing than ever. I was not looking for the completely new gameplay of its hidden difficulty and now that I’ve experienced it, I long for another game in the series built entirely around what I’ve seen. Few games hide such wonders deep within a quality experience of its own, but Princess Remedy has the benefit of being built upon a rock-solid foundation of creativity and fun. If you enjoyed the first game you absolutely cannot miss this one, as it does just about everything better and tops it with one of the best surprises you’re liable to get from any game.

Gameplay is identical to the first game, but with the addition of the ability to date any of the NPCs you now have a huge host of alternate abilities you can replace your throwable flask with. If you're having trouble with a particular stage then not only do you still have the option to try other stages first to level up a bit, you can now change your flask to something like a piercing laser or a heal and see if the alternate strategies that come with them help you clear the stage.

Another solid balance change is the replacement of the Regen stat with a new feature called ""Drain"". Rather than a slow health regen on a delay after being hit, you now recover a tidbit of health every time a bullet strikes an enemy. The original Regen function had a tendency to have little to no impact on Remedy's survivability, and this change makes it far more useful.

Enemy variety is even more plentiful than before, with a number of new enemy shot types added to the mix such as shots that will shift direction once to avoid missing you, or shots that leave a hazardous trail behind them. The stages are still balanced excellently and make full use of creative enemy combinations, with redundant ""the same enemy as before but with more HP"" foes phased out in favor of increasingly varied attack patterns as you progress.

Likewise, the addition of end-of-world bosses is a welcome new feature, with each of them acting as their own unique challenge to cap off each set of stages. On top of being a great way to test the player's progress, they provide you with some really fun setups that couldn't otherwise be accomplished with just regular enemies, acting as that final bit of fleshing out for a wonderfully varied level set.

Upgrade drops have been streamlined, with bosses now being how you get shot power and multishot powerups rather than finding them in random chests, ensuring a smoother difficulty curve compared to the first game. Likewise, secrets have been improved, requiring a keener eye than the previous game and as a result they're actually quite fun to find.

The humor is still spot-on, and on top of a unique ending line per character, every single one of them now has a short Dance Dance Revolution-styled minigame should you pick them to be your date after the final boss. A -unique- DDR minigame per-person, mind you. That's something like 65 songs!

Also, there's a secret 80s FPS mini-campaign that perfectly captures the jankiness of what few shooters we had in that era.

In closing, Remedy 2 does exactly what a sequel should strive for: If something worked the first time, expand on it. If it was lacking something, add it. And if something didn't work so great, tweak or change it until it does. It's improvements and additions more than justify the bump from Free to $5, so if you liked the first game you should absolutely play this as well.

But more of same as the original. Really. It ain't different enough. Seeing how Princess Remedy is an individual with limited social responsibility, she can now date anybody anytime. Well, actually it means you can grab any NPC and thus your Flask powers changes to something else. So there is more variety to gameplay by constantly swapping them. Or you can grab a needed NPC if you have trouble with certain fights. And there are regular bosses. That's all.

So go play the free game first and get this only if you want more of same. I did. Sadly, the magic and charm is not same after the first time. I doubt that the third game would be worth anything without big changes.

Also, secret difficulty is cool. Hold Right at difficulty select. Boom, it's actually a short gimmick FPS. It actually sucks if taken seriously but as a gimmick it's cute.

The first game is free and very similar to this, so you can play that first and pick this up if you want more.

Princess Remedy In a Heap of Trouble é um jogo da série Princess Remedy, recomendo primeiramente você jogar a [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/407900/Princess_Remedy_in_a_World_of_Hurt/] versão free [/url], o gráfico do jogo não é muito bem trabalho, são pixel-arts em poucas cores, a mais predominante é a preta.

O jogo tem uma gameplay interessante, onde é um bullet-hell misturado com estratégia, não sei explicar direito, mas a gameplay é um ponto muito forte. É realmente boa, mas recomendo você jogar para entender o que eu estou falando.

A música do jogo é muito boa de se ouvir, eu pessoalmente gosto muito de músicas chiptune, então caso você goste também recomento comprar o jogo.

Sinceramente acredito que o foco do jogo é a história, pois ele tem bastante diálogos com as personagens, mas na época que eu joguei não sabia falar inglês então não sei te dizer ao certo.
Mas o resumo é que você basicamente é uma mulher que busca salvar as pessoas de doenças, exterminando as doenças dessas pessoas, indo de um lugar ao outro para curar todos os doentes.

Existem vários locais escondidos dentro dos mundo que você entra para curar as pessoas, dentro desses locais escondidos normalmente tem baús com upgrades para o seu personagem.

Pelo fato desse jogo ser leve, eu joguei ele durante uma viagem num notebook então acabou sendo bem útil para matar meu tédio, então é um jogo bem divertido caso não tenha nada melhor para fazer na hora.
O preço dele é bem caro para o jogo na minha opinião, então recomendo esperar uma promoção ou algo do gênero.",1512173844,1562276281,True,5,0,0.575438618659973145,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're not sure whether you'll like this game, I'd recommend trying Princess Remedy In A World of Hurt. It's completely free, and in a way could be seen as a demo of this game. In a way. This game is about as long as Princess Remedy 1. It does have a new 'Dating' mechanic which changes your special attack in battle. This can range from a landmine, flasks like in the first game, a short-range laser, and a larger flask. You can date any NPC in the game. The game also adds a little checkmark when you've 100%ed an overworld area, something the first game would have benefited greatly from. My first playthrough on normal took 53 Minutes, and I 100%ed the game thanks to that feature. When you finish the game, you get a little cutscene with the character you were dating at the time of beating the final boss, similar to the first game. The game is fairly challenging, with higher difficulty levels available for those looking for a harder (Or lesser) challenge, though even a fairly casual player should be able to beat the game on Normal without getting angry. The game relies a lot on humor and charm to sell itself, similar to titles such as Earthbound, and while I can't say I think the humor is as solid as in a game like Earthbound, it's still definitely worth checking out. Simply put, try the free game, and if you like it, support the developers by buying the sequel, it's definitely worth it in my opinion, especially at it's very low price point.",1511737660,1511737660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I really like how something as simple as auto firing and not being able to strafe meanwhile damage heals you creates a disconnect between getting near enemies and running from them. You can get up close with the multi-spread to do damage or sneak in more healing while also risking your current health.

This sequel basically gives you more of the same, however it does add a little mechanic that makes it a bit more interesting. Basically Remedy is once again ordered to ""heal"" the world and has to help people out by curing their illnesses. Goal is to save alot of people and upgrade your stats, like health, projectiles you shoot and their strenght. If you aren't helping people you explore the tiny world in search for chests, which also benefit you. 

The previously mentioned mechanic here is that from the beginning on you can have a companion you can date and switch around as much as you like throughout your journey. Depending on which partner you have, they give you different special abilities during battles. Homing Shots, Speedup, Healing, little Traps and so on, its pretty self explainatory. The game is very fun and battles later on can get quite difficult, which i liked quite a bunch. Never in my short gametime did i feel the game being boring and love its cute style.

Сюжет - 7/10
Насколько я понял, сюжет заключается в том, что вдруг откуда ни возьмись из-под земли выросла Босс Башня (Boss Tower в оригинале), по виду напоминающая дерево, заодно подняв с земли (btw действия игры разворачиваются на Сатурне, лол) все города. Жителям делать нечего - поэтому они и не против особо. Но со временем граждане-обыватели стали замечать, что их народ терроризируют различные болезни, от грусти и печали до вывиха шеи. Помочь всем жителям и, самое главное, Принцу сего Королевства, доверили ученице Сатурнийской школы лечения, принцессе Ремеди. Неплохо.

Геймплей - 7/10
Довольно однообразный bullet hell, но мне нравится :D

Графика - 8.5/10
8-битный графон мне по душе, поэтому за него ментальный лайкос разработчикам.

Музыкальное сопровождение - 7.5/10
В каждой локации она разная, что, в принципе, также не дает нам заскучать. Приятные и не надоедливые мелодии :)

Итог - 7.5/10 свиданий с цветочком!
Отличная игра, чтобы провести за ней часок-другой.

I beat the game 102% on hard mode after a play-through on normal mode.

It changes aspects of each enemy or boss and adds different types of projectile to dodge.

La segunda gran novedad es que al desbloquear los caminos hacia otros mundos primero hay que kuchar contra mini-jefes, otro gran agregado que le da más salsa a esta secuela.
Despues hay otros detalles como que los controles estan más pulidos. El resto sigue siendo igual, manteniendo la esencia y ternura del primero.
Incluye un super secreto que a muchos seguidores de los juegos FPS les agradará :). Y algunas otras sorpresas por ahi.
Lo único criticable es que es muy corto al igual que su antecesor, o sea que en aproximadamente una hora lo terminas al casi 100%. Esperaba que éste fuese un poco mas extenso, pero bueno.

Princess Remedy In A Heap of Trouble was developed and published by Ludosity and is a bullet hell, RPG type game. It is fairly short, but sweet game with a nice variety of enemies & abilities. If you're skeptical about buying this, go try out there other game [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/407900/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_1][b]Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt[/b][/url] which has all the basic mechanics as this game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Princess Remedy In A Heap of Trouble is a great retro, RPG game that has a unique gameplay style. The game is focused upon a young girl (Princess Remedy) who is trained to heal those who are hurt, and what a surprise that pretty much everyone in the world that she is in is hurt. Your objective is to heal all of those who are hurt in the world and to bring back peace to the world.

So first off lets talk about the main gameplay of the game and how you heal those who are in need. The way that you help these people is simple, talk to those who are in need and then defeat the enemies that are inside them... I'm guess their inside their mind or something but the game doesn't really clarify that. Defeating these enemies will heal the person and make them feel healthy again. It's not hard to tell that this is a different kind of RPG, which doesn't focus on the generic turn based battles but more of a kind of fast bullet hell style at times. You attack these enemies with pills that you shoot.

There is a nice variety of different kind of battle areas that you will come across when you are in battle, most if not all of the people have their own different battle areas. This makes for a nice variety of gameplay and the way that you handle the certain types of enemies that you may come across. As well as a nice variety of battle areas, you are also welcomed with a decent amount of enemies. Some of these enemies will just walk around not shooting, while others will constantly follow you and try to shoot at you. Needless to say you will have to adapt to your situation when battling.

When you heal these people they don't instantly become neglected throughout the game, you are able to bring them along with you. Now why would you do this? Well, each person that you heal has a special ability that you can use while defeating enemies and healing even more people throughout the game. The special ability can range from shooting faster to healing yourself, it seems that there is a decent amount of special abilities to choose from throughout playing the game.

As well as defeating normal enemies there are also a few bosses that you encounter before you move into a new area. These bosses are a nice break up from the regular enemies that you encounter because they have all have different fighting strategies that you will have to adapt to and defeat them.

It's probably also worth mentioning that the game is pretty short and only lasts about 1.5-2 (playing on the easiest difficulty and collecting everything) and the game tries to make up for that with 3 different difficulties. Unfortunately, the difficulties are just sped up versions of the same game, a little disappointing but still overall a decent little game.

One last quirky neat feature that I enjoyed was at the end of the game you could bring along any person that you had healed and take them on a date. It then brings you to like a guitar hero like mini game where you have to match the arrow keys. A nice little feature to end the game on.

I do love the graphics of the game, I have always loved more older retro games graphics they just seem to appealing to me. Although I do enjoy the graphics of this game, with their simplistic retro styled game I do feel like a little bit more time could've been put into them. For example, it is clear at times that your character is a single square with a single colour around your character and not transparent around your character. That's only a small thing about the game that I think could be slightly improved.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ A nice different kind of battling style
+ A variety of battle areas & enemies
+ Nice variety of special abilities
+ Generally great Retro styled graphics
+ Short (1.5+ hours) and sweet game
+ A nice & quirky ending

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Graphics seem to be coloured all around the square your character is in and not transparent
- The difficulties only increase the games speed to make it harder

[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]
Overall, this game is great a real Gem when it comes to retro styled bullet hell games. Although the game is short, it's well worth the price and you might even find yourself playing through the game multiple times. If you still feel skeptical about this game, then check out their other version of this game called [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/407900/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_1][b]Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt[/b][/url]. If you enjoyed that one then you will enjoy this one.

If not, go play that first. When you're done, come try this out.

The graphics are just a bit more artistic with the two-color per tile segment artstyle, which is also nice. And there's some new bullet types that keep things interesting.

On the downside, A Heap of Trouble feels a lot shorter, and now the shot powerups come specifically only from the bosses making it feel more like you're being gated rather than letting you explore and rewarding you for it. The dating system is interesting, but some flask types are definitely more useful than others. The writing also didn't feel as fun as the Wash-Olaf joke was omnipresent and run into the ground until it was fine specs of sand. And while the boss battles were interesting, there wasn't as much exploration with the normal battle enemy types and it just felt like there should've been more fights to really get some interesting stuff like A World of Hurt did.

My final thought is that overall A Heap of Trouble has the quality of a free game while A World of Hurt is worth the $3. The gameplay is just as fun though, so if you enjoyed A World of Hurt you definitely should pick up A Heap of Trouble.",1477202903,1477202903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In this game, the Princess is still romantically attracted to virtually everything in existence, but she's dating them to decide what special she gets during battle, as well as a fun scene at the end.

To those who don't know the original, this is an RPG with a battle mechanic like a bullet hell shooter that is supposed to represent 'healing' people by shooting the bejezus out of the physical embodiments of their problems, which sometimes aren't medical problems because this game is weird. Shooting happens automatically in the direction you're pointing, you move around a small arena with obstacles, you have a special power activated by virtually any button that has limited uses and depends on which NPC you are dating. There are bosses that mostly feel more like traditional shooter bosses and also freak me the hell out, causing me to shoot them even more enthusiastically to make them stop existing.

The game has very retro-style graphics and gameplay. I like it because the music is upbeat and the world is brightly coloured and fun, with a science fantasy feel to it. Virtually anything, including ducks, flowers, fires and doors, is self-aware and can speak, and therefore Princess Remedi is attracted to it. The humour gets extremely meta at times. This game gets compared with Undertale a lot but it feels like its own thing. 

The game is very short with one-sentence dialogues that are usually comedic, something that can bother people but in my experience doesn't affect play. There is a large leap between difficulty modes.

I really enjoyed ""Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt"", and got this game as soon as I could.

For its price, I think it's worth it.

The changes (gameplay-wise) from the prequel are
~The abilities you gain by dating someone
~You don't heal automatically; you have to shoot enemies which drains their health.
~Area Bosses

Overall, it's a noticeable improvement, both in graphics and gameplay. The world is more animated and colourful, and the enemies and attack patterns are a lot more varied. The dialogue and sprites are charming like the prequel. The change in the way you heal makes it a tad harder, as you can't heal over time by by just dodging. I enjoyed the challenge. The game also a slightly longer, as it took me more than 2 hours to complete (I had beat the original in just an hour.)

-The storyline was skippable for me
-Other than the boss battles, you could just brute force through the smaller ones

it's all the same type of shooting-them-up from the original game, but this time with added variety in the gameplay through the use of abilities gained through ""dating"" one NPC at a time, which replaces the flask system (although flasks work as the first game if you don't have a date).

the bosses are very interesting to see too; the first game only had one at the very end, although with some kickass music. the only thing this game was missing was some kickass boss music

overall this game is amazing and while some may say complain that it's the same length as the first in a single playthrough, i'm just glad i got to support this series as i absolutely adore it

101% completion (for those unaware):[spoiler]
[u]final final boss:[/u] after defeating the final boss and getting everything else (80 hearts, 5 power, 5 shot, 10 drain, 10 flask) take the eastern exit out of the dead garden. by the way: don't forget to look around for a hidden sign which reveals the bonus mode
  [u]jealous chest:[/u] to open the jealous chest, you must have not dated anyone before on that save file, meaning an all-flask run up to that point. it can be found in a secret area [i]within[/i] the secret area in the castle in moneyplace
[u]each is 1%, do both for 102%[/u][/spoiler]

everyone channel your energy to me so that i can defeat the other difficulty modes",1473426968,1473816975,True,14,12,0.610864937305450439,2,True,False,False,False,,,
