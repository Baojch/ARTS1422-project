This badly made GameMaker Studio template job is a craptastic pixeltrash platformer with a loose martial arts theme featuring a lot of hack and slash as well as your usual wall jumping, double jumping, hazard avoiding, and there's a minor ""adventure"" game element.  None of these individual factors is implemented remotely well.  It's the third of these from this developer and they're all practically the same game, the developer is just copying + pasting the same template, changing a few things around and pretending it's an entirely new game.  This kind of self-asset-flipping is just about as harmful to gamers as real asset flipping... multiple copy + pastes of one bad game is a lot worse than just one of them. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

Another problem here is that you can't alt+tab out of the game properly, another shortcoming that should have been picked up with even a basic amount of software testing.  This is extremely frustrating in the modern era of gaming and it's a shortcoming that gamers are unlikely to accept.  The game seizes the foreground and removes your ability to access your desktop, however you can get around this in Windows 11 by pushing the game to a secondary desktop... a frustrating workaround that was inflicted on gamers by this hamfisted development effort.

Bewilderingly, the game doesn't include proper audio controls, so you can't turn off the annoying background music, you'll need to alt+tab out and stop the music using the Windows sound mixer.  This is obviously not okay and it's unclear why the developers chose not to include this basic feature.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

PC gamers will be insulted by the demand from the developer that a console peasant children's toy controller should be used, despite this being on PC.  Developers should try to be aware which platform they're developing for, and must never, under any circumstances dictate to gamers how their games are to be experienced.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the GameMaker Studio construction kit/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset favoured by amateur developers as it's cheap and requires little in the way of development skill, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  GameMaker Studio is most commonly used to make retro pixel shovelware and cash grabs.

A strong argument can be made that construction kits like GameMaker Studio should never be used to make games for profit, as the ""developer"", Blaze Epic has done here.  These construction kits are intended to teach people some of the basic principles of game development, and to make small demos to pass around with friends.  They're not intended to replace to actual work of real, professional game developers.  So it's inappropriate when amateurs try to use these for profit, without any actual, real game development effort taking place.  This doesn't result in products that have any real meaningful value for gamers.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

""The Way of the Pixelated Fist"" didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for fighting ""Ling"", something that happens very early on in the game, trivial to get, but less than 25 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

The poor quality of this game is also reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 11 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

""The Way of the Pixelated Fist"" is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 9,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

I enjoyed the atmosphere of the game, which feels like a mix of Jet Set Radio and a Kung Fu flick, but the gameplay fell flat. Pixelated Fist tries to take from various game generes (parkour sim, fighter, and puzzle), but ultimately did each individual one poorly.

It fails to be a good parkour runner because the characters don't feel fast.  I would best describe it as feeling like you're running in slow motion.

In many area's you need pixel perfect precission, but the exact pixel to perform the action wasn't always clear.  Grabbable edges were the worse at this as aren't clearly marked.  This is incredbly frustrating during the puzzle challenges.

Pixelated Fist fails to be a good fighter because enemy telegraphs are so difficult to see.  This is probably due to the art style, but zooming in to these battles could have been an option, the game already crops out huge portions of unused screen real estate so it's not as if it doesn't have room.  

Pixelated Fist is incredibly easy.  Spamming kick, kick, high kick will get you through most of the battles, but cheesing your way through the game just makes the fighting segments a chore.",1547876687,1547876687,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: A 2015 release that chose, as its direct competitor, the 1989 original Prince of Persia, and comes out of the comparison looking none that better

Strongest weapon in its arsenal is out of the box support for Xbox 360 remote. It also has quite a fair bit more color to to the levels,and has frequent use of music. It introduces a variety of parkour moves that are not present in prince of persia and divides the action between dungeon-style levels in dojos that have death traps, then introduces a little bit of diversity while navigating to the next dojo, beating up some guys on the way, and solving a bunch of smaller easier parkour sections while travelling.

Things are not all rosey however. The game, despite the fairly complex lowkick highkick lowpunch highpunch block system that trumps prince of persia's simple swordfighting, has a noticeable input lag. Most noticeable in the combat actually, but also present during navigation, in by which if you press a key while another action is performed the key is flat out ignored. This is present to a less extent in prince of persia whom allowed change of directions on the fly. Also this game's combat is rather ridiculous, you can simply go punch punch kick, punch punch kick while going forward and you willl beat every foe every time.

The music changes when going from inside to outside locations but the sampling is very short and loops constantly. 

The colors are, well colorful, but prince of persia had a distinctive aesthetic with its nearly monochrome presentation only adding in the rare colored element into the mix. The soundblaster era sound effects were clearly superior on prince of persia's part. Prince of persia had fairly solid exposition with a cool intro and mysterious persia setting. The animation work in both game come a wash as The way of the Pixelated fist as great animation work for the characters, but prince of persia has a near motion-capture like quality to the way the animation translates muscle and body movement of the protagonist that is not quite captured here. The death traps in prince of persia had sound effects and looked a lot nicer, and most damning of all, this game just spawns you back at the beginning of a level with no death animation. Getting impaled, crushing your character and getting sliced in half was half the fun of prince of persia and seeing it omitted here seems like a great missed opportunity.

I could go on, but once you factor in the nostalgia factor. Prince of Persia 1989 comes out the winner hands down. Both games are equally frustrating in that you often know what you try to accomplish and struggle with the controls as you try to make it happen. Unfortunately the use of a controller did not help given the input lag, which prince of persia does not have but forces the user to suffer through a rather insane keyboard layout including arrow keys, shift and whatnot.

So in conclusion this is a really nice homage style game, I probably would had kept it around just for kicks, but after beating the first dojo I was unable to enter the following dojo for levels 8-16 I button mashed the Y button, and every other button and no dice. Maybe I am missing something but this game has very little exposition and story so I doubt I am missing a plot trigger.",1496973031,1509665596,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

fuck this game. COMBAT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE
I've played it for over 7 hours and I've come up with tree good things to say about it, the movement system is the perfect balance of realism and platforming, even interacting with other vertical walls and ""third"" walls. The animations are so much better, actually fluid and yet quick at the same time. the soundtrack is really a step up too... 3 things that are nice when the game is about platforming... so to the rest of it

remember the first games where fighting was very simple, but actually fun? remember the last game where combat was pretty much do anything to the red guys, keep the blue guys at a distance, and  mash and mash and mash against the ones that looked like underground fight club Rambo? well now its even worse. 

i dont know how this dev does it, WITH EACH GAME THE COMBAT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE. 
he struck gold with the combat in the first one: punchy, easy to use hard to master, every enemy had a different style and move set to take them down. 

then the second one where blocking was decided by a random generator, but you could still fight or fly over their heads

third game was bad, and had the fighting style listed above, but hey, it still had a blocking button!!!

with this game, the key-board and the controller comands are fucked AND THERE'S NO WAY TO CHANGE THEM (also a downgrade from jump Boxer).

with every game movement changes, and in the latest two COMBAT IS MANDATORY. the first one was a joy to fight in. second was less fighting and you could actually avoid entire groups of enemies, and hey in the last one did i mention the blocking function; i know it was half way functional!!!

let me tell you what this game is: its a nut shot simulator. no way to block or avoid it, you can run away all you want but sooner or later the enemies will pin your sorry ass down, with no blocking function, and blitz you into the pavement. then it really turned into nut-shot-sim when i found out that the farthest reaching move in the game was the standard kick and i started mashing more acorns than an august bound produce salesman!

im completely serious! it looks and feels like a kick in the balls any time that you are fighting.

the last straw came when i got lost. yes that's right in this balls to the wall, ball slapping, ball-APA!-loose-ah didn't even give me a hint.

and you need those hints to get into the now HIDDEN and partially LOCKED challenge courses.

see i seem to remember friendly NPC's in these games that would strike up conversations and tell you where to go or plot stuff... ""well, those were in earlier games""...DAMN RIGHT THEY WERE IN EARLIER GAMES!!!!! AND THIS CONSTANT DOWNGRADE IN QUALITY WAS FINE AS LONG AS A SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT WAS AT STAKE! in every game from this developer so far there has been the perfect balance of stuff to make me want to keep going. the game play, the movement system, and the visuals and the mood played off of each-other in the past. but no, not here; the insanely crap combat and confusing map design and stripping away key features DESTROYS the presence of the better qualities of this game

which leads me to the plot:
game 1- master's dead and them supernatural gangsters are trying to kill you
game 2- you mysteriously come back to life and get these epic platforming skills
game 3- your a free runner in china and start halucinating that ancient chinese martial artists are trying to kill you

this game- your part of some weird martial arts gang that is now testing all the free runners on the roofs with mortal kombat style arena fighting and platforming challenges. beat bosses and stuff to get hints once. thats right, one single hint which is actually easy to skip because of all the button mashing you need to do in order to survive!

no, don't have the bosses repeat directions, this isn't like a majorly confusing repetitive pain in the crotch, or anything...

not to mention 1 boss that i fought (and managed to not skip his dialogue) said ""the door above me is now unlocked""... IT FUCKING WHAT!? there aren't any doors next to this guy! and there is no path leading directly up a few stories either. after mapping it out, my confusion was only strengthened by the fact that there are FOUR DOORS AROUND HIM!
1 IS PRACTICALLY TO THE EAST and the rout to get there ISN'T really UPWARD
and 3 are so far UP across the map, you might as well have put a door directly above the boss arena JUST TO SAVE TIME!!!
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER BOSS ARENA THAT IN FACT DID HAVE THAT ARRANGEMENT!
so the dialogue is either in the wrong place, or this level design of one door to the east and all the others being too far away and too hard/tedious to get to is FUCKING RETARDED!!!

if you as the developer do end up seeing this: do you know how to make games like this better
  (1) a map, or some system of navigating. samurai_jazz was sprawling and complex, but anyone with half a brain could navigate it because it made sense, and was plotted (seemingly like real architecture). shin samurai jazz and jump boxer got away with janky architecture because puzzles and key hunting was usually confined to one area or a hub of some kind
  (2) a block function that actually works. in the last two games, the block function doesn't even partially work for ""off hits"" and the characters have no split second wind up... this would be bad enough, but most of the enemy fight moves require you to press either up or down with the block button to work. i can understand up for high kicks and down for sweeps and grappling but all kicks require down and all punches require you to press up!? well at least the special moves don't require an up or down modifier, but if there's not at least 2 or three frames of ""telegraphing"" for each attack, then the directional modifier is useless and this one is unfair and sadistic... se nut shot simulator quote above
  (3)friendly NPC's and defeated bosses that repeat what they say... maybe some vending NPC's selling drinks or T-shirts...
  (4) make some real fighting controls. done

as for the players: if you want to know how to succeed then here are the final tips: (1) draw a map (or go to the guide section for this game and look at mine). get on microsoft paint and draw a fucking map of screen shots, even if the geometry makes no sense. (2) record all boss fights. the combat is mash heavy, and the IMMEDIATE text dumps are not a good way to communicate information THAT YOU CAN NEVER ACCESS AGAIN.

I finally beat this wanna-be free roaming mortal kombat in 2d, but only after 5 hours of playing while i was mapping it out. after an hour of the 3 previous games i was hooked. this beautifully animated mess just felt like another kick in the balls!
every time i got lost or saw more than 1 enemy on the screen: WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

WAS THAT CLEAR AT ALL? GOOD!

... i know im about a year or two too late, but how did you release this game in this state?

i'm just going to spoil it here THE ENDING SUCKS!!!
the gang of free running MK enthusiasts put you in challenge courses and they test you with strange alien teleporter drones, and in the last locked zone: they boss rush you and are so impressed with your fighting they say you can join the club, then everyone goes out for dinner... the ending wasn't even worth it... 

it feels like blase was going for some kind of mortal kombat mythologies thing... and the ending wasn't even a real good mind fuck. after that boss rush, i was expecting it to turn out that you were joining some alien street gang or it was all really a means of recruiting informants for the CIA or something.

sorry blaze... your product still needs a lot of work. funny how the smaller in scope, simple in design, and attention in detail world of _jazz is still a better waste of time than this one... but still samurai_Jazz, shin...jazz, and jump boxer were good in their own ways, here's hoping for the next one...",1461227043,1494559605,False,3,0,0.501255333423614502,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game, is way more foccused on precision: you characther require's room to jump, change direction, he has some weight to him. I appreciate that, a lot. At the beggining it feels kinda jenky, but is pretty tight, which is my jam.
  What's also my jam is that while the controls are really simple, the combination of what you do and the way you do it gets really complex. You gotta calculate well when to jump, memorize and apply the timming of your punchs and kicks, and again, after a while, it's second nature.
  And the combat is really cool. Imagine if the first double dragon was more slow and thoughtfull. It's really fun testing stun timmings, moves' range and dash speed to make killer combos.

  But it's no all a love affair: the open world of this game is confusing, with lots of buildings that look the same you get easily lost; which is odd, the shapes of the buildings are what tells you what parkour habilities you can use, colours don't affect it:buildings could have different windows, colours and posters to differenciate then. Also, considering that there's a some impossible space going on(or so does it feel), it's weird that the world can't be a straigth line with one or two valleys.

  And the killing flaw is really problematic: the doors that leads to the chambers (challenge levels required to beat the game) some times simply don't open. Is it a bug? I thought it was either a previous chamber that I didn't complete or a npc I've missed, but one the doors, just one, told me I haven't complete the previous chamber; why didn't that message popped in the other doors?
   
  I really liked what I've played so far, but to continue is a risk: either I find out what was wrong with the doors and keep having fun, or I don't, and get increasilying frustated, and start to hate this ""to be game"" that I've loved.

It's also one of the most boring ones, though.

Let's start out with: The combat system is TERRIBLE. Clunky and basic, broken and really easy. I died maybe twice in combat rooms throughout the entire game.
But.. the dev does not seem to be aware of how bad the combat system is. There are so many rooms with just 2 or 3 basic enemies, 4 or 5 boss fights that are basically exactly the same, an entire dungeon dedicated to the combat system, and a few rooms in the last dungeon as well. It's... bad. It's mind-numbingly boring.

The platforming itself is interesting, though a bit broken. And a bit clunky in general. Yeah, still feels really retro in the worst ways. There's a wall-jump you can do off background objects that I could never get to work consistently, but it makes for decently interesting platforming when it does work. Three of the main dungeons and part of a fourth have some gimmicks to them, spikes and buttons, a bit of stealthy stuff. It's decent fun, not amazing.

The overworld map is a giant loop with one major split path, and yes, there's a lot of backtracking throughout. You have to find one of the overworld bosses to enter one of the first four dungeons, some of which are a ways away from their boss, and then you have to find a fifth and short sixth dungeon after. I ended up going around basically the entire map three times trying to find all the bosses and with all the mandatory backtracking. It... should've just been linear, honestly.

This isn't as frustrating a game as most of the blazeepic games I've played, I'll at least say that, but it isn't really worth your time nor money. The developer seems content to remaking the same mediocre game over and over without much variation between each iteration, which I think is a bit pointless to do. Yeah, the sprites and animations here are a bit better and it never really feels unfairly difficult, at least, but it's still not too fun to play overall.",1448483625,1448483625,False,0,0,0.495867788791656494,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Mixing [i][b]Prince of Persia[/b][/i] with [i][b]Mirror’s Edge[/b][/i], a Sega’s Master System color palette with NES tight controls, [i][b]Another World[/b][/i]’s influences with [i][b]Yie Ar Kung-Fu[/b][/i], a Radiohead inspired soundtrack with Bruce Lee’s awesomeness. A raised in the 80s kid’s warm dream that confirms Larry Stover as one of the most distinctive creators in the indie scene since Nicklas Nygren alias [i][b]“Nifflas”[/b][/i][/h1]

If [i]The Way of the Pixelated Fist[/i] would have been published in the early 90s, it would have become one of my favorite games as a child. With its wise combination of frames extracted from 80’s hallucinatory martial arts movies, mixed with all the elements that made me love videogames.

Its creator Larry Stover works with the same philosophy as a DJ, using a sampler structure to create remixes of old beloved classics with a contemporary approach.

The game takes a clear inspiration from influential cinematic plattformers like [i]Prince of Persia[/i] or [i]Another World[/i], but while you are doing almost impossible jumps through the city skyline, you can feel this same sense of awesomeness of being playing [i]Mirror’s Edge[/i]. Its color palette resembles past Sega’s Master System games, but the minimalist approach taken in its graphic design is used to create a relaxed mood that evokes Nifflas classics such as [i]Knytt[/i]. Its combat parts are a homage to Jordan Mechner’s first creation, [i]Karateka[/i], that was the precursor to [i]Prince of Persia[/i], but its tight and accurate controls are more close to Konami’s [i]Yie Ar Kung-Fu[/i]. There is jumping parts that requires the same millimetric precision as the original [i]Prince of Persia[/i], but its controls are so responsive as modern indie plattformers. There is automatic checkpoints in every new screen visited, but to save the game you need to access the menu, like in the old PC titles. Its graphic style suggest old 8 bits titles, but its soundtrack has a modern drum’n’bass tempo with a floating line of melancholic keyboards that looks at Thom Yorke’s solo works 

You can feel this contrast and amalgam of influences also in its animations. The combats are inspired in classic Kung-Fu movies, so you can expect a lot of frames of animation, with every enemy infused with life and transmitting a constant sense of movement. But its jumping parts looks directly to contemporary deviations of the martial arts film genre, such as Ang Lee’s [i]Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon[/i] or Zhang Yimou’s [i]House of Flying Daggers[/i]. So these animations are intentionally static, with the main character floating suspended in the air.

But the most distinctive part of [i]The Way of the Pixelated Fist[/i] is its original reinterpretation of the cinematic term applied to videogames. Instead of drawing all the screen, [i]The Way of the Pixelated Fist[/i] opts for showing its world from a camera angle perspective. Like if every shot was filmed by an invisible fixed camera, an then mutilated in the editing room by a schizophrenic and highly experimental filmmaker. This aesthetic approach submerges the game in a distant halo of unreality. And seeing other past games from Larry Stover like [i]Samurai Jazz[/i], seems as a characteristic trait that surrounds an immense part of his works.

This fragmented visual approach creates one of the most controversial gameplay features in [i]The Way of the Pixelated Fist[/i]. Because all the city’s main map is connected in an illusory loop. And the mutilated film frames only serve to increase the confusion and disorientation in the player. Resulting in an experience similar to watch some of the most experimental movies by David Lynch, in the vein of [i]Mulholland Drive[/i] or [i]Inland Empire[/i]. With the concepts of time and space being heavily distorted.

Personally, in a game that lasts for 4 hours, I don’t dislike the idea of being an entire hour completely lost. There is something hypnotic in describing constant circles through the city while you are doing gravity defying jumps in this Larry Stover’s hallucination. And I really appreciate that he has dared to make a game with this level of personality, which is so far from all of its contemporaries.

Luckily, the 6 levels that we can access through the main map are single screen based and they use a lineal construction. Every set of chambers completely changes the focus of the gameplay. One set is based in the original [i]Prince of Persia[/i], using the same color palette and the same ground spike traps. Another set has a modern stealth approach, with robotic eyes that will shoot laser rays if they are able to detect us. And in its level structure, Larry Stover shows a lot of talent as a game designer. With a perfect difficulty curve not based in the frustration.

I feel so fascinated with [i]The Way of the Pixelated Fist[/i], that I can’t wait to discover the rest of the games created by Larry Stover. One of these rare artists that is able to sculpt unique and distinctive universes surrounding his games. And with a certain sense of coherence between his different works. Thanks to his postmodernist approach to the martial arts genre, taking influences from the Nouvelle Vague, from Tarantino’s reconstruction of classic genres or from the characteristic contemplative gaze found in Jim Jarmusch’s films.
