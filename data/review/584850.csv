Исходный обзор ниже -----------

Это похоже на пасьянс Windows, за исключением нескольких дополнительных опций. Во-первых, у них есть несколько разных фонов виртуальной реальности, и большинство из них действительно хорошо сделано. Так получится красивый живописный вид. Для одиночной игры есть пасьянс из 1 или 3 карт. И есть Power Solitaire для многопользовательской игры. Мне не довелось раскладывать пасьянс силы, но пасьянс соло такой же, как я его помню, только в VR.

Я не могу сказать, что игра лучше, чем Windows Solitaire, но она просто лучше, потому что она в VR, и вы действительно можете использовать свой контроллер движений для перемещения карт, так что она просто более захватывающая. Моя единственная претензия - это то, что внутриигровая музыка могла бы быть более разнообразной. Хотя игра выглядит и работает отлично. Он даже идет в ногу с историей ваших игр.

Мне пришлось задержаться, чтобы сменить положение, чтобы колода карт появилась в начале. Не уверен, что это была ошибка.

Original review below -----------

This is exactly like Windows Solitaire, except with a few more options.  First of all, they have several different VR backgrounds and most of them are really well done.  So you get a nice scenic view.  There's 1 card draw or 3 card draw solitaire for solo play.  And there's Power Solitaire for multiplayer.  I didn't get to play power solitaire but the solo solitaire is exactly as I remember it, only in VR.  

I can't say the game is better than the Windows Solitaire, but it just feels better because it's in VR and you actually get to use your motion controller to move cards around so it just feels more immersive.  My only complaint is that the in-game music could have more variety.  The game looks and runs perfectly though.   It even keeps up with your game history.

I did have to hold on to change change position for the deck of cards to show up at the start.  Not sure if that was a bug.

The gameplay mechanics are good, all the fun of playing with a real deck of cards, combined with the joy of not having to deal/shuffle them manually for each game.

Not great for prolonged game sessions though as the height-adjustable table requires that you spend a lot of time looking downwards to see the cards, straining through the weight of the headset (Vive) and the blurry edges of the lenses.

Would be great to see more varied environments and perhaps the choice of a custom/workshop-powered skybox?

Some improvements I'd suggest:

- allow the play table to angled in front of the user
- be more forgiving with throwing cards to the stacks at the top
- allow the deck to be repositioned so you don't have to stretch over the play area

　　这种游戏对于VR化而言的意义并不是很大。尽管游戏制作了一个全沉浸式的游戏世界让玩家体验这种在虚拟世界中玩牌的乐趣，但是互动性依旧不高，只能叹谓可惜。
　　也许在将来，玩家可以在VR世界中进行“面对面”的打牌，这种玩法的优点才会被真正地体现出来吧。
　　总而言之，这款游戏的制作还不错，玩法简单，唯一的遗憾就是沉浸感不太高，喜欢这种游戏，又不在乎沉浸感的朋友们可以考虑入手。

there really needs to be a way to move the table around AFTER you have started a game. i can recenter the view, but not move the table, or rather if i can, i cant figure out how to do it.

but, if you want to play solitaire in vr, this is the only game in town, and it does it reasonably well, so its hard to go wrong for two bucks.",1485987875,1485987875,True,12,0,0.682427763938903809,4,True,False,True,False,,,
