Heroes Rise is one of my favorite CYOA games, but I couldn't bring myself to finish Redemption Season. It's just so boring. 

The Good
-Interesting premise. You play as a new character, who is ani-powered. Fans of the first trilogy will remember these are the outcast powereds. Deals with the social issues of being ani-powered. Has the makings of a Magneto-like character.  
-You're trying to win the favor of this mysterous healer-type character to help your sister. For unknown reasons, the healer wants you to do well in the Hero Project. Healer will provide secrets to aid you in the competition.  
-You usually have 3-6 good options, makes it hard to decide what to choose. 
-There are references to your decisions from the 1st trilogy, and the consequences of those decisions. 

The Bad 
-The mechip warning system. It's so annoying and unnecessary. In the first trilogy you could customize it with a unique personality. It would fill you in on the lore and immerse you in the story. In this game it just makes wisecracks that aren't even funny. 
-So much text and fewer choices than in previous trilogy. You have to get through walls of text, then when you finally get to make a choice it has no effect on the game. 
-Story can get depressing, and coupled with fewer choices it can feel like you're not doing anything to change that. 
-Surprised by how slow paced this was compared to the author's other works. Reads like a first draft. 
-I quit when I ""unlocked a new character"". Suddenly you're playing this other character, who makes decisions that affect your character's stats. It was just so jarring, weird, confusing, unnecessary, and didn't work for me. 

Final Verdict
-I would not recommend this. Although it references the 1st trilogy, it does not continue the story. It's a new story set in the same universe, you don't need to play it.",1527212275,1527212275,False,5,0,0.518127620220184326,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The second game of the series was fantastic, and the reality show design works wonderfully with the choice-of-games format.

The previous series tackled standing up for your poor neighborhood and the misunderstood anipowered as a side-plot, where this game has this weird message about how media underrepresentation leads to terrorism, and that the media is truly at fault. I'm serious, it's not subtext either, it is spelled out over and over again. We're not even given many examples -of- the prejudice, just told it exists. Besides the ani-powered prejudice, none of the other prejudices were ever even mentioned in the previous three games.

At first you're given some options to say ""I don't care about this stuff I just want to take care of my family"" but as the game goes on your character is forced to ""realize they were wrong"" and start pushing identity politics activism. There is a part where you have to choose between two characters to vote out and one of them was the dreaded handsome white male while the other was a non-binary, overweight (in human form), human/zombie/werewolf vampire and I thought the non-binary character was an overly hostile jerk who provoked and judged people for no reason so I voted ""ze"" out. The game went out of my way to tell me at every turn that I was wrong for doing so (not by making the other guy do something evil or by revealing I had been tricked or something but by straight up telling me I had made the ""wrong"" choice). I was not allowed to choose my character's motivation for this vote. It was defaulted in his thoughts to ""I was too scared to stand up for underrepresented rights."" It's a real shame since there are some genuinely interesting characters under all that such as the MC's sister and a plot that has the potential to be interesting.

A lot of other users have already summed up the game quite well, therefore I'm only gonna summarize the main flaws of the game:

- Zach Sergi injecting his personal political opinions heavily into the writing
- Player is forced to become an SJW, as trying to stay out of it in any way earns a ""Game Over""
- Player's powers constantly and uncontrollably shift for a rather vague reason that isn't explained terribly well (again, to reinforce the author's emphasis on social justice because this new player character [hereafter referred to as PC] is ""non-binary"")
- A lot of the characters are pretty forgettable, as the author intentionally forced them into different categories in order to usher the PC into a social cause (eliminating the option to avoid all the political drama). The only somewhat interesting character is written off just as things looked like they were getting good.

Apparently, as one user commented, Sergi isn't receptive to criticism. What made Heroes Rise interesting to read through was because of the focus on doing heroic deeds while managing relationships on the side and putting political issues in the background (which didn't really affect the story in any major way). The Hero Project is one boring, in-your-face SJW exposition rather than an actual story about a noble personal quest.

I really enjoyed the other games in this series but this one is just way too preachy for me. The author trys to shove his poltical stance down your throat. If you make a decsion not in line with his vision of the world the game condems you for it. This isn't how an enjoyable game is made. Sure you can punish the player for making gameplay mistakes like using a fire sword against a boss who heals from fire damage. However to punish the player for his or her opinion makes your game like a self righteous jerk. In the previous games you could tell the author leaned a certain way on the poltical spectrum but he didn't make the stroy revolve around it.

It's decently written, but it's also the most preachy thing i've ever read.

This? it just wants you to see the author's views and makes sure they're always present.

The other glaring issue, is the fact that although you direct what your character is, you lose all customisation. What happened to being able to fine tuen the colour of your beams and your costume? Instead of this, you're given different looks for each day to further represent the writer's beliefs.

The author always had a tendency to stray heavy into politics with his books, and this time I believe he finally hit the extreme. There is very little hero’ing in this game, but a lot of talk about discrimination of the physically disabled. None of it is particularly subtle, and while it wasn’t all that bad, I don’t feel like ever reading through all of it ever again. 

Which is a bit of a shame, because everything else is pretty damn neat. Your character is forced to make some pretty hard decisions, and I found myself quite attached to the persona I have crafted for the game. The story is engaging, and I certainly enjoyed it, even if it wasn’t what I was expecting. I certainly don’t regret buying and reading it, and seeing how Zachary (the author) managed to cut down on the obvious preaching in Versus book that followed this one, I’m looking forwards to the continuation of the series. 

That being said, the author seriously needs to stop with the cliffhangers. The main plotline is nowhere near resolved by the end of the book, and we’re already teased with the next main plotline. I guess it fits the theme (constant crises that plague every comic book series in existence), but it’s getting a bit old by now.  I’ll revisit this review later if the series jumps the shark, but for now, as stated earlier – a very careful recommendation. 6,5/10

Only in the orginal triology, is about the powered and the non-powered, and in this story is about the ani-powered, and the other more acceptable powered. The former issue is easier to accepet, in fact a lot of superhero comics have been talking about it for quite a long time. The latter, however, is more like the homosexual marriage issue, to most people is not that big deal, and if you spend nearly all the time talking about it, people will be angry, like what we can see in the comment section.

But is this story worth recommending? I guess it is. Though the author always tries to preach his ideas about social justice, you can somehow still focused on saving your sister's life without giving your efforts away for some petty injustices. Although eventually you will be forced back to caring more for the ani-powered because your sister always has been an equality advocater, it wasn't awkward.

Negetive;

The Decisions:
Is not as diverse in this game compared to the earlier three. Many of the 'negative' choices so to speak that existed in the earlier ones are not present here, even though some still do. Basicaly the game feels more linear then the other games, no matter how i play it dose not seem to affect me as much as it would have done in past games.

The Characters:
I'm not going to lie but the characters are very interesting..but very hard to see. Let me explain, in past games it was pretty easy to fantisize how the caracter looked like just from the brief descriptions of them, here that is not nearly enough, i'm personally almost unable to imagine how most of the characters look like, the descriptions mostly leaved me confused. 
This can have many reasons but i think two things play in, the Author as well as the Setting, in this game you play the 'Weirdest of the Strangest' many of the characters are supposed to look weird and strange to the degree that is is hard to describe them...sadly i think the author simply has taken bite too big to chew, maybe someone with more experiance when it comes to describing aperences could have offered help.

Possitive;

The characters:
As hard it is to imagine the characters apearences, they are still very interesting, especilly the main characters (as in you, the player, and the main characters sister!) and the situation/scenario you are stuck in. Also the fact that the main character constantly changes powers is an interesting twist, in the other games you quickly got used to using some powers (and thus became better at using them) you where more sure on what strategy to use and far your powers could take you, not as sure any longer in this game, making it both harder and more intense not being sure how powerfull/powerless and Stable/unstable your powers are.
It's fun..and hard at the same time, a good twist!

The Story:
Is not as awesome as in the other games, but still really good! An interesting twist that the main character is now a part of the Lower Class, adding a lot more of the 'Class Struggle/War' into the scenario! I only wish you had added more of that into the game, maybe they will in comming episodes, i hope!

Takes a while to find its footing.

Details: as a huge fan of the original trilogy, I immediately bought Redemption Seaon. Although it drops you into the action, a large amount of text slows you down considerably at the start. As you slog through some exciting sequences, the action then stops to a crawl and continues so for a while as the author not only introduces you to the new characters but bashes over the head ad naseum with the book's take on prejudice against certain aspects of the  superhuman community (Ani's, Disembodied, Morphs, and in general those who don't look like your standard Greek god/goddess).

What should be an interesting new viewpoint from the more standard (if fun and glamorous) superhero fare of the first trilogy and build a strong foundation instead blankets the story in a heavy weight. I kept waiting for the lecturing to stop and the plot /action to begin. That, along with a long wait before you can start individlualizing your character and a constantly changing power set/appearance, led to a disconnect between myself and viewpoint character that led me to put the book down for over a month.

The action is much lighter with far fewer battles than the earlier books but what is there works well enough. The exception is a well-written final battle that raises the stakes, introduces unique villains, and instills a sense of dread. It's over too quickly and easier than anticipated but these are minor quibbles give its otherwise slick execution. Hopefully we will see more action in the sequel.

The book is best when it focuses away from its heavy reliance on the heavy-handed prejudice storyline to focus on the characters who well drawn and layered. Even the final badguys have a shocking backstory twists that paints them and the theme of prejudice in a new light. 

I would also criticize the early attempt to force your character to take a strong stance one way or another. By not doing so, I was eliminated early despite doing reasonably well in the competition. It discourages readers from exploring who their character might be and might become as they learn about their new storyline. In trying to stand out early, you may (as I did) define your character in a way that you will later regret.

Final Summary: the book is a frankenstein of sorts: half Prodigy and half Hero Project. It suffers from a very slow setup in the beginning and only partial progression through the title's ""Redemption Season."" Although it has a strong climax, that the new season of the Hero Projection has far to go may be unsatisfying for some. The GOOD news is that it sets up for a better second book, just as the fine Hero Rises Prodigy set the stage for the even better Hero Project. Also, while the plot is slow with a heavy-handed theme, the characters are as interesting and enthralling as ever.

I've only played a few, but these are among the best storytelling I've ever seen, no matter the media.
Second, I played the Heroes Rise trilogy, and I loved every moment of it. So I had rather high expectations about Redemption Season, as the sequel to one of my new favorite licence.

And I was kind of scared, seeing this only rated as ""Variable"" (in French), compared to the other games, which all have received really good reviews.

I just completed my first run, achieving almost the best score of Legend possible, and I'll most certainly replay it.

I get why so many peoples seems disappointed in this episode. ** minor spoiler here ** As some said, the game revolve heavily around the segregation among the Powered, and mostly toward Ani Powered, Morpho Powered and Disembodied. And some find you actually barely see it in game. I completely agree. Though, it's a logical and good narrative choice. Inside of the Hero Project, heroes are secluded and receive as less as possible informations from the ""outer world"" (like in most reality show). It's actually only logical, that you can't go on the streets and see this by yourself. ** end of spoiler **

As usal, the narrative is extremely good, the story really got me to actually care deeply for characters, a thing that happens more than often with Choices of Game, and particularly Heroes Rise. So far, in my opinion, it's the storyline that offer exchanges with the most characters (and they're all unique and deep). I'm kind of discouraged by some aspects of the story, for personnal reasons. As such, would I rate it as my favorite narrative game? No. The first trilogy of Heroes Rise is still too fresh to let its place goes. But it's by far one of the best I played (as a text based game), and a top tier game in general (still in my opinion, obviously).

Plus side: if you've played the first trilogy, many informations about what has been going on behind the scene can be foud here and there. To me, it explained a lot of situations I found rather dubious, and seems a bit more logical now. If you have one, I highly recommand to load one of your previous game, seeing the consequences of your choices and getting news from your previous self (and his/her group) is really a plus.

However in the end I found the prospect of a cameo from my hero, Specs, in a new series too hard to resist so I took the plunge and gave the redemption series a try. I am very glad I did.

strangely, depending on your perspective, this could be both the strongest and most flawed entry in the heroes rise series. After playing it I can certainly see why there is a split between positive and negative reactions. While the negative reviews are not without merit, I can safely say that the flaws they highlight are not as severe as they make it seem.

Let's get right into it: There are definitely author tracs in this game. Heroes Rise has always been a particularly progressive series and issues of discrimination and underrepresented persons are obviously very important to the author. While these themes have always been present in ther series,  In The Redemption Project, they are now a dominant element of the story. Fans who just want a superhero/scifi adventure might find themselves disappointed with these political issues being so prominent this time. There's still plenty of superheroic action sequences and reality show drama to be enjoyed, but they now share equal stagetime with your character grappling these issues.

While these issues don't feel out of place, since the game has given you a main character who is practically guaranteed to have a reason to care about them at least a little, there are points where I couldn't help but feel the game was lecturing me a bit. These segments aren't nearly as jarring as when it happened in Heroes Rise: The Hero Project, but this is still a game that needs you to meet it halfway more then any of the others did since while in the previous series you had a rather typical comicbook superhero with a familiar backstory, this time you have a superhero with an unusual powerset that is also heavily disenfranchised. So even though your hero is still quite customizable, unless you are an underrepresented person yourself, you might find it'll take more effort on your end to care about your character and put yourself in their shoes than in the previous series. At least I found it took a little while for me, but once I did I became utterly hooked.

This game is bigger and longer then any of the previous in the series. The interesting, well developed characters that have a way of forcing you to care about them and hard decisions that I've come to expect from this series are all still here. (in fact I get the sense that the writer has actually improved quite a bit!) There were several times when I was faced with a decision that was so tough that I had to stop playing and leave my chair to really think about what I wanted my character to do, which has always been my favorite part of this series. The writing, characters, and the game's ability to present you with tough choices that make you second guess yourself after making them are the biggest strengths here and I found myself even more engaged by them then I was even in the previous series.

The biggest weakness has been touched on in other reviews, at a few points I had the game wagging its finger at me a bt regarding some of the choices I have made. One was when another character was explaining how they are forced to sacrifice their ideals to survive in the competition and I was presented with 2 previous ""bad"" choices my character could use to realize how him and this other character are alike, and 1 previous ""good"" choice that he could use to reflect on how he acted differently. The other instance was near the end where a character with similar ideals as my main character railed into me for falling short by voting the way I did in an elimination. For a game about choice it feels weird to be judged in this way, and I don't know if it was due to the choices I made early on but I definitely felt nudged in a certain direction, particularly when my character had an epiphany and became highly motivated to start breaking down barriers near the end of the game. Personally though I thought it was alot of fun for the game to confront me about my earlier decision like that. It was an opprotunity for my character to realize that while he is still confident that he made the right call, it was still very much not a perfect decision, and he is not perfect either. There are no easy answers here.

The bottom line is that I came into the Redemption Season expecting myself to not like it and I was very surprised to find that it is actually now my favorite of the entire series. If you are a fan of heroes rise I definitely recommend giving this one a shot, if only just to see if you end up liking it as much as I did. It's definitely a bold and different direction from the previous games but alot of what made them great is still here and I found myself warming up to the new elements as i got more invested in the story and the new main character. However, If you are new to the series, I recommend trying the previous trilogy first.

I'm currently playing this and just had a cab driver refuse to pick me up and speed off because I have animal powers, so he immediately assumed I was a gang member. That's only one example out of many.

What most gamers fail to realize is that with text based games like these, if you can't let your own imagination carry the story than you're better off not reading it.

All the new characters are great and you very quickly get a feel about how they are. The choices presented are also very excellent and the stats which you can select from are very good and it isn't hard to figure out which choices to take if you want to continue in a specific direction like it was in the first trilogy.

I really love interactive novels where the reader forwards the plot by conscious decisions. Also I really like the superhero genre. The preceding trilogy, Hero's Rise, was great.

However THP:RS falls flat. Somehow heroic deeds of superheroes are only second to the social commentary. Social commentary per se are nothing bad. But here it feels artificial and academic. You are being told that people are oppressed several times, but this oppression rarely is ever shown. A dystopian scenario with real oppression like slavery, forced labor, ghettos would have been a wonderful basis for a ""rise to greatness"" superhero story, where the hero manages to actually change something.

Instead the ""oppression"" is constantly talked about in sermon-like expositions and seems oddly out-of-character and out-of-place.

Ironically for a game that for a good part deals with identification, it is rather hard to identify with the main character. The hero powers are a great idea per se, but the daily changes are so radical, it's as if the MC constantly changes with them. Also, in a game where you want to drive the plot with your decisions how the MC should act, it is very obvious that the MC is often ""nudged"" into the ""right way"". If you don't walk that path, it could lead to punishment and a dissatisfying resolution.

All in all, I'm missing the superhero story here, with all the cheese and stereotypes from the superhero genre. Conluding: I really can't recommend this game, as my high hopes after the really good first trilogy were not met.

A similar interactive novel from Choice of Games from the superhero genre which I do recommend is: Community College Hero: Trial by Fire. Check that out instead!

So, here goes:

THP: Redemption Season is one of those games where I feel like it was expressly built to be part of a series. I see it as an introductory game in many ways - it introduces a huge number of characters and concepts, not the least of which being your own character. However, this often means there's a bit of information overload. Since it is, technically, a new series that builds off the old one, this is something veterans of the world will have to endure. Perhaps most prominently is the tone that is set by the author - your character is just scraping by financially and has experienced discrimination rather heavily. Whether that leads you to becoming an activist or a recluse (or neither, but you are rewarded for sticking to one path) is something you decide in game. Many of the people you interact with have been discriminated against in some way or another, and there's a lot of clashing subcultures and personalities. It makes for an interesting dynamic, though there are times in which, as other reviewers noted, this comes across as over the top (or in their words, preachy). Personally, it wasn't much of a big deal to me - I saw it more as representation and the author writing from the perspective of a disenfranchised main character. However, it is worth noting for other people who may be made uncomfortable with those sorts of things.

Overall, I enjoyed the game, the characters, and the writing, but like all things there are flaws that take away from the experience. I would certainly recommend THP: Redemption Season, but only with the warning that it is most definitely an introduction to this new series and can, at times, feel more like an introduction than a full game. Still, I am very excited for the next part, which should be coming out sometime early 2017.",1467253049,1467253049,True,4,0,0.562137067317962646,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I bought the novel straightaway once I've found out that it was released.

But I was kind of surprised that there were a lot of negative reviews about it, so I read it right away.

And I find that its actually not that bad as what other people in the reviews say it to be.
But then again, I guess its not for everyone.

If you can go pass the vibe that this story is strongly promoting political advocacies and propaganda, then you'll find that its bearable and you can sympathize with the situations and environment of the characters.

Personally,  I think the main reason as to why this story revolves or focuses so much on that particular political agenda (I dont want to name it, in case I spoil anyone) is because it just wants you to be familiarized with what's happening in MC and how it would set the tone for the later sequels when they come out.

But, in any case, overall, I still find it very good and entertaining! Not as good as the first trilogy, but still, this is the first book in The Hero Project, so maybe its too early to make any judgments.

It tackled issues on psychologoical behaviour of individuals and the ever-present discrimination of people of different nationalities and ethnicities(politically and sociologically correct term for races when referring to humans). I can relate to Zachary Sergi much more deeply now that I have read the four books of his Heroes Rise universe. To tell the truth, I only played these games just to pass time, but then I got so hooked up in all the representations of human society packed together with fantastical plots and characters. I have to admit, even though I have my own set of ideals and beliefs, Zachary Sergi ended up reenforcing these ideals and renewing my perception of society and my morals as an individual. As a social science student, I can understand and appreciate the scenarios presented to the player with each choice he makes. These may be a few of the many novels and books that actually tackle social issues with clear stands and clear support for ideals.

I enjoyed the first trilogy, and I like Redemption Season so far as well. I want to encourage the writers and developers to keep on 'keepin' on' with this series.

Pros:

I enjoy the fact that you can carry over your character choices from game to game, and I like the fact that you can see the results of the first trilogy's events played out in Redemption.

I like the stat system and mechanics as well as the fact you don't have to grind stats as you do in some novel-style games. 

The plot and setting are engaging, and the concept sparks my interest. 

I picked up a Danielle Steele novel the other day and found it remarkably boring compared to the action-packed writing you have here, which could either be a testiment to the game's good writing or a reflection of my own warped taste.  

The concept behind the reader's character (their powers and background story) is interesting for me.

I am a long-time fan of choose your own adventure stories. I like being in control of the story's direction. Plus, it's like getting a bunch of different books all in one package.

I am pleased to see that the reality show producers are evolving as characters as well and have bigger goals, nobler purpose and more of a vision for the show than just to get the biggest ratings for the bang, so to speak. (I also like to see their failures and backfires and how they are learning from them.)

Even though I'm a pretty straight shooter when it comes to my romances, I like to see that this game has options, and a ton of them, for whatever orientation floats your boat.

Cons: 

It's tough that you can't save and need to take the consequences of your choices (or accidental clicks) or start over, especially for someone like me who ends up duffing romance options because I'd rather save the world and succeed my way without compromising to accomodate the demands of a potential dating prospect. (Hope I didn't ruin my chances with Weaver because I voted one of his contestants off.)

There is a some heavy-handed material in this novel about social inequalities, discrimination and activism. Folks who like to read fantasy/sci fi to get away from politics may want to steer clear. I don't mind it too much. Sometimes it gets a little 'in your face', but there are some good questions and points raised by the characters about these issues that could reflect on the issues of today. I would hate to see this trilogy evolve into a social studies lesson about human rights however. My preference is to keep those issues relevant, but not overshadowing the heroic adventures of the protagonist him/her/hir self. If the foreshadowing is any indication, however, it looks like the story may shift its focus soon anyhow.

Neither good nor bad:

This series, as the trilogy before it, forces you to make tough choices. There were times where I just couldn't decide what to do and had to leave the game for a while to think about it  before coming back with my decision. The consequences can be dramatic to the story and there's no going back except to start over, and I'm too cheap to spring for the hint MeChip thingy.  I like stories that make you think. It drives me bonkers when the consequences take the story in a direction I sincerely wish it hadn't, or come up with an ending I find disappointing because I made that one choice way back 25 choices ago. 

Overall, I liked it, though. I like the characters. Some are flat and predictable, but some have unexpected surprises and layers of depth you weren't expecting until you choose to get to know them. It makes me want to use whatever system/software they're using to create my own adventures.  The game itself is not that expensive, but I waited until it went on sale on Steam and picked it up. It cost a heck of a lot less than a book at the bookstore, and I feel I definitely got my money's worth. So thanks, creators and writers!

The Heroes Rise Trilogy was great, so when I found out that this game came out, I bought it instantly.
It was a mistake.
Other reviews have mentioned this, but this game was unbearably preachy. I can't really even remember the lacklustre storyline because I was being bombarded by laughable characters left and right and extremely cringe-worthy social commentary.
I understand that the author feels (very) strongly about his views, and it is fine to put them in a game, but in moderation, please. There was a certain point where I got tired of reading about how oppressed everyone was that I just started skimming the social commentary until I got to the actual story. Occasionally I would stop and read what the characters were saying and just roll my eyes because of how ridiculous it was.
The issues of the 'Underrepresented' was probably the main focus of this game, and they completely overshadowed everything else. Almost every single character in this game is 'Underrepresented' in some way and they will absolutely not allow you to forget that!
Also, in order to get a good outcome, the author basically forces you to become a social justice warrior. If you adopt an alternative social stance, you are punished with a character dying. If you decide that focusing on saving your dying sister is more important than championing social equality for all, she ends up hating you.
To sum it up, I didn't enjoy this game at all and unless you are (very!) into the idea of becoming a SJW with superpowers, you mostly likely would not enjoy this either.",1462185544,1462185544,False,52,3,0.722274601459503174,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The long playtime is indicative of how long it took me to commit to completing a single playthrough of it. I had the same issue with the author’s last game, Versus where I was just not able to finish it in a timely fashion, because I had similar issues that I did to this one. Left on in the background as I attended to other things, because I wasn’t interested in anything it was saying. It took most of the issues of that game, and accentuated them.

The game centred far too heavily on the idea of discrimination, and attempted to work it into a laboured analogy for minorities today. It’s nice to have some sort of message in it, but it interferes completely with any aspect of escapism involved. 

In that sense, I was never allowed to feel like a super hero, which certainly was not the case with the Heroes Rise Trilogy. That series had a focus on what you wanted to do with the powers, and how you shaped your own morality, and made your own choices to shape the story around you. Here I felt bent to the will of the person writing it, being constantly reminded of their morality that they intended to preach, rather than taking any opinion I had on a situation and implementing it. The only “underhanded” thing I was able to do was make an elimination vote for some character I had no reason to save, and even that seemed to only exist so I could be made continuously feel bad for doing so.

My options tended to range from whether I felt strongly about underrepresentation, to whether I felt very, very strongly about underrepresentation. And I suppose that isn’t what I wanted the game to be about. At the end it tries to make me feel bad about a death that I only tried to prevent, while guilting me for helping heal my dying sister instead of worrying about said underrepresentation (especially when I was supposed to make a choice at the expense of her well being that was ignored at the end.)

The whole animal shape shifting and all was its own issue as well, where now I’m being implored to guilt people for forming any kind of impression about whatever animal form my character woke up in that day. It’s a silly plot device as it is, and along with taking me out of connecting with the character I’m supposed to be creating, it further removes me from the connection I’m supposed to be feeling with the story, which is already tenuous at best.

Characters within the game were given little chance to showcase what they were really about, both within the context of limited screen time, and doing nothing with said screen time. Everyone simply passes by or dies before they make any impression. And it feels like they’re not supposed to, because the game isn’t about any of them, or characters in general.

My ultimate summary of this game is that it feels less like I’m choosing my own adventure, and more like I’m being told how I’m supposed to observe an adventure that was dictated in full before I began it. I would hope that it changes pace with a sequel, but considering the singular direction in which this story was written, and the manner in which this author’s style is continuing to change, I feel like it would likely get worse.

I have not played the original Hero Project trilogy so this would be my introduction into the world.

Although the basis for the story is very promising and engaging, it more than occasionally suffers from ham-fisted writing that detracts from immersion. You play as a character of chosen gender and sexuality whose physiology mimics an animal and morphs on a daily basis. You use this power to enter the Hero Project on the agreement that, by succeeding, your sister will be healed. 

Along the way you are introduced to power based inequality and group targeted hate crimes against those people who have more 'unsavory' powers. The game opens a wide conversation into inequality and the treatment of marginalized groups. However, the story falls into pits of monologues that stray from the focus of the story and seem to try to educate the reader on societal issues. 

Overall, this is an enjoyable game if you can overlook the jump in the focus of storytelling every now and then. I feel that the reason this game has mixed reviews is because of this and it's a shame because beneath it is an enjoyable story with interesting and memorable characters.

I dont usually write reviews but the negative reviews below made me want to offer a different perspective. The majority of the negative reviews only critisize the existance of marginalised groups being portrayed positively and an apparent ""social justice"" agenda. I don't know what they thought was going on when reading the original trilogy, but there has always been an anti-discrimination ""agenda"" in Heroes Rise. And I love it.

From the moment GG mentioned a Season 2 of THP, I wondered what would happen next. If you HAVE played the first three in this series, you know that the protaganist of those games fight against prejudice as an Infini Powered hero. I finished the trilogy having managed to bring ""anti-powered sentiment"" to an all time low and honestly felt a real sense of pride.

Thats what I like to see in fiction. Stories that make me FEEL. 

The Hero Project: Redeption Season takes this to a new level. We saw in the Heroes Rise trilogy that there were many AniPowered heroes and villains who were vindicated for who they were. Most of them were the villains in this story. This is the first time we get to see from the other side. The first time you can REALY sympathise with what they go through. Before we only saw AniPowered through an outsiders eye. This time we get to experience what its like. We may not actually experience the painful transformations that our protaganist does, but their experiences are what drives this story.

Additionally, like the Heroes Rise trilogy, the LGBT+ representation is outstanding. There are multiple characters who exist outside the gednder binary, possibly including you. You are able to play as male, female, intersex, or non-gender conforming, as well as specifying being a transwoman or transman.",1461151329,1461151329,True,5,0,0.51153564453125,0,True,False,False,False,,,

We're told (quite often) about the various trials that marginalized hero types face, but rarely see it in practice.  It's definitely part of the background, but for the most part, you're simply told that ""X circumstance exists, and needs to change"" without much in the way of showcasing it.  That said, I honestly found it LESS jarring than an instance in ""Heroes Rise: The Hero Project"" where a discussion of ""camp"" completely derailed things for a few pages before returning to action as normal, and that's likely because it's a central story-arc this time around.

That said, this seems to be playing up an X-Men vs. Brotherhood of Mutants deal regarding your character, who's an ""ani-powered"" (think Beast Boy, but with no semblance of control over what form he takes each day), though there's no payoff in this particular game for it.  Like the original series, odds are this one is going to be setting up a few factors in order to include them later.

Overall, worth playing the Demo - if you like it at that point, feel free to buy (if it gets too preachy, you shouldn't have enough time invested to void the Refund option), and if you don't, you can save yourself the time/money.

The  author went way deeper with social commentary and analogues to real world issues that I thought were at best, shallowly handled in the earlier series of games. A world where race and sexuality issues are just magically ""solved"" was unrealistic to the point of being dumb as far as I was concerned. Now I see this wasn't a cheap attempt to sidestep a serious issue (and miss out on characterization opportunities) it was more a way of communicating in a way that wouldn't immediately put a lot of people's guard up.

Of course It didn't really work; plenty of people still complain about this being preachy but those people complain about preachiness when dealing with other people in real life who have unfamiliar problems. One way or the other you can't make people listen if they don't want to. So I applaud the author's attempt here to sneak in some higher level thinking but, no dice.

Analyzing this experience purely as a game/piece of writing I thought it was pretty damn good 8/10.

I've been a big fan of the Hero Rise games even before they ended up on steam and I think Zachary is one of the most gifted writers I've ever come across. However if you are looking for an adventure similar to the Hero Rise trilogy, you'll probably be a bit disappointed. 

Redemption Season I feel is more a game that'd be enjoyed by tumblr activist or SJWs than anyone else (nothing wrong with that). The plot of the story is that you're entering the Hero Project as a underprivileged, underrepresented, minority figure who's trying to help his disabled sister get medical treatments and focuses a lot more on discrimination and activism than it does you being a superhero. The game REALLY hammers in the themes and ideology of systematic oppression so if you're not really passionate about those kinds of politics, you'll probably have a few eye roll moments especially due to how frequently they come up in conversation. Personally I don’t think it’d be as bad if the story showed a bit more of how people thought less of your character’s traits rather than have the characters say that’s how people view them. To it's credit though it never got to the point where I was annoyed enough to stop playing and I did feel like it was written with the awareness that these kinds of issues aren't as black and white as calling people names and shouting at the top of your lungs. Also part of what I think makes Zachary such a great writer is that there is an extremely high amount of diverse well written characters ranging from different genders, sexual attractions, race, body type, and beyond. Even if I didn't like this game as much as I'd want to, I do think there needs to be more games and media with this kind of diversity. The game can be addictive even if you're not the biggest fan of hearing this kind of stuff constantly on loop  but overall you'll probably love it 100% more than me if you are a big fan of these kinds of issues. 

Compared to the original trilogy, it does takes some risks in it's formula and I can't fault it for that even if there are some things I didn't like. For example, I didn't like how occasionally you'd switch perspectives to different characters. I understand that it really helped the story flow a lot smoother but I felt like it took me out of the experience of role-playing as MY character and it felt like the choices I was making as these characters didn't have any real weight to them or that they were done to cheat and make the game easier for my character (such as choosing to give myself more legend points). Again though, it is a very well-written story and it'd be hard to get those perspectives otherwise so it's not really a loss. Other than that, maybe it's just that I haven't played the other games in a while and are now better at these, but I felt like this one was easier than the last ones and the tone of ""better watch your step"" wasn't as impending.  The biggest difference though is unlike the first few games where the atmosphere was all about the new underdog hero with high hopes learning to find his way in adolescents while having impossible odds stacked against him at every turn and overall teaching the lesson of what it means to be imperfect and live with your decisions, I felt this one was more about the underdog who’s forced to be a statistic and advocates for equality and learns things aren’t always so simple or black and white. Both are good, but I prefer the first more because it isn’t a lesson I see very often and I already know to treat people fairly. 


 Overall It's very preachy at the beginning and midway points of the game but eventually it does dies down after a while and become more of the same spirit that I loved from the first series. If you're someone who is interested in human rights issues and superheros, I'd highly recommend this game because you'll have a blast. If you’re not, it isn’t a bad game by any means but you probably will have to get used to it or pass completely. 

I'd give it a 6.5 out 10 

It was good enough that'll I'll probably play the next installment when it comes out but not so much that I'm dying to know what happens.

I like it of course, excited to see the next part but let's me just say, the game feels really disconnected somehow. I still love it though, would look forward to see more stories from the author but this is just not my favourite installment in Heroes Rise world.


The game on Steam version seems to work fine, albeit a few glitch then and there but the game for iOS version seems to have the stat screen frozen which is pretty much uh? I paid most of my time on the iOS version instead of the PC version, but I finished it a few times already so here goes.

The interactions are lacking. You get to see from others' perspectives twice in the story, that's nice. But outside of that, there aren't much interaction with other characters. Instead, you get to see from the eyes of these seemingly important but in reality, doesn't make much of an impact on the main character. Of course, Weaver works as your handler and you can unlock of a romance with him, that's nice. Lyra is the producer, but to be honest, so far, I really don't care about her. It's a nice tidbit to know what happened between your character and their romance partner but the lack of response for Prodigal romance kinda hurt. Especially since she uploads her personality to MeChip server, I would like her MeChip personality to at least acknowledge of the hero. 

The Finalists go by in a breeze, some characters receive more attention than others, only for them to be kicked off the show in the blink of an eye. Other characters like Crystalline, Transfer, etc. receive an enough amount attention to get to know them. But their personality also gets extremely ambiguous at one point, it might cause disinterests in many people. It's nice to see the characters from the previous game to come back like Mach Girl, Fumble, etc. But interactions with them only go as far as that. 

As some previous reviewers stated, the game focused too much on discrimination against the character's Powered ability without proving it. Remember, showing not telling. Or else the reader won't be able to relate to the problem since it's pretty obvious to most that the sister is in dire need of help and deserve more attention from them. Which is true, and I believe many others would also choose to focus on saving her. That said, I also like JK a lot, she's really interesting and it's nice to have a sibling this time. But in the end, the writing's still more or less too personal.

I also wonder if it's possible to delete saves in the future since I have a lot from old games and it's cluttering up.",1460274868,1460618137,False,47,0,0.583281159400939941,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I also liked a lot of the characters and found them all diverse and interesting in their own way (Plus I love that there are so many options for characters you can romance which is a plus)

Heroes is a trilogy is this is made off the best part of the trilogy, Hero Project, a super hero reality show. Obviously comparison will be made regardless of necessity. So between first Hero Project and Redemption, I choose first because it was way refreshing sequel to the first part. But between the first trilogy and Redemption, I choose this because the stats are way better refined and it is not hard to grasp. 

Story is good and intriguing especially temptations to change side. If it materializes, it would be good. I did like the dynamic with sick jelly sibling. Obviously sequels are being set up but somehow the story seems more linear than the trilogy which seems unsettling, hopefully I am wrong. Also when MC connects the dot about what a certain psychic told to do and the reason behind it, seems a like a plot hole big as The Falls itself. I could have missed something but when I read it, I was stumped and clueless how the MC made head and toes of something like that. Plus no further explaination made, bugs me more.

Talking about bugs, first I could not transfer my Hero Fall saves to Redemption. I had to play through again which was annoying. What was more annoying is the fact I bought my warning DLC yet unable to use cause of bug. Yet I did achieve my best first playthrough because Zach like readers be themselves which I have mastered.

8/10 Not the Redemption the fans eagered for yet future redemptions could be, hopefully.

Honestly though, I found this game to be extremely enjoyable to play through, as this new experience of playing with a different character, and different powers, was incredible to experience.

Much like the previous entry, the treatment of Ani Based Powered's in society was brought up and shown in the East Fringes, but this new series showcases the relationship of this group of Powered individuals in society in depth, making it a key idea that connects the plot together. Of course, this ties with political ideas of this society, and how YOUR character fits into all this, if you believe you should be changing the views of society, or merely filling the stereotype.

Game-play:

This game is definitely (In my opinion), a good succession to the Heroes Rise trilogy, as I like the authors direction with this new series, bringing up political ideas and allowing your character to follow you ideals in believing their should be change within this society. I can see why people can play this and see this as 'off putting', but honestly it brought depth to this already good game.

Story:

The story isn't anything ground-breaking, as it is essentially the second season of ""The Hero Project,"" with a new cast of unique characters, with a variety of super powers. #lovethereferences, #lookingforwardtopart2. Although from the first series, this time around it felt more genuine and more like a story with the changed perspectives to show the player other personal conversations that effect the players character, without spoiling the story to the player. This addition I really enjoyed, as it felt more personal to me to understand another characters circumstances, that effect my choices, rather than making them feel two dimensional characters.

Mark: 8.8/10 Amazing.

Traditionally for Choice of Games, the main verdict comes down to the games story, and for Heroes Rise Redemption Season, it is certainly a game series not to be overlook. I was a huge fan of the first series, and I was sceptical of the second series not standing up to its predecessor, but after purchasing this game and experiencing it for myself, I was immediately re-hooked back onto this new series, as the mature concepts are really what makes this games story exceptional, as traditionally what hero story's lack in comparison is to delve into darker concepts, Zachary Sergi however, does not overlook this feature. For anyone who is sceptical about if this game is worth purchasing, the answer is 100% yes, as this is a fantastic continuation of the previous series, as I will definitely be going back to this game and playing through the different outcomes, and seeing different parts of the story.

Note for Author:

Thanks Zach for continuing this series its been one of my favourite Choice of Games to experience, take your time with the next one, I'm really looking forward to it, and where the story is going.

This is probably the preachiest of the lot, which is saying something, considering how the author seems utterly incapable of writing about societal issues in a non-hamfisted way. The entire game is full of clumsily written speeches that feels more like they're coming from the author than the characters themselves.

A huge focus in this game is discrimination, which I thought would be interesting. But instead of being shown instances of the discrimination our PC apparently faces we're just sort of told it exists. According to the author we're obviously supposed to care about it, and you don't really have much of a choice. 

If you choose to be uninterested in politics and instead focus on your sister (who is DYING by the way) you're almost punished and berated by the game, which is absurd. The author also seems to hold a bit of a grudge against certain characters, like the character Griffin (who's a RO!) whose only crime as far as I know is that he enjoys a bit of attention and isn't very bright.

The author really needs to begin distancing themselves a bit from what they're writing because it's not doing them any favours. There's nothing wrong with having social commentary in your game. But author, if you're reading this, please try taking a step back in your next games and let the characters and world speak for itself.

Likes:
*The characters, far more diversed this time around.
*Anything with you doing hero work proverbially.

Dislikes:
*When you aren't doing hero things, story drags and gets a little to hung up on political way to much for my taste.
*Felt rushed and then incomplete. I know this is the first of the new set, but I was left more going okay, then I enjoyed it like the first three.
*The lack of connection to characters, while there are a ton of interesting you never really interact at all in the story. Felt the connections were stronger in the first three.
* Another area where stats are built like money and serve no purpose, I want to see it matter.

So I will stop there, this isn't a bad game, it just feels weaker then the others. I will likely buy the sequel to this just to see if it picks up. I will only recommend this to fans who enjoyed the series and want to see it start fresh with a slightly new outlook. Otherwise I would say skip this until the second story is out and buy them in a cheap set.

I'm a big fan of the Heroes Rise series and of Choice of Games in general. It's wonderful to be able to go back in time to the days of reading through a CYOA book as a kid.

The Heroes Rise trilogy of games followed your own individual character who you coould customise with a few options such as gender, sexual orientation, codename, powers, etc. Throughout each game, you'd be faced with choices, some critical and some not so much, which would further tailor your character in terms of their sense of justice, their morals and their opinions on how powered individuals fit in society at large. It was a great story told over three games and there was a real sense of being a small cog in a big machine as other characters in this world evolved alongside you throughout the three games. In short, you should definitely go and play those three games before playing this one.

If you have played the Heroes Rise trilogy, you can choose to carry your save data over to this game (though I did encounter a very annoying bug which meant I had to play through the whole of the last game again to make a fresh save which could be uploaded) which means that even though you're playing as an entirely new character, you'll get to encounter some fun little callbacks and some additional worldbuilding, courtesy of the choices you made in the HR trilogy. 

But what about this game? The Hero Project (THP from now on) has you once again take on the role of a customisable super hero who, in short, is tasked with saving their sister's life. It's a classic story made much more interesting by placing your character in a reality show environment. I got some real Hunger Games vibes from mingling with my fellow contestants and delivering interviews with my answers playing a role in whether or not I'd be going home or advancing to the next stage and it's this which is my main issue with this game. Although THP is a CYOA game and the choices, big and small, do indeed carry weight throughout the game it is pretty clear that the writer wants you to follow a set path. There is a theme running throughout the game of the oppression of the downtrodden and how as a member of the downtrodden, you could take it upon yourself to use your new reality show platform to reveal the true plight of your kind or, in theory, you can ignore this agenda and focus on helping your sister. Only you can't. Maybe I've not made the right choices but I was greeted by three game over screens (you can imagine my frustration after spending around an hour combing through the text and deliberating over my choices that I was told I'd failed and could either restart the whole game or sacrifice my legend score (a stat which tracks your hero's fame/notoriety) to go back a few choices and try again. No checkpoints, no save state.) after trying to pick three different sets of choices which followed the beliefs I wanted my character to have (a straight-talking, private person with a soft spot for her sister. Her only motivation for going along with the contest being to help her however she could. She had no particular interest in any political message and was just there for family). On my fourth go at it, I decided to have my hero take a much more vocal approach to her thoughts on the political landscape just for the sake of trying to get past this one part and was rewarded by being allowed to progress through the game. I can only wonder why the option to not have a particularly strong opinion on the plight of 'ani-powered' heroes was included if you can't actually progress through the game by going down this route.

Although this decision by the writer has soured my opinion on this game, I still recommend it. At least to those familiar with the series. THP is a nice spin-off to the main HR series and it's pretty neat seeing decisions you made there coming back in some form here. The writing is great, characters are varied and memorable (JK is truly endearing) and this game will keep you hooked if you're a fan of the source material. If you're looking at this game and think it might be for you but haven't had the chance to play any of the other three then I highly recommend you look at those first. 

Pros - 
- Customisation. Name, codename, gender, sexual orientation, costume, sense of justice and more. Though do bear in mind that most of your potential enjoyment from this feature will come from your imagination. You can't choose your character's appearance or even something as basic as the colour of their hair but to me at least, that wasn't an issue. 
- The ability to upload your save data from the main HR series (though this game will only take a completed save from the final part of the trilogy).
- An engaging story with twists and turns and memorable characters. JK, Weaver and a certain blast from the past definitely helped convince me to recommend this game.
- Some truly creative super powers.
- All of your stats are kept in one easy to find place where they can be readily referenced at any time.

Neutral -
- This is a text-only, CYOA game. There are no images and your enjoyment of this game will derive entirely from how much you enjoy reading and using your imagination.


Cons - 
- Some illusion of choice. 
- Hidden stats that affect whether you'll be able to progress through the game, get to try again at the cost of a huge chunk of your character's fame score or have to restart entirely from scratch resulting in you having to click through a bunch of text you've already read and typing in names that you've already written.
- Personally, I wasn't a fan of the main character's superpower. 

///SPOILER/// You get to harness the abilities of a different animal every day. And also their appearance. You literally spend some of the game as a chicken man/woman. And as a wheelchair bound bumblebee person. ///SPOILER///

In summary, THP makes for some nice worldbuilding in the thoroughly enjoyable universe of Heroes Rise. If you've played that trilogy or will be playing it in preparation for playing this game then you're going to enjoy THP a lot more than you would if this was your first taste of the series. £2.09 (until April 15th) for a very well written book that you can influence the outcome of is a very good deal indeed. Just give the main series a look first.",1460154383,1460415946,True,29,1,0.668946266174316406,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story is the oldest thing humans love to share, and it forms the core of much of our culture and being.
