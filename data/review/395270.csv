The gameplay is sandwiched between screens of stream-of-consciousness text, introducing us to the player-character's mother first. We then play as the daughter, with voice interjections from the mother, and then the game concludes with more stream-of-consciousness text returning us to the mother's point of view. It's hard to get all this to feel like a cohesive narrative because no one is likable and everyone seems to be an unreliable narrator.

The story isn't anything wonderful, I don't think. It seems you were experiencing the world through the eyes of a traumatised or autistic young girl whose mother has some sort of heroin addiction and promiscuous tendencies.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

This is the fouth walking horror sim made by David Szymanski and for as far as I know the last of this style. 
To be honest I didnt like it. Similiar to the other games it heavily relies on the story, which never captured me at all. On top I find the gameplay and the riddle a little to confusing. There is a riddle that requires to do something in the previous room and it took to quite awhile and some research to find that out. 
Unfortunatly when you leave an area the area resets its item location, meaning you need to gather everything again. After a frustrating long time searchin for a solution and then having to redo some stuff didnt make it better. 
This left me unsatisfied at the end and when I read the same block of text again and again and again the game lost me at all. For real while was there the same page of words showed serveral times. Its a little sad I couldnt enjoy this. However I still think that David Syzmanski is talented Game Designer and that his future game, which I knew some of, are better.

As every experience focused game by Szymanski, this is a high concept, mechanically simple and deeply atmospheric game. The story is the most abstract and subtle yet and that works on its favor as well as it detracts from it.
I really like how the game casually introduces aspects of the protagonist than change the players perstective on her with just a few words. Also, the fact that the game is interrupted by calls of the mother of the protagonist -driven by a great performance- adds so much depth to an otherwise simple game.
Although I can't sincerely give it a higher score, I really enjoyed my time with this game, but I don't think I got to enjoy the full experience since my english is not the best and the introduction as well as the ending have kind of complex language.

Story:

You play as a young girl named Autumn. She awakens in a shed and after escaping from it she finds herself in an enclosed space with a door going into the basement and her mothers voice warning her not to go down below, but the more you try to get in, the more you realize the disturbing truth behind those doors. 

The story of A Wolf in Autumn is incredibly simplistic and creepy. There's quite a few moments that are genuinely disturbing and creeped me out and I definitely preferred this over FingerBones in the story department, although a few of the moments aren't as good due to the voice acting, but more on that later. 

Graphics:

Visually I'm pretty mixed on the art style for A Wolf in Autumn. I really liked the saturated colors at first and the weird trippy visuals for a very simplistic and realistic type scenario, but quickly I started to notice problems. There's some crazy shadow textures that just consume everything, if you drop an item you need in an area that's dark you will have trouble finding the item.

Other than that, the visuals themselves are very good. I especially really liked the starting area. Like I mentioned before the colors really pop to deliver this very dream like scenery and even though you're confined to a very small area, it's definitely a looker. 

Audio:

The audio design is very good across the board. I especially really liked the soundtrack, it's beautiful and helps elevate certain sequences of the game, especially the more emotional beats. I will also say that the sound effects are really great too and help build and amazing atmosphere. I really loved the wolf howls that happen from time to time and with other stuff it just combines to create a truly unsettling experience.

My only negative is the voice acting. There is a very minimal amount of it, but what's here is just very mediocre, I will say that I feel it's because there's a sort of filter attached to it to make it sound like it's coming out of a tin can (it makes sense in the context of the game) which kind of sounds really mediocre. 

Gameplay:

The gameplay is nothing special, A Wolf In Autumn is mostly a puzzle game where you walk around your environments and solve very simplistic puzzles. You pick items up, bring them to a location that requires them and that's the basic gist. So let's start off with the positives.

The puzzles themselves are very simplistic, there's no brain scratches here, but what I do appreciate is that there's a few puzzles that have multiple solutions, like different items you can get through different means that allow you to progress just the same, I kind of wish the game had more type of these puzzles. 

And now for the negative, which loops back to the graphics. Since you can only carry one item at a time you have to constantly switch between items, drop one and then pick up the other items you need. But some items you need more than  once and if you dropped into a dark area finding the item can be a pain in the ass. 

Verdict:

A Wolf in Autumn is a great little horror experience. I loved my time with this short tale and I definitely look forward to trying The Music Machine and David's return to the genre sooner or later. For the price it's asking for, I have no trouble recommending this game to fans of the genre.

Final Rating:
7.5/10

Pros:
+ Story is really good
+ Visuals really interesting
+ Audio design is great
+ Soundtrack is pretty good

Cons:
- Puzzles are overly simplistic 
- Lighting makes certain areas hard to see

Gameplay consists of finding various items (you can only hold one thing at a time) and working out which puzzles in the environment to use them on... very basic find the key, flip the switch gameplay that we remember from DooM in the 1990's, only this doesn't have any shooting or combat gameplay.   It's a somewhat shallow puzzle game.  

The voice acting is good and the game seems to be sincerely made, so that's a plus.  It's not what I'd call an outright asset flip. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the 1990s.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

‘A Wolf in Autumn’ is a Narrative Horror game, and I do emphasise narrative, the games intro and outro is one giant block of text. Gameplay is item collection exploration, the player will be finding items and completing a few puzzles to explore further.

This game really confused me, I played the game through and to be honest the gameplay is nothing special, although there are some great visuals. Items were simple to find, puzzles were easy enough and it did not take long in order to find where I needed to use the items. The main focus was the story, and every action you do in the game has the narrator/mother continue.

I don’t want to spoil the story, but in general it confused me with what is actually going on in the game. Just for the ending to be it was a nightmare, what we discover and what is real is thrown into questions. While the relationship with our mother is the centre of the story, most of the story is ended in metaphors that left me confused about the overall meaning.

Now this was a little of my fault, every action you do in the game brings up text, and some of this seems really important when I look back on it while editing my video. 

One final gripe the ending text has no punctuation, it comes off as a breathless diatribe and in a way does confuse me even more.

I am not really sure what to give the game, without the block of text the game was worth the play. The info dump just confused me, and really took away from the rest of the game. It is basically a point of tell not show and is very jarring.

First off, we are thrust into a low poly Unity game with absolutely abhorrent storytelling that feels incredibly blunt and immature. The narrative appears to be about domestic abuse, then shifts into something wholly unnatural and unrealistic, wavering any remaining empathy I am supposed to feel for the character played (Autumn.)

Szymanski is alright at designing a world with objects and music that fits, but this game put it over the top. I have no complaints about the music, but, the game literally throws objects at you and the puzzles you are tasked with solving are about repeating the same input with different items (you have to pick them up and throw them back down, every time.) Additionally, throughout this process, you have to grapple with the difficulty of balancing a flashlight (this gave me a headache) so you can see the world and it creates a very repetitive motion just to progress. 

The voice acting is... mediocre. I feel like my stepmother could have voiced and the character would appear uninteresting all the same. I found myself physically cringing at the abhorrent inflexions delivered by the voice and genuinely wished for it to end. BY THE WAY, the voicelines at a certain point are activated by entering different zones as if this game was made in scratch so by sprinting at certain points you can cut off dialogue. 

Listen, I am not one to pass up a game becuase it has edgy themes. I played the Danganronpa Trilogy, and ENJOYED it. Szymanski horribly executed these themes, which I still couldn't quite pinpoint what they were, and it shows. So much could have been improved upon review with a friend or something similar and it appears as if the game is an unfinished high school game design project made in 3 hrs. 

The run on sentences are what brought me to the edge, however. It is almost as if Szymanski busted out the ol thesaurus and scribbled away like a maniac hellbent on burning my eyes as a reader by not punctuating ANY sentences in the massive text walls that get thrown up on screen when he realizes he cannot tell his story in any other fashion.

A Wolf in Autumn is a game developed and published by David Szymanski

The game offers some nice graphics and a nice aesthetic, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

A Wolf in Autumn overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay psychological horror game to play in short bursts!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

Often I intentionally jump into games without reading directions.  This was one of those -- best summarized by an instrumental walk through.  ""Use this to enable that to access something else and progress.""

Note that you have NO inventory.  One carries a single item at a time.  That, in itself, isn't a big deal, but much of the game takes place in poorly lit environments.  So, you can't carry your light source (e.g.flashlight) and something else (e.g. a tool) simultaneously.  I suppose you get used to it though.

The story is told brilliantly through terrifying voice messages left by the mother, and through the daughter's inner monologues.  
I enjoyed the puzzle-solving system.  You can pick up one item at a time to use on puzzle objects, but there are a myriad of objects to choose from strewn about the environment.  Since not everything is necessarily useful for what you're trying to accomplish, it involves a bit of thinking to figure out what makes sense to try out first.

纯解密，不会有怪来追你，可以放心玩，只有一个地方可能会被吓一下，流程1小时，大概讲述的就是一个小女孩细腻的内心吧
[h1]关于剧情[/h1]
1.autumn既指游戏里面的秋天，又指主角（小女孩就叫autumn）
2.[spoiler] 由开头和结尾的剧情可以猜测，这一切只是小女孩的一场噩梦。由开头的“他在之前的那个夜晚离开了...伴随着太阳的升起结束了又一个辗转反侧的夜晚，她依旧保持着愤怒与骄纵”，“缺乏自尊心会觉得之前那些年（分手前的生活？）都是在浪费时间”，结尾“希望女儿和自己一样的自尊自爱”可以看出，女孩的父母分手，母亲是一个较为强势的女人，而游戏过程中母亲电话中的责骂和开头结尾母亲说得“看看风景吧，甜心。这不是很美吗？”则可以很好地看出母亲是一个喜怒无常的人，游戏过程中多次出现针头，文本多次写到needle（针头），poison（毒药），则暗示母亲常注射某种药物，这些在小孩子眼里都是阴影，以至于成为了一场噩梦 [/spoiler] 
3.a wolf in autumn，wolf（狼）（虽然游戏里说的是dog狗）影射的是小女孩内心对不如意的生活的恐惧与逃避，以此为题的用意揭示了小女孩一步一步正视自己的内心，母女最后相依为好温馨故事（至少我觉得不吓人）（从母亲语气变得轻柔可以看出，母亲态度的转变，也预示着母女关系的转变）
4.不得不说能用的道具就那么几个，没用的道具还有那么多锯子，刀，冰叉，锤子，扳手，螺丝刀，给我吓了一跳（曾一度认为要和怪肉搏

If I'm being honest, I liked some of David Szymanski's previous narrative horror titles more than this one. All that means is that if you haven't played The Moon Silver and its follow up, The Music Machine, I suggest you try those first. That being said A Wolf in Autumn is a solid B+/A- Horror VN in the form of a walking sim with some mild puzzles. If you don't like open-ended stories, walking sims, and fairly easy puzzles then don't buy this game. Most of the negative reviews are from people who expect $3 games to be as good as a PS5 game produced by Director Kojima.

The colors and graphics are beautiful. Depending on how you rate such things, this might be the best of Szymanski's games visually speaking. Personally, I thought the monochrome visuals of The Music Machine added to the feeling of otherworldly dementia that engulfs you as you play, so I like that one best. Though I say I like AWIA the least of these games, it is definitely a full step up from ""Fingerbones"" in terms of production. I just find the plot twist in Fingerbones to be a much harder punch in the gut than the twist in this story, which makes up for what it lacks in production and polish.

Technically speaking, in terms of graphics and design this may be his best work. Going forward Szymanski is going to have to move on from the open-ended narrative style for these games to maintain their quality. Overall, this game seems a little tired compared to its 3 predecessors. If you liked ANY of David Szymanski's games then you should buy this and continue the support. As VN's and walking sims go these are top shelf. If we want more games like this then you need to vote with your dollars, so to speak. For the modest price it is worth offering the support.

It’s an interesting journey that is geared towards specific audience.

And by “specific audience” I mean players who are OK to wander around borderline-Freudian world where almost every object and environment itself means… Something. What this mysterious “Something” is largely left for a player to interpret. These kind of games usually tend to be hit or miss for me, as I always feel the thin line between “here’s the story, see what you make of it” and “here’s something I made, see if you can even find a story in it”. “Wolf in Autumn” almost slides into a latter category, but its unique, involved gameplay and fantastic voice/music component makes it a worthy title.

I started locked in a shed and subsequently limited to a large backyard with a basement. While it’s slightly touched on who I am, what am I doing here is unknown, and what is the goal (beyond “keep moving forward”) is also questionable. The only thing that is present throughout is a voice of someone who calls herself “my mother” coming out of the strange-looking speaker and telling me not to wander. The more I progressed, the angrier the voice got. That’s about the gist of the entire adventure. There are various tools strewn around and several locked boxes, and the door in the basement that needs to be open. There is more of the same in the basement, but the atmosphere gets darker.

Interesting mechanic of using only one item at a time, which makes the surroundings a kind of inventory, prevents this game from sliding into one gigantic “stare at things and try to find meaning in them” fest. Yes, there’s clearly something deeper going on, and the whole quest is quite possibly a metaphor for something entirely different, but somehow – trying to find the right tool to get into yet another door balances out the feeling of being lost and keeps the player engaged all the way to highly allegorical, open-to-interpretation end.

The first POV in a highly contrasted 3D world serves well to deliver the story. Moments of blinding autumn sunshine on the surface correlate well with dark, dank basement underneath. A variety of sharp, dangerous tools available (there are several opportunities of self-harm), strange devices and a multitude of locks do not seem out of place in the otherwise fairly ordinary-looking world. Visual part of the game, just like about everything else, is also highly symbolical.

There narration is present in two distinguished parts. The first (introduction and finale) is done in a gritty poetic manner, almost begging to be read as a spoken word out loud. It’s silent, however, dark and part confusing, part lyrical, which reflects the subject explored in a sort of cryptic manner. The second part is the Mother’s monologue which is surprisingly realistic and doesn’t stray into poetry as she expresses herself in a way average angry parent could. Instead of poetry, the emotions take the spotlight as we can hear lots of repressed issues coming to the surface as we progress. And again, it all perfectly fits withing strange, ominous world of the game.

The voice of the Mother is done phenomenally by Julie Hoverson, who presents every frustration, every emotional high or low with a stellar performance. The music is equally well-made and punctuate the game with well-placed menacing tracks. For most of the playthrough we’re mostly accompanied by the sound effects, however, (also high quality as if there was any doubt at this point), an that’s, perhaps, the part that brings the chilling effect into the game the most. 

“Wolf in Autumn” is a treat if you don’t mind the story where nothing is given to you outright, and most of the stuff has double meaning. The darker kind. I wouldn’t call it “horror”, more of a psychological, surreal exploration that turns grim as you are piecing things together. Skip this game if highly symbolical, open-for-interpretation stories are not your cup of tea, and you prefer to follow a tighter plot, as here – even in the end - it’s still going to be up to you to figure out what it is you just played. If you’re OK with a world where everything is a metaphor for something else and don’t need firm conclusions and wrapped-up endings – “Wolf in Autumn” is a true experimental indie gem that will leave you contemplating on the darker side of human nature for a while.

so i sat down and played it. and then i loved it. and then i played every other game from David Szymanski. i wanted to review this one because of the fact it was the first i played and bought.

Likes:
- enjoyed the story telling with the additional mother voice to accompany it, really pulled together some more clear emotions
- the setting and graphics are harsh in color but give an unique impression of the world, i personally like the look
- very cheap but not very long- regardless im glad to have expirienced the story. i dont think length makes me not want to reccomend it, sometimes all i need is a short story expirience. 

Dislikes:
- i did find myself with one or two puzzles that i just didnt get right away and was not super entirtained trying to figure it out. 
- found certain mechanics and control a little awkward

I have liked all of David's games for different reasons and I cant really compare them or say which is best. i enjoyed A Wolf In Autumn for many reasons- the voice acting of the mother struck a chord in me and the many ways metaphors can be read leaves lots of thinking to be done- it all pulls together into a nice little story to play through and analyze.",1602048244,1602048244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, ""Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.""

Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.

As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, ""I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.""

""Does she live far off?"" said the wolf.

""Oh I say,"" answered Little Red Riding Hood; ""it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.""

""Well,"" said the wolf, ""and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there first.""

The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap.

""Who's there?""

""Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,"" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; ""who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.""

The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, ""Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.""

The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap.

""Who's there?""

Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, ""It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you.""

The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, ""Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.""

Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.

The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, ""Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.""

Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, ""Grandmother, what big arms you have!""

""All the better to hug you with, my dear.""

""Grandmother, what big legs you have!""

""All the better to run with, my child.""

""Grandmother, what big ears you have!""

""All the better to hear with, my child.""

""Grandmother, what big eyes you have!""

""All the better to see with, my child.""

""Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!""

С точки зрения геймплея она относится к жанру ""escape room"", и хотя главная героиня заперта не в комнате, а сперва на не очень крупном участке, огороженном забором, а затем на чуть меньшем по площади подвале, игровой процесс сводится к поиску на карте активных точек и предметов, которые нужно на них применить.

Однако этот типичный ""квестовый"" принцип искусственно усложняется тем, что у героини нет инвентаря: все предметы приходится таскать в руках (по одному за раз); места, в которых нужно их применить, зачастую неочевидны, а на карте валяется много совершенно ненужных для прохождения вещей, которые все равно можно подобрать. У нас есть табличка, привинченная к стенке машины на болты. Чем ее открутить? Находим ножик для колки льда, берем в руки, бежим к табличке, щелкаем мышкой - не подходит. Бросаем его, бродим по карте, находим кухонный нож, бежим к табличке, щелкаем мышкой - не подходит. Бросаем и его, прочесываем локацию, находим ножницы, кусачки, зажигалку - все не подходит. Что делать? Оказывается, где-то в высокой траве на краю карты лежит отвертка! Впрочем, конкретно она не очень-то нужна для прохождения: целая куча отверток (в прямом смысле) валяется в запертом синем сарайчике, но как его открыть - это уже другой вопрос; таскайте все инструменты заново, чтобы узнать, какой подходит!

И вот так снова и снова, пробуем разные предметы на одних и тех же объектах, предварительно выбрасывая один и беря в руки другой. Главное - складывать все найденное добро в одну кучу, иначе вещи просто затеряются на фоне земли или травы, и их придется искать заново (функции подсветки предметов в игре нет). Особенно это правило пригождается в подвале, где поначалу и вовсе нет света, а изучать карту приходится с фонариком (который, само собой, выбрасывается на землю после поднятия нового предмета). К чести разработчика, он не планировал мучать игрока темнотой на протяжении всей второй локации, поэтому на стенах можно найти пару переключателей, активирующих лампы под потолком - однако и их свет оставляет на полу большие темные участки, в которых легко потерять молоток или пробку от счетчика, если бросить их незнамо где вместо складирования в кучку. С другой стороны, все эти страдания ""одноразовые"": как и в случае с другими ""escape room'ами"", если вы запомните, какие предметы где нужно использовать, то сможете пробежать AWiA минут за десять. 

Стоит ли терпеть монотонный геймплей ради сюжета? На этот раз автор предлагает игроку сравнительно простую зарисовку в стиле ""бытового хоррора"", которая раскрывается через метафоры и сюрреалистичные образы ([spoiler]все происходящее непосредственно в игре под конец объявляется ""сном""[/spoiler]). В ней есть мать, которая без конца воспевает свою ""гордыню"" и жестоко относится к своей дочери (в своих сюжетах David Szymanski потихоньку форсировал христианский дискурс начиная с Fingerbones и открыто представил его игроку в проповедях Голоса из The Music Machine), есть девочка, помешанная на машинерии (""механическом"" вместо ""живого""), и есть собака, которая прокусила девочке руку, спойлер: [spoiler]за что и была выпотрошена последней с использованием предметов вроде садовых ножниц и ножей для колки льда, встречающихся по ходу игры[/spoiler]. И в общем-то в этой истории нет особой морали, а ее дополнительные детали полностью открыты к интерпретации благодаря многозначительности местных реплик и образов (с которыми увлеченно возились толкователи на форумах), но что по уровню драматичности, что по качеству проработки персонажей он уступает даже упомянутой TMM.

Что насчет атмосферы? Напряжение снова (как это принято у David Szymanski) нагнетается очень медленно, но на этот раз даже не получает адекватной кульминации ближе к финалу, а концовка практически лишена должного накала и наступает внезапно.

Вердикт: визуально красивый ""побег из комнаты"", который становится дико монотонным из-за отсутствия у героини инвентаря и необходимости брать каждый из игровых объектов ""в руки"" (по одному за раз).

This Unity 5 game by David Szymanski is about freedom, family, and damage. It’s a short story, in essence, with a game built up around it. 

We start locked in a disorienting shed, in turn fenced in a forest. There are a couple of ways to get out of the shed – leave it to me to find a complicated one right away – and once we’re out there’s a buzzing blinking machine waiting to give us a message from Mom. Mom’s not happy that we’re out, and wants us back in the shed. This is a theme. Mom is kind of one-note on this subject. 

Eventually we’ll walk down some dark corridors and end up in dark places, literally and figuratively. What you’ll make of what you discover along the way is your own. But there’s stuff amiss. Our body isn’t quite right, and there are wolves about. Or are there? 

A swift player will make it to the end of this story the first time in 30 or 40 minutes. Some will return for a second visit, to fill out a few details. I’d recommend that.

Das Spiel hat keine Save Games, aber es ist auch in etwa einer Stunde durchzuspielen.

Es gibt keine Gegner, die einen Verfolgen.

Die Steuerung und das fehlende Inventar finde ich nicht so gut gelungen.

It is billed as a psychological horror, I didn't see any of that in this game.
The story revolves around some girl and her angry mother yelling at her, you roam around trying to solve very basic puzzles, with a terrible inventory (eg none) you can only hold one item at a time and to do anything you need to drop said item unless you are trying to use it. The story really didn’t make too much sense, a lot of games try to use a lack of information to make the game seem deep, or dark, and this game just spent a whole lot of time saying nothing.
Grahpically it is quite basic, mostly stock unity items.
Sound is mostly the same, weird groaning behinds walls in an attempt to make the game seem scary, voice acting is average (for an indie that’s pretty good).
This game is essentially like playing nothing, the puzzles are easy, the story doesn’t really exist, nothing at all stands out, I feel like I have wasted an hour doing nothing.

You explore backyard and basement, interact with machinery, and find clues to your situation and your mother's life. But beware, the wolves are closing in...

My opinion on the game is: I'm conflicted. 

The gameplay wasn't really challenging, but it was still entertaining, especially considering the length of the game (I finished it in 40min). 
I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the setting. The voice acting was amazing, too.  But there were also several things that I did not like about this game.

1) How the visual effects affected the gameplay: 
The game looks pleasant. It's not a visual masterpiece, but it's neatly done. However, all these blooming effects and splashes of light may make it very hard to find anything once you've dropped it. And you have to drop everything eventually, because your character only has one hand and no inventory. It's not a gamebreaking flaw, but I highley recommend paying attention to where you drop an object.

2) A sentence is not a minivan:
The game starts and ends with a written monologue by the protagonists mother. At first I thought that was intriguing, but two screens later I realized that the monologue was missing something really important: full stops, commas and paragraphs. 
A Wolf in Autum presented to me a single sentence that could have easily be divided into ten smaller ones. Also, there should have been larger margins to the left and the right side of the text, because nowadays most screens are large rectangles right in front of our eyes, so reading texts like this is a bit uncomfortable. 
It may sound like nitpicking, but general rules of typography should apply to games as well - especially when intro and outro rely on text. Halfway through the second mega-sentence I stopped caring about what the protagonist's mother had to say.
Playing in windowed mode helped though.

3) The plot-twists
I really, really, really enjoyed exploring the area and finding clues about the protagonists family history. I had made up my mind about the protagonist, her mother and their relationship to each other. Then came the first twist that forced me to reconsider everything (in a good way, though). Then, shortly after the first one, came a second twist. And I didn't like it. It felt forced, it felt rushed, it felt wrong.

Now, do I recommend this game? Well, I'm still conflicted. It's not expensive, a lot of people seem to like it, and I definitely mostly-enjoyed it. But it wasn't exactly a must-play either. If you're a Szymanski-Fan, enjoy surreal horror, don't mind playing short games and are not easily ticked of by bad typography, you will probably like this game. But I'm giving this a thumbs-down, because there is no ""undecided""-button on Steam. Yet.

If you challenge the game however, by accident or on purpose, it basically breaks - items can disappear forever, text can come up as the same time as (different) voiceacting and I thought the ""mechanic"" of only being able to hold either the flashlight OR another item at the time would be used for some clever scares, but instead it was just a hassle. Get it for free or nearly for free, play it once and if you dig Szymanskis other stuff, you'll probably get decent 45 minutes out of this - but I personally enjoyed ""The music machine"", ""The Moon sliver"" and even the shorter and more minimalistic ""Fingerbones"" more than this one. 6/10",1550064682,1550064682,True,1,0,0.53087162971496582,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It relies strongly on its narrative, and David Szymanski knows how to carefully pace the story so that the player will constantly move forward to answers. The answers given, however, are open to interpretation - thus, this game falls into the ""art"" category of games, where discussions are fruitful on what the meaning of the game is. I personally enjoy this kind of game, but if you aren't into games similar to this, then this might not be for you.

A Wolf in Autumn has us taking on the role of a 9 year old girl named Autumn. Her relationship with her mother and the outside world is described in a series of audio messages left to her by her mother through a puzzling machine that emits an annoying noise if you don't interact with it. The game begins with her waking in a shed, and her mother imploring her to stay there. Of course, as a curious kid and player, that won't do, so Autumn breaks out and begins to investigate. The puzzles in this game are simple and are not too overly complex, though sometimes a bit of trial and error will happen as you try to figure out which button or item does what. What makes the puzzles a little harder as well is due to the lighting in the game. While the game has gorgeous lighting and color choices, the saturation levels and darkness make seeing small things difficult.

The game excels in sound design and maintaining tension throughout the short experience. The fact it excels in this allows the narrative to be much more powerful and make this a nice psychological horror game. I somewhat wish this game were longer, as David Szymanski understands how to craft psychological horror and I think a longer title from him in the same vein might be quite fun to play. Despite this, I think the duration of this game allows it to not overstay its welcome, and the price is appropriate for how long the playtime is. If you're into a simple puzzle game with psychological horror elements and a mysterious narrative, then I recommend this game for you.",1546404268,1546404268,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Крайне короткая история, со скудным геймплеем и ярлыком ""Я не скуп на деньги, но здесь цена себя не оправдала"". Такие вещи обычно размещаются в библиотеке бесплатно, как 10-страничная методичка, которую взял, прочитал и вернул на место. Здесь же, заплатив за сие произведение, ждёшь чего-то большего, чем маленький Линчевский вижн на один присест. Играем за маленькую девочку, которая выбирается из сарайчика и начинает искать путь [b]наружу[/b], попутно выслушивая предостережения и упрёки своей матери. Ходим по маленьким квадратным локациям, разбитых на 2,5 этапа, подбираем предметы, взаимодействуем с окружением, движемся дальше. Проблема в том, что взаимодействие и изучение здесь крайне скучное и утомительное. При первом прохождении, ""игра"" вгоняла меня в сон, из-за чего решение простых пазлов затянулось на долгий промежуток времени. Со второго раза история была пройдена за 15 минут. 

Итог: имеем кусок повествования, вырванный из контекста, тонкую философию которого нужно разобрать самим. После небольших размышлений, смысл становится понятен и начинает казаться, что всё не так плохо, ведь это часть цельной драмы/повествования. Да вот только никакой ""цельной драмы/повествования"" из уст автора здесь не наблюдается.

[u]Before I get into the review for A Wolf in Autumn be aware it does contain Adult themes and the voice acting by Julie Hoverson is incredibly effective so be prepared for that!! There is no save feature as advised at the introduction since it is a short 1 hour puzzle experience[/u]

The game starts with a visual of a sunrise at the ocean and the words : ''Look at the waves aren't they pretty?'' followed by a text introduction describing very deeply the Mother's pride then you hear the Mother's voice advising her child to ''stay in the shed... until I get you'' and it's here that you begin playing the role of the child inside a shed.
After you escape the shed you will be greeted with vibrantly sharp autumnal textures of oranges, reds & greens as you gaze upon the most aesthetically pleasing garden that could only come from the creative mind of Szymanski. 
Exploring here is important as there are many usable items scattered for you to find and logically use to solve the puzzles laid out before you. The great aspect of this game is that there are multiple ways to problem solve depending on what items you use. 
The controls are all UNITY based with a very small dot acting as the mouse arrow that changes from white to green to let you know anything's collectable alongside a description of the item itself. Left click picks up any items and, while carrying the item, you left click objects to find out if they interact with a message telling you the outcome. [b]It's worth knowing here that if you want to perform an action while carrying an item you need to right click to drop it first - example if you're holding a flashlight and you want to open a door you need to drop the flashlight first[/b]
Esc key brings up a menu but there is no inventory for items you will need to drop reusable items in areas you know where  to find them again.
After progressing you will be greeted by a buzzing alert sound that you need to find to listen to Mother's voice admonishing you. This will keep repeating the noise until you find it so if you want to stop it gyrating in your ears press that button! 
The other sound effects are equally immersive whether it be the birds chirping, the hum of machinery or the occasional growl that will make you perk up expecting some jumpscare to happen! 

The story itself slowly builds by feeding you snippets of information that develops into the dark psychological Adult themes and, as you uncover other areas, you will start to hear the sublime voice acting increase its tempo adding to the creepy atmosphere. 
When you have completed the game expect a mixture of feelings including : mystified, horrified, confused, shocked and maybe even a hint of pity!

The game is fairly short (around 1 hour to complete, I guess), graphics are very interesting and the atmosphere is done well, it manages to be creepy and create suspension for what little time you play.

The game is intentionally having some dark areas. which, 'ambient-wise', was terrific and it added to the special graphics the game has, added to the suspension and gave place to very cool lightning effects. Unfortunately I felt it hurt the gameplay too much, as you could easily miss important stuff, and playing with the flashlight to see things around you wasn't so comfortable.

[h1] Hikaye [/h1]

9 yaşında bir kız çocuğunu oynattığımız oyunda çeşitli bulmacalar çözerek ilerliyoruz. Tabi oyun boyu alttan alttan gerici olayları bize yaşatıyor yapımcılar. Klasik psikolojik korku diyebiliriz.

[h1] Grafikler [/h1]

Grafikler en başta göze güzel gelebilir fakat değiller. Gözünüzü rahatsız ediyorlar. Bulmacaları çözerken yanlışlıkla bir eşyayı kaybettiğinizi farzedersek geçmiş olsun. Bulmanız tamamen şansa kalmış. Ekranda HUD olmadığı için kendiniz arıyacaksınız fakat grafikler/ışıklandırmalar o kadar çok göz yoruyor ki lanet ediyorsunuz. Ayrıca ufak tefek optimizasyon sorunları var fakat görmezden gelinebilir. Onun haricinde önerilen sistem ayarlarının birazcık yukarı çekilmesi gerektiğini düşünüyorum. Çok az :D.

[h1] Oynanış~Yapay Zeka [/h1]

Etrafımızdaki bulmacaları çözerek ilerliyoruz. Mantıklı ve mantıksız güzel bulmacalar var. Hepsi zekice hazırlanmış. Yapımcılar bu konuda güzel bir iş çıkarmış. Tam olarak denemesede.

[h1] Çeşitlilik [/h1]

Çeşitlilik konusunda söylenebilicek 2 şey var sanırım. 1.si bulmacaların çeşitliliği, 2.si ise bulmacaları çözme yollarının çeşitliliği. Bulmacaların öyle aşırı benzer olmaması hoşuma gitti. Ayrıca bulmacaları çözmenin tek yolu olmaması ise beni gerçekten mutlu etti. Bu tip bulmaca oyunlarında bence olmazsa olmazlardan biridir. Her sorun tek şekilde çözülmez sonuçta. Herkes farklı birşey düşünüp yapabilir. Bu oyunu daha eğlenceli yapar.

Sonuç olarak yapımcılar orta düzey bir iş çıkarmış. Oyun çok kısa olsada fiyatıda pek pahalı sayılmaz. Tekrar oynanabilirliği yok ama dediğim gibi 4 TL ucuz bir fiyat. Türü seven arkadaşların almasını tavsiye ederim. 40SP",1518517386,1578871862,True,2,0,0.518649697303771973,0,False,False,False,False,,,

A Wolf in Autumn starts with you waking up in a locked shed which you quickly escape from, only to find yourself stuck in a small fenced up area in the middle of a forest. From there, you'll be tasked with solving various, relatively easy environmental puzzles in order to advance the plot.

What i loved about this game is that there are multiple ways to solve most of the puzzles you're presented with, and it helps the flow of the game beautifully. Another nice feature is that you can tap almost every texture/object in the game, which always makes a unique sound and comes with a comment by the protagonist. It's incredible how something so simple can add so much immersion to a game. 

There is only one puzzle here i thought was poorly designed, mostly because it involved barely visible objects you had to interact with and required you to go through a loading screen to see if your solution to the puzzle was the right one. Nothing game ruining, but don't hesitate to read a guide if you get stuck.

While this is very much a horror game, it relies on sound design and story implications to make you feel anxious and apprehensive. There is only one ""true"" scare here, and while it is much more direct than the rest of the game's spooks, you see it coming and it's not sudden enough to be called a jumpscare.

The game can be finished in under an hour but there is no filler content, you're constantly moving the plot forward and discovering new parts of the environment. I highly recommend it.",1515273338,1515273338,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

i feel strangely positive about this game but i really can't tell why.


you spend your time exploring and solving simple puzzles to progress the narrative in this dreamish (or nightmarish) game and while there is technically really nothing  special about it it does work surprisingly well.
the two main selling points of this game are its unreal & oversaturated look and 'your mum's' narration which is in fact pretty good for a game with such a low price tag.

it took 45 minutes to finish the game, replay value is zero since it is strictly linear but that's fine with me.
again: it's a game for two bucks so you can't expect anything fancy.
but it does a fairly good job at depicting this dream of 'a troubled young girl' and telling the story it wants to tell so that's a thumbs up in my book.

Wir sind ein kleines Mädchen, eingesperrt in einem engen Schuppen. Nachdem wir uns aus selbigem befreit haben, entdecken wir ein Gerät, das Sprachnachrichten unserer Mutter abspielt. Die ist alles andere als zufrieden mit uns. Wir sollen im Schuppen bleiben, möglichst nichts machen, denn draußen herrscht Gefahr.

Das Game ist sehr kurz, in einer halben Stunde ist man leicht durch. Die Rätsel sind verdammt simpel und kaum als solche zu bezeichnen. Meist müssen wir nur eine Schere oder einen Schraubenzieher benutzen, um die nächste Tür oder die nächste Kiste zu öffen. 

Die Unity-Grafik ist überzogen farbig, fast stechend, Helligkeiten sind nicht gerade gelungen aufeinander abgestimmt. Seien wir ehrlich: die Grafik ist grottenhäßlich, furchtbar, laienhaft schwach. Man wollte mit einem Filter etwas besonderes erzeugen, herausgekommen ist Peinliches.

Aber: erstaunlicherweise ist trotz der ganzen Schwächen die Atmosphäre ziemlich stark. Das liegt an der Grundsituation und an der ziemlich gut eingespielten Stimme der Mutter, die immer wieder zwischen Strenge und Kumpelhaftigkeit changiert. 

Auch wenn dem Entwickler der Pinsel in den Farbtopf gefallen ist und er sich stilistisch massiv vergreift, Stimmung hat er drauf.

TLDR:. Short. Badly designed. Grating easter egg hunt based gameplay. Dlivery of narrative disappoints. No easily identifiable redeeming quality.

Inventory puzzles but no inventory system. Stiff scripting. Easter egg hunt for objects for the inventory puzzle. Small maps. Audiovisually had a bit of a flair to it but still felt rather rough and uninspired with abuse of lighting effects. Some of the assets were just dumped in the game for no reason such as many of the available tools lying around. The concept behind the narrative is underdevelopped, the execution feels timid, uncertain, and self conflicted, and then the game abruptly cuts off before developping into interesting territory. Dont bother.

Simple walking simulator in which you must progress through two small areas involving inventory puzzles and mechanical type repairs. The setting makes little to no sense and is a little surreal. The game employs the berating narrator approach, and tries to use its own flavor and spin on it, and it seems like it was headed in a few different directions (e.g. drug addiction, child abuse, you are a very tiny person or the levels are overblown) but the dev just retcons everything as a nightmare in the end fluff text anyways. The game ends rather abruptly and most of the fluff text was some kind of stream of consciousness type of delivery that might have made sense to the person writing it but just feels self infatuated, like someone who is into new age, or someone who meditates everyday and needs to realign their priorities.",1506585921,1509664492,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

 When it comes to gameplay, it's pretty standard. Walk to where you need to go with a necessary item to open a door or something. 

Scares in this game are not very effectivce. At the beginning of the game wolves begin to howl all around you and that was pretty unsettling, however once I realized that they wouldn't be able to get me the feeling was gone.

One of the draws that initially made me buy the game was the gorgeous uses of the Autumn color pallate that was showcased in the screenshots and demo video on the Steam page. However once the game started i noticed that my frame rate was absolute garbage whenever I was outside with the colors. Needless to say that sucked ass. even with all of that the color was only for a small portion of the game, with the rest being gray, brown and muted colors. 

After all of that you are probably thinking this game sounds like trash but it's not. I would call it average. Maybe buy it if you want abd if it's on sale.

Do I recommend it? It's hard to give a yes or no for this ""game"". It costs $1.99, and the best way to describe it would be a ""slice of life"" interactive psychological horror short story that lasts about an hour.

The writing is fairly pretentious, post-modernist stuff.

The puzzle mechanics and interface are clunky; you can hold one item at a time, and clicking on something else attempts to use the two items together; your hands must be free to use something you click on by itself. This can be somewhat irritating if you're holding something and try to open a door, as you try to use the object on the door.

The game is very easy, giving broad hints about what you need to do at every turn, and in many cases leaving multiple copies of the items you need to solve the next puzzle strewn about. The art style does the job without being exceptional, giving a surreal experience at game start with a blown-out high contrast pallette, devolving into creepy brown and green later.

I am normally hesitant to deal with games that handle such harsh topics as A Wolf in Autumn does, for two reasons: either they are too psychologically painful for me to handle (I'm kind of anxious) or they just... aren't a good example, or a considered portrayal, of mental illness, or the many real world topics that indie horror games often try to deal with. Even large studio-made games can fall victim to turning mental illness into fodder for a horror story, when the people living with such conditions know far too well: their lives are no ugly plot twist.

A Wolf in Autumn is, gladly, neither inconsiderate nor badly written. It forms a complex portrayal of all the characters within, however gruesome their actions; the game tries it's hardest to paint a picture of them -their pain and fear and the things their experiences drive them to. At the same time, it is not apologist and does not try to excuse the characters actions to the audience in the process of explaining their motivations. It deals with incredibly harsh topics such as [spoiler] drug abuse, child abuse and cruelty to animals[/spoiler] bluntly; with care where needed, but also making no attempts to hide the gruesome horror of the situation the game's child protagonist is experiencing. 

To summarise. 

PROS: 
[list]
    [*] Decent graphics, attractive (and sometimes disturbing scenery) and an oppressive atmosphere fitting for the setting. 
    [*] Layered characters with complex motivations. 
    [*] Entirely playable within the time limit presented (just as well because the game does not feature a save option.)
    [*] Definitely scary as h***, with effective (and appropriately rare) jump-scares (one of my friends even indicated that some of the scares I showed in my video of the game were not present for him in his playthrough), as well as the sort of game that will push you to tears at the end. 
    [*] Competent voice action, sfx, and audio. 
[/list]

CONS
[list]
    [*]Awkward controls and no inventory meant you could only pick up one item at a time and had to carry things around one after the other to get them in a convenient position and not lose the,. That said, I was sure that the game presented an in universe explanation for why that was.

A Wolf in Autumn is a remarkably surprising game. You play a nine year old who finds herself locked inside a shed in a fenced area in the middle of the forest. As you manage to break out of the wooden shack that is your prison, you receive a message from your mother, warning you about the dangers of moving about. It is now your choice whether to listen or to continue exploring.

Upon choosing the latter, we find ourselves in a short but deed storyline unlike any other captivity story that I have previously encountered. Nothing turns out to be quite the way I expected it to and I assume it would be the same for most anyone who plays this. Having played Fingerbones first there is a resemblance between the two games - obviously since they're both made by the same creator. 

The graphics are quite nice, and a little odd with unusual color combinations on every-day items. The atmosphere is therefore unique, sometimes relaxing and sometimes creepy. The riddles are a bit weird for me personally but I liked having some trouble passing through the game - it kind of added to that feeling of helplessness and confusion one has the impression the girl must have felt.

Altogether a very nice indie game, although sometimes a bit annoying with systems like for example only being able to pick up a single item at a time and not being able to interact with anything while carrying it.

While leaning further into the use of color and shadows that set the mood so well in The Music Machine, this game also places a heavier emphasis on puzzles than his previous games which makes A Wolf in Autumn feel even less like a walking simulator than its predecessors. However, a total lack of explanation regarding the game's mechanics and simplistic controls can make for painfully obtuse puzzles, stalling the narrative instead of enhancing it. The traditional game mechanics could use some work, but the foreboding atmosphere and the thought provoking quality Szymanski is so adept at infusing his games with is present in full force here.

Whether that's because A Wolf in Autumn asks the player to really reach for their own understanding or it's just trying to hold onto its mystique by being vague, the ending left me shaking and eager to pour over what meager details were given for answers.

Orgoglioso ma modesto, Szymanski sottolinea continuamente il carattere ""artigianale"" del suo produrre videogiochi: la sua poliedrica sensibilità gli permette infatti di creare da solo tutte le componenti dei suoi titoli, dalla colonna sonora, ai modelli poligonali, fino ai suoi autocelebrati effetti di luce e scelte coloristiche. Il risultato mette in risalto una natura autoriale ed estremamente coerente di queste esperienze, spesso potenziata dall'esplicita volontà di imporre una fruizione continua e non liberamente gestibile tramite checkpoint o salvataggi. Questa scelta recupera a mio avviso un aspetto fondamentale, ma scarsamente preso in considerazione, dell'intrattenimento con pretese artistiche: esattamente come in un buon concept album, le opere vanno apprezzate nella loro sequenzialità temporale, senza spezzare la visione narrativa con dei riflettori puntati su un singolo o, nel nostro caso, in una sequenza particolarmente iconica.
Al di là di queste generalità, battezzo la mia conoscenza dei giochi di Szymanski praticamente dall'ultima pagina, A Wolf in Autumn, per rendere tributo al fatto di essermi stato donato e perché interessato dalle scelte estetiche saturate che tanto risaltano dalla pagina di questo store. AWiA si è rivelato un titolo estremamente simbolico e finemente strutturato, che gioca efficacemente sul senso di aspettativa che il pubblico comunemente sviluppa iniziando a visionare un prodotto etichettato sotto il genere di cui stiamo parlando. AWiA infatti NON è, a mente fredda, un gioco horror, a meno che non consideriate orrorifico un processo onirico che conduce a una presa di coscienza della propria identità e a una razionalizzazione della posizione e dell'influenza delle figure genitoriali nella nostra vita. Dopo una vita di sregolatezza, una donna diventa madre mettendo alla luce una bambina. Il processo psicologico dietro all'assegnazione del suo nome è abbastanza palese: per la donna avere una figlia determina l'inizio dell'autunno della sua esistenza, che necessita un inquadramento assai più ferreo in alcune posizioni sociali ma che al tempo stesso risulta ancora orgoglioso della rigogliosità sensoriale dei tempi appena passati. Autunno non è solo un colore vivido di un cielo terso crepuscolare: ha anche un cuore duro, già gelido, contratto e buio. Ciò vale in primo luogo per la madre: da una parte infatti vorrebbe relegare la figlia nella luce, in un'iperprotettività contraddittoria con la sua costante assenza di autocritica; dall'altra non riesce ad abbandonare del tutto alcuni suoi vizi, in primis l'uso di droghe. Questa discrepanza autunnale dai contorni netti e non bene amalgamati crea nella bambina degli scompensi: frutto di un'idealizzazione di positività che non trova risposta nel modello primario di riferimento, Autunno finisce per rimanere affascinata dal principio stesso della vita, alla ricerca di quell'essenza che ci definisce come esseri umani. La sua passione per le macchine non l'aiuta, facendole anzi confondere infine le componenti dell'anima con le componenti del corpo materiale: è già una perversione sottilmente avvertita dalla stessa bambina quella di provare a ""smontare"" un essere vivente, il cane, per giungere a una risposta che possa farla sentire completa. Paradossalmente, la completezza arriva da una mutilazione: Autunno è ancora essere umano dopo aver perso un arto, che viene visto simbolicamente come mezzo dell'oggettivizzazione delle sue pulsioni prerazionali, del suo scantinato dell'anima da cui sua madre aveva cercato utopisticamente di allontanarla. Poter ""vedere"" una parte di sé fuori di sé è il mezzo tramite il quale la bambina arriva a vedere con distacco le componenti della propria psiche, e ad accettare che a lei si ricongiunga il lupo, ferinità soltanto in apparenza aggressiva, ma in realtà onoricamente positiva (è qui interessante notare che l'incubo non si interrompe bruscamente dopo l'assalto). L'accettazione della dualità etica quasi empedoclea dello spirito umano si apre nel finale come soglia di un nuovo inizio speranzoso, in cui è nuovamente possibile affacciarsi sul mare, segno di vita, e soprattutto accettare il modello materno per ciò che è: simbolo di perversione mai trattenuta fino a fondo, che la stessa bambina riesce finalmente a ritrovare in sé e ad inserire in un quadro psicologico non più inibito e per questo pronto ad attuarsi nella realtà. Un tema simile, rimanendo a livello di intrattenimento di massa, si può ritrovare in Nozoki Ana di Honna Wakou, in cui la perversione ha proprio una valenza catartica di riavvicinamento alla realtà, di comprensione reciproca e di onestà senza veli. 
In definitiva, AWiA descrive un processo introspettivo doloroso ma coraggioso. Non si occupa infatti di cosa Autunno farà del materiale spirituale che va a svelare nel suo breve sogno: ad esso non viene infatti affibbiata nessuna connotazione valutativa, né in realtà un processo del genere può effettivamente averne, così come la nascita biologica è un atto che va di per sé al di là del bene e del male. Ciò che però emerge in fondo al titolo è che conoscersi non è mai un'esperienza negativa, e AWiA è per questo addirittura caldo, positivo e rassicurante.",1479492975,1479493373,True,0,0,0.462695389986038208,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There's a lot of symbolism going on. It's also a rare example of psychological horror that puts psychology first. Further, it's easy for us to appreciate as the player because the discordant sound effects creates an oppressive atmosphere to play match the characters' inner turmoil.

In comparison, the developer's earlier work, [i]Fingerbones[/i], was a short story that started with after the end of the world and went downhill from there: what happens if a guy who's read far too much Nietzsche for his own good survives the end of the world? Mr. Szymanski's sense of horror is primary psychological, and the psychological trigger he enjoys pulling most is transgression. [i]Fingerbones[/i] was a story that started mundane and, as the player went through the motions of a puzzle game, it slowly transgressed the usual player's conventional morals. By the end, you [i]know[/i] what's going to happen. You dread it, but, like craning one's neck at the grim-looking traffic accident, the sick part of your soul has to make sure.

[i]A Wolf In Autumn[/i] also gets its creepshow factor from transgression. However, unlike [i]Fingerbones[/i], it [i]starts[/i] walking past the line from the word go: you're a little girl. You're a nine-year-old girl, alone, locked in a shed by your mother. In Szymanski fashion, it all goes downhill from there. Lines are, of course, crossed and that is where [i]A Wolf In Autumn[/i] is most effective. It also does well with tension and suspense. There are one or two things that could be considered jump scares, but either they fall flat or I'm just not particularly susceptible to them and they're the game's weakest part.

Don't buy [i]A Wolf In Autumn[/i] for gameplay or expansive content, since it is only about an hour long. Those will inevitably disappoint you if you put much value in them. Buy it and play it if you want... a poem. A feeling. A theme. If [i]Fingerbones[/i] was about the potential barbarism in people well past the pale of everyday existence, [i]A Wolf In Autumn[/i] looks to things closer to home. By the end of the game, you'll realize you probably know at least one person that this tone poem comes dangerously close to describing. Depending on where you live, that person might live down the street and there may be a handful of them to boot.

If you're particularly unlucky, you might find it speaks to your own condition.",1475544562,1475544562,True,3,0,0.548349738121032715,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I feel like a puzzle tag needs to be added to the game description as there was a big element of puzzles and mysteries. There wasn't as much horror as I was expecting, there wasn't really a scary be but more that 90% of the game felt eerie.

I think that one of the main problems was that there was only like a half hour of the game but give or take for time getting stuck makes it about an hour long. I feel that the short time of the game made it hard to develop the story.

A Wolf in Autumn ist ein Spiel, wo der erste Blick sagt: Hey! Das sieht gut aus! Und tatsächlich. Die Beleuchtung ist sehr schön gestaltet, wie auch die Umgebung. Auch die Sounds sind gut gelungen, sowie das Voice-Acting. Ich zumindest habe die Mutter sehr gut verstanden und das ohne Untertitel.

Spielerisch muss man jedoch ein paar Abstriche machen. Das Spiel ist kurz und hat kein Speichersystem, worauf netterweise aber hingewiesen wird. Man sollte etwa eine Stunde Zeit haben, bevor man beginnt. Wir rätseln uns dann durch einen Traum, der vorerst ja wie ein schöner Traum aussieht, jedoch immer dunklere Gestalten annimmt.

As the style has changed, it is used to bring a more realistic look, using effects that works well for this style to make the world have more effect. If it was like previous games, it would not have had the same effect on the player. 
I only found two things that was wrong with it, but otherwise small. I couldn't pick up the lighter in the basement after droppping it, so I had to restart the game. I'm sure this is like a low chance of this happening though. The second thing is when you are loading to the basement, the game can crash/not respond. It wasn't a big deal as it was the beginning, but it's not really a big deal anyway considering the game is short enough to not be concerned with losing your progress.
Overall, this game is not disappointing. I find it hilarious when I get spooked by something I shouldn't have in the game (it was really embarrassing when I got scared by the lights seemingly lining up to look like eyes in the bush. I have an odd feeling those were placed like that on purpose. Coinsidence? I think not). I'm really glad the puzzle in the beginning could be solved two ways because I did not notice one of the ways [spoiler] aka the key hanging down that could be cut with the scissors the first time I played the beginning part (I'm glad I found out as that note might not have made sense haha) [/spoiler] .
If the developer decides to continue making games, I certainly will be looking forward to seeing the improvements and engaging in another world made by them. I'm sure I got pretty annoying showing up suddenly reviewing all the games suddenly.

Read this only after you've played the game and you have your own opinion of it :) Otherwise, you know - SPOILERS :)

So this game, I feel is obviously about the drama between a mother and her daughter. The mother has lead a heavy, very heavy life, full of mistakes, full of wrongs. She has only her pride left... barely.The daughter sences this and much more. She feels her mother's pain and wants to help her. But she's refused. The game takes place in a nightmare, hence all the tripping colours and weird machinations. At first I asked myself if this is a metaphore for a womb and escaping from it. Close to the end you cut some bloody ropes, which remind me of umbelical cords. 

I believe the mother can\'t let her child go and wants to protect her from the evil in the world... I honestly feel for her. I have a friend for whom I have the same feelings. That's why Autumn is in a cage, going in circles, always thinkering with stuff. Which makes her mother furious: she can\'t control things she doesn\'t understand! That\'s why she stops her constantly.

At one point you are attacked by a spectre of a black wolf. I honestly shivered in my entire body, such a good moment. I believe the wolves represent the evils that might afflict women: abuse, a wasted life, dead hopes and so on. The game is both very sad and very scary, when you really think about it. If you know someone, a man or woman, who might be abused - help them, be there for them. And love your children... I think this game is about those things...

Verdikt: A Wolf in Autumn je indie hra, ktorá dokáže zaujať hneď na začiatku odohrávajúcom sa v lese. V lese, ktorý hýri rôznymi farbami a oznamuje príchod jesene. Odchodom z tohto miesta sa zoznam pozitív radikálnym spôsobom zužuje. Dôvodom sú bugy, technické spracovanie, problémová optimalizácia charakteristická pre engine Unity a hnusný dizajn. Naozaj, po prekrásnom lese prichádza doslova vizuálny humus. Modely predmetov sú otrasné, textúry nekvalitné a k tomu sa ešte pridáva obmedzenie v podobe možnosti niesť iba jeden predmet pri sebe. Presným opakom je audio stránka hry. Hudba je skvelá a dabing pôsobí profesionálne. Negatívny doje z hry nezachráni potenciálne dobrý príbeh a nízka cena, pretože za dve € možno kúpiť oveľa lepšie hry v rôznych akciách.

The game is short, I completed it in ~40 minutes.

The puzzles well.. I hate to call them puzzles but technically they are puzzles, so yea, the puzzles aren't to hard. Once you've played it for about 3 minutes you get the hang of it and things shouldn't be to difficult, but they are made in a clever way. But if you're stuck just use a walkthrough, nothing wrong with that.

I mean.. I don't really know how to properly review this game.

You play as a little girl with one hand as I understand it, you're in a locked in a shed which you complete a [i]puzzle[/i] to get out of, you then recieve a message from your mother, once you progress in the game you get more increasingly aggresive messages from your mother.

The gameplay for what kind of game it is, is great, the story is... fine(when I say story I mean the dialouge and the text you're introduced with/the game ends with).
If you're familiar with this developers previous games then expect the same atmosphere, and strange game in a different setting.
This developer really knows how to do psychological horror the right way, great to play in the dark.
The game is grim, the atmosphere is dark.

It's hard to not spoil the story when talking about it so I wont. Experience it for yourself.

I don't want to go into it more. Try it for yourself when you're in the right mindset, it's short and cheap, nothing to lose.

But, as always with these games, you have to play it when you're in the right mood/mindset to properly enjoy it, to get what you want out of it.
I think everyone who already enjoy games like these, strange games, walking simulators etc... know what I am talking about.
I personally don't think you can just go into a game like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/232430/]Gone Home[/url] at anytime, you have to be in the correct mood to really enjoy it.
If you know you're not in the right mood then wait and play it when you are in the correct mood. 

By the way the starting area of the game has extremely bright colours, they actually made my eyes weird.. I don't know how to explain, so if you have any health related issues with that then don't play this.



*One thing I always recommend developers of games like this is add some achievements. It does sell your game to completionists who want 100% achievements in games. It doesn't take much effort to add some, just do it.

I enjoyed the story. It wasn't at all what I thought it'd be, which is by no means a bad thing. This is more of an example of 'the game existing simply to be a vessel for the story,' rather than a game with a story tacked on as an afterthought. (if that makes any sense?)

I generally enjoy games with a good and/or mature story, as they seem to be hard to come by. A Wolf in Autumn certainly delivered. While I was hoping to see relationships or inspirations from the things the dev mentioned (Sound and the Fury, Silent Hill 2, Mulholland Drive) as I love each one, I could find nothing. Not going to knock any points though. (Although on a personal note, I'd be curious to know what about/what parts of the game the dev feels were inspired by these things.)

I did pick up the developer's other two games as well, and I'm looking forward to seeing if they are just as engaging.

A few... well, not really cons, per say...

I've got a i7 5930 and a ASUS Strix GTX 980Ti. I can run GTA V in three screen surround mode maxed out and my temps don't get as high as they do in this game playing in 1920*1080 borderless windowed. Generally my CPU temp is 28-33C at idle depending on ambient room temp, and GPU is 30-34C. This game had the CPU up to 45C and the GPU up to 76C. I opened my GPU manager and set a custom fan profile, which I've never done before, simply because of the extreme temp increase this game caused. It just seems like this game may not be very well optimized. 

Last thing is that, if you are epileptic or have photosensitive seizures, The contrast in the opening area, as well as the choice of lighting can make it hard on your eyes and head. Soon after you reach the basement, there will also be a badly flickering overhead light. A few minutes after the basement light came on, my head hurt so bad and I felt so drained I had to take an extended break. (Hence the long play time for what is a very short game.) So just be aware.

Encore une belle et tragique promenade en compagnie de David Szymanski, le temps d'un ""A Wolf in Automn"" dans la droite ligne de ses précédents travaux.
Paisible, beau, littéraire.
Plus un livre d'images, elliptique et glaçant, qu'un jeu à part entière.
Quelques énigmes dont la résolution tombe sous le sens.
Quelques errances sur fond d'introversion.
Les couleurs chatoyantes d'un ciel d'automne.
Des thématiques dures et sans concessions.

Un parti-pris, une fois de plus, qui rebutera ou séduira selon ce qu'on cherche ou ne cherche pas dans un titre de ce genre, mais avec la générosité créative d'un seul homme comme gage d'authenticité.

Si ce nouveau récit est toujours construit avec intelligence, l'anglais y est toutefois plus ardu que dans The Moon Sliver. Le fond, plus douloureux. Moins éthéré. Plus proche de Fingerbones (dont il se fait presque le remake).

Aussi n'aurai-je pas été autant bouleversé que précédemment (et ai-je dû consulter le net pour vérifier que j'avais bien compris de quoi il retournait).
Aussi n'aurai-je pas été autant happé.

The 3D modeling is crude but effective, the sound effects and voice carry the game.

The game is only about an hour long.

Reasons:
There's no story so to speak of, it seems to be some angst about a woman and her daughter, the mother must be fighting some kind of depression or other condition to lock her child in the garden shed, which is a strange element without explaination. 

The world is very surreal, I liked the style, but there's no puzzles to speak of, you merely find tools to open doors and manipulate the locks or parts that you need to progress. 

The music while nice is a little annoying, so no, I didn't enjoy that much. 

Again the story was lacking at the end, it made no sence whatsoever, even in any kind of abstract way.

I'm a solid fan of this developer in general, but I don't think this is his best.  

First, I've played through it twice now and the story is... less clear than I would like.  That's both good and bad.  The story is clear enough that I know it's not supposed to be clear.  I'm fairly sure I understand the high-level backstory behind the two characters.  I'm also reasonably sure I understand the ""perspective"" that causes some of the rapid swings in the environment and other oddities.  But there's the lingering sense that I'm missing something.  A feeling as if I've managed to figure out the backstory while somehow overlooking the plot.  It's odd.  What I think I understand isn't a bad story -- it has some very intriguing themes going.  It's just that they don't seem to be going forward.  At all.  Like unearthing the backstory IS the story, but nothing moves forward once you grasp the setup.

Second, though the game does explain why you don't have an inventory...  I'm still more inclined to just call the interface ""unfinished.""

Third, it can be REALLY hard to see where you're going the first time you play.  This has pros and cons.  Pros: atmospheric, very pretty, appropriately creepy.  Cons: can occasionally get lost in a seemingly infinite black void because you can't tell the difference between lack of light and walls.

● es gibt nur eine Synchronsprecherin - was ich bisher in keinem Spiel gesehen habe, es aber auch nicht unbedingt sympathischer macht
● baut auf psychologischem Horror auf - gibt zwar ein Jumpscare, aber das ist nicht besonders gruselig. Mehr die allgemeine Atmosphäre des Spiels

●  es ist grafisch nicht besonders anspruchsvoll
● kein Spiel das länger als eine halbe Stunde - maximal eine Stunde Zeit in Anspruch nimmt
● Du kannst nur ein Item zur selben Zeit halten (einer 9-Jährigen fehlt scheinbar die Kraft dazu zwei Gegenstände zu halten)

Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas le travail de Szymanski, il faut savoir qu'il aime l'horreur psychologique, simple, sans jumpscares mais avec une ambiance travaillée, intense, qui se base sur un récit complexe et laisse le champ libre aux interprétations.[/i]

Une petite fille se réveille enfermée dans une grange. Une clé retenue par un fil pend à mi-hauteur et lui permet de s'évader rapidement. La voilà dans un enclos au milieu d'une forêt automnale, idyllique avec les reflets rougeoyants que laisse le soleil en traversant les feuilles des grands arbres, un décor presque surréaliste. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604743726 Au centre de cet enclos, une étrange machine est reliée à une porte close menant sous la terre. Une sonnerie retentit, la voix de sa mère se fait entendre à travers un drôle de caisson en tôle. ""Reste tranquille ma chérie, retourne dans la grange, ne touche à rien et surtout pas à la porte du sous-sol"". Cette ambiance rassurante va lentement se muer en atmosphère pesante. Un sombre secret se cache dans cette forêt et les hurlements des loups se rapprochent dangereusement... 

Comme souvent avec Szymanski les jeux sont courts et pensés pour être joués en une seule fois afin de ne pas altérer l'ambiance particulière d'un conte aussi noir. Ainsi, il faudra vous assurer d'avoir au moins 1h à consacrer à ce jeu puisqu'il ne possède pas de système de sauvegarde. Rassurez-vous, si vous devez quitter vous n'aurez pas de mal à recommencer rapidement étant donné qu'une fois que l'on sait quoi faire le jeu peut se terminer en 15 minutes.

La première chose qui saute aux yeux, c'est la beauté et la poésie visuelle de A Wolf in Autumn. Bien que techniquement il reste des choses à améliorer il ne faut pas oublier que c'est le travail d'un seul homme et qu'il a réussi a montrer le grand potentiel du moteur Unity 5, ce n'est pas le cas de tous les jeux indépendants qui s'en servent, loin de là. Cette forêt colorée, saturée en couleurs avec ses beaux reflets est un régal à regarder. Le contraste est d'autant plus saisissant avec le second environnement du jeu : une cave sombre et lugubre. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604743750 L'effet est radical. On passe du rêve au cauchemar.

Seconde particularité du jeu après l'absence du système de sauvegarde, l'absence d'inventaire. Et pourtant on en aurait eu besoin car on va devoir chercher des objets tels des tournevis, clés, torches et fusibles pour résoudre les puzzles. Cela s'explique par le fait que nous incarnons une petite fille à qui il manque un bras. Elle doit donc se débrouiller avec une seule main et pour plus d'immersion, le choix de ne pas intégrer d'inventaire a été fait. Aussi, un tel choix nous oblige à prêter attention à l'endroit où l'on pose les objets et à s'en souvenir, le joueur est d'emblée plus impliqué dans le déroulement des actions. Pas d'inquiétude cependant, les puzzles peuvent souvent se résoudre de diverses manières et plusieurs objets d'un même type sont généralement disponibles. Les énigmes ne sont d'ailleurs pas bien compliquées, l'intérêt du jeu réside davantage dans le récit lugubre qui nous est fait.

A Wolf in Autumn est le premier jeu pour lequel le développeur a fait appel à une actrice, ici pour doubler les dires de la mère. Cela apporte énormément car la voix est excellente et dégage beaucoup de caractère avec ses intonations, ses accents mielleux, et ses tons machiavéliques. Le seul regret reste que ces phases ne soient pas sous-titrées. Les lignes de dialogue sont simples à comprendre mais on peut facilement manquer des mots par-ci par-là selon les actions que l'on effectue en simultané. Lorsqu'on a affaire à des pensées de la fillette, les sous-titres sont aussi un peu trop rapides à mon goût, surtout que ce n'est pas le genre de jeu où il faut prendre les informations par dessus la jambe. Tout est important pour comprendre ce qui se passe réellement dans cette forêt. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604743820 La technique utilisée dans les textes d’introduction et de conclusion du jeu est tout à fait originale, cela s'appelle du ""courant de conscience"", une sorte de monologue intérieur qui ne se plie pas aux codes de l'écriture et oublie ainsi des règles telles que la ponctuation. Ce n'est pas toujours très facile à suivre et un bon niveau d'anglais est tout de même requis. 

La bande-son réalisée par Szymanski est bonne elle-aussi, décidément c'est l'homme à tout faire. Si vous avez joué à The Music Machine vous reconnaitrez certaines sonorités déjà utilisées par le développeur, une vraie personnalité s'en dégage ainsi qu'une atmosphère pesante qui sied parfaitement au jeu. Malgré tout j'ai trouvé les compositions supérieures et plus variées dans The Music Machine mais ce jeu-là durait aussi un peu plus longtemps. Pour un aperçu de l'OST de A Wolf in Autumn c'est [url=https://davidszymanski.bandcamp.com/album/a-wolf-in-autumn-ost]par ici.[/url]

En tout et pour tout, il faut savoir à quoi s'attendre quand on s'attaque à un jeu signé David Szymanski. Original, court, surprenant, A Wolf in Autumn prend le pari de nous livrer, en 1h seulement, les clés de compréhension d'une réalité sombre au travers d'une écriture subtile et réfléchie. Les indices sont nombreux, il ne tient qu'à vous de savoir les interpréter.

A Wolf in Autumn is a short puzzle adventure game that was released in October 2015, being developed by David Szymanski. As you get told when launching the game, it is intended that you finish it in one sitting, which takes about an hour. 

You play the game as a young girl, and you find yourself in a forest at the start of the game, locked in a shed by your mother. To begin with your mother and surroundings seem very peaceful, but this soon takes a dark turn. Gameplay is from a first person perspective, and the main tasks involve solving puzzles that use real world logic. The puzzles do require some thought though; you shouldn’t be put off by the starting area as that is the one I found the most difficult. I’m not ashamed to say I spent at least ten minutes trying to get out of the shed only for the answer to be extremely obvious. You are able to pick up objects, but sadly you can only have on item in your possession at a time, meaning a lot of running back and forth to get items is required. 

The game is run using the Unity 5 engine, and whilst the graphics aren’t the best, they do portray the darkness and surreal atmosphere very well. The game does have some nice lighting effects as well. It can be run on pretty much any resolution up to and including 4k.  The voice acting of your mother is very well done too; I genuinely got scared towards the end of the game just from the sound of her voice. 

Whilst there isn’t a very deep plot to this game, there are still some underlying potentially disturbing themes on show, and is not something which people who are easily upset by such things as child abuse should take lightly.  Maybe the developer is trying to show us something through the story, I don’t know, but I found it very interesting to see how the plot unfolded. 

As you can see from the amount of time to play the game, I didn’t find it all that difficult. If you apply logic to the puzzles, you can easily work them out, and often just pausing for a moment and thinking how you would get out of this situation yourself is usually the write answer.  I completed the game in about half an hour.  Some might think that is short for any game, and I can see why, but I was enthralled with the game from the get-go so I am not going to complain too much about the shortness.  I have seen that you can complete puzzles in more than one way as well; this may add a little replicability but I am more than happy with just the one play through to satisfy my experience with this title. 

I didn’t have any technical problems whilst playing; it is running on a very well matured engine so it should be expected. 

I enjoyed my time playing A Wolf in Autumn, not all horror experiences have to include an abundance of jump scares to be classed as scary; the atmosphere and undertones of this game are scary enough for me. The price of £1, 59 is fair, regardless of the length of the game. The developer has put plenty of hours into making a really good game, and that is definitely worth the £1, 59 in my eyes.

С другой стороны, было довольно забавно представить на месте героя именно волка, собственно поначалу ты и думаешь из-за маленького роста, что ты и есть запертый в сарае в лесу дикий зверь.

С первых же кадров отсылки к потокам сознания недвусмысленно говорят о принадлежности игры, но тут скорее отсылка к ""Когда я умирала"" чем к ""Шуму и ярости"". Хотя в ""The Sound and The Fury"" слово ""Машина"" встречается 63
раза, но в значении именно ""автомобиль"", в ""As I Lay Dying"" всего 4, но по делу
cf.Потому  что создал нас Господь для дела, а не для того, чтобы чересчур долго думали;  мозги, они как машина, не любят, чтобы в них зря копались.
Ключевой смысл трактовки в формулировке внешнего мира как отлаженной машины, в противовес сомневающемуся и совершающему некие действия внутреннему миру человека
Хотя многие считают, что лучшие достойнейшие книги лучше читать в бумаге, я более склонен к утверждению, что части выполненые потоком сознания лучше воспринимаются на слух, когда их зачитывает - если герой женщина - женское лицо, без определенного эмоционального выделения. Так и здесь, больше геймеров обратили бы внимание на силу текста, если бы он давался не на черном фоне, а зачитывался мамочкой также, как и в процессе геймплея.
более опытные писатели в постмодернизме не вкладывали в монолог женщины такие сильные чувства, тем более не делали на них акцент
Попытки мужчины отобразить переживания женщины никогда не были удачными учитывая и эгоистичный намек ""Может ли женщина думать?"" Поток сознания от женского лица всегда очень тонкий и нелегкий приём. Сражаются гордость женщины с попыткой мужчины художника стать на время её разсудком. Попытка отобразить эгоизм и я-ориентированные чувства женщины через эгоизм и я-ориентацию мужчины. Эти попытки не всегда бывают удачны. Только когда они представляют собой модернистский памфлет, вызов, они начинают казаться влитой частью произведения.
Например, Сорокин в ""Теллурии"" может позволить себе то, на что не был способен в ""Норме"" - выразить поток рассказа девушки или может скорее женщины, при этом не акцентируя внимание на бьющие ключом чувства в результате вся вставка является прекрасным стилистическим приёмом, не мешающая ничему.
Хочется заметить, что поверить в то, что произошедшее было сном, может лишь недалекий в мистификациях авторов произведений человек. при этом мы играем явно не за девочку ведь Чуткий игрок замечает, что персонаж не может являться ни волком (как может он подумать вначале), ни собственно девочкой. Хотя воспринимаемая им информация не подвергается материальному мыслительному анализу, как раз это более наклоняет нас к тому, что персонаж мужчина лет 33. Происходящее не может быть кошмаром или детским сном, да и недалекие игроки думают что кошмар заключается в волках, дак нет, кошмар - это травма детства, нанесенная противоречием между замещением роли матери собой в результате недостаточности её реализации. Мать - эгоистична, делает вид что дает гарантии безопасности, но подсознательно-то мы понимает, что это враньё. Именно когда символы первобытной веры поставлены под сомнение, мы начинаем действовать ручками, сопротивляясь мессаджам от мамы.
Поэтому от игрока - требуется, необходимо - поставить под сомнение и эту мистификацию и понять, что подобная травма больше напоминает травму отца, когда именно отец, а не мать представляет из себя одновременно и существо, которое дает безопасность, и при этом существо которое твой организм отвергает.
Поэтому концовка реальная выглядит довольно наивным, если ты это понял.
Вторая часть (Basement)  игры довольно спорная. Смысла и посыла в ней меньше, чем в других, в более лучшем варианте она должна была бы являться посредником между началом и концом. Предполагаю, что создатели сделали упор здесь на хоррор-квест  ради форматности игры. Гораздо лучше было бы избавиться от предрассудков направленности для аудитории (ведь всё равно они не смогли бы узнать смысл второй части уже не купив её)) а сделать вторую часть связующим проводником.

*This game has alot of colours that are very bright, so if you suffer from anything like photophobia or anything similar please be aware.
It can also be hard to see parts of the outdoor scenery/objects sometimes because of this, so also bare that in mind.

Il start off with the graphics, whilst being a very bright game (part of it) the graphics are nothing amazing but good enough to play and enjoy, low budget you might say.

The story itself is a little freaky and makes you wonder at times WTF is going on, but if you read and follow it as you go you will eventually understand, it doesnt take long really (about 1hr or less) and isnt a bad short story overall, and although its a type of horror its not very scary at all.

The gameplay, movement, controls etc there pretty normal, theres no menu as such you just start off with a list and explanation of controls and enter the game or exit.
The basic idea of the game is to explore and find objects that will help you progress further in the game/story, kinda like puzzle solving but not really hard at all, and the area your in is pretty small so its not like your looking for a needle in a haystack, straightforward and simple to get used to tho and enough to keep you on track with the story.

Bad points? There isnt any exactly, IMO there could have been more in depth puzzles, bigger areas and more content to explore but for the price you pay i cant complain, and im sure theres people out there who dont enjoy puzzles being too in depth or tedious anyway.

Overall a great little game (and little it is) one your only gonna play through once, easy to understand, easy to play, with a freaky storyline that keeps you on your toes until the end and a few not so cryptik puzzles along the way, just wear sunglasses is all i can say :D

The overall art design of the game is stunning and really adds to the haunting atmosphere David Szymanski was trying to create , however what really makes the atmosphere in my opinion is the music and subtle sound effects that make you doubt yourself and have a quick look around your area to make sure you are still alone. Along with great atmosphere the story itself is quite interesting as you start off not knowing anything about your character and it is only with more exploration and progress you delve deeper into the dark fathoms of your characters life.

However there are a few things that could be improved on , such as constantly having to drop one item to pick up another, which is explained why, but drags the game out a little longer when it really doesn't have to as there is a point where you end up in a dark room and you can't keep your flashlight on you whilst using other items . Although it does state it is a short horror game I had it completed in like 30 minutes or so which you could argue is worth the 79p I paid for it as it is a really good experience and I guess I am left with wanting a bit more , but the more I am wanting is perhaps more backstory to the character and a bit more explanation. But then again the game does give you enough and I guess you are left to finish it off in your head.

Overall i would give the a game a 7/10 based on how cheap I got it and how much I enjoyed playing it.

The graphics are fantastic and the sound is too.

At first, you start understanding very little of what's going on in the game (I believed I was a wolf in the beginning), but while you're solving puzzles everything gets clearer, I suggest to listen to every message that ""Mother"" sends you.

The exploration is faboulus, you can solve puzzles in different ways and  you feel in a real world atmosphere finding every type of object that could be useful or not, so you feel really immerged in the game.

I did play the devs' previous games multiple times, but I have to admit, part of the reason why I'd taken so long here was because AWIA SCARES me. People may differ on what they conceive as horror, but for me, this is a horror game. Yes, it continues the sort of exploratory and puzzle style with focus on narration and story from the dev's previous games, but it is terrifying to me.

It begins with some text that appears straightforward, but then gets increasingly intense as the text screens progress, accompanied by some very aptly ominous music. And that's just the prologue before the game begins. You awaken to find yourself in a bright, oversaturated, and mesmerizing arboreal environment. And things seem pleasant again. Yeah, you're locked in a shed, but you easily get out, and you're able to communicate with your mom. But as you begin to explore your surroundings, things get more unnerving, and you find yourself feeling more vulnerable.

That's much as I can really describe of the setting without spoiling anything. The story in AWIA is a bit vague and unclear at first (and even a little after a second viewing), but it's not a disservice to the game. It's a very surreal experience, and the game does an excellent job of slowly giving more information to the player about who you are and what is going on. It's actually done very well, and adds to why the game is so scary to me. I can't really say much, but just the little bits of flavor text when you pick up certain items, or enter certain areas help to convey, although not so subtly, very organically, bits and pieces of your character (like why you can only carry one item at a time). 

Speaking of flavor text, the dev mentioned to me in a previous comment how one of the things he added in The Music Machine, was a larger variety of objects in the world to interact with because he felt that it added immersion. I definitely agree, and it was one of the things I liked in TMM versus The Moon Sliver. It gets even better in this game. When you attempt to use certain objects to deal with certain puzzles, there's actually unique text describing why your item doesn't work, instead of a generic “this item does not work here”. It's great, and I could be wrong, but I think there are also different ways to solve some of the different puzzles. All this just adds to the immersion, that you really are a little girl just fumbling around trying to figure stuff out.

And as you try to figure stuff out, the game may seem a bit slow at the beginning (at least it was for me, because I could not figure out many of the puzzles without quite a bit of roaming about because the...trigger points aren't as obvious), but it's quite rewarding, and like many good horror films...it gets increasingly disturbing as you progress, until you get to the final sequence and it's just snowballing in your face.

Overally, I greatly recommend this if you're into the previous games by the dev. And even if you weren't, I feel like you might have a different opinion about this. The game is much more intense. The puzzles are much more interesting. And the voice acting is incredible (as I said, this game legitimately scares me. It's emotionally taxing for all sorts of reasons). The story and characters seem rich. I say seem, because again, it's a bit unclear. But as I said, it's not a bad thing, and I look forward to additional plays, and looking through internet discussions to piece together exactly what is going on between the girl and her mother.

The graphics are gorgeous, and very fitting as you'll find. The music is excellent as with the dev's previous works. And at the end of the day. It's cheap, it's a quick play (under an hour). If you're looking for a quick, immersive, horror experience but with more emotional and narrative substance, I'm not sure you can really do better than this.",1449685471,1449685471,True,9,1,0.449007391929626465,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A Wolf in Autumn  è una breve, scura e profonda esperienza piuttosto che un gioco.
Non vorrei raccomandare qualsiasi gioco proveniente da David Syzmanski se si è alla ricerca di una scarica di adrenalina.
Se si desidera, invece, indulgere con un brivido e un po ‘di meditazione dopo aver passato qualche ora su questa avventura grafica, siete i benvenuti.

Don't get me wrong, Fingerbones was a delight for a earlier piece of work from him. This title on the other hand, felt like a step back, perhaps even lazier project? Compared to his other titles, this one is just alright. As a standalone affair, I say it builds up environmental atmosphere wonderfully but lacks much in the way of an ellegantly designed story. It did not provoke emotion, it just confused me. When I finally understood, I felt cheated. 

In summary, you get what you pay for I suppose. Excellent environment/voice acting/ sound track. A rather lack luster writing. Good introduction piece but for fans of his stuff, you'll probably feel let down.

Although this game is short ""A Wolf in Autumn"" is clever. Not really exhibiting major elements of the horror genre, but exploring emotion and the human psyche through a narrative of despair and pain. The simplistic story works well and is quite beautiful and poetic in its finality. 
""A Wolf in Autumn"" was an enjoyable experience, earning its price tag and my recommendation.

While the puzzles are quite typical for a horror adventure game, the amount of subtext in the game's writing is what truly stands out. It is a story of the complicated relationship between mother and daughter. It's simple on paper, but what was implied in the dialogue reveals a more sinister side to this relationship. I like the idea of an obsessive love for someone gone wrong. It's a brilliant premise.

If you have about an hour to kill, I would recommend checking this game out.

While this is a short game, it is certainly not a bad game. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The colours almost seem to bleed out in this game, particularly in the outdoors area. In my eyes, that is intentional and you will understand why as you get further into the game.

Little creepy touches add a nice feeling to the game. Reading the descriptions that Autumn says when clicking on items can shed a lot of light on what is really going on.

One thing did annoy me a little, and that was the fact that I had to drop the flashlight to pick up a different item. Depending on how far the location is that you need to use the other item, you can find yourself stuck in the dark for a bit. That certainly was not enough to dampen my enjoyment of the game.

This is a game that will make you think at the end of it, and may induce you to play it again just to see how differently you see things at the beginning, and how they tie into the end.

I highly recommend this game as it is a lot of fun and does make you think about it after you have reached the end.",1446527716,1446527716,True,16,0,0.594580769538879395,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As with his previous works, he takes a psychological horror concept and really drives it home using minimalistic and yet lush and evocative scenery with a short tale attached. To tell you any more than what is in the store page would be a disservice to a person wishing to play this, so I wont go into my personal thoughts on the story, but I will say that it is quite compelling.

This time around, the Unity 5 engine, but without using stock assets. This marks an evolution in Mr Syzmanski's development ideas and skills. Actually, if you were to play each of his games in order of release, you would easily be able to track a clear progression is ability and skill, with this game as the current culmination of his previous efforts.

As with previous games, this game makes heavy use of the interplay between light, darkness, and shadow to emphasize the desired atmosphere. Additionally, the original soundtrack and sounds further enhance the experience. All was done in outstanding fashion.

Another appealing aspect of this game was the 45 minute to 1 hour length. In my opinion, it was the perfect length to accomplish the goals it sets out to accomplish.

The controls are simple WASD with R/L mouse to pick up, use, and drop items, and shift to run, since walking around exploration games slowly is always something of a chore (in my opinion. I appreciate it when devs include running despite it not being strictly necessary).

The puzzles in this game were not too difficult to solve, but were clever, making good use of the items available in the game without getting in the way of the experience.

Anyway, I can go on and on about this game, but I will simply close out here by stating that this was a special experience and I was glad for the opportunity to play this game.

9 out of 10.

Even to open-minded players, that can be a turn-off. There is no lack of pretentious, patronizing, and often preachy nonsense out there, and that can understandibly sour gamers towards arthouse titles. But unlike those developers, Szymanski is creating profound, memorable experiences with compact, well-written narratives, and he is doing so with no agenda but his artistic vision.

My first of Szymanski's games was the free Fingerbones, which was strong enough to get me to pay for futher games. The second was the powerful The Moon Silver, which is by far my favorite of his stories. And the third is A Wolf in Autumn. All three games place an emphasis on psychological horror, and all three are short, playable in a single one-hour sitting. All three contain characters constructed through text, audio, and, for the playable characters, gameplay. You generally won't see character models on-screen, but that doesn't detract from the experience. Anyone who has played a well-crafted text-heavy game (or read a good book, for that matter) knows memorable characters are created through writing, not through visuals. Gameplay can be described, and not inaccurately, as ""walking simulator with puzzles,"" and that's fine. That's all that needed.

There's not much I can say specifically without spoiling the experience of A Wolf in Autumn. When it intends to be beautiful, it's beautiful. When it intends to be spooky, it is. It's better than Fingerbones, though it doesn't live up to The Moon Silver, which does a better job of using its limitations to its advantage. Like all of Szymanski's games, it sticks with you. You'll be thinking about the story long after you finish playing. That's a compliment.

Bottom line: if you like psychological horror, aventure games, and you value games as a way to tell stories, you like A Wolf in Autumn. You'll like everything from Szymanski, in fact. My only suggestion is to start with Fingerbones, which, again, is free. If you enjoy that, you'll enjoy the rest.

Ever since I've discovered David Syzmanski's games starting with [i]the Moon Sliver[/i], I got addicted. I'm not ashamed to declare that I'm addicted to beautiful, elegant and eerie atmospheres that he creates, veiling disturbing realities. [i]A Wolf in Autumn[/i] is no exception.

The sun raising on a beautiful shore line, waves cradling the shore on endless motions, bathed within the rays of sun themselves... Is this the scent of sea? No. Lights do shimmer through an old wooden wall, crafted either lazily, or without much skill. We are able to see an autumn garden through the cracks between planks. We are in a shed. Who are we? As we get out of the shed, we encounter an odd mechanism. As we push the button on the strange machine, a woman's voice calls us to warn that there are wild animals around. [u]""Go back to the shed, sweetie. There are wolves in the woods"".[/u]

[i]A Wolf in Autumn[/i] presents us a dreamlike experience, in which we take the part of Autumn, a 9 year old girl. She is in an autumn garden and wanders around, hearing her mother's voice through some strange machinations around. As we keep our progress, things do take a turn for a darker nature. Concepts such as pride, nature, innocence and responsibility are discussed, and we once again face that the reality itself is much cruder and darker than any monster under our beds could possibly be.

The narration and the voice acting of the mother come into a spectacular combination, and carry you though a genuine uneasiness. Graphics do hail from basic unity, but seeing the display of light, shadows and colors in this specific manner, you are reminded that this is a game by David Syzmanski. Added background noises; growls, swaying trees and mechanical sounds, this is a brilliant success on atmospheric horror yet again!

As for gameplay, it might be defined as a short atmospheric horror + walking simulation with puzzle elements. It is a bit hard to tag these games with a genre, but I can most certainly tell that they carry artistic and philosophical quality. The whole game wouldn't take more than an hour, and it is intended to be completed on one sitting, as David Syzmanski's most games. So, there is no save game feature. We move around with WASD and carry some items to complete some basic puzzles. We are not capable of carrying more than one item at any time, so if we'd need the same item again, we have to look around to find it. I know it sounds a bit annoying, but it is a choice for story purposes. When the reason behind is explained, you'll be shocked. I promise.

[i]A Wolf in Autumn[/i] is a short, deep and dark experience rather than a game. I wouldn't recommend any game coming from David Syzmanski if you are looking for an adrenaline rush. If you'd like to indulge yourself with a shiver and some pondering afterwards, you are welcome.

Expect a quick game, 30 minutes to an hour. You play as a young girl, locked in a shed and told to stay put. But ah, intrepid souls, we must escape. After the start up screen there is a bit of reading for the intro that vaguely sets the mood and gives a sense about what the story is going to be. As far as horror games go, this has some potential, and there are a few moments that are scary, but overall it falls more into the ""a little creepy"" category. From stumbling into the dark basement and scrambling for lights, to the howling of wolves just beyond the fence, the game never quite consistently reaches fear, but settles on more of a sense of unease. This isn't a bad thing, and I applaud the dev for avoiding use of jump scares and other poor horror tactics. 

Visually, the game does its job well enough, I could tell what's what and no textures or models were so bad they gave me pause. There is, however, one glaring exception. The lighting outside is really not good. I'm not sure what mood the dev was going for when he set those colors, but wonderland acid-trip was probably not it. With the colors a little too bright and the shadows  too dark, solving puzzles outsides becomes kind of a headache because of the contrast. Luckily, because of the games length you quickly descend into the basement, where the colors are more subdued and the darkness is more fitting and atmospheric. So although the terrible outdoor lighting gets the game off on a bad foot, it doesn't ruin the game by any means.

The puzzles are relatively simple, with several ways to solve many of them that are intuitive and logical. I would like a little more challenge, but I would rather have logical, simple puzzles, than challenging illogical ones. Not much more to say on these.

The story is simple, and could use some fleshing out, but for how long the game is it tells a pretty complete tale. Adding a few more puzzles and some more interactive story telling aspects could really help give the character a face, since even at the end I still know very little about her. As a psychological horror game goes, A Wolf in Autumn is acceptable, but there could be so much more. I would love to see it move through more phases, showing us a little more of each ""layer"" of the main character. 

Every now and again, a tin box in the middle of the room will light up and start beeping, which means you have a message from your mother waiting. The beeping wasn't too bad, if a little grating, but I feel like some of the horror was taken from the game by the fact that the tracks have to be played maunally. Also, as a note to the dev, why use the tin box when you already have a radio item that you can interact with? I feel like that could have been used, with static signaling when a message was available. Just a thought. The female voice actor used was good, although not stellar. There are no points where I was blown away by how good or bad she was, but she played the part and delivered the lines in a way that was consistent.

Overall, I enjoyed A Wolf in Autumn, although not the scariest horror game I've played, it did capture my curiousity with an interesting story. Id like to see where else this developer goes, since he seems to have a decent grasp of what makes a game scary, but needs to gain more experience in game design before he can really implement it.

[b]Tldr;[/b] This game is very indie, expect that. It is also very much worth 2 dollars, so you'll be getting what you pay for, but expect 2 dollars worth of game. 

Note to Dev: I really encourage you to make this game again later on, with more people involved in the design. I like the story and direction, and I would enjoy learning more about the characters and playing through the puzzles.",1446082774,1446082774,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,1446220604.0,"""I'm not sure what mood the dev was going for when he set those colors, but wonderland acid-trip was probably not it.""

As the product of an abusive childhood, this game was difficult for me to process and reflect on upon completion.  Even in saying that, this game was well worth playing for many reasons.  It has a surreal and visually interesting environment with real world mechanics and ""common sense"" puzzles.  Julie Hoverson did a fantastic job with the ""mommy dearest"" character, with the silent text narrative being just as compelling.  With all of the above combined, this game touches on many complicated topics and portrays an eerily acurate dipiction of what its like to struggle with isolation and the inner demons brought on by abuse.  If I could, I'd give David Szymanski a warm hug, because he or someone he knows clearly understands this issue.  I did a Let's Play for it, if you'd like to check it out.

Szymanski's storytelling prowess shows itself in every image, every sound, and most game interactions, creating an exploration of a topic that many other games shy away from (listen up 'cause gaming needs this. It's important).

A lot can be said about a user interface this smooth and simple that still yields so many different possible actions, but I still felt like there were unexplored gameplay possibilities this time around. Previous games felt tight and concise, without a wasted mechanic or item. Everything fed the tale, and the tale fed everything. Ultimately, I felt that the puzzle elements here could get in the way of the meat-and-potatoes (except where the two intertwined to wonderful effect with the button messages reacting to player actions).

Symbolism appears in abundance, and Szymanski uses that to reinforce the game's themes in smart ways. This is a game that will ask you to think about its content after it's complete. Maybe even play it a second time to help tie all of its elements together. It adds up to a whole that is equal parts thrilling (hinted threat), engaging (inquisitivity), and repulsive (overt threat). A masterful combination of horror craft.

The main takeaway is this (TL;DR): David Szymanski keeps getting better, in every sense. Technical improvements are obvious through screenshots. This game contains more classical game play than his previous titles. His stories are just as powerfully delivered as they have been since Fingerbones hit the indie horror scene.

And while some may contend that the game is too short (it is quite short), I contend that that is at least partially the point. The origins of literary horror took root in the short story, in the compact punch that format delivers best. These games are the interactive manifestation of that early horror tradition. You can't have Stephen King's long-winded ass without Poe, Hawthorne, and Lovecraft. And we can't rightly have unique interactive horror experiences without our short-form pioneers.

[b]PROS:[/b]

-weird art style with oversaturated colours and contrasting lights truly gives a dream/ nightmare feel to the game

-good sound design, the ominous noises manage to be unsettling

-strong voice acting

-good writing, I really appreciated the style used for ingame text and how things slowly made sense as I was playing the game 

-very disturbing and dark themes: the story behind the girl is unsettling and violent, the voice you hear can convey enough perceived violence and hate to become truly distressing

-straightforward puzzles reward exploration and logical thinking

[b]NEUTRAL:[/b]

-the oversaturated graphics won't be everyone's cup of tea

-you can only carry/ use one item at a time, the reason for this is eventually explained though

[b]CONS:[/b]

-you'll have to be careful where you drop an item when switching objects or risk having to hunt for it between the grass (thankfully, the most important items are given to you more than once)

-going back to the previous area saved my progress puzzle-wise but reset the position of every object, forcing me to get around to gather them and light candles again

-no subtitles

-it's quite simple, short as the Store page says (beaten in 45 minutes), basically no replay value

Having played The Music Machine I was curious to see what the dev had managed to do this time and, despite the short length and simple gameplay, I must say A Wolf in Autumn left quite an impression on me. As said before Szymanski doesn't shy away from darker themes and he surely isn't afraid to hold back here: what the voice says to you, its extremely violent and hateful tone and the details of certain events are truly unpleasant.

I think it works so well cause, without spoiling anything, the story is about events that do happen in real life and I like to think that certain actual facts can be way scarier than an imaginary monster due to the fact they do really happen and'd affect us, people we know or be something we've seen in a newspaper.

The gameplay itself is decent, you'll have to explore around to find tools and then use the right one on the right object: sometimes the solution might be less straightforward than it first seems and a couple objects/ levers might require you to think a bit. There's not much of a challenge though, the game is more interested in telling you a story rather than challenging your brain.

A Wolf in Autumn felt like a distilled form of what the dev is known for as a short and extremely unsettling journey that, when played in the dark and with headphones on as recommended, game me a few goosebumps due to how immersed I was in a truly unpleasant and quite real scenario. It's a game I recommend as an example of psychological horror done right.",1445970970,1446223825,True,48,1,0.751007020473480225,2,True,False,False,False,,,

This is it. I'm done. Whatever I could say afterwards would be pointless.

Ejem.

A Wolf in Autumn is about a girl locked down in a shed. The first puzzle is quite simple, but what I liked the most was the fact that there's not just one way to solve it. And the ones who follow may have another solution as well...

While other David's games puzzles are easy to solve (or almost nonexistent) this change is, I can tell, for the best (even I got stuck once).

The music in this game is less present as in The Music Machine, but it does sound good, and the ambiental sounds are well placed. 

It also has dubbed text! However, as English is not my primary language, even though I could understand the 95% of the words spoken, subtitles would be a nice addition.

Graphics have improved since last time, although I'm not very picky with this things as far as it looks nice and run smoothly.

Finally, the story is really great, as you don't know anything until it's too late... And perhaps even then you won't.

I personally recommend A Wolf in Autumn if you enjoy story-driven games, puzzles, and a little of horror in the cocktail.
And it's now just a single euro! Buy! Right now!

A Wolf in Autumn trata de una chica que aparece encerrada en un cobertizo. El primer puzle es sencillo, pero lo que más me ha gustado es el hecho de que no hay una única forma de resolverlo. Incluso los puzles que le siguen pueden que tenga más de una posibilidad...

Mientras que en otros juegos de David los puzles son fáciles (o inexistentes), este cambio ha sido a mejor (incluso me quedé atrancado una vez).

La música está menos presente que en The Music Machine (otro juego del autor), pero suena bien, y los sonidos ambientales están bien implementados.

¡Incluso tiene voces en el juego! Eso sí, puesto que mi idioma principal no es el inglés, pese a que entendí muchas palabras, unos subtítulos hubieran venido bien.

Los gráficos han mejorado desde la última vez, si bien es cierto que tampoco me preocupo por ellos, siempre y cuando funcionen bien.

Finalmente, con respecto a la historia cabe decir que está bastante bien. Sin desvelar nada lo único que puedo decir es que no sabrás realmente nada hasta que sea demasiado tarde... E incluso entonces quizás tampoco.

Recomiendo personalmente este juego a aquellos que les guste los juegos con una buena historia, puzles y, por qué no, un toque terrorífico. Y además, ahora mismo vale un euro. ¡Corred, malditos!",1445969911,1445975512,True,4,2,0.520974516868591309,0,True,False,False,False,,,
