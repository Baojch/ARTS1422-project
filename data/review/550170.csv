It could use more leagues, but after 20 hours I still haven't beaten it, and don't plan to anytime soon, as the last league is pretty rough. 
You can craft items, buy and sell items, you gain experience to level up and SP from battle that you use to give your guys passive stat bonuses. The heroes have a lot of skills they unlock as they level up and you usually play with a party of 4, but sometimes it's rarely 3, and the later stages allow a party of 5, which is nice. You can even get an armor piece that anyone can wear that doubles experience gain for the wearer. That is especially nice because only the recruits in your party gain experience from battle. 

I think you can really get a lot of time out of this game, but there are some aspects to it that I wish were expanded on, if not downright fixed. There is a certain area where you can talk to a man who offers 3 more leagues, but when you click on them nothing happens. I don't know if I was even supposed to get to him, as you have to walk through a wall and around the edge of the arena. So, more leagues to play in would be nice, but I have no idea if the dev is done working on the game or not.

There are tons of grammatical errors... like, more than I've ever seen in a game. Also, there's a weird ranking system that goes off of the time it takes to win a battle, but it doesnt pause while you're selecting your moves. So it's basically impossible to get S ranks unless you're way overleveled for the area, which is kinda weird because you could just grind higher level areas if you're that much stronger. The only way to get an S is to hold down spacebar and have the right action selections (which is usually just attack, but recently i've gotten spells pre-selected to clear mid-leagues with S's) beforehand so you kill everything in 1 or 2 moves. 

Overall it's cheap, I didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I do. It kind of makes you wanna find everything and craft that top tier gear, and beat that last league, which is a doozy. You can actually fight the last boss before you beat it I'm pretty sure... if it is even beatable. It might just go on forever.

It has a lot of heart. It does not take itelf very seriously but it also isn't a tryhard game. It is quirky and weird with it's story and characters and it's kinda clichee but kinda not.
The game has a friendship system where you get skillbooks from you teammates when fighting together enough times and there are secrets everywhere. The combat system is a jrpg system where each character has their own action speed dependant on their agility and if you are familiar with that there is nothing really new here but everything that is there is quite good. If you play a lot of jrpgs then it is probably going to be an easy game as long as you use any form of tried and true tactic but it is not braindead even if you know exactly what you are doing.
I don't feel like the game wastes my time since everything moves on so fast but you can theoretically grind everything forever if you feel the need to do so but you never have to.

All in all I like this game for what it is and for what it isn't. I like fighting and party levelling in jrpgs, making tactical decisions about what gear to wear and wich party composition to use for what and maybe a bit of crafting (all of wich you get in this game) and i don't like overly drawn out stories and having a plethora of npcs in every town wich might or might not be worth talking to (all of wich you don't get in this game).",1578402843,1578402843,True,2,0,0.529262065887451172,0,True,False,False,False,,1578773099.0,I just wanted to say thanks for the kind an real review about my game.

This review is hard for me now.  This is the first and only review I've ever changed my opinion on.  But this went from a hard negative, to neutral bordering on positive for me.  It still isn't something I would highly recommend but the developer has listened to my advice and taken IMMENSE leaps and bounds to make this a more enjoyable game.  

The ram titans now have a significantly higher chance to spawn, and most of them all drop some pretty good items.  Plus they are by far the greatest way to grind experience in the game.  Even if at later levels they are a bit of a joke.

The Architect league can finally be completed and the game can be beaten now!  I haven't yet beaten the game yet since there are a few bugs in regards to the final sections of the game now.

The ability system has been rehauled to make everything that little bit stronger, the unfortunate thing is that this still makes Andrea your primary damage dealer for the latter half of the game.

However there are some things that are majorly bugged like the fanbot which gets stuck at one point and gives out incorrect rewards, and then no rewards after a point.  Also the widow titan which due to the way the sheep league works seems to have a very low spawn rate.

If he continues to work out the bugs this will be a hidden gem in the rpg maker landscape.",1527612295,1555080529,True,1,0,0,5,True,False,True,False,,1548994004.0,Thanks for your patience and time.

Although the concept is good and execution is alright, I also know it's still in early access but to make this worthwhile for any price a few things need to be addressed.

1. Grammar: The game's writing is less than impressive. The dialogue is okay but can be made a bit more memorable with more effort, and there are many, many errors in grammar in here, to the point I had a difficult time enjoying it at points.

2. Difficulty: I did very little grinding, yet I'm sweeping through the entire game so far with ease. The ""boss"" fights aren't climatic in the least bit and took no effort to complete, with the only boss fight so far that made it hard enough to seriously enjoy was the Big Bad Wolf. With the game being this easy and the enemies all being very similar (except a few) in how they fight, I'm pretty much spamming Pow Pow Punch the entire game and nothing else besides the occasional Cure. With a heightened difficulty, the pacing of the game would be better and the players would feel more inclined to use more strategy besides one or two moves to win. The game's mechanics are extremely solid and in-depth to the point that once enemies become harder that the game itself is ready to accomodate for it.

3. Arenas: No real big issue here, except I wish from early on that there was more than just a simple one medium sized room area to explore with a few things in them. That's not to say it wasn't being used right however, with ice puzzles, pressing switches within swarms of enemies, and overall plenty of secrets and little things to discover each time, especially when you revisit old arenas, but at times I wish there were extra rooms to go through for a little extra depth as well.

Overall, with some tweaks, a few new things and overall closer attention to what makes a good RPG, this could become one of the best RPG Maker games out there, which is extremely worth the $3 pricetag. Let's just hope these adjustments come soon.",1517904255,1517904255,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,1518755018.0,"Thanks for the positive review and feedback.

I really believe that the dev could charge quite a bit more for this game and it would be completely justified. You cannot find a better game for this price point at all.

Its a rpg that has a series of colosseum battles called leagues that get harder and more varied with mechanics as you go up in the ladder. You will collect experience points, money, crafting materials, items, weapons, armor, friendship points, skill points, and fans as you battle your way to the top. You will also find secrets hidden around every corner in this game and it will let you know exactly when you found one. If you like collecting things it does have quite a bit to offer on that aspect.

You can build your characters to be a melee fighter, magic user or a battle mage that does both melee and magic quite well. Some characters are better suited for one roll over the other and you can tell by looking at their stat allocation and skills when you get that character which role suites them the best. You use either BP for melee type skills or MP for magic based skills. Each time you land an action you will gain more BP up to the max of 100 BP. It will carry over to the next fight so that you can save and store up your BP for the bosses. Each character has a special skill that they can use for 100 BP and it fills pretty decently to where you don't feel that your character is too op and you don't feel that it doesn't come around enough. Its a pretty well balanced system i think. 

The story isn't the strongest i have seen and it isn't the weakest i have read either. Its about par, but you can tell that the dev's 1st language is not english so expect some of the grammar to be just a little off. I don't find it that bothersome at all but it is noticeable so people who are pretty big sticklers you could have issues with that. Do i think that it would ruin your experience in the game, i don't think that it will but it might be bothersome to you

 As a rpg maker game the graphics are actually done pretty nicely. The game looks pretty good as you play it. The animations are clean and crisp, the sprites have good detail to them, and the environments are pretty decent as well. Never once as i played did i look at the screen and think that what i was seeing was badly done or not good to look at. I think the art is definitely nicely done

I don't remember much about the music so it neither bothered me nor was it memorable enough to stand out. It fits well enough within the game. With a game like this though you could just find your best epic battle music and let that play instead while you decimate all the foes one after another as you battle in league after league. 

Overall i just flat out enjoy this game and i am really looking forward to where this little gem goes. For 3 USD you cannot find a better rpg to waste away your free time. It already has quite a bit to do now and by the time it is done i foresee it having a lot of content that you could waste a lot of hours into. To me this is an easy buy if you like rpgs because the price point is just to hard to pass up for what you are getting now and for what will hopefully come in the future.

It is also a Fight Management Game where you recruit a team of fighters, and then go up the ranking in a series of tournament style fighting leagues. As you progress you also gather an increasing fan base, which then allows you to buy better gears and items.

There is also crafting in this game. Each fight drops crafting materials, which then allow you to craft useful stuffs. Another interesting aspect of this game is ""secrets"". There are many hidden details in this game that are not visible and you have to uncover them to gain ""secrets"". There will be rewards based on the number of secrets that you find.

Another interesting aspect of this game is the vendors (weapons, armor, items, accessories, etc). Many of the vendors are absent at the beginning of the game, and there are interesting quests that are needed to find them and bring them back to the fighting guild.

There are about 10+ different fighting leagues in the game, and most of them have unique features as well.  Some fighting leagues require you to activate switches, some are in ice-covered terrain where you slide along the surface, etc. It is these interesting features that make the different fights enjoyable and unique.

The best part of this game is that the developer is extremely helpful, and that the game is still in Early Access.  The developer is open to feedback and constantly put out patches to fix problems and improve on the game experience. He is still adding enhancement to the game and will doing so, based on consumers suggestions and requests. 

I highly recommend this game and feel that it is definitely worth the low price. It will give you many hours of enjoyment.",1488328375,1488399323,True,11,0,0.576990425586700439,6,True,False,True,False,,,

So To start off, I've reviewed a few RPG Maker games in the past and this one is among the few I really enjoy, the game is quirky and fun.  With quite a repetitive experience which is delivered rather well!  Combat is somewhat the same as your typical RPG game where it's turn based, however in this its time based (Look at FF7 for an example) which does give a good aspect of it.

There's also a function called ""friendship"" which I personally love in RPG games, it's always a good function to have however this is rather bland in this game but it does have a nice touch (Not telling anymore about this ;) )

There is some mild adult humor within the game along with possibly a few swear words (which personally is one of the reason I quite enjoy the game), you also get to ""assemble"" your team & gain popularity to unlock more things.

For more about the game I'd recommend paying for the game as it is honestly worth it.
 
I'd rate the game: 8/10 for an RPG game!",1482786611,1482786611,True,3,0,0.510029494762420654,0,False,True,True,False,,,

I got the steam key for free and that won't change anything on my opinion about this game.
Pros:
 In-Depth fighting and skills. You can make your choices on who you want in your party. The fans and friendship features are really good. Also got some achievements. Most rpgmaker games don't have those. Contracts are intresting and not too hard to do. A lot of secrets. Good idea/plot also just fight level up and recruit others to your party. Traditional Active turn battles from original final fantasys. Enemies are interesting and every league is different.

Cons: You get too much XP for doing absolutely nothing. Doesn't really have a story. You might have some performance issues and game crashes so save the game VERY OFTEN. Needs more action sequences.

Overall 8.7/10 one of the best rpg maker games i've made so far.

I will later publish a link to my video about this game.

Thank you for reading this and buy this game  if you like fighting.",1482148456,1482148456,True,4,0,0.506916940212249756,0,False,True,True,False,,,

The combat seemed pretty cool with a lot of depth already at only 90 minutes in.

The story was kinda dumb though, but not in a way that was obtrusive.

unfortunately every fight is timed, and I had serious lag.  This isn't the first time I've been unable to play an RPGMaker game because of performance issues, which is really troubling given the way they look.

I think I still reccomend the game, but if you have the same performance issues I did, then I think they'll be dealbreakers",1479447738,1479447738,True,5,0,0.509275853633880615,3,True,False,True,False,,,
