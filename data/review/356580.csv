A game where, if tentacled monsters control the media, and if media screws over women, even in a women-only place, then tentacles really are hazardous to women’s health: TRANS-itive Property/10

Ok, maybe the /10 joke was in poor taste, but as far as the game goes, I’m not exactly wrong.

-REVIEW-

You guys remember those Assassins Creed Chronicles games? They’re basically stealth games for the most part, except that they’re side scrollers, which kind of blew me away at the time. I’ve played a few stealth games before(notably MGS2), and I’m honestly not a fan of them, especially those ACC games. Having to sneak quietly around enemy forces, sometimes without being able to fight them, doesn’t exactly win me over when getting caught brings the heavenly host of bad guys down on me, and it certainly won’t help if you make it a side scroller. Those ACC games were boring, stupid, and pointless; they certainly aren’t doing the franchise any favors if the mainline games are practically open-world by comparison.

By comparison, Aerannis is practically an award winning title. Does it do as well if examined on its own? YES! Well, mostly.

Before I even get to talking about the game, I want to say this real fast: I believe that trans lives are human lives. If you take offense to this, then kindly stop reading the review and go away. Everyone else, keep going.

Let’s start with the story. Aerannis is basically a game that, behind the scenes, sought to show people, through the setting of a futuristic dystopia filled with women, nonsensical platforming in hub levels, and The Illuminati if they watched too many anime shows filled with tentacles, how transgender people have it rough with life in general(which they certainly do, from what I know). You play as Ceyda, an assassin for hire(NO, this game has nothing to do with ACC, thank goodness) who lives in a fictional province, Plovdiv, populated entirely by women. The plot kicks off when Ceyda is hired to find stolen power suits, only to stumble upon a conspiracy that basically reveals the supposedly peaceful and happy state of Plovdiv to be a media-based puppet show put together by the Illums. No, I didn’t make that name up. What follows is Ceyda being put on various assassination missions, largely depending on stealth mechanics, as she fights to figure out what these one eyed monsters are up to and how to reveal their BS to the public. Ultimately, the story is enjoyable and fits quite well with the gameplay style, being both fairly mysterious as to what’s going on, yet also fairly comedic as characters throw funny barbs around here and there. The dialogue itself is a winner simply because it fits with the high action game; discussions are quick and to the point, and a clear purpose is given to every mission.

On the downside, however…well, the story is great, but the background and setting are sorely lacking. For one, the worldbuilding is not really there. Sure, there are three notable locations: Plovdiv, the fairly generalized city with crazy tall buildings, Planina, a society of uniform women hoping to find a way to bring men back into the world, and the TERF Turf(I couldn’t make that up if I tried), or as I like to call it, the Republic of Misandria. The issue is, how was this whole province founded? Why exactly did they kick all the men out? What even happened to the men to begin with? More questions still bounce around my head with the characters in general, such as Ceyda’s whole background, not to mention if her gender change was willing or forcibly done, how the Ilums even snaked their way into society to begin with, and even how Ceyda got the power I won’t spoil in one of the endings. Actually, the other ending is pretty confusing as well, where’d that monstrosity come from? Basically, the story that we’re given is enjoyable, but I wish there’d been more lore as far as the province, the people, all that background stuff.

Ok, on to gameplay. As I said, Aerannis succeeds where ACC fails simply because the stealth and platforming blend incredibly well. The game keeps things fast, for starters. Yeah, you may have to wait around for guards to position themselves here and there, but as soon as an enemy has their back turn, it’s grab, kill, move on. Stealth kills are further emphasized by having regular shots deal less damage to “grab foes,” as I call them, especially those with armor. You also get a few tools to assist you: a noisemaker to distract foes, a proximity explosive, and a boomerang for the occasional out of reach button. The levels vary in length, but I feel the challenge scales very well, with easy levels to start, and more challenging locales toward the end. Finally, the metroidvania-esque layout gives good reason to explore everywhere and see what the world has to offer.

Of course, there are problems. For one, and maybe it’s just me, but I’m not a fan of the “you get spied, you get died” levels; it’s irritating enough without the knowledge that being caught means restarting the whole section of level you were on. I get the emphasis on stealth, and I know story reasons were given, but it’s such a downer knowing some levels can be as punishing as MGS2’s highest difficulty, regardless of how quickly the game over screen can be skipped. Also, while it isn’t a deal breaker, I’ve noticed the camera gets a bit janky and occasionally lags behind center position. Finally…look, I get it, there’s platforming, but why are some of the city zones a pain to navigate? Planina and TERF usually require a lot of jumping around and such for some reason, which can drag things a bit. Certainly doesn’t help that this ‘vania lacks, of all things, A MAP.

That said, the aesthetics are well done. I’m a sucker for pixel art, and it all looks great here, especially the few close-ups of Ceyda. I do wish the color purple hadn’t been used QUITE so much, as it tends to stale up the backgrounds a bit. Music and sound are lively and good as well; I rather enjoy the variety in the tunes; some are lively and others more mysterious.

I don’t usually dig the idea of games used for causes that risk political ire, but I stand behind this one; the action is fun, it looks and sounds great, and putting its message behind a solidly morbid and dystopian setting gives me the idea that I’m enjoying a game rather than sitting through a forced lecture.

Aerannis is a game that steadfastly refuses to be confined by tradition, and bravely forges its own trail instead. 

Look: It's not that the creators of Aerannis have a ""wrong"" perspective on their social issue of choice, it's that they seem to have no perspective at all. This game expresses an understanding of the trans rights movement (and of feminism generally) that extends no further than half a youtube video essay and a few angry twitter threads.  

Maybe instead of filling the game with what are by now absurdly outdated memes, they could have spent some time reading a single book about the subject they decided to write about. Alternatively, they could have spent some of that time polishing the clunky controls, or adding reasons to explore or backtrack, or adding some kind of map, or improving enemy AI so they don't kill each other more easily than they kill you.

🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 *

In Aerannis, you take on the role of Ceyda Farhi, a transgener woman and assassin with cybernetic legs. The world is a cyberpunk near future in which most of the world has been destroyed, the implication is by forever wars, and the few remaining humans live in a toxically-TERFy Matriarchal society, wherein most AMABs take HRT and elect to live as trans women. These are called ""Snowflakes."" AFAB women rule the roost in Plovdiv, and the implied commentary on the Patriarchy of IRL modern society is entertaining. 

Ceyda, however, is not one of these ""Snowflakes"" as she reminds others during the story. She was already a woman before the revolution. 

Very quickly, the plotline becomes a conspiracy story of lovecraftian tone, wherein the Matriarchs have been infiltrated by God-beings who live forever and have enslaved an unwitting humanity. 

The game has a very Promethean-message that may be appreciated by other Magick practitioners. 

Gameplay is about 6-8hrs, and is a 2D, 8bit-stylised scrolling shooter with heavy stealth elements. Boss battles were frustratingly difficult in the ""Nintendo Hard!"" style of ages past, but the unlimited lives give you plenty of time to figure out your strategy and get gud. The story is quick and loud in iit's message, and has two possible endings, neither especially ""good"" or ""bad"" but both good sci-fi horror noir endings the story deserved. 

Aerannis is a game I will definitely replay

All in all, a fun little indie game. It takes a little getting into, but once you've passed the second mission and gotten used to the controls, it goes pretty quickly. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy it if I had a huge backlog. But if you have it and want a relatively mindless experience with a tiny modicum of challenge, then it's a good one to play and finish over a weekend.

[h1]The GOOD[/h1]
Controls were tight. Character movement didn't too floaty or anything.

Some light stealth options. But other than maybe two missions that require absolute stealth, you can also win by going in with guns blazing or shifting to attack when you fail in stealth.

Some of the missions are just about getting to the end of the level. In other cases there are bosses, which are pretty varied in their appearances and attacks. I'd say they're quite easy to beat with just a little thought to identify the pattern.

Two different endings (I think). You can load your previous game to replay just the end, so no need to go through an entirely new playthrough.

[h1]The BAD (or at least less good in this case)[/h1] 
One thing the game would benefit from is a map. I got lost a couple of times and it was frustrating running back and forth to find the target building, but fortunately the locations aren't too big, so ultimately I found what I was looking for.

It's a retro pixel-art game with some good detail on enemies, characters, and world.  It's kind of metroidvania-esque because you get upgrades that let you go to new areas.  You can shoot your gun and also charge it for a more powerful blast, though I almost never found it worth it compared to just spamming (which is kinda difficult to do and jump at the same time for me due to the placing of the buttons on the controller).  You also get a secondary weapon through finding upgrades, such as a distraction-beacon or  a proximity mine.)  You also get the fast-run an the wall-jump which are always fun in these metroid games and are satisfying to use when you need them to negotiate yourself into new areas of the game.

The sections of the game which require stealth (rather than it just being a good idea to stealth, you have to restart if you are spotted in these segments) can get a little frustrating, but the one spot where I actually gave up and went to go look up the answer resulted in me realizing I didn't actually have to get past the obstacle I was trying to get past and I had actually already achieved everything I needed to, which left me feeling a bit silly.

It has a lot of background art and characters which were topical at the time of the game's creation and probably were the result of backer-requests. 

I feel like there's a lot of phallic symbolism with one of the enemies that constantly seems to be haunting you throughout the game, and it becomes more pervasive once you hit ""Terf Turf"".  I think this is intentional given Ceydra's backstory.

At face value this looks like an amazing, dystopian-futuristic, megaman style platformer but it truly is so much more to than just run-and-shoot adventure.  

It is also more than a game that is inclusive to trans and queer like many reviewers have already mentioned.  One of the biggest points and topics of discussion this game brings up (that is often missed) to me is its story about how the world of Aerannis came to be.  That is when it really hit me:  This is a game about western society.  This is a game about us.  

This is a game that takes place in a world where men and males no longer have a place in society.  The remaining males have either been seemingly forced out of existence have undergone sex changes to become female.  This is the only way that males function in the society of Aerannis.  These men are forced to live in the fringes and outskirts of society and are called ""snowflakes.""  They are harassed and treated poorly.  I could not help but think of parallels to ""snowflakes"" in the real world, where people get called a ""snowflake"" for being over sensitive or over virtue signaling, and the term is generally used by the political-right as an insult.

In this world the patriarchy was destroyed by women and women reigns supreme over everything and everyone.  Some of the female leaders actually look like pixel versions of some popular feminists that you might recognize (the leader looks like Anita and you may see some familiar looking super heavy looking females with awfully brightly colored hair).  It seems to me that a world of radical feminism is what the author was trying to portray, and all the harassment, insults, and unfair treatment that the player will witness is not there for inclusiveness alone.  The harassment and the insults are directed at all of us players, not as males or females but as human people.  Aerannis is the kind of world we will create if we continue to destroy the men of western society, and mindlessly spread the ideals of radical feminism.  

Actual game review:  
Story - There is a lot going on in the story of this game, and while the dialogue is engaging and gritty with a very ""real"" feel to it, I found following the story kind of confusing at times.  The dialogue text only stays on the screen for a few seconds so if you're not a fast reader then you will likely miss something important since all this games story is through dialogue or short cut scenes with text.  I only wish the game would let you press next instead of it going to the next text bubble on its own.  

Gameplay - your character feels kinda slow and floaty in a bad way at first.  You do get some power ups which make certain aspects of gameplay more fun and allow access to new areas.  There are combat missions where you basically go into a building Cowboy Bebop style and kill everyone, and there are some stealth type missions and both are fairly fun.  I think the gameplay would have been a lot more fun with some Bananza Bros (genesis) style shoot-outs where you could shoot from a corner and then hide back into it, but overall its good.  There was just one helicopter chase sequence that gave me a lot of trouble due to the types of powerups I had at the time I kept jumping off walls back into the helicopter...  The dev should take a look at this because it was a frustrating experience but otherwise the gameplay was good.  Probably a 7/10 by itself.

Music:  Sooo good.  If you like 80's style trance wave music at all you're in for a treat.  This is one of those games I would play again for the sound track alone.  Not only is the music great but it fits the games scenery and storyline really well.  It really makes me wonder whether the music was made for the game or vice versa!

The good:  Great game.  It is such a unique experience that I think any gamer would be happy to play this one all the way through.  Took me about 7.5hrs to complete the game once.  I would say it is worth playing for just the narrative and story alone.  

The bad:  The run and shooty gameplay might be too bland for some.  

Overall:  8/10  - Definitely worth playing!

With the rest of the world having been more or less destroyed and depopulated, what remains in Plovdiv is a dystopian and authoritarian post-revolutionary society in which all men have been forced to transition to women through hormone replacement therapy, and are for this reason discriminated against by the populace and government at large, being negatively denoted as ""Snowflakes"" The game sees you take control of Ceyda Fahri, an assassin, and more or less focuses around Cedya's plight as a hired gun in Plovdiv.

First to the plot: The protagonist of Aerannis, Ceyda Fahri, is a trans woman; in a few cutscenes, she asserts that she knew who she's been since before the revolution. Nevertheless, she suffers the same sort of discrimination as have Snowflakes in the aftermath of the revolution, and many points throughout the game are rooted and related to Ceyda's identity; from her being harassed at a bar to being decried as a confused man by an assassination target of hers. The plot is the sort of thing that you'll certainly get more mileage out of if you're queer, with critiques of anti-trans feminist organizations rooted in second wave feminism, to a general commentary of trans women in society generally. As Ceyda's jobs grow increasingly harsh and varied, she finds herself deeper and deeper into Plovdiv's organization as a whole.

As for the style of the game: The game is a Metroidvania style platformer set through numerous scenes and settings and even more soundtracks. Visually and auauditorily, the game is beautiful, and is easily the best aspect about the game, with each individual stage and setting having a generally unique tone and atmosphere to it; the soundtrack of the game knows its place, allowing tones to stick out in your mind easily, and it greatly works to the game's benefit.

To the game's gameplay, though things are a bit less praise-worthy. In many respects, the game is similar to a Valve title's capacity to train the player for certain game mechanics; I didn't myself have any issue getting a hand on the gameplay, rather how certain elements are implemented and their innate flaws; wall-jumping, a feature introduced fairly early in the game, as one of Ceyda's first new abilities gained as she progresses through the story, is hard to get the grasp of, and most fo the time feels as if you're trying to climb up a snowy hill, but every step you take causes you to slide a few places down. The gameplay is, in contrast to the plot and style of the title, its least refined aspect; steath missions that make you want to metaphorically punch the computer because you were spotted and have to restart the level all over again have a certain ""Super Meat Boy"" or ""Cuphead"" vibe to deaths; death seems normal and a way to progress the game because after you die 20 times to the same goddamn guard and you reset to the start you'll get down that maybe it's not the best idea to do what you've been doing. That said, the stealth missions are where this game exceeds; stealthy missions where you can go your own pace command a unique level of craftsmanship not seen in non-stealth levels, which usually devolve into how fast you can brute-force the foes more than anything, which really gives stealth missions more nuance than non-stealth ones. The game has minor bugs, but I wouldn't say they're really worth genuinely attacking the game for; they're minor at best and don't impact gameplay too seriously.

If I had to give Aerannis a subjective review on its commentary on trans issues and second wave feminism's reaction to trans women as a trans woman myself, while also neatly working in the protagonist being a trans woman without making it too explicit as to show a lack of care for the subject, I'd give it a 9/10. If I had to give it an objective review on the basis of its gameplay elements and how tiring missions seem to be, I'd give it a 7/10 or a 6/10 if I'm having a bad day.

My views on this game are mixed; I'd probably be less inclined to give it such high praise if it wasn't about a subject not traditionally covered by the medium of video games. A special thanks to gamer gate, for really fighting for free speech by throwing a ree fit every time a Queer theme dared enter your beloved industry. But jokes about dishonest pseudo-intellectuals aside, Aerannis isn't the sort of game that I would really pick up if it weren't for the fact that it touches on trans issues, and I kept playing because it touched on them in the ways I expect a game touching on those issues to do so. It's nuanced and its flow is kept proper and respectful, while also showcasing societal transphobia in a well-organized fashion. So for those reasons, in spite of the fact that I'm not regularly into Metroidvania games, that I stuck around in Aerannia and played it the way through, and I guess that's the sort of thing that really propels me to recommend it as a title when the gameplay itself is what I would consider enjoyable at best and inadequate at worst.

In short: If you're a Queer person who wants a game that touches on transphobia in both society and in TERFy second-wave feminism, Aerannis is going to proably be a fun title for you. If you aren't Queer and are just looking for a fun platformer, I'm 50-50 split as to whether or not I can espouse the same cheers for your decision here.",1546873867,1546873867,True,0,0,0.466448426246643066,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Let's back it up.
I was introduced to this game in passing during a Twitch stream. The pitch was, and I kid you not, ""it has a transgender protagonist.""
I wish I could say that was reductive, but in truth, Aerannis is a game with a transgender protagonist. And that's mostly it.

The game's narrative is the core focus. It's a very linear experience and the story hinges on some very specific ideas.
Some of you, I'm sure, read ""transgender protagonist"" and, like I did, had something of a cynical reaction.
This game having been on sale for $0.50, I decided to see for myself. Almost immediately the developer's sociopolitical biases are made clear. And if you don't get it in the first half hour, a lategame cameo by Vivian James and a not-so-subtle jab at /adgd/ should paint the picture well enough. Also one of the main antagonists resembles notoriously-combative feminist Chanty ""Big Red"" Binx.

So what IS the narrative?
In the year 2XXX, Ceyda is a paid assassin fulfilling hits as instructed by her friend Elsa. They live in a very purple world known as Plovdiv, and we learn that Plovdiv is the only surviving civilization on Earth. On top of this, men no longer exist. Apparently, men are forced to undergo sexual reassignment, and then are outcast as ""snowflakes.""
Would you believe me if I said most of what I understand from this plot comes from the Kickstarter and Steam store descriptions?
The game itself does a very poor job bringing its world to life--characters are more frequently lost in wink-wink-nudge-nudge monologues about humanity.
Plot elements are introduced by the characters just stating that it's there. Along the way it's revealed that Plovdiv is run by shapeshifting aliens. I couldn't tell you how Ceyda learns this to save my life. She just suddenly understands that it's real and we've immediately moved past any phase of disbelief in this fantastical revelation.

The game has two endings. The one I got involved awakening Satan (yes, Satan) whose role is to imbue humanity with knowledge so that they will realize the existence of Illums (a phrase which is literally used for the first time mere moments before this ending), allowing them the freedom to choose their own path knowing the truth.
I get it. Ja feel. I vibe with that. But it felt more like I was being preached to than having a story built around this concept.

I don't know what the other ending is. I'm not playing it again to find out.

Suffice to say, the story-centric game is very clumsy about its story. Dialogue is poor, characters are paper-thin, the world feels more like window dressing and the villains are little more than an allegory for the thing ektomarch doesn't like very much in real life.
But that's not the only thing that's clumsy about Aerannis.

Let's talk about how the game actually plays.
Not very well.

When the brief credits rolled, I was honestly surprised to learn that this game had playtesters. Ceyda controls poorly, and key mechanics do not function intuitively. Simple things are completely overlooked.
Text boxes appear in three fashions. In a fixed timer which counts down in the corner, with an invisible timer and the option to manually skip, or they will stay on screen forever until you close it. Why is it so inconsistent?
When interacting with these textboxes, or other menus, Ceyda's character controls are still functional. Meaning that you can and will see her jump and move around when using this interface.

Ceyda can shoot her gun, throw three different bomb types, and dash. The dashing is the only fun I had the whole game because going fast is fun and it has a cool visual effect. Being stealth-minded, the combat in this game is simply not given much thought. Fair enough, but most of the latter half of the game won't even require stealth so... maybe there should've been more care put into it.

Ceyda learns two key functions: ledge grabbing and wall jumping. Neither of these work well. Ceyda will sometimes grab ledges automatically. Sometimes she won't. This can and will get you into trouble because this is ostensibly a stealth game and those require a bit of mechanical finesse.
Wall jumping is clunky and unreliable, doubly-so in the presence of ledges which you may or may not grab onto.
Much of my playtime was struggling with these two mechanics as I navigated the world.

Speaking of the world navigation, it's kind of bad.
Let's get one thing clear: Aerannis LOOKS good. Not the character sprites, frankly. But the environments are very pretty.
However, the visual information they convey as a function of gameplay leaves something to be desired. It's difficult to discern which objects are platforms, which ones have ledges and where, and even whether or not something is even there. On multiple occasions, you will find tiles which are visually identical, but you can stand on one and not the other.

To call this game a Metroidvania as many have is being very, very generous. A Metroidvania is made distinct through its expansive, connected map and utilization of character upgrades to access new areas, often involving a continous back-and-forth between locales which naturally promotes one to learn the layout of the map like a second home.

Ceyda only has a limited amount of new skills to learn, and the one time you return to a previous location, you do need a skill you didn't have before--but that skill leads you immediately to a door locked behind a story trigger; just why?
If you came to this game because you enjoy Metroidvanias, you have been lied to.

Furthermore, even knowing where to go is a trial in and of itself. The overworld map is large, which means a lot of travel time in-between mission locations. A lot. Most of the time you will be given directions like ""it's the house east of here,"" and left to your own devices. Getting to where you need to be doesn't feel like I'm learning this city, but more like I'm stumbling around until I find the glowing arrow that wasn't there before.
The maps function better as wallpapers than video game levels.

As you might imagine, the game does feature a small variety of boss fights. They're all visually and mechanically distinct, however much like everything else, they are sub-par at best. Although I very much like the designs of the bosses, the fights themselves leave something to be desired, either being too simple or too clunky to be any fun.

The one true success of Aerannis is the soundtrack. I recommend you check it out on YouTube. It's pretty good.

As for the game itself, I cannot recommend it. Not even for fifty cents. Go buy a gumball. The promised flavor fades all too quickly until you are left with a limp, unsatisfying imitation of what you bought.
So it's very much the same experience, but it'll save you six hours.

While all AMAB people were forced to transition after the game's oft mentioned revolution, the protagonist is a trans woman. As she tells one enemy, ""I knew who I was before the revolution. It didn't change my identity at all"". However, she is still treated as less than a woman by her tyrannical government, and as a ""brainwashed man"" by most of the rebellion. As one review put it best: ""the government of Aerannis is feminist in the same way the Soviet Union was Communist. In theory and name, yes, in practice not at all"". Interspersed in Aerannis's science fiction plot and psychedelic imagery, I've found a poignant critique of TERF ideology within feminism, and of transphobia in society as a whole (for example, one brief scene shows the protagonist going into a public restroom only for a toilet to transform into a fanged monster and swallow her whole).

You play as Ceyda Farhi, a Bulgarian Turk who also happens to be a transgender woman and an assassin. She lives and operates in the city of Plovdiv, which is a woman-only society and one of the last (maybe only? Kind of not sure) societies left on the planet.

Plovdiv seems like a peaceful and just society on the surface, but behind the scenes there's a lot stuff like assassinations and throwing people in jail for dissenting with the status quo. Not to mention, things kind of suck if you're a transgender woman. You're tolerated, but definitely treated like a second-class citizen.

As Ceyda, you go on missions, taking out targets and getting paid, business as usual. Soon, you start to encounter some pretty weird shapeshifting creatures and discover that revolution-level shit is about to hit the fan- and you're the only one who can try to stop it.

So the story and the world are both really cool. Not to mention, the graphics and the music are downright incredible. This game has some really high production value in it for being a pretty obscure indie game. I played through the roughly 6-hours of gameplay in only a few sittings- it was the kind of game that's tough to put down. The game sort of feels like a weird cross between Megaman, Metroid, and some kind of stealth game. There's a lot of opportunity in most of the missions to get creative with the tools you have, as well as your platforming skills, and take on each challenge in your own way.

Now, here's the thing. The game is lacking some polish in areas that it really should have been polished. In my play-through I've run into nothing game breaking, but there definitely are some issues. First, the physics and collision had some issues- I never got stuck anywhere, but there were some weird moments where I clearly was standing on nothing, or it clearly looked like I should be able to fit somewhere, but couldn't. In addition, Ceyda just feels a little too floaty. The physics of the game felt like they needed some tweaking to make them feel more fluid. It's also worth noting- the AI are only mildly smarter than rocks. Enemies frequently get stuck or kill each other. Some of the level designs were also incredibly iffy and not fun to play through- certainly not a majority though.

There were also a lot of issues with the story. I really liked the story and the characters, but cutsecnes sometimes either played too fast through dialogue, or forced me to wait too long. Not only that, but the story itself just felt kind of disjointed. In some spots, you don't get enough information on what's going on, and in others, you get really huge reveals that are the followed with little to no change in the game world.

Speaking of the game world... it's also a little disjointed. It's confusing to navigate at first, but once you get the hang of it it just feels like you warp around to different areas, or just walk down the street and you're at your next objective.

Overall... I still recommend the game. I had a lot of fun, and what's good about the game is REALLY AWESOME, and what's bad isn't game breaking and doesn't ruin the whole game.",1519186369,1519186550,True,4,0,0.503747045993804932,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The cultural backdrop upon which Aerannis is painted is the historical internal controversy within second-wave feminism over the role of transgender women in the feminist movement. This conflict was fairly subcultural in our world, but is writ large in Aerannis as part of a war over the very freedom or subjugation of humanity. Our protagonist is Ceyda Farhi, a trans hit-woman with a cynical heart and a painful past.

Discussing this game in relation to the experiences of being transgender can be difficult. At times, it feels like a heavy-handed approach by someone who's a little unclear on what others have been saying. More than one other reviewer on the web has noted that having a transgender female viewpoint character repeatedly attempting to assassinate cisgender women can feel unfortunate taken out of context. I have thought that depicting this conflict as cosmic and apocalyptic, rather than tractable and human, runs the risk of giving people the wrong impression if this is their first exposure to the issue.

Then there are the moments that are so spot-on that it's hard to attribute their origin to anything but relayed personal experience. One particularly inspired moment is [spoiler]walking into a public restroom in ""TERF Turf"" that feels designed to inspire fear even [i]before[/i] you find out that the toilet is a carnivorous shapeshifter[/spoiler] - cartoonishly absurd and depressingly real all at once. An off-hand reference to soybeans' estrogen-mimic properties is tedious in 2020, when ""soyboy"" has become a standard political insult, but read as a sly nod in 2015 when I first played this game. That said, things like the Vivian James cameo suggested to me that the creator was more interested in stirring the pot than anything.

The game's visual look is memorable. The game's Plovdiv is a neon-soaked Eastern Bloc techno-metropolis, architecturally surreal enough to remind us that we're not quite meant to intuit how this ""utopian"" post-revolution civilization really works. Trippy one-eyed ooze-creatures lurk in every dark corner: not merely [spoiler]creeping in from elsewhere, but seeping out from the very foundation of this society[/spoiler], as we gradually learn. The visual look is one of my favorite parts of the game and one of the reasons I might cite for coming back to it.

The gameplay is entertaining in the moment, though nothing especially unique. It's a platformer with stealth elements and a few new tricks to learn along the way. The premises of missions vary, even if it does mostly boil down to ""kill your way to the top of the ladder"". Some missions have tricks to them; others a few different approaches to try. A few of the missions, like the [spoiler]jailhouse[/spoiler], can be downright aggravating when a slight mistake can blow a few minutes of progress.

I don't regret the time I spent playing it. It technically delivers on its promise of having a transgender protagonist, and that was once enough to get me to splash out $15 on the crowdfunding campaign, and while I don't think that was a bad decision, it also doesn't make the final product good. The more I think about it, the more I have no idea what the hell the developer was trying to do with this game. If you want to try and puzzle that out, this game might be worth your time and money; but the gameplay is forgettable, and the plot makes less and less sense as the game goes on, as well as every time I think about it after having played it. That said, it's currently showing up as only a dollar, so you don't stand to lose much if you give it a try.",1511595801,1597688197,False,0,0,0.558540821075439453,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Scroll down for TL;DR version.

Right off the bat, I'll start by saying that I played Aerannis with a controller and on Windows 7 on the normal difficulty. I experienced no bugs/glitches/softlocks or anything of the sort in my entire playthrough. The one thing I thought may have been a graphical glitch was likely just a trippy special effect for one of the boss fights, and didn't mess with my gameplay at all.

I must admit, I knew about Aerannis for a long while, and was pretty interested in the [i]concept[/i] of it, but I was put off by the mixed Steam reviews and how it hadn't really ""caught on"". Eventually I was swayed by Steam e-mailing me about the game going on sale, and I told myself ""Eh, I've spent more than a few dollars on games I didn't enjoy."" Turned out to be worth it to me, in this case.

Aerannis has a mix of stealth missions and run-and-gun missions. Most of the time, ""stealth"" means ""don't let anybody see you"", but it can occasionally also mean ""don't shoot people or cameras"". Run-and-gun missions usually have stealth opportunities in them, but often it's just not practical, or straight-up impossible (i.e. boss fights). If you dislike stealth [i]or[/i] run-and-gun, I wouldn't recommend Aerannis. I enjoy both styles of gameplay, to the point that Aerannis kept me hooked long enough to play it all the way through in one sitting and see one of the endings.

Platforming was mostly solid. I was grumbling about dodgy controls at first, but it didn't take me long to get used to them. Ceyda (the player character) starts off with being able to jump, crouch, slide (Mega Man style with down + jump) and crawl through short spaces. Throughout the game she'll learn how to grab ledges, wall jump, and sprint. The in-game tutorials were pretty good about introducing these mechanics as you needed them. There are no true pitfalls; feel free to make a leap of faith if you feel you need to for exploration.

There are some elements I don't often see in 2D platformers that gave this experience more flavor. Enemies are capable of friendly fire, and a lot of them seem to go berserk (especially in enclosed spaces) when they spot you, so there are often hilarious self-destructs and team kills. You can also hurt yourself with the sticky bombs that you'll acquire partyway into the game, so watch where you chuck those, especially since they do more damage to you than most enemy attacks do. Note that if you decide to go in guns blazing, Ceyda is an assassin, not a commando. Attack from a distance and from advantageous angles; she has no upper hand up close unless she's behind an unaware target. A lot of enemies can soak up quite a bit of damage if you're not insta-killing them via stealth. They also have a habit of clinging to you, since they seem to be aware of the fact that contact damage exists. Honestly, I don't think contact damage is a good mechanic for the human enemies in this game; I'd have preferred if it only existed on the robots/aliens that it makes sense for (like the alien bats, or the robot worms that can roll into a ball and ram into you).

One common thing I noticed in other reviews is people being confused about where to go in whatever mission, but I didn't run into this trouble myself. In order to not run into this problem, do two things: 1) Actually read what's being spoken in-game, as most of the information you get is useful in some way. 2) Explore everything that has a little arrow over it; the game is pretty good about not opening up places of interest until you can actually accomplish something there. Pretty similar to what games were like before the era of Wikis and objective markers.

Although the gameplay was what kept me playing, the initial hook was a trans woman protagonist (which are simply not a thing ever), and I wasn't disappointed in her. I found Ceyda pretty relatable on more levels than just being a trans woman. Ceyda's habit of shooting people in the middle of a conversation is something I often wish would happen in other games. Her sharp tongue, excellent problem solving skills, and no patience for bullshit while not being [i]completely[/i] shut off to different ideas meant that I was never groaning at the stupidity of the meat puppet I was in charge of.

Apparently, there are people who have been offended by certain aspects of Aerannis' setting, themes, etc.. Right off the bat, let's get one fact straight: in this game's world, men aren't around anymore. All combatants are either human women, machines, or shapeshifting aliens. It doesn't make sense to play the ""misogyny"" card at the violence happening against the women in the game for this reason. You also can't kill civilians. It's not really anti-feminism, either; if feminism is supposed to be about ensuring that people all get basic human courtesy and equal opportunity regardless of gender, that isn't what's portrayed here.

The only real-world folks that really get no mercy here are TERFs. Note that ""TERF"" in this case is not the kind of person who would say that trans women and natal women are different, thus face different problems and not necessarily be able to see eye to eye all the time...but rather, the kind of person who would say that trans women are the same as men and use that as an excuse to look down on them as vermin. Just play Aerannis and look at how the (human) antagonists in the government are portrayed. People who conduct themselves as those characters do are the ones who I would use the word TERF in reference to. I think I've said enough about that, though. This is a game review, after all.

TL;DR:

Here's what I liked:
+ Fun mix of platforming, shooting and sneaking. Mixed enough to prevent any one of them from getting too stale.
+ Very little hand-holding, I had to actually figure the missions out for myself.
+ Excellent price to content ratio.
+ Great soundtrack (find it on Bandcamp and pay what you want for it).
+ Everything about Ceyda's character.
+ Speaking as someone who typically doesn't like boss fights, I liked the ones in this game. They all felt unique.
+ Death is pretty forgiving (note that I mean actual death, not necessarily mission failure in general).
+ Non-human enemies were fun to fight.
+ Getting to shoot some virtual TERFs. These ones had it coming, trust me. Play the damn game.

Here's what I didn't like:
- Human enemy AI can be annoying (although sometimes hilarious). They act more like Zerglings than people if they see you, and sometimes get stuck in a loop.
- There were some parts of the terrain that I couldn't tell were able to be grabbed or crawled through without trial and error. Sometimes things that looked like platforms weren't, and vice versa.
- There were a couple of stealth missions that could have used some extra checkpoints.
- Not really enough to do with all the nanomachines (currency). (If it turns out I'm an idiot and didn't explore enough, I'll revoke this nitpick.)
- Nameless NPCs could use some more dialogue, especially since the game has no voice acting.
- Controls took me some getting used to, especially the wall jump. Ceyda also has a lot of trouble going prone.
- Ceyda can't shoot while prone, which is a major pain.

Here's what I'm on the fence about:
+/- The graphics. I don't dislike them enough to complain about them, but I don't like them enough to sing their praises.
+/- Aerannis is short. The length is fine for the price, and I feel I got my moneys' worth, but I know a lot of people don't like short games (and I know I'd have wanted it to be longer, mainly because I enjoyed it).
+/- I have a [i]lot[/i] of unanswered questions about the lore. This annoys me, but at the same time, it allows me to come up with my own ideas.

In conclusion, Aerannis deserves more love and more buyers. Give it a go. I was way too late for the Kickstarter, but if a sequel or spin-off ever happens, I'll definitely support it.",1511195964,1511209918,True,7,0,0.575404822826385498,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It has beautiful background art, an excellent, moody soundtrack, and great writing wherein it fairly successfully tackles modern political topics in a progressive way. Most notable is the fact that a large proponent of the game's women-only society subscribes to a trans-exclusionary radical feminism that actively oppresses Ceyda, Aerannis's trans protagonist. 

The combat, stealth puzzles, and platforming are fun and engaging, while being just difficult to stump me in a few places. Controls are occasionally a little finnicky, but not so much so that I ever felt like putting the game down. If you're a fan of stealth, you will find Aerannis enjoyable.

I was mostly drawn to this game because of its trans protagonist and progressive politics. Reading some commentary around the game online, it seems some people are hesitant to believe Aerannis truly is progressive due to it being co-opted by some discriminatory groups (ie. Gamergate) because the game appears, on a surface level, to be anti-feminist. GG also bought its way into the game with a cameo thanks to a Kickstarter tier. Rest assured that their presence in the game isn't noticeable if you don't know what to look for, and the game's overall message (""transphobia is bad"") is clear by the end. Either way, most of the politics fall away in the last hour or so in favour of the very satisfying Lovecraftian conspiracy based around the shapeshifters that have engineered the game's world into its current state.

TLDR: This is a CtuhuluPunk stealth metroidvania with massive confusing levels, no map. The stealth is hard and almost like a stiff puzzle game. I gave up.

EDIT: I decided to watch a Lets Play. My old impressions of the first part of the game is at the bottom.

Okay the plot for this game is actually genius, you could make the next Deus Ex game with the factions at each other's throats, the conspiracy layers... It goes from social justice counter revolutions to hormone replacement terrorism to political corruption to machine takeover, to the illumini to ctuhulhu timelords, it is all well tied together too narratively. 

I really could not stomach the gameplay loop of this. Just too hard, figuring out where to go and who to talk to could take me 20+ minutes of careful exploration and pixelhunting. I would treat each corridor tactically and try to reverse engineer the puzzles.

The Lets play I watched has... hundreds upon hundreds of repeating rooms and assets with more and more obstacles in the way... I dont think I would had gone through it with my approach. I dont know how the youtuber did it.

Conclusion: Hard pass for the gameplay, decent story, wasted mostly unique setting, dialogue was mostly decent to good. Pixel art and animations were good to great, but lacked diversity due to the size of the game, they had to recycle them a lot. The level design is atrocious, some UI elements and core features are lacking. Removing local content permanently and hiding from library so I can reprioritize my library around games that are better rounded and more readily enjoyable. 


OLD REVIEW

This game makes a surprisingly strong showing on paper when listing pros and cons but has dubious design flaws, an inane default button mapping, a lack of depth in critical areas, and a somewhat artificially convoluted plot to avoid handling its senstive subject matter

Pros:
+Controls are precise enough and feature gradually unlockable ease of use moves like ledge grabbing and wallclimbing. Also helps ease out the learning curve
+Commendable work on the retro sprites, environment sprites, artistic direction for foe design with the eye pattern repeating through, the geometric shapes and the vague allusion to robotics and shapeshifters was not bad. Neon lit signs and foreign sign lettering in hubs populated by fairly diversified looking npcs give a fairly fresh flow of new visual assets. Coupled with the arguably very well done music and sound effect tracks, and the overall pleasant user interface featuring a small hub of questlogs and you get a pretty great audiovisual package overall
+Animation work is on the okay side, with some great attention to detail sprinkled here and there in the form of idle animations for example
+Level design has some variety in the amount of action, precision, timing or flat out puzzle solving that it requires to allow progression. It is not the best in the industry, but with official checkpoints that act as teleporters and save areas and invisible checkpoints in between those to restart you at full health from death and you will find that the sometimes rougher part of certain levels can be brute forced very easily given how casual this game makes failure
+You can heal from fallen foes by collecting little orbs occasionally, you can also loot little currency crystals. The game allows for the use of a powerup that acts a distraction decoy which opens up level design solution possibilities especially in linear, guarded areas. The game stays consistent with the cyberpunk theme when adding new moves by giving them a cybernetic lore exposition related to your prosthetics.
+Game is a melting pot of rather current, and relevant ideas as they pertain to the social fabric of society at large, and even to some extent gaming. It is utopian, post apocalyptic, post patriarchy, hub-centered, low earth population, female only, robotics dominated, big brother corporations driven ultra urban cybperpunk setting with strong thematic elements to feminism but handled in a manner that does not immediately rub your face in social and political messaging and instead lets the story just unfold as it would
+Protagonist is your typical but relatable bounty hunter type that works for the man, ressourceful, jaded. It is a trope but it works well.
+Excellent Xbox360 pad support and some of the best resolution support I have seen for games of this tier

Cons:
- Game takes multiple dashes into the wilder elements of the cyberpunk universe, is evasive, and otherwise superficially handles the subject matter that it introduces appearing shallow and padded, and does not correspond with the risk taking attitude of picking that topic to begin with which leaves it with a confused tone that the game successfully makes up for with light heartedness and well placed snide line but it tries to skirt too many people's edges and ends up compromising too much to have anything really meaningful to say even a fair bit into the storyline
- Game's control scheme is inuituitive and will lead to constant reloads, the problem is by the time you find out there is a problem your muscle memory is already halfway through adjusting to the new layout so it really is a pain. In my case I found that the GRAB/SHOOT buttons should had been swapped out with each other and I would had been fine with the rest but there is a lot of variance in the type of issues people run into with this game's controls
- Game does not have any real RPG hybrid elements and the cyberpunk setting just BEGS for it. The game features stealth and action mechanics and elements. So a lot of potential power ups and options could had been put in. NPCS who acts as merchant makes excellent exposition givers for the world setting, and give a reason for backtracking other than turning in quests. They are also a great source of sidemissions. So much wasted potential here. No character sheet or special ability to speak of either, no prosthetics swaps nothing.
- The stealth elements are very easy to figure out on a puzzle solving level, but the solutions are very hard to execute by the player due to the control issues and sometimes the level design itself.
- The game does not allow you to aim, you cannot twin stick, you cannot even aim in stiff pre-determined angles like in CONTRA where you could aim up or at 45 degrees angles. 
- The game features a lot of dumb, slow moving foes, that will slowly surround you and since you cannot aim it makes dodging and killing them tricky and tedious. The game also features a lot of foes that can tank a lot of damage, and you have no way to improve your damage or otherwise dispatch them better which limits your options

Final Words: I am at the point in the storyline where the main quest giver gets kidnapped and I find myself intrigued enough to want to find out exactly how the dev spun out this game's thematic and storyline. I find myself really let down as this is more of a sidecroll adventure than a real metroidvania game. I would had gladly taken an option that expands stealth tools or another option that allows you to aim as I thought this would had given a lot of different players ways to adapt the game to their playstyle and also provide workarounts for some of the game's shortcomings. It would also give purpose to the game's currency. I also find the lore lacking and the world exposition a little thin. The game has a little too much going on, and does too little with it which leaves it scatterbrained and hard to lock onto and appreciate.",1501022733,1530150103,False,0,0,0.497778266668319702,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It clearly pulls deeply from GBA era sidescrollers, but fails to understand why those games were excellent. The game features good art and overall excellent music, but is plagued by an inconsistant, often nonsensical script and tone, extremely poor level design, and a sizeable pile of half baked mechanics. It has the seed of something interesting, but none of it adds up in to a particularly strong finish.

The game's mechanics have a lot of promise, but the stealth is legitimately bad and rarely engineered to create any interesting situations. Enemies are extremely dumb, and often kill each other with friendly fire. The player gets very poor feedback on most things, outside of ""enemies alerted"". Beyond that, the free roaming world is slow and often extrmely confusing, with no maps or guides. The player is often asked to visit locations via landmarks they haven't seen, with no reminder text about where they are going. Most missions are, in the opposite, extremely linear with no decision making -- generally rewarding a brute-force ""kill everything"" playstyle.

The storytelling has a variety of problems, too -- specifically in that the game starts in media res to create mystery, but never really gives you a motivation for any aspect of the story, and it's so interested in being mysterious that every conversation is either a direct order or a long, confounding speech, until you finally encounter a boss who vomits exposition on you in a way that not only seems extremely out of place but is also extremely tedious. The plot revolves around a shadowy puppet master, but their plans are so inane that its laughable. Both endings to the game utilize a sudden reveal of major plot details in order to create surprise, but ultimately just undercut the rest of the storytelling.

The other plot details raise significant concerns. The game revolves are a feminist dystopia, but doesn't seem interested in exploring that idea outside of a cartoonish visage (contrasted by the dark apathy and angst of the protagonist);  the main character is a trans woman who is oppressed by this society, but we're never really shown this outside of a single optional side mission. Its filled with all sorts of negative feminist stereotypes as well, with little justification. After playing through the whole game, it seemed that the designer was trying to create an interesting setting and explore some outside politics, but simply had an extremely poor grasp on what they were depicting.

Анимация хорошая, никаких обрывов, телепортаций и корявых хитбоксов.
Геймплей - интересный и необычный, 2d-стелс, можно ползать по вентиляциям, выпрыгивать и захватывать противников со спины, отвлекать звуковыми гранатами.

one of the merits I will express is its narative, when I first played it I was ignoring the narrative because I found it boring and wanted gameplay and I didnt really care for the plot. now that I have matured and found a love for more narrative focused games. the story here is fairly good, it its not the single greatest work of writing but its certainly relevant and does a good job at pushing its points onto the table. one of the things i wasnt paying attention too all those years ago when I brought this game was the fact that the main character was trans... in the time since that original review and now I realised that I myself am nonbinary, and a game tackling that topic and more specifically the topic of terfs really hits home. the way they are uses is as a fachist boogie man, not allowing anyone into their city if they dont use tampons. this use of terfs shows a lot of understanding of they use gender essentialism to create an ingroup and outgroup in order to justify abuse and violence against the trans community. one main criticism that can be noted is with the situation of the world however IE that the concept of the world only containing women leads to the problem of trans men nonbinary folk and other gender orientations. it validates that they are not women but invalidates their existence within the world. it also leads to a question of reproduction that as far as i am aware never really gets answered.

the gameplay is far better than i gave it credit for. its not as fast or fluid as other stealth plaformers like mark of the ninja it is certainly not the worst. its control is most similar to megaman. the controls are a mixed bag. some of them feel great but the jump feels a little floaty, and the movement feels a little stiff but the gameplay is not bad and in practice the stealth gameplay, metroidvania elements and platforming isnt a bad mix.",1477141231,1657250852,True,0,0,0.395848125219345093,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Kind of open world Kama great level design and an ending that wraps up in a satisfying fashion.

My main critique is that the writing gets a little weak in the middle, and one of the endings is a bit too cliche for my tastes.

Overall, I did not feel like the game was cheating me or improperly balanced. I have fun working my way through levels, and even when things got really difficult I saw that it was myself not seeing the solution rather than the game asking the impossible of me.

The gender thing might be an issue for some people, if you are not comfortable with conversations about gender identity and sexual identity then you should stay away. If you're secure with your position on the Kinsey scale, you will find a very good game with a backstory delightfully different than other gaming dystopias.

There was one problem with the controllers and the game engine when I try to log jump with the steam controller on an older PC or was outside with the rain.

First, i'll start with the mostly good which is the fluff:
*The game has a really good and original setting which is a cyberpunk radfem dystopia, probably the only game where you will see something like that, everythign is pretty and the soundtrack is beautiful.
*Ceyda is... a character I didn´t really like at first, she's a painfully bitter, sarcastic mercenary with an incredibly short fuse and prone to make rash decisions based on spite, but then maybe it's just me but the character grows on you, I mean it kinda makes sense to be perpetually pissed in that situation, the point is that it's a character that could come across as annoying to some but it's properly constructed, plus (I have to say it) her status as a transexual doesn't absorbs her personality as some people might expect.
*The most polarizing part, which to not to go too deep into spoiler zone, the supernatural elements which get more prominent the more you get closer to the ending IMO are really good, I loved how psychedelic some parts got with it, the problem with it is that it really feels rushed and the big twist feels like it came from nowhere (even Ceyda is with the audience reacting with sheer confusion in this part), though this probably is unfair to expect from a small budget indie game, you are left with the feeling that the world of the game needed to be fleshed out more before taking out such big guns to make it compelling.

Now onto the more bumpy road, the gameplay:
*It's not terrible but it's not pretty good either, it's your typical side scrolling run n' gun but really clunky, the worst part is that you cannot aim upwards which makes airborne enemies a big pain in the arse.
*The world of the game is nice and outside of planina district, easy to navigate, but there really isn't anything else to do other than carry on with your mission, more interactivity with it would have done the game big favors.
*The boss fights are okay but you mostly feel like you are out of control all the time an waiting for the enemy to hurt itself.
*The worst part undoubtly is the stealth elements of the game, they are so badly implemented I think the game would be better off without them, they play like a grating platforming metal gear, it's mostly just sneaking into boxes and shooting enemies in the back when they turn around, it's just terrible.

All said and done I can't really recommend the game other than to people who are really interested in seeing the unique setting and a compelling transexual protagonist in action, I have heard that Ektomach is working on a new game, I hope that turns out better than this because Subbania was really great, best of wishes to him.",1475334859,1475334920,False,7,0,0.409730434417724609,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was sold on that description alone. And Aerannis almost works! It's a painful non recommendation.

I can't comment on the story because I didn't see it through the end. It's pretty confusing so far. I think it's trying to approach topics like prejudice and sexual identity. 

Right! let's talk about the meat of the game. Action platforming is good. You got your shooting and jumping, a small variety of enemies to jump and shoot around. It's not too deep though, it gets boring after a while. It also introduces a human shield mechanic but it doesn't fit the action segments very well most of the times, as it's better to just shoot them directly. Except when you have to use human shields to open doors! that is pretty neat. It's like finding keys, but the keys shoot back.

I was looking forward the stealth mechanic but it's the most disappointing part of the game. It's hard to describe why it doesn't work because stealth is extremely delicate, and tiny details can make or break the experience. Considering they went for missions where you get insta-killed when they spot you, they should have been extra careful with it. The lack of visual cues to read the guard's patterns is one problem; They just turn around instantly. There is also no timer for the guard to go from unalerted to 'you're dead'. A chance for you to get back to your hiding spot and correct tiny mistakes, while the guard goes into suspicious mode or something. There's also the case of climbing stairs (door like stairs that teleport you to neighbor floors) that lead you straight to a guard. Guards also bug out sometimes, forcing you to get caught just to respawn.

Again, tiny details. That make the whole stealth experience is unfulfilling. It's made even worse when you get the run upgrade or, as I like to call it, the double-tap curse. When trying to move slow and carefully it's normal to tap the directional. With the double-tap curse you'll often find yourself doing quick runs in place. Not enough to actually run but enough to alert guards around you.

Then there are the bugs. I was actually willing to finish the game with the criticism above in mind already, but the game has the awful habit of bugging out during dialogues and there's no way around closing the game by force. All 3 times that happened to me made me lose a huge chunk of gameplay, as they are usually at the end of missions, before you had a chance to save. So, if you're already cursing at the game's imperfections, having to replay an entire mission because the game bugged out is a deal breaker for me.",1467589502,1467589502,False,8,0,0.588054835796356201,0,True,False,False,False,,,

게임은 정해진 스토리를 따라가며 의뢰를 받고 암살-파괴-보스전을 반복하는 일반적인 메트로배니아식 게임입니다. 적당한 볼륨이 있고 (플레이타임 3~5시간) 딱히 흠 잡을 곳 없이 잘 만든 게임입니다. 그러나 플레이하면 할수록 제작자의 의도가 새삼 궁금합니다. 성적차별을 은근히 유저에게 대입하는데 텍스트를 안 읽고 생각없이 즐기면 별 문제 없지만 스토리가 궁금해 텍스트를 읽고 독특한 아트워크들을 보고 몹 디자인을 보고 있으면 제작자가 무슨 생각으로 이런식 전개를 했는지 궁금할 수 밖에 없습니다. 포럼에 그런 류 글도 없고 기사같은 것도 없으니 알 길은 없으나 굳이 이런 걸 대입해야했나.. 하는 생각이 듭니다. 미래세계가 무대니 그러려니 하지만 좀 치우친 것 같네요.

그 외에는 캐릭터가 총을 8방향도 4방향도 아닌 좌우 2방향밖에 못 쏘는게 제법 답답합니다. 적어도 하늘에 날라다니는 몹이 있으면 적어도 4방향 쏘기라도 지원했으면 합니다. 점프샷으로만 처리하기에는 손가락이 힘들어해요.

사이버펑크 사운드와, 기본에 충실해 재밌는 게임플레이, 독특한 아트워크등 매력적인 게임이란 것은 확실합니다. 메트로배니아 스타일의 게임을 싫어하시는 분이나 성적차별쪽으로 극단적인 생각을 가지신 분이 아니시면 어느 분이든 하루동안 무난히 즐겨볼 수 있는 게임입니다.",1467105681,1467105976,True,22,1,0.741987287998199463,2,False,False,False,False,,,

The main bulk of the gameplay is platformer shoot-em-ups, with stealth options available if you prefer. You get various missions, to do with either collecting things, or assasinating targets, with a few 'boss battles' to even things out. All in all I feel as if the gameplay was a little unbalanced, with some areas much more difficult/easier that others, but it was mostly good.

You have various weapons, which help aid your style of gameplay [be it stealth or just running in head-on], and as enemies die you get tokens and health boosts. I feel as if the tokens are sort of unnecessary as all they are used for is buying more health. In my mind it would have made more sense to just have health boosts drop.

The story to the game follows you in a plot to overthrow the government who, as it turns out, are a bunch of illuminati gods. Or purple monsters. Or something. Its a bit wierd. That said, ignoring the wierdness, it's not too bad. You meet various people who've been affected by the state of life, and you end up with some choices as to how you want to play it out to the end. Worth mentioning is its very, uh, 'feminist' for lack of a better phrase. But it doesn't strain too heavily on this as to get in the way of the main story.

The music and art are very good in this game. The music has a very distopian feel to it, and matches up well with the fast paced action. There's also quite a variety of it, as opposed to just a few looping tracks. At times, if you're going for stealth, the music doesn't quite match tot his, but I didn't feel that was a major issue. The pixel art is very nice, with a wide range of environments carefully crafted. [My favourite is probably the art in the garden area].

The main menu interface is a bit hard to navigate, but it does keep track of your missing, and your inventory. I feel it would be much improved with a map though, as sometimes it can be hard to remember just where things are.

WARNING: At one point in the game there is a dream sequence with a great deal of flashing lights. It's brief enough that it probably won't be a problem for most photosensitives, but an actual epileptic might have serious trouble.

Aerannis is a complicated game, at least partially because its plot is kinda hard to understand if you're not marinated in Queer Discourse and postmodern feminism, but I'm not even going to touch that part with a ten-foot pole. Everyone's going to have their own opinions.

Gameplaywise, Aerannis alternates between puzzle-like stealth sections and high-action gunfighting. The style is generally IGAvania/Metroidvania, with Ceyda traversing the city of Plovdiv on a series of assassination missions. She has a standard blaster gun and a variety of different bombs available: a noisemaker for distracting guards, a proximity mine that sticks to walls, and an exploding boomerang. The default controls are awful but reconfigurable.

Unlike most Metroidvanias, Aerannis is almost entirely linear. You're given missions in a specific sequence, so there's very little exploration; you can't even enter an area until a mission sends you there. Most upgrades are guaranteed, though a few (like rapid fire) are skippable -- if you want to walk right through the room containing them and ignore them.

On Casual mode the game can be completed, beginning to end, in about 4-5 hours, and that's on the first time through. Higher difficulty levels add more numeric challenge, as you take more damage and enemies take more hits, but that's all. It doesn't really make that much of a difference outside of boss fights, to be honest, as the most difficult sections of the game by far are the stealth missions -- get seen by one camera or one enemy and it's game over.

Aerannis does have two endings, but the sole determining factor is a decision made at almost the very end of the game. It doesn't really add any replayability as you can just get both endings in quick succession. Both endings make perfect sense, but they also both leave a lot of unanswered questions.

Personally, I really enjoyed Aerannis, and I definitely got enough value for my $5. If you're in the market for a good sci-fi game (and proper sci-fi, not ""fantasy in space"") and don't panic at the thought of feminism, go for it.",1456335505,1456370730,True,3,1,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Aerannis is almost great 2D metroidvania action adventure game with stealth. The problems is the repetition in the gameplay section. I'll cover this later. If you are into such type of games get it right now, it's not expensive and it does one thing great – storytelling

Here options are almost non existent. No audio or video settings at all. Just two options for fullscreen, three for windowed, difficulty and limiting or not the fps. It's a 2D game after all, but even in fullscreen you have black borders and it would be nice to have some audio sliders. You can play with keyboard and rebind the controls, but it's not that intuitive, so controller is what I played the whole game. The problem is I had to use third party softwere, because the game didn't recognize my controller. Once I configure the buttons, controlling the character was great.

The story take places in Bulgarian City of Plovdiv in a dystopian future ruled by women, where men don't exist, because they are forced to undergo hormone replacement therapy. Society is treating them really bad as second hand humans, insulted by almost everyone, only useful for reproduction. They are called “Snowflakes”. You play as Ceyda Farhi, assassin who kills people for a living. She is transformed too. Ceyda uncovers dark conspiracy threaten the humanity. Pretty standard story in the beginning, but it's getting way better later and even tackles sensitive topics  – transgender people, femisim, hate and few other things. But this is not the core of the story. It's the supernatural conspiracy, but those topics are well implemented. At first I was thinking there will be nothing to remember, but later “Wow!!! This is really good”. The pacing is really great and when you see it's not just a “save the world situations”, it will involved you and the “fault” for this is the great writing. Ceyda is really fleshed out and great character. I wanted to know what will happen next. But keep in mind those sensitive topics if you want to play the game. There is more beside them, but you have to see it for yourslef.  The reason why I enjoy the story so much is, because I didn't read the description. I'm saying that, because part of it is spoiled there. It's a good thing to go blinded in a game. Also there are two endings and I think both are great, but one is more fitting for the story that is told here.

There isn't much to talk about the graphics. They are great. Beautiful, colorful, detailed and vibrant pixel art will please your eyes. Every part of the world – building, trees, even signboards, are great to look at and diverse. Ceyda's and enemies movement and details are great. When she fall from really high, you see her make this scared cartoon face and it's awesome.

The gameplay is pretty standard. You can go left and right, later even up. You start the game with a gun, who fire slowly at first and also have a charge shot, and a noise maker to distract enemies. Later you will gain the ability to hang on ledges, run fast and wall jump. By acquiring those abilities, you will acces parts of the world, previously unreachable. But you go to those places, when the story requires it.

Except noise maker you will get two more gadgets – a sticky bomb and a boomerang. They are usefull not only for killing enemies, but also to remove obstacles on your path.

You can try to can run and gun, but stealth is well implemented here and it's useful. In some levels it's required to not get caught. If the enemy spot you, it's instant failure, but you restart at the nearest checkpoint. The mechanics are simple – you crouch and walk slowly behind an enemy, grab him and kill him. I already mention the noise maker, but you can also use vents to get around them or hide inside doors or cardboard boxes. Even if the objective doesn't include full stealth, it's better, but not necessery, to sneak on enemies, especially on those with heavy armor.

Enemies are diverse enough. In the beginning you will face regular with guns, later with swords, power armor, tough one with a shield, goo looking creatures and even bees. Beside them there few type of robots. The biggest treath is the enemy with the shield. If he sees you, he fires a plasma ball that can pass through solid surfaces and it follows you. So for them the best tactic, if it's available, is to grab him from behind.

Boss battles are great. The all have completely different tactics to beat them. This is surprised me a lot. And there isn't a single repeating boss. Some are kinda annoying and it took awhile to beat them, but overall they are a blast to fight.

Controls are great. If you fall or get hit, it's entirly your fault. You can even control hight of the jump and move Ceyda while in air. This allow me to jump out of vent and while in mid air go through a door and grab an enemy from behind. 

Health is restored by buying a health item from the shop. You have instant access to it. Sadly this is the only thing you can buy, nothing else. The other ways you can restore it is when enemy drops a health, when you kill him and when saving the game. They also drop crystals, nano machines, which are the curency here. And when you finish a job, you also get money.

Level design is good. All outside areas you visit are great, especially when you get to the final level, but inside buidings are just okay. They are just corridors without any branching paths. Most of them are design, if you want, to use stealth. There are boxes, vents, lamps and so on. Places you visit have different theme like office, garden, high tech facility, cave and so on. There is a lot diversity in the level design. You can enter in buildings, but only when the story dictates it. 

Sound is great. There isn't voice acting and that's perfectly fine. Effects are nice and they are similar to SNES era games. The highlight is the soundtrack. It's really great. All tracks have this 70-80's dystopian futuristic sound, but modernized and it's not chiptunes. They are vibrant like the world you are in. So well fitting, fast paced, heart pumping. When you fight a boss the music changes dramaticly to have tension and those track are also great.

Most of the issues I have are minor things. But there are two big problems I have. The first is the lack of exploration. When I see game branded as metroidvania I expect exploration to find secrets and other great stuff. Yes, there one or two upgrades hidden, but it's not enough. The other is repetitions. Maybe somewhere in the middle of the game, I start to see that some people might find the gameplay kinda repetetive. As for me, I didn't find that much. It doesn't offer something new, but what it does, it does it great. Honestly, the story is what kept me going. There few small issues. You have only one weapon and I'm not counting the gadgets. I know it's not run 'n' gun game, but still it would be nice to have at least 1 or 2 weapons more. Grabbing on ledges is counterintuitive. It's not automaticly done. You have to press and hold the direction the character is facing and after it catches on some surface, you can release the button. This apply to wall jumping too. It took me awhile, but eventually got use to it. There other little issues, but those are my main complains.

I enjoy my time with Aerannis. There little jokes in the game that put a smile on my face, but unless you are from Bulgaria you won't get them. There probably better metroidvania games, but this one is definitely worth your time. The world is great, graphics are great, the soundtrack is really good, but the best part here is the story. It's well written and it have two endings, which in my opinion stand on their own and you don't have to play the whole game to see both of them. Of course, it's not a perfect game.But nothing stop from enjoying the game. It's worth buying even just for the story.

The action is a little clunky, but serviceable at least. It's kinda like a poor mans version of Mega Man.

What isn't workable though, is the stealth. It's tedious, unpredictable, and annoying. Imagine playing Thief TDP with no saves, that's what this is like, only worse. Actually, no, it's more like playing Mega Man where every enemy one shots you just by looking at you. Checkpoints are rare, so you have to do entire stages perfectly. Enemies move in unpredictable ways, and sometimes turn on you when you go to stealth kill them and you fail instantly. Cameras have basically nonexistant hitboxes so are incredibly hard to disable. Sound seems to play a role in enemies actions, but the gameplay never made it clear what makes noise and what doesn't. Sometimes walking alerted enemies, sometimes it didn't.

Oh yeah, and no map. You do have a radar, but it's made kinda useless with the pixel graphics and all. Don't know how you could make a metroidvania type game with no map system and think it was a good idea.

The world seems ok, and the graphics are decent. Music is fairly enjoyable but nothing notable. 

For some reason there are only women, I couldn't get far enough to learn why. Some sort of feminist society deal.

I can't really recommend this game. Playing it is just kinda boring, and the stealth missions are far too hard. I couldn't even pass the third one so I gave up trying.

Straight up, the highlight of this game is the soundtrack. I need to find out if it's for sale somewhere since it's not on-Steam purchasable, because [b]dang[/b] is it the standout star of Aerannis. The game itself isn't bad, but it falls into that small-team issue where there's some jank, in this case related to the controls not being quite as precise as you'd like, doubly so in stealth sections. If, like me, you just don't want to put up with that: Cheat Engine + exact value search for a Double variable, your max health is 15. Lock it and stealth sections turn into ""sections"", disabling the auto-fail.

I enjoyed the game and while I occasionally winced at a line, nothing stood out as slagging on one of the myriad real-world perspectives it covers. The ending was a little less so, but frankly, it's not the first video game to abruptly turn metaphor into something that falls flat, and it's not game-ruining, just kind of ""...really?"". I enjoyed it and will forevermore consider it the weirdest possible Half-Life 3 we could ever get, given that this basically takes place in City 17 + some extra factors.

Yeah, it's weird. 

It's clearly very influenced by anime... whether or not that's a positive, it really depends on the player.
The game is full of symbolism, most of it very obvious, but it's certainly different from most platformers out there!
Thematically, it's mostly about control, and it also inverts the gender issues that have been popping up in the gaming scene... I don't see it doing anything special in that regard, but hey, it's novel!

The game reminds me a lot of Read Only Memories (it even features an advertisement for the game!), mostly in the UI design, not only the visual aspect, but also all the sound effects. That is yet another recent dystopian sci-fi game that tries to incorporate gender and discrimination issues into the mix. I don't really mind them, but it's a bit too ""in your face"", in my opinion. In both games, actually. Feels forced to me, but hey, maybe you'll feel different about it! I won't get into that any more than I already have.

As a stealth game, it's certainly not very good. It's decent, at best. It's not really frustrating, so you can get through the game without being constantly reminded of its problems, which is good. I'll get into that later.

What is left, however, is its presentation. It's really cool!
The visuals, you can judge from the screenshots. There are some details I really like: the windows and the trees, for example. The monster/robot designs are also cool, in places.
If I had to mention something that I dislike is how it's very... busy/confusing, at times. I think it's the perspective on some buildings and background/foreground elements that were very disorientating in the larger areas. The game could definitely do a better job in differentiating between background/foreground elements, as well as what the character can or can not grab.

Not much more to say about it. It has a distinct style, despite the somewhat overplayed 8/16 bit graphic style. I liked this one, for sure!

Now, the music was also great! Nothing mind-blowing, or noteworthy in its use, but it fit the overal aesthetic very nicely! Once again, reminded me of R.O.M., and probably one of this game's highlights, for me!



As for the gameplay, it's a simple 2D shooter. You can walk, jump and shoot forwards, that's about it. It's simple, but it does manage to build a solid experience around it.
You can grab enemies, if you're close to them (and remain undetected), and you can kill them with a single shot. You'll also have 3 throwable weapons: 1 for distraction, a sticky bomb, and a boom-erang (yeah, it's a bomb too).

The metroid-vania elements are very, very light, as I mentioned. You'll get the ability to wall jump, and 2 of the 3 throwable weapons are also ""unlocked"" throughout the story. There are a couple of upgrades spread around the levels, but they're all very mild (slightly faster fire-rater, slightly more hp, etc.). It's mission based, to the whole point of exploration and backtracking present in something like Metroid isn't there at all. The upgrades are also almost negligible in comparison.
So yeah, nothing that enhanced the experience by a lot, but hey...


Finally, the stealth. This is where I have most issues with. Why? Because Mark of the Ninja exists. I'm not saying to go play Mark of the Ninja instead (although you probably should, if you're simply looking for a stealth game), it's more about how much MotN can teach about 2D Stealth. There are tons of little details that Aerannis is lacking that become rather obvious after playing through MotN.

I've already mentioned the ledge highlighting. There's also (and this was a very important one, to me) how much you can see of the room. The camera simply follows your character, and there's no way of looking up/down/left/right. It's very annoying! Especially when the camera something doesn't lock in the same place, despite the character begin in the same spot. So you'll have to walk a bit more to the right to see what is going on, etc. It's not very good, especially when you do [b]need[/b] to see where enemies are going.

The game also doesn't respond to anything outside your view... like old NES games, where bullets disappear as soon as they leave the screen. This isn't as extreme, but enemies don't seem to take damage for bombs thrown outside your vision, for example. Neither from bullets. It seems like a pointless limitation, especially in a stealth game that relies on planning and sometimes setting traps.

There are other minor faults, like the dumb AI that can act very comically at times. I often just jumped up and latched onto a light and saw them walk around for a bit, as if I had disappeared. At those times, you can also thrown bombs down and kill the enemies outright. 
I did provide a funny moment, when a guard, immediately after running around stopped a wondered ""What is lunch today?"". 

The AI sometimes gets stuck in a position without ever turning, which can make it impossible for you to pass undetected, although going back to the previous checkpoint easily fixes it. Checkpoints are very common, so you'll never lose much progress.

So yeah, the AI is both exploitable and sometimes get into very annoying positions.

The controls aren't very good, either. They're okay, but anything that requires either reflexes or precision will soon be met with disappointment. Thankfully, there aren't many sections that do require precise controls. Overall, it certainly hinders the game as a whole, combined with the stealth/visibility and AI problems... 
With that said, as a whole, I still enjoyed Aerannis. 

Not the best game I've played, recently, but certainly did a couple of things differently than many platformers today, and looks promising, if the developer keeps improving!

The action/stealth gameplay keeps you wanting to go back in after every trip up – oh, I should have done this, I slipped up there – and things stay fresher than a straight up run and gun (not that there's anything wrong with a good run and gun). This action/stealth gameplay really adds to the character of being a gun for hire, you're not a tank, you need to outsmart the guards as you can't always run them over. And then there's the story which feeds you just enough information at a time to keep you going in for more. A trail of breadcrumbs, you're  not told what the big picture is off the bat, not about the overall goal, not about the enemy, not even about your character.

Just, one critical word of advice: you absolutely NEED a controller of some kind to play this game, trying to play it with a keyboard is hopeless. If you have a Wii remote and you're on a Mac then you can download Wiiji and program the buttons through that (pretty easy user interface except it does not appear in the program bar at the bottom, it pops up next to the clock in the upper right when you open it. It also installs itself in the Utilities folder). There has to be something similar for Windows, but you can get by with just a Wii Remote, no need to the Nunchuk or other accessory.

I got it for myself and a friend b/c I heard it was about a trans woman assassin fighting a TERF government (which, right on, obvs.), so I was in it mainly for the story/world. And those were essentially what I was expecting kind of but they just ended up being really thin. I would've liked the game to have spent more time characterizing and engaging w/ those issues, whereas as it is it seems less like a game made about trans women and more like we're being used as some sort of window-dressing for an unrelated story. Which I am not necessarily opposed to if it means more positive representation in games for people like me, but I'm just not sure how to feel about it. I definitely wasn't able to discern any concrete thematic message about gender or feminism or anything. Our place in the story isn't offensive or anything but it seemed like an afterthought in an overarching plot that could've taken place in any other dystopia. Which makes it an odd choice, then.

And what's confusing also is that there are quite a few elements in this game drawn from/common in trans women's culture (weird eldritch monsters and occult rituals, cyberpunk and cyborgs, [spoiler]Satan as a positive character[/spoiler], a joke about ""tree slimes,"" and lots of bad puns), and it was these elements which were familiar to me that I liked the best and found the most interesting. I searched quite a bit to see if there were any trans women involved in the making of this game, and I couldn't seem to find a definite answer. I don't understand though why someone would want to make a game about this subject if they're not a member of that group, though. I read through a few developer interviews, but none of the answers there really made sense to me.

The gameplay is more consistently good, w/ the qualifier that it's really fucking hard. Incorporating some sort of difficulty settings would really make this game a lot more accessible to people like me who are bad at both stealth games and metroidvanias. As it is, it was impossible for me to get through without slowly killing everyone, and I had to retry several of the bosses many times before I could beat them. Maybe that is a positive quality for some people? But I would at least like to be able to choose how much I am going to be challenged by a game.

On top of that, the most confusing aspect of the gameplay was that there was no map and while Elsa would give you directions to each location, they were usually vague and they wouldn't go into the mission log on the pause screen, so you would just have to try to remember them and then guess what they meant. I spent a lot of time wandering around looking for stuff in this game. I actually really enjoyed the relatively open-world-iness of it (the park especially was nice), but if you're going to make the player wander around like that then you need to give them some help figuring out where they're going.

Otherwise, it was pretty well put together. The music is pretty good and the jumping and dashing mechanics are fantastic.

Ceyda is a tough hired gun who prefers to shoot first rather than second guess her orders. The issue of men, and the lack thereof, is questioned by various NPCs and issues of reproduction, femininity, women’s place in society and more are all touched on throughout the game. 

The mystery of sinister government plots and the supernatural beings that act as gods is also played up throughout. The scene following most missions shows a prominent political figure addressing a faceless crowd to spin the missions’ happenings, often questionable acts that suggest something larger than Ceyda is willing to pursue is at foot, into digestible bits of just events. The aforementioned creatures haunt Ceyda in dreams and in reality, with their main characteristic being a large single eye and their often fluctuating forms. The omnipresent gaze and ability to appear anywhere and through any form most easily places them as manifestations of the gaze. It’s a fascinating setting, but at times the weightiness of its content gets heavy handed; there is a certain mission where Ceyda is tasked with controlling the leak of dangerous chemical called “testosterone,” which threatens to turn the populace into violent maniacs. Not every bit of text in the game is meant to be lofty though, and there are some clever jabs and nice bits of humor. 

The colors, level, and enemy design seem to call back to the older Megaman X games. Even the mission start and end notifications feel like Megaman X style font and transitions. The gelatinous eye monsters in this game also recall a bit of the older Megaman’s Yellow Devil, though the monsters here are much more articulate and insidious. Despite the artistic inspiration, Aerannis very much manages to be striking on its own and the soundtrack does an excellent job of keeping the mood in place. This puts the games form near on par with the content present, but the mechanics of the game could have used some more polishing.

The controls feel unresponsive and awkward on both controller or keyboard and this affects all of the games mechanics. Platforming is a large part of Aerannis, and it delivers a less than stellar performance. Wall jumping slings you out just far enough to not be able to alternate most parallel walls, while at the same time demanding the player to return quickly to the same wall in order to climb vertically: it looks a bit like your character is a confused rabbit trying to stay in the same place but somehow managing to offset itself ever so slightly. The characters regular walk speed is set just above leisurely, and the sprint mechanic arrives late and with a very short use time. Ledge grabbing in the game is untraditional in that the ledge of most platforms isn’t counted as either end, but the center. This is of course more a visual annoyance than an actual flaw once you get the hang of it.

Given the wealth of great 2D games that have used stealth elements recently, Aerannis really seems to have taken a step back. Movement feels slow and controls feel unintuitive: with a button press you can hold up someone to instantly kill, open a door, or use them as shield. Generally the doors enemies can open do not offer much of a shortcut, and they don’t make great shields so you will generally be instantly killing them. The problem is that there were a number of times where Ceyda seems to have a change of heart and let the hostage go, and thus endure a few shots and an alert. The level design overall makes stealth seem disjointed and almost unwelcome. So where other stealth games make a sort of puzzle wherein you use gadgets and skill to figure out the many paths to complete an objective silently, Aerannis is rather stingy with the gadgets (a noisemaker, a boomerang, and a mine), and the linear platform heavy areas make it easier to just ignore large areas, while at the same time not giving you a stealth satisfaction. Similar games with stealth elements often rely on you being able to actually see your enemy: The Metal Gear series started top down to allow you to see enemies, modern incarnations are third person with first person options or gadgets, Mark of the Ninja and Hotline Miami both were zoomed out accordingly and allowed the player to see just a bit further than an enemies field of view for most areas. Aerannis instead has a colored globe that will shrink to red when an enemy is approaching, but beyond that, you are left to guess if taking a step through the door or exiting a hallway is going to earn you a blast in the face or a few quick kill. 

The combat, much like the stealth, feels limited. Ceyda’s gun mimics Megaman’s buster gun in that it offers small quick pellets or a larger blast when charged. There was one upgrade that slightly increased rate of fire, but other than that you are stuck with a weapon that encourages you to not engage the enemy directly. The boss fights in Aerannis do attempt to change around the games mechanics: a reflex heavy running sequence, a climbing segment that takes precision mine placement, and then some regular scenarios where you follow a boss’s pattern.

The general rule of thumb for games that want to avoid being linear is that logistics should be quick and easy or traveling should be interesting and it ought to be made clear where important things are. While the first hub area has a few points of interest, a few being less than a handful, every area after that feels like a chore to traverse with no payoff:  no objects to examine, no upgrades, minimal aesthetic variance, and general barren concrete emptiness. On top of this, navigation leaves much to be desired once you leave the first hub area, because some bits of text might tell you a general area or directions, but there are a lot of vertical avenues and buildings of interest to come in clumps. These hub areas only serve to extend the game, which throws off the pacing, as well as highlight the clunky platforming and frame issues, which is overall not fun

Though the mechanics are not the absolute highlight of the game, they are functional for the most part. Aside from the stutters and clunky controls, Aerannis plays fine and is not broken. 
Aerannis is less Mark of the Ninja, and more Mega(wo)man with a focus on narrative and light stealth elements. Some have identified Aerannis as a metroidvania, but given the lack of techniques or gadgets that would allow one to explore new paths in old areas, relatively small world area, and minimal recursive structure, little encouragement to explore, and far from easy travel or navigation, I would not shelve this next to Symphony of the Night. Aerannis stumbles a bit in its approach, but the game is certainly interesting enough to overlook its minor flaws.",1450331802,1450331802,True,12,1,0.608653604984283447,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Ceyda is a trans hit-woman living in a world without men, strange visions of abnormal shape shifting creatures and the chance to change the course of human history. This story starts off simple with you just moving from target to target but about halfway through the game things change up. The writing in this game is very nice and makes some wonderful points. I found myself taking screenshots of certain lines just to show them off to my friends on more than one occasion.

I love the world that Aerannis creates. I found so much to love in this from the wonderful green trees clashing with the dark and moody purple cityscape behind it in the park to the not so welcoming streets of the TERF turf.

This game includes a few things from current trans politics which I enjoyed but some players might not understand. I can see some gamers confusing the TERFs are bad message with a more general feminists are bad one. I think this is a game made for the queer gaming community, or heck maybe is was made just for me because I know I loved it to bits!

With tasks ranging from basic assassinations, destroying documents, comfirming/retrieving information as well as tracking down someone kidnapped or freeing a prisoner.

You start out with most of your arsenal and stealth skills, including a chargable gun that can be fired as you jump or move around at three different heights (walking/crouching/sliding) and a pop bomb used to lure patrols away. You can simply shoot most of the critters, but humanoid enemies are often too tough to shoot your way through and stealth missions will actually require you to not get spotted by them or cameras. To take out humanoids quickly you will have to avoid or abuse making sounds to alert them and crawl through vents here and there. If they are not aware of your presence yet you can grab them from behind for an instant kill or push them around as a hostage to open doors and grant you cover.
As the game progresses your skill set will expand, adding wall jumps, ledge hanging, a sprint and a few different bomb types. The whole arsenal is a lot of fun to use. Only the bomb switching mechanic sticks out a little sore, as it has you popping out a wheel of the bombs around you with a button press, select the active bomb type by moving left or right and closing the wheel again with the same button.

Besides health refills enemies will also drop nano machines, which amount to your currency (nm). The only thing you can do with it though is purchase a single defense boost at a certain location in game and otherwise purchase health refills (half or full) directly from the pause menu. Considering the whole game can be played through entirely without buying such a refill it is probably a nice option for anyone having trouble getting past some areas. It does however feel weird if you abuse it to get through the hard mode (there are three difficulty settings which alter the damage from/to enemies and their vision range).

The world mostly consists of several very different city districts and a park, which in turn contain the level entrances (mostly buildings). You cannot enter any of these buildings (or new areas) prior to being directed to them through a mission and the city structure becomes irrelevant about 1/3rd into the game as several save points gain the option of fast travel between them. This however is a welcome feature as the game contains no back tracking and there would be no point in running through the same areas again and again. The game is very linear as all missions seem to happen in a very strict sequence and only the final mission branches out into two different endings.

Besides great platforming, shooting and stealth action the levels throw a huge diversity of music and boss battles at you. Contrary to common convention boss battles don't simply happen at the end of each level, but instead sometimes at the very beginning, upon a mission to revisit a level later on (save point teleport sparing you a rerun though) or even several times in a row. All of which is very refreshing for this kind of game. Not to mention boss battle types range from the traditional damage dealing over survival/escape to stealth.

The story and setting heavily revolves around LGBTQA issues without rubbing it in your face. So even if you have no idea what that means or generally try to steer clear of that topic the writing is so well done that you should be able to enjoy it in any case.

There are some technical issues with the game, most annoyingly text boxes prompting you to hit a key to advance advancing on their own after some time while some other text boxes with a count down cannot be skipped before it reaches 0.

I've seen this touted as a Metroidvania and a stealth-action game, when really it's neither of the two.

While your character does upgrade, the upgrade path thus far is entirely linear and the currency system in the game is rudimentary at best: the only items you can buy are health restores, and you can buy them anywhere, anytime. 

The game feels like it has the bones of a much better game, they're just configured wrong. As a Megaman style run and jump shooter it could work, but the poor and unforgiving stealth system make it feel weak and thin.

--
I was browsing Facebook when I saw a friend put up a picture of the entrance to TERF turf, and somehow the game was purchased on my steam library twenty seconds later. It's magic, I tell you! Aerannis is a strange amalgam of extremely familiar elements. It reminds me of nothing so much as Hotline Miami (the frequent checkpoints in levels cause that comparison), and yet there are a lot of metroidvania elements as well.
The controls feel floaty, which can be frustrating. I had a few deaths to them - not too many, but a few. The frequent checkpoints help to mostly mitigate this.
The plot is very science-fictiony and ... underexplained [the other thing that harks back to Hotline: Miami for me]. I felt like there could have been a lot more to the story and world, and a lot more to the main character, who is very ... well, she's what you'd expect from a shooter protagonist outside of her gender. In this story, you're basically just doing the ""talk to contact, go through world to do mission, come back to contact, do other mission"" loop, and it's very ... apparent that this is happening. Even with the fun touches [e.g.: the first mission is ""Figure out why people buy day 1 DLC""], it all seems oddly rote for a story set in a world where there are no men in apocalyptic surroundings. You're forced through a linear path, and that path feels ... incomplete, or at least it did to me.
There are multiple endings, but you can see both of them almost immediately at the end, which I thought was a nice touch. The endings themselves ... are a bit of a lucid dream, as the rest of the plot is. To be honest, I don't think the art style does the game any favors in this area (and goodness, the elevator sprites are almost seizure-inducing), but there could have been more done, just in general, to flesh out the world.

In the end, I would rate this a maybe, but there's just a yes or no option. Upon finishing the game (it took ~6, 7 hours?) ... I didn't love it. It feels serviceable. If you love the subject matter, you won't regret buying it (I don't regret buying it). But I ended the game wanting more from the game than what I got - a character that isn't content to just follow what their handler says forever, a story that's more fleshed-out ... I wasn't really able to connect with the main character in the story. The small throwaway bits are consistent and then the larger bits didn't ... feel that way, to the setting and the story, to me. I felt along for the ride, like my actions weren't doing anything in the story - like I was watching an oddly-paced 8-bit movie about the Illum(inati) and Gods, Devil May Cry-style. And the action isn't good enough to compensate.",1442778806,1442778806,False,52,0,0.681548535823822021,3,True,False,False,False,,,

There's definitely been a number of times where I've failed a section multiple times because I keep pressing the wrong button since I go for the key that feels more intuitive. [strike]Customizable controls would be a huge boon.[/strike]* And sometimes the music choice and screen you're playing in don't match up well and feel weird to play.

I bought this for $8.50, though I'd gladly pay $15 for it. Even with its faults, the game has me hooked, and I definitely can't wait to see what the developer has in store for the future.

* EDIT: An update was added to allow customizable controls. This helps a lot, though the initial configuration of controls is still enough of an issue to note.",1442454763,1444810610,True,24,1,0.58806377649307251,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The dialogue and commentary are both witty and funny. The problems going on in the world are serious but the characters manage to stay cracking jokes at each other.

The graphics and artstyle are unique and beautiful. The art alone could keep me going just to see what new areas lay ahead. One important thing I think alot of games miss is, everything is consistent looking. Nothing looks out of place or looks like it came from another game.

The gameplay is challenging but fair. So far the game has been adding new mechanics at a steady pace to keep things interesting.

The music and sound effects are very pleasant to listen to. Seriously, dont have your own music playing while playing Aerannis, the OST to the game is great and I sometimes just stand still in an area to hear the area music.

Overall I highly recommend the game, graphics and music are beautiful, gameplay is fun, and story is interesting. What else could you want? plus its only TEN dollars!",1442416147,1442417269,True,13,2,0.542566597461700439,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The control scheme is unintuitive on the keyboard, which is what I played the game using. Glitches are rare, and when they occur they're rarely gamebreaking. Hitboxes for certain actions, like grabbing enemies and ledges, are odd and often difficult to predict.

The story takes place in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv where men have been eliminated, a revolution somehow forcing all men to undergo hormone replacement therapy, and relegating them to second class citizenship. ""Snowflakes"" as they're called are reviled by society, treated as little more than potentially violent pretenders only good for reproduction. You play Ceyda Farhi, a Bulgarian Turk who works as an assassin. She was also a transwoman before the revolution occurred, and due to her status as a transwoman only finds illegal work available to her. The story features intense discussions of feminism, particularly factions within feminism, and the place transwomen have in feminism. The game features two endings, one of which feels out of left field and the other more in line with the story we've been told.

A big issue with Aerannis is that it's short, I completed the game in seven and a half hours, and I'm sure a quicker run is possible.

I highly recommend Aerannis based off its story, gameplay, and the setting behind. I feel like Aerannis is a testament to what indie developers can accomplish without the pressure of executive meddling forcing them to make the next AAA title.

A warning: Aerannis features transphobic language and ideas at times, and anyone sensitive to these topics may want to keep this in mind while playing the game.",1442397909,1442397909,True,136,3,0.812127053737640381,0,False,False,False,False,,,

That's basically all you need to know, but you can read on if you want to.

Control-wise, it's what people call a ""MetroidVania"" game, because apparently only Metroid and Castlevania are allowed to have exploration-heavy side scrolling and shooting.

You alternately sneak, kill, and SneakyKill(tm) your way to the goal while carrying out missions in an oppressive feminist future society. Yes, you read that right.  We need more games like this that actually take risks with the setting instead of having every scifi game basically stealing the universe from Blade Runner.

The social commentary and humor are where the game really shines.  The dialogue is witty, references to other projects and jabs at extremist feminism and the gaming industry are plentiful, and the memes are spicy.

If the game has one shortcoming, it is the palpable lack of wacky waving arm-flailing inflatable tube men.  The devs really should have foreseen this problem and I hope it will be fixed in an upcoming patch or reasonably priced DLC.
