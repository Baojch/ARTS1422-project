Boo Breakers is a simple game. You’re given two wands – one for manipulating objects and one for catching ghosts. You walk into a room – you manipulate objects until ghosts appear and you move them over a ghost trap(think Ghost Busters). When you finish a room, you move to the next room and rinse and repeat. There is some surprises in the rooms such as mayhem(getting swarmed by ghosts) or chests that have keys.

The game reminds me a lot of an NES or arcade style game such as Donkey Kong. It gets repetitive but its all about beating a boss within a time limit. The game, from what I could tell, had a bit of content for a $4.99 title. I finished the first level in around 20 minutes and I actually though it was the WHOLE game(for $4.99) but realized it was just the first level.

A lot of the game is positioning and your worst enemy in the game are books that the ghosts throw at you. It actually can get a bit hectic despite the cute graphics and simple game mechanics when many ghosts are on screen, throwing books your direction. You might think moving is a good option to avoid but it makes it tricky to move the ghosts over the traps.

One of the bigger frustration is whipping the ghosts over traps. It is a strange movement in which you kind of have to pull your arm back behind your head which sometimes doesn’t register well with the Vive(probably room setup problems) or whipping them left or right over a trap.

My biggest thumbs up though is the price. For $4.99 – this is a game. It’s cute but actually seems to have content.",1509343868,1509343868,True,0,0,0.456060975790023804,0,True,False,False,False,,,
