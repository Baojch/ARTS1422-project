The hungarian WW2 perspective provides a refreshingly different setting and atmosphere compared to most current VN's.
Fairly interesting main centered around the protagonist and his fragile mind, with mystery elements and stuff to speculate about.
Low price.
Choices feel meaningfull, but some clearly have more direct impact on the story.

Mixed: 
Music that fits the perpetually bleak mood amongst the characters. .
Matching sprite and background artstyle.
Routes/endings each provide something new to the story, although they share certain segments
The ""true"" route, if you may call it that, could have lasted a bit longer and revealed a bit more.

Cons: 
As it is clearly a small indie project, it naturally lacks in a couple departments.
Being few in number and all piano based, the music pieces ends up getting rather repetitive.
Art generally could use more polish.
A bit more spell-checking would be nice. On occasion it's not entirely clear what message a textline tries to tell the reader. Sometimes gender pronouns are switched (he/she).",1543311141,1543311141,True,4,0,0.593180179595947266,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-That unique sense of Hungarian pessimism
-That unique sense of dejected Eastern European acceptance of all the bad things that happen in life
-Sick cripple references
-Yeah... haha...

Cons:
What on earth is going on?
