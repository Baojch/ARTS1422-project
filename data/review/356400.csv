[i]Thumper[/i] is a game that describes itself as ""rhythm violence"", and it absolutely lives up to that label. From the animations to the boss designs to the gameplay itself, it's violent in every way. It doesn't have a lot of mechanics, but it doesn't need any more, since chaining the existing ones together at the pace the game throws obstacles at you (especially at harder levels) is already very difficult. This game also has a tendency to punish you for doing well: for example, ground-pounding an activated thump panel will pause the gameplay for a beat to play an impact animation, potentially completely throwing you off the rhythm if you don't expect that to happen already. Despite that, I really enjoyed playing the game, and am now trying to get over 5M total score, so don't think beating the game (or even S-ranking it) is the end.

I didn‚Äôt know what on-rails rhythm combat racing looked like before this game, but now I can‚Äôt imagine it any other way. Legitimately challenging at times, especially if you‚Äôre going for S-rank. This is the kind of game where scratching an itch can be the difference between life and death. It will test your vision, hearing, memory, pattern recognition, motorskills, reflexes, hand-eye coordination, timing, patience, and sanity. It had me cramping up in spots I didn‚Äôt know cramps were possible. By the time you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôll have calluses for thumbs, forearms like tree-trunks, and a six-pack on either palm. Or you‚Äôll develop arthritis, could swing either way. The controls are simple enough that you can set it down for years and pick it back up again whenever you want, although it may take some time to get back into the swing of things. I do wish the music was a bit more diverse. Each level is basically a variation of the one song, so it starts to get old after a little while, but the one major complaint I have is that you can‚Äôt replay specific checkpoints. In order to replay your favourite sections, you need to replay the rest of the level it‚Äôs attached to, and arguably worse, the entire level if you missed a single S-rank. I spent four hours on level 9 and ended up missing a tile right at the end. Didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal since most of the levels allow for one or two mistakes per checkpoint, but then the game ended and it gave me an a-rank, so I had to replay the entire level thanks to one single tile. That legitimately pissed me off. Good game, though.",1708177815,1708229359,True,3,1,0.502212405204772949,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Every main level introduces new [b]gameplay[/b] elements and slowly ramps up the [b]difficulty[/b].
A main level is partitioned into sublevels (mainly normal sublevels and some boss sublevels).

There are two main game modes : Play and Play+
[list]
    [*] in Play mode, you can replay the last sublevel if you die or to improve your score (normal mode)
    [*] in Play+ mode, you can‚Äôt replay sublevels (hard mode)

+ Great music - it perfectly fits the description of rhythm violence.

[h3]Cons[/h3]
- I don't know whether it's ok to call this a rhythm game. The gameplay certainly relies on rhythm, but it definitely isn't like your usual rhythm games. Sometimes, you just cannot tell what inputs to do by listening to the sounds or trying to read ahead with visuals. As a result, you need to rely on pattern recognition and memorization. I could put up with this, but someone with an expectation of a ""rhythm game"" might find it unacceptable.
- I feel the pacing could be better. Since the game relies on pattern recognition, why not ease the player into learning them, instead of throwing new patterns in between long levels and forcing a restart?

[h3]More thoughts[/h3]
This game lies somewhere between Geometry Dash and proper rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution. It's not as reliant on memorization as GD, but does have a few sections which you just have to remember to get right. If you don't mind that, you'll have a blast. Even if you do, just get this to experience its really unique combination of visuals, audio and gameplay.

First, the mechanics are not well indicated. There were several things I had to either looks up or try to figure out by trial and error. Only after several hours of play and reading some other comments do I now realize what they were trying to say with the first ""tutorial."" Jump on the squares, but they are optional, only for points. Whereas things like blocks/turns/evades are non-negotiable.

Second, the pace is quite fast. You must queue information as far ahead as possible. But with the track all rotating in the distance and the rather monotone color theme, I think they artificially increased the difficulty. Also, the action sounds play over the heads-up sounds, so the audio is not super helpful to determine what is ahead.

I generally enjoy difficult games, but I found this to be quite frustrating. Difficult for me and difficult for you are not the same, so it would have been nice to have some difficulty slider to make it accessible to a broader audience. I'm happy to play a game on baby mode to learn and then ramp it up.

Making a hit mistake (e.g. not making a turn) is way too punishing. They add way too much visuals on top of an already busy screen making it way more likely that you take another hit almost immediately. I found myself going from a perfect run to dead way too quickly.

WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THUMPER
I am a sucker for games that pull you into a state of flow. Doom eternal with it's funzone design, when you fight bosses in darksouls and momentarily forget that you exist, the entire original mirror's edge, which was my previous favorite flow game that would have me breathing in synch with the pov character. Thumper is the platonic ideal of this concept, there is no game that captures it better.
Thumper is strange if you try to describe it. You're a beetle going along railways in space at maddening speed, reacting to obsticles that appair in time with the dark synthy music, and which occasionally service the goal of fighting a boss. But not a single part of that is really relevant, because Thumper is a game about two things.

RYTHM GAMEPLAY

The game has you push buttons in a predetermined pattern which are telegraphed to you visually and audiably 2-3 seconds before you encounter the obsticle. This is basically like guitar hero or rockband, but you have more sophisticated rythms and inputs. What makes this game imo far superior to other rythm games is it's willingness to explore. There are odd time signatures, absurd patterns, and I'm pretty sure I have already encountered some polyrythms.

In addition to the exiting rythms, and unlike other rythm games that often fall into the category of either being entirely about perfect inputs like guitar hero, or having only a basic beat but more freedom in gameplay like crypt of the necrodancer, Thumper manages to grant both complex rythms and demanding challange, but also some sense of freedom. While the game is literally on rails, you relatively early uncover that you can choose multiple ways to solve individual sections which may have different results, and while there is likely an arguably best way, you will find that sometimes you will have to choose between the optimal method for ranking (based on hit percent), point score (there are some manouvers that grant more points) or survivability (only some obstacles damage you, get damaged twice without recovering and you are forced to restart from last checkpoint), and even within each category there are occasionally multiple options and ways to balance the different parts.

Survival is the base challenge, but points and ranks grant the game plenty of replayability, which is easily and swiftly managed with the ability to replay earlier levels individually, and jump back if you fail getting the result you want from a section during a level.

This combination of sophisticated rythm and limited but engaging choice, makes the game feel a lot deeper than it's peers, and I believe basically all the other games in the rythm family (that I have played) could learn from it.

VIOLENCE PRESENTATION

The music uses a mixture of spacy synths and harsh industrial sounds, both given enough reverb to make you feel like you really are in space. The trippy visuals with reflections and twirling geometry mixed with vague eldritch allusions create this sense of vastness and serenity that makes a lot of this game feel calm and zen-like, but not quite safe at any point. You get a strong sense of this by just opening the game. Then you press play.

You move with the velocity of a bullet train, and the slightly shaky camera and the way sparks fly when you touch things makes you feel like a rocket on rails that could explode any moment, and you might, if you crash into most obsticles you withness parts flying off as your beetle exoskeleton is smashed of and the shattered pieces fly into space. If it happens again, you see the same happen to the rest of you, but in both instances you don't slow down, but the camera keeps wooshing ahead and merely fades to black for a moment to reload you. The speed is constant, and it is devestatingly fast.

Jacob Geller mentioned in a review the feeling of crashing into walls in mariocart so you can turn without slowing down, only you're moving much faster, and I find this a very apt description of the feeling of playing the game. You don't feel as if this beetle you're controlling was ever meant to move at these speeds, much less grind along turns and smash through hinderances, and every move feels like you have to force it, but rather than frustration it envokes catharsis.",1702732184,1702732184,True,9,0,0.636867821216583252,0,True,False,False,True,,,

What a game. The audio-visual feedback after each successful/failed action is super on point! The levels start off slowly where you can play using reflex alone, but the game quickly ramps up the difficulty in each level by introducing more mechanics and increase the pace of your beetle.

You will eventually need to pick up on the audio queues, as beetle will move too fast to just depend on your eyes. This happened to me at around Level 6 Boss. The experience of being able to ""predict the future"" using your ears is surreal, and is probably needed to get S-rank in all the levels.

That being said, the checkpoints between each sections of a level are quite generous and I was never stuck on any level for too long. The levels are also littered with various optional actions that can be easily ignored when you get overwhelmed.

My only negative feedback has to do with the final boss.

You are a little space ship thing that is racing down a track, you need to push buttons to the time of the beat/ time of the objects flying towards you.  It just keeps getting faster and faster, and your timing needs to be more and more precise.  It gets VERY hard after a handful of levels, and can become quite frustrating, but that also makes you replay a bunch of times, quit in frustration, then come back for more punishment.

It really drives home the speed at which you are going and the increasing rate and which obstacles are coming at you with ever more complex patterns. The setting of a single metal track barreling down past the point of no return through hell also contributes to the feeling of abstraction and frantic pacing that is present in every level.

     The mechanical , or whatever it is that you control, doesn't move in time to music; it moves in time to drums and synth-like screeches that hardly resemble music. It definitely isn't a soundtrack that is especially Spotify worthy, but for the purposes of the game feel and overall identity I wouldn't have it any other way. Each level can be quite long which can drain the player when played too long, but it isn't that bad since you can quit at any time and your progress will save.

     What is most rewarding is climbing the leader boards for each level along with their + variants. You start to pick up on certain tricks such as slamming down on any beat that you can and sliding on walls at the last possible moment to rack up extra points. It sucks that it's impossible to take a break in the middle of a level if you want to get a decent score, but I understand why that is. What sucks even more are the times at the top of the leader boards that are obviously cheated and a lack of a workshop editor to make your own levels for replay ability's sake.

     Still, what is here is a great package even when it isn't on sale. It's a great game that could have been a very great game given some adjustments. While I do think that A Dance of Fire and Ice is the better option because of those adjustments. most of all being the workshop, Thumper is still something that shouldn't be missed for its own vision: a spiral into hell; metal to metal.",1699828206,1699828737,True,3,0,0.554540872573852539,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's not a music game in the traditional sense but it brings forth musical catharsis and deep focus through it's surreal atmosphere and non conventional rhythm structures. 

At its core it's an action game that asks you to be quick and respond to the obstacles it throws at you. But contrary to what it may seem at first this setup leaves a lot of room for player expression. There are maneuvers that the game teaches as it goes on that are rewarding to pull off, giving an increase in score or rank at the cost of risking a lose state and a reset.

The visual design is astonishing. I specially liked the mid level bosses which were represented as impossibly grand fractals and geometry, their beauty was as much a hazard as the twists and blockades in the road as it kept me looking away from were I needed to look.

I didn't find the game particularly hard but I think I might be in the minority looking at the achievement list. From level 7 onward the difficulty plateaued for me except for the last 3 sections which ramp up towards a mind blowing finale. 

I think Thumper is a game that should not be overlooked and will be remembered in the future. Anyone that finds it's aesthetics intriguing needs to give this game a try. It's certainly not for everyone. But if it's for you you owe yourself this experience.

Thumper invokes this feeling more purely than Dark Souls ever did.

I've enjoyed rhythm games like Guitar Hero in the past but I never reacted to them like I reacted to Thumper.

I feel exhilarated when I [i]finally[/i] nail a section I've screwed up so many times before, terrified when the music hits just that right ominous note and the game seems to be doing everything in its power to throw me off, frustrated when I crash on a corner which I've hit perfectly the last 20 times I've tried it... and finally relief when I complete a level and find myself at the score screen, when some music plays which eerily sounds just like The Shining soundtrack (awesome!)

I think part of the reason I keep coming back to it is that it can put me in a state of absolute focus which I don't often find in games, but I find really really helpful when I just want my internal monologue to shut up. The closest experience I've had in the past is the total focus I had to find when I played through Dark Souls for the first time.

I also found it annoying missing beats that were right after turns, as they appear right after the screen has to re-orient itself. In general I found myself playing very visually, as audio cues were often deafened by gameplay, or too subtle for me to notice. I also felt like gameplay consisted mainly of abstract beats, rarely actually sounding like music. There were certain parts in level 8 that created a catchy beat, but I found this game as a whole was lacking moments like that. The game's visuals are remarkable, and certain moments (like dropping beats in chains) felt cool, but I found this game lacking as a rhythm and music game.

Puisque ce jeu n'expose son pitch qu'√† travers le gameplay, voici le r√©sum√© :
on joue un scarab√©e de m√©tal lanc√© sur une piste, qui a pour but d'abattre des boss appara√Æssant le long de cette piste.
Ces boss font appara√Ætre en rythme des obstacles pour nous arr√™ter, notamment des palettes lumineuses qui chargent le scarab√©e en √©nergie quand il en touche (ou √©crase) assez √† la suite. Le scarab√©e peut alors r√©talier avec un tir concentr√©.

Finir les niveaux est de l'ordre du faisable (avec un mix d'apprentissage du niveau, d'anticipation quand on peut voir assez loin, et une bonne dose de r√©flexes), le vrai gameplay consiste √† les faire en prenant un maximum de risques pour faire des actions bonus, et donc finir le niveau de la fa√ßon la plus classe possible.
Si c'est votre premier jeu de rythme, je vous conseille de reconsid√©rer l'achat, la BO pouvant rebuter et un certain sens du rythme √©tant obligatoire.

Review:
+ meilleur racing game qu'on ait vu
+ ultra-satisfaisant quand on r√©ussit une s√©quence correctement
+ le jeu qui te pousse au greed, de toi-m√™me, jusqu'√† ce que tu rates parce que tu as pris trop de risques
+ psych√©d√©lique √† souhait, visuellement, c'est un m√©lange entre une bonne grosse cuite et champis
+ un jeu de rythme o√π les bruits des √©l√©ments avec lesquels on interagit sont tous tr√®s distincts et √©toffent le rythme, aidant √† maintenir le timing
+ bonne courbe de progression, tout en douceur
+ plut√¥t peu co√ªteux en terme de performances
- pas vraiment de musique en tant que seule BO, seulement des percussions dont le rythme change selon les niveaux + des sons (souvent longs et aigus) en fond qui renforcent l'aspect oppressant, mais rendent le tempo parfois difficile √† distinguer. Le volume n'est pas configurable :(
- un jeu de rythme qui se joue beaucoup sur les r√©flexes visuels plut√¥t que sur les auditifs ou sur l'apprentissage de la track. Dans certains niveaux, l'angle de la cam√©ra change tr√®s l√©g√®rement, mais assez pour r√©duire la visibilit√© ; ce qui, combin√© √† la distortion et les filtres de couleurs plut√¥t agressifs quand le scarab√©e prend des d√©g√¢ts ; fait que je vous souhaite d'avoir des bons r√©flexes.
- je n'ai jou√© que sur mon √©cran 165Hz, et je vous recommande aussi de d√©passer les 60hz si votre mat√©riel vous le permet, vu qu'on n'a souvent que quelques frames pour r√©agir
- les boss se d√©roulent en 4 phases (1 phase = 1 tir sur le boss), chaque phase se r√©p√®te jusqu'√† ce qu'on meurt (et donc retour √† la phase 1) ou qu'on ait r√©ussi √† toucher une s√©rie compl√®te de palettes lumineuses sans en rater. C'est un peu frustrant de rester bloqu√© dans la m√™me phase pendant plusieurs minutes, en restant en vie d'une fa√ßon ou d'une autre, mais sans r√©ussi √† d√©clencher le tir.

After all mechanics are introduced is when it starts to go downhill. My biggest problem is that the main levels are unbelievably repetitive, they only have a handful of obstacle gimmicks to throw at you and the only semblance of variation they could come up with was to throw them at you faster, for a longer period of time, which was exhausting.

Other people have pointed the problem of not being able to see the walls in a tunnel, these apparently have a sound cue that I still couldn't point out to you after finishing the game, due to the soundtrack being so damn busy. Of course this problem gets worse later in the game, such as when the mini-bosses of level 8 and 9 spawn walls directly in front of you. 

The visual clutter keeps building up throughout the game, impeding your ability to see the light pads, walls, or anything in general. On the 'final boss' of level 9 it becomes laughably bad and it is very surprising that this was deemed acceptable.

The time between checkpoints also varied widely. They gradually get longer and longer in each successive level, usually taking longer than a minute to complete on a single attempt, which was absolutely tiring. But then you would have the odd checkpoint that would take 10 seconds or so to complete, which made no sense at all.

If you don't mind getting it on a sale then the first 2 levels are absolutely worth experiencing, but my lord the entire game is not worth playing at all.

The longer you play, the less fun you'll have.  At some point, you'll stop playing because you want to and instead play because you hope it'll become good again.  But Thumper doesn't, and by the end you'll regret the time you put into it.  Let me explain.

Thumper does a fantastic job of rewarding skill in early levels.  You can scrape by with fast reactions.  Then you can come back and learn the levels, honing your skill and score.  To get S ranks, you'll need a bit of memorization but not much.

Then the mid levels hit.  Turns appear offscreen, with no chance to see them ahead of time.  So you rely on the sound cues... but with so many things happening you can't hear the sound of the next turn over the constant pinging of your score.  You start intentionally missing things so that you can hear.  That doesn't help enough, so you give up and start memorizing.  

But the checkpoints are now one every 60 seconds, rather than one every 20 seconds.  You /know/ you'll die on every new section.  So you replay the section until you get to the new stuff, die, go back 30 seconds, play it again, die after 35 seconds, play it again.

Then the late levels hit.  At this point sound is completely unreliable, and things are coming so fast that even with memorization you can't keep up.  And when you play too well, the game speeds up the pace even more... so you intentionally start missing things.  Instead of memorizing the best pattern, you start memorizing the pattern you're least likely to die doing, just so you can get 5 seconds deeper before dying.

The only reward for playing Thumper is more Thumper.  At first you play to have fun.  Then to see how far you can go.  And then you play because you can't give up.  It's not worth it.  There's no satisfaction at the end.  It's selfharm.

I was extremely down on my luck. Everything in my life was going to shit until I bought this game. I played it, thoroughly enjoyed it, and began to do what I called ""thumping out"". ""Thumping out"" to me was what some might call ""beetle-maxxing"". Basically I would crawl on the floor and make little beetle dens out of dirty laundry I left on the floor, and on occasion I'd roll my own dung into balls so that my newly hatched beetle children could have food to eat. My life had purpose and I was happy. Thumper consumed my life at this point, and I began texting everyone my original Thumper memes. They all cut me off and blocked me, but it didn't matter. One day I sent this girl I met 3 years ago a Thumper meme, and she responded with one of her own! I was beyond ecstatic! For 3 weeks straight we traded Thumper memes and trivia until I had the guts to tell her about how I'd been ""thumping out"" and to my surprise she to had her own beetle dens and dung balls! I invited her to come see my beetle den and dung balls, and she loved them! 

It's now 4 years later, and me and my Thumper wife have Thumper children and a Thumper dog! We ""thump out"" daily, and life is great.

THE RAD: exhilarating gameplay, tightly designed mechanics, complex yet addictive rhythms, fair bar for just scraping by but an incredibly high ceiling for technique. an S rank is only the beginning.

THE SAD: lack of options and accessibility features. more than anything i would like to see options for turning down the eye candy (flashing, glowing streaks abound) for increased legibility and better access for those who may experience sensory overload. more granularity on volume control (rhythm SFX vs enemy FX vs ambient FX) would be a bonus.

Everything up until Stage 5 is quite good, fun, and engaging. 
Since the game is visually noisy, there are some clarity issues at some points. Luckily the ability to quickly restart from the previous checkpoint softens the blow of you getting less than half a second to respond to something sometimes.

Past Stage 5 some 'rhythm's' in the 'rhythm' game don't really exist- Sometimes it'll actually build up foundations and patterns just to go completely against them in the next part. It becomes a glorified dodge oncoming traffic simulator with good sound design for Stage 6 onwards. 

I consider Stage 5 to be the peak of the game because Stage 6's boss isn't really fun at all. Not because of the mechanics that add extra difficulty like the lasers, but because in its 3rd phase it completely defies any patterns set up in the previous 2. Since it's around 1-2 minutes into the boss fight, you die because of the very little time you have to respond to a new pattern out of the blue. The checkpoints mentioned before don't apply to boss fights. You'll have to play the first 1-2 minutes of the boss fight over and over again just to get a gist of what you're meant to be doing in the 3rd.

This game has no story (at least I don't think it has any), it's all about to experience this game. The music aspect is great, basically the instrumental in the background and your actions makes the music. Most of the time the game is understandable and fun, meanwhile it has weird mood, thanks to the graphics and... and basically everything what going on your screen. Playing this with a controller is indeed recommended, however you could try with a keyboard, but that's more difficult. About the difficulty tho, the game is going to bring it to you. Later levels are ruthless, some bosses and additional gameplay elements are making sure that you won't have an easy journey. There is even a Play+ mode, where you have to beat the game without dying... well, if you up for the challenge.

However, there were parts in the game, where I had to react to things, which had no indication and also, you had to memorize a few parts to be able to complete it. But probably my biggest complaint about the game is the lack of rewarding. Don't get me wrong, the game barely stops between chapters, making it fast paced, but at the end of the levels you only get your score and your placement in the leaderboard. The only exception is the last level. Maybe I ask much from a game like this, but this was the reason I played for a hour or two per day for 2 weeks.

It offers plenty of challenges and things to learn as you progress.

The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, especially considering when this game released. Bright lights and flashy moves, the horror filled environment making you feel as if its hostile and that you don't belong, and the calming, but brief pauses between levels that let the player relax for just a moment, before being plunged right back into the center of the chaos.

The gameplay is satisfying, and mixed in with the audio, it feels euphoric to match the beat, collect points, and to slam down onto the blue rectangles.  It introduces mechanics at a good pace, and allows you to experiment with it even on the earlier levels when you didn't know about it. When you start to realise the path, and match the music, you'll feel like you can conquer the entire chapter. The music, sound and gameplay made it enjoyable to the point I felt comfortable achieving S rank on all the levels as I repeated through them. It was challenging, but satisfying seeing that last achievement pop up.

There are a few issues that I feel this game has as somebody who hasn't played too many rhythm games.

The Visuals, while beautiful, can be annoying to deal with too. The beats / rectangles you're supposed to hit can be obscured by the intense lighting from some areas and bosses, and can completely throw you off.
The Pathing can also be to your detriment, as some areas you either need pure muscle memory or insane reaction speed to even know what's coming your way. (Such as walls back to back, or your environment not allowing you to see what's coming)
One really annoying thing that can throw off completely is when you do take damage. The effect of your armor breaking off obscures the screen, and I've missed a few notes just because I couldn't see something travelling at mach 10 infront of me.

I feel the game also lacks additional content, or reward after you have completed it. I haven't played the plus levels which is just a more challenging version, but it would have been nice to see some time of reward for completely S ranking the game.
I honestly wished there were custom levels that people could submit. This would make the replay value of the game so much bigger, and allow for community involvement.

I love this game a bunch, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys rhythm games. Just know that you may get very tired or exhausted from the amount of effort, sounds or visual the game has, as it can be a lot to get through an entire level in one sitting.",1673731467,1673731467,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The visual are an eldritch take on a Journey album cover, impossible geometries and textures warping the usual note highway into an undulating metal rail. As you scrape across this rail at blistering speeds, the pounding drums and rumbling, wailing synths fill the gaps around an orchestra of thumping, clanging, dinging mechanics, which build from tutorials, to rhythmic words and phrases, to sequences and motifs, to climactic boss battles.

Thumper straddles the blurry line between thrilling and overwhelming with grace and precision. Both the dissonant blare of missing a critical input having the potential to throw you completely off your game if you are not focused, and the triumph of decoding a line and playing it perfectly on your controller, seem like direct adaptations of key elements of performing live music. The ever increasing tempo of the beat, the complexity of the note charts, the gyrations of the rail, all keep the pressure on and urge you to master the mechanics, which in turn reward that mastery with satisfying noises and an expressive range of variance. The game's nine levels are quite a tough progression, but if you can beat level 4 then you have a good picture of what the rest of the game will look like. After level 6, the difficulty curve (for just clearing the levels, not necessarily S ranking them) stops steepening and even mellows out a bit, at least until the end, so if you get there then you probably have what it takes to finish.",1673492387,1673492387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

When we think about rhythm games one of the most enjoyable aspects is the flow state that you get into where everything comes naturally and automatically. Thumper manages to achieve that flow state but in a completely different adrenaline pumping way than any other rhythm game I've ever played. The music and visuals really combine to create some intense white knuckle gameplay.
On the other hand, this game is quite hard, and the vast majority of the deaths I encountered were from my reaction time not being quick enough and being hit with multiple sliding walls in succession. I found that the only way I progressed past these parts was due to memorization. What the game intends for you to do is to listen to the audio cues before each section of gameplay but with everything else going on and the frantic pace, I found that quite difficult. The aspect of skill progression that I usually get from playing rhythm games wasn't there despite pacing myself over multiple play sessions through the course of a week.

Couple that with the speed and complexity of some of the stages, your hands WILL get sweaty, your Adrenaline will kick in and you wont be able to stop until you've completed at least one whole level.

As for the Negatives - There are some annoying stages with multiple lanes which can get frustrating, and may feel impossible if you're using one hand on Keyboard. I would recommend using a controller overall, or switch between inputs to give your hands a break if you're marathoning the game.

Buckle up, we're going to Betelgeuse!


You're a steel beetle from the edge of space that's trapped in a metallic hellscape, screeching down a magnetic track as you work your way through musical rails, brackets, nodes and even eels. You crash, you explode, you demolish, and you persevere for eternities through this rhythmic, coruscating, psychedelic purgatory. You encounter enemies of the wildest sorts, from spiraling fractals, to twisting steel, to godlike abstraction, to monstrous shapes, all regurgitating the winding track, and your nemesis: A snarling face, chromatic spines erupting from its scaly flesh, its eyes burning with hatred unknowable - Your nemesis? Your escape?

You don't know when and how it all began - You've forgotten how you got here. You've been thrown around like a ragdoll, smashed like glass, burned to ashes, crushed to dust. And yet you keep going. You kill your nemesis, and yet the track goes on. You kill it again, and again, and again, watching it burst into spines, tendrils, eyes and razor teeth every time it comes back, torn to shreds and stitched back together. You drift faster and faster, and the eldritch abomination seethes with boundless trauma. And then, the final thump. Its eyes go dark, and it collapses around you. But it's not over.

The true enemy. The needle that's been creating the track, hiding in plain sight everywhere. On the title screen, in your visions, summoning your false nemesis every time you reach it... To protect itself. Because it knows the only thing that can end it is you. Time is ripped like paper, as you send shockwave after shockwave at the needle, splitting it, shattering it, and then tipping it over with the insectoid rage of infinite eternities. It falls, off the track and into the abyss of chaotic, trippy colors below. The real end before you, a tear in the hellscape. Blinding light. And then you're free.

A tale of beetle and needle, a game of determination and dominance, destroying your purgatory with every inch. Eyes locked, wings shattered, rhythms pounding, head thumping. Blinding light, and then you're free.


Now then. We've arrived at Betelgeuse, and I think I've made my point. I can't express in words how satisfied I am with my beetling journey - Thumper is worth every penny. It's not for the faint of heart, and beating it requires insane willpower, but you can at least give it a try. And hey, as a reward, YOU get to decide what the ending is like!

It takes a lot for me to review a game. And it is very, VERY difficult to get me to DISLIKE a music-based combat game. So when you mess up #2 enough to make me #1, we have a problem.

The game is SO CLOSE to awesome. The beats are bumpin', the premise is lost in the acid trip, and your little space beetle beats up voodoo faces to the thumpin' sounds of the cosmos.

There's only one problem: there is one master volume control and that's it. So this super fast-paced reflex-heavy DDR for your fingers has no way to tune the sound effects, music, and specific sound queues that alert you to what's coming up. Like, the music is supposed to be like call-and-response: you hear *thump thump clap clap* and you know that you've got two jumps and two turns coming up. But the sounds effects of your jumping and smacking your hull off the walls mixed with the little DING you get for doing it perfectly in sync with the beat PLUS the sounds of you racking up points drowns out the NEXT set of queues. Before you know it, you've got nothing but a maddening cacophony in your ears and your beetle is moving far too fast for you to play by sight alone.

Obviously plenty of other people played this game and can hear just fine. Maybe I'm in the minority of those whose auditory senses get overwhelmed to the point where all the noise just blends together. But this would have been easy enough to remedy if I could have turned the music and sound effects down while turning the sound queues up.

Headset required. It's hypnotic and mesmerising. It's challenging but nailing those perfect runs is rewarding and satisfying.

UPDATE

After finishing the game and getting an S rank on first 5 levels I have to say this is by far the most brutal and violent gaming experience I had in my life. If you want to feel like the game wants to hurt you, try this one. Same with speed - no racing game has ever produced such an overwhelming sense of velocity. By the end of level 3 You will feel violated and brutalised. You will barely survive until the end breathing heavily and covered with sweat. You will think that there is no way this can get any more intense and then you realise that there are still 6 more levels and each one raises the bar so much you'll think it's unplayable. But you will pull through and the game will suck you in. After each level you might want to go back to previous ones and try getting a better rank - It will reward you with an achievement but will also prepare you for what comes next. 

This is one of the most amazing gaming experiences to have. Just a caveat - do not expect a typical rythm game - this is a hardcore survival game that wants to trick you and will often use the beats to throw you off. You will have to watch out for these situations and learn to act off beat, following visual cues. This is about survival and overcoming crazy amount of pressure. This game communicates one thing - it hates you and wants to hurt you. If you are up for a challenge, go in and have a time of your life. Get mesmerised and sucked in by it's violent beauty and relentless brutality of speed and colors. You will hate it back and then you will cross the thin red line as your hate turns to love. 

I love this game. 

Side note - don't play this on deck - although it's perfectly playable, you will need a disposable controller because if you intend to beat it, you will absolutely wreck one. You will also want to play it on a big display with at least 120hz refresh and matching FPS. Not only it will improve your immersion but it will really help you to pull off those split second input margins. 
Also headset - do not play without one and make it as loud as you can bear. You will understand and you will thank me later.",1659303628,1672750773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you‚Äôre looking for speed, if you‚Äôre looking for something to mindlessly smash your controller without any dialogues, any story, or pretty much any thinking, this game is what you need.  Thumper is a combination of NOT doing things that make a game go to hell.
With excellent design decisions and getting rid of anything that could‚Äôve been boring, these guys have managed to make a real experience. With A good balance between challenging and ‚Äúnot killing"" the player, Thumper has a nice pace of getting stuck in a level for a good 6-7 minutes (the levels are mostly less than 2 min), and then right before you‚Äôre getting frustrated, passing the level and starting to enjoy the game again and possibly even more this time.
Since you don‚Äôt expect that much variety from this kind of game I‚Äôm not gonna stress this that much but there‚Äôs not many things you can do here. From the start to the end you are mostly doing the same things and that‚Äôs what makes me wish Thumper was a bit shorter. There‚Äôs plenty of fun gameplay but it‚Äôs not all fun. Duplicated sequences and some of the smaller levels are nothing but fillers that lead the player to getting disappointed.

do you like rhythm games, but are coincidentally tired of baby shit DDR and OSU? well come on down to thumper, the only rhythm game that feels like it would be played best with a stick shift, while also allowing you to live out your childhood fantasies of playing as what is essentially a sentient Hot Wheel, while ALSO living out your naughty adult fantasies of using previously mentioned hot wheels to kill beings in higher dimensions than you

here's some cool facts that might sell you on the game:
1: the game doesn't increase in difficulty, it increases in complexity.  there are 9 levels, each filled with about 20 sub-levels.  level 1's music is in 1/4 time signature. level 2 is in 2/4 time signature. level 3 is in 3/4 time signature, all the way up to 9/8.
2: game can be played in vr, which i reccomend, because it looks insane.
3: game pulls a bloodborne on you at the end of each level and says ""fuck it, lovecraftian horror that exists on a higher plane of existence than you""

I'm not going to spoil anything more than that, but do not just give up on the game on level 3 because you think its repetitive, keep going. once you hit a time signature higher than 4/4 it starts to get a little wacky, everything past 5/4 is when you can enter a flow state.

and one more thing, play until the end. i don't know how to explain this, but they put a plot twist in a rhythm game where you play as a beetle on a hot wheels track. just trust me its insane. if you get there

issues i have with the game: sometimes it feels like they don't explain vital controls well enough. on level 3-1 it teaches you the ""ground pound"". string enough of these in a row, or in quick succession and you can regain your armor. if you press the thump button while holding up on a blue tile thing, you can fly. you can extend your flight duration by continuing to hold the thump button. you cannot fly forever. that is all i felt like the game didn't explain well enough.

I got this game for 5.99$, which is a GREAT price for it. i don't think its worth 20 dollars, but 5.99 is still on the low side. highly recommend to anyone who likes rhythm games and punishing difficulties, but i recommend it even higher to anyone with ADHD

for anyone wondering what it feels like to play thumper, this is the video that i thought of every time i tried to explain it:

I managed to get 2 and was not able to get 3. You are then stuck in an infinite loop of this godawful mechanic in which youll never die as the obstacles arent hard. So after 5 minutes of attempting this I gave up and probably won't play this game for a while simply as this takes all the fun out of the game. It breaks the immersion of level progression to just put a wall in the way of playing the game.

Game is being advertised as a rhythm violence game and it does live up to its nature - brutally difficult levels which leave you no breathing room aside from small pauses at checkpoints. All while doing actions to the beat, performing interesting rhythms.

However, after having grinded this game a b i t I've come to a conclusion it's an ANTI-rhythm game. There are many patterns where you feel out of control AT ALL TIMES while still, somehow, having to stay in rhythm. At times you have no fucking idea what's happening, you just kind of go and pray and solely push through your twitch reflexes, but when you do it, it's a moment of ""holy shit I did it"". And boy, there are a LOT of moments like this here.

As for the gameplay itself, it's pretty cool, yeah. There's a plenty of objects to work around with, such as turns that will brutally murder you if you don't react in time, thumps which keep your combo up (or alternatively you can brutally ground pound them for mad score), bars and rings which act as additional score pickups. Despite very limited number of potential obstacles, the game never seems bland. Everything serves a purpose and there are just enough mechanics that spice up the gameplay and allow for high score pushing. All in this nightmare-reminescent landscape.

Final verdict: game fucking THUMPS! If you have a knack for unconventional games, or rhythm games for that matter, it's definitely a worthwhile investment.

It has a kickass, pulse-pounding soundtrack, backing a great musical gameplay experience. For the most part.

The game is great at cultivating its atmosphere. The music, the art direction, the sound effects, all serve to immerse you on the wild ride through hell that is Thumper. I found early stages to be just the right level of gradually increasing challenge to help you master its various obstacles and techniques. There may come a point when you'll feel like an expert, swerving and grinding down Thumper's rails.

One minor issue the game has is the visual effect that occurs when you take a hit. It takes two hits to end a run, but the exploding effect of your shell being destroyed is distracting and disorienting. There seems to be some kind of invincibility mechanic to prevent you from taking a second hit right away, but it doesn't last the entire duration of the visual effect. You will die on more occasions than you like because you can't recover in time from the first hit to avoid a second. This mechanic definitely needs a retool.

But much more frustrating are the game's later tracks, which become less forgiving, less rhythm based, and less fun. Starting in level 7, and increasing in frequency as time goes on, the game features segments that are less about reacting to the rhythm and more about memorization. Obstacles that are not well telegraphed will come out of nowhere, and can only be overcome by knowing the inputs ahead of time. You will run these sections dozens of times memorizing the track one beat at a time. This is very frustrating, especially during one particularly poorly designed boss fight. And as the pace of the tracks picks up, figuring out the game‚Äôs exact timing seemed impossible. If by level 6 you think you've figured it out, these segments will flip the script on you. Some beats will be more forgiving early, others will be more forgiving late. Some beats won't register at all even when you seem to have hit them perfectly. This inconsistency in a rhythm game is rather egregious. It's really the one thing a rhythm game needs to be get right without fail.

All of which culminates in a final sequence that would be clever if it wasn't so very frustrating.

By the time I finished Thumper‚Äôs final track, sadly I have to say I wasn‚Äôt having fun anymore.

That said, those final levels of frustration don't undo the hours of fun I had playing and replaying the early tracks. I still have fun going back to the early levels trying to master them. With a leaderboard to climb, and always room to improve, these are endlessly replayable. I look forward to shooting for those S ranks on levels 1 through 6, testing my mettle against friends and strangers alike. The bulk of Thumper is a tight, thrilling, pulse-pounding experience you'll come back to again and again. You can get lost in the game for long stretches playing entire levels, or focus on more bite-sized tracks and boss fights for shorter binges. But be aware that the quality isn't maintained all the way through.

Despite its frustrating ending, I still greatly recommend Thumper. As a beginning-to-end ""campaign"" type experience, Thumper has real issues. But as a replayable, score attack, rhythm game, Thumper is incredible. Its dark, unsettling, beat-driven madness is a joy, and those first 6 of 9 levels are worth playing and playing over again.",1654656770,1654656770,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Thumper has a very good formula at the very base: Thump out to the rhythm, with different obstacles and points requiring different techniques, mostly pressing A or holding it down while going in a direction.
Where it fails however, is everywhere else. I wish the easy parts were harder and the hard parts were easier. There are obstacles where you just have to hold the A button and the beat hammers itself for a second or two. You have to look ahead to spot the telegraphed twists and turns and figure out where to hold the button and where to press it, which is fine, but if a section goes on for longer than 4 beats, the telegraphed blips and bloops are layered on top of the bangs and booms of your current actions. All of this may just sound like added difficulty and me complaining because I'm bad at it, but after the occasional hiccup I got through the levels just fine, it just made the game so much [b] less satisfying. [/b] And the mechanics of the core gamplay isn't even the only thing making it less satisfying: the game insists on giving you the most unusual time signatures and off beat inputs, which again, sounds like cool difficulty, but even if I get an S rank three times in a row it feels so utterly boring. The music feels very utilitarian, it gives you a baseline beat for you to orient yourself and nothing else. Landing hits on a boss gives you a little slow motion animation, which feels like a bad joke in a rhythm game, because instead of getting a satisfying hit, the slow motion messes with the rhythm.
I've played alot of rhythm games. I've been bad at many of them, but this one I really didn't like despite the fact that I was surprisingly ok at it.",1653999150,1653999150,False,1,0,0.462264180183410645,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Thumper hones in on being intense and fast-paced, with near split-second reactions that prove challenging, but entirely doable; leading to an incredibly gratifying experience to both play and view.
 The game offers frequent checkpoints throughout each level and allows you to pause and jump between levels at any point if you so choose, however greatly rewards commitment and truly tests the player's ability with some more drawn out parts scattered in each level. 
 Thumper makes a clear point even in the earliest levels, to try and seemingly trick the player by throwing a series of obstacles out of beat or that are barely noticeable. But as of passing some of the later levels, it became apparent that the obstacles themselves were being used as part of the soundtrack; often the level demanding for you to interact with the soundtrack rather than simply copy the beat, creating a unique and all the more satisfying experience as your success is shown both visually and audibly.
 If I were to truly critique it on one thing, it is that some obstacles and visual / audio queue's are lost at points to an occasional overload of the games extremely flashy visual style; making these obstacles virtually impossible to notice unless you had prior knowledge of them. 
 With all that said, Thumper is an incredibly challenging and sometimes taxing game, I would not recommend expecting to complete this game in a single sitting as it also proves taxing even after just a single level. However I would be lying if I didn't say that it has thus far been one of the most enjoyable games i've played from this genre, and that I would highly recommend it to anyone who can handle it.

If you're used to a typical rhythm game you may find it frustrating and needlessly difficult; sometimes it really does feel like the game is f***ing with you. However, if you like overcoming an immense challenge like that you will find this game incredibly satisfying. There's something so good about accomplishing a difficult rhythm first try and going ""HAHAHA YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD GET ME WITH THAT? I AM A RHYTHM GOD"" and then immediately crashing into a beat 1 obstacle and dying. 

I'm a musician, so I can tell how difficult the things it's asking me to do are. What's funny is that I reach a point where I can't really ""count"" anymore the way I might if I were playing a song, and instead I have to rely purely on feel and embodying the rhythm. The game is actually fairly forgiving with the inputs, but it never feels like it's holding my hand or making things too easy for me. It feels rewarding to hit things perfectly in time, but when the game lets you get away with stuff it never feels like it detracts from the sense of stakes.

Basically, if you want a game that's going to throw e of beat 4 rhythms and 3 against 4 polyrhythms at you within the first three levels you are gonna have fun with this. It reminds me of those fake 3d rollercoasters where you're basically in a moving box staring at a screen, except now it's actually up to you to avoid all those obstacles.

This game -should- tick all the right boxes for me. Abstract eldritch horror rhythm game scored by the guy from Lightning Bolt? Sign me the hell up! Unfortunately it's hamstrung by a lack of both variety and clarity. The visuals become so overblown that it's nearly impossible to see what's coming up and the sound cues aren't high enough in the mix to overcome the repetitive, uninteresting music so you'll run into a lot of areas with turns and obstacles that come up seemingly out of nowhere. The bosses look basically the same throughout, as do the tracks, so the only way you'll know you're on a different level is through the tempo and the sheer length. Levels go on for way too long, often teaching you a new trick at the beginning and then spending ten segments reiterating on it - but the prompts for these tricks are often unclear and don't tell you enough about what you're learning so that you can actually capitalise on it.

It all adds up to a frustrating experiences that falls short of the potential it has. I really wanted to like this but even less than an hour was enough to be thrown off by its shortcomings.",1653081083,1653081083,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Instead of playing a single song, you are stuck in a hellscape for stretches of about half an hour at a time, maybe more, maybe less, depending on how well you do.

Thumper makes you attack the music instead of harmonizing with it. By slamming into the track, incoming walls or barriers, you create your own song from heavy thumps, metallic clangs and other noises, with the background music mostly being there for atmosphere. 

By slamming into the track at the right moment,  the game can intentionally 'freeze', which only helps to increase immersion, as it really makes it feel like you did a really powerful attack or something like that.

It is by all definitions a rhythm game, but as I think any music major could tell you, some horrendous things can be done to rhythms. Instead of usual genre songs in a comfortable 4/4 time, Thumper opts for weird time signatures and bombarding you with audio cues, mush, and crashes. Tack on trippy early 2000's Microsoft screensaver effects, and this game will easily overstimulate you. And in my opinion, it does a damn good job of doing that and causing a sense of unease and tension. It makes you feel like you're fighting tooth and nail to make it to the end of a track in one piece.
With all that said, I need to touch upon a few things. There are obstacles along the track, and the game is nice enough to let you know what's coming ahead via audio cues. The unfortunate fact is those cues can and will be drowned out by the sounds of the music and the general sfx's of your little beetle boy riding along his track. This leads to the  issue that you'll find yourself relying more on memorization than the intended cues meant for the player, which is a shame. Those moments where you find yourself in the flow, struggling and making last second twitch reactions are where this game feels it's most addictive. This leads to my next point, the only audio options you have in the menu are the total volume of the whole game. No choice to slightly raise the cues, or lower the music, or any of the other noise. I understand this was probably intentional so we as players can play the game as intended, but it would've been nice to have the option nonetheless. 
Ultimately, I did love this game. Nothing about it was chill, the whole experience felt anxious and had my heart racing, but you know what? That was fun as fuck, and nothing felt more relieving coming out alive at the end of a level. Some of you might even find something deeper and more meaningful within the gameplay.",1651296659,1651296659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Astounding and successful in its simplicity, Thumper shines a bright light amongst a barrage of dull and unimaginative VR zombie shooter games.

The game constitutes a truly one-of-a-kind experience in VR with its trance'y and dark soundtrack. Highly recommended for any people who possess a VR headset and are up for a fair challenge.",1649972238,1649972238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is not a rhythm game. It is an anti-rhythm game. It is designed to lure you into a false sense of steadiness and throw that away with sudden twists and turns which seemingly do not match the beats. Every level is made to correspond with that time signature. It will leave you thinking about any possible leads you can create with real music, and God willingly, your own ""solos"" should you dare thump down and stutter the entire melody itself. 

I was a tiny disappointed with original expectations and only 9 levels, but it was an interesting twist. Unfortunately, many of the patterns must simply be memorized and have less to do with ""rhythm"" and reaction. Since the tribal drumbeats can throw you off the melody hard (especially level 9 which is my favorite) you may find the game actually easier without any audio, but of course that's a boring experience. Still, there is more to this game.

The joy of beat pounding over and over from successful blue notes repeatedly causing short frame pauses and large reverberations is felt in very few games. It is enough to put you in some kind of mild trance. It's like the notes you play and the background beating are two different rhythms but still work wonderfully, the same kind of syncopation you might get from your favorite Meshuggah song. 

Finally, what's most intriguing but has absolutely no impact on the gameplay is the ""lore"". At first I couldn't figure out why I couldn't stop thinking about this game. Its parallels to Lovecraftian horrors really sell it for me, even though I don't care whatsoever for that genre. The visuals are ""asymmetrical, shapeshifting creatures"" and often times ""frustratingly formless."" And that is exactly what the music is. It is made of chaos, it is made to destroy you, not to comfort you, and you know in the final level that perhaps you have gone where you shouldn't have.

There is a lack of clarity with the dark heavy rhythm of the music, sometimes its impossible to pick up on. The time signatures  / tempo of the music is very, very, very unconventional. 
And I can see how it can put people off. Its jarring, it makes no sense. It feels like you have to rely on pure reflexes to beat levels rather than any rhythm at all. 
To an extent I feel like that is the point of the game. As its aptly self proclaimed genre, rhythm violence; feels really accurate. 
Spoilers: 
[spoiler]Only when you start to feel somewhat comfortable with the discomfort of it all by level 8-9. The game breaks the foundational principles of its already confusing world by transgressing on the one thing that makes this game a rhythm game. Like a dying record, the tempo and the corresponding speed of the game bounce erratically up and down; from extreme speeds to slow-motion. It is extremely destabilising.[/spoiler]

it's so unengaging and slow to start
and from the menu you can't choose specific sub sections of levels to replay, so if you get an S rank somewhere and a B somewhere else you have to replay THE WHOLE GODDAMN LEVEL just to fix one mistake
I've tried this game 3 or 4 times and every time I just get too frustrated to keep playing, not cause it's difficult but because I get bored and then when I do make a mistake I can't rectify it without testing my patience
maybe it's worth it in the end tho

it's an odd sort of off rhythm game in that
you're playing a rhythm with your hands that you just heard while trying to listen for the upcoming rhythm you'll have to mimic
of course with DDR and Rock Band you're doing the same thing except you're doing it visually, this game you do it aurally and you could almost play with your eyes closed if there was an audio cue for which direction upcoming turns go, seems like a missed opportunity

weirdly I've found that you can wiggle the movement stick rapidly to reliably enter turns perfectly and you don't die despite aiming yourself in the wrong direction
seems like a weird exploit but whatever

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom

2 cups pumpkin pur√©e from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin pur√©e (can also use pur√©ed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see p√¢te bris√©e recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425¬∞F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices ‚Äî cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin pur√©e. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.

pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425¬∞F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350¬∞F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

I also think that this concept plays well into a rhythm game such as this where feedback is already an absolutely integral component, in this case simply making attempts to amp it all up while guiding the player through an abstract hellscape with seemingly no end, setting a really cool aesthetic to go with the gameplay. The whole moniker of a ""rhythm violence game"" is something that I feel is absolutely spot on in some respects but a bit overstated in others with this however. From a visual perspective, the game does an incredible job at sending a constant barrage of lights and obstacles at the player, with the high speed of the game making it feel even more intense as it almost feels as if you're completely incapable of taking a breather before more stuff gets sent your way. My issue actually comes from the audio side of things, as while the audio feedback from the player's actions are wonderfully bassy and have a ton of weight behind them, the music itself feels a bit off, there's a lot of heavy drums, which I love in music and I think it works well for the vibe that Thumper is going for, but it feels mixed weirdly to the point where it can often feel like background noise rather than the backbone off what you're playing the game on. This leads to the rhythms that the player is following to overcome the obstacles in their way sometimes feel entirely different to the soundtrack, and causes this odd disconnect that made the game feel far less satisfying than it really should have.

While this disconnect definitely makes the game feel far less satisfying than it really should by all rights, it's further compounded by the fact that sometimes it barely feels as if there's a rhythm at all, or if there is, it's too complex to have a tangible enough groove to be conducive to a game like this, especially one that is attempting to be so overwhelmingly intense with each individual interaction, to have these more intricate, difficult to grasp sequences feels directly at odds with the game's vision to the point where it can be distracting, especially in later stages where there are these moments combined with an absolutely ludicrous speed that makes it feel more as if the game took the concept of a ""rhythm violence game in hell"" and shifted its focus towards extreme difficulty rather than its cathartic, meaty feel. The level design is also pretty hit or miss, as while there are a lot of sections which work well in naturally guiding the player through some intense scenarios, there were so many times where the game felt less like a test of anything other than memorisation due to how quickly it would throw things at you in quick succession and then punish you harshly for failing to react to an unreactable situation.

Despite the numerous complains however, it's less that I even dislike the game, as I truly think that it's often an amazing experience that goes above and beyond to fulfill a singular artistic vision with a lot of effort in having every aspect of its design contribute to this one idea, despite its shortcomings in certain elements of its execution. The game is just a touch too inconsistent for me to truly say I love it despite all of its incredible potential, but it's not enough to say that this is anywhere close to bad either. Play it if you want an intense, visceral experience and can deal with a bit of inconsistency and some brutal difficulty.

The soundtrack is violent and eerie, and is complimented really well by the sound design. Getting in the flow and hitting things perfectly will compliment the music well. The difficulty curve is great, and introduces you to new mechanics/obstacles at a good pace and lets you learn things naturally through trial and error. Some of the more advanced techniques (which arent required to beat the game, just optional if you want to get higher/perfect scores) could use some better explaining, but I eventually found them out naturally through gameplay, and some forum searching.

- Highly optimized
- Small download size (for such a good looking game, props to devs)
- Difficult, but satisfying
- Immersion is top-notch

Con's:
- Not for the faint of heart & stress-inducing.
- Can be scary (if that's not your thing).
- More of a tip: You need a good audio-set for the optimal experience, sound from your laptop won't do. Headphones are ideal.

And then there are those sections that just don't quite feel right?

Thumper has a lot of that. Sections that just don't feel right.
Like I'll get though a section, even get an S rank and at the end just think ""ok? I guess that was right? It didn't really feel right.""

So if that sort of thing really bothers you in other games I'd recommend staying away from thumper.

Read on for details about what specifically makes it feel bad.
1. Cues
The game will provide you with visual cues and audio cues, and will respond to your inputs with sounds and graphics.
So as you play what you're doing is being played on top of the cues for the next section.
Because of this you can't really appreciate the music you're making (because the cues to the next section are playing), and you can't really pick out the cues to the next section (because you're making music on top of it.)

2. ""extra"" inputs
Thumper doesn't have you just 'tap' inputs, it also has you hold and release inputs. 
The problem is with this is that the game doesn't care when you release them, so you end up with extra 'beats' of releasing an input that don't fit with the music you're playing.

3. Delayed beats
All of the mechanics other than the main 'thump' require a combination of multiple inputs, some of which must be preformed pre-emptively. Sometimes I swear I'd hit them at the same time and it'd work, but by and large I found that I had to hit the input early way out of time with the music

4. Tempo skew
When you hold down the 'thump' the camera pulls in making the game seem faster and when you release it pulls out making the game feel slower. But the timing of the inputs doesn't actually change!
Similarly, when you get hit the game drops frames as a part of the effect. During this time your character doesn't feel like it's moving, but again, that doesn't actually affect when you're supposed to hit your inputs.

5. Controls
When you tap the input to hit a beat quickly the bug plays a slow 'coming out of a thump' animation that makes it feel really unresponsive (especially in sections where you need to hit many fast single inputs).
In level 4 the game introduces switching tracks from left to right using the same buttons that are used to hit the corners which makes for a lot of misinputs.
Now both of these issues are things you can master with time, but they both introduce extra release inputs making what you're doing feel even more disconnected from the music.

tl;dr
The rhythms in the game don't usually line up with the music and the audio and visual effects get in the way of the actual gameplay.
Combined with lackluster controls it makes for an experience that just feels bad.",1630726745,1630726745,False,3,0,0.493152022361755371,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes, the soundtrack is on the same tempo as the challenges... most of the time, but the point remains that this game would be just as easy - or just as hard - without the music. Like I said, this is a pretty big missed opportunity for a game that advertises itself as ""Rhythm violence"".

But it is a very very intense rhythm game that feels less about getting a song right and more about surviving as you hurtle through space at increasingly uncomfortable speeds.
One thing you might notice is that the levels aren't actually really based on songs, but each level has a bunch of different sections, with each section adding onto what the previous ones set up, or introducing new patterns, and they come together at certain miniboss/boss sections where you're tested on how well you've really internalized those patterns. So this is not your traditional rhythm game, and it's not as much based on precision as it is on survival.
I really recommend this game if you like rhythm games, and especially if you wish it could feel like more than a grade. You still get graded, but I care less about that and more about surviving the level, and that's not a priority I'm able to have in other rhythm games, which usually leads to the point being to perfect each level. This has that perfection element to it, but where in other rhythm games I usually perfect a set of songs before moving on to more, I haven't replayed a level yet and probably won't until I complete every level, because I just don't care about the grades yet.
Things worth noting:
This is an intense game, as in I ended up causing myself to bleed all over my controller (admittedly I had accidentally cut myself earlier, but I still managed to open a cut from several hours ago because I was that into a rhythm game.
The levels get progressively longer. The last level I completed I was stuck on for maybe 3-4 hours. Like I said, they're split into sections with checkpoints, so you can always quit partway through a level and come back.

It is a rhythmic game, but It's not a rhythm game in the sense that you follow a simple beat or musical score and push buttons in time with the notes. You can memorize most of the levels if you aren't able to make full use of your eyes, ears, sense of rhythm, instincts, or ability to find patterns. As a general rule, the further in you get, the more physically demanding it becomes, and the more important it becomes to not just know what to do, but to practice until you can execute it. There are probably some people who buy this game that physically won't be able to clear it, but for most, their biggest obstacle will be their mindset. If you enjoy being tested by a game, finding the flow in the madness, and putting your full focus into succeeding rather than into finding excuses for why it's the game's fault you're losing, then you're going to have a great time. Alternatively, if you don't feel compelled to complete it and can just enjoy the earlier levels, the visuals, and audio design, I think it's more than worth buying on sale.

The game feels very stretched out and repetitive.

The visuals are cool but they severely hinder the gameplay at times. 

The syncopation is also cool, but without visual time-grids like in rockband and guitar hero there is no way you can ""sight read"" the harder sections, and I can imagine it only gets worse later on. So failure and memorization are pretty much to be expected, anyone that says otherwise in a review is delusional or lying.

They ""strongly recommend a controller"" but for some reason the game doesnt utilize almost any buttons of the controller lmao.

A brutally difficult rhythm game with some of the most abstract visuals and music I have ever seen and heard.

Alright so to start off i‚Äôll just say this game is weird as fuck, your a space beetle going down what seems to be an infinite rollercoaster of death, hitting beats and dodging obstacles at the right time. There's also a giant head that wants very badly to ruin your day. After every level you fight this head, and slowly weaken but anger it to its fullest extent. In between these boss battles you have lots of other gameplay beats that I will be talking about.

It's rather unique for a rhythm game, because in most rhythm games you are doing actions TO the rhythm, but in Thumper it's almost like you make the rhythm itself. When you get into the game for the first time, you'll notice that the music is very non-music-ey. I mean its music but it doesn't seem to have a real beat or rhythm to it. It sets the atmosphere very perfectly but when you start the first level- you realize that you are making the beats. As you pummel down this long road of obstacles, you hit beats and make turns right on time with the music and it creates this harmony of sounds. So what I'm trying to say here, is that this game revolves around its sound design, and I think it does that perfectly.

Visually, I think it goes right along with the sound. It's so bizarre but it really gets the tone and atmosphere that it wants, and it is truly like nothing I've ever played. The background can be scary, it can be bright, it can be dark, but whatever it is, it fits amazingly with everything else. The graphics are stunning as well.

Now for the real gameplay. Like I said, you hit beats and dodge obstacles. But let me elaborate on that. This space beetle that you play is going at tremendous speeds, it may not look like it immediately but by the final level you're going mach 99 up in here. So while going this fast it isn't necessarily any easy task to be hitting beats and dodging obstacles. Thumper does a good job of easing you into new obstacles and gameplay parts without completely overwhelming you. You‚Äôll get the hang of the mechanics fairly fast, just in time for a new mechanic. It can be hard at times but you will learn it and master it. There's the turns where you hold down the spacebar and press A or D depending on the turn, there's the spikes where you hold down the spacebar to block them, there's the walls that you have to fly over, and much much more. I find it extremely fun, but also extremely difficult. All of these actions will have to be executed within milliseconds, sometimes it looks to be even less. So now you're probably wondering what happens when you die, since it'll be happening often.

It's not a big deal.

There's checkpoints pretty dang often, so if you die there's no level restarting or anything big, you'll just have to redo maybe the past one or two minutes. While I'm on that, levels are pretty long. Can be 15-20 minutes at times. You can save and quit in the middle though. Continuing, you have 2 lives. You come in with a big metal shield over your wings that can take one hit, and then there's just you which will die in another hit. Harsh but fair considering you can heal yourself. At every checkpoint there is a beat you can hit that refills your shield, and you can heal mid area by slamming on beats from the air. Again, harsh but generous.

So, to wrap things up, I like Thumper a lot. It was very hard, but addicting and fun. If you are up for the challenge then by all means go for it. It's a fast, exhilarating, nauseating ride. (BTW if you have any type of epilepsy, DO NOT BUY.) But yeah, I will totally play this again, and i didnt even talk about New Game+... 

Would face off against the big head man again.

How does this translate to the player? Simply as a quick reaction/muscle memory game. Because of the specific type of music, there's very little recognizable rhythm, and the obstacles don't sync at all with the background distorted drums.

Yes, it does play a music sting about a second before the obstacles appear... that is, for some of them, the turn barriers either don't have a sting or it's drowned out by the background music. For how pretty it looks, it kind of also get old quickly, at least measuring by the first levels, the final boss design is always the same.

I do, however, have a pressing need to mention here that this game really isn't a ""rhythm"" game by any stretch. 

Perhaps I was born without rhythm, but specifically talking about the more later stages the game starts to become less of getting into the rhythm of the music (even though there was almost no discernible, repeated beat for your ear to catch onto most of the time, save for some of the parts that actually repeat), and more about simply dodging obstacles hurtling towards your little, chrome beetle at a million miles per hour.

Is the game worse for that fact? Slightly, if you're expecting something in the lanes of Audiosurf or Spin Rhythm XD. I guess if you take the idea of a ""rhythm violence"" game, Thumper takes it to something akin to listening the music genre ""noise"" or avant garde when your go to genre is synth pop.

Ok, that's maybe an over-exaggeration, but my main point is that this is a rhythm game in the loosest way possible. It is however still very fun and ""violent"" with the speeds the later stages reach. The gameplay is also very tight, responsive and the visuals are great and unique. You'll surely be pulled in again and again to get S ranks on all levels, despite the sensory overload sometimes.

Edit:
I just realised the composer is from a noise-rock band, so that explains that. As a plus, I guess the non-linearity of the music helps with noise fatigue since a single stage with no failure/ restart is lengthy, but at the same time my issue of the game not really being rhythmic for the majority of the time is readily apparent.",1625777650,1625777907,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,False,False,False,False,,,

 Como peque√±a descripci√≥n del juego, somos un escarabajo ¬ø? que avanza constantemente hacia adelante en una pista. Con √©l nos adentramos a un lugar cada vez m√°s terror√≠fico, el cu√°l enseguida captamos que no nos quieren ah√≠. Nos lo van a hacer saber con cada ritmo, jefe y dem√°s sorpresas que tiene el juego para complicarnos el paso a un punto ABRUMADOR (s√≠, hubo niveles que pas√©, pero con la boca abierta).
 Se juega con las flechas y el espacio, y todas las combinaciones que pueden dar esas teclas, cada una tiene una acci√≥n diferente que hay que realizar seg√∫n qu√© veas (o escuches) en la pista.
 Todos los juegos de ritmo se complican, tengan en cuenta eso, pasa que Thumper te pide un nivel de reflejo visual, adem√°s de un buen o√≠do capaz de distinguir distintos sonidos a un volumen bajito (estos sonidos, adem√°s de las cosas que vemos aparecer en la pista, anticipan el ritmo por venir), adem√°s de buena precisi√≥n ¬°Y! estar preparado para escuchar otros ritmos que no sean un 4/4 (Comp√°s que tienen la mayor√≠a de las canciones) porque en el juego exploran casi todos (si no es que todos) los compases habidos y por haber. 
 En base a lo recientemente dicho, puede que el juego no sea para todos. Pero si viniste ac√° por el hecho de que es un juego r√≠tmico, asumo que te interesa el reto que presenta el juego. Por si no entendiste te voy a decir lo que ten√©s: 
 Un apartado visual tan hermoso como escalofriante. M√∫sica de batalla constantemente, con ritmos loqu√≠simos. Una cantidad considerable de acciones y mec√°nicas (de personaje, de escenario y enemigos) para lo que es un juego de ritmo. Y la experiencia √∫nica que brinda la combinaci√≥n de todo. As√≠ que si te interesa el juego, realmente deber√≠as sentir lo que es jugarlo, porque es extremadamente disfrutable y dif√≠cil hasta el √∫ltimo segundo. Y si aceptaste el reto, no te rindas! :)

The way difficulty scales from level to level is quite something. I love how you're allowed to choose how difficult you want to make the game for yourself by going for extra style points or just trying to struggle your way to the end of a level. I also love how quickly you can go from trying to chain slams and perfect turns together to the 'oh shit' survival mode (and back again!). Great game and it holds up even now. This experience is a pure adrenaline white-knuckle ride from start to finish, and after the initial few easy levels I found myself unable to play for more than a single level at a time. The ending part is also quite something else.

If I had something to complain about, it was that levels 7. 8 and 9 (not the bit at the end, that part is fine imo) had a few sections that were literally impossible to react to; generally corner walls that don't come into vision until it was too late or when the track crests a hill and there's a button you need to hit just over the top, although the latter isn't as bad since it doesn't do damage to you. Like I said before, the game's difficulty scaling is pretty much perfect and leaves you feeling challenged all the way through (man, going back to level 1 really throws you for a loop), so it feels especially jarring when you do run into one of these 'unfair' segments. Apart from that, I feel as though the controls on the multi-rail sections to be a bit sluggish (on keyboard) and it led to me skipping many of those sections as it was very difficult for me to navigate through those on reaction. Sure, both of these issues can be solved by a little bit of repetition, but I feel that Thumper is at its best when you DON'T know what is coming up and juuuuuust barely hanging on for dear life. Regardless, this is still a hard recommend from me.

Thumper has you cruising along one or sometimes several lanes, hitting blue pads, dodging enemies and making turns, all to the beat of the game's soundtrack. And let me tell you, this game is an experience and delivers incredible gameplay.

The graphics are great, it feels like you are drifting through some limbo world and the everything has this surreal tone to it.

The soundtrack is... well, it's maybe not a soundtrack, maybe not even music, but it has rythm. You could maybe call it a rythmic experience. Anyways, it's awesome. Lots of bass and  other tones that help you with timing your gameplay. Speaking of....

The gameplay is the bes part of this game (I guess it should be for a video-game...). But seriously, Thumper gives you some truly unique gameplay. It doesn't hold you hand: It throws you in cold turkey, but you get the hang of it easily. That and there are always certain tricks that the game doesn't tell you (some could really be explained, though). The game also introduces new mecahnics almost every new level, which there a 9 of, each with about 20-30 sublevels.
Thumper is a perfect example for ""Easy to learn, hard to master"". And let me tell you, one you've really gotten the hang of it, you are immediately sucked into the ""Zone"", meaning you come into this trance that has you react and play the game on a whole different level, completety escaping reality. Play it yourself if you don't believe me. And coupled with the ""rythmic soundtrack"", you experience something completely surreal.

The game gives you an New Game + option, so that's cool, and thank god you can go back to the last level you played to get that S grade. I wish there were a steam workshop for player-made levels, though. But it must be hard to implement given the fact that the levels are so awesome to look at.

But of course, there are a few things I didn't like.
When you get hit, the whole screen turns red, but more importantly, debris or something covers up a bit of the screen, making it hard for you to recover. This mean you'll get a worse grade at the end, which is pretty frustrating if you want an S on every level (like me)
The game can sometime also throw thing at you rather quickly, givign you no time to prepare. I know it's supposed to be challenging, but you should give the player a tiny bit of time to know what he's gonna do next. It's still completely managable though if you remember what the level throws at you.
Also, and this is my biggest gripe, is the fact that [spoiler]the last level doesn't tell you your grade. I played through level 9, beat the last boss and didn't see my grade. I thought that would mean that there is no grade, but no! I got an A. Which meant the whole level was given the grade A, snatching an achievement from me. Why? Because fuck me, that's why.[/spoiler]

All in all, Thumper gives you an amazing experience for a good price. There are a few flaws, but those are completely ignorable because you'll still have plenty of fun escaping reality and becoming the Thumper yourself. Buy this game if you want a new gaming experience.

Mesmerizing visuals, on top of air- tight controls, with an invigorating, terrifying, and overall nightmarish soundtrack, all coming together to provide an experience so unique that in itself has defined a new genre of gaming. Rhythm Horror. I can say that it is the type of game to increasingly grab hold of your interests the more hours you have. With better skill, the songs and levels turn into Tony Hawk pro skater style combo fests, pushing you to hit every turn perfect, use the flying + ground pound as often as you can, and perfect the flow of each and every stage the game throws at you. Reaching mastery of Thumper is a test of timing, precision, dexterity, focus, and coordination of the fingers, and it is so worth while that I just had to write a Steam Review.

Even within this already niche genre, Thumper takes the risk of alienating even more people because it is very difficult, has an oppressive, surreal atmosphere and all but strips out the music aspect of these games entirely, replacing it with industrial, instrumental tracks with strange, erratic rhythmic patterns. 

However, by making the bold decision to alienate some of its potential audience, Thumper becomes a deeply rewarding journey of mastery, which is made enjoyable by its heart-pounding, adrenaline fuelled tension and deeply satisfying game feel.

Despite Thumper being quite a difficult and sometimes punishing game I think it still succeeds in being accessible because it has a steady progression curve in which levels and sections get gradually more difficult with only Boss encounters to serve as major spikes in difficulty, and I think this is very important. 

Thumper is my favourite rhythm game to date (unless you count Sayonara: Wild Hearts, which I don't). I think it's a simple yet innovative idea that is worthy of your attention and is shockingly engaging. I think many people will enjoy this game more than they anticipate. I can certainly say for myself it's an experience I didn't at all know that I would enjoy even despite being a big fan of rhythm games and music in games in general. 

If you're looking for something different, a cathartic, challenging yet rewarding activity to sink some time into, I suggest giving Thumper a go. It's not for everyone, but it may well be for you and if it is, I think you'll be surprised at how fun it is.",1621237779,1624152344,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Probably a pretty enjoyable experience if you don't do that.

EDIT 4/28/21- I'm at like a sideways thumb right now.  By level 3 the call and response kind of cadence is gone and key sound effects start getting buried in the mix.  By level 4 they start introducing more and more mechanics that punish anything less than perfect play, so you're kind of forced towards S rank anyway.  By level 5 it's so fast you can't really blink any more.

I like blinking!

EDIT 4/29//21- Level 7 has reached ludicrous speed, I'm sure 8 and 9 will be even faster.  The patterns actually got easier but it's more interested in obfuscating the track so you can't see what's coming.  Like before, the audio cues aren't giving you much by now (they never told you for example which way to turn when a wall was coming up anyway).  At this point it's a reaction timing game instead of a rhythm game.  I dunno I wish I liked it and it's well made, give it a shot if you still think you'd be into it.

EDIT 4/30/21- The final part of Level 9 doesn't show you your score until after the credits have rolled and you can't restart it, so I get to do the entirety of level 9 over again because I got literally 27 S ranks and 1 B at the very end, so get bent devs this is now a negative review.

EDIT 6/6/22- They have apparently improved checkpoint restarting and the final part of level 9 will show your rank before the credits, but only for replays of it.  It's a step in the right direction absolutely, but it sounds like I would have had the same problem and had to restart level 9 entirely with the one B rank on my first playthrough.",1619565518,1654555551,False,1,1,0.439215689897537231,5,True,False,False,False,,,

It is incredibly difficult to know what this game means by those things without trying it.

This game has no gore, no jumpscares, no typical horror tropes, no dismemberment, etc. What Thumper does is give you a feeling of tension and sheer adrenaline. Everything builds up to different points and then releases that tension, thus giving you that feeling of ""dread"" and adrenaline.

I like to compare playing this game to hitting a punching bag that is 10x bigger than you, but sometimes you punch through the punching bag.

Thumper is designed to make you feel small and trapped. You are stuck on a track and never stop moving and you have to prove your worth by surviving. Imagine what it is like to be a mouse seeing a large cat for the first time. That's how I would describe the ""horror"" aspect of Thumper. Everything is trying to break you, intimidate you, and kill you. The joy comes out of besting those things and again, proving you can survive in this world where everything is a predator.

Thumper is one of few rhythm games that is actually based off of audio rather than visual queues. I wouldn't put it past you to be able to play this game with your eyes closed.

The controls are very simple. You can play with controller or keyboard and mouse with pretty much equal comfort. This game is difficult, but I wouldn't call it a rage game. Rather than saying ""I can't"" it makes you say ""I couldn't"" because you get better and have fun with each attempt. I will say it is one of the few games where I have actually wanted to fail so I can get better. Though tons of players drop off each level, as seen by the achievement percents, if you can beat one level, I can guarantee you can beat the next. The difficulty rises gradually, but by the time you get to level 9 (the final level) you won't understand how you had trouble with previous levels. After I beat all of the levels once I never though I would be able to s rank every level, cause only 1% of players have done that. But I realized as soon as I started that s ranking level 1 was really just like playing a theoretical level 10; the difficulty increase was the same.

The Thumper community is also great. There is a discord server for the game, with currently in development custom levels, and just generally fun people who are never going to judge you for how good or bad you are.

I hope this has helped you make a decision on if you want Thumper or not! I personally love this game and think most people who try it would too, so give it a shot! :3",1619270832,1619270832,True,28,0,0.775508642196655273,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While the game seems simple and straight forward, generous on the difficulty as you can both have a few misses and not fail a level, plus a checkpoint system, as well as to get S ranks with a certain ease for that dopamine shot (Though true enough, I did not push that far into the game), I cannot feel the rhythm in this game.

Perhaps it's because I come from games like Nintendo's Rhythm series (Rhythm Heaven/Paradise, etc), where you can for the most part close your eyes and very clearly follow the game's music and sound cues to ask for your action, while here between the choice music genre, not always clear cues, and certain obstacles that while easy to avoid definitely require a bit more of visual reaction, I just can't feel the rhythm calling out to me. It does help explain why there's a certain leniency towards the timing requirements, but it's to the point that I felt more comfortable trying to use the visual cues than to rely on the sound which half defeats the purpose of a rhythm game.
Now naturally, this might be a matter of taste in music, but this one just didn't suit to me.

I did look at some videos post playing to see if I could expect some changes down the road, but sadly not.

Thumper is completely unique and while it can get extremely difficult I never once felt it was unfair. The Dark Souls of rhythm games might be an apt description, but really the devs nailed it already when they called it 'rhythm violence.'

It is definitely very stressful, frequently aggravating especially if you're going for S rank, and yet it remains strangely compelling the whole way through.

It's one of those types of games where failure comes often, but each time you get that little bit better. This in turn motivates you to keep going, to try and improve, and when you hit that goal it feels incredible. 
A positive feedback loop fed simultaneously by rage and endorphins, this game does have the tendency to put your brain into a somewhat different state - zen, flow, call it what you want but when you're in that zone you feel like an unstoppable gaming god.

You play as a beetle going down a track and you have to avoid obstacles and hit every pad on the way to the end of each stage. The game is very fast, especially the further you progress in every level. The game does teach every move required to S rank intuitively, either through on screen prompts or through context clues in the levels. All moves except one that is. While it isn't a move required to beat the level, it is required to S rank and I feel they didn't convey it very well. Regardless, the game was still extremely enjoyable, but it is pretty difficult, however you can retry each level in a stage as many times as you want by pressing the left bumper or R1 whenever you want. I was able to S rank every stage by doing this. After beating a stage (of which there are 9 with varying amounts of levels in them) you unlock ""Play +"" mode, which is the same as the normal levels but you can't retry stages.

Pros:
*Fast, fluid and fun rhythm gameplay
*Trippy, if you are into that sort of thing
*Fun and challenging Boss battles in the middle and end of each stage
*Difficult, but not overly so
*Good thumping soundtrack
*Would probably be great in VR if I had one

Cons:
*Trippy, if you are not into that sort of thing
*If you want music variety you aren't going to get that here

There are mild spoilers ahead, but none of them reveal anything you don't see in level 1. 

The final boss, instead of being a gauntlet of all you'd learned, or even extremely fast as it implies just before the fight, but instead what they do is take away tempo and rhythm - literally entirely. It's a rhythm game and in the final fight, the music sputters and skips around wildly like someone manually speeding and slowing a record with their fat thumbs. This makes it go from an engaging, rhythmic entrancing final showdown to a bafflingly unengaging quick-time event where you are forced to carefully learn where each record skip is so you can pull the trigger in the middle of the insane time-jump forward. 

It's baffling to the point where it spoils the entire game before it. Like if the center of a tootsie roll pop had a cat turd. 

What's really sad is I love Lightning Bolt, the folks who did the music, and while you'd think it would be unsurprising for a noise rocker to abandon tempo for the last gasp and have it randomly swing to completely different BPMs, there is nothing to imply this would happen and it's a lazy choice for a final boss.

Don‚Äôt be daunted by the high difficulty, it‚Äôs not a tough as some reviewers are making out.
   
[b]Review:[/b]

Most rhythm games are incredibly simple: press buttons/tap touch screen/flail gyroscopic doodad in time with the music. You are rewarded for hitting the beats precisely, and penalized for sloppy timing. It can be quite a punishing system. Rhythm Paradise for example tasks the player with hitting every single beat in a given level [i]perfectly[/i] in order to get the highest rating.  

Thumper has a reputation for ‚Äòterrifying difficulty‚Äô as one reviewer put it. Yet it‚Äôs the least punishing rhythm game I‚Äôve played. Here‚Äôs why:

In Thumper there are two kinds of obstacles: 
1) Objects that deal damage but barely need to be timed at all.    
2) Objects that require more precise timing but can be missed with no consequences.

As soon as you see a Glowing Red Death Wall on the horizon you can start to turn, even if you‚Äôre several seconds ahead of the beat. Hitting turns with exact timing will give you extra score but you rarely need to do this to earn an S-Rank, let alone beat a level normally. Turning too late will result in swift and explosive obliteration, so it‚Äôs rarely worth risking it for those sweet swag points.

The blue Thump Pads require greater accuracy, but even those have far more lenient timing than say Rhythm Paradise, Elite Beat Agents or Guitar Hero (showing my age with these examples...) Unlike the walls, pads don‚Äôt give you more score for greater accuracy. You either hit em or you don‚Äôt.  

I finished the game, S-Ranked every level, and beat every level on Play+ mode (no checkpoints). While it was very challenging at times it was nowhere near the level of difficulty I was led to expect by reviews (Ikaruga this is not). It did make me wonder if some players were treating it like a normal rhythm game and trying to hit every single beat dead on even when it‚Äôs not necessary to do so. I also wonder how many players are using bluetooth controllers or speakers. The latency introduced by these renders the game basically unplayable as there are no lag calibration options unfortunately.  

I found the difficulty curve to be extremely well balance. During your first play through you‚Äôll just be trying to survive and not worrying too much about hitting every single Thump Pad or Flying Blue Ring. As long as you don‚Äôt crash into a wall you‚Äôre golden. The game slowly introduces new mechanics as you progress, such as the ability to fly long distances by jumping off a thump pad and then hitting perfect turns to increase your airtime. By the time you‚Äôve cleared the final level you‚Äôll have enough tricks up your sleeve to go back to earlier levels and start hitting the harder obstacles necessary to earn an S-Rank. Once you‚Äôve S-Ranked every level you‚Äôll know the layouts well enough to tackle the Play+ mode (no checkpoints). After you‚Äôve cleared level 9 without any checkpoints, S-Ranking level 1 without any checkpoints won‚Äôt seem so daunting. The difficulty slowly builds in this manner so that the next challenge is always tantalizingly within your reach. It‚Äôs structured so well that you won‚Äôt realise how much better you‚Äôve gotten until you go back to an earlier challenge and ace it standing on your head.

Some have criticised the game‚Äôs music for being too simplistic and repetitive. While I definitely won‚Äôt be buying the soundtrack any time soon I think that it perfectly complements the gameplay and visual aesthetic. The simplicity adds to the hypnotic nature of the game, anything more complex and attention grabbing would probably be distracting and diminish the overall effect. 
The visual design it very other-worldly, Thumpers version of hell is more alien than outright scary. Gameplay looks chaotic and hard to follow in trailers but when you‚Äôre actually playing it things are easy enough to follow. Obstacles are signposted well (blue = safe, red = danger) and you‚Äôre shown just enough of the track to be able to look ahead and prepare for what‚Äôs coming. Visual effects are bombastic but rarely distracting and mostly only appear when you go for combos. As you get better at the game the visuals get crazier which ramps up the intensity nicely. 

The most remarkable thing about Thumper is how quickly and consistently it‚Äôs able to hypnotize the player into a flow state. You know when you‚Äôre playing a game like Tetris and you suddenly realise you‚Äôve been racking up an insane high score for 20 minutes straight without even thinking about it? Or to use a real world analogy: when you‚Äôre in your car driving to a familiar destination and you suddenly just arrive and realise that you made the whole journey on autopilot? This is flow state. 

The main thing I want to do with this review is question the game‚Äôs reputation as cruel, gruelling, or brutal (all adjectives I‚Äôve seen reviewers use). Yes it is occasionally frustrating, but to me it was predominantly exhilarating and meditative. Like going down a steep hill on your bike with the wind screaming in your ears.",1611321438,1611327771,True,22,0,0.72060626745223999,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Good things about it: The game is absolutely gorgeous, visually original, the sound effects work well for the setting, and the mechanics (the fact that you're a little bug jumping, sliding and hitting walls) are fun as well. Simply wonderfully unique.

Disappointing things about it: the game doesn't feel good to play, which, when it comes to rhythm games I would say is an absolute must. Rather than a rhythm game but I would call it a reflex check software more than anything. 

Let me explain what I mean by it: to me a good rhythm game is something with music/beat at its core - the sound/""song"" should be intuitively driving your actions, the beat indicating what ""sequences"" or ""actions"" are coming. And then those ""sequences"" are getting turned into visual indicators to be hit. But most importantly: you FEEL that an action should be taken, and then when you nail it its satisfying.

When it comes to Thumper there is little to nothing of that sort. I can remember like 1 or perhaps 2 levels that truly feel satisfying as a rhythm game (mostly the early ones, but the further you progress the worse it gets). IMO The game works backwards: first and foremost it supplies you with visual indicators  - you have to heavily rely on your eyes to hit the marks and that's just not how a rhythm game should be. Most of the time hitting the sounds is a complete guesswork, as you strain your eyes to see what is coming at you, and the music, if you could call it that?? is no help at all.  There is a soft metronome in the background, but sadly whatever actions I'm taking seem completely out of sync anyway even if I nail them. Literally watch any of the ""boss battles"" on youtube and you'll understand what I mean.

So all in all, if you're looking for a rhythm experience where you can get into a ""flow"" (like OSU, beatsaber, musedash, geometry dash or crypt of the necrodancer or any other respectful rhythm game) this will not be it.

The gameplay here is very technical. Most rhythm games give you a few basic mechanics and the rest of the game is all about mastering those basic concepts, but Thumper just kept introducing more and more and more to the point where I felt mentally drained. I had a lot of fun in the first 3 levels or so, but the difficulty and complexity ramps up to such an extreme that my brain just couldn't handle it anymore.

The soundtrack was pretty good in the first hour of play, but it reaaaally starts to become anxiety inducing. I can normally enjoy heavily percussive music, but after playing 3 hours of it I desperately wanted some variation in the music, but it just never changed.

Playing in VR didn't really change the gameplay other than it feeling more immersive and having more appreciation for the scale of the visuals around me. You still need to play with a game pad just like everyone else, so gameplay is unaffected.

To summarize: If you want an intensely challenging, technical, and rhythmically complex game...this game is for you. If you just want to sit back and enjoy the sights and sounds of an abstract environment, with simple mechanics, then this isn't for you.",1610820132,1610820132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You play as a space beetle hurtling forwards in the void, smashing through obstacles and defeating bosses of the unknown.

However, this is absolutely not a rhythm game. ""Rhythm violence"" is a loose term to say ""somewhat music related but will punish non-perfectionists"".

[h1]The Pros[/h1]
+ Asthetics are really unique. Not functional at all (addressed in cons), but unique.
+ Controls are simple and easy to execute. One button, one stick. That's it.
+ Really gratifying to pull off a combo, gets the dopamine going.
+ This is a music-oriented game with atmosphere - perhaps the first. The void is an enemy at it hates you, and it is unrelenting. Yet you, little beetle you, take your two points of health and conquer it out of spite.

[h1]The Cons[/h1]
- I haven't been in band since high school, but half of the obstacles don't fall on beats. While this is engaging, I'm not in a groove most of the time since the time signature of the obstacles is constantly changing relative to the background track. If the obstacles are the music, then why make so many of them optional if it derails the song? Why flood the player's ears with negative feedback?
- Half of the obstacles are hard to see (bent walls, snake things, tunnels are death traps), especially if you are playing well. The visuals are great, but they get in the way so, so often. Because of the aforementioned bullet, I'm reliant on visual cues which easily get lost in all the flair.
- Game likes to chastize you for not going for 100%. If you miss something optional it makes sure to make a loud audio cue that gets in the way of the ones that are important. By level 5, the game forces you to git gud by introducing some unwelcome sequences where you have to go for the optional points.
- Health doesn't really work. You only get health back if you get something perfect the first time - or in situations where you don't need it.
- Scoring system didn't seem to work either. Scraped through by the skin of your teeth? C. Missed 3 optional beats and took no damage? C.
- The devs are a bit too avant guarde, so while these issues could be easy to fix it goes against their design philosophy. No settings to turn the derailed background track music off. Can't turn the crazy visuals down. A nightmare for the colorblind.

[h1]The Indecisive[/h1]
‚Ä¢ No tutorial - first 3 levels are really good with how concepts are introduced. Later on I feel like I need practice but the only way to do so is to die over and over. I'm not one to enjoy hitting my head against a wall, but the game made me stubborn, so I kept playing even though it grew increasingly frustrating.
‚Ä¢ The background track doesn't get in the way, which is good. But it does so because it isn't anything special.
‚Ä¢ Every time you beat a level, it plays a really slow tune from The Shining.
‚Ä¢ No idea what the story is. Beetle goes boom boom swish.

Game warrants some criticism since there doesn't seem to be much on the Steam reviews. Is it a good game? Sure. It has a unique presentation and a really cool visual/audio aesthetic I haven't seen before. Is it the second coming of Christ? Absolutely not. It's a memorization-based runner with a steep learning curve and one of the few music-oriented games I've played which is not a relaxing experience. After the first two hours or so, it's a long, unblinking Simon Says sequence that only became more frustrating as I played it.

Again, the beginning of [i]Thumper[/i] is brilliant and it's one of those games that I'd love to show off to my friends. If you like going for S ratings on OSU  give this one a try. But $20 for a 2-hour novelty isn't something most of my friends would shell out.

But it also has some of the most satisfying gameplay I've ever seen. There's nothing quite like slamming down on a beat, hitting a turn just right, or managing to match the rhythm perfectly. It feels a bit like a sophisticated arcade game, which I like. It also has a hypnotic quality, and tends to put me in a trance when I play it. It can be quite relaxing for me, though it certainly could have a different effect on others.

I will say that I think this game could make some people motion sick. It has made me very dizzy before, to the point that I fell over, but I am prone to vertigo. If you also tend to have vertigo or motion sickness, I recommend playing this game in short bursts. Also, this game is definitely not for people who have photosensitive epilepsy -- the game has flashing lights throughout and I think could easily trigger a seizure.

Another note on gameplay: A controller is recommended to play Thumper but I played up to Level 5 on the keyboard, and it worked fine. I do think a controller makes it much easier though. Hard mode Thumper is playing it with a keyboard.

I'm currently going through the game a second time, trying to get S rank on all of the levels, and I'm having a blast. I've had the game for years at this point, and I continually come back to it.

I used to somewhat like the game but upon recently trying to get S-rank on every level, I grew a hatred for it in an hour. 

There are 9 levels with between ~20 and ~30 stages in them. Some stages will be significantly longer than the stages before and after, for no reason. They will also end up being the most difficult stages in that level and, as previously stated, lasting 3-4x as long as the other stages.

If you still want to buy this, set a timer for 110 minutes before you start playing it so you can refund it if you don't like it. Level 4 is when the game begins to leave the baby level of difficulty. Because of how little content the game has, and how repetitive it can get, $10 or less would be the price I would wait for.

The rhythm comes from your thumps and clanks, which sounds better with your skill. The game is extremely difficult, but never confusing. The tutorial does a perfect job at teaching you how the game works, and you'll figure out what what to do extremely easily (besides on levels when a new mechanic first appears, being the tutorial on that new mechanic)

Thumper has a heavy emphasis on timing and reaction, as you'll need to do specific inputs in rapid succession to avoid death in levels. This will be most difficult on tunnel stages, as you can't see very far on the rail up ahead. However, the game teaches certain segments of predictable obstacles, so you'll learn patterns in its level design that often get repeated again and again

If you're into games that are difficult but not unfair, or are into more arcade style gameplay, I can't recommend it enough. There are so few negatives if this is up your ally due to how well the game is designed and executed. However, if something that requires quick hand-eye coordination or repeating a level repeatedly (trial and error from death) isn't your thing, this probably won't bode well.

I played this game on PlayStation VR, loved it, and immediately bought it for PC after I saw it was on sale. I knew I was going to give this game a thumbs up... until I started it!

With either keyboard as well as PS4 and Xbox One controllers, I have a random and fluctuating input lag. Sometimes the input responds immediately, sometimes I have to press buttons about a second in advance. The pattern is so random that it's often pure chance to get the timing right when buttons need to be pressed in quick succession. Taking three curves in sequence is practically impossible, as I often have to take the third curve before I even get to the second curve.

I've fiddled around with the controller settings outside of the game, and with the sensitivity setting in the game. None of this made any difference.
My PC easily exceeds the requirements and other games and rhythm
games run without any issues.

In the hopes of eventually finding a solution to the problem, I will not be requesting a refund for the game.

The first time I finished this game was 4 years ago on christmas eve using Playstation VR, so when I noticed it on sale(I already own it) for the 2020 holiday sale, I felt it was a good time to review. 

To those with Playstation VR already, it is ABSOLUTELY WORTH BUYING AGAIN. To anyone with VR, it is a fantastic and challenging game that differs from most VR games/experiences.

NON-VR: I have this game on Xbox One & Windows store, which do not have a VR mode(Steam/Playstation offer both). It still looks really good, and I'm sure most people would argue it's the exact same in non-VR if you're sitting close to your screen in the dark. I find the input lag on my xbox/tv is frustrating, but even on my gaming monitor with freesync on pc with a keyboard, I don't find it nearly as enjoyable in non-VR, although that's not to say it's not good, just not as good as VR. I think it is easier to play in VR, as it requires really strong concentration and quick reflexes, and having any external distractions removed while wearing a helmet allows you to focus entirely on the game.If you haven't played in VR, then you will probably enjoying the flatscreen version more than if you have.

I would LOVE to see a sequel to this one day, a total gem of a game that is as weird as it is awesome

There's no denying it's a very imaginative game, from the music to the concept. In fact, when the special effects get out of the way and the tracks let you thump to the actual rhythm, it can be bliss. But unfortunately that happens only occasionally and developer choices keep the game from being great and make it artificially frustrating.

One example is the changing lanes mechanic. According to the developer, whom I contacted, the game is meant to be played using just one joystick and one button. However, both drifting (which locks you into a lane) and switching lanes use the same left and right directions on the joystick. They have fundamentally opposite functions and conflict with each other in a game about high precision. A simple way of avoiding the issue while keeping the game's difficulty is to map the switching lanes to different buttons (such as the shoulder buttons) but the developers told me that it goes against their ""philosophy"" of button restrictions, and do not intend to implement button remapping. I guess developing a Metacritic userscore 7.3 game is also your ""philosophy""?

Later on, the ""challenge"" comes not from more complex beats that one must feel and hit to score higher, but from memorizing and brute forcing your way through a track that's a mess of crazy distracting visual and sound effects that prevent you from seeing and feeling what's coming. Progression becomes less about rhythm as the game goes on. One level's mechanic, I kid you not, is to make sure you lose a life for not hitting a note, which previously would have only lowered your score. Mind you, some of these notes are not at all part of the music, not even a syncopated beat so you literally have to eyeball it. And this is barely halfway into the game.

All of this is artificial difficulty, purposefully lowering quality of life. Players will hit a difficulty wall and may fail to progress. That's when the game failed to stay fun or interesting.",1604738749,1678181960,False,16,1,0.56664741039276123,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This, at its core, is a rhythm game, it is a game of avoiding obstacles, gliding through rails, and flying as a bug of sorts.

You complete a series of sets through a track and then you regain a hit point if you need it.

Is fast, frantic, tense, fast paced, and empowering.

But it is also an extremely challenging experience.

For me personally it was a very difficult game, I couldn't go through with it, it was stressing me out too much.

But I can appreciate it, I do believe it's a good game, I also believe it could've/should've gotten some improvements, maybe some variation in the track's scenery, or a closer explanation of some of the game mechanics.

Like the game never tells you that if you nail a couple of perfect jumps you can also regain a hit point.

Overall it is a good game however, just not for me, too stressful really, goes beyond it being a hard game, it is a violent game, not because gore or anything like that, it isn't a gory or explicit game in that sense.

But it is a violent game because it's loud, and frantic, and as an end result, too much for me at times.

---------

the biggest issue that spawns a several problems is how the game heavily relies on the visual effects that hinders gameplay, giving a sense of complete unfairness of what i think should not be in a rhythm game. 

1: as you get hit, a massive red burst will block everything in your screen for a brief second. after that time-frame of recovery and getting that second chance, there's a high percentage of where i die quickly without the information i could've gathered during that time. 

2: the color of the notes can sometimes blend in the game environment, giving a cheap sneak attack.

3: and to add from #2, claustrophobic areas such as small tunnels and a specific boss  that is up your face will throw notes that is beyond the reaction i can do. therefore i have to rely on memorization rather than going with the reactionary flow.

4: to combat the game's camoflage notes and claustrophobic areas, there are sound cues and small visual cues to aid the player. i'm not against this idea, but it needs to be more clear and well developed. the sound cues most of the time will drown within the music. this makes it hard to discern between what is the sound cue or not. (also, the sound cues somewhere at level 3 is off-beat).

to sum up all of my feelings of this unfairness: i would rather happily use the restart function on a level due to my trash reaction plays than memorizing those tricky notes that ruins my flow that i have no information beforehand.

---------

despite these annoying flaws, i can see myself playing this game from time to time and at least have fun from it. the long levels has to be my favorite part since it tested both my endurance and reactionary skills. boss battles is not that great since it is pretty slow paced (except the last boss battle, since it tries to be different). but to recommend it to other players is pretty much a mixed bag of what they truly seek out of the game. if you want a hardcore rhythm game, by all means get it. though keep in mind of the flaws i mentioned, which may infuriate you that this could have been your rhythm game.

----------

The movements require quick reflexes and learning through trial-and-error at times but isn't too punishing, thanks to the check points and rechargable armor. 

The visuals are mainly dark, neon schemes with hell-like surrealism, mainly highlighted in the boss designs. The music you're playing to have a set rhythm defined by the orchestral timpani and synth overtones. It changes between levels but the great thing is that it unfolds new layers, reflected by your chain performance.

Visually, it's incredibly striking and the feedback has a phenomenal catharsis as every move has weight behind it. The music is this exhilarating blend of dark electronic music, ambience, and massive drums and feels extremely epic. Additionally, the obstacles do seem to line up with the tempo. Being someone with an appreciation of rhythm games, I truly wanted to love this title. Unfortunately, Thumper fails as a rhythm game due to sound design and speed.

The key issue with Thumper's design is that you're often unable to pick out the sound cues that indicate the upcoming obstacles as the mix leaves them buried. This often results in a reliance on laser-fast reflexes to survive. Often, you end up dying since you struggle to anticipate the upcoming traps and thus, lean more on memory to clear the segments.  There's no audio slider for just the sound cues, so you can't modify the mix at all to emphasize certain elements. Additionally, being someone with hearing issues when in loud settings, it became impossible at moments to even hear the cues as the soundscape was a haze of noise.

Moreover, if you slip-up and get hurt, the game keeps going with barely a moment to pause, so good luck getting back into the rhythm when the game is barrelling at absurd speeds. I found I often couldn't nail the timing perfectly so I would just die soon after to another hazard.

Thumper is an interessting game. In Thumper. You take the control of a metallic beetle... of a sort... in this weird, interessting spin on a rhythm game. It's not really music you're playing in sync with, but more of a beat. A heavy, dark, eerie beat in this trippy psychedelic world... like you're the kick drum of the music, I guess?

just like other rhythm games, you're on a straight line and have to time your moves to different obstacles, like flying over spikes, drifting during turns, jumping on... light? etc. I also realized the time signature is also the same as the level numbers, like 4/4 = level 4-4, 1/2 in level 1-2 and so on.

There's also bossfights, that you can only really damage by first going through the obstacles and then hit the final light. If you get hit, you'll lose some of your shell, and can only regain them back through a checkpoint or hitting one of those glowing lights.

Like I said, the music is basically just the rhythm, no melodies or something, like in Theaterythm, Parappa or even Rhythm Heaven.


One thing to take note of: This game can get brutal! It can get fast-paced! you really need to focus if you wanna get through some of the later levels.

There's probably more to be said, but I haven't managed to get as far, however, the times I did play it, I had fun with it :3 If you're into rhythm games, and high difficulty, you should concider checking this game out

Sometimes it's spot on, and when it is, it's extremely satisfying. Other times I felt like I was playing poorly because I was trying to follow what I believed was the rhythm. I adapted and the game really becomes more about visual queues, memorizing, and timing.

It's quite accessible up until the last set of levels, where the speed gets faster and faster, and whatever semblance of a rhythm game remained deteriorates into almost non-existence (quite intentionally I believe). I found myself wanting to give up twice, but I powered through and beat the game. I'm definitely glad I did.

Some issues. I think certain parts of the game that were not intended to be distracting were. When you take damage, there are visuals and a weird time distortion effect that make an already fast-paced and chaotic game worse. It makes it hard to recuperate, which is already hard enough in a rhythm game. As the game progressed, I found the normal visual effects and ambiance made it harder and harder to play, and though I know that it was intentional, it became almost a deal breaker towards the end.

Despite all of that, I found this game to be mostly enjoyable. It's not a total thumbs up, but worth playing.  At it's base price of $20 over six hours of gameplay, I'd say that's worth it.

Overall, this game excels in one category only: visuals. It's a tripply-looking game with as unique a concept as you can imagine.

As far the ""rhythm-based"" part of the game, I'd say the game stop being innovative after level 4 (and there are 9 levels total). Level 4 is where you can finally hear what sounds like a coherent beat or rhythm. And it's fun.

But after level 4, the game devolves. It doesn't introduce any new interesting concepts and ultimately becomes a flat experience, with no discernable rhythms or patterns. It becomes a mess.

But what really broke me was the final level. I played this dumb game all the way through to earn the achievements. I earned an ""S"" rating on every sub-level of Level 9... until the very last passage where I earned an ""A"". At the end of the game, it *literally* stops being a rhythm game and becomes completely random. Despite having an ""S"" on every sub-level except one, my overall rating was an ""A"".

A game that's almost good, but unfortunately ruins itself with a few core mechanics.

The worst of which are the turns, which are some of the most common obstacles. In principle the game wants you to nail the rhythm of the song, but the timing of the turns does not have a sharply defined start. To perfect turn you have to start turning at the start of the turn block, but this is much more of a guess compared to the obvious timing of the A button blocks for example. On the other hand to turn safely you need to turn earlier than the turn block, which means pressing buttons and moving the stick out of time with the song, throwing off your rhythm and timing.

To make this worse, the turns obscure what the next obstacles are, which is a big problem when you have turns in short succession. To make this worse again, the red stripe that visually indicates a turn often gets lost in backgrounds which are also red, as well as the screen turning red when you take damage (often from a preceding turn). To make it even worse, the audio cue for a turn is a clap which a) isn't high enough in the audio mix to be obvious and b) is a sound that most people will be used to hearing in the background of songs anyway.

All of this means that one of the most common obstacles in the game becomes guesswork that makes it harder to read ahead to see other obstacles coming up. The result of which means that the most nervous I was playing the game was seeing a lone turn coming up in the distance.

Add to this: 1. visually distorting the level when you take damage, meaning that you'll probably immediately take a second hit in areas with a lot of obstacles because you can't see what's coming next, 2. pausing the music for a moment when you succeed at some obstacles, meaning that your rhythm is thrown off, 3. having obstacles which each require you to hold the stick in different directions (turns and jumps) very close to each other, making the stick movement feel uncertain and imprecise, 4. some rhythms being very offbeat but not having clear enough audio cues to read the timing ahead of time, and as a result the good parts of this game get buried under frustration and things that spoil the flow you feel once you get into the rhythm.

There are definitely good points. The design of a lot of the visuals is very cool and often unsettling, the intensity you feel when you do get into the rhythms of the obstacles, the way it mixes previous obstacles with a new obstacle or action into a new level , are all good and enjoyable, and it can be very satisfying, but unfortunately the balance of fun and frustration tips too far to frustration.

The giant head final boss of each level also looks super goofy compared to all the rest of the designs.",1593256967,1593259622,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The first thing I want to address is one of the only things that I think brought on a lot of the negative reviews: The rhythms. Are weird. They're often spaced out and syncopated, 3 of the levels (one third of the game) are in asymmetric time, and they're just generally unexpected and complicated. This is NOT a groovy walk in the park. But it isn't supposed to be! It's meant to be a hellish, masochistic, surreal journey. As such, the beats are alien and freaky and weird! It all contributes to this really powerful feeling of kinda losing your hecking mind that the game creates. But there is a rhyme and reason to it all; the rhythms are still consistent, manageable, far from haphazardly placed, and align with the beats... contrary to what I've read in some of the negative reviews. You really think the bassist of Lightning Bolt is going to make a rhythm game with rhythms that don't line up with the music? fr? Excuse me for any hostility, I don't intend it, I do respect the [strike]misconceptions[/strike] opinions of people who didn't enjoy their experience, I just really love this game and reading negative reviews stirs up some... passion. in me. I mean, it's worth noting that there's a chance the rhythms are just too weird for you to enjoy the game. That's a real thing. It does get pretty dang odd sometimes. Unfortunately, though, there's really no way of knowing until you play it. I've always been fascinated by interesting rhythms and have spent some time learning about them, but I really don't think you need that background to get through the game and enjoy it. I think there's a much better chance -- if you stick with it and focus through the more challenging passages -- that you'll be able master the rhythms and love every second of doing so. This is probably the biggest barrier to entry. If you can get past this, the game is straight up outstanding. (To be clear, I also think these rhythms are part of what makes the game outstanding, but it just might be a difficult part to digest for some)

Also, don't expect this to be like Audiosurf where you can input your own music. That's not the point of Thumper; it's got a really fantastic soundtrack which together with the gameplay and visuals create a stunning and cohesive audio-visual experience. If you want a rhythm game you can customize with your own music, look elsewhere. There's plenty of games that advertise this and really are more fit to do so.

Okay, now that the negative review discussion is out of the way, I'd like to talk about why I love this game. The main thing I find so special about Thumper is the surrealism. The only recognizable things that one can draw connections to the real world through are the beetle and [spoiler]crakhed[/spoiler] (the protagonist and the antagonist) Everything else, the world they both exist in (and the world you can exist in, too, for only 19.99!), is as far from meatspace as one could possibly get. It's a twisting, cerebral maze through the fever dream of a fever dream. It takes everything we've known throughout our time on this Earth and throws it out to create something entirely new. And it's intensity will pull you in so that you, too, for the moments you spend playing it, will forget all the familiarities of the human experience. Until it's just you, the beetle, and the roaring infinite chasm in which you and her pierce through the thumps, the banks, the bars, the tentacles, the tunnels, and whatever other mind-bending shapes approach you from the darkness.

All the while, the gameplay remains utterly smooth and thoroughly engaging! The seemingly simple and few movement options you're initially introduced to quickly coalesce into a perfect and magical instrument. An instrument that must remain intimately entangled with the beat of the eternal hum behind you and the bend of the perpetual rail ahead of you if the beetle is not to lose her shell.

This perfect instrument is made up not only of the controls and the obstacles, but the environment's responses to your actions. By that I mean Thumper is really great at letting you know you're doing well even if you're not looking at the score. There's these wonderful light and sound cues, like the tiny blue gems that explode from things that give you points and hover around you for a moment, or the glow of the bonus thump and the little blue cue with a ding when you light it up, or the raising pitch of the rods and rings as you break them in a streak. It's this attention to subtleties that make the gameplay so cohesive, and by extension make the experience so engaging and hypnotizing. I mean, subtle cues like these are the kinds of things that have been a focus for video game developers for decades, so it's not exactly new, but this paragraph is more just a nod to the amazing craftsmanship on display from just two guys making their first game. It's really incredible work.

So now we have a perfect set of controls, obstacles, and interactions to have a really great time, but what about the macro? The long term? Did Drool turn this gameplay into a full game with stages and levels and an arc? That lasts quite a while and has replay value and a fucking fantastic difficulty curve? Yes. They 100% did. Each level thoroughly challenges what you've learned so far just to the edge of not being so hard you'll want to quit, and it maintains this curve over the course of 9 long levels, (each in the respective time signature of their name) until you're tearing through rhythmic labyrinths like Brian Gibson himself at a Lightning Bolt concert. Except as a beetle. On an unending track in an otherworldly hellscape. And each level introduces new visuals just as insane as the last, so those definitely won't leave you bored either. And once you're done, you can play it again to get S grades, or beat high scores, then you can try Plus mode, and beat those scores. I've got 120 hours in doing these things, which is well worth the price. I would probably spend 20$ to play through this just once if I had to. (Maybe not, I did buy the whole game, replayability and all, on sale for 10$... still, I think it's well worth the $20)

So yeah, Thump away in the vastness of this void! If it's not clear I love this game so much it's a masterpiece please give it a try if you can afford it thank god for Thumper and peace out

(extra note: You can totally ignore the controller rec. I have thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing through a keyboard)

A lot of other rhythm game aficionados seemed to like it. I did not. After playing for an hour, I have already gotten a perfect score on a quarter of the game's content, and I do not feel like playing it anymore. I don't make a habit of writing a review for a game I've only played for an hour, but I already asked for a refund (a first for me on Steam).

Thumper is played with one joystick and one button. If you see a rectangle, you need to look at what's coming after to know if you should just tap the button (because another rectangle follows), hold it (because a turn or red lines follow), or hold up on the stick while you press and hold it to fly (because spikes or blue rings follow). These context-sensitive button prompts give me the same feeling I get when I need to make a blind jump in a platformer. It feels like I died because I couldn't guess where the off-screen platform was, not because I made a mistake.

The percussive soundtrack is unique and interesting, but the lack of a melody means you have to rely a lot more on the visuals to know when to press the button. Regular notes can be pressed a bit late, but never too early, while long notes (red bars, spikes, blue rings, turns) can be performed by holding the stick and/or button long in advance but never late. A strange inconsistency which makes this a game of reflexes much more than a rhythm game.

Each level is divided in short sections, and you are given a rank for each (S, A, B, C,...). You can very quickly restart the current or previous section. This system only made me want to retry each section until I got an S rank before moving to the next, but that really hurts the flow of the game and makes the soundtrack even less melodious. Whenever I missed an input, I found myself restarting a couple times to simply learn the sequence of buttons by heart until I could get it right. Thumper is a game of memorisation more than a rhythm game. To be fair, that's a problem with many rhythm games, but in those games there usually is a melody to remember.

So, long story short, it's not the game I expected or hoped for.",1589862016,1589862016,False,1,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I feel compelled to write this review after S ranking all levels. Didn't think I'd be doing it a couple days ago when I finished it but here we are. S+ though, neeeeeever gonna happen. Props to the madlads who actually did it.

[b] GAMEPLAY: [/b]

The gameplay is pretty standard rhythm game affair, with extremely tight controls. Hard as fuck though. Every single action feels tuned to perfection.

One complaint I have is that there's no proper quick restart button. You press a button and press down to select restart checkpoint. And there's input lag in the menu so a couple times I ended up pressing down twice and selecting restart previous checkpoint.

[b] MUSIC AND SOUND DESIGN: [/b]

The sound design is absolute perfection. Every thump, every perfect turn, breaking through bars, flying up and smashing down to score more points; it just sounds so good. Feels really good too. 

The music compliments the game and the levels perfectly but not always. In some levels it can go a bit off but I'm assuming that's by design. My only complaint regarding the music would be that it gets kinda repetitive some times. A bit more variety in the tracks would've been nice


[b] VISUALS: [/b]

Of course, it wouldn't be the game it is without its gorgeous psychedelic visuals. The game is, in one word, mesmerizing. Although, in some levels the visuals can be distracting especially in the red tunnels where it's really hard to see the turns. But once you start looking for them it's not that hard.

The bosses look so fuckin good it's insane.

[b] STORY: [/b]

About the story, you might've thought it's just a space beetle hurtling through a hellish void trying to take down a giant demonic head. That's where you're wrong. It's more than that. The answer is in the giant head's name. CRAKHED

Yes, the game is about a crakhed. Specifically, a crakhed you're trying to stop from doing more crak. You fly through the void helping and fighting through all the issues he had. Including his perception of his own image, hence the demonic face. Slight spoilers below:

Then you finally get through to him, all is okay for a bit until he starts to relapse, hence the last level with the speed warping. And yes, the true boss is a pyramid. A pyramid scheme. THE pyramid scheme that led to this crakhed's downfall. 

In the end you manage to take down the pyramid scheme and a glimmer of hope appears in the crakhed's future as you speed towards the light at the end of a very long tunnel.

The message is quite clear. Stay away from crak and pyramid schemes. They'll ruin your life.

[b] CONCLUSION: [/b]

So yeah, that's about it. As mentioned in other reviews, you can also play this with a keyboard, no need for a gamepad. It's even better too cuz then you can have a separate finger on each button instead of just a thumb on the dpad/thumbstick.

All in all, fantastic game, most likely even better in VR. Buy it please and hope for a sequel.",1588069256,1588176883,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Just play it. The rhythm is sometimes difficult to find, especially if I don't match the pattern properly, but when i'm in the flow, it sounds really dark and thrilling and it sucks me in big time. I enjoy the bass / sound effects especially with my headphones and I get the most kicks by playing it right. The visuals are great too and well, I haven't played it much yet. 

So under influence of this some kind of dark earie music, ride the beetle and enjoy the bad/neat trip.

The main objective of this game is to navigate through a stage by thumping beats, drifting around corners, flying over spike pits and swerving between lanes in fast succession. 

As the game progresses, lanes begin to twist and turn as hazards appear in multiple lanes. You'll find yourself frantically weaving between lanes as you dodge lasers, drift around corners and fly over spike pits. The player can achieve a combo through flawless reaction times to the obstacles, which in turn, improves the player's overall score at the end of the stage. If a player misses a beat or drift they lose their combo. The same applies when a player fails to react to an obstacle, such as a drift or spike pit. Combos alter the sound effects associated with drifting, thumping beats and flying. This is a nice touch. 

Midway through, as well as the end of a stage, the player will encounter a boss.  The player must thump beats in a sequence whilst avoiding obstacles in order to eliminate the bosses. The same sort of boss appears in the first few levels, but becomes more monstrous during the later stages as the game increases in difficulty. Bosses are able to obstruct the players vision by displaying a flashy pattern, manipulating the speed of time, or shooting lasers at the player. It is extremely difficult to react to the obstacles and hazards when a psychedelic pattern is displayed on a winding and twisting path. There are a number of unique bosses in this game which all have their own quirks. 

The nature of each level is different, as are the bosses. However, the increase in difficulty and the introduction of new features in the levels keeps the game interesting. The core game play features remain the same. (Thumping, drifting, flying and swerving between lanes). I cannot stress enough, more game play mechanics does not equal a good game, as this game does a wonderful job of utilising these few mechanics in a way which keeps it fresh and intense for the player. 

The levels of this game are broken down into individual stages which make up an entire level, meaning you can continue game play at the exact stage you left off at within any one of the nine levels. At the end of a stage, you are graded based upon the preciseness of your reaction time to the obstacles within each stage. This counts towards your overall grade at the end of the level. In order to achieve an S grade, you must achieve and S grade in most stages of the level. If you are an achievement hunter, competing all levels with an S grade will be quite the challenge. 

In terms of replay value, this game can become predictable after a while. However, the fast paced game play and solid game play mechanics are what kept me invested for so long. Each level feels unique and the difficulty of each proceeding level is scaled perfectly.",1583268769,1628897216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, the backing music doesn't really match the cues that are given, and a combination of overlapping noises from both the current actions and upcoming ones means that it is hard to discern what could be approaching. On top of that, the ""notes"" you play to are so syncopated from the background music in Level 5 and onwards that it just becomes a guessing game as to what will appear.

The beats are designed to be difficult by their respective placement in the rhythm, not by the difficulty of the beat itself. To clarify: you're not busy thumping out insane, good sounding rhythms to a soundtrack, instead you're trying to hit two or three specific notes at 7/16th of a beat because 7/16th is ""technically"" still in the rhythm.

I also went into this game blind, looking through my collection of rhythm-based games I accumulated over time, which I think added to the wow-factor.

When going into this game, expect only abstract, adrenaline-packed, chaotic, space-odyssey-2001 fun-ride, and make sure to bring your bass-heavy headphones/speakers, because you will need them. I am only 3 levels in, because it's so intense that after 3 levels my focus was severely slipping, like feeling sick after eating too much good stuff, and I love it! I love the intensity, the sound design, the visual design, everything about it. 

What I wouldn't call it is a ""rhytm"" game per se. It has rhythm elements, but in the same way racing games are rhythm based. The rhythm of the soundtrack more or less complements the gameplay, and honestly I couldn't tell two two squats about the soundtrack beyond that it's fairly simple, and that's a good thing! The music, just like the visual design, is simple yet abstract in design, meant become absorbed by the background, to minimize the clutter while maximising it at the same time, but unlike games that use clutter to overwhelm you to keep you attentive, the clutter here is mostly aesthetic! It is a very risky design, as I can tell how it can make you feel sick after prolonged exposure, but you know what else makes you sick if you have too much of? Sugar. Because just like sugar, it's a treat to play! But just how with confectionery, keep it in moderation! 

The experience I would compare to a reaction-esque arcade racer, like Burnout Revenge/3 or Split Second, and it's one of the single digit games that made me say ""holy shit"" outloud, and possibly one of the only games that makes me feel glad when I lose, because I just don't want that experience to end. For the pessimists that feel obligated to be impressed and are going to be nitpicky, pass this title, but if you're looking for something to kick back, relax, get your adrenaline pumping, maybe a party game, or to test your VR, don't hesitate!

This game. It's special. It's a cross between a religious experience and 70s arcade games.

It slowly pushes you along a psychedelic wavy track and introduces you to a series of abilities and obstacle patterns which feel oddly simple to remember. At first. The further your go through the game it gradually cranks up the speed into a frenetic high-octane warp-speed deathtrack that pumps up an adrenaline-fueled trance, with your reflexes oddly agreeing along a series of patterns that are both comfortably familiar and surprisingly deceptive. Then you die and try over and over until you finally get your brain to remember that surprise curve that you kept crashing into.

In other words it's technically a reflex-based arcade game with visuals and a soundtrack that make you feel like your at the edge of the cosmos racing into a forbidden dimension.

The scoring seeming inconsistent at times (performing badly, taking damage, still getting an A or even S at times/do damn near perfect, miss a few things, suddenly a C) definitely soured my mood.

If you've got bullet-time levels of reflexes, go for it. Otherwise you're probably gonna find a wall of ""This isn't fun anymore"" like I did.

C'est un jeu de rythme dans une ambiance horreur-psych√©d√©lique qui demandera une tr√®s grande pr√©cision.
Le moins que l'on puisse dire, c'est que c'est difficile mais c'est ce qui fait que lorsqu'on r√©ussit √† encha√Æner les inputs que le jeu nous envoie parfois sadiquement, hors du rythme, on ressent une intense satisfaction.
D'autant plus que le jeu n'est pas ""coup√©"" comme peuvent l'√™tre parfois les jeux du genre, ici on se lance dans des longs niveaux et apr√®s chaque checkpoint le jeu continue sans hacher le d√©roulement de la partie et on peut choisir de rejouer le CP pr√©c√©dent ou de reprendre encore plus t√¥t, on peut donc passer une trentaine de minutes d'affil√©e sur les derniers niveaux sans voir un menu et c'est tr√®s agr√©able.
La bande son est vraiment sympathique, mais ce sont vraiment les sons li√©s √† vos inputs qui font la diff√©rence et qui contribuent √† l'immersion et l'ambiance du jeu.

Si je devais faire une critique, c'est que le jeu est quand m√™me assez on√©reux au prix fort (20‚Ç¨, √† voir √† quel point vous comptez revenir dessus une fois termin√©), qu'il devient tr√®s vite difficile (un mode facile pour faciliter l'apprentissage des novices serait vraiment une super am√©lioration) et que dans l'ensemble il est assez lin√©aire.

At the beginning of each level there something sort of like a ""tutorial"" that you have to pass. It doesn't spell things out for you so you have to try stuff and I believe that was a deliberate decision by the developers so I't just how the game works it's not poor design and I personally think that if you can manage to explain how the game works through the actual gameplay, without a single written word then that is some of the best game design.

kinda speaks for itself. totally trippy but way too hard to play while high unless you stick to the first couple worlds. thumper does do a good job of teaching the player by slowly immersing them and scaling the difficulty just so, sometimes putting easier levels right after more difficult level to show you how much you've improved. you're the player dude, unless you only read about games and don't play them. there is one particular jump i can't figure out and the game never insists you do this trick, it's only for S ranks as far as I can tell, where you'll need to jump, land, and immediately jump again.

Thumper is an excellent rhythm game for those who are fans of the genre. I find that I play it in little bursts from time to time.

When the music doesn't tell you what's coming, you're waiting for the visual clues instead of anticipating them/learning the motifs etc.

If you're happy to practice and rote-learn - you'll find a challenge here AND the atmosphere is really quite cool

I find the need to learn an absolute chore tho - other games have shown this can be done SO much better (see the 'Bit Trip Runner' games in particular) - so it's a ""Not Recommended"" from me.

 A lot of this game is really just trial and error, because it's so ridiculously fast paced that I can't imagine anyone could do a good blind run on most levels. The boss levels feel very different from the rest of the game, and are noticeably easier (so far) which is a little counter intuitive.

It's a fucking rhythm game with a beetle.
This game is like guitar hero on acid, but without the guitar nor the acid,
Holy fucking pee pee this game is crazy.
If you like the Rhythm Heaven games, you'll probably like this one, although this one may 
be a bit more challenging as it requires faster reaction time. 
The notes sometimes can be asynchronous, but it's always on beat, so it remains consistent, 
but that doesn't mean it wont pull a fast one on you, in fact, %90 of your deaths will be
because of something you weren't expecting.
This game will occasionally have motifs per level that are more there for a quick refresher, 
like a break, and you look forward to seeing them as you know what to expect. 
Due to wanting to get S tier on many of the levels, and restarting often because of it, I
can't really tell you how long it will take you to beat the game on your first playthrough,
but I didn't officially beat the game until around 13 hours in. I still don't have S tier on 
all the levels, but I was playing this on my laptop, so I can expect myself to do better once 
I try this game on my desktop. This game runs well, over 100 frames per second on my laptop when the framerate cap is off. I was playing the steam version, as it offers all kind of support, such as Virtual Reality, controller, keyboard, and so on, but this game is available on other platforms too. There is even a phone version of it as well. 
If you were blind, you could beat this game, but it would be hard. It's not impossible, and you can hear cues ahead of time to indicate when you need to perform an action, however it isn't consistent, such as the rail snakes.
However, for a $20, I don't really see myself spending that kind of money for this kind of game.
Although its chock full of content, most of it is repetitive, and i feel that a $10 price point 
would be more reasonable for what the game is.
Fortunately the steam sale made it only $5, which i felt made this game %100 worth it. 
If you are a hardcore music lover slash rhythm game lover, go for it, but
if you are a regular gamer, wait for it to go on sale,
and if you are just a casual gamer, probably pick this up if it's $5, otherwise you 
probably wont get the full enjoyment from the game.

Playing it feels like driving 300 MPH on a crowded freeway with no brakes.  The game is deceptively simple on the surface, but quickly divulges into an intense and unforgiving challenge after it introduces you to the basic mechanics. The moment you feel like you grasp Thumper's rudiments, it immediately shifts the difficulty and pulls you out of your comfort zone again. Not only are new mechanics repeatedly introduced as you get up to speed with the playstyle, the rhythm itself is constantly changing between levels, making each one disorienting and strenuous to beat. Basically, the only elements in this game that's invariable across all levels is that it keeps you on your toes and feels extremely rewarding to beat every time.

As for the sound, this game is very aptly named. Every beat, hit and crash in Thumper seems explosively loud and violent. Aside from the feeling of accomplishment after surviving each level, the primary incentive to persevere through all of the challenge is getting to hear the amazingly satisfying percussion for as long as possible. In most rhythm games I've played, the music takes a sort of back seat to the gameplay and you're left to focus on the visuals to stay in step. In Thumper, your role is to [b][i]BE[/i][/b] the percussion, so maintaining the rhythm itself becomes the central gratifying goal of the game while the visuals actually try to divert (and kill) you.

It would be a mistake to compare this to any typical rhythm game. It plays differently and the satisfaction comes from different places. I would definitely recommend that anyone looking for a relaxing experience steer clear of this title. But you're interested in a highly intense rhythm game, you'll probably find that Thumper stands out from the rest in this genre.

E' anche difficile da descrivere giochi del genere, rasenta l'assoluta perfezione. 
Musiche, suoni, immagini astratte che riportano inevitabilmente ad un misto tra frattali in stile sci-fi dei film degli anni '70/80 e le illustrazioni del film di The Wall, dall'omonimo album dei Pink Floyd, amalgamati e in perfetta sinergia tra loro. Impostato a difficolt√† graduale, si arriva sempre di pi√π a livelli di sfida veramente ostici ma incredibilmente soddisfacenti, che portano il giocatore sempre pi√π verso uno stato di trance onirico, causato dalla ripetizione quasi meccanica delle azioni da compiere ma senza mai ripetere veramente a memoria, in quanto √® richiesta molta concentrazione. Se ci aggiungiamo i frattali clamorosamente d'effetto scorrerci velocissimi davanti agli occhi, l'effetto complessivo porta ad uno stato di trance onirico molto simile ad un trip, che si traduce in un senso di profondo appagamento sensoriale.

Io ho LA FORTUNA di giocarlo in VR con un Oculus Rift S, perch√® √® qualcosa di assolutamente, clamorosamente, PAZZESCO, da lasciarmi totalmente a bocca aperta (mentre scrivo la recensione ho ancora i flash del gioco negli occhi). 
A guardarlo dalle immagini della pagina del prodotto verrebbe da dargli poca importanza, dando l'idea di un giochino indie simile a giochi da smartphone, in VR invece si tende a cercare l'esperienza con la graficona, infatti l'ho sempre tralasciato a favore di altri.. l'ho comprato solo adesso e che dire... SI MANGIA a colazione un sacco di altri giochi, √® un'esperienza talmente impattante che trovo sia un assoluto must-have per chiunque abbia un visore! Davvero, sto faticando a trovare le parole per descriverlo perch√® una cosa del genere la si riesce a comprendere solo provandola!

Sicuramente molto divertente se giocato su monitor, in VR per√≤ diventa un'esperienza ai limiti dell'assurdo. Psichedelia ai massimi livelli, un trip incredibilmente gratificante. Vi avviso per√≤, si arriveranno a livelli di sfida difficilissimi che vi porteranno anche a rifare 100,200, 300  volte la stessa operazione (ma non vi frustrer√† pi√π di tanto, se non esagerate, per via delle meraviglie che vi sfrecceranno davanti), soprattutto nelle bossfights. Quella del livello 3 mi ha costretto, penso, a 300 e oltre tentativi, a livelli avanzati la difficolt√† diventa folle ma mai impossibile, riderete addirittura per la situazione folle in cui vi trovate, ma non vi fermerete, sarete, ipnotizzati, ad andare avanti, a sfrecciare alla velocit√† della luce, anche se alcuni livelli vi sembreranno ai limiti dell'impossibile, causa movimenti pazzeschi e velocit√† supersonica che diventa sempre pi√π evidente, fino al punto da darvi alla testa. E' un gioco per chi vuol mettersi alla prova perch√® dar√† veramente tanto filo da torcere. Proseguendo per√≤, vi renderete conto che riuscirete sempre pi√π a fare cose che prima pensavate quasi impossibili, qui non √® lo scarabeo a migliorare tramite modifiche varie, qui siete VOI a prendere esperienza, √® come un linguaggio da apprendere, sarete voi stessi a migliorare e superare dei limiti, che, andando avanti, vi faranno percepire semplici degli scogli che prima erano quasi insormontabili. Vi sentirete quasi dei giocolieri a riuscire a fare, anche senza problemi dopo un p√≤, delle cose che, poche ore prima, vi avrebbero lasciato senzia fiato per la difficolt√†.

La perfezione, tra i giochi, anzi, chiamarlo gioco √® riduttivo, tra le esperienze pi√π pazzesche mai provate in VR e in generale, oserei dire che c'√® una mente geniale dietro questo titolo, costasse 60 euro lo comprerei ugualmente ad occhi chiusi. Potrebbe tranquillamente diventare uno dei miei giochi preferiti di sempre, di ogni tempo.

Just a warning. Now, onto the game itself:

Note that I'll probably have a lot of trouble explaining my feelings because it's a very unique game.

I absolutely love Thumper. I'm not that into rhythm games, other than Thumper I played Audiosurf and another game similar to guitar hero which I cannot remember the name now but what I can say is that Thumper is fundamentally different than those other games. I would even go as far as to say Thumper is not really a rhythm game but rather a ""reaction game"". Music doesn't play that big of a role in Thumper, because what happens on the ""track"" is very often off-beat. It's a bit hard to explain. Music doesn't change throughout the game, it's really just a single tune but in different rhythm patterns, and on top of that, when the same rhythm is playing, different situations can occur on track, so reacting to the music itself won't get you anywhere. You have to observe the game, look ahead and to some extent even predict the next move you'll have to do. I don't want to spoil too much, but it makes sense because this gameplay mechanic is tied nicely to the plot. The beetle is actually fighting creatures and beings from higher dimensions etc. so it feels really satisfying when you're in the zone and predicting the next turn feels like your perception of reality is ascending to another level. (That's a small exaggeration obviously but you know what I mean :D)

This is how the game gives you some freedom in beating the levels: Your beetle has an iron shell protecting you from one mistake, after you lose it there is one way to regenerate it, a ""stomp"". It happens in a tutorial stage when you have to jump over a weird spike trap or something, and it's at that moment you regenerate your shell. What the game doesn't tell you about is that you can do the stomp at any time. Even when you don't need to jump over the trap. Another example, when the track splits into multiple lanes later on, you don't have to hit every corner ramp to progress, you may chose to grind on it, sure, but you can just ignore it and proceed just fine.

What made me change my opinion about Thumper from ""Pretty good"" to ""Absolutely amazing"" was the ending. It blew my mind a bit. It's also involving the plot so I cannot say anything in regards to that but, it was absolutely worth to play through the entire game, just for that one bit at the end. ;)

Does the game have flaws? Hmm, no, not really. I didn't encounter any bugs or design issues that made me enjoy the game less. Nothing of that matter occured at any point.

Thumper is amazing. Highly recommended if you enjoy electronic beats and sci-fi premise with a subtle yet interesting plot.

Thumper is a stylish and fast paced rhythm game. In many ways it uses your typical rhythm game elements, but it does so in a way that feels unique and fresh. That said, this game is a damn bastard and the difficulty spikes HARD at times. Also, it is SUPER important to have a good controller that you might not mind wearing out the X/A button on.

PROS:
+Shiny visuals
+Interesting enemy and boss design
+Nice rhythm elements (obstacles are the sounds that complements the ""beat"", not just music tracks)

CONS:
-The difficulty (around level 4/5 there is a noticeable spike)
-Level select (you can select major levels 1-9, but not the 20+ checkpoints per level)

FULL REVIEW:
Thumper has been on my radar for a while now. I've always been interested in rhythm games and play them from time to time. The caveat being I'm no expert on this genre. I can handle myself in games like Beat Saber at a Hard (sometimes Expert) level but anything more than that and my brain just can't handle it. Thumper just kind of naturally progresses to that point as the game goes along. Around level 4/5 there is a noticeable spike in difficulty. I was able to S rank levels 1-3, but quickly gave up after seeing what gets thrown at you in later levels. There's only maybe 5-6 actions you have to do, but the game starts throwing them at you at EXTREMELY high speeds and in brain bending combinations. Around level 8 and 9 things started to get more frustrating than fun, but persevering through all the nonsense felt fantastic.",1561858463,1561858463,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

One thing that might turn people off from it is that there are a lot of audio cues that have to be heard over the soundtrack playing. If you can't hear them, you'll be forced to rely on trial and error, and that can be a little rough and sap you of enjoyment.

GORGEOUS

It's a REALLY good start for VR players

Made it to level 5 so far. The pacing was a little slow. There are basically sub levels before you hit the actual next level and next step in the difficulty really only raises 1-2 time per actual level (not sub levels)

You are pretty much playing the game to the beat of the music which is really cool and helps you figure out whats coming next. What might be my biggest gripe is the song.... never really changes.

Anyway, this game makes you feel like on drugs, but the good kind. I would definitely recommend Thumper to everyone who enjoy a good challenge unless flashing colors make you sick. Play in the dark or with vr. It's epic.

There are 9 levels in total. After completing them you unlock play+ which contains the same 9 levels except on hardcore mode with light speed and permadeath. You also get to play as a golden beetle there, yay.

Btw please add more levels! I completed everything S rank but I want more!

It's hard to describe the game play coupled with the experience; 

It's a Rhythm mechanic based ultra precision interactive music video inspired by gonzo Synthwave fantasy-future aesthetics that I found reminiscent of Rush's 2112 experimental album, Star One - Earth That Was, The Heavy Metal series, The Mirror Universe from Dr.Strange and the fight with Dormamu, or obviously going to a planetariums laser light show absolutely stoned into another dimension.
 
It's like playing a musical instrument that you pulled out of a glowing crystal meteorite that landed in your backyard, that you've never seen before, then suddenly finding yourself in a life or death jam session against the elder evils that dwell in the darkness between the stars. 

I'm pretty sure if you beat this game with a 90% or higher you'll be drafted into some alien war to bring peace to some distant nebula filled with sentient space beetles. This isn't VR, this is first contact, a test to see if we are worthy to make contact with. I will name my beetle wife or husband Janet, I don't know if they have ears though, so I've also prepared a ceremonial hand gesture. My egg spawn will be the next generation of mighty warriors and carry on my legacy.

Thumper is an awesome rythm psychedelic fast-paced experience. It requires you to enter a trance like stage if you are like me who likes to get S-ratings at every stage.

I can only explain the soundtrack as a high speed, sinister orchestral score. While not always having a easy to make out rythm in some stages, you will feel immensely satisfied when you can clearly hear it and execute everything perfectly.

The controls are easy to remember and understand, what's hard in this game is reaction skills to hit every note and turn.  As mentioned I like to get S-ratings on every stage, and I am very happy to see the ""restart from checkpoint"" option which allows you to restart from the current checkpoint you are on if you know you are not going to get an S-rating. Or you can choose the previous checkpoint if you didn't realise you missed a note and need to go back.

One complaint I have is that it is [u] very [/u] hard to make out what's happening when you thump a ""super note"" from the air, or when you take damage as the color saturation on screen bump up to 1000% when either of these two things happen.",1560172089,1560172089,True,8,0,0.620741486549377441,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's like Groove Coaster but nothing makes sense. I'm at level 3 now and I have so many questions built up and unanswered, I can't even focus on the game itself anymore.

The blocks that I press A on, let's just call them blocks, why are they sometimes green and sometimes blue? I noticed that blocks tend to be more green when I'm fighting a boss, but then blue blocks also appear in these sections, so are they different? Should I care?

Some blocks glow more than others do, let's call them glowing blocks. I noticed that green glowing blocks launch an attack to whatever I'm fighting, and blue glowing blocks often mark the end of levels, but then the same blue glowing blocks also occasionally appear in the middle of levels, among non-glowing blocks. What does the glow mean exactly?

The blue rings. If I hold up and A, my avatar - I assume it's THE thumper - crashes through them and makes a sound effect. If I do nothing, my thumper goes through the rings without getting hurt. Should I just ignore the rings then? What purpose do they serve?

I sometimes see blue little gems to the top-left and top-right of my thumper. Sometimes they just float there, sometimes they get absorbed by my thumper. What are they? What do they do? Are they related to the blue gem counter at the end of levels? Should I get more of them? How do I get more of them?

I sometimes see ""1x"", ""2x"" and ""3x"" on the right side. It tends to go up as I play but drops back to ""1x"" when I miss something. What is it? Is it good when it says ""2x"" or ""3x""? How exactly do I make it ""2x"" or ""3x""?

The blocks, I press A on them, level 1 told me that. But then level 3 begins and it says nope, that's wrong, actually you should press down on them, and it sends some sort of a shockwave. You need to do that to unlock the lock-ish things that block bosses at times. But it's the same block. So there are 2 ways to deal with a block now? Should I press A or press down? Should I press down when there are locks but press A on other occasions?",1559533298,1559544349,False,2,2,0.400417327880859375,0,True,False,False,False,,1561143204.0,"Hey!

Wonderfully dark industrial tribal drum & bass tracks that reek of atmosphere, amplified by the haunting psychedelic imagery. Rock-solid graphic performance; I have never experienced anything but buttery smooth perfection.

Starts with baby steps and ramps up to blistering mania. Rhythm sections progressively build into more and more complex structures that always seem to maintain an element of organic uncertainty, yet can absolutely be memorized.

Routine checkpoint system with fair scoring. If you find this too managable, there's an extra level of difficulty added with the free 'Director's Cut' update, challenging you to complete entire levels (nine of them, ranging from 10 to 25 minutes), at even higher potential speeds, without exploding (permadeath).

Deceptively simple, razor sharp, delightfully intuitive controls. Subtlety hidden gameplay mechanics taught by suggestion rather than explanation (""I must be missing something, what if I try... oh, snap!""). I agree with the recommendation to play with a gamepad. 

Take care not to blame the game for the sake of your own ego. They call this Rhythm Violence for good reason :D Enjoy.",1559430704,1559430704,True,9,0,0.632695555686950684,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The relief and adrenaline rush of getting through a tough part of a level can feel on par with beating a tough boss in Soulsborne games.

It is one of the few games I've played where I actually have to sit back a little and breathe - that's even without VR.. 

The visuals, mixed with the simple, but engaging gameplay that leads to some fun thumb gymnastics or the ability to keep it simple and less stressful combine to make a game that's fun and as challenging as you want it to be. Although I don't usually care about scores, Thumper made me want to try off combos and hit every beat(?) until I was frustrated and had to go on knowing I wasn't ready.

After a complete play-through though, it's really cool to see the tricks and timing I was forced to pull off and could pull off which makes running back through my missed opportunities and stages for S rankings. 

The best part about Thumper? If you aren't great at rhythm games it doesn't really matter. You can hop in for the 4-8 hours of tight gameplay it offers, get sucked in like me and because of the ""Action"" aspect, not need to time as much as be reactionary or learn the stage's pattern.

My only complaints lie in the difficulty in seeing obstacles at points with how things meshed against the level design as well as gimmicky bits that you can't see coming and almost certainly will lose a few runs until you memorize the pattern.

I loved this experience and hope to see more innovation like Thumper in the Rhythm genre.

I'm shocked there's no casual mode that removes death and lets me get into a flow without restarting every time some weird rhythm or hidden obstacle kills me. Seems like an easy win for accessibility.

This is one of my all time favorite VR games. A VR essential everyone should have. I play a lot of VR games and this one is one of the few that I consistently keep going back to play. It is an older style front facing VR game that requires a game-pad but do not let deter you. This game is amazing and still holds up today. I can spend hours zoning out in this fast paced beautiful world. 

====Issues/Suggestions for improvement====
Game runs smoothly. 0 issues to report 
Is there a Thumper 2 in the future?

====Game Mechanics/Physics====
New mechanics are added gradually every level so as not to overwhelm you but the game really shines once all the game elements are in use. Levels 6-9 I don't think I will ever get sick of replaying.
Tip: If your having trouble with the down smash mechanic introduced in level 5. Try using the d-pad instead of the joystick on your game pad.

====Replay-ability====
Just getting though the levels is one thing. Getting though the levels with a score of S is a challenge. This game has leader boards for those up to the challenge.

Not into the added challenge? This game is fun to just site back, relax and play though a level or two at a time. For me it's been the perfect break game from whatever active VR game I'm stuck on at the time.

====Graphics====
Visually breathtaking and beautiful. I've missed many turns and jumps being detracted by the visuals all around me. 

====Play length====
9 Levels with 20-30 sections each. It takes about 20 to 30 mins per level if you've gotten good enough to play though without dying much. My initial play-though on PSVR took several months to beat. Good amount of content here.

====Physical Activity Level====
0 - Sit down and relax with a gamepad

====Worth buying?====
This game is worth every penny and then some of it's $20 asking price. I've paid full price twice (PSVR and Steam) for this game and have no regrets.",1549648281,1549648281,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The music matches the beat and when it does not, it is INTENTIONAL. Upcoming thumps, turns, rings etc. have specific sounds, letting you know that they are coming up and help with blind corners. The beat of the song actually speeds up and slows down sometimes, causing desynchronization and adding to that sense of dread building as you make your way through a level.

If you are bored, then you obviously haven't made it through very many levels. I say this because each one has its own theme/song. Each stage adds a little bit more, slowly teaching you how to traverse the track until you are able to go back and earn that S rank.

Once you think you have a good grasp of the game, here comes level 5 and teaches you that you've been playing like a toddler the entire time. No I don't mean the speed at which your're traveling or the frequency of maneuvers needed to barely survive. I'll just say that you'll need to go back and play levels 1-4 but use Perfect Turning/flight to combo into your ground slams to get that score up.

The visuals and beats are great with the exception of the recycled skull boss theme. That's just a visual though and doesn't have anything to do with the variety of boss fight mechanics.

For those of you complaining that it takes memorization to make progress, I will not disagree.

Very simply presented, yes, as you are a techo-sentient beetle of sorts riding along this resplendent, winding, metallic track - Everything appears hypervivid, simultaneously exploding visions of sublime wonder and chaotic turmoil, being led at nearly impossible speed through unrelenting danger, a hair's edge away from oblivion. So yeah, pretty sick concept and its execution is done to, in my opinion, actual perfection. Running into a game like Thumper is quite a treat, I must say. The gameplay can be challenging to the point of frustration, but does reward diligence and concentration, so I have nothing negative to say about its overall design.

The visuals are neat and the core gameplay is good but the things that let it down IMO are; the actions often dont sync with the tune which is kind of a big deal in a ""rhythm"" game, during the harder times I had to do my best to ignore the sound track and focus on my actions to provide a beat I could play with. 
The second thing is, for a game that for the most part has a very clean simplistic visual appearance there are certain things that add way to much clutter to the screen at the wrong times, like mess up once and they basically blind you, if it happens to be during a complicated portion of the path good luck trying to recover, same for the over charge thing that happens once in a while.
A more minor gripe is that its just the same background track throughout the game (or at least close enough to it that I didn't notice a difference), it would have been nice to have some variation.

Thumper is a different type of rhythm game. If anything, it feels more like a fighting game with the level of concentration, execution, adrenaline, and reflexes it demands. When the tribal stomping and surreal visuals awaken a part of the human psyche that‚Äôs ready to deliver on those demands, Thumper becomes a roller coaster.

The soundscape is terrifying. Each level runs in a different time signature which makes for some uncommon sounds. New obstacles feed into the noise as the ‚Äòorchestra‚Äô grows in both size and challenge.

Upon becoming more confident with ‚Äòflying/thumping‚Äô, levels open up and the game loses part of its ‚Äòcall-and-response‚Äô rigidity. The risk/reward in going for points/health requires another channel of thought that enhances your involvement. Like an instrument, you pick up intricacies as you progress.

The game could do without the occasion deafening BGM listen-skill-gates, blinding damage animation, and those out-of-place and repetitive ‚Äòsnakes‚Äô that add nothing to the music and little to the gameplay.

There are only nine levels in the game. While that‚Äôs certainly enough (trust me), it means there‚Äôs no quick way to practice when you‚Äôre stuck since your only option is to dive back into the [i]start[/i] of a previous level. NG+ is an alright extra, but imagine what a procedurally generated ‚Äòendless‚Äô mode would do for replayability.

Thumper is addictively hard to put down. Whenever I revisit the game, I usually lose the afternoon and end up going to bed with mangled thumbs.

[i]It should be noted that the game works exceptionally well in VR: 3D visuals, 360-degree audio, 90 Hertz display, and quick response time. [/i]",1547530887,1547530887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Thumper is a rhythm game where you're a bug travelling along a track to dramatic, percussive music. All of your movements sync perfectly with the song, and it feels like you're the one orchestrating the whole thing.
In VR, you really feel the speed of the track, although not in a motion-sickness way. It just all feels very frantic as you hit the input at the last second. That's the reason why this game is so good. I expected to be bored after a few worlds without any new main mechanics, but surprisiingly, It never felt dull because of the feel of the game. 

Now, the story in Thumper is fairly nonexistent, you may piece something small together but probably not. Where the game really stood out is in the boss fights. A giant pyramid appears, and then you start travelling in a seemingly infinite downward curve. Then, the boss slowly comes into view, looming over top of you. All of the bosses are variations of each other, except one, that get increasingly disturbing as the game progresses. By the end I was absolutely terrified as it came into view. The final boss isn't scary, per se, but it introduces a fresh new mechanic that feels really slick, and builds on it until you beat it at its own game.

Scary rhythm game with spooky music and really enjoyable core gameplay. Don't play right before ging to sleep.",1547436258,1547436258,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Could be a lot of things‚Ä¶ could be beating people up to the beat, could be clobbering clods with a musical instrument, could be composing a song whose notes cause agony. In Thumper, ‚Äúrhythm violence‚Äù refers to the intensity of the action set to absolutely crushing beats, a brutal combination of high-speed maneuvers and pounding music. It‚Äôs a rare title that outstrips the expectations set by such a high-minded presentation, and it manages to pack in just enough challenge and content to make the battle worth it.

I‚Äôm just going to pull from the game‚Äôs own description here: ‚ÄúYou are a space beetle. Brave the hellish void and confront a maniacal giant head from the future.‚Äù That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs all the plot you get. Thumper has you controlling said space beetle down a nigh-endless track twisting in the nether. The track itself seems to be alive, pulsating with fractal appendages and blistering with spikes. Blasting through the many obstacles along the way will get you to the boss of each level, an evolving skull that seeks to expunge you from the trail. Keeping up with the beat will help you beat him and the mini-bosses you encounter along the way, but each of the nine levels is going to make it harder and harder to hang with the rhythm.

The controls are quite simple, but the moves you‚Äôre expected to pull off with them can become flabbergasting by the finale. You have one button and one stick, and the button triggers panels on the track when pressed and gives you the power to bust through barriers when held. You‚Äôll also need to hold it when you drift along walls, along with the direction you‚Äôre drifting in. You can launch off of panels into the air, and slam back down to clear certain obstacles. All of these mechanics are introduced gradually over the levels, including some more complex ones I didn‚Äôt mention, so the ramp-up of concepts is at least quite manageable. Your beetle is also armored enough to take a hit and keep going, and there are ways to get that free hit back during levels.

Your only real objective is to survive the level, which is usually broken down to twenty or so checkpointed segments. It‚Äôs not too tricky to dodge or drift through everything, at least at first, but you‚Äôre going to want to be hitting all the panels and blowing through all the rings and spikes for points, just to prove your worth in this mad race. There‚Äôs a combo system based on not missing obstacles and chaining jumps and slams together, and once you work out the basics you can add significant flourish to your runs for big points. The score aspect is an important part of the replay value here, since the nine levels are essentially static.

That‚Äôs not much of a knock against the game, considering the content of the levels. On every leg of your journey you‚Äôll have the pulse-pounding soundtrack in your ear, and the spectacle of your space beetle tearing along at impossible speed. The game often feels like Burnout with permanent boost, a barely-controllable rocket of destruction. But you have to control it, and careful reactions are crucial for helping you grind along deadly walls and smash through glowing spikes. Between the undulating background, the intense flashes and explosions of navigating, and the thunderous music that‚Äôs partly produced by your actions, you‚Äôre sure to find yourself utterly focused on your brutal task until your brain fatigues too much to keep up with it.

Thumper is not an easy game, pushing you to the limits of your reflexes by the madcap final level. But conquering its challenges is so, so sweet, accompanied by bursts of sound and color and the accolades of the beat rolling on. It‚Äôs an easy game to pick up, but depending on your skill level it could take anywhere from five hours to a dozen to work your way through. And there‚Äôs even a hard mode that ups the intensity to inconceivable levels and gives you a single life to survive each marathon level with. This is an absolute no-brainer for fans of rhythm games, and lovers of intense action and even some horror fans will find a lot to appreciate in its presentation.

if you have any form of motion sickness than this game hurts. I personally dont have terrible motion sickness, but playing it with a headach gives the same feeling.

A rhythm game, but you have to ignore the music?

I think this is probably going to come off as a butthurt review because I need to 'git gud' at this hard game. I love rhythm games and I love hard games - when they are fair. When I play Cuphead or Meatboy or Dark Souls and I die, I can go 'oh damn, I was supposed to be doing that and I wasn't'. In Thumper, you will press what you are positive are the right buttons at the right times, and you will die over and over. It will not be clear what you are doing wrong. Then you get to do the whole level again. Mess up at the same spot again because you still don't understand why the rhythm is wrong? Guess what start again and you've got the whole level to worry about that split second you get to try and work out why you went wrong. The game sucks when you are not doing well. I think the music is actually UNhelpful. When I've had stretches doing well and hitting the beats, and kind of get into it and the music, then I always end up messing up. You have to listen for the ting of the bits you've got to hit, not the actual music.

Also, if the deaths were like Hotline Miami (another game I love) where you're just up and doing straight away, then that would be fine. You can play through the fun part of the level up to where you died and try and work out the mistake - go in slower, scout it out, try a different approach. But not in Thumper. Black screen and slow slow restart into the level again, and you're desperately trying to make sure you ace the level and keep your health so you can maybe just power through the part you went wrong. A lot of the deaths feel very cheap too. I don't know if it's my eyesight (I have astigmatism) but it was almost impossible to see the corners in the tunnels - especially if in quick succession. Now I just press the opposite arrow after every corner just in case. At least you're not punished for that.

First off, the rythm of the music doesn't always align with the actual button pressing you're doing, which can be extremely obnoxious/disorienting. Even having the beats one second separated from what you're doing can ruin your rythm. Due to this I eventually took to playing muted. It was easier to judge the pattern based off of the vibrations of the controller and the visuals alone, as the music ultimately became a distraction.

You can imagine how bad of a problem this is for a fast-paced rythm game.

Worsening things is the (unintended?) penalty for taking damage. You can take two hits; one that destroys your shell and one that then kills you. The first hit that you take also 1) clouds the screen with some debris  2) tints everything red and  3) slows the game down for a few moments. The overall effect is that it becomes extremely hard to see what you need to press next and your rythm is completely ruined by the sudden slow-mo. This means that one hit often becomes two right away, killing you almost instantly. This is in spite of a brief period of invulnerabilty, which goes away faster than the visual effects do. Some levels in the late game more or less require perfect runs because of this, as the moment you take your first hit you're blinded and at the mercy of whatever hazards were right ahead.

Ultimately, these two flaws alone are fatal for a lightning quick rythm game. They really hold back what was an otherwise compelling experience.

you take on the role of a metallic beetle, which is blazing fast and runs on a track which twists and turns when you play the music according to what you hear. but this is ""rhythm violence"" so you're the anti-christ, the bringer of death with the game doing all in its power to stop you.

eerie, scary soundtrack which will keep you on your toes and will make you feel powerful at the same time, there was one time in the boss fights where the beat becomes so good it's the symphony of a real battle.

Thumper, while it has the visual appearance of an on-rails racing game, is at its core a rhythm game, much like Audiosurf. As a consequence, the game flows excellently and benefits from precisely tuned level design and mechanics; as of yet I have not seen anything that even approaches a bug in the gameplay or a defect in the visuals. On the other hand, however, audio cues are absolutely vital to gameplay, and I can imagine that it would be nearly impossible to play higher levels with the sound turned off.

Each level that you progress through will introduce new movement mechanics and musical motifs, making a very gradual rise in difficulty that thankfully avoids spikes and frustrating stages. A few of the movements, like slams, are extremely precise and are difficult to do if using a joystick, but they are thankfully rare and only really become a problem in bossfights.

Overall, the game is really well designed and relatively short to get through, and while I don't see it as having much replay value due to its nature as a rhythm game with no ability to play new stages once you've completed it all, I think the experience of the first playthrough alone is plenty fun enough for the price.",1543007573,1543103091,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What am I even saying anymore? The game is great. It really gives you a creppy atmosphere rhythm games don't usually have.

I haven't tried all levels yet, I'm on level 6 of 9, each levelis divided in a bunch of part with checkpoints in between, so that should entertain you for a bit. Haven't heard that much variety when it comes to music scores though, but I still find the overall music tracks very satisfying to play!

Everything, lost behind you. [...] Amazing. Freedom and death, right there, right there, razor's edge, forever."" - Excerpt from The Winter Market, by William Gibson.

Thumper's not quite that visceral. But it certainly is angry. It throws you down that cold steel track at a million miles an hour, and plays its rhythm on the devil's own drumset. You clang off of corners like a pinball, a sharp metal on metal sound as your shell sends sparks into the nothingness. Smash through a barrier like a hammer through bone. Leap a set of spikes and slam down on the far end, sending a rippling shockwave along the track that makes the tendrils that grow there scream and wither...

Something I quite like about the score grading system here is that it allows for various levels of play: the newcomer, who holds down A and prays as they're violently smacked into the walls, but still comes out alive (this was me, when the speed and difficulty started ramping up around level 5 or so), the adept, who is willing to actually play to the beat and try for some cool scores, the arcade heroes, who are out for that highscore spot and pull off crazy back to back perfect turns and smashes and mid-air clangs off of the guardrails... I don't think I've ever gripped my controller quite as tight as in those moments of pure stunt trickery.

It's a wonderful and terrifying experience. Some of the levels might feel dragged out at times, but it makes for a better learning curve. There might not be enough mechanics for some among you, but I think the relative simplicity lets Thumper focus on what it already has. Mastery and highscores will keep the content-hungry satiated. If you're of strong will and a hellish attitude, buy it.",1542773054,1542773054,True,6,0,0.60707700252532959,0,True,False,False,False,,,

And it wasn't a case of just 'I didn't like it as much as I thought I would', I REALLY didn't like it. I'm surprised by how overrated this game is, perhaps its the novelty factor?

First of all, I expected the gameplay actions to be synced with the music, this being a preset thing and all. This is barely the case - sure there is a degree of syncronisation between the actions and music but there are a lot of random actions that don't feel lined up with the soundtrack in any significant way. Far too often I had to memorise and time my actions while trying to ignore the music, because it would throw me off when I based my timing on the musical beat.

As far as the music goes, what you hear in the trailer is pretty much all you're gonna hear. Lots of quiet droning parts too. I actually listen to a fair bit of drone music, but there is definitely a limit as to how much of that fits in a rythm game. The music gets very boring very quickly. The gameplay actions are boring. The visuals are novel but also get very boring. All round... a very boring game, I'm sad to say. 

If you're here for the music, you're better off just sticking to Audiosurf, which has lots of different game modes and you can choose your own music. If you're here for gameplay... I can't actually think of many recommendations but I would personally also go to Audiosurf. It definitely isn't perfect as far as rythm syncing goes, but it often does a very good job of matching game speed to the differently paced parts of a song, and the track undulations do a much better job of making you 'feel' the music than Thumper does. If you're here for the visuals, just watch some gameplay videos until you get bored.

Its a no from me for Thumper, unfortunately.",1540617592,1540617623,False,16,0,0.571797847747802734,12,True,False,False,False,,,

VISUALS: A wonderous, nightmarish acid trip with some nice non-euclidian stuff going on. Play it in VR if you can.
CONTROLS: You literally only use the left analog stick and either A/X or RB/R1. That's it. Somehow this still feels like a lot to keep track of when you're playing.
GAMEPLAY: This is one of those games where you know with certainty, every time you die, that it was your fault. It's so incredibly responsive, and every action you take gives you clear feedback.
SOUNDTRACK: I never knew I wanted a rhythm game with a noise rock/ambient electronic soundtrack, but here we are, and it's stunning.
SOUND DESIGN: The incidental sounds of this game are actually part of the sountrack, almost more so than the music itself. Slamming down on a final note in a boss battle feels like something from Lethal League, with a massive riser emphasising the hit lag before the shot goes rocketing down the track.

J'ai pass√© un excellent moment sur Thumper.

Petit jeu de rythme assez particulier, Thumper est dot√© d‚Äôune personnalit√© vraiment forte : Thumper est sombre, Thumper est violent, Thumper est jouissif.

Alors bien entendu, on ne parle pas de violence √† base de meurtres et de sang, mais de rythme, de percussions, de sonorit√©s et de vitesse.

Je vous invite vraiment √† regarder le trailer qui donne tr√®s bien le ton. Le joueur incarne ici un scarab√©e qui suit un rail et devra valider tout un tas d‚Äôobstacles pour ne pas y laisser sa carapace.
Artistiquement, c‚Äôest √† la fois intense et fascinant. C'est ""juste"" un jeu de rythme, mais dans le genre il se d√©brouille tr√®s bien, virant parfois √† l‚Äôhypnotique tellement passer les obstacles devient au bout d‚Äôun moment un r√©flexe animal, captur√© que l‚Äôon est par ces sonorit√©s √† base de drums et d'ambiances √©lectroniques inqui√©tantes, tandis que de leur c√¥t√© les interactions du joueur prennent la forme de bruitages tr√®s violents qui donnent un peps fou √† l‚Äôensemble. Comment ne pas devenir addict devant une telle proposition ?

Les obstacles consistent √† activer des pastilles bleues, prendre activement des virages, faire des sauts, √©viter des obstacles, atterrir sur des points pr√©cis‚Ä¶ 
Bien entendu, chaque obstacle r√©pond √† un mouvement cl√© : action + cot√©, action + saut, bas‚Ä¶ Rien de bien compliqu√© sur le papier et c‚Äôest tant mieux : un gameplay accessible √† tout un chacun sera toujours un atout.
Apr√®s, c‚Äôest la mani√®re dont le jeu va demander de sortir ces actions qui va faire tout le sel de la partie. Si le d√©but est plut√¥t simple, vous comprendrez petit √† petit que plus on avance, plus les enchainements se font fourbes, et plus la vitesse du scarab√©e augmente. En r√©sulte un gameplay devenant tr√®s exigeant voire technique, malgr√© sa simplicit√© de prise en main. En un mot, le cocktail parfait. 

Le jeu est structur√© en 9 mondes, chaque monde contenant entre 15 et 30 niveaux (= checkpoints) et √©tant ponctu√© de quelques mid-boss et d‚Äôun boss final. Les boss demandent √† √™tre √©limin√©s en leur balan√ßant 4 ondes de choc, correspondant √† autant de s√©quences. Chaque onde ne peut sortir qu'√† la condition de faire un perfect sur ladite s√©quence. Si sur les niveaux normaux les pastilles sont bleues, chez les boss elles sont vertes. Tant que les pastilles √† d√©gommer restent vertes, c‚Äôest qu‚Äôil n‚Äôy a pas d‚Äôerreur. Si les pastilles deviennent bleues, c'est qu‚Äôune pastille a √©t√© rat√©e, et donc la s√©quence enti√®re sera √† refaire et tournera en boucle jusqu'√† ce que le joueur y arrive. Si on y arrive du premier coup, une pastille bonus redonnera un bouclier s‚Äôil est perdu.
Pour les mondes normaux, louper une pastille ne sera pas grave (√† part pour le combo et pour le score, bien √©videmment) : √ßa n‚Äôemp√™chera pas de finir le niveau.
Bref √ßa a l‚Äôair compliqu√© dit comme √ßa, mais c‚Äôest super sympa √† jouer manette en main.

Une fois les 9 mondes boucl√©s, il existe √©galement un New Game + pour faire durer le plaisir, mais il reste accessoire : 0 checkpoint, r√©cup√©ration de son bouclier perdu possible seulement au multiplicateur maximal (qui passe pour l‚Äôoccasion de x3 √† x4), etc.

En comptant principalement le jeu de base + un chouilla de NG+, je me suis occup√© dessus 45h, ce qui est loin d‚Äô√™tre n√©gligeable.

Apr√®s le jeu n‚Äôen est pas parfait pour autant. 

Le principal reproche que l‚Äôon pourrait lui faire est celui d‚Äôune certaine confusion sur sa mani√®re de communiquer avec le joueur. Personnellement j‚Äôai accroch√© donc je me suis investi et j‚Äôai fini par tout comprendre √† la longue, mais pour un nouveau venu qui joue √† la cool, il peut exister quelques obstacles :
- Les r√®gles pour commencer, qui ne sont pas forc√©ment tr√®s claires les premi√®res fois que l'on tombe dessus. Certains patterns peuvent faire paniquer et hurler au hasard alors qu‚Äôen fait, il y a toujours une solution. Par exemple, un pattern oblige √† prendre les virages √† la derni√®re microseconde pour se valider, et un son -discret- indique lorsque c'est OK : √ßa personne ne le dit, il faut t√¢tonner pour le comprendre ;
- De la m√™me mani√®re, ces virages pris √† la derni√®re seconde jouent √©galement sur le score. C‚Äôest en d√©couvrant que je pouvais atteindre le grade S+ (au-dessus de S, donc) juste en jouant dessus que j‚Äôai d√©couvert √ßa ;
- Quelques soucis de lisibilit√© √©galement dans certains tunnels ou d√©nivel√©s (surtout dans les derniers mondes o√π √ßa va tr√®s vite), n√©cessitant de pas mal connaitre le niveau pour anticiper les points critiques. Mais apr√®s √ßa, c'est tous les jeux j'ai envie de dire ;
- J‚Äôai not√© un pattern compl√®tement sous exploit√©. Pour bien comprendre, √† chaque nouveau monde le jeu nous instruit sur des nouvelles m√©caniques afin de pouvoir les placer √† l‚Äôenvi sur toute la suite de la partie. Sauf pour le vol long : on gal√®re pour l‚Äôapprendre (oui car encore une fois le tutoriel ici n‚Äôest pas d‚Äôune limpidit√© exemplaire), on est ravi quand enfin on le maitrise puis‚Ä¶ plus rien. De tout le jeu. Ca sent l‚Äôid√©e impl√©ment√©e √† la derni√®re minute mais sans suite sur le produit fini (manque de temps ?). 

Enfin, pour √™tre tout √† fait complet et objectif, petit b√©mol sur le manque de vari√©t√© concernant l'ambiance visuelle. Une atmosph√®re psych√©d√©lique et abstraite pourquoi pas, mais √ßa tourne un peu en rond de ce c√¥t√©, c'est dommage. Je pense qu‚Äôon pouvait rester dans le th√®me tout en explorant des choses nouvelles par monde.
Et c‚Äôest un peu le m√™me discours cot√© sonore. Sans aller jusqu‚Äô√† r√©clamer forc√©ment une musique digne de ce nom, mais au moins s‚Äôil pouvait exister une ambiance sonore plus appuy√©e, comme le jeu sait pourtant en offrir parfois (mais trop rarement), rendant ces moments d‚Äôautant plus exceptionnels.

Bref je ne suis pas tr√®s rythm-games, mais malgr√© ses petits couacs celui-ci m'a bien plu, de par ses sensations in√©dites, sa tr√®s forte personnalit√© et le r√©el sentiment de satisfaction lorsqu‚Äôon r√©ussit un run parfait.

Definitely would recommend a stereo system with good bass capabilities or a quality headset for full audio immersion.

Great replay value across all 9 stages. S rank is already quite tough, and then doing S+ in the Play+ mode is even harder. there's always room for improvement. Try for high scores on the online leaderboards too!

I recommend this for people who not only enjoy rhythm games but also game that dont mess around and punish you for mistake while also rewarding you for trying harder. Finishing each level and hitting every note feels so good as the the music beats along to each button you press or move you make from side to side or up and down. Everything flows perfectly.

 I would highly recommend a controller because the movements you make are very similar and I personally would think doing the, on a keyboard would start to get uncomfortable.",1539507502,1539507502,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Using a controller, the only buttons you need are the left stick and the A button. The entire game is played with two buttons as you travel at blazing speeds trying to avoid obstacles as a ""Space Beetle""

+ The gameplay is AMAZING. If you are looking for a sense of speed, this game will give you the adrenaline rush this is the game for you!
+ Incredible abstract ""visualizations""  that create a wonderful abstract journey.
+ Challenging, as you progress new mechanics are introduces relying on you to make split second decisions. It can be frustrating at times, but oh so rewarding when you complete a segment.
+ Great soundtrack that is in sync with the obsctacles in the game which sounds great! 
+ Leaderboards that may increase replaybility

Thumper is a surreal rhythm game for the Rift and Vive, by developer drool. This is also a pancake game, but as always I‚Äôm gonna be critiquing from the point of view of its VR adaptation.

So as indie gems go, you might have overlooked Thumper, or possibly even seen it but passed over it due to not knowing what the hell the game is actually about. Well let me clarify that for you; You play a metallic beetle ripping through some god-forsaken hellish void, trying to overcome a groundhog day style purgatory by completing a series of violent rhythmic beats to a hellish soundscape, whilst some maniacal and abstract godlike entities intimidate you throughout the process.

Are you weirded out? Because this game is fucking weird. Thumper is one of the most bizarre concepts I‚Äôve come across in VR, and even more bizarre by the fact that it‚Äôs actually executed extremely well. The maddest thing is that it‚Äôs so simple; You play with one button. Yes, just one button, A, and the thumbstick. As obstacles come down the track, the player must overcome them by timing the relevant action perfectly that involves some combination of the thumbstick and A. And that‚Äôs it.

Stripping off all the oddity, it‚Äôs a memory and rhythm game at its heart, but that oddity is not so easily removed as it is so integral to the effectiveness of the game. The driving force, the music, can hardly even be called music; It‚Äôs more like a collection of weird sounds that beat to a rhythm. And yes, I realize this is an oxymoron but it‚Äôs kind analogous to this game; A complex and thought provoking rhythm game with an outlandishly simple execution. Though lacking the familiarity of traditional music, the soundtrack is fantastically effective, creating an aggressive and violent soundscape, whilst the player‚Äôs successfully timed hits create noise that contribute seamlessly to the soundtrack.

Even though the game is always forward facing, the VR element of the game is excellent. Being immersed in the environment gives a great sense of speed and intensity, and the voidscape itself is both beautiful and dreadful, like an abstract painting.

Folks who I think will not enjoy Thumper are those who are expecting a more traditional rhythm game, or enjoy playing to the beat of more familiar music. It‚Äôs also not a game for the easily frustrated, as this game is hard and unapologetic about it. The game usually retails for $20 but I‚Äôve often seen it drop to $5, which is a steal. So, if you‚Äôve been looking for a game that includes tearing through timespace, metallic beetles and existential dread, finally, here‚Äôs a game for you.",1539302510,1539302510,True,4,0,0.554437994956970215,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Wooow with the feeling of a Tron like world, with ones head strapped down on the nose cone of some sort of beetle craft you have the induced experience of the brain going into hyperdrive. 

I love this game, it's you on this twisty alien like construct that resembles some sort of track that seems alive and relentless. The music track this game is fueled on really spurs the imagination and with its tempo and weird tones makes for a even better experience.

This is about quick reflexes, steady concentration it will provide a simple yet compelling game.

For a VR experience its unique and well worth it, I had no feeling of nausea either which did pleasantly surprise me considering how fast the game plays at. Has about 12 levels split into sub levels.. There is enough to keep you coming back and retrying to better your performance.

All we need now is for this to become a music induced experience, supply us with an editor and we would probably have one the best visual music games (Beat Saber pretty damn good ) on the market for VR. 

We can but pray... :)

Go into this game knowing what (quite literal) hell you're in for, and it'll be even more fun when you've finished. Thumper is one of those games that's hard to really put into words that make it sound spectacular. It's just like any other rhythm game, but it's also not. In favor of honing your skills and practicing songs in a relaxing and low-stress environment, Thumper turns what makes a rhythm game casual into what can make a rhythm game downright terrifying in multiple different ways.

You play as a little beetle with two hit points, running down an endless track separated by levels. You hit beatpads (beats), make turns, fly over obsticals and into rings to gain points. Missing turns, running into obsticals, or encountering other hazards will make you take damage. Two hits, and you start the track/level over. There are ""boss fights"" you encounter through each set of levels, requiring you to perfectly complete the level's stages to deal damage to the boss. All the while, you're introduced to new mechanics, new rhythms, new hazards, and new ways to realize Thumper will be the death of you.

This game will start you off gently, giving you a few beat pads and turns to hit, satisfying your curiousity for what you have coming. New mechanics are introduced, the rhythm changes pattern and pace Similar to the old tale of boiling a frog in water, suddenly you realize the game has gotten so hard you don't know if you can beat it anymore. You're far enough into it though, that putting it down at this point will feel like a waste and you're [i]just so close to that ending[/i]. By the time you do get to the ending, when you're face to face with the final boss, yet again a new mechanic is introduced that you have to learn while you cry out over and over again with each failure. Thumper is the embodiment of a casual rage game, and how it feels to slowly become a masochist.

In all seriousness, Thumper is a great rhythm game and accomplishes being a unique addition to the genre. It does start out quite slow and easy, gradually ramping the difficulty up to near impossible levels. The music, while nice to listen to and somewhat interesting when you first hear it, didn't really help me hit the beats like it should've been doing. This leaves you to somewhat fend for yourself and learn as you go, rather than having a crutch to work off of. The music playing in each level felt more like a background track to a rhythm you had to come up with on your own via trial and error rather than music that provided you with a template to hit beats off of. The beats do have unique audio cues, but the rather unhelpful music hides most of them, and you really have to listen, watch, or both in order to hit the beats correctly. For some people this is a great thing, and for others it may turn them away from the game completely. Put simply, this is what makes the game so difficult.

My biggest issues with Thumper are many small points that add up to one glaring issue. Overall I felt like the pairing of the music to the beats could've been done much better, which for a rhythm game is really important. A lot of the gameplay involved very bright, flashy visuals that distracted and sometimes even covered upcoming beats, causing me to lose track of what was coming and take damage I would've otherwise avoided. As I mentioned in the last section, you can't hear the cue for the beats, because of the music that doesn't help you in the first place. At times, my controller just wouldn't respond to all the inputs I had to layer on. The lineup of hazards and beats would be going by so fast that trying to turn or shift lanes just wouldn't respond because there were so many other things being input. Each of these small points add up to a major problem, creating difficulty not just because you may be bad at the game, but because the game is working against you to make it harder. Making a game like Thumper difficult didn't need these extra steps, a lot of the levels are already difficult as they are. However, even with all these parts of the game working against me, even I (who has never played a real rhyhtm game before) could beat Thumper with minimal issue - just a lot of frustration.

If you don't mind a rhythm game that will make you rage a little bit, try Thumper. If you like to challenge yourself and want something casual to do it with, this is your game. While advertised as horror, it's more of a rhythm rage game - though I could see it being ""scary"" with a VR set. Even for it's flaws it's still a unique experience that makes you feel amazing for completing it, and gives a strong sense of accomplishment knowing practice paid off.",1539225283,1539225283,True,3,0,0.553249120712280273,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The audio is a mess. There is one Master volume slider. The problem you have with that for this game is there are a lot of different types of sound and the mixing is garbage. The music feels way to slow half the time because there's a suprising amount of sleepy time Drone that the trailer and most reviews never mention. The noises your beetle make for doing something good drowns out everything. Audio cues get drowned out by everything (honestly that doesn't matter because this game is more about remembering the course since when to do a thing is so disconnected from the Music you can literally play on mute and lose nothing because this is not a rhythem game)

To me a Rhythem game is when the music and when to do an action feel connected, and in a really good Rhythm game you feel like you could be blind and pull it all off because the sync between what you're doing and what you're hearing feels so damn good. This is not that game. 

By an hour and a half I was just tired of ""racing"", aka just rembering a course, over bedtime music with almost no sync all while not hearing audios ques and dreading to do perfect turns because the chime was so damn loud and happy.

It gets legitimately difficult, especially if you are trying to keep up combos (instead of ""just surviving""). Later stages will frequently put you in twisting tunnels that give you very little time to react visually to what is approaching, so you'll benefit to listening to the sounds each obstacle makes as it activates a certain distance away.

The game is forgiving in the sense that death only resets you to the last checkpoint (which are around a minute long each) but not in the sense that it makes the section you're dying on much easier. There were a couple sections I had to take 5-10 tries at.

To enjoy (and beat) Thumper you will need:
‚Ä¢ A standard-style game controller
‚Ä¢ Quite high reaction speed
‚Ä¢ Ability to quickly pick up on rhythms and audio queues
‚Ä¢ Ability to focus through many overlapping visual effects
‚Ä¢ Patience, if you are lacking any of these

The beginning levels of the game do a wonderful job teaching you the basics- its a classic example of difficulty increasing with player skill. For me, it never was too boring, predictive or easy, as each session I had with Thumper was always thrilling and rewarding. At no point was it so difficult to the point where I was frustrated or stuck for long- nor did I ever feel as if the game was too unfair. It was perfectly balanced in terms of difficulty throughout the levels, and it had many checkpoints so you could go back and try again without wasting your time. 
The art is abstract, and makes you wonder about what hidden meaning there is with the bosses (the heads, and the final boss of level 9). There were times where the music along with the visuals and colours made me feel anxious, at awe, dread or eerie (for example before you fight a boss), and  I absolutely love how the developers were able to convey such strong emotions from me. The colours while beautiful can understandably distract players from being able to see the notes/turns, however its definitely not a game breaker and after getting used to the visuals, you'll be able to make out the notes and turns with specific animations and audio queues. The game's ending is honestly the most satisfying experience I have had in a rhythm game- most likely due to it's strong emotional nature. 
For anyone who is interested in playing the game, please keep in mind that a controller is most ideal. Playing with a keyboard is pretty much impossible after level 4 (trust me I tried). Also keep in mind that each checkpoint can fluctuate with difficulty (for example level 5.5 is slightly harder then level 5.6). If you are unable to beat a level checkpoint and are beginning to get frustrated, take a break or stop playing for the night. I found that if I was starting to get slightly frustrated with a checkpoint I was not able to beat after many tries, I was able to beat it first try the next day. Overall, Thumper is a fantastic game worth the full 20 Canadian dollars.

It doesn't have many mechanics but if it had any more I'm pretty sure it'd be too complicated to be fun.

Un jeu unique en son genre m√©langeant une esth√©tique psych√©d√©lique avec une exigeance √©lev√©e afin de r√©ellement r√©ussir.

Un jeu de rythme sans concurrent. A jouer a la MANETTE. 

Le jeu est divis√© en 9 Niveaux, que j'apellerai Mondes car Ils sont divis√© en un nombre de r√©els niveaux propre a chaque monde. L'int√©r√™t de cette division en monde est que chacun apporte une nouvelle m√©canique. Les niveaux quant √† eux sont s√©par√©s par des checkpoints, vos points de r√©aparition.

Si l'on veut juste le terminer, le jeu ne repr√©sente pas une √©preuve tr√®s compliqu√©e except√© les Boss que l'on est oblig√© de faire sans erreur pour leur administrer des d√©g√¢ts qui, au nombre de 4 vous feront passer le niveau du boss.
Seulement, a mon sens le sel du jeu r√©side dans la compl√©tion des succ√®s, une m√©canique parfois inutile sur certains jeux mais qui, bien utilis√©e vous fera d√©couvrir les m√©andres d'un jeu. 

Le sel du jeu r√©side donc dans la compl√©tion des niveaux en rang S, c'est-√†-dire que, entre chaque checkpoint il ne faut faire aucune erreur, pour cela il faudra parfois faire et refaire des niveaux afin d'acqu√©rir une dext√©rit√© qui vous servira plus tard car certains passages se retrouvent a travers plusieurs niveaux.
Seultement pour compl√©ter un niveau en S, vous ne pouvez pas faire l'impasse pour le refaire plus tard, ce serait trop simple. Vous devez donc r√©essayez jusqu'a r√©ussir car vous ne pouvez refaire au maximum que le niveau effectu√© pr√©c√©demment et le niveau en cours.
De plus la compl√©tion en S FAIT LA MUSIQUE, quand un obstacle appara√Æt, il √©met une note et quand vous l'outrepassez il en √©met une autre qui, bien entendu s'accorde avec le ""th√®me"" du niveau. Comme sur un Dark Souls arriver a passez un passage sur lequel on rame donne un sentiment de SATISFACTION incomparable.
En compl√©tant un niveau en S vous gagnez donc : 
-De la satisfaction
-Vous profitez r√©ellement de l'ambiance du niveau
-Vous vous pr√©parez pour la suite du jeu
-Les boss vous para√Ætront juste des niveau plus long

Ce jeu, de part sa DA vous aspire et rend presque euphorique sans aucune drogue en demandant une dext√©rit√© exceptionnelle c'est indescriptible... Alors en VR, je n'imagine pas.

Simple contols just u/d/l/r and one button. 
You must read ahead at what's coming your way and respond correctly or be punished. 
There are tricks to getting really high scores by flying between and then pounding on the blue pads while stringing together perfectly timed turns and twanging the blue rings. 
You can also extend your flight through turns if done perfectly and this all requires a bit of strategy in order to optimise your score. 
Things get more hectic as the game progresses but none of it is unfair and the difficulty curve isn't too steep that you'll give up but, you will die lots and restart often until muscle memories develop. 
As well a being a really unique and sometimes quite creepy looking game, I found the soundtrack the most intriguing and immersive part. It's not tracks of music but more of a cinematic and dynamic score. I'd describe it as similar to those scary build up moments in horror movies that are accompanied by screechy violins that all lead to a climax except this games score seems to constantly be building towards a climax like the ""Shepard Tone"". This is accompanied by industrial sounding percussion that doesn't necessarily follow any particular time signature but does sound constantly ominous and puts me on edge. 
It really is very addictive and I can play for long sessions but when I stop playing I sometimes feel a bit exhausted from the whole experience, especially the later levels with the snakes and lasers. 
I play using a Fighstick because it is supported and also if you have VR it's just incredible. 
I really would like to add some negative comments about this game but for once I have nothing to say. 

The whole experience keeps you on your toes at the same time as wanting to hide away and close your eyes. The visuals and soundscape exist together perfectly. The controls are fair and easy to learn but it takes some hardcore finesse to get good scores. 

It gives me constant goose bumps while playing. I'd say just get it now because then you can say that you own THUMPER a very unique experience and one that you could return to quite often or even to again in a few years. It's a future classic.

This thing gets really intense. The difficulty is very well paced though, so you don't have to get it all down on your first few runs. The many mechanics for handling your ship are all introduced slowly, giving you just enough time to master each one before the next pops in and challenges you in new and unpredictable ways. 

All highways have the same basic aesthetic and similar cadence, only they obviously get progressively harder. Bosses will appear at certain points and shake things up a bit. Basically, wether on a boss or on a regular stage, you are only allowed to screw up once. Die twice and that's it, you gotta go back to the start of that section. There are ways to get your extra life back, but for the most part, the game wants you to get things right the whole way through.

A very important facet to the fast gameplay is that the game lets you play suboptimally without punishing you in any way (unless you care about high score). What I mean by this is that the game gives you a bonus if you make turns and moves at the last possible frame before an obstacle. While it looks really cool when you do it, it can be hard for inexperienced players to pull off. Thankfully, you're allowed to complete a level doing all your turns ahead of time, without worrying about constantly hitting the sweet spots. Later on in the game though, things do get more demanding, so don't get too comfortable.

It starts really nice and slow but it gets super confusing and complex as you progress. Also, the game doesn't teach you certain mechanics/moves like ""perfect turns"" or ""double jump"" and all that, so you have to figure it out yourself. It's almost like you're in this universe and try to find out new moves to past bosses/final bosses. This way the game really puts you in a ""discovery mode"" where you can go off script and try new things and beat your high score. Other than mechanics, the soundtrack and the atmosphere really put you in the mood. There are some goosebumpy moments where you can literally get that ""chilling feeling"" before you face the final boss. In conclusion, this is a must buy whether you like rhythm games or not.

So this is the still the best music rhythm [b] game [/b] in VR (emphasis on game). This game slowly but surely ramps up the difficulty. Throwing more and more at you as you go along and always faster. The amazing part of this game is how the game action perfectly syncs with the music. 

For whatever reason, the vast majority of music rhythm games completely miss on this. Beat Saber is another one that gets this formula right. Make every action you make be part of the beat of the music. So you always have an audio cue as to the timing while you get a visual cue as to what action to perform. It's like playing a Guitar Hero or Rock Band plastic guitar but with your controller, synced up to this boss destroying beetle.

The levels are basically training tutorials for the upcoming boss fights. Master those levels and the boss fights just become a showcase performance for your mastery. Beware: you do get audio and visual overload so anyone who is sensitive to lights or sounds may not enjoy this title. 

The title is also punishing soon after the first few levels, as timing is everything ... just like Guitar Hero or Rock Band, but on expert mode on a difficult song. The good thing is that repetition does make the game easier and as long as you have a musical ear you should be fine. Get a good controller though. 

Rate 9/10. Almost perfection. The only flaw I could think of is that there are no difficulty options so the game would be open to a wider audience.

As far as a rhythm game goes, the difficulty curve is well made. It starts off very slow like the first area of the first level of Rez, and the intensity takes a while to ramp up, lots of reptition built into the stages to make sure you understand the needed techniques. Levels are made up of 20-ish parts, the parts are 40 seconds or so long, and if you fail (two mistakes, with a short invincibility window to get back on your feet after the first mistake), you start back at the beginning of the 40 second part. There's a hardcore mode for being more hardcore about it if you want to be hardcore about it, too.

There's some aspects to it that feel a little cheap, like the boss enemy being visually the same every level (note: I'm only on level 3) and the lack of background visuals at times.

It's so hard! You'll also need impeccable timing to hit those beats. I think I broke out in a sweat. It's somewhere between a rhythm game and a twitch action.

It might be difficult but it generously starts you back at a checkpoint when you fail. You don't lose too much progress, you just lose score. It provides the player an opportunity to complete the game without worrying about the score. It still stings though when you do poorly.

As a fan of industrial music, and games - this seemed right up my street.

Catchy demonic beats run in the background as your eyes fill up with empty space and a single track to ride on. Starting off simply - the catch is to press buttons in rhythm to what you see on the screen. A very simple concept, but extremely satisfying.
Soon this game becomes very challenging among the 9 'worlds' and the levels in them, with a slight increase in difficulty and complexity, adding new tricks your little space bug can do to navigate the obstacles presented.

I will try not to spoil anything, but the last few levels of the game brought me to wonder why the first 8 worlds offered so little in terms of diversity in the world and music around it. I think some additional concepts (that were tried at the end) could have been brought forward to liven up the repetitive auditory and visual landscape of the first 7/8ths of the game. However, this would have come with its downsides, and would probably have left me feeling a little less ecstatic at the end at how freaking awesome it was..

Speaking of 7/8ths, I have heard rumours of the level/world number (e.g level 3 world 4) would have itself represented by its music being in that time signature (3/4). I did notice sometimes this could be the case, but could rarely concentrate solely on the time signatures as you really need to focus to beat a level. Either way, it's a cool concept, that even if half-executed (to not sacrifice gameplay) is just a really cool addition to the game.

I feel that anybody who has a VR headset, and is at least interested in industrial music should give this a go, as it is so cheap but can offer hours of intense entertainment. I would literally come out of sessions feeling a sense of intense satisfaction.

However, there is one issue that keeps cropping up for me in this game: that it seemingly wants to make you fail it, not by any fault of your gameplay, but by the game design itself.

At first the game sends out beats with signature sounds for each type of move you should make, and you repeat those moves as they arrive; it's pretty much a classic call-and-response, and even when it layers over itself it's fun to play along with. However, the game soon becomes so noisy, both visually and aurally, that you can't hear the ""call"" part of the call-and-response anymore. You're stuck with working by sight and your own rhythm--not necessarily a bad thing, but disappointing that you lose that feature so soon.

The real problem is when the game goes off-beat, which is in two cases: first, you only have one free hit in this game, and if you get hit twice, you're done. But when you first get hit, the game [i]slows down[/i] for a second and, again, brings visual clutter into play. You do get a small moment of invincibility, but more often than not the fact that the game intentionally goes off-beat is enough to kill you, not to mention that the red filter over the screen doesn't leave for several seconds, in a game where several correct movements per second are necessary to not die.

The second time the game goes off-beat is when you perform a ""slam"" on a beat, which turns an upcoming beat into a bonus beat. If you slam the bonus beat, the game pauses for a moment, much like hit-lag in a fighting game to show a devastating blow, and then continues. I mean, it is a cool effect and it gets the point across--but again, adding a pause into a rhythm game with so many rapid successive movements just seems short-sighted. I can maybe understand the argument for getting hit that it [i]should[/i] be a detriment and it's your fault if you can't recover; but getting punished for performing a move to gather more points? The risk for that maneuver should be setting up the slam itself, not the successful result of the slam.

I know I spend most of this review complaining, but despite these things, do I still recommend the game? Yes. Is that because I still have a fucking blast getting into the rhythm and beating a level after several futile attempts? Hell yes. It's damn good if you're up for the difficulty, and there's no denying it. These are just a couple things that could make it even better if they were fixed, and if there is a sequel I'd hope that its design strictly enforces no rhythm changes onto the player. If you'd be into this game otherwise, it's up to you to decide if that's enough to deter you from enjoying it.",1531368486,1531368486,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Opini√≥n acerca del juego:
Creo que esto est√° creado a base de una pesadilla, puesto que el ambiente tanto visual como auditiva no son nada bonitas y mucho menos su jefe final de cada nivel que va evolucionando conforme pases los niveles.
Porqu√© digo esto. Simple, nadie puede tener demasiada creatividad psic√≥tica para tener la idea hecha de la noche a la ma√±ana, puede que si pase de un d√≠a para otro, pero he ah√≠ el detalle, no lo puede hacer solo a menos de que seas alguien que est√© dotado de gran capacidad intelectual creativa...


*Espera, estoy mezclandolo con mi exposici√≥n de psicolog√≠a de mi academia, emm...Creo que me he perdido ( Pablo el libreto porfavor :v)*


Bien, en que estaba... Cierto, sobre el juego alv xd.
De las 24 horas acumuladas en un mes que me la pas√© jugando para conseguir todos los logros, he de deducir que todo tanto el ambiente musical y los efectos visuales de luz, enfoques y desenfoques, etc, etc :v... son algo de respetar, porque muchos juegos en esa calidad gr√°fica piden una mega PC de la NASA, pero este no tanto, solo una pc que sea del 2012 para adelante lo corre a 60 FPS, puede que de petardazos pero se soluciona con la resoluci√≥n de pantalla y reduciendo la gr√°fica igual no hay una diferencia notable en lo mini y m√°ximo en gr√°ficas excepto por la resoluci√≥n que ya mencion√© anteriormente, en cuanto a la jugabilidad pues es perfecta, pero en el nivel 5 para adelante te jodes feo y a√∫n m√°s en el modo plus ( + )

One thing to keep in mind is that it's not a traditional Rythm game. You don't really press buttons based on a musical cue but rather you need to react to what you see coming towards you but you don't need to be precise to get a good rank.

the trailer doesn't even show much of how satisfying and badass the rhythm and sounds from it get, but it's indeed just as violent and fast as it seems there (i'd suggest watching bits of gameplay to get a better feel but even that doesn't show how satisfying it is to play)

but yeah its pretty tough, specially if you wanna S rank everything, and from observing some friends play i realized a good sense of rhythm and timing is essential. if you're not very good at rhythmic games, you'll probably suffer and get frustrated (unless you intend on merely surviving, then you'll be okay... till the RING OF JUDGEMENT comes to make you pay for your mistakes)

What you're fighting or avoiding depends on the level and where you are, but at the end of each level, there's always a big bad boss. The rhythm games I HAVE played are mostly just ""hit the right notes, don't miss"" and/or ""here's a thing or two to avoid"", but Thumper adds more to that. There's plenty of obstacles, plenty of mechanics, and plenty of challenge. Taking a long break from this game and coming back is HARD--you have to remember all the controls, and then get back to the quick rhythm of the game.

Then you try again and again and again and again.... and in the end you make it and you get the feeling of pure joy, that you did make it (after just 2 hours :).... just to fail again in the next level :P

This is just kinda crazy jungle background beats with random sounds added, which signals the next obstacle to avoid/hit. The cues are progressively VERY difficult to hear. If there was an option for this alone, I would recommend this game. But, especially for ¬£15.00, I wouldn't recommend it to the unknowing rhythm-enthusiast. Grab on sale if you're curious.

Pros:
Great visuals
Attention to ambience
Simple, but difficult
There is a VR option!

Audio-visual overload dramatically causes gameplay issues

Das Spielt ist der Wahnsinn. Ich dachte schon Wipeout damals war schnell auf Rapier, aber Thumper toppt alles an Speed was ich bisher erlebt habe. Dazu kommt eine innovative Art von Gameplay, die Hindernisse, Spr√ºnge usw kommen im Takt der finsteren Elektro-Musik auf einen zu und man entwickelt wahnwitzige Reflexe mit der Zeit und gibt sich v√∂llig einem instinktiven Rausch hin.
Die Optik ist ziemlich psychedelisch, wobei man bem√ºht ist einen Tunnelblick auf die Strecke zu wahren um sich nicht ablenken zu lassen, was das Gef√ºhl einer irren Reise tief in die apokalyptischen Techno-Welten noch verst√§rkt.
Zu bem√§ngeln habe ich, dass es keine eingebaute Joypad-Unterst√ºtzung gibt - die Steuerung mit dem Vive-Controller ist nicht zu empfehlen bei den kurzen Reaktionszeiten kommt man damit nicht weit, und mit Tastatur zu spielen in VR ist ebenfalls unpraktisch. (das frei konfigurierbare Logitech-Pad als Tastatur-Ersatz ist f√ºr mich die beste L√∂sung in VR).
Ausserdem k√∂nnten die End-Bosse optisch etwas unterschiedlicher gestaltet sein, klar kommt es in erster Linie auf das spielerische an, aber es ist trotzdem unbefriedigend zum x-ten mal den selben D√§monenkopf zu sehen.

Abgesehen davon ist das Spiel ein echter Knaller f√ºr jeden mit einem Hang zu Geschwindigkeitsrausch und guten Reflexen.

It‚Äôs a strange rhythm action title, trying to invoke from you feelings of awe and dread in equal measure. It's closest counterpart would probably be the cult classic Rez - but even then, the differences between the two are evident at first glance. In short, it‚Äôs a bit of an odd one.  

Despite its surreal appearance, however, the actual gameplay at work in Thumper is remarkably straightforward. As your ship glides along, you press the action button to hit beats, hold it to smash through obstacles, or hold it and tilt the control stick to successfully navigate sharp corners or fly over hazards. There‚Äôs deeper mechanics at work as well (some of which the game unfortunately doesn‚Äôt do a stellar job at explaining to you), but the same base elements are always in play no matter the situation.

Such simplicity doesn‚Äôt make things any less satisfying, however. Once things start flowing this becomes an intense audio-visual experience; the beat relentlessly pulsing and pounding, colours blurring and whizzing around everywhere, everything hypnotically drawing you in to its weird world. At points, when everything clicks together just right, it‚Äôs easily possible to enter a moment of Zen ‚Äì an odd sensation where it feels as if you stop [i]reacting[/i] to the obstacles around you, and instead begin [i]sensing[/i] them instead. It‚Äôs something that's hard to process in words, but this is when Thumper truly shines; that moment where you become one with the machine, and everything else seems irrelevant in comparison. 

It‚Äôs frustrating, then, that there‚Äôs so many barriers preventing this experience from happening, the first coming with the intense difficulty level on show here. It‚Äôs a clear design choice to make everything a brutal and terrifying endeavour, with later levels hurling a screaming sense of speed and a relentless cascade of obstacles in your direction. And, to its credit, at times it feels like it works ‚Äì you‚Äôre instilled with a sense of dread at what‚Äôs coming that fits nicely into the game's tone, and the challenge of a difficult level really pulls out the classic ‚ÄúOne more go‚Äù factor that makes eventual victory ever the sweeter. 

Yet the problem comes with the fact that the constant stream of deaths before those small victories viciously cuts into the game‚Äôs overall flow. It becomes increasingly difficult to break into that golden trance-like state whereupon everything goes perfectly, and even when you do manage to pull it off, rest assured you‚Äôll be slapped back down to Earth by a new challenge sooner rather than later. In many ways I wish the game had chosen a path that was perhaps slightly less vindictive, and I do think the earlier levels are actually the strongest and most refined, if only because those don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre resorting to flinging you around with reckless abandon. 

Difficultly and the inevitable cries of ‚ÄúGet good‚Äù aside, what proves to be a bigger and more inexcusable issue is the sheer mass of audiovisual confusion that can occur all too frequently.  To provide an example ‚Äì level backgrounds can sometimes be filled with a deep red, and corners you need to navigate or die are denoted with the exact same colour. Given enough time, it would be easy enough to differentiate the two... But zooming around at warp speeds doesn‚Äôt really allow for those precious moments that you need. Taking the single hit of damage you‚Äôre allowed per stage creates the same problem; filling your screen with so much clutter the chances of a second, fatal mistake are drastically ‚Äì and frustratingly - increased.  

The real maddening example to me, however, and one the game seems to take glee on constantly pulling, is hiding obstacles immediately after sharp corners on the track. It creates a situation where a threat only really appears in your view fractions of a second before you‚Äôre meant to react to it, and the chances are that unless your reflexes are superhuman it‚Äôs going to catch you out. There are audio cues for the appearance of each obstacle where are designed to mitigate this, but even these just don‚Äôt feel all that distinct - all too often being lost or muted within the game‚Äôs musical beat. 

Put all these things together, and it creates scenarios where making progress seems like a trial and error process, more than something that relies on actual skill. It ceases to feel like the organic and flowing experience that forms the game‚Äôs brilliance, and instead becomes a pattern memorisation exercise that easily holds the potential to make your blood pressure rise rapidly. 

It‚Äôs a crying shame that this is the case, because it feels like Thumper could have been much better than what it actually is... But don‚Äôt take this to mean that this is an experience you should be ignoring. The real truth is that the game's uniqueness and strangely captivating manner deserve your attention, and those blissful moments where you enter into a true moment of Zen are worth the price of admission alone. So, if you‚Äôre any way interested, make sense to check this out ‚Äì you may have to work to truly see it, but there‚Äôs a thumping good time to be had.",1528324048,1528324048,True,9,0,0.593721151351928711,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However, there was one fatal flaw that made me stop playing it: audiovisual overload.

You see, Thumper has a mechanic where incoming obstacles are telegraphed by unique sound cues. Sometimes these cues are the only feasible way to predict hazards without memorization (this becomes very apparent in the vision-blocking tunnels, for example). But it sounds fair, right?

The problem is that half the time I can't even [i]hear[/i] these cues. Why? Because there's an intense backing track playing throught every level, as well as the sound effects from your own inputs and various other noises. You can't make these cues louder, either; the game only has one master volume slider.

So, whenever there was an incoming obstacle that I couldn't see, I'd take a hit. In the earlier levels, it's not too much of an issue; there's not a lot of them, and you can memorize them when they occasionally show up. But they become more and more frequent as you progress, By two-thirds into the game, they're not only more common, but the game starts throwing in visual distortions to make things even worse.

It was at this point that I decided to stop playing. From where the game was headed, things were probably just going to get more frustrating. Considering the game's short length, it's not a rather good sign that I couldn't be bothered to finish it.

(Years-later Edit: I did come back to the game, picked up right where I left off in the middle of level 7, and beat it in a couple of days. Nothing really changed at all. And that sucks, because I really want to like this game. I'll admit 100% that it feels fantastic to nail a satisfying beat.)

Side note: Discrediting reviews because you think the reviewer sucks at the game is stupid. Firstly, I've enjoyed plenty of hard games (Cuphead) as well as games that I suck at (Rocket League). What's different about those games is that the challenge is fair and/or there's an enjoyable desire to keep playing and improving. If neither of these conditions are met, then the difficulty just becomes frustrating. Secondly, game reviews are always subjective by nature.

I highly recommend for those gamers, who have something musical (or I can say rhythmical) sense background, because without it the game can be really annoying and very hard.

However, I enjoyed this game and have spent a lot of time with it, and I'm sure you can enjoy it too if it fits your preferences. 

In short, Thumper is a simplistic rhythm game that challenges the players quick thinking and the ability to judge what actions to take in order to get the biggest combo and score possible. As the game grows more hectic, the player is quickly forced to take in account also their health and overall survival. Even though the game is quite short, it includes enough mechanics and sufficient difficulty to keep things interesting.

Pros:

+ Stunning visuals and effects. Despite the immense feeling of speed and quick changes in direction, the game does not feel blurry or visually distracting. 

+ Amazing soundtrack. The name fits the game really well, and the thumping, rhytmic music really brings the experience to another level. The challenges and actions that the player makes also fit the soundtrack and it truly feels that you can depend on the rhythm to proceed.

+ VR support. (I have not tested this aspect myself, but have heard that it is stunning to look at.)

+ Good performance.

+ The game can be played in many ways. There are seemingly impossible challenges for the perfectionists hunting the perfect score, yet people who are not that familiar with the genre can survive and admire the view through the journey. 

+ New game plus-like levels that bring the difficulty up a notch, and satisfy the need for pure survival instead of gathering points, as they only grant you one life. 

+ Fluid and rewarding combo system with many tricks to utilize in boosting your score. It never feels dull to stomp on a note and feel the bass as you regain a life and improve your combo.


Cons:

- There is no that much content for people who are not interested in replaying levels. I would estimate that ""completing the game"" as in playing every single level will take 5 to 10 hours depending on skill. New game plus extends the game a bit, but includes the same levels.

- A big part of the game feels like a tutorial. The first 5 levels out of 9 constantly bring new mechanics to the table.

- Points, health and perfect turns are not explained well enough in the game. For example you need to time a turn perfectly to keep your wings open, but the game never tells you this as far as I'm aware.

- Long levels make it hard to replay your favourite parts of the game.


This game truly is a great rhythm game, and very fun for some people. If you like violent, responsive action I would recommend this for you. If you feel like the visuals of the game intrique you try it out, they make a great adventure. Do the war drums make your blood pump? Give it a go. If you are not a fan of rhythm games, or value your hard earned money, wait for a sale. Most importantly, if the trailers do not spark anything inside you, pass this one. There is not much more in the game that what it is shown in the trailers.

It does a great job of easing you into mechanics and then building on them in a natural way. It does this to the degree that once you complete later levels, going back and clearing S-Tier on older ones becomes much less daunting. The control scheme is simple to learn, but difficult to master. Obstacles are very clearly telegraphed, so you can learn to anticipate what is coming next, but levels are also really generous with checkpoints, so even if you don't have the reflexes to ""sight read"" levels on the first go you can always grind through a section and feel like you've made real progress. The game also takes the occasional time-out to reward progress with psychedelic interludes, which are a fun break while still keeping you in the flow-state. (The game is also good about quickly reloading if you die or restart, which is also very important for this type of game.)

For players who don't need to grind through a section repeatedly just to pass, there are also optional next-level strats to clear levels on S-Tier. Clearing a boss can feel rewarding on your first time through; straight [i]crushing[/i] them when you're grooving with full understanding of the control set can be cathartic. There is also an online leader board can encourage you to push beyond that, which adds some further replayability.

If you are fan of the various rhythm and music games, this should already cue you in now how the game plays out.

It's not like your actions need to be bound to overarching rhythm (like in Crypt of the Necrodancer or Space Channel 5), it's your actions against obstacles [i]create[/i] rhythm and music in patterns that are later repeated in sequences of harder and harder challenges.

There are musical cues for the dangers forward, but those quickly suffocate in the loud noise of the sound design, so your better off relying on your reflexes, pattern recognition and muscle memory first and foremost, just like BIT.TRIP Runner. This doesn't make Thumper a bad game, but it's something to keep in mind to not be disappointed by the design chosen for it.

Music that is not generated by stomps, grinds and dashes of your little space-ship-beetle-things, is mostly used to create an atmosphere of tension and oppression. This game is a series or consecutive crescendo events, that become faster and more dangerous with every second and violent strings and drums during all of that make a fantastic job with reinforcing this theme. Game is fast, dangerous and keeps you one the high alert for extensive amounts of this, making an interesting audio-visual experience that is quite unique to its contemporaries.

Thumper's main issues lie mostly in expectations for the perceived design. Somebody might be disappointed that there is no ""real"" music to speak of and attune to for the duration of the gameplay. Again, that doesn't mean that the game is not worth recommending, far from it, but buying Thumper you need to be aware of that it really tries to achieve.

There is also a noticeable problem with tutorials and difficulty curve. Tutorial for the stomping mechanic was for me and many others (check forums) quite an irritating trial-and-error. Game tries to explain it to you, but the exact controls used for it can be hard to grasp of. Also, Level 6 out of 9 is noticeably harder than the rest of the game. Final level is not a cakewalk either, but high difficulty for it is expected. Level 6 doesn't have any justifications while it's far more difficult than others.

Overall, I had a plenty of good fun with Thumper and I can recommend it to fans of aforementioned games that are similar to it and action-game fans in general. However, its 20 dollar price tag is quite steep for 6-8 hours of content, but getting it on small/decent sale shouldn't be a problem.",1525254073,1533472583,True,5,0,0.592357754707336426,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Rythmic Violence sums it up pretty nicely and i can say its unlike everything i played before.

I bought it on a whim after following on the sidelines for the last 2 years when it was on sale after i forgot about it for some time, and i can say it was worth the money ;)

And its challenging from time to time, other times its just awesome graphics and sounds... 

The most important/funny aspect i experienced myself with this game is how it gets you to WANT to avoid making mistakes while playing. Its not like in Guitar Hero when you miss.... this is wholly different.
You actually make the sounds yourself to the rythm (partwise yeah, but ... atleast for me this sums it up better than any explanation i could write out and strech through many many lines)

So

Just a THANKS to the developers of this game.

It's pretty boring and the music is awful and grating. It's too easy, it's a rhythm game for people who are no good at rhythm games.

I love rhythm games, they are some of my favorite experiences in the realm of video games.  I was really expecting to love this game, but I do not.  I waited for it to go on sale for over a year and a half and finally downloaded it after seeing it recomended to me over and over, as well as watching videos on YouTube like the Game Grumps. I've been really excited for this game for a long time in the gaming world, only to be bitterly disapointed.

I only played it for an hour and 20 minutes and got half way through level 4/10 before realizing that the game has nothing to offer me, and anything it has to offer to anyone else already owns it.  It's a simple rhythm game. That's it. The visuals are pretty cool sometimes but get very old - very quickly - and the music (if you can really call it that) is harsh and grating and most ashamedly of all; boring and uninteresting.

The music, first and foremost, isn't music. It's an atmospheric drone, something that builds tension as you progress your way through the stages, then releases once you reach the end of the level. Over, and over, and over, and over, for every level just grating and scraping and then it starts over again!  I know why the devs chose this, it fits with the game's ""psychadelic"" tag pretty well in terms of if you were watching a movie and needed something to watch the visuals with, but as a game it's extremely tedious. It also lends itself well to the overall soundscape of the game (that despite all my problems with it is actually pretty good) if only because it takes a comfortable seat in the background so that you can hear the ques for the upcoming inputs - but it's SO boring.  It's a sin how boring the music is in this game. In my mind this  is a minimum of -3 points from the ""out of 10"" concept. It's unacceptable.

The game itself is no Taiko Drum Master. It's no Osu. It's no DDR. It's no Bit.Trip Runner. It's no Guitar Hero. It's no Impossible game. It's no GeoDash. It's not even a low end newgrounds rhythm game. Much of it's problem is the core game mechanics that dictate the games inputs were not well thought out by the team at Drool, in part it plays somewhat like a driving game, which could be really cool, but when you can hold a turn well before it comes while also holding a dash to break through the bars on the track the rhythm part of the rhythm game becomes irrelevent. The game never demands that you return to a ""neutral stance"" you just can if you feel like it, or ar trying to get a higher score, but even then it doesn't matter.

It also suffers from nonsense complexity that is clearly shoehorned into the game to make it feel more compelling than it really is. The bold text on the store page: ""Notice: A traditional controller is strongly recommended to play Thumper"" makes it seem like the game has some complexity to it that may benefit from a controller layout. Nope. The gameplay mechanics are so simple that they would be in no way hindered if they were converted to a tablet. Hold right, left, up, or tap down while ocassionally tapping, but mostly holding, the A button. In the case of many rhythm games this is a boon, like in GeoDash, a game that came to it's own in the mobile market, but in the case of Thumper it makes the game feel cheaply made and poorly thought out.

In my admittedly short time within the game I was able to achieve several S ranks while simultaneously angry at the poor control decisions, bored by the gameplay, and absolutely furious at the terrible sound design. I'm done with it.

With all of that said, I thouroughly expect other people to enjoy this game - ultimately it is quite compelling.  And while I figure that anyone who might enjoy it already owns it, it's possible that someone might not, in which case I'll leave you with this: If the music in you rhythm game is important, run! Don't walk away from this game; RUN! As fast as your legs can carry you! For everyone else you might as well give it a shot. Or don't. I don't care what you do, I'm not your mom.",1524052813,1524554513,False,8,0,0.443619102239608765,3,True,False,False,False,,,

The controls are pretty intuitive, so you can jump in and out with ease. It's one of these 'easy to learn, hard to master' games, at least starting level 4, which separates the casual player, who just wants to complete the game, from the dedicated one who's going for that rank S, taking many more risks.

I saw many comments about the rhythm being off tempo. For some reason, there are som off beat sections in the first two levels, but none in the later stages. When it feels off tempo, it's either because of the rhythm itself that's weird - as in unconventional for non musician ears, or, most likely, because of you, playing just slightly inaccurately. The margin of error reduces with time, of course, as the tempo gets faster and faster, and the rhythms more intricate.
For instance, at the start of level 5, the game teaches you a new 'mechanic': some sections you'll have to play perfectly or else you'll lose a life (you have 2 per checkpoint). Except it doesn't say anything on screen. All it shows you is an iron gate and the usual blue dots on your way. You'll almost for sure miss the last part of the rhythm at least on your first try: the iron gate will come and zap you. 

That's one aspect I particularly like about the game: it doesn't want to help you. Tbf, if you're not going for max score, the game is pretty easy anyway, and if you're taking the time to endure the fails of perfect turns and sequences, trying to get that S, you don't need much help.

Other than that, the soundtrack is obviously fire. Wish the downloadable additional soundtrack had the alternate versions of the tracks but it's great as it is anyway. The visuals are actually immersive: you get lost in this infinite universe of red, green and yellow. There was this one moment when everything turned green I actually got chills from the visuals alone, and I'm only level 5.

So far so good, but it is missing some key elements.
~No multiplayer nor workshop. Everybody's asking for these two. Make it happen. Custom maps, custom tracks, multiplayer gamemodes (like 1v1 survival with some special powerups that refill with your score, for example).
~No 'endless' mode. Procedurally generated, with selectable stable difficulties or evolutive ones. Every game like this one needs that.
~Customization, because why not.
~Mutators (+ or - speed, blinded/half blinded [thinking of brutal mode in Guitar Hero], no sound...).

I bought the game for $5 or $10, and I don't regret it. 20 euros seems pricey for a single player game, and although the graphics and audio explain the cost, I can definitely see people rebuked by the price.

Thumper's like that. Its tagline is ""rhythm violence"" and it follows it without a fault. The background music is primal, you could almost expect demonic chanting to fade in at any point during it. It doesn't get in the way, and at the same time it floods the senses in a way that induces a very simple, aggressive euphoria. The percussion gives you hints as to what obstacles are coming up next, which is more of a useful tool than you'd think.

One could say that Thumper's just a game about reacting to obstacles. They'd be right, although there's more than a one-dimensional approach to them. For example, if you have two notes coming towards you, you could either smash both of them, or fly off of the first one to smash the second one even harder. It takes a special finesse to spot these sorts of options, and the game's much better once you find them.

Thumper manages to build off of its core very well, too. Many obstacles tend to build off others - for example, when there's more than one lane, worms can snake down one of the lanes and make it dangerous, causing you to shift back and forth. Or perhaps I could wring back in that fly-smash option I mentioned earlier - if you do those, you'll send blast waves along th track. Those waves can break certain barriers that might prevent bosses from being hit.

It doesn't hugely matter what platform you buy Thumper on. Just buy it. Seriously.",1523168882,1523168882,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's not a lot of games that click with me like this, but this is one of them.

It's not primarily a music or traditional rhythm game. It was rhythms, it has beats, sure, it has plenty of patterns, and, as someone else put it, ""it doesn't try to trick you."" It does go along to a semi-predictable pattern, and you can start to ""feel"" when you have to do certain things. But it keeps you on your toes, and is supposed to be difficult, oftentimes relying on quick reflexes and sometimes memorization. It makes you feel as if you earned every ounce of your progress, and just feels great.

The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but at lvl 5 it seemed steeper than the earlier levels. Lvl 7 felt faster than the others before it, and didn't exactly make things harder, but just faster paced and more fun. It's one of my favorites by far, and when I really realized how much I love this game.

The controls are extremely simple, but there's a lot you can do with them, and a ton of ways to raise your score. Definitely would recommend a controller for this though, the keyboard controls never really worked for me.

The levels have a great amount of replayability if you care about getting the S-ranks or climbing up on the scoreboard. Just running thorugh the game to beat it will proably take around 9 hours or so, I'd think.

Though it's simple and seemingly pointless, there is a kind of story present. Things get stronger, and there's a final boss that brings the whole thing to a really nice wrap. Maybe I thought too much into it, but it really kind of blew me away. After that, the beetle seemed more like a character than a souless moving piece for the game.

There's only one thing I don't like, and it's that the scoreboard doesn't tell you out of how many people you're placed, just where you are. So you have no idea in what percentile your score is in. It'd be awesome to see like 100/5000 or something to know just how impressive your score really is, and if you're above average or not. It takes a bit too long to scroll to the bottom of the leaderboards to see when they end.

Overall an exellent game, though. It really takes you on a journey, and is an experience I don't think anyone who's a fan of these kinds of games should miss.

The tutorials teach you how to handle some of the obstacles, but not all of them, and also fail to show you there are multiple ways to pass some obstacles. Then the game throws in some 2D worms that don't move at the same speed as the other obstacles.

You do everything with just one button and the analog stick, but sometimes you simply can't know if you're supposed to tap or hold the button, because you can't see the obstacles yet. Sometimes obstacles make different sounds depending on what you do, but the game never tells you what is the correct way.

The game tries to be minimalistic but it's just confusing because you don't know what's happening. At random points the level changes and you see your score, and I have no clue what the ""kills"" are on the scoreboard.

There are obstacles you can only pass by memorizing them, but the levels have no memorable spots to build memories around. It's just the same obstacles in the same sequences over and over again. Same backgrounds, same looping music, same everything.

It lacks sub-frame input detection and it's missing any kind of delay calibration, features which come standard in most rhythm games (even free ones). Then again, Thumper isn't really a rhythm game, at least not in the traditional sense. Most of the challenge comes from having to react extremely quickly as similar-looking obstacles come barreling towards you. Occasionaly I was killed without really knowing why, only to later discover that a projectile I was supposed to be avoiding happened to be the exact same color as the track.

The mechanics create a constant feeling of uncertainty, because the main button must be held down to perform many of the game's actions, yet at the same time you are frequently required to tap the button to hit the bars that come down the track. This means you're constantly second-guessing yourself about if you should be keeping it held down or not. Some people might find this to be valuble gameplay, but to me it broke the flow of the game and made it more stressful than fun.

The atmosphere created by the game is dark and forboding, which is an appreciated change of pace from the neon colored-rave that many rhythm games (there's that term again) seem stuck in. Unfortunately, it's largely this one note the whole way though (at least as far as I got), and the various stages seem almost indistinguishable from each other. Sometimes there are long, unskippable stretches where literally nothing happens, as if you're supposed to be so enraptured by whatever weird tentacle tunnel thing is ahead of you that you'll forget that there's nothing to do.

I wouldn't say Thumper is a bad game. I wouldn't even say it's a badly made game. I would, and will, however, say that it isn't nearly good enough to justify the current $20 price tag, given its simplistic gameplay, embarassingly baren settings menu, and lack of variety.

By the way, if you play on KB+M, I highly reccomend that you try mapping one of the mouse buttons to the main action instead of the spacebar. Unfortunately, you'll need to use third party software to do this, because the game doesn't allow mapping to mouse clicks.

The audio and visuals match perfctly and the rythm gets me right in my chest every single time. I first saw the game on you tube and it doesn't do it justice. I highly reccomend experiencing this masterpiece for yourself. 

One thing I found so alluring about this game is the way it makes you feel both powerful and vulnerable at the same time. The unsettling build up to bosses which send shivers up your spine in anticipation are beautifully placed. The minimalistic design is an interesting and, in my opinion, a great choice, simple yet just enough detail to keep the eye entertained when the break periods come, but not so much that it distracts from the gameplay. Last little detail I loved are the little break periods which come once every level, they really do give your brain, eyes and hands a much needed rest which was a nice touch.

Final bit about the technical aspects of the game, I have one tiny complaint and It's that sometimes turns are hard to see when you're in tunnels if there are 2 or more one after another. Though I will admit that as the game progresses and your skills improve you'll start to pick up on audio cues telling you which obstacles and how many are ahead of you.

The songs are minimalist, the rhythm of your actions doesn't always fit the beat, and you can't always see what's coming ahead of time. It also gets blisteringly fast. So the game is more based on trial-and-error. Trying to compare it to a rhythm game doesn't make it look good, either.

You time your button presses based on the visual obstacles you see at the front. Sometimes, you can anticipate the obstacle according to the beats and claps as they set up ahead of you. And if you do the combo correctly, you will create a beat. 

What the dev absolutely, 100% accurately worded, is that it's a rhythm VIOLENCE game. 

You'll get slapped around left and right by neon walls and every sound of failed timing will hit you harder than actually losing a life.

Mechanics are simple, straightforward, very visible in levels, and very satisfying (especially perfect turns).
You can clearly tell how each death is your fault, and that's great. No stupid RNG or unreasonable sequences.

Level design is absolutely stellar. They don't just throw bullshit at you left and right and expect you to have perfect reaction time. Intuitive and sensible patterns are established in early levels, then reused and adapted in different orders for later levels.

The difficulty progression (difficulty relating to the order and density of sequences and the difficulty of sequences used) is incredibly smooth. There wasn't a single arbitrary difficulty spike in any level transition. Bosses were great; hard but reasonable.

Last but not least, the aesthetic. The intense, grating, horrific visuals and audio are beautifully unique for the genre, and they really take Thumper far. Having your senses assaulted feels great.",1514963481,1514963481,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm not joking.

It's one of the few games that lives up to and then goes beyond your expectations, and the game description says EXACTLY what it is (isn't that a shocker). It's a horror themed rhythm game that makes you feel like you are on a rollercoaster avoiding hard to visually decipher obstacles, asking you to pick up on audio cues for the much needed assistance. I maintain you could play this game with the sound off even and have a good time, but it would be much much more difficult, and trust me when I say you don't want this game to be more difficult... It's a ball-breaker, and if merely beating the game wasn't hard enough, the true and blue gamer in you will be upset with the meagre score you got, and you will end up demanding that you replay the whole game, chapter by chapter enhancing your chapter scores, which is a motivational practice games haven't used since the atari days... or I guess just... other rhythm games...

To close out my review, the game is entirely enjoyable because of the bizarre nature of the aesthetic and theme, and is the most solid action-rhythm game I have ever played... If you like rhythm games, it is a must have. If you like mechanically solid games, it is a must have. If you like interesting themes, sound, atmosphere, and aesthetic, it is a must have. It is a game where I am convinced the only people who would not recommend this game are baby-people that can't beat the second chapter...

I'm a long time fan of rhythm games, producer of electronic music, and fan of cosmic horror. How could I not love it? Turns out this is one of the rare times I've really regretted buying a game on steam.

First off, this is the most arrhythmic ""rhythm game"" I've ever played. How it calls itself a rhythm game I dont know. It's a Simon Says/QTE game and your actions **sometimes** create musical moments after you input them. You won't be using your ears to input commands, you will be using your eyes, which is awful since a lot of the prompts are not even visible. You can input commands wrong/skip commands entirely and not be punished at all, but then die to a wall not even visible until the second you need to respond to it. 

The music is 100% forgetable and at no point do you feel a part of it. As I think back on my time playing, I remember the same boring kick drum, same boring snare, and a seemingly random placed preset synth for over an hour. 

If you want the better version of this game, it was made over 15 years ago and is called REZ. It's on steam. Spend your money on that and not this.",1514603678,1514614477,False,15,2,0.48809465765953064,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Everything is excellent, from the music to the visuals to the controls (even on keyboard). The music and visuals speak for themselves from the trailer, but I do really praise the controls. They feel so precise that when you inevitably mess up you have no one to blame but yourself. The difficulty curve too, is perfect. It starts you off slowly, and as soon as I found myself thinking, ""I feel like I could take on a bit more,"" there it was. So far nothing has felt bullshit either, everything has been very fair and when I mess up it's my fault.

The only nitpicks I have are: 
1. It took me much to long to figure out how to recenter my headset
2. The synth-y non percussive elements of the music could be a bit louder, I sometimes have to focus to hear them and you can't afford extra focus in this game

[b]Thumper[/b] has a subline, dreamy design focus where the artwork, music, sound effects & streamlined gameplay combine to set the tone, altering your perceptions of reality. It's trance-inducing, beautiful & strange, but the void is full of surprises.

[b]Be one with the Space Beetle[/b]; it all starts out calm, introducing you to the basic control scheme through the first set of stages & how to combine them, but your peaceful existence quickly ramps up. Before you know it, it's a hardcore, ludicrously fast challenge of your reflexes. As with other rhythm based games, the longer you go without mistakes the higher your score will become. Mistakes don't often spell the end of the run, but too many in sequence & the [b]Space Beetle[/b] will not be happy.

All the controls are boiled down to a single button & directional input combinations. Although simple, it did feel a little counter-intuitive for me, taking a short while to get a grip on the timings & position of the hit zones. Using both press & hold actions for the button adds some complexity as you transition between flying above or gliding on the track. Whichever move you make, they all have a great tactile response. Grinds feel heavy, jumps hit the ground with the impact of a super hero & glides through the air have that light touch.

[b]Pure Rhythm?[/b] There are sections very precise with the rhythm timings but as it speeds up & the adrenaline pumps it loses some cohesion. Relying on the rhythm for your action timing can become problematic in later stages & throw you out. The music adds a massive amount to the experience, but does veer away from being more pure rhythm based gameplay as it gets harder. Outside of the alignment to the music, the levels are well designed and generally flow well.

Although I enjoy a challenge, the main drawback with [b]Thumper[/b]  [i](for me)[/i] is the overall difficulty level increased too quickly. It goes from very easy to crazy fast in just a few levels, which limits the level variation you can access without pushing through. If you are a mere mortal & get stuck like I did a lot [i](& still am!)[/i], then the repetition of the levels may discourage frequent replays & just lead to abandonment. I still like to come back and play as it is truly a great game, but wish a ""Play[b]-[/b]"" mode was added for those less rhymically inclined like myself to at least experience the full game. For the price, it‚Äôs a little light on the content; more levels or random mode would also be welcomed.

Most aptly titled, [b]Thumper[/b]  certainly lives up to its name. Thumpin' audio & visuals & Thumpin' physics & controls, it‚Äôs a one-of-a-kind experience that will melt your synapses!

There is a feeling of reward after hitting a beat, and and even better feeling of reward after a perfect, this is because it makes different sounds based on how you land it. Normal for normal, enhanced for perfect. The different ranks/grades will motivate you to strive for a S or an S+ (Depending on the mode).

The tension is structured so well that although it is frustrating, I forgive the game within minutes while playing it. I went through levels 1 to 3 on keyboard and went for S rank. Succeeded through determination. When I tried level 4 I could not keep that up at any sublevel/part of level 4 (read checkpoint). I got through those hard and awe inspiring levels this way but the final boss was so hard I had to beat him with a traditional controller. 
Staying adapted to the switching of lanes was possible because of it.

If there are any professionals out there that can finish this game without a controller I would like to see them try. Just don't wreck your keyboard. Thumper looks unique and is the only rhythm game that stood out to me enough to buy, but don't risk breaking your keyboard over it. 

This requires a traditional controller to keep going for a longer time at your best skill. The only game I have that requires that controller to a greater degree is Attack on Titan: Wings of Freedom.

Also, the certainty of having a failed turn when you could have sworn you had that perfect turn is a reccuring event akin to and more common than the ""can't place that there milord""s of a stronghold game. It just doesn't have the same semi pleasant sound to it.  But the almost explosion like movements going on when you take damage (just what flies of of your beetle, it doesn't affect your control) looks amazing. The death explosion looks incredible too.

Frustration, beauty and sound come together to lure you into and pull you out of gaming. It also gives a pretty consistent adrenaline rush. I don't know how to compare it to another game and that is why I nominated Thumper for defying discription.",1513289322,1529159614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You speed along a track with various turns and obsticals which you must navigate either by steering appropriately or hitting an action button to speed up, jump or other actions. All these are timed with the game's electronica soundtrack (making it much in the vein of Rez or Frequency/Amplitude).  The game can be difficult - most stages only give you one allowed mistake and you're forced to repeat it. The stages don't change in terms of layout, so mastering some requires learning the track's actions. Along the way there are opportunities for grabbing bonus elements that can restore that one mistaken if you get several, but some require very careful timing.

It also has creative boss battles that use the same type of collection aspect to launch attacks against the boss. 

The whole game is minimalist in instruction, so there is some learn-as-you-go elements, but the stages and checkpoints are frequent enough to not be frustrating.

I largely consider the game incomparable, with nothing else I've played since quite matching its style, but if there ever were an heir to Rez's legacy, it would be Thumper. 
Rez came out 16 years ago and still feels futuristic, in a distinctly zen-cyberpunk sort of way. Thumper, though barely a year old, carves out a similarly fresh niche with its unsettlingly organic surreal-futurist hellscape. More than anything else, Thumper feels intense. Thumper makes your palms sweat and your heart race. At once mercilessly unforgiving in its execution and yet completely fair in its rules, Thumper teaches you everything you need to know and then expects that you will learn and understand. Thumper throws a tremendous amount of light and noise and motion and discordancy and trusts that you will sort out the information that you need from all of the madness and push through the maelstrom it sends your way. 
And then there's the last level. Christ, the last level. It may be brutal but it's worth the entire effort of the rest of the game to see how the last level subverts all the rules you've learnt up to that point.

This is probably my most favourite rhythm game of all time - for the super-satisfying, visceral, heart-pounding experience, for the exciting but fair challenge, for its crazy abstract aesthetic, but also for being a really excellent GAME.  EVERYTHING about it is good - the visuals, the controls, the challenge, the soundtrack, the game design.  More on that later...

*****************************
WILL I LIKE THUMPER??

- If you enjoy rhythm or music games, Thumper may be for you.
- If you enjoy feeling a fast-paced, highly visceral connection to what you're playing, Thumper may be for you.
- If you enjoy psychedelic imagery and abstract, transcendant experiences, Thumper may be for you.
- Check out gameplay videos of Thumper on YouTube - does it excite you, or give you ASMR-like satisfaction just from watching it?  Thumper may be for you.

It did all of these things for me.  I was dying to love Thumper, but will I ACTUALLY like it??

As far as I can tell, people who wanted to like it, but didn't enjoy Thumper mostly have a problem with the fast-paced nature of the game - they claim it requires memorization or unreasonably fast reflexes.  I **strongly** disagree.  I had this problem with the game Cosmophony - the final level required careful memorization and practice, and could only be done through painfully learning the sneaky parts that WILL kill you the first time.  I like hard games - challenge isn't the issue - but having to memorize passages defeats the purpose of music games for me - I want to respond and react to the sounds as they happen, not be concerning myself memorizing button sequences.

Easy solution!  Watch a YouTube video of the final level of Thumper, Level 9.  Notice you can hear audio cues ahead of time for each obstacle, as well as clearly see where obstacles appear further down the track most of the time.  This is as hard as the game gets.  If you're interested in Thumper, and it seems reasonably doable to you, GET THE GAME.  ITS SO GOOD.

There's also another portion of ""didn't like Thumper"" because they didn't like the soundtrack.  Again, just watch a bit of it, and decide for yourself if that's something you can get into.

*****************************

Thumper is an **excellent** game with a carefully constructed difficulty curve.  There are tricky passages of course, but you have the equivalent of two hit points, and if you lose any, you have the ability to gain them back with skill.  There are also regular checkpoints, so you never have to grind levels from the beginning.  The controls are beautifully simple and approachable - Left Right Up Down X - and yet you'll find there's a lot you can do with those basic buttons if you really want to get into it.

Ultimately, it's fairly simple to learn the basics and sail through the levels and simply survive, but there is a ton of room for precision and expertise - if you want to up your challenge, you don't even need to try different play modes.  Thumper lets you make it harder on yourself just by attempting trickier moves.  For example, don't just survive the corners - perfect them for stacking bonuses!  But if you mess up the timing, you might die.  Do you just get by, or do you risk going for the bonuses?  

The better you get at the game, the more challenge it has to offer, and is extremely satisfying to ""get right.""  I can't recommend this game enough.  My ONLY warning is some people have problems ""seeing"" the track ahead of time - just check it out on YouTube first!

Oh, and a note on controllers: YOU DON'T NEED A CONTROLLER.  The visceral feedback from controller vibration is awesome and super satisfying, but I actually find keyboard to be a much better for this game.  You need accuracy and precision if you really want to master the game, and I find the millimeter I need to twich my finger faster and easier than having to roll my thumb around on a D-pad or joystick.  Or maybe I just have tiny thumbs.  Whatever.  Point is, controllers not required.

Please support this game.  Aside from it being an awesome game, I had some technical difficulties and lost my game file due to an unrelated computer problem - the developer promptly addressed my problems and sent me a replacement file so I didn't lose any progress.  They seem awesome.  Just buy it!",1511539814,1511539986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I find it challenging and addictive, its particularly hard if you're trying for perfect S scores like me. So far I've gotten a bit into level 5 and sometimes I question my willpower on getting the S rank. I've had to take a break but I will be giving it another shot real soon. I will get every acheivement!
That said, if you're not into self-inflicted mental torture it's still good. A lot of it is memorizing patterns rather than pressing buttons to the beat, but even then it's real satisfying when you thump and slide to the drums. The music is great and you will feel it in your core, especially when you die. 
Some cons I find in the game is that sometimes it feels off, like to not miss the ""thumps"" I find myself having to press the button a bit before the beat, which is slightly annoying but eventually you kind of get use to it and its not as bad. I found this mostly a problem in level 1-2 when it's slower and not as complex. 
There's also been times when the track waves quite a bit (like during boss fights and special moves) and it waves so much that it hurts the beetle. This did get annoying, particularly on difficult levels that I had to do over and over again. I would finally make progress and this wave that acts like a turn hurts me and ruins the score. Perhaps this wouldn't be so bad if it was consistent but sometimes it doesn't happen. I'm not even sure if you can turn as there is practically no warning.
Overall I found this game worth the money. If you like rythm games this is the game for you, and if you want a challenge go for S ranks, if not, then don't.

The difficulty is the main weak point as you can simply ""survive"" the levels without too much effort except for bosses, the only challenge comes from scoring ranks S but it's really frustrating being mostly mnemonical and with some checkpoints being so far away.
It's not even a real rhythm game, as there rarely is any music to follow, you ARE the beat yourself with a lot of cool repeating patterns and buildups, but this makes you rely on visual clues that can be pretty hard to spot with the oversaturated graphics.
That being said the gameplay is fresh, and it looks and plays perfectly. I'm really torn on this one.

+ Tight controls and fresh gameplay
+ Trippy aesthetics
+ Groovy soundtrack
+ Perfect 21:9 support
+ VR support

- Really overstays its welcome with 9 world that all look and play the same
- Rhythm is often hard to follow, visual clues are unconsistent
- Difficulty mostly comes from trying to get high scores

Manejamos a un escarabajo que se desplaza a toda velocidad por una v√≠a infinita en el hiperespacio y debe sortear obst√°culos dispuestos seg√∫n un ritmo musical infernal hasta enfrentarse, al final de cada nivel, a una cabeza alien√≠gena demon√≠aca gigante. Es tan alucinante como suena.

El juego tiene un control sencill√≠simo, podr√≠a manejarse literalmente con un mando de una consola antigua de Atari: necesitamos un stick de control (recomiendo pararse en las opciones para ajustar un poco la sensibilidad de la palanca) y un bot√≥n de acci√≥n. A medida que nuestro escarabajo se desplaza por los ra√≠les, aparecer√°n unos indicadores luminosos siguiendo el ritmo de la m√∫sica: si presionamos el bot√≥n de acci√≥n cuando estemos encima de ellos, aumentaremos nuestra puntuaci√≥n al final del segmento del nivel, y si encadenamos varios indicadores lograremos cadenas de combos que aumentar√°n a√∫n m√°s esta puntuaci√≥n. Estas cadenas de combos, por cierto, son la √∫nica manera que tendremos de derrotar a los jefes: tenemos que ""clavar"" cuatro secciones para lanzar cuatro disparos al enemigo y derrotarlo, sin fallos.

A medida que pasamos niveles se van a√±adiendo nuevos obst√°culos que requerir√°n distintos movimientos, y aqu√≠ entra de nuevo el bot√≥n de acci√≥n: si lo presionamos, protegemos a nuestro escabajo, y esto es imprescindible para sortear las curvas, recodos y trampas del escenario. Pero no podemos mantener presionado todo el rato el bot√≥n: primero porque sino jam√°s lograremos cadenas de combos, y segundo porque mientras estemos protegidos el escabajo estar√° fijado en uno de los ra√≠les (y por tanto, en el momento en que haya m√°s de uno en pantalla tendremos un problema). Tambi√©n podemos hacer que vuele el escarabajo moviendo el stick hacia arriba, y as√≠ podremos desplazarnos incluso estando protegidos manteniendo el bot√≥n de acci√≥n; y si movemos el stick hacia abajo para aterrizar justo cuando estemos encima de un indicador luminoso lanzaremos un disparo (imprescindible para eliminar unos escudos que aparecen a veces para proteger a los jefes).

Como vemos, el control se basa principalmente en moverse a los lados (y en determinados momentos arriba y abajo) con el stick manteniendo pulsado o no el bot√≥n de acci√≥n. Es muy sencillo, y sin embargo el juego est√° tan bien dise√±ado que constantemente despliega situaciones variadas y complejas. Es un juego muy dif√≠cil y exigente: no depende tanto de seguir el ritmo (aunque esto es imprescindible para alcanzar las mayores puntuaciones) como de tener buenos reflejos... y algo m√°s que buenos reflejos en los tramos m√°s traicioneros.

Yo no tengo gafas de RV, pero no las he necesitado para disfrutar del juego; si alg√∫n d√≠a las tengo ser√° un incentivo para volver a jugarlo. Da igual c√≥mo lo jugu√©is: es una experiencia audivisual terror√≠fica y alucinante. Hay que verlo para creerlo.

This one hooked me in when I first saw glimpses of gameplay. Perhaps it is due to my lack of experience in the genre, but this game feels like it does everything in it's power to have the gameplay/movement and visuals directly correlate to the music/beat. 

It starts off nice and easy to get you into the mood, then after a while it ramps up difficulty and chaos just enough to still be fun. The visuals are great and complement the music which can be hectic yet still have a sort of luring pattern to it. 

My only complaint is that in the later levels (I've only made it to level 4 btw), the music and beat become very sperratic and the gameplay turns into a constant test of reaction time more than following the beat (which may become drowned out by the sound effects in-game). 

Overall, it is a game that feels very satisfying when you play well. I recommend it to anyone who has the money to drop (and a controller, the added vibration makes it much more cathartic).",1505889827,1505889827,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If the price was less than ¬£5 I'd have probably given it a second chance. 

The VR support was lame because there was no roomscale or motion-controller support, but even if there was, I don't know how that would have made the game any better. Perhaps if I could sit in the cockpit of an actual Space beetle in VR mode and make it jump, turn, strafe, dive etc to the tune of the music using the motion controllers or the HMD then may be I could have probably justified the price. 

For both VR and non-VR you can get more interesting rhythm-based games for less than ¬£10 (Polynomial 2, Soundboxing, Chroma Lab, etc).

The way the game assaults your senses is both exhausting and immensely satisfying. My play sessions were usually not much longer than an hour because I started to have trouble focusing after a while due to the intensity. This also meant that I never felt bored or like I was grinding. The 30ish hours I played feel like much much longer due to that intensity.

My first casual playthrough was a great experience on it own. I encountered a difficulty spike somewhere in the middle and another one later on but eventually got past it. When I replayed for S-ranks I started to appreciate the game on a whole new level. On my first playthrough I was just focused on surviving, which was tense enough as it was at my skill-level. When playing for S-ranks you have to play near-perfectly and you have to learn a bunch of new techniques that you didn't need when playing casually. I really got to appreciate how the levels slowly teach you new concepts and then just keep building on them more and more. It was also funny how on my first playthrough the bosses were the most difficult, but with S-ranks it was the levels themselves and the bosses almost felt like a break where you could relax a bit.

I usually don't replay games and the reason I did for Thumper was because its actions were so satisfying to perform and the state of mind I had to be in. If I got too stressed or frustrated I would make too many mistakes and would be unable to proceed. I had to remain calm in the face of repeated failure and the sensory overload the game throws at you. Every time I tried to learn a bit more or improve my muscle memory. That calm combined with the amazing sound, visuals and speed has made it one of my best experiences in gaming.

- Very nice overall atmosphere and ""world"" design.

Cons:

- Sometimes the rhythm is all over the place, as in: It changes too much sometimes.
- In some levels (especially the last ones) the visuals are over the top making it hard to see the jumping pads.
- Some later levels seem easier than earlier levels. This can just be me being weird though. Difficulty is a subjective term to an extend after all.

This game will challenge you as you progress through the levels, and it will fustrate you sometimes.

Also I used a PS4 Controller on the earlier levels and used my keyboard for the rest, and tbh, I would recommend a keyboard since I was able to hit some ""moves"" that weren't possible for me when I used the PS4 controller (or I was just really bad).

If you like what you see in the trailers, then you'll probably like what Thumper has to offer.

Thumper's a rhythm game centered around just pressing button prompts in response to various threats and signals. There's barely a story to speak of and the most I've seen so far is a recurring boss that kind of changes with each level. I've seen Thumper constantly compared to rhythm games, but it's not really like any other rhythm game I've ever played. There are no standout tracks and rarely any moments where I find myself bobbing along the rhythm. Instead, Thumper just commands your attention with these heavy metallic drum noises that dictate almost all of the game's music, and instead of feeling like you're playing a song, it feels like the great music is more of a byproduct of you playing the game.

That's not a bad thing, though, because Thumper is a unique premise with excellent execution. It has all the simplicity of the Runner games with all the intensity of something like the new DOOM. Think of super simple gameplay with a very harsh atmosphere and brutal difficulty. And by brutal difficulty, I mean repeating whole sections over and over because you didn't pull off a sequence of button presses without making a mistake. This brings up one of my only problems with Thumper: the game is so hard at times, you're forced to memorize levels which leads to a trial-and-error sort of gameplay. I feel like this is a side effect of simply not being very good at the game and not paying attention to certain cues, but I can see it turning off some players. If you don't like repeating yourself like in Super Meat Boy, Runner, or 1001 Spikes, you might not love the game's later levels.

But if you DO like punishing gameplay and everything you see in the trailer, then I'd say Thumper is worth your time. Not only is the main campaign tough as nails, getting S rank on every level will def keep you occupied. And there's even a NG+ which basically adds permadeath to each level with no healing and makes you start from the beginning of the level if you quit. That may sound ridiculous, but I LOVE that it's a feature because it fits the hardcore nature of this game so well. And just to cover all bases, the game looks and sounds good, runs great, the controls feel tight, and the atmosphere is very unique. My only problems are the tougher bosses and the fact that, during long play sessions, you can get a little burnt out because the game CONSTANTLY demands your attention. I guess that's what happens when you play Breath of the Wild for 3 weeks and then move to something like this. LOL

).
If I could do a mixed review I would. I'm only giving a thumbsdown to help personally balance the game from currently a very positive to either Mostly Positive or at most Mixed.

     The game presents itself as a psychedelic hardcore rhythm game. It certainly is beautiful and very engaging to the eye, but it doesn't feel like any rhythm game at all. Each stage has it's own kind of beat and feel to the rhythm, so each stage does feel unique; but personally only the first 3ish stages had rhythms that I could predict/feel. After the first few stages the beat doesn't seem... ""there"". 

      The first 3 stages I can tap my foot to and almost predict what is going to come up next and how it'll sound; it's generally pleasing to my ears. The next 4 stages I got to feels like there's no beat, and takes a kind of ""dubstep"" feel to how the notes are placed, I can't for the love of me find a beat to tap/nod to, doesn't feel satisfying once you hit all the notes and ""complete"" the song, and doesn't actually sound like anything but random instruments/pots&pans banging about; every note comes as a suprise to me and I end up playing the game not by following the rythm, but by trial and error and just memorizing the placement of objects (no rythm needed). 

     There's a slight neutral nitpick and that's the preemptive sound for each note. In the background you'll hear a note play to what's about to come up, and you kind of gauge when to hit that note; In the first few stages this is used along with the sound of you hitting the notes to make a nice beat/song to play along to. Later on the game gets faster paced and has more notes to hit, so it comes to a point where you just hear background notes overlapping and obstructing what beats you're hitting and just generally ruining the ""song"" that the game is trying to get you to make.

     One finally nitpick is turns. For the life of me some turns feel like they're programmed differently than others. You hold Actionbutton ([A] on controller) then left/right for what direction you're turning. You can also wait til the exact moment to actually hit the turn button for extra points and a nice ""ping"" sound that makes the song sound better. Some turns feel like their exact moment to hit the turn perfectly is placed differently than others. 90% of the turns seem to have a general rule on when to exactly hit the turn, and some feel like they're way sooner than before, making me take damage and costing me a retry or death. This can get very infuriating later game when all the sounds of preemptive notes and notes you're hitting overlap adding to the bad design type of difficulty; making it feel like the game isn't a skill-based hardcore where I can learn from mistakes, but rather a game that changes core rules randomly to make you hit a small bump to artificially impede progress.

     I want to like this game, but the only thing I can like about it is the sound (when they work), and the beautiful graphics; with that it is less of a game and more of something just to watch someone play than to play yourself. (5/10)
If I was to grade the game soley on the first 3 stages and the rest of the stages were made like the first 3, I would easily give a 9/10 or a 10/10 if the turns were more consitent.",1501222255,1501222578,False,4,0,0.504854381084442139,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The only thing that I would like to suggest is not make the game slow down so much if you mess up the first time.

I probably wouldn't recommend this game to casual rhythm game players, and I don't mean that in a bad way. If you're expecting to listen to the music and coast through the levels, then you're probably not going to have fun. The beat is pretty hard to keep track of, and I found myself attempting to tap my foot in time and failing at certain sections. There were times in the track where I had to basically guess where the beat was and go from there. Speaking of the track, there isn't much to listen to. There's barely any lyrical sections of the music within the tribal drums. I would say that this game is close to something like being in a drumline or auxillary-only percussion ensemble. It's a lot of call and response in which the call inputs get so convoluted that you have to depend on reactions and muscle memory. In all, I would say that this is a great game - the whole ""story"" of the game is pretty vague, but I'll let that slide since this is primarily a rhythm game after all. The graphics get kinda weird, but I guess they wanted to make this a horror game. I found myself really apreciating the different cadences the developers used, so thumbs up for that.

The abridged version is: [b]buy it[/b]. I have been obsessed with this game for the past few days and that train, much like the space beetle you play as, is not stopping anytime soon. If you‚Äôre interested in reading about how I believe Thumper applies play conditioning, minimalism and cosmic horror to create a brilliant game filled with gorgeous graphics, an intense score and absurd replay value ‚Äì go ahead!
 
This strange game is an incredibly satisfying trifecta of psychedelic art, rhythm-based play and horror tension. Seriously, somehow developers Drool have managed to make a game described as, [i]a space beetle travelling through the void[/i], a uniquely terrifying and intense experience. I want to focus the majority of my review on a concept I think Thumper executes brilliantly. It‚Äôs a term known as [b]play conditioning[/b], and it‚Äôs not mine ‚Äì I first heard its use by film and games essayist [b]Hbomberguy[/b]. He coined the term vis-√†-vis Thumper; so, with this in mind, I believe it to be intellectually honest for me to present his argument given that I will proceed to apply, expand and comment on it.

[b]Hbomberguy[/b] argues that Thumper is a difficult and unforgiving game. As a space beetle, you are constantly speeding through a nightmarish void filled with traps, aggressive abstract geometry and horrific giant heads. It‚Äôs like a racing game ‚Äì only you‚Äôre a beetle with two lives and you will relentlessly respawn at the beginning of each level because in this game, the dead shall rise again until you escape hell. It‚Äôs a fast-paced adventure that requires great reaction time in a psychedelic environment that constantly assaults your senses. Nevertheless, Thumper is made in such a way that the more you play it the more intuitive the controls become. Your actions match the score in the background and, if done well, sync and contrast with the environment around you in such a way that it feels [i]good[/i] to pass a course with an S ranking. 

From a technical standpoint, [b]play conditioning[/b] is where, why and how should buttons reflect in-game actions. Thumper achieves such that with the help of mechanical minimalism the player is conditioned to play a fast, aggressive, relentless and intuitive game -- or so at least it is designed. Your controls are simple, WASD and SPACE BAR, but the combinations of moves and trap responses are almost infinite. Yet, throughout all that, your hand is comfortably numb, clicking away up to five keys to safely speed through a course in a truly melodic way. By the end of a course, the overall sync of action, score, color and learning curve resemble the moment when a guitarist learns a new song. That has been my experience ‚Äì I have been obsessed with this game. It has tapped into my completionist vein and I will relentlessly redo a course until I get the highest mark. [b]Why?[/b] Because of this game‚Äôs incredible application of [b]play conditioning[/b]. The way the game mechanics are built promotes a type of gameplay that is challenging, rewarding, and ultimately, highly enjoyable. I have more fun failing a course over and over again, with each new time learning the course's inner mechanics like a new song, until I finally complete it with the highest mark than simply breezing through each score, ignoring certain optional obstacles, losing lives and achieving C, B or A marks.

Thumper also has an actual effective training method to introduce you to what we‚Äôll call ‚Äúthe level‚Äôs learning curve‚Äù. At the beginning of each level, the first few courses focus on showing you a particular new skill or combination of actions ‚Äì usually with a HUD display that will indicate exactly when to do what. Moreover, as the level progresses it incorporates learned skills, with current skills and the occasional unreferenced unlearned skill. It‚Äôs a way of avoiding monotony, increase replay value and keeping an element of surprise during each level (which has approximately twenty courses). All in all ‚Äì great game, gorgeous graphics, intense score, beautiful mechanics and arguably one of the most recent games where mood, theme and immersion have nothing to do with story or characters.

I've played through all of Play and three stages of Play+, and my initial feelings of awe and excitement have not dwindled. The issues I have with this game are so few that I have to list them specifically to fill out my cons side.

Graphics: 

Pros:
While I don't play on VR, the game itself is not demanding. With a GTX 1070, I've pushed 8x MSAA with 4K rendering at 144hz, and I haven't seen a frame dropped yet. Aesthetics, as others have mentioned, are very trippy. Bright lights and flashing objects fill the screen in a compact pleasing manner. I find this to be one of the key parts of the game, offering powerful imagery. 

Con:
At some instances, mainly the last stage in Play+, the visuals get so intense and saturated that it becomes nearly impossible to see. 

Audio: 

Pros:
For me, the music is a standout from other rhythm games. Where most other games will hardly ever tour away from straight 4/4 rhythm, this game has no qualms in handing out the grungiest offtime, polyrhythmic, additive timing beats. It's a refreshing breath of air, and I wish other reviewers understood the timing was on purpose. The mixing of the soundtrack gives it enourmous space, strengthening the games aesthetics. 

Cons:
Without a good audio setup the drums can get washed out in the reverberations and game's hits, making it difficult to play ontime. The snakes in the game appear with a high hissing sound, when they appear multiple at a time, any speaker set with a high frequency range can hurt your ears from the intensity. I recommend gamers play two decibals down from their max listening volume, to save on ear coverage.

Gameplay: 

Pros:
The gameplay is tight and responsive, and hitting notes are very satisfying, The game's difficulty curve is very smooth, except for stage 7 which I found the most difficulty in beating. The general opinion differs from stage to stage though, so I feel that it's a personal issue. General movements across the menus is fluid and fast. 

Cons:
Sometimes the stages can feel a bit repetitive. My biggest qualm comes from turns. Getting perfect timings on them can be frustrating because it's so unforgiving for pressing late. I've raged more than a few times repeatedly dying to turns that I feel I've hit properly.

Concidering the games aesthetic I was pleasently supprised about how easy it was to get into, the learning curve is actually pretty pleasant. At the start of each level you're introduced to the perils that lie before you in the abyss, and slowly eased into the level itself. 
Well.. that's up until level 5, when that piece of shit lazer cockring starts blasting your ass like the death star, while kicking you off beat with it's skrillex soundboard. God I hate that thing. But after a blood sacrifice and some really hard headbanging I managed to become one with Satan's bongobeats and, while jumping around in my couch like a disgruntled teen on a cybergoth concert, kicked level 5's ass into oblivion.

The music, which usually is the main focus in rythm based games, is suprisingly lacking in this one. The tracks aren't bad in any sense, don't get me wrong. But concidering that the visuals of the game really just punch you right in the tit with their fantastic sci-fi interpretation of Dante's Inferno, I'm very suprised that the music lacks the same kick. In comparison it at times feels, flat, monotone and quiet. That's of course understandable in the ""pause"" parts of each level, but when the action's on I'm really missing some hard clear rythm. I would really expect more bass and robotic rape noises. Go search up the noices the reapers in mass effect make, that's the kind of sound I was looking for with this music. In really intense parts of the game this problem kinda disapears because the sounds from all the obstacles you're smashing through just becomes a nice rhytmical beat in and of itself. The background music is just a bit pale when compared to the visuals is my point. 

For serious though I truly am enjoying this game, even though the learningcurve breaks after level 4 and that the music isn't as heavy as I'd like I would still recommend it to anyone that thinks Dark Souls isn't pissing them off enough, cause boy is this shit unfair at times. 

7/10 highly enjoyable and frustrating, will play it more

I originally found out about this game via The Beetles Of The People a.k.a. Jim Sterling.
I just had to have this game!
If the difficulty dissuades you, fear not!  It actually starts out fairly gentle and progressively gets more intense as you ride along.

Thumper is Audiosurf meets... anything dark and space-themed.
(The dark side(s) of Star Trek/Star Wars immediately come to mind...or perhaps Batman...)
I once read that the beetle in this game was inspired by some album art.

Good music, stellar sound design and cues, sleek and shiny visuals, responsive performance... what's not to like?

And finally, in case hemiola and odd rhythms (syncopation) aren't enough for you, this game has odd time signatures as well.  Think about it: isn't 4/4 a bit overused in this day and age?  Playing in 5/4 and 7/4 is so refreshing (but 5/8 and 7/8 are so challenging!).",1500026633,1511455817,True,9,0,0.643490195274353027,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a game made by two very angry men.

I say 'fighting', because as far as I know the 'notes' are actually enemies and/or attacks. I don't know nor care. It's glorious.
The gameplay is enormously satisfying, every hit 'note' and wall grind punching a beat right into your ears, every missed 'note' breaking a window instead. The rhythms are complex, the soundtrack so utterly heavy and percussive. It's like an angst-filled teen with a drumkit and some talent. 
Some gameplay elements (e.g. how to hit certain 'notes') are either not explained in too much detail, or I was too busy pummeling my hands into the soundtrack. I bought the game alone first off, and bought the soundtrack later, if that's any indication of how satisfying the beats are.

This is what video games are about

The visuals are absolutely enthralling and emersive. Gets better the bigger screen you put it on, there is no shortage of eye candy, drugs recommended. 

The music goes hand in hand with the visuals, errie, spookie, and visceral. The music and colors create a primal experience of fear and adrenaline that every good game tries to match.

The game gets more complex with each level, reaching points of rage and frustration but with the perfect one more try incentive and feel. The game is punishing, but not cruel. The game achieves levels of complexity and difficulty that are hard to find in todays sea of interactive movie walkthroughs, yet, Checkpoints are numerous.

There are plenty of other rhythm games that I'd recommend over Thumper. I list some of them in the sections below.

[h1]Music Selection[/h1]

Let's start with the music: It's droning percussion without a lot of variation or movement. Find a youtube video of someone playing Thumper. If you like what you hear, then great, maybe this game is for you. If you don't like what you hear, bad news: that's basically all you're going to be hearing the whole game. Most rhythm games have a selection of songs that you can play at your leisure; if there's a song you don't like, no big deal: just don't pick that song, and instead pick the songs you [i]do[/i] like. Unfortunately Thumper is structured as a linear game where you play the levels in order, one after the other. And you can't play level N until you've beaten level N-1.

[b]Games that did it better:[/b] The Bemani series (Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania/IIDX, Guitar Freaks, DrumMania, etc.), Rock Band, Guitar Hero, etc. all have varied song lists in different genres and style, and let you pick which songs you want to play.

[h1]Graphics/Aesthetics[/h1]

This is arguably Thumper's strongest selling point, but graphics are only enjoyable insofar that you get to see them. And to see them, you have to actually play through the game. That might sound tautological, but there are rhythm games which understood that a core appeal of their game were the trippy graphics and the synesthetic experience, and thus let you just coast through the game, even if you did extremely poorly, so that you can enjoy the full experience. In contrast, Thumper is fairly unforgiving: your beetle has 2 hit points, and if you make 2 ""mistakes"" (failling to turn, crashing into a barrier, failing to jump over an obstacle, etc.), you ""die"" and are sent back to a previous checkpoint.

[b]Games that did it better:[/b] Rez has beautiful visuals that evolve with the music, and shares a similar aesthetic style (though its tone is less gloomy than Thumper's).

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]

The core mechanic behind Thumper is call-and-response. The game will present a rhythm involving both audio and visual cues, and then you're supposed to perform the rhythm back to the game. Unfortunately, there are several flaws with the way Thumper implements this mechanic that makes it unsuitable for fans of rhythm games.

First of all, of the 5 or so different cues that the game presents, only 1 or 2 (depending on how you count them) involve timing. That is to say, the majority of the gameplay in Thumper does [i]not[/i] involve rhythm. There are 5 possible inputs that you can send to the game: Up, down, left, right and action. When there is a glowing spot on the floor, then you need to press the Action button just as the glowing spot passes underneath your beetle. And when you need to perform a stomp-maneuver on the glowing spot, then you need to press the Down button just as it passes underneath your beetle. That's it. For every other cue, you can send the input way in advance of the cue's arrival, and if there are several such cues in a row, you can just keep the relevant button held down to trigger all of them.

For example, there's a horizontal barrier which you can only ""break through"" if you're holding down the Action button. It's not unusual for these barriers to appear in a syncopated rhythm (e.g. note note pause note pause note note note), but it's not clear what the point of that rhythm is, because what you're supposed to do when you encounter such a cue is to just hold down the Action button through the whole thing.

[b]Games that did it better:[/b] The Rhythm Heaven series is kind of like a Wario Ware for rhythm games: Each song/stage uses the controls in different ways, as if a completely different mini-game. While some of the games might have a ""just have the input be held down"", they do so for variety's sake, and the majority of the games do ask you to actually perform your input to a rhythm.

[h1]Input Timing[/h1]

This is somewhat related to the previous sections of mechanics, but the input timing on Thumper is completely off, and the reason it's completely off is a direct result of the design decision they made that the inputs should be ""held down ahead of time"" as opposed to activated as per the rhythm of the music. Find a video of someone playing the first level of Thumper, and then tap your hands on the quarter notes of the song. While you're doing this, pay attention to when the beetle performs a turning maneuvre.

Notice that the beetle turns, and then as the turn ends, a chime plays, and this chime is on the quarter note beat (i.e. synchronized with when you tapped). This is the [i]end[/i] of the turning maneuvre, which means that this is the point at which it's okay for the player to actually release the inputs. Which means the player [i]must[/i] have entered the input at some earlier time, not on the beat.

The game essentially forces you to enter in your inputs ""not on the beat"", which is very frustrating for a rhythm game. I completely understand their desire to have the chime sound effect land on the beat, or else the game would be frustrating for auditory rather than tactile reasons, but it seems like they could have fixed this design flaw by simply having the chime occur at the [i]start[/i] of the turn, rather than at the end, and have the player perform the inputs for the turn on the beat of the song.

[b]Games that did it better:[/b] Dance Dance Revolution, In The Groove, Beatmania/IIDX, Guitar Hero, etc. all have some concept of ""holding down the input"". However, they ensured that both the start and the end of these inputs occur on the beat. Further more, they ensured that the ""attack"" (the moment the player actually presses the input) must occur on the beat (as opposed to Thumper's approach to let the player press the input at any arbitrary point before the beetle needs to perform the maneuvre), which leads to a much more satisfying input experience.

[h1]Cues[/h1]

Probably Thumper's weakest point as a rhythm game is the quality of its cues. The game uses both audio and visual cues in its call and response system. The audio cues by themselves are not unique enough that you can solely rely on them to play the game without memorization. For example, a ""turn"" will be signaled by a handclap sound effect. However, you won't know, from just hearing the sound clap, whether you need to turn left or right. And again, Thumper only lets you make 2 mistakes before your beetle dies and is sent back, so simply guessing based on the audio cues is not sufficient.

Then what about the visual cues? Here, Thumper struggles due to overprioritizing its aesthetics. The beetle is travelling along a narrow corridor with opaque walls, and the corridor twists and turns. While visually interesting, the end result of this is that when the corridor turns, it blocks the player's view of the upcoming cues. The level design seems to be unaware of this problem, as it repeatedly uses an anti-pattern in several of its stages where the beetle is cued to turn to one side, and immediately needing to turn in the opposite side with no warning (because the cue for the second turn was hidden behind the walls of the curving corridor). When this happens, Thumper is no longer a rhythm game. It becomes a game of reaction time, and/or memorization as you die and then replay that section, but now knowing that two (or three or four) turns in quick succession are going to come.

[b]Games that did it better:[/b] Groove Coaster is a rhythm game in which your avatar follows a curving path. However, it's able to avoid the pitfall that Thumper falls into by having the path be a simple line with no walls, and thus nothing to ""block"" the cues.",1498910376,1498910376,False,86,4,0.599472880363464355,12,False,False,False,False,,,

[b]While it is a great runner, it is a terrible rhythm game.[/b] The levels designs prioritize being challenging over matching the background music, and the sounds they made are usually not musical at all. Worse still, because each obstacle makes the same sound every time, what music they can create is very simplistic and repetitive, think a drum set except only one drum can be played at any given time and there is a short delay between any two drum hits. Thumper also progressively add more obstacles to the levels as the player gets more experienced, which is good as a difficulty curve but also mean the music gets even more monotone at the beginning.
[b]However, that doesn't mean it's not fun.[/b] The game is very responsive (as a runner should), the obstacles are intuitive, the UI is clean, and the presentation is very stylish to say the least. If a runner is what you want, Thumper will satisfy that need very well.

Edit: I'm changing my verdict to be positive. I still insist that the music in this game is bad, but once I set my expectation right, the sound effects become very cathartic.",1498712804,1499880295,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It gets to you in a way that I dont think any other game has managed to. It builds this constant progressive dread that seems to never end up to a never reaching climax. And it does that just by asking you to hit a button when a blue square reaches you, slide on some walls and fly over some obstacles.
I wouldnt go as far to call Thumper a horror game as in its not trying to scare you like Resident Evil or Outlast would, but its a compelling candidate for existential horror, the kind of horror Lovecraft was so enamoured with. And it manages to accomplish this just by the abstraction of its aestethic and its incredible sound design and  industrial techno soundtrack.
In Thumper you are in control of a silver beetle stuck on a track on its journey to the beyond. The game clearly establishes very early on that this is serious business just by the tone of the music playing and it gives you a very brief tutorial before sending you on your way, without much care if you will survive or not. Very quickly you will be struggling to press the button on time with the blue notes that pass by you and the music simply wont let up.
But up until this point, the only punishment you seem to get out of missing these notes is a reduced score. No big deal.
Then, real danger starts to show up. You will have to turn the beettle in time with the turns of the road, and hold down the button when some barriers show up alongside the track. You fail to do this, you lose the beetle's armor. You fail to do this twice, you are dead.
The great thing about Thumper is that the control scheme is very minimal and easy to understand, so the game takes that opportunity and throws you the most violent sequences of notes and obstacles to deal with, leaving you in a constant state of (positive) stress. Sometimes it seems impossible, but the game always gives visual and sound indications of what the next obstacle is, so you soon learn how to deal with it and its immensely satisfying to get an S-Rank on a segment.
The game also has bosses that truly test your skill up to that point and really stand as a barrier to those who arent ready for the next level. The final boss does what great final bosses do: test your skills to the max while also providing a new challenge to overcome not seen in the whole game up to that point.  
Its an amazing and thrilling experience with some of the best surrealist visuals and music to complement it. It leaves you in a state of trance where you stop seeing the notes and just start guessing and predicting where they will be by sound alone, and thats the best compliment I can give to a Rhythm game.",1498613182,1498630645,True,29,2,0.730640053749084473,0,True,False,False,False,,,

PROS

-Feels good to play (responsive, never feel cheated out of a life)

-High and stable FPS (nice on 144hz monitors)

-Intuitive. There's no real walkthrough or in game guide, but it's easy to catch on to (almost) everything

-Wide skill range. This game isn't as hard as some of the noobies that left negative reviews might convince you to believe. With a controller and a little bit of time and practice you can beat the game in less than a week, AND there is a high skill ceiling if you want to go for all S rank, AND a much higher skill ceiling if you want to improve your score on the leaderboards (and of course the much more unforgiving newgame+)

-Visuals. The atmosphere is just amazing, fast, and scary just like I never knew I wanted it to be.

-Sound. The sound is 70% of everything good in this game. I cannot give the sound guy enough props. It gets the adrenaline pumping while keeping you on beat and letting you know the beat to come. Brilliant.



CONS

-I wish there were more levels, or at least user made levels. I beat the game twice in <20hrs (1st playthrough + S rank) and even left the game open for a few hours. There's still newgame+, but they're all linear levels. Good for practicing, but it does kill the replayability a bit.

-Lack of an in-game guide. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, but trying to figure out how to stay in the air during turns to hit those high arches consistently was a bit difficult without a guide. Everything else was mostly covered at points in the early levels. 
Note: There is a PDF guide if you right click the game. I found it after I beat it the second time.

-The game has amazing visuals. so color vibrant and trippy!.
-If you are wanting to fully beat this game with all achievements.. good luck.. it took me a while to do so!.
-Adding on top of that. the soundtrack is unbelievable its so heavy and fits so well for what this game stands for.
-And even with the +Levels you cant get enough of this game even if you are trying to fully beat it or not.


Cons:
-I wish there was more variety in stuff we had to hit/dodge. but i guess the speed makes up for that.
-It felt like when i tried to land to hit a note it didn't work sometimes.. as if i just skiped over it..
-(i wouldn't really consider this a bad thing. but maybe just being lazy). near the end of the game Boss: Level 9 just seemed really easy. and even in i think it was Level: 9-23 or Level: 8-23 they just copyed and pasted the first half from the last stage. kinda a stupid thing to complain about but i feel like it just makes the game easier.

I didn't buy it before because price was too high to gamble on it, but after playing the first two levels I must say I would have bought full price! Perhaps a demo would beneficial for sales.

Anyway, the games seems spectacularily thematic and in both the first levels the pace/intensity of the level picks up (and gets harder) and it feels really good nailing the sections. Really good. I'm used to rhythm games so it was quite easy to pick up the new things the game threw at me so far, though for some people it might take some practice/getting used to. There are music ques that you hear before you get to it, so you can use audio ques to know whats coming even if you don't see it. Sometimes its hard to pick up, mostly when you are doing some moves (which makes noise) while the ques ahead are still playing. The overlap is short and workable so far, I'm confident with more playing of the levels I can pick up on the ques while doing stuff at the same time.

Game sounds great on my bose speakers/subwoofer. Pretty good through my cheap sony extra bass headphones too.

Anyway, listen to the soundtrack to see if you're into the ambient beats. I say its good but maybe your sense of music is different. This game's tough as balls and you'll need to make sure you can identify what percussion element is what in order to advance, and that the atmospheric sounds sit well with you.

This game really forces you to use your ears as well as your eyes. If you're listening well enough you'll be able to identify upcoming obstacles before your eyes can even register them (which is important cause auditory reaction time is almost always faster than visual reaction time in humans) and you'll be able to identify rhythmic patterns instead of treating each impulse or bank as an individual element.

Honestly that's where a lot of the negative reviews come from--the failure to augment their reactions with audio cues. Some later levels are intentionally designed so you CANNOT see what comes at the end of a sequence--you have to listen for it, and trying to do it visually is pushing the limits of human reaction time. E.g. if you hear 3 'slaps' you'll know you have to bank 3 times and when you have to, even though you can only see the first turn.",1496145452,1498178161,True,71,7,0.853759407997131348,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Listen to the track before you buy to make sure you are into the type of music in the game. If you aren't, that will be a problem. Unlike other rythm games, this one is not built around diverse choices of music, different songs, etc. There is really only one ""song"" in this game, and it plays the through the entire game.  This does not detract at all from the experience, since this game really masters the atmosphere it is trying to create. See if that atmosphere looks awesome, and if it does, you will like this game. 

Also, a warning that this game is challenging. I have beaten the first 7 levels and the 7th took me a couple of hours. Rythm alone will not help you succeed in the later levels, because there are tons of off-beats and minor fluctuations to keep you off balance, and you have very little visual time, or audio cues to react to these changes since everything is moving very fast, and sometimes appearing from around a corner. In order to beat the uber-boss on level 7 I had to memorize the pattern. This has turned some people off from the game, but I can say that if you are looking for a challenge, then this game rewards you with intensity, frustration, and that wonderful satisfaction when you finally get that S rank on a difficult part.

PROS:
- Very simple controls for your brain to click to what you see coming at you
- Tests your perception and reflexes
- Immersive graphics and music (the soundtrack is pretty fun)
- Very replayable with challenges that really test your concentration
- Playable for short bursts of time. If you want something that tests your mind for maybe 15 minutes, this game should do the trick.  

CONS
(Note: these are only my opinions on what others may not like)
-  Not the best game for casual players -> unless you like exploding, you'd best be awake and alert when playing this game :P
- Not much variety: the aforementioned challenges comes from replaying the game's levels. Not very fun for people who find tedium in seeing or hearing repeated patterns.
- Very different soundtrack. I personally view this as a good game feature, but it is possible that the music and visuals can be off-putting to some.

Pour les autres, sachez que le jeu √©tait un jeu de puzzle et de rythme. Oui, je vous recommande plut√¥t de regarder une vid√©o pour comprendre le concept si vous ne connaissez pas le titre du studio Invisible Handlebar en 2008‚Ä¶ surtout qu‚Äôavec le temps, AudioSurf est devenu un jeu culte et il n‚Äôy a qu‚Äô√† voir les review Steam pour s‚Äôen convaincre.
‚Äã
Bref, tout √ßa pour vous dire que Thumper est dans la forme un cousin √©loign√© d‚ÄôAudioSurf. Mais attention, si on regarde de plus pr√®s, le cousin est un toxicomane sous LSD qui aime rouler √† 300 kilom√®tres sur l‚Äôautoroute, sans ceinture de s√©curit√© et qui montre son majeur √† tout va, bref √ßa vend du r√™ve et rien que pour √ßa, Thumper m√©rite votre plus grand respect.

Petite pr√©cision qui a son importance, autant ne pas acheter le titre si vous √™tes √©pileptique. Thumper est √† bannir, car c‚Äôest un jeu qui vous fera faire en crise en moins de 3 minutes chrono. Maintenant que je vous ai parl√© des pr√©cautions d‚Äôusages, il est temps de boucler vos ceintures de s√©curit√©, car croyez-moi, √ßa va pulser s√©v√®re‚Ä¶
‚Äã
On prend le contr√¥le d‚Äôun vaisseau (qui ressemble d‚Äôailleurs √† un gros scarab√©e m√©canique) lancer √† une allure folle sur une sorte de rail cosmique et le but sera de parvenir √† passer en rythme chaque obstacle pr√©sent sur votre chemin. Thumper vous demandera d‚Äôavoir des r√©flexes d‚Äôun mutant et d‚Äôavoir le rythme dans la peau pour arriver √† boucler les 9 chapitres pr√©sents dans le jeu. Les amateurs de scoring seront ravis d‚Äôapprendre que le jeu vous donne un indice de performance sur chaque portion que comporte le chapitre en cours  et les plus talentueux et les plus acharn√©s d‚Äôentre vous chercheront √† obtenir la note la plus √©lev√©e qui soit. (Un mutant aura le score de ¬´ S ¬ª et le plus mauvais aura ¬´ C ¬ª et tout cela devrait plaire √©norm√©ment aux amateurs de scoring)
 
Le gameplay est exigeant et ne laisse pas le droit √† l‚Äôerreur, mais il est simple et il ne faut que quelques minutes pour prendre main notre scarab√©e m√©tallique. Une manette est quasi-obligatoire et je vous conseille d‚Äô√©viter le combo clavier-souris sous peine de faire une crise de nerfs tr√®s rapidement‚Ä¶ La vitesse d‚Äôanimation est vraiment tr√®s impressionnante et le jeu avec ses d√©cors propose une aventure quasi hypnotique. Il faut √™tre tr√®s concentr√© pendant ses sessions et 20 minutes suffisent √† √™tre tr√®s √©prouvante, c‚Äôest le moins qui puisse dire. Thumper vous bouscule et vous demandera de la coordination, de la concentration pour passer chaque chapitre et il est difficile de d√©crocher tellement le gameplay est brutal et intense. Thumper ne s‚Äôembarrasse pas avec l‚Äôhistoire et se concentre sur l‚Äôexp√©rience et sur les sensations que le joueur va avoir et il faut dire que de ce c√¥t√©-l√†, le pari est gagn√©.

Concernant les graphismes, l‚Äôensemble est tr√®s color√© et surtout psych√©d√©lique, mais il n‚Äôy a pas de faute de go√ªt et Thumper propose une belle palette graphique et c‚Äôest du tr√®s bon travail de la part des d√©veloppeurs. La bande-son est comme l‚Äôensemble du jeu, minimaliste, mais coh√©rent avec les variations d‚Äôintensit√© qu‚Äôoffrent les segments ¬´ tr√®s speed ¬ª de certains chapitres.
 
√Ä chaque fin de level, un boss se dressera devant votre passage et pour le tuer, il faudra taper sur les cases dans un rythme bien pr√©cis pour d√©bloquer un tir qui tuera √† force de r√©p√©tition le vilain pas beau se dressant sur votre chemin. La dur√©e de vie du titre d√©pend tr√®s clairement de votre niveau et de votre dext√©rit√© avec vos paluches manette en main, mais compter en moyenne 9 heures pour arriver au bout de l‚Äôaventure.

√Ä mon sens, le jeu ne poss√®de pas de d√©fauts √† part son prix relativement prohibitif et 20‚Ç¨ sont, je pense, un poil trop cher, mais il est √©vident que pendant les soldes de Steam, Thumper va certainement faire un vrai carton en termes de ventes. C‚Äôest √©videmment tout le mal que l‚Äôon souhaite aux 2 d√©veloppeurs qui ont r√©ussi √† sortir un jeu compl√®tement barr√©, mais vraiment r√©ussi‚Ä¶
‚Äã
Pour ma part, c‚Äôest l‚Äôun de mes coups de c≈ìur 2017 sur PC.

Un gameplay qui secoue 
Vitesse d‚Äôanimation qui pulse

Belle direction artistique 

N√âGATIFS :
Manette obligatoire 

Thumper est une belle claque vid√©oludique.

Aside from that - the game will take you about 9 hours to beat - far more than I expected to spend playing the game , I also see myself going back to this game, to improve my scores and play the brutally tough PLAY+ mode.

Pros:
Good visuals 
Good music
Unique VR title (so far)
Simple graphics settings and easy to pop the headset on and just play

Cons:
Occasionally feels slightly out of sync on my computer
Music could have a little more variety.

The heavy music and the abstract, dark art style complement eachother forming not just a very fun game, but a legitimate piece of artwork. The game is divided into 9 levels and each level is split into a couple dozen pieces with a smooth transition between each piece. Every level brings new mechanics that are so good that there is a desire to finish a level just to see the next mechanic. The game is actually easier than it looks, but it is still definitely far from easy. Every obstacle is fine-tuned to match the beat of the song not only by the sound it makes while crossing the obstacle, but also the sound it makes when spawning. In VR, despite the very erratic nature of the game, there is absolutely zero motion sickness, because, technically speaking, the VR camera is stationary and everything moves towards the player. The checkpoints always come on time, none of them feel spaced too far between eachother. But, it is actually easy to miss the checkpoint, which, even though the game still saves, does not get the second health layer back if you encounter an obstacle before.

In conclusion, this game is highly polished and definitely worth buying even in full price. It is very fast paced and hurts your fingers eventually, but that should definitely not deter you from this amazing experience.

 It is a very well made game, however, the audio ques for the action commands are flat bad. They do not stand out enough against the very basic beat to make it noticeable when you need to do something at many times.

I would be trying to find the rhythm of a particular section and I end up memorizing the pattern by watching it and doing it over and over rather than actually feeling the beat of the music and reacting based on that beat. When the game is based off rhythm, this is not acceptable.

I still do not think this is a bad game per say, but there are just times when the rhythm part of the game isn't standing out enough to actually feel the rhythm and this is most likely due to the fact that there is so little actual rhythm music in the damn game. I went through a level and all there was in that level was a snare on a pattern that did not deviate at any point with the patterns in the level, to make it worse it was a boss fight. I did not enjoy that boss fight for any amount of time.

The game is good, but the rhythm aspect of the game needs to stand out more and the music needs to support it more otherwise it doesn't feel like a rhythm game, but rather a pattern recognition game.

Also the effect for taking damage is so distorting that it makes it very difficult to recover if you are in a hard section both with the way it affects the rhythm and the view of what is coming toward you.

The game is very much made for VR more than anything else. The view of the game is great and cool and all, but the rhythm aspect of the game (which is the entirety of the game's base purpose) isn't standing out enough to make it good in my opinion.

The instrumentation is the same throughout the entire game. It is always going to be the same metallic drum with an increased increment on the time. (1/4 time 2/4 time etc etc) Due to this the patterns, while increasing in complexity, are beginning to run together and feel the same after 4 levels. 

So after everything is said and done, the rhythm isn't good enough and standing out enough to make it a good rhythm game and the patterns, while they increase in complexity as the game gets higher in level, are very same-y throughout the entire game. The instrumentation is far below average for a rhythm game.

This is a game best suited for those with VR and no one else. I cannot in good conscience recommend this game for anyone without VR.",1490504980,1490507513,False,10,1,0.522368371486663818,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You race along a track and to the rhytm of the music have to perform maneuvers like evading bariers left, right, pushing a button the minute you reach a light on the track, jump and fly of a specific amount of time and block attacks.
The palette of these maneuvers becomes bigger and bigger as well as the the way the track shows itself. For example the track later gets multiple lanes that it counts to navigate on top of everything else.

It's perhabs biggest hurdle is this, the rather quickly surmounting difficulty. 

If you are not a fan off repeating the same stages again and again then i would advice to stay away since this will simply a big part of the experience and the nature of this game.

The difficulty offers also another problem, at least to me personally. Since you first need to get into the rhytms and immense speed in wich the game challenges you it is difficulty to pick the game up just like that. You will have to play the whole thing over again or it will take even more retries to get back into the rhythm and speed of the different levels.

The DDR craze along side Guitar Hero type games were never  really my thing. The last rythm game I was really impressed with was Pa-Rappa, its quirky characters and super memorable songs hit just the right spot. It's been a long time since that game, and I always wished something would impress me the way that title did for the rythm gene...enter Thumper.
Unlike Pa-Rappa there is no story, quirky charaters, or zany ass songs...hell its not even like Thumpers soundtrack could be considered a song, more like a drumtrack from hell (but still so good). This is Rythm at its core.
I'm only on the 3rd level as of now, and I can tell you its a white nuckle affair. Super trippy graphics play perfectly to a soundtrack to get your heart pumping, and controls that are spot on. I have read elsewhere that someone said there was  lag after an update. I had no such problems, everything worked great with my 360 controller.
People looking for more than arcade rythm game might look elsewhere. This is not a story driven game, nor should it be. When a game is this slick, gameplay wins over story. Its all about hitting the jumps, turns, and marked location with the correct presses of the d-pad and the A button at the right times. You don't have real freedom of movement, but soon in you'll realize you wouldn't want it anyways. You'll be too busy just trying to stay alive, and 2 misses and it's game over.

What I failed to ponder nor even question then however was what the game itself was trying to achieve. 

I purchased this game the year it came out and since then never gotten around to beating it. (Update, I just beat it. The final boss exemplifies the following more than I could imagine.) Not only is the game immensely difficult, requiring an almost inhuman reaction time and ability to ignore the blaring and abstract background at all times, but I genuinely cannot find a game that leaves me so mentally exhausted every time I give it another go. Its a cruel game. Sweat will run, joints will stiffen, and eyes will dry. 

Now I can forgive a game for that. I'm not one to back down from a grueling challenge, more on the opposite side in fact. The game is advertised to bring ""blistering speed, and brutal physicality"" and somehow delivers more than that. What I cant forgive is the description of ""rhythm violence: classic rhythm-action"". 

Thumper is not a rhythm game. That, or it lies just on the edge of the boundaries of what classifies a rhythm game. Its like someone that despises rhythm games set out to make one to hurt those that enjoy them. Normally when I play a rhythm game, I love getting lost in the music whilst focusing on the game play. The music in Thumper is droning ambiance combined with heart hurting drums. 

Layout of the obstacles in a level is constantly chaotic and can change pace faster than when you inhale when it happens. After every single level, I felt completely exhausted from the chaos I had went through only to find out that there was always more discord to come. The game is not nearly as reliant on rhythm as much as it is on visual cues. Sure, occasionally, notes spawn at a consistent rate. The time it takes to get to each one is the same. That is rhythm. If I just had more of that put through the game, I would probably word this review a bit differently.

Please don't misconstrue this, but Thumper is a really good game. I just truly don't see why this is classified as a rhythm game. Never once within the game did I have to rely on the sound to do well. Thumper is just a terrible rhythm game, and since the game advertises itself as such to a gross degree, It fails to deliver what it promises.",1490143635,1621357206,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I must admit, I am not a big fan of the soundtrack, not because it is bad, but because its not the kind of music I listen to. BUT it fits incredibly well and it is needed to create the package. And maybe that's exactly the success formula of this game: It is a perfect package.
The visuals alone are psychedelic and if you look at them alone without playing or hearing the music, it's nothing special. The gameplay itself is polished, but nothing that hasn't been done before. But if you take it all together, it's so complementary, that you get an truly awesome immersion.
The pure speed which makes the gameplay thrilling, the beats which lets you literally feel the track, the flow you get... I don't remember anything I can compare it to.

It's very addicting , beautifull and fun to play for numerous times.
For a Rythym game the soundtrack is also very innovative, because when playing the first level you kinda don't really know what to expect but think it's al fun and games but when the music builds up and delivers you those in game breakdowns and often weird structures, it also creates a new interest for people interested in musicianship from electronic to just acoustic/instrumental music in all forms.

It goes beyond the traditional design of using icons to tell you what to press found in games like Parappa the Rappa, Dance Dance Revolution, Guitar Hero, and Beat Mania. Thumper goes beyond it by telling you what to press visually. The ominous repetitive drum rolls give you the tempo needed for you to have sense as to what goes on, and the visual & sound queues come up just a couple seconds before they are needed to activate.

There is an awesome sense of reward if you land certain queues correctly, which may give you a shield if you don't already have one, to simply a neat effect complementing it with point multipliers. The boss battles could get intense and require several tries to beat them since that is when the queues become even more unpredictable but fair enough to queue you if you react in time.

At first my impression of the first level was ""Okay, this is kinda cool."" By the time I was on the third level the game began to get so difficult but was hooked at the sound effects, the combos that the game teaches you, original dark ambient/techno-ish soundtrack which progressively gets more complicated, and deceptively simplistic mechanical control. All these factors make you want to BEAT the level.

This is an AMAZING and REVOLUTIONARY game, giving you the right amount of difficulty and queue time to get better. Thumper should not be missed.",1490113453,1490113453,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Thumper is a game developed and published by Drool

Thumper offers an unbelievable soundtrack. It is extremely original and amazing. The visuals are incredible, they are so trippy and immersive. 

Thumper offers a very challenging and intense gameplay, but it's fair and simple. There is no luck involved, just skill. The soundtrack, visuals, and gameplay are so good, it doesn't need a narrative.

The only issue with the game is the keyboard controls, they feel pretty awkward compared to a controller, to be fair they do recommend an XBOX360 controller from the start

If you like rhythm games, this game is a certain MUST. Between the incredible soundtrack to the amazing visuals, Thumper is a nice tight package of a game that requires a lot of skill

But when you beat that boss that's been killing you for past three hours, the feeling is so damn good 

Prepare yourselves for the best space rhythm battle of your life!

This rhythm game cares less about the music you're trying to match and more about whether you survive its onslaught or not. Each level is an endurance test laced with adrenalin and boss fights with only slight breathers sprinkled in. Between that and it's very surreal visuals, it's a brilliant jump-start to the senses and one hell of a substitute for caffeine. 

Having said all this, wait for a sale. $20 is a bit much for a game that stops varying its obstacles mid-way through and the faster it gets, the harder it becomes to tell what's ahead thanks to the visuals becoming a blurred mess or red and silver. (This is why you don't speed, kids.) Not just that, but there should be a penalty for games that only offer health when you're playing well...meaning that you don't need the health when you're rewarded with it 90% of the time. Just adds salt to the wounds from crashing cus' one level is kicking your ass and you can reeeeeeeally use that health the game spat out last level. That fact is especially true in boss fights. The health refill only appears when you do a section perfectly the first time. The only way that system works is through trail and error and again, by then you generally don't need it when you're given it.

Another thing is by about world 5, the game gets hard. By world 6, you're expected to master everything, even techniques never taught to you. For example, you can bounce. Game never taught me that, but the game expected me to have perfected this hidden technique. You told me how to slam down on the ground from the air, why not tell me how to stay in the air? That goes double for those arches that appear long past your normal flight strength. I still haven't figured out how to get them cus' the game never told me.

Still, despite the grips, it's a fun curiosity that's worth trying. Where else can you go fight a giant devil doughnut?",1487965929,1487965929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I stumbled upon this game when I watched an unrelated Gaming Video with short scenes of this game spliced into it and knew I had to have it just by the looks of it, so I bought it on sale and haven't been disappointed.
Thumper is a rythm game. It's also kind of a horror game with lovecraftian themes. Controls are simple. You have a Stick with four directions and a button, the game throws you the beats and some obstacles and then it goes like this: *THUMP*---*THUMP-THUMP*--*CLING*-*THUMPdangdang*---*THUMPdadingSrrrrrrrrrrrrr*---*WUMP*. Or something like that. The game just feels great. I think what sets it apart from other rythm games is that it's not only important to hit the beat at the right time (the hit window is actually pretty generous) but also that you have to keep the button pressed to not crash into obstacles and release it at the right time to get the next beat. Then add some basic horizontal and vertical movement and you have a simple yet challenging and fun game.
The Game is hard but fair (in most cases, some obstacles you can't possibly see coming), you can repeat any checkpoint without punishment, if your reaction time is lacking you can always memorize the patterns. But you will still die a lot, because the game is fast and you only get two chances before you die. But the game also eases you into it, the first 4 levels are basically tutorial, Level 5 is where things get rough and you struggling just to survive.

It was at times a pretty frustrating experience, but also equally rewarding when finishing the last 3-4 levels. 

I must admit I bought the game mainly due to it's high praise on PSVR as one of the best VR games on that platform. I don't get it - there's NO VR element in it. You have no incentive to look anywhere but straight ahead.  You get the same experience by sitting close to a big stereoscopic 3d display.

If you're a fan of the genre, I reckon it's a must buy, but if you're mainly just looking for a great VR title look somewhere else.

Thumper also supports controllers, ultrawide resolutions and the HTC Vive. Runs surprisingly smooth, both inside and outside of VR and it's great performance seems very consistant.

I've only ever reviewed one other game and that was just to satisfy the steam community badge. Needless to say, this game exceeds my expectations- no this game has become [u]the standard, the pinnacle for VR seated experiences[/u]. I've had my Vive since launch and have played most everything room scale. I didn't think a seated VR game would even come close to the level of immersion experienced via other room scale games but this takes the cake. 

Gameplay - [b]10/10[/b]
While not entirely rhythm based, Thumper lends itself to a series of visual and audio cues to alert the player. Quick reactions, and keen foresight are needed to obtain the highest score for each level. I find myself replaying levels and checkpoints just to get the coveted S rank. Mistakes are pounded into you in Darks Souls fashion.  

Visuals - [b]10/10[/b]
Astounding, exemplary, beautiful. I run a GTX 1070 so there's no lacking in graphical throughput. That said, the visuals throughtout are as smooth as a car ride in the countryside. Despite being a roller coaster-esque experience, the visuals don't overshadow the sense of scale, and wonder as you zoom through the obstacles. The geometrical shapes and patterns accompanying the ride flow like a river. There are moments of muted austerity, which is then contrasted by an elongated grandeur. 

Sound - [b]10/10[/b]
Imagine laying down for an MRI. You're semi-naked in the patient garbs, and you're being slowly thrusted down this tube of magnets and xrays. The incoming radation that will blast through your body is unnerving at first, and you don't realise how it affects you until the doctor shows you your results. This is what the OST to this game does. It accompanies you on a journey and heightens your senses. Like laying there defenseless, you let it overtake you, embrace you at times. Harsh, almost industrial at times, but soft, and orchestral at others. Perfectly balanced for levels, and bosses. 


[i]Every sound, every light, every movement is orchestrated to provide a thrilling, terrifying, and mesmerising experience. [/i]

It was totally worth it. 

By far, the most unique rhythm game I've ever played. I mean, the closest thing I can compare it to is either Audiosurf or Amplitude (2015). But that's kind of a stretch.

First of all, the difficulty as you complete levels scales damn near perfectly. It introduces new machanics and controls as you go along just enough to keep it interesting and challenging without throwing too much stuff at you to deal with. 

It took me about 10-11 hours to beat all of the songs. Each song/level takes about an hour to complete, assuming you'll miss some sequences sometimes and have to start over at a checkpoint. I was worried that I wouldn't get enough playtime out of this game but even after beating it, I want to revisit the levels again and try to get an S rank on all of them. I can see myself getting another 5 or 10 hours out of this game easily. 

ALSO, it's VR supported. I don't have a headset, but you can bet your ass this is the first game I'd play if I got one.

In short, if your a fan of rhythm games or just experimental dark indie games, this is a must play.",1485894165,1485894165,True,5,0,0.5462837815284729,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
visually this game is like being on drugs or something. VERY psycadellic & trippy, looks AMAZING
music is good, lots of different sounds, and the bass truly does thump as you play
easy introduction and the difficulty scales well over time 
the freedom to choose how i want to beat certain parts of levels is very cool
replayability 9/10.. i find myself wanting to keep playing without too much frustration or getting tilted
leaderboards are nice, being able to see where you rank against your friends and the world
violent game, lots of crashing against walls and dark-heavy music, its not a feel-good experience (which is awesome)
runs smooth, with no glitches that ive seen, lightweight and small download

Cons:
sometimes the game starts moving so fast that you cannot simply play it, you have to die over and over to memorize sequences in order to get further. this is very frustrating 
the music doesnt change hardly at all, its the same stomping techno/breakbeat. and the sounds that the beetle makes never change
the price is too high at $20
for being a music-driven game the audio options are non-existant 

Overall I rate this game 8/10. This is some beautiful next level stuff visually and sometimes the beat hits really hard i find myself grooving to the music in my chair. I recommend Thumper to anyone that can spare the $20 to get it.

The pacing is perfect for new players (minus a single nitpick), the difficulty is astronomical in the later levels, but still forgiving in the sense that respawns are fast and the game is consistent (minus a single nitpick), and the music is pretty good.
Global leaderboards are a neat addition that give everyone a goal to reach for.
Fun game overall.

The single nitpick: the snakes in the later levels are inconsistent and too fast to react to, so they wind up being a kill point for every first run through a checkpoint with them. The solution to this would to be to make the snakes come in from the opposite direction that one must dodge to clear them, to clear up the constant visual confusion they come with otherwise.

Right now at level 6 there are only few inputs you have to get right. Up, down, left, right, with or without pressing button A.

I find this game very hard, because often I just don't recognize any rythm, that I could get in sync with. There are just so many Beats, Breakbeats, Off-Beats that I sometimes just play as well with the sound off. On the other hand it is still exciting to play. 

It can be frustrating at times, when you could swear you pressed the right Buttons at the right time and you die and you look at your hands and see your fingers still pressing the right buttons. But that might as well be due to input-delay (wireless-controller) or output-delay (sound).

I'd like to have some easy-mode, where you have more armor or larger time-windows for input. 
And I wished a hundred times to see a record of my play together with the input to see what went wrong.

The first few levels start off relatively easy, giving you warnings and prompts, and from then on game slowly eases you into a blender called rage and hatred. And by 'ease', I mean it throws you in at the speed of sound.
This is the most rage/depression-inducing, anus-clenching, flashy-neon game I've ever played (besides perhaps Hotline Miami, which I also recommend checking out), and I love it. I think.

Trippy and intense.

Positives:

I love it, Thumper is so much fun! The visuals are fucking amazing and its very fast paced. Once you get past the first few levels the difficulty spikes and thats when it gets really intense. Going for that S rank is what makes you strive to improve. Each level includes a boss with their own unique challenges. Theres also plenty of combos to do along with the pretty visuals to keep you entertained. As well as the amazing yet ominous soundtrack to keep you immersed.

Negative:
- Game starts off slow, doesnt get intense till lvl 5

- At $20 I would say its a bit overpriced, on the last deal it was a decent price

- Not a rhythm game as it states, just a few nice sounds when you press the corresponding key and it doesnt actually produce a continuous beat/song

-  Probably just on my end, but its prone to occasional crashes

- Prone to repetivity, but the intensity/difficulty redeems it a bit

Let me get the bias out of the way, I LOVE rhythm games. Nothing blisses me out more than getting to that place where the music is king and all you're doing is reacting to is. 
Thumper is a champion of this, like Rez, the trippy visuals only enhance what is ostensibly a largely audible experience. 
I tried playing this with headphones for a while, but cranked up speakers, ones with really good bass, is where it's at for this. You'll find yourself picking up audio clues all over the place to help you navigate the roller coaster.
A lot of effort was put into making the experience here viseral, this isn't a simple navigation of multi track mixing like in Aplitude or Frequency. This is a roller coaster ride of audio violence that lets you feel your mistakes. If you fail, you fail hard, with only one shield shell to make protect you. The checkpoint system is incredibly forgiving though, and with levels that go on upwards of 10 minutes or more, they're really nessesary. You can back out, and return to the part of the level you left on at any point. 
Right now, I can't find anything to complain about. Like all rhythm games, sync is important, so if you're playing on an HDTV, you might find a bit of lag between the video and the audio. For a game that requires such precision, it kinda does suprise me that there doesn't seem to be an input lag adjuster present in the game.

Words cannot do justice to the intensity of Thumper's gameplay. The visual/audio design is fabulous and will immediately make you feel its trademark ""rhythm violence"". The adrenaline really builds up as the segments get longer, faster and more twisty. And oh my god, the MUSIC. It just fits perfectly within this brutally psychedelic universe.

Hardcore. With its ever-increasing speed and rhytmic complexity, Thumper gets hardcore real quick, or surely feels that way. But never the wrong kind, the punishng, the restart-your-entire-level hardcore (unless you choose the Play+ mode). As challenging as they become, the segments are never unreasonably long and you get a checkpoint at the end of each one, with as many retries as you need.

Alas I never jumped on buying it until I managed to get a new computer which could handle the dang game but once I did, Thumper was one of the first games I played on it and holy heck is it good.

Now a word of warning. If you happen to suffer from A. Siezures caused by lots of flashing lights. B. A bad sense of rhythm and/or C. Bad reflexes then Thumper really isn't the game for you. Otherwise there is basically no reason to NOT buy Thumper. 

It's an incredible rhythm/action game and despite the somewhat trial and error gameplay at times it still manages to be INCREDIBLY satisfying when you manage to pass a section that gave you a particularly hard time (Looking at you most of level 4). If you're ready to brace yourself for the MASSIVE difficulty increase that happens at level 4 onwards then you'll be in for a real treat with Thumper. Just, make sure to play with a gamepad and headphones (like, seriously you'll be doing yourself a major diservice playing without either a gamepad or headphones)",1483844171,1483844171,True,4,0,0.528431475162506104,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Lovecraft's The Music Of Erich Zann. It's also an accurate review of Thumper, especially in VR.

""I heard a sound myself; though it was not a horrible sound, but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely distant musical note, suggesting a player in one of the neighbouring houses, or in some abode beyond the lofty wall over which I had never been able to look. Upon Zann the effect was terrible, for dropping his pencil suddenly he rose, seized his viol, and commenced to rend the night with the wildest playing I had ever heard from his bow save when listening at the barred door.

It would be useless to describe the playing of Erich Zann on that dreadful night. It was more horrible than anything I had ever overheard, because I could now see the expression of his face, and could realise that this time the motive was stark fear. He was trying to make a noise; to ward something off or drown something out‚Äîwhat, I could not imagine, awesome though I felt it must be. The playing grew fantastic, delirious, and hysterical, yet kept to the last the qualities of supreme genius which I knew this strange old man possessed. I recognised the air‚Äîit was a wild Hungarian dance popular in the theatres, and I reflected for a moment that this was the first time I had ever heard Zann play the work of another composer. . . .

Then I remembered my old wish to gaze from this window, the only window in the Rue d‚ÄôAuseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall, and the city outspread beneath. It was very dark, but the city‚Äôs lights always burned, and I expected to see them there amidst the rain and wind. Yet when I looked from that highest of all gable windows, looked while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the night-wind, I saw no city spread below, and no friendly lights gleaming from remembered streets, but only the blackness of space illimitable; unimagined space alive with motion and music, and having no semblance to anything on earth. And as I stood there looking in terror, the wind blew out both the candles in that ancient peaked garret, leaving me in savage and impenetrable darkness with chaos and pandemonium before me, and the daemon madness of that night-baying viol behind me.""",1483781626,1483781626,True,5,0,0.60012352466583252,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Despite being heavily minimalistic in its controls (WASD + Enter/Space), this game has a whole lot to offer. Stunning visuals and a creative art style, an addicting audio atmosphere and so much to learn. Thumper nailed the art of having a well-shaped learning curve by being beginner-friendly at first and making it more and more difficult over time. I was never frustrated by this game.

I have also played the first levels with the HTC Vive. It worked seamlessly and looked fantastic.

While the game is a rythm game, I never feel like I can get into the rythm like I can with most rythm games. I need to constantly  use my eyes to figure out what is coming next, with the rythm providing only a tiny hint of timing.  Even still, the game often repeats the same subsequence in the game several times, so you can learn it that way. But I never felt really into the music, and the music generally isn't that pleasent, I can hardly call it music at all.

But certain actions are much more difficult then they should be, specifically pounding. A few bosses require the pound move to complete, but I could only get the pound move to work around a third of the time. When a boss required several pounds to be performed in a row, I ended up repeating that section several times (for at least 10 minutes) before being able to progress. At that point, the boss became boring. He could not hurt me because his attacks were trivially easy to dodge, and I could not hurt him because I could not pound consistently.

Visually, the game is quite breathtaking, but you can't really stop to enjoy it.

Man muss dem Spiel etwas Zeit geben, die ersten beiden Level sind noch Lernphasen mit moderatem Tempo, danach zieht das Spiel aber ordentlich an.
Sch√∂ner Schwierigkeitsgrad, fordernd aber nicht unfair. Wenn man stirbt, wei√ü man immer genau was man gerade verbockt hatte. Wenn man es durch hat, lockt noch ein ""Spiel+"" Modus, der noch mal eine Schippe drauflegt.
Es gibt auch keine Techno-H√§mmer-Musik, sondern der Soundtrack ist eher atmosph√§risch, und geht mit dem Level mit. Kommende Hindernisse werden per Audio angedeutet.

That being said, it does feel fair. Every challenge ahead makes a sound that alerts you it's coming. You need to follow these cues, and you need to practice to improve your reaction times and learn the layout of each section. It's more of a memory game than anything. Practice makes perfect.

Now, about Thumper being an ""existential dread"" game?

'Presentation' is usually a secondary goal for Rhythm Action games.  It's generally considered to be of critical importance that the track is readable and consistent.  Thumper says that ideaology is bunk and and puts presentation front and center.  The two major consequences of this are that it 'feels' really good to play when you are in the zone and doing well.  There is a lot of visual reinforcement for nearly every action and it really is a pretty unique experience in the RA genre.  The other consequence of this is that any kind of mistake generates a lot of implicit punishment.  That visual reinforcement becomes visual noise that you have to see through to try and recover.  The audio stutters and breaks when you make a mistake, making it that much more difficult to find your flow again.  Whether or not you doing well, Thumper is a noisy game.

This kind of presentation extends to effects where you do things right as well -- 'Thumping' on a gem from the air (An action that is not only good, but generates a bonus for the player) causes the track to stutter for an audio effect and generates a big graphic that ripples along the entire track, distorting it all along the way.  Coming from a more traditional Bemani line up of games, these kinds of effects feel extremely disruptive and I honestly shy away from doing them lest I generate more noise in an already noisy environment.

The contrast of the world doesn't help.  Often times you'll find gems on the track colored bright blue, along with the rails, the background and some of the 'tunnel' objects.  It makes parsing the screen pretty difficult at time.  The contrast of the track 'notes' ranges from acceptable to very questionable throughout the game.

Beyond that, there are a handful of track layouts that are borderline not fair.  You don't get a reasonable amount of time to actually react to some elements, specifically some turns that come out immediately after another turn.  These are pretty rare, but encouraging memorziation as part of learning a track is generally Not Cool‚Ñ¢.

I'm ragging a lot on this game and pointing out stuff that irked me some, but I think it's as important to note that I really do enjoy this game and in the whole scope of things, the game is very nicely polished and delivers a truly unique experience that moves the needle in an interesting direction for the RA landscape.  I can't wait to check it out in VR!

I've played it exclusively in VR, and it's an amazing experience from that angle. 

However, where it really suffers is the soundtrack. For a rhythm game, the soundtrack is *essential* and unfortunately, this game's music really disappoints. It is, for the most part, monotonous droning and repetitive, overcompressed cinematic-style drumming, interspersed with synth drumkit samples as in-game sound effects. ""Overcompressed"" is really the important takeaway. There's hardly any dynamic contrast anywhere, and the mixing is middling at best, with hardly any lows and a heavy top end that only distracts from the in-game sound effects. I played the game with my sony MDR-v6's and then listened through the OST again on a pair of DT 770's to see if it improved outside of the game, and it was actually worse, as the best low-end actually came from one of the in-game effects.
While I think the style of the music is promising outside of this context (with a bit of mixing to get the drums more into the foreground), it doesn't fit the fast-paced rhythm game and only serves to detract from the experience.  

Spiel out of the way, this is still an excellent game, especially in VR, as the visuals are absolutely amazing, and the rhythm components are quite well executed despite the mediocre backing music.",1483080572,1483080572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As the pace and complexity picks up, so too does the tension - and that feeling of tension is increased by the creepy, drug-trip-gone-wrong visuals and 'thumping' (see what I did there) industrial soundtrack. 

As the game got tougher (I'm on Level 4 of 8 and it's already hurting my thumbs) I found myself barely even consciously registering what I was doing and reacting subconsciously to the audio and visual cues - this is usually what's referred to as a state of 'flow' and I've never had a game induce this feeling quite as much (I would say Super Hexagon comes close).

Above all else, the game feels finely-tuned and very well thought out, every level slowly ramping up in difficulty and adding new concepts in an almost seamless way.

Thumper is a game like no other, honestly I haven't seen anything like it.
The way the Developer described it is the only real way to summarise/categorise this game; Rhythm Violence.
It's Utterly Violent, without there being any real form of violence.  It's anxious, it almost forms this fear within you that you aren't going to be quick enough to react to it's lightening quick obstacles.  However after a few levels you will start to get the hang of the Rhythm, you really listen out for the audio cues that alert you to which action you need to perform next. 

Aside from the overall gameplay and sound, the game also has really nice visuals. They're crazy, unrealistic, neon, glossy and Psychedelic.  This game really sucks you in, its hyper immersive in that fashion, You intentively listen to every audio cue, you wait almost painstakingly for the next obstacle to appear.

There's absolutely no variety to it, it's extremely overpriced, and if you're looking for a rhythm game, you might get sick of Thumper really quickly. Why? Because it's not a rhythm game as far as I'm concerned. There's absolutely no structure to the ""music"" you're playing, so the early levels revolve around you listening to audio queues that come a bar before the note they correspond with. It's a game of call and response, kind of like Simon, but on rails. After a few levels, the audio cues become completely and utterly impossible to decipher. Then Thumper becomes a game purely about memorizing the most boring and repetitive levels I've ever seen in a rhythm game. The boss fights are all identical. The levels are all identical, with identical music. The visuals are impressive until you realize that there's no variety to those either. Every level looks exactly the same. This game looks, feels, and plays like a procedurally-generated game, but then you get to the end and there's no more.

Maybe if the game had gone with a more readable art style (as opposed to the twisty-turny tracks that are constantly preventing you from seeing what's ahead), maybe it wouldn't be so frustrating. When you fail, it's not because you didn't stick to the rhythm or you made a mistake - 90% of the time, it's because the game decided to make you take a sharp right immediately followed by a note you couldn't see and an audio cue that you can't fucking hear. 

The game's not buggy or broken, it's just an interesting experiment that makes too many missteps for me to enjoy it. I'm a lover of rhythm games, I'm a fan of quick-fire high-difficulty challenges, and Thumper seems to provide both at first glimpse, but it soon becomes a struggle against trial-and-error level memorization and a control scheme that works against the game's fast-paced nature. The music is good, but it's not good enough to be reused on every single level with no variation apart from the nonsensical rhythms you're beating your ship against. Wait for a sale if you're still interested, the game's worth money, it's just not worth the asking price and the game has a disappointing amount of variety. No alarms, no surprised.

I'm by no means saying this game is not worth your time, but the price is a bit much for what you get if you do not have a VR headset (which I suppose is the target audience). This game is fun when it works, frustrating when it doesn't. It's hard to explain the difference but I'll try to summarize it because there really isn't much detail to get into.[/strike] I've completely changed my mind, because of the few mechanics added since I last played. I was avoiding adding time due to how Steam refunds work but now there's enough for me to jusitfy the $16 I spent. I would still recommend waiting for a sale however if it's above this price.

Sometimes the game gives you great visual/audio cues as to what you need to do, and sometimes it basically just throws additional steps that are not telegraphed at all and you need to rely purely on reflexes. I have no clue if that's me missing a cue, if it's intentional, or something else, but it's frustrating when it does happen because it doesn't feel like I'm the one who messed up, although I very well could have. Tunnels limit how far you can see ahead, and since walls don't have a significant visual cue you'll end up getting hit a lot in a way that feels more cheap than fair. 

The game looks great but you can't enjoy the visuals without messing up, so that's just annoying, and I can't imagine playing this in VR without dying constantly. Some level segments will instantly segway into the next one, meaning you cannot look at your score/rating without immediately missing something. This just seems like an oversight and I question why it's in the game. The 2x score indicator is also distracting but I might just be nitpicking (I think you can disable this by turning the entire HUD off but haven't tried).

My largest complaint is how hoops work, because they're so frustrating I might end up refunding the game because how agitating they are. They're so bewilderingly fickle I actually think they might be broken. In order to break hoops, you must press A and IMMEDIATELY hold up on the left stick, something that feels like it doesn't work around 20% of the time. There's also a mechanic that enables you to hit buttons by slamming down on the left stick, which ALSO only works around 20% of the time unless it's a scripted part of the track. It's almost like they didn't expect you to do this unless it was clearly indended by the obstacles. It's so much fun and I want to love this game but it ends up being more frustrating than enjoyable for me, maybe I'm just bad but man I cannot play a full level without feeling cheated at least once.


If this was baseline $15 maybe, but $20 is a bit steep for how basic this game is at its core. Far be it from telling people how to price things, I don't think I'll get my money's worth though. This game is far from bad, but I do NOT understand the overwhelming praise it seems to be getting.

Without a doubt, it's one of the most visceral music experiences I've had in a while, including live concerts and all the harmonix games as well.

There are only 9 ""levels"", but each level is based on different time signatures, making each one feel unique and even if played perfectly, they each can be a good 20-30 minutes a piece. Very hard, but very addicting, combining the percise input needed from Super Hexagon with the ""runner"" style made popular from Audiosurf.

I purchased specifically to play in VR as soon as support was added by the developers.  Something is very strange with the stereo rendering in VR.  The near track and bug look 3D, but the track in the distance becomes 2D, and every boss battle looks like you are staring at a 2D cinema screen up close, with the boss showing as a projected movie.  And when your bug explodes, debris close to you again looks 2D.  This sadly detracts from the game in VR, and at one point I was trying to fight a boss with one eye closed to try to fool myself into ""believing"" that everything was actually in 3D.  The game could have been amazing in VR, but this strange 2D-ness totally ruins it.  From the Discussion page, the devs are aware of this, but seem to suggest that there is no possible fix and that it is a failure of VR as a whole that far away objects look flat and only object at a virtual distance of 1 to 3 metres will ever look 3D.  I am really not sure this is the case, given a large number of other games made for VR (as opposed to having VR bolted on a 2D game like this) work fine, and so as it stands I cannot recommend this game for VR.

The simplicity of the graphics is frequently overlooked as you're dazzled with a myriad a blazing light shows and particle explosions as you race down the runway with no intention of stopping. I was especially impressed with the unique take on button presses for a music and rhythm game. You'll find yourself holding down a face button while quickly pressing, and sometimes holding, a directional button in rapid succession in response to cues on the runway; The button presses feel visceral as they're translated to the onscreen action. Make no mistake, this game is also relentless with it's difficulty ramp. It starts out fairly simple with timed button presses and a single path along the runway, but it takes a bewildering nosedive the further you progress. And it's awesome. Checkpoints are generous and each level is broken up into two or more dozen sections that climax with a boss encounter. Getting an S rank on every section is a fantastic challenge, and with enough practice you embrace the cacophonous percussion, entering a Zen-like state with perfectly timed button presses. The addition of VR makes the atmosphere and sense of scale appreciably more intense, and it's my preferred way to play this game--but certainly not required--as the game is excellent without VR.

This is definitely a fun and interesting game but ultimately could really have used more models and textures and more general weirdness.  Even in its current form, its worth recommending, but it helps to ignore the hype and keep expectations reasonable. I went in with pretty high expectations from all the hype and was somewhat disappointed, but its still a good and fun game, just not a great game.

From a gameplay perspective, its fairly twitchy and it hits difficulty ramps quickly. 1-13 took me 4 or 5 attempts when 1-1 to 1-12 were very easy for me.  I also had a little trouble understanding what the controls on the screen meant. ""R"" isn't press right, its trigger on the right Vive controller, for example. The game also started behind me when I launched it which took a minute to figure out, so I may have missed some intro elements. Games starting behind you or displaying critical text off screen in VR is inexcuable  this late in the game. Not sure why this is still an issue with some games.  

I am anxious for someone to get this genre right in VR. I imagine if the dev group that made this had 2x the budget and 2x the time they could have really filled it out more.  As-is its kinda thin.

The music is pretty catchy, groovy with a tribal/ambient feel to it, which is a nice change from all these melodies you get in similar games, though it could use some variety. The controls aren't too simple, not too complex either, but still pretty intuitive, with a quick and pleasant learning curve through a subtle ""tutorial"".

Everything is balanced in the oh so right ammount, and it's a breath of fresh air among typical video games. Graphics and the art are also pretty cool, plus, they do not require an overkill gaming PC. The gameplay, the patterns and sound effects feel really good, it's just immensely satisfying. Thumper has it all and is perfectly designed, you don't get that feeling of terrible repetitiveness many games like those leave you with pretty quickly.

Thumper is one of the most intense and beautiful games I've ever played. It's got fantastic art direction; the graphics make it look like you're traveling between universes, and combined with the music it creates an incredibly tense atmosphere as if some kind of eldritch beast might jump out at you at any moment. My personal favorite part are the bosses: their design is often so incredibly weird and unique (ranging from the giant head forecast in the trailers to what appear to be sentient wormholes) that it makes me want to see more. 


So what's bad about this game? In short: the gameplay. 

I haven't played many other rhythm games, so I can't exactly compare, but I found that this game became damn near impossible around level 4. Specifically, the final boss of said level. In the levels leading up to it, I could [i]eventually[/i] beat them by meticulously memorizing the pattern over the course of fifteen minutes and ignoring most of the obstacles. That isn't an option in the boss levels. Combine that with the nearly split-second timing required to hit some of the panels and the fact that, because of a bafflingly bad gameplay decision by the programmers, you're not allowed to switch rails while holding the space bar, and by the end of level 4 the game has become, as far as I'm concerned, borderline unplayable. If it weren't for the existence of footage of people beating the later levels, I'd accuse this game of being literally unbeatable, especially since it appears to continue scaling in difficulty at the same rate. And that's a shame, because the atmosphere and music are spot on; this is an absolutely fantastic game in every area [i]except[/i] the gameplay.

Could be an isopod with wings, could be a sci-fi bullet, or it could be a scarab, but whatever it happens to be, it loves its hotwheels track, and prefers to stick to it.

Controls are hyper simple and the game doesn't lie to you when it claims that the controls are 'a button and a stick. Because of that and as it goes, they can crank up difficulty by having some curves tossed in. Yes these curves and and will kill you, and as such, this forces you pay attention only to the track itself, so that you can not die long enough to die to the boss, which is a crying shame since the world around you is a living thing with pulsating shapes and colors, not dissimilar to your friend on news years eve at 9 PM. 

The bosses, as well as foes in general, are cut and dry basic geometric shapes with what appears to be tenticles to at least some degree, but they merely exist for show. You damage yourself, rest assured. The bosses and other foes puke up the hotwheels track you exist on, and present you times to damage them, but not before throwing in a curve or two, or some toothpicks for you to dodge under. If you fail to press the button at each 'damage time', however, the entire course will reset. Again, keeps it predictible which isn't a bad thing, but after a while it stops being a pleasure and starts being some mumbling about that toothpick that keeps killing you.

All damage periods, and curves corralate to the beat of the music more or less, and said beat can only be best appricated with a pair of bass boosting headphones, of which I do not own; because the beat has to resonate, and replace your heart beat, so when you force your metal thing to die, you will too, but in real life, and only once.

The game is unforgiving and yet checkpoints are aptly placed; just enough to force you to try, but not so few that dying is a major set-back. Its quite rewarding to get everything right the first time, and its entertaining to see that triangle writhe in pain as you fling green balls of bile deep into the center of it. 

It just gets irriating fast, I'm afraid. Naturally if you die on a set of track, the track doesn't change, so the game remains predictible in that way, and after hearing the same few sets of the same electronic song, it merely gets old. 5 years a second old. 

I'll be continuing this one.

I really like Thumper, it's an amazing and intense game, but you shouldn't buy it expecting a game like Guitar Hero or Rock Band. It's not a rhythm or music game in that sense, it has a much heavier emphasis on fast reflexes. The player character (the beetle) should usually be thought of as playing an accompanying instrument, not directly matching the background music. [i]This isn't a problem with the game, it's just important to have the right expectations before buying.[/i]

If you're having a hard time, here are some pointers:

- Don't aim for high scores the first time you play a level, you'll probably just get frustrated. After playing later levels your reflexes and instinct will have become so sharp that you'll be able to come back to earlier levels and ace them without any need for memorization or restarting.

- Turn up your speakers/headphones. This will allow you to better hear the audio cues that come in advance of many obstacles, especially corners.  It also helps makes the game even more enthralling and gets you into its rhythm.

- As far as I've played in the game, there have [b]never[/b] been two turns the same direction in quick succession (within a half second or less). It's always Left-Right or Right-Left, never Left-Left or Right-Right. If you see a turn in one direction, be prepared to turn the opposite direction immediately after. I also haven't seen an obstacle aside from turns that require you to hold A+Left or A+Right, so there's probably no harm in just immediately holding the opposite direction after completing a turn to be sure you aren't surprised.

- Once you get good at jumping/flying and landing, this is often a much faster way of hitting beats that come in quick succession compared to just hitting A as fast as you can. Later in the game (level 5) it's virtually impossible to hit every beat without using this technique.",1481905446,1482350423,True,0,0,0.449892193078994751,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Thumper is a unique rhythm game, because it's not actually a rhythm game. How? Rhythm games, like Audiosurf and Geometry Dash, follow a specific pattern to follow a soundtrack or song. In Thumper this is not the case. Thumpers soundtrack (DLC) is only a base of the beat YOU have to create. Another difference is the the fact that this game is pretty violent. Not by blood and gore, but by the sheer intensity this game has. The beat definitely has an ""oomph"" to it. It sounds like you're going into battle with a war drum on your chest! 

For anyone who likes these types of games, this is for you. But be warned though. This game can be raging, but since the tutorial is well laid out and gives you time to master the basic skills, you'll fling through the levels in no time! But, of course, the developers know this, and the levels they made will test not only your skills, but also your reflexes. What I'm saying here is that Thumper can be healthy for you, because by the time you finish the game, your reflexes will be a lot faster, since everything happens so fast.

I imagine this game will be more favorable to you if you are musician with fairly decent background, as the game moves VERY quickly and if you don't anticipate the rhythms in odd sections (offbeats, leading beats, complex meters) by eventually catching on to the pattern, it will feel somewhat random.

Gameplay/challenge: This game will best suit you if you're a fan of hard games as this game is VERY challenging and beyond that has an EXTREMELY high skill cap if you are going for a high score. That said, the game is fairly well designed and will teach you new techniques and patterns in isolation before mixing it in with other stuff. Checkpoints are typically frequent, so you will slowly progress if you keep trying, although you will certainly not hit any great grades if you do this without trying to master each segment.

Music: But seriously, get this game. The soundtrack is very intense and has a great weight to it. Stylistically, think of it as playing a whole rhythm game where the soundtrack is pulled from Invader Zim industrial background music with a modern twist. The sound effects when you properly hit notes just *feel* powerful, and you'll find yourself pressing the controller and stick much harder than you probably need to on occasion as a result of its weighty feel.

Visuals: This game is BEAUTIFUL and visually is one of the most impressive I've ever seen. Seriously, just look at any of the screenshots. The game looks like that ALL the TIME but with nonstop motion added and constantly shifting colors. It feels like a drug trip without drugs and tends to intersperce calm sections where you just appreciate the scenery with the brutal sequences of rhythm.

TLDR: High challenge/skill cap for perfectionists/twitch games, mind-boggling visuals, gripping gameplay with an equally gripping industrial Zim-esque rhythm soundtrack, bonuses for trained musicians who like mixed meter.

I was wrong.

The more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is.

[h1] Overview [/h1]

This rhythmic violence game is so vibrant & aesthetic that it comes with pleasure, pain, eargasms, serizures, and thumb aches. Its got it all!

The controls are pretty basic. You make use of the analog stick and a single button on the controller. You combine and use a mixed array of combinations to hit notes, slide, jump, etc. Don't underestimate it cause it does get challegning over time, thus despite the intuitive and simple controls, the game does increase in difficulty as you progress.

The game comprises of 9 levels and has lots of sub levels with a boss in one of the early rounds and another at the end. With achievements to collect and S ranks to achieve, the game has great replay value. The developer recently introduced a new mode to the game, known as "" + Play "" that's a lot faster, unforgiving and frightening with no seconds chances for mistakes made.
 
Thumper has won  8 - 9 awards and still is anticipated to win many more. The VR comptability is on its way and will be freely patched into the game. 

With or without VR, the game is completely worth the price tag for that which it's offered considering the time of release and the adrenaline fuelled joy it packs.


[h1] Tips to savour the game to the max [/h1]

~ Make sure to raise up the volume in the settings menu in the game to the max. 
~ Wear headphones / earphones.
~ Turn off the lights and play in the dark. 
~ Use a controller for optimal experience. [spoiler] Keyboard works just fine too though.[/spoiler]
~ The game gets really intense after reaching Level 3 , so consider 1 and 2 a warm up.

[h1]Warning: [/h1] 

Those with a history of epileptic seizures should stay away from the game and also kids, stay at school, weed kills brain cells and drugs will destroy your lives.

Don't think of it as a rhythm action game. Think of it as a bloody good game.

I haven't felt this much thrill while playing a game in a very long time. The controls are tactile. The music is phenomenal. The visual is just out of this fucking world.

not the kindest or most gentle of masters (although it did become more forgiving of players' mistakes, especially those going for the s rank, by allowing one to replay the previous checkpoint, something which was not possible when the game released), thumper won't really take you by your hand and proceed to calmly guide you through its many obstacles and thrills: it will, instead, grab you by your wrist and speed ahead, not very concerned if you are able to keep up, occasionally slapping you in the face. stick with it, however, and you will start doing things you likely didn't think yourself capable of. and it will be amazing.

The gameplay is the most unique I've played this year, it's unlike any other rhythm game I have played. I expected something similar to Audiosurf, but that assumption was blown out of the water when I played the first level. One button and one stick sends your chrome-clad space beetle on its way careering down its metal track into the unknown whilst encountering harsh conditions along the way. You get a sense that you will never know what will appear next in the game due to the different rhythms that will batter you, and it will always keep you on your toes.

It goes without saying, but with a tagline of ""rhythm-violence"", this game is hard. It's going to force you into a sense of rhythm and will make you good at the game, whether that means dying countless times. At the end of each level you'll have a massive head looming over you, throwing beats your way hoping to kill you in the process unless you smash the four glows without error. Getting them all and delivering a supercharged shockwave towards the demonic head gives you the sense that you perfected the level, just like getting all the notes right on an instrument. But knowing once you get good at Thumper, and that you can perfect that one level you had trouble with ages ago with ease, just like perfecting a piece of music, you feel that nothing the game can throw at you will stand in your way. 

Visuaully, it's astounding for such a limited-ish game: my little space bettle shining in its full glory down the track (with no video settings at that) adds to the simplicity of the game comprised of a long metal track, a massive circle unforgiving of your mess-ups and the right-angled turns make for a simplistic but nonetheless aesthetically pleasing visual style.

The sound design in this game is quite simply untouched. The soundtrack is extremely unique with higher levels composed of their respective time signatures, so level 5 is 5:4 and level 7 is 7:4. It really does spice up the gameplay making you consider the different rhythms that will come later in the game. With a vast array of elements like audio cues, bassy thumps and the squeaky clank on a perfect turn, it makes for a flawless augmentation onto the science fiction-esque OST.

With the addition of the Play+ mode, it has kept me on edge every single time with the sense of annihalation if you slip up twice. No going back. I managed to complete Level 8+ in one sitting without dying, and it was the most heart pounding moment of this game yet. Knowing that I could die at any given moment after being stripped of my chrome armour, getting especially tense during the appearance of the ""Ring of Death"" hoping to tear you apart on any miss on multiple lanes. Horror games can boast their jump-scares and scary monsters in the dark, but can't compare to Thumper's bleak, glooming atmosphere and the sense of not knowing what's coming next.

There are only one or two cons I feel I should mention. 

Sometimes, the beats that the game throws at you can be extremely unexpected and often land on the off-beat of the music, which can make it difficult to get into a real flow of the game. This mostly happens in levels 5, 6, 7 and 9 where the game speeds up and gives you less time to think about the music and make it more about quick reaction. However, these levels have irregular time signatures so that may be a factor. 

It's got a slightly high price (¬£15.99) , which is pretty uncommon for an indie single-player game. I would have expected a price closer to ¬£11.99 because there are many other games which offer more content at a lower price, but the game is still definitely worth it at ¬£15.99 and has offered me close to and imminently upward of 40 hours with the score-attack replayability of its levels.

Ahead of you are a series of glowing lights on the track, followed by several consecutive curves, more glowing lights, floating rings, translucent tendrils, then more glowing lights. Boom. Boom. Boom. Ching. Ching. Ching. BoomBoom. Schick. BRAAAHHHH. Boom Boom. The beat perfectly complements the hellish music which accompanies you on your seemingly endless journey through the depths of interdimensional cosmic hell.
 
A smile emerges on your face as you feel a shiver go down your spine. Awestruck and wanting more, your knuckles go white as the next series of glowing lights approach.
 
The gist of the game is fairly simple: as you travel down the track, you must hit a button in line with the lights on the ground, and occasionally you lean/move in a given direction when appropriate. The stages start out simply enough in the beginning, with new mechanics like flying, multiple lanes, and oncoming enemies being introduced every so often. The difficulty rises gradually over the course of the first 3 levels, but then takes a sharp spike upwards at around level 4, where the increasing speed and introduction of new mechanics begin to take their toll. It can be frustrating. But each failed attempt brings you closer and closer to finishing a stage, which serves as a teacher that prepares you for the iterative mechanics of each subsequent stage.
 
Although punishing, Thumper becomes increasingly rewarding with each level of mastery you attain. The ranking system is simple enough, with ‚ÄúS‚Äù ranks being essentially perfect runs, ‚ÄúA‚Äù ranks being great runs, and so on. However, the skill ceiling seems to be so absurdly high that, at a certain point, even an ‚ÄúS‚Äù rank doesn‚Äôt necessarily feel good enough. There‚Äôs always a turn that could‚Äôve been executed better. There‚Äôs always a series of beats that could be more rhythmically pleasing. Thumper has a surprisingly effective carrot-on-a-stick that extends the replay value almost indefinitely as you strive to get a ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù on every turn and rack up the multiplier while simultaneously crafting a beat that sends a feeling of frisson down your spine.
 
Part of what makes Thumper so great is the fact that you aren‚Äôt just playing along with the music, in most cases you are actively contributing to it.
 
As a fan of the ‚ÄúNoise rock‚Äù band Lightning Bolt I may be a little biased, but Thumper‚Äôs soundtrack is phenomenal. Created by Lightning Bolt‚Äôs Brian Gibson, it is a cacophony of sound that engulfs you in its unsettling embrace of booming drums, shrill screams, and foreboding drawn-out soundscapes. It‚Äôs something that works in unison with the gameplay so well that the development process and unification of the gameplay and audio seems deserving of a documentary in and of itself. Text on a page doesn‚Äôt do it enough justice.
 
Visually, Thumper is nothing short of impressive.
 
The track you find yourself on loops back and forth, ascending and descending through what can best be described as interdimensional space. Flurries of lights, sparks, and other post-processing effects explode from your cute little beetle as you interact with every beat and curve. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, mastering mechanics makes things even more overstimulating. If executed properly, a flight-beat followed by a down-beat combo will shoot a ball of light that travels ahead of you down the track, illuminating other beats, killing tendrils, and creating the illusion that it created the track‚Äôs curves up ahead. Chaining these sorts of combos together multiple times is easily the most overstimulating and satisfying experiences you can have in any game. Objectively.
 
Despite not being a fan of other rhythm games, Thumper has been the single greatest unification of music and gameplay that I have ever experienced. It‚Äôs frustrating and difficult, but in a way that drives me toward perfection. It‚Äôs overstimulating and chaotic, but in a way that induces a trance-like state. It‚Äôs chaotic and violent, but in a way that shoots a cosmic beetle through the mouth of a fiery hell-skull. Thumper is amazing, and it‚Äôs something that deserves to be experienced as a whole. In all of its unsettling, heart-pounding glory.

Although I'll [i]try[/i] to be unbiased.
As a side note, I play rhythm games a LOT. I'm nowhere near the best, but definitely not the worst.

In short, if you rhythm games and twitchy gameplay, you should get this game. However, I would only recommend the full price ($20 USD) if you see yourself going through and perfecting the levels, as it is only 9 levels. Otherwise, wait till it goes on sale, even if for $15.

Now for a little more depth.
Visuals:
OH MAN. When they add VR support (as of November 30, it's been promised in a future update), I'm tempted to pick up a headset just for this game. It is BEAUTIFUL. The entire game looks like the screenshots, but even better. And since they made this game for PSVR, it is optimized to hell and back. For comparison, I've got a Radeon R7 370, and its running 1080p, 4x MSAA at a smooth 144 fps.

Audio:
I'm suprised I haven't gone deaf playing this game. I just keep turning it up louder and louder to get enveloped by it. And the soundtrack starts out so simple, but by the end, you are being borderline assaulted by noise, and it's everything I could ever want. But that's just cause I love the tribal feeling. It's very high quality. The composer knows exactly what he's doing.

Gameplay:
Okay, so this is where everyone seems to be torn. The problem is, I wouldn't necessarily call it a rhythm game. More like an [in]finite runner where all the obstacles happen to be on beat. Sure, it is ""call and response"", but towards the end, everything becomes so chaotic, you can't really hear the ""call"" anymore, and you have to rely on sight. Which is also hard, seeing how fast-paced it gets, and how it starts hiding things behind corners.
Anyway, I would liken the feeling towards being in the rhythm section of a band. You gotta keep the beat and listen for what's coming next, but be ready for anything. You get in the zone, and feel what's coming next.

All in all, this is an amazing game, that's hard to pin down. I was a little sad about the length, however with the PLAY+ update, I've got much more reason to keep playing and keep perfecting. I would definitely suggest trying before buying, unless you know you like these kind of mechanics.",1480533379,1480533379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You are a space beetle that thumps on pads to dark industrial / percussive beats and its so satisfiying. I will just say if you do not get this game you will never experience the epicness of it and missed out on a GEM of this century.(its that fun)

Now what I love about the game is that you get to explore different time signatures each level and the track is literally coming out of the bosses MOUTH thats so hardcore lmao.

Thumper is a rhytm game based on sound AND visuals.

You must follow the rhytm pattern by repeating a sound sequence (for things that aren't visible from distance and appear), and at the same time be ready to react to obstacles visible from afar.

Some people find this game not very rhytm based because of the chaos, but that's what I like about Thumper the most - finding a pattern in adrenaline rush, when you hear and watch closely.

As you progress through game you learn new tricks that can be used in earlier levels to earn more points - those tricks were there all the time, you just didn't know about them (no need to ""unlock"" them). So I recommend to play a bit instead of trying to complete it all S from the start.

This is the kind of game where blinking can have devastating consequences, and successfully completion a section will produce an audible sigh of relief. 

It departs from typical rhythm games in that it's not really based around ""songs"" so much as a call-and-response system, focusing more on reaction time and twitch reflexes. Although I probably won't be listening to the soundtrack too often, the music/sound effects are brilliantly designed and really add to the physicality of each action, and helps create the psychedelic musical hellscape that is the hallmark of the game.

The game ramps up in difficulty as you progress through it's 9 lengthy courses, but thanks in part to its generous checkpoints it never gets too frustrating. The difficult part is then trying to perfect your play and climb the online leaderboards, especially in the recently added ""Play+"" mode which is even faster and has no checkpoints.

Equal parts endless runner (think BitTrip) and classical rhythm game, it blends the parts with a smooth and slick aesthetic that has no peers in its choice of style. The visuals are just gorgeous, and never has any game looked smoother. The HUD (or to be more precise, for the most part the lack thereof) serves to further immerse in the abstract and hypnotizing environments.

The music (some would probably debate it can even be called that) is brutal, visceral and driving. You don't feel the rhythm, you become the rhythm. You lose yourself in the thumping or you crash and burn. 

And oh will you crash and burn, time and time again. The difficulty is no less brutal than the acoustic backdrop, but that makes progress all the more satisfying. Being able to switch between different buttons for the main input button after a recent patch is much appreciated, because the thumb used to play it tends to mirror the tenseness of the experience.

One often-raised complaint is that the game is not a real rhythm game, and relies more on reflexes and memorization than on rhythm. I simply cannot fathom how people arrive at this opinion. Every obstacle in the game has a precise audio cue beforehand, and every single note is placed with enormous care to fit perfectly into the rhythm of the track. That rhythm may sometimes be weird, and confounding, and at times even infuriating, but it is absolutely there. When missing a lot of notes, it can feel like it is purely random noise, and relies on reactions alone, but that is definitely not the case. This becomes apparent if you push through and start actually nailing difficult sections and suddenly it all fits together like a well-oiled machine. At that times the rhythms turn from chaotic and mindboggling to intricate and mesmerizing. 

The musical landscape (hellscape?) created by noise-rock veteran Brian Gibson may not be easy to stomach for some, but it is apparent that this was exactly what the developers were aiming for. The game projects a tremendous feeling of unease and nervousness. It pushes just the right buttons to make people feel uncomfortable, but at the same time it pulls you in with its spiraling visuals and its enthralling industrial-tribal thumping sounds.

This is one game of very few that managed to take one simple concept and distill it to its purest form, and that form is glorious.

Addendum: VR support makes this game even better. In VR, due to the increased immersion, it becomes an almost medidative (if straining) experience. Very much recommended to try this out if the chance presents itself.",1480018166,1511682650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm a musician focused on drums, I love drones and dark ambient, I love the demoscene, I loved guitar hero, I love bullet hell shooters and masochistic difficulties, the list of reasons I should love this game just goes on and on. But I really don't.

Instead, Thumper is a slog to play that deals less with rhythmicality than rote memorisation. It goes out of its way to screw with any accumulated sense of rhythm over levels that take far too long to complete to ever want to return to (upwards of 15 minutes each). 

A gimmick of the engine is that every successful interaction the player has with the game triggers percussion, which means if your rhythm is off, the triggered sound is off too. The background audio functions as a sort of metronome intended to give you something to correct to, but the audio mix reduces that beat to a noisy growl under the din of your own off-center beats, meaning as levels increase in intensity your own off-ness creeps into your entire performance: Since the beats sound ""right"" to you but are in fact off by some margin, you slowly but surely creep closer to the offset where the game determines you straight up missed it. Among the reliable beats are the turns (which go off when they must as opposed to when you turn), but the levels of syncopation and sections of silence mean they are about as useful as a person next to you randomly bumping into you as you play. It's just maddening.

Thumper at its highest intensity (if you're not counting the endless rinse-repeat memorisation of drilling down a checkpoint until you perfect it) boils down to reading audio tells, but again the audio mix fails it. The thing about such a noisy soundscape is you run out of room to communicate with subtlety in the high frequencies. I never got comfortable with the tells for the elevated notches for instance (I was surprised to find out they even have one), and the game frequently sends you through turning and twisting tunnels depriving you of any visual tell to go by. No audio mix options to tweak the game to your own system exacerbate this.

The biggest failure of the game, IMO, is in its inability to build and sustain a rhythm, opting instead to give you frequent bouts of silence and random bouts of syncopation. It doesn't matter if you've a looping drum roll going in the background if the actual beats you have to hit on top of that are so haphazardly placed you are almost never allowed to ""get into it"". Add to this the game's love of animations and audio cues that don't have bearing on the rhythm whatsoever (the beetle hop when you release the boost is a constant annoyance for me) as well as frequent messing with time (recovering from a collision and other slowmo) all go into removing any pleasure I could get from what could otherwise be a pounding and satisfying drum session. Instead levels on first encounter are 15-20 minute grinds followed by further grinding checkpoint by checkpoint to build ""mastery"" that really just comes down to remembering patterns. It just goes on and on and even at its best I don't think it's rewarding my time. Halfway through *level 5* I was just exhausted. No thanks.

Thumper is too long, too repetitive, too random, poorly mixed, with a confounding scoring system.

La pista de infinita de Thumper brilla entre explosiones psicod√©licas mientras nosotros, un escarabajo plateado, avanzamos a trompicones a trav√©s de un universo cercano a la concepci√≥n que un Peter Gabriel en los noventa muy puesto de LO MULTIMEDIA tendr√≠a del infierno. Bajo esa apariencia inmaculada, donde la suciedad no existe y la m√∫sica solo insin√∫a, se nos pide alcanzar un estado de sinestesia, que asimilemos, aunque solo sea un instante, el total de lo que all√≠ se nos ofrece. La diferencia, la gran diferencia de Thumper con propuestas similares, es que al alcanzar el nirvana a trav√©s del flow que genera cada uno de sus elementos, no encontramos una apacible sensaci√≥n de tranquilidad, sino que nos asomamos a un abismo mucho mayor del que insin√∫a esa pista de la que no podemos escapar.

He tenido que pasar varias horas con Thumper para entender las razones por la que desde Drool lo anunciaban como un t√≠tulo de violencia r√≠tmica. Tras este periodo no creo poder dar una explicaci√≥n exacta, pero les puedo asegurar que he pasado, al menos, tanto tiempo pensando en Thumper como jugando con √©l. Buena parte de esto creo que tiene que ver con su envoltorio, no ya est√©tico, sino mec√°nico.

Thumper es eso, o al menos lo es de una manera que no puedo calificar de otro modo que abyecta. Hay algo inc√≥modo en cada pulsaci√≥n. Puede que se deba a que no hay un ritmo claro, que vaya desde el juego hacia el jugador, sino que en cierta manera lo va creando el propio jugador por s√≠ mismo. Este cambio, de experiencia dieg√©tica a extradieg√©tica, mantiene el permio entre los reflejos y la capacidad de predecir el siguiente movimiento, pero a√±ade un elemento de ansiedad de que va m√°s all√° de no acertar en el momento correcto con la pulsaci√≥n exacta, pues requiere un reaprendizaje constante de las reglas de este extra√±o universo.

La otra pata sobre la que crece esta violencia r√≠tmica es la representaci√≥n de nuestras acciones dentro del t√≠tulo, pues realizar correctamente cada una de las combinaciones no obtendremos una respuesta emocional tranquilizadora, sino cargada de intensidad, la cual se siente a veces casi como una agresi√≥n a la propia representaci√≥n de Thumper. No es por tanto la cl√°sica representaci√≥n de una prueba de habilidad que en base a nuestra pericia nos termine otorgando una puntuaci√≥n m√°s o menos alta, aunque esto tambi√©n se encuentre aqu√≠, sino que el concepto de juego r√≠tmico deriva en un t√≠tulo de supervivencia en el que nunca tendremos muy claro si somos nosotros los que estamos sobreviviendo al universo de Thumper o √©l a nosotros.

La confianza de Drool en su propuesta y sus ganas de realizar un t√≠tulo que escape a los c√°nones del g√©nero tiene su m√°xima representaci√≥n en la selecci√≥n musical elegida. Antes de poner mis manos sobre el juego me preguntaba por qu√© trat√°ndose de un t√≠tulo r√≠tmico se estaba hablando tan poco de la m√∫sica de Thumper. No sab√≠a si ser√≠a posible incluir un listado externo o descargar nuevas pistas. En definitiva, buscaba otro Audiosurf con un escarabajo metalizado. La respuesta te la da el propio juego, pues la banda sonora se construye a trav√©s de una partitura que va modific√°ndose, acort√°ndose y alarg√°ndose seg√∫n avanzamos. Una tormenta industrial que no teme descargar su ira a base de sintetizadores o moverse en una calma tensa que m√≠, al menos por momentos, me ha recordado a un Vangelis de bajona.

Lo dem√°s es arcade del bueno. Del jodido. Del de ‚Äúvamos a parar un rato porque quiz√°s acabe reventando el mando contra la pared y esto vale un dinero‚Äù. Hay decenas de obst√°culos, cada cual m√°s envenenado que el anterior. Hay enemigos, por supuesto. Enemigos que atacan y a los cuales √∫nicamente puedes golpear con una bolita que sale despu√©s de haber realizado una serie de combinaciones perfectas que pueden acabar con la paciencia de m√°s de uno. Hay una curva de dificultad perfectamente medida para que creas que siempre te encuentras el borde del desastre, pero sin embargo avanzas un pasito m√°s, y otro. La recompensa es m√°s m√∫sica, m√°s violencia, m√°s sentirte inc√≥modo mientras lo disfrutas a demasiados niveles como para intentar explicarlo.

Thumper es sencillamente el mejor juego musical al que he jugado nunca. Lo es porque ha conseguido que dentro del g√©nero no me haya sentido como una cobaya que ten√≠a que pulsar el bot√≥n rojo en el momento que se me indica para ganarme mi recompensa. Soy consciente de que eso es exactamente lo que hace, pero con la diferencia de que en esta ocasi√≥n tengo la sensaci√≥n de que el ritmo me pertenece, que puedo hacer algo m√°s que salivar cuando el cient√≠fico de turno toque el silbato, como por ejemplo arrancarle la mano.",1479933861,1479933861,True,17,0,0.710367679595947266,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Das beste Reaktionsspiel in meinem ganzen Leben
Der Einstieg ist intuitive Erkl√§rt und man Versteht sofort was man machen muss.
Die Musik ist richtig Fett und auch die Steuerung funktioniert wie man es erwartet.
Aber das geilste ist einfach das Spielgef√ºhl, man ist so voller Adrenalin gepumpt wenn die Musik spielt und man durchgehend alles Richtig macht und mit einer Geschwindigkeit durch die Levels fliegt, das ist einfach nur GEIL!!!
Man braucht zwar etwas Skill aber das lernt man schnell, die Lernkurve ist einfach perfekt, anfangs verliert man fast nie macht aber auch nicht die volle Punktzahl, und die sp√§teren Levels werden richtig mies schwer und man will einfach das Level schaffen.
Die Entwickler haben einfach das gesamte Spiel so perfekt vom Concept gemacht es stimmt einfach alles und f√ºhlt sich geil an.
Ich glaube ich l√ºge nicht wenn ich sage das hier ist das beste Musik/Rythmus-Spiel das es gibt.
Vieleicht werden einige die Musik oder den Still nicht m√∂gen aber dann wisst ihr es schon wenn ihr euch den Trailer anschaut.

It might be a couple of dollars steep. (12 hours for me to complete the game, roughly.) However, the game does offer a more challenging ""+ Playthrough"" if you are content with not beating your high scores.

- Very difficult game. The game trains you well and starts slow but, due to it's fast pace and execution, after a certain point in the game every stage is capable of challenging you. On subsequent playthoughs it won't be as bad because you will develop your muscle memory, but it is especially brutal for a Thumper virgin. Brutal but, very satisfying.

- Beautiful visuals. I decided to play this game after only seeing about 30 seconds worth of footage through a stream. Exquisite colors and effects bombard your eyeballs as you desperately try and keep your beetle alive through his LSD-esque adventure through space.

- Sound Design. Excellent sound. However, you might need a good headset or speaker system to make full effect of this. Thumper is a ryhthym game, and using your eyes is incredibly helpful at certain points in the game. At times you might find yourself blinded by the acid trip, and being able to discern what sounds are what DOES make a difference. 
DON'T RELY ON YOUR EYES TOO MUCH.

- Execution. You don't need to hit every obstacle to earn a good rating but, dropping a combo will hurt you. There are lots of little mechanics that require tight timing, though they aren't necessary for completion. For the most part you have a choice of whether to avoid *some* things, or to put yourself in danger for a big point bonus.

---

CONS: There are not really many actual problems with this game so they can likely all fit in 1 or 2 sentences.

- Sensory Overload. Sometimes you just won't be able to keep up with everything on screen. You need to keep your eyes open, ears primed, and fingers dancing. You may be blinded at one point, or unable to discern one sound from another, Or you can't execute everything, like hitting a hard combo in a fighting game.
- There is one aspect of the game that I'm still trying to figure out if it has a tell or not. Apart from visually discerning it at 100mph, lane switches are hard to see. That's about it.

I'm having some cognitive dissonance on whether or not to bash the game's difficulty in discerning sound, being a rhythym game. It can definitely be an annoying issue when considering how difficult the game can be. I'm going to leave it at this for now.

The controls are really simple (in fact, it could be played on an old Atari joystick if you were so inclined).

Pros:
Gorgeous
Great music
Love the audio cues before each thing (that fit with the music)

Cons (for some):
Can be visually tiring
Can be very demanding - will punish you if you're not there in the moment

Nitpicks:  
Had crashes changing resolution, then the game wouldn't start.  I deleted and redownloaded it and everything worked fine (including saved data).
The mechanic where 2 fast up+jumps make you stay in the air longer is not obvious.  If you are trying to get an S on 6-1 and can't get everything in the air, this is your problem.
Last 2 levels don't have the same feel as the rest of the game.  They aren't that hard though, so I can overlook it.  
The blocks with the green trails don't seem to behave differently than normal.  I'm still not sure what they're there for.

The more I played the game, though, the more I realized how it evolved from its rhythm based premise to a pure trial-and-error experience which - to me - is a big disappointment. 

If I had to judge Thumper on the first 2 or 3 stages alone, I would give it a positive review. It features beautiful visual and sounds, everything about the game is captivating, the game mechanics work nicely and you really feeling 100% immersed in the game flow. Unfortunately this changes over time. The stages don't get more challanging, but just more unfair, with incredibly harsh sequences that the player cannot remotely foresee. The vibe of the game becomes monotonous, the rhythms fairly similar throughout the entire stage. 

Once again, if you come with the idea of getting a good rhythm game, I would probably not advise you to get Thumper. On the other hand, if you think that you will only play the first few stages and you are intrigued by its beautiful audio-visuals, go ahead and get it, don't even hesitate.

It is without a doubt one of the best feeling games out there, it is incredibly tight, the controls are responsive, and everything works the way it should. The game only uses 2 inputs. the left analog stick, and a button (Use a controller, its way better), but the amount of complexity it manages with just those two inputs is staggering. Ill admit it starts off too slow, but after the first ""Level"" it ramps up beautifully. This is not a traditional rhythm game, the best way to describe it is a ""call and response"" system, credit to the other review I stole that off of. It matches to the beat, but isn't really a huge part of the song if that makes any sense. In fact that would be another gripe of mine, after the first couple levels the background music gets less interesting as it relies more heavily on you properly hitting the notes and beats. 
The game also ramps up difficulty very well, introducing not only new mechanics each levels but also speeding it up and limiting what you can see ahead of you through tunnels and such. You become less reliant on visual cues and more so on the actual sounds the game makes, which while they could be a bit louder clearly tell you whats coming.

Its musical and Rhythm aspect. Everything else about this game really feels great, but the audio cues being faint and hard to hear makes this game frustrating to play, and any mistake i make, in most cases, feel like its the game not giving me any warning at all to whats coming up, and it feels cheap and unfair. I don't mind difficult, i just want fair difficulty, where it was my mistake that made me lose, not the game just throwing something at me out of nowhere with no warning and no time to react.
If you don't mind a more visual focused rhythm game, in which incredibly fast reactions or memorization is the main focus, with a little bit of rhythm mixing in, then definitely go for this game.
I just expected the game to be more fast paced Rhythm and visuals mixed together, not Visuals with just a bit of Rhythm too it. Read the rest of the review to know why i expected both a Rhythm and a Visual game mixed together, and why the game is clearly marketing itself for being both.

Many rhythm games don't need audio cues since you can easily see whats coming up next, and basing yourself on the rhythm and beat, you can play whats coming up correctly. Examples would be: DDR (you see the arrows and know the rhythm so you know how to play them) Amplitude (You can clearly see all the circles coming up and what rhythm and order you have to play them in), guitar hero/rock band (similar to amplitude, you can see the notes coming up and know the rhythm you need to play them in and what order)

This games visuals make it very difficult to see whats coming up next, and things just pop up infront of you and give you only about 1-2 seconds to react at best. As such the developpers added ""Audio Cues"" that tell you whats coming up to allow you to listen, hear the rhythm and beat and what you have to do, and then go with it. The problem is that the audio cues are too faint and hard to distinguished and so, many times you get caught because you cant hear/see what you have to do and get killed in a cheap annoying way. This ruins the ""rhythm"" aspect of the game, and instead you have to memorize certain parts of the tracks since its just easier then trying to listen to what you have to do. I have played a lot of rhythm games in the past, and this game is really close to beating all of them. It just needs this one little adjustement and it would be absolutely amazing. instead it just ends up being frustrating and cheap to play.
If the audio cues were better, this game would instantly be one of my favorite rhythm games of all time. And right now, it still kinda is a rhythm-music game, it just doesn't do the rhythm-music part right.

I don't want the game to be easier, i don't want the game to change its own style, its a fast paced rhythm violence game. The problem i have is that the audio cues just mix in TOO much with the music in the background. While the visuals outright block whats coming up, most notably, in the tunnel sections, leading to some very cheap and annoying deaths that can only be avoided by memorizing the track. I can hear the audio cues sometimes, i know what they are, but if its going to market itself as, and i quote:
""Thumper is rhythm violence: classic rhythm-action, blistering speed, and brutal physicality. ""
(taken straight from the steam ""About This Game"" section,  ""classic rhythm-action is clearly stated here, and in the description aswell.)
then i expect the rhythm part to also be a major part of the game, and for it to be consistently clear and important. Its definintely trying to be, its just not succeeding at it. 

The game also has the Rhythm and Music tags to it, so you can't tell me its not trying to also be a rhythm game. I know its trying to be a mix of rhythm and bullet hell style, where things come at you in large numbers and quickly, giving you little time to react, but rhythm games thrive on having easy visuals, but difficult rhythms that are still clear. bullet hells are good at having really clear visuals that are hard to avoid. This game fails at both.
But it comes very close to doing it right, if steam allowed neutral reviews i would give it one, but it doesn't.
In the end you CAN go with the rhythm, but only after you've memorized the tracks already. You can't use both your eyes and ears to know whats coming up and then do it perfectly everytime simply because you're that good at music and reacting. In this game, when you get stuck in a tunnel, the audio cues are faint and hard to hear, so you rely on your eyes, only for the game to throw two sudden walls when you couldn't possibly see the second wall until it was already too late. And if the audio cue was just a little bit more obvious then it would be purely up to the player to hear it, realise what he has to do, and then do it in the rhythm of the song.

I cannot hear the audio cues and so i cannot do the right actions to the rhythm of the game because the visuals block most of what you can see at times. And so, its clear the developpers wanted to add something to fix this issue, which is the audio cues ive mentioned many times. But these are too hard to hear, to difficult to distinguish in the song, and so everything falls apart, the visuals end up being distracting more then impressive, the difficulty becomes more cheap then challenging, and the music aspect becomes more reaction based then rhythm based. One small change could make everything i've just mentioned worked.

Although I like music focused games, I don't think just putting a rhythm spreadsheed over existing written music can make an extraordinarily well designed game. And now here's Thumper, a game that looks, on the surface, a lot like Audiosurf, but at its core, it's something much, much different.

You're a beetle, riding down a lane with an ever increasing speed, having to dodge obstacles and trying to get combos by performing rhythmically accurate actions. It's so simple and yet so difficult. The difference to Audiosurf lies in the design of and the interplay between music and the levels. Everything is produced with the gameplay experience in mind. Levels build up on each other. Simply the fact that the time signature increases one beat per level shows how the developers intended to get a pacing into the game that could never be there with generative levels.

While I do think, Thumper hasn't realized its full potential and some improvements could have been included, I must say that I had tons of fun and even more tons of frustration just barely making it through the 9 levels alive.

If you're here for the high octane, ""game-feel"" defining gameplay,  and don't mind purely reaction-based stuff, this is your game.




I bought this game under the assumption that the focus of this game was rhythm. That's not the case, however. Where the game fails as a rhythm game, it succeeds as a reaction/memorization game. Though this game is SO frustratingly close to being an excellent rhythm game, there are a few details that keep it far from that title.


The visuals, while absolutely stunning, detract from the clarity of the game mechanics. Whenever you go through tunnels, the wall obstacles make the player turn a sharp corner, which prevents you from seeing obstacles that are around it. It also doesn't help when the color of the tunnel interior matches the orange glow of the wall; making it practically invisible. It cheapens the game's difficulty.


Absolutely none of that would be an issue if the audio cues that indicate which obstacles you'll have to avoid next were clear and distinct. They sadly aren't. They are unreasonably quiet, a fact that is painfully clear when the sound of dodging the current obstacle, plus the roaring tribal drums completely eclipse it. The cues also sound too similar to each other. When dozens of sound cues are constantly bombarding your ears, you need to be able to distinguish between them subconsciously. Vary the pitches, make the sounds have fundamentally different textures, anything you can to make them clear as crystal. The current system is simply too muddy to be useful at all.




All in all, if you like reaction-based ""endless runner"" style games and aren't afraid to do some track memorization for some of the S ranks, you'll really enjoy this game. This honestly may be one of the best ""feeling"" games I've ever played. Every time you clang into a turn or crash through a bar, it leaves a palpable and utterly satisfying impact. 


If you came here expecting a new rhythm game to grind at and master, you're gonna be disappointed. I really hope the devs touch up the game and really nail the little things, so you can play the game musically.  I can't help but feel a bit mislead by the ""Rhythm Violence"" tagline, as I don't feel it quite meets the standards of a  rhythm game. For me personally, it's not worth $20 in it's current state, that's the reason I refunded the game. I would be more than happy to re-purchase it when these issues are addressed or when the game goes on sale.

Edit: Dec/20/2016

So after I was done screaming of excitement over the VR support being added yesterday, I set my Oculus up again and (after makeing sure the seting for allowing unknown sorces use the headset to ON) I went from level 8-5 (which i had been stuck on for 2 weeks) to beating the entirety of level 9 in under an hour today (completion time aprox 25 hours)! If anything I think playing it in VR is.. Easyer in a way... But thats not bad! IT IS SOOOOO SURREAL! I've played 3 games in VR, War Thunder, Lucky's Tale and this... This is the best I've played! I love the new camera angle, it's almost like your sitting on the beetle!... RECOMENDATION TO ALL: If you have 300 bucks and a good computer, get a freaking vive or oculus and play this in VR you WILL NO regret it (but your stomach might! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) ) anywho Thankyou for makeing this game. It is truly somethin else.



This game is just... where do I start. The Graphics are amazing and simple, the color style is brilliant, and the gameplay... ohhh the gameplay. Ive got about 9 hours under my belt at the time of this review with about 8 levels done on Level 5 and at this point I can say is my favorite part of this game is the boss battles not just the final ones but the mini/mid bosses as well especialy with (i think it was level 3 introduces it) the Stomp 'attack' that is just sooo satisfying to do on the final 'cube' to fire a shot at the boss (the last little bit of the trailer shows this attack). I consider this game one with a rhythm that you can feel, one that sends chills up your spine every time you play it. Although one problem that i have.. its probably nitpicking but ill say it anyway, is also what makes this game good.. the speed.. yes this game is supposed to be fast but i sometimes find myself not able to keep up with whats going on.. and this is comeing from someone who loves speed games... but again its probably nitpicking anywho I give this game my final rateing of 10/10 (since my only complant is a nitpick) Buy this game and let your fingers impress you.. thats all i have to say, and if youre recording this for Youtube like I am... I recomend haveing a camera pointed at your hand.. a 'handcam' of sorts. I know I will",1477546982,1482266468,True,6,0,0.533856868743896484,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Plays well with keyboard and controller.

So, lets begin with the pros - a very interesting aproach to a rythm game which fully utilizes its one dimentional environment. The visuals are pretty nice, the space theme seems to suit this very well and reminds me of the original TapTap :). Adds lots of new obstacles as the game progresses, kepts it fresh.

Now, unfortunately the cons - the music is a bit too quite compared to the sound effects that you produce, in the first levels it isn't as noticable as in later levels where there are more obstacles. The music seems very very similar through out levels, and what slight variation there is gets masked by th esound effects. A lot of obstacle ""combos"" repeat, like ""long left"", ""long right"", ""long left"", ""long right"", these repeat on a lot of levels and get very predictable. Also the general route seems to be ""left"", ""obstacles"", ""right"", ""obstacles"", you rarely encounter more than 3 turns in the same direction in a row, so it is very predictable. Finally the thing I absolutely hate, why try to make a level harder by simply making it last ages? Also if you do intend in making harder levels longer, make them consisten, that is start with the shortest level and end with the longest (not counting ""bosses"", which are a very nice touch in my opinion). Seriousely, I currently just finished ""world 6"", and the fith last level (if I remember correctly) lasted a good minute, the next level over in 10-15 seconds. 

Overall it is a nice challenging game, the challenge curve was a little to small for my taste as I havent died once untill towards world 3 but enjoy the challenge that the game is presenting to me right now. I rate this as ""recommended"" as I enjoy the gameplay, the music is a HUGE let down, considering this is a music game but still.

Now that I've 100% the game's achievements I feel that I have enough knowledge of the game to review it.  First and foremost, playtime & difficulty.  It took me 9 hours to beat the base game and took 9 more hours to complete all levels with an S rank.  For the majority of players it should take you beyond that much time and may even take some less than that time.  I don't recommend the game for casuals as you'll die in two hits, there are ways that the player may choose to make the game easier but can still be hard to beat.  

Next, the base game.  You'll boot up the game, choose the first level, get a quick tutorial of some of the basic and most important mechanics and will then start to get into some regular levels.  Even though most view a tutorial in games as bad I feel as if it's really important here since without it you may not be able to finish it and will get frustrated.  It's satisfying to hear the loud drum percussion of each wall, red bar, and blue ring and also provides the player a visual heads-up so they can plan their next move (as is with most rhythm games).  Each Level has a boss and an ""Omega"" final boss with sub-levels inbetween.  If you are struggling with a section it's always safe to hold spacebar and preemptively hold the arrow key of the wall that you're approaching, thump pads and red bars, and blue rings that appear on the track are optional and can be avoided in sub-levels.  However, the level boss and final boss have green thump pads which require you to hit each one in order to deal damage to the boss, if one is missed the level will loop until the player has either died or successfully hit every thump.  The final level is not only incredibly challenging and rewarding when you beat each section but also has one of the best endings of any games i've experienced this year, well worth the trip there.

Secondly, S Ranks, and advanced moves.  S Ranks on sub-levels, boss, and final boss levels are reached by getting a large score percentage in each level, it's possible to miss some thump pads and get damaged on some walls and still beat a section with an S rank.  S Ranks are not easy, you'll have to replay a sub-level multiple times in order to achieve it but is an excellent challenge for those willing to attempt it.  Advanced  moves range from perfect turns, stomping, and kills.  Perfect turns are preformed by pressing the arrow key at the last possible moment before reaching the wall and is rewarded by a higher score and a satisfying sound effect.  As you start to feel the rhythm of the levels these will start to become easier to perform.  Stomping is achieved by pressing up and holding spacebar when reaching a thump pad and pressing down instead of spacebar when reaching another thump pad.  If your score multiplier is 2x or 3x (shown in the top right and plays a sound when reached)  The player will spawn a glowing thump pad which can restore your shield if you lost it and has a marginal difference in score gain then regular thump pads.  If you thump on a glowing thump pad in a sub-level the game will temporarily pause and spawn another thump pad, giving you a small amount of extra time to view the track so you can act accordingly to the enviornment. Tentacles growing on the track can actually be destroyed!  By stomping on any thump pad tentacles that are in front of you will be killed which both clears the screen giving you more vision of the track and adds to your score at the end (displayed by Kills x #).  

Lastly, issues and closing thoughts.  Two of my major gripes with the game is the lack of an option to display your score on the hud, and that [b][strike]you need to restart the level from the beginning if you get an A or worse while attempting the (All S Rank) challenge.  The game provides you with a quick restart button ""R"" which allows you to restart a sub-level but should provide the player with a way to re-do ""failed"" levels to not deliberately waste yout time and erase your progress.  This happened to me several times and would've completed every level with an S rank more quickly if the option to re-do levels was implemented.[/strike][/b] (SEE EDIT)  Overall I enjoyed beginning to end in the game, the game seems fairly linear and limited at first but will introduce new concepts and unique boss types/changing final boss that both challenge and interest the player.  I recommend the game particularly for those who are accustomed to and seek challenge and for those who would like to try a difficult game out.  Below is the S Rank for Level 9 for those interested (Spoiler warning)!

EDIT 11/4/2016: You can now restart from the previous sub-level if you get a score that's less than an S so I only have one gripe with the game now, it's a shame this change couldn't have come on launch day but it's a much appreciated and welcome change.  Good job devs!

Would recommend to anyone who's into rhythm games.   
Having said that, there's some minor problems that you should keep in mind before buying.  

- Thumper is designed around chasing highscores.   
The first reason is the way of ""clearing"" levels. You clear a level by reaching the next checkpoint, but this can be simply done by ignoring most of the objects and only avoiding real obstacles. All you need to do to progress, is to survive. This also applies to levels you'll face later on. Now of course this takes away the fun from a rhythm game and you wouldn't intentionally abuse this, but it will happen. 
The second reason is the amount of playtime needed to finish the game. After 6 hours I completed the game and all that is left, is to chase highscores on each level.   
   
- Some levels don't scale logically.  
The beginning is easy, the end is hard. But inbetween you might struggle on one final boss and clear the next with ease. The same applies to consecutive parts of a level. I couldn't help but feel like some parts were just added as fillers or simply placed in the wrong level.  

Considering that some aspects of Thumper could use some more fine-tuning, I would still recommend the game as a whole. But if you're not the kind of person who tries to get the highest scores, I'd suggest you wait until the game is on sale.",1477014331,1477014414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A niche game in a niche genre, to be sure, and while those who pick up the game casually might prioritize ""merely"" surviving checkpoint to checkpoint (a fun and very challenging task requiring a good ear and better processing speed/reflexes), the game is a scoring challenge at heart. The game becomes more about strategy and balancing risk/reward so one can safely complete an entire level while maximizing score without losing health, dropping a beat or having to rely on a checkpoint and losing score multipliers.

I think the reasoning behind it, was the track should be playable the first time you play. 
But in doing that, there is a lot of frustration comming from it, as you are constantly trying to appreciate the feeling of correctly playing the track, but at the same time concentrating on listening the 1 seconds offseted track you're suppose to play.
- The visuals effects are very annoying to estimate distance between you and the next ""thing"" you should tap onto.

There aren't too many mechanics to learn, but they are enough to keep things interesting throughout every level and for only using one button, they manage quite a lot.

Thumper has a ton of replay value too, given that you're ranked in every section of every level it does well to make you want that ""S"" rank, not only with the score but also when you hit every obstacle, it adds to the soundtrack, like a strange extra drum beat.

Thumper es sin duda, una de las grandes sorpresas del a√±o para mi. Hac√≠a ya un tiempo que no jugaba a algo que solo utilizara un bot√≥n de acci√≥n; todas las acciones r√≠tmicas se llevan a cabo con las direcciones y un bot√≥n. Es tan simplista en mec√°nicas que ni te lo tienen que explicar, enseguida entiendes el prop√≥sito.

Como juego musical r√°pidamente se conjuga con la acci√≥n: hay jefes, e incuso puedes matar fractales, tent√°culos y trozos de escenario haciendo combos. No sabes en ning√∫n momento si te est√°s guiando por el sonido, por la vista, o por la memoria (o todo a la vez), pues el ensayo y el error es necesario, sobre todo, si queremos la S, puntuaci√≥n perfecta. Para este prop√≥sito existen checkpoints al final de cada peque√±a fase o tramo. Hay 9 mundos subdivididos en fases, si mueres, reapareces al principio de esa fase. El objetivo es cruzar los aros intentando tomar bien las curvas, saltando los obst√°culos, rompiendo aquellos que se puedan, pulsando tambi√©n las luces del suelo, que son las que permiten que saltemos o matar a los jefes.

El juego adquiere un frenetismo y una exigencia muy alta ya a partir del mundo 6, a√±adiendo hasta aqu√©l reglas nuevas: cada mundo es como el anterior pero aprendiendo una nueva mec√°nica, que se conjugar√°n de foma endiablada ya por el final. Ojal√° bastase s√≥lo el o√≠do, esa es la mala noticia: Thumper no es un juego r√≠tmico sin m√°s. Es una aventura, una carrera donde la vista y los reflejos de tus pulgares es casi m√°s importante que lo que se oye. 

Los jefes son una aut√©ntica pasada: han creado un g√©nero nuevo con esto. Para poder matarlos hay que hacer las secuencias correctamente hasta que aparezca el disparador. A los 4 golpes, el jefe muere. Tu escarabajo cibern√©tico puede morir de dos simples golpes, pero podemos recuperarnos en ciertos puntos.

Thumper es el juego de acci√≥n perfecto camuflado tras una propuesta mel√≥dica. Es un viaje psicod√©lico y adrenal√≠nico por el surrealismo, mundos fractales, geom√©tricos y pesadillescos.

This is bloody brilliant.

It's one of the few games that I can see most people enjoying based on the gameplay alone, yet still manages to introduce something very alien and unique through its art (both in its audio and visuals).

The shortest description I can give is that it's something out of 2001: Space Odyssey? The weird part. The really, really crazy part.

And it's beautiful.


The game can get tough, but it never seemed unfair, to me. I really enjoyed the challenge and now I'm planning to go through it all over again several time to master it... why? Because the flow of the game is amazing. It's a rollercoaster, in many ways... But it's hard to judge it when you have to restart some levels repeatedly. I'm curious about how it would feel to go through it in one single run. ... It might take a while, though.


The music is very interesting, and probably not something for your mp3. Brian Gibson has a ""noise rock"" band, which is... noisy? The game itself is what I would call ""noise classical"", perhaps? Know the discordant violins in horror movies? That's a big of part of this.
The other part is the industrial/metallic tribal percussion.
It's strange, but it's perfect for the game.

The visuals are also very abstract and metallic, but very beautiful, in parts. Something harmonious, sometimes discordant as well. And always very alien.

The ""feel"" of the game is some of the best I've seen in any game... ever?
It's that good. If you string combos together, your hits become very powerful, complementing the strange rhythm of the music with the rhythm of the level, which are not always ""cooperative"".


I can't say much more about it, for now. But it's amazing!
If you're looking for a rhythm game in the vein of Guitar Hero or Stepmania, this is not at all for you. It's not about playing your own music... This game is its own beast. If you're not into its aesthetic (which I can imagine many people are not?), you will probably not enjoy the game very much... some people consider it all to blend together. I disagree, but I can see that happening, depending on what you're expecting. 

So yeah. If the videos seem cool, definitely get it. There's a lot more to the game than shown in the videos due to the visceral feeling and impact of the game.

So good!



P.S.: I've now beaten the game twice, to see how much it would change. On general terms, there's definitely replayability without wanting to climb the leaderboards. This is because you can still play the previous levels in a very different way by using the new mechanics that you didn't know when you first did the levels.
This can make some levels far, far, harder. But also much more satisfying! It's really cool to see how levels were designed in different ways depending on how much of the game you've played before.

The scoring system is also more complex than it first seemed.

There's a basic C-B-A-S ""rank"" for each sub-level, and then calculated for the full level. These mostly depend on your misses. S being for missing no ""Thump"".
You can't replay specific levels, at the moment, but you can restart the sub-level that you're playing. This means that you have to play the whole level from start to finish to get these rankings, but you can restart each one as much as you'd like before moving on.

The scoring, which will get you on the leaderboards, is where the real game is.
For these, restarting carries a penalty. So, to reach the top, you need to play every sub-level in a row, as well as you can, without restarting to get the optimal score for each one. It's a marathon, more so than a sprint.

I can see this being a somewhat controversial system, but I like it. It's the hardcore way to play the game, and I'm glad that there is one, rather than seeing how restarts the most.

For the score, you have to study the levels, somewhat, because of the ""stomp"" mechanic. On 2 consecutives Thumps, you can use the first to fly, and stomp the second for extra points. This is even more important in boss fights, where you're awarded multipliers for stomping the final thump (sorry for this vocabulary haha).

Aside from that, there are the riskier plays of trying to make a perfect curve, etc. (to get a perfect, you have a much narrower window to turn -- otherwise, you're dead).

It makes it much more interesting, choosing when to play aggressively or not, trying to get a good score. 


There's quite a bit of depth for those looking to climb leaderboards, so that's definitely another plus!


P.S.2: Consistency is way more important than I realized before. Each consecutive level you beat without a Miss gives up a 1+ multiplier. The same for No Damage levels. So your score really gets out of control if you can avoid missing/damage for many consecutive levels. It's good to keep the competition high!

One kinda big problem I have, though, has to do with the ""game feel"". I really like the whole impact the game conveys, but I think it takes a step too far by slowing down the game too much for give a very high impact in a long combo. This slow down actually throws me off completely, sometimes, because the rhythm breaks in these situations. So... you're expecting a certain obstacle at a certain time, but the tempo slows down a lot and then speeds up again. 
It leads to a rather inconsistent rhythm when you're actually doing great!
Which is a negative. Sure, it makes it harder to do perfect runs, but it essentially punishes good play? I would much rather have a lower impact in these long combos, but be able to keep the ""flow"", so to speak.",1476627119,1477582235,True,4,0,0.559716999530792236,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Why I don't like it: the fact that I can't ragequit by Alt-F4ing in fullscreen. Stressful, both mentally and physically. Call-and-response reliant, rather than actual musical timing.

Overall: recommended, since this is the kind of rhythm game I've been waiting for since O2Jam was deleted from the public consciousness.

Zu diesem Zeitpunkt, 3-4 Tage nach dem Release haben bis jetzt nur 1,7% der Spieler alle Levels geschafft (laut Errungenschaften).

Es f√ºhlt sich so gottverdammt gut an wenn die Eingaben aus den Fingern gleiten und man mit dem Rhytmus und den Effekten verschmilzt; Dieses Gef√ºhl hatte ich lange nicht mehr bei einem Spiel. Diesen Flow kenne ich bisher wirklich nur von Rhythm Games oder wenn ich Instrumente spiele. Von daher denke ich, dass der Begriff ""Rhythmus-Actionspiel"" ziemlich gut passt. 

Man misst sich √ºber Ranglisten mit der Welt. Die anf√§nglichen Level lassen nicht viel kompetetiven Platz, jedoch bieten die sp√§teren Level viel Raum f√ºr Geschick und Reaktionszeit.

Es gibt zwei handvoll Levels, die nach und nach neue Elemente reinbringen. Das Momentum f√ºhlt sich gut an und mit der Zeit kommen immer schwierigere Herausforderungen. Diese neu kennengelernten Elemente lassen sich auch in den fr√ºheren Levels integrieren - somit hat man einen Wiederspielwert indem man seine Punktzahl nachtr√§glich erh√∂hen kann. Zudem kann man die alten Levels dann in einem neuen Licht sehen. :c)

Thge gameplay itself is good, really good. The problem lays in the structure surrounding the good gameplay, the way they handled the gamedesign here.
Also i dont get why people call it rythm based, because i cant see that.
It is ""rythmic"", as in when you press the buttons at the right time it give sounds that make the game music sound rythmic, but its not really rythm based in a way that a track is played and you press the buttons in a way to reflect the music. 
Means, i couldnt find a good connection between the games music and the gameplay. Its not that there are beats or so when you have to press a button, its also not that you can try to listen to the music/sound and then find the best pace or pressing. So you have to rely alot on visual feedback, more so than on rythmic feedback. But because the game often is not only overloaded visually but also doesnt even show you what will come for the next 2 seconds and you have to do a hectic button press and hope for the best, this can cause problems.
In the end its not rythm based, but rather rythmic.
The visual overload can cause other problems aswell.
For example it suffers from a known problem of when you mess up one time you can throw the run often into the bin. You have two lifes in this game, so you can mess up once and also get the chance of regaining (health). But messing up once often just causes that you lose entirely.

This is supported by a large degree of graphical effects thrown at the player, together with narrowed viewpoints and two weird black fields that limit the screen on the bottom (i have no idea why they are there) and you can forget your second life instantly when you messed up once.

Positive:
- Fresh idea
- nice gameplay overall
- deep enough, although sometimes a bit too overloaded with stuff
- nice visuals, although at points too many effects and a weird narrow view that i dont really like and seems to not serve any purpose
- nice music 

Negative, i explained some bad points already, but this might be interesting aswell:
- not content rich, i miss different modes, especially an endless mode or a mode where you do all the levels mixed together in a different order, or a boss run.
- sometimes too effect heavy
- a bit bad camera view, especially narrowed by some black fields that have no point and can be very annoying
- its not rythm based, only a bit rythmic. You will mostly only realize that with stepping a bit behind the system.
- sometimes levels become frustrating, when obstacles are only spammed at you it gets a bit tedious and annoying instead of ""hard"".
- music becomes a bit onesided after a while. 
I fear it suffers a bit from not having a ""play your own track"" mode with trackgeneration.

But now the worst point, which pressed me to give it a negative rating although i had it on positive before and explains a bit the surrounding structure that covers the good gameplay in a horrible mess of design of progression and options:
You cant do a highscore run and get an S rating on every section without playing the level completely as a whole from the start. You just cant select a single section and play that (although they are there and also visible, you cant select them though). 
Thats extremely bad design and a bad decision. And the worst, you cant even set back to a previous section WHILE doing the level. 
Means, you do a section, lets say the second last section of the first level, you felt you did good and it was enough points-wise? 
You reach the goal of that section (a gate on the track) and hit the A button to gather the last point and lock the section behind you, then the points summarize and you see you got an A or even just a B for example. 
Well, yeah then your whole run was worthless, even though you had an S rating on the 20 sections before the last one. 
Oh you think you can press the start button and press ""load from last checkpoint"" so you get back to the start of the section and try it again? No, screw you player, you cant. 
When you gathered the last point and the summarize appears showing you your rating, the game treats it as finished and the ""restart from last checkpoint"" will only set you to the start of the next section (the last one in our example). Doesnt make much sense. Its not really a point of being easy if you could select a single section anyway.

The developers decided it was a good idea to not show you your rating until you cant turn back and restart it. And the real thing is, level 1 for example is basically easy, but even with practice you will screw up there sometimes. And the first level only has about 15 sections. 
Later levels will be 5 times as hard and have 25 or so sections. 
Again, you screw up once, you have to do it again. 
We talk about possibly an hour of investment here sometimes. So you can be perfect in the first 24 sections, when you screw up only one button press in the last one and you didnt realize your points werent enough to get you an S ranking, you can do it all over again. 
Thats tedious bullshit. 
Why not let me do single sections or a part of a level?

This ties in with another problem the game has. It might give you many different gameplay elements, but only in pieces. Means you start the game with the first level, teaching you how to press A and do turns in curves. 
Then level 2 teaches you a new element like flying, the next level teaches you the element of lanes and laneswapping. 
And so on. 
When you reached level 5 you have quite an arsenal of different things you can do on a track. Problem is, all the levels/section up to that point are not designed for the gameplay elements that come after them.
Means, Level 1 doesnt have any lane sections, doesnt have flying or whatever else. So it is limited to only doing the first basic things.

When you reach a point in the game where it becomes interesting, its already 50% beaten. 
And the real problem i have with that, that there are modes missing that have all the elements in them. 
When i want the full experience of the game, its worthless to play the first 4 tutorial levels, as they dont have all the elements combined in them. 
Thats limiting. 
And there are quite some nice sections in the levels. 
But they are so short or basically so easy, that it becomes boring fast.
I will finish the 8 levels in the game (yeah, 50% of those are basically tutorials focussing on one element) and then wait until they get new modes into it. 
I thought i could also complete the achievements and reach an S ranking for each level, but seriously, i value my time more and instead play something else, as not being able to select single sections becomes already tedious for the first 2 (the easiest) levels. 
And the fact that screwing up only once meaning all my time investment was worth nothing, gives me the impression that the game doesnt value my time.

Resum√©e: Sadly a good game not valueing my time enough with throwing BS design decisions at me and even taking on the challenge doesnt feel satisfying but rather annoying or frustrating. Theres nothing to unlock, i fear, content is baren and not really there now. 
It lacks modes and levels, especially some infinite or customized content. 
And at the time as the gameplay becomes interesting, its already over for 50% as the earlier levels arent designed for later gameplay elements (which makes no sense for me, they still could have included later elements there for players that want to use them for some score ranking).

Would have been better to have one tutorial level introducing all the gameplayelements and then have the rest contain all of it, instead of delivering it piece by piece.
Some sections are really nice to play and fun and cool to look at. But i dont want to spend 20 minutes to reach that point because they happen to be in the last third of a level.",1476461078,1476468253,False,11,2,0.401740521192550659,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The intersting soundtrack and abstract visual style contribute a lot to the game's unique tone. ""Rhythmic violence"" sounded like a gimmick to me, at first, but it captures Thumper frenetic gameplay to a T. Its visceral, fast-paced, and a lot of fun.

Perhaps the only drawback is the price. $20 ain't exactly cheap for a rhythm game, no matter how good. In its defence, Thumper has a substantial amount of content and replay value (perfecting each level, reaching the top of the leaderboard). It's also incredibly polished, and the hardwork that went into development is apparent. 

All in all, definitely give Thumper a try. Might wanna wait for a sale though if you don't have twenty bucks to burn.

*It's simply great fun to play

There is a purity to this game, and a demented visual style that does merit some comparison to Devil Daggers, although they are completely different games. I find I like them for similar reasons.

The rhythms in this game can become very challenging as more varied polyrhythmic syncopations are introduced in often acyclic sections, and the fact that, as another reviewer correctly observed, the level number is the time signature for the track. Level 5 is where it starts to get really tricky.
On top of this, there is a layer of arcade skill involved in mastering the gameplay to maximise score and take advantage of opportunities to recover health which adds an element of strategic play and risk-reward.

Despite not being a biggest fan of the rhythm genre, I did pay full price for the game and I regret nothing, but I could see how you might want it to go on sale if you're on the fence. It delivers what it promises and if you are a progsnob, industrial or mathrock nerd you will probably enjoy the technical challenge and angular beats that Thumper throws at you.

One final note about the soundtrack, it suits the game well and you might think a rhythm game would have a killer OST but the music is very minimalist, with the real ""music"" of the game being revealed by playing the levels well.

More often than not a rhytmic pattern is felt advancing somewhere outside the music. I was tripped up at first learning to play because I was trying to match the music timings to the rhythm pattern very directly and that's not how this works. 

So why am I rambling about all this? Because everything becomes a lot more fun once you grasp the concept of reaction time rhythms and syncopation.

The core of the game is the familar music sheet and note markers which players of the Rhythm Action genre will recognise, but the way this game riffs on the established conventions makes it something very special. The track you follow is the music sheet, and the player character is the visual marker signifying when notes should be played. Controls are very simple; a directional input and one button. You have 4 actions at your disposal, meaning there are 4 types of ""note"" to play in time with the music, these actions are: 

Thump - press the [Action] button when a glowing marker aligns with your character.

Smash - hold the [Action] button when faced with a set of barriers on the track.

Turn - press the [Action] button + a directional input at the moment your character encounters a turn.

Fly - pressing an upward directional input + the [Action] button on any note marker will launch your character into the air, where it can fly for a brief period. If you press a downward directional input while flying, you will activate an Aerial Stomp.

Basic scoring is determined by how accurately you enter the appropriate input when you meet a ""note"" on the song sheet, with a multiplier accumulating for long periods of perfect inputs and no mistakes. The beauty of this game lies in the arrangement of the ""notes"" and the behaviours they encourage from the player; you only have a small number of actions at your disposal but you must make expert use of combinations of these actions in order to survive the courses.

Where things get really clever is when you incorporate the Aerial Stomp into your game. Any ""note"" marker can be used to trigger flight, once in the air you can then Stomp downwards onto the next ""note"" of the course, the resulting shockwave is capable of breaking barriers, awarding health pick-ups and awards more points than a ground Thump alone. Once you get the hang of this mechanic, you start to think about and tackle the game's courses in a completely different way, constantly working out how best to maximise points.

It's a test of timing and patience. Despite the steep difficulty curve in the latter half of the game, nothing about the challenges was truly ""unfair,"" not even the laser rings which penalize (and damage) you for missing beats. Suddenly requiring perfection during a sequence may seem a bit extreme at first, but if anything, it's encouraging you to do your best. During tough sequences and boss fights, I saw and knew what it was that I had to do--I simply had to do it right, even if it meant dying multiple times. Trial-and-error became commonplace for me after a while, but it was never as though the game was throwing something impossible at me. Taking damage and dying can ruin the flow of the game, but again, that's just another reason to try harder.

One criticism--the closest thing to a negative--would be that, even though the game's visuals are slick, stylish, and great to look at, sometimes there CAN be too many visual effects happening on-screen to be able to focus on what's coming ahead. One or two bosses are practically exploding with color and bloom lighting, sometimes obscuring a fair amount of the oncoming track. It's tough to anticipate the red bars indicating turns when the boss is flashing red, as well.

The layout of obstacles in these levels will always be the same (meaning replay value will REALLY vary from person to person), so you won't see any sudden variation when revisiting them, but at least you'll have some familiarity when coming back to them to go for higher ranks and scores.

Most importantly, quality headphones or a home theater system are a must, not just for the sake of enjoying the music, but also for being able to clearly hear the backing instrumentation and sound cues indicating upcoming obstacles, so you'll be ready to take them on.",1476363636,1476363636,True,5,0,0.594399631023406982,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's fast, it's dark, it's extremely challenging, and it fills you with the feeling of existential dread with its presentation.  I've described it to friends as a ""Horror Rhythm game"".  The entire atmosphere, mixed with the fantastic ambient soundtrack create an incredibly unique play experience, which as you progress becomes more and more tense, as each level throws a new mechanic at you, and new ways to die, along with increasingly difficult combinations of acrobatics your fingers will be forced to learn to pull through the level.  In doing so, ever elevating that feeling of what I would liken to anxiety, as the music picks up and you become so focused that you begin to feel as if your life is at stake if you don't nail this next passage.

It's really rare I jump on steam to review a game this quickly after purchase, or at all.  But this game is an absolute must buy for anyone seeking a unique experience, and a new twist on the rhythm genre.",1476346769,1476346769,True,5,0,0.60458141565322876,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Grabbed me instantly. You're a metal beetle speeding down a path, and you can hit Guitar Hero style squares on the beats, hit the sides of the tracks in time to the music and jump over obstacles. But that's the simple version - the game quickly ramps up the difficulty with clever variations on the theme, and the whole thing looks like an abstract nightmare from the 80s with a rhytmic soundtrack that will pound your brain into submission.

It's hard to convey just how hypnotizing the experience is. Your beat-le (zingggggg!) just responds in that spot-on perfect way that is the hallmark of an extremely polished game, and every beat, jump and slide just feels exactly right. Combined with the ominous visuals and the fact that you're actually on your way to beat the **** our of a giant glowing skull at the end of the track, this becomes a truly remarkable experience. VIDEO GAMES, HOORAY!

I can't even begin to imagine how crazy this must be in VR.

After having finished the entire thing, there is no doubt in my mind that this is a masterpiece. Some people have complained that this is not a true rhythm game since it will sometimes throw unconventional patterns at you that seemingly don't conform to any meaningful musical beats, but for me, that is just a way of keeping players on their toes rather than simply memorizing everything. My only real gripe is that the visual and sonic chaos will sometimes drown everything else out, making it super hard to decode what's actually happening, but even so, my overall opinion stands. This game is so intense and so unique, it is without a doubt one of the best experiences I've ever had.",1476346242,1477856764,True,1,0,0.514449238777160645,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's brutal going, but totally worth it.

I've only finished up to Level 3, and I'm trying to focus on S ranks first (though I'm gonna change that moving forwards). However, with that mentality, there are two major flaws that get in the way of going for those achievements.

Firstly, a checkpoint pad counts as a hit, and if you miss it, you get an A rank for that segment and cannot go back unless you restart the whole level.

Secondly, why oh why is the restart checkpoint option in the menu so many button presses to reach? Devs, players ARE going to play the game just trying to S rank using resets, so just make it easier for us please?

Clearly the game is meant to be digested in one continuous run focused more on overall score, so I'm going to do that moving forwards and come back for S ranks, as resetting a dozen times for one segment certainly becomes a bit mind-numbing.

I can't even imagine how much more difficult things will get after Level 3...

[h1]GOOD[/h1]
[list]
[*]Just the craziest, beautiful art and animations flying in your face.
[*]Absolutely fast, thrilling gameplay that actually made me scream like I was going down a roller coaster at times.
[*]I adore the beetle ship you control so much. I'd love to get this as merchandise.
[*]The music is super bass-e and adds to the sheer terror of the gameplay. I hadn't focused on how my games were sounding for quite some time. I even had to plan out my day so I could play this before disturbing any neighbors and get the full enjoyment out my speakers.
[*]This game seasons you. I had an incredibly difficult time on most levels 4+ each time I first dipped my toe in, but coming back to them after beating the game made them a LOT easier.
[/list]

[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]
[list]
[*]I'm a bit torn about the difficulty spike starting with level 4 and continuing till the end of the game. Levels 1 - 3 were expertly balanced, feeling midlly challenging and intensely fun. These were the moments I most enjoyed. Levels 4+ REALLY run your face along the asphalt as you're bursting at 100 MPH. Additionally some of the sections, like the level 6 boss, feel just a tad on the brutal side that leave you more frustrated than anything else.
[*]This game can wear you out. More than any other game I've played in a long time, I can confidently suggest you take a LOT of breaks between levels or, hell, during a level.
[/list]

[h1]BAD[/h1]
[list]
[*]I would argue that some of the perspectives on your track and the visuals flying into your face INCREDIBLY hamper your ability to see things clearly. Especially during bosses the color of the surrounding area can really hide the thumps you're supposed to be 100% hitting, which is frustrating. Additionally getting hit once was almost always a death knell. The animation for getting hurt once, which is screen shaking and ship parts flying everywhere, means almost certain death if you're in an area where objects are coming at you at an incredible pace.
[/list]

[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]
Thumper is an incredible game that is thrilling, terrifying, tiring, and sometimes a little frustrating.

Thumper is a rhythm game. That‚Äôs all you really need to know, but it‚Äôs not all I‚Äôm going to tell you. The game would never allow me to get away with such a modest descriptor. It‚Äôs more appropriate to speak in intangibles. Thumper is anxiety. It is restlessness, wretchedness, abjection, pain, failure‚Äîand ultimately, hope and triumph. It‚Äôs a reflection of everything about yourself that you hope to never face, laid bare in the dark light of Hell. It‚Äôs what Franz Kafka might dream up if he met Trent Reznor and they invented their own programming language.  

It‚Äôs a damn fine video game, and I urge you to use this critique as a jumping-off point to do your own investigation (i.e. buy the hell out of it).

Thumper represents the next logical evolution in what rhythm games can (and should) be. Where Dance Dance Revolution celebrates the ecstasy of motion and flow, Thumper commands you to listen to the shrieking, clanging anxiousness inside each of our minds‚Äînoises that we‚Äôre unable to quell when the evening is upon us and we long for some peace and quiet. It takes a single mechanic and spins it into a tapestry of visceral destruction. It is punishingly hard, and it will make you wish you had never fallen under its spell.

There are many levels and the levels are long which is great, I've not completed it yet and loved every minute of it so far, at time of review I've got 11 hours so far.


There's a plus+1 mode but haven't tried that yet, just trying to get to the end of it right now.  Up to level 7, each level has sub levels, eg 7-1, 7-2 7-3 etc and they can have many sub levels plus bosses.

To begin with: I purchased the Thumper game+soundtrack. Don't buy the soundtrack. It's quite simply not worth it unless you're into ""ambient landscape"" where the whole appeal of the music relies on the samples(and even for ambient landscape it's not that good). Other than ""Beetle"", the last and only good track on the album alongside ""Triangle"", nothing has any redeeming musical quality besides really crisp sounds - which for me personally isn't quite enough to listen to it.

Now about the game:

The game is very ""raw"". Everything has a very ""raw"" metallic feeling to it. It's not at all ""floaty"" relative to the ever changing background; instead it actually feels quite fast and threatening in it's own unusual way. The game is very short. I've just completed level 2, and there're like 11 or so? I'd say around 6/7 hours gameplay given the last few stages aren't frustratingly difficult. Is the game ""hard""? Yes and no. It's really managable to get past everything, but quite a challenge to do so whilst maintaining proper ""grades""(each level consists of several checkpoints, inbetween each you get a ""grade"").

The gameplay is rather simple, you use a combination of the keys and spacebar. No pointers there, it's kindof what I expected.

Overall the game is quite unique, it has a very strange atmosphere to it. It's smooth as silk, the soundtrack is good(ingame is a whole different thing than buying the actual tracks outside of it; where all of it seems just...pretty bland), the game looks ""okay"" if you're into it's style. It's pretty fun to play. Biggest downside is is that the price is somewhat steep for what it actually offers.",1476206848,1476208864,True,27,1,0.462641984224319458,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I don't normally write reviews, but I think I have to since I was looking forward to this game for a while. First, you have to understand that when they say it's a rhyhtm game it really is just that. I played for 45 minutes and only heard rhyhtms and no actual music *FROM WHAT I'VE PLAYED*. Maybe it gets actual music later, but the lack of an actual melody or anything of the sort just turned me off. Second, It feels very repetative. It's fun and difficult but it feels like you're doing the samething over and over with more or less the same background. Yes the background does change, but not all that much. I think the concept of this game was good and will probably appeal to a lot of people, but I just couldn't get into it at all which is sad since I'm a big fan of rhythm games.

Update: I have (as of 2018) bought the game three times (PC, Switch and iOS). That should be enough of a recommendation. 

""Rhythm violence"" isn't just some marketing fluff made up by the devs, it's a pretty accurate description of this game. 

Everything you do in Thumper has this oomph about it that compliments the intense soundtrack perfectly to create something that's extremely exhilarating. The gameplay is really simple (you'll mainly be using one button and directions) but, once the game picks up and gets faster, it will get tougher. It's a nice difficulty curve, easing you with new mechanics every level before really testing your skills as you go on. 
The soundtrack is this orchestral/electronic mix that feels both epic and terrifying. Even just listening to the soundtrack on its own is intense.

Honestly, it's one of those games where if any one element was missing, the game wouldn't work. As a combined package though, Thumper is easily one of my favourite games of the year.
It's a game I've been waiting years for that didn't just deliver, but exceeded my expectations.",1476200549,1632863821,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Das Warten hat sich definitiv gelohnt. Und f√ºr 19,99‚Ç¨ bekommt man ein richtig gutes Spiel mit genialem Soundtrack. Aber den Soundtrack w√ºrde ich pers√∂nlich nur im Spiel h√∂ren. 

Viele vergleichen Thumper wahrscheinlich mit Audiosurf, aber das ist aus meiner Sicht falsch. Man sieht √Ñhnlichkeiten, ja, aber bei Thumper spielt man nicht seine eigene Musik, sondern die schon vorgegebene. Das ist schon einmal der st√§rkste Unterschied. Noch dazu sind Fehler fatal. Pro Stage kannst du dir max. 2 Fehler erlauben, au√üer du schaffst es, ein besonderes Gameplay-Element zu benutzen, um deine ""R√ºstung"" wiederzubekommen. Noch dazu f√ºhlt es sich nicht wie ein Spiel an, indem man wie bei Audiosurf einfach eine Strecke generiert zur ausgew√§hlten Musik abf√§hrt. In Thumper macht die Strecke teilweise auch die Musik. Taucht eine Kurve auf, h√∂rt man das, taucht ein Ring auf, h√∂rt man das und das mit allen anderen Objekten auch. Das zusammen mit der stimmigen Grundmelodie ergibt den finalen Soundtrack. F√ºr mich ist Thumper eher ein Abenteuer als eine einfache Fahrt auf dem Soundtrack.


+(23.11.2016) Da ein neuer Spielmodus hinzugef√ºgt wurde, f√ºge ich meine Meinung dazu noch hier rein. Der neue Modus ist f√ºr die, die sich selbst noch einmal testen wollen. Nachdem man das Hauptspiel geschafft hat, ist die Luft weg gewesen, doch nachdem der neue Modus hinzugef√ºgt wurde, ist nun wieder ein Teil da.

There are checkpoints every 15/30 seconds, meaning you don't have to restart at the beginning of a level. And man... This is HARD. You'll have to keep the pace with rhythm, but there are so many stroboscopic effects (and BEAUTIFUL ones) which are trying to distract you. This is a game that asks you to play in a room, lonely, with a maximum focus. It will surely break your nerves as you progress through the game, but damn, it's satisfying as hell.

I'm currently only part way through the campaign but it has already become extremely intense, demanding quick reflexes even to stay alive, let alone keep your score multiplier going. The music (part background track and part created by the obstacles you pass) combined with the beautiful, stylized visuals create an almost oppressive feeling but are completely effective in pulling you in and immersing you.

Dann kam mir der gedanke das ich f√ºr Trippel A Titel gerne mal 60‚Ç¨ ausgebe und 20‚Ç¨ f√ºr Thumper ja nicht so eine schlecht investition sein K√∂nnte.

Und Gott verdammt hatte ich recht!

Thumper ist ein sehr sehr gutes Spiel! Warum ?

    [*]Thumper hat einen einzigartigen Grafikstil den man sonst so noch nicht gesehen hat und sich perfekt ins gamplay einf√ºgt.
    [*]Die Game mechanics sind sind ""Easy to learn but hard to master"" so gelingt der einstieg sehr gut und man wird immer besser.
    [*]Der Sound bei einem Rhythmusspiel, wie Thumper, ist enorm wichtig. Das haben die Entwickler scheinbar verstanden den Thumper bedient sich einer riesigen Palette an Rhytmen welche daf√ºr sorgen das Thumper einen enormen ""Flow"" bekommt welcher einen fesselt.

This game is simply awesome, the visuals and the heavyness of the music puts you in this trance where your hands move by themselves and react to whatever obstacles they throw at you rather than you actively thinking about how to react to what comes next.

The obstacles follow the rhythm of the music perfectly which is what was the most important thing for me coming in, the #1 reason i never liked AudioSurf is that the procedurally generated tracks never actually followed the beat of whatever song you chose but since this game's music and tracks were (i'm guessing) built together, it makes for a very enjoyable feeling.

Gameplay operates much in the same manner as Rhythm Heaven, with each note type having a cue that precedes your input by a measure. The result is that by a few levels in, you're forced to be looking at and listening for the notes you'll be playing moments in the future as you input the controls for those you signaled in the recent past. This means you can't play the game simply by watching the highway like you might Rock Band, you must achieve a flow state much in the vein of Hotline Miami or Super Hexagon.

With visuals that look like Tool album art rendered in the world of Tron, and music that combines thunderous tribal drums and hints of industrial and dubstep, the presentation is top-notch, though don't mistake it for style over substance: every element of the appearance and sound of the game feeds back in to the exhilarating, rewarding gameplay.

If you like either, or if you're curious, dig in. Gameplay, environment, and cue are intense and relentless, but they also make it feel satisfying. Don't play if you have motion sickness or get frustrated.[/i]

Bought it full price tonight (an hour after it was released), played for five hours straight and got through four and a half ""levels."" Thoughts so far. 

This is a rhythm game for people who hate the cheery cliches of rhythm games, and an action game for rhythm game players who hate the clutter of action games. If you don't like rhythm games nor action games, pass on this one, because you'll just have a bad time. And if you don't like AudioSurf, maybe you should pass, but it's not just ""copying AudioSurf."" It's an action game that looks like AudioSurf from the surface. It's more oppressive, more hectic, and overall more satisfying. 

If you're willing to make the dive, consider Thumper less of an ""innovation"" on the [i]rhythm and music[/i] genre as much as it is on the [i]action[/i] genre. Yet, that makes it even more interesting. Like, imagine the most intense boss battle music you can think of. Now, imagine [i]becoming that music.[/i] In other words, it's less that you're [i]playing[/i] the song and more that you're [i]acting as[/i] the song, or maybe the song's acting as [i]you?[/i] That's what Thumper is. Because Thumper on its own could be another action game, but they incorporated rhythm game features, and in doing it so well, that mentality becomes most of the experience of this game. I might expand more on my own in a more extensive talk/review about what this means and why I love it, and I'll update here if I do, but that's the gist of it.

From here, I'll just do a bare-bones review of the game's major mechanics/gameplay points. 

[b]PROS:[/b] 

[list]
[*] Easy to learn. Not disgustingly hard to master. Extremely intuitive once you get the hang of it. But I'm only in level five and I've given up for the night so we'll see how that holds out.  

[*] The soundtrack is intense. Like I said, it feels like a giant boss battle, except you [i]are[/i] the music. 

[*] Extremely responsive environment and interface. The game has excellent non-verbal audio-visual cues that make every hit feel so satisfying while making you regret just ""scraping by."" With every hit, you add to what you hear, and that's an extremely fulfilling part of this game, as much as completing stages and levels and beating your own scores. 

[*] Rewards rhythm game mechanics and instincts, without forcing you to feel like it's a rhythm game. If you're a rhythm game player, you'll get what I mean when you get into it. If not, you'll hear what I mean as you tap your keyboard/controller.  

[*] Extremely addicting. Once you start, you just keep going. 
[/list] 

[b]CONS:[/b] 
(I know there are as many ""cons"" as ""pros"" but they're extremely minor -- consider it constructive criticism rather than ""reasons why this game isn't worth your time."") 

[list]
[*] [b]If you have motion sickness issues or can't handle ""psychedelic"" aesthetic, take a pass. Warning you now.[/b] 

[*] The music and rhythmic style gets over its own head sometimes, which is sorta expected from such a heavy industrial percussion-ambiance style of music. Some stages are extremely difficult to follow rhythmically, which is an issue, given it's a rhythm game, coming from a rhythm game nerd. You can survive just on visual cues alone, but as a rhythm game, this becomes a frustration. 

[*] The game's tighter ""tunnel"" points are unnecessarily and annoyingly difficult -- that is, it's difficult to see the next part coming often, especially when the environment causes parts to blend in. You will NOT finish the game without dying at least a few times. 

[*] They really don't instruct you on things. Again. Do not expect to go through this game without dying a few times. There will be [i]a lot[/i] of trial-and-error. 

[*] Needs an audio-visual calibration system. Badly. 
[/list] 

One note that's extremely neutral is that the game doesn't punish you until about halfway through for ""just getting by."" That is, it doesn't detract if you aren't doing perfect combos of the square taps, except in boss battles. I'm split between whether this is a good or bad thing for the game, but as a player, you can absolutely tell the game gets irritated for being lazy. 

Also, it feels intense as hell. If that's not your thing, skip it; if so, go wild. 

Basically, the gameplay is perfect, the execution isn't, you know? Like, they have a system perfected, but it gets a little bit over itself sometimes.

Holding or releasing the button alters your trajectory in each of these planes, effecting creating eight ""lanes"" for you to navigate at a given time.  Obstacles spring up to the beat and require you to be in a certain lane to avoid them, forcing you to navigate a treacherous, high-speed path through a psychedelic wonderland.

The visuals are amazing, but this game lacks the tightness of an actual rhythm game.

-The charts are weird:
The notes are constantly spread too far apart. It almost feels disconected from the song at some points.
It also makes inconsistent decisions in terms of being in syncopation or not.
And because of that you start to rely in visual reaction for timings instead of using the beat of the song.

-The visuals get in the way of the game:
In some levels, you go through tunnels that hides the obstacles ahead, which just doesn't feel like a fair challenge. Specially for S curves in succession.

-Walls make you play off-beat:
The walls are probably my biggest gripe with this game at the moment.
Unlike the other obstacles, walls have no audio cue to them when they spawn. I don't see why, it's inconsistent.
Turning at the perfect beat rewards you with a perfect turn, which is what you want, but the game is too harsh on lateness for these, while presenting no punishment other than no bonus score for being early.
This makes going for perfect turns too risky, so you go early. But at this point your not on beat, and isn't this a rhythm game?

-No quick restart button:
This is a minor point, but as a rhythm game player, I want o S everything. So restarting is something that I want to be doing a lot. I don't see why this game doesn't have this feature.

This game had a cool idea, but the 4 button game underneath it doesn't feel very good to play.",1476158066,1478966539,False,101,5,0.699741601943969727,9,True,False,False,False,,,

The music and visuals tell you something is wrong, there are writhing mechanical tenticals, dark industrial music, and a huge fucking head that grows bigger spikes every time you kill it. And you see all this out of the corner of your eye as you fly down the beetle superhighway. However, sometimes there's a break, where nothing happens to you for about 30 seconds, and you get to sit back and just take it all in. 

And then the music starts again.

The gameplay is chaotic and complex. For using only one button and the joystick, there are a suprising amount of mechanics that you have to worry about. It's very intense and almost stressful, and more than once I found myself hunched over my controller gritting my teeth in concentration. Take the time for a deep breath every now and then.

The difficulty is very interesting. The game doesn't have a difficulty setting, like easy, medium, or hard. Instead, the game is only as hard as how good you want to be at the game. There is a score system involving hitting consecutive beats and performing combos that is very hard to pull off perfectly. However, if you just want to survive, you don't have to hit a single beat all the way to the boss. Although, just because you can skip the beats doesn't mean it will be a walk in the park.

When I quit the game for the first time, still on the main menu, there was only one thing going through my mind. ""I can't wait to play this game again.""

It all started with an interesting trailer a couple years back, but since then, silence....

And now here it is seemingly out of nowhere and a few days before it was even scheduled to come out and WOW, this game is truly something special.

The GOOD:

-Graphics, By far the most striking part about the game is the look of it. Sharp, colorful, and absolutely stunning to look at in motion. Screenshots don't do this game justice.

-Soundtrack, Grab some headphones, crank up the bass, put that volume up to 100%, and feel the POWER.

-Gameplay, Simple controls, simple mechanics taught at the beginning of each level, but don't confuse simple with easy in practice. Once the game ramps up and the music gets more intense, you'll be forgetting your lefts from your rights and smashing into everything in no time. Very difficult, but so damn rewarding when you hit max rank on each level.

-VR Support, While i haven't tried it(Don't own a Rift or a Vive) just the thought of playing this in VR makes me as giddy as a schoolgirl.

The MEH:

-Price. Now after playing it, i'm absolutely happy with my purchase and will probably buy the soundtrack, BUT 20 bucks is a bit to ask of some people when comparing it to other games that are a bit more deep than this at a similar price. Its a minor gripe but i believe this wont have any problems selling a ton of copies.

Overall, I expected this to be different, a little indie game that looked neat but would be dusted away in the mess of games released every day. But woah...im so glad i pulled the trigger and got it. FAR exceeded my expectations, hopefully the media picks this up and runs with it, the devs deserve all the love for what they created.",1476155303,1476155303,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I do enjoy the game, but here are a few things to keep in mind before you buy it:

- The game is very visually noisy. I found my attention directed more to the screen than to the beat of the music. Hard for me to call it a Rhythm game based off this.

- When you take damage, and you will take damage, the game freaks out, throwing colors and effects at you and making it very difficult to see where you are or what you are doing at the moment. You gain a little bit of invulnerability when you take a hit, but when you are trying to hit something and you suddenly can no longer see it at all, the game takes a much more un-fun turn.

- The beats are there, but sometimes with so much noise happenign around you it is hard to keep track of it. I find myself constantly losing the beat of the music, and unable to hear the music very well due to concentration on what is in front of me, and the growing sound effects from everything.

- I've never once felt like anything I do, any light I hit or move I do was in sync with the music. There are times I notice that I do something and it coincides with a beat, but most of the time I'm ignoring the beat because it serves little purpose when things I can't see until they pop in are coming at me  from around a corner.

- It's nearly impossible to look ahead because most of the time you cant see anything until it is about half a second in front of you. This makes it very difficult to predict what is next, so some parts of levels you have to beat purely by dying over and over until you have muscle memory.

- The music is very abstract, and the tunes are often hard for me to follow, and I almost always very quickly give up on keeping the beat. 

Despite these gripes of mine, I enjoy the game a lot. It's difficult, and i wish the music had more of a presence and afferct on the actual gameplay. But it's a good game. If you're looking for a twitch reflex action game, I'd recommend it. If you are looking for a purely rhythmic game, this might not be the right one for you.

It's not overly difficult, the soundtrack doesn't have much variety, the control scheme is basic - however the game pushes the genre in other ways. The soundtrack, visuals and actual gameplay all feel unique and interesting, a game that fleshes out the genre in a welcome way.

Instead of hitting the right keys on expected notes and beats, like Guitar Hero style games, or learning patterns and practising specific songs for hours, like Osu or Beatmania style games, this game has a consistent soundtrack with specific audio cues notifying you when a certain type of obstacle is going to come up. If you hear a clap, you turn. If you hear hefty bass, you're jumping. These audio cues are outside of the soundtrack, however, and it feels ever-so-slightly jarring and takes you out of the game a little. Think of it like a one-man audience alongside the soundtrack and that's the person you've got to listen to.

This might seem simplistic at the face of it, but when you're hitting those maneuvers your character is also making sound and, in some cases, it's specifically planned out so that the sound of your character masks the sound of what's coming. You learn to use both your eyes and ears independantly to figure out what's waiting for you, and the game punishes you for failure. 2 tries and you're out.

Given all of the priase, and also the thumb up, you might think that I'm telling you that you should buy it. However, at ¬£16 this game feels lackluster. It's a unique take on the genre, changing pretty much everything you expect, but realistically it doesn't push much further. I don't believe that there's a challenge mode, there's no variety game-modes, it's just the levels you get given and there aren't many at that.

Like I said at the start, if you're into the genre and want to see a different view of it, I do think this is the game for you but at this pricetag it's hard to recommend outside of that. If it interests you I'd recommend picking it up and playing through the first few levels - if it isn't for you, you can simply refund it. I've rated it up because I believe that it's a good game, price tag excluded.

Note: The reviews in the video on the Steam page hype it up to be more than it is. There's nothing ""existentially dreadful"" about the game, nothing ""terrifying"". It's good, but come on.

The music is nice, but if it wasn't for the level design, it would sound a bit samey to some. I still like it.

Some may find the price point a little high (especially with 9 levels; though you'll be dying a lot), but if you're a nerd for polish and rhythm games (like me) or if you love competing for the best score, then it's worth the full price.

The audiowork by Brian Gibson is truly amazing but what's a feat that is hard to see simply watching a video is how well the game choreographs to you what is expected of you input wise. Despite the trippy and luscious visuals I've never been confused on what the game is requiring me to do.

The closest game you could compare it to mechanics wise would be the bit trip runner series in that there is a limited amount of inputs to put it but masterfully placed and paced.

The developer calls it a ""rhythm violence"" game, and I think that's an appropriate moniker. Anyone familiar with Guitar Hero or Rock Band will pick this up very quickly, but the addition of obstacles that can destroy you make the game feel as much like an action game as a rhythm one. It's fast-paced, but there are audio and visual cues that make it very easy to keep up with. I love how intense this game is.

It's also very accessible, whether someone is colorblind, hearing impaired, or (I think) visually impaired. It also supports DS4 controllers natively.
