Positive:
- Driving apparently remote-control vehicles in open levels that involve platforming mechanics is promising, but unfortunately, there is little to do within the game worlds.
- Despite not having many options to choose from, the overall performance is good, staying at around 100 frames per second.

Neutral:
- Although the maps are somewhat sizeable, they are empty husks of what could potentially be a finished game. This ubiquitous barren vastness only exposes evidence of underdevelopment.
- Collecting coins and capsules around the maps is the game's main focus. One's coins collection is saved and maintained between runs, but the capsule counts are not.
- Game modes, maps, and vehicle skins are attainable by means of unlocks. This unexciting collectathon aspect may be appealing to some but annoying and unnecessary to others.
- Executing stunts and aerial acrobatics is neither fun nor fulfilling. Instead, these activities are ordinary and aimless.

Negative:
- The game launches in windowed mode and does not go past the initial splash screens. Pressing the Alt+Enter key combination will activate fullscreen mode, and fixes the situation going forward.
- While both keyboard and gamepad are allowed for input, only keyboard controls and keyboard settings are available to the player. The gamepad controls and settings are nowhere to be found.
- All three of the camera angles are nearly unusable. It is either too close, too restrictive of a forward view, or too overhead, in addition to being erratic and unpredictable in movements.
- Crashes are frequent and happen at random intervals during gameplay.
- All vehicles handle identically, with oversteer being a major issue for driving.
- Aside from unlocking more mediocre content, there is no other incentive to keep exploring plain and vacant locations. There is very little to do or to see, regardless of game mode or map.

TLDR: A hybrid between a driving game and a walking simulator. Collect easter eggs stuffed all over vaguely fantastical pre-rendered maps to unlock new tracks and maps and modes. Modes are simply the same stuff with more restricitons such as time limits

Outstanding Issues:
-Massive frames drop everytime an item is collected and particle effects explode
-Vehciles other than the default one can be difficult to control to the point of being unplayable
-Game has some rather stringent requirements to collect items that are scattered all over to make the barest of unlocks, 
-Some areas are not easily accessible, or even obviously part of the map. It is often necessary to pick up car improvements like a better jump to even progress past certain areas making the exploration more linear than it might look at first glance

Conclusion: I am not hostile to the idea of a laidback exploration styled game with remote controlled toy cars and nice environments while you do trick jumps and the like but between the design restrictions, grindy unlocks, frame rates problems and wonked out vehicle behavior of some unlocks and you are left with something that barely qualifies as a tech demo.",1498547299,1509672173,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's fun and not serious or a pretentious game, and it feels like it was developed with attention and good intentions, however it has a few drawbacks which stopped it being as good as it could have been.

+ The design is mostly consistent throughout, nothing feels out of place 

+ Controls mostly work well

+ A throwback to games such as Re-volt, and more of a unique game today

+ The aesthetics, environment design and the car models are well designed and make the game quite visually appealing and colourful

+ The sound design is pretty good and the soundtrack is fun to listen to, nothing special or memorable but it works and it isn't particularly annoying or makes you want to turn the sound off. The engine noises sound like the cars actually have power behind them and each vehicle seems to have different sounds.


Negatives

- As other reviews stated, it's pretty glitchy. Most of these aren't game-breaking but some of them get pretty annoying, such as respawning in mid air and being thrown around or having small areas of ground which aren't solid.

- The car handling seems to be pretty strange, quite slippery until you collect power-ups, it seems to improve a little then but it's still quite odd.

- One level glitched and didn't have any sound playing, the sewer level glitched and some areas were without light, making it pitch black and impossible to see where you were.

-The collectables don't seem to have any purpose other than the coins, which could have been done better so that you had more of a reason to collect them. 

- You can't see how many collectables you've picked up until you collect another one, making it difficult to tell later on in the level if you've collected everything.

- The game doesn't end when you collect everything so you have to manually end the game which feels strange. There's no indicator of if you've played a level before besides having unlocked it.

It's very unwinding and a relaxing game involving racing on amazing and awesome jumps and loops and well, stunts. STUNTMANIA Reloaded is a basic free-roaming racer involving several gigantic maps that have all sorts of hidden and secret areas to explore. Each of the ~10 maps feature hundreds of jumps and stunts, complete with large amounts of green, yellow, and red collectables to gather in each level. Also in each stage, there are 3 types of coins that need to be gathered in-order to unlock certain parts of the game. Some coins need to be gathered in 3 pieces, which will be spread around the map. These include the first coin, a ""car coin"", which is used to unlock different cars. Second, a ""level coin"", which is used to unlock different levels. And the only coin that comes in whole, the ""gamemode coin"", which is used to unlock gamemodes. Finally, in each level there will be a set of powerups. These powerups include Super Jump, Nitro, Antigravity, Teleport, and more. These little parts of gameplay make this game a very fun and relaxing racer/explorer, leaving you taking a long breath at the ramps, loops, and obstacles of each map.

""Wait, if this is 'very fun', then why did you rate it badly?"" You may be asking.
The biggest and most dreaded downfall of all players' experiences is the giant number of glitches and bugs that there are in this game. Let me explain. So, you crash your car into a wall, and you wait around 2 seconds for it to respawn. Around 1/7 of the time your car will respawn being shot up into the air like a cannon and stay airborne for a good 40 seconds, leaving you with nothing to do but wait. Once that car comes crashing down again, unless you've picked up the ""Mega Health"" powerup, there's a 50/50 chance that you won't survive the fall, with the possibility of respawning shot up into the air once more. However, I have come to a slight realization of the glitch and it is if you've crashed with your car's nose tipped mildly upwards, it seems to bring up the glitch. An easy way to stabilize your car is holding down SPACE, but this is still unconfirmed as far as I know. In the game I guarantee that you'll find your car glitching through the map either fully, or just partially, even if you can make it out with a small hop. And, I've also taken note that you can literally drive up a flat wall, whether it be land, or a building, without any powerups or any help or tricks.

Now, I will say that this game is relaxing, fun, and enjoyable, but the glitches that this game possesses just seem to ruin the fun for most people. The price just doesn't seem like it's worth it's value if it's possessed by such bugs and broken mechanics, even if it's only $5. However, this game demonstrated to me amazing levels, and breathtaking and cool stunts and jumps and loops; This game is its own rollercoaster. But, even all of this doesn't top for the game's value. The only time I would recommend to buy this game is when it's on sale, or in Humble Bundle or other such sorts.",1455572346,1455572346,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Well this game certainly isn't one.
I's about open kind of world driving with RC cars. Your goal is to collect coins and other stuff from ""track"" to achieve new cars and tracks - if I figured it out. It could be fun BUT:
* The controls aren't rebindable and steering feels very clumsy.
* It doesn't work with my driving wheel (and hat HUGE con for driving game).
* It might have 360 controller support but not for PS controller, and well controls can't be rebind
* It's not pretty and I still have some performance issues. - well my computer isn't top of the notch, but so isn't this game.

Few pros:
* Open world. You really can't fail while driving. So it could be suitable for kids.
* Driving could be fun.
* This definitely isn't worst game in world. It actually could be good. - and some might feel like it already.

It has native Xbox 360 controller support, although there's nothing in the options or menus telling you what does what... it's not hard to figure out.

The controls feel a little touchy at first. Okay, a lot touchy. You have to make corrections quickly and there's not much margin for error, but you're controlling what's basically an R/C car that can take a lot of punishment, so it's okay.

The game starts out with nothing but an open world type map with all these powerups and collectibles scattered around everywhere. You have to build coins out of fragments to unlock more maps, vehicles, and game modes, but starting out you have access to 3-4 different vehicles so it's not bad. As you go through the level you also collect upgrades for your current car - things like nitro, super jump, low gravity, extra health, etc. The challenge is to figure out how to jump or climb up to the hard to reach spots to get your goodies. There's no penalty for dying, you just respawn at a random location, sometimes way up in the air.

Like other reviewers have mentioned, you have full control over your pitch and roll while in the air, so you're basically like a cat in that way. If you're good at being a cat, you'll always land on your feet... err... tires. If not, if you land on your nose or roof, you'll probably go boom if you're high enough.

You can switch camera angles. I found it's easiest to control spin from the bumper cam, but the disadvantage is it's harder to see where the roads, ramps, and hills lead off to. There's no way to adjust where you're looking, it's always straight ahead, except in third person, then the camera faces whatever direction you're going. There's a button to do a full 180 reverse, and another button to do a quick stop. It's not like a handbrake, it's to stop completely. This is useful for planting yourself on hard to reach ledges after you had to take a running jump to get to it. I keep forgetting that's what it's for but there it is.

So, this game is cheap, it's goofy, it's fun, and with so many things to unlock and maps to explore, I think it's well worth it for the price. Thumbs up! A solid 7/10 at least. Good fun.",1429189390,1429189390,True,1,0,0.53125,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Now to the physically ill part; I can't really understand why this is literally the ONLY game to do it but I suspect it's because when you control the vehicle in 3rd person it appears the terrain, not the car, shifts.

You'll be disappointed if you expect Mario Cart. Think Spyro's hub worlds in a car, and graphics like the original Spyro.

Long Version: I'm two levels in and I have to say this game is exactly what I wanted. You drive an RC car around a large area collecting hidden things and doing tricks. I have a couple of complaints, however. Doing tricks doesn't seem to do anything but flash some text; It'd be nice if there were more motivation for me to rack up score or soemthing. There doesn't seem to be a functional difference between the cars, and they all cost one coin to unlock (you get a coin by finding three parts in a level.) So after you've found one coin you'll unlock the car you like and after that there's no incentive to unlock more. The graphics are pretty rudimentary, and in places you'll think you're playing a PS1 game. 
Despite these issues, the game is still fun if you like exploring an area and collecting things in a vehicle. It brings back memories of playing Diddy Kong Racing and San Francisco Rush 2049's stunt mode, and is comparable to the drive-around-collect-stuff mode from Joyride Turbo on Xbox 360. I only wish this game's player investment system had gotten a bit more attention.",1428101168,1428101168,True,3,0,0.546263337135314941,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Within the only 5 minutes of playing the game, I encountered the following:

- The game didn't start on the first attempt - after the intro screen the window stayed black. Had to kill the process and restart.
- When starting out, there's only one game mode, one car, and one ""track"" available. You have to collect items on some sort of open-world island to unlock even other race modes. The open-world collect-things game mode was not fun to me, but of course that's completely subjective.
- The controls are laughably bad. A small change in slope may suddenly jerk the car around. You will do lots of flips and crashes for no reason. It's almost impossible to consistently go where you're aiming.
- The physics are hilarious or terrible, depending on your point of view. The car will do multiple flips in one jump all the time for no reason. At one point after my car exploded on impact, I respawned like 100 meters in mid-air. Instead of falling down, I ""fell"" up for probably 200 more meters before falling back down. I was in mid-air for at least 30 seconds total before hitting the ground and exploding again. This happened within the first and only 5 minutes of playing this.
- I gave up on the game after about 5 minutes. When quitting, the process crashed, got stuck and I had to kill it again via task manager.

I like small casual games, but this one is ridiculously unfinished. Avoid.",1428017223,1428017223,False,29,0,0.726278007030487061,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Les points positifs sont :

. Jeu simple d'utilisation  (sauf pour sortir et valider les ""coins"", il faut faire ""exit"" => à savoir !!!)

. Jeu d'exploration : vous cherchez dans quel recoin est caché un bout de pièce, une pièce, ou un élément à trouver, ils sont assez bien cachés, il faut penser faire le tour de tout, penser que le mode téléporteur (trouver un cercle rouge de téléportation) peut vous aider à atteindre des endroits impossibles d'accès.          Penser à débloquer les bonus :  téléporteurs, nitro, miroir, etc.

. Jeu de style : Les figures faites avec des looping, etc. rapportent des bonus.

. Vous allez où vous voulez, ce n'est pas un circuit mais une MAP par circuit. Vous êtes libre même d'aller au delà de la map = reset de la position de la voiture + bonus !! Bonus également si vous atteignez des endroits durs à atteindre.

. Le temps imparti est infini, seul l'usure des chocs donnés à la voiture (ou au véhicule) peut la faire exploser (avec une barre d'alerte correspondante pour vous avertir), idem sous l'eau !

. Les ""coins"" gagnés sur une map permettent de débloquer  (1 coin entier = 1 déblocage de voir ci-dessous) : 
- des voitures ou véhicules (celle que vous voulez au choix) y'a un peu de tout !
- des maps (celle que vous voulez au choix)
- des modes (celui que vous voulez au choix)

Vous avez 3 coins, un de chaque type caché sur chaque map, en entier ou en morceaux à reconstituer, dès que vous les avez tous, vous pouvez ou continuer la map en exploration, ou sortir pour valider les acquis par ""exit"".


Les points négatifs actuels au 11/01/2014 sont :

. Quelques bugs ou oublis (coincage du véhicule dans le grillage .. mais le déblocage existe dans le menu, un message de bug en sortant du jeu, et la touche Q pour orienter la caméra qui sert à euh rien !? ... enfin chez moi ca ne marche pas).

. La musique (bon j'ai déjà fait pire personnellement je vous rassure, mais ca n'empêche pas que c'est dur à écouter 2 heures), surtout, en plus, sur un ordinateur !

. Pas de sauvegarde possible (la sauvegarde existe pour les ""COIN"" que vous avez trouvé et ce que vous avez débloqué avec, par contre c'est en automatique, à vérifier quand on relance le jeu, vu que chez moi il a planté à la sortie).

. Pas de mode multi joueur.


Dans l'ensemble c'est un très bon jeu, j'ai hate de le tester à la manette, en tout cas déjà au clavier, c'est très plaisant, et reposant, les fans de micro machines auront une bonne impression de jeu, je pense, même si les circuits sont libres ici.

Je le recommande donc.",1420940045,1420940896,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I recommend this game for everyone because in time i know the few minor bugs will be fixed and it will still be the perfect little game for everyone.
