The combat is just 'walk up to enemy, click the mouse.' But you can't avoid the combat, because enemies can arbitrarily teleport into melee range if you try to run past them. The puzzles that I've seen up until the point in the game I played are mostly either glaringly obvious or pointlessly cryptic. It's also kind of glitchy.

But the thing above all others that really made me not like this game is the fact that it's just, /absurdly/ slow-paced. I was willing to give it a chance, until I got the shovel from the farmer, at which point he told me to dig up his crops. Each crop I had to dig up locked the character in place for several seconds while a sound-effect played. And with how on the edge I was about the game up until that point, that was the tipping point, at which point I realized that the game has no gameplay flow to speak of. I realize some of this is because it's built in RPG-Maker, but really, you can only blame the engine so much before you ask why the devs didn't just use a different engine.",1609103331,1609103331,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unfortunately a patch that was released on 15th June had a bug which overwrote save files with a dummy save.  To fix this a second patch was released the same day.  Unfortunately if you played Elderine after patch 1 and before patch 2 it meant that your save files were overwritten.   I apologise that this happened and hope that you can enjoy Elderine again sometime.

It has a very nostalgic LoZ feel to it. It has some difficult puzzles that aren't explained very clearly at times. To some that may be a pro and to others that may be a con. Personally I like the challenge. My only complaint is the combat system. Unless I'm missing a key fundamental it seems like you can't win a fight unscathed. I can't seem to simply bash a rat on the head with a lead pipe without getting bit at least once the very second I'm in range. Maybe I haven't made it far enough into the game to ""unlock"" a defense mechanic and It was intended that I just avoid them... or maybe I'm just missing something. All-in-all I do enjoy it and recommend this game.

The game has alot to offer from puzzles to rogue like, personallity traits to dungeon crawling and even a survival element.
Its still within very early stages of development having said that it has massive potential im enjoying the first parts of the game and more is to come from the dev as time goes on.

Definitely one to watch!!",1485165761,1485165761,True,5,0,0.506397545337677002,0,True,False,True,False,,,

-Do you like riddles? Yes?! Then this is the game for you! The devs littered the whole game with them.
-Do you enjoy some good laughs? If so what are you waiting for?
-Do you love doing quests? Here you go!

My personal opinion on the game. I like it. Yes, there is still alot of bugs, but then again it's an early access and from what I've seen not many people have bought the game so it's to be expected with only a handful of people helping out to find the bugs. You can either wait till majority of the bugs are fixed to buy it or buy it now since you can't wait to play.",1485141685,1485664427,True,7,0,0.528882801532745361,3,True,False,True,False,,,
