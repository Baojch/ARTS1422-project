・両手武器: 攻撃ボタンを少し長押ししないと攻撃できない上に硬直時間がある、タメ攻撃みたいなもの
・弓: 弓と矢の組み合わせで性能が変化、攻撃ボタン長押しで弓を引きターゲットロックで敵の方向にボタンを離して発射する

[魔法]
使用したい魔法をスロットに装備して、ボタン長押しでキャスト、ボタンを離して発動する。

各エリアのボスを倒したときに手に入る指輪を持っていれば、最初のエリアの鍵のかかった扉を開くことができ、その先にはボスが待つ。

[b] Introduction [/b]
Ethereal Legends is an action RPG set in a phantasy world. Without bigger introductions or quests you are set to defeat the evil and protect the world from dark forces.

[b] Gameplay & Story: 2/10 [/b]
Since there was not intro video, tutorial quest or any kind of other introduction, the only story I got so far was when speaking to an NPC that told me to kill skeletons in the graveyard, so he opens the portal for me to proceed further. Well, as you can imagine, being the Hero that destroys the evil and that sadly without any kind of decent background story is not going to impress anyone. The gameplay consists of some combat and inventory management.

[b] Combat & Challenge : 2/10 [/b]
The combat felt absolutely clunky and unresponsive, nothing that you see in the steam product video. The biggest challenge was to actually to find out which keys do what on the keyboard and I can tell for certain, playing with keyboard / mouse is not a way to play this game. Sadly, it has not been adapated for PC peripherals at all, so it is real trouble to handle it. Besides, that inventory management aswell the options menu are real pain to go through aswell. Since the game only suggested to play with a controller and did not state it is an absolute requirement, I rate the game as fully supported keyboard/mouse game, what is definetely is not.

[b] Graphic & Interface : 3/10 [/b]
I dont know where the screenshots in steam are coming from, but definetely not from the game in its final state. On my GTX 1080TI on obviously ""Epic"" settings it looked pretty bad. The effects were clutches of sparkles, the monsters did not have that many details, the map details loaded mostly only when coming really close to some parts of it. The inventory is coming from early 2000s and looking like an oldschool isometric RPG, while the game tries to be modern action.

[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 3/10 [/b]
The progress consisted of killing monster, running to next spot/dungeon/portal and killing some more there. It is fun for the first few hours since you mostly meet new opponents and get some new gear, but becomes really repetative and boring soon. 

[b] Audio & Immersion : 3/10 [/b]
The audio sadly was not satisfying at all. The effects sounded like straight from '99 and the music was boring so it got turned off few minutes into the game. Sadly, the game did not provide the cool feeling you see on the screenshots where the area looks immersive on top of cool combat, so to tell you in short - immersion is almost non present in this game and you will be counting minutes wasting on this game.

[b] Side-Notes [/b]
[list]
[*]This game is single player only.
[*]This game's length is dependant a lot your combat finesse.
[*]This game contains steam achievements.
[*]This game offers bad optimization, possible crashes and performance issues (I encountered this on a high end machine in 2017).
[/list]

[b] Summary [/b]
I feel like this game could have been so much better. With decent optimization, with graphics and style like displayed in the screenshots, with decent action combat system that feels responsive and adjusted controls for PC instead of controller, it might have been a small gem. Sadly, non of it is present and it looks like the game was thrown on the market like 6 months too early before getting polished to make quick money grab. Save your money and stay away from it unless you prefer playing boring action RPGs with a controller, I cannot recommend it.

It reminds me of the old classic dungeon crawler rpgs where you open chest and kill enemies and work your way to a boss fight. That is exactly what I was expecting and thats what I got. No complaints there. The graphics are very nice and each map has a unique look and style. The combat is a mixed bag. While I had fun with it some may only see it as a stripped down dark souls, dodge and strike. I didn't find the magic abilities very useful through most the game, aside from the dash and haste which become essential. 

There are some bugs such as clipping thru parts of walls and other objects. I only ever died once from clipping through a wall and free falling for infinity. Performance wise I had no issues at all with frame rate or any crashes. The bows also seem to sometimes not fire at the enemy you are locked onto or the arrow just drops infront you. I mainly just stuck with the sword and shield combo.

In the first area starting at level 1 I found the game to be some what brutal in difficutly and I kind of wanted it to stay that way. However, after the first section and an equipment upgrade I found the xp became far too generous. I can understand not wanting to make a game too grindy but I really only replayed the second map twice to get some extra money and xp and everything else was pretty easy from then on. 

Considering this game was made (mostly) by one person, I say job well done. The Dev continues to improve the game, and I can't wait to see what else will be added and any future products he's involved with.

So I received a key for Ethereal Legends, I thought to myself ""pretty impressive title"" and the screenshots and videos looked pretty good too, so why not?

Cons:
Straight away something seemed a little off, it felt unfinished, and this was just after the title screen! Navigating the options to change the screen size was a problem, but I got there in the end.

The main character attacks slowly, there aren't any combos and in general, the combat feels very unintuitive. There aren't any sounds when the skeletons strike you and you take (some) damage regardless of whether you were blocking or not.

Spells take just forever to cast, I mean like a good 3-5 seconds. You can't pause the game if you're in combat (the combat music is playing) which is a problem if you just picked up some leather gloves and wanted to equip them!

Everything in the world is just too big. I mean, the skeletons could get away with it - they're skeletons of giants or something, but the rest of the world? It sort of feels like at the last moment, the scale of the hero was reduced just so the world would feel bigger and more ""epic"" but all that's really happened is that you end up finding hilariously huge barrels and wagons.

It takes a long time to ""run"" anywhere and potions and spells seem pretty expensive for what they are (there's a wizard in the main castle btw).

You *do* get the ability to dash but it uses up mana so after 3 casts you're back to running around slowly again.

Pros:
You can punt chickens!!

There's a recall spell that you can cast when you get glitched into an area that you're not meant to be in and can't escape from (check out towards the end of my video).

Overall:
Ethereal Legends just feels unfinished, like it was rushed out to go on sale. I was genuinely shocked when I saw the price for the game after recording the video (I got a key for free to review). I figured the game was still just a demo and very clearly in alpha, no pre-alpha still.. I didn't expect it to be available to buy yet.. it feels a long way away from that, let alone for it to cost so much!

[b] My experience with this game: [/b]

I launched it up late last night to get the settings in store for a nice little stream. I got the settings set up, started a game to check how it looked. The intro felt very poorly done and dropped me in the middle of nowhere. I was massively confused and didn't notice a tutorial. I could be wrong, maybe there is one, but it didn't have me go through while starting the game. 

After turning my settings to medium, I held 30 fps. I have an AMD Radeon R9 390 Series. I figured that my card could handle this game but apparently not. I started my stream the next day and turned the settings to low and I still couldn't hold the fps, my cpu was hitting max. I have an Intel i7-4970k. I shouldn't hit max cpu with a game like this. 

While streaming I tried to launch the game multiple times only to recieve a message box stating ""fatal error"" with no error codes or an explanation for it. After reinstalling and trying to start the multiple it started. Only to drop me back in the middle of nowhere with no help what so ever. There isn't even a ""main menu"" button. Only a quit game. The graphics and looks of this game are subpar, the game is poorly optimized, and it feels early access even though it isn't.

[b]Summary of my problems:[/b]

Game is poorly optimized.

Game feels early access but isn't.

Graphics are subpar.

Did not notice a tutorial while starting the game, it was confusing and not very welcoming. 

Took me multiple tries to even launch the game due to ""fatal error"" with no explanation. 

[b]TO THE DEVS:[/b]

Fix your game. Seriously. There are so many issues I can't even play fully. I really tried ot give this game a fair shot but with all these bugs I can't. Now the price for this game ($9.99) is not a bad price. I believe it to be a really fair price. But for what you're selling, I can't even play. How do expect others to play if the game won't even launch? This game should have started as ""early access"" not go fully launch on steam. I'd recommend fixing the ""fatal error"" issue and optimizing your game so I can try it again.",1487910170,1487910187,False,19,0,0.569177210330963135,6,False,True,False,False,,,

Ethereal Legends is not by many definitions a good game, but I have to say it's something I enjoyed because of how bad parts of it are.

The game plays in a similar way to Dark Souls, you go through levels fighting enemies and camping at resting places until you defeat the different bosses.

The thing is everything in the game feels extremely clunky and I mean everything.

The attack and blocking animations barely allow you enough time to attack the enemies in the game before they hit you again and there is no feedback when you land a hit. Enemies will often attack you from the wrong direction entirely yet still do full damage, making dodging nearly useless.

Moving around feels as though the character is moving at 70% the proper speed for their animations. Attacks and kicks also feel extremely slow.

The entire world looks like it is roughly twice as big as it should be in comparison to your character. The characters in the game look like they are roughly the size of a hobbit.

The sound assets are really, really bad to the point where they easily could have been taken from a website like FreeSounds.

Despite all this, the game is fun to play from the same standpoint that bad movies can still be fun to watch. Ethereal Legends desperately wants to be a grand Dark Souls style game but it lacks the budget, design and development team to pull that off.

I recognize the game is developed by one person, but there have been many far better games developed by similar team sizes. In the future I would say the developer should focus on making a smaller scale game that can do a couple things very well, rather than many things poorly.

I can't say this gets a recommendation, but it does have a certain charm to it in how innocent it is.",1487875487,1487875487,False,11,0,0.470838218927383423,2,False,True,False,False,,,
