The result is a solid casual 2D platformer that’s charm kept me playing all 15 levels, collecting every idol and some speed runs. 

 An evil being extinguishes all the candles in the land. It’s  the job of our lone candle to bring light back to the land. Despite this not offering anything new there is some reasons that elevated this from meh to recommend:

The artwork in this game is very appealing. It has a cute aesthetics even with the enemies. The use of colour is applied well with good shading and light. It is more muted tones than bright colours but it suits the storyline. 

Its charming, cute and fun to play. I was unsure of my intentions when I started this but I ended getting sucked in and enjoying my time with it.

There is a nice balance in levels and difficulty progression. You are steadily introduced to all the game mechanics and enemies before having to use them all in later levels. The levels themselves also vary in length. Within each level there is a good balance between easier and more hard sections.

My only personal complaints are I would like to have seen more of other level designs. I really liked the playing card and pirate levels and would have liked to seen them used more.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1549492463

 I experienced no technical issues with this game. It was smooth and responsive with the Xbox one controller.

This is an excellent example of a simple casual 2D platformer done very well. Clearly a lot of effort went into this. It’s definitely worth a casual play for a few hours, in between a bigger game rotation or if you are just looking for something relaxing and comfortable to play.

I believe I brought this in a bundle a while ago so if you have it in your library and its something you would play check it out!",1540662845,1540663523,True,6,0,0.591247141361236572,1,True,False,False,False,,,

A primeira fase desse jogo é tão suave que parece ser pra criança com menos de 10 anos, no entanto na segunda a dificuldade sobe demais e na terceira mais ainda. A sensação é que é um jogo meio indeciso sobre o público que quer atingir. É bacana, tem um design bonito pra caramba apesar da simplicidade das texturas e modelos 3D, não é algo genérico. Pode ser um jogo divertido para os fãs de plataforma, não é tão minha praia, então não me apaixonei, mas dá pra ver o esforço da equipe em colocar coisas diferentes, como ter que correr para um abrigo quando chover ou ficar coletando cera pra não morrer (já que você é uma vela). Enfim, acho que fãs de plataforma podem adorar, mas precisam jogar mais que a primeira fase, pois ela pode ser tediosa de tão fácil. Análise detalhada aqui:

Платформер в котором мы играем за... Свечку! Да... свечку путешествующую по островам, собирающую воск и врагами нашими будет ветер, огонь и вода (все что может навредить нашему фитилю и воску). На каждом уровне есть три храма природных элементов. Вот и все, чем может похвастаться игра.

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
¥ Удобное управление.

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
¥ Нет достижений.

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Странное чувство. Вроде типичный платформер. Необычные персонажи, но все остальное как всегда. А вроде и придраться не к чему. Все проходится, не очень скучно, уровни построены с душой. Были бы достижения был бы смысл собирать все на уровне... Долго ломался рекомендовать или нет и результат перед вами.

I can see great effort was put into the graphics unlike most dev games you see. The play is fun, I had a great time playing the game.

I also could then understand how the developer created the level and how the level flowed which gave me even more respect for the game. The game has many lands and themes to the land. I really enjoyed the Raiders of the Lost Ark theme and Alice and Wonderland theme blew me away. I definately thought I got my money's worth, I payed full price on both platforms, ps4 and steam.
