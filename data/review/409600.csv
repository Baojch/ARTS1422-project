There were some things the game did very well, but there were definitely times where I was very frustrated with it too.

The story was something I thought was done decently enough to really only leave a couple questions behind.  As a writer, I would like the questions to be answered, but they don't really hold any real importance to the plot.  Of course, like any contract one would make with the Devil, there were great boons for the receiver to get but releasing the 7 vices was a way of there being a weakness.  This is a concept I have not seen before, and thought was a great idea.  The seven vices each give you an item to help you in your journey, though I was disheartened to find out they make no further appearance or help in the game after you capture them all.  Not a huge loss though because the story played out very well and didn't feel rushed.

The game itself didn't really have any music that really stood out.  There were background noises that created the ambiance and the noises that came with certain environmental triggers, but I really think adding music to the game or having something playing softly in the background (whether it be warped music for the Mirror World or eerie music for all sections) would add to the magic of playing the game.  I found myself getting irritated by a lot of the noises because they felt repetitious and persisted for longer than they should.  Some noises were also louder than others and there didn't seem to be a great balance between them.  

Now to the actual gameplay, of which there were a lot of things that could have been done better.  One of the first issues I ran into with the game is the lack of a map.  I had assumed at first that I needed to find the map before I could gain use of it, but quickly realized that you get no map.  If there were fewer areas, then I think having no map would be easier to navigate, but with there being so many sections to each chapter of the game, it became very difficult to navigate where each item was or if there was something I could do in a different section. 
The hidden object games were fine, though were a little more difficult than others I had played in the past.  The Similar Objects game where you have to locate two items that were similar to each other was the most difficult of the puzzles.  I honestly had no idea what I was doing the first time I saw this puzzle since the items could be two different things (ex. find two articles of clothing with one being a glove and the other a hat).  I think having more directions for this would be great.  
A couple of the puzzles also straight up didn't function like they should have (the metal puzzle where you have to create an image by rotating and swapping metal pieces to create a picture).  This puzzle in particular was structured exactly like the picture, but only a few of the tiles were lit up and in the ""right place"".  I closed out of the game a couple of times only for this issue to persist, and it only ""fixed"" itself after I had rotated the other pieces to a direction that made no sense and have it right itself out.  If the puzzle is going to have different functions attached to it, at least make sure the puzzle pieces are properly oriented to make use of those functions, not be half completed.  
And to top it all off, the game crashed itself a couple times while I was playing the game.  Sure, any game could crash at any given point, but I found it frustrating after the issues I've already come in contact with.  I'm not the only one that has had issues with the game crashing either.  

As much as I loved the story for this game, it wasn't executed as well as it could have been and could benefit from having a few quality of life updates.  It's very rare for me to dislike a game, but unfortunately a good story couldn't fix the other issues this game had.  This is a game I unfortunately wouldn't recommend.  Play at your own risk, but this is by far the most difficult hidden object game I have played and I didn't find it nearly as fun as I had others.",1706338336,1706338336,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

However, she is kidnapped by a strange figure. You don't have a choice but track down the being in the Mirror World.

The plot has potential. I mean, tracking down the seven deadly sins is a nice storyline. However, I feel like there are some timeline problems: the starting point is 1853 and the story is taken place into the present and should 200 years later. But nothing screams 2053. Nothing screams 'we're in a contemporary world' apart the outfit of the protagonist and some cutscenes.

The gameplay is classic for that kind of games: find items to use, find objects in hidden objects scenes or logical pairs, solve minigames. This is where the game fails the most: some minigames are very hard and can take long to solve. Sometimes, the description of what you have to do is not even precise enough, result: you're lost. And I don't speak about the find logical pairs, because some of the logical pairs aren't logical at all. The hidden objects scenes are not easy for some items to find too. And I don't speak about finding your ways: each time I've started a new section, I was stuck quickly and I took so much time to find my way - because this stubborn girl doesn't want to use hints though at the end, I was so fed up that I used them (not in the hidden object scenes).

The worst is the number of times the game crashed or closed itself. I would say that I'm at a count of five. Meh, it even crashed in the middle of an hard minigame...

Graphically, it's correct, soundtrack is OK, no real voice acting apart for the seven sins and it's gibberish.

Удивило, что нельзя сразу начать или продолжить игру, каждый раз приходится ждать секунд 10 пока не воспроизведется дурацкая анимация в главном меню. Какой ""гений"" решил, что это круто и пойдет на пользу игре? Все загадки и головоломки в основном нудные, не логичные и сильно различаются по сложности. То есть уже в самом начале было несколько довольно трудных задачек, а в середине и в конце много совершенно легчайших, что странно, т.к. в норме сложность должна нарастать по мере прохождения, а не быть случайной. Задача с циферблатом на часах не хило подпалила седалище..Так же была замечена явная ошибка в одной из сцен поиска предметов - игра указывала, что нужно найти болт, хотя на самом деле гайку, как оказалось. В этой игре какая-то странная локализация, хотя судя по титрам она сделана российскими разработчиками и проблем с этим не должно было быть. Или еще пример - нужно было починить сломанную пластинку, в описании всплывала подсказка, что ее можно починить клеем, тыкаю на нее этим самым клеем, но он не срабатывает, пхах. По ""гениальной"" логике разрабов сначала нужно было поставить банку с клеем на никак не обозначенную область рядом с пластинкой (играл на ""хардкоре"" если что, без подсвеченных областей).. И таких примеров тут куча, по сути из подобной бредятины и состоит вся игра. Но самое забавное, что если в процессе поиска предметов нажать на кнопку Esc, то головоломка моментально пропускается и считается решенной. Хотя во всех уважающих себя играх Esc отвечает за вызов меню, паузу и возможность выйти из игры.. При этом я собирался с первого раза пройти игру на все ачивки, т.е. играть без использования подсказок и пропусков головоломок, но случайное нажатие Ecs всё испортило.. После всего этого назвать разработчиков данной поделки кроме как чудаками на букву м не получится. Так же раздражает, что курсор в игре меняет свой внешний вид, становится большим и неудобным. Благо в настройках есть опция сделать его стандартного размера, но это приходится делать каждый раз при новом заходе в игру, автоматически запомнить эту простейшую настройку игра видимо не в состоянии..
Под конец вообще какой-то треш и абсурд начался, эта игра упорно не хочет заканчиваться и гоняет игрока от одной локации в другую и обратно. Тем более там приходится ездить на лифте и из-за этого надо постоянно ждать его анимацию.. При очередной смене главы думаешь: ""Ну может уже сейчас наконец-то эта чертова игра закончится!?"" Но нет, она упорно подбрасывает тебе новой головной боли в виде надоедливых головоломок и не думает кончаться...Так же в процессе было несколько вылетов на раб.стол, что способствует еще большему возгоранию пятой точки. Ужасная игра.

Hidden object game of 2015.

Discover the dark family secret and face the power of evil! But be careful, the closer you get to the goal, the more someone dislikes it.
Your daughter is kidnapped. bring her back
Use the present and the past.

You must help Sonya save her and her daughter. You have an assistant at your disposal, a goblin (Bogy Brownie).
A dangerous journey full of mysticism awaits you.
A very good story is told.
So much for the content of the adventure.

As usual, it's crowded here. Very well made but very heavy. Nevertheless, I managed them all without help, if you don't succeed there is a help function. You can skip the mini-games, which I mostly did, as I almost always do. There are some things that you have to make yourself, however, without help but with instructions. If you want to solve all this yourself, you will have many hours of fun here. The help loads up quickly, which I think is very good, as I've often used it when looking for clues.

Technically well implemented and error-free. A well-acted story at that. Logical, quite difficult puzzles, also well inserted. What more do you want?
Clear tip for fans. I can absolutely recommend it.

[h1] Contract With The Devil [/h1]
Wimmelbildspiel von 2015.

Entdecke das finstere Familiengeheimnis und stelle dich der Macht des Bösen! Aber sei vorsichtig, je näher du dem Ziel kommst, desto mehr missfällt es jemandem.
Deine Tochter wird entführt. Hole sie zurück.
Nutze dazu das Heute und die Vergangenheit.

Du mußt Sonya helfen, sie und ihre Tochter zu retten. Dir steht ein Assistent zur Verfühgung, ein Kobold (Bogy Brownie).
Dich erwartet eine gefährlichen Reise voller Mystik. 
Eine durchaus gute Geschichte wird erzählt.
Soweit zum Inhalt des Abenteuers.

Wie üblich wimmelt es hier auch mal. Sehr gut gemacht, aber sehr schwer. Dennoch hab ich sie alle ohne Hilfe bewältigt, gelingt dir das nicht gibt es eine Hilfefunktion. Die Minispiele kannst du überspringen, was ich wie fast immer überwiegend getan habe. Es gibt einige Sachen die du allerdings selber Herstellen mußt, ohne Hilfe aber mit Anleitung. Wer dies alles selber Lösen will, hat hier sehr viele Stunden Vergnügen. Die Hilfe läd sich schnell auf, was ich sehr gut finde, da ich bei der Suche nach Hinweisen, sie öfters genutzt habe. 

Technisch gesehen gut umgesetzt und fehlerfrei. Eine gut umgesetzte Geschichte noch dazu. Logische, Recht schwere Rätsel, ebenfalls gut eingefügt. Was will man mehr?
Klarer Tip für Fans. Ich kann es sehr empfehlen.

From start to finish, the game is around four or five hours without hints and at $5 full price, it's a bargain. (There are bundles to save, and sometimes on sale.) There's only one or two words that don't quite match up: ""pipe"" for a clarinet is one. The story is a bit lame but that's to be expected from a HOG.

There is some problems with two achievements (use no hints), but they can be obtained through cheesing the game at the beginning, or by a very specific delete method. There are two more achievements (HO speed) that can give a little trouble but they can be cheesed.

The game has a problem with speed of clicking things that can cause it to crash. The loss of progress is usually very minimal. But there is one at the end of the 5th act (the envy / hankerchief) section. If you wait for animations to fully complete before clicking on things, then the crash will never happen to you. The envy section has a little bit longer animation, but if you click anything during the animation you run VERY high risk of crashing your game AND corrupting the playthrough with a soft lock.

If you play the game knowing this information going in, you'll complete it in 4-6 hours and if you used hints, add 3-4 hours for a second play. It's fairly priced for its quality, but it's not really a memorable game.",1680909048,1680909048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The story begins with our protagonist Sonya receiving a letter from a guy she knows from somewhere...? I dunno, but as it turns out, the guy sold his soul to the Devil (yeah, it's written on the contract that everyone can read) and needs the soul of an innocent child to pay the fees. Thus, he kidnaps Sonya's adopted daughter and intends to conduct some ritual on her. And here begins Sonya's quest to save not only her daughter, but her friend's lost soul. Quite an interesting concept if you ask me, but it's a HOG game, it's not very complex. We just need an excuse for mini-games/puzzles and HOG scenes. 

There's a lot of those, and I like most of them, they are also not very complex. Quite a standard collection of puzzles that you have seen in countless point and click games before. But they pretty much fit into the game's world. When I think of dealing with the devil, I think of a lot of children's puzzles to unravel the truth (or a lie for that matter). 

Graphically, it's also standard HOG. I don't know, is there some sort of basic creator for this kind of graphics, or is it just an army of graphics designers all trained in this one style? They sell their stuff to any hidden objects game company out there or something? I wouldn't tell if it's another Artifex Mundi game, but animations are quite minimalistic (even compared to the most minimalistic Artifex Mundi game), and there is no voice acting. So the overall impression is that this is a very low budget (and low effort) game. However, as I said, it is competent in telling the story and integrating it with the collection of puzzles. 

I decided to give it a Yes rating. If you like HOG games, it's a quite fun break between better adventure games out there.",1672490239,1672490239,True,1,0,0.476408600807189941,0,False,False,False,True,,,

I'm going to recommend this game to hidden object adventure game veterans in particular because Contract With the Devil is [i]tough.[/i]

Some of the puzzles and most of the hidden object scenes slapped me around and made me feel like I was putting in the same amount of effort as I would for a full-scale adventure game.

This is a mostly well-made hidden object adventure game, but it's old and felt clunky until I got used to its quirks.  The paper doll puppet tool animations in cutscenes are low-quality and create disturbing character movements.  The game's only voice acting are basic vocalizations and distorted demonic voices.  Cutscene dialog is only text and sometimes auto-advances too quickly to read.  However, the art and particle effects are really nice, despite this ancient game being low resolution and not supporting widescreen.

There were many puzzles I have never seen before in my life, which was very pleasing to me.  On the other hand, I was not pleased by how many of my least-favorite type of puzzles there were: where changing one thing changes multiple other things.  I will always hate those kinds of puzzles.  I think since learning a bit of the technique for sliding tile puzzles, I'd rather play those!  (There aren't any sliding tiles in CWtD.)

Hidden object scenes were downright dastardly!  Objects are hidden in absolutely insane ways.  Even the scenes in the very first area are brutal.  This is the first HOAG I've played with ""logical pairs"" hidden object scenes, and let me tell you some of them were a leap of logic.

There's an achievement for completing a hidden object scene in less than 1 minute.  This is the only achievement I didn't get in my playthrough.  These scenes are so difficult, I believe it's impossible to do it that fast unless you already know where the objects are.  I didn't want to leave this one achievement unachieved, so I started a new game to hopefully learn the first hidden object scene.

I stumbled upon an exploit for this achievement: I used Alt+F4 before clicking the last object in the second hidden object scene (the dining room cabinet), hoping it would have reset when I reloaded the game.  Unfortunately, it did not reset and all objects except one were complete.  Fortunately, the scene [i]timer[/i] had reset and I was given the achievement just for clicking the last object.

This is an exploit but I don't mind accidentally using it and I don't mind sharing it for others to purposely use it.  These scenes cannot be legitimately completed in less than 60 seconds without repeatedly learning the scenes.  Though somehow more people have this achievement (6.4%) than have completed all hidden object scenes without hints (5.2%), so maybe it is possible...

CWtD is a great game if you want a challenge and can overlook the somewhat sloppy manner in which it has aged.",1662948508,1662948508,True,1,0,0.533073961734771729,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Игра вышла в Steam в декабре 2015 года и на данный момент имеет всего 109 отзывов, из которых лишь 68% положительных, что в сумме дает ""Смешанный"" рейтинг.

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СЮЖЕТ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Соня - мать-одиночка, воспитывающая приемную дочь Лизу. Она мало что знает о своем ребенке, однако очень хотела бы узнать больше. Этим решает воспользоваться таинственный незнакомец, во время встречи с которым Соня получает приглашение посетить старинный особняк. Неизвестный мужчина уверяет, что у него есть сведения, которые обязательно прольют свет на историю Лизы и её знатной семьи. Ну и как тут устоять-то? У незнакомца лишь одно условие - Соня должна прийти вместе с дочуркой, но это, как Вы понимаете, Соню совершенно не смущает и не останавливает. Ну а дальше как по канонам жанра - во время заветной встречи девочку похищает неизвестное злобное зло, а в маме просыпается русская баба, готовая остановить на скаку слона и оторвать ему все, что сильно торчит. 

Вообще, когда имеешь за плечами уже несколько десятков пройденных игр подобного плана, начинаешь замечать убийственную закономерность, которую уже действительно в пору назвать каноном. Так вот ""каноны"" Contract with the Devil собрала все - здесь вам и всесильная девушка-ГГ, и похищенный ребенок, и злобное зло, которое строит безумные но никому не непонятные жуткие козни, а встретившись с ГГ отлетает с полпинка. В общем, все как доктор прописал. Но давайте обо всем по-порядку. 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

В рамках Contract With The Devil нас ждет вполне себе стандартное приключение с элементами hidden objects: ищем предметы, засовываем в нужные места, проходим дальше. Периодически жизнь будут осложнять разные головоломки на подбор правильных цветов/чисел/элементов и прочей мишуры, а также сцены с ""разбором хлама"". Изюминкой данного приключения для меня оказались задачи на поиск логических пар - эдакая альтернатива разбросанным предметам, только вместо поиска конкретных вещей по списку вам предстоит подбирать пары предметов, каким-то образом логически связанных между собой. Логика, правда, временами будет весьма своеобразной, но сама задумка для меня оказалась достаточно свежей и приятно разбавила все то, к чему успел привыкнуть в прочих играх. 

А вот от чего в Contract With The Devil испытываешь самое подлинное удовольствие, так это от красивейших фонов, очень бережно и атмосферно отрисованных художниками. На них хочется просто любоваться, подолгу оставаясь в этой одновременно мрачной но уютной реальности. Музыкальное сопровождение здесь ненавязчивое, никаких нареканий не вызывает. Имеется несколько режимов сложности, возможность пропустить наиболее сложные или по каким-то причинам не особо интересные головоломки. Русская локализация тоже на уровне, без косяков. Имеется также набор достижений, большую часть которых можно выбить достаточно легко, правда за парочкой последних придется попотеть. Одним словом - все, как по списку. 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СТОИТ ЛИ ИГРАТЬ? ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

На полное прохождение Contract With The Devil у меня ушло чуть более восьми часов игрового времени с учетом того, что в определенный момент был сделан длительный перерыв в игре. Думается, при желании игру можно пройти быстрее, но вот тут как раз тот случай, когда даже при самых умелых руках и голове за пару часов никак не управиться, да и, честно говоря, если проникнетесь игрой, большого желания куда-то сильно спешить у Вас не возникнет. Ценник у ""Контракта"" достаточно умеренный, однако имеет смысл дождаться скидки - от 50% игра появляется в Steam достаточно часто.

I really like the female protagonist.  I hope they use her again!  I believe the developers used a great amount of time, skill, labor, and talent to make this game.   Maybe they'll make a sequel without the dark side.

It's about a selfish man who took her daughter so he could live another 200 years as rich, successful, and powerful. He foolishly signed a contract with the devil.  The mom races to rescue her child who is sucked through a mirror. She has to recapture 7 demons (lust, greed, deceit, laziness, etc.) I never got bored.

HOG's are a variety of hidden objects, matching objects that go together (bunny slippers + carrot), and performing actions (putting matches on a candle) so you can earn useful objects in the game. 

Pros:
-hint button for most brain teasers
-Journal that writes down your clues. You may still have to do the math and figure out patterns & sequences yourself. You will use a lot of logic and reasoning skills.
-Emphasizes family and love over fear.
-I don't recall any swearing.
-Actions are not all about making potions & magic, although there are some throughout.  You do mechanical
things, and lots of logical tasks.
- The game gives you a group of scenes  at a time for you to do before leveling you up.  So no walking back 50 locations to do something.  
- Lots of locations and activities makes it feel more like an adventure game than a HOG, which I like.

Cons:
- satanic rituals to perform, Ouija board, and lots of occultic symbolism. 
- May not be appropriate for kids with all the occult images, demon statues, carving and art everywhere.  People flop over dead a couple of times. A child is screaming & crying as she is being carried away by a figure in black.
- conjuring demons
- oppressive atmosphere
- Some imagery is actually scary or intimidating.
- Using evil to defeat evil.
-everytime I restarted the game, I had to ""sign a contract with the devil"" to play.

Плюсы:
1. Игра длиннее обычных игр из жанра ""Я ищу"".
2. Головоломки не самые затасканные и относительно сложные.
3. Сцены поиска предметов тоже не самые простые. Надо тщательно искать.

Минусы:
1. Игра длиннее обычных игр из жанра ""Я ищу"" за счёт очень долгих анимаций. В сценах поиска предметов, в кат-сценах, да вообще везде. Включая беготню между локациями в отсутствии фаст тревела. Ещё и подгрузки между главами. Да что там, чтобы начать игру, надо ждать очень долго, пока пройдёт анимация на кнопке ""Играть"". Да где вы вообще видели, чтобы вас не пускали поскорее в игру? А как вам сами собой пропадающие записки, которые не успел прочитать и надо заходить в журнал? А там этот текст ещё мельче.
2. Некоторые головоломки решаются просто поочерёдным нажатием на все кнопки.
3. Сцены поиска предметов по большей части сложны тем, что всё тусклое, обесцвеченное. Пойди найди что-то, когда все предметы сливаются с фоном.
4. Не знаю, по какой причине, но игра идёт в разрешении 4:3, без растягивания - справа и слева будут чёрные полосы. Я не знаю, в каком году сделали игру, но это бесчеловечно так поступать в любом случае.
5. Сюжет трогать не буду - он тут как в порно, нужен просто для галочки. Да и во всех играх жанра ""Я ищу"" такая ситуация.

Если и будете покупать - делайте это по скидке, но не запускайте игру. А если запустили, то могу пожелать вам только терпения. Всё остальное тут не нужно.",1633810318,1633810866,False,4,0,0.551296830177307129,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Что еще огромный плюс - это самостоятельная часть и ненужно искать продолжение.

Наша главная героиня - мать-одиночка по имени Соня. Она получает письмо от странного джентльмена, в котором её
приглашают в особняк, чтобы поделиться важной информацией о её дочери Лизе. Приняв это странное приглашение, гг оказалась в путана опасное приключение, где ей предстоит узнать зловещее прошлое семьи Макгроу и причины похищения Джоном её дочери.

Скорость текста в повествовании контролировать невозможно, что может привести к пропуску некоторых сюжетных диалогов. 
И здесь на сцену выходит лучшее, что я видела в подобных играх - ДНЕВНИК! Наконец-то это полезный документ, помощник в игре, путеводная звезда. В дневнике действительно записана вся важная информация, его интересно читать и удобно использовать. Если хочется самому себе усложнить игру по максимуму, то отключаем все подсказки, гномом не пользуемся и ничего не пропускаем, тогда вы точно убедитесь насколько хорош дневник в этой игре по сравнению с другими в играх подобного жанра. 

Карты в игре нет, но игра делится на небольшие главы с несколькими локациями, потеряться будет сложно, как и пройти некоторые головоломки. Я вообще удивлена, что я всю игру прошла без пропусков. Головоломок реально очень много и они всюду, ты шкаф боишься открывать, зная что игре мало того, что ты с огромным трудом добыл ключ и информацию, она хочет прокачать твой интеллект до 200, и она его прокачает. В какой-то момент я решала головоломки, не понимая как я это сделала, они просто собирались под кликом моей мышки. До сих пор думаю, как правильно нужно было собирать головоломку с черепами на люке, почему она засчиталась пройденной? 

Соглашусь со многими, самым нудным в игре, оказался поиск предметов по парам. На экране их реально много, что кликабельно ты не знаешь, за ошибку получай туман в лицо и жди возможности продолжить играть. Некоторые предметы спрятаны максимально по м***чески. Например: Листик с картины, почти возле шапки гнома и заметила я его, когда впервые подумала сдаться, соты в виде плитки на стене и т.п. 

В такие игры играют не из-за сюжета, хотя общая атмосфера важна и для чего все это делается, а из-за как раз этих головоломок.  Поэтому нет смысла в подобное играть, если тебе не нравятся головоломки. Они основной механизм игры. И да, для этого жанра нормально использовать упоротые вещи для прохождения дальше или после первого применения выкидывать полезные предметы, как: нож, ножницы, монтировка. Такие миры создают чокнутые механики, запихивающие механизмы в любые предметы мебели и не только, открывающие странными брошками, плитками и т.п.

Hidden Object Game, object finding is a little hard on the eyes but overall ok, the story is some dude steals your adopted child who turns out to be the last descendant of the dude's family. He's made a deal with the devil and intends to sacrifice the kid to live for another 200 years and retain his magic powers.

Along the way you capture his demons (gremlin-like representations of some of the capital sins) and solve a bunch of puzzles to progress.

     2/5 Stars - This game could have been great! I do still recommend it but with a caution attached. While playing, I had two technical issues which I have explained in detail below. To be fair, they could just be ""out of the ordinary"" type of issues. I really like this game and would have given a rating of 4/5 stars, but I took one star off for the two technical issues I had, and took another star off for the games cut scenes and dialogues that moved way to quick for me. Neither of these things are reason enough for me to not recommend this game. 

GAME GENRE:
     Single Player, Hidden Object, Point n Click, Puzzle, Casual, Mystery, Female Protagonist

GAME DESCRIPTION:
     Release Date: Dec. 2015 - You play the game as Sonya trying to find your daughter. Traveling from place to place through mirrors, solving puzzles, and gathering info about the past. Discover the truth about the ""Contract with the Devil.""

KID FRIENDLY:
     (First know that I am very strict on kid approved material. A game with a standard rating of ""PG"" I might rate ""PG-13"". These are my ratings and have nothing to do with standard ratings)

     I rate this ""PG-13"" with thoughts of moving it to ""R"" for kids sake. Beware of some spooky images, and the referencing of having a contract with the devil. All of which might be too much for some kids. 

ACHIEVEMENTS:
     19 Achievements ranging from easy to moderate to obtain.

TRADING CARDS:
     7 Trading cards

PROS:
     -Interesting and fun
     -Great job chaining puzzles together
     -The storyline was good (what I caught of it)
     -Plenty of good puzzles

CONS:
     -A few times in the game some voices speak computerized jibberish
     -Within some puzzles there are a few ""logical pairs"" that don't make sense
     -There is a few hidden objects vs their written description which are wrong
     -Scenes go by too fast to read and watch what is going on
     -A couple technical issues with the game (see ""Problems/Issues"")

GAMEPLAY:
     Gameplay is good. My only issue would be that you can't quickly click on the hidden objects one right after another because the game likes to celebrate you finding an object. But I think this is how a lot of hidden object games are. I just happened to notice it more in this game than others.

VISUAL EFFECTS:
     Good clean graphics.

AUDIO:
     Some voices are jibberish talk and sound computerized, but I only heard it a few times throughout the game. Nothing that would ruin the games experience. Music and other audio sounds are good.

STORYLINE:
     Pretty interesting storyline, but I wish I caught more of it. You can not control moving on to the next dialogue box, the game does it for you. Unfortunately, the dialogue throughout the whole game moves pretty quick. With fast dialogue boxes during cut scenes you basically have no chance on reading and watching what is going on.

REPLAY VALUE:
     Replay value is good. I might tackle this game again later to piece together the things I missed.

PROBLEMS/ISSUES:
     No problems installing the game, or starting the game up. I did have two technical issues though. The first one was about halfway through when I received an error message while trying to complete a puzzle (locs_text_5_6_1_06). I could not figure out why this happened or even how to fix it, so I had no choice but to create another account and start the game over. During my second time through the game is when I had the other technical issue. Around 3/4 of the way through I received a runtime error message and the game ended up quitting on it's own. I started the game back up, and had no issues after that. I do still recommend this game only because these issues seem out of the ordinary to me.

WORDS FOR DEVELOPERS:
     So much potential with this game. If only you allowed the viewer to move through the story at their own pace instead of forcing the dialogue and cut scenes to push through so quickly.

The game was okay for the most part, but there were some drawbacks. I’ll go with a thumbs up because I liked the puzzle with logical pairs.

This is a hidden object game (HOG) with an unusual feature. Some hidden object puzzles do not give you a list of objects to find. Instead you have to find a number of logical pairs, two items that are connected. For example, a hammer and a nail. If you click on the hammer, the hammer will be highlighted. If you then click on the nail, you made a match and both the hammer and the nail will vanish. If you find the hammer, but not the nail, then the hammer just stays there. So, the challenge is not just to find hidden objects, but to figure out what might be a match. I thought that was a good change of pace.

The story isn’t too bad, but the text sometimes went by too quickly. I think most of the puzzles were reasonable, but for some items, the hitboxes were too small. I’m not a big fan of “find the hotspot”. Also, this game does not have a built-in map. Once you’ve played a few games with an interactive map, it just seems like an obvious feature to have and it’s disappointing when not available.

There were some glitches when running this game and it actually crashed once, but I was able to finish it. I was able to get all the achievements, but some people have had problems such that they needed to uninstall the game and clear out the registry in order to get a couple of achievements.

With that out of the way, I was incredibly disappointed with this game in the long run. The first problem is there is zero replay ability, now that isn't the fault of the developers or anything as some games are just made to be played one time, but I kind of thought there might be a new game plus mode or something. The cinematic scenes are rather bland and the story is a bit dry and predictable, but the game play is what probably frustrated me the most. The hidden object portion of the game was fairly standard, but there are some pieces which you have to create in order to click on. Usually that would create a fun challenge like it does in other hidden object games! In this case their interactive objects were so easy to find the only difference between creating the object and clicking one already made was literally 2 clicks and common sense so readily available that a toddler could probably figure it out. Need a lit candle? Well it just so happens to be a box of matches right next to the unlit candle... But as hidden object mini games go, it was fairly standard and more or less what I expected. What I didn't expect was the incredible amount of crashes. In my play through of this game, which I played it a couple of times to see if I had missed anything (I didn't) I crashed probably 6 or 7 times and had to redo entire puzzles because of it. There was one game that stood out to me, it was a find the logical pairs game and I must say, they did really well with this! You have to find X number of logical pairs and that's all the information you have, it was fun, interesting, challenging, and I liked that you weren't given an item list, you had to use intuition. Thumbs up for this puzzle! The cursor in the game is rather huge and for some reason the oddest specificity in where you click is required in the weirdest of places. You have to put all the ingredients on the table, but the last item just won't go down? Well that is because you are approximately five pixels away from where they want you to click the table. I ran into this on multiple occasions, I got so confused sometimes I had to click the hint which literally highlighted the exact area I clicked. The music gets mind numbing enough to make you wonder if your brain is leaking through out your ears, but I've definitely heard worse soundtracks, so this is a fairly meh point for the game. It's not making you want to throw you speakers out the window, but you are probably not going to jump for joy when generic soundtrack part II loops for the eighteenth time. I had multiple puzzles break on me and forced me to restart my game, I had locations break on me on two separate occasions which left me staring at a black screen and yet another restart and if you were expecting a twist, shock of shocks, you will be incredibly disappointed. After the first five minutes of this game you should be able to give an accurate synopsis to whatever person you wish to bore to tears of the entire game! At least they are transparent? I feel I should also mention that there is literally next to no penalty for just spam clicking as well. You get a very very minor tap on the wrist when the game puts up a fog of no clicky anymore for about 2 seconds and that is literally it. No timers, nothing that adds any pressure to any of the mini games so feel free to take all the time in the universe because for some of the more convoluted puzzles, you might actually need that much time. Seriously, some of the mini games are just tedious and have no rhyme or reason for how they work, I think two of them were literally a guessing game for me. Maybe I just didn't see the correct method or there was a pattern I missed and if that's the case, it's my own dumb fault, but man I love the lack of punishment in all the games! It really gets rid of any sense or urgency or panic that most Hidden Object games have some way of instilling to keep the game play interesting. I've really beat this game into the dust, from it's pointless transition cinematic scenes to the buggy game play, so I want to soften the blows a little and talk about the good for a minute. This is a very simple hidden object game, story and occasional bugs/frustrating controls (How is that possible when you literally just need a left mouse button I have no idea) aside it functions (usually) just like it should. There are some pretty fun puzzles and challenges sprinkled throughout and as a game it does exactly what it claims to do. If you are looking for a fairly cheap and simple game of a Hidden Object variety with some fun puzzles and you honestly don't care much about the story or enjoy getting a laugh out of painfully funny cut scenes and ridiculous reasons for needing to do something, then this game really is perfect for you. I think my disappointment in the game came from the first play through where I was playing for the story, but on my second play through (Which is where I realized nothing is randomized so you can literally memorize the Hidden Object Puzzles and such...yay for zero replay ability part II) I just enjoyed the humor in the game! Like how the protagonist can't lift the lid off a butter dish because it is too oily and absolutely needs a nob for the top of the dish which is missing in the weirdest place ever to lift that incredibly greasy lid, or the fact that you can't push a cart out of the way because it is too heavy, but you can lift it straight up to install a wheel (on your own I might add) so you can roll it out of the way. I could go on and on, but I don't want to spoil all the fun of discovering these insane ""reasons"" for needing oddly specific items which show up in the most bizarre and unbelievable places. As Hidden Object games go, I did have fun with this one, but the negatives just far outweigh the positives for me so I can't really recommend it, but if you love Hidden Object games and you enjoy a good laugh pick this game up on a sale (I did) and just play through it leisurely. You will enjoy yourself and you'll hit a couple challenging parts which are pretty satisfying to solve. Just don't hold your breath on the story because I have seen five year olds and who can write a more compelling plot and probably animate it at least as well as this game managed. Overall, just sub par compared to many of the Hidden Object games I have played, but fun if you like to pick apart some really weird and confusing stuff.",1581931888,1581931888,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Довелось пройти спорную по оценкам игру в жанре поиска предметов, которая мне пришлась по душе, что нельзя сказать про подавляющее большинство других игроков, но я склоняюсь к тому, что многие из них впервые обратились в сторону этого жанра, а как вы знаете, друзья, поиск предметов никогда не претендовал на лавры и овации.
И так, товарищи, перед нами Contract With The Devil! Игрушка несомненно средняя, но это присуще всему жанру в целом. Мы имеем внятную сюжетную линию, которая имеет начало и логический конец, так что никаких Вам бесящих to be continued...
Основным развлечением для игрока по классическому наполнению будет...поиск предметов на экране, а еще поиск связанных между собой вещей. Именно на вторую головоломку больше всего помоев вылили обзорщики, но для меня такое поведение осталось тайной. В игре вполне все логично и понятно, но я забываю в каком обществе живу, так что давайте продолжим.
В данной игре есть масса побочных головоломок, но если вы ленитесь их пройти, ну или для вас они слишком сложны, то всегда можно пропустить трудности. С одной стороны это упрощает игру до безобразия, но опять же не будем забывать про контингент нашего любимого магазина.
Очень понравилась продолжительность игрушки. Обычно финальную сцену мы замечаем спустя 2-3 часа после старта игры, а Contract With The Devil дарит игроку от 5 до 8 часов приключений, а еще достижения, карточки и возмутительно низкую цену на скидках. С таким набором достоинств просто грешно ставить отрицательный палец.
Contract With The Devil не претендует занят слот вашей любимой игры, но она прекрасно скрасит промежуток между прохождением ААА гигантов. Хочу поблагодарить всех за отдачу и лайки, берегите нервы и избегайте шлака в магазине.

Its winning element is probably the visuals, it was definitely well made, the lighting and background were wonderful. Overall, the graphics definitely rival Artifex Mundi games.

The biggest flaw, I have to agree, is the game's functionality. The hit boxes were pretty tight which made tiny objects unclickable, and I found myself accidentally clicking out of the hidden object scene repeatedly. There's also the issue of having difficulty navigating, sometimes you can fail to recognize if a spot can be zoomed in/walked towards, and some inventory items were pretty hard to miss. I also think there was a lot of backtracking towards the end, which a map with fast travel could have helped ease the time consuming trips.

I don't have much issue with the story. It's a fairly standard HOG theme and I didn't find it particularly boring nor interesting. The demons were a nice touch but I wish they could have been utilized a little more to the story.

The puzzles were fun, there were some unique ones I've never played in other games before. It's pretty much a mixed bag of  ridiculously easy, amusing, or downright tedious (anything with rotating jumbled pieces using buttons would drive me up the wall though).

There are a couple glitches in the game as well, sometimes I would experience black screens between two locations and would be forced to restart the game. Restarting always fixes it. There's also the issue of the number in logic matching to be askew with the rest of the sentence.

Overall, it's okay, it's playable (even if I got lost some of the time). It's about 4 hours long and it's time well spent for me. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes HOGs and isn't too fussy about glitches.",1560349708,1560349708,True,2,0,0.53125,0,False,False,False,False,,,

All things considered, I think this level of pixel-perfect frustration warrants a thumbs down for the game, despite the good things going for it. Did the developers not do any gameplay testing? And really no tester complained about this?

Yet another annoyance: as so many others have pointed out, sometimes the on-screen text goes by far too quickly. Do the developers really not want us to know the game story?!

And if that's not enough: puzzle bugs. I solved the honey puzzle fair and square, but because it wasn't in the predetermined path, it was considered a failure. Seriously?

Unsere liebe Tochter Lisa wurde von einer mysteriösen Existenz entführt. Wir müssen uns durch Spiegelwelten rätseln, kleine Gnome besiegen und so manchen Gegenstand finden, um unsere Tochter wieder in die Arme schließen zu können.

Spielmechanisch sind wir im ganz klassischen Wimmelbild-Wahnsinn, in dem es in Screens darum geht, bestimmte Objekte zu finden. Wie meist üblich kommen noch eine große Menge an Schiebe- Kombinations- oder Code-Rätseln hinzu, alles aufgelockert durch wenige kurze Cutscenes.

Das von Mystik nur so triefende Szenario wirkt an einigen Stellen recht bemüht. Daß alles irgendwie mit Magie angefüllt erscheint, scheint doch reichlich an den Haaren herbeigezogen und vor allem deswegen so gebaut, um Logiklöcher möglichst leicht zu stopfen.

Technisch funktioniert das Spiel allerdings gut. Nur zwei Dinge sind etwas schwierig. Die Auflösung ist nicht für große Monitore gemacht, so daß man das Game entweder im Fenster oder unscharf spielen muß. Und die ansonsten gute deutsche Übersetzung hat in seltenen Fällen Ungenauigkeiten (so wird eine normale Nadel mit Faden zum Beispiel als Sicherheitsnadel bezeichnet). Neben diesen Punkten gibt es allerdings technisch nichts zu meckern.

Die Rätsel, oft Schiebe- und Kombinationsrätsel, sind teils einfach, teils auch fordernd, können aber im normalen Modus auch immer übersprungen werden.

Alles in allem ein nicht schlechtes, sehr durchschnittliches Hidden-Object-Spielchen, das sich vor allem an diejenigen richtet, denen die Rätsel wichtiger sind als eine irgendwie logische oder auch nur gut erzählte Geschichte.

- горе перевод предметов - аж два болта в поиске предметов, один из которых болт а другой гайка.а так же нога оказалась куриной лапой. 
- и раздражающие голоса мелких п%@&ков грехов. 
- раздражающая заставка которая сначала меня впечатлила, а потом уже бесила, так как нужно было ждать когда скример сработает.

TLDR: Unintuitive puzzle design revolving around guessing what the dev considers to be a logical pair of items. Inventory puzzles and walk clicker navigation.

While the art is servicable, the general setting is a thin paranormal story in which you are catapulted. The little gnome talks in what seems to be scrambled foreign language with the tone modified through software. It does not sound good.

Making logical pairs is easy to get stuck on, and those kind of games are sometimes walkthrough oriented but not for the hidden object sections usually. This is really unfortunate as it kills the pace.

The art was alright but it seemed to warp, distort to fit the screen and the viewing experience suffered as a result.

Unfortunately the game doesn't know whether it should concentrate on the horror or the cuteness factor (the 2 are kind of mutually exclusive) and there are some bugs present. The game is still good, but could have been much better.

Sonya receives a letter from a person named John McGraw, stating he has some information regarding her daughter. Upon his invitation the mother decides to pay this [strike]strange[/strike] completely normal man a visit, in his mansion. On arrival, she is asked to take a look at - or rather into - a mirror (?), which she does and whoosh, her daughter is taken by a sinister entity. Before the portal closes (because that's what the mirror really is) a leprechaun jumps out (!) of it. He introduces himself as a household spirit (whatever that is) and offers his help in finding and saving Sonya's daughter.
The title pretty much foreshadows what we might expect during our adventure.

The game features some refreshing puzzles (which I prefer in these types of games) - mixed with the usual hidden object scenes - like finding and matching logical pairs (horse - horsehoe, flower - watering can, etc.), some (plenty of) reassembling tasks and creative minigames realted to little demons.
We have to defeat/capture the mentioned 7 little demons representing the 7 deadly sins (however instead of lust and pride, there's anger and power lust for some reason). Finding all 7 of them will take us to many exciting locations, such as an ice world or old places from the past of John McGraw, until the point where we can finally confront the evil antagonist.
The problem with these demons is that their design isn't really scary, but kind of childish looking and it pretty much ruins the general creepy atmosphere of the game. To make things worse they don't speak, but mumble (or I don't even know how to call that sound they make) in a really irritating manner.
Additional story elements and clues can be found on notes, which I always like, so much better than trying to guess 'where should I go, what should I do now?'. Our diary is very useful and does contain information which can help us if we get stuck. As we proceed we'll have the opportunity to watch plenty of cutscenes telling the story of John McGraw and even our own, furthermore of Lisa (our daughter) through flashbacks.

The game has its fair share of bugs: I had to restart (delete the profile and make a new one) the game since it kept on skipping the minigames automatically for no apparent reason at first (2nd time it worked fine though). Occasionally some of the texts are displayed in Ukrainian, despite having played it in English plus there's no voice acting (only in the intro) and the subtitles disappear way too fast sometimes. Another issue is that there are HO scenes where clicking on an object does not always register at first. The game also froze once. It's a shame these aren't fixed, since this is one of the advantages of platforms such as Steam: developers can fix and update their game anytime.

The graphics are nice and atmospheric (for a HOG) with plenty of spooky, outdoor locations and dynamic background elements. Unfortunately the game uses the old 1024x768 standard resolution from the pre-2010 era, so it doesn't look too good on 16:9 screens. The movement of the characters look weird in the cutscenes sometimes, but otherwise they are also well made.

Even though the sound effects are generally good, they appear to be mono, which is a shame since some of the recent HOGs have very good environmental audio. As mentioned, the voice-over only exists in the opening cutscene but even there it's barely audible because the sound effects and the music suppress it.

Despite its flaws (the bugs mostly) [i]Contract with The Devil[/i] is still a pretty good hidden object game with challenging puzzles and fun minigames, so if you like the genre, give it a try and since none of the bugs are game-breaking and a restart always works, they can be overlooked.

PROS
+ nice artwork
+ good puzzles and minigames
+ plenty of cutscenes
+ low price tag for its length

CONS
- a handful of bugs
- atmosphere is killed by the little ""demons""
- mono sound, no voice-over
- 1024x768 resolution

Mamy tutaj klasyczne ""znajdź rzeczy z listy"" oraz logiczne pary, które polegają na znajdowaniu kombinacji przedmiotów (np. mysz i pułapka na myszy czy klucz i kłódka). Oprócz tego klasycznie co jakiś czas natrafimy na minigrę.

Poziom trudności rozgrywki można określić jako zbalansowany - na scenach z ukrytymi obiektami przedmioty, ktorych szukamy nie odróżniają się od tła, ale wyraźnie je widać. Niektóre minigry mogą stanowić wyzwanie, ale jest też kilka prostych. Tak naprawdę największym wyzwaniem było sterowanie, jeżeli można tak nazwać klikanie w HOG'u. Gra chodzi bardzo topornie. Wiele razy musiałam kilkukrotnie klikać w prawidłowy obiekt w scenie, żeby w końcu go złapać. Co prawda za każdym razem ostatecznie wszystko działało, ale było to dość irytujące. 

Pod względem fabularnym występuje tu ciekawy podział na rozdziały. Zakończenie danego fragmentu rozgrywki stanowi otworzenie portalu z lustra, znajdującego się gdzieś w lokacjach, do których mamy dostęp. Przechodzimy na zmianę między prawdziwym światem, a światem ""lustrzanym"" w poszukiwaniu kolejnego z siedmiu demonów. Każdy jest manifestacją jednego z grzechów głównych.

Osiągnięcia są raczej standardowe dla tego typu gry - większość odblokujemy po prostu przechodząc całość, pozostałe to ukończenie wszystkich scen z ukrytymi obiektami bez podpowiedzi, rozwiązanie wszystkich minigier bez ich pomijania, znalezienie określonej liczby przedmiotów w określonym czasie itp. Wszystkie można zdobyć w jednej rozgrywce na dowolnym poziomie trudności.

Co tu dużo mówić, mimo problemów z klikaniem gra jest nadal warta polecenia jako całkiem przyjemna, dopracowana produkcja z gatunku HOG.",1533799468,1533799468,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I finished it because of the achievements, but dear lord. This has got to be one of the worst HO games I've ever played, just from the glitches and pickiness of the puzzles alone.

-Nie można pominąć niektórych filmików. (Podróż łódką na wyspę wściekłego jeżą)

Unfortunately, the game also has some annoying issues. At times, the hit detection suffers; there are also several times where the game forces you to go back and forth because it would not let you pick up an item the first time you were in the area.
The biggest problem, however, lies in two of the gimmicks this game uses. The first is that instead of a simple hidden objects scene, some scenes want you to select logical pairs. Sadly, while all of the pairs do have something in common, there is no similarity between pairs. In one scene you may be required to pair a tool and what the tool works on, two tools, two animals that share the same broad classification, and an animal and a tool that goes with that animal. Between scenes, a flower can go with a vase in one picture but a leaf in another, and while it is true that flowers logically go in vases and flowers and leaves are both logically parts of plants, using both as logical pairs in a puzzle shows a distinct lack of pattern recognition. It wouldn't be so bad if each scene had a similar set of relationships between what you are looking for, but no, instead you must first guess at which objects are clickable and then at which relationship they are looking for - I know that I was disappointed when the picture of fire and the cut logs did not go together since logically cut logs should be burned, .
The second gimmick is in the hidden objects scenes. The first thing to realize is that the entire scene has potential objects in it, despite the artists deliberately setting them to draw the eye to the center. Just because, for instance, you are looking at, say, a painting, doesn't mean that objects are not hidden in the wallpaper outside the frame. No, wait, this is annoying, since the scenes are set up in a way that implies everything is inside a certain area. I'd like to say this is a clever way to play on the players perceptions, but no. This is made even worse by the mist animation used when you make too many mistakes - this mist covers the edges of the screen which implies that everything you are looking fore is towards the center, but no, the mist can in fact cover objects that you are looking for since you need to be looking towards the edges for some items. The other, more important problem, lies in the combination items where two items must first be combined before you can click on it to find it. Some of these are simple - combine a wheel with a wheelless carriage to make a carriage, or combine a fork with a spoon to make cutlery, but they are hampered by bad hit detection. They are also hampered by inconsistent choices in what needs combinations. There are many times when a picture, etching, or drawing of an object counts as that object. This then leads to the question of why some objects that are obvious need combining - there is the potential in one scene to need to first click on scissors, then on the butterfly, in order to cut out the butterfly picture. Again, this would not be too bad if it were not for the other times when a picture counts as the object without any manipulation needed. 
As for the puzzles, they are mostly standard puzzles with skins appropriate to this story. Most of them should be familiar and there was nothing particularly exciting about them. 
As is standard, the replay ability of this game is minimal since while the hidden object scenes do have enough stuff in them that not everything is the same, many of the items will be, and the other puzzles are mostly static.

To conclude, if you are interested in this game you should probably just watch the cut-scenes, then go play a different hidden objects game.",1518498157,1518498157,False,4,0,0.556324601173400879,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Не замечаешь свою ЖАДНОСТЬ,
Ведь целей больше нет иных.

К другому подошёл успех,
Ты с ЗАВИСТЬЮ остался.
Успех не посещает всех,

Прожив порядком сотню лет,
Ни в чём не извлеку уроков.
Лекарства от ошибок нет -
Останусь я рабом пороков.

[i] Contract With The Devil[/i] от студии [i] AZ-Art Development Studio[/i] очень уж сильно напоминает почерк студии [i] Jetdogs Studios[/i]. Игры от этих ребят похожи настолько, что даже плагиатом не назовёшь. Будто у [i] Jetdogs Studios[/i] были какие-то разногласия и одна часть сотрудников ушла и весь 2015 год трудилась под другим именем, а потом как сквозь землю провалилась. [url=kazan.hh.ru/employer/740735] Хотя вакансии в студию имеются [/url], только не упадите с хохоту.

Что первые, что вторые мастера разлагать простую сюжетную историю до уровня сериалов канала «россия 1». Больше в этом пункте даже пояснять ничего не нужно.

В играх, построенных исключительно на поисках предметов и решение головоломок, что первые, что вторые мастера превращать гемпейную часть в пытку. Тут вам и набор глупых действий и глупых решений. Чтобы что-то обычное достать нужно вставить предмет в шкаф, а потом решить головоломку. Причём конкретно у [i] AZ-Art Development Studio[/i] это доходит до настоящего абсурда. Весь этот проклятый дом просто усыпан головоломками. Надо открыть ящик? Найдите сперва ключ, а потом решите головоломку, хотя поблизости имеются необходимые предметы, которые помогли бы добраться до цели менее аккуратно, но значительно быстрее. Помимо классических сцен с поиском предметов добавили сцены с поиском логических пар (например, лук и стрела). Вам нужно найти 12 или 16 предметов, а на экране их чуть ли не 30, а то и больше. Прокликивать всё нельзя. После 4-ех быстрых промахов, на экране появляется туман, который продержится секунды 3-4, и можно продолжать. Кстати, почему-то коса и вилы с чего-то вдруг логически не сочетаются, и таких примеров полно. Но самое главное, что, перебирая весь этот хлам, вы возьмёте совершенно иной предмет. Так, перерыв целую повозку с ширпотребом, мы подберём мехи, которыми разгоним бабочек, ведь ничем другим нельзя прогнать пугливых насекомых, на крайней случай убить. Видимо разработчикам в детстве нравилось ковыряться в бабушкиных шкафах, переполненными всяким хламом былых лет.

Удивительно, но [i] AZ-Art Development[/i] не делали хоррор вставки для самой игры. Зато они их сделали в меню, в итоге нам нужно терпеливо подождать секунд 10, пока дьявол попытается нас напугать, после чего выдаст пункт «продолжить». С таким трюком разработчики запоздали лет 50 так. Что графика, что музыка, что звуки у первых и вторых одинаковы, разве, что у продуктов от [i] Jetdogs Studios[/i] анимация несколько плавнее. Но для тех, кто не привык смотреть, как пытаются заставить дерево шевелиться, это всё будет в виде погрешности.

Если вы где-то застряли, но скорее всего вам ужасно надоел процесс прохождения, то разработчики вам дали возможность пропускать головоломки и использовать подсказки. Но [i] Contract With The Devil[/i] целиком и полностью состоит из этих частей. Т.е. по сути вы пропускаете игру, теряя настроение и время.

1. A couple of interesting puzzles.

The Meh
1. No voice acting (other than some incomprehensible demon gibberish).
2. Sound levels are inconsistent, there are times I thought my speakers were muted, so I turned the volume up, to be nearly deafened in the next area.
3. Easily forgettable story, characters and plot with the mildly cute and amusing daemons literally being the only saving grace.
4. Lazy animations, an example is at one stage you have to build a boat to get to an island and in the transition animation of the boat rowing to the island, there's no one in the boat.
5. The puzzles are either very easy or rather challenging.

The bad
1. Fixed low resolution, bearable at 1080p (just).
2. Buggy (once had a C++ runtime error crash and another time a black screen loaded with just the hud when transitioning).
3. Hidden object game mistakes, most notable a scalpel was actually a pair of tweezers and a lire was actually a lyre.

Sonya quickly wishes she didn't accept such invitation, as the Devil himself appears and kidnaps Lisa, leaving behind a mother in tears but also convinced in bringing her little girl back.

This is the journey of a mother to reunite with her daughter and keep her away from darkness once and for all.
Because of such traverse storyline with an interesting middle twist, we get to enjoy a story tangled between the present and the past. In order to uncover the deepest secrets, Sonya must travel between mirrors, to unveil family secrets, and ultimately undo the contract with the devil that ties her daughter to such events.
With such great story development, we end up spoiled with great visuals across this first game by [i]AZ-Art Development Studio[/i], that bet all in for a fantastic experience.
In-game options are limited, in particular the lack of resolution choices, as limits the visual quality, which is the main focus of Hidden Object games. Other than that, the quality is as good as expected, and due to extreme diversity the game actually offers a solid visual experience.
As gameplay goes, choosing between the system and game's cursor is a nice option, and in-game vsync is on by default, which is good for some users! Puzzles range from easy to medium difficulty, and HoC are available in the traditional system, and an interesting mode in which the objective is to find pairs of objects, without any hints. Not as hard as it seems, and it was a good feature since there aren't that many HoC sequences.
To make the gameplay even more appealing, we get to collect seven little demons, that represents the seven deadly sins, and lock them in a special small box. Ideas like these are exactly what HoC need, more and more!
Audio-voices aren't available, so cutscenes are displayed with just subtitles, but a new language was created for the seven little demons.

Visiting different locations from past and present, dealing with the devil and a cursed offspring, Sonya sure is a mother of courage, and so is young Lisa.
[b]Contract With The Devil[/b] is a great adventure that suits perfectly well for everyone willing to dive in an adventure of the occult, and to help us, we have an interesting leprechaun as a companion who's always ready to give away some hints.

Although the leprechaun and the stupid ""demons"" are ugly as hell. It's this kind of ""cute ugly"" like someone would design them if they like those ugly Trolls toys. Makes me want to vomit.
Has no proper widescreen support which is bad if the game was really released in 2015. Game crashed once and stuck on a black screen another time. It seems like it really doesn't like the player to click somewhere if there is an animation playing. Luckily the automatic saves seem to be frequent and you barely lose progress, actually none. 
And when will devs learn that cutscene narration and sound effects shouldn't be controlled by the music volume slider? If you turn off the music, you get silent cutscenes. Stupid.
BTW, the animations are the most annoying feature. Normally you can't do anything if an animation is playing. This starts on the start menu where you can't click PLAY until the ""devil"" is done wiggling the scroll. This destroyed most of the trial and error puzzles for me because I hated waiting for the animation of every little move to finish. Speaking about puzzles, there are very forgettable and, like I said, trial and error, which isn't fun. In the end I skipped most of them.
Hint meter recharges quickly, which actually made me finish the game, because I couldn't be bothered with the ""adventuring"" in the second half of the game. Some of the steps to advance seem very badly designed and not very logical. I don't mind the adventure part in HO games, but don't make it too convoluted. It also felt very repetitive, because the game is divided into parts and in every part you have to get a demon and charge a mirror. 
Some scene transitions are completely unnecessary, i.e. boat and lift. The game has no map or fast travel.

The HO scenes are ok, but nothing to write home about. They are relatively easy with only some badly designed items. The matching pair ones were mostly fine. 

Bottom line: get it for the art, but nothing else, if you really have to. Overall not a relaxing HO game: too many annoying things.",1507119743,1507119963,False,7,0,0.553445816040039063,1,False,False,False,False,,,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Fiquei bastante surpresa, pq geralmente essas coisas q vc recebe de graça são umas tremendas desgraças. Porém não foi o caso de Contract with The Devil. Como a própria developer diz: é um jogo casual, para quando vc quer algo diferente e mais tranquilo. Dá pra se divertir bastante, sem que fique fácil demais q enjoe ou dificil demais q vc desista.

 Vc recebe uma carta suspeita de John McGraw que precisa falar contigo urgente lá na pqp, vc vai e oh, que supresa!  [spoiler] É uma armadilha para roubar a sua filha (adotiva) [/spoiler] e leva-la para o mundo dos espelhos. Você e um duende estranho vão resolvendo puzzles para desbloquear as fases e precisam coletar os vícios de cara lá. Aí Os bichos parecem uma versão meio cagada dos gremlins, mas vida q segue. Aliás, isso tira todo o clímax do jogo, não é nem engraçadinho nem suspense, mas, ainda sim, interessante. Daí vc precisar correr meio mundo pra impedir a cara q vendeu a alma pro cramunhão de fazer um ritual de troca com a sua filha que, oh que surpresa 2!, [spoiler] é a última descendente dos McGraws [/spoiler] . Com o prazo vencendo mais rápido q boleto de internet, ele vai trocar a menina por mais 200 anos de vida. E o seu trabalho nisso, tudo é salvar a menina, dar um cacete no McGraw e enfrentar o kapeta itself !
      Alguns puzzles são bem desafiadores (tem o botão skip, caso vc não queira queimar neurônio nisso) mas quando vc precisa achar os objetos é muito díficil de ver, tipo, é escuro e desfocado, quase impossível de passar sem hint. Além deste, o de juntar objetos ""lógicos"" nem sempre parece muito lógico, virando mais um jogo de doido.
     Os sons do jogo não são muito mil grau não, as personagens não são dubladas e os textos são virados num F1 (e em inglês). São as caixas de textos mais rápidas do Velho Oeste. Nada que realmente atrapalhe o gameplay. Os gráficos são aqueles clássicos de point-n'-click.",1503194152,1503194244,True,3,0,0.55272209644317627,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Una grafica interessante ed immersiva che va però a scontrarsi con un'immensa ripetitività nel cercare gli oggetti che ci servono (eccessiva addirittura per un HOG); unità ad una giocabilità lenta dovuta all'impossibilità di saltare qualsiasi animazione/dialogo e alla approssimativa hitbox degli oggetti ne consegue una enorme perdita di tempo e uno stato di NOIA che probabilmente Vi porterà ad odiare questo titolo nonostante siate amanti del genere.

E' da premiare il fatto che ci sia stata voglia nel creare un titolo e si vede che c'è del lavoro dietro, tuttavia risulta per niente godibile e quindi mi trovo a sconsigliarlo.

Contract with the Devil shows tremendous effort, but wastes it on a hidden object game where even some of the more fundamental HOG core design aspects are completely wrong.

This game is riddled with issues like terrible hit detection—the main menu can drop your input!—and repetitive item gathering (even by HOG standards), which all come together as boring at best, annoying at worst.
They are the smaller problem compared to the game’s tendency to waste time.  Not only the backtracking is downright ridiculous, but you also need to wait for every single frame of every animation to continue, as if the game is unable to cope with two things at once.

It tries to make up for it with astonishing visuals and the plot is decent for a HOG: we play as a mother trying to save her daughter from a pretty evil person who once made the titular contract with the devil. But, the game messes up even here, with dialogue so childish, so simplistic, it is almost insulting.",1487003733,1487003733,False,34,0,0.814092516899108887,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Даже если снизить планку до среднего уровня игр жанра ""поиск предметов"", всё равно данная игра заслуживает довольно низкой оценки.

Сюжет и графика - стандартные для игр такого жанра, а потому тут ни придраться, ни похвалить нельзя.

Звуковое сопровождение неплохое, но ничего особенного.
Озвучка идёт частичная, да и то символическая. Причём не в катсценах, а в отдельных диалогах. Это не столько полноценная озвучка, сколько просто неразборчивые звуки. Довольно прикольно, но выглядит крайне дёшево и однообразно. Плюс отсутствие озвучки в видео (несмотря на наличие диалогов) сильно выделяется на таком фоне. Хотелось бы, чтобы хоть реплики в видео тогда были не в виде субтитров, а ""вписаны"" в видео (например, всплывающими ""облаками"" или ещё как-нибудь).

Головоломки стандартные.
Поиск предметов не очень удобный из-за слишком сливающихся текстур и глючных хитбоксов (правильный предмет иногда выбирается лишь с 5-го клика по нему).
Поиск логических пар вызывает сложности по нескольким причинам. Первая: сложно определить какие предметы на локации интерактивны, а какие просто бэкграунд. Вторая: логичность пар иногда сомнительна. Иногда есть более логичные пары, но которые не считаются правильными. Иногда есть правильные пары, которые можно назвать логичными только с очень большой натяжкой.

Основная проблема этой игры, которая провоцирует бОльшую часть негативных эмоций, - медленные анимации. Они вызывают утомление и раздражение.
Что можно сказать, если уже в главном меню игры игроку приходится ждать секунд 15-30 прежде чем начнётся игра (при первом запуске - меньше)? Я объясню как это выглядит. После всех всутпительных видео появляется меню. Всё меню отображается и работает нормально. В центре экрана фигура Дьявола с ""контрактом"" в руке. Посреди этого контракта должна быть кнопка для начала игры. Почему ""должна быть""? Потому что несколько секунд нужно ждать когда каракули на контракте превратятся в слово ""Играть"". А потом после нажатия ты пытаешься сообразить: игра среагировала на нажатие или нет? Ведь снова долгая пауза, которая не сопровождается дополнительной анимацией или какой-либо реакцией от игры. Приходится нажимать много раз ""на всякий случай"". И только когда раздастся смех Дьявола понтно, что игра до чего-то додумалась.

Дальше игрок отметит медлительность анимаций когда будет проходить непосредственно поиск предметов. Потмоу что подбор предметов происходит ОЧЕНЬ медленно. При этом одновременно может убираться лишь один предмет. То есть каждый раз нужно дожидаться конца анимации, прежде чем выбирать следующий предмет. Как бы быстро вы всё ни нашли, процесс сбора предметов превращается в тягомотину.
В поиске ""пар"" это также присутствует, но не так раздражает. Просто потому что пары обнаруживаются зачастую медленнее сами по себе и спешка просто невозможна.

Ну и по ходу прохождения подолгу смотреть на каждое сверкание, сияние или иной эффект ""магичности"", возникающий в результате большинства правильных шагов по прохождению, надоедает. Вся игра выглядит крайне статично на таком фоне. Потому играется скучно.

Сомневаюсь, что мне удалось словами передать мои впечатления в полной мере. Но подведём итог.
Любителям жанра можно поиграть, если уж им такое нравится.
Ачивкохантерам взять на заметку. Игра не сложная, просто нудная по вышеуказанным причинам.
Остальным советую проходить мимо.

Type of Game: Hidden Object/Adventure Light

Genre: Mystery/Fantasy

In Short: Good variation in Hidden Object Scenes and Minigames, sadly a bugged game.

Rating: 5.5 out of 10.

The game suffers some bugs often related to the box of demons. For me only a restart was required to play on, where the game crashed. 

The story itself is nicely done although it suffers some lapses, the Hidden Object scenes are of medium to hard difficulty, the mingames offer a variety of different riddles, not all of them are simple to solve, some of them can even challenge people with a long line of experience; others are outragously simple - but still fun.

This is no collectors edition, therefore there are no extras included! But as it is the game isn't bad, the bugs can rob you the motivation to keep in playing though, and if you are lazy, you can solve the game in some very sloppy way too. All this gave me the opinion to give this game a slightly above average rating, because it could have been done better.

Recommendations: For Fans of Hidden Object Games, Adventurers and people that love mysteries.

[h1]Recommended[/h1] Albeit only by a margin.

All this, the game could have easily gotten into a higher rating, sadly the bugs and some of the other problems during gameplay (ESC in a HOS - instant Skipping, with item revealed) make this game an only nice to have.

Our protagonist is a single mother called Sonya. She receives a letter from a strange gentleman named John McGraw, inviting her to his mansion to share some urgent information about her daughter, Lisa. Accepting this odd invitation, Sonya visits John alongside Lisa, oblivious to the shocking occurrence that shall soon take place. As they were sharing a cup of tea, John invites Sonya to take a look at an antique mirror in his possession. As soon as the surface of the said mirror is revealed though, an eerie flash of light engulfs the room and John disappears alongside Lisa. Shaken and grief-stricken Sonya takes on a supernatural journey through a collection of mirror realms to take her daughter back to safety. As she progresses, she learns the ominous past of the McGraw family and John's reasons for abducting her daughter which concerns a contract... a contract with the Devil.

Quite Faustian, eh? I must say that I liked the concept of the game - and the design of the said Devil - a lot. Some real labor went into display properties, that's for sure. The art works are fascinating with a rich color palette. CGs and animations are flowingly beautiful. Sadly, there is no voice acting though and written narrative skips a bit fast, making it possible to miss some narration, yet it is always possible to track the story through your diary.

There is the mention of 7 Deadly Sins - a.k.a. 7 Hellish Vices and some quests revolving around some little demonic creatures concerning those vices, yet considering a HOG is supposed to be kid-friendly, their concepts are a bit dumbed down. There is not sin of Lust or Pride for some reason, yet there is Gambling or Power Lust etc. It sure is cute, but wrecks the lore and the authenticity. Then again, one shouldn't expect genuine Catholic lore from a HOG anyhow.

Item collection takes a bit of attention mostly. It is possible to miss an item if you are not careful enough. HOG scenes are various and enjoyable, yet sometimes a bit on the ridiculously hard part. Puzzles are quite challenging and intriguing too. There is no map option, but considering every chapter consists of 4-5 areas, it is not that big of a chore to backtrack.

The presentation is okay. The graphics look nice, the animations aren't really good and the sounds are odd at times. There's no voice for the characters, but that's not really a problem. That the text in the cutscenes is way too fast so that you can't read the story is though.

The minigames are okay, but the inventory based puzzles aren't. For example to use glue you have to put it on a table first. If you try to use the glue directly on the object that you want to fix it won't work. This happens all the time and to find what you really have to do without spamming the hint button is very obscure. One problem with the minigames is that the skip button is *very* close to the right border of the minigames, so it's too easy to accidently click it.

There are two kinds of hidden object scenes. Standard 'search object given as writen words' which aren't too bad and then there are scenes in which you have to find 'logical' pairs. The latter are again not enjoyable and you have to guess a lot to find those pairs. There's also a quite long disappearing animation which makes one achievement nearly impossible to get.

Overall the game plays very tedious and you will not get the whole story on the first playthrough. It might be worth a try if you don't have any other hidden object games to play, but otherwise I can't recommend this game.",1459594005,1459594005,False,68,3,0.85235673189163208,1,False,False,False,False,,,

this is one of the only hidden object games i've played that needs to load different areas/cut scenes, some of the hidden objects are hard to actully click on and i had to try about 10 - 20 times on one.
they didnt do any proper voice dialog and when they did it was just some random jibberish noise including for humans.
the actual play button on the tittle menu takes about 20 seconds after the title screen has loaded to appear and another 10 seconds or so to actully load the game after it's been pressed.
and finally they game seems to freeze with a black screen sometimes (happends to me about 3 or 4 times)

so over all the game plot is about average and the actual game mechanics are terrible so id suggest not buying this game or at least be prepared to get a refund after trying it.",1450469519,1450469519,False,21,0,0.669472098350524902,0,True,False,False,False,,,
