For those who don't: This is a hentai game featuring little girls. Even the steam version is extremely ecchi and full of fanservice which some people might find offensive.

That said, Little Witch Romanesque is a pretty good visual novel. The story is well-told if a little overly long at times. There are many genuinely likable characters and interesting plot beats to follow, a ton of replayability with many different mini plotlines to follow and girls to potentially romance.

LWR does have some gameplay elements to it as well. You take the role of an archmage training his two apprentices. Over the course of the game you'll be able to send them on quests which are essentially mini-stories which grow their abilities and can increase your affection levels with different characters, earn you collectible items, or diplomas which are important for determining what the girls do after they graduate. Each quest requires that the girls know certain spells. Spells are learned via spending Spirit in a skill tree type system, and Spirit is earned by doing lessons. Lessons are a dice-based minigame, but the player is allowed to fudge the dice a bit to get results you want; it rarely feels unfair.

So the basic gameplay loop is:
- find a quest you want to do and look at the required spells
- check the girls' skill trees so you know what you're aiming for
- Do lessons and learn the spells you need
- Do the quest

It's pretty simple and easy to understand, but many quests have a time limit attached to them and can lock you out of certain endings if they aren't completed so it's best to focus your efforts on quests for the one girl you're most interested in for your first playthrough.

My biggest issue with the game is that many scenes are extremely long in between gameplay sections, but if you're a veteran Visual Novel enjoyer that probably won't bother you. It's also a TINY resolution due to being pretty old.

Oyari Ashito is an excellent artist with a unique style, and if you like this game I would recommend another title they did called Quartett. The Voice acting in this game is also extremely professional and well-done for such a small production, dripping with character and emotion. It's also a manageable length. One playthrough will probably take you 10-15 hours, but you can easily stretch that to 30+ trying to see everything. 

There is also (of course) an uncensor patch one easy google away. It features a lot of unique art you'll miss if you play without it, and is fully voiced as well.",1699436065,1699436065,True,3,0,0.556227982044219971,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's a game I always come back to despite all these years that have gone by.

There is one important thing to think about before considering a purchase, though. There is some misinformation floating around that this version is the same as the PS2 one, which is not true. The console version was much more heavily censored (and had different gameplay). When I was new to Japanese PC games I thought ""all age version"" meant family friendly-ish, and therefore ended up purchasing this game. However, it seems to mean something closer to ""everything between heaven and earth except adult-only content"". Some scenes, themes, and visuals can appear to be disturbing to players who're not already deep into the anime fandom swamp.

(주인공 목소리를 100으로 하고 다른 인물들 목소리를 80으로 설정해두는 것으로 주인공 목소리만 키울 수 있음.)

- 이벤트: 플레이어의 대리만족과 게임 속 세계에의 몰입감을 위해 넣은 듯한 큰 의미는 없는 귀엽고 소소한 다이얼로그가 대부분이나 의외로 약간의 반전이 있는 이벤트(및 퀘스트 & 엔딩)가 있음. 코믹해야할 상황이 많으나 대부분 클리셰라 막 엄청 재미있진 않았고 플레이하면서 좀 웃겼던 장면이 두어 개는 존재함. 이벤트 종류가 많고 랜덤 발생과 특정 컨디션에 따른 발생이 섞여 있어 굉장히 여러 차례 다방면에서 다양한 시도를 하며 플레이해야 모두 모을 수 있을 듯. 엔딩을 스무개 전부 보고 120시간 이상 플레이했는데도 아직도 CG도 주요 이벤트도 일반 이벤트도 100%를 채우지 못함 ㄷㄷ 덧붙여 카야 엔딩을 봤음에도 특정 장면의 CG가 7/9이고 올리비아 엔딩을 봤음에도 특정 장면의 CG가 1/2인데 마저 채울 수 있는 팁 아시는 분 공유 부탁 드립니다.

- 캐릭터: 100% 취향인 캐릭터는 없었으나 양쪽 캐릭터들에 취향인 요소들이 조금씩은 들어있게끔 두 소녀들의 밸런스가 좋음. 귀여운 생물들이 꽤 많이 나오는데 제일 취저는 브라우니 ♡.♡ 주인공의 경우, 소위 남성향 게임도 (비록 얼굴은 안나오더라도) 가끔 프로타고니스트가 외모 혹은 성격이 무척 매력적으로 묘사되는 경우도 있는데 이 게임의 경우 대마법사의 이름에 걸맞는 마법의 힘을 보여주기보단 무력하게 소녀들의 도움을 받는 모습을 더 많이 보여주는 주인공이라 끌리지는 않았으나, 일본 남성향 게임답게 성격이 무난하고 상냥하며 어째서인지 주위의 모든 여자들이 (본인들은 인정하지 않더라도) 몰래 좋아하고 있다는 설정이라 남성 플레이어들이 감정이입하기에는 쉬울 듯.

- 음악 및 음향: 음향 효과는 다채롭고 좋았으나 음악은 트랙수가 적지 않음에도 몇 개의 트랙만을 대부분의 플레이 시간 동안 듣게 되는 경향이 있음. 조금만 더 종류가 다양했다면 하는 아쉬움.

- 번역: 일본어 보이스에 영어 텍스트로 플레이 했는데 굉장히 자연스럽게 의역도 잘 된 좋은 번역과 형편없는 오역이 공존해서 혹시 실력차가 큰 번역가들이 같이 번역했나 싶은 의혹마저 듬. 일단 굉장히 깔끔하게 가장 상황에 맞는 어휘로 원의미를 정확하게 전달한 부분들도 확실히 있음. 그러나 대체 번역을 어떻게 진행하면 이런 결과가 나오는지 혼란스러운 부분들과, 번역이 산으로 가서 결과론적으로는 비슷한 상황을 표현하긴 했으나 대사 하나하나를 뜯어보면 전혀 다른 대사가 되어 있는 부분들이 있음. 정말이지 게임 전체를 통틀어 셀 수 없이 많은데 몇 개만 예를 들자면,

1) 모리스모가 부탁한 퀘스트에서는 今だ를 まだ로 잘못 이해했는지 now가 아닌 not yet으로 표현함.

2) 늑대 박멸 이벤트에서는 ""그걸 알아보는 게 우리 일이지 않겠어."" 라는 대사가 ""그걸 알아보는 건 우리 일이 아니야.""로 반대로 번역되어 있고 ""불침번을 섰는데도 닭이 습격받아 버리기도 했고.""라는 대사는 ""우리가 공격받았는지 보기 위해 제가 닭과 함께 돌아보긴 했어요.""로 오역되어 버림.

3) 로슈타리 엔딩의 경우 일어로는 아리아는 시간여행자가 되었다고 나오는데 영문은 그냥 여행자가 되었다고 나옴. 심지어 어느 시대에 있건 아리아는 변하지 않을 거라는 대사가 몇 살이 되건 아리아는 변하지 않을 거라는 대사로 오역되어 있음.

4) 반클리프 가를 잇는 엔딩에서는 ""아바마마, 결혼 상대는 제가 스스로 정할 거라고 말했죠?""가 ""아빠, 누구랑 결혼할지 제가 정할 수 있다고 말씀하시지 않았나요?""로 번역되어 아리아의 성격이나 아빠와의 관계가 상당히 달라져버림.

- 개선점:

1) 레슨시에 주사위 던지기 1회차부터 6회차까지 쓸 마법을 미리 입력해놓고 매번 똑같이 버튼 하나로 실행할 수 있는 기능이 있었다면 진행이 훨씬 편했을 듯.

2) 굳이 심리적 공포를 자극할 내용이 아님에도 화면이 주홍빛으로 물드는 연출이 두어번 나오는데 좀 무서웠음. 불필요한 듯.

3) 각 퀘스트 아이콘 옆에 앞으로 남은 기간을 숫자로 표기해주었으면.

4) 스팀 도전과제는 웬만하면 지원해줬으면 좋겠음.

- 종합적인 감상: 라틴어 공부에 좋음. 플레이하다보면 장르가 전략 시뮬레이션이 맞다는 걸 깨달음. 이 가격에 이 정도 볼륨을 플레이할 수 있다니 가성비 갑. 외면적으로 굉장히 어려보이는 소녀들을 성적 대상화하는 부분이 있다는 점이 찝찝하긴 하나 예쁜 폰트와 간편한 인터페이스, 넘사벽 퀄리티의 작화와 어느 정도 중독성있는 게임성으로 인해 9/10.

- 그 외 플레이어들을 위한 약간의 팁:

1) 여러 차례 플레이하다보면 가장 많은 스피릿을 발생시킬 수 있는 방법에 대해 나름 노하우가 생기긴 하나 가장 보편적인 최고의 방법을 위해서는 나무위키의 관련 페이지를 읽어보길 추천.

2) 시간 여행자와 로슈타리의 혈통(관련 인물: 마리엘라), 작은 마법병(올리비아)과 궁중마법사(피오나&티에&콘스탄티네), 얽매이지 않는 영혼(메렛)과 그리모어의 학자(페르디난드&키에로), 귀족의 의무(엘모어&에두아르트)와 성녀의 기적(올가) 엔딩이 각각 서로 한 쌍이 되는 내용임.

3) 1회차 플레이에서 혹은 2회차 이후의 플레이라면 마법을 계승하지 않은 상태에서 11턴까지 아무것도 마법을 가르치지 않고 레슨만 하면 발생하는 아리아 이벤트가 있음. (アリアの不調２)

4) 그 외 구체적인 조건은 모르겠으나 의식실에서 레슨을 할 때 발생하는 카야 이벤트 2개 (カヤ、絶好調 儀式室 & カヤは勉強が楽しい 儀式室), 연구실에서 레슨을 할 때 발생하는 카야 이벤트 2개 (カヤの集中力不足 研究室 & カヤの失敗気味 研究室), 교실에서 레슨을 할 때 발생하는 이벤트 1개 (授業への取り組み 教室)가 존재함. (출처: http://galle.oe-p.com/review_02_70_12.html)

5) 메렛을 공략하기 위해서는 관련 퀘스트를 달성하는 것 이외에도 교실에서 3번 이상 메렛의 수업을 들어야만 나오는 퀘스트를 한 후 (스팀 가이드에서 4번이라는 영어 코멘트를 보았으나 3번으로도 퀘스트가 나옴을 확인 함. 또한 교실에서 메렛의 수업을 들을 때 나오는 이벤트는 정확히 몇 개인진 잊었으나 대여섯개 이상임) 2년째 시험을 불합격해야함.

6) 아리아나 카야의 스타 퀘스트가 나온 상태라면 피오나 공주와 관련된 퀘스트를 전부 끝내더라도 피오나 공주의 스타 퀘스트는 나오지 않음.

7) 아이템은 총 23개로 구하기 힘든 아이템으로는 요정왕의 지팡이와 부서진 안경이 있음. 부서진 안경은 메렛 공략 성공 시에 획득할 수 있고 요정왕의 지팡이 이벤트는 2년차의 8~10월 사이에 10%의 확률로 발생한다고 함(출처: http://hayashinoel.blog119.fc2.com/blog-entry-23.html). 실제로 그 시기에 발생함을 확인.

8) 엔딩 점수는 Novice → Adept → Apprentice → Diviner → Wizard (20~30만) 순으로 나오는 듯. 혹시 Archmage에 도달하신 분이 계시다면 몇 점대에 가능했는지 알려주신다면 감사하겠습니다.

9) 그 외 주요 이벤트도 마법을 익히지 않아 시험에 실패한 경우, 마법을 쓰지 않아 시험에 실패한 경우를 1년차, 2년차, 3년차 총 5가지로 나누어 만들어놓는 등 다양한 경우의 수에 따라 이벤트를 만들어놓은 이 게임의 스타일에 비추어볼 때 한 명이 배울 수 있는 마법을 전부 익혔을 때 나오는 반응 이벤트도 두 명 각각 있지 않을까 추측해 봄.",1624945580,1631938187,True,5,0,0.59706956148147583,0,True,False,False,False,,,

•	Constant sexualisation of children. 
•	Some interesting story, but mostly boring filler.
•	Frustrating gameplay that has some potential.

Detailed version:
So I wanted to like this game. I love ‘princess maker’ style games. I was fine with this being the ‘censored’ version because I’m Ace, (I don’t mind sexual content, but its not why I buy a game). The gameplay style worked well for me, though it was somewhat confusing. I like stat raising, I liked how learning spells are used for both quests and improving your lessons. I like that when you finish the game, you ‘inherit’ spells so you can still use them in lessons (though you still have to ‘learn’ those spells again, it’s a lot faster). 

There are some interesting stories and characters, but… well you have to slog through so much to get there. Every new spell gives you a long, usually pretty boring scene where the girl learns that new spell. Sometimes those scenes are cute or add background info, but mostly it’s ‘I’m going to try a new spell, I don’t think I can do it, oh I did it! Yay!’ or ‘I can totally do this complicated spell! Wait, why is my teacher on fire again?’ Much the same happens on quests. 

I didn’t mind that more and more characters kept moving into the tower for increasingly contrived and ridiculous reasons. I shrugged when every female character seemed to have the hots for the protagonist. I just wanted the cute story and stat raising. I was excited to get the girls through their exams and help them achieve some cool endings. I was rather disappointed honestly, even following a guide didn’t really help getting all the spells I needed in time to do the relevant quest, so I only got one rather dull epilogue. But hey, that’s what replays are for right? But apparently you’ll need to do a lot of save scumming and replays to see all the endings. Par for the course… 

And then came the adult content. Yes I’m playing the ‘censored’ version of the game, but it still has clothed suggestive content and dialogue. At first I just kinda shrugged. I’m not here for that, but I can enjoy some romance in my games. And then there was the first ‘teacher walks into his student’s room without waiting for them to say he can, and big surprise they’re in a state of undress! Teacher is mortified and blusters about this at length to give the player time to ogle the girl.’ Scene. And they kept coming. 

The students look and act like pre-teens. They’re supposedly 15-18 (aging over the 3 years of the game), so it’s ‘fine’ that the protagonist can date one at the end if he wants. But they’re just… there’s no way they’re adults. And even if they are, he’s a lot older than them and in a position of power over them. (I know some people enjoy the ‘professor/student’ dynamic in things, but this was done in such an overtly creepy way). They are constantly referred to as ‘little girls’, they wear little girl outfits, they have the maturity and life experience of little girls. They look 10-11 years old. And all that might be tolerable if all the romance and sexualising happened at the very end after they’ve graduated. But it doesn’t. There’s a constant stream of ‘sexy’ panty shots and half clothed shots and ‘awkward’ situations. A grown woman gropes a little girl and suggests they go to bed. This is played for laughs. 

And it didn’t have to be. The relationship between the protagonist and the girls is set up as mentor/father figure. When it’s not being needlessly sexualised, it’s cute and adorable and heart-warmingly wholesome. And it gets ruined two slides later with a gratuitous panty shot… The adult stuff could have been kept to just the adult women, but it isn’t. 

Most of the adult characters look like adults, with the exception of the ‘angel’ character. Who’s supposedly thousands of years old, but is dropped into the story looking, you guessed it, like a pre-pubescent little girl, and wearing a very revealing bikini (and nothing else). She calls the protagonist ‘master’. She’s also horrifyingly naïve. It’s not sexy, it’s creepy. 

Many of the other adult female characters, while looking like adult women, behave in childish or naïve ways that make you feel dirty for any sexual interaction you’re forced through with them. 

I’ve played the game through once, I tried for a replay, but the gross sexualisation of little girls just got more and more common (as I was able to do more quests and unlock more scenes with characters.) I played as long as I did because while it was frustrating, once I got some practice with the gameplay I liked it. But I just can’t play anymore. I feel dirty just OWNING this game. And the problematic stuff happens far enough into the game that you will almost certainly have exceeded the amount of time you can play before Steam no longer offers a refund.

[h1] Story [/h1] Wir spielen einen Jungen Erzmagier namens ""Domino"" und sind von der Magierakademie weggegangen und haben Unterwegs einen Alten Turm genant ""The Dark Tower"" gefunden und haben es uns in diesem Turm nun gemütlich gemacht. Wir bekommen von der Akademie aber die Aufgabe, 2 Junge Mädchen genant ""Kaya & Aria"" innerhalb von 3 Jahren zu Zauberinnen auszubilden. Leichter gesagt als getan denn es ziehen fast Wöchentlich Neue Bewohner in unserem Turm ein (natürlich alle Weiblich)

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Das Gameplay ist etwas kompliziert zu Erklären. Man liest sich überwiegend durch die Story. Das Spiel ist in 3 Jahren aufgeteilt. Pro Woche sehen wir immer ein Event. In jeder Woche können wir unsere beiden Schülerinnen, Zauber beibringen. Dies kann man aber nur indem man sogenannte  ""Spirits"" sammelt. Dafür muss man ein Würfel Spiel spielen, dabei haben die Würfel 5 verschiedene Spirits, die man erwürfeln kann/muss. Mit diesen ""Spirtis"" bringen wir dann den beiden verschiedene Zauber bei, damit sie dann auf Quests gehen können um mehr Erfahrung mit dieser Magie oder um Items oder Diplome zu bekommen (Man braucht immer bestimmte Zauber für bestimmte Quests). Jeder gelernte Zauber, jede Quest und auch ""fast"" jede Woche zeigt verschiedene Events, die oftmals richtig Humorvoll sind wie z.B. ein Misslungener Zauber unserer Schülerin, trifft unseren Helden. Die Musik & der Art Style sind absolut Fantastisch. Es gibt natürlich die ein oder andere gewagte Szene, wie man es aus typischen Animes her kennt

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Gute Story
+ Sehr Gute Musik
+ Sehr Guter Art Style
+ Sympathischer Haupt Charakter
+ Sympathische Neben Charaktere
+ Gutes Voice Acting
+ Sehr Humorvoll
+ Viel zum Freischalten (über 200 CGs & Musikstücke)
+ 3 Extra Mini Storys nach beenden der Haupt Geschichte
+ Viele Endings
+ Sammelkarten

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein richtig Gutes Visual Novel mit interessantem Gameplay, einer Guten Story, Guter Musik, einem Netten Art Style & vielen Humorvollen Szenen. Sehr zu Empfehlen für Fans von Fantasy Visual Novels

O jogo é maravilhoso, mas você deve saber que tipo de jogo esse é antes de comprar. Esse é um raising game, você é um professor de magia e tem três anos para ensinar para duas alunas meninas. As aulas são um minigame de dados (que é divertido) onde você ganha pontos que gasta para aprender magia. Você também deve fazer quests (que na verdade são eventos) para liberar as rotas dos personagens e aumentar o cap de pontos, cada quest requer uma série de magias. A história do jogo é boa, um pouco simples, mas muito divertida e boa de ler. Mas o ponto principal do jogo é a sua belíssima arte, você dificilmente vai encontrar um jogo mais bonito que esse. A ost é bem relaxante, todos os personages são dublados, os diálogos são como caixas de diálogo de quadrinhos e o jogo possui mais de 300 CGs, o que aumenta bastante o fator replay. Ele ainda vem com algumas histórias extras divertidas. Um aviso, a arte é muito bonita, mas é um pouco ""ousada"", evite esse jogo se isso te incomodar.

The game is wonderful, but you should know what kind of game that is before you buy. This is a raising game, you are a magic teacher and you have three years to teach for two female students. Classes are a minigame of dice (which is fun) where you earn points you spend to learn magic. You should also do quests (which are actually events) to release the characters' routes and increase the point cap, each quest requires a series of spells. The story of the game is good, a bit simple, but very fun and good to read. But the main point of the game is its beautiful art, you will hardly find a game more beautiful than this. The ost is very relaxing, all the characters are dubbed, the dialogs are like dialog boxes of comics and the game has more than 300 CGs, which greatly increases the replay factor. It even comes with some fun extra stories. A warning, the art is very beautiful, but it's a bit ""bold"", avoid this game if it bothers you.

The overall gameplay loop is simple you roll dices to gain spirit, you use said spirit to teach spells to the two girls then go to quest which have a required spell and gives you some increase in the spirit cap (since spirit has a cap). There are 5 types of spirit and usually quest increases the cap by one or two. The quest themselves are escencially a small tale on how the girl used certain spell. Quest also serve to determine the ending. There is also each in game year a exam that requires an specific spell to be learned or reach certain amount of spirit, this is random so it will change in every playthrough. Most endings either require you to get specific certifications or complete certain character specific quest and most have a time limit so you won't be able to do them if time passes. If you fail to meet the exam requirements, you also get an ending. The game has a new game plus more to keep the spells teached to the girls, but the spells are only usable for gathering spirit and must be learned again to be used in quests. Gameplay aside characters are simple but properly fleshed out, usually having a backdrop that justifies their behavior with the exception of the protagonist who is really a proxy for the player to self-insert.

It's a game about teaching magic to two girl pupils. Quite a bit of ecchi, there are some pantyshots. It has explicit scenes in the original, but not here.

The game consists of giving lessons to the girls, throwing dice and manipulating the rolls for better results. From there you build your stats and spend them on new spells. Then quests require certain spells and give rewards.

There are like 20 endings. The better are the pupils' ones. The point is passing 3 exams, one a year. Exams can be a bit difficult since you have to cast certain spells and have to control both girls' rolls. Otherwise the game is easy peasy.

The game is cute and fun but it's by no means an essential game.",1526233468,1548878611,True,4,0,0.552719950675964355,0,True,True,False,False,,,

The game's freehand drawing art style is complemented by a speech bubble text box version of visual novel dialogue, which makes it feel like reading a full-color manga.  

You're the archmage Domino in charge of training Aria and Kaya, the two ""worst"" apprentices in Hogwa- I mean ""Grimoire"" Magical Academy, and are banished to an abandoned Dark Tower to do it because you mouthed off to your superiors.  Aria is a brash, reckless duke's daughter who exemplifies all the stereotypes of The Wizard's Apprentice of trying to steal magic books and cast spells she's not strong enough to control and whose spells routinely backfire upon her.  For reasons that aren't explained, Kaya, an orphaned outcast from a magical tribe, is lumped in with her in spite of being shy to the point of meek, obedient, diligent, talented, and earnestly seeking her teacher/foster parent's approval in all things. That is to say, she's an ideal student, and nobody ever explains why she'd be called a ""worst"" one, and she essentially only gets in trouble because Aria dragged her into it or Domino's being ludicrously lax in his oversight of the application of combat magic again.  (In fact, Aria and Kaya seem to do everything in the game on their own, to the point that it's a constant question to ask ""What is Domino DOING with all his time he's not teaching?!""  He certainly doesn't seem to have any other projects that would excuse his absence...)

The game takes place over three years in-game, with the player getting to manage the time once per week. (With 52 weeks in a year, so 156 turns in a game.)  ""Lessons"" are the main gameplay mode, where you try to generate ""spirit"" the girls need to learn spells through a dice-based minigame.  ""Learning"" spends spirit to learn a spell, which also takes a whole week, but comes along with its own vignette with the girl learning or what they do immediately after learning a spell - I.E. after learning the ice-making glacies spell, Aria uses it to make ice-based treats until she gets a stomachache.  ""Quests"" are requests from one of the adult side characters that are just visual novel dialogues that are automatically successful if you have the required spells already learned. The only ""challenge"" in them is a time limit to complete them, meaning that you have to manage your time well to keep gaining enough spirit to learn spells before you actually need them.  

The Learning minigame may be dice-based, but it's hardly just luck.  You can ""bump"" dice once they've landed to force the die to land on the face you click.  Since you can only see 3 of the 6 faces of the die at a time, this may require repeated ""bumping"" to flip a die completely over, and you have a limited number of ""bumps"" per session, but generally, it's not THAT difficult to get everything you want.  Contrary to what you might expect, the luck tends to come in after the dice, with the spells themselves.  Some have effects of making an object blow through the field and generating spirit whenever they touch a die, but where they appear is random and can totally miss the dice, while others make objects appear that give you more spirit or even more dice if dice bump into them... but require dice to actually bump into them.  Spells like Auctus Herba are really useful in that it makes extra dice, but when Aria takes all of Kaya's dice, you're forced to reset to get another shot.

There are 5 different types of Spirit you need, from gloves (representing ""hands-on experience"" apparently), to crowns (representing ""wisdom""), to gems (representing ""intuition"") that come on the die faces.  There is also a moon-shaped face that is a sort of wild card that generates several points of random spirit types, but which doesn't appear on many dice.  The girls have dice that only have four kinds of spirit, and switching tutor and classroom change the faces of the dice.  (I.E. the Library has half its die covered with books.)  

It would be a simple matter of just getting as many moons as possible were it not for the fact that spells have an effect on the dice game.  If you get certain combinations, the spells trigger and give you bonuses.  One of your first spells gives +5 spirit for whatever you roll on a die... and you start with just 1 spirit for whatever you roll, so that's a pretty immediate and insane jump in power. As soon as you have any spells at all, the game becomes about planning out the proper order of spellcasting you need to obtain the spirit you need for your next batch of spells to learn and repeatedly bumping until you get all the spells you want, and the notion that this is ""luck"" just because it involves dice goes flying out the window.  

The visual novel parts are general comedic anime fare, essentially somewhere between ""slice of life"" in a medieval-ish fantasy setting with worldbuilding, and a goofy ""another world"" setting.  In spite of being what we are assured are nobody terribly important (nevermind the fact that the main character is established as one of only a handful of archmages in the world teaching a duke's daughter) living in a forgotten ruin, you quickly have a roll call of fantasy bigwigs knocking on your gates, from the princess of the country with her catgirl slav- maid, an I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Catholicism church-sanction saint and her paladin bodyguard, an angel in an outfit that would make a succubus blush, the foremost genius architect/engineer of the realm, a mighty witch who's also Aria's ancest- I mean ""youthful big sister"", 
an elven ranger adventuring buddy of Domino's, a champion gladiatrix/assassin, the queen of fairies, and an ancient ghost guardian of the ruins.  All of them but the ghost just so happen to be beautiful women with an interest in the main character.  Other male characters exist, but are much more marginal in the story, even Domino's supposed best friend fellow wizard.  So, yeah, it's anime, but it's one of THOSE anime.

As several other reviewers harp upon, this is a ""censored"" version of a previously ""mature"" game, which was something I didn't realize upon first seeing this game.  (I mean, it didn't really LOOK like the sort of game that would be ""mature""...)  Looking into it, this involves adding swimsuits when characters go bathing, and removing sex scenes outright.  Fortunately, there are plenty of adult characters besides the child apprentices that seem to be the focus of the sexual content, but even this version of the game has most of its hints at sexuality being flashed underwear of Aria and Kaya, as well as Sepha (an angel no less) wearing something on the skimpy side of being a bikini.  

What really gets me is how unnecessary it all is.  If they'd never put in the sexualization to begin with, without too many other modifications, they could easily have made what is basically an anime plot that could have appealed to either gender/sexual preference on the basis of the cuteness, alone, and there wouldn't be large number of people who can't get into the game thanks to being unwilling or unable to put off the sense that you're meant to be sexualizing the child characters.  (And yes, Aria and Kaya are definitely children.  When Princess Fianna first arrives she makes a comment assuming that they are the main character's daughters, not apprentices, although Domino himself is supposedly young and around his late twenties, himself.)

The game's vignettes are highly random, as well, which can lead to sharp breaks in tone.  I can teach Aria a spell in a week, have the VN part where Aria's spell backfires on her again in a comedic vignette, then fade to black and all of a sudden, the catgirl's in heat.

In total, if you enjoy manga or anime featuring cute girls doing cute things, you'll probably enjoy this if you can get past the fact (or relish it, I suppose) that there's a sexual undercurrent.",1524853908,1525112932,True,3,0,0.503934681415557861,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Also I don't care for the art style, but thats a personal gripe. Way too cutesy loli-esque for my tastes, and the angel looks like a freaking hot dog. The proportions are just bizzare, and most of the characters could do with an extra meal I think.

I was waiting quite a while before writing review for this one. It will be rather short, as I'm honestly still disturbed by this game. I like to play full version of games, instead of censored ones, so whenever there is visual novel with cut-out 18+ content, I try to restore it. Usually it's a good decision. It certainly wasn't in this case, although I wonder if ""censored"" version is really that much different in terms on panty-shots, innuendos, the way characters speak to you and treat you. If not, it's not really helping this game. ""Littlewith Romanesque"" manages to make sex scenes with older looking characters awkward and almost uncomfortable. And there are plenty ""not-old-looking"" characters too, like cat lady, your two young students or angel. I could go with ""just an art style"", if there weren't any normal looking women AND if the young-looking characters wouldn't act in a childish manner. They do. Add to that, that it's get pretty clear, at some point, that you will end up with one (or maybe even two) of yours students in sexual situation and it gets even more gross, since I had really hard time perceiving them as anything more than children and I wanted to see their bond with main character as father-daughters and not something so disturbing. I think pretty much every female character presented in the game, wants to sleep with protagonist at some point, which is ridiculous on its own. 

So that was part about disturbing stuff. How is actual gameplay and is it worth your time? I'll be honest with you - as someone who loves titles like ""Long Live The Queen"", I was very interested in concept of ""raising"" witches, teaching them skills and spells, observing how this  affect the plot and so on. And it's fun. For like 5 hours max. After that you have enough of rolling the dices and teaching them new abilities, especially after you discover, that almost every set of quests, ultimately leads to, wait for it, sex scene! Seriously, at some point it become quite obvious, that raising students isn't my main goal in this game.

Romanesque is a very fun casual raising-sim. It can require some level of strategy if you want to get all of the endings or unlock all of Kaya/Arya's spells in a single run, but nothing too excessive. It is highly suitable for casual play.

The art and sound are both very good and pleasant to look at. The dice game which Romanesque is centered around does get a bit repetitive at times, but it's not too bad. There are also a couple hundred different 5-minute scenes that show up between the game, when spells are learned and so on, so the game rarely gets boring.

Review right... it really is a nice chilling game and learning new spells gives a lot of satisfaction. Just give it some time. Although I was annoyed at first trying to focus on spells and dices to advance plot. I was failing magic lessons but I got used to this fantasy life cut into weekly pieces. It is chaotic game because of numerous characters. You know though in general during a game month no real changes are made but new people are introduced all time. We dont have any impact on story except doing quest in Dark Tower. You will uncover small things about game universe with students Arya and Kaya and you will witness some cheerful flirts as Archmage Domino. Usually though scenes are short and thats a bit of unfortunate to get over with. Also kinda silly thing that only one of the two students can learn one spell at a time - that means the other sits and do then nothing.

Thats it. No hard emotional breakdowns. No crazyness. Nothing outstanding really nor negative. Just slowly but nicely made bounds between characters with incredibly well done voice acting - oldschool. If you want to read something lightly adventured and fun.

Be warned that by purchasing this on Steam you will not be getting the adult content that is present in this game.  You will want to buy this game from jastusa (be sure to switch to the 18+ version of the site) if you want to see that content.

The actual game consists of 150+ weeks (turns) where you may attempt a lesson (which is where the actual dice-rolling gameplay occurs), learn a spell, or go on a quest.  Each week also includes a story scene at the beginning and end of the week.  Each learned spell and quest completed also yields a story scene, so if you do either of those things (and you usually will), you will have 3 story sequences in a week.  Going through these turns and trying to learn spells needed for quests is quite addictive, and even though this game could be considered a visual novel, I sometimes wanted to just skip all the story sections to get back to my objectives.  That, for me was the most frustrating aspect of this game; it sometimes feels like it takes forever to accomplish something because of all the exposition I had to get through in order to do so!  It seems like this may have been even more the case in the adult version where even more scenes can come up.

What mainly sold me on this game is the art and gameplay.  The art is fantastic and maintains excellent quality the whole way through.  Even the ordinary character portraits never get old and everything, including backgrounds was done with utmost care.  The music is also nice and the ending theme especially is excellent.  

It is impossible to do everything in this game in a single playthrough.  It took me a little over 10 hours to get through my first playthrough, and on subsequent playthroughs, you can use previously learned spells during the dice rolling lessons, which really increases your potential to learn magic.  Because many scenes will have already been read, and can be skipped, new playthroughs have a really good pace and it's fun to try to do events (quests and spells) you chose not to focus on originally.  Overall this game is very addictive and excellent value.

One thing to note is that even though explicit content was removed for this version of the game, there are still panty shots and other segments that sexualize the students, who look and act like early junior high students.

You will love it, if you are looking for something calming and slow-paced. Music is repetitive and not remarkable; dices are random and irritate me.

You can call this game “little witch training simulator with gameplay”: you are an archmage living together with two students in a tower, each week you decide what your two students will do: study with dices, learn a new magic spell or go for a quest. Sometimes new faces appear and make your tower their home. Every year exams happen and make your life harder. So, it's just a calming slice-of-life experience of a mage and his students living by the countryside.

Gameplay: it's your regular visual novel with some dice-based gameplay elements. Visual novel routes are implemented via quests: to see the ending for specific character you must complete all of character’s quests. Every quest has it's own deadline and requirements (often a list of spells which your students must learn), so try to plan ahead while playing or resort to using a guide. Some complex endings require both successful completion and failures for certain quests, and will get specific diplomas for your students. It’s a very long novel/training simulator full of interesting, funny, and scary events

R-rated content: Along with an All Ages Steam version, I played a standalone 18+ version. Most scenes featuring ""close contacts"" feel totally out of place and unnecessary. It's just like ""Ok, we need to place some porn in this game, - Where? - Right here! - Why? - Because fuck her, that's why.""

Characters: You are not a pedophile. Which is lovely.

These girls who were not up to academy standards and are believed to be somewhat incabable of learning. Although being considered as archemage in this story 'Domino' you soon relise that you could learn a thing or two while trying to teach your two ahm minions magic.

- Great Characterisation

- Amazing Sountrack
- Old school Magic in a VN

- If VN's with strategy arn't your thing

 Si vous avez une sainte horreur du ""loli"" passez votre chemin les personnages principaux sont des enfants.

L'histoire extrêmement intéressant Kaya et Aya sont bien ficelées ,vivantes et crédibles.

Et leur faire passer des optios qui les guideront vers leur avenirs permetant de débloquer l'une des différentes fins qui ne vous laisserons pas de marbre.

Tous les personnages sont intégralements doublés et sont de très bonne qualité. Pour finir le jeu à 100 % accrochez vous pour espérer débloquer toutes les fins, il faut presque faire le jeu autant de fois qu'il y a de fin. Le jeu est en anglais et demande un minimum de connaissance, mais il reste accessible.

Girlish Grimoire Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Regia

Girlish Grimoire Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Perfecta

In Littlewitch geht es darum die zwei Shojos [u]Aria Vancleef[/u] und [u]Kaya Xavier[/u] (Hat nix mit den Sänger Xavier Nadoo zu tun^^) zu Magiern auszubilden und ja das ist es eigentlich schon.

Man muss ihnen diverse Zauber beibringen das schon am Anfang sehr schwer sein kann im allgemeinen das Game ist nicht so einfach zumindest am Anfang nimmt es nicht so tragisch falls ihr mal die ein oder ander Quest nicht schafft man kann eine neue Runde Starten und die berreits erlernten Zauber nutzen aber erst nachdem man eine Beendet hat.

Nebenbei macht man noch Insgesamt 79 Quests (Perfecta Verso, Regia Verso wohl beide gleich)
Bei diesen Quests kann man Items, Diplome und Zuneigung der 7 Routen Chars freischalten.

Zuneigungs Quests sind wichtig für das Ending des jeweilligen Chars,
Folgende Chars haben Routen [u]Aria, Kaya, Fianna, Olga, Olivia, Mariela und Merret[/u]
Gesamt gibt es 12 Shojos (Perfecta Gesamt 26 Szenen, Regia Nope)

Am meisten gefiel mir aber das Artwork das hat n bisschen was von Gemälden

이미 과거에 이 게임을 해보신 분이라면 이 게임을 살 이유가 전혀 없습니다. 본 게임은 전연령판 PS2버전을 PC판으로 포팅하여 판매중인 게임(유통사 입장)이지만 아무리 봐도 2008년 ep pc버전이 베이스여서 게임 패드를 지원하지 않고 있으며 다회차 게임인데도 도전과제가 없고 오버레이까지 지원하지 않고 있습니다. 거기다가 R-18버전은 웹사이트에서 따로 판매중인데 40달러입니다. 다행히 거기서 구매해도 스팀키를 요청하면 주지만 이 게임은 누키게가 아닙니다. 전혀 야하지 않아요. 야하지도 않은 H씬과 고쳐진 일러스트 몇장을 위해 15달러를 더 내는 것보다 중고 패키지(현재 매물가 600엔~1000엔)를 사는 게 더 났습니다. 결정적으로 성의가 없습니다.기존에 플레이했던 유저도 이걸 구매하게 만드는 요소가 있었거나 스팀에서 판매하므로서 스팀유저를 위한 요소가 있었다면 추천했을 작품입니다.

Do you like a visual novel that has gameplay elements? Do you like that gameplay to be technical and complicated, yet managable and still enjoyable? You've found the right one. 

Take a story that revolves around magical learning and slice-of-life fantasy, then blend it with some time-management and an intriguing dice-rolling mechanic, and you get Littlewitch Romanesque. And is it ever astoundingly good! Nearly every scene between lessons contains lore, and there is enough depth to the worldbuilding within the story to give you a lot for your imagination to explore. 

The plot, despite being an eroge (with adult scenes removed on Steam), is actually surprisingly not that perverted. If gratuitous sex is a turn-off in other visual novels, you'll be delighted by how focused the plot is on revealing its world and developing its huge amount of characters. Sure, there's some fan-service (as one will always expect due to the genre), but it's almost always either comedic or sentimental, and rarely feels out of place. 

And don't even get me started on the artwork. HOLY CRAP, is this some absolutely stunning art. You can see the love and detail in every single scene.

到今天這版本的「Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Regia」
只能說：類養成+大槍葦人-這位蘿莉控的的組合依然強大，
像我這種不是專業的蘿莉控都能感受這位繪師對蘿莉的執念。

首先，這個「Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Regia」並不是甚麼新企劃，
而是早在2008年6月就已經發表的「少女魔法学リトルウィッチロマネスク: Editio Perfecta」的「和諧版」，
「Editio Regia」，就如大家熟知的「和諧」這詞，移除了H的要素，
當然這絲毫不影響遊戲的本質！...這種事也許是不可能，因為至少會短缺數十個以上的事件；
但是，每個角色並不會因此而喪失其魅力與特色，往好處而論，
這樣更能守護每個角色的純真與本質？(好吧，我不掰下去了)

而，遊戲內容比Prinecss Maker系列簡單，只有156個回合，並不用思考太過複雜的分配，
但也只是沒有必要而不是不必要，因為以遊戲一輪而言是無法做完所有的任務的；
合理的分配學習時間與任務時間，收集影響結局的Diploma，不必將遊戲回合用完也可以進入結局，
除了第一輪最花時間，第二輪以後可以繼承魔法，能略過已觸發過的劇情，遊戲就相當輕鬆了。

就以個人好惡而言，這遊戲的優點是時間，缺點也是時間，
第一輪不快轉不取消對話語音，結局粗估要5~6小時，這對急性子的玩家(我)算折騰，即使系統隨時可以中斷並記錄；
到了第二輪後可以略過觸發過的劇情，但是要結束156個回合也還是要花上兩小時以上，
甚至額外的EXTRA故事書模式，每一個劇本對話量也都是以小時作單位，用auto模式完全可以當作廣播故事節目，
這對於想要有蘿莉的聲音長時間陪伴著自己的玩家或許是優點，以一個遊戲而言，這裡的可遊戲時間完全不是問題。

結論，如果對Prinecss Maker(大槍葦人的系列)有好感，這遊戲也不會有什麼不和諧，
從來沒有碰過GAL類型遊戲的，這也是個不錯的入坑手段，
如果真的非18+就不能硬，那恭喜，這遊戲還是有非官方的Uncensored反和諧手段。

Для тех кто с такими играми незнаком - это интерактивная 2D история, где вам предстоит взять на себя роль наставника 2-х юных колдуний. Скриншоты с заглавной страницы могут ввести в заблуждение или отпугнуть, т.к. там в основном только 3 персонажа присутствуют -  так что спешу вас заверить, в игре гораздо больше персонажей, нежели маэстро Домино и 2 его ученицы. И далеко не все они девушки(ну, почти...)).

Ладно, перейдем конкретно к достоинствам и недостаткам игры:
+Плюсы:
1)Учитывая малое кол-во игр в аналогичном сеттинге/жанре - уже за это можно ставить жирный +. Аналогами на PC можно считать разве что игры от hanako - LLTQ и Magic Diary.
2)Много персонажей, очень хорошо проработанных.
3)Цельный мир, со своей историей, политикой и т.п., противоречий или расхождений по этим вопросам я в процессе не заметил, все очень логично и завершенно выглядит.
4)Довольно обширная нелинейность. Помимо 20 заявленных концовок в процессе игры сцены могут возникать в разном порядке, а некоторые могут вообще не произойти/произойти при определенных обстоятельствах. Причем не вы выбираете, как это обычно бывает, через меню диалога(тут такого просто нет), а это определяется тем, где вы заниматесь со своими ученицами, чем, кто их наставник в конкретный день, а также в каком порядке делаете квесты(их появление тоже весьма нелинейно - некоторые могут и не появиться если не выполнены неявные условия).
5)Сюжет. Кавайность, доброта и няшность. Они тут везде! - и при этом игра рассказывает довольно серьезные истории о политических интригах, войнах и жизненных драмах. Но КАК это здесь делается....просто бесподобно. Без передергиваний и намеренного идиотизма, редкость для таких игры.
6)Длительность. 3 года обучения - это немалый срок...игра затянет вас не на день и не на два.

+-Спорные моменты:
1)Рисовка. На любителя. Некоторые персонажи хорошо нарисованы, другие неочень. Да и в целом стилистика...нестандартная. Но привыкнуть можно.
2) Это порт эроге с консоли. Соответственно - все 34-сцены вырезаны. Для меня это плюс - я не лоликонщик и играю в эту игру ради няшности, а не хентая, тем более с лолитами. Но для кого-то это будет минусом. Отсюда же вытекает и следующий спорный момент:
3)Многие диалоги намеренно ""затуплены"" с целью привести их к хентай-завершению. Это не то чтобы как-то сильно мешает, но учитывая предыдущий пункт, в PC-версии иногда выглядит странно и неуместно.
4)Музыка. Неплохая, но однообразная очень уж. Впрочем, это характерно для игра данного жанра.

-Минусы:
1)Непонятный процесс интерактивных занятий с ученицами. Они могут как сами выбирать какие заклинания использовать, либо можно их заставлять использовать что-либо конкретное. Но! Если выбираем мы, то все набранные очки зануляются. Странно...по сути можно было убрать возможность контроля и просто выдавать рандом результаты занятий, ничего бы не изменилось.
2)AI учениц на этих самых занятиях. Он просто отсутствует. Заклинания выбираются случайно. Например, Кайя может скастовать Сомнус или Иллекториум на первом ходу. Т.е. переместить таланты или украсть таланты у Арии - но смысл это делать когда этих талантов во всех пунктах по нолям? Т.е. AI отсутствует.
3)Можно было бы и побольше интерактива
4)Некоторые сцены черезчур затянуты
5)Заканчивая игру, получил только эндинг для Кайи, про Арию - только упоминание что ""она с Оливией"". ПОнятно что это увеличивает реиграбельность но все же....неочень, учитывая, что учил я их наравне обоих.

Итого - любителям таких игр брать обязательно, ньюфагам - эта игра вполне ОК чтобы начать знакомство с жанром, хотя как по мне LLTQ(Long Live The Queen) для этого подходит больше.",1434647911,1434808318,True,19,0,0.537112534046173096,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Girlish Grimoire Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Regia is a visual novel with a small interactive gameplay that makes it even more engaging.
You play as Domino, a very well known mage that was tasked to study an ancient tower and train two apprentices whom apparently thought to be problem students. Later on.there will be more people who gets involved in your used-to-be quite living in the tower. Most of them are beautiful ladies so it's quite a harem.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Aside from it's beautiful comic-style visual novel story telling, LR:ER involves rolling dices that affects the attributes for the apprentices. These attributes are needed to unlock spells, and spells are needed for quests and exams. Some quests also gives you some plus points with the ladies so go show them that magnetic attraction of yours Mr.Wizard..*cough*

I'm still hoping for achievements implemented in this game. After all, this visual novel already has gameplay and quests so why not? Even simple VNs in steam has achievements, it would be fun to have it for LR:ER.

[h1]Final words....[/h1]
This is the first Littlewitch game that  I've played. It was just sheer curiosity that I picked up a title that is aimed for males and I wasn't disappointed.
Primarily because there's always an event brewing and more characters being introduced. I'm still getting a hang on the dice rolling, I'm not lucky or skilled to turn the tables but I'm trying...to woo the ladies ^_~ *wink*

The artwork and music is beautiful, and I dig the lighthearted atmosphere and funny scenes. One of my gripes with the game is it's small resolution. You get an option to turn it into fullscreen but for people who are anal with graphic bluriness you might not like it. 

I cannot recommend this game to folks who are triggered  to fan service and gets offended to seeing an art of a skimpy translucent clothing of an angel character or pantsu from your apprentice or another lady. 

But to folks who can bypass that, then I really recommend this gem. I hope more Littlewitch games will come to steam!",1430215196,1430216056,True,7,0,0.604194819927215576,0,False,False,False,False,,,

They also happen to be considered Grimoire's worst students, making the 3 years limit a challenge. Domino, however, yearns to explore and push the boundaries of the arcane, and he's eager to train them well.

Littlewitch's story takes off well from the beginning thanks to the highly imaginative art put into it. Even the male characters, often neglected in visual novels, are drawn with care and skill, and the same elegant style extends even into the games menus and overlay. Ashito Oyari's style is immediately distinct and enjoyable during all parts of the game, where it fits the nature of the setting so perfectly it makes you wonder whether the art preceded and inspired the entire project.

Gameplay is reminiscent of Princess Maker in scope, but it plays much closer to a voiced visual novel with puzzle/stat oriented gameplay attached to give a sense of progress to Domino's goals of teaching and raising the heroines. Between quests and events, there's more than enough to fill several playthroughs in order to see everything within your 3 years in-game time limit. During which, each of the multiple endings are strongly built up, and when they come there's heavy payoff, as you'll want to sit quietly and soak in events unfolding. Thankfully there's a New Game+ mode which retains spells learned during lessons into the next playthrough.

This is one of those instances where an ambitious game pays off, where all of the talented components fit together, from the inspired art, sincere story, voicework, and even to the accurate and faithfully nuanced translation JAST has a reputation for, all complimenting each other into an experience above many of its peers in the visual novel space.

I've only played an hour as of right now but I have to say, I've already laughed, been emotionally moved and otherwise enjoyed the story. And that's an important note, this is a very story driven game, and it does not fall short at delivering. Another important note is that this is an adult game with the adult content removed. Despite that removal there remains a definite appeal to the lolicon, as there's a panty-shot very early and, I mean really, just look at the angel Sepha.

[b]!~  I very much hope that  JAST will see fit to make a patch available to those who wish to reintroduce the explicit content that was removed for distribution via steam ~![/b]

I actually bought this in an instant because I'm familiar with the artist's work, knew a bit about this game, didn't know it was available in English and quite foolishly assumed that there would already be the desired patch available as with when I purchased HuniePop (though that's an entirely unrelated game). Needless to say I should have read the description all the way through and now I'm a tiny bit disappointed (in myself mostly).

[h1]Regarding the actual gameplay[/h1], it's quite interesting in how the story is advanced. Rather than dialog trees there's a sort of dice minigame where you get different kinds of ""spirit"" depending on what is rolled, and rolls can be messed with by ""bumping"" the dice as they're rolled, so it's not all chance. The different spirit can be spent to unlock spells, which gives you a scene, the spells can be used when rolling the dice to further modify results as well as being a prerequisite for quests, which also advance the story. there's more to it but that's the general idea.

[h1]Back to the story[/h1], I can't believe how attached I am to these girls already. Aria's straight forward attitude and reckless behavior, Kaya's quiet anxiety and compassion; they both are very quickly established as people with life and personality that makes you want to see them succeed. Their envy of traits they see in the other girl, and their self doubt make them all the more human. The voice acting is good too. I can't help but look forward to getting to know the girls better and guiding them to happiness and success.",1428139215,1428139215,True,124,17,0.624615132808685303,1,True,False,False,False,,,
