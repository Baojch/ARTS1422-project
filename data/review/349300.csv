There is drama in the community about buying the steam version that is censored or buying the uncensored version elsewhere, and its absurd for the steam version to be censored. In my opinion, they're all a bunch of idiots with nothing to do, the difference is minimal, there's no need to have the eroge scenes, it's like in the manga Ghost in the Shell where the author removed the eroge pages and people cried blood, but didn't add anything to the plot.

Rolling dice and looking at guides to find out which spell to unlock is too boring, if you don't look you'll be missing for a lot of chunk of the game and that's what the community should be complaining about, the game design.",1704130028,1704130028,False,1,0,0.501754403114318848,0,True,False,False,True,,,

For those who don't: This is a hentai game featuring little girls. Even the steam version is extremely ecchi and full of fanservice which some people might find offensive.

That said, Little Witch Romanesque is a pretty good visual novel. The story is well-told if a little overly long at times. There are many genuinely likable characters and interesting plot beats to follow, a ton of replayability with many different mini plotlines to follow and girls to potentially romance.

LWR does have some gameplay elements to it as well. You take the role of an archmage training his two apprentices. Over the course of the game you'll be able to send them on quests which are essentially mini-stories which grow their abilities and can increase your affection levels with different characters, earn you collectible items, or diplomas which are important for determining what the girls do after they graduate. Each quest requires that the girls know certain spells. Spells are learned via spending Spirit in a skill tree type system, and Spirit is earned by doing lessons. Lessons are a dice-based minigame, but the player is allowed to fudge the dice a bit to get results you want; it rarely feels unfair.

So the basic gameplay loop is:
- find a quest you want to do and look at the required spells
- check the girls' skill trees so you know what you're aiming for
- Do lessons and learn the spells you need
- Do the quest

It's pretty simple and easy to understand, but many quests have a time limit attached to them and can lock you out of certain endings if they aren't completed so it's best to focus your efforts on quests for the one girl you're most interested in for your first playthrough.

My biggest issue with the game is that many scenes are extremely long in between gameplay sections, but if you're a veteran Visual Novel enjoyer that probably won't bother you. It's also a TINY resolution due to being pretty old.

Oyari Ashito is an excellent artist with a unique style, and if you like this game I would recommend another title they did called Quartett. The Voice acting in this game is also extremely professional and well-done for such a small production, dripping with character and emotion. It's also a manageable length. One playthrough will probably take you 10-15 hours, but you can easily stretch that to 30+ trying to see everything. 

There is also (of course) an uncensor patch one easy google away. It features a lot of unique art you'll miss if you play without it, and is fully voiced as well.",1699436065,1699436065,True,3,0,0.556227982044219971,0,True,False,False,True,,,

There is one important thing to think about before considering a purchase, though. There is some misinformation floating around that this version is the same as the PS2 one, which is not true. The console version was much more heavily censored (and had different gameplay). When I was new to Japanese PC games I thought ""all age version"" meant family friendly-ish, and therefore ended up purchasing this game. However, it seems to mean something closer to ""everything between heaven and earth except adult-only content"". Some scenes, themes, and visuals can appear to be disturbing to players who're not already deep into the anime fandom swamp.

‚Ä¢	Constant sexualisation of children. 
‚Ä¢	Some interesting story, but mostly boring filler.
‚Ä¢	Frustrating gameplay that has some potential.

Detailed version:
So I wanted to like this game. I love ‚Äòprincess maker‚Äô style games. I was fine with this being the ‚Äòcensored‚Äô version because I‚Äôm Ace, (I don‚Äôt mind sexual content, but its not why I buy a game). The gameplay style worked well for me, though it was somewhat confusing. I like stat raising, I liked how learning spells are used for both quests and improving your lessons. I like that when you finish the game, you ‚Äòinherit‚Äô spells so you can still use them in lessons (though you still have to ‚Äòlearn‚Äô those spells again, it‚Äôs a lot faster). 

There are some interesting stories and characters, but‚Ä¶ well you have to slog through so much to get there. Every new spell gives you a long, usually pretty boring scene where the girl learns that new spell. Sometimes those scenes are cute or add background info, but mostly it‚Äôs ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to try a new spell, I don‚Äôt think I can do it, oh I did it! Yay!‚Äô or ‚ÄòI can totally do this complicated spell! Wait, why is my teacher on fire again?‚Äô Much the same happens on quests. 

I didn‚Äôt mind that more and more characters kept moving into the tower for increasingly contrived and ridiculous reasons. I shrugged when every female character seemed to have the hots for the protagonist. I just wanted the cute story and stat raising. I was excited to get the girls through their exams and help them achieve some cool endings. I was rather disappointed honestly, even following a guide didn‚Äôt really help getting all the spells I needed in time to do the relevant quest, so I only got one rather dull epilogue. But hey, that‚Äôs what replays are for right? But apparently you‚Äôll need to do a lot of save scumming and replays to see all the endings. Par for the course‚Ä¶ 

And then came the adult content. Yes I‚Äôm playing the ‚Äòcensored‚Äô version of the game, but it still has clothed suggestive content and dialogue. At first I just kinda shrugged. I‚Äôm not here for that, but I can enjoy some romance in my games. And then there was the first ‚Äòteacher walks into his student‚Äôs room without waiting for them to say he can, and big surprise they‚Äôre in a state of undress! Teacher is mortified and blusters about this at length to give the player time to ogle the girl.‚Äô Scene. And they kept coming. 

The students look and act like pre-teens. They‚Äôre supposedly 15-18 (aging over the 3 years of the game), so it‚Äôs ‚Äòfine‚Äô that the protagonist can date one at the end if he wants. But they‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre adults. And even if they are, he‚Äôs a lot older than them and in a position of power over them. (I know some people enjoy the ‚Äòprofessor/student‚Äô dynamic in things, but this was done in such an overtly creepy way). They are constantly referred to as ‚Äòlittle girls‚Äô, they wear little girl outfits, they have the maturity and life experience of little girls. They look 10-11 years old. And all that might be tolerable if all the romance and sexualising happened at the very end after they‚Äôve graduated. But it doesn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a constant stream of ‚Äòsexy‚Äô panty shots and half clothed shots and ‚Äòawkward‚Äô situations. A grown woman gropes a little girl and suggests they go to bed. This is played for laughs. 

And it didn‚Äôt have to be. The relationship between the protagonist and the girls is set up as mentor/father figure. When it‚Äôs not being needlessly sexualised, it‚Äôs cute and adorable and heart-warmingly wholesome. And it gets ruined two slides later with a gratuitous panty shot‚Ä¶ The adult stuff could have been kept to just the adult women, but it isn‚Äôt. 

Most of the adult characters look like adults, with the exception of the ‚Äòangel‚Äô character. Who‚Äôs supposedly thousands of years old, but is dropped into the story looking, you guessed it, like a pre-pubescent little girl, and wearing a very revealing bikini (and nothing else). She calls the protagonist ‚Äòmaster‚Äô. She‚Äôs also horrifyingly na√Øve. It‚Äôs not sexy, it‚Äôs creepy. 

Many of the other adult female characters, while looking like adult women, behave in childish or na√Øve ways that make you feel dirty for any sexual interaction you‚Äôre forced through with them. 

I‚Äôve played the game through once, I tried for a replay, but the gross sexualisation of little girls just got more and more common (as I was able to do more quests and unlock more scenes with characters.) I played as long as I did because while it was frustrating, once I got some practice with the gameplay I liked it. But I just can‚Äôt play anymore. I feel dirty just OWNING this game. And the problematic stuff happens far enough into the game that you will almost certainly have exceeded the amount of time you can play before Steam no longer offers a refund.

[h1] Story [/h1] Wir spielen einen Jungen Erzmagier namens ""Domino"" und sind von der Magierakademie weggegangen und haben Unterwegs einen Alten Turm genant ""The Dark Tower"" gefunden und haben es uns in diesem Turm nun gem√ºtlich gemacht. Wir bekommen von der Akademie aber die Aufgabe, 2 Junge M√§dchen genant ""Kaya & Aria"" innerhalb von 3 Jahren zu Zauberinnen auszubilden. Leichter gesagt als getan denn es ziehen fast W√∂chentlich Neue Bewohner in unserem Turm ein (nat√ºrlich alle Weiblich)

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Das Gameplay ist etwas kompliziert zu Erkl√§ren. Man liest sich √ºberwiegend durch die Story. Das Spiel ist in 3 Jahren aufgeteilt. Pro Woche sehen wir immer ein Event. In jeder Woche k√∂nnen wir unsere beiden Sch√ºlerinnen, Zauber beibringen. Dies kann man aber nur indem man sogenannte  ""Spirits"" sammelt. Daf√ºr muss man ein W√ºrfel Spiel spielen, dabei haben die W√ºrfel 5 verschiedene Spirits, die man erw√ºrfeln kann/muss. Mit diesen ""Spirtis"" bringen wir dann den beiden verschiedene Zauber bei, damit sie dann auf Quests gehen k√∂nnen um mehr Erfahrung mit dieser Magie oder um Items oder Diplome zu bekommen (Man braucht immer bestimmte Zauber f√ºr bestimmte Quests). Jeder gelernte Zauber, jede Quest und auch ""fast"" jede Woche zeigt verschiedene Events, die oftmals richtig Humorvoll sind wie z.B. ein Misslungener Zauber unserer Sch√ºlerin, trifft unseren Helden. Die Musik & der Art Style sind absolut Fantastisch. Es gibt nat√ºrlich die ein oder andere gewagte Szene, wie man es aus typischen Animes her kennt

It seems also fairly linear no choices, unless you count which spells to learn etc..

The game is wonderful, but you should know what kind of game that is before you buy. This is a raising game, you are a magic teacher and you have three years to teach for two female students. Classes are a minigame of dice (which is fun) where you earn points you spend to learn magic. You should also do quests (which are actually events) to release the characters' routes and increase the point cap, each quest requires a series of spells. The story of the game is good, a bit simple, but very fun and good to read. But the main point of the game is its beautiful art, you will hardly find a game more beautiful than this. The ost is very relaxing, all the characters are dubbed, the dialogs are like dialog boxes of comics and the game has more than 300 CGs, which greatly increases the replay factor. It even comes with some fun extra stories. A warning, the art is very beautiful, but it's a bit ""bold"", avoid this game if it bothers you.

The overall gameplay loop is simple you roll dices to gain spirit, you use said spirit to teach spells to the two girls then go to quest which have a required spell and gives you some increase in the spirit cap (since spirit has a cap). There are 5 types of spirit and usually quest increases the cap by one or two. The quest themselves are escencially a small tale on how the girl used certain spell. Quest also serve to determine the ending. There is also each in game year a exam that requires an specific spell to be learned or reach certain amount of spirit, this is random so it will change in every playthrough. Most endings either require you to get specific certifications or complete certain character specific quest and most have a time limit so you won't be able to do them if time passes. If you fail to meet the exam requirements, you also get an ending. The game has a new game plus more to keep the spells teached to the girls, but the spells are only usable for gathering spirit and must be learned again to be used in quests. Gameplay aside characters are simple but properly fleshed out, usually having a backdrop that justifies their behavior with the exception of the protagonist who is really a proxy for the player to self-insert. Overall the game is, as I said earlier, pretty relaxing but overall an above average VN but as far as the most comfy ones is definitely in the better side",1530333557,1558021745,True,1,0,0.470872998237609863,5,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a game about teaching magic to two girl pupils. Quite a bit of ecchi, there are some pantyshots. It has explicit scenes in the original, but not here.

The game consists of giving lessons to the girls, throwing dice and manipulating the rolls for better results. From there you build your stats and spend them on new spells. Then quests require certain spells and give rewards.

There are like 20 endings. The better are the pupils' ones. The point is passing 3 exams, one a year. Exams can be a bit difficult since you have to cast certain spells and have to control both girls' rolls. Otherwise the game is easy peasy.

The game is cute and fun but it's by no means an essential game.",1526233468,1548878611,True,4,0,0.552719950675964355,0,True,True,False,False,,,

The game's freehand drawing art style is complemented by a speech bubble text box version of visual novel dialogue, which makes it feel like reading a full-color manga.  

You're the archmage Domino in charge of training Aria and Kaya, the two ""worst"" apprentices in Hogwa- I mean ""Grimoire"" Magical Academy, and are banished to an abandoned Dark Tower to do it because you mouthed off to your superiors.  Aria is a brash, reckless duke's daughter who exemplifies all the stereotypes of The Wizard's Apprentice of trying to steal magic books and cast spells she's not strong enough to control and whose spells routinely backfire upon her.  For reasons that aren't explained, Kaya, an orphaned outcast from a magical tribe, is lumped in with her in spite of being shy to the point of meek, obedient, diligent, talented, and earnestly seeking her teacher/foster parent's approval in all things. That is to say, she's an ideal student, and nobody ever explains why she'd be called a ""worst"" one, and she essentially only gets in trouble because Aria dragged her into it or Domino's being ludicrously lax in his oversight of the application of combat magic again.  (In fact, Aria and Kaya seem to do everything in the game on their own, to the point that it's a constant question to ask ""What is Domino DOING with all his time he's not teaching?!""  He certainly doesn't seem to have any other projects that would excuse his absence...)

The game takes place over three years in-game, with the player getting to manage the time once per week. (With 52 weeks in a year, so 156 turns in a game.)  ""Lessons"" are the main gameplay mode, where you try to generate ""spirit"" the girls need to learn spells through a dice-based minigame.  ""Learning"" spends spirit to learn a spell, which also takes a whole week, but comes along with its own vignette with the girl learning or what they do immediately after learning a spell - I.E. after learning the ice-making glacies spell, Aria uses it to make ice-based treats until she gets a stomachache.  ""Quests"" are requests from one of the adult side characters that are just visual novel dialogues that are automatically successful if you have the required spells already learned. The only ""challenge"" in them is a time limit to complete them, meaning that you have to manage your time well to keep gaining enough spirit to learn spells before you actually need them.  

The Learning minigame may be dice-based, but it's hardly just luck.  You can ""bump"" dice once they've landed to force the die to land on the face you click.  Since you can only see 3 of the 6 faces of the die at a time, this may require repeated ""bumping"" to flip a die completely over, and you have a limited number of ""bumps"" per session, but generally, it's not THAT difficult to get everything you want.  Contrary to what you might expect, the luck tends to come in after the dice, with the spells themselves.  Some have effects of making an object blow through the field and generating spirit whenever they touch a die, but where they appear is random and can totally miss the dice, while others make objects appear that give you more spirit or even more dice if dice bump into them... but require dice to actually bump into them.  Spells like Auctus Herba are really useful in that it makes extra dice, but when Aria takes all of Kaya's dice, you're forced to reset to get another shot.

There are 5 different types of Spirit you need, from gloves (representing ""hands-on experience"" apparently), to crowns (representing ""wisdom""), to gems (representing ""intuition"") that come on the die faces.  There is also a moon-shaped face that is a sort of wild card that generates several points of random spirit types, but which doesn't appear on many dice.  The girls have dice that only have four kinds of spirit, and switching tutor and classroom change the faces of the dice.  (I.E. the Library has half its die covered with books.)  

It would be a simple matter of just getting as many moons as possible were it not for the fact that spells have an effect on the dice game.  If you get certain combinations, the spells trigger and give you bonuses.  One of your first spells gives +5 spirit for whatever you roll on a die... and you start with just 1 spirit for whatever you roll, so that's a pretty immediate and insane jump in power. As soon as you have any spells at all, the game becomes about planning out the proper order of spellcasting you need to obtain the spirit you need for your next batch of spells to learn and repeatedly bumping until you get all the spells you want, and the notion that this is ""luck"" just because it involves dice goes flying out the window.  

The visual novel parts are general comedic anime fare, essentially somewhere between ""slice of life"" in a medieval-ish fantasy setting with worldbuilding, and a goofy ""another world"" setting.  In spite of being what we are assured are nobody terribly important (nevermind the fact that the main character is established as one of only a handful of archmages in the world teaching a duke's daughter) living in a forgotten ruin, you quickly have a roll call of fantasy bigwigs knocking on your gates, from the princess of the country with her catgirl slav- maid, an I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Catholicism church-sanction saint and her paladin bodyguard, an angel in an outfit that would make a succubus blush, the foremost genius architect/engineer of the realm, a mighty witch who's also Aria's ancest- I mean ""youthful big sister"", 
an elven ranger adventuring buddy of Domino's, a champion gladiatrix/assassin, the queen of fairies, and an ancient ghost guardian of the ruins.  All of them but the ghost just so happen to be beautiful women with an interest in the main character.  Other male characters exist, but are much more marginal in the story, even Domino's supposed best friend fellow wizard.  So, yeah, it's anime, but it's one of THOSE anime.

As several other reviewers harp upon, this is a ""censored"" version of a previously ""mature"" game, which was something I didn't realize upon first seeing this game.  (I mean, it didn't really LOOK like the sort of game that would be ""mature""...)  Looking into it, this involves adding swimsuits when characters go bathing, and removing sex scenes outright.  Fortunately, there are plenty of adult characters besides the child apprentices that seem to be the focus of the sexual content, but even this version of the game has most of its hints at sexuality being flashed underwear of Aria and Kaya, as well as Sepha (an angel no less) wearing something on the skimpy side of being a bikini.  

What really gets me is how unnecessary it all is.  If they'd never put in the sexualization to begin with, without too many other modifications, they could easily have made what is basically an anime plot that could have appealed to either gender/sexual preference on the basis of the cuteness, alone, and there wouldn't be large number of people who can't get into the game thanks to being unwilling or unable to put off the sense that you're meant to be sexualizing the child characters.  (And yes, Aria and Kaya are definitely children.  When Princess Fianna first arrives she makes a comment assuming that they are the main character's daughters, not apprentices, although Domino himself is supposedly young and around his late twenties, himself.)

The game's vignettes are highly random, as well, which can lead to sharp breaks in tone.  I can teach Aria a spell in a week, have the VN part where Aria's spell backfires on her again in a comedic vignette, then fade to black and all of a sudden, the catgirl's in heat.

In total, if you enjoy manga or anime featuring cute girls doing cute things, you'll probably enjoy this if you can get past the fact (or relish it, I suppose) that there's a sexual undercurrent.",1524853908,1525112932,True,3,0,0.503934681415557861,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is indeed more active, but only barely. The game play is still limited to a couple of decisions at the start of the week, followed by entire chapters of text and interactions. For people who like visual novels with mostly dialogue, thats fine, but it's not what I was expecting. 

Also I don't care for the art style, but thats a personal gripe. Way too cutesy loli-esque for my tastes, and the angel looks like a freaking hot dog. The proportions are just bizzare, and most of the characters could do with an extra meal I think.

The storyline is interesting, being responsible for the two worst students in the academy and training them to become powerful sorcerers, that;s fun. The dice rolling for training is also fun, but I wish the quests were not wholly scripted sequences. Point of fact, everything is a scripted sequence, so you don't really get to make any decisions beyond the training or quest taken that week. 

All in all, while I enjoyed my time with it, I would be hard pressed to recommend this to anyone who isn't already a die hard visual novel fan. The dating sim tag is a big misnomer. If you are expecting an actual dating sim of any kind, stick with Hunie Pop. It's pretty much the only real one on Steam.

So anytime creepy Pedobear Domino makes some pervy remark my hate for him grows.  There are adult women in this game stick to them you creepo.  So I spent most of the game carefully picking choices that would keep them away from him like a protective big sister.  After awhile I decided I didn't want him to get with anyone. I can't even imagine the level of creepy in the uncut version.

Game also cheats you in the endings. For no reason at all, it only showed me one apprentices ending instead of both.  Apparently, only the first diploma you complete matters. LAME.

I was waiting quite a while before writing review for this one. It will be rather short, as I'm honestly still disturbed by this game. I like to play full version of games, instead of censored ones, so whenever there is visual novel with cut-out 18+ content, I try to restore it. Usually it's a good decision. It certainly wasn't in this case, although I wonder if ""censored"" version is really that much different in terms on panty-shots, innuendos, the way characters speak to you and treat you. If not, it's not really helping this game. ""Littlewith Romanesque"" manages to make sex scenes with older looking characters awkward and almost uncomfortable. And there are plenty ""not-old-looking"" characters too, like cat lady, your two young students or angel. I could go with ""just an art style"", if there weren't any normal looking women AND if the young-looking characters wouldn't act in a childish manner. They do. Add to that, that it's get pretty clear, at some point, that you will end up with one (or maybe even two) of yours students in sexual situation and it gets even more gross, since I had really hard time perceiving them as anything more than children and I wanted to see their bond with main character as father-daughters and not something so disturbing. I think pretty much every female character presented in the game, wants to sleep with protagonist at some point, which is ridiculous on its own. 

So that was part about disturbing stuff. How is actual gameplay and is it worth your time? I'll be honest with you - as someone who loves titles like ""Long Live The Queen"", I was very interested in concept of ""raising"" witches, teaching them skills and spells, observing how this  affect the plot and so on. And it's fun. For like 5 hours max. After that you have enough of rolling the dices and teaching them new abilities, especially after you discover, that almost every set of quests, ultimately leads to, wait for it, sex scene! Seriously, at some point it become quite obvious, that raising students isn't my main goal in this game.

Existe aquele clima cliche meio ecche coisa e tal.. Mas ainda falta um toque bem inteligente de humor...
Talvez esse jogo nao desmereca um voto negativo... talvez eu mude depois se tiver animo pra jogar

Romanesque is a very fun casual raising-sim. It can require some level of strategy if you want to get all of the endings or unlock all of Kaya/Arya's spells in a single run, but nothing too excessive. It is highly suitable for casual play.

The art and sound are both very good and pleasant to look at. The dice game which Romanesque is centered around does get a bit repetitive at times, but it's not too bad. There are also a couple hundred different 5-minute scenes that show up between the game, when spells are learned and so on, so the game rarely gets boring.
The restoration patch is pretty recommended, as cutting out some of the original content does leave a bit of an awkward hole in the flow of the game.",1463490150,1463490150,True,3,0,0.505826890468597412,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Review right... it really is a nice chilling game and learning new spells gives a lot of satisfaction. Just give it some time. Although I was annoyed at first trying to focus on spells and dices to advance plot. I was failing magic lessons but I got used to this fantasy life cut into weekly pieces. It is chaotic game because of numerous characters. You know though in general during a game month no real changes are made but new people are introduced all time. We dont have any impact on story except doing quest in Dark Tower. You will uncover small things about game universe with students Arya and Kaya and you will witness some cheerful flirts as Archmage Domino. Usually though scenes are short and thats a bit of unfortunate to get over with. Also kinda silly thing that only one of the two students can learn one spell at a time - that means the other sits and do then nothing.

Thats it. No hard emotional breakdowns. No crazyness. Nothing outstanding really nor negative. Just slowly but nicely made bounds between characters with incredibly well done voice acting - oldschool. If you want to read something lightly adventured and fun. Meanwhile keeping your head occupied with resource management then this game is for you.

Be warned that by purchasing this on Steam you will not be getting the adult content that is present in this game.  You will want to buy this game from jastusa (be sure to switch to the 18+ version of the site) if you want to see that content.

The actual game consists of 150+ weeks (turns) where you may attempt a lesson (which is where the actual dice-rolling gameplay occurs), learn a spell, or go on a quest.  Each week also includes a story scene at the beginning and end of the week.  Each learned spell and quest completed also yields a story scene, so if you do either of those things (and you usually will), you will have 3 story sequences in a week.  Going through these turns and trying to learn spells needed for quests is quite addictive, and even though this game could be considered a visual novel, I sometimes wanted to just skip all the story sections to get back to my objectives.  That, for me was the most frustrating aspect of this game; it sometimes feels like it takes forever to accomplish something because of all the exposition I had to get through in order to do so!  It seems like this may have been even more the case in the adult version where even more scenes can come up.

What mainly sold me on this game is the art and gameplay.  The art is fantastic and maintains excellent quality the whole way through.  Even the ordinary character portraits never get old and everything, including backgrounds was done with utmost care.  The music is also nice and the ending theme especially is excellent.  

It is impossible to do everything in this game in a single playthrough.  It took me a little over 10 hours to get through my first playthrough, and on subsequent playthroughs, you can use previously learned spells during the dice rolling lessons, which really increases your potential to learn magic.  Because many scenes will have already been read, and can be skipped, new playthroughs have a really good pace and it's fun to try to do events (quests and spells) you chose not to focus on originally.  Overall this game is very addictive and excellent value.

One thing to note is that even though explicit content was removed for this version of the game, there are still panty shots and other segments that sexualize the students, who look and act like early junior high students.

You can call this game ‚Äúlittle witch training simulator with gameplay‚Äù: you are an archmage living together with two students in a tower, each week you decide what your two students will do: study with dices, learn a new magic spell or go for a quest. Sometimes new faces appear and make your tower their home. Every year exams happen and make your life harder. So, it's just a calming slice-of-life experience of a mage and his students living by the countryside.

Gameplay: it's your regular visual novel with some dice-based gameplay elements. Visual novel routes are implemented via quests: to see the ending for specific character you must complete all of character‚Äôs quests. Every quest has it's own deadline and requirements (often a list of spells which your students must learn), so try to plan ahead while playing or resort to using a guide. Some complex endings require both successful completion and failures for certain quests, and will get specific diplomas for your students. It‚Äôs a very long novel/training simulator full of interesting, funny, and scary events

R-rated content: Along with an All Ages Steam version, I played a standalone 18+ version. Most scenes featuring ""close contacts"" feel totally out of place and unnecessary. It's just like ""Ok, we need to place some porn in this game, - Where? - Right here! - Why? - Because fuck her, that's why.""

Characters: You are not a pedophile. Which is lovely.

In Littlewitch geht es darum die zwei Shojos [u]Aria Vancleef[/u] und [u]Kaya Xavier[/u] (Hat nix mit den S√§nger Xavier Nadoo zu tun^^) zu Magiern auszubilden und ja das ist es eigentlich schon.

Man muss ihnen diverse Zauber beibringen das schon am Anfang sehr schwer sein kann im allgemeinen das Game ist nicht so einfach zumindest am Anfang nimmt es nicht so tragisch falls ihr mal die ein oder ander Quest nicht schafft man kann eine neue Runde Starten und die berreits erlernten Zauber nutzen aber erst nachdem man eine Beendet hat.

Nebenbei macht man noch Insgesamt 79 Quests (Perfecta Verso, Regia Verso wohl beide gleich)
Bei diesen Quests kann man Items, Diplome und Zuneigung der 7 Routen Chars freischalten.

Zuneigungs Quests sind wichtig f√ºr das Ending des jeweilligen Chars,
Folgende Chars haben Routen [u]Aria, Kaya, Fianna, Olga, Olivia, Mariela und Merret[/u]
Gesamt gibt es 12 Shojos (Perfecta Gesamt 26 Szenen, Regia Nope)

Am meisten gefiel mir aber das Artwork das hat n bisschen was von Gem√§lden

Do you like a visual novel that has gameplay elements? Do you like that gameplay to be technical and complicated, yet managable and still enjoyable? You've found the right one. 

Take a story that revolves around magical learning and slice-of-life fantasy, then blend it with some time-management and an intriguing dice-rolling mechanic, and you get Littlewitch Romanesque. And is it ever astoundingly good! Nearly every scene between lessons contains lore, and there is enough depth to the worldbuilding within the story to give you a lot for your imagination to explore. 

The plot, despite being an eroge (with adult scenes removed on Steam), is actually surprisingly not that perverted. If gratuitous sex is a turn-off in other visual novels, you'll be delighted by how focused the plot is on revealing its world and developing its huge amount of characters. Sure, there's some fan-service (as one will always expect due to the genre), but it's almost always either comedic or sentimental, and rarely feels out of place. 

And don't even get me started on the artwork. HOLY CRAP, is this some absolutely stunning art. You can see the love and detail in every single scene. 

If you're looking for something story-rich, with fantastic artwork, just the right amount of challenge, and a little less perversion than the status quo, Littlewitch is the VN for you.",1435608017,1465109096,True,14,1,0.63421940803527832,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Littlewitch Romanesque is the first VN i buy and it completely took me off guard. It have good story and something magic that please me.

Everytime i load my save i have a smile. Do not ask me why, i have no idea :) Maybe it's the voices ? The good musics ? The lovely graphics ? Or all of this maybe ! 

I have not finished it yet. I read i need to play it more than one time to get everything unlocked and see all the possible endings.

Girlish Grimoire Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Regia is a visual novel with a small interactive gameplay that makes it even more engaging.
You play as Domino, a very well known mage that was tasked to study an ancient tower and train two apprentices whom apparently thought to be problem students. Later on.there will be more people who gets involved in your used-to-be quite living in the tower. Most of them are beautiful ladies so it's quite a harem.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Aside from it's beautiful comic-style visual novel story telling, LR:ER involves rolling dices that affects the attributes for the apprentices. These attributes are needed to unlock spells, and spells are needed for quests and exams. Some quests also gives you some plus points with the ladies so go show them that magnetic attraction of yours Mr.Wizard..*cough*

I'm still hoping for achievements implemented in this game. After all, this visual novel already has gameplay and quests so why not? Even simple VNs in steam has achievements, it would be fun to have it for LR:ER.

[h1]Final words....[/h1]
This is the first Littlewitch game that  I've played. It was just sheer curiosity that I picked up a title that is aimed for males and I wasn't disappointed.
Primarily because there's always an event brewing and more characters being introduced. I'm still getting a hang on the dice rolling, I'm not lucky or skilled to turn the tables but I'm trying...to woo the ladies ^_~ *wink*

The artwork and music is beautiful, and I dig the lighthearted atmosphere and funny scenes. One of my gripes with the game is it's small resolution. You get an option to turn it into fullscreen but for people who are anal with graphic bluriness you might not like it. 

I cannot recommend this game to folks who are triggered  to fan service and gets offended to seeing an art of a skimpy translucent clothing of an angel character or pantsu from your apprentice or another lady. 

But to folks who can bypass that, then I really recommend this gem. I hope more Littlewitch games will come to steam!",1430215196,1430216056,True,7,0,0.604194819927215576,0,False,False,False,False,,,

They also happen to be considered Grimoire's worst students, making the 3 years limit a challenge. Domino, however, yearns to explore and push the boundaries of the arcane, and he's eager to train them well.

Littlewitch's story takes off well from the beginning thanks to the highly imaginative art put into it. Even the male characters, often neglected in visual novels, are drawn with care and skill, and the same elegant style extends even into the games menus and overlay. Ashito Oyari's style is immediately distinct and enjoyable during all parts of the game, where it fits the nature of the setting so perfectly it makes you wonder whether the art preceded and inspired the entire project.

Gameplay is reminiscent of Princess Maker in scope, but it plays much closer to a voiced visual novel with puzzle/stat oriented gameplay attached to give a sense of progress to Domino's goals of teaching and raising the heroines. Between quests and events, there's more than enough to fill several playthroughs in order to see everything within your 3 years in-game time limit. During which, each of the multiple endings are strongly built up, and when they come there's heavy payoff, as you'll want to sit quietly and soak in events unfolding. Thankfully there's a New Game+ mode which retains spells learned during lessons into the next playthrough.

This is one of those instances where an ambitious game pays off, where all of the talented components fit together, from the inspired art, sincere story, voicework, and even to the accurate and faithfully nuanced translation JAST has a reputation for, all complimenting each other into an experience above many of its peers in the visual novel space.

I've only played an hour as of right now but I have to say, I've already laughed, been emotionally moved and otherwise enjoyed the story. And that's an important note, this is a very story driven game, and it does not fall short at delivering. Another important note is that this is an adult game with the adult content removed. Despite that removal there remains a definite appeal to the lolicon, as there's a panty-shot very early and, I mean really, just look at the angel Sepha.

[b]!~  I very much hope that  JAST will see fit to make a patch available to those who wish to reintroduce the explicit content that was removed for distribution via steam ~![/b]

I actually bought this in an instant because I'm familiar with the artist's work, knew a bit about this game, didn't know it was available in English and quite foolishly assumed that there would already be the desired patch available as with when I purchased HuniePop (though that's an entirely unrelated game). Needless to say I should have read the description all the way through and now I'm a tiny bit disappointed (in myself mostly).

[h1]Regarding the actual gameplay[/h1], it's quite interesting in how the story is advanced. Rather than dialog trees there's a sort of dice minigame where you get different kinds of ""spirit"" depending on what is rolled, and rolls can be messed with by ""bumping"" the dice as they're rolled, so it's not all chance. The different spirit can be spent to unlock spells, which gives you a scene, the spells can be used when rolling the dice to further modify results as well as being a prerequisite for quests, which also advance the story. there's more to it but that's the general idea.

[h1]Back to the story[/h1], I can't believe how attached I am to these girls already. Aria's straight forward attitude and reckless behavior, Kaya's quiet anxiety and compassion; they both are very quickly established as people with life and personality that makes you want to see them succeed. Their envy of traits they see in the other girl, and their self doubt make them all the more human. The voice acting is good too. I can't help but look forward to getting to know the girls better and guiding them to happiness and success.",1428139215,1428139215,True,124,17,0.624615132808685303,1,True,False,False,False,,,
