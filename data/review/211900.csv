This means you can summon a dragon without fear that it'll fry half your troops by using its breath attack to try and chase a lone fleeing enemy. You can let your Necromancer cast Decay AoE spells without fear that the main victim will be your newly recruiting frontline commander or hero. And cavalry-type commanders won't be charging the enemy frontline alone and get surrounded and obliterated.

Granted, combat is quite a bit more primitive than in the previous installment. It is heavily defender-biased, since every single unit of the defender gets to act first before the attacker has a chance to play. I wish the initiative system introduced in the following games was in this one, then we could have the best of both worlds.

Magic gameplay is also more straightforward, since for instance your Necromancers get all their rituals right off the bat, instead of having to pay large amount of resources to randomly unlock new ones until you get your desired ritual.

Basically this is a good counter-example to the myth of infinite progress and a blow to the Cult of the New. Sure, CoE4 added a large amount of features, some of which are really fun, but it modified the combat and other gameplay elements in ways that actually feel worse in some respects.

Otherwise, this game's qualities and flaws are well-known.
GOOD: Great faction, unit, summons and spells variety, epic-level spells and monsters. Coop play.
BAD: High randomness that can kill you in ways that feel unfair, and exhausting whack-a-mole ""gameplay"" with dedicated armies just to keep the pesky neutrals under control. Maps very slow to traverse with no roads, and a very slow start on low resources with dozens of turn needed to recruit a single squad. And while the factions are varied, within a given faction you have a lot less variety in the actions you'll perform every turn compared to series like Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders. UI is buggy as well as both over-complicated for the simple tasks required, and providing very little info on game mechanics. Trade system is over-simplified and often unhelpful. Only source of gold is the monthly income, with no way of getting more during a turn even if you're one gold short of recruiting a wizard. Recruitment offers only last one turn which feels needlessly restricive.

TIPS:
Spacebar takes a commander out of the rotation for this turn.
A prolonged right-click on a recruitment point (crown icon) opens the recruitment screen with this stronghold already selected.
Bandit camps spawn bandits, graveyards spawn undead, ancient forests spawn animals. Control or burn those if your faction and current units allow you to, to stop the neutrals spam.
You can move an insane commander if it's already part of the army of another commander.",1630819092,1703716608,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Watching two deers and a rabbit  enter your base that should have been a mediaval castle full of people, and razing it to the ground feels stupid beyond belief. The devs, hahaha, consider it to be a fantastic joke, and feel happy about themselves, but the result is a miserable game. However, because they refuse to innovate, you can bet that COE5 will feature the same ""system"". 

99 percent of the gameplay is you and your main stack meticulously scouring the map to collect 99 mushrooms/gems/herbs/ears/berries to conduct some unearthly ritual that will cause your power to explode  - throw 99 berries in a pot, a rift opens, and an army of huge berry monster will join you, allowing you to easily win the game. Or they will eat you  - it all depends on a dice throw, which is again, hahahaha, great design. 

The graphics of the game is atrocious. The sprites are super small, humanoid units look almot all the same, and the UI is a total joke. The devs basically ignore everything humanity learnt about GUI, conveying invormation, color coding, tooltips, etc. and dump it down the drain - instead, they probably use some ancient code written in C language in the 80s, that just have to do (it does not). 

Stay away!

BTW you may have noticed that I used a similar review for COE3 and COE4. That's because they are very similar games - almost everything is reused, including menus, graphical assets (if you want to call it that), rules, gameplay, everything. 

The diferrence is that COE4 has much better combat. The units actuall fight it out on a tactical map, while in COE3, one side attacks at once, then the other side, which is totally and utterly stupid. 

So COE4 = COE3 + better combat - shitty combat",1560706929,1560706929,False,6,0,0.530367732048034668,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It is unique in that the player doesn't actively execute the battles. As such, the thrust is around exploration and allocation of resources. 

Pros:
[list]
[*] Immense roster of classes/races (i.e. representing the player's forces). These races are wonderfully unique, offering a nice range of differences.
[*] No micromanagement in battles. I love TBS/4x games and many of them obviously have the player directing the battles, which is something I immensely enjoy. That said, it is a refreshing change of pace to focus solely on army building and exploration and not the battles themselves. I wouldn't want this approach in all games, but it works very nicely in this one.
[*] Immense list of opposing monsters and neutrals. Immense list of magic schools (though again you don't directly cast).
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Well the graphics aren't good. If you are a graphics snob, you will be disappointed.
[*] There is a lot to learn. Beginners may be overwhelmed.
[/list]

Overall: CoE3 ([spoiler] well CoE4 actually [/spoiler]) is a game that sits on my desktop which I pickup between playing other games (as opposed to other games, which once finished, are banished forever). While it won't be for all 4xers, it scratches a very unique 4x itch that other games don't. It has a very deep roster of classes and monsters which will provides hours of gameplay. For me anyway it is a pretty solid recommend. That said, CoE4 exists, which is pretty much CoE3 plus some other stuff. So, if the minor $$ difference isn't a big deal, you should probably get CoE4 if this game looks of interest to you.

You will get a leader and a town who can lead some units. In the beginning you have one farm or resource which gives you +1 gold. Accumulated gold is used for units. There are some special units offers during some months. Each turn is one month. The world changes depending on the seasons.
During gameplay I got one special leader who was useful mage.
Battles are simulations on screen, each unit takes its turn, you can speed it up or skip the battle.
There are running creatures in the world which are neutral and can attack you as well as enemies.
You can see by right-clicking on them what stats they have. If you remember old M&M right-clicking on opponents, it also stops the game during combat, but you can see all their abilities, buffs and damage.
There are some hidden units and you uncover the world from fog of war.
By losing your leader or killing the enemy leader, you eliminate the faction. Units, if not leaders, can not move on their own. They must be transfered to leaders. Otherwise they only defend current tile.
Leaders can move from 1 to 3 tiles, maybe more...

that said, I insta-bought Dom4 as soon as it got a sale (I'm too poor to pay full price), but I'm having a hard time jumping into the CoE4 sale (70% off currently). for one, I have way more games than back then, but for another, I've only played CoE3 about 6 hours before moving on, while I played Dom3 a good 100 hours before getting 4, then played about another 100 hours, then decided my backlog wouldn't play itself - I never really got bored with it.

note, I'm a huge fan of traditional roguelikes, but that's still not enough for me to keep playing this (other than giving it a second chance just in case - it wouldn't be the first game I find ""just okay"" at first, then after a long-ish while fall absolutely in love with it)

I've spent some nice time playing it and finished a couple of sessions.  I'd be reluctant to call it 4x, though.  Although it has all aspects of it (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate), it doesn't have any other characteristics associated with 4x genre - there is no micromanagement, you can't choose different strategies for a battle, and there are no multiple ways to win the game (you have to defeat all the other factions).  I'd be prone to add 'casual' tag to it, since you don't really need to dedicate much planning and thinking to it.  

The best thing about the game is it's high replay value.  There are many factions they play differently and there are multiple possibilities for the terrain.

You can see from the screenshots that the graphics are no high tech, but suitable for the game.  Music is also not very exciting.

The worst thing about the game is lack of any tutorial, and it's not very straight forward.  So I had to read the manual to figure out what to do.

I don't completely hate this game.... It actually have a very large and impressive list of different monster/magic to choose and find out. Exploration and mess troops to fight has quite a bit fun to it. You never know what’s behind fog of war and winning a game on difficulty 5+ is actually quite tough and challenging. 

This game was released just 4 years ago on 2012... Developer put great amount of effort to create a large fantasy world but fail to put enough fun and exciting element into the game to create a game only for the very very hard core fantasy game fan (Nerd only). It's just not friendly and fun enough for the common people.

You have about 15 different hero to choose from 10 different of map generation to create a random map for your commander to discover and defeat. There is no tutorial session and I recommend everyone who wish to play this game go read at least half of the manual before starting. (The first thing u need to learn is transfer units to commander). 

Maps are not always generated fairly and after trying a few games I believe the element of mountain/hill are a bit too much so your units move quite slowly most of the time. Winning is beat the other faction by either kill all their commander or taken all their castle. Discover though fog of wall for independent monster, village, and monster lairs. Magic items can be found and equip the hero into a crazy power house if you are lucky. Hero’s level up and spell/strength become quite powerful if you just fight enough battles. On small map a Game is quite fast. Defend your home and explore out in circular motion and take as much resource tile as possible while not losing too many units. You can only recruit unit and you cannot build any buildings or village yourself. 

Music... Is... Kind of depressing if u ask me and me personally got bored of it quickly...

Graphics is not too bad but consider its 2012 game. It should really be done better...

If you win a game after much effort (on difficulty 5+) or less effort (difficulty 1-5) you will get the very basic and minimum winning screen. There are not individual different ending depend on which hero/faction you choose. Quite a shame really consider the background of all of the different factions are quite fun and basic game over ending make you lose energy to replay.

At first, it kind of reminded me of the old game, ""Questron"".  It was a C-64 game that was pretty good.  The old-school graphics reminded me of something that I found enticing about those old exploration/combat games a la Ultima I - VI.

The more I played, however, the more I began to understand that there's a difference between something that looks old school and is remniscent of my days past and something that is old school.

Old school is just that -- old.  I don't mind the retro style of programming and gaming, but the content should be contemporary, the mechanics should be modern.  I found the controls in this game to be unnecessarily clunky and burdensome.  I couldn't easily figure out how to check the statuses of various units and really couldn't understand.  The animations didn't just look old school  -- they WERE OLD.  Again, it seems as though I'm splitting hairs by saying this, but  there are plenthy of retro games out there that truly are innovative and cutting edge in the content they provide.

One way I could express my experience with this game -- I always felt as though I was on the cusp of an enjoyable experience.  At times, I almost began enjoying what I was playing.  Almost.

I've generally found them too bogged-down in micromanagement and strict formulaic approaches to really be interesting.  That's a personal taste, so I hold my ambivalence to the whole genre a bit in reserve.

This game... doesn't exactly escape from micromangement, (what micromanagement it lacks, it's becuase the whole city-management aspect of 4X games was completely gutted from the game, not because it was automated to give players only the interesting choices,) but it does manage to bring a lot of new ideas to the table to make it at least more interesting, and cities and towns are just resource generation points.  What makes it interesting is that those aren't the only resource-spawning locations.  Each faction has access to different kinds of special resources gained from different terrain tiles, meaning that forests are useless to dwarves or priest-kings, but witches can farm them for fungi they use to summon more units, making controlling them critical when a witch is in play, but pointless when they are not.  This makes the value of different landscapes fluctuate based upon who's in play, unlike a game like Civilization, where all cities are operated in basically the same way, so stealing one is always both a positive to you and a negative to your opponents.

That said, most factions let you summon monsters randomly from a table you have no access to, and because battles are random and uncontrollable, as well, this means that you have randomly created troops filling out uncontrolled lines of battle to fight random battles you can't control with randomly generated enemies to take up random landscapes whose composition you have little control over.  Strategy goes where?

This game winds up using that classic of turn-based (especially 4X) combat models I call ""Stack Mashing"", because all you do is make a giant stack of troops, and then blithely ram it into everyone else's stacks until you run out of stack and need a new one.  In 4X games, this can generally be forgivable because the point of the game isn't some strategic maneuvering, it's building up the infrastructure to field that giant army in the first place.  In this game, however, you really don't have an infrastructure, you just have resource-generation tiles. 

The graphics are ""I could do better, oh, look, it lets you mod the graphics, so I CAN do better,"" and the music can be muted so you can play your own, which is generally what I wind up doing with most games that take a long time to play, anyway, since no game comes with enough music variety to last you a 100-hour game.

I've also only played single player, and I'm not sure how well this game works over the Internet with random nobodies.

It's interesting and has some novel ideas, and so I recommend it to strategy gamers for that reason alone.

피곤한점

-  불편한 이동
     목적지를 지정해놓으면 알아서 이동하는 기능이 없어서 매턴마다 일일히 모든 유닛을 움직여 줘야함. 유닛이 얼마없는 초반에야 상관 없지만 유닛이 많아지면 많아질수록, 영토가 커지면 커질수록 매턴마다 유닛을 옮기는게 아주 스트레스다.
     이동을 할 떈 포인트를 사용하며 각 타일마다 소모하는 포인트가 다르다(평지1, 언덕2, 산악3 등),  보통 이동 포인트는 3포인트나 4포인트가 주어지는데, 겨울이 되면 포인트가 하나 줄어들고, 공성병기나 엔트같은 slow특성 유니트를 포함하면 또 하나가 줄어든다. 포인트가 하나라도 남아있으면 어디든지 이동할 수 있다. (포인트 하나 남은 상태에서 3포인트를 소모하는 산악지형으로 이동가능) 여기서 초과사용된 포인트는 다음턴으로 이월되어 다음턴에 이동을 하지 못할 수 도 있게된다.
     이 이동시스템과 맨 처음에 설명한 수동이동이 시너지를 일으켜 매턴마다 빌빌거리며 돌아다니는 유닛들을 컨트롤 해주는게 엄청난 스트레스를 유발한다. 

- 피곤한 중립 유닛들
   무한히 생성되며 돌아다니면서 아군 영토를 박살내고 다닌다.  이 게임을 처음 한다면 중립유닛한테 수도털려서 게임오버되는 경험은 한번 쯤 하게 될 것이다. 시대를 암흑기로 설정하면 전체 맵의 절반이 중립유닛인데 정말 사람 피곤하게 만든다. 잡으러 다니자니 이동 시스템과 환상적인 시너지를 자랑해 사람 피곤하게 만들고, 옵션의 중립 유닛 이동 보기를 체크해 중립유닛들을 체크하자니 쓸데없는 이동보는데 시간이 엄청나게 소모된다. 방어병력을 배치하는 방법도 있는데, 꽃사슴 여덟마리에게 배치한 방어병력 5~6기가 터져나가고 있는걸보면 스트레스가 장난 아니다.


지루한 점

- 소극적인 A.I
   A.I가 너무 소극적이라 게임이 너무 지루하다. A.I는 방어에는 적극적이나 공격에는 그닥 적극적이지가 않다. 플레이어의 수도를 위협하는건 오직 중립몹뿐. A.I의 방어 패턴도 단순한데, (영토 뺏김 -> 부대 끌고옴 -> 되찾음 -> 부대 병력 나눠서 방어병력 조금 남김)의 반복이다. 방어병력을 약간 남기는 패턴을 이용해서 상대 병력을 계속 갉아먹다보면 어떤 상대에게도 손쉽게 승리 할 수 있다. 

- 후반부로 갈 수록 지루해지는 게임
   코에이 삼국지 시리즈와 비슷한 단점으로, 이 게임도 초반부만 잘 풀어내면 그 이후로는 반복적인 노가다와 마찬가지다. 후반부 플레이어가 다 이겼다고 생각되는 상황에서 이동시스템과 맞물려 병력이 꿈틀꿈틀 거리는건 너무나도 지루하다.


멀티는 해보지 않아서 모르겠으나 싱글플레이 게임으로썬 부족한 점이 많다.

The factions are very different, but the ugly, automatic combat really drags down the game. You have NO control over combat. You don't even get to choose a basic strategy for the combat, like in King of Dragon Pass. And big fights can involve HUNDREDS of individual units! You can fast forward the fight or even just skip to the end, but it's jarring to be just presented with the end result (""Wait, how did Bob the Sorceror die???""). There isn't even a combat results screen listing deaths and injuries. About injuries - have you read the funny review for this game by the guy who was using goblin archers, and they all died except for one, who turned out to be missing all his shots because he was blind in both eyes? That's a funny story, but it's a HUGE nuisance that the game doesn't indicate that a unit has been crippled unless you manually check EACH one. (The developers are planning to add tactical combat to the next game in the series, but the early screenshots show that it's still an ugly mess with too many units).

Resource management is also a pain, because there are WAY TOO MANY resource nodes. This is especially bad with classes such as the Troll King that can and should control EVERY SINGLE FOREST TILE, but every class has to capture tons of tiny little villages and such to get a coin or two of income. And because there's tons of random wildlife running around, you need to either leave a decent number of units behind at each resource node, or a rampaging deer will somehow ""conquer"" the town and make them stop sending tribute, so you'll have to send someone to RE-conquer it.

I can deal with the graphics being worse than games from 20 years ago, but I can't tolerate that the GAMEPLAY is worse than ancient games like Master of Magic.

The guys who make this game are like the Wachowskis - they've got some really great ideas, but they desperately need an editor, which in this case means selling out to a company who uses their creativity but doesn't tolerate bloated game design.",1437146910,1437573847,False,6,0,0.470958292484283447,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The sounds are atrocious, though the operatic soundtrack isn't bad. Combat just runs without any input from you. Your units hop up and down in clumsy drawn-out All-my-guys-go then all-your-guys-go rounds. It's impossible to recommened this game based on the way it looks or sounds. If you crave lots of colorful, well executed feedback and fireworks then this game isn't for you.

If, however, you enjoy truly diverse factions, random maps, tons of monsters, spells and items, executable at a reasonably fast pace, then you will find much to like about Conquest of Elysium.

Rather than attempting to describe the many factions or the different eras that you can play in, as well as the many ways to go about engineering total domination, I'd rather relate an impromptu story that I discovered while playing.

I'd started as the Troll King for no other reason than that I relish having a giant with which to roam the landscape from the very first turn of the game.

Well into the run I'd developed a sizable squad of armored, regenerating trolls that had been the front line for a vast army of goblin archers. While there were enough trolls with enough hit points and armor to absorb serious frontal assaults, they couldn't protect my numerous, but vulnerable, archers from the spells of an enemy Pyromancer that I'd stumbled into.

My trolls didn't care for immolation but they were tough enough to survive the blaze. All my goblin archers, except one lone fellow, were incinerated.

I was momentarily amused by my single tiny camp follower for my troll army and figured I'd eventually make it back to a city where I could recruit more archers. It was not to be, however, because I found myself pushing farther and farther into enemy territory: even without the support of sixty screaming goblin sharpshooters, my trolls were laying waste.

Fight after fight, I marched across the map, more than a dozen armored trolls accompanying the Troll King with this one goblin who hung around in the back.

Perhaps an hour into this Sherman's March, I began noticing that the goblin was comically ineffective. All the trolls would attack and then this one sad goblin would shoot a single arrow, never hitting anything.

After several battles, I finally clicked on the little guy and was amazed by what I saw.

This one goblin had maxed out his level, lost both eyes (which explained all the missing), lost one arm (which doesn't explain how he still managed to shoot his bow), was lamed and had a chest injury that reduced his hit points to the level that a fairy farting at him would have put him in the ground.

I was astounded at how this guy kept kicking along in the company of a massive troll army, fighting devils and hordes of undead, dragons and wizards. Not only had he survived, but he'd become the ultimate veteran. I couldn't help but to imagine this poor wrecked creature and wonder: how does he manage?

I decided that he was sort of a mascot to the trolls, a seemingly immortal mystery that they largely ignored. They allowed him to follow along as a curiosity, feeding him tidbits and saving him from wandering into holes and what not, if only to see how many more battles he could survive, one-armed, lamed and blind.

My imagination went so far as to picture some of his stray shots hitting his troll allies in the back, but that they were so ineffective that the only response to getting shot by the goblin was the laughter and pointing of your troll comrades-in-slaughter.

I'd never have made up that little story if there weren't so many status effects, magic items, buffs and curses and so very many enemy types available to mix and match. By keeping track of individual unit's injuries in such detail and allowing them to accumulate scars and  skills makes them into characters.

If you can look past the presentational limitations, there is a ton of content and gameplay, supporting many different styles, for anyone looking for a fast-paced turn-based (is that even possible?) strategy game.

CoE хороший представитель своего жанра. Что же тут есть:
+ 13 расс (классов) за которые можно поиграть.
+ небольшая кастомизация создаваемой карты (выбор размера, эпохи в которую происходит действие идр. мелочи)
+ есть редактор карты (можно создать и поиграть на своей карте)
+ не надоедающая фоновая музыка.
+ большое кол-во юнитов 
+ несколько уровней сложности для ботов (на последнем вы сольётесь за несколько ходов -_-)
+ до 8 игроков на  карте
+ возможность играть по сети
+ можно добавлять классы/рассы, изменять оформление по средствам установки модов.

Теперь немного минусов:
- немного скучная боёвка отрядов (хотя всё равно переживаешь за своих юнитов бою)
- минимум анимации
- БЕСЯТ ГРЁБАНЫЕ ОЛЕНИ И ЗМЕИ КОТОРЫЕ ПРОСТО СЛУЧАЙНО ЗАХОДЯТ В ТВОЮ КРЕПОСТЬ, ЗАХВАТЫВАЮТ ЕЁ И ТЫ ПРОИГРЫВАЕШЬ.(можно исправить модом, реже обращают внимание на твою крепость)
- Когда играешь за класс которому нужны леса, животные и нейтральные мобы просто рвут пукан на части захватывая эти самые леса.
Ну в общем игра нормальная, и имеет довольно интересную стратегическую состовляющую. Советую.

If you're curious but don't want to commit to cash quite yet I recommend you check out CoE2 available for free from Illwinter's site as a free download. It's a lot more limited than this version of the game, but will give you a pretty good feel for how it handles.

On the good side, if you're looking for a streamlined fantasy 4X that offers a unique collection of races and play mechanics, this might be your games (I especially enjoyed Illwinter's take on why you never see any female dwarfs). It's really satisfying to finally round up enough innocents to summon demon lords, or to finally complete the necromantic ritual which will turn you into an immortal vampire in an old, abandoned castle. 

On the bad side, Illwinter doesn't really care that much about UI. In the Dominions series (which has gotten a lot better on this front) it was the price of admission for a really unique strategy game. With the stripped down CoE approach, the lapses in UI design feel a lot less forgivable. For example, there's no smooth way to start a new game without exiting and launching the game again. Unit moves can't be cued, so you spend a lot of time babysitting commanders on there way back to grab reinforcements.

Past the interface, the abundance of unfriendly fauna can get rather obnoxious. While it's cool that you need to be careful early on, by mid game marauding bands of deer taking unprotected farms just gets annoying. Commanders are a limited resource in the game, so keeping them on hand for pest control can get frustrating. Plus I'm unaware of any kind of ""major events"" summary, so I spend a lot of time at the beginning of each turn checking my domain and making sure Bambi isn't stirring up any trouble. Then on larger maps you can have to cross fields covered with unthreatening but still annoying spawns.

Finally, there's side balance. As is the case with any game that has 17 truly unique sides it's a nightmare. Necromancer's can be unstoppable in the Fallen Empire period, or they can get screwed by their early game position. Playing a side that relies on mines? Hope you start near some, because while your capital normally counts as one, there might not be any others nearby.",1432864647,1432864647,False,10,0,0.550000131130218506,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- factions look and play very differently; many have entirely different resources and mechanics
- lots of factions to choose from
- excellent battle system that doesn't rely too much on RNG but rather, you having imperfect information
- battles resolve before being played, so you don't have to watch them if you don't want
- lots of different types of units
- custom units and mods
- simple and easy multiplayer

Con

- Random roving monster bands often kill you at the start of games in a way that you can't control
- charming, but ultimately sometimes eye-straining and plain ugly sprite-based graphics
- antiquated UI that doesn't let you know what something does before clicking it
- manual doesn't explain too much
- very unbalanced factions
- no real ""population"" or ""civilization"" mechanics to speak of
- one way to win: conquest
- worldmaps are boring

It's okay. If you can get over the issues in the ""Con"" section above, you may get some enjoyment out of it, but Dominions 3/4 is ultimately a better game by the same developers, that allows you more customization and has more features anyway.

Have you ever played a Civilization game and thought ""this is nice, but it's just lacking -something-, feels like it's too aesthetic-heavy, and I really wish it didn't take four days non-stop to play one game""? Try this. The pacing is excellent, each 'race' plays totally differently instead of just having one or two unique units availible only at a certain point in the game and feel fairly well-balanced in spite of it, it only takes a couple of hours to play a game through, you'll continue to have that feeling of exploration and conquest through the game instead of only at the beginning, and it even feels more like you're building an empire than Civ games because NPCs will actually put up a fight, and be genuinely lethal if you let your guard down.

So, if you'd like a 4X strategy game in an interesting fantasy setting with excellent pacing and very well executed RPG elements, give Conquest of Elysium a try, but only if you can get over games with weak graphics, sound, and interface. Great for classic roguelike players who are used to ASCII graphics and perplexing interfaces.

If you -don't- like 4X strategy games or are thinking of getting into them and looking for a springboard, just walk away now, this is not the place to start.",1427458234,1427458234,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

В игре нет туториала, управление и игровые функции абсолютно не интуитивны.

Но у игры столько положительных отзывов, что я решил поднапрячься: почитать мануал, посмотреть на youtube, как играть. Разобрался. Все оказалось довольно просто и понятно: transfer units в отряд лидера и отправляем лидера исследовать территории, попутно захватывая стратегические объекты.

Что в игре хорошего:
 - довольно качественный фентезийный мир. В него легко поверить. В нем есть логика, в отличие от серии Warlock. 
 - довольно хороший рандом при создании карт
 - каждая из 18 рас играется по-своему. Например, Барон захватывает поселения, и каждый год захваченные поселения отправляют ему воинов. И если для Барона леса являлись лишь типом местности, который замедляет движение, то для Ведьмы леса - источник фунгуса, с помощью которых он вызывает новых монстров. Поэтому, играя ведьмой, нужно стремиться захватывать леса. Эти и другие отличия создают совершенно иной подход к игре. И это очень увлекательно.

Что в игре плохого:
 - нет глобальной мотивации играть (истории или мета-игры). Нужно развлекать себя самому - генерировать карту и играть на ней.
 - решения в игре выглядят не столько стратегическими, сколько хаотичными. 
 - очень, очень много юнитов с различными характеристиками и навыками, в которых нужно разбираться. Иногда тяжело посчитать, чем закончится бой. Дискомфортный микроменеджмент.

Дополнительные замечания:
 - будь в игре меньше микроменеджмента, будь она по графике ближе к героям 3, в нее можно было бы играть. 
 - Будь в больше стратегических решений - постройки, возможно науки - игра воспринималась бы более стратегичной
 - будь в игре мета-игра или сюжет - я бы в нее играл долго и счастливо. Без этого мне не достает мотивации играть.",1426356641,1426356641,False,4,0,0.42391011118888855,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you move one a tile that provides any sort of resources you’ll conquer that tile. If enemies are on such a tile you have to fight the opponent’s army before conquering the tile. With your new resources you can build more troops and with those new troops you can repeat the process.

It sucks that there is no tutorial because I think every game should have some explanation on how it works. But that's actually the only coplaint I have.

Quite a few choices of who to play as, and what the world you play in will be like. 
Units differ greately from nation to nation. 
Unique time periods that you can play in, each with it's own special randomized tidbits to throw your armies at. 
If you get into it, it'll eat a few hours of your life and you'll love every minute of it

Things you might not like: 
You don't control how the fights go down.
You will learn to hate woodland creatures as they terrorize you. 
You'll have to spend a while getting the hang of anything. 
Your best wizard will only cast his worst spell, every turn. 
There is always something hiding somewhere, and you'll run into it when you don't want to.

[h1]內容簡介：[/h1]

乍看之下，你會以為這是款向文明帝國(Civilization)看齊，或是和他姊妹作 Dominion (同製作團隊的另款遊戲) 互別苗頭的4X 遊戲。但是如果你能撥冗稍微接觸一下這個遊戲，你會發覺：完全不是這麼回事。比起 4X，這款遊戲更像是另一款老牌桌遊：Risk。不知道 Risk 這款桌遊的朋友，也可以上網搜尋一款跟他很類似的 Flash 小品：Dice War。整個遊戲玩起來感覺差不多就是這樣：你佔地、你生兵、你集兵、你出兵，接著你又佔地、你又生兵、你又集兵、你又出兵.....如此周而復始，簡潔有力的步調。不需要像文明帝國那樣，又要重科技樹、又要調整內政資源、一會兒又要擔心外交結盟有沒有橋攏。不用，現在這些，通通不用。你就是個指揮官，單純就是享受指揮[b]千軍萬馬輾壓[/b]的暢快。

[h1]遊戲特色：[/h1]

[list]
[*]饒富變化的部隊攻擊&百人以上的大軍對峙
[/list]

還記得你最後一次玩文明帝國，是多少人""大軍""的較量？30人？50人？當看著第N個單位從你的部隊跑出來對敵人輾壓展的，是不是感覺只有一個「[b]爽[/b]」？但當你的部隊對著敵人「咿咿喔喔」一番，又跑回來的時候，是不是又覺得少了些什麼？對，變化，少了變化，攻擊太單調了。

然而在CoE3的作戰完全不是這樣。一個部隊，就至少有一種攻擊；拿槍的拿槍、揮劍的揮劍、有的放法術、有的會放毒、還有的噴火吐冰什麼都來。基本上每場戰鬥就像RPG一般，敵我雙方輪流施展屬性、效果變化極多的攻擊；有一發瞬殺的「死亡之指(finger of death)」、淨化掉所有不死生物的「太陽光線(sunbeam)」、或是全面掃場的「大地震(earthquake)」，總之就是五花八門。

然後請記住，上述的這些攻擊都只是「一個」單位。那一次戰鬥會有多少部隊？我目前以死靈法師 (Necromancer)開場，正在跟我家附近的 AI 對手進行「百人 vs 百人」的大會戰。再更遠的地方，已經有其他的電腦玩家，開著250+以上的部隊跑過來了。記得我上面提過，五花八門的攻擊嗎？現在，把這些攻擊乘上100、200，你可以想像這會戰是多麼壯觀。聽著那50+以上的弓手放箭的音效「咻咻咻咻」的沒完，這感覺比起文明帝國的「咿咿喔喔」真是過癮多了！

[list]
[*]永遠猜不透的部隊召募
[/list]

聽了這麼帶勁的介紹後，想必你一定是躍躍欲試，於是打開電腦徵召部隊的畫面一看：媽呀！你唬我！能召募的部隊左看右看也只有六、七種，兩隻的手指頭都還不用全部用到就可以數完。這樣的部隊清單到底是能多有變化？

是的，沒錯，這就是我接下來要提的，CoE3(本遊戲的縮寫，啊？我剛剛沒提過嗎？) 的另一大特色，就是有著龐大怪物清單的怪物召喚！在遊戲中，每個指揮官通常都有其特有的資源，可以用來召喚更進階的部隊。只是好死不死，這個召喚部隊，可是隨機的，隨機到你叫出來的到底是老虎還是小貓，都沒有人知道。你可能在大軍壓境的時候，召喚出了強力惡魔；像我就有一次5~6個人被40個人的部隊追著打，結果一口氣召喚出了骷髏龍(血量是普通單位的10+倍)，瞬間壓回去把對方打趴。當然也有可能運氣不好，緊要關頭的時候叫出了一隻比髏骷兵還要費的小蝙蝠仲魔，這也不無可能。

每天都在開樂透，我覺得這也是這遊戲的樂趣之一。

[list]
[*]總結
[/list]

跟「買 75%off 是內行，買 50%off 是菜鳥，買原價是蠢蛋」的文明帝國比起來，這款 CoE3 內容真是簡單太多了。可是，拜託，這只是款 Risk 啊，Risk 就是要簡簡單單，徵兵、集兵、出兵，單純享受到處輾人的快感啊！只是這樣的話，那這款遊戲的確值得一玩。

當然也有人會拿它跟它的姊妹：Dominion 來比較(尤其是 Steam 前陣子才推出了4代)。我雖然沒玩過，不過我個人的看法是：「如果你都可以接受一款 34 美元的豪華戰棋，你又有什麼不可以接受一款才只要1/3，10美元的濃縮版？」

唯一缺點：明明就是個擲骰抽部隊的歡樂Game，可是製作小組為了讓這召喚不被亂用，硬是拔走了「Load Game」按鈕。有找到mod 可以直接在遊戲內重載遊戲的人，記得要告訴我啊！

推薦給：喜歡玩 Risk 到處拿大軍輾人、沒事在周末想享受輕鬆的策略之夜(沒騙你，基本地圖大概3-4小時就結束)、喜歡擲骰抽樂透的玩家。
不推薦：喜歡稍微有點內政、喜歡畫面華麗一點的玩家(對不起這畫面真的太破，沒辦法，製作團隊是2人小組，美術將就一下吧)",1420985640,1476099078,True,7,4,0.583836257457733154,0,False,False,False,False,,,

A première vue, on dirait que le jeu semble être vide, ou sans intérêt à cause de son interface, il faut le dire moche, et de ses graphismes très minimalistes. Pourtant, ce jeu s'avère être très prenant et addictif une fois la partie lancée. Il faut également savoir que ce jeu a été développé par deux personnes seulement.

On doit choisir avant de commencer une nouvelle partie une classe parmi les nombreuses présentes dans le jeu, toutes ayant des caractéristiques différentes et un RP plutôt bien développé ; on choisit également l'époque, ce qui influencera les paysages et les monstres qui se trouveront dans le monde ; et on choisit également le nombre de joueur, car même si je n'ai toujours pas réussi à jouer contre quelqu'un en multi, il est toujours possible de jouer contre un joueur en local (on se rappellera les parties de civilisation où l'on devait aller dans la salle d'à côté pour ne pas voir ce que l'autre faisait...).
Une fois en jeu, on se retrouve avec une base où se trouve un héros et quelques unités. On ne connait pas la map (elle s'affiche en noir), et pour agrandir la zone de vue il faut déplacer les unités à l'aide du héros qui pourra controler les unités, qui sans héros resteront à l'affut. Il faut savoir que si tous les héros meurent, la partie est perdue pour vous (les autres joueurs peuvent continuer à jouer seuls).
Sur la map on peut croiser différentes choses, comme des monstres des villages des tanières de bandits des anciens temples ou des chateaux. Lorsque l'on passe sur une case spécifique (village, ferme, temple...) et que l'on tue toutes les unités ennemies présentes sur cette case, cette case se retrouvera en notre possession, et plus on possède de cases, plus on gagne d'or et de fer, et plus on peut créer d'unités. L'or et le fer se gagne par tour, et chaque tour on peut créer des unités grace à cet or ou ce fer. On peut également créer de nouveaux héros (donc déplacer plusieurs troupes en même temps), et à presque chaque tour, de nouvelles offres de recrutement seront disponibles.
C'est donc en explorant la map, en capturant des cases et en créant des unités que l'on peut gagner la partie.

Conquest of Elysium est donc un très bon jeu qui se démarque beaucoup de ce que l'on peut trouver autre part.

Conquest of Elysium 3 is the latest in the CoE series made by Illwinter, who are also the designers of the Dominions series. In simple terms the game is about raising armies to defeat your opponenets. At the start of each game you select a class to play which determines how you go about raising your armies or what your fighting style is. An example is the enchanter class, at the start most of your army is composed of generic soldiers until you get resources to summon powerful constructs and golems in the mid to late game.

Pros:
-There are 18 different classes to pick from each having cool special abilities and playstyles unique to them.
-There are many cool units and magic spells to mess with.
-Games play quickly and end faster than most strategy games.
-Random generated maps allow for endless play.

Cons:
-The graphics are rather lacking.
-The unit animations are also rather lacking.
-Lots of unit stats to sift through.
-Some matches are doomed from the start due to bad spawn areas.

Bottom Line:
If you enjoy a strategy game where everytime you play you learn something new this game is for you. If you are short on time a lot but you love to play complex strategy games this is for you as well. If you are a person who cares about graphics do not pick this up, likewise if you are not willing to (possibly) read a manual sometimes then do not pick this up either. Illwinter has made many improvements from Conquest of Elysium 2 and at the cheap price of ten dollars it could be argued that this game beats many modern strategy games in terms of features and replayability.",1419742686,1419742835,True,44,0,0.802224040031433105,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In lieu of a review, here's some very early impressions:

- Fuck. Why did i buy this?
- I SO don't want to play this game.
- I don't even. All these stats... And the clunky menus.
- Allright lets get her holy high highnessness out there a-conquering. A cannibal camp... Oh well, gets me a ritual sacrifice bonus.
- Crap, you front line spearmen need to stay alive.
- Hahaha, suck on 3rd degree incineration spells hob.. er, half.. er. gn... whatever the hell you are, hahaha!
- Damn you and the planes you spawned on, and all other untis that show up to be recruited for 50 gold when i have 49! Still, with cheap summoning i get lots of fresh units. Mostly tiny rats and spiders. :\ Ooh o.O Giant Spider! That's more like it!
- Aw, crapdamn! Lost a town to 4 wolves. 4. Wolves. 4! C'mon town! Mmkay whatever, i'll just have this caster with leadership take a few archers and summoned monsters go and take it back. They can stop by the capital to pick up new recruits as well.
- Wait did my rookie summonamancer just blindly luck into summoning a demigod stronker than 3-4 of my combined armies???! Oooh, and he's a front row melee attacker, sweet!
- Damn these cheap summoning rituals, i'm up to my ascots in rats and scorpions. At least they soak damage really well.
- That... that giant moose is honestly too big. I heard of not seeing the forest from the trees but never a forest from a moose. Seriously.

At this point i have 4 stacks of mixed melee/archers/casters stomping things, leveling up, collecting shiny swords and boots of flight, and generally spreading peace, love and understanding of the Cult of the mad blood god whose return shall end the world in pools of pizza sauce.

The game is relatively straightforwad even if it takes a bit of figuring out. Time wasting features are thrown right out and all that is left aims to streamline fantasy flavored, turn based conquering. Might sound featureless but the unit type and terrain diversity, not to mention hosts of spells and artifacts, season changes and random events all keep your campaign interesting. Plus even mooks get item slots, so you will find plenty of uses for shiny loot.

I can't accurately appraise this game. Not at this time. Ok maybe i can. It's a victory of substance over generic shinied sparkly baubleness. You might wonder why a prettier game wouldn't ever have decent, simple and honest fun mechanics, but the anwser is in the question. If you have a VERY shiny wrapper, then you'd be a fool to put anything better than a turd in it. Final Fantasy says hello.

""I stomped things!""
The menus are a teeny bit clunky and take a few minutes to figure out but the rest is:

Pick the Senator. Want to be a hideous monster that can take out towns single-handedly and not depend on armies so much? Take a troll king.

I wish I'd bought it sooner. It deserves your attention. It's a little gem, a modern Master of Magic, streamlined and simpler but with a richness that stems from the vast treasure-trove of creatures, spells and unique races already made by Illwinter. While you may be familiar with many creatures from playing Dominions, Conquest of Elysium builds on the familiar and adds twists that make it a very different experience. Dominions is for the grand strategy, long turns and slow pace with lots of planning even before the game begins. Elysium is fast, smooth, clean and streamlined. It has a lot of depth without ever overwhelming you with it. The creatures have a massive collection of traits (all with icons) that make them much more than cosmetically different. Your magical resources are only seen by those able to use them - so you're never overwhelmed by having to keep track of gems/herbs/weeds/hands of glory...etc. If you have someone who can use a new resource then you're able to see it on the map, if you don't then you can't see or claim it. It's one of the little things that helps new players. It's simple, elegant and eases you into the game gently. 

Simple, yes. But that isn't to say the game is easy. It's easy to lose and tricky to win. Early mistakes can end the game, losing all your commanders and castles ends the game so there's always some risk from stealthy bandits and animals capturing your castle or some invulnerable creeping doom rolling over your army. At the end of the game, the streamlined options makes the AI smarter and stronger than I've come to expect from many 'modern' games. Even on the default 'jester' difficulty setting the AI can have large armies that are quite happy to attack your towns and castles and use all the magic they have available.

I've not played as every race yet, but I'm looking forward to doing so. I'm looking forward to team games, trying the different map sizes, the different ages of the world and to seeing what other hidden gems I'll find. I hope you get a chance to do all that too.

The varied races play *very* differently which is a pleasant change from most of these games where it's just cosmetic differences between factions.

May not look like it, but this is one of the best turn-based strategy games ever once you get past the learning-curve (which is actually less steep than the Civ games).

Pros: 1. Not like any other game that I am aware of!
-each game plays out completely different
-Equip looted items to unit(s) of your choice
-units gain experience/levels and get better at everything they do (new spells unlock!)
-plenty of personal style choices
-as complicated or simple as you want
-ancient/medieval-fantasy theme is well done

Cons: (these are minor & mods may help some)
-graphics are ... simple
-ui interface could be easier to learn
-neutral animals are a bit more aggressive than is realistic imo.
-I wish there was a way to convert/recruit neutral units into your army, particularly ones that are unique to your faction/class, instead of always being forced to fight/kill neutrals.

Short description:
Unique, turn-based fantasy army building & broad-strategy, map domination.  Game mechanics take a bit to get used to, but are elegantly balanced, with scaling-complexity, and replayability.

Longer description:
-Pick one of 6 different ""societies"" (time-periods which adjust the map generation parameters, making certain map tiles more or less common). 
-Choose one of 18 different ""classes"" (army factions), each with unique combinations of units (each has unique units but many have some common units as well) to battle against the other ""players""
-(the ai has 10 difficulty levels!).
-At least 9 different types of resources make ""money"" handling slightly different based on which class/faction you play (it's simpler than it sounds)
-Build your armies, assign leaders to move them around; explore, conquer, and fight your way to victory.
--Almost every unit has lots of item slots, and items are sufficiently rare as to be extremely exciting when found and generally only equipped to your best units (leaders usually).
--Magic users have their own well-crafted system to them with many schools of magic and various spell ingredients/mana used to power them (see resources like sacrifices, herbs, fungus, and gems)
---Combat is automated and runs in real-time with several speed settings, including ""skip to the end"", which may seem crazy at first but is quite well done.
--unit capabilities & stats are fairly easy to grasp and analyze. Be sure to note your magic users' spells; learn which spells will effect ALL UNITS on the battlefield (including your own!), as you'll likely want to disable the use of those spells most of the time.",1410004344,1423223924,True,92,3,0.875613152980804443,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Один из сторонних проектов шведской студии Illwinter Game Design, центральным я считаю Dominions, этот же проект является экспериментальным и более локальным по масштабу.

      Игровой процесс заключается в бесконечном сражении и захвате ресурсов и ""особых мест"" (инфраструктур) с целью добычи ресурсов для создания армии, модернизации генерала, проведения особых экспериментов и старта особых событий. На выбор даются разные социальные доктрины главенствующие на континенте Илизиума (влияет на вид инфраструктуры континента и вид мобов и еще ряд других не явных параметров) и расы\порядки (18), менее гибкая настройка по сравнению с Dominions но это сделано разработчиками для уклона в сторону, быстрых сражений (малыми армиями начиная от 1 юнита до 100-300) сражения и короткие партии. При этом постройка практически отсутствует (только у некоторых рас\порядков (порядки это общественный строй+культура людской расы, условное определение введенное мною)). Основной упор игры идет на командование малыми армиями и использование способностей генералов с целью получить особые преимущества (призыв юнитов, покупка юнитов, улучшение конкретных построек и многое другое) и собственно сами сражения, которые вовсе не управляемы, максимум можно выставить магу, какие заклинания в бою использовать. Это делает бои менее предсказуемыми но и более интересными. 

      Детализированность в отношении механики и проработки юнитов как всегда приятно удивляет, поэтому стоит внимательно относиться не только в выбору войск но и к противникам, могут встретиться мобы одиночки, с легкостью уничтожающие целые армии. Боевая составляющая так же тонка и интересна если вдаваться в подробности и данные каждого юнита (а их очень много и среди них много сильных юнитов как одночек так и в составе армии). Присутствуют осадные орудия, дающие ощутимые преимущества как в защите города так и в осаде. 
       Отдельно стоит упомянуть проработку рас и уникальные гемплей за каждую, несмотря на простоту гемплея, играть за каждую очень интересно и тактика сильно разниться. Будь то гномы, которые без контроля над большим количеством гор становятся просто беспомощными или ""друидов"" где важно контролировать лесные участки для получения ""травного"" ресурса посредством которого осуществляется призыв существ на свою сторону, или ""демонологи"" собирающие дань с каждого поселения в виде рабов и приносящих их в жертву. Причем при вызове существа, не факт, что оно будет вам подчиняться, оно может тут же наброситься на вас, если уровень мастерства призывающего ниже + стоимость заклинания выше.
        Радует изобилие разных особых ситуаций и событий на континенте, можно найти предмет, нарваться на банду, встретить спящего колосса и пробудить его, при снятии священных печатей за одну расу пробуждаются ангелы и демоны и начинается и без того еще большая кровавая мясорубка, всадники апокалипсиса носящиеся по всюду и уничтожающие всех кто попадется на пути, неожиданное открытие врат в бездну безумными оккультистами, наступление апокалипсиса и многие другие веселости, сильно влияющие на ход партии.

        Рекомендую к покупке любителям пошаговых стратегий, Illwinter Game попробовали сделать настольную игру с большим количеством переменных, воплотить в реальность её очень тяжело, зато в виде программы у них очень даже удалось.

The amount of content is fantastic and the variety of units and heros makes for many happy hours of fantasy wars.

One small con is that user interface isn't super friendly so watching a how to or game-play video on CoE3 would be a good way to quickly learn the ins and outs of how to manage your army.

Pros include: Huge variety of units and artifacts; I ran into a super powerful ring for the first time after playing for 70+ hours. Random maps; so no two games play out the same. Random events, sometimes a aspiring dark mage will ""accidentally” open a gate to the neither world and demons will come rushing out to terrorize the nearby country side.

The last and perhaps best part about this game, is that each race plays out very different from eachother and yet very close to what you would expect in popular lore. When you play a necromancer, you can raise incredibly large armies in a single turn, these troops, while vast in numbers, are really slow and have no range, but the feeling of impending doom when fighting them as the raise more and more troops is loads of fun! This is a very different feel from playing another school of magic such as the enchanter. With the enchanter you enchant massive Golums to do your bidding or perhaps create Necrotods (snake that will bewitch your enemies troops into fighting for you.)

Regardless of who you play, and there are 17 classes to choose from, each race has a very different feel and style that keeps the CoE3 fresh and fun for many, many hours. I watched someone play it on you tube for 30 minutes before I purchased it. So when I started I had a good grasp of how to play. I would recommend doing this so that you do not get frustrated with the slightly unintuitive interface.

Made by the developers of Domnions, it's a different take on the genre from the Dominions series or anything else out there.  It is faster paced and more about combat than most games of this type.  

You choose from a roster of unique leaders (from Necromancers to Troll Kings to the CoE equivalent of Hobbits), and start on a single fortress unique to your leader.  You can capture farms, towns, cities, fortresses, and magical sites.  Each turn is a month and the seasons matter - winter will slow your troops to a crawl and cut your income.  Combat is non-interactive - you can set the spells you want your casters to draw from before battle but that's about it.  There is no diplomacy - everyone is at war unless they are on your team from the start.  The interface is quite intuitive and right-clicking on just about anything will bring up an explanation.    

The best part of this game is how uniquely each of the 18 leader classes plays.  They each have different magical resource requirements, spells, units, methods of recruiting units and progression paths.  For instance, as a Demonologist, you will need people to sacrifice to summon demons and upgrade your casters.  That makes controlling towns and cities important.  In contrast, the Witch powers her summoning spells and upgrades from fungi gathered in forests and swamps - settlements are far less important to her.  I think this is absolutely brilliant game design and the most fun in the game is had by learning each class and struggling to stay alive in the first 50 turns while fighting neutrals and other computer players.  

The game is not without its flaws and frustrations.  The graphics are charming but primitive.  The lack of control over combat can be frustrating - you can lose battles you should win because your idiot spellcasters won't pick the correct spell.  It is difficult to hold territory because your captured settlements don't generate any militia (except for a few leader classes).  You can and do often lose a key city or mine to a rampaging group of 3 small snakes.   The map generator tends to make somewhat wonky maps - each terrain tile seems to be independent of its neighbors so you are unlikely to see a large forest or mountain range.  Instead you'll find randomly clumped tiles that don't look like realistic geography.  And after you've survived the difficult but enjoyable early game, the mid and late game tend to drag on.  It's too bad you can't develop any of the settlements or fortresses (or even build roads to quicken the horrendously slow pace of your armies).  That might add an empire building aspect to the game that would keep it interesting beyond the first 50 turns.  More rituals for each class would also be nice.  As it stands, most classes basically have a weak summon, medium summon, and strong summon spell.  Rituals affecting the world would add a lot to the game.  For instance, if I could blast those aforementioned 3 snakes with a fireball or cast the world into eternal darkness, the mid and late-game would be a lot more fun.   Let's hope CoE 4 adds more depth to the mid and late game.     

However, as it stands the game's advantages heavily outweigh its shortcomings.  I found it to be a breath of fresh air and greatly enjoyed playing a game with each of the 18 leader classes.  If you like fantasy TBS games and are not turned off by the primitive graphics, you'll find it to be a treat.

If you like turn-based strategy games at all, this game will be very fun and addictive.(Some of it isnt very intuitive though, and there are no pop-up tips for new players. So either skim the manual, keep it open in a side window, or be patient until you figure the interface/mechanics out. Or catch a youtube getting started video) The other descriptions say it is very similar to the Civilization games, but it is far more similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic series. (there is no technology research or diplomacy or city/town improvements to build.) Armies can only move when a ""hero"" type unit is leading it. Heroes are the only way to claim the resource generating nodes on the map. The map is far more active than in Heroes of M&M though, with monsters being generated very frequently from ""neutral camps"" like ancient forests and brigand camps, until you take a hero and go clear them out and claim them, and there are random spawn events that happen to keep you from getting too comfortable. The animals will randomly wander and make you lose control of things they move over, while brigands are evil and smart and will go directly for capturing towns and villages away from you and will garrison them and they are stealthy about it.(essentially they are stealthed or cloaked and cant be seen except by running over them by accident or by bringing a stealth-detecting unit with your army, etc.)

The game really shines in the strategy department. Unlike Civilization or Heroes of M&M, the class type you choose will have HUGE implications for how strategies will work (instead of minor differences), it decides what heroes you will have access to, what armies you will be able to create with heroes via magic(if any), what unit types you will be able to purchase at towns you control, bonuses with certain terrain types, weaknesses and strengths with the general types of units you have acess to, etc. Unlike most competivite strategy games the resources themselves are varied and can only be collected by the appropriate hero types. For instance a witch will claim forests and swamps to get an income of fungus to use for making magical brews to summon nature spirits for their armies. A demonologist will want to claim towns and villages in order to get an income of 'sacrifices' to summon demons for their armies. And this is just a piece of the differences.

The combat itself is automated, which was annoying at first, but then I saw why later. You get so many random fights, and some fights with hero vs hero where both sides have 100+ units each, it would burn anyone out to try to control that turn by turn, unit by unit through a combat. In fact, dont miss out on the combat speed control in the upper gith hand corner of the battle screen. You will eventually tire of watching every combat play out at regular speed and will want to be able to speed it up using those controls. Also note that for your heroes and armies that can cast spells, you can inspect them outside combat to choose what spells they have ready for combat.(you dont want a frost demon to blast every creature on the battlefield with a frost attack if you have troops that could get hurt from it on your side, or you dont want to go into a fight with fire spells memorized if you know the enemy hero has tons of fire immune creatures, etc.) Also, it pays to take note of the magical items you find in your travels and from killing enemy heroes. You can trade them around between heroes, and even with your individual army members. (aka - one of your heroes finds a weapon but has one equipped already? if one of your armies he is leading could use it, they will pick it up and use it instead of it going to waste.)",1401230551,1401230551,True,4,0,0.53298652172088623,0,True,False,False,False,,,

同时这游戏不容易上手，请不要指望游戏内教程，如果没人手把手教的话可以去看网上的解说视频，不过建议还是去啃官网上的那本60页厚的英文manual，所以不想多花时间的休闲党也可以散了，但一旦上手之后就能体会到这是一款多么棒的游戏～

总体上这是一款有RPG元素的回合策略游戏，英雄带兵占矿攻城，类型上和魔法门英雄无敌比较像，喜欢战略级别大军交战的地域压制类游戏可以去玩姐妹作Dominions系列，不过系统更加复杂更难上手。

游戏内容的随机性比较大，有一定的Roguelike风格，加上18个完全不同派系/职业和海量的怪物种类保证了你可以往里面砸大量的时间而不会因内容重复感到无聊，此外作者为了不鼓励SL大法还把游戏进行时菜单里的Load Game给去掉了……

战斗是排排站然后随机施法按顺序挥刀全程自动进行，有些时候比较看脸，但决定性的依然是兵种搭配和兵力配置；

一个很大的特色是每个小兵都有一套数据可以装备神器计算经验值和杀敌数，反过来站在前线的肉搏英雄除了可以带兵以外并不比一个强力的小兵出彩，一个脸黑就被对面当成杂鱼集火灭了，这是多么充满人文关怀平等对待每一个单位的优秀系统啊～

The tactical battles are not interactive. The interface is workable, although it's easy to notice details that could be smoother. The soundscape is middling to fair, mostly due to the soundtrack and not the effects.

But the gameplay is great. The variety in factions and how they play is great. You have 17 factions. None of them are all that good. The 'holy church of El' wants to break the seals and release the apocalypse. The deep ones... yeah. Necromancers, Demonologist, and a Troll King. Holy Priestess? Nope, worshipping a demon god. There are a few that are not intrinsically evil, I think that's about as far as you can stretch it in the alignment scale. Still, to illustrate the factional differences.. the Troll King is awesome in battle. He can lay waste to armies on his own. (And at start, that's what you have to do). But after a while, an overly critical mum sends a cauldron of gold because you're not doign so well. That helps a lot, you can finally buy a few units... and then suddenly the dread message: Mum is coming over to take over because her bumbling son is an idiot. New unit spawns in the HQ: Mom. Which is a troll witch of considerable skill, and a definite gamechanger.

You don't get high price games that try to pull all the wacky, wonderful, or scary stuff going around here. It is described as a 'strategy rogue-like', a surprisingly apt description. Your grand armies can be destroyed in moments and your empire reduced to crumbling ruins by a bad choice, it is fast-paced and light-hearted.

You can play as one of 18 different character classes and each one plays differently.

Witches need to collect mushrooms from forests and swamps to summon creatures. 
Necromancers must find places with lots of dead bodies to grow their army. 
Dwarves have one female dwarf in the city that gives birth to dwarf workers...

CoE3 is a nicely put together Turn-Based Stradegy game.  It reminds me a lot of Master of Magic.  There is no control in combat, and the game does not focus on research or city building, but instead, the acquisition of units and capture of cities/towns/villages/mines/outposts/towers/etc.  With each capture, you increase your income, build your army, and set out to explore the map and find and conquer your enemies.

There are numberous races in this game, and most of them play differently.  It's enough to keep me interested to keep playing and learning how they each work.  There are a massive number of unique units, there are magic items you can find and equip, and random world events which can be good or bad... losing a town due to a meteor is never fun, but it sure keeps it interesting!

The game has multiplayer as well.  My friend and I play all the time, and I can say after numerous games, that this is a stable, polished, and enjoyable game to play, either single-player or multiplayer.  If you are into the turn-based world domination, my army is bigger than yours but not necessarily better type games, which offer randomly generated maps, exploration, and a whole bunch of other cool stuff, I'd highly recommend this one.

Una volta ho perso perchè due briganti idioti (e quando dico due intendo due) son passati sopra la mia cittadella, lasciata da me stupidamente sguarnita. Tedio. Così, comincia la nostra avanzata: ogni struttura conquistata ci fornirà risorse, e più risorse avremo più carne da macello potremmo assoldare, e così via fino alla conquista totale. Se vi sembra ripetitivo e semplice è perchè, difatti, lo è. In una ventina di minuti, in barba al manuale e alla mancanza di tutorial, capirete bene le meccaniche e potrete giocare spensierati.

The Graphics are not the focus of the Game, they're focused mainly on conveying information on Terrain types and showing Armies/Monsters. The real work went into the Rule-set, Gameplay, and 17 different playable Races/Classes that each have unique strengths & weaknesses. Add to those 17 Classes the epic number & variety of wandering independent monsters and the fact that Maps are randomly generated (a Map Editor is included to create your own, as well) and the replayability value of the Game is pretty impressive!",1352295724,1352295724,True,3,0,0.521697402000427246,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Each class plays the game entirely differently, and there are plenty of resources to collect for each specialized class or champion unit, meaning you're always on the hunt for more, and you will never be happy with just your initial borders. The learning curve really isn't that high, predominantly because the hardest parts involve figuring out how to garrison troops effectively as well as the different strengths and weaknesses of the randomly generated monsters guarding resources on the map. Everything after that is simple common sense. (Attacking a Hydra with only 10 generic soldiers? You deserve to lose. Duh.) At the time of purchase, this game was only $9.

For example, a Baron (the knightly themed army) gathers an increased amount of gold from his villages and towns but finds little of value on forest squares, while a Druid gathers plants from the wild to produce his special units.
