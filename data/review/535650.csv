Nice small, sort of, escape room game.
The graphics look nice, and everything runs pretty smooth.
I did ran into a few small bugs.
-Sometimes the 'Mechanical room' objective doesn't seem to pass, even though you got the robot fully up and runnning.
-In my first playthrough the button game was just dropping over and over through the room and no way of actually playing it.

But the 'puzzles' are pretty easy.

Paid the current full price of 2,99 euro's and I think it is worth it for the 30-45 minutes it takes. Sadly no achievements, which in this case would have been nice. and no real extra if you even got all goals done (at least I didn't notice anything), and that's a bit sad.

+ Few optional achievements

- Require holding grip buttons - not comfortable with the current Vive controllers
- Very short
- Minor bugs - sometimes physics go crazy, performance issues when watching cartoon (even with GTX 1080), [spoiler]I bought a fuse in advance, but when I needed it, it disappeared and I had to find the one I was supposed to find anyway[/spoiler]

• I'm quite disappointed it turned into a horror game. Building and teaching your own robot would be much nicer and may last longer. This way, I don't know who is its target audience - the first half for kids, the second one for those who like escape room horrors?

Quite polished looking, simple concept with games/escape room style things to work out, although these don't always affect progression. I finished the game with still quite a few unsolved things left. Took me about 40mins to finish the game, seen other people take an hour or two, just depends how much you mess around in it. 

The robot has quite a strong French accent, which combined with having a 'robot voice' made it quite hard to understand what it was saying at times, which is a shame, because I bet this is why I didn't solve some things as the robot gives you hints, but if you can't understand the hints, that's not going to help. Also some of the objects I was interacting with just flipped out which was annoying at times. 

But even with those few negative points, I'd still recommend playing it. I think it's priced sensibly which makes a nice change. Not a lot of replay value, but would be fun to demo to people and see their reactions.

Here's my playthrough if you want to see what's what:

Fair price
good graphics
interesting experience and atmosphere
puzzles
paced story development

cons:
Maybe should have launched as early access?
1 hour played, two game sessions. both game sessions ended due to bugs. 
Robot has a strong french(?) accent, it adds character but also makes him difficult to understand at times.
You interact with the environment more than you do the robot directly. 

Note: This gets a little creepy. Consider that a warning for the sensitive.

With a little polish and patches this could turn out to be really good!
