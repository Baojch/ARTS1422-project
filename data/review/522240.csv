Le but est pour chaque tableau, de rentrer toutes les boules dans les trous. Incroyable non ? Manette ou souris, c'est ultra intuitif, et le fun est immédiat.

La force de Pool Panic, c'est de proposer plein de niveaux différents, qui possèdent à chaque fois des boules aux propriétés différentes, ou des obstacles, ou des défis, ou des quêtes spéciales; le tout avec une direction artistique délurée et un design WTF. L'idée est clairement d'apporter de l'amusement, vite et fort, et ça fonctionne. On ne passe jamais beaucoup de temps sur un niveau, tout est super fluide, on enchaine le niveau suivant, puis le suivant, puis on en a fait 10, puis 20, puis 100, puis...

La map qui relie les niveaux est gigantesque, et après 5h de jeu, je ne ressens plus cette sensation de progression qui me fait avancer. Tout commence à se ressembler, et même si le gamedesign change constamment, et que c'est là le gros point fort du jeu, le gameplay, lui, reste le même, du début à la fin: taper dans la balle avec la cane.

[i] [Scene: The Cross Guild - Buggy's crew, joined by Crocodile and Mihawk, are gathered around a table with a computer set up. They're about to play Pool Panic.]

Buggy: Ahoy, me hearties! Gather 'round, ye scallywags! Today, we be embarking on a treacherous voyage into the digital depths of Pool Panic!

Mihawk: *raising an eyebrow* Are you certain this is a wise use of our time, Buggy? I have more pressing matters to attend to.

Crocodile: *smirking* Oh, come now, Mihawk. Where's your sense of adventure? Besides, Buggy promised us a rollicking good time.

Buggy: Aye, that I did! And what better way to strengthen the bonds of our cross-guild alliance than by plundering the virtual seas together? Now, let's set sail into the unknown!

[They eagerly start up Pool Panic, with Buggy taking the first turn.]

Buggy: *frantically mashing buttons* Blast it all! Why is me cue ball skittering about like a landlubber with a case of the jitters?

Alvida: *chuckling* Looks like your ball's got a mind of its own, Captain. Just like you!

[Laughter echoes through the room as Buggy struggles to wrangle his rebellious cue ball.]

Mihawk: *frowning* This is absurd. How am I to aim with these abominable controls?

Crocodile: *smirking* Patience, Mihawk. Adaptation is the key. Much like navigating the shifting sands of Alabasta.

Galdino: *nodding* Indeed! We must hone our skills in the art of Pool Panic if we are to emerge triumphant!

[As they progress through the game, they encounter a myriad of challenges and obstacles.]

Buggy: *frustrated* Arrgh! Why do these cursed balls keep evading me? It's like trying to catch a greased pig with a pair of buttered hands!

Mihawk: *dryly* A fitting analogy, Buggy. It's akin to attempting to snare a fleeting hummingbird with a net made of spider silk.

Crocodile: *smirking* Or endeavoring to tame a sandstorm with naught but a flimsy umbrella.

[They press on, encountering more absurdities and glitches along the way.]

Alvida: *laughing heartily* Look at that! Buggy's ball just got swept up and hurled off the table by another ball!

Galdino: *chuckling* It's akin to witnessing a circus performance gone awry!

Buggy: *exasperated* I've had it up to me eyepatch with this nonsense! This game be testing me patience like a plank-walking pirate!

Crocodile: *comforting* There, there, Captain. 'Tis but a digital tempest we must weather.

Mihawk: *smirking* Indeed. Let us take solace in the fact that our true prowess lies in the cut of our blades and the mastery of our Devil Fruit powers, rather than in the whimsical whims of Pool Panic.

[Amidst shared laughter and camaraderie, they finally close the game, grateful to have survived their tumultuous voyage through the tumultuous seas of Pool Panic.] [/i]

Before I break, I'm gonna rack 'em up and aim for the break! Smash 'em with power!
(Nice Aim!) 💥🎱

Though my shots are off, I'll put them to the test
Sinking every ball, I'll keep on trying harder
Looking to the future, I can see my best

[i] Ahem, gather 'round, fools, and listen up good,
For Mr. T's got something misunderstood.
It's about a game that's caused me much grief,
A game that's brought my anger to the chief.

Pool Panic, they call it, but it's a travesty,
A game that's got me feeling real nasty.
I tried to play it, give it a fair chance,
But it's got more bugs than a picnic in France.

The controls are wonky, the balls got a mind,
They move around like they're on a grind.
I'm Mr. T, I pity the fool,
But this game's got me feeling like a tool.

I tried to sink balls, make some shots,
But every time I tried, I hit the spots.
Not the pockets, no, but the walls,
It's like playing pool in the halls!

And don't get me started on the time limits,
They're tighter than my gold chains, gimmicks.
I can't even take a breath, relax a bit,
Before the game's like, ""Sorry, time to quit!""

So here's my message to the devs of Pool Panic,
Fix your game or face Mr. T's manic.
I'll be back, and I'll be angry as ever,
But next time, you better make it better! [/i]",1693992940,1711460879,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Es un puzzle de acción bastante bien planteado.

Si bien la mecánica de juego puede darte a entender que estas en un juego de billar, y ciertas reglas se aplican. Principalmente, tener que meter en la tronera la bola negra tras haber metido antes otro numero de bolas. Evitando que entre la blanca por supuesto. Hasta ahí llega la comparación. 

Cada uno de sus 100 niveles (no estoy seguro de si era esa cifra),  son diferentes, muy diferentes Cada uno de ellos te pone en una situación que requiere en un principio de que entiendas el entorno, que tipo de bolas hay presentes y pienses en que estrategia vas a seguir para completar el nivel. 

A veces será obvio, y otras no. A veces depende más de la habilidad y otras de pensar un poco más como haces tus tiros. Y todos y cada uno de ellos, desbordan imaginación.

No es porque las bolas griten y huyan de ti cuando vas a golpearlas, te troleen, o otras quieran devorarte. O haya bolas piratas, caballeros medievales, bolas moteras, bolas mapache que solo busquen comida tirada por el suelo, etc... Cada nivel coge la idea básica y la retuerce un poquito para darte algo nuevo.

Hay peleas sobre motos, escalada, un atraco a un banco, conciertos de rock, justas medievales… Darás vueltas en una noria, competiciones de esquí, te perseguirán bolas zombi... Este juego tiene un trabajo detrás que no es evidente hasta que no te metes a jugar en él. Y merece ser más jugado, y recibir más elogios. 

¿Que puede echarte para atrás? Lo primero que pienses que es un juego simple, que solo va de cachondeo para un rato. Error. O que pienses que puedes completarlo todo con la minga, y que va a ser sencillo, porque risas. Error de nuevo.

El juego puedes pasarlo más o menos bien, pero completar las condiciones que impone para cada nivel, a veces pueden ser bien jodidas de conseguir. A lo básico de no meter hasta el final la bola negra y blanca, se le suman el usar un numero limitado de tiros, meter todas las bolas y completar el nivel en un tiempo determinado.

Todo esto exigirá en algunos casos bastante esfuerzo mental, y una precisión en tus acciones que el juego no siempre favorece. Pero puede que sin darte cuenta, entres en esa dinámica con algunos niveles que te llamen más la atención. Depende del masoquismo de cada uno.

Hay algunos retos específicos en salas de billar donde otras bolas de billar te retarán para que te metas dentro de una mesa de billar. Un minigolf y quien sabe que otras idas de olla más. Estos suelen ser los retos más tecnicos.

Y tiene además coleccionables, niveles secretos, un extraño mundo sombra a lo Super Meatboy, y multijugador local con pruebas locas y especificas (no se como es, no tengo amigos). Mucho contenido en resumen, y a buen nivel por lo general.

Conclusión. Si quieres probar un juego diferente del genero puzzle-habilidad, te vas a llevar algunas agradables sorpresas con Pool Panic. Si además te entra su locura y su pulido diseño artistico, fliparás y te reirás con muchas de sus salidas de tiesto. Mi recomendación es que entres sin presión de terminarlo,sin pretensión ninguna, y te dejes llevar.",1654458173,1654458410,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You play as the cue ball in a game that very loosely follows the rules of pool, namely you are only allowed to pocket the eight ball after you pocketed the others.Besides that there are around 100 levels that have a lot of variety in creating different scenarios. Sometimes 2 or 3 levels have a somewhat similar setting but always with a little addition so in the end no 2 levels feel exactly the same. In most levels you can walk around while aiming at the other balls, and you can also push the other balls by walking into them. You can earn up to 4 awards in a level for beating them within a limited time, with a limited number of shots, pocketing all balls before ending the level and ending the level without faults (pocketing the cue ball or the eight ball before the required number of other balls were pocketed). Some levels were a bit harder regarding the awards but if you're not a completionist you don't need to worry about them at all, but for those who care I managed to get the ""Award Hoard 360"" achievement in less than 20 hours. I haven't got all achievements so far but if you like me were worried because of the low unlock percentages for many of the achievements, most of them are pretty easy, I guess just a lot of casual players lost interest before reaching the required levels. If you're playing the game casually and don't care about the level awards I guess it would take you around 6 hours or so to complete all levels.

Pros:
+ A lot of levels featuring a great variety
+ Awards for every level that sometimes require different strategies
+ Interesting artstyle

Cons:
- Overworld is pretty big, with little to discover between the levels besides the cardboard cutouts
- Physics can act weird sometimes which can be annoying if it screws your attempt when you're going after a more difficult award

And if this concept isn’t already crazy enough, there are actually so so many different types of balls, original themes and settings, be them historical like Wild West or Medieval, mundane like suburbs, camping, work places or in-house, sports like racing, skiing or climbing, or even the fantasy classics like the zombie apocalypse or the evil lab. I was honestly just astonished by the insane number of levels and ingenuity they deliver. None of the over 100 is the same, there’s always something new brought to the mix, or some weird new topic or mechanic, and of a quality, like, if you let your mind go REALLY wild and can imagine something, it’s probably already in the game. It’s sheer unbelievable.

Also, you probably guessed it meanwhile due to its sillier and action nature, it’s definitely no precision billiard game. The levels can get quite chaotic and hard to control, also the right angles aren’t always too easy to adjust. So better don’t expect to 100% it achievement-wise. No kidding, 3 of the achievements are kind of hardcore and probably only for masochists, especially the one for getting nearly all awards of all levels. Serious advice, don’t, just play for the slightly lower goal of getting around half of the awards, this way it’s still fun. Reason for that mostly is the time award of the levels, it’s so extremely short, really everything has to work immediately, and besides that also the minimum number of strikes often is very low. Anyway, if you just say goodbye in the beginning to those, your life will be much easier, I guarantee it. After all this game is more about the fun/experience, and honestly, it often got my mood up even when I was grumpy. Good party game as well, or to play together with your spouse, either one of the quite many Versus-Arenas or even in Story Mode (in this case of course not cooperatively, as there is no story coop mode), but alternately it’s still a lot of fun to compete who can master a level better. Even gets kind of addicting this way.

Long story short, a criminally underrated fun game, definitely deserves more attention in my view. So I’d really encourage to just try it out if you stumble over it in a sale.",1632449853,1632533550,True,12,1,0.677036821842193604,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Today i am reviewing the game Pool Panic. The game is based off billards but not necessarily defined in it's ruleset. As with games like what the gold and such, expect the unexpected. Basically you play as a white ball and go around a big map finding holes that lead to levels. Each level has goals that you can try to get, or play just for the fun of it. That is basically the whole game. Anyways, here is the pro/cons list:

PROS:

- More puzzler than billards game. You have to consider the angles and how many moves you use. Some levels also have various things going on in them to distract you too.
- Weird, weird, and weird.
- There are secrets.

CONS:

- Some things are left unexplained. I understand what they did here, but i would like to know things, for example, the stone monuments or the guys that follow you around explained.

Game is pretty easy to play, unless you trying to get all medals and achievements. It will take some skil to get those medals on every level. Recommended for puzzle fun, but be aware that some are quite hard.",1627527605,1627527605,True,13,0,0.648531258106231689,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Then, add trophies on top of it that you need earn to move forward, where to earn them you need to beat it in a short amount of time (the time they set is incredibly unfair and short for nearly all levels). There is also a separate trophy you need to earn by completing the level with a limited amount of shots. No one in the right mind would say this sounds fun, but this is what Pool Panic is about.

This game would have been an incredibly fun experience if it did not have a time limit trophy. The time does not pause when mid-level scenes are playing so you have to wait out until new balls you need to eliminate become available on a field, and with the default physics engine that Unity uses, the game just becomes incredibly frustrating as you have to rely on luck most of the time to beat them. There is only a single user guide written on this game, and even a veteran like the author of said guide repeatedly mentions how much luck is involved to just barely make it. The game mocks you by saying a controller is recommended to play this game, but what a joke that is. The game gets even more challenging on a controller.

What a waste of a game that would have been fun if the developer playtested this enough to set more reasonable time limits.

In addition, when continuing your only possible save, they spawn the buttons [continue or new game] all together in the same spot. The buttons then float around a little while they slowly move onto their positions. Just when you think they are done, they nudge slightly, making it really easy to click on the wrong button. They could have totally done away from it, or at least have the buttons disabled while the slow animations are playing. What a terrible UX design. You may often find yourself clicking on the wrong button (new game) and when you do, a ""welcoming"" prompt that does not even look like a warning sign pops up. For some reason, the developer thought it would be wise to put ""OK"" at the bottom while having ""cancel"" at the top, which is completely opposite of standard practice in UI designs. Once you make that mistake, your save is instantly gone, overwritten forever. The game writes on top of your save without creating a backup, or waiting until saving is absolutely necessary. Lack of Steam Cloud feature or save slots make this situation even worse.

An dem, wenn auch eigenwilligen, Grafikstil ist nichts auszusetzen und auch die Gestaltung der wenigen Level, die ich gesehen habe, war kreativ und hat mich angesprochen.
Der Grund, warum ich das Spiel nicht weiterspielen werde und auch nicht weiterempfehlen kann, ist in erster Linie die Steuerung, die, um es diplomatisch auszudrücken, gewöhnungsbedürftig ist. Gepaart mit den mehr oder weniger aufgedreht umherlaufenden Billardkugeln war es für mich eine Herausforderung, die Kugeln so zu spielen, wie ich es mir gedacht hatte. Zur Verteidigung sei gesagt, dass innerhalb der Spielzeit eine leichte Gewöhnung an die Steuerung festzustellen war – Spaß hat es mir damit jedoch immer noch keinen bereitet. Als wäre das nicht schon nervend genug, gibt es obendrein in jedem Level vier Ziele, die einem prominent ins Gesicht springen. Vor allem die knapp bemessene Zeit und die maximale Anzahl an Stößen sollen hier nochmal besonders hervorgehoben werden, da diese in Kombination mit der besagten Steuerung statt für Spielspaß für Frustmomente sorgen. Die Anzeige der Ziele lässt sich in den Optionen zwar innerhalb des aktiv gespielten Levels deaktivieren, der Konfrontation mit seinen eigenen Unzulänglichkeiten nach Abschluss eines Levels kann der Spieler aber nicht entgehen. Auch auf der alle Level verbindenen Worldmap werden die vier Ziele unter jedem Level angezeigt. Wer im Ignorieren dieser erfolgreich ist oder die Steuerung virtuos meistert, der kann an dem Spiel jedoch viel Freude haben.

- It's extremely playable - the replay value here it tremendous!

Pool Panic is a game developed by Rekim and published by Adult Swim Games

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Pool Panic overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a good action game to play in short bursts!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

- Time killer
- Cute artwork / theme
- Some clever levels and game mechanics

Cons:
- Auto-aiming controls are quite terrible. The dev making this game decided that whatever ball you aim at first is ""locked"" on and your stick sensitivity changes to only be able to hit that ball. So you end up fumbling with the controls way more than you should be. This CANNOT be turned off. Seriously dev dude, what were you thinking making your controls like this. Free-form aiming would have taken you less effort and made people want to play this game.
- Majority of the levels play the same; honestly, the game would be better if they trimmed all the low quality levels
- Challenges are moot
- Some levels take way too long to complete to complete the challenges (ex: skiiing)

The fresh and unique art style combined with unexpected mechanics twists pool in unforeseen ways. It looks like pool and plays like pool, but it’s not pool. This should be a killer combination. Yet, I get zero satisfaction from playing. I must respect Pool Panic for adding black privacy bars to an eight ball that just got out of the shower. Right!? I appreciate all aspects of the game, but it isn’t for me.

There are a few levels that I solved, which provided a rush of excitement. The A-HAH! moment that drives you to play the next level. For example, you need to turn off the shower to reveal a ball. That’s incredibly unique, also super weird, but it’s thrilling to play. Still, it’s strange that all the levels can be brute-forced, after all, you only need to knock all the balls in the holes. That means you can take a hundred shots to finish it, but the game considers the level complete once you tap the eight ball in. You don’t get any of the same feelings from completing the level. In fact, it’s depressing that you’re allowed to continue even though you failed. It’s driving me nuts.

I enjoy being able to continue playing even if I don’t get the perfect score, but it feels like I’m missing the point of the levels. When some of them only require one shot, and something amazing happens vs. taking nine shots to hit all the balls in one at a time. There’s a video sequence after a level to shame you. Pool Panic’s free form nature will not be for everyone.

Overall, Pool Panic is one of a kind. I had amazing moments that are tarnished by my failures. If you’re the gamer that will try a million ways to finish the level the right way, then go for it.

The game has the distinctive visual style of the Adult Swim universe, but for some reason, although the visuals would make you think the game is full of humour, it's strangely lacking in many cases. It's possible the scatter gun application and sheer number of levels has unfortunately diluted this aspect of the game.

Navigation of the world map lacks structure, but for those who prefer their games to have an open approach to tackling the levels will no doubt enjoy that. Others will be somewhat confused as to what to do next.

ビリヤードゲームのデジタルゲーム化というのは概して、
しっとり・一手ずつ緻密さを競う…そんな感じじゃなかったですか？
といってもそもそもそんなに数が出ていませんが、パッと考えてそういう方向にいくしかないですよね。

そこでこれですよ。プールパニック。
擬人化ビリヤード球が大暴れ。プレイヤーは白玉を扱うんですが、白玉も擬人化されているので好き勝手動けます。
なんなら、突かずにそのまま体当たりで穴に入れてもいいです。
そうそ、ルールに関しては普通のビリヤードなんです。周りの球をポケットに規定数いれて、最後に黒玉を入れる。
ですが…
なんと、すべてのマップ（100かそれ以上あります）がユニークなんです！！！
全体マップ上にはスキー場や西部劇？砂漠に遊園地、色々あって、基本的にその全体マップの背景を反映したステージとなります。
スキー場ではもはや別ゲー状態のスキーのタイムアタックをさせられたり、
西部劇ではガンマンになってもはやキューで打つ必要すらないです。銃で打って球をいれます。
中世世界では馬上試合もできます。
どこにいっても新鮮味がある、これ、作る方は絶対大変ですよ。使いまわしたいもん。
でもこのサービス精神が素晴らしい。
全体マップ上には解かないと進めない壁があったり最初からすべて回れるというわけではないものの、かなりのステージを最初から選んで遊ぶことができます。
自分の興味で遊びを選べるの、素晴らしい。

また、ステージには「クリアタイム・球入れた数・お手つき（白または条件未達成時に黒玉をポケットに入れる）」
の達成度に応じて金メダル～何もなしまであるんですが、もちろんこだわって狙ってもいいものの、別にこの個数はステージ開放に影響しないんです。
マリオとかだと、「あと幾つでステージ開放」とかあって悔しい！とかなりますよね。どこ頑張ろう？とか。
そういう頑張り全く要らないんです。

ステージも奥ほど難しいのかというとそうでもなく、結構どこにいっても楽しく、またステージによっては一発ネタで楽しませてくれます。

一周クリア時間は僕のプレイ時間くらいです。
もうボリュームたっぷり。

はー楽しかった。
子供が遊んでも楽しめる作りで、全く大人に媚びて無い、大人用のゲーム。
なかなかそういうの作ろうと思いませんよ。

I wish I can give mixed review. This game is cheeky, adorkable, quirky, and unique 8 Ball Pool game but also might not be for everyone, due to sometimes being frustrating with certain puzzles or lack of in depth story with characters. You have come to the right place if looking for something oddly interesting humour to try until it gets boring and repetitive.

It is a colorful and vibrant cartoon world with puzzle-like pool mini games. The vibe is like carnival + theme park + lalaland and not taking things too seriously.

If you are into silly human-faced with feet pool billiard balls with funny reactions, (scared ones running away if aimed, hot-tempered ones making an earthquake, purple monster ball trying to chase you and so on) you'll have a blast :)

The design is crisp and well polished but can be dizzy or bold for someone's taste.

Music is playful and upbeat. Nothing too fancy but it fits the environment.

Try to find all the hidden secrets :)

If you want some challenge, there is a tavern and hidden chamber with harder ones.

Sometimes you have to interact with the surroundings. Such as in the camp-themed level, grilling the hamburger patties and dropping them to lure the coconut pool balls. You have to quickly send them in the hole while they are munching on or they will go up again after finishing it.

There are many experimental and creative scenarios like you become the tag and have to push the balls around like sheepdog in the hole or being underwater poking blowfish balls out of the water and into the hole. Letting out the flying chicken balls out of the barn is fun too. Lawn mowing in the haystack with protective kitten balls is fun! If being a field commander and leading the marching band balls into the hole interests you, you can try in this game. Simply said, the devs did put some hours into the concept of game backgrounds :)

Controllers are recommended but it's playable with mouse too. I can kind of see someone might get annoyed when using mouse but it was no biggy for me.

No online multiplayer but local multi-player. I don't have real life friends so need online :(

I hoped the guy's voice from the trailer was in the game or some sort of dialogue with talking NPC. I guess sound effects would do.

Overall, you might like this game even if you have no clue what 8 Ball Pool Game is or have some basic knowledge. You might not like this if you are into realistic graphic 8 Ball Pool Game, sensitive to strong bold colors, don't like clearing out stage level style games, and derpy characters. It was out at Humble Bundle so I suggest maybe trade with someone or get on sale.",1563287200,1563288431,True,10,0,0.637043237686157227,0,False,False,False,False,,,

In Pool Panic you play as a billiard ball who's only goal is to hit the other pool balls into the holes. These games of pool take place across a variety of areas  including a wild western area, a city, a forest, and many more places. The gameplay consists of you hitting pool balls into the holes. These different pool balls each have different attributes. Yellow balls are alarmed whenever you hit a ball, zombie balls will infect you and the balls when touched, purple balls will slam the ground and cause the ground to shake, the 8-ball, while it performs like a normal ball, can only go into the hole after every other ball is in the hole. The art style is a really cartoonish and over the top style which I enjoy. The characters each convey a lot of emotion while only using facial expressions. The music while it is somewhat annoying is also music that I feel fits the game; over the top and fun. There isn't really much of a narrative till you get to the end of the game which is kind of a bummer. You're mostly just walking to levels aimlessly with your only incentive being to get the balls in the hole. The controls are also pretty subpar. You have to aim your ball using your mouse but I feel like it's too easy to try to aim for your shot but miss the alignment. Luckily, the game combats this problem by showing the path that you're ball will go in. While the mouse aiming is still pretty bad the path showing helps the experience a lot. Despite it's shortcomings Pool Panic is a great game with some flaws.

Jest spora liczba klasycznych prostych gier, które doczekały się fajnego dostosowania na obecne systemy. Mahjong, puzzle, pasjans lub saper od Microsoftu. To przykłady, że da się stworzyć coś fajnego (pomińmy, że są tam reklamy i opcja abonamentu) z tradycyjnymi zasadami, ładną grafiką i czytelnym interfejsem. 

Jak twórcy gry potraktowali bilard? Moim zdaniem przesadzili. Poruszamy się po świecie, który jest duży, bardzo duży. Z masą zakrętów i blokad. Poziomy są różnorodne: są standardowe plansze; mamy etap, na którym zrzucamy inne kule z pędzących motocyklów; gramy w gierkę, która polega na ucinaniu kawałków figury, starając się, żeby podczas tego nie trafić na poruszające się po niej bile. Poziomów jest sporo, ale to, czy będą wam sprawiać przyjemność zależy od tego, jakie macie nastawienie do kończenia gier.

Jeżeli jesteście perfekcjonistami i musicie zdobyć każde dostępne trofeum lub zakończenie, to radzę nie ruszać gry w ogóle. Za każdy (nie licząc bonusowych) poziom możemy zdobyć cztery trofea: pierwszy za wbicie do dołów (łuz) wszystkich bil na planszy (czasem do ukończenia poziomu nie potrzeba wbić wszystkich); drugi za ilość wykonanych uderzeń; trzeci w nagrodę, że nie popełniliśmy błędu i nie wrzuciliśmy ósmej lub białej bili przedwcześnie; czwarty za czas, który potrzebowaliśmy na ukończenie poziomu.

I teraz, dlaczego ta gra jest denerwująca. Po pierwsze sterowanie: blokujemy się często na bilach, na których nam nie zależy; większość plansz jest gigantyczna i trzeba stale trzymać przycisk, żeby oddalać widok podczas uderzenia; wskaźniki często błędnie opisują, jak poleci bila i wielokrotnie sami traficie do dołu zamiast celu. Najbardziej irytujące są jednak niektóre modyfikatory i specjalne wrogie bile. Czas ukończenia etapu, żeby zdobyć puchar nie bez powodu naliczany jest od początku. Większość poziomów jest dynamiczna. Bile mogą się poruszać, uciekać od ciebie, próbować cię wyrzucić, wychodzić z autobusu – wygrałem jeden etap nic nie robiąc, bo inne bile same wpadły!!! Jest to frustrujące. Są poziomy, w których trzeba najpierw podlać rośliny, żeby z nich wykiełkowały bile. Fajne? Nie, ponieważ po tym cała plansza jest w kwiatach i nie widzisz wskaźnika, czyli nie masz bladego pojęcia w jakim kierunku celujesz. Są etapy, których nie potrafiłem wykonać, ponieważ część bil była za ogrodzeniem, za które nie potrafiłem przejść i tak dalej. Twórcy przesadzili z mechanikami, tworząc czasami trudny do opanowania chaos.

Jeżeli nie zależy wam nam trofeach i chcecie pograć po prostu w coś „innego”, to możecie jeszcze przemyśleć zakup. Praktycznie każda plansza, to nowe mechaniki. Ale i tak musicie zastanowić się, czy jesteście w stanie wytrzymać kiepskie sterowanie i losowość w zachowaniu się niektórych obiektów.

Initially, you think you're playing a strange game of pool where you knock other pool balls in before potting the black 8 ball. Then you realise that the game is a weird and whacky game of pool puzzles, pot all balls, then the black ball and follow by the white ball but everything else is messed up. The main objective seems to be to complete all 100 mini-games to raise the tower in the centre of the map.

Gameplay-wise, WASD to move, left click to aim and shoot, right click to soft tap and Spacebar to highlight important information/use. Certain special hats will give you special abilities. Some maps will have special rules that you have to follow to complete the minigame.

Some interesting balls I saw were the iron grey balls which didn't move unless you timed them correctly. Green balls that moved only when food was on the floor. Yellow balls that ran away scared. 

You will face different encounters like biker gang pool where you have to knock off pool balls on bikes. Initially, I thought it was Road Rage.

Conclusion, do try Pool Panic. I am enjoying Pool Panic's whacky twist on pool. The gameplay is extremely interesting and the presentation of the different styles is just great.

Using a gamepad? LOL good luck, you slightly touch the joystick and your aim is all over the place like an epileptic kid on coke.
Oh and you want to unlock other areas then you have to 100% each hole which is impossible. 
It looks open world, it's not there are invisible walls everywhere. 

The animation looked so good it reminded me of SuperJail from Adult Swim but the gameplay is so so horrid. 
There are no walkthroughs because no one has beat the thing. 

There are different types of balls like ones that run away when aimed at, skate away when you try to hit them, and my most hated ones that pick you up and throw you off the map.

[h1]◇ ポールパニック！！ ◇[/h1]

盛大に読み違いをしていた筆者でもどっぷりはまってしまった本作[u]「Pool Panic」[/u]は、ビリヤードを題材としたスポーツアクションパズルアドベンチャー・・・あとオープンワールドで帽子収集ゲームでローカルマルチ対応で・・・あ、あと[b]ビリヤードをやったことがなくても全く問題ないゲーム[/b]です。[b]初体験時にキューで手を突いて以来ビリヤードを避けてきた筆者でも楽しめました。[/b]そんな感じです。
ひとつひとつかいつまんでお話ししたいくらいにはお気に入りのゲームなのですが、[strike]長くなりそうでめんどくさい[/strike]むしろあらゆる要素が詰め込まれたごった煮感がこのゲーム最大の長所だと思いますので、詳細は割愛させていただきます。[b]なぁにトレーラー見ればなんとなくわかる！[/b]


[h1]◇ 詳細は割愛すると言ったな、あれは嘘だ ◇[/h1]

[b]残念だったな、概要だよ。[/b]
おもむろに出てくるキューで手玉くんを弾き、規定数の的玉と8ボールくんをポケットに落とすのが目的です。[strike]まるでビリヤードみたいだ！[/strike]
しかしながらこの世界のボールは生きていますので、手玉は忙しく走り回るわ的玉は逃げるわのてんやわんやな乱痴気騒ぎが展開されます。
おまけにキャンプ場やバー、浜辺や観覧車の上でも熾烈な[strike]じゃれあい[/strike]攻防戦が止まらない・・・！
とてもビリヤードゲームとは思えないロケーションで繰り広げられる攻略パートですが、バカゲー一直線なわりにレベルデザインは至極堅実です。
トロフィー獲得を目指す場合はしっかりとロジックを組み上げる必要があったり、ステージ毎に特殊なギミックが用意されていたり、散々バカやりながらも頭を使わせてくれるという絶妙な調整具合に製作者さんの真面目さが伺えます。[b]バカゲー作ったのに真面目って言われるのは不本意だろうけど！[/b]


[h1]◇ ""ありがとう""って伝えたくて ◇[/h1]

[b]ごめんなさい、このゲームに向井理は出てきません。[/b]
最後になりますが、このゲームを購入する決め手となったのはひとえに [u]o.nigiri-19[/u] さんの[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198345826696/recommended/522240/] レビュー [/url]のおかげでした。冒頭でお話しした通り、[b]プールパニック[/b]だと思っていた筆者にこのゲームのアウトラインを示してくださった [u]o.nigiri-19[/u] さんにはこの場を借りて感謝の意を表したいと思います。[strike]バカゲーのレビューで真面目になるのも不本意だこれ！[/strike]
とてもわかりやすく解説されていますので、筆者のレビューが[b]ネタに走りすぎてわかりにくい[/b]という場合は是非ご覧になって下さい。

ワールドマップにも仕掛けがたくさんあり、歩き回るだけでも楽しい。

自キャラはテーブル内を自由に歩き回りショットの位置を決められるので、ボールを押し出すことも可能。まあ当然そのへんの対策はされていて、ボールに近づくとまっすぐ歩きづらくなるようにされている。これに気づかず、ボールの密集する場へ近づくと操作感がすごく悪いゲームと感じてしまうかもしれないので、一応ゲーム開始前に知っておいてほしい。

这虽然本质是个桌球游戏，把其他球打进洞，再打黑球就过关了
但这是个神奇的桌球游戏，母球是可以走的，其他球也是品种繁多，会走的，能飘的，放屁放地震的，

最重要的每关的玩法五花八门，玩了20关完全没有重样，每关都能感受到游戏创造力
如当牧羊人把羊全部赶进洞
如在沼泽地里把躲在木桩上的红球打下来引诱给大鱼吃，最后吃掉黑球变成洞
如把球打进洞会产生一条电屏障
......

每关有4个挑战目标
1.时间：这是最难的，不仅要规划个好路线，打的还要准不能够失误，而且经常会需要打移动的目标
2.杆数：正常打确实难，但有个邪道对大多数关来说其实挺简单的，因为母球是可以走的，你能慢慢把其他球给挤进洞（但是挤进洞不是那么容易的，母球的行走很怪异，碰撞体积也很小，有时候一颗球要挤1分钟）
3.不失误：母球不进洞，不能被一些怪抓住或各种死掉，这个也简单，稳点打就行了
4.全清：最简单的，有些关有躲着的球，仔细找找就行了
（目前看来好像并不需要同时满足4个要求）

游戏是母球在一个开放地图自由走动，到各个区域找关卡，地图中还有些隐藏挑战等

评论里有几个差评是给操控的问题，我觉得完全没问题，游戏是用手柄操作，确实瞄准有些困难，但这是挑战所在，轻轻松松一瞄就进洞还有什么意思

I am impressed by this game for a number of reasons. 
I originally had a complaint about mouse and keyboard controls on release.  The developer listened to this complaint, and in the most recent patch and beta, this has been fixed.  I've been playing it with improved mouse controls and it's completely playable and fun!

I'm also impressed by the scope of the game and creativity of the levels. It's quiry and much, much larger than I had originally expected.  It's a great cartoon-y billiards-esque game with quirky characters and unconventional game play. I like it a lot, and can reccomend it.

[游戏中你扮演一个嗜撞成性、见球眼开的母球，进入到桌球的世界中，去解决各种桌球谜题。]

简单玩了一下，基本上就是搞怪卡通风格的桌球解谜游戏，最大特点是你的母球可以随便走动……（所以应该算是动作解密游戏？）这一点不知道圆了多少人，每次撞杆时都直接把母球贴在子球前的梦。

除了母球可以走动这一最大特点外，子球也都不是省油的灯，基本上所有球也都会自己走动。普通的红球大多数是静止的，黄球会追着你跑，紫球（便秘球）如果在[strike]便秘[/strike]蓄力时受到撞击，会释放冲击把周围球震开，此外不同关卡还有形形色色的地形和特殊球。

解谜玩法可以说是小时候NES上的桌球解谜游戏Lunar Ball的革新版，一个一个地解开谜题。游戏中根据开场画面，大约一共有104个谜题（包括最开始的教学关）。每一个关卡有4个奖杯挑战，分别是耗时、杆数、完成度、没有失误，喜欢挑战的/OCD患者可以尝试挑战全金奖杯（应该可以一次只做一个奖杯）[spoiler]游戏中许多球都可以被你走动给挤下去，所以这个杆数的挑战非常好拿[/spoiler]。谜题也不是纯粹的解谜，其中还有很多搞怪元素等着你去发现（例如预告里那个照相人头板）

I've played about an hour of this game and here is my review.

Pros: 
- The art style is pretty funny
- It gives a little bit of humor into the game
- You have different characters of pool balls
- Walking around the map is like Cuphead

Cons: 
- The camera angles aren't that great when I want to look at a ball the camera zooms in for no reason leaving me to see not the ball.
- Sometimes when I want to hit a ball, my cue (pool stick) is going to get spastic and doesn't go the direction I want it to go.
- Setting up the speed of how the cue goes is pretty annoying because you need to move your mouse in order to set the speed up. And when I want to do that sometimes the position of me cue is going in a different direction (If you can adjust it with your keyboard it would be nicer).

The world's greatest pool game is finally here in the form of Pool Panic, a pool game where players control a sentient, walking cue ball. The game features some incredibly creative level design and a vibrant game world, but lacks in the settings department and has a few control issues.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]Creative level design.[/b] Pool Panic advertises itself as being ""the most unrealistic pool simulator"", which I would have to agree with. While the core mechanics one would expect from playing pool remain, each level puts some sort of creative twist on that formula. There are levels that have the player taking on completely different games, but with a pool twist. The air hockey level, for example, has the cue ball placed on the striker and is then moved via regular movement (WASD) or by striking it with the cue stick, making it slide much faster. Even with more traditional pool levels, there is always some small gimmick to shake things up. The game has over 100 of these levels (double that if you include the harder variants) and I was constantly impressed by just how creative they got.

[b]Vibrant game world.[/b] The game world here is easily one of the best I have seen as of late. The world is not only packed full of stuff to do, but filled with so much detail that it is honestly baffling. There are biker gangs, giant spiders, and houses adorned with cheese just to name a few. Much of this detail even ties in with the game's levels, with the three I named all having an individual level dedicated to them. The game world is also pretty big and is divided into several smaller areas. There is the forest area, the beach area, the medieval area, etc. Of course, levels are scattered throughout these various areas and all have traits unique to said areas. The medieval area, for example, has a level that tasks the player with jousting. I wish that more games would include such detailed game worlds; Pool Panic was really a breath of fresh air in that regard.

[b]Excellent ball variety.[/b] The creativity that went into the level design also went into each of the game's characters, most of which take the form of some sort of legged pool ball. The game introduces several variants over the course of the game, including some with arms, some that ride horses, or even some that take the form of animals. Each type has its own unique traits as well. The armed ones pick up and throw the player when he/she gets to close, for example. There are other types that run away when looked at, dodge to the side when struck at, or even cause micro-earthquakes when hit. The game even includes some bosses. This variety can lead to some pretty interesting level setups and it was always fun to see a new type introduced.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]Extremely lackluster settings menu.[/b] Upon opening the options screen from the game's main menu, the player is presented with four options: invert aim, vibration, mute music, and language. There are no advanced audio, graphical, or even control settings. I even poked around for some sort of text-based config file outside of the game and could not find one. The advanced audio settings I can do without, but the graphical and control settings are a must-have. This is 2018, all games should allow, at a bare minimum: window and fullscreen options, different resolution sizes, and completely rebindable controls, all being configurable from in-game. This is what one should expect from all new PC game releases, yet here we are. The game appears to be built on Unity, so [strike]I wonder why these options were omitted, as many Unity games require the player to go through a launcher before opening the game, allowing the resolution and such to be configured beforehand.[/strike] [i]Note: One of the developers has told me that you can in fact access the Unity launcher by holding SHIFT while the game is launching. This allows resolution and window options as well as control changes. [url=https://i.imgur.com/Hrn6Ljx.png]The control menu does need a bit of work[/url] (there are over 100 control options for things like ""analog 19"" and Fire3, the latter of which was not even used in-game), but at least the option is there.[/i]

[b]Annoying lock-on controls.[/b] I tried both controller and keyboard and mouse controls while playing but quickly gave up on the controller as aiming was a bit difficult, although not completely unmanageable. However, with both control methods, the game freaks out whenever the player locks onto a ball and then tries to maneuver the cue stick away from the locked-on target. At that point, it becomes very difficult to change where the cue ball is going and it definitely does not help that the game does not allow shots to be canceled. If shots could be canceled, then this would not be an issue, but as it stands I had to either avoid locking onto targets or be absolutely sure of where I wanted to go before taking aim.

[h1]Overall:[/h1]
Pool Panic definitely knocks it out of the park when it comes to creativity. The levels are fun, the game world is vibrant, and the ball variety is vast. Despite this though, the game does lack a real options menu and the lock-on mechanic can be annoying at times. Even so, I give the game my recommendation. It is easily the best pool game I have ever played.
