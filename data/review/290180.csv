This game has been finding it's way into my heart a little more. The easiest setting is enjoyable but results in a pretty quick run.

I spent a lot of time during the Early Access phase playing and playtesting this game and truly enjoyed how the game improved in all aspects over time.

[h1]Now for the fun:[/h1]
I played as a paladin. The paladin's voice is very satisfying to listen to. He growls motivational battleshouts as he and his mighty gnome army slay their foes. He throws arcane copies of his sword or shield with the attack button to damage enemies himself or commands his gnome minions to abide the pleasure of destroying Voldarr's evil monstrosities who are scattered all over the maps.

https://youtu.be/mqVgVH2MY5o

Along with enemies there were health and mana powerups to aid me in my quest, along with shops to power up the same stats. I gained experience from killing monsters, who also dropped dust, which is the magic ingredient needed to raise lifeless gnome statues into a powerful army of gnomes, ready for the destruction of evil.
After playing each map, which lasts about 5-15 minutes, I invested the experience I earned into character skills like health and mana regen or into the commanding skills to make the incredible army of gnomes even stronger.
The individual levels are connected through an overworld map where I navigated between the level entrances to choose where to attack Voldarr next. Each level has 4 difficulties that unlocked progressively as I advanced through the game's story and creeped into the more difficult versions of the levels.

Destroying various hidden chests throughout the game grants increasingly powerful armor and weaponry with varying stats. This made for a nice loot system to further customize my playstyle after pushing experience into my favorite skills. 
This can then be refined further because some bosses drop loot upgrading gems that increase the power of an equipped item even more.

This game also features really good voice acting, a ton of fun and multiplayer action for days. Yes you heard that right. Coop play on a single screen or through Steam's remote play together, you choose. 4 Players commanding 4 gnome armies killing 1 Voldarr!

I sat there enthralled in the story, looking behind the welcome text at the animation. I did not expect the graphics and effects - especially with the ability to spam explosion effects by hitting two left mouse buttons at a rapid pace - to be so welcoming on my laptop. I certainly was not expecting the game to - thus far - thwart my every attempt to break my character out of bounds, even at this early a stage. Yet, that is exactly what i got. A brilliant game.

Sure, the game is not without it's flaws, but that is EXACTLY why i am betatesting the game - to find those flaws and report those bugs, in the hopes that in the future, when the game is released, those bugs cease to be. And so, I know that the most frustrating parts of the game will be polished.

You would think that I would get angry after dying so many times on the first level, that i took so long to get past it. But frankly, i didn't care. I was having so much fun just running around, exploring the first level, and dying horribly to some flowers who just absolutely annihilated my weak necromancer. And that's how i realized, through a game tip, i could increase my character's health. It was pathetic... But it was hilarious and i loved it. I loved every moment of it. 

I look forward to betatesting this game further, when i finally get to level 2. I expect to have my weak necromancer die even more, and I expect to find even more bugs. But i also expect to have a great time while laughing at it all, reporting the flaws as I go.",1573805651,1573805651,True,18,1,0.535949170589447021,0,False,True,True,False,,,

This game however, at least at launch it not a ""twin stick shooter""  You move with the left stick on a controller, but the right stick does NOTHING.  Instead, you need to use the A button for your basic attacks and fire in the direction your character is facing.  ..That is NOT a ""twin stick shooter"" @ devs, just sayin'

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFpxzwl7BUU

Let me list just some of the reasons this game is an epic fail as I played it 2 days after early access launch on November 14th:

1) The game at launch has NO exit option

2) The assets purchased off the Unity store are glitchy, move glitchy and awkwardly as if the developers have no clue how to keep them controlled and not looking like they are trying to move in 8 directions at once and having convulsive seizures all over the place.

3) Pop ups and signs inside the game direct you do things like press TAB to direct your gnomes but it sends out a fire attack  (just one example of many)

4) Enemy shots and attacks sometimes seem to hit you but ""miss"" and clearly miss you but they hit for damage.  

5) The developers call this a ""twin stick shooter"" yet on a controller, the right stick does absolutely nothing at all.  That makes this game a definite NO on the twin stick shooter.

6) Everything you see in this game is just an item or character purchased right off the Unity Asset Store and sloppily placed into the game

7) The developers seem to have tried to cover up the games problems and buggy collision detection with lots of neon special effects, but it ends up just looking fake and ""cheap"".


You'd think with all the money that both Jesse Ridgeway (McJuggerNuggets on Youtube) and Keemstar (DramaAlert on Youtube) that they'd be able to pay a competent team of developers to make a decent game and not just what I call an A.R.S.M. (Asset Reliant Sloppy Mess).   What a shame because nobody enjoys a good twin stick shooter more than I

$5 is the asking price so let's keep this in mind of a small development team. 

The gameplay is easy to understand and controls are well explained throughout the levels, Some levels are a good level of simple and challenging as they go through the stages or ""Chapters"" of this game. The gnome recruitment is a brilliant feature which I think gives the game it's stand out selling point. 

Whilst the game is well built, I wouldn't say it is nearly polished enough for people to pay anymore than $5 - but the point is that this is fun, yes it has a few bugs and if you have a widescreen monitor, the text cuts of sometimes, but it's a great little hack and slash level up-er of a game and I think if you've got a spare $5 it's really not quite the disappointment I think a lot of people were expecting. 

7/10  - Great game-play, fantastic mechanics to make it unique, a few bugs and isn't quite graphically polished either, but nonetheless great fun.
