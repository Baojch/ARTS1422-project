When you play as a triceratops, you just eat plants and avoid dangers, with the latter becoming pretty much nonexistent after you've reached a certain size, and eating plants isn't very engaging.

Also, it's looking more and more like ""Dakotaraptor"" isn't a valid genus, so having a Dakotaraptor in the game would be like having a Troodon in the game (hardcore dino fans know why this is blasphemy for anything priding itself on scientific accuracy).

Anyway - if you manage to run this poorly optimised mess you'll be treated to a whole lot of nothing to do.

Why is this a positive review, you may ask? Because I happen to enjoy walking simulators almost as much as I love Dinosaurs. However....

The hunting is basically just running in circles and biting things until you spend around 2-4 hours on the game and become an adult, when you can hunt bigger creatures. If you're being attacked by a T-Rex(Which is pretty much the only naturally hostile creature in the game aside from a venomous lizard) then you can easily run away as it's probably one of the slowest creatures in the game.

The parenthood aspect in the game is pretty good although it does glitch sometimes when you're the Dakota-raptor, making your mate attack you and your baby.

First, all the creatures are exceptionally well modeled, and scientifically very accurate, in all their smallest details. Second, I feel I clearly experienced what it means to be a growing predator who has to survive and thrive in an unforgiving environment full of potentially deadly animals. You start as a hatchling who can afford just very small and harmless preys, but, if you have petience and manage to understand when exactly you can afford something bigger, you can grow up till the size of a mature adult, who can take down almost any medium-sized creature, and fear nothing but the largest animals like the Triceratops and of course the T-rex. This is not an action game, and does not offer a true goal beyond simple survival, but I had a great time with it, and I certainly recommend it to all dino-lovers who want to experience an entertaining adventure that is also totally up-to-date with respect to the most recent paleontological discoveries.

You can probably tell from my avatar that I have a bit of a bias for this game, but I'll try to be as fair as I can be. Firstly Saurian is far from finished, it's still in Alpha and that means the game is not quite optimized and weird bugs crop up at times. Despite the lack of optimization the game is visually stunning, each animal and plant is rendered in loving detail with regards to scientific accuracy, aesthetics, and readability in game play. Cretaceous Montana has never before been depicted in such a true to life manner, the only other form of dinosaur media that matches Saurian is Prehistoric Planet. It's refreshing to see dinosaurs depicted as animals rather than monsters.

The game play is relatively simple, you are a dinosaur. As such the objectives of the game are based on simple animal drives; finding food, staying hydrated, avoiding predators, and ultimately finding a mate to pass on your genes. There is no grander narrative or objective to the game. This simplicity combined with the games beautiful visuals lend a zen-like quality to the game and I think this game is best enjoyed in a manner similar to games like Abzu or Journey. This isn't to say that the game isn't violent or terrifying, but those things emerge naturally from the interactions within the ecosystem rather than out of crafted setpieces.

Before i speak, TAKE ALL OF MY NEGATIVE CRITICISM WITH NOT A GRAIN - BUT A MOLECULE OF SALT. This game is still quite worth the try, and is just in alpha and most of my criticism is just the bugs.
with that, ill start with the good bc it is genuinely quite good for an alpha.
I'll say, this game is awesome in terms of concept and models. I LOVE the dakotaraptor! I mainly bought this game for avian dinosaurs (at least, originally so. i have a habit of buying things on impulse from my hyperfixations and therio/kintypes lol) but i was pleasantly content with what i had bought!
I think this game has a bright future, and its quite a cool concept!
on the negative side, there are a lot of bugs, such as the raptor prey restraint.
It works ADEPTLY well! i love it a lot, makes me feel like i have a good advantage!
However, there is a bug where after falling off/killing a creature from RPR, your dinosaur goes at walking speed when running afterwards.
now, i cant remember what creature i attacked, but it lives in a herd and its attacks are pretty.. rough. two hits and you're out. which is why i planned on running. but, even with a good stamina, my run was stuck at walking speed, which, killed me.
now, of course this is very minor which is why i don't care that much about it and i know it'll probably be patched very soon. but what is almost unforgivable is that this game crashed my entire computer. I saved my game in an already made file while in RPR, then after a few seconds of circling and trying to get the thing's herd away, it crashed. I gave it a second, then decided to close it on steam. Didn't work. I later attempted to open task manager. didn't. work. Then, after a bit of pale screen, my computer attempted to shut down, which i obviously allowed.
this is probably my fault for being in RPR while saving, but then again, i shouldnt have to open task manager, or even shut down my pc just to fix a crash. 
again, though, i had very few problems. terrain could do some polishing, but (again) i am aware this is a very early build and it will obviously be fixed.
lighting had a weird bug where it flashed like minor strobe lights but it didnt affect gameplay.

Other than this, there have been basically no problems.
tldr: good concept, buggy, but bearable for an early build. had a computer crash issue, but i understand and forgive.

THE NIGHT SKY IS BEAUTIFUL BTW! i love the constellations!  :))))

I highly recommend, but be warned; this game is not 'easy'. It is difficult, and you'll need persistence and the endurance of a Tyrannosaurus in order to succeed as a dinosaur in ""the world's most accurate dinosaur simulator."" 
As a budding paleontologist and paleo-artist, out of all the dinosaur games I have seen and played; this is the most realistic, lovingly-created and satisfying by far. 

I recommend a device on the stronger end of the scale for a more detailed experience. I play this game on lower settings on a good computer, and it runs fine. Glitches are, to be emphasized, PART OF LIFE. Not to mention this game is not yet fully released. If you want perfection, I suggest the best gaming computer that money can buy. 

Return for purchase? Worth every penny. 

IMPORTANT: This game was made to be a realistic dinosaur simulator, a game where the player gets a chance to be a dinosaur. In reality, animals live not to have fun, but to survive, and to grow, reproduce, and fulfill their purpose. Nevertheless, this game is fun for me, and I agree with some commenters that there were areas where I just wanted a Tyrannosaurus to come out of nowhere to spice things up. But such is reality; further increasing realism of this game. This game honestly gives the best sense of fun that I have EVER come across in a video game. And I have played many video games. It is enjoyable, satisfying, and makes you whoop for joy for every growth stage you reach. Honestly? This game is perfect (albeit the improvements planned to be added) the way it is. I love how you feel alive in this game, in the best (and most adrenaline-powered) sense.

Para empezar, yo siempre he tenido fe en este proyecto, porque aunque los desarrolladores no han cumplido todas sus promesas, no han dejado de comunicar sus avances y es el único juego de dinosaurios que se ha tomado en serio aspectos como la naturalidad en la manera en la que caminan, corren o aceleran los animales, así como otros detalles como sus anatomías. Aunque su punto fuerte también es su punto débil, pues se pone tanta dedicación a detalles que casi nadie nota, que se olvidan de la jugabilidad.

En casi seis años el juego no ha cambiado mucho, tiene bugs, y además los NPC son tan estúpidos que en ocasiones son incapaces de sobrevivir por sí mismos. Otro problema es que necesitas una buena computadora para jugar bien. Para tirar más sal a la herida, la última actualización de tener crías deja mucho que desear, pues como ya dije los NPC son tan inútiles que tu pareja nunca sobrevive por mucho tiempo (y en consecuencia, si las crías siguen a la pareja, mueren también).

He jugado por 55 horas, y esa es la cantidad de tiempo que me tomó cansarme del juego, pero eso es sólo porque tengo una inclinación por juegos de simulación casi vacíos que muchos consideran aburridos...

EN CONCLUSIÓN: si buscas un juego (a veces relajante y a veces medio difícil) que simule la vida de un dinosaurio, esta es la mejor opción.

Well...because unfortunately I have a lot more negative things to say about it now. I am torn about whether I should change my recommended or not opinion because I do still kind of like the game if nothing else for its honest attempt to recreate an actual habitat that once existed. You know...instead of all those other dino games that just kind of throw things together with no research at all and forget plants evolve too.
A FEW justify it with a revived dino universe which works fine but now I'm side tracked.

The main thing I must acknowledge is...the graphics are worse. I don't know if something broke in the lighting or the textures or what but they don't look as good as they did when the game first came out.
The modles of the plants were given more varried natural looking imperfections but it feels like it was at the cost of a lot of other issues.

I know in the past the game struggled a bit on many devices but if you had a device that could handle full settings the game did use to look very similar to those epic early trailers. I can't find a setting to get it back to that look and it bothers me.

It COULD just be my terrible at tekness but other screenshots of the past vs. now contradict that.

The water. I once made a thread about it in the steam forum and I'm still convinced the current version of the water is simply not as good as the original version. I don't know anything about codeing and maybe the code was a cobbled together thing or whatever as the devlogs discribed it...but it looked BETTER then what they have now. The water is too blue for a swampland, the ripples on the surface are literally just a little effect on the surface when the old version actually appeared to react slightly to your creature moving through it. You use to be able to dip your camera in and when you came back up there were splashes on the camera. Feature literally removed.

I hope this game can eventually pull itself out of development hell because I do believe it started as a passion project that got screwed over and then they kind of started giving up on it.

Why is it still recommended from me? Well...I still think it's kind of cool. I still think it's not as boring as folks claim it is. It's not an action game, it's a sim.
Could it use some more stuff? Yeah. And I wish my nests didn't glitch if my mate dies. I wish said mate would actually DO something to protect the nest as well.
It has problums. It has a lot of problums.
Buut the shadow of that early game is still there and I'm still attatched to it. I wish they'd release a legacy version that was pretty much what it was before that foliage and water update stuff if they are going to drop the game as I miss what it looked like before.
That or maybe they could open modding to people if they have given up on it.

The game is realistic, has good graphics, and is based on science.

Unfortunately, the game has 2 fatal flaws that ruin it. First, the development is insanely slow. Saurian has the slowest development I’ve ever seen of any game. It took them almost 4 years to finally release a second playable dinosaur.

The other fatal flaw is the lack of dinosaurs. This is a dinosaur game. And yet, you can run around the map & hardly ever see any large dinosaurs. I’ve played the game for almost 1.5 years & have only seen one T-Rex. I’ve seen him several times, but seriously? There’s only one T-Rex on this large map? And only one time have I seen the T-Rex hunt. Every other time, he was walking back & forth like a brainless robot.

So it’s very frustrating & disappointing to play a dinosaur game & rarely see any dinosaurs. The map is pretty but it sucks to wonder around a lonely, mostly empty map. Therefore, I do NOT recommend Saurian in its current state. And with development so slow, it won’t improve any time soon. Maybe Saurian will be a good, worthwhile game in 1,000 years from now.

It has it's flaws, as it's in early alpha for years and it's maintained by small team. But detail put in every aspect of ecosystem, environment and great paleontological accuracy makes this passion project worthy to wait. If you want to see animals in their full majesty in their natural environment, then this game is for you. If you rather prefer seeing fighting monsters, then there's many other games that can deliver you this type of experience.
Pros:
-detailed simulation of how Hell Creek could look like long time ago
-lively, detailed environment
-pretty immersive elements of gameplay and interface - minimalistic HUD and tutorials restricted to bare minimum. You learn a lot of things by yourself
-paleontologically accurate depiction of various Hell Creek animals - from dinos to birds and gators
-gameplay varies of species you choose - you can either choose now solitary Dakotaraptor or Triceratops, which lives in social groups at each stage of it's life. Next playables will have other playstyles too.
-beautiful music made by XZICD, really fits and makes the mood of the game
Cons:
-a lot of elements lack polish, and not all planned animals are present, but it's expected from a game that's in alpha state
-little problems with performance (but it is also worked on)
-AI behavior can be sometimes really out of place (and again I am returning to what I said earlier)
-aiming mode is a pretty cool idea, but hard to learn. Personally I don't use it very much, since spamming attack can usually make the job

Generally, I recommend you this game, it's worth playing and waiting for next updates, but you should be patient. If you love paleontology, observing animals and you always wanted to experience how Mesozoic animals lived, then this game is definitely for you. It has some nitpicks and issues, but nonetheless it gives me a lot of fun and hype for each next update or devlog.",1665222029,1665222029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,True,,,

There are many things that need to be worked on though, such as better AI and more instructions to how to play the game. If your looking to buy this game and are wondering what it is about then a short description of it would be: 1. Whether you play as a raptor or trike, you start out as a baby and take around 3 hours to grow to a full adult. 2. Once you grow you have to leave your parents. 3. If your a trike you have to stick with a herd of others the same age as you, and if your a raptor you have to be alone while hunting for things like lizards, rodents, and turtles. 4. Once you become an adult you have to find a mate and nest in adorable babies. 5. You have to raise your babies to juveniles before they can leave to find their way. Now for some pros and cons.
Pros:
-Realistic dinosaurs
-Beautiful scenery and tons of plants
-An amazing flooding system
-Predators who only go after one prey and do not kill the whole herd
-Kind of good herding behavior
-Long gameplay
-Nesting

Cons:
-You need a beefy computer or it is either really hard to play or impossible (I haven't had much of this issue)
-There isn't enough instructions, even in the help menu so the game can be confusing
-Can get boring if your not watching videos while playing (Sometimes)
-Doesn't update too often
-AI walk in circles and sometimes don't follow you if your herd leader

Having played over four hours on one of the currently two playable dinosaurs (Dakotaraptor), I can say that yeah, this game is definitely still deservedly in the Early Access stage, but also it's already a lot of fun to play and explore, even with the bugs and other obvious cases of being a work in progress.

Rather than judge the devs on the time it's taking them to finish the game (which I see is the main point of a lot of the negative reviews), I'd rather focus on what the game actually has and if it's providing a fun experience for me, and it absolutely does. There's a bunch of different dinosaurs in the game, the Dakotaraptor controls feel good, the gameplay loop feels fair and strikes a good balance, being neither too trivial nor too punishing. The environments are fine for a low budget game and at some points actually very pretty, the dinosaurs look great.

The gameplay loop is, at least before you're an adult, prerty simple: eat, drink, survive. As an adult you can also form a pack/herd but I haven't tried that gameplay personally yet. There's a couple of reviews saying that once you're an adult, there's nothing more to do; but the most recent patch (at time of writing) added courting/mating and making nests for adult creatures, so the life cycle feels pretty complete now with the exception that you can't die of old age yet.

Yes, the game is still pretty unpolished in parts, but it would be dishonest to not put it into perspective: this is a reasonably priced early access title from a small dev team. I am hopeful for improvements in the future but the fact is that I feel like I'm already getting my money's worth from the game like it is now. You just need to see it for what it is; a passion project that is still in progress, made by a *very* small team, and not a polished big budget title with hundreds of programmers.

DECK: I played on the Steam Deck and it works nicely there. Haven't tinkered at all. I'm noticing some occasional slowdown while in busy areas but that's it.

TL;DR - very cool ecosystem simulation game about dinosaurs which look like how scientists currently think they did. Very obviously still in development phase and should be approached as such, but already fun to play.",1656669225,1656669225,True,37,1,0.811162710189819336,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Минусы и плюсы мне и раньше известны были, но всё-таки запустила посмотреть своими глазами.
В игре на данный момент всего два играбельных динозавра, дакотараптор и трицератопс, у разработчиков в планах то ли 4, то ли уже 6 (тут немного запутался, но вроде уже таки 6). Динозавров-неписей больше. На старте вас запузыривают выживать и расти в мир-лес, плюс игра старается быть в какой-то мере образовательной реконструкцией. Пернатого рекса только не заменили пока на новую правильную модельку (тут с достоверностью промахнулись), но он в процессе. Без оглядки на правдоподобность: пернатый рекс в любом случае очень клёво выглядит. :D

Разработчики понемногу шевелятся, что-то делают и апдейтят. Медленно, но на данный момент проект жив и не заброшен.

Я побегала, посмотрела. Подумала, пока что игру сдала, поскольку пока не могу просто по фану поддерживать кого-то и оставляю только то, во что реально буду играть. Сориан мне понравилась, но пока что всё, что она может мне дать, мне дают The Isle и Beasts of Bermuda.
Отдельно понравились ИИ-боты, которые наполняют мир. Ведут себя местами странно всё еще, что не отменяет того, что сделаны они очень красиво. 

Оставляю рекомендацию. Кому нравятся такие проекты, не вызывают кринжа долгострои и кто может/хочет — его есть смысл поддержать, у него есть потенциал, пусть и с развитием в темпе черепашки. Когда у меня будет возможность, скорее всего тоже выкуплю её обратно и уже не буду рефандить.

Second issue, the game runs like dogshit, I can barely keep 30 fps, I stay at around 25 fps constantly. I have a great PC, changing the graphics doesn't change the performance either.

Saurian is a broken shitstorm, which sucks because I saw so much potential in this game as millions of others did, that's just not being fulfilled.

Genetic variant skins, character customisation, spectator mode, dynamic environment events, post impact survival, new playable dinosaurs to take it from 4 dinosaurs to 6, multiplayer and VR support were all reached stretch goals when it hit $220k, which in hindsight is absolute insanity to believe especially in terms of multiplayer and VR.

It was a campaign intended to get the game to early access with the hope that it'd go big from there, that all the funding would pour in but it was never going to, it was destined to only be an extremely niche title, so full funding never appeared and it got turned into a hobby project as staff had to take on other jobs which came first to keep paying the bills.
While its a great idea to go for full and accurate scientific information on everything, its a project that never drew a line in the sand, with a company that vastly overestimated what they were capable of actually producing, its a case of overestimating capability and underestimating finances. If this was given to a larger studio with more staff in one or two locations for much better project management with funding that was measured in at least the low millions mark then we'd have a project that would be deliverable but as it is, its a project that will never be complete.
As it stands now, it could be another five years before development is finished, if not longer, and thats if the staff stick around, if they dont move on to better things.

CONS:
• Boring
• No real gameplay
• Nothing to do
• Ugly areas
• no goal other than 'not die'
• No tutorial

PROS:
• Pretty dinosaurs.

I've tried playing this game twice, and both times I ejected before I could hit one hour.

In short, there is no guidance (tutorial - you have GUESS what the hell to do), no interactions between the dinosaurs (playing, or fighting, or reading body language, ANYTHING that makes it feel like I'm a dinosaur other than the damned model) and nothing to do other than eat, drink and die. That's it. Fighting is stupid, the dynamics between herds are non existent. You can't play with your pack mates, you can't call to them to warn them about a damned T-Rex standing ten feet away from them. The AI is as erratic as I've ever seen (they keep running into water and then running back out for no reason, and if I don't stick close to their sides I'm kicked out of the herd - you have NO control), and apart from eating, drinking and dying you can, well, wander, I guess?

The draw distance is terrible, and this game has been in development for around FIVE YEARS with little to not change in gameplay.

- Pretty dinosaurs, i found the weather neat with flooding and drought
- The presence of AI Dinos is nice, something most Dino-games lack.
- Besides Dinos there is a large assortment of critters you can hunt to grow which I love!

[b]Neutral:[/b]

- No Toxic idiots like in other Dino games - since this is Singleplayer - so AI Dinos can be programmed to behave accurately
- Unfortunately lack of Multiplayer also means no adrenaline/being hunted effectively - an AI just can't compare to being hunted by a player.

[b]Con:[/b]

Kind of barebones - which was fine for me really but might put off others.
The Map is sort of mundane and not very pretty.
Also kept being harassed by other raptors that dance with me for 30minutes and i bite them 100 times and they are visibly hurt and play hurt sounds but eventually get 5 bites in to kill me, which kind of ruins the fun.
I dont mind having to fight or flight but other Dinos my Size shouldnt take this many hits to kill? 
Also I feel like a wounded Dino would try to flee eventually rather than keep hunting for me.

Dino Game Wise I'd rank this under Path of Titans but above The Isle and Beast of Bermuda.

[b]Suggestions:[/b]

- More Dinos would propably make people more inclined to replay
- Do balance or teach combat with other dinos better
- Refine AI a bit more - they path through water constantly even tho theyre bad at it for example - also smaller dinos should prolly try to flee more than fight?

low priority as the map does its job and is supposed to be fairly realistic - but making the map more interesting to explore would be good.",1641760634,1641760678,False,29,1,0.74439769983291626,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I want to warn people that the game evidently will not run functionally at all on certain systems with integrated graphics cards. Specifically, I am playing on a (purchased 2021) HP Envy 17"" with a current-gen intel i7 processor and built-in Intel iRIS Xe graphics. I can see from youtube playthroughs that others have been able to at least *play* the game but I have just spent the last hour of my life trying desperately to control my little baby dinosaur enough that I can, you know, play the game. 

It is absolutely impossible to play on a basic functional level on this laptop. It's not an ancient computer - again, purchased this year. Granted, it's not the best graphically but it was able to pass the Final Fantasy XIV benchmark test on ""OK"" settings for laptop, so it's not the worst in the world either and *can* play titles like that. 

What's impossible is that you simply cannot control anything. You can't. The turning - which I have mapped to the number pad because this laptop only has a mouse-pad and not a mouse - is akin to trying to turn the Titanic, or drive a dumptruck with cement blocks for wheels. Turn left and *eventually* the dinosaur kind of wanders slightly left. Turn right, it eventually sort of goes a bit right, but it's incredibly difficult to pull off a basic turn. 

Furthermore, the camera is a HUGE obstacle if you don't use a mouse to control it. Sure, you can SORT of point it here and there in an incredibly awkward way with a mousepad, but if something starts chasing you and you need to turn the camera as you run, it won't happen. ALL you need to do to fix this is allow us to map the camera to the arrow keys and invert the controls if we like. That will solve that problem. Let us map movement to the number pad and camera to the arrow keys and a lot of issues go away. I played Final Fantasy XI for over a decade on a laptop with no mouse and did exactly this, and it controls very comfortably. 

The other issues are what render the game impossible to play like this:
1) I could NOT turn (even though I had turning mapped to the number keys) while running, at ALL. You just can't. You have to come to a dead stop and SLOWLY - like trying to parallel park a dump truck - veer left or right. I ran straight into water and straight into other dinosaurs which promptly trampled me to death and could do NOTHING to avoid it - no matter which key I hit. 
You HAVE to be able to turn the camera, turn the ANIMAL, and run at the same time in order for this to work. Have to. Otherwise you have zero ability to evade predators, chase prey, or do much of anything other than very, VERY slowly toddle around and VERY slowly turn here and there. 

2) The dinosaur will frequently, without auto-run being engaged, just keep running and running and toggling it off does not help at all. You just keep running in a straight line until you get trampled, hit water or run into a tree. Again, because I could not turn at all while running, this also meant I couldn't EVADE anything or stop at all. 

3) The controls being as unplayable as they are did not stop OTHER dinosaurs from randomly running up and ripping me apart when I was a newly hatched Dakotaraptor and had no ability to fight, turn, or evade in any way. You are a sitting duck. If you walk the whole way you can kind of slowly turn but the moment you start trying to run, it will KEEP running (yes, I made sure the key to toggle sprint  / auto walk was NOT being hit - it just does it anyway). 
One suggestion: Players need some manner of basic protection as they get used to the game. Don't just throw them into the world and say good luck - the pack or herd should ideally act as a defense and there should be no predators running in to gobble you up the moment you are hatched. That may be what happens in nature, but this is a game - games need to be enjoyable - and that means not being murdered for simply existing and trying to figure out how to even turn the damned thing for an hour. 

4) The HUD bars are completely non-intuitive and there is zero done to instruct the player as to what they mean and what to do about it. This is what tutorials are for, or ""beginner areas"" with prompts that help you through a bit. Otherwise you have to just figure out that green is evidently related to food intake and the others something else. 

5) Related to #4, eating anything is horribly difficult. Easy enough to figure out that the ""bite"" key will also allow you to drink, but as a Triceratops, you do what? Walk around in the plans hitting the same key and hoping you MIGHT eat something by chance as the green bar drops lower? Eventually by randomly hitting the ""bite"" key as I walked through the foliage I was able to somehow replenish my ...food? I guess? Hunger? I can't tell. There's no instruction in-game to tell you what plans you can and cannot eat and how to eat them. 

A good SOLUTION to that would be to simply have some text pop up to show you and maybe, as with some other titles, if there's a certain KIND of plant, in ""scent"" mode it can have a yellow or blue aura around it to indicate that you need to eat that. Same goes for carnivores. I ran around as the Dakotaraptor hatchling and could NOT find anything small enough to eat. Not one lizard, insect, nothing. I DID however get randomly out of nowhere attacked by a larger Dromaeosaurid - perhaps a sub-adult Dakota (hard to see with the camera and all) and then later randomly dropped DEAD out of nowhere with zero warning because, I don't know, reasons (probably hunger since I couldn't find any food). 

It needs to be readily apparent where the food is, how to eat it and how to acquire it. Otherwise you are desperately trudging along hoping you see something you can eat as a Dakotaraptor but never finding anything but death. SOLUTION: small lizards, insects, mammals should be detectable using the SCENT command and while in that mode you should be able to ""see"" a trail with a color that corresponds to that thing (mammal = blue, lizard = red, dino = yellow for instance, with something special to indicate this is a trail that will lead you to more of your own kind - as it is, the random sparkles are not useful information). I think oddly enough the Batman: Arkham games show you well how a special mode like this and things being ""highlighted"" should work. That concept would work well here. That would ALSO allow you to SEE the small prey if it's hidden beneath the leaves, since there is no collision detection with plants and that means there is no movement in the plants to betray the presence of a scurrying creature. I HIGHLY suggest trying to implement something to that effect in order to make the whole idea of scenting things ACTUALLY functional. Distinctly colored trails or ""footprints"" visible while in that mode, each corresponding to a type of animal, and when it is in visual range, in scent mode, there should be that color outlining their bodies. If you can pull that off, it's a huge step forward in making this into an actual game. 

6) The world is very, very EMPTY. There were no prey to be found as the raptor, which quickly becomes a problem when you need to eat. It's also very hard to find more of your own kind (again, I HIGHLY suggest figuring out a way to implement the above suggestion regarding auras and tracking scent trails or footprints). It's the start of the game. Drop the player in an area that has insects buzzing and lizards scurrying here and there and everywhere. Or at least implement the improved scent mode I suggested above because by DOING so, all the player needs to do (hopefully you at least have a prompt telling them to hit, say, S for scent mode so they aren't mashing random keys) is go into scent mode and BOOM! Look! There's a TRAIL of scent leading to a lizard, and it's even red so you know it's a lizard, and the game event TELLS you as part of the tutorial section of the game!

Начинаю играть за дакотараптора, называю его Кекес.
Детство у дакотарапторов было непростое, зато весёлое. Можно лазить по деревьям и сидеть на ветках, как здоровая совень с зубами. Но на земле острожнее надо, ибо любой динозавр мог тебя случайно раздавить, приходилось охотиться на мелких ящериц и меловых крыс, ну или можно попробовать рискнуть закусить палеосанивей (тот ядовитый moodeela), но если дашь укусить себя - ты труп.

Через время Кекес подрос. ""Ну вот сейчас будет добыча покрупнее!"" - мысленно обрадовался юный дакотараптор. Увидел чампсозавра (мелкий типа крокодил) на берегу и подумал: ""ну ща те крышка, мелочь зубастая!"" Действительно, чего бояться, он же такой мелкий по сравнению с подростком дакотой! А не тут-то было, Кекес был убит одним укусом. Ну, не судьба. Загрузившись, продолжил Кекес бегать и жрать ящериц. Случайно попался на пути соразмерного ему орнитомимида. Умер от одного случайного касания. Штош, будем обходить их стороной.

И снова подрос. Почти уже взрослая морда! Да такому большому пернатому красавцу уже никто не страшен! Жаль только по деревьям уже не полазаешь. Зато можно смело жрать средних динозавриков. Но на этом этапе появились новые неожиданные враги дакотараптора - баги мелового периода. Яд палеосанивы стал практически не опасен для большого дакоты, но эта хитрая жЫрная ящерица припасла секретное оружие против большого раптора - баг камеры. Прыжок ей на спину теперь ломает к чертям вашу камеру, заставляя её сначала неистово прыгать, а потом бесконечно опускать её вниз, в самый ад, за все издевательства дакотараптора над бедными ящерками и крысками (баг решается перезагрузкой сейва... до следующей охоты на ядовитую moodeelu).

Достигнув взрослого возраста и став опасным сильным охотником, Кекес начал проявлять интерес к окружающему миру и принялся наблюдать за другими динозаврами. Вот, например, анатозавры - большие, мирные утконосые динозавры, которые не обращали никакого внимания на бегающего рядом дакотараптора. Казалось - они не тронут Кекеса, пока тот не решит сам напасть. Так бы и бегал Кекес рядом с анатозаврами, если бы только один из них не коснулся дакоты кончиком хвоста, убив его - Кекеса. С тех пор Кекес за километр обходил любого крупного динозавра, ибо любое случайное касание даровало мгновенную смерть.
Но это далеко не последний сюрприз, ожидавший Кекеса на его пути. Однажды, он, бегая по большому чистому полю, решил закусить очередной палеосанивой. Осмотрелся - никого нет вокруг. И только Кекес приступил к трапезе, так прямо из воздуха появился тираннозавр! Пришлось драпать, пока вместе с добычей ти-рекс не решил закусить и дакотой. Видимо, и сюда приложил руку Спилберг, решив, что тираннозавр в перьях совсем не страшный, и, чтобы добавить в него ужаса, при этом не ощипывая, дал ему умение телепортации.

На заметку большим хищным динозаврам - никогда не гоняйтесь за Кекесом. Несмотря на все сложности [strike]багового[/strike] мелового периода, он всегда найдёт способ выкарабкаться. Однажды, когда за ним гнался тираннозавр, Кекес, спасаясь, подбежал к паре уже дерущихся ти-рексов. Тираннозавр, гнавшийся за кексом, решился переключиться на ту парочку и стал третьим. Тут из леса выходит 4-ый ти-рекс и включается в драку (в принципе, этот случай прекрасно описывает ИИ НПЦ во всей игре). Месиво из хаотично двигающихся рексов, клацающих зубами, выглядело забавно. Правда Кекес так и не узнал, чем закончилась драка, так это длилось слишком долго, и нашему раптору пришлось уйти на охоту. Правда, через какой-то момент один из рексов промчался мимо Кекеса, не двигая ногами, как по льду, и укатился так куда-то за карту. Слухи о том, что динозавры изобрели баттл рояль, оказались не слухами.

Итак, какой вывод я сделала, поиграв в Saurian:
1. Меловой период - самый багнутый период за всю историю Земли. Вероятно, метеорит в конце просто оказался самым главном багом, с которым динозавры уже не смогли справиться.
2. Дакотарапторы - чертовски хрупкие динозавры, несмотря на свои габариты (5,5 метров в длину, вес около 150 кг).
3. Тираннозавры имеют сверхспособности.
4. Деревья были частично или полностью нематериальными, что помогало бегать динозаврам сквозь них при погоне или побеге.

Покупать не рекомендую на самом деле (баг на баге багом погоняет, управление и механики это боль), просто не могла не поделиться охренительными приключениями дакотараптора.",1635960432,1635962327,True,3,4,0.541109025478363037,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The AI is virtually non-functional, the gameplay feels lackluster (eat, sleep, explore, have bby, genius and inspired...), audio design is incredibly weak, practically the only good thing in this game is potentially the design of the dinosaurs, which just isn't saying much for a video game. I'm sorry- graphics just aren't worth anything if the gameplay is not developed.
And rather than making any plans on how to expand the gameplay and fix the AI, the devs are instead developing new dinosaurs to play as. I feel as if I am in the minority here, believing that the addition of the T-rex won't bring anything but disappointment to the table, since we're still limited to exploring a world filled with horribly-controlled bots.

Just saying, if any fellow animal-nerds were hoping for a creative Wolfquest-inspired game but with Dinos (that is, a fully realized game supported ENTIRELY by factual/realistic depictions of animal life), this ain't it. More of a showcase of the environment and designs for the animals.

The game play is straight forward and the tutorials clear enough most people could just jump in straight away and enjoy themselves, I feel.

The world and animals are not only gorgeous, but also based in lots of scientific research which, I personally appreciate. 

Some critiques i do have that I think would make the game better, are to possibly make some of the animal turn controls a little sharper, as you usually end up needing to make wide turns to do most things. And to add a free camera you can use to move around your dinosaur and take screencaps without it moving it's head in your cursor direction, just cuz I like to take artsy dinosaur pics for fun and, I unno it would just be a nice touch 😅

And lastly, perhaps perfectionism is getting to the team, but they have a pretty slow update cycle, n has been in early access for like what, 5 years?? I feel that keeping people engaged with new features and playable animals holds just as much weight as scientific accuracy so, even if things start off with little flaws n bugs, it'd be nice to see more progress coming from the developers.

Игра конечно ОЧЕНЬ СЫРАЯ, но в нее можно поиграть, если очень хочется)

Плюсы игры:
1. Неплохая физика динозавра. 
2. Достаточно понятное и удобное управление (есть поддержка джойстика)
3. Обилие NPC делает мир более населенным. 
4. Нет проблем с едой и водой (это вообще не проблема здесь).
5. Вас не убивают в первые секунды игры, есть возможность адаптироваться к игре. Также в игре есть автоматические ""чекпоинты"", что позволяет в случае поражения не начинать с самого сначала, а респавниться и продолжить изучать мир.
6. Многообразие видов динозавров в окружающем вас мире.

МИНУСЫ:
1. Окружающий мир очень небольшой и однообразный. 
2. Невидимые стены на карте в 2021 году просто ""убивают""!!!
3. Тени в игре сделаны просто УЖАСНО! 
4. Мало выбора, выбор всего из двух видов: трицераптор или полуптица какая-то... 
5. Странные (волосатые) тирексы, которые крадутся к вам как кошки, не издавая ни звуков, ни криков. И которых кстати можно побеждать (одно из развлечений на карте именно поединки)
6. Непонятно где ЛЮДИ, а где NPC. И есть ли вообще здесь другие игроки? 
7. Нельзя выбрать сервер или карту. Просто нажимаем играть и играем на одной карте. 
6. Плохая прорисовка локаций, очень однообразная, особенно небо и освещение сделаны просто ужасно и примитивно (самые устаревшие технологии, что я видел в играх)",1632341684,1633229859,True,0,0,0.484496146440505981,1,True,False,True,False,,,

This was four years ago now; the game STILL does not have a single playable dinosaur with complete life stages. Both Dakotaraptor and Triceratops are playable, albeit in an incomplete state. Tyrannosaurus is unlikely to be released this year, and Pachycephalosaurus may as well have been scrapped. It would be one thing if it took the team a year or two longer than expected to meet all of these stated goals, but there is no excuse to be this far along in development with not even half of what was promised.

Saurian. If I'm correct, you're here to decide whether or not you should play this game. Well, before you decide, just know that I've only marked my review positive so as not to harm the game's chances with yet another negative review. Because honestly, for this game, I'm not sure whether I think you should play it or not. So for this review I'm simply going to state some good and some bad, and let you make a decision for yourself. I played this game over a year ago, and after a long break, I came back and tried it again. So what lies before you is my fresh, up to date notes on the current gameplay experience.

One thing I find pretty pleasant about this game is the environment. The assortment of trees and ferns, the colors, the day and night lighting, as well as the various AI scattered about really make the atmosphere immersive and realistic. The music is also unique, original and enjoyable, somewhat reminiscent of Minecraft. The tense instrumentals during night instill a general sense of unease on your first few nights. Then in the morning, you're greeted with more pleasant music, celebrating the dawn of a new day.

Two things about the environement, however. The map is pretty, but the graphics are sub-par, unless you have them on the maximum setting. In addition to that, every time I turn the camera to see behind me and then try to get back on course, it causes the game to freeze up and lag for several seconds, and doesn't let up even after the game has been running a while. This, as you could imagine, leads to issues. I have a fairly high end gaming computer, and even with that I had these issues. 

Moving on though, I'll talk about the dinosaurs themselves a bit. There are currently two playables; Dakotaraptor and Triceratops. You are given the options to name your dinosaurs, choose their gender, and adjust the difficulty, day and night settings all before starting a new game. You also can have multiple saves, so you could try every combination you want, and not have to delete a character. 

The game does little in the way of explaining the mechanics if you've already done the tutorial, which made replaying the game a bit tricky for me. What I'm including in this review is only my experience playing Dakotaraptor and Triceratops without the help of in game tips, if they exist.  

Trike's gameplay is easier than Dakota, in my opinion. I've always enjoyed herbivore gameplay over carnivores, so I settled right into Trike's play style. You spawn as a little baby, protected by a couple of adult trikes, with also a few nest mates. Usually the first hour or so is pretty boring, just getting food and water and looking out for danger, while staying near the nest. However, the first time I played trike, a T-Rex killed my mother in front of me within five minutes of being spawned, which was terrifying and also heartbreaking. In most circumstances where your herd mates are engaged in combat, you are helpless to save them, and I really did feel sad whenever one of them would die and I was too slow or too weak to save them. 

Things don't change much as you grow. Once you reach juvie, you are no longer grouped with your parents, and they leave, so you're left with your nest mates. Juvies can group with sub adults and other juvies, and adults can group with only hatchlings or other adults. So you follow your herd around and look for food and water. The trikes move very slowly, and constantly stop for food and water. They also seem to go on some kind of imaginary path only they know, only following YOU if you run ahead and continuously kite them in the direction you want to go. Otherwise, you have to stay back and let them lead the way. 

The social system is the neatest aspect of trike gameplay to me. You have a menu that shows you all of your herdmates, their health and stats, as well as their reputation in the herd. You have a reputation as well, and can upgrade it from 'neutral' to 'trsuted' and 'esteemed' by warning your herdmates of potential threats. Once you warn your herdmates about a specific species, they will automatically attack those species whenever you come across them. This is how I lost most of my herd. They for some reason don't have as much health, and they aren't as maneuverable as the player so they tend to just stand there and take damage until they die. However sometimes they do come in clutch, such as while fighting T-Rex. 

All of these things are great, but it gets repetitive quickly, so I imagine it's not for everyone. 

Dakotaraptor, however. Starting off as a hatchling, you are given a group that wanders in a straight line to water and does nothing to help you find food, so it's necessary to break off and fend for yourself, as hunger drains fast. The only thing you can eat at first is small lizards, usually guarded by a bigger lizard, Paleosaniwa. Those will hurt you if you get bit, and thus far I haven't found a way to kill one without getting bit at least once, and dying consequently as a result of the venom. The game tells you that eating and drinking will help the venom, but both times I tried that it led to death, as the venom just slowly chips away your health until you die. It's worth noting that I was only a juvie when I attempted it however. I never made it to adult in the hour that I tried playing, because I kept going for the paleosaniwas when I was hungry and couldn't find anything else to eat. I simply got frustrated with dying constantly and waiting for the game to load again, and gave up. I have no doubt that it's possible to grow to adult, because I remember doing it once when I first tried the game. But it definitely is restrictive only being able to eat small lizards. Paleosaniwa's venom needs a nerf too. 

I've decided to reply Saurian because I've seen that there's been a bit of work done on the devlogs, and I'm still interested in this game's progress, despite its flaws. With all that being said, it really does feel like a realistic game to me, and I think with some tweaking it could be truly fantastic. 

I simply wanted to share my experience to allow anyone considering buying Saurian the chance to see a more in depth account of what to expect in the game.",1629326402,1629326402,True,54,0,0.829075515270233154,0,True,False,True,False,,,

• World feels empty/hollow.
• No Multiplayer yet after 6 years.
• Gameplay gets repeatative/boring quickly.

If you're looking for a realistic dinosaur simulator, this game would have been a really good option, but after years and years in development I can no longer recommend this game to anyone.
Not only does this game run poorly if you don't have a decent setup, the overall gameplay gets very repeatative and boring quickly after you've fully grown your dinosaur.

There is no real ""end-game"" per say. You grow up and then you're in a cycle of just eating/drinking and running around. There's nothing else to it. It was fun for the first 30 mins-1 hour, but then it just falls flat.

The environment is pretty samey-samey, meaning there's no real huge change to the map, even if you run to the edge of it. Some places offer a bit of variety but it's not huge.

The worlds feels empty since there's not many AIs in the game currently. No distant sounds, and the ambient noises are on a repeat loop.

Overall I give this game 3.5/10, just for the lack of content after all these years of following it's development.

Whether it's due to it being a misguided passion project that's lost direction or because whoever's in charge just needed a good old-fashioned egotrip, it's not worth your money.

Any realism in the models is lost completely to how badly the map layout and mechanics look and operate, the geography is boring and unmemorable, and there's no real atmosphere outside of some very basic light/fog filters that barely do anything and look like hot garbage. It doesn't really matter if the models are as realistic as possible and the leaves are fully rendered in 4k when the gameplay mechanics are so jarringly non-immersive that any realism is lost. I wish they hadn't bragged so much/gotten so stuck on the look of the models and whether the game was 1000% scientifically as accurate as possible, because you can feel how much the more important factors of the game (like whether it was fun to play or even playable at all) got thrown to the wayside (and were seemingly left there).

Gee, how convenient. Who the hell doesn't notice that an amount an amount OVER that of the initial goal, such a large chunk of the pledged $220,709, was made inaccessible essentially right after the Kickstarter-funded phase of the project began. What group of middle aged adults that claim to be ""industry professionals"" falls collectively for such a ""contract"" despite having ""legal counsel""; and this over-saturated cadre of college graduate industry-experienced developers have no doubt had to (correctly!) interpret and even negotiate legal documents in their own self-interests in the past. Saurian devs might just be some of the worst liars on the planet. It's up to you what to think because this is obviously my outsider [though I do in fact work in the video games industry if that matters lol] opinion, but I personally am done watching this project after learning what I have. Yikes.

Because even if they're 100% telling the truth [doubtful with the amount of furry art one of the devs commissions of his fursona], who could trust such easily mislead devs with, say, network security when multiplayer rolls around (if ever)? I wouldn't even trust them with website purchases of merchandise at this point, because what the hell else are they ignoring back there... Also funny that, getting the art book out for an unfinished game was suuuuuch a huge rush compared to idk, development. That was some abject fucking clownery lmao

And so, I still can't recommend this boring, empty, ugly Unity game. I thought by now it was going to be an accurate survival game with at least four different fully playable species, plus some form of multiplayer interactivity, but it's still just some barebones Dakotaraptor gameplay and now some extremely basic Triceratops gameplay. The game itself is full of frustrating unintended behavior involving both gameplay and UI elements. The vaunted AI that they theoretically spent so long programming is completely brainless in practice, constantly breaking any sense of immersion especially during combat. The assets themselves, especially shaders, have aged terribly. Updates are still nonexistent and the devs somehow seem to say less and less with each devlog, which isn't encouraging at all on top of all the other crap...
0/10 human incompetence simulator featuring dinosaurs

BRUH EDIT: 2022 is nearly over and what do you know, Robert DePalma himself ended up being a scammer too. 'Dakotaraptor steini' was so incorrectly described by him, his 'fossil' actually contained turtle and T-Rex bits, amongst so many others that it's practically a fake made out of every animal in Hell Creek... that is to summarize, the real life scientific basis for one of the only playable animals in this game actually got blown up this year. Some of the data actually came out as early as 2016 and was seemingly ignored; to be fair this game was a scam early on perhaps [judging by how a dev 'ran away with' so much money so quickly after the Kickstarter ended], they claimed to be always changing things to be accurate then ignored all the whispers, which grew to shouting, about DePalma's fraud. People tried to warn them about the dubious taxa as early as 2017 and they freaking ignored it, I'm so done you guys. There is a big dromaeosaur somewhere in Hell Creek, but it's surely not a 'Dakotaraptor' as it was described.

Followed it for quite some time and to this day adore its premise and well intended devs. That said, this game’s early access development has been utterly disappointing.

To simply put it the game barely updates with anything substantial and just isn’t fun. I wasn’t by any means expecting the game to be finished within a short frame of time or anything unrealistic for a small team, however we are now four years in development with patches now being several months apart and it still barely feels halfway finished. The gameplay hasn’t changed or advanced since launch and gets rather dull and repetitive extremely quickly and no amount of playables I feel is going to fix this. Ideas are there but aren’t touched up on or developed further after implementation. Combat and hunting can be summarized as trying to kill with dino grabber sticks that constantly phase through another. Stealth is pointless when you can outrun your prey/predators and they have nowhere to go, become disinterested in the chase/being chased, or get stuck spinning in circles forever. I could go on and on but the main thing is the whole experience feels half-baked, especially with performance that is flat out bad with constant hitching, dipping frames, and a broken lighting system that looks incredibly primitive and legitimately causes nausea in my case. At this point the whole thing begs for major overhauls in every aspect for it to stand out, look good, or even play entertainingly.

Credit where it's due, the music is very nice, most models look great, and the custom foliage, while static and non-interactive, really adds to the uniqueness of the world the game is set in. Again I cannot emphasize enough that I wholeheartedly enjoy the merit this game sets as a piece of educational entertainment and want it and the devs to have nothing but the success I feel they deserve, but unfortunately my enthusiasm and optimism has tragically flatlined and any good faith towards the early access period has now long run its course. I’m just disappointed, and with the news that the (now former) project lead embezzled $75,000 from the Kickstarter I feel especially duped. The worst part in hindsight is while most other titles on steam with similar settings of prehistory and its creatures are window dressing for a video game, Saurian and its devs clearly show how much they care for the subject matter and put effort where no other dev ever would, but just appear to haven’t a clue how to make a fun game out of it. Needless to say I'll be waiting for this game to exit EA before I ever consider revisiting/reinstalling.

I wish the devs the best of luck in their endeavors, and will see y’all whenever the game is fully done.

The positives:

- First off, I love the general concept of the game and think I am squarely in its target audience. I wanted a reasonably realistic single-player dinosaur survival game and that’s what’s Saurian aiming to be and I am glad I bought it. I also admire the efforts of this small team and their dedication to realism, this is undoubtedly what I like most and makes the game worthwile for me. It’s amazing to prowl the wetlands of Hell Creek in the morning, on the hunt for unsuspecting prey. It’s a dream come true for me and I suspect several other paleo enthusiasts.

 - The technical aspect is also fairly impressive. Hell Creek looks great and so do the dinosaurs. The game runs fairly well on my mid-range PC and I only encountered minor bugs. The real-time growth of your dinosaur is simply fantastic. Hats off to whoever designed that effect. Your animal not only grows in real time, you can never quite put your finger on any drastic change. And yet growth stages can be drastically different from each other. The lighting is also particulary impressive.

- The overall “basic” gameplay works fairly well though some actions could be more precise. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it does the job just fine. The UI is kept minimalistic and I think that’s a great choice.

The Negatives:

- The main problem with this game as it is right now is that it’s empty. Really empty. This isn’t good for immersion and leads to boredom. I grew to adult several times, and was never hunted once. I also rarely encountered other animals, and when I did it was also usually the same few species. This is a shame in a game were “visiting” the ecosystem is such a large part of its appeal. I was never hunted by anything other than “crocodiles” and even then only when I was pretty much stepping on them and thus there was no real tension. That means that all I have to do as a Triceratops is eat, drink, sleep and stay roughly near my herd. The game pretty much plays itself and there’s not really anything to to but take in the sights. As a Dakotaraptor hunting is a bit more involved, but thanks to the simplistic mechanics not all that exciting either. I will say that it’s okay for an adult and subadult as you can challenge yourself a bit and there is some diversity of prey. As a hatchling or juvenile, prey can be very, very rare. This makes looking for something to eat an annoying chore as you nearly starve wandering through empty forests and wetlands. One of the few animals you can eat (and this may be the only one you encounter) is a lizard with a very potent venomous bite. Attacking it is very risky and not really advisible, but sometimes you have no choice. If you can’t find any prey, you can try to scavenge something a larger predator killed, but that’s also rare. Growing into a subadult fixes this as there is a larger variety of animals you can hunt, so you won’t starve and can find your prey at a reasonable interval.

- Understandable in its early stage, but the gameplay is fairly bare bones and limited. Don’t expect any complex mechanics. This once more makes the game quite repetitive.

Conclusion:

Overall I love this game’s vision and respect and admire what this team is trying to accomplish and escpecially their dedication to authenticity and accuracy. This really is a dream game for me and I hope they succeed. And while I do wholeheartedly recommend it to people who appreciate its concept, there isn’t much content as it is right now. It’s very much a work in progress and I wish the developers the best of luck.

Not to insult the developers, unless this falls through or becomes a scam, but they seem over fixated on small details that no sane person would care about during the early development of a game while neglecting aspects that would improve player enrichment and the games longevity.

- Played as Raptor for 1,2 hours. Stopped after reaching juvenile stage and dying before taking 1 step because I got bitten once somewhere 5 mins before.
- Spent 30min trying to get out of the lake during rain (you swim very slowly), 30min getting oneshot by the very few dinosaurs, 20min staring at the blank loading screen.
- What the games needs most is 1. way more development for better and new features and 2. a proper tutorial to explain what you can actually do in this game.
- My goal for playing this game was just killing and eating stuff. I was not able to do that.

Pro:
- Great potential - dinosaurs are cool
- Graphics are decent enough

Contra:
- World seems empty most of the time
- Long loading screens
- Gameplay is very limited and barebones
- Combat is vague and barely working (right-mouse button locks you up making it useless)
- No explanations how to play, leaving you either with nothing to do or giving you tips that are directly contradicted by the gameplay (e.g. Raptor cannot do jump attacks and will die from poison no matter what the tips might suggest)
- Performance is bad which directly affects gameplay: Low FPS aside, combat requires a lot of turning around to keep up with enemies, but the lighting keeps glitching out (moon goes on-off, water appears-disappears depending on looking slightly up or down) and the game itself freezes up a few seconds because of it

It was a hard choice to not recommend this as I think it is very unique in the sense that it has extremely arcuate dinosaurs and plants. Only play this game if you don't care about video games and just care to see some nice 3D models and animations of dinosaurs designed with the most up to date paleontology research. The gameplay is boring but realistic, and the AI is not terrible.

This game is a neat experience, but I can't see myself playing it for more than a few minutes. It is not worth $20, it should be at most $5 if not free. It gives off heavy vibes of a high school student's indie unity tech demo project and not a full game, but this could be because most of the team's funding has been towards dinosaur research and making accuracy over quality and quantity. I would have given this game a much higher rating if it wasn't for the price of the game.

I would have never heard of this game if it wasn't for [url=https://youtu.be/pG5sbVN3tI8]Ben G Thomas[/url], and honestly, I kind of miss my $20.

Вообще, симулятор динозавра - довольно спецэфический жанр. Определённо, Saurian - это игра, с которой ознакомиться должен каждый, кто любит этих удивительных рептилий из далёкого прошлого. Довольно простой механизм управления, пару часов освоиться - и можно спокойно играть. 
Графика на уровне, хотя есть, куда расти. Удивительно, но на слабом компе не пытайтесь поставить высокое качество - иначе будет слайд-шоу.
Звуковое сопровождение тоже радует - особенно интересна ночная тема, которая держит в лёгком напряжении.
Что стоит добавить в игру? Ну, во первых - кровь и мясо. Трупы убитых животных должны видоизменяться с каждым откусаным куском. А то получается, что раптор жрёт воздух. А потом труп магическим образом исчезает. Далее, надо менять систему спавна. Это нифига не круто, когда в паре десятков метров ПРЯМО НА ГЛАЗАХ в воздухе материализуется стадо трицератопсов и других динозавров. Особенно поразил один момент: я пытался убить пахицефалозавра, а тут заспавнилось стадо эдмунтозавров. И они меня тупо забили хвостами. Лучше сделать определённый радиус запрета спавна - хотя бы 200 метров.
Ещё не мешает добавить мини-карту. С некоторыми отметками - например, самой высокой точки в игровом мире.
И сам игровой мир бы увеличить в пару-тройку раз.
И бонусом было бы здорово добавить антинаучный режим - суть его заключалась бы в том, что на карте можно бы было встретить динозавров из разных эпох. Интересно бы было столкнуть в битве аллозавра с тираннозавром. Кто-то скажет, что есть The Isle, но я отвечу - там только мультиплеер. А ценность Saurian как раз в сингле.
И да, дайте тираннозавру уже нормальный облик, а не это чудо в перьях. Уже ведь были исследования, доказывающие отсутствие перьев у этого динозавра.",1614542325,1614542325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

[b] Positives: [/b]

This game is a good simulation of real life dinosaurs, including the vegetation and landscape from the corresponding time period. Additionally, they include a menu option with a booklet that provides further details and analysis about everything, even the different plants. This is a lovely little detail.

Movements, models, and animations are smooth and fluid with very detailed features. Dakotaraptors can climb trees and each of their feathers have a jiggling effect, and the different life stages of the playable classes flow together seamlessly.

[b] Negatives: [/b]

The first version of the game was released in 2017 and since then, there have been minimal updates. There are still only two playable classes, and updates are infrequent, occurring every one to two months or from year to year.

The content of the game is quite minimal, consisting of the usual eating, sleeping, and growth mechanics that you repeat until the next level of growth.

[b]At first, only the Dakotaraptor was released, and they added the trike in 2021.[/b] Giving the game two playable species takes time, but since its release in 2017, this game has gone nowhere. Over the years, the hype for the great dinosaur game has completely died out.

I have been involved in this game since I supported it on Kickstarter, but it honestly feels like the game has not progressed at all since I obtained it. I might come off as brusque or hasty, but it is hard to invest more than three hours into the game as there is very little content and all that one can do is reach adulthood and be done with the game entirely. It is simply a lacklustre survival game that requires you to Eat, Drink, Grow into the next level and repeat the same process.

I have mixed feelings about this game in its current state. Once it reaches the level it was meant to, I will give a more positive review. For now, however, I must honestly advise you to save your money for something else.",1613882168,1676635363,False,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,False,False,True,False,,,

First of all its showing dinosaurs as animals, realistic balanced ecosystem. The updates are rare and i can agree but the development is very well active, every month we see more and more progress for this game and gets me more and more excited even if i know that the new stuff late to be released i am ok with that because i have patience and i understand how hard it is to make a game as realistic as possible...i mean they even remake whole stuff and even the environment itself rare updates are expected. Only two playables for the moment and Tyrannosaurus is in development along with the nesting system that will come out soon this year the animals are only two but are so unique in their own way, in every other game you ask everyone which is the best dinosaur, stats, abilities...here this is not the case, dakotaraptor is unique because of the raptor prey restraint and the climbing and gliding of the baby so even as weakling you find an interesting gameplay, triceratops has this amazing herd system and all these changes as it grows its so satisfying. Other than that, this game is something you can play for just half hour a day or 2 hours or 6 no matter how much free time you have and this is amazing as in other games like the isle i need to have HOURS of free time which is rare, not because of growth time but because the way the game feels like.
People say AI is bad but i disagree, its way better than any other dinosaur game, they show so much life other than just walking randomly and running away from you, they are social with each other they have the same needs with a player and they dont hunt if they are not hungry, they sure need more work but they are nowhere near as bad as the other dinosaur game AI.

However keep in mind those:
You need really good pc and graphics card and all that kind of stuff. My PC is really good and i can play on max graphics with 80 plant loading distance but if i put it at 100 the game crashes so before purchasing mind this stuff first, espeically if you dont want to have low graphics which do not look good at all. Second you need to be absolutely sure you want very much realism...there are people who complain about triceratops controls and the movement is slow yet its a 9 tons animal how do you expect it to be fast and turn quickly like a dog?

This is all i have to say...i have 114 hours in total and i really do not regret buying this game at all especially now that the development is faster than 4-5 years ago or so and im really excited about the upcoming Tyrannosaurus playable and nesting mechanics. I enjoy this game more than even the isle and path of titans because its as realistic as it gets without being multiplayer with rules, instead the game itself forces you to be in a realistic world.

Saurian is a high graphics dinosaur game which focuses on your survival in a harsh world from 65 MYA. The game looks great, has good mechanics and pretty nice Dinosaur/Creature designs. 

However, there is little to be in Saurian. As of now, the only playable creatures are Dakotaraptor and Triceratops. Now would be a good time to mention that this game is progressing at a snails pace and will not get into too many places at the current rate.

However, what it lacks in playability, it makes up for in challenge. Saurian is admittedly a reasonably hard game compared to others. Growing can take a while and there is a lot which wants to kill you. Finding food as a carnivore is also a problem, and not looking out for large Carnivores can get you in a rough position.

The AI in this game is also decent. Dakotaraptor will attack you as soon as you become a juvenile. The Socialism mechanic is also interesting, as you can now scare off or attract other creatures. Creatures know when to run, fight or follow which is also cool.

The Dinosaur models and designs in this game are, without a doubt, very good. The Dakotaraptor especially stands out.
However, the Tyrannosaur model is by far the worst. Thankfully, there is another model which is currently in development and will be added soon. You can see this if you look around, and it looks like a vast improvement.

Overall, Saurian may not have much to do but it is fun if you enjoy yourself a good challenge. The graphics are great, AI is great, Models are good, Mechanics are amazing, and is Pretty accurate as far as current paleontology goes. The game is however updating slowly, but im confident the game will get there eventually.

Since they're already charging money for it, I have to rate it based on what's currently available (because who knows how far it will get before the devs stop working on it - we've seen tons of games abandoned in EA), and that's why I'm giving it a thumbs down.  

My suggestion to the devs if they want to improve this game is to take inspiration from a game called Wolf Quest:  Anniversary Edition.  Yes, that game is set in modern times and models real wolf behavior, not dinosaurs, but it's effectively the same core game (an animal survival sim), and in particular, WQ's smell system is way better than Saurian's (seriously guys, steal their smell system and put it in Saurian).

Other changes I would suggest:  
1. GREATLY reduce the rate of hunger decay - we should not be starving to the point of losing health in one in-game day, and what's more, hunger should not be decaying more quickly than thirst.
2. GREATLY reduce the rate of thirst decay - same reason as 1
3. Improve friendly AI and/or implement a ""follow me"" social command to prevent AI herdmates from doing suicidal things, like going for a swim right next to a crocodile.
4. Is 3-6 the realistic herd size for Triceratops?  I feel like that's way too low (especially since in my case, all three were male).  If it is, then okay, but just three juvenile trikes setting out on their own seems like an easy meal for any number of predators.
5. Dakotaraptors are way too fragile compared to similarly sized NPC critters.  Why is it that, as a juvenile Dakotaraptor, it takes me 25 bites to kill the similarly sized, two-legged herbivore critter (I have no idea what it was called), but it only has to hit me once to kill me (from full health, no less)?  I mean, if I went up against a T-rex or an adult Triceratops and that happened, I'd be perfectly fine with it (in fact, I'd probably be pissed if it didn't).  But this little ostrich-like critter had no obvious defenses and was clearly no bigger than my juvie raptor.

I was a kickstarter backer and had really high hopes for the game. So it really pains me to make this negative review. But this game really feels like it is dead walking. Its development goes at a snails pace. Its gameplay after 3 years of development is shallow. Three years ago the devs said it would take a two years to get out of early access with the four base animals. Now here we are three years later and they've implemented only one new animal (for a total of 2) and its neither polished nor interesting.

But that's not even all. There are stretch goals us kickstarter backers hit by funding this game 4x more than its goal (They wanted 55,000 and got 220,709). A few of these goals were adding 2 extra dinosaurs, Multiplayer and Vr support. But they took money we gave them and they must have mismanaged the hell out of that. Or maybe they didnt plan it well at all to begin with. Maybe a combination of the two. I lay awake at night wondering just how far this game would have gotten if we hadnt funded it OVER 4x its goal and instead gave it the minimum amount. 

I'm not saying this game cant be good. I'm not saying it wont ever be finished  But I'd be lying if i said if I said I honestly thought this game would be completed in a reasonable time frame.. if at all.  Im also not telling you not to buy this game. But if you do, youd better be sure you are in it for the long haul and wont feel bad about throwing your money to the wind and hoping for the best. 

Now go... Go and make your informed decision. God knows I wish I had the chance you have.

I know you want to make it realistic but there is something here missing that's not making it either fast nor efficient. I can name you a few other games with the same or better quality that have been popping out in the time Saurian existed: The Isle, Beasts of Bermuda and Path of Titans. One has 2 more years than saurian but is more of a jurassic park battle royale with lots of updates, the other two appeared in the last 2 years and already got 10 times more things than saurian, including paleontological accuracy, even though they are also in ""alpha"". There have been little to no updates, it feels like devs dont really care about the quality of their simulator and there are no prospects of this getting any better. I dont regret spending money on a group of people willing to develop a simulator game based on actual real information, but this one failed to deliver.

This game is dead.

I was one of the people to help this game come alive on Kickstarter, and that was before the game released here on 2017. Playing as a dinosaur? Who wouldn't want that! Watching the game development logs and such got me really excited for when it would be released on steam since I hadn't pledged enough for test builds to play.

And then it was released! Of course it was buggy, but such is life. I was bummed that my old laptop couldn't handle it, but my new one could. The graphics were amazing then, and the gameplay felt good. AI was...interesting, but it didn't break the game, I think. You could still play the game at it's core, but that the game wasn't finished was very obvious.

Now with that in mind, the last time I'd play the game, before the RECENT Triceratops update was December 2018. *2018* The new dino update came out in October 2020. That's almost two years without a major update. There were bug fixes and such, I'm sure but to add more gameplay? It's been a long, long dry spell.

Playing it after the long break, the graphics are still amazing to look at. It does require a pretty good computer to run it, so be warned of that. The AI/NPC intelligence is still very much lacking. Playing the raptor, your parents will still wander off and die and playing as the Trike, your herd will walk around in circles (my family herd would NOT get water because they wouldn't ""leave the herd"" so they kept walking back and forth til I grew up old enough to leave them by which they despawned.). It's a mess, but it's still in development, so what can you do.

Do I recommend this game? No, not at this time. But that's coming from me, someone who has had the game for a while. It may be new and exciting for people who haven't played it and haven't been waiting for as long as I have. But for me? I cannot recommend it right now. I'll edit this, or write a new review as more time passes.

The game had some optimization issues from the start, even the lowest graphics could barely run on my decent PC (where as games like the Isle or Skyrim could run at medium graphics with no stuttering at all). The movement was weird, AI behaved weirdly, and a lot of mechanics didn't work, but hey, it just released! I was sure it would get a lot of updates!

They put a lot of effort, research, and heart into this game, so I'm not going to say that I regret purchasing the game because I don't, honestly.

It's been in early access for about 3 years now, and still has only a single playable dinosaur species. There is nothing to do in this game.

The devs stall by adding an update every few months doing something tiny and insignificant like re-texturing some plants, but that's about it.

By the way, unless you have a £2k+ dedicated gaming PC, the screenshots you can see on the store page are absolutely nothing like what your game will look like when running at a playable frame rate. If you have a PC that is more than a few years old or is lower end, you will not be able to run this game in a way that will be playable, even at the lowest graphics settings.

I also can't get the pouncing to work right, not sure if its user error or glitches. You can also clip straight through some trees and some of the animations look a little weird, like when I eat the food will float next to my mouth instead of hanging out of it.

If you're a fan of accurate dinosaur games, I highly recommend you get this game and support the creators.
If you're weary because of the lack of updates, then join the Discord, which you can find on their website or by just searching 'Saurian Discord', as I did. If you ask about it there, I'm sure someone will respond.

I myself was weary too, after seeing the bad reviews recently, and already getting a refund for one game I ended up not liking, but I can say that, despite only having one dinosaur to play currently, this game is well worth it, especially if you manage to get it on sale, which I didn't, but I don't mind.


Now, onto some features of the game, too;
The Encylopedia is a very nice feature, with everything in it unlocked the second you open the game, before even making a save.
The models for this game are beautiful, and amazingly realistic and seemingly as accurate as we can get. The sound design is also great, with the music (while I don't have it on myself), adding to the ambience even more.


It really is a great game, and, in my opinion, it doesn't deserve any of the negative reviews it's getting. The game hasn't had any updates, sure, but the devs are working on it, and, remember this is their first game too, and its beautifully done, to the point where I though it had to have been a third or fourth game.

I read several of the comments, and took note of the ratings, but still went in with an open mind. I'm both a software developer, and someone that has worked in Unity, so I understand the delays that can occur in development. The most important thing I noticed is that the developers still regularly communicate with the community, and are still posting updates.

Going into this game with the mindset that it's still under development, I can forgive the optimisation problems and lack of features. What matters to me is the core mechanics and atmosphere. After playing for over three hours now, I have to say I've really enjoyed it.

Saurian makes you feel like you've stepped back 66 million years. The atmosphere is fantastic (especially the music). I still remember the excitement of getting my first kill as a hatching (it was just a fish, but any food will do when you're hungry!) One of my favorite moments in the game so far was after I went on a long trek into the bluffs. I discovered an ankylosaur (but avoided it, because I was just a juvenile Dakotaraptor). After failing to find any food, I slowly began to starve to death. Just as I resigned myself to my fate, a random Acheroraptor ran right past me. I lept onto it, and pinned it down. It kept me fed for a while.

The game is filled with lots of fun moments like that. If you've ever wanted to be a dinosaur, if just for a few hours, give this game a shot.

SE~NO-

Saurian has a unique playstyle for dino games - most of them are online games and this one puts a nice play on it having it be singleplayer. The AI are a bit dumb, but hey, it's a work in progress. As much as I enjoy the Isle and Beasts of Bermuda, there are certainly times in those two games that I just get mindlessly slaughtered when all I wanted was a drink of water by people who are guarding said water. It doesn't happen on Saurian. 

Right now there is only one dino to play, and that is the Dakota raptor. Being a Juvi is rather fun, and I was surprised by the mechanics and small little critters available to eat, and if you want the real ""isle"" experience or as close as you want it to be, their is a realistic mode on which where you can only save on sleeping/growth or on quit, and your save is deleted on death. I've been playing it that way and it's been quite a run of trial and error that I have enjoyed. Climbing trees as a juvi Dakotaraptor and just chilling on tree branches to avoid threats was really fun, jumping from tree to tree and gliding around.

Becoming an sub adult took that away, and replaced it with a fun pounce mechanic that isn't like Evirmas ""pounce and you're off within 1 second"" mechanic, having you actually press LMB and RMB to maintain your raptor's balance in order to keep up the latch you have on them. It can enable you to take down what you'd think is more than you can chew, such as trikes if you're careful enough. 

However I could argue the game is currently lacking a ""hook"" for you to keep playing, having only one dino available. I would like to play a trex, or perhaps a pachy(which i'm glad are as fearless and sassy as they are in the game). I crave more content, and I can see this game has some major things going for it. 

in conclusion (tldr version):
- The game is good, mechanics are fun
- However, it is currently lacking for its pricetag of $19.99.
- It is visually pleasing;  the music is rather nice, making it a little scary at night in the beginning.
- There are many critters to kill or challenge, from small lizards to the mighty t-rex. 
- Part of me wishes that their were more calls, but it is nice that the intimidation call (F) actually works and scares things away.

I'd recommend this this game when you see a sale hit it, or when more content comes - but if you are an avid fan of dino games like me, it's worth a pick up.",1594516655,1594516655,True,9,0,0.629067599773406982,2,True,False,True,False,,,

In this game you get to 'think' and 'feel' what a dinosaur would have actually felt. This means this is not like 99% of all other games where you are always looking for something to do or how to have a laugh with your mates - the negative reviews for this game likely come from that kind of expectation.

Instead this game is more like a solo meditative experience where you get to exercise your most primal instinct and focus on basic things like hunting, finding fresh water, defending your territory, learning how to kill larger prey, and admiring nature perhaps a bit like in No Man Sky.

While playing you should not worry about doing silly things like attacking large dinosaurs for fun but should worry about things actual animals do. When playing the game I find myself looking for large prey that will keep my stomach full for a while, improving my raptor running agility skills and exploring the map looking for better hunting stops like an actual raptor would. Sometimes after catching a good prey I sit next to it (to protect it from scavengers) and look at the moon and stars for a long time listening to the rain - see, this is the kind of thing this game offers, it's not your typical flashy gaming experience.

Admittedly this game still needs more development and it can become repetitive after reaching the adult stage. But as openly stated it is in pre-alpha stage. I'd love to see more 'nature documentary' details added and especially around the other species AI, overall depth and size of the map. For instance, it would be great to learn from other species, seeing their hunting strategies. It would be great to have even more focus on replicating the realistic ""animal experience"" and create more immersion around the feeling of wilderness and particularly around the role of scent and how that is affected by thing like rain and water.

If you're a true dinosaur fan, then you should absolutely get yourself lost in this game and appreciate the lengths which the creators went through to create a factual and realistic representation of both fauna and flora in the Cretaceous period.

So far, the game is really just walking around, eating and seeing how long you can survive. I haven't gotten very far yet, since I have had trouble figuring out what the goal is. Do I stick with my initial family, or leave? How do I find other members of my species? Do I just keep finding small animals to eat, drink water, and repeat until I grow?

Some additional guidance from the game on objectives/what I should do would be helpful. If anything, if there was an option to have extra hints or not would be good to have.

Overall, I think it would help if they did release other dinosaurs to play as, so we can provide more feedback and also help the devs find more bugs in a faster time period. I can see how releasing one dinosaur for so long and trying to perfect it will delay the game.

PROS:
Este juego intenta recrear la vida del cretacico en Estados unidos, si te gustan los dinosaurios y experimentar como vivian es un buen juego
Los dinos se ven muy bien, estan muy bien modelados.
Es un juego con gran trabajo porque se nota que los desarrolladores han echo este juego con amor y pasion, mucha variedad de plantas, de criaturas para poder cazar e incluso el rex esta increible.
CONTRAS:
El juego esta mal optimizado, debido a que si le bajas los graficos no va a haber un cambio de FPS significativo
La IA habeces haces cosas extrañas como que se quedan atascados en un arbol y no pueden salir
Pocos dinos jugables, solo hay uno para jugar.
En mi opinion el juego esta muy bien si te gustan los dinosaurios, los desarrolladores estan trabajando para sacar el trike para poder jugarlo y dicen que estan muy cerca asi que no hay que desesperarse, yo lo compraria para este verano (que es la fecha en la cual creo que el trike se podra jugar, no estoy seguro) yo lo e comprado antes para dar un apollo a los desarrolladores ya que es un juego con potencial.

Die Devs haben das Geld von Kickstarter (und natürlich auch den Verkäufen selbst) genommen und das Spiel jetzt mehr oder weniger verlassen, es ist maximal ein Nebenprojekt, wenn überhaupt.

Unfortunately I still cannot recommend it, the updates don't seem to have made many differences beyond some performance issues. The game is still very dry and bland, and even with the new mechanics of mating and nesting it's basically a nothing sandwich. I find my mate which takes nothing, do a boring two second courtship dance, incubate for a day and a half and then my eggs hatch with damn near a .5 second cutscene and then the hatchlings are never seen. I'm not asking for anything gross or cringe with cutscenes I just want to feel some sort of accomplishment especially after eggs hatch. It was really disappointing when no babies appeared. This could be a bug, but at this point in development (literal years) it's becoming tiring defending this as being in pre-alpha.

 It doesn't help that the AI in this game is some of the actual worst I've ever worked with. Everything in this game might as well be brain dead. I feel bad being so critical and harsh but it has been YEARS since I bought this game at full price so you can understand my frustration. HOWEVER, I still give the developers props for continuing on unlike other's that just give up and never touch the game again...

It's just disappointing because I can really see the potential in this game, the models are really nice especially the Dakotaraptor and Tyrannosaurus. However, you're not given much to do except run around, eat, drink, and that's it.

bought this game years ago when i started trying dinosaur survival games.

is NOT worth the 20$ price tag.
theres plenty of other dinosaur survival games out there that offer realistic dinosaurs and realism that already have multiplayer and more dinosaur options.

this is the one dinosaur game i honestly feel depressed in once i have become an adult after hours and hours of wait.
with no multiplayer, waiting for hours seems rather useless so why even have such a long growth timer?
it took me only a day to play both species and get bored of the game with BARELY anything to offer other then never ending roaming of a map that has nothing but trees, trees and more trees with the occasional river leading into the ocean ..

after playing the game all the way through, i found that i regretted not refunding my money sooner as i  honestly never play it... the update speed is slower than frozen molasses.
i got this game back around 2017 and the only thing to come out of it since has been a few puny ai classes and some tweaks to the animations and recently a new playable class that honestly feels the same as playing the other class but a tiny bit easier.

ai RARELY feel threatening as they often do really out of character things or constantly just pace back and forth until they find something to kill before moving on to something else to kill.
easy to outsmart and often give up easily making this game feel so dull... if you can call it that...

I've owned this game for a very long time, and very little has been done to keep players actually 'hooked' with the game. Triceratops, which is meant to be the next playable animal, has been teased for years now without much else to go for it.

I do still believe this game has a lot of potential, but some things will need to change in the company and its design team and overall plan with the game. Notably:

-Replacing the Project Manager
-Pushing out routine snapshot updates of playable animals like the Triceratops
-Creating a tighter schedule for development of features
-Getting greater community involvement to reignite player trust

Saurian, as a game, is suffering from 'perfection-syndrome'. While its understandable that devs want their content to be as functionally pleasing as possible, it results in long development times, and creates a greater potential cliff for both player burnout and bad reception. 

This is especially a problem when people have already sunken money into a game that, while early access, is still very unfinished and probably shouldn't been released as an EAT to begin with. Furthermore, whoever is running the overall project has done quite poorly at maintaining a more rigid development timetable for the rest of the staff. 

After years of development, while there's been plenty of bugfixing and a few graphical and gameplay changes, there's been no real 'meat' for the players. Instead, Saurian in its current state is a walking simulator with a few interesting gimmicks and nothing else. With only a single animal to play, and limited options in content, the game is too bland and the wondrous effect of the scenery and time-period wears off rather quickly after a few hours. 

This is, indeed, a harsh criticism but I do not want to discourage the dev team, but provide feedback that they can learn from. This product has great potential, but things need to be done better and a higher standard enforced. Even if the triceratops or other playable animals aren't scrubbed yet of their quirkiness and bugs, they need to be released in snapshots to players. 

This achieves two things: It allows greater play-testing by providing loads of feedback about these animals and greatly increases the pool for bug-searching - thus reducing development pressure. Secondly, it engages players by making them feel they have some input into the development of the game and keeps them invested. 

As it stands right now, the developers are left to test things themselves and are too busy trying to perfect every facet before releasing them. Thus, we've had to wait a long time for very little. Now, normally, I would be pressing hard for a refund.

I don't mind supporting indie developers but when I feel they are squandering away on useless details and the money has not gone to good use, especially when it could have been invested into something more worthwhile, I become rather jaded as would anyone. Because not only has my money been wasted but also my time. 

I will say though that this is not an instance where I will press for a refund. I do believe wholeheartedly in fact that the developers for this game are very passionate about this project. I see it during the blog updates and the time they put into the bug-testing and development. Unfortunately, the business decisions made here were based on very poor judgement and need to be rectified if the project has any hope of being successful or even continuing. 

Now, me supporting an early access title (EAT) is a risky investment, especially if I plan to invest more money later. This has not been lost on me, but sometimes the pay-off is well deserved. Would I recommend this game to other players? Yes and no. 

I would recommend it if/when the developers heed my advice and take better care to keep the community engaged. The potential is there to make a great, unique title. However, I would not recommend buying it right now. It is too unfinished, and better to be put on the back burner and checked on every once in awhile to see how it is doing. 

I would offer my services even if I thought it'd be useful in regards to better management. However, what I can offer to the dev team is the above criticisms and this final note:

Edit: It's now 2023 and more details have come out, apparently one of the people on the dev team took off with money that was meant for developing this game. I sympathise with the other devs, but i believe now that this game is dead. They have decided to discontinue the dev logs.

I loved this game to bits, and it used to run decently well. Even if the frame rate tanked to 10 seconds per frame when I did The Raptor restrain attack, I still can eat lizard with well-timed click. Now when I come back, the raptor mini game now works smoothly.

But the hit detection/bite box is horrendous. I've chased big target like Archaeopteryx and the venomous large lizard and keep biting air. I know it possible to bite them without aim mode because I survived to age 2 without aim. Speaking about aim, the transition from 3rd person to 1st person is terribly disorienting with barely noticeable cross-hair that might turn into the same colour as the grass and occasionally have your dinosaur model blocking your vision.

The sensitivity is out of control. I set the sensitivity to the lowest just to accidentally turn my view 120 degree just tilting left or right, but in aim mode, it becomes impossible to look any way but right ahead. It's seems that sensitivity setting only effect aim mode somehow?

One time the venom lizard just stop moving and I stand right on top of it, repeatedly biting and nothing happen. I go in aim mode to bite and nothing happens. I move closer and bite, the lizard start trashing, but else, nothing happens. 

I've die so many time to starvation with small and large lizard right under me. All my successful hunts own to the lizard just stop running for some reason and give me the opportunity to reposition myself for 5 times.",1580621236,1587312002,False,5,0,0.543802320957183838,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I waited to see where the game would be by the new year, but as it is, I cannot recommend this game to anyone unless you have money to burn and want to roam around a map as a single species of dinosaur.

As of this moment, I would recommend the Isle over this.

The game seems to be in limbo as of this moment, the prior devlogs only talking about textures on plants and whatnot, not really what anyone wants to hear when, after 2-3 years now, we still only have one playable when others were promised. Multiplayer was mentioned, when that was planned to be one of the later goals of the game. I've had frame rate and bug issues running rampant that never seem to actually be fixed, one being such I couldn't eat/drink and eventually ended up starving to death. Took me 3 tries to finally get a raptor that could eat properly. There seems to be a massive lack of communication between devs and players, as the forums show what people are concerned about with the game, though it seems the complaints fall on deaf ears. 

If this game actually ever does pick up again and we get good, solid updates that actually add to the game, I may change my review in time. But as of now, I cannot recommend this to anyone.

I adore survival games. I adore survival games where you have to play as something other than a human. I adore dinosaurs.
I want to adore Saurian. I really do.

The models look amazing and the overall feel of the game look great! I play (and love) The Isle and I was hoping for another splendid dino survival game like it, but single player. I picked the game up as soon as I could.

However, no matter what I make my settings and no matter what I have running on my computer, I cannot get this game to run smoothly. It takes ages to load in (if I can at all, before crashing) and when I can finally get in the game it can only get to around 10 FPS. If I try to save it crashes. No matter how low I make my graphics this game just cannot be played. 

I do not have a crappy computer either! It runs massive games like Monster Hunter and The Isle on good graphics just fine! I can play Minecraft with 40+ mods loaded in and it's just fine! It's just Saurian that runs this poorly and I cannot understand why and I'm very dissappointed. I'm hoping as more features are added and the game is updated this issue will be resolved. I'm aware it might just be an issue with my system but that doesn't make sense considering what I can do with my computer without any of these problems. 

I will not give up on Saurian. I just cannot reccomend it for now even if you think your system can run it. You might be surprised how bad it runs. Maybe there's some crazy miracle setting I can add to better the FPS so I will allow comments and suggestions!",1577778438,1577778438,False,12,1,0.599222302436828613,0,True,False,True,False,,,

i give this score because of the numerous glitches and bugs i have encounter and not only that the lack of tutorial makes it even more difficult (it took me 3 days to find out i could glide, climb trees and group up which i was unable to do so) and not only that the dev team have been working on this game since 2013 and i have notice they are focusing more on ""how pretty it looks"" instead of ""this should work properly"".
It is okay to have aesthetic but is not okay to forget to make the game fun and not focusing on pushing sales for a ""guide book"" that on physical is around $40 to $50 and the digital  pdf is $25 which can be easly replace by forums and youtube videos and is free.

Pros: 
But

the only good thing about about this game is that is about studying and understanding the recent research on dinosaurs and their possible behavior (although Wolfquest is better*cough* way better on*cough*)and also there arent many dinosaur games where you are an actual dinosaur (excluding the isle,primal carnage etc. those game dont really study dinosaur nor really immerse yourself truly )

Saurian fails at every single aspect of what it's trying to be, whether you look at it as a whole or look at individual aspects in a vacuum. Come back in maybe, eight years? It might be ready by then, probably won't be, probably never will be. 

I'm one of the suckers who backed the Kickstarter and I've been waiting for this game to be... well a game, since give or take 2013 when it was announced. It's not coming anytime soon.


Saurian ""as a Game"":

If you are interested in Saurian as a fun dinosaur simulator you will be sorely disappointed. It's pretty much unplayable because of poor performance and ample bugs, and what little content is included gets over-polished (sometimes multiple times) ensuring nothing new will ever be added at anything resembling a normal development pace. You will be waiting months or years (yes, years) between updates that don't even add all that much.

The last update as of writing (Dec 2019) was in March of 2019, and the last before that in December of 2018. It seems unlikely there is any real risk of the game being abandoned given how much ""new"" (see; not in the game, potentially ever) content is shown off so frequently, but that doesn't justify this beyond sloppy execution. A large part of releasing an early access title is committing to the promise that you will not only finish your game, but will actively upkeep it and provide the players with maintenance. The team seems actively opposed to bug fixes or patches, instead side-lining what few fixes they do add to later include them in larger content patches that invariably introduce new bugs themselves.

If you want to have fun running around as a dinosaur you should buy ARK Survival Evolved and install some mods that let you do just that. It's far from an ideal experience but even that will do more for you than this game does right now. 


Saurian ""as a Promise"":

Saurian has existed in some form for almost a decade, surfacing as little more than professional concept art in the early 2010's. That is, concept art and a promise; ""Saurian will be the dinosaur simulator game that is as realistic and scientifically accurate as possible, delivering both an immersive and true to nature experience."" paraphrased mind you.

That is to say that this game has, since its public inception, marketed itself as a scientifically rigorous product. I have nothing against fantasy dinosaurs, after all the dinosaur names we know are as much beasts of myth that live in public perception as they are titles for the real animals that once lived. But false advertising is false advertising.

Saurian's team is not trying to create a scientifically accurate dinosaur simulator. They do not care about being scientifically accurate. Scientific accuracy is to them, a tool, not a reason, not even a set of guidelines to work within.

As a concrete example of the team ignoring scientific accuracy, maniraptoran* hands show evidence of the fingers being covered in feathers, of a propatagium on the front edge of the arm/wing, and the second and third finger of many species show evidence of being connected suggesting this was a common trait of the group. The Dakotaraptor in-game displays none of these features, despite all of them sans the feathers being something generally well regarded as fact since the 1980's, and the feathered fingers are something anyone doing modern reconstructions of this group is most likely aware of, especially if they purportedly work with experts.

OK, you made a mistake, oh well. Here's the kicker though, they acknowledged this and then proceeded to make the same errors again with Anzu and Stenonychosaurus. They simply don't care about getting details like these right, and yet continue to advertise the game as ""rigorously detailed and scientifically accurate"".

* For the benefit of the uninitiated, maniraptorans is the group containing Velociraptor, Oviraptor, birds, and the immediate relatives of each. It also contains Alvarezsauria, Therizinosaurs, and Scansoriopterygians (the ""dragon winged"" dinosaurs) but they all have highly specialized hands and so are not relevant here.

Then we have the T. rex., and I get it, there's a new super popular paper out there that's gotten a lot of press stirred up about how ""Jurassic Park was actually right all along and feathers are wrong and lame a-f bro"", and being the fakes you are you want to immediately ditch for a scaly rex the moment it becomes even vaguely defendable. 

I think it's a poor decision scientifically based on frankly minimal evidence based on a paper that makes really damned bold assumptions about variably interpreted tissue samples (some people say skin, some say scales) that are CENTIMETERS across... But whatever. If you want to have a scaly Tyrannosaurus, go for it.

But don't brag about how changing it needlessly is some huge great thing that makes your game more accurate, when you can't be bothered to get off your hind ends and fix things that are objectively incorrect about your designs. 

300 something hours spent redesigning the Tyrannosaurus to get what I would have come up with in ten minutes if you said ""make it technically accurate, but no feathers"", and they bragged about how long they spent on this thing. They BRAGGED about how many resources they flagrantly wasted.

Saurian is not worth your time, and it sure as heck wasn't worth mine. The level of incompetence on display on simply every front is astounding and disheartening.",1577047706,1577047706,False,12,0,0.564004957675933838,7,False,False,True,False,,,

This game has great potential. I bought it, when it was first advertised on steam. I'm  a dino lover, and I am indeed looking forward to yet see, a dino simulator which does the job. 

I will keep it short. This game has been standing still for years, and I chose to support the devs by spending my money on this game. We've for many years seen no other playable dino than the first. The only playable dino plays exactly like it did in the start. (no change there), and the game is simply laggy as hell and nearly unenjoyable because of overpowered AI, AI stupidity and being able to run halfway through trees. Devs keep showing us their work in progress and log. Latest update being refining the bark on a fucking tree. How about doing some hardcore refining on the game mechanics, AI and adding content that makes the game enjoyable.

I remember when the Isle was dumb and bare boned. The way the Isle kept making the game interesting, was by refining and adding enjoyable elements to the game, such as new maps, scent,  and other playables. 

I suggest the devs to make the player enable a map, so we get an idea of where we are going and so that you atleast could find your way through the map. If ya get lost, the fast draining og your food and water level will get you killed. This makes it impossible to explore. I'm getting all worked up about how this game is standing still with no interesting features, simply because it all feels like one big scam. Updates are also coming out so slow, that by the time the game will be enjoyable, no one would play it, because it will be outdated before it even came into existence.

FFS.  DONT BUY.

The devs recieved MANY THOUSANDS of dollars on kickstarter, and all they've done is take the money and fucked us all on it. I demand an explenation, a transparrent in depth telling on what is going on. Untill now, this game has been nothing by a bloody scam. Shame on you devs. Are you even listening to the reviews on steam? How dare you cunts, gather hundreds of thousands of dollars and then spend 80% time jacking off into your 100 dollar bills, the other ten making devlogs and the last 10 laughing about the money you've gathered.

作者は多分恐竜は好きなんでしょうけどゲームになってませんし、3年でこの出来では今後も期待できません。

2017年のレビュー見て「こんなんとっくに修正されとるやろ…」って思ってやってみたら
まじで食い物がトカゲくらいしかないですし、草食恐竜のしっぽに当たっただけで即死します。エフェクトも何もなし。
3年でここまで進歩無いのは逆にすごい。これ程までにやる気ないならSteamから消したほうがいいのでは？

正直この作品は惜しい所まで行ってる。
右クリ時のエイムカメラは恐竜の真横に付く感じで迫力あったし、常にこの状態で遊べるように調整したらかなり臨場感ある。
しかし現状エイム中のカメラ感度が変えられず、ものすごいゆっくり動く状態なので実質エイムは役に立たない。

普通のゲームならあって当たり前のダメージエフェクトがあるだけでもいいのに、それが無いから「これ当たってんの？」という不安が常にやる気を削いでくる。

一段階くらい成長すると飛び掛かりアクションが解禁されるが、別に威力が高いわけでもなくすぐに振り払われるため、10数回飛び掛かっても倒せない。振り払われないためにFlapコマンドがあるが、スタミナ消費がアホみたいにでかいので途中で降りて再度飛び掛かるのと変わらない。
さらに自分よりでかい相手限定なので、常に即死の危険が伴う中張り付かないといけない。
何のために新技覚えさせたの？

一発即死じゃなくせめて数発耐えてくれるだけ、自機のダメージも多少マシにしてくれるだけ…
それだけでこの作品がゲームになるはずなのに、どうしてこの状態で数年経過するのか理解できない。
設定されてる数値が滅茶苦茶。センス無いってレベルじゃない。

ちなみにこれは一番低い難易度Casualの話です。
Casualはセーブするタイミングがいつでも、Normalは寝た時、その上の難易度では死ぬとセーブデータが消えます。
難易度ってセーブデータが残るタイミングの話じゃないよね普通？
Casualは少し攻撃・防御が高いみたいですけど結局ほとんどの攻撃で即死ですからもはや関係ないです。

セールだから買ってみましたけどこれは無い。これで定価$20は失笑物。
TheIsleもひどかったけどこっちのがひどい。定価$3くらいが妥当。
$1のDinosaurHuntの方がまだゲームの体を成している分遥かにマシ。",1574866749,1574866749,False,3,1,0.577464818954467773,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Das Spiel hat seine Fehler und Macken und man braucht Geduld wegen der Ladezeiten und manchmal spielt man mit <20 FPS, ABER deswegen heißt es ja auch Early Access. 
Ich persönlich finde, dass das Spiel bereits absolut spielbar ist, auch auf einem eher mittelmäßigem Laptop. Natürlich sind weitere spielbare Dinosaurier und mehr Features wünschenswert und sind ja auch geplant, aber wie andere schon geschrieben haben wird es von einem kleinen Team entwickelt, so weit ich weis sogar nur auf Hobbybasis (?) und meinen Respekt hat das Team auf jeden Fall. 

Am Negativstem ist mir aufgefallen, und ich will dazu sagen, dass das für manche Spieler wahrscheinlich kaum Priorität hat, dass manche Errungenschaften, Bone Butte, King of the Hill, und die beiden Versteckten nicht funktionieren, eines davon kann aber glaube ich noch gar nicht funktionieren. 
Eine Anregung wäre auf jeden Fall auch ein Nesting-System und die Möglichkeit, mit Artgenossen Kontakt aufzunehmen, zum Beispiel um freundliche Absichten zu zeigen.

Zusammengefasst kann ich das Spiel absolut für Spieler empfehlen, die Geduld mitbringen und diese Art von Spiel mögen. Andere sollten sich vielleicht eher überlegen, für was sie ihr Geld ausgeben.

[*][b]Симулятор динозавра.[/b] Не охоты на динозавра. Не парка с динозаврами. Не выживания с динозаврами. Просто. Динозавра. К сожалению, пока что доступен только один вид — недавно обнаруженный дакотараптор — но разработчики стараются, да-с. И — никаких людей. Никакой техники. Никаких инопланетян. Динозавры, крокодилы, птицы, млекопитающие, ящерицы. И немного хористодер на закуску.
[*][b]Научная достоверность.[/b] Не все решения разработчиков абсолютно верны — скажем, оперение взрослого тираннозавра является лишь предположением, ведь на всех отпечатках шкуры этого вида обнаружена чешуя, а последние перья носил еще далекий предок тирекса — но разработчики действительно постарались воссоздать кусочек природы Северной Америки 65 миллионов лет назад. Все, от цвета почв до вида растений и самих динозавров — лепота, абсолютная палеонтологическая лепота...
[*][b]Неплохой ИИ.[/b] Конечно, идеальным его не назвать, но крокодилы стараются при опасности уйти в воду, сравнительно мелкие травоядные — убегают, отчаянно маневрируя, а анатозавры — не реагируют, пока не подойдешь вплотную. Вдобавок, млекопитающие в лице дидельфодона стараются выбираться наружу только ночью, а птицы улетают, стоит хоть чуть-чуть к ним приблизиться.
[*][b]Полная свобода действий.[/b] Конечно, в пределах возможностей динозавра, но мы можем творить все, что душа желает: бегать, прыгать, утолять жажду в реке, ловить крокодилов на отмелях и нападать на взрослого здорового тираннозавра просто потому, что хочется (реальный дакотараптор, полагаю, до такой ереси никогда бы не дошел...). По сути, симулятор жизни динозавра именно этим и является... ну, исключая тот факт, что года жизни тут протекают всего за пару дней, а секса нет. И не ищите.

[*][b]Графика не фонтан.[/b] Я не скажу, что она ужасна, но порой-таки задевает, когда, к примеру, текстурки проваливаются под землю, или ночной вид реки — ужас и мрак. Модельки динозавров выглядят хорошо, но идеально — лишь в статике: в динамике, увы, тут же начинаются дикие перекосы, подергивания и заносы.
[*][b]Наполнение все еще скудновато.[/b] К сожалению, мир «Saurian» пока что выглядит полупустым: ни поваленных деревьев, ни старых трупов (или костей), ни каких-нибудь насекомых, на худой конец. Ясное дело, разработчики старались вводить в игру только то, что найдено, но, ей-богу, напоминает мем со штанами Арагорна.
[*][b]Баги, вылеты.[/b] Поскольку это предрелизная версия, надеюсь, что в будущем разработчики смогут это исправить. А то, ей-богу, надоело мне застревать в реке...

[b][h1]ИТОГО[/h1][/b]
У игры огромный потенциал: в конце концов, ничего столь же амбициозно-достоверного еще никто не делал, а учитывая обещания разработчиков ввести кастомизацию, новые виды ящеров и даже постапокалиптическое выживание после падения знаменитого Чиксулубского метеорита — это будет знатное приключение! Остается надеяться, что денег и желания хватит, а обещания не останутся обещаниями... уж постарайтесь, «Urvogel Games»!

The models, the animations, the environment, and the amount of research done for this game make it very accurate to how we know dinosaurs today, and I really like that about this game.

Only one dinosaur is playable, the dakotaraptor, there is no aim in the game (other than eat, drink, sleep, repeat) and there are a fair amount of immersion-breaking bugs that you're guaranteed to run into every single time you play. I don't hate this game, but I think it was released way too early, and the updates aren't frequent enough or significant enough to justify that.

TLDR: This is not a game, it is a scientific realism Cretaceous era basic needs survival/walking simulator. Which is perfectly fine for what it is, but it is not a continual playability source of entertainment.



This game still isn't abandoned, but phew is progress slow. I get small 2-3 person team with other life obligations, but by the time the game is in a solid state people who cared about the game are 5 years older with different lives themselves.

The game is crazy scientifically accurate and it does offer some hours of entertainment, but boy is it boring after those few hours. There's just.. nothing to really do. Perhaps this is what it is like to be a family pet. Eat, sleep, do circles in the back yard. Maybe have fun catching a bird now and then. At least the family pet has some different toys.

It's fine for what it is, but this isn't a 'game'. Not as an insult to the title, but in a very realistic assessment: this is a scientific dinosaur era walking and basic needs simulator. Support the science if you are into that, get a couple hours of checking it out. But don't buy it in its current state for gameplay like ark or isle.

__November 5, 2019__

It isn't abandoned, people are just being dramatic.

The devs have weekly / bi-weekly dev logs where they show the community images and video clips of development with explanations on exactly what they are working on. YES it is slow development. And yes it is understandable why people are upset on the pace when they invested in a product and are yet to see much return.

Personally, it isn't really a big deal. I'm just sitting on it, waiting for fruitation. The devs are obviously showing exactly what they are working on and there is progress. As long as that's there it will eventually come together. If the dev log didn't exist I'd probably have a different feeling on it.

As far as the game itself, it is a POINT of the game to reach scientific accuracy, as much as they can for a game. Down to the types of plants, what they looked like, and what each herbivore actually ate in life. They are reading actual published papers on relevant content for the game. There isn't a whole lot to do past a day or two of gameplay. You survive to adult, run around, eat, sleep, drink, explore. It's as much as you would expect living and surviving as a creature 70 million years ago, obviously simplified without current deeper social behaviors.

If a couple hours of running around just dinking about isn't good enough for you, then hold off. If you want to support the devs trying to create something accurate, to a point of going to actual paleontology conferences, then get a couple hours of gameplay, and sit on it till it hopefully hatches.",1573005923,1613157206,True,60,1,0.795448184013366699,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Ok - so you are still here? Then take a seat, get a cookie and a tea and listen.

I've bought the game when it released it's first early access version. Since then, there are many blog entries and updates, but nothing has changed. Literally nothing. Those minor variable adjustments, don't even consider to read the changelog until you got free time of your life you seriously want to waste.

I've followed the development a long time and there was not even such a thing like a milestone. That said, an early access game which isn't even able to deliever more than 1 out of 5 playable dinosaurs is a dead project. Imagine, maybe in another 9 years we would have 3/5 playable dinosaurs. Lel.

The devs hide in excuses and promises. A macOS version was promised and hold back and back and even after this long time it never happened.

I tried this game on 3 different setups and was never really able to see an enjoyable time since the game lags as would it compute bitcoins in the background. Even on the lowest settings it's unplayable while I can play any other indie game maxed out.

All right, it's taken me a long time to compile my thoughts and feelings, and I may edit this in the future. But here we go.
I began tracking Saurian early, when development was first announced. I pre-ordered the game, funded the original kickstarter, all of that. Needless to say I was extremely excited for this when it was announced and first came out. I love simulation games, I especially love realistic animal simulation games. I love dinosaurs, so this was practically made for me. 

When it first released, it was troubling, but of course it was new, it wouldn't be perfect, the lag even on my girlfriend's three thousand dollar gaming rig could simply be chalked up to the game being new and having kinks to iron out but even after all this time, very little has changed. The devs refuse to acknowledge the fact that something about their game causes massive memory leakage and/or other forms of lag that leave the game unpleasantly jittery or slow even on extremely high end gaming rigs, even at low settings. 

The controls are a little bit uncomfortable and the in-game tutorials leave a lot to be desired. You're liable to be killed in a single hit even by miniscule creatures while your own damage will likely simply whiff off of things without breaking their stride, I'm not saying it should be easy, it's supposed to be realistic, but there's very little realism in being completely unable to land a hit on another raptor while brushing past it leaves you dead, or falling dead instantly when you jump over what should be a small enemy. This leaves hunting an unfun and buggy mess as you're much more likely to end up dead on the ground when you brush against another creature rather than having any sort of success. Eating small lizards and birds is the only truly viable option for survival even as an adult Dakotaraptor, which is unfortunate as catching even these small prey items is incredibly tedious and unfun, I love hunting in games, but this one leaves a lot to be desired, you'll miss more often than not even when your prey is bonking into your head or claws.

This might be fixed if the above lag issue weren't present, but I can't be sure either way.

Work on this game is slow, meaningful updates are few and far between as the devs seem more intent on making this game into a vanity project to fuel their own superiority regarding having The Most Realistic Dinosaur Game, they've spent more time re-making the T-rex model from scratch, for instance, than they have addressing player gameplay concerns, and so despite being out for over two years now, the game is still as much a lagging, memory hogging, unfun mess as it was upon initial release. They continue to pour time and effort into non-player creatures, while all these years later, Dakotaraptor remains the only playable creature, likely due to a lack of dev focus and the fact that they swiftly scrap all previous work the moment any part of it seems to be 'realistic', this is an issue because science continuously moves forward far faster than progress can be made on the game, which means that they run on a treadmill of incompletion in regards to Saurian.

In short, Saurian had a lot of potential, but this potential is wasted by the fact that the Dev team refuses to acknowledge issues with playability, focuses too hard on things outside the scope of gameplay, allow their need to be the best and most realistic to constantly set back their progress on game completion, and a general seeming lack of care that their playerbase is slowly becoming more and more let down and annoyed by all of this and more.

Proceed at your own risk, I cannot currently recommend buying or otherwise supporting this game until the dev team proves they can be trusted to actually make an enjoyable, playable experience, even if it comes, yes, at the cost of some of their realism. Which thus far, they have not.

Please note that my low playtime is deceptive, I usually play using my girlfriend's copy, since her steam is the one currently on the gaming desktop.

EDIT:  So here we are in 2021. I’m coming back to edit my review because I think that’s fair. The short version is that the game is still not worth the price tag, but I’ll go into more detail below.

Despite what some replies to my initial review may say or imply, the game is still at its core, boring. I won’t dance around that, once you’ve reached adulthood there is simply nothing else to motivate you to continue in many ways aside from exploration, which is fair, the game looks nice enough, not groundbreaking, but nice enough.

There are still issues with running the game, I got myself a PC built specifically to more than run Monster Hunter World at full everything at absolute maximum frames which it does beautifully. Saurian still has moments of jitter or lag and I can’t turn the render distance of the foliage past half without it starting to have...Issues. Again, my PC is newly built specifically to run demanding games at good performance and Saurian’s poor optimization still presents problems at times.

Hunting as a baby dakotaraptor is still a pain, the lizard hitboxes are less than great and you’ll find sometimes that small prey simply despawns without warning.

AI leaves a lot to be desired, I’ve watched whole flocks of Ornithomimus die because they stood in the water screaming aimlessly at a small gator, which admittedly was extremely funny but also clearly not as realistic as the devs likely intend. 

Young triceratops can randomly become hostile to roaming herds of anatosaurus, it may also happen with adult trikes from what I’ve heard but my experience was with other juveniles. This resulted in one herdmate dying and the other glitching in such a way that she forever held her head at the charging angle and refused to drink.

To date I have played both playable dinosaurs to adulthood because I want to give the game a fair shake, and I did pay for it, so I may as well keep my review up to date.

Triceratops gameplay is boring, the only predator that will ever pose a threat to you are T rex and you’ll see them long before it becomes an issue. Playing as a male allows you to control the direction of your herd, but for some reason the devs seem to have coded it so there’s no way to tell your heard to simply stop and stay in an area—and leader or not they will simply keep walking into the wilds until it disconnects you from the herd. This means that doing things like drinking and grazing will require you to either run ahead and do so as they walk, or constantly be changing their direction as you do so to make them walk in circles near you, it’s annoying.

also quite frankly it’s unnecessary and a strange way to code the herding behavior, tethering your herd to you—assuming you are the lead male—would make the herd behavior feel more authentic and would require less player neurosis.

At this point in the game you may as well not play as a female trike, while males at least can take and defend herds, female trike gameplay currently consists of following your herd while their AI does its best to exist. Courtship and nesting isn’t implemented as of this edit so that’s not applicable. 

I will say that battling another male as a male trike is somewhat fun, it feels heavy and realistic, I definitely enjoyed it for the moment it lasted. 

Raptor hunting as a non hatchling is better now, the prey restraint has been updated and feels less like you’re controlling your raptor with hands full of butter but unfortunately the raptor movement—especially the turns—feel like attempting to swerve the titanic around an iceberg, the raptor is not fast enough to justify the bad turns being accounted for by sheer need to slow down, even from a walk, the raptor turn is wider by leagues than the bulky triceratops, and that feels bad.

Right now the game let you play as a Dakotaraptor (T-Rex, Pachycephalosaurus, Anzu, Ankylosaurus and Triceratops will be ingame [u]in distant future[/u]).
You start as a little chick and have to survive on your own because Dakotaraptor-Parents are really bad parents. Also: Their intelligence wasn't high enough to realise that they shouldn't attack a Pachy, or a crocodile, from the front.
Not so clever girl (and/or guy) I would say.
No wonder they went extinct.
Nevermind.
You play as Dakotaraptor.
You hunt (gameplay wise it's... well... one gets used to it), you eat, you drink, you sleep. But: You can be much more clever than your parents! But you can't be a parent on your own right now (will be ingame [u]in distant future[/u]).

And that's it.
Right now I can't recommend this game.
I know it's a niche game. I know it's a dinosaur simulator. And I know it's in early access. I backed this game back in 2016 (I guess it was 2016) and now... well. Here we are: You can play as a Dakotaraptor.
Nothing has changed contentwise since the release of the early access version back in August 2017.
It's been over two years, but it feels like 65Million years, and I am at a point were I'm scared to become a fossil myself before the game gets its first major content update.
(to be fair: The devs are publishing a dev log every other week so we can at least see what content may be ingame [u]in distant future[/u].)

It was supposed to be a game that had a focus on creating a scientifically accurate portrayal of the life of a dinosaur. I loved the Idea, and I hoped for a good game before playing it, but I have several complaints. First off, the controls are abominable. I've played a fair amount of PC games, and nothing has ever made my hands cramp more than playing this. The controls feel incredibly awkward, and this is only one of the reasons this game feels unplayable. There are so many more issues when it comes to difficulty and gameplay. To be completely honest, I'm not the best when it comes to playing games, but I at least know what a progressive game feels like. The mechanics of the gameplay are incredibly difficult to maneuver, and I often find myself extremely frustrated just trying to get past the first stage. When it comes the graphics, I'm a tad bit disappointed. I own an ASUS at home, and while it's not the most powerful computer, it has some pretty decent graphical capabilities. As I said before, I've seen the game in it's development, and there were some pretty major differences between the official release, and how it looked before. Since your most probably reading this review on the store page, I'll tell that the pictures you see on there are just the same as what I had seen many years ago. This is by no means how the game looks now. The graphics in the official release are much poorer. In the end, I don't hate this game for what it stood for, but I was hoping for so much more, and I'm utterly disappointed.

Update: May 4, 2021
I tried playing the game again, because I wanted to see if there was anything I missed out on, and I couldn't. The game doesn't even run properly and I can't even start a new save. This game is unplayable, and the fact that to it hadn't even gotten past the pre-alpha stage is infuriating. When I first heard of this game, it was in the latter years of my late dinosaur phase. I used to be obsessed with paleontology and I had expected this game to be the ultimate prehistoric experience. After this game, my love for the scientific intricacies of the lives of dinosaurs had slowly dwindled off, as there was little more to sustain that interest afterward. There will always be a place in my heart for these wonderful creatures, and I hope they make a comeback. I personally think that the feathered T-Rex has so much more potential for fear and thrill than everyone else says it does. Until then, I'm left with a void of unfulfilled dreams. I'll be waiting, though. I still have hope yet that these glorious animals will make a powerful and memorable comeback.",1564581034,1614876822,False,15,0,0.656602978706359863,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Widzę ostatnimi czasy jak ludzie narzekają, że tytuł za bardzo się ociąga z dodawaniem większych zmian, z wypuszczaniem nowych, grywalnych gatunków, ale osobiście cieszę się, że twórcy wolą pracować powoli i dokładnie, dzięki temu świat tej gry jest piękny i coraz mocniej dopracowany.
Niezwykle mi imponuje to, jak ludzie odpowiedzialni za ten tytuł pasjonują się tematyką prehistorycznych gadów (i nie tylko), to po prostu cudne, jak za grę bierze się ktoś, kto ma w sobie miłość do swojego dzieła, a nie tylko chęć zysku. Te uczucia są zresztą widoczne już od pierwszych sekund przygody z Saurianem - wyróżniają się w nim niezwykle dokładne projekty występujących w świecie stworzeń, każdy z nich wzorowany był na prawdziwych skamielinach i spekulacjach naukowców, a nie tylko wyobraźni i chęci ""przekozaczenia"", żeby te wymarłe bestie wyglądały fajniej. Tak samo jak zwierzęta, również roślinność i poszczególne biomy zrobione zostały z dbałością o szczegóły, co szczególnie widać w dostępnej w grze encyklopedii, gdzie zaserwowano nam krótkie, ale treściwe opisy fauny i flory, a to kolejna rzecz wzbudzająca mój szacunek - coś takiego powinno być w każdej grze tego typu!
Rozpisałem się jednak o warstwie wizualnej, a co z resztą? Mimo tego, że Saurian wciąż pozostaje w early accesie, może się pochwalić wieloma różnymi mechanikami i mocno wciągającym gameplayem, generalnie nie mamy tutaj widocznej fabuły, bo sami musimy stworzyć swoją historię. Po nazwaniu i wybraniu płci swojego dinozaura, zaczynamy rozgrywkę jako świeżo wyklute pisklę. Od tego czasu naszym zadaniem jest biegać po całym dostępnym obszarze i dbać by nasza postać była najedzona, napojona, zdrowa i trzymająca się z dala od zagrożeń. Brzmi jak jeden z wielu survivali, tyle że w wersji z raptorami, co? A jednak jest coś takiego w tym tytule, co każe zapamiętać grę na dłużej. To nie jest prosty świat, tu naprawdę można wejść w skórę swojego podopiecznego i pozwolić wyobraźni na sklejenie epickich historii. Zachwyca i urealnia rozgrywkę masa szczegółów i świetnie zrealizowanych pomysłów, jak choćby możliwość wspinania się na drzewa w młodym wieku, to, jak inne dinozaury reagują na nas w zależności od naszego stopnia rozwoju, przymus wypracowania własnych technik polowania (lub wykorzystywania w tym celu innych), czy chociażby radość ze zwiedzania zróżnicowanej pod względem ukształtowania terenu i biomów, mapy.
Podsumowując: Saurian to gra od pasjonatów dla pasjonatów, bo szczególny zachwyt z tego tytułu będą mieli właśnie ci z fazą na dinozaury, ale i przeciętny gracz odnajdzie w tym tytule sporo uroku.

While it is clear this game is still undergoing work, it has been enjoyable to play and I'm going to keep going and exploring further from where I am now.
Things I Enjoy:
- variety of dinosaurs and other creatures I have seen. While I know there are only four dinosaurs that will be playable, the fact that the environment is still so alive with all the other creatures that lived in Hell Creek makes the game feel more alive. I've also noticed the AI is a lot better than the early comments made it out to seem, so that is clear progress the devs have made.
- the sense of smell as an added trait helps make hunting and staying safe easier. It still does feel a little buggy, like the distance at which I can smell something isn't always consistent, but the more I've used the feature the more I've come to enjoy it.
- the '1st person camera' - being able to investigate things up close with this camera has been a nice touch, especially because I've also been able to see the close up of my Dakotaraptor's face as it ages.

Things I Don't Enjoy: 
- it was a little hard for me to control the Dakotaraptor with precision, but I have gotten more used to these controls as the game has gone on. It does feel to me like the jump feature is a little random on how it decides distance. 
- another control issue I had: when using RMB to flap my wings and hold onto struggling prey, my camera view would sometimes shift into '1st POV' and disrupt the action. I don't know if this is a bug or my computer, but I figured it would be worth mentioning.
- the fact that a failed predation attempt leads to death is a bit upsetting. I'm playing in Casual, so it doesn't bother me too much, but being so severely punished for misjudging the strength of prey is a bit intense. I know this is a survival game and trying to be as realistic as possible, but when confronted with a prey that didn't seem to fight back, only run away, I found it strange that I died as a result of not killing it quickly enough. I don't know if this is something that will change or I'll better understand the more I play, but it felt big enough to me to point out.",1561740624,1561740624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game has potential, and if you already own The Isle, and want something different, then i could probably recommend it...

Still think Saurian is worth the money it costs right now though, as it will provide hours of entertainment...

The best thing about Saurian, is perhaps the graphix on the sky and the lighting - like when the sun-light shines through the trees. It looks really good!!! The actual landscape have too bright colors or something, IMO, so it does not look natural (almost like they reflect more of the sunlight than what you see in real life). But as this is early access, i guess they may improve some things later on. I also like that this game is offline... Another thing - that i actually think this game got better than The Isle - is that the hunger decreases sufficiently rapidly so that you dont end up sitting still too much, waiting to get hungry so you need to hunt (unless you take down large prey, which can last all day)... On The Isle, a lot of the game is just about walking around, waiting to get hungry enough to hunt and eat. Or worse - laying in the grass, just chatting with people. I do like that chat, but i dont want to lay in the grass and chat the majority of the time i play the game, because i dont have anything better to do..!

I played raptor enough now, I know the map now, there is no multiplayer still which means you are stuck in this constant cycle of running aimlessly around without any objectives or things to find. I sadly was not a kickstater backer but I've been following the development since the very start. The graphics are lovley, the models are top notch, the sound and animations are wonderful, and yet the gameplay fun is missing. To me the most important thing.

People will always compare and right now I rather play The Isle until this game gets more patches out. They are still working on their list and multiplayer will come at some point, but until then it is basically a dead end. I played it long enough imo and while I understand that a game needs time to be done I kind of wish they would have waited a bit longer with the official early access to avoid votes like mine.

Simuliert werden die Tiere und Pflanzen der Kreidezeit in Montana, USA, vor ca. 66 Millionen Jahren. Momentan kann man nur eine Saurierart steuern: Den Dakotaraptor. Man schlüpft aus dem Ei und muss überleben. Dabei durchlebt man mehrere Entwicklungsstadien bis man erwachsen ist. In erster Linie muss man Beute erlegen und aufpassen, dass man selbst nicht gejagt und getötet wird.

Das Spiel sieht mittlerweile ganz ansehnlich aus. Jedenfalls wesentlich besser als in dem hier verlinkten Video (05.04.2019). Die Pflanzen und Tiere sind schön modelliert und die Animationen der Tiere sind flüssig. Die Soundeffekte sind noch relativ spärlich. Bei mir läuft das Spiel flüssig und ruckelfrei mit maximalen Grafikeinstellungen.

Hier wird der Schwerpunkt auf wissenschaftlich korrekte Daten gelegt. Die Pflanzen und Tiere wurden in der ""Hell-Creek-Formation""in Montana entdeckt. Man versucht mit diesem Programm also eine realistische Umgebung zu simulieren. Eine Vermischung von Dinosauriern aus verschiedenen Erdzeitaltern und Orten findet hier nicht statt. Mittlerweile sind relativ viele Tiere integriert (Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus, Anatosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, zwei Ankylosaurierarten, zwei Krokodilarten, kleine Echsen und Säugetiere und noch einige andere Saurierarten, sowie zwei Flugsaurier und einige Fische).

Außer dem Dakotaraptor sollen nach und nach noch drei weitere Dinosaurier freigeschaltet werden, die man dann selbst ""spielen"" kann: Der Tyrannosaurus rex, der Triceratops und der Pachycephalosaurus.

While still a quality game even at this stage of development, it's definitely not as feature-rich as other games of its type, with only one playable dinosaur so far (though Triceratops is to be introduced soon as of writing), and little to do once you reach the adult stage. There are also some QoL things it needs, e.g. better indicators for damage, seeing as the raptor prey restraint mechanic doesn't seem to be effective in damaging prey. But given the Saurian team's regular development updates and the frequency of patches so long after EA release, I feel it's safe to pick up this game either for later or to keep playing through the EA process.

The difference between the two is Saurian is an Off-Line Single player based game while ""The Isle"" is highly focused on Multi-Player

Graphics 
The Isle (9)       Saurian (4.5)

Its unfair to compare but everything on the Isle is better in terms of graphics.  The character models both look great in both games, but for everything else the Isle looks amazing while Saurian looks like a game from the early 2000s.  Even still The Isle's Character Models still blows Saurian's Out of the water

Game Play
The Isle (7)      Saurian (5.5)

This is where i find the Isle lacks but still beats this game.  In the isle, you are bored at times, but the islands are so huge that theres always new content to discover.  There is about 10 complete playable models in the isle compared to Saurians one single Raptor, but even then...both these games lack a games purpose after you finish growing besides survival.   The AI is absolutely crap in the Isle. Theres one raptor that attacks and 2 that broadcast the crap out of its area as a beacon and run when it sees you.
As for Saurian, its not much better.  The AI is very basic, either attack or run away based on your characters current model. Its better than the Isle but not by much.

I will add on to this once i play Saurian a bit more if requested.  But IMO The Isle is far superior and a better bang for your buck.",1550417656,1550417656,False,18,4,0.598425090312957764,0,True,False,True,False,,,

first of all, the bugs are so many because its an early access game, and the devs are trying their best to fix them all slowely. be patient jesus christ.
second, people yell at the devs because its laggy, check the specs below the page of this game, and check urs. then if ur pc meets the fock3ng specs, u can play this if u like it. if it doesnt just dont fock3ng buy it, stop being salty.
third. if its boring for ya, just dont say ''ooh this youtuber plays saurian it might not be boring because he is not bored im gonna buy it!!'' and then expect a ''boring'' game, u dont just need to buy it instantly but u need to read usefull reviews in there, and then think about if u would be bored or not, or this game is fun for ya.
fourth, if it crashs the same as the laggy problem, just check the damnit specs.
last i guess, people who yell at the devs that its developing slowely, the devs are trying their best and they work so hard on this game, u guys dont even realize how much work they're doing, dont ya?

this game is an early access one, so ill be patient on waiting new dinos and new updates, they are slowely updating it.
the graphics are good, but my pc might get laggy at some point so ill put low quality, still fine and can play it.
the hints are clear, and its easy to learn how to play this game. 
the sounds are realistic and cute and nice.
and the soundtracks, are very good, i love listening to all of them. its one of the best things i have ever experienced in this game.
if the dakotaraptor might look boring, its not. u can do the RPR on some animals, which almost every dino game doesnt add it, and the dakota is fast too, but the stamina isnt long, anyways its still good. 
they are even goin to add the triceratops ingame, so im hyped for this, everyone has been waiting for it or yelling for a new dinosaur, im so patient on waiting new updates, dont worry devs. 
its fun growing ur dakota, because when u are young u can atleast glide and climb trees, which is easy to escape from predators for this. and people that yell that they die every time, guys just climb trees or glide away idk, or learn how to survive.
idk everything is fine in this game, the devs are slowely updating this game and fixing bugs, so people have no sense to yell at the devs, people who yells at the devs arent patient or respectfull on how much the devs are working on this game.

these was all of my opinions, but i didnt finished yet to discuss on something.
people who yell at the price, and call it ''overpricing'' its not overpricing, they did this price because its an early access game, imagine if they didnt release this game yet and u had to wait till the full fock3ng game, arent u guys already happy they released the early access thing? nah nah lets just yell                           no.

okay i finished this review, thats all i have to say and i absolutely love this game, i support this game so much, and i respect the devs that are working so hard on this. have a nice day.",1550239569,1550239663,True,5,0,0.518918931484222412,0,True,False,True,False,,,

That's subjective because I'm an paleo fan. I have been fascinated by dinosaurs since I was little.
This game is still buggy and there has to be a lot of polishing before the final product. But slowdown for everyone's sake. Game development is a hard task that can take a long while depending on the game. I would say that the finished product will be released around 2022-2024 and that's a generous estimate. It's not due laziness but because of a small team. 

I read a lot of reviews that are irrelevant for example. ""I can barely run this game""  is one of the reviews I read and it boiled my blood because the where on the store page.  People also say ""The only objective is to somehow kill without being one shotted."" I have a question if you ever have seen an documentary where the weaker animals didn't get one shotted? It's survival of the fittest not an random dinosaur who has super dinosaur strength. In this game you're not special just another dinosaur in a world of Slight mentally challenged dinosaurs. Just like mine most of these reviews are subjective. Try to find an objective. In fact you can't trust reviews anymore nowadays and I'm also not asking for you to trust me.

Gameplay is fun but also tedious at times. The only sad part that I can think of is that the game is too easy. Just keep hunting small prey and go to the drinking hole from time to time and you will be fine. Actually the fact that some parts are too easy is because thanks too realism. I ran towards an T.rex an he didn't attack me because he wasn't hungry. And that's realistic. I wish you left some kind of trail behind that predators could follow or that the crocodiles would sit in ambush for when an animal comes to close to the water.

If I had to list dinosaur games then this game will be on top. And to the people that noticed my text being all over the place. Good job!!! I'm mentally challenged myself and this review is a laborious task  for me. Now I will go back into the darkness and keep supporting Saurian and Urvogel. And also buy the guide to Hell Creek.

My first two jumps on it where successful and caused some damage.
On my third attempt to jump I most likely tripped or something resulting in me hitting the side of Triceratops like some brickwall snaping my neck and insta killing me.

Would snap my neck again 10/10

Thought to be honest the game tends to get a bit boring as you wonder around searching for prey and water. There are no other preditors that would really chalange you as you can easily take them on or simply run away.

I would only recommend this game to people who are big fans of dinosaurs otherwise there isn't much to do in this game but to wonder around aimlessly with no goal in mind.

The devs are working very hard and I get that but this is just my honest review, I've always wanted a game like this.

-The Game-
Graphics: Pretty good, not the best of the games I have but up there.
Models: The models honestly are a bit on the bad side, at least for the T. Rex and Dakotaraptor as of now. The other models are not the best but this game is in EA so I expect them to become much better in the future,
Animations: Honestly? It depends. On the new Ankylosaur they put into the game most of the animations arent bad, but it's tail swing animation is horrid. I'm sorry but compared to all the other creatures' animations it's just bad.
Skins: As of now you can only choose one skin for the only playable creature as of now, but I'm hoping it gets better.
Gameplay: The gameplay is very immersive besides the AI, which they are working on very hard, and I understand it's an EA game but the AI still needs improvements to it. Besides that it's very realistic as they've gone for and the game is pretty fun to play WHEN YOU BUY IT AT FIRST. Once you complete the growth one or two times it gets very boring, and right now only 1 out of 6 playable creatures are out and it will be awhile until they are all out.

-The Community-
Forums: Very helpful from what I have seen, I haven't gone to the forums much.
Discord: From the time I've talked in it, the moderators for the discord and the people in general are very nice and helpful, if you have a question they will help you if they can.

-The Developers-
The devs of this game are actually very nice, they help their community if/when they can and are really working hard for it to become the game they showed us in the trailers. They release ""dev blogs"" from time to time showcasing what they've working on for the game.

Back when the game was little more than a showcase of the (then-laughable) AI, the Raptor Prey Restraint mechanic, and a pretty but empty map. Almost three years after backing the Kickstarter, and about six years into the overall development, I finally feel like the game is starting to shine enough for me to recommend giving it a try. But I must preface the praise I'm about to vomit with this:

Saurian is most definitely not for everyone yet. As an early access title, it's plagued with bugs and performance issues, which can make the game all but unplayable until they're patched. Updates are fairly slow to come out - hell, I love the game, and I usually end up putting it down for long stretches while I wait - and often wipe your progress when they do. This long after it was funded, you still only have the option of playing as Dakotaraptor, and the next playable dinosaur is still quite a wait away. You can grow to adult size in about two hours, leaving you with little else to do but explore your surroundings. In addition, while multiplayer was funded as a stretch goal, the game is years away from that stage. If you want more variety, you're better off waiting.

That said, Saurian has a number of things going for it.

- The environments are absolutely stunning and full of life. With every update that adds new AI creatures, it feels more and more like you really are taking on the role of a predator in an ecosystem. The dinosaurs and other animals are equally well modeled and animated - except for the odd animation glitch.

- You start out as a small and tasty snack for bigger predators, but you're not helpless. You are dangerous to the things that are smaller than yourself, even as a hatchling. The inclusion of small prey and the targeting and scent mechanics make it much easier to survive as a young Dakotaraptor than it used to be.

- Even if you run into trouble, the AI will not pursue you if you flee far enough away. In addition, young Dakotaraptors can evade predators by climbing trees.

- Your hunger, thirst, health, stamina, and growth meters are easy to keep an eye on. Progression is also easy to follow, as you grow steadily over time, and the game will prompt you to sleep when you're ready to advance to the next growth stage.

- When you get big enough, RPR is your intended primary method of hunting. It's much improved from what it was when the mechanic was first showcased. Once you get the hang of it, you can hunt most of the creatures around you with little difficulty - there are even cases of people killing the newly-included Anatosauruses. (Note: Your size determines what you can and should hunt.)

- As you grow, the AI creatures will respond to you in different ways. Things that would hunt you when you're young will react defensively or run away when you're an adult. In addition, creatures that would dismiss you as not being a threat will become aggressive towards you or flee, temperament depending. They will also fight back if you attack them when you're small.

- The dedication to accuracy is unprecedented. From the animals to the foliage to the location itself, the team is determined to bring us the most up-to-date, well-researched dinosaur game we've ever seen. While some things about the game are speculative, such as Anzu's planned vocal mimicry, there's no question that the devs are passionate about paleontology and bringing an extinct ecosystem back to life.

Right now, I do believe this game is worth at least picking up on sale. When Saurian is a fully realized game, I believe it will be an absolute marvel. Until then, if there's not enough content to keep you invested, it's perfectly fine to wait.",1546792892,1546792892,True,4,0,0.530610382556915283,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Amazing graphics, and a great approach to dinosaur world simulation that strikes a very good balance between realism and fun. The game looks like it's still in early development, and it has some limitations and issues (e.g. only one playable dinosaur at the moment and unpredictable/unexplained controls when trying to kill larger prey), so if you're looking for a finished/polished game, this is not it yet. However, what's there is amazing!

I think the developers have taken the right approach by providing only one playable dinosaur for now and focusing on perfecting it before throwing in a dozen dinosaurs just to make early players happy. Also, although the environment already has quite a bit in it, I assume the developers will improve on that too by adding some environmental challenges (an erupting volcano at some point for example) and improving AI for other predatory creatures such as the crocodilians in the water (which never sneak up on you at the moment) before final release in order to keep gameplay interesting.

P.S. I tried two other similar looking dinosaur games/simulations before this one and hated both.

It's been in production for a while now, with no end in sight. Updates are few and far between. At the rate it's going, I can't imagine this game being done for another couple years. I could be wrong, and I'm not judging the time it's taking. They're an indie developer and game production takes a long time. There's only one playable out of the 5 or so planned. Not to mention the game is mostly unplayable for most people unless they have a high end PC, and even then the game is not pretty to look at.
What I am judging them for is some of their 'science' and the behavior of some of the devs. 
Many believe this game to be the pinnacle of scientific accuracy, the gold standard. While some aspects are pretty accurate, a lot of other areas are not, and it should all be taken with a grain of salt. I appreciate the attempt, but it's an impossible task to be 'scientifically accurate' with this stuff; but don't dare question the scholarly authority of the devs on the matter.
I can't say all the devs have some questionable PR; nevertheless, there has been some unprofessional handling of critics from some of the devs. For example: one slandered my friend. This same person also said some questionable things to me. I would hope to see a little more professionalism.

What makes this game so outstanding good from any other dino survival games that are out now is the quality over quantity of the gameplay and models because here we have a dinosaur game that is highly focusing on a the closest and updated scientifically accurate depection of the dinosaurs and the enviroment at the late cretaceous period that once roamed our earth like how can you not resist a game like that.

I do also wanna say some of my opinions of people writing against this game and what some of the things you should know about the game and it's developers.

Just because this game has been out for more than 1 and half a year doesnt mean it should be out of EA (earley acces) and been a properly working game. Because working on a game is a hard work especially with game mechanic we havent seen and experienced before plus also the working time of these developers are only on their free/spare time because as i said previously here they prefer quality over quantity of their game and they rather have much added plans and fixed bugs they can release out in a big worth waited patch. 

Yet people still complain about the devs arent working hard enough on the game which i hardly disagree on because here as i say some part of it again they doesnt have this game as their full payed jobs to work on yet. They work this game on their free/sparetime they got in their real life and most of them are volunteers that hasnt had any game working experince and still learning to work on it because they are all sharing the same common goal to make this a ""Good enjoyable game for everyone"" which i am happy to see and play on.

I was really excited when this game was first announced, even backed it on kickstarter, but at this point it's just a disappointment.  I get that we're still early access, but I very much expected more for the time frame the 'pre-Alpha' has been released.  If you were in on the hype of the day, you would have thought they would be full access by now, but they haven't even begun to even get close to releasing the other 3 playable 'main' dinosaurs not to mention all of the stretch goals that were funded.

I've now shelved this game twice while I wait for some major development updates.

People have the opportunity to live the life of a dinosaur as close as possible.

 You start as a hatchling in the world and have the choice to rather stay with your parents for a while or to directly explore your environment and find yourself something to eat. But that’s not all, of course you have to [b]survive[/b]. There are many predators who will be trying to kill you, also including your own kind. So you have to be constantly watching out what’s around you, even plant-eating dinosaurs can be dangerous. The water is also not the safest place to go because crcocodilians will be protecting their territory there. You can prefer to be hunting on little lizards and birds at first but when time goes on and you slowly grow up it won’t be enaugh to be filling your hunger, so you have to begin to hunt larger prey. It will be challenging but once the prey is down it is going to be worth the effort. 

I really appreciate the work the developers put into this. They want to keep everything as accurate as possible and this is not easy. Every plant, every tree, every environment, each little detail on the dinosaurs and the look of them in general has a scientific explanation. Everything you see in this game is real and has really existed 66 million years ago. 

The design and the models of the dinosaurs are really good, original and detailed. The Graphics are also really beautiful. Unfortunately, my graphics card (940mx) isn’t really able to show these at 60 fps but it’s still enjoyable. For me the environment really feels like I’m in the nature, I don’t know why, but it just feels so relaxing, quiet and beautiful with the mix of sounds of the small animals and the wind. Trees are also mixed and the same ones aren’t used too often at the same place like you would see it in other games. The Animations, man, they looks really good aswell. So smooth and realistic. Each feather is moving on the feathered dinosaurs when they are walking and running.

Of course the game has some bugs as an Early Access Game and I am totally okay with that. My problem is just how slow the game has developed over the past year. We only got a few more AI Creatures, some more abilities and the Dakotaraptor still is the only playable dinosaur in the game. But because the concept of the game is so unique I’m still going to be supporting and following it.

The Ai is highly agressive, and mindless. Your parents will just wander around no clue, and just try to kill pachies and die. Good source of food. The herbivore Ai is very bad. Pachies just attack you when you go by them. Those ostrich bastards are also very annoying, they go in groups of 6-10 and when you attack them, they just make an orgy around you and consume you, pecking you that does about 1/12 of your health. Doesn't seem like a lot but it is when you're consumed by 8 of them that peck you endlessly. Crocodiles. CROCODILES. Those fricking messes, the just sit around in the middle of the river, and very easy to avoid. And when they do come on land, the small gator can sometimes SWIM ON LAND. This should be in bugs, and it wil but still, just ugh. Nothing really else to say, others just ignore you until you attack or threaten them.
Next part, This game is pretty good but runs horrible for a person who can run Far Cry Primal with a solid 60 fps. So I lower the res, and it looks terrible, people will say, ""It's not about the graphics! It's about the experience and gameplay!"" I know that but It ruins the gameplay for me.
With some more playthrough I'm now a Super-Adult, I can kill those Emu things quite easily with my pounce. That's antoher thing to talk about, pouncing. I like It, It's just hard to follow. Saurian devs don't want everbody to be a spamming pouncer Ik, but it's so hard to control which way you go honestly. It's like a joy stick, but all messed up.

The game is still in Early Access and has been in development for nearly a decade, supported in part by a GoFundMe. By no means is this unpolished clusterfцсk a masterpiece--although it absolutely could be one if its developers continue to put in the amount of effort and passion they've been showing for their project over the years. Maybe I'm biased because I like dinosaurs, and because dear god how I've longed to play as one in a video game--but [i]Saurian[/i] just appeals to me on a personal level.

Enough gushing, though.

What, exactly, is [i]Saurian[/i]? Well, if you're absolutely stupid and haven't checked it out before reading this, Saurian is a third-person survival game set in the prehistoric Cretacious era. It actually depicts a real place, the Hell Creek Formation, with its inhabitants being based on actual fossils paleontologists have found at at the location millions of years later. The dinosaurs that you see and play as are ones that actually lived alongside one another in that location, and their behaviors are reconstructed from evidence recovered there.

The main goal of the game is to survive as one of four dinosaurs (now with feathers!): Dakotaraptor, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, or Tyrannosaurus Rex (I've heard tell of Anzu wyliei and Ankylosaurus magniventris being added in the future as well). At this time, though, only one of the playable species is available--the Dakotaraptor.

Each dinosaur, from what I've come to understand, has a unique and different set of biological needs, predators, prey, and innate abilities. For example, Dakotaraptor hatchlings, which are small, can shimmy up trees to escape danger; an incredibly useful trick. Older raptors can perform a technique known as Raptor Prey Restraint, which involves latching on with the sickle claw and using their bodyweight to exhaust the prey's stamina.

It's very satisfying to pull it off for the first time--trust me on that.

Carnivores also have the ability to smell predators and prey around them, which is very useful when hunting--though some animals, like crocodiles, don't give off a smell and have to be avoided by keen observation.

[i]Saurian[/i] provides a real sense of an organic food chain. It is possible to encounter rotting carrion, to watch animals hunt one another from afar, and to be eaten by other animals yourself. There is even another species of raptor, Archaeoraptor, which will hunt hatchling and juvenile Dakotaraptor for food. As another organic-feeling element of the world, age plays a role in predator/prey relationships. The Archaeoraptor is the predator for the first two stages of growth, but as your Dakotaraptor grows bigger, it becomes capable of hunting the hunter.

As a hatchling or juvenile, most larger herbivores will not react negatively to your presence unless you attack them--but they will react poorly to the presence of an adult Dakotaraptor. Perhaps the coolest thing you can do in your first two stages (in my opinion) is follow a T. Rex around and scavenge its kills, since you're too small for the Rex to bother with and most larger predators won't go anywhere near it.

Survival in [i]Saurian[/i] is typically governed by four basic meters:
Your Health (obviously if this gets to zero, you're dead)
Your Hunger (you fill your stomach by eating your dinosaur's required food)
Your Thirst (go to the water and drink to refill, but watch out for ambush predators)
Your Stamina (this is quite high, but offset by the slow regen rate)

Pretty basic stuff. Your stamina is also affected by your sleep, or lack of it.

Additionally, there are statuses for things like envenomation, as there are creatures in the area that are venomous (For the love of all that's decent, stay away from the big monitor lizards when you're a baby!). As an adult, you generally won't have to worry so much about those things if you stay healthy, but if you're starving or sickly, it could do some serious damage.

If you get killed and hit 'retry' it restarts you from the last time you slept, while increasing your hunger by 25% or so. Once you've exhausted all the food you've eaten or died a certain number of times, you'll start losing health rapidly. If you don't find something to eat quickly, you'll die. Unfortunately, in Saurian, this is very difficult to do, especially if you've gone the wrong way at some point. Food is scarce and hard to come by.

This brings me to the part where I talk about bugs I've found and ways the game could be improved. It's still in Early Access/pre-alpha (people have told me different things) so it's clear that there's a lot of room for change, and I hope these things can be improved. [i]Saurian[/i] is a fun game, but it's also very hard to play sometimes because of all the issues.

The biggest issue was the sheer heat it generated. I have eleven mini fans, a box fan, and an ACU unit running to keep my computer cold, I'm using the absolute best tech I can possibly afford (1070 ti with the fan clocked up to 100%), and I still had my PC's CPU hit up to 99 degrees. Even [i]ARK[/i] didn't do that. I'm not really sure what the issue is, and it may be coming from my end, but--when I tried turning down the settings to compensate, I discovered that there was only one setting to turn down and it didn't actually affect what it should have affected.

Oy vey.

Now, some relatively minor issues.

I think there should be some hints about sticking to the coast as a hatchling, as going inland always led to my starvation. Food for the first two stages in general is incredibly scarce to the point where I think it should be a bit more common, maybe by an increase of 15% or 20%. That's only my opinion, though.

It would be nice to have the secondary attack be available out of the RPR context, albeit in a different form. I may just be saying this because I play too much [i]Dark Souls[/i], but it would be cool to be able to do combos with a raptor claw. Again, just my dumb opinion. It's also possible that the secondary is independently available and I was just having problems because I mapped it to an XBox controller (don't judge me).

This one is fact, though: the tree climbing animation needs to be re-done, as it suffers from a massive amount of clipping and just looks bad overall. Players and NPCs alike will sometimes slide down slightly tilted surfaces when not moving. The AI isn't very smart and will sometimes try to endlessly run into solid objects such as trees or locations that are too steep to climb. We know dinosaurs were bird-brained, but this is excessive.

There is almost no music at all, but I'm sure that's in the works.

Saving is a bit spastic. I don't really know how to describe it. Half the functions I mapped to my controller don't actually work, though again, this may be a problem on my end. Jumps aren't very fluid as there seems to be a break between the jump animation and the resting one, leading to a rather sudden aerial presence. Jumping is unreliable, too. Depending on the area of the map, you can jump ten feet in the air or two feet. It's very frustrating at times.

I'd write a lot more about [i]Saurian[/i], but I'm running out of space because Steam doesn't like big constructive reviews. Thanks, Steam.

tl;dr [i]Saurian[/i] is a game that's still being made, and thus it's broken and bugged as hell, but what we've been able to see so far is amazing.

If properly done, this could have been one of the greatest games that I have ever wished for. Unfortunately it has flopped immensely. 

The game was so hyped, and for what?  

The first thing you'll likely notice when starting is the incredibly poor optimization.  The game's fps is terrible, even on many high-end machines.  You can make all the pretty flora and fauna you'd like but when you move and everything looks like a slideshow, no matter what graphic setting you choose, will ruin everything.  

The animal's animations are sub-par at best.  While the adult dakotaraptor's looks decent, the hatchling's animations are awful.  It's head tracking makes it's neck look stiff and broken and it's trot animation is almost comedic to watch.  

The controls in general are also clunky and odd as well.  Adding a climbing mechanic didn't help any, as the controls and the gliding feel terribly awkward.  Fighting is unsatisfying and...well, I'm running out of new adjectives.  Awkward is the word for that too.

AI is generally not impressive and honestly mostly a joke.  Follow your parents when you begin and you'll see what I mean.  Your parents will die, usually to the first thing they encounter.  For a game like this, AI should be of utmost importance as it is all you have to interact with.   Instead, AI are mindless and robotic.  

The game has beautiful models and I appreciate the accuracy of the realism but the developers need to look at the functionality of their game over everything else.  It's in sore need of optimization and fine-tuning.  Updates are slow and they've implemented little to the game as a whole.  The structure of the game itself needs addressed before more is built upon it, otherwise nothing will change for the better.

At this pace, the game will never amount to much more than it is now, and it'll be multiple years before all the playables are added( not that more playable creatures will suddenly make the game great).  

If the game still looks, runs and feels like it does now, well, it won't be bustling around here, that's for sure.   Maybe it's time for some more professional help for the developers?

The fact that a lot of thought has been put into the dinosaurs, fauna, and landscape makes the paleontologist in me happy as well.

He reached the water, drank from it, and then just kind of melted into the water and died. So I took off on my own, hoping for an adventure. Instead, I found myself wandering a very empty world.

Even if this game fails, I'm more than happy to have tried it. Following the research and work of this super small team for a while and seeing how much efford has been put into making this as historically accurate as possible, I'm actually impressed they made it so far.

You a dino fan as well? You tend to keep an open mind with low expectations and test implementations like that?
You wanna support a project that takes the idea of feathered dino to a whole new level?
Are you willing to donate money on a cause that bring the most realistic idea of dinosaurs in a video game to date?

Then this is for you. Don't see it as a pledge. See it as a piece of support for something that finally takes us away from the scary lizard like Jurassic Park dino culture and introduces us to a reality where dinos can still be awesome and interesting even if they are fluffy af.
Get your hands on the first implementation of dakotaraptor and enjoy your self a simplestic but interesting simulator that even with all of its bugs and issues, is actually an educationally piece of work that has so much potential if it ever recieves more support.

I've been following Saurian for years and decided to finally get into it. I've always wanted a realistic dinosaur simulator, preferably multiplayer but this could also be fun. I go into the game and immediately I notice the awful frame rate. I thought others who complained about it were just playing on bad computers but even on mine, which is a gaming computer, it is barely functional. You really can't hunt properly because of how bad the frame rate is. As a baby Dakotaraptor I had no idea what I was supposed to hunt, I could not find any small prey at all so I relied on trying to find bigger dinos to hunt for me which brings me to the AI.

The AI is laughably bad right now. So many times I found AI dinos just standing still or walking into trees/rocks/etc. They do not pay any attention to me at all unless I get right up in their face and bite at them. Which brings me to my next complaint. I got bored very quickly. Between how empty the world feels, the lack of things to hunt and the awful frame rate making the game look like crap I eventually just stopped playing seriously and just went looking for things to kill me. 

All of these issues, I assume, will be fixed in time. But I was disappointed with the lack of progress they seem to have made over the last year and where this team's priorities seem to be. So focused on realism they are they seemed to have forgotten game play is also important, I'd argue more important.

I mean I can see the answer.... there is no wait button, there is no guarantee that there will be any dinosaurs around you at any given time. the ""combat"" is non existant. so I am this young raptor and I can either kill tiny lizards for food and die of boredom. or I could challenge a larger animal and die instantly cause I collided with it's head or leg.

movement controls are bad and clunky framerate is abysmal. feedback is non existant, I never know if my bites even deal damage, and the bites don't seem to interact well with the movement, which would surely suck if you re supposed to chase down prey. I don't think there is a dodge button. if you see an animal they are masterful dodgers, just scare a cat. it ll jump backwards. why would you not have a dodge button? you have wings!! you can use the wings to propell yourself backwards to dodge that little bit faster. I should be able to harass the bigger dinosaurs bite them once and flutter back like a demon chicken. there is a feature where you can jump on teh back of your prey aniamls but I don't know what buttons to press to not fall off.and then you die instnatly if you fall off cause the aniaml will bite you. another point where a dodge button would be helpful.

 also it takes like 5 minutes to add colliders to an object in unity. why can I clip through the trees???
I am thinking the reason why things don't have colliders is because the movement controls would interact extremely poorly with any type of collider that isn't a straight wall. sure sucsk that yyou clip into other dinosaurs... I mean they literally don't even collide. you can walk right through.

I love little more than learning about dinosaurs, but it seems you ve done nothing with it. the scientists  helped you make everything look good, but it's wasted on this non game.

Also the bonehead dinosaurs should deal damage only by running into things fast. they shouldn't instant kill you if you touch them while they arent even moving. get some damn speed based combat going.

The graphics are beautiful and makes me feel like I'm a dinosaur living in the Hell Creek formation of the past. I like the sounds the dinosaurs make too.

There are a few bugs I've encountered; I've noticed that even on the lowest setting of graphics, I lag for a split second every so often. Mind you, my computer's specs are slightly above the recommended level. If possible, the developers should lower the value of the graphics for the lowest setting and maybe the second-to-lowest setting, so we won't experience any lag. Or give us the option to edit the graphics individually.

When I loaded a save file, I was immediately attacked by a predator, but I dashed away before taking any more damage. My health bar was at zero, yet I was still alive. I couldn't bite, drink, smell, etc. Other predators couldn't even kill me. This is a bug I think the developers should look into, especially with the damage that inflicts onto you and to whoever you're attacking, as some of the reviewers mentioned.

A couple of things I'd like to see in the future are more dinosaurs spawning and the option to start a family. The world feels rather empty without a variety of dinosaurs in large numbers inhabiting it, and I'd like to have more things to do, other than run around and hunt.

But right now it is not worth the money, first off it doesn't run too well but this is to be expected from an early access game. The worst thing about it is the combat and interactions with AI creatures. The AI is supposed to behave in convincing and realistic ways, but instead acts idiotic, overly aggressive and suicidal ways. You'll never start a game without your AI parents attacking some random dinosaur on sight only to get pummelled in the face or going into water and deciding swimming around in circles forever is more important than survival. Additionally the devs seem to have made everything unrealistically stacked against the player, with the player dying in one or two hits from something that is the same size as you or even smaller, as is the case with the small gators. Even as an adult most of your intended prey can either kill you in a few hits, or takes 500 hits to kill. It doesn't help that your mouth often misses your target due to bad hitboxes. It is disappointed to be one-shotted and overpowered by similarly sized creatures and never be able to inflict the same damage on other creatures.

So much for a realistic dinosaur simulator when your man-sized raptor dies to a lizard 1/4th your size that takes 20 hits to kill.

Excited to see what changes have been brought about and what new content was available, I loaded up the game and gave it a try. And what I didn't expect was that it was all so completely, astoundingly... Disappointing. 
A game that had been on steam nearly a full year, and it felt like little to nothing changed at all. A few new mechanics, some new animal AIs wandering around, and that's just about it. Almost one year of development, and what did we recieve? Some half-baked mechanics that hardly ever work properly, and a handful of new creatures that aren't playable and have 0 impact on your gameplay experience.

So what do you do in Saurian? 
In Saurian you can choose one of four dinosaurs(Dakotaraptor is the only available choice atm) and you can spawn into the world as a hatchling, then attempt to survive the prehistoric ecosystem until you grow your way to the top. 
In the game, as your little raptor, you can fight your prey by pouncing atop it and tear it apart. You can also, as a juvenile, climb trees and glide between them. All this time the prehistoric world goes on around you. 
You'll see herds of herbivores grazing, carnivores stalking the jungles and shorelines, and if you're lucky, you can become to top predator.

Sounds cool, right? Except that the game doesn't feel like a world. All of the animals act exactly alike. Well, almost exactly alike. 
As far as I can tell, the AI has two different reactions to seeing your character. Kill it or run away. More often than not, you'll find the AI completely ignores you. Or the AI is completely suicidal. 
Giant herbivores will charge in and get obliterated by tiny crocodiles instead of running away. Triceratops will graze endlessly while you literally stand there and bite them to death. 
That is of course when they aren't randomly walking in circles, walking into walls or trees, or swimming out into lakes and rivers for no reason to get slaughtered by the tiny one-shot crocs. 
The AI is on-par with ARK: Survival Evolved's AI. And that's not good for a game like this that relies so much on the world to sell the experience. 

Speaking of the world. How does it look? Well honestly, the world looks and runs like garbage. They claim to have put so much effort into the plant life of Hell Creek, but ingame it just looks awful. As for the optimization? It's almost nonexistant. 
Nearly one full year has passed since this game was released and it doesn't feel optimized at all. I'm normally not hard on optimization in games because of my PC's build, but this is ridiculous. 
I can run most of my games at over 60fps, and in Saurian, on mixed settings, I can barely keep above 15 frames. No matter the resolution, the world still looks blurred and fuzzy. It's not an enjoyable experience. 

Overall, the game is just disappointing. Completely and totally disappointing. The dev team feels uninspired to work on their game, I mean look at their dev logs. There's little to no content present in them and the explainations of what is being done behind the scenes is almost nonexistant. 

I'll be checking back with the game in a few more months, but I can't be optimistic anymore. This game is a good example of a good concept with indescribably poor excecution.",1530234008,1530234008,False,30,1,0.65863114595413208,0,True,True,True,False,,,

Getting past what Unity does and can do leaves you with this game and every other Early Access Unity title to have ever blanketed the Steam Store. Ugly visuals. This is not to say Unity can't look great, it really can. The visuals Unity can render can be absolutely stunning (eg. Escape from Tarkov). You just need talented people working on it.

Focusing on the terrain, the one thing that should pull you into the world, immerse you into an environment and plant its hooks in you is utterly disappointing. The textures are all low-res and the models and sprites rather terrible. I mean I can see and count the polys on the trees and the terrain when its sloped. That's unacceptable, especially for a game and map that's been in development well before it launched its Kickstarter.

On the other hand the dinosaurs, AI, most of the anims, and social behavior systems are actually pretty neat. But this is the problem with first time developers working from a Kickstarted program. That being talented people in one area of game design and not so talented people in the others. This is the crux of the issue in my opinion with regards to Saurian and other EA titles. 

Couple these aformentioned problems with updates/patches that emerge possibly every 2-4 months, what seems like limited dev-community interaction via Steam, old and outdated FAQ's, a nonexistent roadmap, haphazard and at times ugly visuals, and limited actual gameplay components, this just isn't something I'd recommend to anyone in its current state.

Now, this isn't to say it won't improve over time, even drastically. Maybe they'll redesign, fix, and improve and beautify the flora, fauna, and terrain? I don't know. But given how rare meaningful and content rich updates seem to occur I wouldn't hold my breath.

I think the devs need to take this attitude because this game will NEVER be finished if they keep changing the details of the paleontological science in Saurian.  

The game looks good but it doesn't perform well at all.  I have an i7-6900k with a gtx 970.  I know that this isn't the greatest setup by today's standards but my setup should be able to handle this game because it surpasses the minimum hardware requirements.  Optimization needs to be the second big focus in Saurian because right now it stutters and has frame dips that make the game very unpleasant to play at the moment.  

I guess my dream for a fun dinosaur sim will be unfulfilled for now.  If I was the lead director on this game I would prioritize complex ai for sure.  Having AI that's unpredictable would make the game very intense and immersive.  Say for instance you run into a T-Rex that's very territorial and you're playing as a Dakotaraptor.  It starts defending it's territory because it made a kill or it's creating a nest.  If the AI in this game was more intricate then I think we'd have a better game on our hands.  Maybe a storyteller would be a good idea too!  If any of you guys have played RimWorld you'll know there's a storyteller that adds random events to your game which keeps you on your toes at all times.  That would be sensible in this game and it would really help break things up from eating food and drinking.  

On the whole, I really hope the devs read our reviews because the idea behind this game is a great one.  It's just that the execution is poor in Saurian.  It's all well and good to make a dinosaur sim that's grounded in science but this is a game at the end of the day and games need to be fun!  This isn't fun sadly because of it's grindy focus on surviving with little to no purpose outside of ""don't die.""  I respect the devs who are working on this game but they need to get their fingers out of their ears and start listening to the community.  This review will change when the game is more updated and most of all, entertaining.",1526324151,1547498823,False,2,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Unterstützung des Entwicklers hin oder her, der Inhalt der hier geboten wird ist die Bezeichnung ""Inhalt"" kaum wert.
Es gibt derzeit lediglich einen (doch ziemlich langweiligen) Sauriertypen zu spielen und eine Story oder wegweisende Tipps fehlen komplett.
Ziemlich ahnungslos wird man also in das Spiel geworfen und muss dann zusehen, etwas fressbares vor den Rüssel zu bekommen.
Das Jagen ist recht simpel gehalten. Aktiviert ihr euren Spinnensinn, so werden Duftstoffe von Beutetieren in näherem Umkreis als gelbe Wolken angezeigt.
Diesen Spuren gilt es zu folgen, um rattenähnliches Kriechgetier aufspüren und fressen zu können.
Leider führen die Spuren meist ins Nichts, oder die Nager flitzen so schnell weg dass ein verfolgen auf Grund der sehr schwammigen Steuerung, der miesen Kameraführung und des verschwindend geringen Ausdauerbalkens unmöglich ist.
Es gibt auch nicht sonderlich viel zu entdecken. Verlässt man das Startgebiet, läuft man immer wieder durch die selben öden und gleich aussehenden Abschnitte.
Die Grafik, die keine Augenweide ist und trotzdem wahnsinnig Leistung zieht, tut ihr übriges um schnell das Interesse an Saurian zu verlieren.
Schade, aber leider kann ich nicht mehr als einen Daumen nach unten zu geben. Zu viel Zeit ist vergangen, zuwenig hat sich getan. Neue Dinos und ein spannenderes Level und Jagdsystem, sowie schöner gestaltete Biome wären dringend nötig um das Interesse wieder wecken zu können.

PLEASE NOTE: Saurian is still in early access. While I love it, because it means that every so often we get a patch with new features and it feels like Christmas morning, some people can feel a little jilted when not all promised features are immediately available. So keep in mind that:

- In the future, you will be able to play as one of six dinos. Right now, you can only play as the Dakotaraptor.

- In the future, you will be able to play on either Windows or Mac. Right now, you can only play on Windows.

- In the future, you will be able to breed and form a family. Right now, the goal is pure survival.

- In the future, there will be features like multiplayer, a spectator mode, customization of your dino, color variations of playable and NPC dinos, natural disasters like floods or forest fires, etc. Right now, there are none of those things.

IT'S STILL A REALLY FUN GAME! I've personally clocked almost 50 hours just running around and aging my Dakotaraptor through the different life states. AND UPDATES ARE FAIRLY FREQUENT.

They're also pretty close to introducing an updated Tyrannosaur model, as well as releasing Pachycephalosaurus as their second playable dinosaur.

Obviamente ele está em pré-alpha, logo existem muitas coisas a serem melhoradas, porém até agora achei sensacional a proposta e ainda melhor o ambiente retratado. 

-Prós: 
-Gráficos são lindos 
-A jogabilidade é muito boa, os controles são simples e faceis de aprender
-A ambientação é muito boa, você vê os insetos voando, os pequenos animais, os outros dinossauros 
-A movimentação dos animais é muito boa, obviamente existem alguns bugs como ficarem presos em arvores ou não conseguirem escalar alguns tipos de morros, mas estava observando um dinossauro brigando com um crocodilo e cara, a movimentação dos animais é perfeita, parece que você ta assistindo aqueles programas do Animal Planet. 
-O ciclo de dia/noite é muito bom, assim como por exemplo, certos tipos de dinossauro procuram abrigo de dia e outros de noite.


Contras:
-O jogo ainda está meio mal otimizado, porém como isso é um pré alpha com certeza será corrigido com os futuros patchs, como já corrigiram alguns erros anteriores 
-Infelizmente para você ter uma boa ambientação gráfica sua placa de vídeo tem quer muito boa, pois o jogo é muito vivo na ambientação 
-A AI ainda é meio burra, animais correndo sem sentido, ficando presos em árvores, ou travando no meio dos rios, porém como eu já disse, é um pré alpha, logo vai ser corrigido. 

Observações:
-O início pode ser meio complicado já que o jogo te da apenas uma noção básica do que fazer, quando o seu dinossauro ainda é bebe você é muito dependente da tua mãe e pai e praticamente tem que ficar seguindo eles comendo o que eles matarem, porém, pessoalmente não acho isso ruim, só adiciona ao realismo, porém tem gente que não gosta. 
- No estado pré alpha só se pode jogar com um tipo de dinossauro, porém no futuro mais tipos serão liberadas mais classes
-A caçada é muito complicada, passei umas 2-3 horas tentando matar meu primeiro bicho, mas de pouquinho em pouquinho você vai entendendo até conseguir matar um bicho 

Nota geral:
No estado atual do jogo eu vou dar um 8/10, porém vai melhorar bastante de acordo com os desenvolvedores.

However, ambition does not always lead to well-rounded, good things. Saurian is so intent on being realistic that it fails to recognize what makes a lot of games fun: the detachment from realism.

I absolutely do think it is wonderful that Saurian is attempting to be scientifically accurate with regards to its portrayal of dinosaurs. However, I think that that is both overrated and hindering. Realism in of itself is overrated. What should be looked for is a balance between realistic components and fun, intuitive gameplay. Saurian does not have that in its current state. It is very, very primal in its development[no pun intended] and honestly boasts nothing to hold players aside from ""our game is gonna scientifically accurate"". This is also a very presumptuous statement on their part when you take into account the fact that all forms of science, even paleontology, is in a constant state of evolution in terms of revision. Only recently has it been widely accepted that Spinosaurus was a quadrepedal aquatic-land hybrid predator, and not the towering menace that dwarfed other theropods. Science has corrected itself on various occasions, so for Saurian to boast its claim of being accurate is holding itself to the idea that it will have to revise its designs in the future based on new information, which could prove to be hindering in terms of development time. Even beyond that, though. Hindrance is a huge part of the game's current scope.

Saurian is a walking simulator. Not a Dino Life simulator, a walking simulator right now. It aims to be a dino life simulator, but what exactly does that mean? It is a beautiful statement with no real concrete grasp on what it desires to accomplish and that is my problem with Saurian. It doesn't have much promise.

A dinosaur life simulator sounds incredibly boring because life itself can be very, very mundane when placed in a generalized context. As a result, Saurian would have to add in countless elements to improve the variety of dino life in order to keep things interesting. There would have to be rewarding reasons to play. There would have to be incentive for exploration. There would have to be tons of new content, and Saurian SEVERELY lacks in content as it currently is and as far as what it promises... Saurian would also likely benefit from having random worlds with random assortments of creatures to accomodate each playthrough, which would also thoroughly incentivise exploration. It would benefit substantially from random world generation and progressively generated playthroughs. Will that happen though, probably not? There needs to be so much more to this game beyond walk, eat and grow up.

It also still feels and plays very much like a work in progress. 

It's done with the help of paleontologists to make an immersive reproduction of the Hell Creek formation 66 MYA in Montana. Right now Dakotasaurus is the only playable species, but Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, and of course Tyrannosaurus (depicted as feathered, as phylogenetic bracketing suggests) will eventually be playable.

The Controls and UI are very minimalist (which adds to the immersion in my opinion) but the behavior of the other animals are complicated, and after 9 hours of gameplay I've developed quite a few stories that I've loved telling my friends about. 

What I like is that it's a hardcore survival game where you play a historically accurate large dromaeosaur dinosaur and it lets you learn about the game as you go, almost like real life, giving a bit of a learning curve but still very playable and not too frustraiting. The game is driven by complex AI that gives the player random realistic experiances rather than scripted story and the other animals behave in an understandable and interpretable way that's more like an animal with the same imperatives as modern ones instead of some monster like most other forms of media portray dinosaurs.

What I don't like is that so far it's quite short. I reached the ""end game"" after only 9 hours of gameplay and can't think of much else to try out right now. There's also a few oversights in the AI, like Pachycephalosaurs aggresively charging crocodilians in the water where they can't rally fight them and dying a stupid death. As stated before it's a work in progress and that's important to keep in mind. My biggest fear is that the game goes into limbo and doesn't realize it's potential.

In almost 1 year from the first release, the game only got 3 relevant updates. I'm supporting many EA games, but this game is embarassingly slow. 
Many bothersome and game breaking bugs, that are present from day 1 are ignored (example: extremely bad optimization and low FPS on high end computers).
The graphics isn't good enough to justify the low frame rate. The water rendering look horrible for a 2017 game (in some places, rivers flow from ocean to mountain so you never know which direction to follow to reach the sea.)
There is lack of gameplay (eat-drink-eat-drink there's nothing else to do so far), the AI isn't interesting enough and it's too predictable to be fun to observe. 
Sadly, I can't recommend this game until the devs start fixing the bugs and polishing stuff instead of adding more and more content over a broken base.

EDIT 1 - Looks like the latest updates slightly improved the FPS on high end computers so that's really good. The game however still lacks gameplay and it tends to become too repetitive after a few hours so I still won't recommend it to the masses, at least until the dakotaraptor lifecycle is completed.

This is incredible that there is a team of game developers that are so passionate about accurate portraying of dinosaurs and their ecosystem. I can only imagine amount of work that they are doing! This game is a bit different - more focusing on animal behaviors and survival than smooth gameplay but it is good in my opinion - if this meant to be a prehistoric simulator, it shoul be tough. Polished but tough. Looking forward to full version and I hope that makers will have patience to finish it because it is very VERY special educational game!

Models, animations, music - they are incredible! It really makes immersion.

As for now I can give a few impressions of current build:
- Please ""nerf"" the Pachy's! They are way too agressive - more than T-rex or Triceratops - and They have huuge damage power! They are literally hunting for My Dakotaraptor (Super-Adult even) like a predators!
- I'm not sure is that's in mind of devs but I think that Dakotaraptor's and T-rex'es should be able to hunt in packs. That would definetely be more accurate and more fun!
- Maybe Triceratops'es could form a circle when Dakotaraptors and Rex are nearby. Now they are agressive only after attack or after roaring at them.
- There should be more heards and less lonely wanderers in certain species - like Triceratops, or those birds especially.
- In actual game there should be some kind of goal - like find a mate or lay eggs, or protect younglings until they grow up to stage 2 - something like that.
- Maybe some foliage animations (later of course)?
- VFX like splashing water, or dust, or flying seeds and bugs, ocean shore waves, small birds are missing
- T-rex should have aniamtions for hunting a big prey. Now I think they are avoiding Triceratopses, and in clash their bites are hard to notice.
- Achievements are not working (weird small issue).

Of course theese are things that I could not found i any Diary, and this is my personal opinion. I understand that this is work in progress, so whole process is of course taking time.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list][*] [b]Dinosaurs are beautiful[/b]
[i]Clearly a lot of time and research has been put in into making these creatures as realistic and scientifically accurate as possible[/i]
[*] [b]Dino animations and controls feel natural and responsive[/b]
[i]And the devs are refining them all the time.[/i]
[*] [b]Fun gameplay[/b]
[i]You'll go through a bit of trial and error, but once you learn the techniques for survival, you'll find yourself dying less and less.[/i][/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list][*] [b]Only one playable dino at the moment (i.e. dakotaraptor)[/b]
[i]For the $20 early access price tag, there should be more content already; especially since the devs already mentioned that $20 is the planned full release price.[/i]
[*] [b]Dino balancing issues[/b]
[i]As of right now, pachy and northern croc are ridiculously overpowered and can one-shot an adult raptor, despite being a fraction of their size.[/i]
[*] [b]Map/environment looks unpolished[/b]
[i]While the dinosaurs look great, the map itself is clearly bottom priority. Might change as game nears completion.[/i]
[*] [b]Limited replay value[/b]
[i]Once you reach adult, there's really no more motivation to keep going. Could be remedied by adding a breeding system or more playable dinos. Also think a multiplayer option would give the game some much needed longevity.[/i][/list]

As many have said before, Saurian has a lot of promise. It's a much more basic survival game compared to, say...Ark: Survival Evolved, but it has a unique charm to its simplicity.

While I do recommend buying this game, only do so if you wish to support the devs and help see this project to completion. Otherwise, I'd personally wait until they have at least two playable dinosaurs, because as of now, there's only 3-4 hours worth of gameplay, and that's not worth the $20 price tag.",1519277336,1519277674,True,4,1,0.524330198764801025,0,True,False,True,False,,,

[h1]Pros[/h1]

- Paleontologists are working on this game to make it as real as possible
- Feathered dinosaurs 
- Graphics are stunning for early access
- Music: At night you will get the ""Silent Hill"" feeling
- Controls are fluent (so far no issues)
- Gameplay in general feels nice, especially the way you influence the environment or the opposite
- Dakotaraptor is beautiful (absolutely love the design)
- You are playing your dinosaur from hatching to beeing an adult
- KI isn't acting that stupid for early access
- Love the menu
- Enzyclopedia of Hell Creek (Dinosaurs/Biomes)

[h1]Cons[/h1]

- Only Dakotaraptor is available (didn't expected that)
- You can't climb on trees with the Dakotaraptor
- Lags: Whenever you hit a new daytime or when you enter a new biome (one to two seconds)
- Glitches: Sometimes the KI stucks in a tree (?), just like DePalma's Ornithuran glitches into water sometimes (?)
- T-Rex: Love the design, but it can't be that whenever the game is lagging for one second because you entered a new  biome or it is a new daytime, that a T-Rex is spawning next to you apart from that, you will encounter every 30m in the forest a new T-Rex (they are everywhere)
- Not so many things to do right now except of reaching maturity
- Quite expensive for Pre-Alpha (20 bucks)
(- Not an achievement hunter, but most of them are currently unavailable)
- Playtime: After you accomplish age six, you are an adult and that's it 
- You finished the game within two or three hours
- You can atleast try to survive until you accomplish age 11 to earn the title ""Super Adult"", but it's not worth it 
 (you will not unlock any new abilities or grow even bigger, it's not worth the time if you ask me)

[h1]Comming Next[/h1]

- Pachycephalosaurus will be playable next
- Triceratops than
- T-Rex will be last 

[h1]My thoughts/suggestions[/h1]

I knew it was in early access, so I didn't expected so much to not to be disasppointed in the first place. The fact that the Dakotaraptor is the only available dinosaur right now, disappoints me a little bit to be honest. Nevertheless I can recommend this game to anyone who loves dinosaurs and wants to support this little developer team who works from till to dusk to finish it. You can clearly feel the passion that went through the game so far. I absolutely love the fact, that the developers update every two weeks their blogs to show us their progress. I don't know how many times they will need to finish this game, but reallistically I wouldn't be surprised if UG will finish this game in 2020. They don't have to add multiplayer in my opinion, this would destroy the authenticity of this game. I think Saurian will be fine in singleplayer as it is. Just make sure you can raise a family and add some KI with which you can communicate through body language. Like if you want to hunt a Pachy in a pack or if you want to call your siblings, because you are in danger or hungry so your parents will go hunting or if a threat is about to attack you and you want to intimidate it so you can atleast have a time advantage of one to two seconds before it realizes your bluff and so on (that would be really cool, moreover pretty realistic).

[h1]My conclusion[/h1]

If you consider yourself as a person who don't want to waste 20 bucks into early access and don't want to have a game about dinosaurs which you will accomplish within handful hours, I can't recommend this game to you. If you love dinosaurs as I do and don't accept the game as it appears to be, but dare to see it for it could be - You will absolutely love it.

[h1]Update from 04/07/18[/h1]

[h1]Pros[/h1]

- So far the same (except of the KI) + UG added the Ornithomimus as NPC
- T-Rex is not spawning next to you anymore moreover it is pretty rare to find one to be honest
- (Not an achievement hunter, but they are now available)
- You can't kill a Chamops so easily
- You can now climb on tress as hatchling and juvenile

[h1]Cons[/h1]

- The KI: I'm not a biologist nor a paleontologist and I don't think you have to be one, but in my game most of the KI are moreover mathematicians - go round in circles over and over again.
Don't get me wrong, I love geometry...you know, it's quite unexpected when some prehistoric cratures are better at these things than you nowadays. 

- Mama & Papa: I know Dakoraptors aren't good at parenting, but out of five games...three times in a row my parants killed each other when I started the game and they saw me for the first time. I'm not that ugly as hatchling. What happened there UG ? Of course I eat them and I got the achievment ""Eat your own flesh"", but I didn't expected it in this way.

Dumb and Dumber 
(Sry precision in language)

- Borealosuchus sternbergii & Brachychampsa montana:

Maybe I was unlucky, but these guys did absolutely nothing. Swimming on the surface, swimming in cricles (déjà vu) or laying on the river bank with opened mouth and just waiting for their prey. 
Even when an Acheroraptor or a Pachy or any other creature (alone) were swimming next to them...nope, nothing, nada, niente. Woe betide you, if you are about to appease thirst ! These guys will go hunting you. 

- Ornithomimus: I absolutely love the design, it looks really awesome...but one does not mass with an Ornithomimus, why ? Because you can't kill it. I jumped on this fella more often than I would jump on my girl a day and you can't do absolutely nothing. Neither as sub-adult nor as an adult, you can't do anything. I even go around in circles to be in harmony with nature and try to kill it and that didn't even help. I love his ""thug-life"" attitude btw. After I tried to kill it, he just walked away as nothing happend.

- Major BUG: After I hit age five and just looked around a little bit, the camera zoomed in and I couldn't do anything from that moment on. A couple seconds later and I couldn't use my space bar  ( jumping canceld). Looking to the left side, running straight forward and getting hunted by two Pachys. Even when I commited suicide or just any dinosaur killed me, the settings were the same. Even when I reloaded my save, nothing changed. I started the game on the next day and I was in an area where definitely shouldn't be. Poisoned, starving and very thirsty and the settings were as nothing happend. Don't worry I survied and hit age six.

- Lags: Still the same
- Glitches: Ki doesn't stuck in a tree anymore, but DePalma's Ornithuran still glitches into water.

My thoughts/suggestions/concluion are the same. 

Still love this game and I'm looking forward to it. UG is doing a great job and this game is slowly taking shape.",1519164222,1523117337,True,43,3,0.781628251075744629,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Overall it has high replayability even in this early state, the models and animations are gorgeous, and the care and research that was poured into it is second to none.

Its absolutely worth a try even if you're just on the fence about it. It can only improve and with so much content in the pipeline and regular news coming from the development team (not to mention the wildly successful kickstarter and paleontological endorsements!) this is absolutely a game to watch and get in on early.

Updated 12-2018: patches are coming at a glacial pace and the redesign of the rex is unfortunate at best. There's been little QOL updates or main mechanic additions, rendering replayablity stale after nearly a year stagnating at the current build.

Also, my computer is several years down from top tier but I still get little to no lag. Idk what's going on with other people's stuff but I'm not convinced it's your specs.

EDIT: SO the first 15 minutes or so of being a hatchling do lag to hell. That goes away, stick with it
EDIT 2: I fixed the lag thing by turning the graphics UP, i was on the lowest for some reason. Fiddle with the settings, maybe it'll help.

Despite this, Saurian has a ton of potential to be something amazing. The game is really unique, and as someone who loves both games and zoology, an accurate as possible animal life sim is a dream come true
In this game, you play as a dinosaur. Not a ferocious, lumbering beast destroying everything in its path, but what a dinosaur really was. An animal. 
You live the life of a dinosaur as one might have done in the Hell Creek of the late Cretaceous, and the environment of Saurian's Hell Creek is quite nice, as the devs have tried to make it as historically accurate as possible, with plant and animal species found from the Hell Creek Formation. The dedication to making the environment and animals realistic is quite admirable.
The game is not perfect however, there are quite a few bugs, its not terribly diverse in the fauna department at the moment, theres only one playable creature in Dakotaraptor, and it is well, as said earlier, rough, though I expect these things to be worked out as development goes on. Hell, new animals are being worked on from what ive seen on the dev blog, and apparenly Pachycephalosaurus will be playable soon-ish

All in all, Saurian, while not the best right now, has a great amount of potential, and is pretty fun as it is right now, pick it up if you're a weirdo zoology-nut like me and have 20 buckaroons

A couple of crucial mistakes have crippled the game's potential to make money early on, and now it receives maybe one or two tiny updates in a good year. Updates that break things almost as often as they fix them.

Don't let my time played fool you: you can see everything this game has to offer in a couple hours. There's two playable dinosaurs. One controls poorly, the other one isn't that fun. The AI, gameplay, graphics and frequent bugs all conspire to stop you from being immersed for too long.

Let me sum up some complaints. First, graphics.
The models (which are what drew me in) look great but that doesn't mean much when everything farther than 20 meters looks like a billboard. The water is ugly. The lighting mostly does no favours either. Performance leaves some things to be desired. They were gonna gradually redo all the plant assets to make the game run better... there's been zero progress on that, meaning we've been stuck with only two biomes for almost two years now.

Now, gameplay... For starters, as Dakotaraptor you have a couple of useless verbs. You can climb into trees, but I can count the amount of times that's helped me on one hand. There's this slow-motion 'bite-aiming mode' that's too clunky to actually use in combat. Lastly, there's a sneak function, but it's meaningless since not a single animal is capable of outrunning you. Not speed-wise, I just mean that they don't really try.

You can do some basic communicating, but I've almost never seen it cause a change in the behavior of an enemy or a conspecific. It's very hard to judge where you will land if you jump, cuz the strength with which you do it feels random. As a Triceratops, the game's spawning AI will sometimes send a rex after you. Depending on your growth stage, this is either a death sentence or a nonthreatening chore, with no inbetween.

My point isn't that these problems aren't gonna get fixed, I know this isn't abandonware. The updates so far have already done a lot. All I'm saying is that I wonder how many decades it will take before this stops feeling like an alpha.
Saurian's the only thing I ever backed on Kickstarter. It gave me some hope in a dark time without much in the way of good & accurate paleo media. I wouldn't say I regret it, there's a great artbook and the soundtrack has some nice ambient stuff. But buying just the game doesn't seem worth it. The devs are nice people but I'm sorry to say that, due to a bunch of factors sometimes out of their control, they've essentially failed.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'll start with:

-VISUALS
The visual style of Saurian is in my opinion very nice. The plants blend in with the surrounding scenery well, and the vibrancy of some of the colours adds a bit of visual flare. The night sky is downright stunning, and the setting sun is also very pretty to look at. That being said, I did experience moments where the light from the sun cropped through terrain, and the ground looked too reflective to be realistic. 

Variation in terrain is also a gripe I have, as I noticed no fallen or rotting trees, no visible boulders/modelled rocks, and no sharp or erratic terrain. The game world feels like rolling hills more than anything, which results in an unnatural same-ness which makes exploring a little less fun. I really hope they add some of these things in a future update or the full release, as seeing dunes along the coastline and sheer, rocky cliffs where appropriate would make for a vastly improved experience. I'd also like to live out a life of a desert/arid wasteland dwelling dinosaur, but that might not be all that realistic for context so I can pass on that one.

-SOUNDS
The sound design is really good. No ambient music that I could detect, this might be a nice feature for the near future, but the crunching of twigs underfoot when making your way through forests and the constant chirping various animals makes for a really nice overall experience. I'm not sure if this would be realistic, but the echo of large dinosaurs vocalising would be great to hear. Also the sounds of waves around the beach would really add to the atmosphere, but I can't complain about what we've already got. It's solid all around.

-GAMEPLAY
The movement system in this game is pretty nice, once you've gotten a feel for it. Every movement (besides biting) has weight to it, it all feels very solid and well executed. Raptors move as they should, and looking at the way your avatar reacts to the movements of your mouse or the presence of another animal is admittedly mesmerising. The way in which your avatar attacks in the game is pretty non-impactful though. There’s no visible indication outside of the raptors jaw slightly moving and emitting a small hissing soun, and I think they need to implement some kind of visual feedback in order to make a bite more apparent. 

Saurian needs something to keep players occupied. A mountain off in the distance, an indication of the surrounding landmarks, anything that’ll keep us exploring or interacting. I don’t feel like going off into the wilderness because I can’t see any tangible evidence of any interesting landmarks. Players need a hook. I’ve suggested to the developers that they implement a mating and nesting mechanic, like base building in other survival games so as to invest us within the game, as currently Saurian is quite a lonely game. That being said, the Saurian dev team have confirmed that Multiplayer will be a feature in the near future. This alone won’t relieve the problem, and I hope exploration will be expanded upon in the near future.

I think Saurian is a worthy buy for any big Dinosaur fan, but I want to make apparent the basic state of the game as of February 2018. Don’t expect anything outside of a pre-alpha, because that’s all you’ll get.",1518166271,1518487512,True,8,0,0.584758937358856201,0,False,False,True,False,,,

As it is right now however, I'd say it's not going to be of interest to most people. The gameplay is limited - eat, drink, sleep, do it all over again - and the game is pretty buggy so I can't say it's the most immersive experience as is.

All of this is typical of Early Access games; it's what I expected when I bought it. If you're buying this hoping to get a half decent game that you can properly play and enjoy... well, you're gonna be disappointed! Personally, the main reason I bought this game is because I want to support the developers and see how the game improves over time. That's basically the only reason to buy in right now.

Unless you're a hardcore dino nerd (like me!) I'd recommend giving this one a pass for now.

The idea of a game like this was long overdue and it was about time we got it. Does it deliver?

[h1] Disclaimer: [/h1]

I know this game is in Early Access. This game is not nearly half of what the developers intend. The game constantly changes, adding in new animals and updating gameplay to make it function better while making it all the more fun.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

I truly felt I was immersed in the dinosaur world of Hell Creek. The scenery is extremely beautiful. The world look very different, such as the lack of any grass and the dominating plant life were ferns and conifers. But mixed with the swampy look of the terrain.
I’ve yet to explore more territory the game has to offer.

The dinosaurs are amazing. They truly made each dinosaur in the game look unique with different color patterns. I was captivated by the black and almost crow-like appearance of the Archaeoraptor for example.

I love how you start out as a hatching and struggle to survive. You had work to hard and smart to grow into the next stages of your life. You also have the option of not growing up. Which I found a little funny personally but it allows you to get an idea of what a dinosaur that age would be able to do.

The feel of the game can switch from absolutely gorgeous, mysterious, and frightful in a moment. Night feels the most scariest. The unsettling screech of an Archaeoraptor jumped me a little. Especially when I was unexpectedly ambushed by it. Sometimes when your turn your camera just a bit, you could a see a Tyrannosaurus in the distance. Fearing what it could do to you, the natural reaction is to step back and give it space.

[h1] Cons: [/h1]

The game is buggy and poorly optimized. Yes it’s in pre-alpha but it’s still shows up as a problem regardless in gameplay moments. Though, this is extremely rare and works fine for the most part.

While Dakotaraptor is a nice dinosaur, I would hope that more dinosaurs become available through later patches. Right now, only Dakotaraptor is playable and sometimes I just really want to be a Tyrannosaurus rather than look at one.

My most critical issue with the game is the hitboxes. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn’t have gotten hit by an attack and it caused me to die. Or sometimes I feel like I should’ve landed that hit but it did go through because of it.
The hixboxes did get better but they still pose an annoyance here and there.

[h1] Overall score: 7.5/10 [/h1]

The game is far from complete. New stuff is being added periodically and I can only hope for this game to get even better. Give this game a shot if you really love dinosaurs or want to know more about them.",1515479211,1516054366,True,25,1,0.687650620937347412,2,True,False,True,False,,,

2. Foilage lags.

  3. Weather lags.

4. I fixed most my lag by updating my graphic driver and using AMD gaming settings but it still does random jerks (Rarely) and gets stuck in water or in mass amounts of grass.

5. I got glitched twice. First glitch I became a juvenile and went hunting cause I was so hungry my health was dropping. I died and when I hit retry I had full hunger and water but my health was still dropping and I had to delete my save cause I was dying over and over for no reason.

6. I had to delete my save AGAIN. This time I was so thirsty my health  was dropping. I found the fresh water by the flooded trees. I was drinking it and my water would not increase. Then it said hold C to advance to next stage. I held C expecting to be a juvenile again, and I was still a hatchling. I slept, time went from night top morning, but I didn't grow and it still flashed to hold C.

================

This EA title has no real gameplay and has serious performance issues.
You can only play as a Dakotaraptor and progress from baby to adulthood.
I don't recommend this game in it's current state.

+ Models look great
+ Accurate fauna and flora

- Gameplay
- Performance
- Controls are laggy
- Night time has the same classic scene illumination problems.

Update: Mating system has been added; Not as detailed as I thought it'd be, but at least it's something new after all this time. However, one thing bothers me - After the new updates and patches some stuff seem to be bugging. The biggest error I experience regards dakotaraptor's parents. Back then they were walking quite a lot all around the map and attacked other animals, but now they mostly walk in a loop, sit every few seconds and don't even try to get any food nor to defend my chick when carnivores are nearby, so they've become completely useless. :steamthumbsdown:",1514483275,1661792728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The movement is awkard and stiff, much worse than the Isle. Jumping seems to respond very poorly, and is delayed as hell.

Hitboxes are HORRENDOUS, and this is one of the biggest problems with dinosaur games in general. I'm assuming this has something to do with the awkard body shape compared to something humanoid, but it is just so frustrating to have the tip of your tail clip against a crocodile's mouth and then have your character drop dead instantly.

The environments are beautiful, and the models are incredible, however the very poor optimization almost completely kills it. I have a beast of a PC and I am experiencing the entire range of texture imperfections, clipping/flashing shadows, blurry visuals, etc. And there is next to nothing in the way of graphics settings, so trying to fix the graphical errors is out of the question.

So with all that being said, do I recommend Saurian? No. I would personally suggest that you wait until it has more work put into it. The ideas are incredible, and I can see the skelton for a truly amazing game. But between the stiff controls, and poor optimization, it simply isn't worth the price tag now.

Although before you write it off, I must say that there is a very passionate and devoted dev team behind it, who have continued to be very honest about their limitations, and have kept up with their promises. If anything, keep an eye on this project, because I suspect great things will come from it.

[b]Saurian[/b] - это видео-игра в жанре выживания с открытым миром. Целью разработчиков является предоставление вам самого пленительного и максимально точного с научной точки зрения опыта жизни динозавра. 

Игроки будут играть за несколько вымерших видов в их естественной среде обитания и пытаться выжить начиная от детеныша до взрослой особи. Чтобы остаться в живых вам придется следить за физическими потребностями, избегать хищников и опасных природных явлений в условиях экосистемы, соответствующей самым современных научным знаниям о формации Хелл-Крик, какой она была 66 миллионов лет назад. 

Вы сможете исследовать динамический открытый мир, большая карта которого покрыта доисторической флорой, воссозданной на основании найденных окаменелостей. Местность Хелл-Крик бросает вызов вашим навыкам выживания, она полна различных неожиданностей, в том числе наводнений, лесных пожаров, ураганов и губительных сезонных изменений. И это не считая ее обитателей с острыми зубами и когтями.

Разработчики гордятся своей научной строгостью. Все аспекты Saurian подкреплены обширными исследованиями, чтобы привести наших животных и окружение в соответствие с последними научными данными. Кроме того, в процессе создания игры разработчики консультировались с ведущими экспертами в области палеонтологии.

Вселенная Saurian жестока. Как и в реальности каждое существо, обитающее в лесу, будет пытаться выжить. Искусственный интеллект животных привязан к тем же потребностям, необходимым для выживания, которые нужны и игроку. В экосистеме будет реализован динамический баланс приоритетов между различными видами. Одни динозавры будут бороться с вами или бежать от вас в зависимости от того, что будет наилучшим образом способствовать их выживанию. Например травоядные динозавры при нападении на них будут сопротивляться, атаковать либо убегать, в зависимости от выбранной искусственным интеллектом наиболее оптимальной стратегии выживания. Хищные динозавры, в случае если они не голодны или не защищают свою территорию, не будут нападать на всех подряд. 

Играйте как дакотараптор, пахицефалозавр, тираннозавр или трицератопс. Цель игры заключается в том, чтобы завершить за каждый вид полный жизненный цикл от детеныша до взрослой особи. Вы будете проходить через несколько различных стадий цикла, каждая из которых предлагает уникальный опыт и механику. После того, как основная игра будет завершена, будут добавлены два бонусных играбельных животных, таких как анзу и анкилозавр. При этом каждый играбельный динозавр будет иметь уникальный геймплей.

[h1]Будущее развитие игры[/h1]
[b]Генетические вариации скинов.[/b] 
Это позволяет игроку выбирать альтернативные скины для каждого из играбельных динозавров. Скины будут соотносится с известными генетическими вариантами окраски у животных: альбинизм, лейкизм, меланизм и piebaldism (частичный альбинизм).
Выбор конкретного скина будет влиять на выживание. Животные-альбиносы находятся в исключительно неблагоприятных условиях из-за того, что гораздо более заметны. Геймплей меланистов и пегих животных также будет уникальным.

[b]Режим спектра.[/b] 
Он позволит игроку управлять невидимой сущностью для исследования окружающей среды Хелл-Крика, а также наблюдать как ИИ пытается выжить в этом мире и взаимодействует с друг другом.
Кроме того, режим спектра позволяет управлять временем, погодными явлениями, а также мгновенно переносится к конкретному животному. Дает обзор карты с высоты птичьего полета.

[b]Кастом персонажа.[/b]
Выберите различные пропорции тела и другие особенности, родимые пятна и оттенки шкуры для создания уникального внешнего вида вашего динозавра. 
Все эти варианты будут ограничены до реалистичных диапазонов, но игроки будут иметь большой выбор параметров кастомизации чтобы создать совершенно уникальное животное!
От генетических вариации скинов будет зависеть сложность игры. Так, за альбиносов будет играть гораздо сложнее.

[b]Динамические события окружающей среды.[/b]
Дожди, грозы, лесные пожары и внезапные наводнения, сухие и влажные сезоны не дадут вам расслабиться, так как окружающая среда будет препятствовать выживанию. О, кстати, как насчет ураганов?

[b]Post Impact Survival (выживание в Хелл-Крик после падения Чиксулуба).[/b]
В то время как основная игра будет сосредоточена на выживании в естественной среде, мы добавим событие, которое перевернет вашу жизнь и экосистему в целом, а также ознаменует начало легендарного мел-палеогенового вымирания.
После удара метеорита будет новая версия основной карты, местом и временем действия которой будет та же формация Хелл Крик, но непосредственно после падения великого Чиксулуба. 
Таким образом это будет пост-апокалиптическая версия Хелл Крик, в которой будет гораздо гораздо труднее выжить.
Хелл Крик расположен довольно далеко от места удара Чиксулуба, что позволило избежать мгновенных и повсеместных разрушений, которые часто изображаются в документальных фильмах, однако радиоактивные осадки и облака пепла привели в конечном итоге к гибели всех животных размером больше кошки. 
Найти такие ресурсы как съедобные растения, подходящую добычу и пресную воду станет во много раз сложнее, да и другие животных в экосистеме будут становиться все более отчаянным, чтобы выжить. Это всего лишь вопрос времени. 
Режим Post Impact Survival все равно закончится смертью игрока. Главное продержаться как можно дольше.

[b]Новые играбельные динозавры.[/b]
В финальной версии игры мы получим шесть играбельных динозавров вместо четырех.
По результатам голосования из анзу, анатозавра, орнитомима и анкилозавра выбраны анзу и анкилозавр. Анатозавр и орнитомим будут присутствать в игре только в качестве ИИ.

[b]Мультиплеер.[/b]
Синглплеер будет главной особенностью игры. Мультиплеер является приятным, но не таким крутым дополнением. В мультиплеере не будет никаких команд. Игроки сами будут решать как взаимодействовать с другими людьми.

Where do I begin. This was a near-personal game to me as I connected with it so well. As you may have gathered from my profile picture alone, I love dinosaurs, and this was right up my alley.

Though in EA and very, very buggy as of the time of this review ( 30/11/2017) It still proved some great content and a realistic view into the life of Dakotaraptor. (More playables added soon: In order: Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus rex then Ankylosaurus and Anzu)

Positives: 
-Feels great, every minute movement and turn (Except Jumping, ocassionally) just feels amazing. 
-Animation, Everything in this game is animated beautifully, the turns, jumps and idle just blend perfectly with the environment and background.

-Graphics, AMAZING! For an indie game with a relatively small team, Saurian looks F*cking gorgeous. Everything from the smallest leaf to the Tyrannosaurus rex had countless hours to make it perfect. Couple that with some pretty great lighting and it looks amazing on the higher end settings. 

-Unique gameplay elements, I as of writing this, have only played Dakotaraptor, but even in that, it has elements like biting the throat for a faster kill, a risky but worthwhile hunting tactic, scents which, in a unique way, tell you so much about what's around, predator and prey, as well as not causing massive frame drops in other games it's featured in (The Isle, particularly, also pretty good game, if not grindy), and RPR (Raptor Prey Restraint). RPR is a basically a juvenile to super-adult way to pounce on an animal, pin them down or grapple onto them, and start eating them alive. While not unique to Saurian, Primal Carnage comes to mind, it's never been taken to this extreme before. It's a very difficult maneuver for animals larger or stronger then you, but if you perfect it you have a way to hunt basically anything within reason. There's also species based sight and hearing senses. Sight is a cone that in some animals, like Tyrannosaurus, lets them see large animals from almost literally across the map if it's flat terrain, but doesn't let large animals see smaller ones, and hearing, which is a radius aroudn the whole animal, also depending on what it is.

-AI Behavior, AI behavior is a very controverstial thing in Saurian. It's very buggy currently in game, but when it works, it WORKS! The animals behave and react very well to stimuli in the environment, but some pathing issues lead us to the negatives...
Negatives: 
-AI Behavior, Two main issues arise when using the AI, Pathing issues caused by some map changes, making some animals (noticably your Dakotaraptor parents) run into trees or have general issues getting around, like getting stuck in water, and the hitboxes. Some animals (Paleosinawa v Dakotaraptor Subadult and Adult for instance) just seem not to be able to hunt certain animals. This can be very frustrating when dependant on your parents, and in some ways even affect you in your later gameplay.

-Jumping. Jumping as of now is VERY VEEEERY buggy. It's also very hard to predict where you're going to land, as for juveniles and hatchlings it's a tiny jump, but for subadults and Adults, you can suddenly leap across mountains. It can also lag out and do a double-jump, the first a tiny one where you land, then you basically get slingshotted forward, throwing you off. 

-Frame Drops, While actively being optomised all the time, something about this game just kills frames. Keep in mind I only have a mid-tier rig but it can still run most things very well, but for some reason even on medium graphics I get major lag drops when in heavily forested areas and sometimes just randomly. This impacts your success rate in RPR, as well as many other things.

In conclusion, I do believe the game is good enough to get a recommend from me. Just prepare for some EA bugs and fps shitstorms from time to time.

I understand that the team is rather small and that they're working hard. But it's hard caring about a game when nothing ever happens and it gets tiring reading about how they're re-doing trees and plants etc.

This game have potential, but since there's nothing to do and nothing to look forward too it gets real boring real fast. It feels as the developers are stuck since they keep changing things up every time there's a new discovery being made about dinosaurs. It's great that they want it to be as accurate as possible.

Animals generally designed quite well; they look very much like actual, [i]real[/i] animals instead of monsters, which is more than you can say for some games/movies [cough]jurassic park series[cough cough]the isle[COUGH]

In my experience, it takes a few tries to actually figure out how the game works when you first get it - the first few attempts at a playthrough led to me getting lost before I was halfway to Juvenile and then either starving or quitting.
That doesn't mean that it's a bad game, however! It can just take a bit of trial and error to get started.

So far I've had two successful playthroughs, the most recent of which was started just this patch - and if you can look past the numerous bugs (again, pre-alpha build) then I completely recommend it! If you don't like getting your mouth stuck on lizards, or seeing floating birds, though, I'd suggest waiting until it's a bit later in development.

- лютый дисбаланс - все, что меньше пожирается без боя, все что больше - выносит с полтычка; злобный дакотараптор выдыхается не пробежав и десяти метров, слепой Т-Рекс и т.п.
- графические решения - уродливая вода уродлива, вид бурного течения в мутной луже рубит реализм на корню, Луна зеленого цвета?, окружающий лес напоминает все что угодно, только не первобытные джунгли (с диким миром theHunter:Primal пластиковые кусты Saurian рядом не стоят)
- бесцельность происходящего

Плюсы:
- можно управлять куриц... оперенным динозавром
- анимация животных вполне приличная, правдоподобные модели - динозавры действительно выглядят массивными, живыми и интересными
- охота временами затягивает
- настрой разработчика на долгую разработку (сейчас продукт еще очень сырой)
- местами неплохой визуальный ряд, хоть и без огрехов (застывшая трава и проч.)

Итого: необычная игра с хорошим потениалом, которая при должном старании разработчиков получит немало фанатов, их любви (и денег).",1509373244,1509373244,True,11,0,0.623008608818054199,1,True,False,True,False,,,

pontos positivos

-um ambiente bonito e agradável, com um realismo bom
- um jogo bem realista no quesito sobrevivência onde do nada pode surgir um dinossauro e te matar, ainda mais quando tiver dormindo
-uma variedade de dinossauros

pontos negativos

- pouca variedade de dinossauros no Mapa, poderia ter os Saurópodes e demais classes incluindo algumas cobras e Crocodilos maiores
- um único mapa com um único tipo de clima que varia desde uma floresta a um pântano, poderia ter mais opções de mapa como um campo aberto, deserto e um pântano bem mais alagado
- mapa pequeno demais, poderia existir um mapa bem maior, com uma boa variedade de clima, flora e fauna dependendo da onde fica, por exemplo, nos campos ter umas especies de dinossauros, nas florestas ter outros tipos e no deserto ter outros tipos diferentes de dinossauros, podendo ate mesmo existir praias onde mostre Repteis Marinhos e que seja permitido o dinossauro nadar no mar, nem que seja apenas para ser comido depois servindo como um limitador do mapa para indicar que o jogador não pode passar dali

[b] Summary	[/b]
While the dinosaurs are from a high quality the content in the first release seems very hit and miss.
The ai acts stupid! for example i have seen ai just walk around in circles or just forget i was just biting them a second ago!
this is ofc expected from an E/A game, however ""Realism"" is being used as the main draw for the game!
And with that fact inmind and looking at the state the game is in right now the only thing i can say is that my opinion is wait for the game to get more content!
However if you like dinosaur games i'm very sure this will be a must own game at a later point in time!
That's why i will still recommend the game.",1508075874,1508075921,True,2,0,0.535743474960327148,0,True,False,True,False,,,

I've got two dinos to adulthood and I have a few things that I would like to point out and maybe recommend the developers to fix or add to the game on the full release, but I would like to talk about the game a bit first.

<b>First of all, for the ones that are intrested into trying it out, if you love dinos and you want to control one on your own and survive, this is the game for you.</b>

You start out as a baby that is trying to survive by finding prey and avoiding being prey for the big ones. As you age, you get bigger and change!

At the beginning, I have to admit I was confused. But as I died a few times I learned good ways to survive and strategies. Find water!! That's what you need most, and stay close to it. If you get lost, sometimes you can be running around and you won't find water. Near water there are birds you can catch and lizards also are plenty near the shores on certain spots.



Now, to the actual review. I was so excited and happy to play this game, I really want to see this game fully out.


Pros:

-Graphics are really nice, the shadows mostly. Very accurate sunlight and moonlight interaction with the environment.
-The growing stages are cool to see how you grow up to something stronger and larger!
-Other dinos are really nicely designed and sometimes terrifying when you find them.
-You have to actualy stalk, but sometimes you're algo stalked. In one time I looked around me and saw nothing when I went to drink water. I turned around a second later to see a T-Rex charging at me from nowhere and I had no idea!


Cons:

-Some graphical bugs make me sad but I bet most of it will be polished later on. I would like to point out some I would deffinately want improved:

*On the Dakotaraptor some of the wing feathers when you see them from behind are just blocky and not refined as a shape.
*When you walk through the foilage and bushes, it would be awsome if it moved out of your way.
*Talking about foilage and bushes, the reeds and tree tops don't move at all either. Maybe make them move would improve the realistic experience.
*The birds when they fly away sometimes it glitches weirdly and just turn all over and it does not look refined at all.
*Maybe adding some night lights like fireflies here and there would also look very cool.

-Some moves and actions are a bit wonky:

*When you want to sit (C) it won't sit down immediately, sometimes it glitches and you have to press it a few times.
*The jump action (Space) it's quite delayed which makes the jump on attack hard to calculate.
*Sometimes when you get the meat out of the carcass it just rolls to the ground from your mouth and you have to get it again.

-Adding more dinos. I know it is said there will be more to play as, but the issue is there should be more dino kinds just as fauna or prey/predators. Right now you only got T-Rexes, some small raptors, more Dakotaraptors, Pachycephalosaurus and Triceratops lurking around, oh and crocodiles (at least I did not find any other). Maybe adding more smaller hervibores and bigger predators to vary would be deffinately nicer. Right now the map is quite empty.

-The targeting system is a bit strange too. When you press (E) it focuses your watch and you see hidden lizards or birds but when you run while using (E) it sometimes just goes away quicker, sometimes it won't even work properly. The blue highlight should stay on even if the prey is out of the foilage. (I got a few cases where the lizard ran out of the foilage to open space and using (E) it was not highlighted. ) Since some prey is small you can't really see it properly when you chase it down. Also, other dinos should be highlighted too since it only does highlight now the lizards and birds.

-The scaring technique for Dakotaraptors should for my opinion remain as the one you use when on first stage where you spread the wings and tail feathers to intimidate as when you're older you just screech and kick the air. It feels a bit lame and not scary or intimidating at all. Just my opinion tho.

-Maybe add the option to zoom in more to see more in detail your dino. It gets close but not close enough. 

-In one ocation I had to restart the game because when I went to drink water, my water bar just went down instead of rising up and no matter what I did it did not get back even tho it made the animation that I was drinking.

-The eating secondary bar goes down quickly, but the first one goes a bit slower. Since you got nothing else to do right now than just wait for you to need water or food, maybe make it go down quicker? There was times when I was just sitting down doing virtualy nothing because you got not much to explore, no many dinos to see around. As mentioned before, right now it is kinda empty..



All of these are just from my point of view. I hope the developers take a look. See you again at the next update or full release.",1507344288,1507344288,True,17,0,0.700041353702545166,0,False,False,True,False,,,

The market needs a good open world, scientifically accurate, dinosaur survival game. There’s nothing wrong with the concept, and I’m glad that finally a serious project is underway to realize this long overlooked idea.

The title of the game, the store presentation, the desktop icon, and even the main menu all look professionally done. Beyond the main menu and into the main game, the early access state of the project hits you like a truck!

I don’t think there’s a single finished aspect of the game – and I mean this is a bare bones project that has just barely lifted off the ground. The art, sound, and graphic design all lack a general direction at this point. Everything is just thrown together to more-or-less demo the skills of its developers and to test the feasibility of this project. I’ve been hyped for this title since its inception, but this has been a sobering reminder of what to expect from an indie title versus a full production.

That said I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that this is by far the most disappointing purchase I’ve so far experienced on Steam in its current state.

The presentation suggests a game full of imagination, creativity, adventure, and survival. This is an ambitious project that nobody so far has been able to realize, but the product so far could not be further from what the store presentation suggests.

The cover art suggests an action packed, thrilling adventure 66 million years in the making. From hatchling to adult hood, you walk every step as one of your favorite dinosaurs in a scientifically accurate prehistoric open world. Interact with advanced A.I dinosaurs, marvel at their science derived dinosaur models, and be astounded by this rigorously researched world…

… Or not.

The A.I is literally on par with the failed Jurassic Park: Trespasser project. Within my 8 minutes of gameplay, I saw a T-Rex manically walking in circles in a knee high swamp. I saw a full grown raptor walking directly into a tree, determined to phase through it. I did eventually kill a fellow hatchling raptor, which most likely would have rolled over and died on its own if the coding was there. Long story short, I saw enough examples of the A.I. in the starting area to be disappointed. It was then I wished the game was an MMO.

The dinosaur models, while they may be accurate to the most recent scientific iteration, still simply lack imagination. So does the open world environment in general. There’s no artistic flare to draw you in… the world as it exists today just lacks creativity. Just because something is “scientific” doesn’t mean it can’t be awesome. I urge the developers to take SOME liberties with their art/sound design. As it is today, there is no direction here, and it makes for an awkward and disappointing experience.

Now I’m left wondering, because I’ve seen no direction in the development thus far, will this project actually pan out? Or will it be added to the heap of indie titles that merely served as a cash grab? There’s still much to be decided.",1506911494,1506911811,False,4,0,0.457295477390289307,2,True,False,True,False,,,

B)whenever I'm thrown off, I'm thrown off right in front of the dinosaur I'm attacking, and die instantly.

I mean, as a baby dakotaraptor I was zipping in between the legs of a massive triceratops, just for fun--how cool is that! You'll be wandering around looking for food, only to encounter a t-rex doing the same thing...except for it, you're the food. 

Pros: 
--Great graphics
--Movement feels very natural, very fluid
--Good fps; seems reasonably optimized (for my system, at least)
--Very immersive, feels like you're really a dinosaur
--Good survival experience--you never feel truly safe

Cons: 
--Right now, the combat is weird because every dino (no matter how large or small) seems able to kill you in 1-2 hits, whereas it takes you like 20. Not sure if it's a problem with hitboxes, or if it's intentional--but it gets annoying.
--You can go a long time without encountering any food, especially when you're young. This can lead to being near starving to death. Again, not sure if it's intentional. 
--Occasional crashes. This doesn't really bother me that much, since it's still in development, and saving is easy.
--No narrative; your goal is just to survive. It might be better to have another option than 'survival mode', one with a story to provide focus (like, an asteroid or ice age, for example). Otherwise, the game will eventually get boring unless you constantly add new, varied dinos. 

I think the main thing the game needs is an improvement to combat--no more instant deaths, but a bitter drawn-out battle of tooth and claw. That would make it an amazing experience.

I found this game by random search for some kind of survival game as an animal with some mmo elements and although this game is in very early stage and only single player, it is exactly the kind of game which goes in such direction. Maybe the multiplayer part will be added in future?

It is fun (but also tricky) to hunt some preys or to use the parental protection as juvenile at the beginning of the game to attract some potential predators which will be killed by your ""parents"", so that you have enough to eat to go to the next age level, where you consecutively have less enemies by growing but will need more to eat and attack larger preys.
This game demands some skilled handling so that you manage to succed in the hunt for getting food or in escaping your enemies.
The atmossphere is quite tens as well immersive and quite frightening (particularly at night) when you smell the enemies but it is hard to see them in vegetation or in the shadows.

There is a lot of potential in this game and I am looking forward to the addition of other playable dinosaurs and living elements of each race. Actually there is only one playable race, when this comment was created, but 3 others have already been added (including Triceratops and T-Rex). I like the idea that this game wants to be more like a dino simulator by aiming to implement realistic fauna and flora of this epoch.

However, there is still a lot to do and to add, but the potential is big, especially if you want to find something more ""serious"" than other games of that category.",1504474224,1504474224,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True,False,,,

+ Beaux graphismes de dinosaures. 
+ Système d'interaction sociale sympa (mais encore très incomplet)
+ Faire évoluer son dinosaure depuis son enfance.
+ Un jeu calme ! Et ça devient rare.

- La physique des dinosaures est souvent foireuse. Le pathfinding de l'AI est affreux. 
- L'AI est nulle : si vous incarnez un jeune dakotaraptor et que vous suivez vos parents en vue de chasser avec eux, vous allez mourir de faim. Ils ne chassent pas. Vos parents de font rien la plupart du temps (boire, éventuellement). Pareil avec les tricératops. L'AI est débile. Ils passent leur temps à tourner en rond (en temps que juvénile, je me suis fait piétiner).
- Graphismes des eaux assez moches.
- La musique devient pénible à force d'être jouée en permanence, ce serait mieux qu'elle se déclenche contextuellement.
- Bugs de son au casque.
- Optimisation assez mauvaise, le jeu a fréquemment des micros freezes et des baisses de fps.
- Développement du jeu très lent, les attentes/promesses de multijoueur semblent inatteignables. Aujourd'hui, le développement est bénévole, à cause de l'un des développeurs qui à volé des dizaines de milliers d'euros.


Ce jeu m'intéressait tellement pour son approche simulation de vie de dinosaures, mais il est assez désagréable à jouer sur pleins d'aspects, en plus d'être pauvre en choix de dinosaures et possibilités de gameplay.

The game is still rough around the edges and I can't quite recommend this game to those who aren't intrested in helping further the game's development, or really like scientific accuracy.

With that being said I think with more polish and fixes this game could become one of the best dinosaur games on the market. I truly feel that this game represents something important for dinosaur media as a whole. It pretty common in modern media to show dinosaurs as movie monsters more akin to Godzilla than actual animals. This game manages to harness the feelings of awe and wonder that dinosaurs inherantly evoke, while at the same time presenting them as actual organisms.  In Saurian you aren't just another scaly killing machine, you are just anotehr creature trying its damnest to survive in an unforgiving but beautiful world. The world of Saurian isn't made beautiful by cutting edge graphics, its made beautiful by the elegic atmosphere of its vigourusly accurate ecosystem. The accuracy of this game isn't just a scientific statement, its a very effective aethetic choice.

However I'm afraid I still need to temper this review with some bugs I've continued to run across.


Although the scent ability for the Dakotarpator works much better now, there are still certain animals which don't appear on it at all. Crocodillians and Tyrannosaurs for me do not leave a scent trail nor are they highlighted. This is especially a problem in low light where I can just not see a Crocodillian in the grass and then get chomped by nothing, even though it was only a few feet in front of me and I was smelling the air. 

Animals no longer seem to swim indefinetly nor do they run around in circles but just seem to stop reacting at certain points. Pachycephalasaurs sometimes will just stand in place, and one time I ran into an archeoraptor and it just stood there doing nothing while I chomped on it half a dozen times. 

The raptor prey restraint seems to work better, but it is still pretty difficult to actually latch onto your prey. However I haven't been shot up 100 meters in the air yet so this mechanic is progressively getting better.",1504386268,1511292861,True,0,0,0.516122281551361084,0,True,False,True,False,,,

It's an early access game but at its earliest. So a lot of work is needed to make this game great.
It pretty much feels like they had an idea for a game, quickly created the basics and that is what this is in its current state. (The dinosaurs do look good though)

The control feels weird.
There's no real excitement, you could just go afk and only eat and drink when really needed, no one will harm you.
The map is boring, there's nothing special to explore. Some caves or something would help.
I really would love to feel the hunt, both sides, hunter and hunted but there' nothing, no feeling of danger.
The AI is so primitive. All dinosaurs walk alone, it simply looks like they just walk from a to b and if a tree is in the way, the AI dino will just keep walking in to that tree.
There's no natural feeling in this game, I want to see dinos act more like animals and less like robots.
The herbivores should walk in herds and then you could maybe try to get one of the younger/smaller ones and the leader/parents would try to protect it.
The shadows in this game are horrible. When I stand beside a forest or just a few trees, there is no shadow under the trees but when I walk under the trees, there is a solid circle shadow following me all the time, but no shadow in the rest of the forest only around me.

I played until full age, discovered most of the map and it's pretty boring all the way. 
With updated AI, more dinosaurs and somehow make the map interesting to explore, this game could be really good but there is a lot of work to do.

Glithes/bugs: When running on hills, my dino starts doing weird jumps with both legs together, it looks really weird and locks the controls for a few sec.

But i do not recomend this game for a number of reasons. First is that it takes you for ever to grow into bigger stages and while that alone is not really all that bad, the fact that even after you grow to full adult and those little $h@t stains of crocodiles can still one hit you is very aggrivating. That combined with the fact that as a small adult or younger there is almost no prey to go after. It is so scarse that it really is more of a pain than actually fun to play. There should be more prey items or more concentrations of them cause we see in the fossil records and by looking at environments that around today that most places are not that devoid of life. Also the fact that not even 5 minutes go by and I'm already starving and dehydrated is annoying. Lastly is the amount of larger critters in the game. The triceratops and pachys should have higher numbers as they travelled in herds not by themselves. The trex on the other hand should be less frequent. Trex was an apex predator and a very large one at that and so most likely had a large territory like modern apex predators. There shouldn't be a rex every five feet. the game says it prides it's self on scientific facts but i can't be the only one who noticed these things. Amazing game with great potential but not worth the 20 dollar price.

Updating to my original post, i still believe everything i said originally about the game and now have to saw i think the game is basically abandoned as the entire year of 2019 has gone by and there has been no substantial update and we are years sense the release and still can only play the stupid Dakotaraptor.

그래픽과 분위기는 공룡시대를 잘 살린듯 합니다.

얼리어세스라고 하지만 공룡을 한마리만 셀렉하게 하는것은 좀 아쉽네요.
그리고 제일 공룡같지 않은(?) 공룡인 '조류'...ㅠ_ㅠ

그럼에도 공룡시대에서 쫀쫀하게 살아가는 맛은 있는 게임입니다.
공룡의 수가 너무 적고, 먹을것도 공룡시대에 맞지 않게 적어서 
생존을 하려면 많은 거대 공룡들을 피해가며 눈치를 보아가며 
살아가야 하죠.

자신의 하기에 따라서 재미가 있을수도, 없을수도 있습니다.
아직은 많은 발전이 필요해 보이는 부분이기도 합니다..ㅎㅎ

버그들은 아직 좀 많은 편입니다.
수시로 튕김 현상. 순간순간 끊기는 렉현상. 땅속으로 들어가는 버그등등..

I finally got a game I really wanted for so many years. Where you just can be a Dinosaur (or Animal) and no damn human.
Sure, there's the Isle but that's just, well, Dinosaur PvP with survival. That's not my thing and kinda stupid.
I always wanted a game like Saurian. Where you can live their life and just survive but without being afraid of losing everything if you die because you can save the game whenever you want. I hope they keep that in. What I also wanted was a game that does not feel like a game, if you know what I mean. Without any goal but surviving and living a life.
The dinosaurs behavior isn't that good and some of them should form herds what they don't do right now. I guess that will change, too. The T-Rex's worst enemys are trees because it runs against it every time. Yes, they have to work on the AI. But there are these little details that make this game already good. You can take food with you if you're in a hurry and you shake yourself if you go out of water. I love those details. The sound is well done, too.

I had a hard time deciding on this, since I am a kickstarter backer, but I can't just ignore all the flaws. I am also aware that Saurian is still in Early Access. Thus, this is a temporary thumbs down, as I will look at the game again in a few months and change it accordingly (Check end of review for 2021 update).

So what's wrong with the game? 

It is far too buggy to enjoy and has little to no content at this moment. Here's an overview of my first few tries:
1. I spawn and my Raptorparents immediately run towards a T-Rex, getting eaten up by it in seconds.
2. I spawn and my Raptorparents run straight into a river, where they stay for the next 10 or so minutes before getting eaten up by a crocodile-ish creature.
3. I spawn and my Raptorparents run into a tree and get stuck there two seconds into the game.
4. I spawn, immediately leave my parents and fall through the ground after about 15 minutes.

Just ignoring the Raptorparents and going on your own journey from the beginning is not much better, as most of the other creatures act just as dumb. Often they just stand around and don't move at all. 

The second problem is the lack of content. Currently, there's only the Dakotaraptor playable (there's going to be six in the future) and all you do is run around, try to find small lizards (or bigger snacks when you're grown) and drink from a river now and then. I am aware that this is how dinosaur survival was most of the time but at this moment - with all the bugs and lack of content - it is not enjoyable for me. There's also only a handful of other creatures, after about two hours I've seen almost everything the game currently offers.

Of course, it also has some good points. The graphics are nice to look at and it's obvious that the developers put a lot of effort into portraying the Hell's Creek formation and its inhabitants as realistically as possible. Once in a while (sadly not very often) the dinosaur AI works well and watching them roam around is fun for a bit. The dinosaur models are extremely detailed and beautiful. For a paleontology/dinosaur fan like me, that's very enjoyable.

However, due to the lack of content I got bored after about 2 hours and the constant bugs and barely functioning AI frustrated me most of the time. For the - in comparison with a few other Early Access games - pretty high price of 20€ I definitely can't recommend it in its current state. Especially not if you want a fun, long-lasting game at this point in time. Nevertheless, if you want to support the developers by buying their product and giving feedback, join the club :) 
I hope the devs will continue to put their all into it and I'm sure I'll be able to change this review in a few months time. Until then, this is what I experienced with the game.

Edit Dec 2021: 
More than 4 years after my initial review nothing much changed. They added another playable dinosaur, the triceratops, which is even more boring to play. The herd mechanic sounds interesting in theory but turns out to be really boring. You can't move away from your herd more than 5 meters unless you want to lose them and be easy prey, so all you do is eat and drink nearby, then wait and twiddle your thumbs until you get hungry/thirsty again. In addition, the warning you get every time you dare move away from your herd for just one meter too much in order to reach the lake where you NEED to go in order to drink is rather annoying. In short: Good idea, horrible implementation.
Other than that, they tweaked a few things here and there but nothing hugely noticeable. It's a bit easier to find small prey animals now and the AI dinosaurs work a bit better.
They added an encyclopedia in the main menu which doesn't add any real value to the actual gameplay.
That's pretty much everything that noticeably changed in the last four years.
At this point I'm just really disappointed and frustrated. We get endless devlogs but the patches and updates never contain anything substantial. I've already given up on this game and am not sure I will check it out again when, or rather IF, it gets a full release.",1503299643,1640298739,False,58,9,0.678617358207702637,0,False,False,True,False,,,

1st review:
Some folks will compare it to the isle, others will say its a
twist on ark survival evolved... others say mebbe a bit of
both smashed together. Saurian however, is more amazing
then both. DONT get me wrong im a ridiculous dinosaur fan
and have loved dinosaurs since i could recall as a child an here
as a 35 yr old adult this game captured my heart LONG before
most of you steamers knew about it. Im one of the many original
kickstarter backers cause' i believe in NOT just the fantasy dino
games like ark (lets face it... theres lots of dinos from differnet
time eras tossed together in there) who have employed the
power of wyverns, unicorns an gryphons now. BUT the amazing
world of REALISM. Urvogel Games LLC has taken the time to
contact PROFESSIONAL PALEONTOLOGISTS for real research into
the game! And its based on a specific spot in a specifc era: Hells
Creek. I mean hello, sure it limits the dinosaurs you can play as
but that doesnt make it any less fun in my opinion, playing as a
dinosaur is great no matter what type you get. At least its more
then just carnivores, there are herbivores involved too! Im excited
for the future of this game, you should be too! Im going back to
making my Saurian YT vids, feel free to find them here:

Additionally, the raptor is quite difficult to control and the other dinosaurs are spread out so much to the point where I sometimes thought I was playing a Dino Walking Simulator. Granted the game is still in beta/Early Access and I knew bugs, glitches and the like were going to be common so I will give it a slight pass for some of its faults.

At the current state of the game; it is not worth the higher pricetag! While yes sure, it is definitively playable; it is not 'fun'. So don't buy this game and expect it to be on level with many modern games, because it isn't. 

However; if you want to support the developers... Or even just the concept of a realistic survival experience, please do buy this! It is amazing how many updates the development team are pumping out at the moment. And the game, despite its flaws, does what it's supposed to! It provides you with a more realistic experience of trying to survive from a hatchling to an adult. There is no pampering, no handholding and it's not an easy game... And that's why I love it.

At the current state of the game; I'd give it a 5/10. I would give it a better rating based on the concept alone, but that wouldn't be just.

I hear alot of complaints about fps being garbage, but this has not been a problem for me at all. I'm on the higher end of the pc spectrum; so the game is running mostly flawlessly even on ultra with max foliage draw distance. There are short moments of dropped frames, especially during night/day transitions, but they are short and sparse.

--------

Edit:

It has now been two years. That support that I gave has given me close to nothing in return. The map looks still basically the same. Sure, there are more prey uncontrollable species populating the small world, but there's been NO change at all to gameplay, and two years later there's still not a single more playable species.

It's with a saddened heart that I reccomend you stay away from the game. It has potential, and it's still unforgivingly hard - but honestly, you'll pay $20 for an experience that you'll most likely not even have the energy to finish.

There is no reward for the player for growing bigger, there's no reward for progress, there's no real change in gameplay not matter what size you are - apart from a single pounce attack that is buggy at best. 

I used to try to help the developers with bug-testing and I was looking forward to this games future... well... now it's the games future and there's been barely any change.

Currently one dinosaur is playable, the Dakotaraptor. A cute little microraptor with a long swooshy tail. It's definitely visually appealing to just run around and listen to the little chomping noises! 


A couple cons would be sparse the game currently feels, prey-wise. The small lizards seem to crop up anywhere in no sort of set territory locations, so they aren't even more plentiful down by the water. The birds that you can find along the shoreline are very quick to fly off, and I've yet to successfully nab one from the air. Sometimes you catch a dumb one who won't take off, and it's just a large free meal.

My biggest, biggest issue is how the T-Rex enemies do not have footstep sounds. Twice now I have just finished eating some scraps, and then a giant T-Rex comes out of NO WHERE and just swallows me whole. I don't mind them doing that - they're large ass dinos - but at least some sort of thundering footstep warnings would be nice, so I could have some counterplay.

Ark mods aren't enough. You start out as a hatchling, and so far you pretty much have to start fending for yourself immediately, hunting down small lizards and birds and avoiding predators. Let me tell you, it felt good to eat some of the smaller predators once I grew a little. Revenge!

My main criticism at the moment is lag, honestly. The game runs poor for me, and my computer isn't bad or old by any means.

I then pointed towards it and sprinted for a quick catch.  I cannot wait for better AI behavior and, of course, more dinos to play.  This game is very playable, IMO, even with the bugs and early development it is in.  As of writing this review, I could only play as a dakota raptor to age 14.  Through this it includes several sizes and colour changes of the dinosaur you play.

From my honest opinion, this game really is a no-go right now. Conceptually, it could be an awesome game. Right now, I cannot stress enough how slow the development is, and how repetitive and boring the gameplay can be right now. The developers put out ""devlogs"" every couple weeks, which describe their latest updates on game development. I've followed them since the very first devlog, and it seems to me as if the more recent devlogs have *heavily* stagnated in content. Development just feels like it's at an all-time slowdown. 

The only pros I could think of for the game are it's dinosaurs. They are constructed beautifully, and their animations flow better than most other dinosaur games I have seen. If you are interested in visuals, this game is for you. If you're interested in solid gameplay, I'd look for other options. This is due to a combination of poor optimization and stale gameplay. 

At this rate, I don't think we're ever going to be given what we were promised when we supported the game. If it takes over a year of time to implement just one playable animal, and still not have a completed Dakotaraptor by the time of it's release, imagine how long it's going to take to implement every thing they promised - 4 more playable dinosaurs after Dakotaraptor and Triceratops, a Post-Impact Survival mode, animal customization, or other planned features. As each day goes by, I feel more and more scammed by something which I had once put so much faith in. I want to see the game grow, and hopefully it does, but at this point, with 1 1/2 years into early access and still very little progress, I find it very hard to believe that it can or will.

If you're looking to help the devs and try out the game yourself, I suggest giving them that $20. Otherwise just wait until it gets updated more to your liking because currently only the Dakotaraptor is playable as I write this review.

I absolutely love Dinosaurs and this game really hit the spot for me. Being able to run around as a Dakotaraptor with a prey in your mouth gives you a sense of great immersion feeling. Eat, drink and survive as you grow from a hatchling to and adult to take on bigger dinosaurs.

Great potential for this game as long as they don't change to much of the mechanics.

Pros:
- the basic eat, water, sleep mechanics
- having to run around with my prey in the mouth to save for a meal later
- the aging/growth system very immersive
- standing on the beach looking out into the ocean watching the sun set
- Jumping on the back to attack is a very neat and interesting mechanic
- Can't wait for more DInos!

Cons(I know its still early access)
- Can't drink water from the ocean to replenish water, only in ponds or streams, (maybe thats okay)
- Seeing a dinosaur skin being ripped from the body would be a great addition instead on just disappearing when finished
- Dead Dinosaurs seem to dissapear in less than 10 minutes even if there is still food left
- Jumping on the back technique need better instructions on ""how to"" rather then just spamming the RMB
- No Controller support yet :(
- Night time colors seem to be pastel and not very pretty to look at
- By adult growth (age 6) of the DakotaRaptor seems to be a bit buggy in my opinion, needs work
- By age 7 is took me about 20 minutes just to take down a triceratops, was quite a fun, challenging, intense moment, Still a one hit kill for them to kill me even at age 7.
- Needs a better movement mechanic, walking is too slow, Pressing W should make your Dino Run, Holding SHIFT should be a Sprint action that uses Stamina, and any button like CTRL for walk or ""sneak""
- Running and jumping on a preys back needs percise timing, I always seem to jump way over my target, would be nice to implement a sneak and pounce system.
- One time I jumped on the back of a Pachy and took it down, when I did I went below the ground into water and had to swim underground until I foudn water so I could climb back up, not sure what happened but it did.
- NEEDS MORE DINOS!

The Dev's i feel like had enough time to at least throw out Dakota AND, rex, trike, and pachy playable dinosaurs. But for right now its only Dakotaraptor. 
I haven't seen recent updates from the devs, they could be working on it- but you never know.

I love the movement- and i really think they did a good job at making everything 'Realistic' but here are my downsides so far.

-If you are taller than the prey you are trying to hunt, you cant bite it.
-injured effects are still there even when you are healed up
-AI kind of go stupid when you walk near them (walking in circles or completely stopping)
-The pounce is very hard to accomplish. Needs to be some indicator on where ur going to land or more control over it.
-Almost impossible to climb trees because you go through most
-Not a lot of different terrains..
-You basically have to walk around aimlessly for an hour trying to at least get to teenage years and grind on Lizards
-Its not really enjoyable for the ammount of time you have to wait to grow up
-I do not like the fact that the ""alligators"" (since i dont know the proper name in-game, im just going to call them that)- can kill an adult DakotaRaptor very easily if you mess up a pounce on it, or cannot hit it because its lower to the ground.
-Pounce is broke, where you stay on infinitely and can just kill dinos. (This was bugged in the latest update) 
-Camera issues

So far i dont have anymore concerns, but later in the future i may make another review for when they add more things.
But yea- so far, all of my hype for this game has gone down the drain.
I really hope in the future they will add things as quick as possible. Even Alpha testers (60$+ backers) didn't really get to experiance much and it was dissapointing. People who are buying it now on steam, or have backed it for 20$ and below, are just getting the same thing that the Alpha testers were, besides the 'Test level' for the Pachy and Dakota combat.

As an early access game and a proof of concept, it nails that right down. But in its current state, it is very poorly optimised and even on my relatively decent PC I could only get 10 FPS on the lowest graphics settings.

But the concept is definitely there. You play as a baby dinosaur (in the early access version you only have one dinosaur species to pick) and your goal is to survive. It is not easy. This is hardcore survival if ever I've seen it. Plus it's dinosaurs. How can you not want to play as a dinosaur?

In its early access stage it's a bit difficult for me to recommend it in its current form but I'm going to go ahead and give it a recommendation because so far it looks very promising and I'm excited to see where the developers go from here with it!

This review may change as the game develops so watch this space!

Edited on 17/8/17: After a couple of updates since writing this, I can safely say it is somewhat easier to survive into the next life stage if you're careful. The lower graphical textures look nicer too although the optimisation is still poor. Hoping to see this in a future update!

Edited on 27/9/17: I'm starting to get the hang of the game now but PLEASE FIX THE FRAMERATE! I'm lucky if I get 10 FPS in an area with not a lot going on and it makes it very difficult sometimes.

Минусы:
1.-Оптимизация: О да, если вы-мазохист, любящий играть в 20 фпс, то эта игра(только на данном, надеюсь, этапе) для вас, игра ничем сверх некст-геновым не выделяется, но жрёт ваш FPS знатно.
2.-Ориентация ИИ в пространстве: Вылупился у счастливых дакоторапторов сыночек, потом из-за тупости дакоторапторы упёрлись в дерево до конца своих дней.
3.-скудность контента: Это, надеюсь, исправят в будущем, добавив своих ""мегакрутых"" геймплейных фичей.
Плюсы:
1.-Неплохой ИИ крокодилов и ящериц(наверное поэтому они и выжили): Ящерицы не сидят на одном месте, ожидая смерти от архерораптора или маленького дакотораптора, они быстро перемещаются и мансят(уворачиваются), кроки не будут преследовать вас по всей карте и при опасности уходят в воду.
2.-амбиции и будущие проекта: Проект ещё на стадии зарождения получил финансовый успех, а значит есть шанс, что он допилится разрабами и мы будем наслождаться красивым не багованным миром, хорошим искусственным интеллектом, и играть в пати в мультиплеере с друзьями.

I purchased this game as a gift to one of my friends who I frequently play with. My assumption was that since he and I could play together in other titles, that he would be able to run this. I was of course horribly mistaken. I neglected to take into account my own PC's capabilities and not his. Does this mean I will request a refund, just because he cannot run it? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I made my gift purchase for the sole purpose of supporting this game, as it is the only way that I can further it's development.

Now the game itself. Why do I recommend it? For it's potential. I cant recommend it as a good game (yet). As of right now the first thing I noted was the clearly unoptimized rendering of the game. I knew this going in that an unoptimized game running on Unity was likely to cause severe drops in frames, and it would be nearly impossible for a low end PC to run. For those people I do not recommend it. I also cannot recommend it to the players of other dinosaur games. If you come here with certain expectations about what the life of a dinosaur should be, expect to be disappointed, because it's likely that you wont have your expectations met. Life can be dull, many already know this. The life of any animal can be dull, but that doesn't mean that, if nothing exciting happens, it must be doing something wrong. That isn't what Saurian is about. Saurian is about survival. For me it is the release into nature that keeps me coming back. There isn't a single thing that keeps me coming back other than just being able to be lost in the life of a simulated animal.

What needs improvement? I think that with future updates, the level of interaction with the AI needs to be improved. Right now the AI feels random and misguided. Upon spotting other AI or the player, the NPC's should engage in meaningful actions. As an adult Dakotaraptor, you will find that Pachys will often stroll randomly, ignoring your presence instead of attempting to stand their ground or fleeing as necessary. Then, once a certain age is reached, you become unable to use the fantastic RPR mechanic on Pachys, as the damage you put out can simply take them down in a single bite, all while being completely immune to their attacks. This has been what is killing the game for me, the lack of a struggle at the end game. A Pachy should be entirely capable of fighting off a dakotaraptor. A well placed headbutt needs to be able to break bone. Put those two things together and you already have more interesting combat.

Again, I only recommend this game because I see its potential and I do not want to spoil its chances as an Early Access game so early in its development. However, if improvements are not made I will change my review as necessary.

I bought it, installed it, and then played it. 1.3 hours later i've decided to review it the best i can.

I will start off by listing the pros.
1. great gameplay concept (i've allways loved the idea of playing as a dinosaur)

2. higher scale of realism then ""The isle"" wich to my knowledge, gamplay-wise, is the only competetor for this game (correct me if im wrong)

3.A groth system 

4. nice graphics

And now the cons.

1. The game needs a lot of graphic optimasation as it lag's on any graphic quality's higher then medium (the pc i am using esealy reaches the requirements to play this game, and i think its less of a hardware issue then a issue with the pc having to render a massive amount of foliage)

2. Hunting as a chick ""Dacotaraptor"" is pretty hard as the only thing you can hunt are lizards that you cant see most of the time due to the foliage (i recomend to just spam the ""smell"" button and to run and bite when you close in to the preys location.)

3. theres only one playable dinosaur in game (wich is the dacotaraptor (i hope i spelled its name correctly)) at this moment in time (the developers ill add more playable dinosaurs in the future)


All in all i would say one thing about this game wich should sum it up nicealy. It should not be out yet. with that i mean that the game feels more like a demo version, or a pre alpha build then a early acces game, but i would anyways recomend buying it. Dont get me wrong, this game is pretty boring at this point in time, but it can still give you a couple of hours of fun. And unlike other early acces tittles, this game will get updated. 

I would recomend you to buy this game now if you are interested in openworld realistic dinosaur simulators, but only if you have the patience to wait a half/one year then you will probably be amazed by what this game will become, and then you can say that you were one of the first people to buy this game, and that you followed this game since it came out, but for noe this game is not really worth what it costs. you can also buy The isle for the same price, but i personally would prefer this game as the devs seem pretty cool and the The isle devs seem to not listem to their comunity.

all in all. id say this game is still not worth it yet, as it is more like a ugly duckling, but if you wait and give it time you will recive a beutifule swan. I recomend this game and would recommend the devs to work a bit on the graphics optimisation.

The controls.  SUCK.

The camera flings around wildly when you're trying to look around, even with the sensitivity cranked down.

Prey is sparce and limited.  You're just as likely to die of starvation as you are to other preditors.  And when you do find prey (lizards) they are nearly impossible to catch.  Ive tried chasing, ive tried standing still and waiting as some suggest, but to no avail.  I starved with a lizard running over my feet that I had been trying to kill for 15mins.

I hated Ark because I couldn't even make it off the beach I died so much. to me, dying without progression is no fun at all. That being said, until recently, my PC's had a 100% mortality rate. This game is unforgiving and brutal. 

 [b]It will not be for every one. [/b]

[u]WHAT I LIKED[/u]
I found it engaging even though right now, in early access, it is sparcely populated and not everything is behaving as desired. The animal models are well designed and georgous. Since I have an older machine, I'm running it on low settings, but the vegetation and water still look acceptable to me. Running around as a little raptor against all the odds staked against me evokes a sense of accomplishment and elation when I've overcome what's killed me over and over again. I squeaked happily as I grew for a second time, only to die from starvation once again. (my last few attempts at hunting those damned lizards did not go in my favor.)

[u]WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE[/u]
The game environment and world is unforgiving. You will die a lot. You will starve a lot. You will be killed by other dinos. Your parents will ignore you entirely - at least untill you get big enough. Once you manage to survive past babyhood, you will still die alot, likely to starvation. Your biggest obsticles will be eating and not being eaten, and you will die a lot. The world is currently not terribly populated and it's easy to go a long time without seeing or smelling anything. There is also nothing else to do currently than eat, drink and survive. 

Even with all of that, I'm going to keep playing because as challenging as it is for me to keep my poor Dakotaraptor alive, I want to see what else is coming. I want to play as other species. Currently, only the Dakotaraptor is available, but five other species will be available at some later date, as well as multiplayer and a more lively world. The developers have stated that it will get better, eventually. The evolution will take a couple years but it's been promised to evolve.

This game is gorgeous, and the time the devs have spent researching the Hell Creek formation and bringing it to life really show. The game is sort of bare, there aren't many creatures moving around, but those that do are very fluid.

The controls are relatively simple. Movement doesn't feel as fluid as it does in some other games but it is easy to adjust to. The UI could use a little work, it's really simple right now, but it gets the job done.

The AI is a little strange and unpredictable (but what animal isn't?) I have seen critters walking into trees which kind of breaks the experience a little.

Again there is a clear lack of content. Only 1 of 6 planned dinos are currently playable, and there is only a handful of other creatures in the world around you. I spent a lot of time wandering the forest with nothing else in sight, even small critters for me to eat were pretty scarce. The game is currently in development, and there has already been a bug fix patch within a week of release, so the content should flow relatively quickly. The devs are super open and really interact with the community which is great to see.

TL;DR: This game is sort of bare, but the premise looks great. If you love dinosaurs I would highly recommend picking it up. Otherwise, put it on your follow list and watch the development and pick it up when it has more stuff for everyone to do.",1502247701,1502247701,True,7,0,0.569185435771942139,0,False,False,True,False,,,

As interesting as the concept sounds, I can't see this game being playable much beyond a few hours at best. It looks ok (until it gets dark, then it just looks weird, not sure if the dev is trying to simulate some kind of night vision, but it looks kind of like the gamma is jacked up at night), and I know it sounds weird, but during the day everything is just too green, I feel like there needs to be a little more colour variety. The game runs smoothly enough for an early access title (occasional screen freezes here and there). But, you pretty much just run around a jungle eating and drinking. I lost my parents on the first day, because I ""rested"" without reading the hint properly, my fault entirely, but it seemed like a strange time to let you know you can rest to recover stamina, I assumed it meant sit down and you recovered it faster, had I read on I would have noted that 8 hours pass when you rest, so my parents peaced out. I then spent the next 18 minutes running about trying to find water in the dark, this wasn't made easy by the confusing music that made me think I was being persued the whole time. I guess the music was supposed to be creating tension, but it just served to confuse me. Then a pachycephalosaurus stepped on me and I died.

[h1][u]PLEASE RUN![/u][/h1]

I found, as with most Unity games, the controls were sluggish. Jumping appeared to be something that worked randomly. I couldn't get a feel for when it should and shouldn't work, like there was some kind of condition that needed to be met before I could jump (ie. running at a certain speed, having a certain amount of stamina, an invisible cooldown) And for some reason, for such a small, light and agile critter my dakotaraptor appeared to have incredible difficulty getting up to running speed. I mean, I would expect a predator like this one to be able to accelerate to full speed in a very short time, but it was like trying to roll start a locomotive.

[h1][u]TEACHING AIDE?[/u][/h1]

Perhaps the developers are going for an edutainment angle with this title. They do repeatedly mention  the maticulous care spent on getting the game as ""scientifically correct"" as possible, even down to accurately reporoducing the landscape and ecosystem. As mentioed before, as a game, I mean something to do that's fun, this seems to have very little replayability, or playability for that matter.

[h1][u]PROS & CONS[/u][/h1]

Pros
[list]
[*] Runs well enough for an early access title.
[*] Fairly decent graphics, the animal models look nice, as does the foliage.
[*] Interesting concept.
[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*] Sluggish (sometimes plain unresponsive) controls.
[*] Seems to lack playability, there's not much to the game other than running about.
[*] The environment, although supposedly faithfully recreated, is kind of bland, lacks colour variety, basically a sea of green.
[*] The price point is quite high considering the content.
[/list]

[h1][u]CONCLUSION[/u][/h1]

Only having spent 20 minutes playing Saurian, it might be arguable that I lack time spent in the game to make a valid judgement of it. But having only played the game for 20 minutes, I feel like I've pretty much experienced everything Saurian has to offer.  For the price of $20, there's games on Steam that have far more to offer. Although, if you're a seriously die hard dino fan, you might find this title inexhaustably entertaining. I myself am a huge dinosaur fan, always have been since I was a very young child, but this game is lacking any real hook to keep you playing it. It seems to me it would become tedious and repetateive very quickly. It's certainly a neat concept, if not wholely unique or original, but that's just not enough to get it over the line for me. Overall, not really a rewarding or fun experience.

So, because of this, I can't really recommend it. Maybe if it was a sub $10 (like $7 at the most) game, I could, but for $20, I think the devs are grasping. I think I will be getting a refund.",1502246487,1502256753,False,5,0,0.495447129011154175,1,True,False,True,False,,,

I also recently learned from someone that this takes place in Hell Creek formation during the Cretaceous period.

(Will update as necessary.) I was a kickstarter backer for this game.

Positive recommendation based on understanding these pointers:
1. Only buy the game if you are into experiencing the long term route of seeing how it develops! As of right now, there isn't that much content to experience, the game is very bare bones as well as has a lot of glitches and roughness. I am on a very high end PC and am experiencing occasional performance issues. Lower end machines will likely struggle.

2. The game is dependent on simulation of life gathered from currently known scientific fact and as such relies heavily on a ""make your own adventure"" style gameplay experience. A lot of it's charm comes from as accurately as possible depicted dinosaurs.

If you're not into the abovementioned thematics, or want a more finished product, this might not be a game for you right now. Wait until it's further into development. That being said, if you're a hardcore dinosaur fan, you'll probably have a good time.

Now that's out of the way, here are some of my opinions:
The game is very atmospheric, you feel constantly on your guard which gives you a sense of belonging into the game world. Night time can even be a bit spooky, since it gets hard to spot any predator that's hunting you... And at first you also don't know all the things that are out there, so you're especially wary. Immersion is already rather good! I think going forward the game needs to push this angle to keep a grip on the player.

That being said, one thing that breaks the immersion are the way the controls respond as of right now. They're not terrible by any means, but very rough in some spots. You don't always feel in tune with your character, and especially at times some input may lag or not register at all and you're not sure why it happens. Did I do something wrong as a player, or did the game just buckle. These are minor complaints all in all, but do erode the immersion aspect of the game ever so slightly, when at times you feel like you're struggling to get your character to do what you need it to do. Some more fluidity and responsiveness would go a long way.

My other bigger issue with the game right now is the map. Meanwhile it's not terrible, it doesn't particularly stand out in any spots either. There doesn't feel to be much to see, which in turn doesn't make you feel like exploring. I understand the importance of keeping it close to real life simulation to hold true to the game's intent, but looking around, life has a lot of variety. I hope going forward the developers will add a bit more character to the environment. Some more distinct landmarks, small streams, boulder formations strewn around and that kind of thing...  I'm not sure if I'm expressing my thoughts on this matter very well, but let me summarize by saying that the world needs to feel a bit more full and alive.

The feature for using scent to hunt is currently a bit underwhelming and I find myself playing mostly without it, relying more on watching my character's head movements and listening for skittering sounds. Both of which, are actually very neat ways of incorporating your senses into gameplay.

Saurian is definitely worth your try if you're open minded towards experimental games and don't mind it if things aren't running smoothly straight away. The models for the animals are very beautiful as are their animations, so I got myself a bunch of good time from just admiring those. Saurian is trying to make an educational piece in a way that has quality as well as entertainment incorporated, and for these reasons alone it already deserves praise.",1502043942,1502043942,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I bought this game on kickstarter, They had the objective of having the game release in 2 years if they were able to achieve the amount of money needed. They not only achieved that, they got more, which would be used for 2 more playable dinosaurs and a multiplayer function. Both things to be added to the game after the release. 3 years have passed, the game looks pretty much the same. Have little more AI than the last time, but still no growth stages for them. No big changes to dinosaur behaviour neither, just a few. The game is close to be abandoned. The devlogs are a joke. Still only one playable dinosaur. They probably already wasted the kickstarter money so, take your own conclusions about the likely future of the game. I wish i am wrong. I am really sad making this review, cuz i was really hyped for this game and it was a game with caracteristics i was looking for a long time.



Previous Review:
Ok so this is my first review on a game, which shows how much i expect of this game!

Ok so to start until one day ago i was definetly gonna make a bad a review of the game, but the 1st patch made me change my mind. Even though there are a lot of things that i will point out, that in my opinion still makes this game not worth the money it costs right now or really need work on.

Even if it this only in Early Access the game lacks to much content, The devs before the realease kept saying that you would have a full experience as a dakotaraptor on the EA. This is not quite what happens in the game. For now Dakotaraptor is the only dinosaur that is playable, so you spawn as an hatchling and grow to adult. The problem here is that you still dont have much AI. So after u played a couple of hours, you experience all that the game as to offer so far. Now why dont you have the full experience? because the lack of AI, and because the AI needs some work done. 90% of the times your parents die, so you are on your own from the start. So you need food. Or you hunt or you scavenge. But with the lack of AI food dead bodies are rare and the only living creature you can hunt as an hatchling is the lizard, which are terribbly hard to see in the game bbecause of the foliage. We definetly neeed more AI, not only more dinossaurs but more diferent ages of dinossaurs like hatclings.


Now about the visuals, graphics and sound. There were some problems in this part of the game, but this is all expected in EA games, and the devs were fast to fix the max things they could.

Visuals are great, but need a bit of otimizations as fps drop quite a few times with no reasons for it to happen.
Sound is amazing too, gives the right feeling when playing the game.

So after all this should you buy the game? Definetly, but maybbe just not right now. We need more AI to make the game worth the money, as right now it has not much content to offer as u experience everything too fast...

Nach 3 Jahren habe ich mir mal gedacht naja schaust mal rein da hat sich doch bestimmt was getan mal... 

Fazit: Absolut keine Kaufempfelung!!!!!
Nach 3 Jahren hat sich 0 was getan nix rein garnix... ist gibt immer noch diesen einen Federvieh zu spielen wobei ich sagen Muss Federn haben da garnix zu suchen aber naja... 
Aber echt 0 .keine Entwicklung nix absolute leere! TRAURIG und mega ENTÄUSCHEND!
Da hat THE ISLE mehr auf den Kasten als dieses Game hier....

EDIT: 20.11.2020

Nach etlichen Jahren hat man mal ein Dino mehr zu spielen als den Dakotaraptor
Es kam der Triceratop.
Was mir gleich auffiel bzw erst jetzt ist warum zum Teufel Bewegen sich die Triceratops als wenn sie auf eine Ninjaschule in der Kanto Region waren???
Leute dieses Tier Wog weit mehr als 5 Tonnen da kann es doch nicht sein das sie Laufen wie auf Federn... 
An sich Spielt sich der Triceratop fast gleich wie der Raptor nur das es halt der gegenspieler halt ist.. Es kann recht schnell öde werden da man nur rumläuft und Frisst frisst frisst aber da muss man drüber weg sehen denn das war das Leben eines Pflanzenfressers 90% Fressen 5% Schlafen 5% Trinken.
An sich hat sich aber sonst nix weiter geändert bzw nix besonderes, die Herden Laufen immer noch von Punkt A zu B und von B zurück zu A 
Mir persönlich fehlt einfach absolut das feeling wie man es bei The Isle bekommt...
Zum anderen ist mir noch aufgefallen warum zum henker hat ein Adult Trike Hörner die nach unten gebogen sind? Müssten die nicht genau anders rum gebogen sein? 
Weil es gab auch eine etwas kleinere Art mit herrunter gebogenen Hörnern.

Fazit: Immer noch keine Kaufempfehlung meiner seits aus da ich sehr stark befürchte das das nächste größere update weitere 3 Jahre dauern wird.. wenn überhaupt noch ein kommen sollte.
An diesen Spiel muss noch ne ganze menge passieren und in schnelleren Abständen langsam wenn es überhaupt noch was werden will.

I love what the developers are trying to accomplish. I was a KickStarter supporter. And I say with certainty that this game will improve--and when it does, I will be excited to change my review to positive. So why is it negative right now?

""Early Access"" is something that far too many developers abuse, and far too many players use as an excuse for poor content. ""You can't judge it now because it's in early access,"" is invalid. When a game launches to Early Access, the whole point of it is to criticize it. You can't really judge a game that is in pre-alpha stages, because there is a lot to do, and it is in a closed group of testers / developers. But Early Access is meant for games that have left that stage and are ready for the public. Saurian is not ready for the public to take part. It is clearly in a pre-alpha state, but launched in Early Access regardless. This is what makes it tough to judge. You can't really say much because it is so underdeveloped, but on the other hand, it has fully launched for the public to play. So I'm left with judging the actual decision of bringing Saurian live.

Saurian has many issues. From piss poor optimization (30-50 fps + big stutters on a GTX 1070--which is well above recommended specs) to a massive amount of gamebreaking or simply obnoxious bugs. There is also a great lack of content and pretty mediocre AI. Obviously, most Early Access games will have similar types of issues, just not to this extent. There are certain expectations that Early Access games should live up to--it's not really meant to be a dumping ground for demos. Saurian is not ready for Steam, and certainly not the $20 price tag.

I suggest waiting until massive improvements are made. I believe that I will get the opportunity to change my review, and I look forward to that day. But it is not today.",1501968823,1501968823,False,53,0,0.603522360324859619,7,False,False,True,False,,,

YES I KNOW IT'S EARLY ACCESS
GOT THIS GAME AS A GIFT 
UPDATED ON 15 AUGUST

That outta the way, lets get to why I can't recommend this game in the current state.
I mean, it works. You can age and survive just well in the current game (my game time of 3.3 hours shows how long I needed to get from baby to adult. This is plus/minus a few, since I died a lot and tried things out) but that's about it. It gets fairly boring after a while, due to bugs and currently boring environments/gameplay. 

Just to name a few current issues:
-The Juvenile Dakota has model issues with false weightpaint, the hatchling looks very messy and has almost no details
-Hunting is hard due to jumping delay and the pounce being hard to control. 

My biggest issue though, is with the accuracy thing that this game's aiming for. I am sure that these guys put in all their effort to study scientific accuracy of dinos, plants and environment of Hell Creek and have implemented the basics of that in this game.
However, I am told that Dakotaraptors are bad parents right at the start, having the two supposed parents walking off from me and my sibling to handle their own duties.  (Most birds of prey actually share tighter bonds, but I do not know if this applies to Dakota raptor parents also, so I will give them that.)
I get that we start in an age stage where hunting becomes a thing for us so that it doesn't start boring and I do not expect to literally be fed lizards to survive either... however, since birds and our fluffy Dakotaraptors are related, I think that they might share some traits with current day birds as well, given that evolution picks and chooses traits that ensure survival and reproduction... and that most birds of prey will take care of their young, until they are almost teens or even adults themselves, meaning that this is probably a favorable trait to keep. I may be wrong, but I also do not think that parents will turn on their own fledglings if they don't run away fast enough as hatchlings. To me, that's just not.. well... accurate. 
Of course it's hard to determine how an extinct animal actually behaved, but it feels more like an attempt to get out of actually programming in AI that cares for you or acts as if it wants to teach you how to hunt. Future updates will tell if this is true or not, since there are still five more dinosaurs to be presented that might have caring parents.

The stamina issue has been also discussed in the forums, but from what I read, Dakotaraptors were big, but lightweight predators made for sprints or general fast traversing. If the argument is that ""sprinting"" means ""A small stamina bar"" I can understand that. But let us take an animal made for sprinting: The Cheetah. This may sound extreme at first, but this is an animal with top speed and little stamina, meaning it is the highest extreme in the ""top speed"" = ""low stamina"" issue. Even an animal that powers itself out with an up to 110km/h sprint, can run between 300-500 meters whilst sprinting.
This should give the Dakotaraptor, who is made for far smaller speeds, have a bit more than the current ~100 meters maximum to run.
And it is also said the Dakotaraptor was most likely an ambush predator. If so and this is the reason the stamina is so low, then give it a way to actually ambush. There is no way to sneak up on prey, no way to make sure it does not see you, be it watching the direction of the wind to hide your scent, rolling in things to hide your scent or even just to crouch and wait for prey to stroll your way.

I adore that scientific accuracy is being taken into this game, but it doesn't feel like it at the moment, because too many things appear to just not be thought of in the long run. If and how this ends up later on the development, I can not say and I will gladly wait it out, because I do have my hopes that this game WILL turn out good.

成長すれば体も大きくなり大きな獲物も狩れるようになる、、のか？

コンセプトは良いがとりあえず狩れる獲物がほとんど居なくてゲームとして成り立っていない。
唯一狩れるはトカゲのみ。成長してもトカゲのみ。
草食恐竜のパキケファロサウルスでさえ異様な強さで、鼻先に触れるだけで何のリアクションもなしに即死する。
自機であるラプトル君だけが以上に脆いのかもしれないが、パキケファロサウルスが水辺てワニ数体を皆殺しにしていたり、
トリケラが2秒でレックスを殺しているあたり、たぶんこの世界の草食恐竜は強力な毒を持っている。

何度も言うがとりあえずゲームとして成り立っていない。
最序盤はトカゲで食いつなぐというのはまぁ自然な流れだが、成長すると足が遅くなりそれすら困難に。この時点で自力で狩れる獲物が同じラプトルのみになるので、兄弟を探して食べるゲームに。
もしくは草食恐竜について行って返り討ちにあった肉食恐竜の死体を漁る・・・。
肉食恐竜ってなんだっけ？

とまぁ草食恐竜が無双している様な書き方をしたが、実際のところ、そもそも恐竜が全然居ないのでお互いの接触すら凄く稀なこと。
ただただ草食恐竜の隣でボケーっとしているだけになる。

だが心配無い。
そもそも満腹ゲージに何の意味もないので餓死したりはしない。
一切何も食べなくても成長できる。
ただボケーっとして成長するのを待とう。

While at the moment. Saurian is just tech demo basically. It looks far better then ark survival and Dino's do look more realistic, but there is a lot that still needs to be worked on and added to the game before you can really judge this.  With over 3,200+ hrs in ark survival and my own server. I can this is already looking and running better then ark.  There is a lot bugs and issues current with saurian and is no where near what the finished product will be like.  I hope they add better AI and Dino's act more real. Roars for passive and aggressive,  hopeful also have proper herds and what not. Breeding, raising your young and maybe some kinda level system, as start as child and grow to mature adult. 
Generally, it runs not to bad on my i7 3770k 3.5 GHz, 16 GB ram, SDD, GTX 980ti Sc at max settings for 1080p/60+ fps on window 7 64bit.  So far I'm very impressed, there are some performance issue, but not too bad. but as stands now. 
It's just tech demo.  Wait 6-8 month and then we'll see where it is and how much they added.  For now I'd say hold off.  But if you enjoy anything with Dino's,  I'd say get it now and wait for get better.   
My openly complain is the map is kinda blah,  few ponds and big open map with nothing to see, trees and shrubs. They look decent.  But the map is lacking verity ATM. Need wind, storms, land marks. Different region, 
One thing ark does have is way better map, at least on center map.  Hopefully it get better,  
Will update this when more stuff is added after year or so.

The game isn't very well optimized, which, at this early stage, is understandable yet still gets a negative mark from me. More than once a game has loaded in the background quite a while before it's able to be played, and once the loading screen was gone I was greeted with a 'game over' screen because I was killed before I could even play. The game is surprisingly lacking visually, with shadows that are harsh, bizzarely pure black and jpeg-esque (my graphical settings are currently on the second highest setting, and it looked the same on the highest). Trying to hunt the tiny lizards, the only thing that won't try to kill you back, is sort of a gamble when you get frame drops and lose your prey in the flat black underbrush. 

Speaking of prey...It feels weird to say, but the game feels oddly balanced? The Dakotaraptor dies if it gets caught up in a stiff breeze. Not just as a young stage, either. On my most successful run so far, my parents teamed up on and were both 
 one-shot by some jerk crocodile that walked away unscathed. I mean, I got a free meal out of it, so it wasn't all bad, but it was kind of eye-opening as to how weak the 'raptor is even as an adult.

Just all around, it's not too terribly fun to play at the moment. Watching the dinosaurs go about their business is very cool, though. I found myself spending a while creeping after a t. Rex hoping to steal some of its leftovers when I saw it stalking prey, only to be disappointed when it swallowed its meal whole. I saw another sort of raptor bully a Pachy without actually trying to attack it. I nipped at a Triceratops' ankles and booked it, watching over my shoulder as it chased me down. There is so much potential for when more playable dinos are added that I can't help but be exited about it. 

I will be watching this game closely for updates just as I had before it was released onto Steam, but at the moment find myself more frustrated than entertained when playing it.

It does have promising prospects, but it is by no means ready to be sold yet.
Second of all, I have an awful PC which will affect my experience immensely.

Now, Saurian is a game I've been looking forward to. So, naturally, I needed it. I'm going to tell you how my first tries with the game went.

I got in, everything lagged to hell and back. Not only that, but the looking around with the mouse was hell. Okay, into the menu, go reduce camera sensitity. Weirdly, the menu when playing lags just as bad as the game itself. Never really had that before. Strange. I manage to return to game and actually start moving around. Moving around feels weird and clunky. I don't mind having to slow down after you build up momentum, but I have to build UP walking momentum?
 I'm not a vehicle. My first step should be just as good as all my steps afterwards. Nevermind. I could move, albeit sluggishly. I look at my family. Too bad on my first attempt mama, papa and my two siblings were frozen. Immediate restart. 

Okay! They move now! Very, very slowly. Even slower than me at walking pace. I have a feeling this was my PC chugging because they practically walked on the spot. I decided I'd abandon mother and explore. She was getting nowhere and I needed a drink and something to eat. After fighting with the camera to settle it in the direction I wanted to go and successfully having just a drink, it was dark. I couldn't find my way back to mama. I figured sniffing might show her, but no. Oh well. It was too dark for me to make anything out anyway. I slept. When I woke, mama and the family was entirely gone. Well, shit. I was also on the verge of starving. Well, double shit. I could see a pachy, but I was a fucking smol bean. I wasn't about to eat that. Another small raptor wandered up beside me. It looked flashy. Very snazzy. It was also chill. Well, there was my best bet at food, so I bit it. I died. Restart.

Well, now we were parked by the water's edge. Everyone was moving slower than before. No biggie. It'd be fine, I'd stay by mama this time. Mama went to the water. Mama got in the water. Mama abandoned the AI children who couldn't keep up. Nevermind them, I can swim! And holy shit, mama moves at a decent pace in the water! Not as slow as on land. Fantastic. I followed mama. We had a great time swimming together until mama remembered she was mentally retarded and began swimming in circles through a mangrove tree or whatever was growing in the water. I stared. I hoped I didn't have whatever she had. I quit. 

Fin.

I do very much hope that the game recieves plenty of optimisation and that the AI can actually become intelligent. But, for the moment, it simply isn't that way.

-------
Edit:

After messing around with the game a little more the game finally decided to run a little more smoothly. I can now play, albeit in a very jerky mannner and I can't enter an area with too many trees. But I can play. 

So, with that said.

The game is still slow to run, understandably on my PC. something confusing was that any stage below adult tended to have steps that slipped into one another, whereas the adult didn't and moved at a more bearable walkspeed.
In terms of food, it's hit and miss. Sometimes you can be in an area with plenty of food about and be just fine and other times you're going to starve. You're best bet is to find some water source and wait for something to come to you. As a baby dakotaraptor you're absolute best bet is to stick with your siblings and cannibalise them. So be thankful you have some siblings because you're parents are probably going to get themselves killed very quickly. The AI absolutely sucks and is by far the thing that needs the most work in this game.
Other than your siblings, you'll struggle to find food because lizards are almost impossible to catch Everything else will kill you immediately and your parents are long gone. You can always eat their corpses. Except, you can't because they've probably already disappeared. Corpses don't hang around very long and you don't know when they're going to disappear because they don't have decomosition/eaten stages.
But other than that, the models are fine, the map is fine, eating and drinking is easy to do, the game forces you to be very weary for better of for worse, which I don't personally mind and it's doing okay. There's definitely worse pre-alphas out there. Don't get me wrong, don't buy it unless your intention is to support the devs more. It's not something that should be sold at the price it is yet, especially after the amazing kickstarter it had.

Onto the other bad points as it stands.
- Glitches. It's in pre-alpha release so expect these around every corner.
- You're dead if anything hits you at dakotaraptor juv/sub-adult stage. It's basically impossible to hunt herbivores with my kind of performance until adult stage. You have to rely on killing other dakotaraptors or whatever the other little raptor is or scavenging if you happen to find  some tasty corpses.
- The stats drain so fast. I think they might've slowed the food down at least since there was an update released. I'm actually pretty happy with hunger now, it's more thirst now. I can't really explore much because I have to keep running up hills then down to a water source then up and down and up and that is very tedious.
- Progression is rather fast. I wouldn't be opposed to slowing progression down just a bit more. I'm thankful that it isn't painfully slow (because the game only plays when you're on it and you don't progress when sleeping. You must play it.) but it could do with coming down a notch.

- The AI is entirely braindead. I can't say anything positive for the AI simply because it's just so basic and slow to do even basic things. I'm expecting them to add and work on the AI because it really is what is going to make the game work in the long run given how many bots there are. But as it stands, everything moves downhill to a water source and swims about in it in circles until some croc comes and eats it. If you bite something, it attacks you, might chase you for a second, then forgets you ever existed. Nothing runs away despite there being a threat in the area. Most things just tend to walk up to a trex and die if one hapens to be there. Trexes will immediately fight  upon seeing eachother as well - I assume thing might change later down the line to have a bit more of a roaring contest go on before a fight breaks out to see if things can be settled peacefully. In terms of drinking, things manage but then they tend to step into the water and go into their circle of death for some reason. In terms of eating they half-manage. On the rare occasion you see something take a bite it'll probably be fien, but occasionally they'll jsut sit and stare. In general, the AI just isn't any fun and is just about functioning. It isn't a nice experience to play with an AI that's just so unaware of everything around it though. Each bot goes about its own little life with no interaction with anything else except food, water and maybe you.

So, all in all, no. I can't recommend it as a game. It is good for something that isn't even an alpha and it functions, eventually. But it's not worth the pricetag and if you buy it, really only consider it something to support the devs with.",1501860649,1502043774,False,5,0,0.503521084785461426,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Pros:

+Dinosaurs look stunning, and so does the plants, and whole map. Lots of research has gone into designing them.
+Sound-design is very good. It captures well the prehistoric era (or atleast how we think it sounded back then).
+Controlling dinosaur has always been the clumsy side of this genre. Being able to turn it around while standing still is very useful.
+I think time it takes to age is ok, not too long, not too short.
+It's relaxing to play offline dinosaurgame for change.
+dinosaurs have feathers.

It's really hard to say anything about cons at this point. Ofcourse there is bugs, lag spikes and crashes, but they aren't anything that uncommon in Early Access games.

Overall, if the game seems interesting, I warmly recommend it, if you don't mind it being in early access.

I was so excited for it to come out. But this game is unplayable.
I know my computer isn't the most reliable in the world, but it has worked pretty well and was able to handle other games such as the Isle, but this game is the bane of my computer. Even on the lowest graphic settings, it's unplayable. Even when I made the resolution as low as possible, it still unplayable. It doesn't even reach 3 fps. The camera sensitivity is absurdly high, the slightest nudge to my mouse and the camera flies into the ground. The camera blur is sickenly high, and even when the game eventually loads, with the gameplay sounds playing in the background, even when your little dinosaur loads and you can play it, the screen takes an extra 10 minutes just to get rid of the loading screen. And when the game crashes, it crashes HARD. It's crashed twice, and both times nearly broke my computer. The screen would go completely blue (not quite the bluescreenofdeath blue, but unsettling nonetheless) and I would have to manually turn it off and on again by holding down the off button until it makes a disturbingly loud click sound. And the delay in the gameplay is atrocious. And I know I can't speak for everyone on these issues, but they have made this game a nightmare to play.
The graphics may be beautiful, but when the issues are that bad, there's not really any defense.

Gioco che consiglio solo ad appassionati di dinosauri estremamente pazienti con gli early access perché questo è quello che il gioco offrirà col tempo:
- 6 dinosauri giocabili, ognuno con i suoi stadi di crescita e caratteristiche.
- Moltissime specie AI ad arricchire l'ambiente ( e il vostro stomaco ).
- Ambiente di gioco molto accurato; tutte le piante e animali presenti sono realmente esistiti nella Hell Creek.
- Personalizzazione del proprio dinosauro per colori e caratteristiche fisiche particolari.
- Modalità multigiocatore ( con inclusi AI ) che spero sia una carneficina e non un facciamo amicizia con gli erbivori.
- Modalità hardcore per quelli che amano le sfide, con AI più intelligente e in cui morire significa ricominciare dall'inizio.
- Un comparto grafico carino con anche una modalità vr ( in futuro eh ).

Questo è quello che offre attualmente......:
- 1 dinosauro giocabile e non molti animali AI, AI fra l'altro scadente, non ci sono interazioni interessanti da vedere fra gli animali in giro oltre a qualche combattimento buggato e decisamente non realistico, sembrano si comportino più robot con ordini precisi che animali.
- Necessaria una gtx1080 o simile per giocare, qualunque altra scheda meno potente ve lo regge a stento o così così, e francamente dopo averlo visto ad ultra non mi sembra che abbia chissà che graficone da richiedere una gtx 970 o più.
- Varie persone avevano pre-ordinato la versione Mac più di 1 anno fa, ma dopo quasi 1 anno dall'uscita su steam non si è ancora visto nulla, nè gli sviluppatori ne hanno parlato molto ( non che ci si potesse aspettare chissà cosa da un team del genere ).
- No multyplayer, no personalizzazione, no altro, rigiocabilità pari a 0.
- Sviluppatori troppo lenti con gli update e che hanno rilasciato il gioco troppo presto in uno stato pietoso, al punto che creò problemi ai pc della valve richiedendo 3 giorni per approvare il gioco su steam. Update che non arrivano mai prima di 2-3 mesi e aggiungono sempre pochi contenuti, o almeno non abbastanza da giustificare l'attesa. Ci vorranno anni e anni per completare SOLO lo sviluppo del gioco base, e probabilmente altrettanti per aggiungere il multigiocatore, il vr e altro, e siamo già a quasi 1 anno dalla sua uscita senza nessuna miglioria particolare, sembra quasi che perdano più tempo a fare minuscoli devlog ( più di 50 per l'esattezza ) che i contenuti del gioco stesso. I contenuti aggiunti fin'ora sono un pizzico di ottimizzazione, vari animali ai ( e meno male, l'animale nuovo che esce ad ogni update è l'unico motivo che mi spinge ancora ad avviarlo ), e varie altre cose abbastanza inutili.
- Ricordate quello che ho detto prima su update e ottimizzazione? Bene, perché l'ultimo update che ha richiesto 2 mesi e mezzo per essere preparato ha distrutto quel poco di ottimizzazione e sballato i livelli di forza degli animali. La situazione era così tragica che l'update è stato praticamente rimosso facendo tornare il gioco allo stadio precedente. Già di per se gli early access sono delle test version, ma dopo la rimozione dell'ultimo update è uscita una versione testing ( con in essa incluso l'ultimo update ) dove i giocatori devono aiutare i devs a trovare il bug che ha incasinato tutto. La test version della testa version, ridicolo. Dopo un mesetto e mezzo circa il problema del bug è stato risolto, per fortuna, ma l'ottimizzazione mi sembra ancora un po regredita rispetto a prima.

Il gioco ha davvero del potenziale e una bellissima idea dietro con un'incredibile cura del dettaglio, purtroppo distrutto da un team di sviluppatori troppo piccolo e decisamente incompetenti ( tranne un paio di loro ), e onestamente mi sembra un vero spreco che un progetto simile che ha raccolto più di 220.000 dollari su kickstarter sia gestito da questo team scadente, fra l'altro la fanbase di lecchini con i paraocchi incapaci di muovere anche la minima critica con la scusa dell'early-access non aiuta. Continuerò a modificare la mia recensione durante ogni update sperando di poterla cambiare in positiva, ma se fra qualche anno la trovate ancora negativa cercate altro.

That said.

Pouncing, once you get the hang of it is super satisfying.

The wait for this game has been long and daunting but the result was a decent demo of things to come but, let me get some of the negatives out of the way. *Note* half of the stuff im about to complain about aren't fair since most is subject to change.

*****Negatives That I Hope Are Fixed In Time*****

Optimization 

- Super early access, the demo (thats what it feels like) surely wasnt ready for release, when i heard Saurian was being made public finally after years of waiting i thought we were getting a gorgeous looking game thats somewhat smoothly optimized. But suffice it to say i was dissapointed, the transition between afternoon to night is a laggy nightmare and i ended up dying constantly during those time periods.

Graphics

- foliage textures,  this is mostly subjective but it is increasingly frustrating to see how plain everything looks, some of the larger trees look like rip offs of modern day trees under a ""scientifically accurate"" blanket. The trees have really poor textures even under ultra settings (There is no noticeable difference between two of the top graphical settings). You would not be able to distinguish a regular piece of foliage from the games own assets. Makes you feel like they wasted time working on their own when could have imported better looking assets from somewhere else. 

Gameplay 

- Ai in general,  first time i played the game, i spawned near a river where my parents rushed to their deaths by attacking a pachy on the other side. The parents Ai puts no emphaces on survival as every time i respawn, the parents will charge to their deaths and the baby dakota Ai will often just stay frozen in place, waiting for whatever wants to kill it. Prey Ai seems especially stupid, when i attack it, it will flinch then go on with its business like nothing happened, the only good Ai seems to be the timid lizards that always dissapear into the greenery.

- Controls, this aspect of the game ceartinly feels rushed, some default key bindings are awkwardly mapped and non existent on console controls. Theres also an issue where the altered key bindings are reset to their default everytime i close the game.

- Camera, seems like the most apparent issue is the fact that the camera seems to operate in fixed angles that are hard to get use to, ill often try to get a look at my dakotaraptor or try to change direction, only to have the camera bug out and swing wildly to some other angle, it's more forgiveable when playing with a controller. 

- Missing assets or features such as spectator mode, dino fight club, plant collision, climbing, turtles, marine life, turtles, other dinosaurs, and turtles.


*****Positives, Things I Hope Will Continue To Improve****


Graphics & Gameplay 
- Amazingly detailed dinosaur models.

- Beautifally animated dinosaur motions, clean, and clear sign of attention to detail.

- Incredibly engaging goal of survival while balancing curiousity, you truly feel like a baby dinosaur really experiencing the world for the first time, not knowing whether something will chase after you or is just curious. 

- Seeing what is supposed to be a ""scientifically accurate"" depiction of the climate millions of years ago does wonders for the experience in the educational front and has a potential to bring interest to many new kids in a brand new way of learning.

- Breath taking graphics during the early morning when shadows and hard light help bring more dimension to the animals and plants.

- Cool looking growth mechanic that is stage based but is applied in a way that almost seems seamless, you could just barely see the dakotaraptors hair colours change from brown to black, to white, it was like it was growing in real time. Movements and animations continued to compliment that aspect of the game. 

Overall Saurian is a remarkably fresh game that brings a great deal of satisfaction in its execution with downfalls that should be fixed as the game continues to progress. While the long wait seems unwarranted and somewhat weird seeing the current state of the game, it is somewhat forgiveable seeing the size of the team. I can only hope they continue to do the game the justice it deserves. Hopefully more competition sparks from the release of this game too.

There is  a severe lack of prey animals to eat, let alone other carnivores.
The game lags so bad it crashed twice, which is why I am now writing a review; since I can't play the game.

There are also mesh errors, in the department of weighting.  After you reach stage two of your dino's life the leg rigging has a vertice that isn't weighted properly so when you walk it clips into itself.

There is so much more issues that I have with this game, but I hope it will be fixed once it has a few updates.

О чем именно я говорю? Дело в том, что это даже не игра, а песочница, симулирующая жизнь одного, отдельно взятого куска местности в Позднемеловом периоде. Разработчики очень сильно заморочились и попытались воссоздать все, что известно о Хелл-Крик и его обитателях того времени. Вплоть до текстуры почв. Да. И само собой, здесь не будет людей и машин. Никогда.

А теперь более четко о плюсах и минусах игры на данный момент.

Плюсы:
-Разработчики, которые в режиме 24/7 ведут диалог с коммьюнити.
-Научная достоверность. Это удивительно, но она есть. Велоцираптор и тираннозавр тут имеют перья. А те куцые растения, что есть, пытаются соответствовать. 
-Аудиовизуальный стиль. Да, коряво. Да, не технологично. Но каким-то непостижимым образом это работает. 
-Звук отдельно. Он прекрасен.
-Анимация и внешний вид динозавров. Анимации не без багов, но смотрятся отлично.
-Приятная физика. (Инерция хвоста!)
-ИИ. Скрепя сердце отнес его к плюсам. Он багованный, явно недоработанный. Но он есть и работает на честную симуляцию жизни. И иногда все-таки умеет создавать шикарные ситуации.

Минусы:
-Освещение и тени. Ночь и текстуры в тени кошмарны. Тут спишь только чтобы не видеть этого ужаса. А ящериц ищешь подальше от деревьев потому что в тени их просто не видно. А тени движутся вслед за солнцем быстрее, чем я хожу.
-Странный баланс между потребностями в еде и воде. Очень быстрое обезвоживание. В итоге весь геймплей сводится к тому, чтобы ходить по песочку у реки и искать ящериц и трупы, оставленные пахицефалозавром. Об этом ниже.
-ИИ. Нет, у меня нет шизофрении. Просто отнести его однозначно к плюсам я не могу при всем желании. Потому что пахи - это Рэмбо под спидами, который атакует все, что шевелится, а что не шевелится - шевелит и атакует. А чтобы кого-то отогнать, его нужно убить.

В целом мне, как человеку, в детстве укушенному компсогнатом, играть интересно уже в преальфу. О потраченных 400 рублях не жалею. При условии, что разработчики не перегорят, будущее проекта вижу просто шикарным.

My parents split and I think the dad got custody over one of my siblings, leaving Me and my brother (who I named Jon) to live with mum. She hunted us a pachy before going for a swim where she was eaten by a crocodile, leaving Me and Jon to fend for ourselves. We spent our young lives to the age of 4 or 5 along the river where mum was killed, food often came to us, and life was good. Until one very dark night... my brother scared the shit out of me, and got ate by mistake. Jon was dead. I cried. I was alone. I left the riverbank where my mother and brother had died, in search of new purpose and adventure...

That's where I left off. There isn't much of an end-game right now beyond exploring the environment and trying to hunt bigger prey for bragging rights. The AI needs a lot of work. The map has little incentive to leave your immediate area. You grow too fast and other dinos don't seem to grow at all, but these things can be put down to being in alpha; thus I hope we'll see gradual improvement.

I also want to point out that a lot of the hypey reviews were posted merely minutes after this game was put on store. Don't trust the hype.
The core content during this stage is eating, drinking, ""hunting"" and growing up as a small carnivorous raptor on single player. The 'secondary level' content is interacting with the animals in the world around you, and obversing them.

Eating is simple, even in the worst of times where there was nothing to scavenge a little lizard would scurry out of the bush and provide enough to keep me going for while. This was by far the most enjoyable part of the game especially when you're just a little youngling look for scraps. Overall though, once you eat, there is little to nothing left to do.

Drinking is a breeze. Despite the small amount of hazards in the marsh areas including aligators and extra foot traffic from all kinds of dinos... once you've drank you don't have too for a long period of time. So once it's done, just like with hunger, there is nothing to do except sit around and wait. Maybe roam.

Hunting is by far the worst aspect of this game at the moment, which is unforunate considering how much of a core element in plays in the games overall enjoyment. Apart from the small lizard, you can hunt almost anything you find. APPARENTLY. In my experience, the aligators were impossible to kill (and could kill you in one bite while out of water). Other creatures weren't only impossible to kill from time to time, but almost immediately killed ME with one bite. In other words, if the animals weren't outright immune to my damage, only some of the hits worked, and the ones that did dealt almost no damage... but for them, I was merely a one or two hit kill even while I was an adult. As an attempt at faining content, this game is constantly trying to kill you so you're forced to restart.

Growing up is enjoyable and right now genuinely the only thing 'to do' in this games current state. Although once you become an adult, there is little drive to play any more. All attempts at hunting will result in instant death or extremely buggy AI ruins the experience. I'd say only 1/6th of the dinosaurs in this world are opperating properly, and even then its only a short amount of time till they too end up bugging out. I also bring up AI because it affects the 'parenting system'. Which in of itself isn't actually a system at the moment. Rather, the adult AI just doesn't hunt you. In reality, you're just following a buggy AI trying to scrap up its kills for food or eat its body once it's died. There is no interaction, let alone actual 'system' in place for parenting at the moment. It's a thinly veiled way of making it seem like you have parents, when its in fact just AI you spawned next too, perhaps for early food.

All of that being said, the animal interaction is nul. It's just simply not in the game at the moment. Generally all AI have the same behaviour, just different 'kill / ignore' parameters. Which are buggy as well. Even the camera you're playing with is buggy and extremely difficult to work with. If your graphic settings aren't on high then nighttime is a nightmare. Everything turns into a mess of green and it becomes completely impossible to move around in the world let alone distinguish plant from empty air. After saving a 4 hour long save file every time I try to spawn in Pachy swarm and kill me, even though they weren't there when I saved. It's also worth mentioning that just having this game loaded makes my computer constantly nonresponsive, even when parked in the main menu. And yeah... as the loading screen warns about... the game WILL crash within 2 hours or so... So once you begin playing, it completely becomes obvious as to why there were delays. This game was not ready to be shipped, and is absolutely walking the borderline on it being an 'actual' game.

Unlike some people I see complaining about the game being in a ""lack of content state"" as of right now, I knew that not all 3 years were spent working on assets specifically for EA launch and putting them into the belt line of production....But rather to create assets as they saw fit in the growing ecosystem. Those 3 years were divided up into a few things. 1.Research. 2.Artwork/Concept designs. 3.Figuring out what will and what will not be in the game, deciding if it felt in the range of a ""game"". 4.Modeling. 5.Programing. 6.Animation.7.Music/Sounds. Yes, I'm well aware that not all of those things are done by the sae person, they have a decently sized staff team for an Indie game, and not all of those were going on at once. To furter that point, adding creatures/features takes longer than you might origionally think, by doing moding, animations, skin ideas, using those skin ideas, texturing, vocalizations, A.I, stats, and whatever ""unique"" feature said animal would have.

I had adored dinosaurs when I was a kid, but sadly no game lived up to my expectations. This is the best dinosaur simulator I have played despite its many flaws as of now, although most are either extremely hard to control mobile games on janked up sci-fi crossovers.

I would not buy it if you are looking for extremely gripping and fulfilling gameplay or a bug free experience right from the get-go. There are some bugs (surprisingly few for pre-Alpha), and quite a lot of the game is empty (spaces for additional dino species I wonder? 6_6). As well as this, the AI isn't extremely intelligent. It's better than what you would get from ARK, but still. Some dinosaurs will get locked into the face-to-face bite contest (particularly rexes), and I saw a rex throwing a triceratops up into the air at one point through glitches and some dinosaurs just flat out walk into trees.

The crocodile (I.... forgot what it was called) seems to have the best AI so far. It lurks in the water and quickly goes toward any dinosaur that is unfortunate enough to come to the edge. It also does some hefty damage if it gets you from the front, so be prepared to run. Note: Do NOT use RPR on these guys, they can hit you even if you're on its back. This will kill you instantly.

Pachys seem to like coming after me, and they tend to stick in groups if others are in the area. Triceratops seem to be solitary despite the females supposedly being in groups. I expect this will be fixed in the future. Rexes and Dakotas only attack me when they are hungry, a refreshing change from the perpetually rampaging ones from ARK and a realistic one at that.

This is more of a note to the devs because I'm not sure where the bug report is.
-Killing something with RPR causes you to clip below the ground into the water underneath.
-Killing something with RPR whilst in the water causes you to endlessly sail away, and nothing stops you. You clip through trees, the ground, everything.

Pros
-A realistic looking simulator with a nicely sized world.
-Huge potential
-Some AI works as intended
-Oh thank Jeebus the dinosaurs have feathers
-A couple of hours of fun before it becomes more of a bug test
-Most bugs are rather humourous
-I actually came across Dakotaraptors of differing age groups, which was a pleasant surprise

Cons
-After a while it does get rather monotonous
-Little content, however, as the game is updated I expect this to become less of an issue
-Game looks rather terrible at night
-RPR is finicky, and has quite a few bugs
-Scent mechanic is borked

If you are willing to follow the game and help the devs weed out bugs then I would recommend it. If not, I would wait.

Oh, and I am neutral on this game for the most part, I just want to see it be supported and become much better than it is, which I believe will happen with time and the help of the community. In other words, I am hopeful. Good on you Urvogel.",1501798077,1501798077,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

----------------
I KNOW THE GRAMMAR IS BAD....I DIDNT WRITE THIS FOR GRAMMAR...I WROTE IT QUICKLY WHEN THINGS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD CAME TO ME.


first of all, the game is great, love it, and the devs have worked their asses off!! so im not bashing them or the game itself!! but basically, ive compiled a list of things after the review i wrote below that would make the game MUCH better than its contemporaries (COUGH COUGH**....WOLFQUEST....IM LOOKING AT YOU!! ...COUGH COUGH****) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVIEW  7/10 (in my opinion) 
----------
for those wanting a review of the game, id say the game is REALLY well done. however, its rather bare bones. it IS early access so thats expected. but im just being honest here. the parents usually die right at the start of the game and you find yourself MOSTLY just walking around and exploring. while this is awe inspiring, it doesnt make for a super interactive FUN game that you cant wait to wake up the next day for! this is not a criticism, just my honest opinion :) that being said...here i am passionately writing about it and playing it as i write LOL!!! so you be the judge of that!!! so yes...its fun! but its NOT challenging anndddd the lack of variance in the game is EXTREMELY boring!!!!!! again, its FUN but then again it ISNT at the same time in a weird way! also, i wish the hunger bar would go down more. its not really challenging when youre pretty much never hungry unless you sleep O.O...........
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LIST OF THINGS TO IMPLEMENT
--------------------------------
anyways, here is a list ive made of things thatll make this game better!!!!!!:

1.) make sure that when the game comes out that the weather patterns change. just having sunny days all the time is quite boring. before anyone says anything to that......i know the devs talked about this already, but i just wanna say it anyways just because it really would be GREAT to add that to the game!!!! <3 <3 
2.) (again, i know this was talked about) implement mating rituals/mating calls. 
3.) implement aggressive calls/territorial calls.
4.) implement nesting behavior, and if the species does so, implement parenting behavior (obviously Dakota raptor will be the exception...) 
5.) implement achievement type goals in the game. lets say the animals life cycle is to grow up/mate for the most part. maybe have an achievement system which does a bit of a tutorial on what the player is supposed to do in order to gain a mate and hatch young. this way players that dont enjoy sandbox style game play can feel entertained. 
6.) implement other dinosaurs attempting to take your territory.
7.) implement territory marking/defending. (PLEEASEEEEE DO THIS!!!!!!)
8.) implement food shortages/surpluses.
9.) implement chicks (that your dinosaur hatched) that even vary in size/color SLIGHTLY. to sort of give the illusion theyre real animals, and that you are contributing to the evolution of ''your'' species you're playing. 
10.) along with changing weather patterns, changing seasons would also be cool. i.e, winter/summer etc.
11.) also, another thing i noticed is that predators dont really exhibit hunting behaviors quite like the real thing. i get it though im sure thats DIFFICULT to program... but if the''crouching'', ''stalking'' behavior was a little more polished for the predators, it would make the game better than it already is :). 
12.) introduce male courtship fighting possibly? i know we know little of dinosaurs, but for instance Pachycephalosaurus presents evidence of this. could that be implemented in that species???
13.) please please please make sure the hunger bar goes down more than it is right now. its hardly challenging cuz your dino never really seems to get hungry :((
14.) JUST thought of another thing...implement a system where if youre the predator you can sense if the prey is weaker, therefore easier to kill (just like the real deal). then itd be more realistic!

so far, thats all i can come up with off the top of my head without thinking too hard. i know thats a huge list but there ya go hahah! other than that i think the game is GREAT so far. its definitely boring for now as it is bare bones at the moment. but i understand :). sounds harsh....im sure if the devs read this theyd throw their keyboard in a rage cuz theyve worked so hard on it! i feel bad being so honest about some ones work they've poured their hearts into, but this IS a product and it i have to give my honest opinion :(( <3 but honestly, i REALLY REALLY love this game so far! if any devs are reading this, please dont take my review the wrong way! keep it up!!!!!!",1501795298,1501812118,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Life is cruel. 

Saurian leaps for realism and authenticity. Simply put: Live the life cycle of a dinosaur during the Late Cretaceous period, simulating an accurate representation of its natural day-to-day struggle/survival. Dakotaraptor is currently the only playable dinosaur/theropod as of right now. However, the developers plan to feature a more varied selection of playable dinos in the near future. 

For the most part this game has enormous potential, it just happens to lack content thus far. Hell Creek's environment is plentiful and immersive to say the least, while Benjamin Bartlett's Walking with Dinosaurs soundtrack is simply fantastic coupled alongside the gameplay/visuals. Not that Saurian's original soundtrack isn't without merit, it's mostly subtle pieces that fit accordingly. The official soundtrack has yet to be completed/implemented into the game. 

As expected an Early Access title is not without its setbacks, bugs and glitches are commonplace, plus animations still feel mixed. For those who are still interested, it would probably be advisable to wait until new updates yield more content.

鳄鱼没气味，所以无法追踪。

躲避天敌
嗅觉在晚上比较有用，像我大半夜去浪，不知道前方有什么的时候，可以闻气味，由此判断周围有什么类型的恐龙。但切记对鳄鱼没用，所以夜晚过河或喝水时自求多福

背景音乐很重要，尤其是前期，可以知道有没有什么恐龙要攻击我们。包括敌意持续多久，快露出你的后背，我要扑了(๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧（更新后，AI现在会无限期地记住攻击者攻击）

睡觉前和存档前观察周围是否有肉食动物，如夜晚看不清就要闻气味确保，当然你想体验一下进档死的话，我也没什么意见，或者你运气超好(更新后，游戏加载过程中,AI不再会移动了)

鳄鱼：请不要在水里和他打，我以为一只卡住了，调戏了一下然后被追，游不过，在水里好像不能加速( •̥́ ˍ •̀ू )嘤嘤嘤~，岸上的可以绕圈圈咬尾巴，害怕被咬的可以冲刺咬一下，然后重复……

详细【由于以下内容为更新前实践得出的，所以可能和更新后的有所不同】
AGE 0～1 吃一次就可以了，然后就是到处浪或者找个离水近的地方等着右上角出现英文，按C睡觉，醒来就是下一阶段，同时获得骑龙术（瞎编），至此看到什么龙都去骑一遍……（由于是机翻，所以只知道空格和鼠标左键）
AGE 1～2 眼睛黄色，不用按C睡觉，但是AGE 2饥饿值会开始掉。
AGE 2～3 需要睡觉，醒来没有获得能力
AGE 3～5 头部黑色，不需要睡觉，AGE 5掉饥饿。
AGE 5～6 需要睡觉，没有能力。但是骑着怀俄明厚头龙，它是甩不开我的（如果不咬死它，就会边叫边走）。骑三角龙要保持平衡（但由于机翻的原因，所以我是乱按的，目前只骑着咬死过一只），骑霸王龙会被直接甩开。骑鳄鱼（骑不到了，不知道是我手残还是成年后不行）
AGE 6～10 头部白色，当时最高只玩到8级，原因在于雏龙状态使劲作死๑乛v乛๑嘿嘿 
AGE 10～11 需要睡觉，没有能力
AGE 11～14（更新后，限制了年龄，但以下内容是之前没限制的）

AGE 16的时候发现骑不了怀俄明厚头龙，而且不主动攻击我了，受到攻击会逃跑。AGE 17的时候发现三角龙会主动攻击我。
AGE 30 偶遇两头霸王龙互怼，所以我有幸吃到霸王龙肉๑乛v乛๑嘿嘿（因为之前会被一口咬死，所以平常都是调戏完霸王龙就跑，这次吃肉中被另一头杀回来咬上一口才发现霸王龙已经不能一口咬死我了） 
然后AGE 31 杀死了一头霸王龙，从此不再是调戏完就跑，而是来啊，互相伤害啊
AGE 33 发现三角龙已经甩不开我了（可能年龄越大，骑龙技巧就越好，也越不需要靠右键保持平衡。不过我之前不能骑怀俄明厚头龙了，所以我怀疑年龄再大点，估计连三角龙都不能骑了。不过这些都是推测就是了）


达科塔盗龙目前不能爬树，从HELP：帮助里没看到有这个能力,实践中也把基础键都试了，，希望后续版本加上去，我想体验一下你咬不到我，只能仰视我的感觉。๑乛v乛๑嘿嘿 

骑龙术
总结
空格加鼠标左键：骑龙会有一条长方形，全白甩不开（怀俄明厚头龙），全红要保存平衡（三角龙），完全没有，是被甩开（或者骑不了霸王龙）。不过貌似受年龄影响，我现在骑不了怀俄明厚头龙，但是骑三角龙甩不开我了（AGE 33）
鼠标右键：保持平衡（扇动翅膀）

详细
由于机翻的意思是（一旦安装皮瓣来维持你的平衡按人民币和点击鼠标左键你的猎物的伤害），所以我不知道怎么保持平衡，尝试了很多次，也只是有次乱按WASD骑着咬死了一只三角龙。
AGE 6 以后怀俄明厚头龙会主动攻击我，所以我也是AGE 6 以后才知道骑着怀俄明厚头龙，它会甩不开我。也许亚成年就会主动攻击我也说不定，但我躲在安全的地方休息直到成年，顺便记录游戏里了解到的事，所以亚成年遇到怀俄明厚头龙会攻击我还是不攻击我，我是不知道的！

经@ZHIJEFF（steam玩家）指正，RMB（机翻：人名币）的意思其实是：Right Mouse Button（鼠标右键），对此我英语渣表示感谢。
至于操作，目前还在实践，不过已经成功在骑龙状态用鼠标左键加鼠标右键杀死了一只三角龙（第二只三角龙_(•̀ω•́ 」∠)_虽然也是乱按杀死的，但至少知道按什么键了对吧）

小细节
一、如果周围有肉食动物，按C休息的时候，达科塔盗龙会坐立不安的解除休息状态。（但貌似只是偶发事件，或者是BUG）
二、成年以后到处浪发现，在有沙滩的岸边（海边和河边）可以看到冥河盗龙的尸体
三、晚上是有星星和月亮的
四、有两条河流通往大海，所以你根据河流到了海岸边，沿岸往左或往右可能会遇到另一条河流。
五、霸王龙杀死猎物后会走开，但有时候会在尸体周围绕圈圈，不过可以乘机偷吃。
六、成年，但AGE忘了多少，骑鳄鱼，结果鳄鱼弹上天了（模型挤压？）
七、你可以在游戏里遇到达科塔盗龙从雏龙到成年的四种阶段
八、河流的尽头有大海的地方，沿岸走左边或右边，结果两边直到撞空气墙都超远的
九、海岸边会发现正在游泳的冥河盗龙
十、有些地方的空气墙是可以卡进去，虽然进去后会原地踏步，但是可以靠跳跃卡出来。
十一、往日出的方向走，可以到大海
十二、在左边海岸接近尽头的几处森林里，都有个没有和大海连接，但是水流颜色和大海的一样，也解不了渴的地方
十三、霸王龙遇到另一个霸王龙会互怼
十四、你可以拖着尸体移动，但尸体是会消失的，所以不要囤食物
十五、年龄越大，三角龙越难甩开我，而且右键的效果也比较容易看的出来（更新后，防止玩家超过最大年龄 14）
十六、鳄鱼不会死亡翻滚
十七、吃鳄鱼肉的时候，鳄鱼并没有像之前那样消失，反而是被叼着，不过我无法移动，但是可以跳跃，鳄鱼会被叼着一起动。怀俄明厚头龙、冥河盗龙、蜥蜴……达科塔盗龙可以叼着，但显示尸体在原地，叼着空气？(方法是吃肉别点太快就行，不过我发现这个的时候，AGE 是33，可能会受年龄限制)【更新后，可以叼着尸体移动，但貌似怀俄明厚头龙不能叼着了】
十八、达科塔盗龙有时候会左顾右盼，如果周围没有恐龙，那可能就是蜥蜴
十九、你可能会看到在水底的蜥蜴（更新后，有时候移动视角可以看到水底了，有时候又不行）
二十、蜥蜴是有气味的，颜色是绿色。鳄鱼没有气味，鳄鱼的尸体也没有气味
二十一、从水里出来，会甩干身体
二十二、你可以听到咬合声
二十三、走在不同地面上的声音是不同的
二十四、你可以在水里休息和睡觉，比较深但是不会变成游泳状态的地方（以后更新可能会改成窒息会扣血吧）
二十五、有些区域的水里可以攻击，不过从这个区域出来就不能攻击了（上岸后再回去那个区域也不能攻击了，但有些时候又可以【迷之BUG】）


8月6日更新后（以下是载入存档发现的，可能受年龄影响【AGE 36】）
一、【防止玩家超过最大年龄 14】但是载入存档还是之前的年龄，不过不会再加了
二、成年后下水里，鳄鱼不再一定是逃上岸，而是有可能在水里绕圈圈，如果靠近会攻击，也可能会游远
三、【不知道是不是受AI躲避行为（避开威胁而不是逃避威胁）影响！】霸王龙会被我追着咬（所以说我是威胁咯）
四、【受血贴花影响】你会看到血龙，并且血液貌似不会消失，血液覆盖头部后，会看到头部有好几条白线
五、尸体的某些部位还是会颤抖
六、载入存档可以消除血液覆盖效果
七、跟在霸王龙后面，达科塔盗龙会盯着霸王龙的尾巴一起左右摇头（如果你没被咬死的话）
八、睡觉不会增加年龄值，但会扣饥饿值和口渴值，所以睡觉前最好猎杀一头恐龙不吃完，这样醒来就可以补充饥饿值。
九、你可能会被恐龙撞死（还是踩死？）
十、霸王龙现在会把尸体吃光


8月15日更新后（因为改成最低特效依然一卡一卡的，所以暂时不玩了，等下个更新再说【第二个档，这次更新没开新档，AGE 14】）
一、奔跑模式按键大写改成Q
二、晚上的星空有银河了
三、喝海水减口渴值（脱水）
四、增加了骨丘鸟，没气味，但是尸体有气味
五、进水里可以消除血液覆盖效果
六、多了很多尖尖的石头
七、更新后的晚上和更新前的很不一样
八、晚上气味颜色和白天的不太一样
九、还没从夜间变成白天的太阳颜色是不一样的

8月29日更新后（还是卡，开新档也卡，主要是控制的达科塔盗龙，走路会一卡一卡的）
按""1""有威胁叫声，不过是原地叫的。

【不更新了，没什么意外就这样了吧】


寻找沧龙
一、想去大海的话跟着河流走，不过河流的尽头可能是大海，也可能是山，山的会有空气墙挡着
，有些在山上，有些在山下，而且空气墙附近霸王龙出现率很高
二、成龙状态下水里，鳄鱼会上岸，怕我了吧๑乛v乛๑嘿嘿 （更新前）
三、喝海水不解渴（废话）
四、往外海游很远，我只得到了已停止工作，貌似这个版本还没有沧龙

悬崖跳海（突然有个念头就浪了一晚上）
从河流的尽头沿海岸的左边开始走，转了一个大圈，最终到了海岸的右边……顿了一下，然后飞奔跳入大海，终于找到可以跳海的地方了，在海岸的右边悬崖上。早知道一开始走右边了( •̥́ ˍ •̀ू )嘤嘤嘤~


希望添加的！！！
一、AI雏龙：本想杀落单的雏龙的我，奈何只遇得到冥河盗龙的雏龙，还打不过的那种( •̥́ ˍ •̀ू )嘤嘤嘤~（现已知道冥河盗龙只是体型较小，而不是雏龙）
二、鳄鱼的死亡翻滚：想看死亡翻滚的不用尝试了，因为我没见过（死亡N次……）
三、尸体被吃时，逐渐变成骨架：游戏里是凭空消失
四、三角龙可以把比较小的树撞倒或者角插在比较大的树上暂时拔不出（你问我三角龙为什么撞树，当然是我引它撞的啦。或者后续版本达科塔盗龙可以爬树后，三角龙为了教训我，把树撞倒这种情况）


游戏体验
由于我很喜欢恐龙，所以面对别人说的视角问题、优化问题、到一个地方会卡一下加载地图、AI恐龙比较蠢问题……我是不怎么在意的，毕竟是抢先体验版，所以我相信会慢慢好起来的。
相反，雏龙到成龙所要面对的天敌和饥饿，和恐龙的对峙，为了吃上一口肉的斗智斗勇，都让我很激动。别忘了这是一个弱肉强食的史前世界。一点难度都没有，还有什么意思，更何况可以存档的耶，学我去浪啊，死了大不了读档，大不了存档的位置刚好有霸王龙，趁我加载，拿我性命( •̥́ ˍ •̀ू )嘤嘤嘤~至此存档前先观察周围有没有肉食动物，这些都是实践出来的，看我攻略安全玩到成年，不冒险还有意思吗？如果累了也可以欣赏日出日落，观察丰富多样的植被，看AI恐龙互怼。",1501778954,1504411910,True,110,9,0.910588622093200684,9,True,False,True,False,,,

Ofc the game as it is right now is still pretty basic but it has just been released right now and Early Access has only just began. It has a lot of potential and already is fairly unique with its dedication to realism and scientific accuracy, something you do not see often especially with Dinosaur games. 

It is an enjoyable experience to play, even if right now food for a Dacotahraptor hatchling can be scarce (but right now everything is subject to change and it adds challenge to the game to find a food source!). There are still some issues such as AI clipping into objects but the game has literally just been released into EA and such thing are to be expected. 

Overall the amount of details that has gone into the models and the flora and even the sound effects is just amazing and exemplary in my opinion! 

Also: I do not meet all the recommended specs for the game and I'm able to run the game on Ultra with mostly fluent frame rates (it never dropped below 24 FPS, and most the time the game runs on 30 to 40 FPS!) I'd say for an EA game it's already good optimised, and it will only get better. 

Overall I was not dissapointed and I have faith that with time this game can become something truly extraordinary. It has all the promise and all the potential, and will only continue to be better.

For everyone else, here is my review:

Pros:

- Amazing models
- As accurate as current science allows. Even the plants are species found in Hell Creek
- Beautiful music and sound design 
- Atmospheric 
- RPR (Raptor Prey Restraint) is a unique combat style over just chasing and biting something
- Herding, Courting, and Nesting with AI

Cons: 

- The Aforementioned Early Access issues. This is to be expected and I don't mind it

This is not a game that you have challenges, quests, and a story. If you want those things, this is not the game for you. This  is a survival simulation of Hell Creek dinosaurs. Right now it's just one option, but there will be more in the future.

What this means is that you eat. You drink. You sleep. You try not to die, and try to survive. That is what you do. There is no quest to go find the golden marmoset for XP, or any sort of story.

The challenges you face are not given by NPCs, but rather are 'can I kill that prey without dying myself?' or 'if i cross this river, will a crocodile eat me?'

Now it's been what, 2 years now and everything's still the same except for 4 new AI creatures. 90% of the promising stuff the devs show in their devlogs is just that, logs. Eye candy. Show-and-tell. All pizzaz and no substance. The devs seem to be far more interested in running a blog than actually updating their game and giving their playerbase the ability to do what an Alpha build is supposed to do: test and give feedback on features that will be part of the final product. Instead it's all done in-house, you just need to read the recent reviews to see where that's getting them.

And because of this, I've lost faith in Saurian. It was promoted to become the best, most scientifically accurate dinosaur survival game on the market, but when games like The Isle and Primal Carnage have work done to them instead of a wall of text from the developers in the form of a blog telling you why you should still be psyched for such a hollow project where the last content update added a tiny AI lizard that you'd forget was there without scent, it's easy to see why this game is quickly becoming nothing more than false promises and raising suspicions of whether or not the devs will just take what they earned and run like so many have before.

If Saurian has any chance to improve, it's in content updates that shake up the gameplay and give players variety, not running a blog about projects that will likely never be included in the game. The sooner the devs realize that their released Alpha should be the testing ground ALONG WITH the closed development version, adding other species to play as (something they dangle in our faces with every new game), and focus on implementing the content they display so proudly on their blog instead of focusing solely on their blog, the better.

Seriously though, as a backer on kickstarter for this game for welll over a year now it is nice to finally obtain some sort of playable product. The proof of concept seems great so far, and its fun to be able to play as a raptor. However, I would say that at this point that is all this game is. Nothing more than a proof of concept, which is to be expected as this is Pre-aplha. There is currently only one dinosaur you can play as, frame rates as low even on higher end pc's, ai needs some work(ie, dad doing nothing, pachys and other dinos not being afraid of my when im hunting them, and etc), and many features are missing from the game. Its a great concept that I can't wait to see excecuted in the coming months of updates.

This shows in the reviews  but try not to be fooled by the currently 'Very Positive' overall review score, this game is an investment rather than a product I would consider worth my money at this point in development. I pre-ordered it myself and have eagerly awaited it's release. 

First off, this is about as early access as I would ever consider buying into. It is pre-alpha stage and has almost no content. You get to play one dinosaur, a Dakotaraptor, which you start off as a hatchling and slowly progress up to an adult. You would do well to get there at all, since there is little in the way of edibles and everything in the world one-shots you from a few feet away but the progression is fair in timeframe if you can find the food required. This isn't where the problems stop though, Saurian is currently a bit of a mess of mechanics. The AI is still very early (I hope), with other dinosaurs staring into space and ignoring you completely. The graphics are suffering from an excess of contrast in this build making daytime shadows/plants ugly and night time a mess of green and brown. The controls are flaky, delayed and suffer from poor hitboxes, so combat is just clumsy right now and the overall performance of the game is satisfactory at best with mild stutter and freezing when loading new models and landscape. (i5 3570k, 16gb, nvidia 1070)

It's not all bad though, as early as it is, it shows a lot of promise. The lanscape is lovingly created and a good size with some variation to see. The dinosaur models are very detailed and well animated, although still need a little work on tranistions. The health, hunger, hydration and stamina bars all react well, aren't too high or low and look good. It's just that if you aren't an absolute dinosaur junky, this won't be enough to keep you entertained for very long.

Summary: I want to give this game a thumbs up because I think developers are good and the long term plan is awesome but I am struggling to find positives at this early stage that outweigh the negatives to any degree. IF you are a dino junky and have to buy every game with dinosaurs in, then you'll likely have a few hours of fun here but otherwise I would wait a few months for the game to flesh out a bit and for some of the obvious failing to get some dev attention.",1501763033,1501763033,False,50,1,0.596850037574768066,17,False,False,True,False,,,

Saurian attempts to (re)create the cretaceous world grounded in fact and accuracy, and educate its players. From the feathers covering the small dromaeosaurids to the drastic growth stages of Tyrannosaurus and even down to the vegetation that would have covered the Hells Creek formation.

The game has a ways to go to truly capture the feeling of a living ecosystem - The foliage needs more movement, combat needs more impact and weight and of course, more life needs to be added.

Hängt doch das Meiste stark davon ab wie das Spiel sich entwickelt, denn, und das kann nicht oft genug betont werden (!), es ist eine Pre-Alpha!

Derzeit ist der Dakotaraptor, einer von später insgesamt 6 Dinosauriern, spielbar ( Dakotaraptor, T Rex, Triceratops, Pachycephalosaurus, Anzu und Ankylosaurus ). Man startet als frisch geschlüpfter Hatchling und versucht über Juvenile und Subadult bis zum adulten Tier zu überleben. Zur Zeit kein leichtes Unterfangen, da die Spielwelt im Moment noch nicht mit sehr vielen Tieren bevölkert ist. Diverse Fähigkeiten wie das Erschnüffeln von kleinen Beutetieren, bis hin zum Anspringen und Festkrallen an der Beute sind aber hilfreich um letztlich doch durchzukommen.

Alles im Spiel ist nach dem derzeitgen Stand der Wissenschaft modeliert und nachempfunden. Die Devs stehen mit einer großen Zahl namhafter Wissenschaftlern in Kontakt, die alle Infos liefern und die Endergebnisse absegnen. Spezialisten für damalige Fauna und Flora, ja sogar für das Wetter und die Katastrophen der damaligen Zeit garantieren ein letztlich glaubhaftes Spielerlebnis, selbst wenn dies nur wenig in unser von Jusassic Park und Actionmonstern geprägtes Bild passt. So ist z.B. der gefiederte Rex ohne gefletschte Zähne ein doch sehr ungewöhnlicher Anblick. Doch die Welt wird sich daran gewöhnen müssen. Wwie es dem Menschen leider nur zu eigen ist, geht das natürlich nicht ohne motzen und meckern, und Leuten, die sich verzweifelt an ihren Hollywood-Monstern festkrallen, von statten. Womit wir beim Technischen des Spieles wären!

Grafisch zeigt sich das Spiel noch eher etwas bescheidener. Das es damals noch kein Gras gab unterstreicht dies unglücklicherweise noch zusätzlich. Die Umwelt sieht bei weitem nicht schlecht aus, man erahnt halt nur, das hier noch etwas an der optischen Qualitätsschraube gedreht werden muss, und sicher auch wird!
Selbiges gilt für die KI der NPC-Dinos, denn die kann zum momentanen Zeitpunkt nur als unterirdisch bezeichnet werden. Ich war immer der Meinung das ein Spiel wie Saurian mit seiner KI stehen und fallen wird, so kann man nur hoffen das ganz besonders hier im Laufe der Entwicklung sehr stark nachgebessert wird. Sicherlich ist die derzeitige KI aber auch nur als rudimentäre EA-KI gemeint, um dem Spieler wenigstens etwas von dem notwendigen Leben in der Welt zu bieten.

Auch die Steuerung präsentiert sich etwas schwamming, was grade das Jagen und Kämpfen ein wenig zum Glücksspiel macht. Auch hier wird sicher nachgearbeitet. 
Als besonders störend erweisen sich jedoch die teils imensen Lagspitzen alle paar Sekunden. Vermutlich beim Nachladen der Spielwelt. Dies, so muss ich sagen, ist definitiv ein Faktor, der den Spielspaß sehr stark trübt. Hier würde ich schnellst mögliche Nachbesserung empfehlen!

Im Großen und Ganzen, mit allem was im Moment im Spiel so zu sehen und zu tun ist, möchte ich aber behaupten, das für Dinoliebhaber hier nach den 2 geplanten Jahren Entwicklungszeit, sicher ein Traumspiel herauskommt. Zumal noch sehr interessanten Features kommen sollen. Wetter, Katastrophen, Multiplayer, Endzeitmodus und anpassen des Erscheinungsbildes des eigenen Lieblings, sind da wohl die Hauptpunkte die zu nennen wären.

Ich gebe dem Spiel hier eine absolute Kaufempfehlung. Ich denke man sollte hier nicht nach dem gehen was in diesem Moment alles geht oder nicht geht. Viel mehr sollte man sich überlegen ob man ein tolles Dinospiel haben will oder nicht. Wenn ja, so muss man immer im Kopf haben das jeder einzelne Kauf seinen Teil dazu beiträgt, das Saurian best möglich mit tollen Features entwickelt werden kann. Das Spiel jetzt zu zerreißen und nicht zu kaufen um die Verkaufszahlen zu drücken, um dann am Ende als toller Kerl dazustehen und zu sagen:""Habe ich doch gesagt!"", zeugt höchstens von bemerkenswerter Kurzsicht, nicht von großer Sachkenntnis. Dies sei besonders in Richtung 'The Isle'-Spieler gesagt!

Mit knapp 1000 Stunden Spielzeit habe ich jede Menge von 'The Isle' gesehen und weiß somit aus Erfahrung, das auch bei dem Spiel nicht alles Gold war was glänzte, und bis heute auch nicht ist! Zudem zeugt es von extremer Ignoranz, diese beiden Spiel jetzt zu vergleichen, wo Saurian grade erst in EA gegangen ist und The Isle seit dem schon 2 Jahre Entwicklung durchlaufen hat. In Foren und besonders in Reviewes dick den Platzhirsch für The Isle zu geben nur weil  einem die Konkurenz nicht paßt, ist mehr als nur unangebracht, wenn nicht sogar reinweg dumm!! Um so mehr als die beiden Spiele alleine schon zu zwei völlig verschiedenen Genres gehören. Ich spiele The Isle auch gerne und viel, aber fair bleiben und beidem erstmal eine Chance geben, tue ich dennoch. Frühestens wenn beide Spiele fertig sind kann man vielleicht anfangen zu diskutieren.",1501760408,1501760408,True,11,0,0.567193031311035156,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Es ist noch im Alpha status und wirklich weit vom Release entfernt, und das merkt man auch.

Wer gerne bei der Geburt eines Titels live miterleben möchte wie es sich von zeit zu zeit verbessert der kann hier sorgenlos zugreifen. Solltet ihr allerdings einen Titel suchen der euch auch lange unterhält, dann wartet lieber noch ein paar Monate. Das spiel bietet aktuell noch nicht viel Content.

Meine Eindrücke über das Spiel:
Positiv:
+ Schöne Grafik auf Ultra-settings allerdings extrem Performance lastig und nur auf High end Rechnern zu geniessen. Ansonsten auf minimal Grafik eher unschön anzusehen.
+ Die Dinos sehen wirklich gut aus wenn man sie denn auf Ultra geniessen kann.
+ Die Welt hatt genug KI Dinos um sie belebt zu machen, jedoch übertreiben die entwickler hier nicht wie der Spawn in ARK zbsp. trotzdem kommt die atmosphäre zzt irgendwie nicht so rüber.
+ Die Spiel idee ist gut durchdacht (Jagen, Essen, Trinken, überleben)

Negativ:
- Starke FPS einbrüche die dazu sorgen das das spiel beim nachladen der Map auf 1FPS freezed
- Man kann die Grafik nicht wirklich einstellen. Nur feste einstellungen nutzen von Minimal bis Ultra. Keine Schatten oder Kantenglättung etc. Die Auflösung ändern scheint dabei kein einfluss auf die FPS zu machen. Zumindest bei mir.
- Game crashed gerne mal.
- KI noch zu blöd so das sie nicht Lebendig wirkt. Eher wie ein Lemming.
- Steuerung fühlt sich irgendwie leicht schwammig an.
- Extreme Performance lastig, hier fehlt es noch an Optimierung
- Man hatt das gefühl man wandert einfach nur sinnlos umher.
- Zzt. Kein anreiz es lange zu spielen ausser den Dino aufwachsen zu sehen. (Rumsitzen, walken, Essen, Trinken)
- Kein Survival feeling da man selten angegriffen oder gejagt wird.
- Kamera kollidiert gerne mit dem Boden so da die Kamera dicht ranzoomt.
- Der Sound ist wirklich noch sehr schlecht.

Because at the moment it is completely unplayable for me. 

First time I tried to open the game I got to the main menu before it crashed. Next 3 times I tried it froze at the loading screen and I had to completely shut down the program before trying again. Once I finally got back to the menu I turned the graphics down to the lowest setting (considering how many problems I was already having I thought it would be best) and after a long loading screen finally got into the game. Of course after actually getting into the game it was lagging so horribly (keep in mind this is on the lowest setting) that I couldn't even walk two steps. I tried exiting out of the game and bringing it back but even when I got back in (after multiple freezes again) it wasn't any better.

I might not have a super high end gaming computer, but my computer isn't some old heap of garbage either. But in it's current state, for me at least, this game is completely unplayable.

The whole game feels unresponsive and slow. The camera angles feel dodgey. It's much much too dark at night on my screen yet there are no options to alter the brightness in the graphic settings.

Das ein oder andere kann noch verbessert werden, wie die Grafik, sprich die Auflösung ich finde diese zu klein und in der Dämmerzeit kann mann kaum was sehen, ist ein komischer schwarzübergang.

Gameplay:
Die KI ist noch zu verbessern und vielleicht noch ein paar Interaktionen mit der eigenen Spezies einarbeiten
z.B: auf Gefahr aufmerksamm machen, Hilferuf, Paarungsruf für die Erwachsenen Tiere. Soweit ich weiß sind Dekotaraptoren auch Rudeljäger gewesen... u.s.w. hauptsach es wirkt realistisch.
Da es eine Lebenssimulation von Sauriern ist würde ich es beforzugen wenn noch die Vermehrung eine rolle spielen würde, also eingenen nachwuch bekommen, würde hauptsächlich die weiblichen Tiere betreffen mit Nest bauen, Eier legen, auf das Gelege aufpassen, halt je nachdem welches geschelcht man spielt.

Den Tages und Nachtverlauf finde ich zu schnell, den könnte man ruhig auf die hälfte des jetzigen wertes reduzieren.
Es wäre auch toll wenn sie die Pflanzen sich beim durchlaufen sowie von Wind bewegen würden.
Schwimmen mit Wellenbewegung.

Ich hoffe das ein paar sachen die ich aufegzählt habe auch im Spiel auftauchen könnten, das wäre echt super das Spiel selbst finde ich sehr gelungen und macht auch jetzt schon spaß.
Ich werde weiterhin mit euch mitfiebern das die early access phase noch viele tolle und realistische veränderungen mit sich bringt.

I keep in mind that the game is still in early development and while most certainly change as its being updated and more.
However it does have pros and cons
While the game is very early in development it has more cons than pros for the time being, don't let this discourge tou if you wish to buy it, however since its only in the early stages for you it may not be the best buy!
Pros
-It's dinosaurs
-You get control of the dino from the first stage in its life, and go from there.

Cons
- It's a tad laggy but an be fixed in game once playing by reducing the folliage
- The attack button doesn't seem to work but drinking and eating does
- Graphics maybe a tad out dated but thats to be expected from early development
- If you buy, DO NOT GET STEPED ON, instent death as baby dino

Les mises à jours (même si elles restent trop peu fréquentes pour le moment) ont permis d'améliorer un peu le jeu par rapport à ce qu'il était de base et donc de régler certains problèmes. La luminosité est enfin gérer correctement, et la nuit rend maintenant très bien et très réelle, et rajout d'une autre petit IA (une sorte de petit oiseau dont j'ai oublié le nom), permettant enfin de diversifier nos proies et d'avoir une proie vraiment difficile à attraper lorsque l'on est petit

Je remets les points positifs d'avant, et je rajoute les nouveaux à la suite : 
- Graphisme très jolie, pour de l'Unity (attention donc pour ceux ayant des problèmes avec ce moteur) c'est vachement bien géré, on est vite plongé dans l'univers de Hell Creek
- Petit tuto en début vous expliquant la base (mais vraiment la base, ne vous attendez pas à avoir des astuces ou autres)
- Modèle 3D très réussi, même si certains ne sont plus scientifiquement correcte (t.rex par exemple qui devrait au moins être chauve)
- Les lézards, surement la meilleure chose que l'on trouve dans ce jeu, + ajout récent d'un petit oiseau en IA avec d'ailleurs une intelligence très correcte
Nouveau : 
- La gestion de la luminosité est maintenant très bien réglé, la nuit est maintenant très belle, et les effets donner par le soleil sont parfois vraiment splendide

Repartons sur les points négatifs, vous verrez que peu de chose ont changé, j'ai même dû rajouté des trucs
- IA sympa mais trop simple par rapport à ce que les devs nous avaient dis, les dinosaures se bloquent dans les arbres, ils se bloquent en mangeant, les Triceratops et les Pachycéphalosaurus attaquent les crocodiles dans l'eau  sans aucune raison, à part l'IA du lézard je pense que c'est raté sur ce point, lorsque l'on voit des triceratops manger des crocodiles ...
- Aucune animation de la végétation, tout reste statique, pouvant parfois vous effacer l'illision que veut vous donner le jeu
- Les animations sont depuis la dernière mise à jour bugué, plus de transitions entre certaines comme avant, et certaines marches (comme celle des crocodiles) semblent avoir des problèmes de walkcycle (l'animation semble d'un coup s'arrêter au bout de 3-4 secondes et repart)
- Le tuto est simpa mais trop simple, pour un jeu solo, il aurait fallu je pense mettre des astuces par exemple, sur ce que les paléontologues pensent du mode de vie présumé du Dakotaraptor, de façon à ne pas obligé le joueur à faire ceci, mais à l'aiguillé de comment joué comme un véritable Dakotaraptor, parce que là tu es laché comme ça, tu n'as aucune idée de quoi faire, où aller, qu'est-ce que je peux manger, qu'est-ce qui est dangereux (quelqu'un qui ne s'y connait pas en dinosaure sera totalement perdu dès son arrivé dans le jeu)
- Enfin gros points que j'ai trouvé dommage (mais ce n'est pas un défaut du jeu en soit), on ne grossit pas en direct, pour grandir vous êtes obligé de passer des étapes (en dormant quand le jeu vous le dis), alors que pour le réalisme, je pense qu'il aurait été beaucoup mieux de voir notre dinosaure grandir naturellement. Ceci est possible, certains jeux comme Prehistoric Kingdom ont réussi à le faire, donc pour moi, c'est soit de la flemme ou du mauvais travail

Donc conclusion final : Le jeu c'est bien amélioré, et si on avait eu cette version dès le début mon avis aurait surement été différent sur le jeu. Mais il reste quand même négatif, car 2 semaines pour ne régler que certains problèmes principaux qui aurait du pour moi être corriger depuis longtemps (je commence un peu à comprendre comment marche tout ces systèmes donc je sais de quoi je parle) montre que les développeurs ne semblent pas beaucoup se bouger, voir même que seul les remarques positives non constructive comme je vois partout sur steam sont pris en compte par ceci. Ma note reste de 5/10, ça ne vaut pas plus pour le moment et le jeu reste encore loin d'être le jeu promis par les devs, MEME pour une pré-alpha

Some parts may become outdated.[/i]

Ultimately, Saurian is a game of passion and determination. Having watched the game develop years ago as a hot topic around various forums, I'm still in disbelief that it's finally entered Early Access. 
There are still some pretty hefty issues in the current game version (the most notable being the random AI ""freeze"" that occassionally happens shortly after starting a new game, but this is afterall a pre-alpha product and is being improved upon by a team of highly dedicated developers. 

I acknowledge the issues that certain people have with the game, as it's an Early Access product; not a full release. [i]However,[/i] when it works as intended, Saurian is brilliant. You cannot help but feel like you're walking through what is essentially a very alien-planet to what we know today. At its core, it's fascinating. Even during the slower moments of gameplay (e.g. walking to my next destination) I am fascinated by this world and the unique floodplain environment of the Hell Creek Formation. 
As a juvenile, the game is brutal. While I do perhaps think it should be just a smidge easier (then again, dinosaur hatchling death rate statistics...) there is a certain helplessness you feel when even that other tiny raptor starts running towards you. In addition to this, I adore that the game forces you into developing your own playstyle. Through the younger years of the Dakotaraptor, I find it highly unique to be playing as the scavenger rather than natures wrecking ball. 

Here are my personal pros and cons with the game. Yes, there are other issues that other players have reported, but these are the ones that standout the most to me. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Dedicated development team.
[*] Amazing atmosphere + sound design/score. 
[*] Dynamic music. 
[*] Some of the best models and depictions of prehistoric life ever created. 
[*] Fluid and weighted animations. 
[*] Well-detailed interpretation of the Hell Creek Formation. 
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Animals seem to freeze in place (ocassionally), but does ruin the game in some ways due to the lack of interactivity.
[*] Strange lag spikes. 
[*] Content is lacking to some players (will change over time).

As a starting point, this pre-alpha is already a high watermark, despite some expected slowdown issues etc, I can't wait to see where it goes.

I was hoping that combat wouldn't be as simplistic as it would be in the isle, given that its contemporary possesses a far larger selection of playable dinosaurs, but nope, as of its current state, saurian is about as shallow as a drying puddle. 

As a baby, any animal that is slightly larger than you can apparently reduce your bones to jelly with a single nip. While I don't mind the fact that you have to play as a vulnerable infant at the start of your journey, I am not cool with playing as an animal made of paper mache. Sure I can buy a crocodile mangling me within seconds if it got its jaws on me, its absolutely infuriating when a marginally larger acheroraptor drops you with a tap of its jaw. This game is supposed to strive for realism, yet there is little to no feeling of impact when animals enter conflict with one another in this game. When I attacked a acheroraptor, I expected to get bowled over and mauled, but instead I got slapped down like an underleved RPG character taking on a boss would. 

This dissapointing combat system might be slightly more tolerable if it weren't for the fact that the only prey you can realistically hunt as an infant, barring exploitation of a the terrible ai, are tiny lizards, that are at least from my experience, litterally less common than eight ton t.rexes. So far, the only times I've been able to eat are when a t.rex randomly murders a pachy and walks away from the corpse without taking a single bite of it.

I realize that the devs put a lot of effort into making this game, but maybe instead of paying painstaking detail to recreating realistic flora at least 95 percent of people won't appreciate, more time could have been spent working on ai, combat, and adding more prey species for the early game.

I am so happy that I can finally say that this game is enjoyable... 

Now it's not perfect, it is incredibly clunky and poorly optimized, as well as that the AI is incredibly dumb... And yet it is still a fun game to play. 

Some things that I really like about this game is the focus on realism while still striving to be a fun and enjoyable experience, far too many devs only go for one of these and the game can often suffer as a result. 

Another thing is the music of this game is great, one momment it can be peaceful and relaxing and then the next you feel like you are playing a horror game.

This game is in a very early state and that is quite obvious, but what sets this aside from a couple other dinosaur survival games, is that they didn't use that as an excuse to release with actually nothing to do gameplay wise like another dinosaur game I had the displeasure of playing... Saurian actually has gameplay and goals to achieve, the most obvious goal is to survive and make it to adulthood, but there are also other things you could do such as try to get the achievents.

And finally I can say I do recommend this game, and as long as the devs keep at it I can see this becoming a great game.

It's stutters constantly on a high end computer, with low frame rates even when it's not stuttering. The world is empty except for large dinosaurs, which I know sounds stupid for a dinosaur game but being so empty of other life makes it feel completely lifeless. The scent system seems pretty broken and only adds to how empty it feels. Most of all, the AI is useless. My parents get themselves killed immediately most of the time, and when they aren't doing that they are walking into trees, walking around in circles, or even standing there and not moving at all. I mean at least a dead parent is free food, right? In fact that is the easiest way to survive, follow your parent around until they get themselves killed and just eat them and bam, you'll be grown up before you know it!

I see the POTENTIAL, but what's here is little more then what a demo during the actual kickstarter should have been. It is absolutely beautiful, with amazing detailed models and textures.

2013년 가을에 개발 소식을 처음으로 발표했을때부터 이 게임을 기다려온 사우리안의 개돼지가 이야기하는, 사우리안에 대한 소개글. 스스로 대가리 깨고 또 꺠면서 쓴거 맞습니다. 현재 사우리안의 테스터 활동을 하고 있습니다.

테스터요.

(사우리안에 대한 과도한 팬심이 들어가있는 글입니다.)

공룡을 사랑하는 모든 사람들에게 추천하고 싶은 게임이지만, 다양한 컨텐츠를 원하는 사람들에게는 아직 구매를 별로 추천하지 않는 게임이라고 할 수 있겠네요.

저는 제작 발표가 되었을때부터 지금까지 3년 10개월동안 기다려왔었고 킥스타터에 40딸라나 후원까지 했을 정도로 이 게임에 애정을 가지고 기대해왔습니다. 그런데 뚜껑을 열어보니까 버그도 많고, 나오는 동물들도 별로 없고 최적화도 그다지 잘 된 편은 아닙니다. 예상했던것보다 완성도는 많이 떨어지더군요. 지금 당장 구매하시는것보다는 좀 기다리시다가 차라리 나중에 구매하시는걸 권장드립니다. 게임 자체가 나쁘다는건 아니지만 생각보다 빈약한 컨텐츠에 실망하실 분들이 많을 것 같습니다. 다시 이야기하지만 이 게임은 완성된 게임이 아닙니다.

그래도 설명할 것이 상당히 많은 게임이기에, 혹시 이 게임에 관심 있으신 분들을 위해 긴 글을 씁니다.

사우리안은 사실 너무 일찍 얼리 엑세스 게임을 내놓은 감이 없지 않습니다. 그래서 아직은 컨텐츠가 부족한 느낌이 강한데, 점차 동물들을 추가하면서(이중에는 아직 학명이 안 붙혀진 동물들도 있습니다) 정식 발매 단계에서는 약 40여종의 동물들이 이 게임에 있을 것이라고 합니다. 또한 많은 공룡들이 다코타랍토르처럼 여러 성장단계를 가질 예정인데, 이중에는 티렉스나 트리케라톱스같이 이미 있는 몇몇 공룡들도 포함됩니다. 미래에 추가될 동물 종들의 예를 들자면, 티렉스보다 큰 초식공룡, 9미터 악어, 키가 큰 익룡, 그리고 새끼 랩터가 쉽게 사냥할 수 있는 거북 등이 있습니다. 공식 사이트에 가시면 이들의 3d 모델이나 컨셉아트를 보실 수 있습니다.
다코타랍토르 다음으로 플레이 가능한 공룡들 발매 순서는 파키케팔로-트리케라-티렉스-그리고 아직 시작화면에서만 볼 수 있는 안킬로사우루스(갑옷공룡)와 안주(닭같이 생긴 공룡)라고 합니다. 사우리안 팀은 각 공룡들마다 독특한 플레이 방식을 만들고 싶어하기에, 이 과정은 꽤나 긴 시간이 걸릴 것이라 합니다. (게임 발매로부터 티렉스가 플레이 가능한 시점까지는 약 2년 정도 걸린다 추정하고 있습니다.)

아무래도 물 게이지가 너무 빨리 떨어져서 멀리 이동하기 힘든데, 사우리안 맵은 4평방킬로미터 정도 크기이며, 습지대, 해변가, 평원 등 다양한 환경이 있습니다. 참고로 아직 풀숲이 많이 울창하지 않는데, 나중에 숲이 완성되면 작은 동물들이 큰 동물들로부터 숨는 장소가 될 것입니다. 
스트리머들의 방송을 보면 티렉스가 스테미나가 많다는 이야기가 간혹 나오는데, 실제로 티렉스는 많은 작은 공룡들보다 스테미나가 많습니다. 개발자 말에 따르면 랩터가 티렉스를 피하는 가장 좋은 방법은 나무 사이사이를 민첩하게 움직이며 큰 티렉스를 따돌리는 것이라고 합니다. 물론 나무나 풀숲이 울창하지 않은 지금 상태에서는 티렉스에게 너무 가까이 다가가지 않는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 

다코타랍토르 플레이에 추가될 내용도 있습니다. 예를 들자면 다코타랍토르는 새끼 때 나무를 타는 능력을 가질 것이라고 합니다. 여러분들이 궁금해하시는 번식도 추가될 내용 중 하나인데, 다코타랍토르(랩터)가 짝짓기 춤을 출 것이라고 합니다.
또한 언제 추가될지는 불확실하지만, 계절이나 자연재해(산불, 홍수)등도 넣을 계획을 밝힌 것을 보면, 개발자분들이 자연환경 자체 또한 플레이에 중요한 변수로 생각하고 있음을 알 수 있습니다. (비가 내리는 양을 무작위로 정하는 알고리즘과 비 효과는 어느정도 개발 중인 것 같습니다.)

이 게임에 나온 모든 다른 동물들은 유저가 아니라 인공지능으로, 주인공처럼 체력, 스테미나, 배고픔, 목마름 게이지가 있고 생존하기 위해 움직입니다. 게임을 하다 보면 공룡들이 물을 마시러 강가로 가는 모습과 배부른 티렉스가 주위에 있는 다른 공룡들을 무시하는 모습을 볼 수 있습니다. 
이렇듯 동물들이 모두 자신의 인공지능으로 판단하고 움직여야 하기 때문에, 한 동물을 게임에 넣기까지 생각보다 많은 개발자들의 노력이 필요하며(특히 여러 성장 단계가 있을 경우), 버그가 발생하기 쉽습니다. 이 인공지능을 개선하는 것도 개발자들이 현재 집중하는 부분 중 하나입니다.

참고로 배고픔 게이지에 대해 설명을 하자면, 먹이를 먹을 때 차는 짙은 초록색 게이지는 배에 들어간 먹이양을 뜻하며, 소화가 되면서 짙은 초록색 게이지가 떨어지고 옅은 초록색 배고픔 게이지가 찹니다. 배에 들어간 먹이가 모두 소화되면 배고픔 게이지가 떨어지기 시작합니다. 
스테미나는 걸을 때는 느리게, 앉아 있을 때에는 빠르게 회복됩니다. Q 버튼을 누르면 스테미나가 소모되지도 회복되지도 않는 빠른 걸음 상태가 됩니다. 빠르게 달리기 위해서는 그 경보 상태에서 벗어나야 합니다.

게임을 해 보신 분들은 티렉스나 랩터 등이 깃털이 있다는 것을 눈치채셨을 텐데, 티라노사우루스는 최근 몸 대부분이 비늘로 덮여 있었다는 것이 밝혀져, 사우리안 제작팀은 이에 맞춰 바꿀 것이라는 의향을 밝혔습니다. 하지만 랩터들의 경우에는 깃털이 있었다는 증거가 뚜렷해 유지될 것으로 보입니다.
사우리안 팀은 공룡 과학 고증에 맞추기 위해 전문가들과 소통하고 개발자들 스스로도 논문을 읽으며, 앞으로도 최신 과학을 반영해 계속 업데이트할 것이라고 합니다. 
(고증의 예를 들자면, 다코타랍토르가 앞으로 6-8미터를 점프하는 능력은 공기역학 과학자의 조언을 따른 것임니다. 여기서 게임팁을 드리자면, 점프 성공 확률을 높이기 위해서는 먹이 뒤로 가까이 다가가서 짧게 점프를 하는 것이 좋습니다.)

많은 분들이 게임 컨텐츠에 비해 2만원이 넘는 가격이 비싸다 생각하실 텐데, 저도 동의합니다. 이 가격은 정식 발매 가격을 기준으로 정한 것이며, 정식 발매를 한다 해서 가격을 더 올리지 않을 것이라고 합니다. 실제로 사우리안 제작자분들 중 한명의 말에 따르면, 게임을 나중에 산다 해서 더 비싼 가격에 사는 게 아니니, 아직 게임이 부족하다 생각한다면 나중에 사도 된다 하셨습니다. 하지만 동시에 얼리 엑세스 수입이 게임개발에 큰 도움이 될 것이라고 하셨습니다. 고로 이 게임을 지금 사시는 분들은 게임에 투자를 하는 셈입니다.

게임 개발자들은 공식 사이트에 2주마다 게임 개발 현황을 올리니, 관심 있으신 분들은 참고하시기 바랍니다. 개발자들은 당분간은 게임 내 버그 해결이나 최적화에 집중하겠다 밝혔습니다. 

어떤 분이 운석충돌을 언급하셨는데, 이 모드는 정식 발매 후에야 나올 예정이니 오랫동안 보지 못할 것 같습니다. 운석 충돌 이후를 생존한다는 생각으로 플레이하는 모드입니다.

마지막으로, 위에서 말했다시피 사우리안은 정말 버그가 많아서, 현재 개발자 분들이 버그 개선을 최우선으로 삼고 있습니다. 많은 버그들이 사라진 후에 게임을 사는 것을 진심으로 추천드립니다.

사람들이 사우리안을 보고 컨텐츠가 없다고 이야기해대지만 제가 아직도 사우리안을 지지하는 이유는 지금 개발되는 공룡 게임들 중에서도 제작자들이 공룡에 대한 애착과 지식이 매우 뛰어난 편에 속하며, 이를 이용해서 게임을 제작할 수 있는 역량을 가장 잘 갖추었다고 생각하기 떄문입니다.

[b]The Devs seem more focused on a beautiful, perfectly accurate Hell Creek environment than actual content, mechanics, and enjoyment of the game.[/b]

[h1]Detailed Review:[/h1]
The Devs need to focus less on adding more meaningless creatures that do not affect your gameplay at all and also less on making them perfectly scientifically accurate, they are getting nowhere having to constantly remake the animals. I also noticed that it feels like they are making a museum exibit and not an actually enjoyable game to play. You feel more spectator than actually involved in the ecosystem. They've added a lot of small unimportant creatures that don't change gameplay but we don't even have all of Dakotaraptor's base content like nesting, we do not even have dying of old age yet! The only actual mechanics that has been added since release is climbing/gliding, which doesn't change gameplay very much honestly, and gradual growth, which looks really great but stuff like that shouldn't be what the Devs are working on right now! They need to be working more on core gameplay than polisher stuff like that.
The Devs seem more focused on a beautiful, perfectly accurate Hell Creek environment than actual content, mechanics, and enjoyment of the game.

The Devs have a great informative Devlog ever few weeks which is great, they are also friendly, but the updates are very slow to come. They show great animations and models, but when added, the creatures don't change the gameplay! I mean, do we really need both Acheroraptor and Pectinodon at this very early stage when Dakotaraptor breeding isn't even in?

There is also not nearly enough mechanics and content to keep you engaged. You grow up, sure, but then think, ""Alright, now what?"" since there's nothing new past Adult stage. No breeding, territory claiming, not even dying of age to strive for.

[h1]Rating:[/h1]
I'd recommend you wait a long time, maybe until full release if the Devs can stop being perfectionists and ever make what they consider a full release.

Rating: 3/10\

EDIT: Devs have stopped posting devlogs and are silent now. This game could have been something special, now I am thinking it will never leave very early access. :(

A lot of content is lacking but the devs plan on adding as time goes on; I will not list the missing promised content since that would add a lot more extra fluff to this review; but basically if you're asking  ""is this bit that was promised on kickstarter in yet?  questions, they can currently mostly be answered with ""nope"". BUT this is an EA game and features should be added down the line; it is still worth noting thou, but i digress;

The good stuff;
- Dinosaur Models are very nice with lots of nice little details
- Animations for the most part are also very well done and the movement system is nice and fluid


The bad / dissapointing stuff;
- The Ai; my god is the AI in this game currently bad, they plan on improving but as of right now it is just slightly better than Arks dinosaurs (little exaggerated but NOT by that much at all); they eat and drink which is neat but for the most part they ignore your existence entirely or if they do aggro to you they only do so momentarily before going back to ignoring you or go off to stand staring into the void. The majesty and wonder of the Hell creek formation ecosystem is dissapointing when the dinos are mindless souless robots standing in a field waiting to die.


This Ai problem leads to the next weakness;
- Difficulty and lack of a sense of achievment;  When the only threat to your survival is the AI creatures and they are too busy stuffing crayons up their own noses the game is an absolute cake walk; i only died when i went and did stupid stuff like attacking an adult trex or trike to see how it would react. Sadly the lack of threat and content leads to the game feeling rather dull and boring since the only thing to do 'late game' as an adult is to explore and see what stupid scenarios the AI can get itself into.

-Environemt; currently is empty and not interesting, lighting issues and lack of many animal species currently makes the world you're living in feel empty even if accurate. I would like to see the environment be improved graphically since it is something you will be staring at for the entirty of your play time, you can have all the scientifically accurate plants you want but if its just plain ugly to look at most of the time (especially at night with the current contrast) it doesnt enthrall me to explore the world you've built.

- Performance & bugs; Performance across the board for this game is poor, massive frame drops and stuttering especially during dusk and night time transitions. Major area to improve on. Lots of bugs too, worth mentioning even if an early access game.



This game has a lot of potential to be a fun and educational game for people interested in dinosaurs, I hope the devs will improve and deliver the promised features and improvements and hopefully that will change this review to a positive one, but currently I just can't recommend this title.

While there isn't much content as of yet, the game in its current form is worth a buy for any dinosaur or animal enthusiast. As of writing this review, you're able to take control of a Dakotaraptor from infancy to adulthood in the dangerous, prehistoric Hell Creek. You can explore the terrain, though there isn't much variation, and encounter other animals (including the famous Tyrannosaurus rex) through the eyes of your raptor. The game itself isn't very optimized, but, as it is Early Access, I'm optimistic in that regard. The animal design in the game is famous for having the most paleontological accuracy of any game out there, and it really shows. The attention to detail in each creature provides for a very immersive experience, as the dinosaurs feel right at home in the environment. Definitely purchase this game if you'd like to support the devs, and be sure to keep an eye on it even if you don't want to buy it in its current state.

_______________________________________

(Review as of 31/07/2017)
Saurian is a long time coming for most of us. Probably the first full 3D dinosaur game in history that has a sole and proper focus on realism in it's creatures and environments. It's still a pre-alpha, there isn't an absolutely huge amount to do other than survive but what's there is an exciting indication of the future.

To explain the current gameplay; 
Basically you begin life as a Dakotaraptor hatchling, it's quickly explained that Dakotaraptors are terrible parents (and one will usually eat one of your siblings just...to prove that point) and you're then off to fend for yourself. You'll start life scavenging and hunting small lizards before you progress in a vaguely Isle-esque system in that the longer you survive the more exp you accrue until the point you can develop into the next maturity stage. Other than yourself (only Dakota playable for now) you'll find Triceratops, T.Rex, Pachycephalosaurus and a handful of other ambient creatures such as particularly brutal little crocodiles. 
You wander the world, meet other dinosaurs, run away from other dinosaurs, and try to survive. It feels like a living and breathing ecosystem wherein there's other stuff always going on even if you're not involved. It's definitely a little buggy and janky, the night-time looks absolutely bizarre with weird colours and effects everywhere, and swimming is a crapshoot as to whether you'll make it or begin incessantly vibrating... but it's a pre-alpha, you go into this looking for the beginnings of a game that could be something special, and I think that's what Saurian is.

And to finish off I'm just going to go ahead and plug my own gameplay of it under the guise of showing you guys what the game is like but really just whoring myself out for views.
Much love.

PS; You might need a decent graphics card, there are minimum and recommended requirements, from experience you WILL need to meet atleast the minimum requirements!",1501715823,1501715823,True,5,1,0.554225742816925049,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Unforuntately, it hasn't lived up to the hype. They planned on releasing more than 1 dinosaur within a couple years, I've owned this game since before launch (Backer on Kickstarter), and they STILL only have 1 playable dinosaur.

I am highly recommending AGAINST Saurian for my dino-loving friends. Sorry guys! They didn't live up to their hype.",1501715815,1599088642,False,1,0,0.521963834762573242,1,False,False,True,False,,,

Let me just say this right now. If you are looking for an incredibly hooking experience that will supply you with joy for weeks on end, this is not it. This game does not have a lot of content, and that should be expected given that it's living the life of an animal. An animal's life isn't as varied and as engaging most people think it is, as its the simple style of doing everything an animal does: eating/hunting, drinking, fuckin, you know, the 3 necessities.

Rather, it is a game that one can have a lot of fun with experience in a session or two, and being a worthwhile memorable experience that one would come back to once in a while. If the devs play their cards right I can easily see it becoming another one of those obscure gems that people remember fondly.

For what it is right now, I say it is worth the purchase.",1501715514,1501715514,True,104,4,0.801201403141021729,4,False,False,True,False,,,
