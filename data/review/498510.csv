Tried this on my new VR computer, worked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  I don't understand the Chinese narrator dialog.  Still requires huge play space but don't provide a teleport locomotion.  That beginning loading screen might cause motion sickness for some players.  After you pass the portal, you can pick up object and place on floor in a socket.  Then you have 3 statues with bowls, you set fire to the 3 bowls.  Then you turn an object to the right direction.  Then you watch scary cutscene, then read credits.   At the credits, there is no Quit button or return to beginning. You have to use the Steam back button to exit the experience or VR.   I use WalkinVR program to get around my lack of room and the lack of teleport. I guess the blue guy speaking in Chinese is telling you what to do.   The VR puzzles were easy enough to figure out.

Old Negative Review:
DreamLand is a free VR experience game.  It worked to a point on my system, looked ok, sounded ok, played to a point.  The loading screen was ok.  There is a beginning room with a portal, that is where i am stuck.   The portal room looked good and stable on my system.  I have only 2.1m x 2.1m of play space. This game is voice in Chinese only.  

CONS:
 = This game apperently requires huge amount of playspace.
= There is no instructions, help, tutorial.
= There is no locomotion system. All you can do is walk in your playspace.
= There is no recentering or reorrientation of your play space on the game map.
= There is No notice of how much play space is required.

I had absolutely no issues. You do need a roomscale setup. The whole experience took me around 7 minutes and I was taking my time and also stayed at the end credit screen for like a minute as well (had to exit out manually). All the audio is in a foreign language (Mandarin probably). However, I was able to finish the experience without having read any spoliers so it's not difficult to follow along to what you're supposed to do.

I don't think you need a large play area to finish this experience. Probably the hardest puzzle was figuring out how to start the experience. I pressed trigger on both of my Touch Controllers. The visuals were nice and the experience ran smoothly. Just make sure you can pick stuff up from the ground and can at least walk a few small steps left and right of center.

Rate 6/10. It's free and it's a mostly cinematic experience with very light puzzle elements. Download once and uninstall experience, but definitely one of the better ones.",1521781244,1521781244,True,1,0,0.533073961734771729,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game requires a LARGE play area. I have close to a 3 meter x 3 meter play area and both of the initial braziers were out of my chaperone bounds. Thankfully one was by an open walkway area that I could reach around the wall to light the brazier however I wasn't so lucky with the second one which was through a wall. I had the small hope that I could get the right angle to light it but sadly that was game over.

It seems like it could be decent if I could have proceeded but I can't recomend as there are game breaking feature gaps.

There are plenty of free experiences out there that are just as short as this and I recommend you try them all, but there are two critical issues with this one: It's entirely in a foreign language (Japanese?) and you may not be able to complete it due to the objects that you must interact with being just outside of your game play area. I got lucky that I was able to reach beyond my gameplay area because 3 of the 4 sides of my roomscale are only partially limited (e.g. one side is a counter separating my living room from my kitchen) and luckily I was able to interact with all the ""pieces"" to what essentially boils down to a very simple puzzle game. All 3 braziers that I needed to light were outside my play area and I got luck on all 3--if it would have been in a slightly different place where I couldn't reach beyond (like the 1 whole side of my play area that is a wall) then I wouldn't have been able to complete it. There is not teleport ability that I can tell, but then again the little Japanese speaking ghost might have been telling me exactly how to do that but I don't speak Japanese. I messed around with the controls a little but not too much because it wasn't all that compelling regardless. The ending isn't very good (I won't say more just in case you do decide to check it out). One last flaw is that they haven't optimized it very well. I have an oc'ed gtx 1080 and I don't get too many scenes in VR games that are at all juttery but the entire ending was nearly unplayable, in fact if it would have continued for any longer I would have just quit the game.
