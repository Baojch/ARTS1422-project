They don't hold up at all nowadays. I'm sure this was good when it came out 7 years ago but now VR has evolved way beyond this game. 

The graphics are outdated and so is the gameplay. Puzzles are very simple and straight forward except the last one. That one was frustrating. First I had to search for 2 numbers from a lab with randomly floating objects. I tried to catch them but to no avail, some were stuck between some walls and created this irritating continuous bouncing sound. After trying to grab the logical items like a floppy disc and a tape recorder for fifteen minutes, I gave up and looked the answer online. I was shocked to read that the numbers had nothing to do with these floating objects. One of them was actually on a piece of paper stuck on a back wall of a table on a random spot. That's puzzle for you, find a note in a room.. 

I had several bugs and severe staggering while playing. For example on the first area, always when I looked up my VR head POV floated like 10 centimetres higher and the same happened when I looked down. This was very nausea inducing. I had to stop playing for a while and drink ginger infused water (it might helps some people in VR sickness) because of this.
Even worse was that in the relatively long narrative final where the player just stands still and watches and listens, my in game hand was staggering all around like crazy and a ""Not being able to track"" text and my Index play area grid flashed constantly in the screen. Pretty immersion breaking. 

The game is also very short so you will not get value for your money even with a decent sale. Absolutely no replay value. 

There were some positive things in the game. The overall setting and atmosphere were nice and the sound and music was OK. Overall I did not enjoy my time with this game. If this would have been free, I would have left a recommendation, but to pay money for this frustrating experience? No.

I couldn't get into it as the ""blink""/teleportation is as accurate as a reporter for CNN.

You can rotate direction before teleporting, sure, but pinballing my way around a level by using the background elements to limit/trick the game to letting me travel to the middle of a playfield instead of the edge all the time isn't my idea of fun.

When I saw it's release date I was expecting very basic game with clunky mechanics and rather uninspiring gameplay. But it was on sale, so I grabbed both episodes for just a few bucks. And oh boy, I enjoyed this game so much. 

The synopsis of the story - you are going to an island to find your sister that left a message for you. Whole game is built around exploring this island. This may sound a little bit simplistic, but it's little details that makes such story works. And Call of the Starseed have a lot of them - throughout the game you will find maps, tapes, rock paintings that bit by bit tell you a story of this place, who was there, what happened to this place. Some things that you finding out at first glance does not have a lot sense or unrelated but in fact this is false assumption - everything you find out makes sense, but you understand this only after going throgh related stage of the game. I really like such small touches in games because this is what makes enjoyable to think about them after completion. For example, when you going down, you can see here combination of Chtulhu, dragon and alien - just a fan-service, at first glance, but only at first.

I also enjoyed visuals in this game. In fact, game looks better when you play then what you see on screenshots. And more to this, in 2 hours of gameplay there is quite a variety of location each with its recognizable design

Another strong point of this games are puzzles - this game combines a great balance between puzzle complexity and amount/quality of tips and the use of VR mechanics. Immersion is really strong here thanks to puzzles being built around VR technologies (I am looking at you, Doctor Who: The Edge Of Time). Also thanks to this, there is almost no situations when you don't understand, what game wants from you - most of the time it's pretty clear, what you need to achieve, the question is how you will do this.

As disadvantages, I have 1,5 points:
1. Controls - in case of oculus headset you need to press on stick of main hand to let you teleport. This is very unpleasant way to implement locomotion. My thumb was really hurting at the end of each session. Moreover, there is no reason for this to be implemented like this - you have buttons on your controller with no actions bind to them - why not to use them instead is a great mystery for me
0.5 Length of the game. I put it as a half of point because it's actually justifiable. First of all, this game is packed with action - something going on all the time, there is no fillers. And the second, title says that this is episode 1. And this game should be perceived exactly like this - this is not an independent game, it has episode 2 that starts exactly when episode 1 ends and they should be played together as one piece. It is also mirrored in price. If you will take a look at this from such perspective - this game as a whole is not so short and there is a major improvement for the second episode in pretty much everything

So, all in all, I definitely recommend this game to everyone who has VR headset. This game has interesting story, great pacing, puzzles, visuals, diverse set of locations and overall it makes a great experience. I will just add that I played this game after I completed Half-Life: Alyx and HL didn't ruin this game for me - I think it is kind of a result, especially for the game that was made at the dawn of modern VR era",1661294982,1661294982,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In short, I think they are, though that's largely down to Episode 2, even with the knowledge that Episode 3 may or may not ever be released.
If you can pick up Ep 1 and Ep 2 together for under $10-15, I think they're worth it.  (Personally, here in 2022 I think they'd do well to give away Ep 1 for free, and sell Ep 2 for $10-12.)
Episode 1 was released in 2016, and Episode 2 followed in 2017.   One of the biggest improvements in Ep 2 was the addition of smooth locomotion control options, which are sorely missed in Ep 1.
Each game could be described as a ""story-driven walking simulator with occasional puzzle elements"", with most puzzles taking the form of mini-game style challenges, especially in Ep 2.
Ep 1 is mostly linear, and takes around 1.5 - 2hrs to complete.  Ep 2 manages to wring about 3-4 hrs of play from a similar number of environments because each area needs to be revisited at least once or twice  - sometimes to use an item found elsewhere, and sometimes to explore previously-inaccessible parts of the level.  That said, while there is a similar ""volume"" of world to explore in Ep 2, the areas are much more detailed and interesting than those in Ep 1.

Ukończenie gry bez osiągnięć, to jakieś 2 godziny, ale jeśli chcesz wymaksować, to przyjdzie Ci grać dłużej.

GRAFIKA:
Grafika jest niezła, jak na ogół produkcji i rok powstania 2016, a klimat lochów i machin, oraz imienia protagonistki ""Alex"" przypomina nieco najważniejszy tytuł VR w historii od twórców Steam'a.
Gra oparta jest o historię, która ma kontynuację w drugiej części gry.

WYDAJNOŚĆ I STEROWANIE:
Na Oculus Quest 2  gra działa na maksymalnych ustawieniach, a jej wydajność jest zależna od karty graficznej (3060 Ti)
Na Oculus Quest 2 grę można uruchomić przez AirLink zarówno w trybie SteamVR jak i Oculus VR i ten drugi sposób polecam, bo sterowanie jest o wiele lepsze.
Nie da się włączyć literek, więc niektóre kwestie dialogowe oraz nagrania z kaset zawierające podpowiedzi mogą Ci umknąć.

CEL GRY:
Gra polega na przemierzaniu lokacji i rozwiązywania łamigłówek na podstawie obserwacji otoczenia oraz wskazówek na kartkach i taśmach. Nie ma wrogów i nie można zginąć.
Autozapis jest wykonywany co rozdział, czyli chyba około 5 razy w trakcie gry.

CENA:

Even six years later, it feels like a decent VR experience.

What gives its age away is limited locomotion.  Only ""comfort"" artificial movement is allowed: teleport and snap turning.  VR gamers today expect continuous locomotion/rotation for a game like this.

The game itself is an adventure game, but is very light on gameplay.  It has periodic puzzles, but is mostly moving forward and watching/listening to scripted sequences.  Silly and foolish people will call this a walking simulator, but that's a meaningless term nobody should ever take seriously.

The voice acting was distinctly Canadian, despite it apparently taking place in the United States with Americans.  If I can, as an American, pronounce ""aboat,"" then surely a Canadian voice actor could pronounce it ""about"" if they're supposed to be playing an American.  Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell games has this problem in spades.

I was surprised at how quickly the game ended.  The developers seem to have focused on production values and wow-factor, and they did well in that area.  I'm sure this game was a treat back in 2016.  However, the story continues in Episode 2, and I think Episode 1 did a good job setting things up.  You all have got my attention.  I hope Episode 2 can follow through.

There are many complaints about controls with this game.  I had problems, too, when I tried running it with OpenVR/SteamVR.  Launching it for Oculus Rift worked fine, but I was not given credit for any Steam Achievements.  I ever-so-slightly care about getting achievements, so that was a bit of a disappointment.

I think the game is still in 2021 a nice experience because it shows how far VR has come in 5 Years and in some ways it was ahead of its time.

For Context:
i played the Game now for the first time on an Oculus Quest 2 via Virtual Desktop with a nearly 4k Display (+ oversampled) and 120hz.

Review:
If you played some of the major VR milestones the last 1-2 Years like Half Life Alyx or Boneworks you will notice the Age of this game for sure. Only Teleport movement, not every item is completly physics based, interaction is a little bit limited etc. My expectation was not very high because i knew how much VR has evolved since then. But the game surprised me, i think the movement and gameplay mechanics aged well. I got very quickly used to the teleport again and it wasn`t breaking my immersion as much as i thougt. I was very impressed how good hand and object interaction and the physical invetory were implemented. It reminded me much of the early Valve demos (these demos were industry leading masterclass in 2015/16) and holds up very well today. The Graphics looks aged but i think especially on modern Hardware the Enviroments, art Design and dynamic shadows looks still good. Sound Design and especially the voices sound great. The game is still after 5 Years immersive and have great atmosphere. Texture Resolution is very low for today's standard. The thing is, you have to keep in mind at what time in the industry this game launched. The Fact that it still holds up today means that it was 2016 an industry leading and shaping new experience. I have to give it credit for what it was in 2016. If i had played back then with high end VR Hardware it would have been a absolutly mindblowing experience.

Do not buy it if you are used to the ""normal"" movement controls in 2021. How you can use the analogue stick to rotate so you can look at where you want to look at and push it around to move around....you know...like how your intuition tells you. I played , and I should have said I suffered thru the first chapter. It's a story driven puzzle game and I really wanted to like this since I'm sick of zombie games. 

One thing this game does great is the puzzle factor I must say. It's a constant puzzle you need to solve to barely move around. I gave up at 0.8 hours appearantly after the first chapter. I just can't deal with it. So here is the thing. You can only move by teleporting and to teleport you need to press the left analog button - then move your head around to aim and also you rotate the pressed analogue stick to change where you'll face after you land the teleportation. But here is the trick: since you are moving your head to aim and most of the time you have to rotate your head/waist to do that, your rotation on the analogue stick does not let you face where you want to face because you were not looking forward when you initiated the teleportation. This becomes such a shitfest in close quarters especially because ,say, you want to rotate 90 to left, but you have little room to do that and so you need to look all the way down and also press/rotate the stick but you should not change the direction where you are looking at because you dont end up looking at where you want when the teleportation happens. So many times I had to look somewhere random where there is room in front of me, and aim backwards , teleport once, then now I can do the second teleportation which will end up where I want to be and miraculously looking at where I want to look. This is the main puzzle of the game. Go where you want to go and meanwhile be able to look where you want to look....in 2021.

Call of the Starseed ist der Beginn der inzwischen zwei Teile umfassenden Adventure-Reihe The Gallery. Bereits 2016 erschienen, gehört es zu den früheren VR-Titeln auf dem Markt. Doch wirklich anmerken tut man das dem Rätselspiel nicht.
Das Know-how beim Einsatz der Bewegungssteuerung (gespielt mit Oculus Touch) stimmt bei Einwickler Cloudhead Games jedenfalls. Die Rätsel sind nämlich zum Großteil nicht sonderlich komplex aufgebaut, doch stellen unsere Fingerfertigkeit und unsere Aufmerksamkeitsgabe durch VR-Mechaniken auf die Probe, die einfach Spaß machen. Elegant ist auch die Inventarumsetzung gelöst, denn durch einen Griff über die Schulter verstauen wir nicht nur gefundene Objekte, sondern ziehen auch unseren Rucksack ins Blickfeld, um auf bestimmte Utensilien zugreifen zu können. Die Texturen wirken zwar teilweise relativ schwammig, doch die Spielwelt ist dennoch stimmungsvoll und hübsch gestaltet. Einzig die Fortbewegung, die nur durch Teleport möglich ist, hat sich ein klein wenig schwerfällig angefühlt, weil die Schwarzblende nach einem Port gefühlt einen Tick zu lang war.
Aber worum geht es eigentlich? In Call of the Starseed spielen wir als eine junge Frau in den 80ern, die nach ihrer Zwillingsschwester sucht und dabei an einem geheimnisvollen Ort an der kanadischen Westküste gelandet ist. Assistiert von einem nicht so einfach einschätzbaren Professor rutschen wir in ein Abenteuer, das deutlich größere Ausmaße annimmt, als es anfangs erscheint. Auch wenn mich die Dialoge oder die optionalen Audiologs in Kassettenform nicht mit ihrer Raffinesse beeindruckt haben und mir die Charaktere noch relativ egal sind, bin ich doch gespannt, wie es in Episode 2 weitergeht. Denn der generelle Storyverlauf und die angeteasten Hinweise während der etwa zweistündigen Reise lassen doch einiges an Potenzial zu. 
Schön waren auch die recht zahlreich vorkommenden interaktiven Objekte in der Spielwelt, auch abseits von rätselrelevanten Dingen. So kann man am nächtlichen Lagerfeuer Popcorn zu launigen 80er-Songs floppen (das andere Wort lässt Steam nicht zu..) oder Feuerwerk über die Küste steigen lassen. Das klingt erstmal nicht so spektakulär, aber wer die Vorzüge von VR kennt, wird wahrscheinlich verstehen, wie viel Spaß solche vermeintlich simple Dinge machen können. Gut zur geheimnisvollen Spielwelt passt zudem der cineastische Soundtrack von Jeremy Soule, der auch an Produktionen wie Skyrim, Guild Wars oder Icewind Dale beteiligt war.

[h3]Call of the Starseed überzeugt mit großteils simplen aber spaßigen Rätseln, trotz seines Alters elegant umgesetzten VR-Mechaniken und gerade anfangs mit tollen 80er-Vibes! Die Story darf das in diesem Teil aufgebaute Potenzial in Part 2 dann aber gerne noch besser nutzen.[/h3]

这一部作品是我当初最早玩过有“背包”概念的游戏：把手放到肩膀后，物品会自动收入背包，需要时再从背后掏出来；现在这几乎成为了所有虚拟现实游戏的标配。作为第一批尝试制作VR游戏的作品，它有许多操作如今看来并不便利，比如移动只能传送，并且速度很慢，比如双手抓物品会发生冲突，比如不能原地转朝向等等，整体游戏内容也偏简单，更类似于体验，但是它也进行了许多有益的尝试：可以烤爆米花，可以放烟花，可以把蜡烛放进水里熄灭，可以用手玩投篮游戏，还制作了一个含有巨大建筑物、快速漂浮的结局，让初入vr的人体会到沉浸的独特魅力。由于目前虚拟现实大作仍稀缺，所以本作是一部说过时不完全过时，但确实已经可以归为吃螃蟹一代的游戏。",1616921294,1616921294,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I blindly purchased the game only knowing that it involved puzzles and remembering that I had played a free demo some years ago! I didn't watch the trailer or read any reviews. Simply bought it and jumped straight in. Immediately I hated the fact that it's teleport only but with room scale in mind and once I saw that the games prompts were Vive wands I realized that his must be one of the OG VR titles which it is! Apart from the movement system, the inventory system is decent and better and some of the more recent titles I've played believe it or not. The graphics are actually pretty good as well. I'd rate them an 8/10 given this was released back in 2016 and the fact that it's not an expensive title. It is short though you can complete the game in less than an hour and a half or so. I took longer because I enjoy messing with every little thing in games. Without spoiling anything, the very first puzzle actually made me use my brain and the last one was more of a guessing game but not hard either. And the ending.....ah man, that was a treat, and my right hand is numb XD. Overall I'd rate this game a solid 9/10, again, being as though this was released back in 2016.

Edit: Oh wow! After launching the game directly from Steam instead of through Steam VR I was prompted to chose between Open VR Mode and Oculus Mode. NOW I have more customizable options within the game and the controls are much better now! I'm able to adjust the size of my hands as well as the skin color. I however noticed that before (In OpenVR Mode) I was able to flick the lighter open like in real life but now I have to pull the trigger to do so. Whelp, time to play the game all over again as my first play through was rather uncomfortable, but finding this just changed everything!

Also, don't mess with the in-game super sampling if you're already doing so externally. When done while running the game in Oculus mode it immediately causes your video to become zoomed in with a fish eye effect and can only be reverted by restarting the application (the game).",1610841191,1610843452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As VR games go, this is a fairly empty puzzler in an overstuffed world. Almost every object in the world can be used for something. It can be set on fire, or held up to an ear, or thrown or is important for the story. That adds quite a bit of enjoyment to the game.  This is good, because there's really not much in the actual game after that. The problem is that there's just so much world that you can be easily led astray overthinking a problem. For example, the flare gun appears to only be used once, and I can't recall if a paper note was ever important.

The puzzles, of which there are maybe three of note, are generally reasonably obvious or brute-forceable, even when they're somewhat broken. The water-wheel puzzle controls are wonky and the elevator control panel is internally inconsistent, but both have enough slop in them that it doesn't matter. The maze is easier to just stumble through than it is to actually navigate -- the 'blink' navigation is strangely languid, and it is incredibly easy to get your directions reversed. Lastly, the vacuum tube puzzle is ... not great.

Otherwise, controls are pretty good, although you're advised to make some adjustments to the locomotion system. The backpack mechanic is novel and works well. I'd like to see more games use it. I'd have liked to have been able to put a playing tape back in the pack, though, and still heard it continuing. The cassette tapes left all over the world are strange -- some of them appear to be vital, while others can be missed. They're usually entertaining, though, and add a bit more to the weak story in the game.

The end of the game, when it comes, is a bit of a surprise -- that's it? -- and ends with a thorough lecturing by another creepy guy followed by a credit sequence through a 90s gfx demo. 

It's just weird.

I don't think this is worth the full asking price, especially if you're going to end up picking up the sequel as well. On sale together in a package, might get a stronger recommendation from me.

In general, I enjoyed it, and would like to see more from the writers, artists, and developers, but this game alone is something that can be missed. We'll see if my opinion changes once I've completed the second chapter.

I am not sure whether I will be able to play this game and so cannot recommend at present. The controls are so clumsy compared to todays games.  I have an Oculus Rift S and with modern games I am used to smooth rotation to find the direction I want and then either a smooth teleport or natural walk option to get to where I want to be.  These modern controls are so subtle that its easy to forgot your in a game and that's how it should be.   However the controls for this game are very clumsy, I have to press the joystick in and then rotate to where I want to go and make sure that I then orientate the direction I want to face in and its not a natural flow of movement and not very accurate and so everytime I want to move and explore its a chore that I am not sure I can be bothered to endure. I am reminded everytime that I am in a game thats hard to control and thats no fun :(

It's incredibly short and boring. You get a whole bunch of items that you only ever use once, such as the flare gun, which you use to shoot a couple targets at the beginning of the game and never take it out again. There are only a few puzzles and they aren't very engaging (and puzzles are the extent of the gameplay). You find notes and tape recordings around the level that are entirely useless and bring no substance to the story. The voice acting from the only other visible character is acceptable, but the dialogue isn't well written and, again, has no substance. There are some missing features and annoying bugs that have not been fixed and likely never will. You cannot switch to movement via the stick, only teleportation (which is fairly well implemented). During the ending sequence and credits, my right controller started vibrating endlessly. Throwing objects is somewhat difficult, and some items float around as if in low gravity when dropped.

It took me less than two hours to complete. This includes the tutorial (which I went through twice), the super slow scrolling credits (which was apparently bugged and never actually ended the game, wasting time), and being idle on the menu while eating. I would guess it had no more than an hour of actual gameplay. No joke, the entire game is shown in the trailer. The second half is THE ending ""cinematic"" that plays after you beat the final puzzle.

I know this review is harsh, and I don't mean to hurt the developers. I have no doubt they put a lot of time and effort into making the core mechanics... but the game lacks content in a huge way. I have not played the second episode yet, but I think it would have been better off as a free content update for episode 1.

4) Inadequate gesture recognition. Several puzzles depend on putting puzzle pieces in the right place or catching items soaring through the air but gesture recognition frequently bugs out during them resulting in missed catches or picking up pieces when trying to place them.

どういうことかというと、本作は古き悪しき時代のアドベンチャー・ゲームをそのままVRにしたような内容なのだ。
最初のエリアの「パズル」をネタバレにならない程度に書いていくと、まず「ストーリー」的に説明が付かない上に何の思考も要求されないVR版ピクセル・ハントから始まる。本当にピクセルを探すわけではないが、VRではまずやらない行動を要求される（平面ゲームでもあまりやらない人が多いことで有名な行動である）。
その次の「パズル」も、何の理由もなく特定のオブジェクトを撃つというもの。当然「ストーリー」的にも無意味。

この時点で相当なクソゲーだが、VRの神髄を味わえるのはこの後だ。パラノイア（ということになっていて「私はパラノイアです」と口で言うだけで、実質的な個性は皆無）のおじさんがサイドキックとなり、「パズル」を解いていくのだが……。このGMPCがなんとも不快で、一々「まだ解けないんか？　オラもう待ちくたびれたぞ～」「もしかしておめえゲェジなんか？」「ひゃーっ、おめえこんな球も捕れないんか！　こんくらい悟天でも取れっぞ！」などと罵ってくる始末である。
しかも最後のキャッチボールに関しては、飛び始めはElder Scrolls顔負けのフワフワ物理演算なのに落下し始めると急加速するという、消える魔球を放ってきておいてそんなことを言うのだからもうどうしようもない。俺にクソゲーをけしかけたのは貴様だ、そんなこと言えるのかよ！
この浮浪者のおっさんは常にどうでもいいことや煽りをペラペラ喋り続けるのだが、その間にもオーディオログは登場する。なんとかおじさんの科白の隙間を縫って再生するしかない（尤もオーディオログの内容も等しくどうでもいいのだが）。
それとこのおじさん、一挙一投足がめちゃくちゃ遅い。CoDやなんかでNPCのドア開け待ちを強いられることがあるが、VRであれをやられると本当に時間の無駄であることがよく分かる。平面ならば鼻や爪をほじったり、埃を捨てたりする程度のことはできるからだ。

しかしこのおじさんもまだ序の口で、エンディング（というか第二章という名の本編の宣伝）にて登場する新たなおじさんは更にのろまで、科白の内容も更に作者の自己満足丸出しで中身が皆無になっている。このおじさんと同じ部屋に閉じ込められるシーンが何分あるのか分からないが、体感では40分以上に感じた。

操作性に関しても、テレポート＋ルームスケール移動という形式である以上必然と言えるが、とても悪い。この形式では（特に床に落ちたものを拾うとき等に）ゲームに没入するというより現実の部屋と格闘して、現実に開けているスペースとゲーム内で腕を伸ばしたいスペースの方向を合わせることに苦心する羽目になるわけだ（ケーブルに絡まるという問題もある）。それを軽減するために、スティック（トラックパッド）左右の入力で視界を回転させることができたり、テレキネシスが使えたりする……というのが没入感を削がないためのデザインである。
特に後者は見た目的にはリアルじゃないが、VRという媒体においてはあるほうが没入感がある。たとえ物理的にスペースがあっても、手にコントローラーを持ったまま床にあるオブジェクトを拾うという時点で極めて違和感のある行動だからだ。だが本作には、そういうVRならではの工夫などは一切見られない。

それどころか、積極的に没入感を削ごうとしている節すらある。というのも、私は下水道――なぜクソゲーは下水道に拘るのだ？――のシーンで片手に地図、もう片手に懐中電灯を持とうとしたのだが、（一時的には可能だが）それは不可能だった。
何故ならインベントリーはリュックサックの形になっており、それをしまうには掴んで背中に持っていく必要があるため、両手が塞がっていてはできないからだ。インベントリーから取りだしたアイテムを地面に置くことはできないので、両手にアイテムを持つにはリュックサックを捨てていかなければならないわけである。（ちなみに地図は大して意味がないので見る必要はないのだが、問題はそこではない）。

ところでbuilt-for-VRなどと謳っている本作だが、だとすれば浅はかとしか言いようのないグラシック演出がある。それはレンズフレアだ。平面ゲームでさえ莫迦げている演出だが、Virtual Realityと呼ばれる媒体では論外である。顔を振るとそれに合わせてレンズフレアが目の前でぐるぐるしている様には失笑もできない。
主人公は顔にディスプレイを括り付けて、カメラの映像をそこに映して見ているのだろうか？　そんな滑稽な人間がいたら見てみたいものである。

……このようにVRという媒体は、クソゲーの世界にプレイヤーを閉じ込めることで通常のクソゲーの不快感を倍々に増幅して与えることが可能だと分かる。水責めに代わる強化尋問技術として某国情報局がVRゲームの利用を検討しているとの噂だが、それも頷ける話である。",1562434146,1562435347,False,5,2,0.557450234889984131,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Also, if you're OK with teleport locomotion and get the game, then don't configure it to teleport with the right controller. It's completely broken.

So, as someone with a Windows MR headset - the game is a little buggy like most others on steam that say they're set for MR.  The position of the hands that take the place of your controllers is really weird, like they're stuck on at a wrong angle - but you get used to that. It does mean that switching from look to teleport to pointing instead is awkward, but since it's a option you have to turn on i'll give them a pass.  Like most other MR games on Steam throwing is more awkward than it should be - but you only have to do it once in the game.  Weirdly enough, catching is really awkward and that is required some, but there's no penalty for getting it wrong so it's just a nuisance.  There was also a bug during the credits where the right controller would not stop vibrating.

As for the experience itself, it's great, and definitely gives that fun 80s adventure movie vibe.  Think a telltale game meets The Goonies. The game parts however... need some work.  Part of this is forgivable, since this is a very early VR game, but some really doesn't make sense.

For instance, there's a pretty long tutorial that covers how the teleport movement and manipulating objects works before the game proper starts.  That's fine, except there's another tutorial once you're in the game on how to interact with objects that stay in your inventory, and dealing with your inventory itself. Why not just cover that in the first out of world tutorial and let everything else happen in world?

The puzzle design needs some work too. It's so bad that I hesitate to call most of them puzzles until the last one which feels like something out of an old school adventure game, with all the good and bad that entails.  The biggest issue is that they need someone to better design them visually, since often the visuals of a puzzle don't match the solution.

(SPOILER WARNING FOR BASICALLY EVERY PUZZLE IN THE GAME) 
One early puzzle has you throw something at a box, but instead of simply pointing out the box and letting you figure out how to get at it the game explicitly tells you to throw something at it.  Once you have what's in the box it's clear what you're supposed to do but completely unclear as to why, and what exactly is going on when you do it.  Later there's a maze that they give you a map to, except the map is more confusing than just walking through the ""maze"" since there are arrows on the wall telling you where to go. Later you have to do a ""puzzle"" where you have to put some circuitry together that has color coded wires on it - except the wires and coloring don't mach up at all in the solution, which in essence makes it the baby toy where you put the shaped pegs in the holes.  After all these you finally get a real puzzle at the end and it almost feels wrong, it's such a weird massive jump in the difficulty of the puzzles.  It's an actual puzzle, where you actually have to find clues around the environment, except the visual design and the way the puzzle acts are really poorly designed.  You can brute force the first three numbers, but the last number can't be. There's spots on the board that need to be filled but there's nothing visually connecting them to anything. The same clue is in the environment in two places for no reason.  Oh, and there's no way to set anything down so that you can think.
(OK THATS THE END OF SPOILING EVERY PUZZLE BUT SERIOUSLY THEY ARE VISUALLY AWFULLY DESIGNED)

There are a bunch of glowing reviews of this game from when it came out, but as of 2019 it doesn't have quite the same shine.  Yeah, playing with the popcorn and roman candles in the first scene is still neat, but it's not groundbreaking like it was when VR was first coming out.

The characters are wonderful and believable, but few, which fits kind of nicely with the story actually.

Story:
The story is awesome and makes you want the episode 2. At first you are story-wise relatively thrown into cold water,  I would have liked a little intro.
-> 9/10

Gameplay:
Quite good and quite immersive, many great ideas, but you can tell the age a bit. 
What bothered me is that you can't set the tape volume separately and yet quite a lot of background noise is there. 
A big minus is the handling of mapborders, when stepping in a wall, which can happen by mistake because of the partially low ingame ceilings , the field of vision is blurred. Unfortunately, all menus are blurred, too, which has the consequence that you can do nothing more than hope that you somehow teleport back into the game area or restart the game.
-> 6/10

Price-performance:
Like most VR games, the game is not too long, if you take your time and look at the many small details, it takes about 4 hours for a playthrough. Rushed it's doable in about 1-2 hours. So far so good, but since the game is ONLY story-based, the re-playability is literally zero. So the whole thing is more of a unique experience.

I got episodes 1 and 2 in the bundle offer for  25 €, and I would buy it again anytime.

The list price of 20 € is understandable, because really a lot of development work was done. Especially in comparison with various other VR titles it can be considered normal, but it is still not cheap. I'm not too shure if I would buy it for the full price.
-> 6/10

Conclusion:
All in all, I give the game a rating of 6.5  maybe 7/10 according to today's standards. (A year ago, it would probably have gotten a 7.5-8.)
BUT: The sequel (episode 2) is definitely a lot more refined and is absolutely worth it (about 8.5 / 10)! For story understanding, this episode is still recommended/necessary!",1542146623,1542146623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I would have found a locomotion option much more immersive. Teleporting makes the whole thing like one of those point and click games and I didn't buy into VR for that. The main NPC in the game was entertaining enough, and it was very pretty. Just not enough content I feel, but possibly my expectations are too high this being my first VR adventure experience.

Got this game with the vive for free. It's a unique & interactive game, well, episode! 

You are to figure out where your sister went as she is missing & on the way find clues & tapes. 
You get a backpack to store important items in, which you equip reaching over your shoulder which is a pretty neat mechanic, I would say.
This backpack is a 3D object with slots on it & it's easy to use, haven't had problems.

The game has a nice atmosphere to it, which ofcourse plays a big role for VR! 
Since I won't go into the story at all I'll just list some pro's & con's:

+ Nice atmosphere
+ Neat backpack mechanic
+ Some parts are very interactive
+ Love the light sources
+ Mysterious & interesting story

- Quite a short game (ofcourse it's only 1 episode, but 20 euro's... idk)
- Teleportation can sometimes be annoying (you aim with your head, however I believe you can change this in settings)

So overall, It's a nice game & I'll be sure to get the next episode, but I feel like the price is a bit too much for only 1 episode of about 2-3 hours of gameplay. Hopefully the story gets even more interesting in these other episodes!",1529082476,1529082476,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

There's a neat inventory system that uses a backpack, and parts of the story are told through cassette tapes that you play in your 'Tony' walkman. 

The universe is sci-fi and has an 80's feel (see the walkman mentioned above, as well as the soundtrack is a little Synthwave sounding).

I'd like to play more, the story was just getting interesting when it ended. 

Not sure I'll buy future games if they are this expensive and this short. Maybe once the entire series is complete and they charge about $15 for it, it would be worth it.

This is an amazing, immersive experience that I would recommend to everyone with the hardware, assuming you can warrant paying the frankly absurd base price, due to the length of this episode, get it on a good sale for sure.
It took me just a couple hours to complete, at a relatively slow pace. (Although in VR this easily felt like 5-6 hours.)

If I can make a suggestion, it would be that teleport locomotion helps to combat motion sickness, but for those of us who have already gotten over that issue, teleporting becomes a massive immersion break, so please, please, add a walking/sliding style locomotion system for the large amount of people who can handle it. Of course make this a toggle, with teleport being default.

Now on to the tricky bit:

I adore VR, I think the immersion value alone, if the game has the most basic support, is phenominal.
[i]That's the problem, I can't tell if the game itself is fantastic, or if it is simply being carried by my love of VR.[/i]

I think it does a good job of immersion, and scale, and takes advantage of almost every opportunity given for more immersion, especially in the lighting department, however, you will find a flashlight within the first few minutes, before it is even needed. This means that all the other lighting options are null and void from the start, such as the lighter used in a GIF in the description, that scene simply wouldn't happen, because you have a flashlight.

Last thing to remember is this an episodic game, so if you want to continue the story, you will need to pay for the other episodes. I have not done this at time of review, so cannot comment on the other episode(s).

[b]TLDR: Game/story is epic so far, but very short for the price, get it on sale. Highly recommended for less than $10.[/b]

~~~###~~~POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED~~~###~~~

[spoiler]
The end of this episode sees you activating an alien relic, and being transported to a strange ship looking thing to meet with some ?alien dude who seems evil, but friendly, but evil, but maybe friendly, and then the credits for this episode roll.
This ending, from the moment you activate the relic, to the credits rolling, is EPIC, making perfect use of VR to create a sense of scale. The ship for example, is HUGE, and it's in a massive underground cavern that is filled with flowing magma.

I won't go any further with spoilers, as I have given only experience spoilers, the story is yours to explore. (Cause I have no clue where it's going. XD)

What you think is the start of the game, might just be the end. HOWEVER, this is clearly because of the developers plans with the Eposidic style. You should consider this an intro. That being said, the 20$ price point is a little rough ONLY because of the length. Every other aspect of this game has me blown away and so exteremely excited for the future. The mechanics of this game really utilize VR controls and potential, something other games seem to struggle with sometimes. This game makes you throw, catch, move, investigate closely, and do things simple things that reinforce the immersion. At one point i was kneeling only the floor for over 20 minuets playing with a massive electrical board making fine adjustments, another point i was hanging a latern on a hook to look over some notes, and its awesome. I wont say anything but that because the wow factor of just the inventory tutorial is enough for me to not spoil it. 
Also, i went in expecting little of the Voice Acting, but was plesently suprised. Humor is subtle and enjoyable, and the voices dont stick out as being particularly bad or unbelievable like some games (Sarentino VR).

Finally, This is by far the most immersed ive ever been in VR, and its the first time ive ever spent more then an hour in a single play session. Again, the issue comes with the price point. I'm not sure how many episodes are planned in this series, but if they are all priced as full games thats a little shady. By the time every episode is out id be happy to pay 60 for the full collection, but its likely to price in at more like 100+. 
In conculsion, if your tight on cash buy it on sale. Nothing about the gameplay of this game is lack-luster and its how vr is ment to be played. Not these repetivive wave shooters.

It is a puzzle story game which has no action in it but the athmosphere of the game is great. Graphics are stunning and gameplay is very smooth. Soundtracks and voiceacting are also very neat. 

Achievement hunting is quite entertaining as well. 

The only thing which made me sad about this game was that I was able to finish it within 3 hours - pretty short but very well made.

I strongly recommend this game.

The graphics are amazing and the voice acting is solid and fits the characters. The atmosphere in the magnetic field to blue danube was great, it really felt like I was there.

Beautiful immersive graphics and sound.

Enjoyed the way the story is heading.
Plenty of bottles you can break lying around if at any time you're feeling frustrated.

Unfortunately, it left me quite disappointed. Mainly because after playing it, I can't even call this ""a game"". ""Demo of a game"" is more fitting.

The Gallery part 1 can be completed in less than two hours of casual play. And most of this time player will spend waiting for an NPC to finish talking and open a path forward. What's worse - those dialogues have little to no substance to them. No real story will be told until Part 2.
There are total of three puzzles in the whole ""game"", but only one of them is truely interesting and requires observing your surroundings and items in order to solve it.
Other than that, the gameplay consists of wandering around, grabbing random junk and throwing it at something in order to entertain yourself, listening to audiotapes and reading pieces of paper lying around.
On top of that, The Gallery has some performance issues. My PC is powerful enough to run moden AAA games at high framerates, yet this game, apparently, is too much. Fortunately, there are multisampling options in-game, to fix stuttering in the most un-optimized areas.

Pros:
+Nice graphics.
+Good atmosphere.
+Good music.

-Under 2 hours of casual gameplay.
-Only three puzzles in the entire game.

I completed the game in ~ 3 hours, including some time stuck on 2 of the puzzles along the way. Probably could (and will) spend another 1 ~ 2 hours knocking out some additional achievements.

For the length, full price of $20 may be a little high, but I got it at 75% off on the Winter sale, and at $5 it was worth every penny.

The story is an enjoyable mystery/adventure, and it was also mildly frightening to me, at least at first when the plot direction was still unclear.

Basically, this game (and many other VR titles I've tried so far) provides a somewhat short/simple genre offering, generally a little worse than its established counterparts, but becomes immensely more enjoyable due to the incredibly immersive VR environment, movements, etc.

If you are a ""serious"" type of gamer, have played any of the titles I mentioned above, and/or own a VR headset, you should definitely play this game and I think you will really like it. I personally can't wait for Episode 2. I was waiting for a better sale, but I'm not sure if I can help myself. May just pull the trigger and get gaming again asap...

Thank you devs for this wonderful experience!

oh and an german localisation would be nice   
so please continue the good work i want to see more :)

I did start the second episode, and it seems almost a different game. Odd. But strangely satisfying.
Still, I recommend this overall, but it does seem rushed and cobbled together at times, with some story ideas and details just dropped in favor of chasing new ones.

Pros:
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE!!! - I don't know about any of you, but I have been getting excessivly lonely in VR games lately. There just aren't many out there that have other NPCs for your character to talk to and interact with (obviously not counting enemies or monsters that are all over the place but you're just supposed to shoot at them). Games like Twisted Arrow and The Deus Helix are currently some of my favorite VR titles because there was someone talking to me over a radio the whole game and it really helped the immersion and gave me a ""friend"" so I felt like I was a part of the world and not just a visitor. Call of the Starseed took this to the next level by letting the player actually get to see the other characters and interact with them face to face.
The Graphics - They are some of the best you'll see in VR right now
The Plot - For starters, there is one and I couldn't be happier about it. Even though it's clear that this game is really just setting things up for it to really get interesting in Heart of the Emberstone it's still nice to have a story and objective to follow.
The Sequel - There are several VR games that are being released episodically. However, many of these games release their first episode and then seem to never release the promised  second even if the first one is very well recieved (looking at you Vanishing Realms). Call of the Starseed certainly waited a while for it's follow up, but it has one now and from what I've read it's pretty amazing.

Cons:
The Loading/Checkpoint Screens - There aren't a lot of these throughout the game, but there are at least five and they are seriously immersion breaking. Especially for me because other than the planes directly in front of and behind me I just have dead white space above, below, and to my sides. I really wish these chechpoint screens could be taken out and the transitions between areas could be made much more smoothly, but considering how long this game has been out I doubt that is going to happen.
The Motion Controls -  I don't know why, but I had some serious issues with the blinking thing. I had to set the location to ""point"" instead of ""look"" immeadiately because I simply could not get to where I wanted to go through the ""look"" setting. Even with the pointing, the control was glitchy in my left hand and flat out would not work in my right hand. I kind of expected a lot more polish from a game that obviously had so much work put into it.",1513483320,1513483320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game has some dark (as in light) moments that requires the use of a flashlight, and an shadowy adversary(?) that appears in the end, but further it's not a scary game and IMHO completely suitable for ages as low as 12. The game contains no scares or violence of any kind.

It was more of a curiosity driven game ranther than a plot-driven game. I had fun picking everything up and it just felt so cool using my backpack.

Graphics and setting/atmosphere are excellent. The story, is ok, in my opinion, and it is a rather short game (and yes, I know that it is episodic) for a normal pricepoint of $20. Yes, this is a VR game, and they usually are short, and was one of the originals around when the Vive came out, but asking a lot for minimal content (think of how much content you get from a game like Halo, even though it was a AAA game and sold way more, due to the exposure of such a well-known franchise...but when you total up even 4 episodes at a cost of even $20, that's $80 for a whole series, which I can't imagine would have as much content as a Halo game, which at launch are the typical $60. I know I'm also somewhat comparing apples to oranges here for game types, but I hope you get the context (content and length of play experience and story VS cost $$$). 

But yeah, I'm glad I got it, but at the price I got it...Steam sale for $5. and I feel that it is even good enough at around $10 to $15 per episode, depending on general length of each. 

Anyway, what this episode 1 lacks in overall content and length for a single episode, it makes up for in experience for VR.  It's a great way to feel the presence of the game, being in the game and interacting. I loved the section with the puzzle you had to ""gather"" and put in the vacuum tubes for voltage.  I won't say more, for anyone who hasn't played it, so they can have a bit of a cool surprise, but wow, that was something else.   

I do look forward to trying the next episode, but at a discout as well.  Again, $10 or upwards of $15 for the next episode is doable, for me (even as it's said to be longer than episode 1).  I am glad for the devs to have had such success though, as it is another title to give more longevity to the VR market, which is still a niche market, but growing and evolving steadily.  Cool stuff is here, and will continue to come around, again, due to great experiences like this one.

FULL Let's Play - http://www.htcvivegamereviews.com/all-video-list/gallery-episode-1-call-starseed-full-game-edited/

7/10

I have a fond place in my heart for The Gallery – Episode 1 : Call of the Starseed. It is one of the first VR games I played and likely the first game I completed that had any sort of length to it. I recently revisited the game to see how nostalgia holds up before I think about delving into Episode 2.

Let’s start with the goods – Visually, the game is one of the best. I love the music, especially the “bumper music” in between levels and loading screens with the dialogue. The backpack system/inventory is perfectly done and a lesson all games should consider. Puzzles are very fair and don’t involve messing around trying to figure out a “eureka moment” as much as other puzzlers, such as the escape room games. It may be potentially too easy for the parts of the game but when you get stumped – expect to chew up time trying to figure out what is next. I’m fairly sure the last puzzle consumed 80% of my playtime – EVEN when playing through again(idiot mistake second time.)

There was a lot of effort put into a narrative by the game developer and it is noticed. There is writing on walls, notes and cassette tapes that attempt to flesh out “what’s going on” besides the character you meet. In a way, this game plays more like a narrative than an actual puzzle/game but the puzzles can still make you think.

Some of the negatives/mixed perspectives – The first time I played this game – I actually felt fairly creeped out and still was motion sick but after having my “VR feet” now, I kind of wish they had a slide movement option rather than teleport. The teleport feels slightly delayed when you move compared to a lot of games I played. I felt I’d “blink” and then take a breath before the next scene loaded. It’s not nearly as bad as something like Perfect‘s movement but I am hoping in the next game it feels a little more fluid.

End of the line is – you probably won’t play this more than once unless you’re like me – re firing it up to get used to the story before possibly buying the next game installment. Knowing the puzzles definitely can decrease your playtime dramatically and choosing to ignore the narratives can cut it down to a fairly lean, short game. The visuals and music are always welcome but at a point, it’s more like watching a movie when you’ve “cracked the code”. As I write this, the game is $19.99 which you’d have to dramatically LOVE this game/genre or have multiple family members who may play through it rather than just a single playthrough. Personally for the price, I’d prefer other genres but if you’re more of a player who prefers Myst style games and narrative heavy – this might be for you.

The Good
Backpack
Music
Visuals
The Bad
Slow movement when teleporting
Limited movement options

This game has so much potential if only there were more of it. The graphics are great and you can pick up and use all kinds of things. It has an interesting story and it's one of the most immersive experiences I've had in VR. It just needs more content.

Why? 

Well, this is the play time until you reach the end of the game. That is 10 bucks (originally 20) for 90 minutes of sightseeing, therefore I can not recommend this game.

A must have for you VR library. 

As far as the negative views because of the price: please remember that these guys aren't billion dollar production companies. Yes, the original price of $30 was pretty steep but I doubt these guys are pricing it that way just to screw us over or be greedy. They spent countless hours with a small team of creators  (not a hundred of hired hands) and created something beautiful for us to enjoy. I don't think it's unreasonable to want something back for that effort (so that they can keep working on more products!). You won't find a good painting being sold for less than a $100, so why not support these artists with $30? I'm just so tired of people complaining about artist's high prices because they are comparing those prices to mass production goods. They can't compete with those prices! This is why good artists starve while we complain about ""nothing good/original coming out."" Invest in what you want to see more of. That's the only way they are going to be able to keep making good products.

The in-game user interface, the backpack system all so clever and well thought out. Everything works. It's easy to get stuck on the beach but really after you solve it you see it was pretty simple. I just love everything about this game, it is short but it is so high on quality I don't really care. I hope Valve have their eyes on these guys for HL3 VR.

Don't get me wrong. This ""experience"" was pretty neat and very well done however I just can't recommend it at the full retail price. 
The story was nice and engaging, the acting was good. The grafx were amazing. 
What shocked me was the length of the game ""or lack of"" and of course the fuse puzzle.
Everytime I tried manipulating the fuses they would fall through the panel then I'd try grabbing it and end up unplugging another one.

There is full voice acting and the actors did a fine job. None of the acting came off as cheesy or amature. The graphics are very good as well and the story thus far is certainly intriguing.

　・VRゲームとして、戦闘等ではなく体験型アドベンチャーを極める方向。これは良い方向だと思います。
　・リリース時期にしてはパフォーマンス上の工夫などが秀逸。
　　※視野の中心を緻密に描写、外周は低解像度にするなど。
　　→これにより、「観るだけ・綺麗なだけ」で有名になってしまった「theBlu」のような画質でゲーム体験ができます。

[b]「悪い点」[/b]

Just finished this episode earlier today.
Tutorial was made fun and had pleasure listening to the one teaching you the game, very energetic.

My experience with this episode -

-most objects are highly detailed while others look like poor imports from less graphical capable games, Blurry textures.
Which isnt bad, really but noticable even from far away.

-Some settings doesnt seem to do a whole lot like Anti Aliasing. Objects far away are blurred out more but most of the game is up close and personal, thus far not very useful. Maybe in future episodes..?

-The end where your hand is changed into a different model makes my HTC Vive flip out and lose synchronisation with the controllers. (right handed makes the right controller lose sync which is off putting, especially at the end)

-Characters aren't very shown too much at the start, the end guy was the most memorable cause I was able to see his face.. He was up close. While the first one after the sewers always kept distance, only close moment was him pushing the elevator button but the lighting was right behind him. It's a good character, you'd want to emphasize his looks over the ""bad"" guy at the end.

-Tapes for some people are a bit too quiet, I ended up putting my Tony Casette player to my ear too many times to properly hear what's being said, which isnt a problem for other characters that speak to you in person.
Background ambience doesnt really help either, I forgot to listen to other tapes cause I chose to listen to them away from the rain or loud sounds.

-The last puzzle gave me back aches for staring down too much. I normally don't have back aches.
Maybe I'm too tall...? (186 cm)

まずグラフィックが素晴らしい。
最初の海岸の時点でも十分綺麗でその後次々と移り変わる場面が
それぞれ全く違う雰囲気を醸し出している。
終盤は怒涛の展開に驚かされるばかりでなく
VRであることを活かしきり前後左右のみならず
上下まで利用しての演出に完全に引き込まれてしまった。

ゲーム部分は探索＋パズル。
最初の海岸だけはちょっと何をすればいいのか分かりづらいが
基本的には要所に落ちているテープのヒントで解ける。
このパズルもVRであることをうまく生かしており
楽しめるように作られている。

移動はワープであるが、ワープと同時にワープ後の
自分の向きも同時に指定できるようになっており
ぐるぐる回りすぎて体にコードが絡まる問題が対処されている。
ワープモードで視線を向けた位置に移動するシステムは
最初戸惑うがすぐに慣れることができるだろう。

ただし字幕などはなくテープやＮＰＣとの会話で話が進むため
ストーリーの理解には多少のヒアリング力が必要。
コミュニティにガイドもある(英語)ので詰まったら参照すれば
ヒアリング全くなしでもクリアするだけなら可能と思われる。

クリアまでのプレイ時間は１時間半ほど。

I'm going to answer questions I would have like to see an answer in those reviews:

Movement:
teleporting and room scale

Lenght: 
The game is quite short: i took me 1 hour completing it and exploring (second hour was my wife playing it)

Replayability:
Once you completed it once, I really do not see the point of re-doing it, as it will be exactily the same.

episode 1 it's pretty nice, game got released long time ago, but still no episode 2 :|

In terms of story:
story seems interesting and misterious, a pity we do not get to know anything longer.

Graphics are as you see in the screenshots, pretty nice.

Cons:
Short, you have a sensation of not finished :(
No episode 2 yet


If i would have to put a vote I would give it 
6.5/10

I also played a little bit with a friend of mine prior to purchasing my Vive and obtaining the game myself (like, I beat the first puzzle, that's it. x3)

This is a good game, I'll definitely say that. The story is immersive and there are a few neat little puzzles you have to pursue. The controls feel natural and I didn't have any problems with the locomotion. However, the issue with it is that it's not a long game, by any stretch of the imagination. I finished this game in one session, from the moment I opened up to the game and the tutorial loaded, to the end of the credits sequence at the end, in less than an hour and a half. It'd probably take me just a little bit longer (say, 10 minutes) if I had never opened it up before. And I wasn't trying to rush through it or anything, either.

It's definitely worth it if you're getting it as a sort of special offer (such as I did.) If, however, you don't have the option of receiving this game for free or anything of the sort, you're going to need to decide if an hour and a half's worth of immersive content is worth $20. It could definitely be considered worth the cost, and if you think it is, then by all means, snatch it up. Otherwise, I'd say wait until it goes on sale or something.

When Episode 2 comes out, I'm gonna have to think long and hard to decide if it'd be worth paying for. I mean, I wouldn't imagine it'd be much longer than Episode 1, and I'm sure it's probably gonna be around the same price, but man, the end left me with a lot more questions than I had started with.",1489377365,1489377365,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It is suprising how in depth and interactive it is. 
Most of the VR games are a 10 minute trip or arcade style. This one made you feel as though you were living an adventure
On one part (minor spoiler) it made me feel as though I had real pain in my hand.
This one is definity hard to put down. Actualy stayed up way late to finish it.
Really looking forward to the next episode.
If there was one complaint ( and this may be my fault) is that had somewhat hard of time following some of the twists of the story. More then likely I was just tired. May play the entire thing again but actually stop this time instead of just going.

Only really felt worth it because it came free with my VIVE.

A complaint I have would really be with the cutscenes, which felt awkwardly long and dragged-on. Seriously, did we have to watch [i]every[/i] little detail [spoiler]of the machine powering up?[/spoiler]

VR funktioniert perfekt, ich spiele Stundenlang ohne Motionsickness. Die Interaktion mit der Welt fühlt sich echt an und trägt dazu bei, das man sich voll auf die Rätsel konzentrieren kann. Ich hatte einen echten Endorphinrush als ich den Safe endlich auf hatte. Wer früher point&click Adventures geliebt hat kennt das Gefühl.
Der letzte Part war dann einfach nur episch, wobei jemand anderes das vieleicht eher als langweilig beschreiben würde, ich denke das ist dann Ansichtssache.

Pros:
- sehr immersive Welt
- interaktion ist sehr intuitiv und Funktioniert!
- die Rätsel sind Abwechslungs- und Einfallsreich (zugegeben, es sind nicht sehr viele).
-die Story wird interessant erzählt

Contra:
- sehr sehr kurz. ICH WILL MEHR !!
- hier und da kleinere Bugs (beim blinken mit dem Kopf in einer Wand gelandet, durch das Kanalisationsgitter geblinkt)


Im Großen und ganzen mal etwas anderes als die ganzen Horde-shooter und Techdemos die sonst geboten werden.
Aktuell das Spiel, welches in meinen Augen das Potential von VR am besten ausnutzt.

Gli enigmi sono gradevoli, non esageratamente difficili, grazie alla r.v. quello più divertente risulta l'unico in cui c'è un po' di componente fisica e meno ragionamento; ne avrei graditi di più con questa formula, per l'originalità del meccanismo rispetto ad altre avventure farebbe la differenza.

L'ho ricevuto in bundle con il Vive, non sono in grado di valutare il rapporto qualità/prezzo, tenete conto che anche facendo con calma sono un paio d'ore di gioco. Aggiungetene un'altra se volete fare tutti gli achievement, magari in una seconda partita.

The controls, using standart teleportation, are very accurrate and the game didn't loose tracking accurracy regardless of how stupidly i tried to reach something.

The first eposide is a bit too short (more like a demo) but introduces to a probably great game series and I can't wait to play further episodes.

This is what I found so I added it. So when you drop the $20 dollars to play the VR game on steam your expecting quality, as $20 is quite expensive for a VR game. And Gladly when you boot the game up that is what you get. The graphics are very good for a VR game and the graphics settings are adjustable in game. The game is loaded with cool depth of feild effects, bloom, and other various visual gags. and it also runs very smoothly. 
                  The game starts off with a tutorial, and it lasts for about 5 to 10 min and teaches you the basics of how to move around the enviroment and pick up objects. I Liked the tutorial and it had a good voice over. then it moves on to the area selection which is done by playing tapes in a tape player (The models of which have stunning detail I might add) I like the idea of playing tapes more then hitting a button. Its an unessesary detail for the game devs to include, but they did it anyways. It was creative. 
                  The game then goes on to take a semi long but pretty average loading screen. After its done loading it drops you on a drop dead gorgeous rocky beach with lots of little things to pick up and play with. Now when your wlaking on the beach there will actually be an area where there are two paths to explore one to a sewer and one farther into the beach, now the game doesnt tell you the correct path to it just allows you to explore for yourself. It does not hold your hand. eventually you go down the beach farther and it actually has a mini tutorial kind of thing to show you how to use your back pack and tools then you go up a stair case to find a workshop in the rocks with many interesting areas to explore and things to look at and throw around. However the main quest items to actually start telling the story are on the table now like I mentioned before there are actually more tapes and you have a tape player so the story is told through the tapes. You hear the character's voises but you do not actually get to see the characters until later and you only get to see two of them at that. I really enjoyed this hyping up of the characters it invests me more in the story for some reason. 
                  Anyways, you read a paper get a flare gun then it is on to the first large puzzle. the puzzle is opening the gate to the sewer, and to do the puzzle you have to shoot three bells with the flare gun. Now I didn't listen to any of the extra tapes the professor recorded so the solution to the puzzle may have been in those. But if it wasnt for youtube playthroughs, I would have had no idea to shoot the bells.  but eventually you get it then move on to the sewer.
                  Now I'm going to cut the review short here, because I don't want to spoil the rest of the game and I will be here all day if I go over the whole thing. But in the end I got around 3 hours with the first episode. Now I was hoping for more but I guess we will have to wait for the next episode right? I just hope I don't have to buy it because The game is already pretty expensive for a 3 hour game. Anyways in short the VR implementation was excellent, the puzzles were well thought out and difficult but not too difficult, and the story has me hooked and kind of ends on a cliff hanger. Can't wait to play more! and I give it a 9.2/10 (Played on HTC Vive)",1484273731,1484274366,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False,False,,,

And this one is a hard one to judge, as its not really a bad game.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

+ on a technical side the game is fantastic, great physics and overall VR mechanics
+ not only can you teleport, but reorientate your playspace, by rotating it while blinking, very intuitive
+ graphics look nice
+ one of the best inventory systems in a VR game today, you get out your backpack from your back and place it, to then put stuff in or take something out, very cool

+ after the game was finished I kinda wanted more

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- its very very short, you will get through it in 1,5 hours
- at the end of the game there is a puzzle that is insanely difficult and really needs a guide to be solved
- the whole game is basically a demo for the Vive and VR mechanics, this is the stuff that should be free or at least very cheap

- the price tagg is insane compared to the numerous better games that are out there and ultimatley made me decide to thumb it down. Its hard to believe that this 1,5 hour game not only costs a lot more than other very replayable games, but they are also going for an episodic system, which is downright greedy.

- no replayablility whatsoever

Can throw starfish.

☺Pros
- Can throw starfish.
- Putting a conch shell up to your ear plays the sound of the ocean. Sweet one guys <3
- The first storyline-oriented VR game i've played, and it's beautiful.
- Scenery is of amazing quality and maps feel real.
- Puzzle mechanics are fun, requires you to use your brain rather than faceplant the keyboard to complete the game.

☹Cons
- At times it was hard to figure out what to do, or where to go. (This can be put down to me, so not really a con)
- Not enough starfish.

The mysterious narrative and gloomy setting of the first chapter was an instant hook and I remained engaged throughout the story. The game is predominently a puzzle-based adventure where atmosphere and story take centre stage. The puzzles were well thought out and challenging, though I felt that the '3Bs on the B' puzzle was a little too tricky to be the first challenge of the game. The soundtrack is outstanding and the high graphical fidelity really shows off the potential of the Vive hardware.

Pros:
 + Great atmosphere/writing
 + Great voice acting
 + Geniuinly puzzling puzzles!
 + Great professional graphics
 + Story rich with great immersion

Cons:
 - Not really a fan of the episodic formula
 - The backpack system is a little faulty, you can't have two items from your backpack in each hand because you still need to put the backpack on your back. 
 - [spoiler]On the final part of the game, when you are moving down the elevator and twisting and turning in different directions to the starseed. It is REALLY nausiating, i had to cover my eyes because I was ready to throw up. This only lasted for a very short bit, however.[/spoiler]

Wow! This is a lot of fun. I have made it to the third level so far, and I will definitely continue playing.

The good:
1. Very creative storytelling
2. Good writing and great voice acting
3. Puzzles. Not extremely challenging -- you won't feel like a real genius -- but they're fun and fitting.
4. Good graphics; Runs smooth on my i4790K and 980 GTX (no overclock); Even upped the game's HMD multiplier to 1.5 (I think it says 15 in game)
5. Lots of environmental interaction fun.
6. The best ""blink"" transportation systems I've seen in a VR game so far. It allows you to rotate your direction while blinking and helps you align your placespace with the world space. This takes a lot of the frustration of spinning too much out of games where you have 360 degrees to play with.
7. The inventory system is great.

The bad:
1. Sometimes blink is disabled. Stupid complaint, since it's to avoid game-breaking movements (I assume), but I dislike being told I can't do something especially in a disruptive way. I'd prefer the game world make it clear that I physically don't have a movement option instead of seeing a ""blink disabled"" message.
2. Some of the items in the world react very strongly to seemingly small touches. None of this breaks the game, only a bit of immersion. Weighted items in VR must be difficult because I see so many heavy looking models (think a large telescope -- no spoiler, this is just an example) that you reach out to touch and it goes flying across the room or falls down like it's superlight cardboard.
3. Minor bugs like certain items sometimes float above a surface (feet, not inches)

The ugly:
1. Yer ma

I beat the game in just under an hour and a half, but there's no replay value to justify the price. I understand that this is only episode 1, I don't know if episode 2 comes for free if you purchased ep.1 (if that's the case then get the game).

Now the price aside, the game is fun. Graphics are beautiful and life like. The UI is simple and actually pretty neat, probably the best inventory managment I've seen in a VR game. The story is interesting and gets REALLY crazy/cool/interesting at the end, so much that I eagerly look forward to episode 2. 

So you can be the judge, it's price vs. content for me. I'm giving it a thumbs up because it's an excellent example of what we can expect for first person narrative VR titles, but if you don't have a pile of cash you can blow away I highly suggest waiting for the game to go on sell and instead invest your $30 on a title that has a higher replay value.

pros:

- controls are intuitive
- wtf ending makes you want more
- decent story ...

cons:
- ... that you have to look for (think bioshock 1 audiologs)
- the rest of the sound isnt dimmed when listening to a tape
- short (about 90 minutes)
- sometimes the collision detection (for the floor) gets confused and you bounce up and down
- price (although its fair to say, that the vr market is very small today and almost all games are still a lot more expensive compared to non vr games)

if you are looking for a game thats more than just point and shoot or a reflex test this game is well worth a look.

With that said, for an episode - it's short. Like, last night I started out just before midnight and got to bed after beating it by 01:30. And I didn't rush I can tell you that. In a replay I'd do it in like 30 minutes. 

Some game mechanics needs a little work if I'm gonna state my opinion. Movement isn't that easy to grasp in the beginning. You gotta give it like half an hour before you can really get your head around how to keep your IRL north true to game north. There was like 20 times I had to check outside my Vive just to see where the heck I was facing.

Also, when getting many items to juggle with, the backpack and hands gets to work alot. And when using flashlights and listening to tapes and stuff, your hands get crowded, and it feels kind of awkward. 

If you, like me, got it for free - by all means try it. 
If you want to buy it, and have played alot, you might be disappointed in one way or another.",1481044464,1481044464,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Beware that if the ground is uneven and you turn, the camera has the tendency to move either up or down as it's trying to change your vertical position in the world (it seems). Quickly induces nausea. 

The story is very interesting...but I wish the game had gone farther. I messed around with stuff and still got it done in 1.5 hours. If it hadn't come for free with the Vive, I'd be pretty pissed. I understand this stuff is hard to develop for, but come on! $20 per game, they say 4 episodes total...that'd be $80 for what amounts to a full game!

Will I buy episode 2? Maybe...but episode 1 ending left me with more questions than I've had since Lost aired on NBC.

A lot of the reviews are saying the story is great, but considering the game is 90 mins and you barely do much I don’t see much story at all. The few characters you meet aren’t that exciting, and at best it leaves off way too open ended. Maybe if all the episodes come out at once in a decent bundle price it’d be worth considering, but for now I can’t recommend it.

I call this a demo. I played longer demos in the past.

I got this for free with my vive, but i was left kind of disappointed. There are some really great mechanics (like the inventory management), but, while playing, I often felt like the experience was ""stretched"". VR is a new media and I was unsure if that was the case, but as the game ended quickly, I'm now pretty sure it was intentional.
As an example, the tutorial felt way longer than needed. Ok, I did play other experiences before, but then again there's no need for me to smash every single botte. The Lab just tells you how to teleport and grab stuff and you are done. Felt like they really wanted me to be ready before jumping into action, so I did take my time to ensure I was ready. Except, there is no action at all in the whole game so you have plenty of time to practice later in a non-time-critical environment. There are many more examples but I will just stop here to avoid spoilers.

I really cannot suggest this to anyone at this price. A few really easy puzzles, lots of teleporting, a huge deal of standing still and listening (good voice acting, though). I really took my time looking around, checked pretty much everything out, played a lot with useless objects (example I spent a good 15 minutes playing with an hammer inside the magnetic field), and still did a full run in under 2 hours.

I may be interested in the next episode, but I'll wait for other people's reviews, and no way I'd spend 20 € for an experience like this.

The world is pretty detailed and allows interaction with enough things to make it fun to just stay and play around for a while at certain spots.

The story is interesting and it unfolds in a good way, giving enough hints to let you move along at a good pace but still leaves some things to figure out by yourself.

Pros:
* Runs decently on the Vive
* Looks and sounds great, and has decent immersion
* The bag interface is novel, and the tapes for saving are a good innovation
* The voice work is very professional

Cons:
* For the price of USD$19.99 it is too short at ~2 hours.
* The writing is really nothing special. It actually kinda bugged me. It would have been utterly tedious if the voice work wasn't so good
* I can remember about 4 actual puzzles. The rest were find-thing, use-thing-with-thing

The graphics are very nice and the immersion is definitely there. I esspecially liked the fuse puzzle whch is saying something since I don't go for puzzle games normally.

I am still sceptical, however, since the original price was (I believe) around $30. I will not be paying $30 per episode to complete this journey.

This really is something special.

Long story:

I bought this game when it first came out, and had to refund it as it was stuttering like crazy no matter what I did. I left a negative review. I just bought it again now that the price has been lowered. I am blown away.

This is AAA. It starts of rather slow, and seems very cute but nothing to fancy. But by the time this game gets going, there are some trully stunning areas to explore and all running super smooth on my system, enabling some real presence. The issue is, by the time my jaw was hitting the floor, it was over!

I can understand the reason this got some negative reviews however. Even though the last puzzle made me think and I found it very fun, it was basically one of only two puzzles in the entire game. It is also very short... but the quality more than makes up for it in my eyes... this is AAA quality in a bite size package.

Anyway, easily the best game on Vive yet, and it was one of the first. I can't wait to see this slowly become a full game via the future chapters, and will be gladly investing in Cloudheads future work.",1476822010,1476901715,True,3,0,0.476915091276168823,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Additionally, this game on the HTC Vive is one of the first to make me forget that I was in fact standing in my little bedroom with wonky googles on.

I don't have many complaints. Normally I dislike teleport mechanics in VR games, but it serves this game well, honestly. I encountered one bug total (an elevator left without me), but it self-repaired.

Otherwise, skip it.

The Gallery: Call of the Starseed isn't really a bad ""experience"", but it's very short and somewhat rudimentary. The main problem is that, just as things are starting to ramp up, the experience is over. The first setting of the game, the beach, has more mini-distractions than the rest of the game put together, which is almost a beeline if you don't count a small maze as a distraction.

The default method of movement is holding down the left track pad and aiming with your vision. Do yourself a favor and switch this to where your pointing with your hand. It's less of a pain in the neck, more accurate, and faster overall. Like many Vive games, Starseed uses a teleportation mechanic, which is fine, but they have an extra ""orientation"" feature which never really felt intuitive to anyone I showed it to.

The ""grab"" of the hands is somewhat cumbersome and you'll pick up things you don't mean to if they are near something else, including picking the section of gameplay you want to start from the title menu/desk thing. It seems like it needs to be tightend up a bit.

There aren't many characters in the game, but neither are animated in a compelling way. What's most compelling is the scale in VR- the characters are a little flat in facial expressions to be honest. One character talks almost nonstop and, for some reason, doesn't have any sort of animation for speaking. It kind of kicks immersion in the teeth.

Otherwise, I like the locals, and the fidelity of the locations is very nice. The sounds aren't bad, but not really a whole lot going on. The puzzles are sort of short and simple, nothing that will keep an intelligent person with some coordination busy for too long.

This game's price recently dropped down to $19.99, but honestly this game could be completed in one sitting at a friend's house. I'm interested in upcoming episodes, but they'd need either a lot more content, a lot more ""gameplay"", or a reduced pricepoint, as $19.99 for this isn't cutting it for me. I could see $9.99, tops, but it's just so short and simple, and the only replay value is completing achievements (most of which are very easy and are done on the first level).

While I would say it's a very worth Vive experience to showcase what it can do, from a buyer's standpoint: consider something with more depth or more replayability unless this game is discounted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I actually really enjoyed my experience on Call of the Starseed.

The ending sequence is quite long winded and story driven (which is fine) but is largely the player doing nothing while stuff (cool stuff!) unfolds around them.

If the developers shed some light on whether or not a purchase of this episode provides further episodes for free, then I might be able to recommend it - especially if they said how many episodes there will be. 

I want to point out, again, that this game was actually very fun and the world was really well crafted and immersive. The inventory was really cool and quite fun to interact with. There's lots of fluff in their game world if you're into it too. The final puzzle in the game is really interesting and brain testing too.

It just comes down to how much you're spending and how long you're getting in the game. There seems to be little reason to want to replay the game - no choices or consequences etc. - so £22.99 for <2 hours of gameplay just isn't viable at the moment. 

On sale or as a free game it is absolutely worth it - and if you got maybe 3/4 further episodes in the series with your purchase of this one at £22.99 (assuming similar lengths) it would absolutely be worth it because then we can assume it's around 10 hours for £22.99 which becomes a bit more worth it on the VR market.

Unfortunately though, negative review until the price is slashed a bit or there is some light shed on further content and how the pricing will work.

I look forward to episode two.",1475713166,1476396597,True,1,0,0,2,False,True,False,False,,,

Great use of scale and lighting.

The story is just getting started so I don't know whether it'll be a selling point, but it's a good hook so far imo.

The inventory and locomotion systems take just a short while to get used to and then are pretty good. Stowing items over your shoulder and retrieving them from the backpack handles the large inventory cleanly and is more immersive than a menu.

It's cheap and offered hours of puzzles in the same mysterious ""bigger forces are at work here"" way.

This game is amazing. While it's pretty short, it's (one of) the most polished games on the VIVE right now and has AAA quality. It's made with love, you can see and feel it everywhere. 
The details are awesome, grab a shell and just listen - very nice and there are many more details. The level parts are unique but restricted, you can't explore much which is a bit sad, I hope the following episodes will make it even better. Therefor there are many interactable objects, a mix of both would be ideal.
The voice output and animations of the AI and environment are smooth, clear and well made. 
I really like the inventory system, thus the backpack, but it could need some improvements, e.g. take off/on the backpack with the grip buttons, so you can hold one item in each hand at the same time, like flashlight and map.

This is a must have for the VIVE, very smart to put it into the new bundle, so every new VIVER can experience this masterpiece. I can't wait and I'm really looking forward to the new episodes!

They require that you look for things which enhances the roomscale experience of walking around, yet arent overly simple that you solve them immediately.

Wow!  This goes way beyond just a VR experience.  It whisks you a million miles from your living room and drops you knees deep in muck, with a flashlight, a map and a creepy feeling that you should've gotten a tentanus shot before coming up in here.  There's familiar game mechanics like papers lying about, junk on shelves, notes tacked to the walls.  They all feel VERY different when you get to root thru a life sized cabinet in order to inspect it all.  This will really ruin a lot of my fav games for me - but at the same time I have that old feeling from being a kid when games like Quake and Doom first came out and we all thought ""Man - gaming is about to change forever, and right here soon"".  Revolution is coming.  Can't wait to play the next episode.

BTW, more than the puzzles or the story or the environments ... the one thing I appreciate the most is the inventory system.  Extremely well done!  If you grip your hand near your shoulder and pull, you will slip off your backpack which can then be parked mid-air anywhere you like (think Deadspace).  A touch of a finger will summon whatever you want from in there - a tape recorder, a flip lighter, some scrap parts or a map.

- Nada mas abrir la verja el audio de los personajes desapareció pero se escuchaba el ruido ambiental.
- Al entrar en el ultimo ""Ascensor"" no me transporte al centro de él y se quedó parado en el descenso.

While the story is engaging, abiet extremely ambigous, it did give me goose bumps, but there was little interactivity when I did get to those points.

I really wasn't disappointed.

If this were a normal, 2D FPS-type exploration adventure, you'd whizz through it in about 45 mins. Because you're immersed, however, you take so much more time to observe and enjoy your surroundings. The world is lovingly made and there are lots of details you'd skip without the abillity to pick things up and look at them from all angles.

At one point, I had the entirely open choice of using my flashlight, a lantern or a candle. I decided to pick up the candle because I enjoyed moving it around and seeing how it realistically affected shadows. This feature isn't groundbreaking in terms of what game engines can do - but when you're *in*it, it's delightful. Shortly afterward, in my other hand, I picked up a note. As I tried to read it, the ambient light was a little muted, so I moved my candle closer. I had just started to read it when the page blackened and set on fire. 

The few puzzles you solve are satisfying, and the final big puzzle experience is mesmerising, and done so well. Nothing particularly mentally taxing, but because you're moving things around with your hands it just *feels* more awesome.

Other, random highlights:
 - Moving things that emit sound closer to your ear to hear them better (hint: try the seashells)
 - Trying to juggle with beer bottles in the tutorial
 - The beach.
 - Being able to rotate your playspace to fit each little nook and cranny you want to explore. It meant I could figure the best fit and not have to teleport to enjoy all the details a particular room/spot was hiding.

If this were a 2D game, you'd be upset to pay over £20 for it. Because it's VR, it's totally worth it. I felt like I was the silent protagonist of a feature length episode of a new JJ Abrams/Damon Lindelof collaboration. I'm really looking forward to Episode 2, and am *really* pleased this will now be bundled with the Vive as I think it's a fantastic intro to what storytelling in a VR experience can be.",1471175735,1471175735,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The story and characters are interesting and the world is very immersive. I'm not going into details, but I do recommend this game... but maybe you shouldn't buy it yet.
You're basically going to pay 30 €/$ for about 1-2 hours of content. The big question is: How much does it cost you to play the other episodes after buying the first one? Hopefully not a lot, as the cost of this first episode is already pretty high. Waiting is propably the best option, unless you really want to experience it now. I don't regret buying the game at this point. Just be aware of the possibility of sky high pricing. It propably won't be like that, but who knows.

One of the best VR experiences so far.

The graphics, environment and storyline is better than any Vive games out there right now. 

Pros:
-great environment that changes from one area to the next
-really challenges what VR is meant to be, ie the way the game interacts with the player, the VR-3D aspect, the cinematic experience. 
-very neat backpack interface
-great graphics. Although I think the graphics can be a lot better but it is hindered by the early development limitation of the Vive. 
-great sound effects and voice acting.

Cons:
-expensive for only 1 episode. Reading the discussions around this topic, it sounds like the initial price may be necessary for the development of the game. Though I am definitely looking for later episodes to be more price reasonable.
-gameplay is only 2 hours with very little replay value. This kind of amplifies the first con point.
-due to the game only being 2 hours, there's very little that the player can get out of the storyline. I think the storyline definitely had a good start but just isn't enough since the play time is so short.

Sugguestion:
-playing some of the other Vr games, some other VR games actually automatically rotates the virtual game so that you aren't against the wall all the time. For example, moving into the next scene through a load screen, the game would reposition the player so that in the next area moving forward in the game will direct the player to walk away from the real world wall rather than walking close to the wall. In some scenes in Starseed, I am stuck next to the real wall a lot of times and the virtual wall outline would display removing some immersion.

Looking forward to the next episode but perhaps more in the $15 price point and long play time. The 3 cons mentioned really goes hand in hand and amplifies each other.",1470610905,1470611100,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The story is really cool, the characters are cool and got me invested and immersed, and the puzzles are simple and grounded which felt very real. The icing on first episode of The Gallery is the ending. I don’t want to spoil it, but the potential of what Episode 2 could have for us is shown at the end of Episode 1 and it has made Ep. 2 one of my most anticipated VR games, even though it hasn’t seen a teaser trailer.

Despite having quite a few visual wows and a well realised inventory system I couldn't recommend it as I just didn't find it fulfilling.

The first puzzle in particular is an unintuitive mess. [spoiler] I spent about half an hour trying to work out a morse code puzzle that didn't exist [/spoiler]. The sewer puzzle isn't really a puzzle [spoiler] You can only go the wrong way by going to the well which lead me to think i would have to put items in the well to get stuff out of the sewer [/spoiler].
Finally in the third and fourth sections the puzzles got more interesting. But after that it was time to sit back and enjoy the ride. 
In general the whole thing felt like the episode once had a lot more content which was cut but the hints of more interesting things were left in. There was never once a point where I got to use knowledge i had learned earlier. There was never a sense of mastery. So what was left was a game that felt like a theme park ride where you get shuffled from one scene to another.
Unfortunately the story doesn't quite make up for the lackluster gameplay. [spoilter] The monolog near the end is painfully long whilst you literally do nothing for 10 minutes with very little happening on screen for most of it[/spoiler].

In general its the gameplay that really needs a step up here. VR adds a 3D spectacle but this game could have been made without it and without it the game would be utterly forgettable.

The controls are well realised and the rotating teleportation works well.  My hope for the developers going forward is now that they have the basics down they really need to double down the gameplay and puzzles for the next episodes.",1470429374,1470429374,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In terms of gameplay and content, [b]this is exactly the experience the Vive was made for[/b].

Curiosity is encouraged and rewarded, and the player will make use of the full range of her play space, vertical as well as horizontal.

The only thing that makes me hesitate to recommend this title is the conjunction of its length and price.

It's short, depending on how much you'll explore in the game you could probably get 2+ hours out of the game. The puzzles, especially the one with the fuses, are (borderline) tedious but easy enough to not occupy you for too long.

The reasong I'm not recommending it is how it's being sold. Even at a sale I'd say it's a no go. €15-19 (tops!) at full price would be fine. At the moment this isn't even a season pass-type deal but just episode one, if you'd get all future episodes included in the price it would be acceptable, but as it stands now I can assume future episodes will be priced the same as episode one. I really hope though that future episodes will be heavily discounted for owners of episode one.

*PROS*
-Phenomenal story.
-Excellent graphics.
-Complete immersion (this is the only VR game where I've actually bumped into my wall a couple times reaching for things. it's also the first VR game where I kept stepping prematurely, expecting to be able to walk down a path before remembering it didn't actually exist).
-Intuitive, natural controls.
-Getting a glimpse at the future of VR.
-Spooky and emotive locales, but thankfully no horror.


*CONS*
-It starts with a ""look"" form of the blink teleport mechanic. Hit the menu button and you can change it to the standard ""point"" blink teleport found in most vr games.


*Other Stuff*
The primary game themes are: exploration, investigation, discovery, and mystery.

The primary game mechanics involve walking about, collecting and using items, investigating, and some puzzle solving (but thankfully not too much) as you slowly unravel the plot.

The price is not a pro or con. You get what you pay for. This is a better experience than people who wait for an hour in line at Disney World get to see (and those experiences only last 5-10 minutes!). 

The devs are planning 4 episodes and they can't get finished soon enough as far as I'm concerned. This is probably the best VR experience on Steam at this time. If you've got the cash, it's a no-brainer.",1470019473,1470019859,True,2,1,0.483484029769897461,0,True,False,False,False,,,

With that in mind I hovered over The Gallery a number of times, wanting to play it but not sure if the reported short play time meant I would get my money’s worth as at the time of purchase this is up there as one of the more expensive titles out for VR. Well, having caved in and bought the game and completed it in the same night, I can now confirm that it was totally worth it! 

I like pretty much everything about this game, when it starts you don’t really know what is going on and it doesn’t seem like much is happening. Though as the game progresses the puzzles and interaction gets better and better – it’s like it starts off simple to allow you to get used to the VR controls and then ups the puzzles once you are ready for it. Experiencing this 1st person is amazing too, it makes the puzzles more real and fun. There are number of really cool mechanics in the game too, like the backpack, which sounds simple, but I found I had a grin on my face while using it every time, it’s just really cool. So without diving in to spoilers, if you like point and click adventure games, I would recommend this game.

There were a couple of bugs and bits that could be better, however, they did not massively detract from the experience and the devs are still updating this game. As it happens, one of my main gripes with the game (the backpack didn’t always put away) was fixed about a day after I played it and now works fine. This commitment makes me excited to get Ep 2 when it comes out.

As a side note, this is the first VR game I have ever got completely turned around in. When I took a break I thought I was going to be facing my TV, but no, I was about 120 degrees wrong. Total immersion.

Über das Spiel:
The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed ist ein Adventure Spiel welches aus der Ego Perspektive gespielt wird.
Für mich als alter Adventure Fan, welcher mit Spielen wie Myst,ManiacMansion oder Day of the Tentacle gross geworden bin, war diese VR Erfahrung zwar neu aber absolut passend. In Ego Perspektive mit VR ein Spiel zu Spielen macht absolut Sinn. Es zwingt sich fast schon auf, dieses Genre auf die VR zu bringen, weil es sich einfach so natürlich und richtig anfühlt.

The Gallery ist ein Adventure und macht hier fast alles richtig.
Es ist eine gute Story, welche einen dazu bring das Spiel (Teil 1 ) bis zum Ende,  mit viel Elan durchzuspielen.

Grafik:
Die Grafik ist im Verhätniss zu anderen VR Spielen welche ich bis zum heutigen Tag gespielt habe,
überdurchschnittlich gut. 
Die Kantenglättung welche gut funktioniert trägt einen sehr grossen Teil dazu bei.
Die Levels sind sehr sorgfältig gestaltet und laden dazu ein gerne mal einen augenblick stehen zu bleiben um das Level zu bewundern.
Auf dem höchten Grafiklevel kommt meine GTX1080 an ihre Grenzen. Allerdings sehe ich auch bei etwas reduzierter Grafik keinerlei Unterschied.
Die Texturen sind leider nicht so hoch aufgelöst wie man es z.B aus ""The LAB"" kennt. Sie sind nicht schlecht könnten aber gene noch besser werden.
Die Engine funktioniert sehr gut  und lässt viel Freiraum für tolle Funktionen welche im Spiel sehr gut umgesetzt wurden.
Das macht das Spiel Abwechslungsreich.

Steuerung:
Die Steuerung funktioniert in meinem Fall mit den HTC Controllern sehr gut. 
In Adventure Spielen trägt man gerne mal so einiges an Material zusammen, welches man mitnehmen muss oder sollte.
Das Inventar wurde super gelöst. Man greift hinter sich und zieht einen Rucksack hervor in dem man so einiges hineinpacken kann. Auch das auswählen der Gegenstände zu deren Verwendung wurde sehr gut umgesetzt in dem man das gewünschte Teil aus dem Rucksack herrauszieht.
Riesen Pluspunk- Sehr innovativ!
Steckt man seinen Kopf in eine Richtung in die man nicht sollte. -Etwa durch eine Wand-
Wird dieses Verhalten durch eine unscharfe Sicht verhindert. Zudem wird man nach einigen wenigen Sekunden vom System wieder in eine Korrekte Position gebracht. - Clever
Grundsätzlich kann man sich im gegebenen Bereich frei bewegen und ""beamt sich dann zum nächten gewünschten Ort.
Ganz genau wie bei Myst, nur um einiges flexibler.

Sound:
Der Sound (Stimmen) wurde Professionell aufgenommen und lassen einen so richtig in das Spiel Eintauchen.
Gänsehaut garantiert.

Spielspass:
Der Spielspass ist auf jeden Fall gegeben. Es ist KEINE Tech Demo welches hier als Spiel angeboten wird.
Es ist ein Storybasiertes Adventure Spiel welches das Adventure Fan Herz höher schlagen lässt.
Eine ""kleine"" Perle.
Ich für meinen Teil hatte sehr viel Spass mit dem erten Teil des Spiels.

Fazit:

Pro:
Grosser Spielspass und Spannung
Tolle Story
Sehr schöne Grafik
Gute Steuerung
Sehr innovatives Gameplay und Inventar



Kontra:
Die wenigen Speicherpunkte können einen schon nerven. Gespeichert wird nach jedem Abschnitt automatisch. Schafft man einen Abschnitt nicht an einem Stück, fängt man diesen von vorne an, Ich hatte gefühlte 5 Speicherpunkte. Das nervt.

Ein so Professionell aufgebautes Spiel sollte gerne auch mit weiteren Sprachen untertittelt werden oder gerne zu diesem Preis auch synchronisiert sein.
Sprachmuffel wie ich schaffen es aber trotzdem das Spiel durchzuspielen ;-)

Für jeden Adventure Fan oder diese die es noch werden wollen- EIN MUSS, sofern einen der Preis nicht abschreckt.
Der momentane Preis ohne Rabatt beträgt fast 25.-
Ich hatte mir viel Zeit beim Spielen gelassen und brauchte 5 Stunden bis zum Ende.
Das Spiel kann aber locker in 2 Stunden durchgespielt werden.

Ich würde jederzeit wieder das Geld für den ersten Teil bezahlen, beim nächten Teil dürfte aber gerne etwas mehr Spielzeit dafür drin liegen.",1469998485,1478188764,True,11,0,0.675796031951904297,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]游戏性[/h1]
本作是典型的第一人称冒险解谜游戏，正常走走停停的节奏通关时间大概需要2个半小时到3小时左右，节奏稍快一点的话大概2小时左右通关，谜题难度总体并不算难，最后那道谜题可能需要多耗一些时间[spoiler] （耗时也仅仅是因为用排除法过关，其实并不难）	[/spoiler]，建议玩家英语在四级以上水平，这样能看懂最基本的文字提示，英文更好一些的玩家能理解更多的语音对话[spoiler]（多数剧情内容都需要听磁带获取，但这并不会影响解谜进度）[/spoiler]，对剧情的深刻理解大有帮助，如果完全不懂英文其实也可以玩，但剧情方面无法理解是遗憾。
[h1]画面[/h1]
游戏画质分3挡可调，我设置为最高画质，整体表现在目前的VR游戏中算是非常好的，建模还是很逼真的，HUD清晰度也可调整，建议设为最高值20。
[h1]音效[/h1]
音效方面得重点表扬一下，可以用顶级制作电影音效标准来衡量这部作品，在石地、木头、水里可以听到不同的声音，开头部分海鸥盘旋的叫声一直回响在耳边，山洞里也能听到回声，拿在手里的录音机环绕音效也不错，并且这只是用VIVE自带的耳塞听出的音效，如果换上大馒头耳机效果还会更好。
[h1]交互性[/h1]
游戏内大多数谜题都是通过交互性解决，移动是通过一种叫Blink的方式，按住触控板后根据头盔视线所在位置瞬移，背包设计体验感非常棒，开头处有一个场景专门针对交互性设计，可以体验的物品有好几种，具体我就不剧透了。
[h1]缺点[/h1]
虽然结局还算比较过瘾，但总体流程略短，还不是特别尽兴，这也算是目前VR单机游戏的通病，相对于其它同类型作品来讲画廊算流程长的了，期待下一章。

I've been a VR enthusiast for about two years; ever since I landed an early number DK2. In those two years I tried just about everything on the old Oculus Share and I've bought pretty much any title on Steam VR and Oculus home with a reasonable rating. In all that time, nothing has made my jaw hit the floor like The Gallery.

If you have a Vive do yourself a favor and pick this title up ASAP. And please, don't give up if you get stuck on the beach puzzles. The parts of the game that really shine are the ones that come after you trudge through the sewer.


[b]Pros:[/b]

[list]
    [*]Most breathtaking VR experience I've had. Period.
    [*]Lots of effort put into making most objects interactive
    [*]Very novel backpack inventory management system
[/list]


[b]Cons:[/b]

[list]
    [*]Very short (around 2 - 2.5 hours)
    [*]A bit pricey for the duration
    [*]As others have pointed out, the solutions to some puzzles are not exactly clear. There are hints scattered around, but the world is very detailed so they're easy to miss. It is extremely rare for me to me use any hint or guides but I did need to in order to complete the episode.

I kickstarted this one way back in the days of Oculus DK1.  
It's nothing like the game that was originally promised I don't think, a lot of the stuff is missing, no full torso shadow etc etc
But - it's a good play.
It's very short, took me 2 hours, and I was spending a lot of time looking around and being silly.
The Blink system is clunky, the hands could do with some arms, the puzzles are way too easy.
But - it tells a story, at least the start of one, and creates an atmosphere well.

There's massive, massive room for improvement, but it's a decent start.
At full price I have to say it's overpriced, but it's fun and if it appears in a sale - buy it.
Because - The end sequence is fantastic.  Gives you a real ""Wow, THIS is what VR can do that no other medium can do"" feeling.  You feel part of something magical, and leaves you gagging for the next part.

The further you get through this first part, the more it feels as though the developers have found their feet, so you have to hope that the next episode is gonna be REALLY special.

Mechanically, it speaks the ""language"" of VR very well. Movement and interaction with the world is natural, and the inventory system using a backpack which you ""pull"" from your back when you want to access the inventory is neat. 

It's not perfect (nothing is). Graphics demands are high, with some juddering on my 6600k/Radeon 480 system, which mostly cleared up when I turned the settings down to low. There are some nausea issues with parts of the terrain where your elevation can change while you're walking in room scale, which can cause discomfort. The puzzles are a little simplistic, and the episode itself is not very long.

Graphics were fine, not quite at 'The Lab' level but better than some other VR experiences.

I've had a vive for about a month now, and just like anything else, there's a honeymoon period. Everything is awesome and new, and then after a while, the luster wears off and you see it for what it is--groundbreaking and enjoyable, but not perfect.

This game brought me right back to that first moment of amazement and showed me just a taste of what VR is really capable of. Literally standing, head tilted back, jaw on the floor incredible.

Sadly it doesn't, and you are left feeling a bit shocked at how quickly you played through the game considering its asking price. As a game starseed is great, but sadly I don't think I'd recommend it (even at the as of writing this steam summer sale discounted price). 

If the price included upcomming episodes then I would have recommended it, but right now I'd probably recomend that you wait and see if you can pick it all up later in a bundle after more episodes are released - that way you'll get more value for your money and more content to enjoy at the same time. So for now this is a wait and buy later in my oppinion. 

PS. It hurts me to give this recommendation because the game itself is really fun and you can see the devs put a lot of love into it.

As a story-based game, there isn't much (any) replayability, although VR in general is starving for more story and less arcade.

There is very little to do beside walking (=teleporting), and the puzzles are really uneven. The first one is actually pretty hard to figure out as you have no idea what to look for.
I enjoyed the final one with the capacitors but that was about it.

The final sequence (that everyone is raving about) does have a nice 'Encounters of the Third Kind' feeling about it, but the dialog is pretty meaningless and doesn't fit the preceding events. It's plain inexplicable. Also, the sequence itself is more of a visual effort than a story or event. It doesn't make much sense.

The game mechanics are generally okay, although there are some glitches (I had to solve the final puzzle with e flare shell stuck to my left hand). Voice acting is great (especially the sister on the tapes) and sounds are also spot on.

If you're considering buying it, do so for the ambience and visuals, not a great adventure game. It's more of a taste/showcase of what adventure games will be like in VR.

This game is by far the closest to fulfilling my VR dreams. While other great games offer fun short experiences that you can repeat but get boring. The Gallery offers a true immersive story driven experience. They game features some of the best locomotion of any VR game to date (take note Loading Human!), and some of the best environments VR has to offer. Some cool puzzles and wonderful audio design.

So I finished the episode 1 a few minutes ago and I had to update this review.

I do still think it's price point is high for the hours spent playing but Graphically and story wise it's AMAZING! where you end up is SO different than where you start. And it sets up the next episode so well. I CAN NOT WAIT to play the next one.  
Yes I still have some issues with the way you ""blink"" as well, but none of these issues are dealbreakers. People need to stop saying there are no VR games to play because I'm sure they haven't tried this.  If you own a VIVE this is a NO BRAINER. I'm going to play it again for the acheievements. It's that good!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the most part I think this is a great VR experience. It's one of the few I've played that really feel like a full fledged game not just a tech demo. I also like that, unlike most other VR games, you do get options to turn up the graphics performance.  

2 Things I don't like

1: controls. They just don't work for me AT ALL. 
Either you look where you're teleporting or point to your teleport location (options for both in settings). Unfortunatly neither is a very good solution. To make matters worse they want you to rotate the touchpad to the direction you want to move to While having the pad pressed down.. When you release it teleports you to the location and direction you chose.  Not sure if they have a different Vive than I do but that just DOESN'T WORK.  I really want to keep exploring this world but I spend 70% of the time trying to face the right direction.  

Devs if you're reading this: Please allow for a toggling option. So you press the pad down and release once to get into ""blink mode"" then you can move your head or pointer to get to where you want to go. You can also slide your thumb in the direction you want to stand. Then press the touch pad down and release again to blink. 
I know it sounds cumbersome but I'm sure it would become second nature in a matter of minutes and you'd be fine. Also thats a better solution than what we have now. You can't keep the pad pressed down while also moving in the direction you want to go. I'm surprised this game has been out this long with no up date to that. 

2. The price. LIke I said at the top of this review the game is great. Looks great; shows alot of promise.  And I totally get that this is a new meduim so Devs taking real risks and making real games ( instead of the basic experience we're seeing in VR today) should be rewarded.  But that same arguement works the other way.  This is new: if you want it to grow the installbase you shouldn't make episode 1 cost $30. Even if its a full experience, the title suggests you'll be buying more than just 2 episodes. Thats too expensive for something thats  still far from mainstream. Those prices will keep people from jumping in. 

I think they're afraid there's not enough of an install base yet so early adopters are supplementing the price to keep them working on it maybe? 
It's not a deal breaker though because I've seen far less quality VR games demand more money. I just wish they made it just a bit cheaper since we're talking episodes. 

But I totally dig it. People should definitely sheck it out.",1466571661,1467172965,True,2,0,0.491183876991271973,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Some of the pros are:
- Very immersive
- Wonderful Graphics (as good as currently able in VR headsets at the moment)
- Not to be a spoiler, but it's hard to believe where you are at the end of the game ... considering you start on a beach.
- Impressive feelings of descending at various parts.
- Decent Locomotion. I'll go thru the game again in a month or so. It's that fun. Next time I'll use locomotion via pointing with hand controller instead of 'looking' to next blink location. I didn't realize until recently that was an option!

Cons:
none really, had a few studders early on, but I think was due to my GPU getting a bit warm due to a failing fan in my PC case.

It truthfully isn't much of a game, however. While there's a couple of puzzles and a little maze, it's mostly just exploring the environment, interacting with objects (which can be fun in itself) and discovering the story. The fact that, in VR, you are actually there, really makes this an experience rather than just a nice little story. Though limited, I also thought the voice acting was well done.

That being said, I wish you could give a neutral rating on Steam, because at 2 hours, including a fair amount of time fooling around with breaking bottles and setting off fireworks, I think the price tag, currently at $30, is steep. I hope future episodes are either cheaper or include more content, otherwise I may not continue this adventure. And I do want to continue it. I don't know where you go at the end, but it's bound to be a cool trip.

-the game froze for a brief moment a few times, kind of disorientating experience in VR
-the price, as many have complained, is a bit high for it's length but I would gladly pay the same amount for the next part of the series
The good things I really liked about the game
-The backpack was a really innovative and amazing use of VR. Felt very cool, hope a lot of games pick up on this idea
-Atmosphere is really next level. Great visuals, random other sounds, music, top notch voice acting, movement system is even better than the lab, flashlight actually being needed and working great. I actually flipped my controller upside when using it to read some papers in the sewers like I would a real flashlight. A ton of other little things
-Despite the game I actually cared about the characters
Overall just really blown away by the experience. I really hope the next one comes quickly. Kudos to the creators of this game, your game was really special. Best thing I've experieced on VR yet

I am eagerly awaiting Episode 2, even though I suspect it too will have a high price. You do have to consider the fact that this is an experimental field, both for developers and consumers, which is why The headsets are so expensive, as well as the games. There is not enough information on either end to predict the direction virtual reality will take. Just my two cents, but I feel the 30 dollar price tag is well justified! 

11/10 will play again, waiting on the next episode!

Also: There are some tracking glitches and the beach (firepit) area does have a very glitchy stutter making you motion sick, but looking straight up kind of fixes it when it gets bad.

One huge downside that I wish I knew before I started the game - If your chaperone bounds tend to show up when you stretch both arms you will be constantly shown the stupid chaperone grid due to how you move around in this game. Having enough room to at least get 1.5 your arm span would be most ideal. My temporary setup was a rectangle and the narrow side was very annoying for this title. Not the game's fault really.

---------------------------------
Update, 4 years later.
---------------------------------

I originally played this game when the HTC Vive just came out and VR wasn't even a thing then. Four years later, I upgraded to an Index and I gotta say, this game has not aged well.

The texture has very low resolution, which was fine since the Vive didn't have much resolution to begin with, but now the game looks dated. The motion system uses blink teleporting, which kind of made sense at the time since VR was new and ways to move and interact with the environment is something no one knew at the time, but today it feels clunky and unnatural.

I know Cloudhead has moved on to other things, but it'd be nice to deliver a small update to this game, improving the visuals a bit and fixing motion to more modern methods.

The game is still fun and the story is enthralling, the mechanics just haven't kept with the times.",1465049887,1601131200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It isn't a demo, or a quick experiment. It's not something somebody threw together for a college project. It's a short (< 2 hours) adventure game with easy puzzles, but the art assets and voice acting are what you expect from a full retail game. The world isn't huge; there are 4 locations in the game, but they are all properly atmospheric and look great. This is a glimse at what a full-blown AAA VR game would be like, even if this is only part of one.

The controls all just work. Tracking of the two Vive controllers is fine, the haptic feedback works when it needs to, but wasn't anything special. The ""blink"" method of locomotion is passable. I wish the rotation of the destination weren't so finicky. Holding the flashlight and map at the same time, using the flashlight to illuminate the world and the map is great. Item management works well, though it's strange that many objects just can't be taken (only special items can be stored).

If these puzzles appeared in a regular 2D adventure game, they would be insufficient. The thing about VR, though, is that if you trade that off with immersion, it's ok. I feel that the stuff that's here, while basic, works well enough because you're *inside the damn game*. But don't come in expecting Grim Fandango.

The game is about 110 minutes +/- some time depending on how many bugs you hit. And it's 30 bucks, and it seems like the other chapters will be also. All in will be over $100. If that bugs you, fair enough. But I have two people in the house who will both play it, so to me it's worth the money. My wife and I spend that much on a regular restaurant meal, and you just blew $800 on a Vive. To me, I'd rather do this than play 10 half-baked games.

About the bugs: yes, the developer has work to do. Some items will persist in the game world (for me it was a miniaturized set of ammunition for the flare gun), floating there for no reason as you move through the game. They can get stuck onto your hand, and only a reset got rid of them. I also had several instances where the game was bogged down on my GTX 970/i7@3400 GHz machine, though minimizing the game window on my monitor helped. The game also froze after solving the ""main"" puzzle near the end, which made me have to redo it after restarting. More checkpoints would be nice.

The Gallery is at times spooky, but I'd never say it's scary. There are no jump scares or anything like that, nobody gets in your face. There are a few sections of automatic locomotion that may make some people motion-sick, so beware of those. It's just a few elevators, but it's a substantial amount of game time near the end. Also, if you run into the frame rate issues I had, you might puke; I don't recommend this if you don't meet the Vive's minimum spec.",1464410283,1464410283,True,4,0,0.510986030101776123,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I'd absolutely play this if it was just a regular game, but the very well done VR implementation (backpack is genius!) makes this so much more intense. I have always been more interested in exploring new worlds rather than getting stuck on puzzles all the time, and so The Gallery EP1's pacing is just right.

I played it for longer than a couple of hours and spent a lot of time searching for things and completing some of the achievements. The inventory system is easily the best I've seen so far in VR, the camera repositioning/blink system is incredibly good (if slightly confusing at first and a little wiggy on inclines), and the graphics are very good at highest settings for a first-generation title.

Having that said, I am a 30-year-old gamer and have been an ardent comic book, fantasy, and sci-fi geek my entire life. And what I experienced tonight in Call of the Starseed reduced me to tears when I finished the game. When the credits finished and the game closed out, I took off the headset and sat in the dark, openly weeping with happiness.

I won't spoil it for any of you, but the experience was equivalent to being a child and seeing Stargate for the first time, at the moment when Jackson first sees the Stargate activate and walks through it. Or the first time you saw The Goonies and they found the bottom of the Wishing Well. Or like the first time you played Myst and were swept away by the fantasy of discovering the secrets of the ages. The elation and fear of the unknown, and the sense of impending adventure... it came crashing down on me so suddenly and overwhelmingly that I completely lost my sense of self.

For people the need a TL;DR:

PROS:
- *Excellent* presentation
- Detailed environments
- Interesting puzzles
- Voice acting, audio, and music are splendid
- Inventory and blink movement systems are easily among the best in VR to-date
- Achievements!
- The beginnings of what promises to be an excellent and engaging story
- No motion sickness during moving bits (Elevators, etc.)

CONS: 
- Hand tracking will (very rarely) spaz out for a half-second
- Blink movement will sometimes wig out on inclines or too close to walls, which can be disorienting
- Short length, if you're rushing through it. (I recommend taking your time)
- Pricey for the length, but it's VERY polished for a first generation title
- Physics for loose, thrown, or falling items can sometimes be a little wonky.
- Graphically intensive. Ran perfectly on 980ti at highest settings, might need to go lower with other GPUs
- Accidentally forgot my in-game hands weren't real and punched myself in the face with the Vive controller while reaching for my backpack

This game is really impressive and creative with the game mechanics that were created for it. The inventory system is genious and the teleportation is great since it lets you rotate your play space. Graphics are also pretty good. It has a few puzzles along the way to solve, but pretty simple. 

Cons
The game seemed to have some issues between level loading, one time when the level loaded everything was blurry and couldnt do anything, so I had to restart. Another, the level went to loading and remained black screen forever, had to restart. 

There was some black flickering that happened randomly, I wasnt able to pinpont what was causing it, but others have reported similar. While it was happening, it made it unplayable because the frames were distorted and I simply waited 2-5 seconds for it to pass to continue playing.

It was a little precey for the length IMO, but do not regret purchasing and had a very good VR experience with it, so I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to experience innovative VR gameplay.",1463897506,1463897506,True,0,0,0.465686261653900146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The last 5 or 10 minutes of this game were especially impressive.

Looking forward to more!

(PRICING RANT: It's not like they just took a normal 2D game, applied a little VR magic, and then upped the price for no reason. The entire design process is new, the interactions are new. Most games or VR products out so far offer 10 to 15 minutes of ""gameplay"" (i.e., just a VR movie) for 10 or 15 bucks.

What i saw so far is nicely done and the quality is a lot higher than pretty much all other early roomscale games. Graphics are great too. It's definatly worth the money for me allready. I will update this review onc i finished the game.

I fear it is over soon since it is known to be short but it is worth the money. Episode 2 is a must buy for me allready.

- Very short (90 minutes for me)
- Story is generic... probably because there is only about 20m of story, and the other 70m is exploration/puzzle solving.
- Only 2 real puzzles, and neither is original or that interesting
- Weird developer choice to have the viewport stay consistent with the ground height: This causes the world to move up & down in a weird way (mainly on the Beach) that made me think my Vive was broken. How this didn't cause red flags in QA, I don't know. It feels horrible... so much that you have to limit any moving around and teleport everywhere, which broke my immersion.

Pros
- Good art direction, sound and music
- Really inventive inventory system
- Some really cool visual moments in the last third

Despite its short gameplay, Call of the Starseed truly brings out the raw emotions out of me. Awe, anxiety, fear, and the urge to push forward despite all odds due to the burning curiosity within.

For a first generation VR game, Call of the Starseed is visually stunning. While it does not have the sharpness of modern AAA games due to the limitations of current generation headsets, everything looks surprisingly real, including your own hands. Well animated NPCs and excellent voice acting also helped made this world organic and alive.

The only complain I have is that the price is slightly on the high side for such a short experience, which can be completed around 2 hours if you are not like me and get stuck in almost every puzzle.

However, if you love games that tinges your emotional cord, and doesn't mind paying for future chapters, Call of the Starseed is for you.

I want to support the devs, so I don't return it or something, like some others have done.  

But with that said, I do agree with others in that, it's very-very short, for the price, and still has some issues.  

The story itself was interesting, the audio was nice, and some of the interactions were cool.   But, I also ran into some bugs that broke immersion and also made me kinda motion sick.  


The Good:

- Intersting story
- Nice Audio in general 
- The backpack storage is cool/better than traditional menus/ect.  
- Some nice iteraions with objects/environment.  


The Not So Good/Bugs:

- Blink Navigation (Default Settings) felt a bit clunky to me.    Trying to rotate the teleport space was a little akward with the touch pad, but that's maybe a hardware/firmware issue.   Also aiming with your head is awkward/kinda uncomfortable.  I really like how Valve had it setup, where you aim with the controller, and press the touch pad to instantly teleport.  You have a delay in this game, as you ""walk"" to the teleport area or something.  

- Some of the env. art felt a bit in-consistent.   The last env. felt pretty rough.  Geo wasn't too bad, but the textures looked almost placeholder/temp.  Lower res/too large of UV scale/noitceable seams/ect.   

- In multiple cases, when I leaned my body left/right, the whole world seemed to move up and down or something. Which started to get me a little motion sick/unstable.  It wouldn't always move, and in some cases only 1-2"".  But the worst was when it moved 6"" to 1ft, and I really started to feel un-easy.  Not sure if a bug or what.  

- When I loaded into an area once, maybe since I teleported into a doorway before the load, the loading icon/menu was broken, and I saw 3 large grey planes infront of me.  

- In multiple cases, the Flare Gun ammo got stuck floating in the air attached to my gun.  Or I couldn't drop the ammo/interact anymore.  So I had to load it into the gun to get rid of it, or shoot my flare gun till empty, then reload.

- The backpack, while cool, wouldn't get put away many times, when I thought it did.  So I started to walk away, and it was floating there yet.   Or I could try to drop items into it over my shoulder, and it would miss and fall to the ground.  Unless I wasn't doing something right.  

- The game is very short.  Depending how fast you solve the puzzles.  But, even still maybe only 2-3 hours long.  

- The env was very linear/not really much to explore or checkout.   I probably wouldn't play through a second time. Unless to show friends/ect.

The way the game ""Budget Cuts"" manages this is much better, but still not perfect... we need a hybrid of redirected walking and blink... make it so that when I blink, the game chooses the optimal rotation based on if I have to walk somewhere in physical reality (i.e. up to a desk to pickup something in VR).

Well, there's no twist. This is fine, since it's only the very first part of a story, so it doesn't need a twist. But that means it can't be spoiled, so you don't have to buy this now.

Bei diesem Spiel und dem damit zusammenhängenden neuen Medium der virtuellen Realität komme ich nicht drumrum.

Ersteinmal ein Lob an die Entwickler! Was ihr da geschaffen habt, hat mich total in seinen Bann gezogen. Ich bin die 1,5h die ich für den ersten Lauf gebraucht habe komplett gefesselt gewesen und habe kaum an die reale Welt um mich herum gedacht. Ich hatte mich davor überhaupt nicht mit dem Spiel auseinander gesetzt, lediglich die düstere Stimmung war mir bekannt. Super Job! Ich hoffe, es geht weiter und ich kann die spannende Reise demnächst fortsetzen. 

Die Story baut sich nach den ersten Schritten immer mehr auf, dass Gefühl in einem lebendigen Roman zu stecken wurde erstklassig umgesetzt. Durch das lesen von Texten und den Kasetten wird man immer mehr in die Welt gezogen. Der Spannungsbogen geht stetig nach oben. 

Für ängstliche Spieler kann gesagt sein, dass hier ist kein Horrorspiel. Es entsteht an einigen Stellen eine Stimmung, die einem Horrospiel entsprechen könnte, aber ich hatte zu keinem Zeitpunkt wirklich große Angst oder habe mich erschrocken. Hier wurde bewusst auf ""Jumpscares"" verzichtet, wie es mir scheint. Gute Entscheidung!

Es fällt mir gerade auch schwer etwas negatives über das Spiel zu finden. Bis auf den Preis und die mit der Vive zusammenhängenden Pixeldichte, finde ich nichts. Ich kann das Spiel bedenkenlos für jeden frisch gebackenen Vive Besitzer empfehlen. Deie 28€ sind im Vergleich zur Spielzeit vom ersten Start bis zum Ende relativ hoch, jedoch nicht vergleichbar mit anderen Spielen, die einen 10h oder mehr Storymodus bieten. Für ein solch neues Medium und die neue Art und Weise eine Story zu erzählen ist es das meiner Meinung nach vollkommen wert!

Pros
- Looks good
- Immersive
- Inventory system is fantastic

Cons
- Cumbersome teleport mechanic compared to the teleport mechanic in other VR games
- Overpriced
- Short (1-2 hours)
- Puzzles and exploration are the main focus of the game, but the puzzles fall short

In Depth:
This game is very visual, it tries to look good, and succeeds most of the time. There are only a few moments in the game where I noticed poor-quality textures or mesh clipping. The textures could be due to the fact my GPU is the minimum recommended, so it's not a big deal for me. The game ran fine, no graphical lag, no crashes.

At the time of writing Call of the Starseed is probably one of the most graphically appealing vive reality games out, if you want to experience a nice looking game, this is your best bet, but don't expect the earth.

The main pro here, is that the game is quite immersive due to the way it looks and plays. Another main plus point is the inventory system, I think it sets the benchmark for every other future VR game. Hands down. It doesn’t break the immersion, it’s easy to use, I just wish I could put anything in there not just key items. 

However, there are quite a few cons. 

The teleport navigation is bad, when so many games have done it so well, it makes me a little baffled to think what they must have done to make it so counter-intuitive. It’s like trying to drag a cat around. How you move your controller and where the teleportation target moves does not seem to be linked by any logic.

Picking stuff up is questionable. Quite often I found essential or interesting items impossible to pick up. In numerous circumstances the floor was lower than my own, meaning pressing my controller against the floor would leave the item an inch from reach. This is not a calibration issue, there are different heights in some of the in game floors. There also seems to be a bug when in which you are unable to pick anything up if holding the magnet gun. No matter what you try to pick up, a vacuum tube will teleport to your hand from the gun. In general that portion of the game was very frustrating. Tubes got stuck inside objects and are needed to complete the puzzle, placing your hands inside one tube and trying to pick it up would pull up another tube to the right of it. You could argue this could be a tracking issue. 

The game is overpriced. It just is to me. I understand that a developer, or multiple developers worked hard on this and need to make a living, but for 95 minutes of gameplay, I paid £22.99. Which means I would be paying £15 per hour for something I didn’t even get 2 hours into. That 95 minutes includes credits and restarting areas several times due to item bugs. If the experience changed my life that would be no problem, but the game is 90% wandering and interacting and 10% puzzles. I only noticed 2 puzzles in the game, (ones that require you to think and work out the solution); both of which only took 5 minutes to complete. Which leaves this game drastically lacking in the gameplay department. Leaving the game a mostly interactive story experience, but for this beggining of an episodic story, there really isn’t much story to be had, and any tidbits you get are from listening to tapes. The final nail in the coffin for the overpriced status, is this game is Episode 1, that’s right, the game is episodic. I understand developers sometimes need to break up a game in order to fund the development process, but if people are not impressed they’re not going to buy the second part. By the time I finished the game, it felt like I had just paid for a lengthy demo. The end was visually spectacular, but that’s it. 

To finish. I had fun, I played it to the end, would I recommend it? Yep. If you don’t mind the cost. Which may seem counter-intuitive to what I have been saying. 
The fact is the faults of the game could be forgiven if the price was reasonable, and a reasonable price is subject to personal opinion. I will not be asking for a refund, for the following reason. I want the developers to take my money and spend it on the next one, use people’s suggestions to improve the game. I want to see a much longer episode, with more puzzles and more character interactions, but if it falls short again, I will get the episode refunded and wait until the game is a reasonable price. 

Also, the people in the game seem really really small.

The story is very well put together, the characters are really well acted/fleshed out considering the minimal contact you have with them. I can't really explain how effective it is.

Considering the graphics, the performance of the game is great. I've had so many problems with other Unity games, but this one ran nicely on a R9 290, i5 6600k. Maybe 5 dropped frames the entire time. I did run the game on low, mind, but it still looked great :)

My only critical review point would be about the backpack. I found myself struggling to juggle 2 items then get the backpack out etc. I don't know how I would improve it though, it was just too real :P

I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm already happy with the purchase. The amount of quality content is 10x to 100x that of a lot of £15 games for the Vive, and I feel bad that the devs are getting negative reviews about the price. My argument goes: at least 5 games in the top 20 Vive games are a single scene, with low quality content but good replayability. Now those are great games and they absolutely have a place, but charging £10-£15 for them just seems wrong when put up against disproportionately  high quality content like this.

The problem is that the world raises/lowers based on the position of the headset. Since most of the ground is sloped, shifting your weight or leaning/etc causes the world to raise/lower. Also with the winding map, you're constantly having to turn around and reorient yourself after teleporting. There are a lot of objects close to your player, which isn't comfortable on a Vive. The 'sweet spot' for view distance on a Vive/Rift is at least a few feet from your character. I got this weird sensation after taking it off when physical objects that were close to me felt too close, since the Vive renders near objects as a few feet away. I also found myself impaled by objects several times while teleporting from room to room. That's a little awkward when you're already starting to feel sick.

- The game adjusting your height if you move around on sloped terrain. It's really disorientating. I understand why it's like that but it breaks the feeling of presence.

My GTX 970 chugged a little in the end sequence but I had it cranked to the highest graphics level and it had no issues until that point.

The good:

- story (some reviewers have said its a little lacking in substance but its more of an introduction for the upcoming episodes)
- graphics (textures, animation, and lighting is beautiful)
- interaction with objects and inventory
- sound
- voice acting
- feeling of motion (lifts)

The not so good:

- short (completed in 2 hours)
- puzzles very basic

Analisis D.I.T.

DIVERSION:

Bueno, pues divertido, divertido, no es. He jugado durante mas de media hora, y no he tenido ninguna sensacion especial, no he resuelto ningun puzzle, y no he hecho algo de lo que me sientiera orgulloso (Cosas que se hacen en este tipo de juego).  Para ser un primer nivel, no dejan claro de que va el juego, ni lo que hay que hacer.

INMERSION:

Graficamente esta bastante logrado, y la ambientacion se aprecia. La sensacion de que las manos virtuales son mis manos de verdad, es increhible. 
Coger objetos mola, la mochila como sistema de inventario es muy original y funciona.

Sin embargo el sistema de control, no es el mejor. El hecho de que te cambien el ""frente"" desorienta mucho, y no es intuitivo. Ademas no tiene mucho sentido con las VIVE, si todavia fuese un juego para jugar sentado.


TENSION:

La tension es practicamente nula. La realidad virtual de por si genera un minimo de tension, a la hora de explorar sistios desconocidos. Aun asi, aparte del momento en el que oyes una voz dentro de las alacantarilla, por lo demas es bastante tranquilo.

RECOMIENDO:

Pues sinceramente NO, el precio son casi 30 Euros, los puzzles no tienen ningun sentido.
He mirado otro video 

(SPOILER) 
despues y hay que encontrar un Pomo de una puerta, y ponerlo en la puerta de la alcantarilla para abrirla y entrar dentro 
(END SPOILER).

 Con la media hora que he estado jugando no he encontrado ninguna prueba de como resolver ese puzle. NO tiene ninguna ogica y esta basado en prueba y error.

De todas formas esta es mi opinion personal, aun asi si eres de los fanaticos de las aventuras graficas, quizas pueda interesarte este juego, aun asi esperaria a que bajase de precio.

VR technical:
- The world is gorgeous!
- When you get to close to walls, your vision starts to blur. At some spots it maybe starts to blur a bit too quick. 
- The ingame movement is a blinking system, you can even rotate your play area.
- There is some automatic height adjustments which is quite uncomfortable. So avoid walking on and off ledges, but just blink. There was one point where I went to close to a ledge to look down and I sort of fell to area below. I had to take a breather to get back on my feet. (Devs try to look at these high adjustment mechanics because they could probably improve)
- There is tutorial area which teaches you how to blink and interact with object, which is quite good but doesn't take to long if you already know all this stuff.
- Moving object around can be a bit flaky and could use some work. Somehow it was quite common to bump the controllers together. Mainly because I wanted to try and manipulate items with two hands, which is not possible.",1461317135,1461771244,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

On the one hand, it was lovingly crafted, with lots of little details and a great interface and UI. The time I spent with it was enjoyable, and it felt more like a tripple A game than most launch VR titles do... but on the other, it's so pathetically, laughably short for an adventure game it is insulting to those who pay good money for it. There isn't a whole lot here that isn't what you'd expect from an adventure game, but there's so LITTLE of it is what makes it a problem. 

The story barely, BARELY gets started. If this was a book it would have ended halfway through the prologue, it's that short! I don't know what else I can compare it to, but the length is just plain a joke. Is the story good? Who knows? There isn't even a ghost of enough of it here to be able to tell. Should we be excited for the next chapter? Who knows? This one is so short we barely got past the title before it was over.

A serious player can beat this in well under an hour. The only reason I have as much playtime as I do on record is because I spent an unusually long time playing around with the environment... and despite the shortness, I managed to find a bug that wasted my time for over an hour by denying me a clue that was floating around that I needed to progress.

I hate to harp on how short it is but I just can't get past it. To put it another way, fire up an episodic game from Telltale. Watch the intro. Now play for fifteen minutes. Stop, and that's about how much is here. Now look at what they are charging for this. Can this content possibly justify the price? Another way to put it, there are so few areas for screenshots, the store page actually has one from the tutorial room that has nothing whatsoever to do with the game, other than forced padding! That's some seriously bad form.

Is this a cynical cash grab from a company that is exploiting the launch of VR by overcharging for a glorified demo because they know people will buy it due to the lack of titles at launch? I hope not, because I'd heard from the developer and thought they were more passionate about the project than that. More likely, it wasn't anywhere near completed, but the April 5th launch of the Vive was coming close, and they had to lock down what little they had completed and publish.

I love the quality on display. I love the interface and gameplay, and I'd love to play a full-length adventure game using the systems developed here. It hurts me to have to bash something so polished, and I really, really want to give it a good review... But I cannot, and will not overlook the insane price being charged for a piece of game that is so short it is outpaced by demos on the old PC Gamer disks from the 90s.",1461240738,1461241105,False,3,0,0.475562214851379395,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+ Very polished, beautiful graphics
+ Nice and fluent user interface
+ Quite atmospheric
- Way too short
- Negligable content
- Generic story

""When I finished this game and put off my headset, it was the first time I left VR with an undeniable feeling of disappointment.""

I'll start my review with the most obvious and outstanding positive aspect this game has to offer: It's visuals and atmosphere. You won't encounter the best graphics a PC game has ever offered, but perhaps the best so far incorporated into a VR experience. To stroll around in this environment is a nice pastime in itself, and I really recommend to do so if you want to squeeze some play time out of this game.

This positive impression is even intensified by the relatively large number of interactive objects placed all over the area. Admittedly, most of these items do not allow much more than to grab and view them before you have to put them back or throw them away, others even can just be pushed around. However, in my opinion non-interactive decoration is especially disappointing in VR, so I really approve of this level of detail.

The second big plus of this game is its fluent user interface. The backpack inventory works well and just looks great. Picking up, using and combining items mostly worked like a charm.

If you want a decent example of what is currently possible in the visual department of VR, don't expect more and just have the money, don't read any further and just open your pocket. I suppose in this case your rig also contains at least a GTX 980, which I would more than recommend for this game.

If it is the label ""VR puzzle adventure"" that caught your attention - like it was for me - then you better prepare for a disappointment that reaches from slight to huge, depending on your expectations. Either Cloudhead Games put a disproportionate strong focus on visuals right from the start, or they just ran out of time, budget or both, and didn't manage to add a decent amount of puzzles and story elements. Taking into account the large number of absolutely useless (in the sense of unused) clues littered all over the walls, I'd vote for the latter.

To put this into numbers: The whole game contains not more than four puzzles that are halfways worthy to be named as such. This is even less than the number of stages or levels, and consequently there are stages without any puzzle at all. Well, if you need a map to navigate from your living room to your kitchen and perceive this endeavor as challenging, your counter might go as high as half a dozen puzzles. To put this lack of content into other words: If you watched the video and screenshots on top of this page, you didn't see a teaser but literally every single relevant scene of the game.

When it comes to the story, there is not much to say, as there is not much story. It is not particularly bad or good, it is just generic. You'll encounter stereotypic video game story elements as the crazy scientist, the alien artefact, the guys that litter the environment with short audio snippets (for whatever reasons, probably because they are just carrying too many audio tapes with them), the sewers (big plus, I love sewers), and some nondescript bad guy. As the story starts to unfold, the game unfortunately ends.

Conclusion: Cloudhead Games put a lot of effort and budget into the visual appearance of this game - with success. Unfortunately they forgot to divert some resources into the creation of a sufficient amount of puzzles so the game could be called a puzzler. Most browser escape games offer more and more challenging puzzles. If you decide to give this game a try, do it slowly. Take your time, enjoy the environment and then even slow down more. If you start to rush, you'll ecounter the credits in less than an hour.",1461090666,1461090666,False,47,0,0.716801643371582031,0,False,False,False,False,,,

But I simply cannot recommend the game based on the amount of content in the game. It took me a fair amount of time to solve the couple of (actually very simple) puzzles that are there, the time taken mostly by not noticing visual clues which lead to the solution of the puzzle. But even with this relatively slow problem solving the whole game lasted 90mins. Its like a single level of a game.

I fully understand the tiny market the developers are dealing with here and they would like to pay their own wages and invest in the future of the platform, but I have come away from this game feeling very impressed with the content that is there but unhappy with the amount of it.

I feel like even within the small level that you play through the developers could have stretched out the content, maybe making it a little more difficult or simply putting more puzzles in each stage of the level.

I think ultimately it comes down to this: Are you prepared to invest $30/£23 in not just your own experience but in the future of the platform and the developers, because you have to want both as the experience itself just isn't worth the asking price in terms of what we are used to as far as games go.

I wouldn't have chosen a 'yes' or 'no' for the recommend option if I didn't have to as I think it hinges on the above question. Personally I think bringing the price down to £17-18 would make it easier to accept and help the game gain wider adoption ultimately resulting in not much loss of revenue, if any at all. Having said this I expect the developers have done more research into the market than my anecdotal guessing.

As a first episode of a larger series, a typical playthrough will last maybe 1 or 2 hours, but it can easily go more depending on how much you like to interact with the environment.

There has been a resurgence of adventure games recently with Telltale's series and Life Is Strange. This game hearkens back more to those adventure games of the 90s that LucasArts used to make, and the popular Myst series. There is still a strong narrative but it doesn't take as much focus as the more recent adventure offerings which are often small bits of gameplay peppered around long cutscenes and NPC dialogue. Here the emphasis is more on environmental storytelling, with additional exposition being delivered via cassette tapes you'll (perhaps inexplicably) find around the game, and traditional NPC dialogue. 

The game has some of the best interaction with objects I've seen in a game. Most objects you can find in the game are able to picked up, and the way your virtual hands interact with them feel very natural. This game also has the best virtual inventory system I've seen in a game; you pull a backpack out from behind your back and reach to grab the items you want from it. If you want to stow something into your backpack, whilst holding the item you reach behind your back. The occasional puzzles you encounter in the game use this excellent interaction model to great effect. 

This is one of the best launch titles for VR, highly polished with about two hours of content. So the question is is it worth it? Currently it is one of the highest priced games on Steam for VR. Personally I felt the price was worth it, but that opinion is coloured by virtue of this being a VR game. If this was not a VR game, I feel like this game would be better priced at about $20 for the episode. I don't think you can disregard the VR because right now the audience for VR is very small and the developers likely need to charge a higher price to compensate for smaller sales. If you're looking for a VR adventure game in the vein of Myst or The Dig, then I recommend this.

On paper it's a straightforward adventure game but, if The Gallery is any indication, VR will be transformative for the genre. The hand tracking makes such a difference. For example, early on you're navigating some dark tunnels. You've got a map and you've got a torch. To look at the map you reach over your back to grab your backpack, get the map out, hold it up to your face and shine the torch on it with your other hand. While these interactions are necessarily a little abstracted (without any kind of finger tracking you're only really able to grab and release), they're enough to really draw you in to the experience. And it is absolutely worth being drawn in to.

Regarding price, I don't have a problem with it at all. Maybe in the future when there are thousands of incredible 10+ hour VR games to choose from at the same price point I would think twice. Right now though this is an experience you can't get anywhere else. Compared to the IMAX, a football match or a theme park I think it’s totally reasonable. If anything it might be too cheap considering the limited user base and the high production values. I hope the developers make enough from it to finish the story. 

In conclusion, the game is great; please buy it so I can play the next one.

Call of the Starseed is a bold first step into a new way of telling stories. This isn't just a game. It's not just an interactive movie. This is something new, that cannot be experience outside of VR. This envoked in me emotions of awe / wonder / curiosty to an extent I can't compare to anything else. The massive scale during some sequences left my jaw wide open. The tracked controllers played a pivital role in bringing me into the experience.

This should, without question, be on the top of your VR list.",1460180078,1460180537,True,35,1,0.749856412410736084,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Polished, Innovative, story driven and ahead of its time. The game is exactly what I have been looking for in a VR experience. The controls just work and the inventory system is very innovative. There is a level of polish seen here that is truly breathtaking for a first gen VR game. The real con here is the lack of content on offer. This game doesn’t feel like a $30 piece of content. It took me only 2 hours to finish and that was after having the final puzzle break on me the first time after completing it; albeit The only bug I encountered in my play through. Seeing as the game does not offer much on the replayability front, it is a hard sell at the current price. I strongly recommend this game to anyone once it goes on sale for $25 or less.

If you're looking for an ""actual game"", and not some trumped up tech demos, this is it. If you can afford to buy it, you absolutely should, that said... 30 bucks...? Ehhh... 15 or even 20 may have been easier to swallow, considering I've completed it, and steam shows me at exactly 103 minutes. There's no replayablity, unless you just want to ""do it again"", or maybe showcase it to a friend.

THAT SAID, it's awesome for that 100 minutes or so. The puzzles are trivial, and you're mostly just plowing through it to do it. Right when it gets interesting, it ends, but it's episodic. I expected that.

All told, 30 bucks isn't a big deal to me, and I think it was worth it. I'm not saving allowances or anything anymore though... so you may be in a different boat.",1460062564,1460062627,True,8,1,0.508824586868286133,0,True,False,False,False,,,

At a $30 price point for the time I spent in the game I would be hesitant to recommend this right out, but I think that the quality of the game and the polish I felt while playing it I would definitely suggest giving this a shot. Don't go into this thinking it will be like the old school point and click adventures as the puzzles are generally nonexistant and you rarely interact directly with any characters. Go into this for the feeling of adventure.

Pros:
-Looks and sounds beautiful
-Great acting
-Movement system pretty intuitive and with no motion sickness
-Interacting with everything feels great
-Feels like I'm in a movie

Cons:
-Short, very short. Short enough that I am concerned about the price point.
-Shooting flares was somehow the hardest thing I had to do in the game
