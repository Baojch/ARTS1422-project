As far as I've gotten, the game's story is simple, nothing to break your head over. The soundtrack is perfectly nostalgic and fitting to the atmosphere, and the mechanics are easy to learn. I would say that what made this game so enjoyable for me was precisely its simplicity and its setting, it was like a trip to the good games of the past.

My favorite point in the game was undoubtedly the dungeons, in which I really felt challenged and the large number of enemies makes everything even more challenging. I really like that.

Regarding gameplay, the game has a variety of weapons that you can use to harm enemies, from magic to stones that you collect on the ground. Boss fights are fun and have their level of challenge.

The game's performance is great, with fluid graphics and animations. There are no delays or failures, which makes gameplay even more enjoyable.

Basic mechanics, very contained world, minimalist presentation, and a simple story - no surprises or anything groundbreaking, and yet I liked it more than many higher-budget games I played recently. No unnecessary crafting systems, random generation, RPG mechanics, fan service, or staggering difficulty - TT2 knows exactly what it is, and isn't trying to be anything else.

Not to say it's all great though. Even though the world is pretty small, it's still large enough to get lost in, and complete lack of a map doesn't help. The game's inventory, or rather its encumbrance system feel a bit too involved and out of place in an otherwise very straight-forward game. You can only carry a grand total of 25 items across all types, and as your inventory is constantly clogged with junk Tim Tim auto-collects, it all has to be purged any time you come across a store.
Lastly, I can't ignore the elephant in the room - the frame rate! For some unfathomable reason the game is locked at only 15 fps! Why? I have no idea whatsoever, but it does harm the overall experience, and should the game be even a little more challenging, would've been a deal-breaker, alas, it's all still surprisingly playable.
