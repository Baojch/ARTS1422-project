It has enough mechanics that make its gameplay easy to play but difficult to master. There's a surprising number of stages too. At time of writing, I've played two and a half hours and am still unlocking new tombs to be completed. The Curator's Well feature is also well-realised, and decent to use. Sadly, there isn't a way to share your created levels with others, but there seems potential for this in the future. The game has been regularly updated since launch, with plenty of bug fixes and improvements. They also added Steam Achievements and localisation. This game is good value for money considering the content included for the price.

Summarise:

+ Solid gameplay, easy to play and difficult to master
+ Plentiful levels
+ Haven't encountered any bugs
+ Regular updates in response to user feedback
+ Level creator is fun to experiment with
+ Potential for growth
+ Good value for money

- Level creator UI can be confusing at first. Open menu, select item, close menu, place item.
