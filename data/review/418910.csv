Some things don't work right and parts of the game may not work at all. Different people experience different issues. Some things that should don't work when you're offline, making the game even worse to play as you have to constantly baby sit it.

Fun when you first play it. New game feel.
13 hours later I was bored as hell.
It's way too grindy. It's extremely repetitive. And it's broken.

Eventually, you conquer everything and you get to start from scratch again with a few points for the next reset, and so forth. Over and over and over. It's the exact same game every time with just a few more resources each time.

Your goal: to build wonders. Therefore you must conquer all settlements (set amount each time) and the 3 ruins. Each ruin gives you 1 fragment. 1st wonder 4 fragments, pick the wrong one, you're screwed. Next wonder 16 fragments and so forth. I picked the wrong one. Every reset your hero starts at level 1, I never got my hero past level 3 after 7 resets. and you can only send him out every 10 minutes. Level 1, expect your hero to mostly fail. Exploration reset doesn't work when you're offline, making the game even more tedious. Also your Keep troops don't level when you're offline. I got 2 of them once to level 1 from the 13 hours I played the game. They also reset their levels when you reset, even if you retain them.

Finally you learn to only build Templars & Markmans and only worship the god of war (of the 6 gods) if you want to get anywhere.

At least there are no micro-transactions to get in the way.

Overall the game is uninspiring (frankly, utterly boring).",1590700847,1591108632,False,6,0,0.562856316566467285,0,True,False,True,False,,,

The problems that I have may not be the ones that prevent the game from being fun for other people but for me are enough to give a thumbs down from me.

First problem is no manual, and no way to correct a mistake.

The game is a simple clicker type game but after spending many hours playing you can click wrong once and loose hours of work.  While this is not the main issue, the problem is you do not know you are making a mistake till you do it, and no way to know ahead till you make it.

The other issue is because it scales production you end up with bugs where your production should cost one level but you end up paying another.  To fix it you have to exit the game and restart the game to clear the memory and reset the formula.  This happens each time, so you only get the ""fix"" one time as soon as you change screens it reverts to the broken formula.

End result the more I played the more the bugs/issues drained the fun from the game.

Its fun for a few hours, just long enough to not be able to refund,  But not fun long enough to pay for, as there are plenty of free games of this type that you can play.

There are multiple flaws in how the game works, a few examples would be:


- There is a rebirth system, but the rewards are very minimal and extremly expensive. With an idle game you expect each run to go twice as far.... rebirthing here feels useless.
- The scaling of costs is insane while there is no scaling in generation of recourses. And like mentioned before the rebirth won't really solve this enough.
- There is a lot of important info missing that you really need, for example. Before you choose your regligion and be stuck with that for the run it would be nice to actually see the benefits.
- At one point your gold recourse literally generates a milion times more then your other recources. So you'll be ignoring leveling these recourses completly and resort to the trading market to convert your gold to these recources.

I can go on but I think you get the gist. (I might discover some stuff that debunks some of my statements, but that will only go back to the point of missing information)

The game is a bit fun if you are really into idle games (which I am). But I would never recommend it to others as it simple holds too many flaws over the slight increased depth it holds. Also this depth becomes nothing more then an automated system you a couple of times a day before you close it again.

What you have here is a much different clicker experience. It's really like Adventure communist (which this came before btw) in that you have multiple different resources, but unlike that, each building costs a specific resource, but each one you can alsi immdeiately gather manually. Only, one resource you cannot gather, is population, which also must be allocated between each resource in order to idly gather it. Population requires food, and room, whihc is increased via houses.

After building enough structures, you gain the ability to start building an army, which is used for exploration (random bonuses and resources can be gained from these, depending on how many troops or people you send exploring), and raiding NPC villages and towns of varying and scaling difficulty and strength, (for a special resource which you can use to build monuments).

You can prestige by creating a new colony, after doing so, you have Civilization Points which you can use to spend on perks. Standard fare for the most part.

The game itself is pretty good, it's a nice breath of fresh air from the somewhat monotony that clicker games essentially are suffering from (what with the clones of clicker heroes which barely have any difference and all).

Things it could help to have added:
- Multiplayer Raids
- Some kind of Guild system where you launch joint-attacks on massive fortresses for special artifacts with help from other players.
- Tougher NPC towns for when you have literally thousands of Templars
- NPC Towns that scle based on the number of Colonies you've built.
- NPC Raids upon your town, Walls are basically useless. Or more tougher raids.
- Leaderboards.

Right now, I can't recommend the game as I just have no interest in it right now. Sadly, it doesn't have much in the way of end-game content and is a bit incomplete for hte time being. With any hope, it'll get updated more with more content, features, but right now, just don't bother.

Ну, вы их знаете. Собери ресурс Х, чтобы собрать побольше ресурса Y, чтобы собрать ресурс Z, чтобы купить убер-усилители X, Y, Z, разлочить T и повторить всё сначала. Только что ресурсы здесь добываются как зданиями (которые всё дороже), так и людьми (которые служат мультипликатором - но тоже дороже с каждым человеком).

И точно как всегда, наиболее вкусные усилители доступны только если начать всё с нуля (что даёт ""очки цивилизации"", тем больше, чем дальше вы продвинулись, за которые можно разлочивать перманентные усилители).

Development seems to stop, game has no endgame content, there are bugs like achievements not unlocking.
Only for fans of idle games, otherwise gets boring really fast.


Review:
Idle Civilisation has nothing to put it apart from other idle games, with maybe one exception. However there is no real sense of progression as some basic expected functions are hidden behind a very expensive buildings.

Graphics 4/10:
Despite retro looks the game is actually quite ugly. There is something both in the colony map and in the world map, that puts me off - lack of colour, area design perhaps? 
Interface is clunky and cramped, research matrix is barely readable, tavern screen has popup covering some of your heroes making navigation difficult, etc etc.

Audio 4/10:
Apparently music was supposed to be next large update to the game. Right now it's just few annoying loops and whooshing sounds. Monotonous, boring, but there are  option settings for volume and muting!

Gameplay 6/10:
It's difficult sometimes to understand why incremental games are so popular. 
This one clearly has little to it, as the massive increase in amounts is not really offset by skills/techs or other things like that. I am not sure how on earth I would ever get 100 000 000 people without leaving game running with CE speedhack for weeks.

One thing that is good however are somewhat nice Hero Quests and Rare Sightings. These are creative and fun to read, but their number is limited.

Conclusion:
Buy only on sale or if real fan of idle games. There is maybe like two dozen hours of action before you get bored to death like me.",1483993326,1483993361,False,3,0,0.429488062858581543,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This is easily one of the best clickers I've ever played, and that's due largely to the fact that it adequately disguises the clicker elements in a deep set of strategic rules that always empower the player. 

I've played over a thousand hours of Clicker Heroes, which I still play to this day, and I've found I'm a pretty big fan of clicker games, as I enjoy the playstyle of making small changes to effect big developments. 

This game doesn't let me down on that front. It was a bit overwhelming at first, as I wasn't completely clear on how things related to each other. A couple of hours later, I was playing like a pro and already dreaming up strategies to get further and further.

One of the nicest things about Idle Civilizations is that it doesn't leave you idling for hours, waiting for things to do. If you want to setup a good idle build, you can do that, but you can also sit at the computer and do quests, raids, exploration, or just plain development, while you wait for resources to build. 

This is perhaps one of the best things about the game, is that it can feel completely like a strategy game if you want it to, or a clicker idle game if that's what you'd prefer. 

Either way, this game is definitely worth the very generously low asking price.

Idle Civilization is an idle game that - ironically - can keep you busy.

Whereas in most idle games you have only one resource you mainly spend, and then one reset resource, here you have five main resources, one complementary resource and one reset resource. The game simulates a colony, a settlement in the middle of rich grasslands, with forests and mines abundant. You use food mainly to receive more population (more on this later). Wood and Stone are used to build basic buildings, Metal and Gold are used for more advanced buildings. Sadly each building uses only up to two different resources - more depth would have been good here, even if it wouldn't change the gameplay much. The sixth resource is faith which has no real use beyond a certain income and can't be traded. More on faith later.

I feel like the game is explained best by the order it unlocks its things, so let me try to give an overview here.
At the beginning you have a settlement with two people - I assume they are one male and one female, and please don't make the incest jokes then as I will also assume that the population mainly comes from people immigrating, not from them having thousands of genrations of children.

Starting out:
So you have those two people, but no resources and no research. Thankfully the tutorial tells you what to do: You click ten times to gather food (if you go for all ingame achievements you will need to click on each of the three collectible items 10,000 times in total, while in reality you would need less than 200 clicks in total there for the entire game). After you got the ten food, you can do your first research, after which your people can be freely assigned to any resource you know - food, wood and stone at the beginning. So you should assign them to wood, build a hut, assign them to food to get more population. Now with six population, you distribute them equally, so you have an income of all resources. After about one minute you can build a building that generates food, wood or stone. Of course, you choose wood. After another minute or so, you build the first stone building. You keep on building more then, and when you have three or four you go for the next higher tier which takes like ten times the resources but generates a lot more as well. So you get more income, can build more huts and population.

Exploration:
So far, so standard. Now you can research writing, which enables you to do pretty much everything. It is a prerequisite to metal working, but also enables a random event system with only few bad events. I am not sure if exploration is unlocked now or was already from the start. On exploration you send up to half of your current population to explore the neighborhood. They are either sent on a 20 second exploration with no risk, or later on a 40 second exploration with some risk of dying (you will need drafted but not specialized soldiers for that, more on this later). Each exploration gives you the chance to see a strange event. NEVER click on no here - the strange events always have a positive outcome, and one of the first gives you even a permanent bonus that includes higher birth rates (which further down the road translates into a higher max population but for now only saves some food and time), a 50 percent production bonus, and much more.

Metal and Coins, Reset:
You unlock metal now which unlocks coins. This for now allows you to do further research. At some point you will have 10 colony points (125 civilization points) and you will want to reset the game, but not before having gotten religion. More info below. Invest the few points so you always start with writing, have higher income, By now you will think you never get to 100 colony points, but this is not true - things will soon explode.

After the reset, things go a bit faster, you get back to the point where you were before, including unlocking religion. Things go slightly faster now, and eventually you can unlock wages which don't really do much now - the first few colonies take a while to set up.

Wages will increase your income. Simple as that. You pay a percentage of coins produced, but the gain is so high that  you make more money up to a high extent, essentially multiplying all income. When you have enough resources to build the highest coin production building, you are in for that treat, if not before.


Other activities:
You will have access to religion which allows you to choose one of six deitys, each with five spells that charge over time and need faith to do so - the production will soon be enough to fill all up constantly. Depending on your playstyle each deity has its advantages, but the war deity is especially helpful when you set out to conquer the entire world for the first time. After that, you will have enough colony points to invest into a 100 colony points perk that reduces food costs for new population extremely, so you can always keep on drafting. For that reason, you will also invest some into the perk that drafts more people at once and the one that increases birthrates. At the end, I think Chrysantema is good to choose as she provides a bonus to colony points and free research etc. for the next colony. In fact, if you choose her for your very first colony and use all her abilities ten times (at least the three that stack), the second colony will get you greatly further in the game. But combined with the 100 colony points thing she is even better. The thing is just, you need all six gods for all ingame achievements, so you will want to do them in the early colonies to choose those later that you want to use.

Anyway, eventualy you also unlock a tavern - possibly by choosing the perk - and can have a free hero thanks to the permanent bonus from the strange sighting. The hero is sent on adventures which makes him gain experience - needed to unlock more adventures - and find valuable items, at least in the sense that they grant extra bonuses. Selling them for a small glory price is not recommended, unless you already have one of the item or you are about to reset. The hero can't die, but he can fail the mission - resulting in him just wasting time. In roughly 2 of 3 cases he will succeed and grant a small bonus to your colony then.

You unlock the keep later where you can get Covinari. Those are freelancers like the hero, but give a permanent bonus and malus to the colony. I prefer the 10 percent more production but 10 percent higher food costs for population. They level up over time and can unlock extra bonuses for your colony, including their main bonus - but not malus - being multiplied.

Culture increases your happiness by using - but not spending - part of your civilization score to host festivals, which in turn raises production and later birth rates.

The military finally lets you draft soldiers and specialize them. Unspecialized soldiers are gained by drafting or by losing specialized soldiers - a very beneficial system that makes sure you only lost resources but not population. You can conquer other cities - at the beginning you want to conquer the tier 1 cities, but after a few colonies you can have a military big enough to start with the best cities already and conquer everything. Specialized soldiers come in melee and ranged, where usually ranged deals the damage and melee tanks. You will want to only recruit the highest available tier, as the others just do less but cost less resources.

There is a marketplace which I think is unlocked by a perk and lets you trade resources 50:1, but with some buildings this gets down to 1:1. This is pretty useful to create more buildings, which you should always do before resetting. Each building gives civilization points, and I think so also does each population.

Secondly whenever you load up your game you military auto defaults back to 50. this back fires if you have the draft option clicks and it starts drafting people down to 50 when you previously had it set for something much higher.",1470359278,1470363432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

游戏简介：
玩了10小时，除了还有10来个科技、外交和市集Tab没解锁外都已经玩到了。。我想用一句话把发展说清楚。。。（主线）点击获得第一桶金->造民房拉拢村民自动采集->造自动采集的建筑收集更多资源->解锁科技树->生产信仰获得神的护佑助力发展->征召军队踏平\十字军模式\外交拉拢等搞定其他城镇收保护费->循环
（支线）文明点数和人民幸福度，酒馆和英雄任务，背包和村民军队探索，议会和特色将领，市场和（py）交易等

个人心得：
感觉比较容易劝退萌新的一个游戏，虽然只是在制作中，但同其他clickers相比较更交错复杂的系统绝对是新人杀手（尤其是还木有中文~）。

首先新人引导很长很长，而且有一个大坑，那就是传统clickers必有的重生加成。为什么是大坑呢？因为他在你好不容易学会布局基本资源采集的时候不经意一点，啥都没了。。。这可是需要不少时间积累啊~坑的还不止这点，越往后越会发现，你发展和收获的太多了，人口、军队、奇迹、英雄、议会，几乎没有重生的动力。。。谁会在好不容易统领全地图的时候去点重生获取可怜的加成呢？。。。

其次就是游戏的系统了，相比之前评测的其他clicker，这款比较新的作品更像一个策略游戏，作者本身也承认了这一点，但不管怎样本质应该还是一个休闲放置的clicker游戏，不应该在把系统做的那么复杂，且许多设置上限制的时间间隔太短或者数量太小，后面讲系统具体会讲到

再次就是游戏的画面，入手前看介绍就觉得UI还行，画面跟没有一样，事实上的确如此，实际上个人觉得画面撑死了就是一个静态背景，甚至没有都没问题，不影响游戏进展~

当然除了吐槽的几点，舒缓的音乐、庞大的科技树、军队和战争还是不错的，各项系统间的协调性相比clicker heroes那种极致混加要自然得多，并且目前没看到什么p2w机制，看得出来作者的野心不止在做一款简单的放置游戏，如果平衡性做的更好，系统限制做的更人性化，拓展性能够增强而不仅限于野蛮的重生加成，它会吸引相当一批策略休闲玩家~

游戏画面：
这次系统框架太大了。。先写画面，从UI界面来说，还算是干净整洁，唯一的不足应该是看着界面上密密麻麻的按钮不知所措。。。新手引导并没有教太多这方面。而画面本身就像我在上面说的，可有可无，固定的一张地图，固定的建筑位置和数量，统统都是静态的！除了给各个菜单做背景，想不出还有啥作用，这么看设置里的分辨率、全屏窗口化等其他设置其实也有点多余~不过 这个色调个人还是挺喜欢的。

游戏音乐&音效：
游戏的音乐好像有2首，慢节奏欧洲田园风，听起来挺舒服的。各种音效中规中矩，因为系统比较庞大的缘故，所以音效也相对更多~

游戏系统：
1.资源系统：
(1).资源是本作的核心，可以收集的资源种类相当丰富：食物、木材、石头、金属、金币、信仰。虽然比起许多策略游戏来说不算什么，但一个放置类的clicker有那么多资源还是很吓人的（也可能是我见识不多？）
(2).点击可以获得的资源仅限于：食物、木材、石头。
(3).获取资源的方式各不相同：除了点击，食物、木材、石头、金属、金币、信仰本身都能通过分配村民自动生产，除此以外还有对应的生产建筑，每种资源4种建筑对应4种生产量级（信仰只有2种），当然基于大数值的原则，每造一座成本是要提升的。占领地图上的其他城镇、村落也能获取一种资源的供应。
(4).花费资源的途经也不少：建筑建造、科技树升级、招募军队是基本花销，所需要的资源搭配各不相同，一般都是1-2种。金币还可以发放工资，提升全体资源生产效率。后期食物作用不小，因为提升每一个人口需要的食物都很吓人，但没有人口就没有军队，征服世界就只能是梦了。。。此外，信仰可以获取神的护佑。
(5).还有一些次级资源：
  -文明点数：提升人民幸福，从哪获得的我表示懵逼
  -建筑残片：人民探索可以获得，收集一定数量获得免费建筑一座
  -书籍残片：人民探索可以获得，收集一定数量可以获得免费科技点一个
  -装饰物：我什么都不知道。。
  -升级碎片：用来建造奇迹，哪来的我也不知道。。。
  -荣耀点:招募英雄
  -其他:无力吐槽的我暂时没发现的资源...

2.人力系统:
(1).点击生产:仅限食物，木材，石头
(2).指派劳动力干活。建造人口住宅后若食物足够人口会增加，可以指派新增人口来生产资源。
(3).探索:仅村民探索或者与军队一起探索，花费一定人力时间，获取资源，前期很实用

3.建筑系统:
(1).分为提升人口，提升食物，提升木材，提升石头，提升金属，提升金钱，提升信仰，提升交易，其他几类
(2).其他类包括城墙和学院，其中学院可以提升整体资源产量",1467809698,1467809871,True,2,1,0.557522118091583252,3,True,False,True,False,,,

You actually have to try to get good in this, even though you don't REALLY need to try. 

Now I have commented on this before, I just changed my username from Redheaded_Gamer to now Dukase, and I am being patient, especially since this most recent update. But there should be animations. And no rush devs! Creating a game is not easy, I know. Take your time and I will update my review as much as possible!

I am not the kind of person to do pros and cons. I feel like it would put the Devs down if they saw cons. So I will just constructively criticise the game! It is way less harsh in my opinion, since I won't just say how bad something is and not give a reason.

So first up, as I mentioned, and I will again (Please don't be annoyed!) Animations. Something that would give the game THAT much more life! And it does not have to be big, it can just be the grass flowing in the wind, the water moving with the stream and twinkling in the light. And maybe a day and night cycle. It's pretty awesome how the game is so far, but this sould just hook me, totally.

Now another thing I recommend are sound effect. Like environmental sounds. The water, the wind, birds, the mine, people chatting, maybe you would hear the eventual cow or so in the distance. Just something to go with the animations. To give the game a Simulator feel, but at the same time keeping it an idle game. 

And one last itty bitty thing. And I really don't care if this is added or not. But it would be cool if you could create a character. And you could upgrade that character to give your town a boost or two. And with that character you could visit other peoples civilizations. Give them a production boost or something. That would be cool.

So yeah. That is my review on this great little game! I am so glad to see it develop like it is! Even though at first it seemed abandoned. I did not give up on the game! And I can't for a game that I payed for, and love! I would be glad to be a Dev of this game, since its community has grown so much! Great job guys!

Thanks for reading,

Yes, this is an idle game - but there is a lot to do actively, if you're willing to spend time on it. Moreover the game is being expanded pretty constantly - it doesn't look like much now, but as an early access player you can help shape the game into something even better.

From what they offer, this game is based on City-Management type game but with ""Idle"" type, and if you really notice what  is the idle they mean... its the whole. Graphics is idle, gameplay is idle, nothing special effects but gives boost on your civilization, war with other civilization but with less brutallity but more idle war. Gain resources to upgrade idle facilities, you can even gain until Quintrilion, even though i don`t know how much zeros. 

I mean everything is idle. Thats the game suppose to be.
My only problems is how you get the Civilization Points, and use it for raising perks when building new Cities. I mean, if you wish to gain more perks, you need to build back your city, but when you already build city big enough, and you wish to reset to gain perks, you might think twice before doing so. 

Other than that is the game price is around $5, which is pretty expensive for this small game. 
Overall this game is not bad, maybe this is my first clicker game, but like I said, when I bored, I play this game :p

In this idle game you won't idle or indeed clicker a lot. The game generates ressources while offline though so it's an idle game to this regard or you can leave it on and purchase updates every hour or so while it grinds.
There is a lot of tactical depth and exploration in this game so I would consider this a attention-heavy idler similar to a normal strategy game actually.

There's already a lot of content and I enjoy playing it. There are a lot of bugs like with the population displaying broken numbers but nothing truly game-breaking actually. Some stuff still needs balancing.

Even though it's in EA and not f2p, this is still pretty good for how it is. It's slow at first, but it starts to stack up over time. It's not like the other ones, i.e. Tap Heroes, Clicker Heroes, or Sakura Clicker, it's more like Adventure Capitalist where you sit and gradually upgrade your mineral per second. I recommend this to those who want something to check on every now and then, or play while watching a TV show or binge watching YouTube.

Edit: The music also sounds like old school Runescape, that's just my opinion.

Edit 2: With the update that fixed minor things, it seemed to have gotten a bit better. I, honestly, enjoy the new wage system. Just be careful, if you type in ""100"", it'll get rid of all your coins per second.

Edit 3: After playing over a hundred hours, I can honestly say this is the best clicker/idle game I've played, it's really quite enjoyable.

A fairly short review. I've been playing this game for some 4 hours now. I must say that I love it. I regularly play grand stragtegy games and the like and  I'm constantly on the look out for 'kingdom/empire building games similar to this. I very much enjoy games that provide me with the extreme statistics that this game provides eg many hundeds-thousands-millions-billions-trillions etc. Of said resources. I'm enjoying the style and the UI is fine. 
It's a very simple game but has a lot to offer. It's simple but offers a satisfying amount of depth and/but with little complexity. It's very much a 'click game' as it's title suggests. Being early access I find myself being quite patient and still considering it's pros and cons.
I love the adventurer/hero extention. Gives the kingdom building a more personal/rpg feel.
The game for me is kind of reminiscent of 'kings of dragon pass' which was a totally  wonderful game but I had a few hang ups which I found lacking for the game I wanted to play.

All that being said, I only have a few issues/wishes right now:

1st: I would like the world map to be bigger... MUCH bigger. 
Considering the staggering numbers of people/tropps/resources etc that you can acquire, it would make for a much better kingdom/empire building game we could have a considerably larger world to conquer/explore/trade with.

2nd: Although there is a quite deep research tech tree with many techs to research, I would like it to be bigger/have more options.

3rd: I would like a slightly deeper/more indepth dimplomacy/trade system. Just more options really.

Sadly, that's it for now. Still, great little game.
 I pray that future updates are not just tweaking and bug fixing but expanded content, similar to the above mentioned etc... Keep up the good work.

The aethetic just is very bland to me.  Your civilization is hidden behind the crafting screen which I didn't like, and the early game consists of clicking on just a few resources and managing what your population does.  

Yes, I know this is what all idle games are about.  But I just didn't feel the excitement for IC early game like I did for others such as Adventure Capitalist, which is free btw.  

IC is actually free on Kongregate but the dev will be adding most of the love to the Steam version.  He needs to pay for new music and a few new systems.  

Later on you can build troops and attack npc villages.  This can be a bit exciting until you mis-gauge the strength of the village you're attacking and lose all your troops.  Unlike most online strategy games, IC doesn't tell you the strength of the village you're attacking.  This can lead to frustration as you lose an attack and have to spend another 10 minutes amassing an army again.  

In my opinion, the dev should spend most of the money this game has made on better presentation.  Right now, it looks like a children's coloring book and consists of just a few screens of UI.  The game is only a 17.8 mb file.  

According to steamspy, this game sold pretty well and has a decent player base.  I refunded though because I was just bored throughout.  A bit slow initially building farms and resources buildings.  Also listening to the same music track loop over and over gets tedious.  The dev says he will also be replacing that, which is a great thing.  I just dont think IC is worth 5 bucks unless you enjoy playing these idle games for only 15 minutes at a time while you scan the news feeds.

dieses Spiel ist eine schöne Nebenbeschäftigung. Die Grafik, Musik und das Balancing sind noch ausbaufähig aber das Gamekonzept überzeugt für ein Casual Idle Game.

5 € sind es defenitiv Wert trotz Early Acess.

Was mir besonders gefällt ist, dass selbst nach 15 Stunden noch Dinge im Spiel sind, die man erreichen kann um sein kleines Königreich auszubauen. Erneut past hier das Preis/Lesitungsverhältnis. (Es gibt Vollpreistitel von großen Publishern die innerhalb von 10 Stunden komplett durch sind)

Für leute die High Quality Grafiken/Bilder haben möchten, ist das Spiel aber definitv nichts. Man fühlt sich ein wenig in die 90er zurückversetzt (-; Man merkt, dass vor allem das Augenmerk auf die Mechanik gerichtet wurde. Diese ist wirklich gut gelungen. Ein bisschen wild wirken aber manchmal die Mouseovereffekte und die GUI könnte noch etwas übersichtlicher werden.

Der Musikansatz ist sehr gut. Der Titel ist aber leider viel zu kurz und die Endlosschleife eines so kurzen Musikstückes führt nach Max 10 min dazu, dass der Ton abgeschaltet wird. Hier sollte man dringend etwas nachlegen. Aber es ist ja auch noch Early Acess von daher ertstmal ""gar kein Problem""^^

Dear Developer thanks for this lovly small Game. I enjoy to see my kingdom developing^^ and hope for some good future polishing. Keep up your good work!

-Some menus need work. Why not have all the options (or buttons) on the same screen? No need to scroll, and have giant buttons (plus the scroll is not linked to middle mouse button). Or at least give the user the option to have everything on the same screen. Its Early Access, so this is acceptable at this point, I suppose.
-Like other idle clickers, it doesn't matter what new options do when they open up - JUST CLICK THEM. There is little strategy in early to mid game here.
-I believe it has to be open to earn you stuff. I don't think back-calculates time after you open it up a day later (like [i]AdVenture Capitalist[/i], etc.). This is fine, I guess, its just slightly different.

[b]Yeah totally worth it for me.

There are also a lot of cool features (in our opinion) curently in development, but there are on the their way, features which will drastically (and I do not use the term lightly) alter the game (mostly the end-game).

Will it be fun for you?

That depends on whether you enjoy playing idle games. This does have some more depth than the general idle games you find around, and maybe you will also get a giggle now and then.

It is one of the games you will be able to just let it in the background and work for you, but there will be an urge from time to time to check it out.

Its interesting, ill keep trying it out for funsies.

Edit: btw the soundtrack is fantastic. haha",1448355096,1448355278,True,5,4,0.363579124212265015,0,True,False,True,False,,,
