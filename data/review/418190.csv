The star of the show is the combat system though, and I appreciated how fresh they were able to keep it despite how simple it is. That's the advantage of being a short game. The 4 henchmen of the Demon King were probably the highlight of the whole thing, with their unique realms with gimmicks and puzzles to get to the boss.

I didn't find near all of the secrets, but there were some very cool items. Some of them felt a bit situational, which is a big drawback in a game which has so few actual situations, while some of them felt 100% necessary. I can't imagine fighting the end boss for one without a heal spell.

Some enemy types were just annoying as well. I hated the monkeys, they zip around the levels and the space to avoid them is really limited. You're bound to take a few HP damage off them no matter how fast you dish out DPS, because they have a quick piercing damage attack. They're all but an HP tax on traversal, they may as well replace the monkey enemies with a little poison floor.

Story:

The story starts out simple at first. Helen, a silent protagonist. Which more like a gag really. Anyway, she cannot read. What she wishes for, is to leave the castle and go to the outside world. The person who took her in knows this, and worked to give her that dream. The inhabitants in the castle are experiments that were banished and locked away there.

Their resistance towards her, is out of their concern for their lives and those who live there. You find out about what the person who took her in did, and his regrets. A hero who was blinded by his view, Helen's past a much more. As it draws closer to the end, the game gets pretty intense.

Battle System:

This is an interesting turn based system, it uses something like a wait timer. And along with this, units take action based on who is first to 0. There are spells with various effects, shields, swords, bows, etc. The battles are one on one, but it gets more complex as it the game proceeds. Though, not too much I should say.

Maps:

The maps works like dungeons, and within them there are puzzles and other secrets. This is how you can unlock things.

Note:

After I believe the third layer? Once past a certain point, return to Helen's home, and she will learn to read. This goes into the exploration, as you go and find out about the history. However, you will also be able to learn how to get certain weapons and stuff.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

[spoiler] 海伦的神秘城堡，对配角的刻画总能让人耳目一新。像剑客一样的孤独的骷髅骑士，虽然强壮但憨厚的魔王还被下属集体吐槽，威严丢光光。看似普通的女仆意外的却是镇长并且实力深不可测，力量可能与魔王不相上下，说话语气上更是能压制魔王。魔王的四大天王更是各有各的特点，他们分别是毒，麻痹，暗黑，沉默，毒王嘴巴毒的很， 暗黑的塞拉斯阴沉内向害羞胆小的家伙 （小波奇属性） ， 沉默的布兰德：喜欢安静，独处但意外是个会鼓励别人的人。额外出现了只会睡觉的睡眠之神斯兰帕和又严肃又搞笑的杂役混乱之修玆牛头人。
但主角海伦的刻画，以及因视角显示整个故事都存在多处存在大量的留白。主角一开始不识字，也没有任何对话。所以我们无法得知她的任何心理活动，海伦从头到尾只说了一个嗯字，如果选择直接骑狮鹫离开不去救哥哥，海伦则会完整的说一句：“再见了，不可思议之城” 全篇刻画最成功的角色应该是哥哥。贯穿整个流程中，虽然哥哥出现的篇幅很少，但无处不是哥哥的影子。哥哥与整个城堡的人都有密切的联系，这些联系并没直接呈现，而是藏在对话中供玩家想象。所以为什么说一百个读者就有一百个哈姆雷特，当玩家在游玩的时候必定会自己对这个故事进行创造与解读。可以想象的到，哥哥无时无刻不在关注着海伦的整场冒险，可能他既不想破坏海伦的冒险，又不想让海伦受到危险，像让海伦能自由的去冒险。想给她自由，所以不想过多干预，但因为深爱（关切？不知道用什么词描述这感情比较好）着海伦。如果我们让海伦去初始小屋下的围墙后，然后快速跑出来。就能看到哥哥有在跟踪，能看到每次战斗失败哥哥会为海伦做肉排叮嘱一句趁热吃。然后一言不发就离开了，可见每次哥哥心里肯定有很多想说的吧，无声胜有声。所以用眼睛去说，用耳朵去看，用心去感受，言有尽而意无穷,余意尽在不言中。当然哥哥的关心还体现在整个冒险的各个角落之中。海伦不光受到哥哥伴随从始至终的关爱，还受到城镇居民和魔物的宠爱。就比如和毒天王打的时候有个小细节，虽然海伦中计掉入毒池，状态栏显示中毒。但并没因中毒状态扣血。所以，这毒是假的。在这看似传统的勇者打魔物冒险的传统故事下，其实藏的是一个互相关爱和谐共处的乌托邦。因封印封闭的浮空城堡，内外都不能出入，像不像桃花源、以及老君里的兰溪镇。可能这才是我为什么这么喜欢这部作品的原因吧。因为过多留白，削弱了我们对主角海伦的了解。在海伦初次面对魔王，因看到这个“变态”的装束。海伦害羞的小表情，加上长期封闭，应该是个不谙世事的可爱少女吧。在剧情接近尾声，海伦为了救哥哥义无反顾冲上去与大反派战斗。可见兄妹深厚的感情羁绊与海伦的勇敢（海伦的勇敢应该是经历与城堡众多魔物战斗，以及与魔王、骷髅剑士的考验成长的结果）海伦的离开给哥哥带来的救赎与希望，海伦肯定是带着希望高兴启程的。而哥哥给海伦提供里离开的条件，给予妹妹自由探索和自由选择的权利。（若是我们想留在城堡，只要一开始不出去探险不就永远留在此地了嘛？）正是妹妹通过各种磨练和考验才具备离开的条件，才能打败骷髅剑士并劈开结界。才能凭借自己力量保护哥哥。所以看似没变化的海伦，其实一直在成长着。所以爱不是捆绑，而是放手，让她自己成为自己。所以最后结局海伦如愿离开，但海伦和哥哥却并未分开。因为他们的心已经走到一起。 [/spoiler]",1698112800,1698112800,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

同时，这款游戏的战斗系统是基于回合制基础上的CTB系统，即玩家和敌人每个策略选择均有自己行动独有CD，丰富战斗中针对不同敌人使用不同武器策略性和搭配，不过作为一款小体量的线性JRPG，其最大战斗乐趣只能存在于一周目中，不过在这短短一周目体验中完全足够了。

最后，作为一款同人爱好级游戏，海伦的奇幻城堡的体验是足够优秀，且完美的，如果可以忍受窗口过小或画面老旧这些问题，且有兴趣尝试JRPG，这款游戏你不应该错过。

Helen’s Mysterious Castle is a small-size with very traditional content of linear JRPG from Japan, but it's praised for its fun and very well-developed gameplay .

The game isn't too long, but for a JRPG, an excellent and interesting plot full of delicate emotional expression is a must. Of course, emotional expression is too delicate for players who are used to the plot of European and American RPGs, too childish is a minus point, but this is also one of the most important differences between JRPGs and European and American RPGs, and it is this delicate emotional expression that made the best thing about Helen’s Mysterious Castle.

At the same time, the battle system of this game is based on the turn-based CTB system, that is, the player and the enemy each strategic choice(skill or weapon use) has its own unique CD, enrich the battle against different enemies using different weapons strategy and collocation. As a small-size linear JRPG, though, its maximum combat fun can only exist in the first-time game run, but it's perfectly adequate in this short first-time game run.

At last, as Doujin-level (develop by self only with hobby) game, the experience of Helen's Mysterious Castle is good enough, and perfect, if you can tolerate such issues as small windows or old graphics and still is interested in trying out a JRPG, this is a game you shouldn't miss.

Oyun 18 Mart 2016'da piyasaya sürüldü ve Steam'de son derece olumlu eleştiriler aldı.

Oyun, geçmişi hakkında çok az şey bilen ve kendini gizemli bir kalenin bulunduğu yüzen bir adada mahsur kalmış bulan Helen adlı genç bir kızın hikayesini anlatıyor. Yol boyunca bulduğu çeşitli silahlarla donanmış olan Helen, sırlarını ortaya çıkarmak ve kendi kökenleri hakkında daha fazla şey öğrenmek için canavarlarla savaşmalı ve labirent gibi kaleyi keşfetmelidir.

Oyunun benzersiz özelliklerinden biri, oyuncuların silah toplamasına ve savaş sırasında gerektiğinde bunlar arasında geçiş yapmasına olanak tanıyan bire bir savaş sistemidir. Oyuncular, yenilmiş düşmanlardan topladıkları deneyim puanlarını kullanarak silahları geliştirebilir ve nihai cephaneliği oluşturmak için labirentin içinde gizlenmiş yeni silahlar toplayabilir. Her bir silahı ne zaman kullanacağınızı öğrenmek bu oyunda zaferin anahtarıdır.

Zorlu oynanışına ek olarak Helen's Mysterious Castle, ölümün maceranın sonu olmadığı benzersiz bir mekanik de sunuyor. Helen her öldüğünde, yaşam çizgisini kalıcı olarak artıran sıcak bir yemekle kulübeye geri getirilir ve aksi takdirde yenilmez düşmanların yenilmesi biraz daha kolay hale gelir.

Oyuncular oyunu oynarken bazı aksaklıklar veya en-boy oranı sorunlarıyla karşılaşabilir, ancak bunlar pencereli moda geçerek kolayca düzeltilebilir. Oyunda geleneksel bir seviye atlama sistemi yoktur, ancak öğeler deneyim puanları kullanılarak geliştirilebilir.

Genel olarak Helen's Mysterious Castle, benzersiz bir savaş sistemi ve zorlu oynanışıyla ilgi çekici ve sürükleyici bir RPG macera oyunudur.

やれることといったら北に向かうことだけ、しかしヘレンが北に向かう理由は一切ない。
あれ？これシナリオとかそういうのなくて、ひたすらダンジョンに潜っていくタイプのゲームかな？

戦闘はシンボルエンカウント方式。
仲間などという軟弱なものは一切なし。
こちらも一人、敵も一人、タイマンで死ぬまでどつきあうストロングスタイル。

戦闘システムがこのゲームの面白い所で、単純なターン制ではなく、敵味方全ての武器にカウントが設定されておりそれが0になったら行動開始というシステム。
例えば相手の武器カウントが11でこちらの武器カウントが5の場合、こちらは相手のカウントが0になるまで2回行動することもできるということ。
相手の行動を見た上で、武器の攻撃力防御力カウントを良く考えこちらの行動を選択していことになる。

敵の強さは序盤はクソ雑魚で、こちらが対応を間違えなければほぼ完封できる。
しかし後半になると厄介な連中が増えてきて無傷で勝つのはほぼ無理になる。
さらに一部の敵は、明らかにこちらの武器を見てから自分の武器を選択するという頭脳プレイを見せてくるため対応をミスると死が見える。
このへんがすこしだけ考えるRPG所以だろう。

[u][b]Helen's Mysterious Castle[/b][/u] is an indie turn-based RPG made using some version of RPG Maker. It has beautifully animated sprites and a very unique battle system whereby you and your opponent's turns are based on the ""Wait"" timer of the action that you each choose. This makes for quite tactical combat and is something I've never seen before in a turn-based RPG. That being said, I regrettably can't recommend the game with a clear conscience due to the fact that it has a number of huge problems which frankly make it unplayable for me:
1. The game can either be played on a tiny window which is around the size of a portable game system or ""fullscreen"" which enlarges everything, makes everything blurry, and cuts off a portion of the playing screen.
2. The game doesn't recognize controller inputs for some people at all which may force you to use the awful controls that seem to be default in many RPG Maker games (arrow keys to move and z and x as buttons).
3. The music doesn't work on various Linux distros (beware Linux users!), as well as Windows 8 and Windows 10.

The community appears to have figured out fixes for all three (on Windows only) but they require external programs and downloads which is something that I'm against in general. I also believe that a game should be able to run as intended when you purchase it and that isn't the case with this game whatsoever.

[hr][/hr]
[quote][b]R E V I E W[/b][/quote]

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
The core gameplay loop is like most other turn-based RPGs: explore, fight, explore, fight (at least as far as I've seen). But, as previously mentioned, the main draw is the (beautifully-animated) one-on-one battle system which uses the unique ""Wait"" system. Each piece of equipment that you wield (and each of your opponent's attacks) has a ""Wait"" value and time decrements until the first combatant's ""Wait"" value has reached 0, whereupon they will perform their action and a new action will have to be chosen. Turns then continue based on the remaining and new ""Wait"" values of each combatant.

[h3]Graphics[/h3]
The graphics are either for ants or people who wear bifocals. As mentioned above, the game has a glaring issue where you have to either play on a tiny screen, a blurry and cut-off ""fullscreen"", or use some third-party fix which requires the use of external programs and downloads. The exploration graphics and character portraits are pretty standard for a game made using RPG Maker; however, where the game truly shines is with its fully animated sprites in battle. This is what immediately drew me to the game and you can get a good sample of the beautiful animations in the preview video on Steam's store page.

[h3]Sound[/h3]
The music seems pretty good...but that's only based on what I heard in the preview video. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to hear the music when I played and that really detracted from the first impression that I had of the game as I think music plays a large part in any game since it contributes to the mood, atmosphere, and overall tone of the game.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story is non-existent, at least as far as I played (which was just past the first boss). There was no introductory scenes prior to the title screen, no character or narrator giving you a backstory after starting a new game, nothing. You also get little to nothing when you start the actual game and are immediately expected to wander around into the first dungeon. The only thing you have to go on is the developer's description on the Steam store page which makes me wonder why the developer couldn't have thrown that into the game itself. The main character is also illiterate and a mute which doesn't help with character development or relating to them. The game definitely seems to focus on gameplay over story, making the story the most lacking aspect of the game, but this might not be as big of a deal as I make it seem because I only played for one hour and the story could develop much more after the point that I reached. Nevertheless, having no introduction isn't a great sign for the game as a whole.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Overall, I do not recommend this game whatsoever. You should not be paying for a game which doesn't even work properly, even if it is only 2.00 USD. That being said, it is cheap enough that you could get it anyways if you're willing to put up with the issues or install the fixes (if they're even compatible with your operating system); however, I refunded the game as I don't think that a game in this state should be charging people money.",1674035153,1676376233,False,2,0,0.47552335262298584,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I think this game is difficult. When i tryed to play a couple hours and always died in the same place (sorry i'm noob) Helen, a protagonist and also a loli who will be your main character. There is no hint in this game, you just following the story and beat the enemies. The map is simple and not complicated, but they focus on the enemies build. Their power will make you think a good strategy to beat them. Not just one or two but almost 80% strategy needed. The story also very dramatic. If this get anime adaptation it will be awesome. Explore dungeon and get a right items to beat harder enemies. Quite simple but entertaining also challengic.

Fun twist on JRPG battle mechanics (which have gotten stale as hell), pretty good soundtrack (some stand out more than others), decent Undertale-esque story held back by some sub-par writing and/or translation. All in all definitely more than worth it for the price. It's cheap so pick it up and try it!

[*][b]Graphics:[/b] RPG-Maker, but good! The full ""battle"" sprites are good, the rest is RPG maker decent.
[*][b]Gameplay:[/b] Battle system and ""level"" system is innovative in my opinion. Probably the biggest reason to play the game to be honest. Not super grindy either. Difficulty seems like it's in a good place, but I opted out of what looks like the hardest content.
[*][b]Soundtrack:[/b] Decent overall, some standouts towards the beginning and end.
[*][b]Story:[/b] Not great, the weakest point of the game, but considering the length, not bad either. If the writing and/or translation was better, the game would've gotten more points from me here.

This game is a sort of love letter to RPGs in general. It's a classic RPG that sets itself apart by trimming the fat that usually comes with the genre.

Helen's Mysterious Castle starts off simple, [i] so [/i] simple in fact that it pokes fun at the overused tropes of its own genre. Overly-long dialogue? Not here. Instead, the main character can only reply with ""?"", she isn't even able to read at the beginning.
Drawn-out and tedious battles? Not here either. Though you might have to do a little bit of grinding, the battles are extremely quick.
Complicated mechanics and stats? Nope. The battle system is very easy to understand, but it still manages to be engaging and a little bit strategic in a way.

As you progress, the story really starts to shine. The game can be surprisingly detailed at times, with the town NPCs changing location and having a good few dialogue changes. But at the same time, it never tries to do too much. The game never takes itself too seriously, and it's easy to tell that the developers had a clear vision for it.
And besides a tiny amount of minor oversights (small graphical and translation errors), I still really love this game. The price does not reflect the quality at all.

 [h1]我想说《海伦的神秘城堡》和《废都物语》还有《大海原与大海原》是RM 2000作品中你决不可错过的三部佳作。 [/h1]

 [b]*微量剧透注意* [/b]

《海伦的神秘城堡》（Helen's Mysterious Castle）是一部小巧的RM作品。
你扮演海伦，一个身负谜团的精灵少女展开冒险，遇到各种人和事之后拯救大家。听上去似乎只是很普通的RPG故事，小巧在哪里？
“小”是因为游戏的地图很小，从一端跑到另一端只需两三分钟，如果你经常玩JRPG只需一个下午便能通关。“巧”则是因为游戏的战斗有趣且设置的恰到好处。
游戏的美术素材几乎全来自RPG Maker 2000的RTP。但通过精致的音乐，渐入佳境的剧情和有爱的NPC们将海伦的世界塑造的如此精彩。

[h1] 难度适中的战斗，有趣的魔改版CTB？ [/h1]
[b]You mustn't go near the northern ruins. They're dangerous.[/b]

虽然门口的绿发NPC这么告诫海伦，但你还是会操纵海伦回家拿起武器向北方探索。在机械地打完了第一只史莱姆，来到迷宫拿到盾牌之后，你才会发现游戏在战斗玩法上的巧妙之处。

惊喜产生于什么？对我来说惊喜源自变化，可以是全新的东西，也可以是将本就熟悉的事物经过拓展，让它变的更有趣。
《海伦的神秘城堡》显然是后者，游戏的战斗方式可以理解为CTB（Conditional Turn-based Battle，将人物行为与速度挂钩，通过速度快慢决定人物行为被执行的顺序），如果你玩过《最终幻想10》一定不会感到陌生。
类似的机制在一些RPG作品里也有，以前论坛的一些RM素材整合也有用到CTB的战斗方式。《海伦的神秘城堡》里敌我双方的一切行为都被标注了相应的wait值，只有当wait值清零后才能执行相关动作。

简单来说，如果敌人20ATK的猛击需要12waits来启动，那么在他准备动作的12waits里，海伦完全可以利用手里5waits的高频率武器打出两次攻击之后再进行举盾防御。
游戏里，一切行为的攻防数值增益都会被继承到准备阶段，因此敌人20ATK的猛击会被我们刚执行的25DEF防御完全格挡，哪怕这个格挡只持续6个waits。
了解了速度造成的优劣之后，游戏的战斗就变成了数字上的游戏。你要做的就是合理规划自己的行为，保证敌人出手瞬间自己处于高防御状态，而自己出手时敌人处于不设防的状态。

如果仅仅是通过数值上的加减来控制战斗，显然是不够的的。随着冒险的进行，不论是敌人还是海伦都会获得无视防御的魔法技能。虽然威力可观，但是魔法的长咏唱时间和低防御状态显然是一把双刃剑。

有趣的是，敌人往往会根据玩家的行为采取最优策略。如果你决定开场吟唱高伤害的魔法，敌人一定会立刻使用高频率的攻击让你在完成咏唱前就回到出生地。但如果开场使用持续时间适中的防御技，往往会骗敌人开始毫无防备咏唱高伤害的魔力技...
考虑到游戏内敌人数量有限，且战斗行为是固定的。你只需试探一到两次，在摸清敌人的行为方式后，每次都可以用相同的套路快速战胜对手。

看似会趋于死板的战斗不会持续太久。游戏的节奏很紧凑，基本上装备和能力的更新和敌人的变化频率是一致的，游戏过程因此也不会出现枯燥感。不断获得并尝试新装备，解决新遇到的敌人正是游戏最大的乐趣之一。
游戏里有许多有趣的敌人设计，会假动作的敌人往往在你以为他要防御而开始咏唱魔法时突然使用高伤害的突进技、更有不显示行为，只能通过立绘姿势判断是在咏唱还是防御的敌人、许多的BOSS战所引入的新debuff技让战斗更像是用现有的技能装备进行试错和解谜。

游戏并没有通过反复刷怪来提升等级碾压的绝对可能。获得经验值只能用来升级技能或者武器的效果（不过也很关键），血量的提升只能依靠探索迷宫中的道具或者击败固定流程BOSS。
因此每场BOSS战其实资源都很紧张，往往都以险胜收场，这也算是作者对数值和节奏的把控吧。

[h1]剧情和角色，关于神秘城堡[/h1]
[b]？
you can't read this.[/b]

如果你对着书架进行互动，你一定会看到这段对话。
显然主角海伦是一个文盲，你无法通过查看书籍来获取关于这个世界的信息。所幸周围人说的语言海伦全部能够理解，我们也因此不至错过那些言辞幽默风趣的敌人和充满善意的NPC们了。

如果想要一次游戏完整的了解整个剧情，你需要不错过和亡灵骑士的对话选项，同时在某一次解锁捷径之后触发和绿发NPC的对话，习得阅读的本领。通过翻阅之前迷宫里各处的笔记，结合之前冒险时的不和谐之处，你才能了解海伦所在的世界到底经历了什么。

这个设计是大胆的。当你了解小小世界的全部真相后会感觉这种从零开始的探索给予的反馈是惊喜且感动。但和绿发NPC的对话触发又如此容易错过，错过了就要重头再玩又会有不小的挫败感。

当然即便没有了解过去发生的一切，你也能从主线的碎片中推断出这座城堡过去发生了什么，同时也不影响真结局通关后收获的快乐 —— 毕竟即便学会了阅读，海伦在游戏中也只会用“！”和“？”来和人交流。

This is THE best indie RPG I've ever played, and it's the most unique as well. I loved it! It isn't too long, but I think the developer is charging far too little for how high the quality is. Seriously, $2 for this is a steal.

Pros:
-Fantastic battle system. Each weapon has an Effect (power), Defense, and Wait (use speed) stat. When you select a weapon, shield, or spell, the timer counts down. This timer is for enemy moves as well, and you have to get strategic and use the right equipment at the right time to attack the enemy, block or mitigate damage, or heal.
-Pixel-perfect graphics. It's dripping with SNES beauty and I seriously wish there were more games like this. I got very strong Chrono Trigger vibes from the graphics and animations, as well as some Lufia as well.
-Lovely soundtrack. Each song was fitting and some were outright magnificent, especially some near the end of the game. Plus, the soundtrack is free! ..\steamapps\common\Helen's Mysterious Castle\helen\Gamedeta\Music
-Intriguing story. The story won't win awards, per se, and the start of the story was vague and a bit slow, but I found it to be well-made, often funny, and even touching at times (especially at the end). The writing is quite well done, and the English localization is top-notch. Some of the characters were especially compelling, though the game isn't long enough to really develop them a lot.

Cons:
-No settings. That's right, there's no settings menu. You can't lower the volume, for example, which was a problem for me when streaming on Discord because it was drowning out the voices of my friends and my own.
-Sometimes combat loops can be annoying. There are some particular enemies that loved to use quick, strong attacks 10+ times in a row, which left me using my shield dozens of times just to block damage in hopes that it would finally use a move with a longer charge so I could get an attack in. I wish enemies had a broader moveset so that this wouldn't happen.
-There isn't more of this. This is the only game I'm aware of by Satsu, and it doesn't seem like she's making a sequel to this or another game. That's a shame, because Satsu clearly has a lot of talent, attention to detail, and creativity. If she made another game along these lines, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

Seriously, just buy this game. I genuinely think that if you give it a chance, you won't be disappointed. 9.5/10!",1630459040,1633671849,True,9,0,0.568212211132049561,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Combat is simple, straight-forward, yet very engaging, fast-paced, and fun. Encounters are taken by making contact with overworld sprites like in Lufia. The game never gets grindy, and bosses provide a satisfying challenge without frustrating difficulty.

Progression is linear and the in-game world is rather small. You can expect to finish this in one afternoon or evening, although there are optional challenges such as collecting all the items that may pull you in for longer. The rather short gameplay time doesn't lend much of itself to the story's development, but the plot, while lacking the depth of longer JRPGs, provides enjoyable characters with plenty of moments of light humor.

It’s a well-trimmed adventure with nary a dull moment to speak of.
	This particular RPG is a gameplay-first experience, relying on its combat to drive the player’s engagement. And oh what a combat system this is. This may be one of the absolute best battle systems to grace a turn-based RPG. Each action is determined by the tools in your inventory, with weapons and shields of various types alongside the rare passive buff – buffs which nonetheless occupy space in your precious, limited inventory, thus reducing your options in battle should you choose to carry them. Each ability consumes time on a Wait meter, and you and your opponent each may act only once enough Wait time has passed. The Wait time is not determined by a flat speed stat for your character, but by the speed of the ability itself. A light bow may take only a few ticks, while a devastating magic attack may require a lengthy stint to prepare. Thus, you can’t rely only on your strongest attacks, as they may leave you vulnerable to powerful, quicker blows from your foe. You also have to consider your defense, as the damage you can shrug off is tied to your active ability. And then there are the defense-piercing magic attacks, which place appropriate pressure on fights, as you can’t just bring in a shield strong enough to block everything. Each fight is a delicate balancing act, and with the right planning you could leave an encounter unscathed. But it may also be best to shoulder some damage to dish some out yourself, as a way to whittle a stronger enemy down before they can deliver too many magic attacks you couldn’t interrupt. This balancing act makes the combat compelling, as you nail down the perfect pattern for common foes, and carefully think through and assess the risks in boss encounters. Some bosses felt like puzzles, in which I had to consider unconventional moves to topple them. The difficulty of the main adventure is perhaps a bit on the easy side, inasmuch as it doesn’t fully explore the potential of the combat system in a truly challenging context, but a secret area certainly proves a mightier test of your ability to utilize the mechanics to their fullest.
	If the game does prove too challenging for you at any point, it is quite amenable. You can accept a +1 to your max HP on death (up to a point), a gentle push to keep trying, which isn’t too excessive as to feel like outright pity. And with how you can level up your equipment, there’s always potential to grow a little stronger before the next go. You can also experiment with plenty of weapons, shields, and other items. While the odd weapon will downright outclass another, most do have their strengths and weaknesses, meaning you can find your own playstyle.
	Starting out, the story is almost nonexistent. It picks up steam as the game goes along, and by the end, I was interested in where things were going. The characters are charming, and the writing is rather witty. It’s perhaps not uproariously funny at any point, but it had me laughing quite consistently. I was endeared to this world, especially as its secrets revealed themselves.
	The music is pretty good overall. I feel the choice of instrumentation is somewhat unflattering, as the retro sound font can seem like it’s holding the tunes back in some cases. But it does invoke that 16-bit golden age of RPGs well, and many of the tracks themselves still impress, though some simply sound like standard fantasy RPG fare. It’s a good soundtrack nonetheless, I’d say. It’s certainly fitting to the era the game clearly derives its main inspirations from. In the overworld, you get somewhat typical top-down spritework. It works fine, though on a rare occasion the environment obscured a path unintentionally, either by door placement or by flat color choices. On a related note, though, the game cleverly hides secrets using environmental details and by taking advantage of the top-down camera. Secrets abound in this game, and they’re a delight to track down. Back to the visuals: The battle sprites are phenomenal, as are the accompanying animations. They accentuate the excellent combat by adding a real energy to the action.
	One last thing I wish to note: The climax of this game is absolutely smashing. I won’t spoil, but there are several unique fights in a row, each of which felt like a great but unexpected payoff for the story, as well as being fun fights in their own right, if a little easy. The ending may be a bit underwhelming, but the finale still leaves the game with a strong note to end on. Helen’s Mysterious Castle is a standout title of its genre thanks to its stellar combat, but its other elements are not to be discounted. This is a well-rounded package that I wholeheartedly urge you to try!",1604200494,1604200494,True,2,0,0.533678770065307617,0,True,True,False,False,,,

小攻略:1.经验的作用为升级武器，菜单升级在后面吃升星披萨前只能升到lv9，星级要铁匠（治愈他妻子后，铁匠先是钥匙，过后几次免费升级）
2.丢弃的武器在藏宝库寻找
3.建议优先在铁匠那升星武器，铁剑（若想刺激体验这个可以不升），防御披风，治愈等
4.战斗中后期基本就是剑盾算着来，血少了治愈，行动够雷击（模仿怪雷击lv9秒杀）
部分剧情分析：
[spoiler]  1.关于女主海伦身份: 后面库雷斯透露女主是人造人，由濒死的人造成的魔物，因此女主是特殊的，不能完全定义为人或者魔物，这导致精灵无法检测是人是魔，硬要说也是魔物(游戏中改造人都定义为魔物)，但鉴于有人心，女主和浮空镇上的居民都说是人也不为过（居民不是由濒死之人）
2.勇士:前一代勇士击退魔物大军后死亡，这是一百年后的勇士，扔在做守护人间的工作，看到有被流放的魔物的岛结界破坏便前来肃清浮空岛，本质是内心善良能辩善恶的。
3.支配者：库雷斯，有统治并消灭人界的邪恶之目的，100年前由阿迪斯协助建立魔物军团，100年后自己学习建立兵团前来。
管理者：阿迪斯，最初协助建立魔物军团，但后来心生愧疚，拯救海伦并改善魔物。[/spoiler]",1597745873,1597746143,True,3,0,0.558823525905609131,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I got this game in a bundle with a couple of other RPG maker games. While I was exicted to give it a try, seeing as it is an RPG maker game (which are the type of games I usually like), I just....couldn't get behind this one.

The game begins with you playing as a girl who is named Helen and you got out of your house just for another girl to tell you not to go to the Northern ruins...and then you go anyway. That's the beginning of the game. I feel it just tosses you in and there's no real context for anything really. While I can say that I like the music and the fighting mechanism in the game (though it can be quite repetitive) I don't think that's enough for me to continue playing it. 

But well, I don't know what else to say really. I say I would not recommend it because for me I feel too lost and...pretty bored with how repetitive it can be, to fight enemies, gain experience, upgrade weapons, die by some monster, and repeat.

·战斗相关
本作采用回合制，且角色的培养也与一般的JRPG不同，没有各种眼花缭乱的属性，没有等级的概念，玩家唯一可以提升的角色属性只有血量。打怪不会掉装备或物品，获取的EXP只能升级装备。战斗使用行动点数，可能会劝退一些玩家，但个人还是觉得比较有趣。
·剧情
流程的前半段基本无剧情可言，剧情的爆发主要集中在后半段，越玩越有种拨云见日感。总的而言算不上神作，但也十分优秀，令人印象深刻。
·画面
复古式像素JRPG，可能对没接触过此类游戏的玩家会有点简陋感。
·音乐
音效与音乐都是RM2000的通用素材，但这些BGM本身就已十分优秀，作者也用的恰到好处，游戏里很多画面与BGM的配合简直完美。

If you want to get back into JRPGs, or just want a polished little game to pour a few hours into, then HMC is a great pick.

Going into more detail, Helen's Mysterious Castle is an RPGmaker game that uses modified versions of the basic RPG maker toolkit to make a unique story and a gorgeous battle system. Don't be fooled by my playtime; The main story, from start to finish, should take somewhere between five and eight hours, with an extra hour or two for the bonus content/secrets. The game follows Helen, a classic mute amnesiac protagonist, as she explores the titular castle. 

The story is nothing spectacular, but it's there for those who want it and it's fairly lighthearted, save for a few moments in between. I personally enjoyed it, and it got me back into the storytelling mood enough to tackle the next JRPG on my list. They also successfully implement some world changes as the game goes on, which makes what you're doing feel like it has an impact.

The music is fantastic, honestly. My only qualm is that it's way too loud, and I never did find a way to turn it down, so I often just muted my computer. It's a shame, because the songs really are great - invigorating, suiting the situation, and with enough emotion to immerse yourself. If you can, give yourself a chance to enjoy the variety of music - they're all well-polished.

My favourite part of the game - the combat system. This is what sets Helen's Mysterious Castle apart from the other JRPGs and RPG maker games that float around steam, and make it well worth the money it's asking. The combat system is a time-based wait system that is incredibly smooth and which they take full advantage of. There are tons of unique bosses which have interesting animations and difficult boss battles - honestly, I'd relate them to puzzles in how complex they can be. You can't button mash this to win, and it feels good to play. I don't want to spoil too much, but it's definitely the highlight of the whole game for me. It's smoother than almost any combat system out there, and it makes you think. The enemies actually react to how you're fighting them, and every boss has a unique method of fighting back. They've used tons of unique ideas for the battle system to make the gameplay dynamic. I just... I just love it. If anything should be the deciding factor, this is it.

As a final note, a lot of the graphics are based on or retrieved from the RPG maker kit. However, don't let that put you off. The animations are smooth, the characters are well designed, and the pixel art is clear and easy on the eyes. While it isn't anything particularly special, I'm a huge fan of the smooth battle animations and how they implemented what they had available. It's genuinely quite pretty.

If I'm to rank this game in the star system... I'd say 4/5. It's really, really solid for an RPG maker game. The core gameplay is polished and lots of fun. It's not winning any awards for the art or story, but they're easy on the eyes and don't get in the way of the battles. The music weaves itself into the rest of the game seamlessly. I had plenty of fun with it, and as long as you're willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, I think anyone can get some enjoyment out of this.

As a post-note, I realized halfway through writing this that there was something I forgot to mention about the gameplay. The overworld has lots of secrets which are fairly easy to find simply by walking against walls and looking for transparency, but at one point a main path is hidden and I got stuck there for a short while before I started searching for secrets. It might trip some people up, but since it's just the one place, I didn't include it in the judgement of the game.

I bought this game a few years ago, and just let it sit in my library, collecting dust. I'm not even sure what made me play it, but I'm glad I did. 

This game is definitely one of the more unique RPGs using one of the RPGMaker engines. It's almost a Souls-lite type of game. 

You are encouraged to beat your head against enemies in battle, while usually dying repeatedly, until you learn their patterns and behaviors. It gives a level of satisfaction of beating an enemy and conquering a floor I haven't felt felt in quite a while. You are never penalized for dying, aside from having to return to where you were killing/avoiding monsters again along the way. Dying is just a part of the experience as you learn strategies for taking on all of the games enemies and bosses. 

The presentation of the game is quite nice to look at too. Not the best I've seen out of an RPGMaker engine, but certainly not one of the worst I've seen either. The environments are nice to look at and clean. And the sprite work, especially Helen, is actually really good and adds character to a literal silent protagonist. 

The music is also really pleasant. I especially love the music used on the second floor of the castle. The incidental sound effects are alright. Not bad, but nothing amazing either. They do their job effectively, and in the end you can't really ask for much more. 

The story... that one surprised me. Going into the game, and within the first few minutes of playing, I expected there to be virtually nothing. Just killing baddies until I found some nameless evil, or other derivative reason, at the top for doing everything that I had done in the game up until that point. Basically that is exactly what happened, but the reasons, the motivations of everything behind the scenes was actually a lot more impactful than I expected. Point is, there is very little story here, but what is here is actually really good and you might be surprised by a few things by the end of the experience.

There are a few nitpicks though. For one, the controls are a bit sloppy. I don't know if it's a limitation of the engine, but this game does not play well with an analog stick. You'll be begging to use your D-Pad for moment within a few minutes of the game as you are trying to navigate the castle, and you can't (or at least not with third party software perhaps.)

The game can be a little convoluted with explanations, too. It is a bit challenging to describe any specific situations without taking away the experience of the game, but suffice it to say you will have to explore around and talk to everyone to learn everything there is to do in this game. While that is certainly not a bad thing, some important and otherwise helpful things in this game can be a bit too easily missed.

All in all, this is a fantastic little half dozen or so hour RPGMaker title that definitely deserves a play through or two.",1590489046,1590489046,True,0,1,0.45649072527885437,0,True,False,False,False,,,

無料版は未経験、他関連作もまったく知らずの状態でプレイ。

システム周りの話としては、戦闘はタイムカウントによる武器や魔法での殴り合い。各装備品には「威力・守備・特殊技能」という能力値と使用時間が設定されており、それを活用していく形。実際にプレイしてみると、そこまで考えなくてもいいがまったく考えずに戦うと負けるという「すこしだけ考える」の名が非常に適当なバランス感覚になっていました。すげえ。
ボスもちゃんと（実質的なレベル上げであるところの）武器強化をした上で戦闘中に対策を練りつつ殴っていく必要があるのも良質なRPGって感じで好印象。経験値稼ぎも対策さえできていれば楽々で良い。

で、肝心のシナリオですが、これはもうめちゃくちゃ良い。良すぎました。最高です。
ただラストあたりに関しては王道的かつ平凡だったので、最高だと言ったのはそこではない。最高だと感じた部分は、作品中盤にあるのです。

ふしぎの城を探索し、奥へ奥へと進んでいく中で主人公は「古き良きRPGのラスボス」たる存在を打倒する。町の住民は喜び、長はよくやったと微笑む。確かに強い敵だった。恐ろしい相手だった――
――故にこそ。お前はこの先に進むことが許される。
開ける道。暗い階段を抜けた先には、一面の「青空」――今まで見たことのなかった空という概念、すなわちそれは異界の風景。”遥かなるニライカナイ”へと物語は広がっていく――

この場面が、五回来て五回とも鳥肌立ちました。グラフィックと曲が噛み合いすぎて最高でした。ここまでキマってる演出はなかなか無いと思います。最高です。

Мы играем за девочку-эльфийку Хэлен, у которой так и чешутся руки (а вместе с ними и лук, и меч, и куча другого оружия) исследовать замок неподалеку. В подземельях замка нас встречают разномастные монстры, у каждого из которых определенный паттерн ведения боя и последовательности атак. Боевую систему вкратце можно описать так: сложность в простоте. Мы обладаем разными видами оружия, такими как луки, мечи, щиты, магия и всякие плюхи. Бой пошаговый, и каждое действие занимает время, т.е. система построена на правильном подборе оружия в нужный момент, однако ахтунг! - монстры могут ответить вам той же монетой. Этим система крайне занимательна: к мобам, конечно, быстро привыкаешь, как только просечешь их комбинации, а вот некоторые боссы могут заставить попыхтеть и потребовать особой тактики. При этом игра не суперсложная, это не хардкор рпэга для азиатских умов, а абсолютно проходимая игра для обывателя.

При всей интересности боевки, в игре также присутствует сюжет, который грамотно раскрывается по ходу повествования, и сопровождается таким количеством забавных и интересных диалогов, которого вот прям в самый раз. Не много, чтобы заскучать, но и не мало, чтобы сюжет был задвинут на заднюю полку и иногда лишь грустно выглядывал оттуда. Как уже сказали ораторы до меня, почти с самого начала витает ощущение, что что-то не так, и чем дальше проходишь, тем больше ты такой «а я чуял, я знааааал».

У меня прохождение заняло 10 часов, но уверена, игру можно пройти и быстрее, если не искать проходы ко всем потайным комнаткам и не болтать с каждым персонажем на локации в ожидании смешного ответа. Но, с другой стороны, в этом сок. :) 
По итогу, Helen's Mysterious Castle для меня – это игра, от которой я при первом запуске не ожидала многого, но осталась крайне довольна. Игра стоит дешевле чашки кофе/пачки сигарет, поэтому искренне рекомендую отказаться разок от вышеуказанного на выбор и добавить ее к себе в библиотеку. :)",1578769527,1588007823,True,5,0,0.590974867343902588,0,True,False,False,False,,,

gameplay
gameplay looks like a dragon quest/final fantasy battle but there is alot more going on. there are 3 main things you need to watch speed, defense, and attack. attack and defense work together like one would think. attack is how much hp you remove and defense will lessen that damage. EX: your sword has 10A but the opponent uses a shield with 6D so you remove 4HP but magic will ignore defense so keep that in mind. one last thing to note is defense moves raise your defense for the duration of the move. now for speed: each attack takes x time to perform x=speed. you will not know the first move an enemy makes but this can be a good thing as it means you go first. say if they are doing a 5S move and you do a 5S move you will do your move and still get to pick your next move before they do theirs.
Levels: you do get xp though you do not level instead you level your items. each item (but 1 that is double forged only) can level to 9 but after that can be reforged it by going to the blacksmith (you must kill 15 enemies after each forge) or by you if you eat a steak after you have 100HP (this lets you forge for 99xp).

And so it was. At least, at first, it seemed that way. The game starts off as innocuously as possible, and with poor translation and obscure controls (arrow keys, Shift to run, Z and X buttons), I couldn't help but think I had been swindled. But I figured, let's see how far the ruse goes.

?

Oh yes, it was in fact a ruse - a grand one, indeed. For by the time you play your first few battles, one quickly gets swept away by the combat system and its simple intricacies, and you find yourself as puzzled as you are enriched. 

It takes time for the game to develop beyond its humble beginning, but the plot builds, the gameplay develops, the music grows, and the true majesty of the very best $2 you ever spent on Steam becomes obvious.

I will spoil no more. Enter the Mysterious Castle, discover your delight at the clever game mechanics, and enjoy being carried away by the whimsical story, all easily accomplished within a weekend of play.

I don't really have anything to criticize, so I'll list the things that struck me the most.

- The battle system is amazing and so much fun. 1vs1 fights on which you have to really plan your moves. During your travel through the castle you get a LOT of weapons and some passive equipment, you can only have up to 8 at a time on Helen, but there is a zone with a guy that keeps everything you have picked before, so you can switch them without a problem. 

The EXP you get from defeating enemies goes to lvling your weapons and not the character, which only gets more HP mostly by advancing the story. Anyway, this gives a lot of room to try new tactics or even self imposed challenges, though I think most people will end up using similar equipment, once you get the hang of it, it's easy to know what are the best of a certain type. 

- I quite liked the story, you start without knowing anything, Helen doesn't even talk haha. Thanks to the meetings with the others and your own actions you will understand what's going on. All the main characters are truly charming.

- Finally the music, I possibly liked every tune, and it complemented perfectly the above points. Made boss battles thrilling, some story moments touching and even exploring areas fun.


Keep in mind that it's a short game, the last save of my first playtrough says 5h 23m, and that's without all the reloading, I simply refused to lose and spawn with a delicious steak. 

On my second, which I played after finishing another game, it says 3h 29m, and this time I tackled the extra dungeon, it was very good btw, seriously, what a twist.

In any case, I'm left quite satisfied, I could totally play it again by my own rules and make it more difficult just for the fun of it.

You know that feeling when you're at work and you really want to do something back home so you keep thinking about that thing until work time is over and you sprint home to do it? That thing was [b][i]Helen's Mysterious Castle[/i][/b] for me.

The adventure begins with Helen, a character who can't read and only says ""!"" or ""?"", who runs off into the Northern Ruins despite her brother saying it's dangerous and to beware of the ruins. Story starts off simple enough but there are many surprises awaiting as the adventure continues. The game itself is very short but the story is engaging and enjoyable.

The gameplay is interesting and will have you pondering over the actions you choose to take in hopes of achieving the best outcome. Basically, there's a wait bar for both the player's turn and the enemy's turn and each ability has a number of turns to wait on before the ability can be unleashed. If you use an attack that waits on 13 turns and the enemy uses an attack that only waits on 5 turns then the enemy will be able to attack you first and again if they choose to repeat that action, same vice versa. Some of the strongest or most useful abilities require a lot of waits so its best to plan out your actions beforehand. It may sound a little complex but it's really easy to get the hang of when playing, and it's fun to switch out different weapons and abilities to defend, attack, and become an unstoppable force.

I actually didn't think much on the art or characters before I bought the game, but I grew to appreciate them more as the game proceeded. The characters are fun to talk to and made me laugh a lot. The music was also enjoyable for what it was and fitted the mood of some scenes very well, like the scenes with the brother. Honestly, I can see myself listening to some tracks for relaxation sometimes.

I didn't find any problems with the game really and had fun traversing the world with Helen [spoiler](I liked seeing Ahriman being used in the bonus dungeon as I was studying some Zoroastrianism around the time I was playing this game)[/spoiler].

It might've been during the JRPG kick I went on after playing Trails in the Sky. I was intrigued by the title, being a consummate D&D player, and the idea of exploring a mysterious castle piqued my curiosity, as well as did the unusual connotations (by lack thereof) of the titular mononym, Helen. Is she a witch? A ruler? An adventurer? The name itself gave few clues. I clicked on it and read the synopsis and top reviews. Huh. Seems kinda cool. Then I watched the video. Memories in me stirred, and I got a feeling that was something like kneeling down to uncover something noticed half-buried in the sand on a windy beach, and discovering what you've found may be more than what you expected. It was very cheap, so I purchased it with little hesitation. As I began playing, a rush of nostalgia flooded me with the memories of playing Link's Awakening on my Game Boy Original, squeezing in those last few precious minutes before bedtime, agonizing over exactly what the hell I was supposed to do with that fishing hook. It was a lot like the feeling of getting out of school and running home with fingers crossed that I wouldn't miss the newest episode of Pokemon, getting there just in time to catch the opening theme song. There was a magic in these moments that's extremely difficult to recapture, even just for fleeting moments. But for me, that's what this game does. The music is fantastic; the backdrops, evocative (a personal favorite of mine is when the sun begins to set on the castle).  

  Also it has, along with Trails in the Sky, my favorite combat system out of any JRPG I've ever played. Each weapon has a certain amount of time or ""wait"" associated with it. You know what attack the enemy is going to use and how much wait there is left until his attack. Say the enemy uses an attack with 15 ticks. You have time for 3 shots of your bow or one swing of your sword, or you could use your shield for 20 ticks and start again 5 ticks into his next attack, on the chance that he may use a slower one, giving you more time to charge up a longer (and more powerful) attack.

  The storyline is minimalist, with very little dialogue (the main character is mute), but the dialogue that's there is peppered with light-hearted humor, striking a balance between drama and comedy. 

All-in-all, this is one of the games I find myself revisiting every now and again, just to hear the music and bask in the ambience of days gone by. It's not a long game and is perfect for relaxing on a Sunday afternoon. I'm always on the lookout for more games like this, and I've found a few, but this is one of my favorites.

Using the passage of time and a knowledge of your opponents, you can quickly bring

Upgrade weapons using experience points gathered from defeated enemies, collect new 
weapons hidden within the labyrinth, and build the perfect arsenal.

Equip and upgrade weapons of all shapes and sizes, from bows and shields to broadswords 
and devastating magic spells. Learning when to use each weapon is the ultimate key to victory.

""Quote from the Developer"" :o

This indie game was designed to make you think, just a little bit. Players have to figure out the answers for themselves, but the game isn’t meant to be overly complex. Anyone who’s tired of either games that are simply too complicated or conversely having their hand being held throughout the game might have something to take away from this title. Because this indie game was originally made so most people could play through it without too much trouble, I’ve added a trickier bonus dungeon for those playing the English version, who I assume will be more ‘core’ in what they’re looking for. And if that isn’t enough, there’s one more interesting surprise waiting for you...

It's not often you get to play as mute, illiterate elf in a game, but damn if this game doesn't make it FUN. In Helen's Mysterious Castle you play, well, Helen. an elven girl who disobeys her brother and goes directly into the ruins she was specifically told [b]NOT[/b] to go into.

And...that's pretty much the story. Ok, ok, there's a more to it, but the game has no intro; a rarity for RPG Maker games of [i]any[/i] calibur, but it’s also somewhat refreshing. It leaves it on the player to do the exploration and discovery. Another odd choice is that the developer chose to make nearly everything unreadable because...well...Helen can’t [i]read[/i].

This changes later on in the game, and I’m not sure if it was done intentionally to encourage backtracking for secrets and the like, but when I streamed it, we all found it hilarious that a mute elf who couldn’t read was breaking into monster’s homes, killing them for loot, and leaving their children orphaned.

A very unique (and wonderful) thing about the game is the combat. Deceptively simple, it relies on power, defense, and wait times to make your attacks effective. Just...be prepared to do a lot of math. If your attack takes longer than an enemy, they obviously will strike first. If your defense is more than their attack, you take no damage, and vice versa. If you both time it so you would attack at the same time, the game thankfully defaults to the player in every [b]tie[/b]. So be sure to time your attacks well.

While I love the game, there was one annoying aspect I was [b][i]not[/i][/b] a fan of: the leveling system. Instead of XP being used to level your character, you use it to level [i]items[/i]. That’s all fine and dandy, but the only way to increase your health is to...well...die. There are health increasing items you can find, but for any substantial gains you need to die. A lot. To me that feels like counter-intuitive gameplay.

+Wonderful, Unique Combat System
+Excellent story that unfolds at a good pace as you play
+Being illiterate can be fun!

=No clue what enemies will start off with in combat
=Combat can get grindy with lots of blocking
=No intro

-No 'Leveling'. XP is used to beef up items
-Easy to get locked into a certain strat, no matter what you're facing.

El lo que respecta ala jugabilidad es bastante sencilla. Solo controlas a un personaje y no hay demasiados elementos que compliquen el combate. Solo con tres parametros consigue crear un combate fluido pero a la vez simple sin llegar a aburrir. A eso debe sumarse que los combates no son aleatorios por lo que es muy raro entrar en batallas indeseadas y contando con que el juego tomarà unas 10 horas si es que te lo tomas con calma y descubres todos los secretos, no te da tiempo de aburrirte.

En lo narrativo mi  única queja es el uso de la amnesia el pricipio de la historia. Pero aunque al principio de la impresiòn de que no tiene historia en realidad esta misma es bastante interesante y logra construirse en un entorno muy reducido pero aprovecha al maximo el poco tiempo del que dispone para construir los personajes y el pequeño mundo en el que trascurre.

从某种意义上而言，和我今年最喜欢的游戏之一的 Fortune-499 很相似，有一个挺 neat 的系统，点到好处不过多扩展，有着不宏大、不复杂又能让你会心一笑的情节，从各处都能体会到小作者的辛劳与爱。是那种让我稍微有点想做游戏的游戏。

其中回合轮次系统我没有在别处见过，不知是否有先例。一种近似于 ATB 与 AP 结合的系统，但时间不是被动的因素，打架在于从敌人身上依据自身装备找有效输出 loop。敌人同样也会这么做。很有趣味。虽然这个系统的延展性不佳，但在这个精巧短小的框架下恰到好处，不让人厌烦。同样与 499 有些相似的地方是，战斗因此比起 RPG 更像解谜。也是据此，我第一次觉得加法运算攻防伤害不是纯粹弱智。

Eine Zusammenfassung gibt es wie immer unten :D

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Die [b]Dungeons[/b] sind an die klassischen RPGs wie beispielsweise Lufia2 angelehnt. Folglich gibt es in Dungeons allerlei Geheimnisse zu entdecken und Rätsel zu lösen. Nicht selten kommt man erst durch einen Geheimgang wirklich weiter oder muss ein Rätsel lösen. Auch Schätze gibt es allei zu finden. Meist sind dies Waffen, die man bis zu zehn Mal upgraden kann.

[b]Die Heldin kann nicht im Level aufsteigen oder eigenständig Skills lernen wie in RPGs üblich.[/b] Daher hängen ihre Kampffertigkeiten völlig von den [b]bis zu acht Items[/b] ab, die man überall finden kann. Wenn man bereits acht hat und ein anderes findet, muss man ein getragenes wegwerfen. Dieses kann man dann in einem speziellen Raum wieder aufnehmen. Seinen Level behält das Item hierbei. 
Wie bereits erwähnt können diese Aufgelevelt werden. Das erfolgt durch die gewonnene Erfahrung aus Kämpfen. 
Hierdurch erhöht sich entweder der deffensivwert von Waffen oder Schilden oder es verringert sich die Wartezeit bis zum Einsatz. Das hängt vom Item ab, das man aufwertet.

Sollte man ein Mal einen Kampf verlieren, heißt es nicht direkt Game Over. Man landet entweder im Bett bei sich daheim oder im INN und kann auf dem Weg zum Neuversuch noch ein Paar EXP sammeln.

[h1]Soundtrack,Grafik[/h1]
Der Soundtrack ist durchweg hörenswert und passt zum Spiel.
Die Grafik ist im Stil des RTP des RM2k gehalten. Allerdings wurden viele Elemente nachträglich hinzugefügt, ohne dass diese einen Stilbruch auslösen. 

[h1]Zusammenfassung[/h1]
[b]Pro:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Kämpfe mit taktischem Tiefgang
    [*]Dungeons sind durchweg gelungen
    [*]Klasse Optik und Soundtrack
    [*]kein wirkliches Game Over nach Niederlage

[b]Kontra:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Das Steak, das man bei einer Niederlage bekommt und das die maximalen HP steigern soll, funktioniert nicht richtig.
    [*]Story etwas schwach
[/list]

[b]Fazit[/b]
Helens Mysterious Castle ist ein Spiel, das sich an Fans klassischer RPGs richtet, ohne grafisch schwach zu sein.
Das Gameplay ist generell recht frustfrei gehalten, ohne dass die Kämpfe zu lasch wirken.
Wer sich von der RTP Optik nicht abschrecken lässt, findet hier eine echte Perle von Spiel und das für lausige 1.99€.

(Yes, that's an odd thing to me to have the title of the game in the window be 'Untitled', but just a little thing I find funny.)

Overall, this is a great game, and not a bad buy at full price, even better at a discount (I got it at 40% off). There are issues many that make this game one I'd not recommend to everyone, but to the RPG veterans that are looking for both a challenge and some comic relief, you'll find both here.

Now, the following are things I find to be issues, mostly minor and nothing game breaking.

Translation is less than perfect, spelling / grammar / context errors:
I've found a few of these here and there, nothing major and definitely not an issue for most to know what was intended to be said, but they are present nonetheless. (not bad for English not being my first language)

Pots:
Cool, we can smash shit. Be better if they respawned, or if more pots had stuff in them. Actually, about the only cool thing about this is the fact that smashing a pot makes a nice crunchy sound.

Eight Equip/Skill Slots:
That snuck up on me, having to discard a weapon to pick up something new. It definitely limits what one can do, so this actually ramps the difficulty up quite a bit for casual players (I picked the game up and expected a casual style of play).

Running Jokes Everywhere, So have a Steak!
(where does all the steak come from?)
Much less a gripe, than just always being there; always something silly happening at least once on the next screen. Kinda breaks game immersion a little.

Helen Can't Read... -_-
That actually really makes the game harder to get into, because reading everything possible is what helps one to learn about the lore. It isn't until one reaches the town that one learns a tiny bit about the lore.

Castle? What Castle?
Starting off, it's the northern ruins, and then the NPCs discuss things that talk about floors as if the whole thing is the castle, the oddest one I've ever seen then!

Now, onto what makes this game great:
The Battle System...
Okay, it's basic TTB (Timer Turn Battle) stuff, but I don't see too many of those anymore. One can plan ahead and never take damage, or take very little, but then there's always the defense ignoring crap that takes 20-50% HP.

Skill XP
Actually, it's both great and a bit flawed. But the benefits for cost is the main thing; I'd tweak it just a little bit, but overall, it's the best I've seen implemented aside from the one in the Deadly Sin games and Skyborn.

Music
Not much to say here; all the pieces fit together well (some don't properly loop but that could be by design).

Sprinting
It helps in a pinch, definitely. Though, truth be told, one doesn't sprint far before bumping into something. Ah well.

Silly NPCs
As much as it can be annoying (at times), it does keep things light-hearted, and I do believe, yes, that is part of the point.

Graphics
Hey! I love retro gaming! The graphics work just fine for me! The aesthetic is well-achieved here!

Rest Points/Save Anywhere
It's a good thing when you need to heal, and save after a run-in with some strong enemy.

Story
It's one of those (so it seems anyway) piece-it-together-yourself kind of stories, but even though there's not a whole lot of interaction along the way, one does get vague hints from NPCs (as well as game-breaking advice at times), that can help the process along.

Minimalista en muchos sentidos. Escasos diálogos, no ítems, no monedas, no introducción, no subes niveles, no compañeros, etc. Ni siquiera hay un menú como tal. El gameplay es sorprendentemente bueno para lo poco que parece ofrecer. La estrategia consiste en elegir bien tus armas para cada enemigo, e irlas mejorando a base de farmeo y puntos. Cada batalla es un puzzle en sí mismo.
Es adictivo, y es increíble el jugo que se le puede sacar a las batallas 1 vs 1.

PROS:
*Verdadera estrategia para sobrevivir a los calabozos.
*Variedad de enemigos, cada uno con una estrategia diferente.
*No hay encuentros aleatorios.
*Sistema original que se entiende bastante rápido.
*Adictivo, no cuesta trabajo farmear.
*Veloz en todo sentido, las batallas son muy rápidas.
*Casi no pesa el juego.

CONTRAS:
*Historia vaga, sin mucha importancia, y que sólo toma ligera preponderancia después de la mitad del juego.
*Poca exploración.
*Escaso sidequest.
*Duración relativamente breve.
*Es RPG Maker...

The main strength of the game is, in my opinion, the battle system. It's certainly well thought out and makes even random encounters interesting. It's both very simple and deep. Each weapon/magic has damage, defense and wait values, which determines how it's going to interact with the enemy's own attack, which has its own damage, defense and wait value. Making it so you will need to think well of what to use against each kind of enemy. Some enemies are also ""smarter"" than others, and will exploit the openings of your attacks. Having enemies behaving differently depending on your actions really adds some spice to the game and I wished other games would do the same. Most bosses are also pretty interesting, having an unique moveset or strategy that makes their fights feel special (though only a handful of them are actually challenging). The level design is also very praise worthy. There's plenty of secrets and I saw myself looking around every corner when I encountered a new area.

Now the main shortcoming of the game is the story, I think. Everything feels kind of barebones, as if just to say there's a story, and keeps changing in tone through most of the game (suddenly the intense encounter becomes a comedic moment... for the 3rd time). It becomes sort of interesting once it picks up, though, with lot of ""climax"" moments by the ending (I quite enjoyed the ending at least).

The visuals are consistent enough. I really liked the combat sprites myself. The sound also never gets in the way of the game and fits nicely (nothing turns me off more than a repetitive and annoying battle music).

The game isn't particularly long, but it's actually longer than you'd expect from the price range. Meanwhile I left plenty satisfied and made me feel like playing it again some other time (I'd also be really interested in more games with a similar battle system).",1528379685,1528379685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Helen's Mysterious Castle spielte sich etwas anders, als ich erwartet habe. Hinter der niedlichen Fassade verbirgt sich ein kleines, kampflastiges Rollenspiel. Die Kämpfe machen Laune, sie sind aber auch oft ziemlich knackig. An dieser Stelle ein kleiner Tipp: Man kann seine Waffen im Inventar durch Erfahrungspunkte verbessern, später auch beim Schmied.

Das Kampfystem basiert auf Aktionspunkten. Ein Schlag mit dem Breitschwert benötigt z.B. 14 ""Züge"", ein Schuss mit dem Langbogen nur 5. Dafür haut das Breitschwert viel stärker rein und bringt starke defensive Boni. Ein Zauber macht am meisten Schaden, dafür dauert es ewig, bis er ausgeführt ist und man hat währenddessen keinerlei Verteidigung. Das ganze wirkt dann wie ein kleines Schachspiel, denn der Gegner kontert die eigenen Züge. Man wirkt zu Beginn einen Zauber? Dann greift er eben mit seinem Schwert an und verursacht jedes mal vollen Schaden, weil man ja keinerlei Verteidigung hat. Also nutzt man z.B. am Anfang einen Bogen, damit der Gegner den Schild rausholt und wirkt dann einen Zauber, der die Verteidigung durchdringt. => Da der Bogen weniger Aktionspunkte verbraucht, als der Schild des Gegners, hält er also noch ein Weilchen den Schild hoch, während man in Ruhe zaubern kann. So hat man einen kleinen Vorteil.

Da das Spiel sehr kampflastig ist, hält es sich nicht sehr mit der Erzählung einer Story auf. Klar, es gibt sie und sie ist auch nicht schlecht, aber sie tritt bei dem Spiel doch in den Hintergrund. Zur Story selbst möchte ich nichts sagen, da ich nicht spoilern will.

Um im Spiel voranzukommen, ist es manchmal notwendig, kleinere Rätsel zu lösen oder verborgene Pfade (in Wänden o.ä.) zu finden. An einer Stelle artete es leider ziemlich aus, den Pfad zu finden.

In ca. 6-7 Stunden hat man dann jedenfalls alle Kämpfe bestritten, alle verborgenen Pfade entdeckt und kann sich im Abspann darüber Gedanken machen, was für ein wunderbares, kleines Spiel Helen's Mysterious Castle doch ist. Denn es spielt sich sehr kurzweilig und wunderbar anders, als die Stardard-RPG-Maker-Spiele.

First off, the game drops to like 10fps when you full screen. There is a workaround for it, but I shouldn't have to do so and I've played other games using the same engine version without this problem.

Secondly, the controls. I have a Dual Shock 3 and it sets my left stick as the movement. This along with the fact that the game is only 4 way directional and your character runs everywhere they go makes even navigating the game world a chore. All too often I pass up my destination by a tile or two or it detects slight movement in an adjacent direction. This means when I'm holding right but move it even slightly up, it will now register as only 'up' being pressed since there's no diagonals. The worst part about it all is that there's no key or button binding options at all and users will have to resort to external solutions a second time just to make the game tolerable.

This is all a real pity because of what I did play, the battle system looks well thought out. The graphics are great even if the sprites are a bit small in-battle, but they are well animated. The extreme briefness of the intro is right up my alley. All of this means nothing though if the base controls and display have to be modified outside the game program making for a frustrating and inconvenient experience for most.",1511461503,1511461610,False,0,1,0,2,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is quite nice - and rather short. Is this a negative? I am not quite sure due to the battle system. I am not quite sure if I would have enjoyed it that much when it would be double the length. The game mechanic does a nice twist to the common turn-based RPG battle system. Every attack (determined by the weapon you choose every turn, you will have a handful like some game series heroes) will take some time to do - leaving you open or defending you the time doing so. The same goes for your enemies. Knowing when to strike, when to defend is crucial. Sounds nice, works nice but can get stale over the time.

The story isn't that big of an impact - though it is nice to experience (similar to a bed time story. You enjoy it, maybe learn a thing or two, and can move on.)

The combat is turn-based and single party and uses a ""tick"" system which gives it some tactical chops but can become repetitive since it's mostly about finding the winning pattern for a certain type of enemy and then repeating when you come across the same enemy again.  Boss fights are mostly well-done and require some planning.  Thankfully, the game is short enough to avoid becoming too repetitive (around 5 hours or so) and the difficult scales well until the last area of the game, which is mercifully short.  A big plus for being able to see enemies on the map so you can avoid them when you feel like it.

The dungeon design was much better than I expected from a $1.99 RPGMaker game.  There's some clever hidden paths and shortcuts and dungeons are more than a series of connected hallways.  The only downside to dying is being booted out of a dungeon, though your character moves quickly and it's easy to get back to where you left off, so you don't have to worry about lost progress to a fight gone bad.  You can also save everywhere and that always rules.

Helen doesn't level up, but you get experience that you can put toward leveling items and they serve as the primary means of doing damage, avoiding damage and healing.  This is also the rare game that makes a good case for a limited inventory, since all the items you find can be useful.  It's nice to play a game where treasure chests aren't random crafting garbage or ""sword you already have+1"".  There's even a neat little treasure room set-up that makes dropping and reacquiring items simple and easy.  It's a surprisingly smart system where there's a room filled with chests you've found throughout the game.  Drop an item anywhere and it reappears here if you want to pick it up again.  It's simple and useful and I can't understand why more games wouldn't use such a method to keep track of treasure.

Story is pretty minimal until the last part of the game and is bland and generic for the most part.  Being bland and generic is okay when there's not much talking and most of it is light and comedic but once ""cut-scenes"" start being more than about a couple of exchanges long, the mostly mediocre writing becomes annoying and you're just skimming dialogue.  That said, for the most part it's okay in a bland way and can be somewhat humorous at times.

On the downside, there's the typical RPGMaker clunk.   You can't customize controls without third-party software, can't change the level of in-game music (it's really loud at low universal computer settings), the controls when moving around are kind of stiff and event flags can be kind of finicky at triggering.  There's one area in particular when I had to ""sit"" on a chair next to a table to trigger an event, which I didn't realize you could do since I figured the chair was a a solid object.  I figured out what to do after a while but there's a few areas of the game that have this ""I know what to do, but I can't quite figure out how to trigger it"" problem.

There's also a bizarre widespread bug where you have to enter a double door building by the right door instead of the left one, otherwise the game will crash.  This is really annoying since it happens immediately after a boss fight.

All in all, I went in with no expectations for HMC and was quite surprised there was a solid little game to be found.  If you can put up with RPGMaker clunk, there's a decent game here with some good ideas that could have really benefited from a larger scope.",1508991099,1540186522,True,19,0,0.718508303165435791,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Helen's Mysterious castle offers an interesting spin on turn-based combat by introducing a ""wait"" system. Each weapon or spell has a ""wait"" stat on it that decreases the time you have until the enemy's next attack, ensuring that you have to pay close attention to every battle instead of just mashing the confirm button to move onward. The amount of swords, shields, bows, and spells you collect with varying wait stats offer a plethora of options in combat.

The plot honestly took me by surprise by starting off as yet another ""the amnesiac hero is on a quest to discover who they truly are"" story, yet there are enough twists and turns throughout the story combined with simple yet enjoyable characters that it manages to be a memorable tale by the time you get to the end. If this game ever gets a sequel, I'd love to know more about the events that lead up to the first game.

If you're familiar with Cave Story, then you're already familiar with how a simply presented game on the surface can provide much more than you've bargained for.

Helen's Mysterious Castle has all the fundamental things that make up a good game; an intuitive and unique easy-to-learn combat system, a developing story with humorous characters, proper difficulty scaling as you progress, and some minor exploration to unlock more equipment. The store page implies the game to be a bit difficult, and it can be if you aren't thinking proactively in battle and levelling up your weapons as you progress. Fortunately, I never found myself having to grind just to get past a part in the game. It's difficult for any game to find that ""challenging but not unfair"" feel, and I think Helen's Mysterious Castle nails it well.

Right off the bat, it's easy for a player to notice several small things that seem off-putting or otherwise incomplete, such as Helen's lack of proper dialogue or inability to read. This isn't the developers being lazy; [spoiler]there are plot reasons for this that are explained in-game.[/spoiler] Any backtracking (which is completely optional in a casual playthrough) is helped with quick shortcuts to-and-from towns and areas that are unlocked as you complete them, so there's no need to trek all the way through a dungeon just to get to the next area if you've already done so before. The only reason you'd backtrack in this game is if you missed an item or equipment in a section and want to go back and get it.

It's easy to quickly judge and dismiss any RPGmaker game, but the experience I felt from Helen's Mysterious Castle is a significant cut above what you'd expect to feel from an RPGmaker game. I'd easily recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun RPG to play, especially if you're on a budget.",1506761456,1506837780,True,7,1,0.584244072437286377,3,False,True,False,False,,,

Since it's all based on visible numbers (no real status effects, delays or anything to speak of), there is no real strategy involved. You just get the best gear that you can and there will always be a 'best' approach to combat, with no reason to deviate from that.

Narrative is nothing special, either.

The real problem, though, is the technical execution. A few points in short:

- No usable Fullscreen mode (dev even recommends to play in windowed mode on this very store page)
- No possibility to load in-game or way to get back to main menu (in fact no pause menu at all). If you want to load a previous save, you have to Alt-F4 and restart
- Gamebreaking bug after a few hours that the dev is incapable of fixing

All of these issues are inacceptable for a commercial release, even if it is cheap. For an 'okay' game, I am not willing to put in a lot of research to get it running myself. Perused the Steam forums to verify that the dev is not able or interested to resolve the issues with the game, then uninstalled.

EDIT: I did file a request to receive my money back, however, since the gamebreaking bug occurs more than 2 hours after starting the game, that is not possible. This is, of course, not the fault of the developer, you just have to deal with the fact that Valve apparently can sell a defective product created by somebody who doesn't know what they are doing and not reimburse the cost if it doesn't feel like it.",1504961779,1505560696,False,3,1,0.412748187780380249,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It's not very expensive and it manages to have some fun and clever gameplay for an rpg to mix things up a bit. While the game outwardly has a very cutsy and sometimes silly demeanor, there does seem to be a hint of some more serious things going on. What I can only describe as the ""Wait"" system has been very well implemented and adds a certain amount of complexity and strategy to battles despite the limited number of actual moves. Personally I felt it was kind of nice that there is little random chance and most things are a direct result of your actions. Another thing that was kind of nice was that it was not random battles and battles only started when you touched an enemy on the map. The developer also managed to utilize experience in a very interesting way that didn't really make the game feel grindy. The art direction and hud as well as the user interface are all very efficiently designed.  The only things that took away from this game for me was that it can be a little jumpy when you move, the game does not appear to be very long(Though for the asking price I can't really call this a fault), and I unfortunately experienced a  game breaking bug pretty late into the game. However, as far as I can tell this is a rather rare thing to happen so I can still freely reccomend this game. For all it's faults it does enough right in unique manner that I think it is certainly worth a try, especially for the price. One of these days I'll probably go at it again with a new save and see if I can get past that bug.

Battles are turn-based but run on a counter. Different weapons have different count times, and different ATK and DEF values.

As a result of this system, battles are very strategic but also very snappy.  You can power up your weapons with EXP but grinding is minimal and you don't need maxed weapons to complete everything.

The story is somewhat basic but pulls itself together nicely by the end and I became invested despite myself.  There's some nice features here you don't see in a lot of RPGMaker titles like a run button and a decent amount of bonus content.

Helen's Mysterious Castle is one of the most interesting spins on the JRPG formula that I've seen in a while. It takes the standard timerbased turns and changes them up by havingf moves and equipment taking up a limited inventory space leading to decisions on which weapon do you want in the long run, or do you want to drop that spell for these boots, or maybe you feel like the investment into this sword will make it better that this other one over time. Overall I'd have to say it has quite good gameplay.

Graphics
It's pixel art

Music
It's all quite good

Hardware
Don't worry about it, it your OS supports the game it isn't intensive enough to be stressful on your system.

Other Ups
If you're having trouble it'll put a health up in front of you but you don't have to take it allowing for a mildly adaptive diffictulty, and it's systems also allow for a perfect run of the game (if ytou gring a bit that is)

战斗系统用半回合制网游的说法就是行动条制，然而大量特殊属性和挺少掉链子的AI让战斗——至少是初次战斗（打的次数多了也就总结出套路了）——变成了斗智斗勇的脑力对决。对方无视防御时应该抢攻还是回血？封印技能还有一回合就发动了，该送上哪个技能？糟糕了对面这个是假动作——好吧这个属性基本上是卖萌的。在黑暗中战斗，看不见对面的血条，要怎么判断能不能先击破对面——好吧这个当然是莽过去（跑）
剧情方面，真的是个非常好的故事，配合优质的音乐，让人深深陶醉其中。在此就不剧透了。S1上有汉化补丁的帖子：http://bbs.saraba1st.com/2b/thread-1355794-1-1.html
稍微说几个小细节。
女主的小表情很可爱，例如看见变态大叔……咳咳时的羞涩表情，自己落入毒沼时的惊慌表情……都在像素小人上活灵活现地表现了出来。
女主一开始是不认识字的，所以所有的书和路牌都看不懂，直到触发了认字剧情才可以，这时候可以回去把之前自己没看懂的东西都看一遍，会更早加深玩家对世界观的理解。某一关里会出现毒沼泽，踩在上面走动就会掉血，但是有个道具就在上面……当你走了一路过去后碰到守门的恶魔，他会张口问你：毒沼开心吗（颜文字）？
超欠的。
真的超欠的。和他家BOSS一样欠揍。
最后我还是要说一点……看见地图外怪物在乱跑？看见墙壁缺了块影子？某格黑暗里出现了自己的下半身？以为是BUG？很遗憾！是我暗道哒！这种在我们小时候玩游戏时因为好奇心而几乎是常识的东西，在长大后却因为各种各样的原因变的不敢尝试了。就像我最初接触LIMBO时被夹子夹死了数次，却一直以为是跳的起点没选好，就是没想到能拉动夹子。人长得越大，思维定势反而越多。“这里应该这么做”的想法根深蒂固，陷阱就是为了跳，宝箱就是为了开，哪怕是遇到会变化宽度的坑和宝箱怪，也不过是把“勾引一下”和“宝箱怪”加入新的套路中，单纯只是在增加自己应对问题的固定反应。
如果是小时候的我，会怎么做呢？
这确实是款好游戏，能不看攻略就尽量不看吧……我到现在都在后悔勇者走了后去追他结果跑回家啥都没发现因为BGM认为是最终战前了于是去看了攻略结果发现还有起码两战……把每个人都问几遍，每个东西都调查调查，每个墙壁都走一下，总会有新发现。

隨著冒險進度，玩家收集各種裝備延伸出各種戰略。

一般裝備分為四類

裝備類型 / 特色
弓 - 行動需求時間短，威力較低且幾乎沒有防禦力。
劍 - 行動需求時間中上，威力中等且有著一定的防禦力。
盾 - 行動需求時間中，沒有攻擊能力但有很高的防禦力。
魔法 - 行動需求時間長，有分為攻擊和恢復類魔法。攻擊魔法無視防禦力。

正常戰鬥方法都以弓或盾開局。但最主要還是要依照敵人各個行動所需時間制定戰略。

像是敵人詠唱魔法或低防禦力招式時可以用弓行動需求時間短的優點，
在短時間內造成最大傷害。

而敵人的當前行動不含無視防禦能力的話，就可抓準在行動生效之前用盾抵擋住攻擊!

然而裝備最多只能攜帶8個，依照自己喜好的打法慎選裝備吧！
在迷宮中丟棄的裝備並不會消失，而是會暫時保管在倉庫區（哥哥第一個打開的通道）。

在戰鬥結束後所取得的經驗值可以用來提升裝備等級強化效果，初期最高９級。
在第四階層解決鍛冶屋事件後可以拜託老闆強化裝備（可以超過９以上），
但每次強化都要休息一陣子。
( 含有★號的裝備無法升級和強化 )

從剛開始甚麼都不知道隨著冒險進度，
會漸漸發現關於海倫的身世還有關於哥哥不為人知的秘密......。


海倫最後得知哥哥就是傳說中製造出魔物的大罪人，
而整座不思議之城是百年前勇者們決定用來流放他和魔物的刑場。

自己則是當時受到魔物肆虐慘遭滅絕的精靈族倖存者，
阿迪斯無法原諒自己犯下的錯誤，想以收養她來作為最低限度的贖罪。

如今她已經不是當年的小孩子了，一輩子將她關在這座天空中牢獄也太可憐了！
於是阿迪斯藉著海倫好奇心旺盛開始探索遺跡時，
與大家策劃共同演出一場戲想讓她出去外面的世界。

當然大家都是很反對這個提案，
因為只要一打破結界的話，
勇者們馬上就會親手制裁所有不思議之城的居民（罪人）。

然而身為親人亦為朋友並同於一條船上，
大家深愛著創造出它們的阿迪斯也愛著海倫，就這樣開始了一連串的行動。



一段充滿愛與勇氣的冒險，
花很少的時間得到很大的滿足(戰鬥與故事方面)。

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What do we know about Helen? Well, she is a young girl of few words, she can’t read but loves a good steak! Helen’s true forte is bravery. She will embark on an epic journey, fighting enemies twice her size in exciting dungeons. Are you ready to play Helen’s Mysterious Castle? I knew you would be!

Helen’s Mysterious Castle is an RPG maker game where you will take the protagonist “Helen” into mazes and dungeons on a floating Island.

The game will start in a cute cottage where Helen lives with her brother, Ardis. Our heroin can’t read at this stage and does not speak either. She has been advised by her brother not to venture into the northern ruins as they are full of dangers. Well, what did she do? Exactly the opposite. She picked up a longbow and started her perilous journey. 

As she progresses into her journey, she will encounter a vast number of enemies, such as Orcs, Slimes, Goblins, Skeletons, Zombies, Griffiths, Harpy and many more. However, her first real challenge is to defeat the demon king and his four henchmen – Lord of Darkness, Lord of Poison, Lord of Paralysis and Lord of Silence. Be prepared for epic battles! 
A battle will start as soon as Helen touches an enemy. Depending on how far along you are in the game, you might have a selection of weapons (melee and range), magic spells (from books) and protective gears to choose from. The fighting mechanisms are very simple and easy to use. When Helen wins a battle, she is awarded experience points which you can use to upgrade weapons, spells and armour. Later on, Helen will be able to receive upgrades at the local blacksmith, too. Make sure you talk to all characters within the town when you reach that stage to progress further into the story. A quick tip for you - Helen will come across sparkling waters from time to time; these waters will regenerate her health when she drinka it. Also, make sure to break all pots you see laying around; some of them have additional health points hiding in them. Chesta and books (spells) can also be found in the dungeons.

I am absolutely amazed at how good this game is, and pleasantly surprised at its price point, at only $2. Fabulous content and re-playability. 

Nice graphics and simple combat mechanism. However, you will reach a point where the fights are too easy to win, in my opinion.

Positives:
~~~~~~~

-	Nice graphics
-	Large number of enemies
-	Good dungeons
-	Fun, addictive and good re-playability 
-	Great price
-	Trading cards 

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 

-	Easy to win a battle in the latest stage of the game
-	No achievements

A fantastic RPG maker game at a sensational price. A must have!

Story

It starts off like an old school RPG with no instructions and barely any dialogue, but the reason behind that comes later in the story and that changes everything, so don't be thrown off until after you've beaten your first boss. It is quite interesting and I did actually like some of the characters. I was left with a sense of accomplishment when it was all over, which is nostalgic in a way.


Gameplay

Here's where things get interesting. The battle system is like something I've never played before, it's really unique. Wait time is the biggest factor when it comes to battles. NOW, HERE'S THE REASON FOR THE -1: You cannot load the game from a previous save after you die, you have to restart the game and then hit continue. Kind of a pain, but not too big of a deal. ALSO IMPORTANT: REFINE YOUR WEAPONS AND ITEMS OR ELSE YOU'LL BE SORRY. I got stuck on one of the final bosses because of this. After you get far enough, a certain person is no longer available, so you cannot refine items which made it impossible to progress.


Sound

Music is an easy 10/10. Sound effects and soundtrack fit this game perfectly especially during the boss fights and towards the end of the game.


Graphics

Good looking game for the price. The animations are well done and the battles are more interesting because of that. 


Final Thoughts

Buy this game. This was an interesting journey and I think anyone would be able to enjoy it. It's simple, yet takes some strategy, but one is still left with a sense of accomplishment.

This game was a huge surprise. It's well reviewed but I had never heard of it so I was skeptical. This game is absolutely [b]awesome[/b].

The game has a unique battle system that is fun to discover. The system requires you to manage which ability you use based on your enemy's next move and in how much time they will use their ability. By studying your enemy's skillset you can trick them into using specific abilities which would you put you in a better situation. For example, if you start the battle with a quick attack they will start with a defense ability that lasts a while which gives you plenty of time to cast your spells. Learning how to juggle your foe is awesome.

The game also has very well designed levels. Nothing feels inflated for the sake of increasing the game time. Not only do the levels feel right, there are secret passages that lead to new items -- it rewards exploration. The secret passages are super obvious but there are visual cues that hint at something, so if you're attentive you'll be rewarded!

Another aspect that I loved about this game was the story. While the game starts off light on story, it's unravels itself as you explore the castle. I wanted to keep playing to find out what was going to happen next. This feeling was intensified by the awesome cast of characters. If I were to describe them in reference to another game, I'd say they are UnderTale-like. The type of characters I wouldn't be surprised to find in a Saturday morning cartoon. Fun and full of personality.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

While I loved the characters, I think some of the charm is removed by the naming convention. [spoiler] The ancient hero from 100 years ago was named Alex. The new hero's name is Zack.[/spoiler]  The protagonist is Helen. I mean, might as well call it Brittney's Mysterious Castle. It's not a huge deal but it is a little immersion breaking, doesn't quite fit the setting.

Some of the translation was a little sloppy. There were a few typos (albeit not many) but quite a few broken characters.

Let's be honest, the game makes use of some of the default assets. That's a bit of a turnoff and is one of the reason I was skeptical when I was going into the game.

A fun little RPG that combines the turn based elements of Final Fantasy, a spice of battle from Fire Emblem, and a wait system of that similar to Grandia. It's very light hearted with clean comedy thrown into the pot. If you're looking for a break from serious titles, give Helen a shot.

[h1] Won't repeat what was already said... [/h1]
What pulled me into the game was the sprite work and battle system. The sprite work is wonderful to watch and the battle system is simple to the point of breathing. The game is a walk in the park, but it still takes effort and time walking though it. Like a good walk to wherever you enjoy, you'll find it relaxing and colorful. Instead of filling you in with so much detail like stinky plot dumps, the game drops you in with less and makes you take in the journey more.

[h1] In the end	[/h1]
Helen's Mysterious Castle is a game I really enjoyed, and that's the most important thing. The developer made this game to be enjoyed, not one to struggle through. So if you find yourself having a tough time, it's alright to sit back and find some more experience or find that Heal spell you clearly missed.

It is made with RPGmaker but it has the nostalgia kind of feels towards the environment and characters. This game is an dungeon explorer, working with floors and puzzles, and also an RPG in terms of combat and story. 

The environment of the game very nice. The music is pretty good but I wish there was an option to lower it or make it louder. The dungeons themself, there are 4 floors which are pretty well structured. I like how they did hide some of the items although in your first playthrough you are definitly going to miss half of them because they have a secret part of the wall where you can go in or something like that. Unfortunately due to the top down view of the dungeon you can't really see them. There is mostly healing provided at the beginning of a dungeon or sometimes in the middle. In the end of most dungeons, unless the boss is guarding something like an item you need to beat them to get into a new dungeon. Bosses get exponentially harder each time and you will need a decent strategy to be able to beat them.

The story starts off with a lot of questions, you literally get thrown out in the game without any sense of who is who and what the backstory is at all. For some reason she cannot read nor speak but whenever doing a certain chain of events she gets to read a little bit. I like the silent protagonist it fits the story because you are supposed to be a girl who suffered a blackout for a very long time and she wants to explore the world, or castle in this game. Like with the items advancing the story is also figuring it out along the way. In your first playthrough you are probably going to miss a few things or won't understand some puzzles along the way but don't worry it's normal in this game. I guess the abstractness is part of the challenge. The story really catches you with a fishing rod and reels you in successfully. Your vision of each character changes the longer you play. Not to mention the plot twists which come along. All the questions that were open in the beginning of the game are answered throughout the game which is nice. Along with a nice story belongs a certain level of humor, which I felt like they did achieve in this game, I laughed everytime because the timing and the joke themselfs were on point. The game gives the player the option to choose between two endings a good and a bad one. I don't think that should be an option since the bad ending just results in getting out in the heat of the action and missing the most heroic ending I've seen in ages.

The combat system is also something the developper should be proud of. Instead of the standard I get to stab the enemy gets to stab turn system they have worked out something that really makes you strategise more. In your inventory you can hold 8 items max and you can choose from a wide variety from weapons and shields or spells which you can level with XP or holding passive items which gives you a minor but mandatory boost sometime. Spells have different kinds of effects like healing, piercing, stunning, poisoning, silencing or absorbing. Unfortunately is that you get only to play yourself with the first two types of effetcs. I would have loved to try out the others. Every action has a waiting duration, this counts for you and the enemy you are facing. This means that you need to strategise which item to use and when and when to block and when to attack or when to heal. The surprise effect is in the beginning of the battle because they don't show what they queued until you have queued something. Most battles follow an algoritm, this also counts for some boss battles but they can go off from that algoritm. If it does happen it's mostly a counter to what you have queued up. Without a decent strategy you might die sometimes which is not as bad as it sounds. When you die you get extra max HP up to 90 (means that this works until 90, not that you get 90 instantly).

All in all a good RPG which shows that going aside from the RPG standards won't always result in a bad game. A very good catchy story, good combat system and lovable environment and characters. What I'm most surprised about is the costs of the trading cards if you are into that market.

In order to exit your game, you have to COMPLETELY close the program.  There's no option/quit/load/load another save file.  Even though you'll have the option to save at anytime, there are certain areas of the game you trek through again but in order to avoid that you have to reload your save file.  It's very rare RPG Maker or not to run into a game with this failed feature.

Aside that, this game has it's own cute charm and it's a gem in its own way.  This game is more of a thumbs in the middle review (hence thumbs down).

I didn't get the MC (Helen all too well) she was a non spoken progtanist but some of the dialog from the npcs gave you the impression of her responses.  For an elf, shes pretty ditzy.  Not sure If I liked the ""?"" ""!"" chat choices or not.

The battle system, for the most part is very unique.  Until near the end the AI gets a bit ""TOO"" smart for it's own good which becomes frustrating at times.  Which goes back to point one, of restarting your game.  When you get killed, you go back to your starting point of the first floor.  There are short cuts you unlock along the way but to make the trek back is still tedious it's better just to reload your save to reattempt a boss fight.  I had friends asking me ""What's wrong with the game?  Why are you starting it so many times?""  I signed off my friends list just to spare them the annoyance.

This game reminded me of a condence version of Final Fantasy Legend for the gameboy.  Which was really cool and I liked that.  Tip to the developer:  Please for your future games ADD a reload feature, don't force a player to completely exit the game to restart.

[strike]《智障女神与妹控哥哥的神秘城堡》[/strike]是一款RPGmaker游戏，其中优秀的人物设定，鲜活的角色形象，以及精彩的场景演出都能给玩家在短短的游戏时间中留下不少美好的回忆。
游戏前期采用的是简明易懂的探索式开场，你既不知道你是谁，也不知道你从哪里来，你只知道你要去哪里。
为什么知道要去哪里？一是只有一条路，二是一开始仅有的一个npc告诉你不要走进那条路233333
没有多余的对话，没有多余的场景，直接进入地下城讨伐怪兽。
所以，前期这种潜移默化的系统引导其实是很不错的。很多优秀游戏比如塞尔达（虽然我没玩过）都是这种形式。
战斗系统其它评测里面有仔细讨论的，我就不多说了。因为不同怪兽的进攻方式不同，玩起来反而能感受到不少的策略感。（后面那个岩石怪的蓄力阶段无敌以及英雄的反甲简直惊了）
然后说到主人公，你控制的是这个城堡的女神。身体能力超强，从弓到剑到斧头（有吗？）样样精通；精神素质过硬，从雷电魔法到治愈魔法样样熟练。
唯一不足的是智力
跟别人说话只有一个呆萌的表情和
！OR ?
所以对面总是莫名奇妙感觉自己被嘲讽了然后开始决斗，接着被女主打的落花流水。[spoiler] （英雄泥奏凯，我死在你手上三次了233）[/spoiler]
接着你玩着玩着就发现...主人公的性格竟然也能成为剧情推动的关键要素之一。（学到了）
后来你会碰到许多角色，无论是四大魔王，不死骑士等等，性格都很有趣。
人物设定真的很不错。
后期的时候有许多地方系统引导不是很明确
比如通往主线的关键道路竟然隐藏在墙壁上...我看了别人的攻略视频才知道怎么走....（其实有提示...但是那里我看得确实不是很懂）
最后无论的打英雄的时候的演出还是最后的演出都非常精彩，也提供了真结局与坏结局的分支。
最后地图教科书式的重新回顾也起到了增加剧情感染力和游戏时间的作用，很不错。

It takes the turn based system of most rpgs and adds a timer to every attack, turning it into a much more strategic experience. You have to time your attacks so you can block damage when your opponents attack while landing damage when you do.

Enemies mostly have their own attack patterns, and will change things up to try and counter your moves. And so long as you're strong and skilled enough, you can beat virtually any foe without taking a scratch.

Boss fights are exceptionally creative, often times pushing you to your limits. And all of them are memorable.

The game is short, but charming. It starts out with you having no clue who you are or where you are. And as you progress, things start to make more sense. The ending itself is so fun, I've played this game an extra time or two just to enjoy it again.

This game costs only $2.00. It'd almost be a crime not to buy it. It goes WAY beyond what you'd expect to find from an RPG Maker game.

进入正题。
强烈推荐。自打《东方年代记》以来第二款令我震撼的RM作品。
从几个方面来说一下吧：
[list]
  [*][h1]战斗方面[/h1]
[/list]
令人眼前一亮的战斗方式，读秒回合制的RPG玩过不知道多少，可是很少能像本作一样玩出这种花样的。不同武器的行动力消耗不一样，攻防也不同，是利用对手行动的空隙用行动快的弓迅速地展开rush？还是用攻防平衡的剑稳健的展开攻击？或是用等待时间长但期间防御薄弱的法术将对方轰杀至渣？别忘了，你的对手同样也深谙此道……抓住对方的弱点，隐藏自己的弱点，速攻还是持久战，多动脑子才能取得胜利。女主并不能通过不断的击杀怪物来变强，而是用经验值升级武器，在这给一个提示，别舍不得用经验值，游戏某些地方的boss和怪是有硬件要求的。还有，摁住shift可以奔跑。我能想到的唯一一个槽点：（以下黑条皆含有或多或少的剧透）[spoiler]我实在不觉得部分boss的血条隐藏是个好主意。四魔将那个还好一点，至少可以说是boss特性，至于后面的灰血条给人一种的恶心感。明明需要玩家掌握尽可能多的资料然后思考进行下一步的行动的，却又限制这种资料的给予。矛盾。[/spoiler]
[list]
  [*][h1] 剧情方面[/h1]
[/list]
令人惊叹。千万不要被开场完全没有交代的故事背景，不识字且只会说“？”的女主，劝告女主不要去探险却又在女主被打倒后把女主背回来的哥哥[spoiler]（？）[/spoiler]这些表象所迷惑住，随着剧情的推进，以某件可选事件为契机，可能会让你对开始的这种令人摸不到头脑的设定刮目相看。“啊，这样一切就都解释的通了……”这样的感觉。[spoiler] 还有，身为魔物的大家都有一颗金子般的心呢。从镇长的小考验，再到故意放水的魔王和骷髅剑客，封印明明那么脆弱，现任勇者也远远不及当年的勇者强大，可是大家却依旧努力维持着这种平静，最终boss虽然强大而野心满满，不过只要大家合力就能无往不利。还有悬疑的设置，正当一切全部按着计划进行，女主顺利的打败了放水的魔王和骷髅剑客，马上就能离开城堡的时候，勇者突然杀到，看起来像是正派人物的他却直接打废了本来给女主乘坐的狮鹫，因为女主“看上去不是魔物”才放了她一马，接下来女主醒来前去追勇者的时候，作者的剧情铺设功底体现得淋漓尽致：封死各个阶层快速往返女主的家的通路，使得玩家只能玩家只得一个阶层一个阶层往回走，迷宫中的怪物……全部消失了，城镇中的大家……也都消失了……因为勇者，是来[b]退治魔物[/b]的……虽然这最后不过是虚惊一场，勇者是正直的，不过这里的悬疑营造确确实实是一个不可能被忽视的闪光点。[/spoiler]
[list]
  [*][h1] 难度梯度[/h1]
[/list]
总体来说还可以。不过快到结尾的时候貌似难度梯度出了一些问题：能过最终boss的配置，却过不了顶层那条巨龙和魔像小兵。虽然有可能那里面的道具是用来打隐藏boss用的，不过我觉得这么设定还是有点问题。
[list]
 [*][h1]其他细节[/h1]
[/list]
女主的pose很萌，也是解决一个谜题的关键。[spoiler] 四魔将的台词貌似会随着打败他们的顺序而改变。如果不把被村长关起来的可怜人放出来而直接打败魔王的话会怎么样呢……？我也没试过。女主其实是会说话的，用？和！恐怕只是表述方便而已吧……？[/spoiler] 从底层追勇者的时候，背后的妖精会随着阶层的进行来改变台词。通关之后，各地都安插了吐槽役。最终的五连战里可以操纵之前的boss角色来进行其中的一些对战，[spoiler]让大家了解到不放水的boss们的真正强度，同时[/spoiler]扮演boss痛打杂鱼的感觉真是爽爆了。美中不足：通关后不能存档真是遗憾。打最终boss的五连战中间没有可以整备的机会，万一打到最后一战发现以目前的装备水平并不能击败最终boss，还得重新再打之前四战和一大段剧情。

就以上这些吧。大段的黑幕真是抱歉，不过黑幕后的内容真的都涉嫌剧透 [spoiler]虽然我知道你们肯定都刮开看了对吧[/spoiler]。
另外这个价格绝对物超所值。不要犹豫赶快入手吧。
最后写一些提示给我当时卡住的部分好了：
①、在别人安安静静读书的图书馆里打打杀杀来回乱跑可真是太没礼貌了。Helen不能做这么没教养的女孩子。
②、第二层很难走吧？如果实在不知道如何到达第一层，就先去寻找本层的档案室来获取提示吧。
③、图书馆里的宝箱，把心静下来耐心等一会，比不停地推门撞门好多了。
④、那些蜥蜴战士和桶一样沉。
⑤、有人模仿了你的脸可他不能模仿你的面。利用上等老坛拉开模仿者和你的差距，亦或是直接一拳打烂他的头。

最后的最后，像本作中唯二的受难者，狮鹫（弟）和某只可怜的羊致以最崇高的敬意。",1483638628,1483638975,True,16,1,0.687611222267150879,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You get no potions, no other means of getting health back aside from a steak that gives you 1 extra HP. Big whoop. How about a five-course dinner that gives you a thousand HP, since you'll need that much to ever get past the second floor of the Dungeon of Death.

Throughout the game, you're given a lot of save file slots, which you may or may not use--you're also limited on how many items you can carry with you and forced to drop some in order to get others.  That might be concerning at first, but the game is easily playable without a guide, while still maintaining a sense of challenge.

————————————————————————————

虽然第二天要去实验室，但还是忍不住一口气玩完了。

诚实地说，在废都物语之后，我还是第一次玩到这么优质的RPG，是不是画面粗糙的游戏都是剧情非常好啊——居然还有了这种感想。

这是个很慢热的游戏。主角一开始不识字，没有世界观、读不了书架上的书，只有一个绿头发还不知道是男性还是一个英俊的女性告诉你“不要去那个遗迹，很危险”，我在这个不识字的阶段捡起又放下捡起又放下，这基本上是这游戏前四个小时我干的事。直到耐着性子打过了狮鹫来到了小镇子，走剧情打到了魔王和他的四大天王的时候才觉得这个作者真有意思，官方吐槽实在非常非常有趣。

到后来剧情可谓急转直下，虽然到了中后期能够阅读书籍开始就大概能猜到走向，但是结尾还是小小地出乎了一下我的意料。[spoiler]“他也是我们的父亲啊”实在是……其实这一点也很有趣，魔法师嚷嚷着“怎么，难道你们也有了感情吗，明明只是魔物”的时候，他自己创造出来的魔物也是有了感情啊。[/spoiler]

打开二周目再次听见让海伦不要去北面遗迹这句话的时候，还是觉得非常温暖。

[b]9/10，除了跑地图太累和一直在麻痹之间过不去第二条门之外，就我个人而言无可挑剔。[/b]



另外，关于一些可能卡关的地方：
[spoiler]1.去找幽灵骑士的时候，在一个有哈比和野猴子的地方，应该在回去被哥哥教语言的楼梯附近的一张地图，靠墙处有一条密道，从密道走可以到达地图的右方，那里可以找到幽灵骑士继续剧情。

2.第一次去找哥哥的时候，回到家里，北面的墙上有一条密道，仔细找找就能发现。

3.结局的时候回到2所在的位置即可。[/spoiler]

最后的最后，如果有像我一样不在乎游戏性，只想看剧情的人的话：

I ran into just a few errors/technical issues during my full playthrough that I figured I'd mention:

[*] Entering the large door before the Castle Gate caused an error message once and closed the game. I tried it again, and it worked fine.

[*] Minor spelling errors. They didn't seem to appear until much later in the game, and by this point, I didn't care--I was having too much fun.

Developers, thank you so much for this game. [i] Helen's Mysterious Castle [/i] was an absolute delight.

The gist of the gameplay is this: You're a one-girl dungeon explorer with various tools in your arsenal. Each weapons or spells have different stats, and ""wait"". Whenever you choose to use a weapon in the turn-based combat, both you and your opponent's wait countdown ticks down, until they reach zero, then the effect happens. So for example, if you use magic with 15 ticks wait, and enemy use dagger with 5 ticks wait, after 5 ticks the enemy attacks you, then they can choose another attack (since you're still in your magic casting). If they use another dagger attack, tough luck, in another 5 ticks they'll attack you again and you're still casting your magic.

It's simple, makes sense, smart, and fun. You try to strategize what weapon should you use this turn, should you use this long-casting magic spell that put your defense to zero but you think can down the enemy in one hit? This sword that is weaker but at least have some defense? Or should you put up your shield and try to find opening in your enemy's assault?

At first it might feel too simplistic or boring, but later when both your weapons and the enemies get more diverse, it get more fun.

And tha'ts not counting the simple but charming look of the game.

For what it sets out to do, its pretty [b]decent and straight-forward[/b] i'll try to avoid the fact that the genesis of it is [b]VERY similar[/b] to a certain taleUnder, but nontheless, its effective, easy to grasp and fairly original.

[h1][b]Writing[/b][/h1]
Is strikingly ironic that this point is still here taking on account how the heroine is absolutely, entirely, possitively, incapable of reading or talking, is not like the game is Le Graveyard though, this game has something of a NINTENDO Syndrome, the main character is a mute, but the world around you does a great job with information and chatters.
For a RPG though, there's not much character development, with one expection mind you.
Overall, [b]Simple, but effective[/b].

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
Okay now, this is the part I tend to hate the most about [b]RPG[/b]s, Turn-based gameplay I tend to find silly and too restrictive for my tastes, however, this game manages to [b]Brilliantly handle RPG tropes with a very unique spin to the Turn-based formula[/b].
You have the standard Weapons, Items, Enhancing and all that good jazz, but this game manages to simplify core elements of RPGs, while tuning them to be equally engaging and easy to understand, special mention to the [b]Wait[/b] system, which introduces a large pool for optimization and a risk-reward formula.
The way [b]EXP[/b] is handled is very effective for quick-learners while also cutting down tremendously on the usual Grind factor of a RPG, along-side the depth of the [b]Wait[/b] system, makes for [b]a very free-flowing and enjoyable, still strategic combat[/b], you even get to experience playing with enemies' moveset and stats for a short time! [b]I fuᴄking love that![/b]
Only gripe I truly have is the abundance of [b]Defense Ignoring[/b] attacks, it [b]kinda breaks the game on both ways[/b], but you'll get used to telegraph them or maximize them.

[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]
To put it bluntly, [b]Delightful[/b].
The landscapes you travel in range from Lively gardens to Lost ruins, all of them bringing absolutely amazing amounts of graphical detail and appeal, in-battle, making basic actions or even when posing during the Menu, everything is detail and animated silky smoothly.

[h1][b]Soundtrack[/b][/h1]
Have this analogy, its [b]like fast food, is amazing while having it, but is fairly easy to forget afterwards[/b].
The composition is mostly atmospherical, holding onto enough head-bopping traits to make it catchy.
However, with the two exceptions being [spoiler]Demon King[/spoiler] Castle and [spoiler]Hero Zack[/spoiler]'s Battle Theme, I can't really hum it by memory, that doesn't mean is bad, it just isn't infectuous.

[h1][b]Duration[/b][/h1]
As games made on Game Maker would have dictated by now, pretty short, [b]5 Hours tops[/b].
[b]DON'T LET MY PLAYTIME DECIEVE YOU[/b], It wasn't for the adventure itself, it's just that this game seriously [b]LOVES FAKE WALLS[/b], Two of them being related to Story progression with one not having any hint, so watch out.

[h1][b]tl;dr[/b][/h1]

For $2 it's an absolute steal.

And now, here's why!

Put simply, Helen's Mysterious Castle avoids most of the pitfalls common in RPGs throughout the ages- it even avoids the ones that Undertale falls into across repeated playthroughs. This isn't to say that it's a perfect game or that it avoids every pitfall, because it doesn't. But what it does do is avert a lot of expectations about the genre in very cleverly done ways.

Don't like random encounters? Good! Like Chrono Trigger, enemies wander around the various dungeons and battles only trigger on running into them. However, the enemies also move around in different patterns depending on the enemy. Cerberus will lunge at you at a high speed, Skeletons won't move, some enemies will move much faster if they notice you, and so on. This results in a very streamlined experience where you fight the battles you want to fight, or fail to avoid. Throughout the game there are very few forced non-boss encounters and these alone give you enough XP to beat the game, if you're careful.

Grinding is greatly alleviated and Helen has a very incremental rate of progression. Rather than leveling up on obtaining enough XP, you decide which weapons to level up with your experience. This can be done at any time, and poses some interesting strategic decisions. Do you level everything equally to be prepared for everything, or do you specialize in one or two attacks and hope that it's enough to take down everything in your path? The balance here could stand to be a little better, as the Blacksmith you encounter about a third of the way through the game can refine equipment 1 level beyond what Helen can, and the LongswordSP shatters game balance to the point where I highly suggest avoiding it. Other SP weapons are perfectly fine for balance, though.

As for the weapons throughout the game, there's a very solid mix. All attacks have three stats, and optionally a bonus effect such as piercing (ignores defense) or draining HP. These stats are Effect, Defense, and Wait. This results in a very simple system similar to Paper Mario where every attack has a predictable damage output, while also adding a huge layer of tactical planning that turns most boss encounters into puzzles. How can you exploit their moveset to create an opening to attack without leaving yourself open? This gameplay was very engaging to me and I played through the entire game in one sitting, taking about 5 hours.

Damage dealt is Effect of attacking move - Defense of defender's move. The tactical aspect comes in with the Wait stat- everything has one, and attacks only happen when the counter hits 0. If you cue up a Thunder spell, you'll be waiting a lot of ticks and any enemy with a fast attack will be free to wail on you during the cast time. This can sometimes feel a little bit like trial and error early on when you don't know how enemy attacks work, or what attacks a given foe has at their disposal, but Helen's Mysterious Castle allows you to save anywhere, at any time. Some battles do feel a little like there's One Right Choice for your loadout, but the sheer size of Helen's potential armory can make replays fresh, and with grinding being entirely optional, the battles don't get old even when they start playing out the same way every time. This simple system adds a ton of replay value by making the best choice at any given time dependent on what you're holding, and what your opponent is doing.

Many battles have creative gimmicks to them that can force you to change your entire strategy; one removes your current attack as an option for the rest of the battle, several poison you at the start which makes you take 5 damage after your every action, several can lower your max HP within the battle, some will make your next attack take longer to execute, one notable case will reflect all damage blocked... the list of creative gimmicks goes on and on. Every boss feels unique and fresh, which is a marvel for how overall simple the systems involved are. Helen's Mysterious Castle is definitely a case of real complexity through fewer meaningful choices. This is compounded by the fact that Helen can only carry 8 pieces of equipment at a time- anything dropped can be picked back up at a specific area opened fairly early on in the game.

On the topic of replay value: the longest cutscene in the game is about a minute long, barring the final boss gauntlet of the good ending. Again, this neatly dodges the common issues of RPGs having more dialogue and cutscene than gameplay these days. What gameplay there is, as mentioned, is only as tedious as you want it to be. The final boss gauntlet is even very nice in that it autosaves between each of the battles, instead of making you sit through the cutscene and refight any bosses you've already beaten. So many RPGs make you do this, it's kind of absurd! It doesn't hurt that the soundtrack throughout the game is always a good listen and always an amazing fit. Everything from the hanging gardens boss onwards is amazing, and while testing speedrun strategies for the last bosses of both the good and bad ending, the soundtrack never got old. And I was testing strategies for over an hour on the good ending gauntlet!

Let's see... I suppose I should mention the story. There really isn't much of one, and the characters don't stick around too long or develop much. But this is an otherwise small blemish on an otherwise fantastic game: especially since the small story manages to throw in a couple surprising twists even to longtime fans of the genre. Even I fell for the fake ending, and I can usually see through those a mile away.

Oh and I mentioned speedruns of this earlier- everything it averts above makes it a very fun RPG run with very little downtime. It fit everything I'd been looking for in an RPG speedrun, and I played it because I was looking for a short RPG to play through. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did, but I'm very glad I gave it a play soon after picking it up.

In conclusion: Helen's Mysterious Castle is a fantastic experience for any RPG fan, new or old.

It stripped away the tediousness of Riviera's stat grinding and replaced the classic level up system.
Instead of levelling your character, you level your equipment and this actively influences your chances in battle.
Because the game and difficulty is dependent on your usage of your equipment, the grind for more exp is really just a measure to make the already manageable difficulty more feastable for less experienced players.

The battle system is easy to understand and if enough thought is put into practice, this battle system is also easy to exploit. The really good aspect of the battle system is that you and your enemy are using the same battle system to defeat each other, with many different types of enemies taking a different approach to how they outplay you. This comes clear in the latter half of the game when enemies will actively try to punish you for misplays or for your potentially one-sided inventory.

For me personally, it's the boss battles that were really thrilling in Helen's Mysterious Castle. A whole lot of different play mechanics were brought into battle that bosses incorporate in their play but the mechanics still feel fair in terms to the battle system. Many players fill their inventory with their unique blend of equipment combinations, making the game feel really refreshing if you decide to use different equipments on your second playthrough.

What this game could have done better would be to include a general place to get tips and advice on how to proceed. On three occasions the game tried to artificially lengthen your playtime by obscuring your next tasks. You actually need to backtrack and check for information, find secret passages based on what was told by an NPC / written on a bookshelf or do specific things infront of objects - all in order to proceed.

[h1]Overall Rating - High Quality ★★★★☆[/h1]

[h1]First Impressions[/h1]
I can't believe it's been so many years since I touched Helen's Mysterious Castle (HMC), but that just shows how quickly time slips away. It's an RPG Maker game, but the developer created mechanics that involved a bit more work than what you might see in 100 other titles. You still have a modest, short RPG, yet if you're tolerant of indie experiences, it may be worth checking out.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
HMC gives a nice twist to what can be a repetitive combat system in most turn-based RPGs. Each move has three stats – attack, defense, and cast time. Attack shows how much damage the move does, defense will resist that much damage from an enemy, and cast time reflects the amount of time it'll take to activate. As you progress, you will have as many as eight options to choose from in any given situation, and have to predict what actions the enemy will take. 

If you play too defensively, they might use an attack that ignores your defenses. If you play too aggressively, they might use fast, weak attacks while you're vulnerable. Fast attacks have a good chance to hit, but when the enemy is blocking, it won't do anything. This makes even simple enemies potentially dangerous, since each move has pros and cons, and you'll have to adapt for each enemy. For this reason, this is an RPG where you are likely to die, as a new enemy you don't know how to handle can outmaneuver you. However, ""death,"" is lightly punished, and sometimes causes an HP boost. I'm not positive what conditions lead to that though. 


[h1]Controls[/h1]
After double-checking, I was pleased to see that this game is compatible with my controller. Interestingly enough, it's another recent example where the Start button was used for one of the inputs, instead of something more straightforward. Otherwise though, everything seemed to work just fine.


[h1]Story[/h1]
Initially, Helen is illiterate, which isn't something I ever think about with games. No matter the time period, most characters are educated enough to read, even if that wouldn't be likely. This impacts some early mechanics, since she can't read any signs, books, or other interactive elements you'd normally have no problems with in a game. As you explore and advance in this adventure, her naivete is made more clear as you find out about how this place works and what's going on. At a certain point, you'll even start questioning whether you're in a castle at all.


[h1]Visuals[/h1]
When looking at RPG Maker games, this is the main area where you'll notice where the title was designed. The point of the engine is to supply the materials needed to make a game without as much pain as starting from scratch, and part of that comes down to the building blocks in its visuals. It's definitely better than other examples, where enemies and other assets are just copy and pasted without any effort. Despite that, nothing really stands out or impresses me with how HMC looks. The enemies and characters are fairly standard looking.


[h1]Sound Design[/h1]
Having played some RPG Maker games, I wouldn't know whether the track here come from a song list, or if they were composed specifically for HMC. They're decent quality tunes either way, helping make the playthrough more enjoyable. However, even though the battle track is solid, it does get repetitive throughout the game's duration since it's the same no matter what enemy you fight. In some ways, the longer battles almost works against the song, as it'll mean you hear the same tune so many times. Looking at another matter, when your attacks land, they have a surprisingly impactful sound effect. I prefer that to a weak, barely noticeable noise though. Thankfully, they also aren't aggravating or annoying.


[h1]Pros[/h1]
🌟 Boss battles are more interesting than normal, because they aren't just bullet sponges. Instead, beating them revolves around learning their moves and properties, having to find the right strategy to outwit them.
🌟 Instead of leveling up from fighting enemies, you'll use those experience points to upgrade your equipment. It's not original, but is still a nice alternative to the conventional approach.
🌟 Dying in some games can be punishing, but it's not much of a set-back in HMC.


[h1]Cons[/h1]
❌ Even if the mechanics are different, you can still tell it's an RPG Maker game. There's just some inherent limitations from that.
❌ Some secrets were a bit cryptic or random, as I didn't see any hints to check that area, I just tried every part of the wall.


[h1]Tips[/h1]
🔍 When fighting the same enemy type, their AI tends to be consistent. IE, learn how to defeat them once, and the same approach should always work.
🔍 If you do get stuck, try another approach with different moves. Alternatively, a bit of grinding should be enough to get you through.


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Over time, I've gotten a bit jaded on RPG Maker games. Sometimes they can be surprisingly decent, but there seems to be a general pattern for those exceptions. They alter the mechanics so it isn't merely a turn-based RPG where you can mindlessly spam basic attacks. HMC does that, making each battle require some focus as you manage the three stats of each move. It's about the right length for an indie RPG, and has an interesting story as well. I didn't necessarily love some of the secrets, but I suppose that fits the idea of the castle being mysterious. 

Unless you find yourself intrigued by the mechanics or have enjoyed other RPG Maker games, even at $2, I wouldn't buy it. The game is decent, but it wouldn't change your perspective on RPG Maker titles. For those who are alright with a shorter RPG, with a focus on strategy and occasional secrets, I'd recommend picking it up. You'll find out pretty quickly whether it's your cup of tea or not.

There... that's about all that can be said about it, in an instant I've gone over the pros of the game and given you a summary in one line.
Yes I have 11 hrs in the game and yes I've finished it twice now and do you know what? I've enjoyed every minute of it.
The unique thing that stuck out for me... and the unique thing that sticks out for everyone is the battling system, let me give a basic (If horrible) explaination of it.

There is a 'wait' attribute with every weapon, this dictates the amount of 'time' you must wait before damage is delt or for how long the item is active, for example the wooden sheild (First sheild in game) has a wait of 8, therefore the sheild is active for 8 'turns' (That's how I'll refure to it from now... okay?) however the 'thunder' spell (Again the first you get in the game) has a wait of 10, this means 10 turns pass before you attack with the spell.
This 'wait' also applies to enemies meaning the game get VERY tactical very quickly, especally in late game, which devolves to: Use most powerful spell in game, heal, sheild, sheild, sheild, use most powerful spell. Rince and repeat.
The final boss is HORRIBLE for this.

Now, lets talk something else, say maps...
While the overworld maps are very small and sometimes constrictive, they work. It is hard to explain why they work, but they do. There are your confusing ones, the ones you wish didn't exist, the ""this is a perfect spot to grind"" ones and a little town one. OH BOY! What varity.

The game is very short, a decent player can reach a clear in about three hours including grinding times, how ever I an not decent at this game, it took me NINE HOURS to reach a clear for the first time... not as bad as Suguri... 31 hrs and counting... still haven't finished it on easy...
Sigh... back to this game 'though.
It's brevity is good, in a portal way. You can tell whoever made the game was running out of default assets to use (Did I mention that this uses default assets? No) because not long before end game you have to backtrack through the ENTIRE MAP...(S) with the shortcuts cut off. THough the default assets can be put aside, mainly because of the combat system... and the fact it was made in RPG school (From the name I'm going to guess it's babbys first RPG Maker) the readme confirms this.

Story wise there isn't much to say, the brevity of the game means there is little time for telling of lore and such, however the story we have is solid, but has a tendency to introduce charactors at the last minutes unless you've been paying attention throught the entire game and have found all of the readable bookshelves.

So, here we are, the end of my review. There isn't much to say about a normal $2 JRPG, but this game is special, oh so very special. In it's combat, it's kind of stupid storyline and not to mention the maps (Yes I'm going to harp on about them... despite them being small... and sometimes kind of shit...)
So Pros and Cons... the poor mans TL;DR.

Pros:
Unique combat system

Wacky and stupid story that we all love.

Lots of hidden secret passages and such holding... sometimes powerful gear.

An enemy named 'What is this?'

Price tag

Cons:
Sometimes it's hard to get decent gear without being killed or knowing the maps and such.

One or two annoying parts (Namely one door I can not for the life of me figure out how to open, but somehow do. And one boss where you can't see their health bar or they're 'wait' timers or the stats of the attack they're about to use)

Small maps, the maps that exist are good, just EXTREMELY small... and sometimes hard to navigate.

Some gear can only be found once, for instace right before a boss fight when you shouldn't drop your good weapons but for completeionest sake you do anyway, admitently the particluar situation I'm talking about yeilds a rather good weapon with a great Debuf.",1479713039,1479713039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

With this game, I got my wish.

Story:
Overall, it's a very simple story. You play as the silent protagonist Helen (literally, all she really says is ""?"" and ""!"" and stuff along those lines) as she is seeking to get to the first floor of the island to discover about her past and the world below. Along the way, she faces many challenges against different kinds of monsters. There isn't much too it until you finally reach the 2nd floor that the plot takes a surprising turn, but that is best saved for you to find out.

Characters:
Despite how simple the story is, I found the characters very likable. Helen despite being silent is simply adorable, and you'll find yourself attached to many such as the Undead Knight and the Demon King as well as Helen's brother. There isn't really much large character development, but I'd say it works for a very simple story.

Gameplay:
Unlike other RPGs, this game runs on fighting a single enemy each battle. The three stats are as followed:
Effect - How much damage you'll deal
Defense - Reduces how much damage you'll take through simple subtraction. If the Defense is higher than the Effect, unless there is a pierce effect, you'll take no damage.
Wait - How long before you take action.
The key here is use the multiple of weapons, armor, magic and tools you find to combat against the enemies you fight, since all of the enemies actions have a wait and the turn won't end until you attack. And example is fighting Slimes in the earlier stages of the game: You can get in two shortbow attacks before the are close to attacking with their command, so use the wooden shield after that to guard their attacks and negate the damage before launching the final attack you'll need to finish them. In addition, you can only have up to eight items at a time, so you will need to discard items to replace for different ones. This in term brings strategy to the game as you'll need to figure out how to combat enemies effectively as there will be points enemies can out-think you and will guard or perform a quick powerful magic attack while your preparing for a strong hit. As you get closer to the end, the enemies get smarter and more challenging, especially the bosses. In fact the bosses from the 2nd floor and to the end of the game are highly considered some of the hardest fights in the game. This game is short, but it's by no means easy if you can't think carefully. You will be losing a lot.

Final thoughts, it's a very short and simple story that will make you feel for many of the characters. But the battles can prove to be very difficult to the un-prepared compared to other games. I'd highly recommend it as it is ONLY $2.

Let me begin with a few pointers that I wish I had known going into Helen's Mysterious Castle. First, fullscreen mode (accessed by holding Alt and pressing Enter) caused horrible stuttering on my system and I know I am not the only one. The best way around this that I found is by using Windows Magnifier. You can trigger this by holding the Windows key (between left Ctrl and Alt) and using the + and - keys to zoom in and out. By default it zooms in where your mouse cursor is located. On a 1440p monitor I found +325% zoom to be just right.

Second, the main character, Helen, is illiterate at the outset of the game. You can learn to read, but it is easy to miss and cannot be unlocked by backtracking late in the game. I'll spoiler tag the instructions, but this is a very, very minor spoiler: [spoiler]When you first unlock the second shortcut back to your home there will be a new gravestone nearby. Examine it for a cutscene where, among other things, Helen is taught to read.[/spoiler] If you don't do this you'll miss out on some nice tidbits of lore that help to more fully illuminate what's really going on in this mysterious castle.

The third and final tip: After fighting the Undead Knight, there seems to be a common game crash that is avoidable. It happens immediately after the battle when entering a double doored cathedral through the left door. The right door does not seem to be affected by this crash, but it's worth saving your game just in case.

[b]Now, on to the actual review.[/b]

This little gem of a game's brightest aspect is its battle system. Combat encounters are elegant duels that have you constantly switching tactics in order to counter your opponents moves. I will leave the details for you to discover on your own, but in short you have 8 inventory slots to fill from a collection of equipment that includes bows, swords, shields, various magics and passive stat boosting items. You will need to keep a diverse selection in order to be successful.

You find new items at a steady pace throughout the game. Many of them are in optional side areas. As you gain experience in the game, you do not level up yourself, but instead use your experience to upgrade your equipment. This grants a satisfying sense of progression that gives you frequent, small boosts in power.

The combat isn't entirely flawless though. First, fights are only ever 1 vs 1 affairs. The mechanics don't lend themselves well to having numerous participants. Second, once you've found a winning strategy against a particular monster, you can usually easily repeat the process on successive battles with that opponent type. This is both good and bad in that it rewards you for skillful play, while also making further battles less engaging. These are minor complaints that are largely counteracted by excellent boss encounters, many varying enemy types and the relatively short length of the game.

Uncovering details about this game's castle setting and its inhabitants is a joyful experience. You are set loose in the beginning with no exposition and only slowly learn the true nature of this place and its people. There are a few minor writing errors, but the script is otherwise skillfully woven in a way that, as more information is revealed, you can look back on some previous conversations and see deeper meaning in them. The story is often cute, relatively lighthearted and even comical at times but it is not without touching moments and serious topics. Visuals and sound commendably convey the emotions of the scenes, albeit in a familiar SNES RPG style.

In addition to being illiterate, Helen also speaks with only two symbols, ""?"" and ""!"". This gives the sense that she is also mute, making her hard to relate to as a character but easier to apply your own personality to. I didn't care for this design decision. Regardless of this, she does have a short but interesting past that's tied into the plot. Most other characters are enjoyable but the game isn't long enough to give them great depth. There is one character that I won't reveal the identity of that is the main focus of the story. We get to learn a lot about them, even more so if you unlock the ability to read.

I ended up playing through this game twice. My first playthrough took just over 6 hours to complete while the second was a little over 3 hours. I actually accomplished more the second time through despite taking half the time. Unfortunately this game is occasionally unclear with its directions on how to proceed. Two instances in particular had me lost for a significant amount of time before discovering that the way forward was through a hidden passageway. I only discovered these by mindlessly running into walls in the general area that I thought I was supposed to be in. I wouldn't call that good game design and it artificially pads the game length.

There is decent replay value to be found here. Trying out different equipment builds can be fun. There is enough hidden and optional content that you'll likely find new things the second time around. In the credits there is a hint on where to find the entrance to a dungeon with the hardest enemies you'll encounter in the game. There are even two endings (that I discovered, at least). One is definitely more satisfying than the other but it is easy enough to move from one to the other without replaying the whole game.

With such a low price tag this is an easy game to recommend!",1478150827,1478150869,True,18,1,0.700206339359283447,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Helen's Mysterious Castle is simple, fun, short, and charming. It does what it does well and scratches all the right JRPG itches, with an awesome combat system that you can pick up in moments, yet which keeps on delivering depth throughout the whole 5-6 hour experience thanks to the plethora of unique items and interesting encounter designs. Much like the combat, the story starts off incredibly basic, yet manages to pull off an emotionally engaging ending by the time it's done. I have to give this game huge points for being so accessible and easy to pick up, unlike so many JRPGs that frontload slow paced story and tutorials. Helen's Mysterious Castle has enough confidence in its gameplay and tone to allow those parts to suck you in first, before layering on the narrative and mechanical complexity as the adventure unfolds.

The only noteworthy negative I encountered with the game was related to a section of backtracking, waiting, and moderate confusion at around the mid point, where the requirements for progression started straying into the ""run around talking to everyone and examining everything to try and find the progression trigger""  ballpark. There are perhaps one or two other moments in which this might happen for some players when the progression path is unclear, and the lack of online walkthroughs for this game might result in a little frustration, but thankfully there is at least one commentary-free LP on youtube that should help anyone who gets stuck.

Aside from that, however, my time with Helen's Mysterious Castle was thoroughly enjoyable. The music is fantastic and enthralling, the storyline and characters are cute, the difficulty progression ramps up beautifully from smooth to challenging, and there's potentially a fair bit of replay value if you want to try and find all the hidden items and try out varying builds.

But the main draw is definitely the battle system, which you learn in a dungeon designed to teach you through experience. The game, while certainly difficult, isn't out to murder your progress; you're sufficiently warned before any incoming boss fights, and if you do go down, you just end up at your house (or the inn), with a steak next to your bed that you can eat for a permanent HP boost.

Its story is minimal and affecting. It starts with no intro to speak of, dropping you straight into its world, then gradually unfurls. Little characters and moments are far more important than they initially appear. Short conversations endear you to its characters, so much so that you're sad when they're seemingly gone forever, and overjoyed when they return.

These narrative arcs elevate what's already a world-class dungeon-crawler. The level layouts are smart, economical, and dense. The one-on-one battles last under a minute a-piece, and pose extremely clever and engaging tactical challenges. It's a hard game at times, but also very kind -- death in battle poses no penalty except for sending you to the start of the dungeon, where you're given a meal that permanently raises your max HP.

The aesthetic builds on default resources with heaps of excellent custom sprites, animation, and reorchestrated music. For someone already delighted by the RPGMaker 2000 aesthetic, the effect is intoxicating.

- The combat system is deceptively simple yet the more you play the more you realise how deep it can be, and how it gives rise to a wide variety of uniquely-feeling encounters. Combat feels tactile and strategic with only a few elements. Very clever.

Instead, each weapon has three stats and (in some cases) a special effect. The three stats are the time it takes to use the weapon, the defense bonus while the weapon is being used, and the damage dealt when the wait time finishes. Quick, flimsy attacks allow you to deal great damage when an enemy uses a low-defense weapon, and coordinating your wait times to use a heavy hitting weapon without getting hit are just two examples of how this battle system opens many unique encounters with new strategic opportunities.
You do not level up in this game. Instead, XP is spent on weapons to upgrade them. You can only have eight weapons at a time, so choosing an effective loadout is important. Don't worry about losing weapons you drop on the floor to get more inventory space: A room reachable fairly early in the game allows you to regain your dropped weapons, and they will still be leveled up!

虽然""不看攻略自己玩""是一种乐趣，但那蹩脚的英文翻译与隐晦的通关指示/解谜提示，也许会让过关有些难度，浪费不少时间。

总的说，作为RPG Maker系的JRPG，本作的质量是出类拔萃的；尽管并未优秀到不可错过，但若说所有RPG Maker系游戏中只能推荐一款，我一定会选这款。

--------------------
乘着Steam大奖评选期，更新一下这份评价吧。

《海伦》是一款已经被人们忽略了的、极好玩的游戏。从人设、音乐，再到系统、情节，《海伦》都有着RPG Maker系的同类所没有的一种清丽脱俗的气质。
然而这样的一款游戏在国内知名度之低至今依然是一个不解之谜。因而这次评奖我毫不犹豫在""在这游戏火之前我就慧眼识游戏""大奖一栏选了《海伦》，希望藉此多些人会接触到这款游戏。

此外，我有些许想向作者申请帮忙汉化这游戏。谁有这个志愿一起来？[/strike]

Very short. About six hours short. But that's not why I'm not recommending the game.

You start off the game with almost no idea of what to do. How do controls work? Where are my menu options? What key presses do I need to do? How is my controller mapped? I probably spent half an hour going, ""Ok... wtf?"" You kind of run into that through out the game, as it does a poor job of explaining itself to you.

Furthermore, the story isn't very compelling.  You start off as an illiterate mute. You can't read any signs and can only respond with either ""?"" or ""!"". That's not engaging for me.

General Overview:
It's not a very long game, nor is it too challenging if you know what you're doing. The game mechanics work really well, being turn- AND Wait-based. Wait-based? Yes! The Wait gauge telling you how long you have to ""wait"" until you can execute your move. Being fast usually means hitting less hard, but being quick can result in the opponent doing some serious damage.

Story:
The story is a bit lacking. Took me a while to figure out I was a monster, living with monsters that look like humans. The game is pretty linear, and so is the story, but it can be difficult to figure out just where to go and what to do next. There's not much character development either.

Inventory:
Your inventory is limited to eight items, be it weapons or gear. If you collect an item, that you later wish to drop, just drop it. It is ""collected"" by one of the NPC's and you can easily get it back. The weapons and spells are pretty cool, but the Heal-spell is a bit of a let down. It decreases a level every time you use it outside of a battle, meaning you have to upgrade it again.

Leveling:
You don't level. Your character, Helen, doesn't get stronger. The EXP you earn are instead used for leveling and upgrading weapons and spells. That's a pretty interesting and unique idea for a game made with RPG-Maker! Throughout the story, you'll be able to find Health Bonuses, boosting your Max HP with a few HP. The steaks you get when you die, help a bit too, but only to a certain extent.

Visuals:
This game looks wonderful! It's made in RPG-Maker, but it looks so much better and more customised than any other RPG-Maker game I've played before. The characters look cute, you can actually open cupboards and every monster is represented by an overworld sprite and a portrait.

Music:
Standard music, but nice tunes. In the credits, all songs are credited, which leaves me to assume they come from the free music database. That doesn't make them any less fun to listen to though! ^ u^

Controls:
Really easy to use. Just use the arrows to walk and Z and X for other actions, hold Shift to run and you're good to go. Don't accidentally hit the F12 key to make a screenshot, it brings you back to the Title Screen... That happens to some people, you know >///>

Overall Opinion:
A wonderful, short, fun and exiting RPG to play, that can be challenging at times, but never too much to make you stop playing it. I've read some reports of the game crashing, but I haven't even encountered a glitch, other than the music not always starting when you reload.

After progressing deeper into the dungeons, the story begins to unravel revealing much more than what was introduced. Characters you meet each have unique personalities with most brimming with optimism, with a good balance between seriousness and comedy.

The gameplay is centered on duels, with each enemy having a unique pattern or gimmick you must solve either by brute force or careful strategic planning. As you get stronger, by leveling your weapons and eating a lot of steak, you'll find that duels you previously thought were difficult become really trivial.

The pacing is very good, both on the level of simply entering and exiting menus, which is snappy, repsonsive, and simple, and on the level of the lengths of stretches between bosses, which I felt were just right.

Join the adventure of the silent and illiterate Helen on her quest to learn how to read!
Make your way through dungeons crawling with monsters by simply being too adorable to hit!

This game features an interesting combat mechanic that has either little or no RNG at all. For me, that's fantastic. This allows you to plan your moves ahead and predict your opponent's next move, if you know them.

For a $2 game you can expect a pretty dam good experience with this retro JRPG style game despite it throwing you in the game with no explanation whatsoever. It's most likely a short game given its price. But as you go along with the game the story slowly but surely unfolds itself both subtlely and obviously as you progress through the game.
But what I really made an impression on me is that you can tell the devs had fun making this game as its evidently clear with its plot twist trolling and pun intended humor. Not to mention what surprised me was its refinement system and simple yet intuitive turn based battle sequence. Also the OST tracks are quite memorable and the MC is a cutie. (When you open the item menu keep an eye on her every couple seconds. You won't regret it)

Generally you see ""EXP"" as the numbers to indicate when your character will lv right? Welp not for this illiterately challenged elf girl. The ""EXP"" gained from defeating foes is soley used to refine the equipment you find via the item menu.  As your Eff(Atk) and Def is soley based on the gear you chose to use during combat.
Elf girl herself doesnt gain any stat boosts at all other than HP boosts you find lying around or free steak when your defeated (yay).

Now the combat system is different but intuitive in its own little way compared to the generic turn based combat. I'll over glorify it alittle. This games combat is all about momentum and how well you can control the flow of battle with some slight predictive insight on how the enemy will react to the equipment you decide to bust out in battle.  As each equipment has a ""Wait"" count to it which is the amount of numerals it will take for the equipment used to take effect. That applies to the enemies as well. Refinement generally reduces wait count on said equipment so be sure to grind for EXP. You will be fine as long as you know simple subtraction. Some monsters are trickier than others especially with feints.

Now although I already pointed this out, I am enjoying the game in my current 1st playthrough. Also F4 to toggle full screen.",1465714756,1465719662,True,6,0,0.571068048477172852,0,True,False,False,False,,,

中间卡关了，多谢@Zygie同学给的提示，今天终于打通了。
通关之后有种酣畅淋漓又意犹未尽的感觉

游戏的最大特色就是战斗系统了。这种读秒制的回合战斗一旦上手就停不下来。每种怪物的打法都会有很大差别，武器和技能用得正确就很轻松，反之就是被怪两轮带走。尤其是最后拿到节拍器（Metrorome）后，通过丧失一格读秒时间来精确控制对方的读秒，从而能准确完成击杀，感觉这点也体现了作者对这个战斗模式的理解。

剧情个人非常喜欢，是一段很暖心的小故事。最后大团圆的结局好评。也许人和怪兽和平共存的设定不是非常新鲜，但是作者的确把每个角色，不管是人还是怪物，都塑造得非常有个性。在最后甚至可以和史莱姆对话，虽然只会说“！”而helen还是那一句“？”

关于游戏的音乐，虽然是8-bit的音乐，作曲编曲却非常用心。我觉得完全能够拿来循环当作业音了。浮空岛每一层的音乐都很有特点，尤其是最后boss rush，每战音乐都不同，为了听音乐retry了很多次233  看staff似乎是作者友人原创的音乐，简直良心

You are Helen, a girl of indeterminate age who can't speak or read...and that's kind of it! The story reveals itself as you make your way through the titular mysterious castle, and while an RPG that drops you right into gameplay without a cutscene or whatnot can be disorienting, it does allow you to get right into the battles, which is where HMC really shines.

I'm a fan of JRPGs that:
a) require more than mashing A to win
b) have defending be a viable strategy
c) have grinding/buying a ton of healing items not be the solution to everything
...and HMC meets all three criteria. Battles are duels - you (Helen) v. a monster. As you explore, you can find a massive array of weapons, with each weapon having three stats - Effect (how much damage the weapon does), Defense (how much of your opponent's damage the weapon can negate), and Wait (how long it takes to use the weapon). Each enemy also has its own set of attacks, which makes battles a kind of back-and-forth dance: the monster is getting ready for a big attack! Do you put up a shield to block it? Or use your longsword to both attack and block some of the damage? Or spam a ton of quick, weak attacks so that you beat them first? Or charge up your healing spell so that it comes out right after the attack connects?

Another thing that makes HMC unique is that Helen herself never levels up: you still earn experience points after battle, but they're instead used as a kind of currency to level up your weapons, to increase Effect & Defense and/or decrease Wait. The only way Helen can get stronger is through HP upgrades, which are found through exploring - these optional upgrades, as well as the veritable arsenal of weapons you can find, gives the game a great amount of replay value.


The story is genuinely funny at times, although ultimately it's not much to write home about. The game itself isn't particularly long, too - it can easy be finished in an afternoon.

用RM制作的复古像素RPG游戏，玩家扮演的女主角在一无所知的情况下开始了探险……
系统很简单但并不枯燥，游戏开始的部分因为比较轻松很容易沉迷进去w
也许正是由于那种没有任务和目标的使命感，氛围让人感到很放松，而且对冒险本身很好奇
女主角既无法阅读，也无法使用语言与npc交流……
游戏里出现的书架和石碑，都会写着“You can't read this”简直好像是作者偷懒没有写文本但其实……？
总之是一款谜团重重，很难不剧透又描述出其中悬疑气氛的游戏。
不过可以透露的是，虽然有吊胃口的部分，情节并没有那么苦大仇深，不管是真反派还是假反派，都处在一种欢乐的氛围里，尽管如此游戏里该严肃或者温情的地方依然好好地表现了出来，是一个很可爱的故事。（游戏总流程大约在6-8小时，前面一小部分会打得非常快，后半段有些提升难度。我自己打了10小时…感觉一般人都会打得比我快的）

游戏的配乐非常赞，当时就是看完宣传视频被配乐和角色人设深深吸引才入手的。

*以下含有剧透成分
[spoiler] 中途一度卡关，感觉难度跳跃挺明显的？在demon king之后的迷宫部分，隐藏通道感觉都难找了一个级别

剧情上来说，全部打完之后有一丢丢的失望，当然全员热血+搞笑看得是很轻松，不过游戏前半段那种疑云重重破解谜团的感觉太赞了，特别是刚刚学会读书的时候，从家里的书柜开始调查，把迷宫全部重新走了一遍，对那些怪物制造记录的调查，简直像解谜游戏，很有些恐怖的气氛，结果嘛……

角色倒是都很可爱，亡灵骑士这个角色也太帅了？很对我的喜好，非常绅士，孤高，强大，赞赞的。Demon King和女仆镇长一家太谐星了，Zack小仙女和Krace与龙都是帅不过三分钟。
Ardis倒是一点没崩，既没有配合着搞笑也没有心理扭曲什么的。
总之是一个明明设定让人觉得很窒息（封闭的漂浮岛+囚犯设定）但意外的全员阳光正直积极向上的描写角度，真的超意外，最后临走之前去迷宫里遇到怪物还能友好地对话…
不能细究的可爱，但可爱就是可爱，可爱就是正义，没有什么不好	[/spoiler]

Rather, it's a bit more like a mix between Dark Soul's equipment upgrade system and Shadowrun's karma system in that you you pay for equipment upgrades using the xp you earned, much like currency, and each bit of equipment levels up entirely separate from each other (in other words, upgrading your sword won't make your shield more expensive to upgrade). The only stat your character has is HP. Everything else is derived directly from your equipment. Also, HP can only be increased through a few special one time use items that you happen to find here and there, or whenever you eat a steak when you get k the f o'ed.

What to say about this game. First, a positive criticism! It's a RPg, ok, but not as the other. 

I have a passion for RPG currently on Steam. I'm looking for games type ""Old School"" with fighting turn-based like in Final Fantasy. I want a nice little story, with sub quests. And with this game, I was greatly served!

The story occurs gradually. The fights are completely new and awesome and it's not the turn-based. No inventory with items to find and store. Just select weapons that you find. You must choose which is best for each fight. There is not much, just the basics for each level. Those that you do not keep are stored in a location that you access easily.

[h1]ツクール2000共通の仕様[/h1]
F4：ウィンドウモード化　F5：ウィンドウを小さくする　F12：即タイトル画面に戻る

[h1]概要[/h1]
元はVIPで作られたRPGで、VIPRPG紅白2011にて1位を取った名作。

VIPRPGは独特の世界観（もしもシリーズ等が有名）が構成されていることが多く、
お約束を理解できないと楽しめない作品も多いが、
このゲームはそういったことを知らなくても楽しめるように構成されているので、
VIPRPGをよく知らない人にもオススメ。
（キャラの名前等はVIPRPGのそれが踏襲されている）

[h1]システム[/h1]
オーソドックスなダンジョン探索系RPGだが、戦闘システムが非常に洗練されていて面白い。
戦闘は全てタイマンで、いわゆるカウントタイムバトルと呼ばれるものに近いが、
敵の次の行動内容とウェイトタイムが常に表示されているため、
それを見ながら自分の行動を決めていく、という戦略性の高いものになっている。

剣：攻撃と防御が高いが、ウェイトタイム長め
弓：ウェイトタイムが非常に短いが、防御が低い
魔法：敵の防御を無視できるが、自らの防御がほぼゼロになる上、ウェイトタイムが非常に長い
盾：防御が高いが、攻撃は不可

基本的には、これらの4つの武器を使い分けながら戦闘をしていくことになる。
敵のAIも賢く、こちらが魔法を選ぶとウェイトタイムの短い攻撃を連発してきたり、
剣を選ぶと防御をして来たりするので、その駆け引きが重要になってくる。
そして、それが最高に面白い。

[h1]シナリオ[/h1]
クリア時間は割りと短めで、シナリオも結構さっぱりしてるが、
中盤以降の徐々に世界の謎が解き明かされていく流れが非常に良い。
王道的な熱い展開も多く、登場するキャラも魅力的なキャラが多い。

[h1]総評[/h1]
VIPRPG、ツクール2000製ゲームの中でもかなり上位に来るであろう名作。
ツクール製だから、VIP製だからと言わず、是非一度プレイしていただきたい。

でも、わざわざSteamで買わなくてもフリー版をやれば十分かもしれません。

After finishing my first playthrough I went right back and played it again, and then after my second playthrough I went and played a third time, honestly I have no idea why I got so engrossed with it.

The story is simple and enjoyable, it doesn't try to be anything more than it is, and even though it is a RPG Maker game I must give credit where it is due, the creator did an outstanding job on this nice little game.

Combat is I would have to say the main part of the game and is where it stands out, every weapon has its own pros and cons, you don't level up per-se rather you use xp as a currency to improve your weapons, however you may not want to stick with your starter gear and just keep leveling it up as there are many different weapons you can acquire throughout the game.

The various different areas, each having their own theme whether your finding secrets or solving puzzles, there is a great deal of backtracking going back and forth through these areas but it never gets to an annoying point throughout all my playthroughs it never once bothered me.

Overall I would have to say that Helen's Mysterious Castle is a great game that is more than worth the price, it is both well written and presented, the game is not difficult so you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.

An excellant game, priced well below its actual value. I almost feel like I am robbing the poor developer for getting it for such a low price
That said, there are moments when this game fails to explain elements and its suprising how few of the items are actually all that worth using (The only bow you need is the Longbow. Even in late game it is invaluable with its speed) and the game doesn't do the best job of explaining where you are supposed to go (Finding the final dungeon had me stumped for a while, forcing me to look up a guide). When in doubt, just click on everything.
On the one hand this is very refreshing from the modern obsession with holding the players hand all the way through, but I fear it might lose a good number of people who would otherwise adore this delightful little gem

Though there is a nice little story -- I would call it ""tidily epic"" -- the main attraction is a unique take on traditional turn-based JRPG combat.  Helen, the titular Elven child warrior, fights each enemy one-on-one.  Every weapon and spell has attack power, defensive power, and a specific deployment countdown; thus you can use a broadsword, which has high defense, as an automatic shield as you wait for it to slash.  The enemies operate likewise, and just as you can see their countdowns and the attacks they lead to, they adjust their tactics based on yours.  There are no random die-rolls; every bit of HP loss is determined directly by weapon stats and defensive subtractions.  This system is very fun, and it creates a much greater sense of involvement than the ""I hit you, you hit me, I heal me"" progression of yore.  I never got bored with it in the nearly 12 hours I spent with the game!  [i]Helen[/i] is fairly easy, but it's so much fun fighting monsters and exploring the castle that it doesn't really matter.

Took me about 8 hours to beat it, but I'm also the kind of person who likes to grind, so about an hour to an hour and a half of that was grinding. The combat is definitely interesting, that much I'll say. You have a variety of weapons that take different amounts of time to execute, so you'll be planning ahead most of the time rather than reactionary decisions. 

The enemy's attack and remaining ""wait"" are always visible, so every fight kinda feels like a puzzle. You have up to 8 weapons that you can carry at anytime, so what you bring will determine what your strategies will be, which is a really interesting idea that I hope someone adds more complexity to in the future. Some of your weapons offer a passive effect to further add a little bit of variety in your playstyle. Your character never levels, but you find items that increase your max hp, and the experience you gain is like a currency that is used to level up your weapons.

What kept me playing the game until the end was the combat and my curiosity for what new weapons there were. By the end of the game you can pretty much predict what will happen, so the story wasn't a big interest of mine. But the combat remained interesting, for at least the first half of a fight when you encounter a new enemy. After the first half of a fight the AI will fall into a predictable pattern, but I suppose that's the ""puzzle"" aspect for ya. Figure out the optimal strategy and you've got it down. And that's what I enjoyed, manipulating the system in every fight, maximizing the efficiency of my loadout and strategies.

The one big gripe that I had with the game was that when you finally find that new weapon you've been waiting for, but your inventory is full, you have to drop a weapon to get the new one to try it out. You can get the weapons you drop back, but it's a lot of leg work to go back and change them out. So when you find that sweet new sword, but give up your bow only to find that you miss that l'il bow, now you gotta hoof it through enemies to get your sweet baby bow back.

A light, fast-paced, incredibly full of value RPG stuffed with character and charm, well worth the $2 price. Definite recommendation.

[h1] Longer Review: [/h1]

Helen's Mysterious Castle is, at its core, an action-adventure game with RPG elements. The main character, Helen, explores the titular castle to discover who she is, why she's there, and whether or not she should leave. However, Helen cannot speak, or even read, instead conversing with by replying ""?"" and ""!"", adding a charming quirk to her adventure. Side characters instead will fill you in as the game progresses, and the story is pleasant enough for any age, neither too childish, nor too serious.

Perhaps the biggest difference between this game and other RPGs lies in the unique combat system. Imagine an Active Time Battle system from Final Fantasy that you can control the flow of. Each weapon has a ""wait"" stat, which tells you how many more moves you'll have before the item you selected will be used, or, in the case of shields, how long it will be active for. This adds tactical play, as all battles are 1 on 1, and you can see when the enemy will attack, too. EXP from battles goes to leveling up items, and health is increased by breaking jars that sometimes contain health capsules. 

Battles are fast, dangerous, and even puzzle-like, but your inventory can hold 8 items at a time, and a majority of items are useful enough to get you through a fight one way or another. If you run out of room, dropping an item will place it in an item bank you can access later in the game. 

And if you die in battle, you aren't forced to reload a save--the game sends you back to a nearby location and gives you a health boost item to make the fight a little easier next time. I beat the game without saving after dying and I don't think a 100% perfect run unlocks anything special, so don't worry, there really is only a benefit to dying.

The Mysterious Castle is packed with secrets and intelligent game design, teaching the player the mechanics without telling them, in a sense. Graphics are pleasant, sound is great. If I had one qualm, it'd be that sometimes there are secrets that involve walking through random walls. Some of these areas are hinted at through dialogue, but I became conditioned to run straight into every wall for a while just in case. Nothing is missable, but items are valuable, so I can't hold it against the game necessarily.

Plus, the game is only $2. I won't give a playtime so you won't know when the game ends, but I guarantee you'll get your money's worth. 

I 100% recommend this game, especially because even if you don't like it, you're only losing a Large Fries side order at Wendy's, and the money goes to someone clearly passionate about game design.",1459124611,1459124750,True,7,0,0.573682725429534912,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Combat is easily the best part of the game, and it's really fun! More fun than just about any other RPG on the market, completely unlike any other RPG Maker game I've seen. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages between Effect (attack power), Defense (you can reduce damage even while attacking), and Wait (the delay before the attack occurs). The wait timer is the key to it all, as even a single point of difference in Wait can change your options significantly.

You don't have levels, but your weapons do. You spend your XP to improve your weapons, so your starter gear can still put up a fight for a long time without needing to be replaced. There are also a lot of weapons to choose from, but you can only carry 8 at a time. However, you are able to get back dropped items, so there's never any worry about dropping the wrong item to make space for new ones.

There's very little randomization in the way enemies react, so it's a little like a puzzle to try to figure out the most efficient ways to take down each enemy. Saying that, the AI is a little weak. Once you know what attacks they have, It's easy to lock enemies into a pattern that they will never break out of. Figuring that out, though, can take some educated guesswork.

The dungeons are different in both appearance and theme. One area is about helping people, another is about solving (easy) puzzles, a third is about finding secret rooms (other areas have hidden rooms, but this area uses them to progress as well), and the starter areas and final zones to round out the package. The story takes you up and down through the levels multiple times, so there's additional backtracking in case you missed something or you can use shortcuts. Content-wise, other than the equipment there isn't really a whole lot, but I don't have any complaints for the price I paid.

I'd really love to see more games in this style, and I definitely recommend this game for 16-bit RPG fans!",1458447564,1458447564,True,16,0,0.650000274181365967,0,True,False,False,False,,,
