1) The 58 Japanese lessons you read like a lazy game tutorial 
2) The tests are at the end of every week, they get harder, later weeks you take 2 to 3 tests in one sitting, you only have 60 seconds to finish a test or it's an automatic game over. 
3) There are typos and grammar errors in the lessons or tests.
4) The story is about an American teen boy who dreamed about going to Japan and attend his dream school. But the problem is he's flat broke after getting into Japan so he lives in a girl's only boarding house with his female classmates. Also stupid American MC lies on his resume to the principal and he can't speak Japanese. So instead of rejecting him, the principal decides to bombard the MC (and us) with lessons and tests to prove he's qualified to be at the school.
5) When the game allows you to breathe and have a social life you can interact with one girl per day. If you stick with one girl, she'll be your girlfriend at the end of the playthrough. Problem is said girl will not always be available everyday, choose the right dialogue boxes for extra love points and have 5 dates with her (hanging out doesn't count). If you did everything accurately she's your gf at the end of your run if not your single and  have to try again from the beginning.
6) The characters at best are just generic  visual novel characters. They get boring fast and you (the player) would be more worried about studying.
7) Text skip speed is the slowest I've ever experienced in a visual novel even on the ""fastest"" setting. 
8) If you're a completionist, DON'T GET THIS GAME. While the achievements are not objectively hard to get you need to play the game 5 times minimum to get everything. Everything I complained about above you deal with them 5 times or more if you messed up. I heavily recommend cheat engine.

If you're genuinely interested in learning Japanese don't buy this game. First of all for a game or even a VN it's boring. There's no creative fun gameplay to have what you learn stick so the lessons are equivalent to studying with PowerPoint slides. The game is like school where it just reads the lessons, demands you to study when you have free time and demands you to pass every single otherwise it boots you out for being lazy and stupid so there's no flexibility to learn or take the tests at your pace. Also just like school the tests throw harder questions that weren't covered in the lessons. The further I played the game, I forget what I learnt, no longer cared about learning anything and I resorted to cheating on the tests using Cheat Engine to pause the time and use the game's slides or Google Image translation. I feel like if a school made a visual novel it would be Love Language Japanese, Heck there's a part in the story where you go to the beach and you're forced to endure lessons.

You can only either beat this game if you're already familiar with Japanese or like me use Cheat Engine",1668752026,1668752026,False,8,0,0.617090702056884766,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The lessons are brief and basic and do not contain sufficient explanations to be able to pass the tests without a lot of trial and error, unless you do have some prior knowledge. On the story side of things, the plot was amusing enough to keep me playing regularly, but I probably wouldn't have finished the game if I wasn't playing it for the Japanese practice.

First and foremost - the game's been abandoned for almost three years now. All the bugs, typos and generic missing content will not be fixed, ever.

It's merely decent for learning some very basic language - it will teach you some very basic things (and even has explanations), but the learning content is pretty much confined to the lessons themselves, there's no immersion in the VN or any minigames (those were promised before the developer dissolved). The japanese course has plenty of errors, typos and inconsistencies (like tests having words you were never taught). Besides that, tests themselves are time trials and nothing more. And it does not teach you kanji, even for words it already teaches.

It's pretty meh as a VN - there is one straight line and the only events you can get are dates (which do not change the plot at all). Besides that, if you intend to replay, the skip is quite slow and the lessons/tests are an obligatory part of the game, so replaying takes quite some time. In terms of variety and building score - even with vigorous save scumming you might very well miss the final date merely because you gave a suboptimal answer in one of the early dialogues.

Overall I can't recommend this game too much except in case you quite like the visuals, desperately want some basic japanese with your VN and do not mind missing out on the final date (which is a big goal, presumably).",1641301148,1641301148,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Score for learning Japanese
2/5

I have self-studied japanese on and off for a number of years. My understanding is rudimentary, mainly because I keep forgetting everything I know. I'm able to follow the lessons and benefit somewhat from the new vocab, but that's about it. The game is basically here's a bunch of stuff to memorize. Now we're going to ask you yes or no questions about some of it - including stuff that you weren't even taught.

Score for dating game:
2/5 
I haven't played many dating games, but this one isn't very fun to play. You are constantly having to do the lessos, it's non optional, and each day, you get 1 choice, maybe 2 towards the characters. Everything else is auto. it would have been very easy to actually give you more choices within the structure of the game, but instead it just feels like a pointless grind.

Score for art
4/5
For what it is, it's perfectly fine. The art looks good, the characters are interesting enough, if stereotypical. 

Score for characters
Max is easily the worst part of the game. One of the characters is your standard hates boys. The way the teacher is so up in your grill without any choice over the matter is kinda weird. Really it feels like you have one real romantic prospect and the others are there to give the pretense of having a selection. 

I bought this game because I had already read reviews about the ability to learn Japanese from it being average at best, but I was looking for something to motivate me to pick up my Japanese habit again. Unfortunately, this is an extremely average language learning game and a fairly annoying dating game. I'm convinced that all of the concepts are here to make this into a decent game, but from what I've seen so far, they haven't put in the time and care to execute that.",1630755556,1630755556,False,5,0,0.548059582710266113,0,True,False,False,False,,,

De mon point de vue, le jeu est une bonne façon d'apprendre mais il faut bosser sur le côté car chaque jour dans le jeu représente une apprentissage et c'est assez difficile au début de tout retenir, donc il faut être motivé à prendre des notes ou déjà avoir quelques bases.
Personnellement, je recommande l'utilisation des jeux de la saga ""Learn Japanese"" pour vous familiariser avec les caractères japonais avant de jouer à ce jeu.

L'histoire est assez basique mais donne un peu de peps au jeu en sortant de certaines phase de routine.

En dehors de ça, le jeu possède parfois quelques erreurs et bugs, j'ai déjà eu un softlock et des dialogues qui ne s'effaçais pas.

It teaches Japanese basics: hiragana, katakana and basic topics such as counting and telling time. It does not go into kanji (except the very last lesson introduces the kanji for the four directions north, east, west and south). You will need to take notes and create your own flash cards as it does not provide good vocabulary drills. As with learning any language, you get out of it what you put in, so will do some learning outside of the game.

You are a guy who has cheated on the entrance exam to a prestigious school teaching Japanese. As a punishment you are sent to the absolute beginners class and have to pass a test every Saturday or you will be expelled. As there are not enough dorm rooms available you get to room in an otherwise all-girls dorm. You can pursue various romantic interests, eventually leading to dates but don't expect anything spicy here. There may be some suggestive content but in general it's probably even safe for children. What you see in the Steam store page is about as hot as it gets.

The learning Japanese part is quite divorced from the dating sim part. Apart from doing your homework in your bedroom in the evening, you don't use Japanese outside of the school. We get introduced to the use of tadaima (I'm back home) and okaerinasai (welcome back) but then it is not used again. It would have been nice to see some common phrases scattered around your day, perhaps shown in kana.

If you don't know Japanese and are not interested in learning it you will not get much out of it as your progress will be blocked by tests. If you know more than very basic Japanese the dating sim part alone is probably not worth buying at full price. However, if you are an absolute beginner with an interest in Japanese this game is what you have been looking for to get you motivated to finally start learning.

There is quite a few things that could be done better but I am happy with the game. With such a narrow target audience one can't really expect a ton of money being put in its production.

Минусы:
1) ООООООООООЧЕНЬ затянутое начало! 2 часа диалогов до 1го урока! Это самая затянутая обучающая игра, из всех, что знаю.
2) Отсутствует достаточное число повторений материала, чтобы его запомнить - игра подходит для повторения, когда Вы уже учили Хирагану и Катакану, и Канзи.
3) Отсутствие системности в преподавании уроков 
3.1- в уроках ничего не говорят про дайкутены и не показывают вместе каны с и без дайкутенов, что ЗНАЧИТЕЛЬНО замедляет запоимнание.
3.2- не показывают одинаковые каны в двух азбуках Хараганы и Катаканы
3.3- нет уроков для распознавания очень похожих символов, чтобы перестать в них путаться. 
3.4 Хотелось бы выбирать правильные распространенные фразы и слова во время общения - правильно здороваться, прощаться, обращаться к людям...
4. Игра строго на английском языке, но в своих видео - Я все переводил.

Плюсы:
1) Весело - атмосфера позитивненького анимэ про школу и гарем девиц.
2) Эротично - Вас все хотят и постоянно на это намекают. Это приятно.
3) Хентай - большинство персонажей взято из хентай игр, так что можно найти их обнаженные версии.
4) есть примеры многих слов во время уроков.
Итог: игра хороша только для повторения, а начинать изучение с 0 лучше с серии Learn Japanese To Survive.

1. สมุดจด หรือ iPad เพื่อจดศัพท์ แกรมม่า ฯลฯ
2. Dictionary ที่เป็นเล่ม หรือ Application ในมือถือ เพื่อเปิดศัพท์ภาษาอังกฤษที่ไม่เข้าใจ (เกมเหมือนเป็น Virtual Novel  ทำให้ คนที่ไม่เก่งภาษาอังกฤษอาจจะรู้สึกเหนื่อยได้ (แต่มาเกมแนวนี้ ถ้าไม่ได้ภาษาอังกฤษเลยคงไม่ชายตามองแล้วมั้ง)

ดังนั้น เกมนี้คุณจะได้ฝึกทั้งภาษาอังกฤษและญี่ปุ่นในคราวเดียวกัน ยิงนัดเดียวได้นก 2 ตัว (ถ้ามีความพยายามมากพอ)

หน้าต่างในการอ่านต่าง ๆ ทำได้ดี สะอาด ไม่รก ฟอนต์อ่านง่าย คำศัพท์ภาษาอังกฤษที่ใช้ไม่ยากเกินไป

- เกมจะเริ่มเรื่องว่าเราเป็นเด็กต่างประเทศที่เข้ามาเรียนที่ญี่ปุ่นโดยวิธีที่ไม่ถูกต้องสักเท่าไหร่ แต่ได้โอกาสจากสาว ๆ บางคนทำให้เราได้อยู่ต่อ
- เกมจะสอนเราตั้งแต่ตัวอักษรภาษาญี่ปุ่นเริ่มแรก คือ ฮิรางานะ เลย ทั้งมีเสียงอ่านให้ฟัง และทดสอบเรา
- เรื่องราวของเราค่อย ๆ ดำเนินไปเรื่อย ๆ โดยเราสามารถเลือกได้บ้างว่าจะทำอะไรต่อไป

- Dean is nice.

Cons.
- Max is fucking annoying.
- Teacher Saito is an aloholic who can't find herself a man and that's the WHOLE DEPTH of her character after several hours of playing and >50% game completed.
- Miyuki is annoying bitch who just hates MC without adequate reasons and changes her attitude after basically 1 sparring session.
- The game actually tries to teach you japanese. It fails. These lessons do shit to help you understand the language, yet the game tests you every week. Got less than 50% answers right? Game over.
Even worse - after first few weeks you start getting two tests in a row. Several weeks later - 3 fucking tests in a row.
- No ""Dating Sim"" mode that would disable these fucking tests.
- Resolution of game resets every time I launch it (and sometimes even while I'm playing) and always goes to 2715x1527.
- Dialogues are pointless. What's the point to give me the choice between 3 options if character WILL SAY THE EXACT SAME THING NO MATTER WHAT I CHOOSE, the only difference is that one of these options will give you some relationships points. Maybe.
- MC is absolutely generic, spineless, boring idiot who behaves like a clicheed japanese schoolguy.
- Music gets on nerves VERY quickly.
- You can't skip unread text.
- There is NO CHARACTER SPECIFIC ENDING. What's the point of maxing relationships and going on dates if it does not matter in the end.

That is almost six hours, so if you are considering it, expect to take about 12 hours to play through once.
What drew me to getting this was the idea of a visual novel that is designed as both an instructional tool, as well as a dating sim. In many ways it fills both of those slots, but at the same time, it is not without problems.

First of all, the good:
The story is cute, as are the cast of girls you have to chose from. Like most dating sims, it does not tell you how to win the hearts of your chosen girl and you have to stumble around figuring it out. This I think is good as it will mix up future playthroughs, which will only serve to strengthen the lessons.
Your initial lessons are in Hiragana and Katakana, followed by sound combinations. Understanding there, as in being able to sight-read them without effort is essential to developing good skill in Japanese. This is by far the greatest strength in this game. If a player puts in the effort, they can learn one of the most important foundational skills they need for effective learning. However, this focus on these alphabets comes at a price.

The Bad:
Typos? They exist. Every game of this kind has typos. Move on.
This game focuses on Hiragana, Katakana, and sound combinations. While those are good to know, and can help with Kanji learning via Furigana, the simple fact is, you need to know the Kanji for what you are learning. When dealing with Japanese, be it in games, manga, anime, newspapers, or any other media, you will be confronted with Kanji, and knowing how to read it as it is presented will make it much easier to practice, and keep your skills up.
But, I think my main complaint about this game is the total lack of proper explanation of the use of は as a particle. The game consistently refers to the particle は as Ha instead of Wa in all of the Romanji. This will set a beginner in Japanese with a very bad habit that, while forgivable, can be very embarrassing, as well as hard to change later in learning. Bad habits formed in the beginning can be very hard to overcome later in the cycle.

Overall, I feel it is a good game. It has a fun cast, an enjoyable storyline filled with every trope you can imagine, appropriate music, and will help you recognize some basic building blocks of Japanese. Maybe it will even teach you a few words and a little grammar along the way.",1613332613,1613332613,True,9,0,0.612925887107849121,0,True,False,False,False,,,

His lie is found out, but they let him stay on the condition that he passes weekly tests.  If you fail a single test, you are expelled from the school and it's game over.  Helpful hint: save your game right before each test.  That way if you flunk out, you can easily get back to it to retake the test. It's kind of like a harem game because there is only one other male character. The women at the school make the game fun and interesting.  I did fail one test and got expelled. After that I buckled down and studied my other resources, then came back at a save point before the test and passed it.  I'm developing a crush on one of the girls.  She may be waifu material for me.[/spoiler]  The lessons are just right: not too hard and not too easy.  You do have to be serious about learning Japanese to enjoy this game.  I recommend you get supplemental  resources to help you learn your hiragana and katakana. There are two things I don't like: 1) When I go into settings to turn down the background music so I can listen to pronunciation, the change in the setting doesn't stay.  So I have to turn the music down every time I use the program. 2) Everything is timed.  That is understandable for tests, but exercises are also timed.  That is counterproductive because I need time to figure things out sometimes. Those minuses aside, I highly recommend Love Language Japanese for the serious weeb or learner of Japanese.

The basic premise of the game is that you've made up a bs story to get accepted into a selective Japanese language school. As you got caught lying on your application, you are punished by being put back into the beginners class. Fortunately, or unfortunately, for you, there was also a mixup in your living arrangements and so you end up living with a bunch of cute girls in an all girls dorm.

I started this game wanting to learn Japanese, and not so much do the dating parts, but I can't say I wasn't interested in the dating aspect either. So I can forgive the cheesy as heck plot, even if it is cringy at times. I do like that you can date some ""older"" ladies, though I guess they're younger than I am, but not the mc.

Each day is segmented as a lesson, after lesson activities, some after school activities to raise your love meter with various girls, and then end of day activities (such as revision). At the end of each week, you have to do an exam and pass it, otherwise you get sent back home as per your punishment for lying to get into the school. I like this approach to the design as it follows what is a regular school day, at least from what my ancient memory recalls it being like.

The writing, on the whole, is pretty okay. It's not high literature, it's mostly just ego stroking for the player to reward them for staying in the game. Working towards a goal that is more than just learning the language is more helpful, at least for me. It's kinda like if you go to the gym to train but have no goal for the reason for training, and so you will burn out and quit. But as long as you're working towards a goal, you'll stay in the game.

Lessons in this game start off really basic, like あ = a, for example, but eventually become more and more complicated as you go. I feel like some of these lessons could have been condensed together earlier on, but it works the way it was done. As you progress, the end of week exams become more complicated as well. In the beginning you play match up like A = ? and a bunch of choices appear on the screen to choose from. But eventually you're substituting words or letters in words within a sentence. Each exam also only lasts for a minute and there are 10 questions in each. At the start, it'll seem easy, but if you don't actually learn the material, you'll get stuck later. One of the biggest criticisms of this system is that I think only 50% is a passing mark, which means that you can essentially just guess your way through the game. Have you really learned anything if you only know half the material? A 50% at the start will show the cracks at even 3-4 weeks in the game, where you'll just end up failing. My second criticism here, though it's also a positive, is that the 1minute window is too short, especially if you're reading new words or concepts. Though this does also improve your ability to read quickly, it also allows you to just game the tests if you read only say, the first word of a sentence and the missing letter is there, so you neglect the rest of the sentence which might be a detriment to learning.

I feel like if you fly through the game though, you'll have a hard time with it, and so I've implemented a few rules that I do in each of the in-game days of learning.
1. Do the lesson
2. Take the lesson quiz at the end of the lesson 3 times.
3. If I don't 100% a quiz, I reset my counter and need to 3 more lessons at 100%
4. Do the all lessons study at the end of the day with the same rule as 3.
5. Review lessons if needed
6. Do one week of this per real world day to prevent burnout or mental strain. So that's 5 days lessons, 1 day exam.
You could probably also hand write your lessons too so you get used to writing in Japanese if you wanted to. Much like any learning material, you only get as much out of it as you put into it!

There are, however, a few bugs and typos in this game. The most predominant one I get is that in exams, if you press an answer as the timer hits 0, the game thinks it should go onto the next question still. So on the final exam, you will get like a 70% but be able to continue on until the end of the questions. This can change your score to a 100%. In these cases I do this exam but then reload at the end and try again. Other bugs have been covered in reviews here, but I don't see them often enough.

Overall, this is a pretty alright learning assistance tool for the language. It does have some flaws that make it not ideal, but they can be overcome with supplementary material.

Vocabulary appears in the test segments despite not being mentioned anywhere in the lessons, giving the impression that words were added and removed from the game without any care to maintain consistency. There are also spelling errors. The quizzes are also inadequate. Most practice quizzes are only 5 questions long (you can't make them any longer) and have no safeguards against repeating the same question 3-4 times. It's a crapshoot whether each quiz will be useful, so you just have to spam quizzes over and over again to get any benefit from them. Finally, some of the quiz questions are paired with {B}wrong{/B} answers. So that's fun. Thankfully, that's more the exception than the norm.

As a dating sim, it's formulaic, tedious, and dull. The characters don't even qualify as one dimensional, They're uninteresting, and your interactions with them are (thankfully) short and meaningless. Even the character art is generic and unappealing.

This COULD have been a great concept if the dating sim and lessons were interwoven, but at least as far as I've gotten in the game, this has not yet happened. They're two completely separate elements slapped together. The only thing driving me forward is the lessons, as the sim parts are painful and pointless to sit through.

I really like the idea of using the plot of a gal-ge to drive the player to actually learn a new language.  Having just failed out of the class (for the first time), I can say this...  get a notebook and a pen and be prepared to actually study, like a Japanese student should.  That is what I plan to do, start over with a fresh save and take the language part seriously.

As a tip;  pay attention to and learn all of the vocabulary words well.  If you are not fluent with them later in the game, it will cause you problems later.  You will be reading longer and longer sentences, and translating them against the clock, so you can't look things up very much during the tests.

As a warning;  this game is a bit glitchy, and the English is not so hot....  but the art is, and that might help.  There were times when there were multiple lines of text overwriting each other, but a quick save and reload fixes that.

As a summary;  if you like visual novels and want to learn Japanese in an interesting way, Love Language Japanese is worth the investment in time, money and effort... I think.

This review will be covering developer Papurika Moe’s first published title, “Love Language Japanese”. In this game, players will have the chance to learn the basic aspects of the Hiragana and Katakana writing systems, along with some rudimentary sentence phrases. With that being said, let’s get this review underway. Hope you enjoy
In the words of our best friend Max “Break a Leg”.
Love Language Japanese Is a visual novel style dating simulator that is focused on teaching the player the basic function of the Hiragana and Katakana writing systems. The game does this by enrolling the player into a twelve-week Japanese course where the player will learn the basic Hiragana/Katakana characters and some basic word/phrases in Japanese. During the first three weeks players will learn the 46 Basic Hiragana and Katakana characters; along with their alternate dakuon (20 characters), and handakuon (5 character) forms). To make things simple, you will learn 142 characters by week 3 in the game. From there, the remaining 9 weeks were spent learning numbers, how to tell time, rudimentary sentence congregation, customary pleasantries, how to ask for directions, how to state your likes/dislikes, and how to give a retelling of daily events. The game gives the player several opportunities to practice with the various materials that you learn through out to course of the game, which is always a nice edition to games that focus on teaching the player a new language.
 Before we get any further into this review, I think that it is always important to note that this game is intended to be used as a supplemental resource while you are learning Japanese and not a standalone teaching substitute. With that out of the way, lets continue with the game’s story.  
In this game, the player is entering their first year at Koto Gakuen academy under the misconception of being a third-year Japanese student. This ruse is quickly noticed by the school’s dean and the player is put into a rather precarious situation. The school’s dean decides to not immediately expel you from this prestigious institution, however the player has been played into the school’s first year Japanese learning program and has to past a series of weekly examinations in order to stay at this institution. If the player fails, then they are immediately expelled from the school and is forcefully deported back to their home country. The plot thickens further as this school callously over looked providing their new foreign student housing accommodations at the school. Unbeknownst to the school’s dean, a teacher at the school found this new foreign student housing at her sister’s all girl dormitory. This would not have been an issue if this new student was not a boy. With the game’s stage set the player now has to survive through 12 weeks of gruelling work so your character can continue to live out his dream to live in Japan. 
By the time all of this is covered you should have already made it part way through your first week in the game and thus begins the gameplay. The game operates in day cycles and has around 83 days that the player plays through. These days will start off with the player going through the day’s pre-set morning rituals. Once these are complete the player will continue to the days lesson, which will then be followed by an in-game leisure period. When this passes, the day’s end sequence will occur and once complete the day will end with a new day being on the horizon.
The game’s dating mechanic operates by the player choosing the appropriate text dialog, which will inter progressively fill one of the five dateable girl’s affection gauge. As the player fills this gauge, they will unlock specific dating events that give the player a new Computer Graphic (CG) Art. Each girl has a total of five unlockable CGs (one for each date) which gives the player 25 CGs for dates and around 7 that are unlock as you play through the game. Each day you have an option to choose between, the school, dean’s office, mall, shopping plaza, shrine, restaurant, and garden where you have a chance to running across one of the game’s five dating options during the in-game leisure period. It is also during this time that the dating events will pop by the players in-game phone ringing to signal that on of the girls wants to have a date with you. As you progress through the game, each girl will give you their phone number and this will help you to find their exact location during the game’s leisure period (considering that you only have two chances to choose between the locations be for the end day sequence commences, this is a great way to find out if the girl that you are looking for is available). It is important to not that every girl Is not always available during each leisure session, so it is up to you to adjust your gameplay for the girl that you want to court.   
In the game’s class sections, the player is presented with specific courses of instruction that focus of various aspects of the Japanese writing system. Once a lesson ends, the player can take a five-question quiz to test their retention of the class lesson or continue to the game’s leisure area. During the leisure period, the player could also take the time to receive a practice examination to measure their retention of the course information with a series of ten questions. There is also an option for players to revise their lessons during the game’s end day sequence. Prior to a day’s end, the player has the option to review the lessons that they have taken throughout the course of the game or to take the ten question practice exams. 
The quizzes in the game can have four forms. The first form realizes on questions that require the player to match the appropriate Japanese characters to the appropriate word or phrase. The second realize on the player determining if a specific sentence in English are an equivalent translation for the characters in Japanese. The third quiz realize on questions that require the player to select the appropriate character that completes a specific word or phrase. The forth and final type of quiz realize on questions that require the player to select the appropriate characters that complete a particular sentence. Each quiz in the game has a time limit and minimum score for passing that the player has to be mindful of if they want to progress further into the game. The minimum score for passing is 50% so keep that in mind when you are in the process of completing a particular quiz. 
The game has a decent selection of menu options for the game’s text dialog boxes.  You have the standard load/save buttons as well as a log (which allows you to scroll through previous text dialog that occurred in the game), configurations (which allows you to set the games save options, text dialog boxes, audio, and screen resolution), Title (which allows you to go back to the game’s title screen), Notes (which gives you quick assess to the week’s lessons), and a Girls button (that allows you to see how much you have filled the girl’s affection gauge). There is also an auto button (allows dialog text to automatically progress with out the player’s command) and a skip button (that gives the player the option to skip dialogue they have previously read). The skip function in this game does skip the text dialog but still has the character animations go through their normal movements. This can be irritating when replaying through the game because you don’t have another option to get directly to the character events or the in game quizzes other than this slow skip option. 

The character animation in the game is nicely done and really do help with the story’s overall progression. The character animations are still but this does not detract from the story/imaging because the character images are switched out enough that the emotions/feeling/setting that is being established works with the characters that are in a scene.

I felt as though you might want to play this if you were trying to boost anything you might be missing, if you were studying Japanese in a real class. The test may have annoying and repetitive questions however, and not always are they totally accurate. 
The art style was cool, especially through some of the date sequences; the dating function was pretty straight-forward and basic. And the characters weren't hugely in depth enough to distract you from ""School"", but it gave enough depth for a bit of emotional attachment. The game is labeled ""Nudity"", but the most you'll see is bathing suits or some revealing clothing; if it really had any sort of sexual content the people making the game would have labeled it that way. And some choices could use a heads-up so that you can tell whomever you chose to pursue will like or dislike the dialogue, the stats for each woman are basically saying which one YOU like the most. The dialogue is basically the same for every option you choose, and sometimes there are some typos.

Problems/Suggestions

Every test they give you the same question multiple times.
60 seconds is so short that I'm afraid new learners will struggle. It may increase later but I can imagine some people would struggle
It be cool if there was a writing segment ( trace it with your mouse or maybe if this game was on tablet)
Maybe actual homework where you can make your own sentences 

I noticed some spelling and grammar mistakes here and there. Nothing too often. 

Story is not too bad. It's a typical visual novel with the main character being surrounded by women who find him the most interesting person in the universe. Not a bad thing, it's fun to be around women. All of them written very differently.   
I really have no interest in playing the game again to romance other characters because there's no super fast skip button. Just be sure to pick someone in the beginning and grab every opportunity you can with them. 

There might be a sequel and I'll definitely buy it. 
It would be cool if they had games like this for other languages.",1564134429,1564134429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Это классическая визуальная новелла, где в нашем распоряжении имеется пять героинь: Хелен, Сара, Миюки, Профессор Сайто и Дин Ояма. На всё про всё игроку даётся 12 недель, за которые он должен пройти 12 тестов на знание японского и заромансить одну из понравившихся барышень.

Отличительной чертой этой ВН является то, что к игровому процессу добавлена интересная механика обучения основам письменного и разговорного японского. Автоскипом пройти её не получится, ибо придётся потеть над прохождением еженедельного теста на знание пройденного материала. Благо разработчики позаботились о том, чтобы игрок имел возможность в любой момент освежить в памяти любой из пройденных уроков перед началом теста. Сами же тесты построены следующим образом: нужно лишь выбрать правильный ответ из предложенных. При успешном прохождении задания игрок получает возможность продолжить игру. И так до следующего теста. Немного усидчивости, внимательности (или удачи, если вы такой же ленивый как я) и всё получится.

[b][u] ПЛЮСЫ [/u][/b]

[b][i] + Саундтреки[/i][/b]

Приятны слуху и не надоедают. Эта новелла одна из немногих, во время прохождения которых не возникает желания выключить монотонную, быстро успевающую надоесть музыку. Поскольку здесь она таковой не является.

[b][i] + Разнообразие [/i][/b]

Игра даёт возможность воспроизвести любовную линию аж с пятью героинями. Как правило ленивые разработчики ВН ограничиваются 2-3 девушками с шаблонным поведением, выйти на рут которых не составляет вообще никакого труда. Здесь же каждую из барышень мы можем пригласить на целых 5 свиданий.

[b][i] + История главного героя и диалоги [/i][/b]

Прописаны добротно и интересно. Зачитывался монологами, эмоциональными всплесками, душевными переживаниями и ситуациями из жизни каждой героини. Это, в свою очередь, наделило их своими уникальными чертами личности и неожиданными гранями характера.

[b][u] МИНУСЫ [/u][/b]

[b][i] - Недостаток выборов реплик главного героя, очевидность воздействия выбранной реплики на отношения с героинями [/i][/b]

Во время игры мне не хватало как самой возможности влиять на развитие сюжета выбором собственных реплик, так и некоторой загадки их правильности. Текущий уровень отношений с барышнями можно в любой момент посмотреть, нажав соответствующую кнопку. Это меня немного огорчило, поскольку лично я люблю, когда результат выбора реплики невидим и также невидимо повлияет на дальнейшее прохождение.

[b][u] ПОД ВОПРОСОМ [/u][/b]

[b][i] ? Уроки японской грамоты [/i][/b]

Здесь я воздержусь давать какие-либо комментарии т.к. я полный профан в японском. Оставляю систему обучения данной ВН на растерзание игрокам, кто в этом разбирается. Отмечу, что для полного дилетанта такие мини-уроки могут оказаться весьма полезными хотя бы для того, чтобы решать необходимые для прохождения тесты.

Если говорить о минусах:
Изучение японского как бы есть (это плюс, наверно), но выучить так вряд ли что-то получится. Разве что азбуки запомнить… но это и без игры делается просто и быстро. При этом, в «тестах» возникают проблемы (て как слог азбуки и て как 手, то есть «рука»). Очень много повторяющихся вопросов и дублирующихся ответов. Тем, кто японским интересуется, будет, скорее всего, скучно. Тех, кто японским не увлекается, игра вряд ли заинтересует.
Интересна же игра попыткой сочетания VN формата с обучающей программой. Попытка не совсем удачная, правда…
Если подобные эксперименты разработчиков вам любопытны, то игру можно брать. Если вы ищите программу для изучения японского, то нет, это не то.

I have finished the game and would like to offer my first review for a game in steam.

Love Language Japanese is the name and a love of language learning is the game.

The games starts with a scenario that requires regular testing and gives the reasoning behind the requirements to consistently pass the tests,. Along the way the story provide the side incentives of growing the connection with the various love interests and this is a nice break from a purely lesson based approach to learning a language.

The pros
The lessons are broken down to small easy to remember sections of the overall material.
Each lesson has a key point (so its not fully random in the progression of the learning material)
The tests are timed so it forces to think quick enough to make the knowledge second nature.
There are quite a few lessons though the term.
being able to review at the end of each day both with a mock test format and before moving to the next day allows for revision at every step of the way.
The other characters are interesting and though in some ways made cliche by the number of dating sims out there are still worth putting effort into.

The Cons
There could be more types of testing formats to further cement the new material.
The audio is very limited and adding the full list of words in audio would help (this would also help creating an audio only test)
Max is prob the most annoying character in the game.
The naughty side is very mild (this is also a good thing for some) but when providing a reward system giving something a little extra for perfect scores would add a lot of value to the game play.
And lastly the game talks of multiple years of learning Japanese but is only the first year, this makes the games overall material fall short of actually earning the Japanese language. 

In conclusion the game is a great start to learning Japanese and is a fun game to play even if only for the love side of the game, but it could be improved greatly with more language content and even a word database for simply increasing ones ability to comprehend Japanese as a whole. and is worth the money (esp if on sale)

TLDR: its best to buy this game only if your looking for a light way into learning the Japanese language and not as a one stop shop to actually learning the Japanese language as a native speaker (there is still much learning to be done after finishing the game)",1559149123,1559149123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1. All of the tests are timed. You only have 60 seconds to answer 10 questions. It's not a big deal at first, but once the questions start becoming more complex and take longer to read, it can feel like you're being rushed. The time limit does eventually increase but not until much later in the game. I strongly recommend you familiarize yourself at least a little bit with hiragana and katakana before playing, since you will be expected to be able to read pretty fast at times and it may be overwhelming for absolute beginners.

2. There are a LOT of typos and grammar mistakes in this game. There weren't any so bad that I couldn't understand what they were trying to say, but there are some lines here and there that you can clearly tell were not written by a native English speaker, and it kinda messes with the flow at times. Nothing too major though.

3. If you're here looking to learn some Kanji, you're gonna be disappointed. There is only one lesson that teaches you any Kanji, and it's not until the very end of the game. It's not really a problem per se, but I think it's something worth mentioning for those interested.

But seriously, this game is neat. The plot is decent enough. Not amazing, but I wouldn't expect it to be. I wouldn't recomend it if you don't know *any* Japanese. The quizzes are better for review than learning I think. Especially given they have the annoying feature of giving you the same question a couple times in a row sometimes. 

It covers the material you'd need, but again you'd have to watch the lessons a few times and if your goal is to learn Japanese there's YouTube videos that do it a bit better. But again, it's a good, if basic, review tool.

There's a few other visual bugs I've run into, but mostly nothing major. Some typos as well, although I haven't noticed any in the tests, just in normal dialouge. There was one lesson where the text wouldn't load and I was stuck, but good old ""reload and spam spacebar"" worked fine. At least the autosave worked well :p

But really I enjoy this game. I'm not quite finished, but the characters are cute, the story decent, the japanese language review solid. The bugs are annoying but they're actively patching them.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] 
This game has good potential. If you can not wait, try it now. It has enough value. Of course, there are some shortcomings. If more content and voice support could be added to this game, it will be surely even better. At least through this game you will definitely experience the magic word 'love'. It may remind you of some precious feelings. Yeah, it may vary from person to person, but I hope you will get both learning and pleasure through Love Language Japanese. Our Steam Nyanco Channel highly recommend it! Lastly, the love language Nyanco-chan tells you is as as follows.

Unlike its rivals, the pacing is quite fast, which is refreshingly challenging. You learn about 15 characters + 12 words every week. If you're a beginner, this is not a game that you could keep playing without making some actual notes irl. Don't expect to rush through the game just to date the girls - you likely won't remember everything they've taught you (which gives you a game over). Of course, you could always savescum, but then what's the point? Just buy a regular dating sim/vn that focuses more on story and character development.

I do have a few complaints though: 
1. Protagonist does not have a name. This makes it difficult to tell apart his speech, his thoughts, and general narration.

2. Certain words in quizzes have not been learned in previous lessons. E.g. In the pop quiz after lesson 4, word ""Wings"" appeared but was not covered.

3. Interaction is a bit fragmented. For example,[spoiler]before you pass the first Saturday test, there's some dialogue with Sarah, where she's worried about you failing and tells you that she'll wait for you at the house. However, after you pass, she's not there anymore. I called her and went to her location (I think at the park?), and she seems to be have completely forgotten about our conversation earlier.[/spoiler]

4. Continuing from #3, speaking of[spoiler]Sarah, she tells you quite a bit of personal detail during your first time alone with her. Maybe it's intended and she's just an open book, but it felt a bit awkward and out of place.[/spoiler]

5. Lastly, the MC's personality is a bit inconsistent. He's usually shy and awkward when [spoiler]Helen and Ms.Saito tease him, but is somehow able to lecture/scold Helen when she accidentally made Sarah feel bad.[/spoiler] It just felt out of place.

Not game-breaking, but I believe if all of these minor bugs were fixed, this would a near flawless game. If I could add things to the game, one big one would be coming up with a new way for the studying sessions. A lot of the time, it asks the same questions and when you're only given 5, it can be really repetitive. Another thing I would add would be adding Sunday as a day to interact as well.

The storyline and relationship progression feels like an early 2000's eroge game with quite a bit of steroetypical characters, but it's pop quizes and lessons are actually quite informative.

I've gotten as far as lesson 5 and I was surprised that certain sentences no longer contain romanji (which I've never been mucha fan of).  This makes the level of progression quite intuitive. That being said, I'm not sure how effective the lessons are considering I already know hiragana and katakana and some of the explanations seem to be pulled off some of the more popular language textbooks minus the in-depth explanations. So for absolute begginers at Japanese, it might not be a good starting game. There's also the fact that there's no voice acting, which may affect how non-speakers read the text in their heads.

Also I am factoring in the fact I have only played up to week 2. However, I do wish there was more engaging dialogue within the game's first few weeks. I understand the the first few weeks are supposed to build the foundations for Japanese, however I do believe that engagement is an extremely important aspect in order to both enhance the experience, and keeping the player engaged and immersed within the game. So far, while I agree with the responses that the protagonist is making, and do enjoy his humane and fleshed nature which is a nice contrast to traditional visual novel protagonists, I don't quite get the same feeling from the girls in the game. The dialogue of the girls is quite static with barely one line of response so far to choices. I would like the game to do more than just express one line, especially in these first few weeks where it is important to keep up motivation for newer players of the game. But also I would like to see some time management done in the game. The days feel so short and I find it a little disturbing that I can somehow study forever into the night XD. All jokes aside, I do think that the first couple of weeks in terms of story feel a bit rushed which does ruin the pacing of the narrative. I hope that this game does improve as I keep playing.

Além do básico que todo jogo e curso grátis ensina, sobre os caracteres e algumas palavras, o jogo aborda a questão gramatical, explicando sobre particulas, pronomes, etc.

Sobre o relacionamento dos personagens eu não sei até que ponto vai, como tem a tag de conteúdo sexual, estou 1000% motivado, seria uma excelência um jogo que se dispõe a ir tão longe dentro da sua temática, visual novel com o ""plus"" de aprendizado. Mas devo ressaltar que as interelções entre os personagens são curtas e vão direto ao ponto, acho que ficou ideal, sem perder tempo com assuntos desnecessários que você logo perderá o interesse em ficar lendo.

-EDIT
Apesar das tags o jogo não tem nudez nem conteúdo sexual, o mais perto são os os frames de beijo (sim, é um CG estático com as falas) e as famosas cenas no banheiro onde a mulher ensaboada lava as costas do personagem, mas o protagonista está com uma toalha e a parceira ou de biquine ou com uma roupa de banho escrota.

Se quiser tirar máximo proveito do jogo reocomendo que baixe os app para smartphone (2 hour hiragana e 2 hour katakana), tira 1 ou 2 semanas para aprender todos esses kanas e depois estuda a parte gramatical no jogo. 

Estou decepcionado pela falta de putaria, levarei isso em conta caso a empresa lance outros jogos. A historia não é ruim apesar de tudo, só comprei pelas portarias e não recebi isso. Nem nudez, nem peitcholas. O que eu estou fazendo da minha vida?

Te enseñan primero Hiragana y vocabulario, luego Katakana y más vocabulario, sigues por frases simples como decir: ""Gracias"" o ""Esto es una computadora"" y me supongo que luego seguirán los kanjis. Eso si, el juego está en inglés así que tu experiencia con el juego será inglés-japonés. 

Cada día tienes interacciones con las chicas por las mañanas, luego vas a una clase de japonés y puedes salir por la tarde a platicar con la chica de tu elección, por las noches se te da la opción de repasar todo lo aprendido ese día y anteriores, y la verdad si ayuda mucho, más que nada por el vocabulario, y porque pasar los miniexamenes diarios/semanales son necesarios para progresar en la historia. 

La música es tranquila, da una buena ambientación y las chicas tienen una personalidad bonita, típico de este tipo de juegos, claro está, pero ayuda mucho al ambiente de aprendizaje.

Si no sabes nada de japonés mas que lo que has visto en anime o así, te recomendaría que te tomes con calma este juego, tómate el tiempo con cada día que pasa, repasa los carácteres que ves cada día, pues para las 3 semanas in-game, ya debiste aprender todo la escritura hiragana y katakana. 

Espero te guste este juego.",1547437368,1547437368,True,43,0,0.807779490947723389,0,True,False,False,False,,,

OK writing, not great learning pacing. My only real COMPLAINT is the error with SHI being written as SI which isn't a japanese sound. 

A few english typos as well. A few ""you go it"" and such. 

Change SI to SHI please :)


Edit: I have to say it's starting to look pretty sloppy. LOTS of english typos, the story is kinda lazy and the tests need a lot of refinement. You can get the same question 4 or 5 times in a row.

Some known bugs/problems I've came across so far:

1. Minor typos with the language lessons and dialogue
2. The majority of the time, loading a save causes the music and sound effects to cut out, sometimes not returning until the next day
3. Sometimes there's no music after a scene changes
4. A lot of times when the scene changes to the house, it cuts to the beach sunset scene for .5 seconds
5. Sometimes loading some specific scenes causes it to be replaced by the beach sunset scene
6. Reading notes when the day just started sometimes restarts the day after reading the notes
7. The volume configuration (not sure if its the same with other settings) resets after the game is closed
8. Saving the game on the lessons screen and loading it will cause the white board/backdrop to be messed up
9. Some CGs in the galleryare unlocked before you even get that CG in the playthrough, for me, all sarah and helen dates were unlocked before I even got to date 3
10. Not sure if this is intended but a person can be in 2 places on the map at the same time, this happens when they normally should be at one place but they also call you out to a date at another place

None of these are game breaking bugs by any means but it would be nice to see it get fixed",1547400536,1547863538,True,31,2,0.767812371253967285,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But  a just failed in English ,I afraid I can't remember to learn Japanese.

Love Language Japanese on this game not have Japan voice or English voice,BGM  feel not good.

in fact I find it highly objectionable,because many English words have to look up the meaning in the dictionary

hahah... When I come across a new word I consult the English dictionary，simultaneously studying English and Japanese.

I'm bound to say They are very charming and pretty girl 

Repeated click audio makes me bald and I hope it improves a lot more in future .
