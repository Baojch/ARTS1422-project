TLDR: Tabletport Grade. Uses drag and drop and click commands unevenly. Perk system locks you in one strategy that is repetitive.

Interesting art & style. Fairly complex unlock paths. Possible to upgrade yourself in a corner and having you go back to grinding. User interface conventions are straight out of touch interface. Hold-Drag-Right structures to open menu? Plotting entrance and exit portals with the portal spell is very finnicky. The level select overland map was well presented. Having a limited amount of building spots and having to balance income, unit production, and special cooldown powers is a good idea. Game allowed you to right click for basic additional info on units although not very detailed or useful tooltips.

The problem is that it takes a variety of special ressources called orbs on top of regular skill points to unlock perks. Which in turn are needed for everything, from units, buildings, upgrades... You can replay matches andyou can acquire orbs through campaign play but they are far and few between.

What ends up happening is that you apply the same strategy over and over again in the hope that it works. It is possible to reach a point where the difficulty is too high for your current unlocked perks to overcome and there is little you can do about it but grind.

The game uses asymetric powers, with an emphasis on your team having to fend off a stronger fighting force early on and usually taking over by placing towers and making smart use of rock paper scissor dynamic the game has at play.

Conclusion: Has a decent enough foundation but the progression using orbs, the repetitive nature of the gameplay and akward interactivity with the interface prompted me to remove it permanently for declutter.",1504074073,1539048377,False,1,0,0.453426927328109741,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- The ONLY con I have encountered thus far is a personal preference: 

When you pick up a new card that was just created, it automatically wants you to play it to the battlefield. This is incredibly annoying as sometimes I want to pick up cards just so I can get the next ones going. 
I do not see an easy way around this, since you must pick and choose which cards you will throw into your inventory and then use. Also, if the card went to your inventory and then you needed to click it again, I am positive people would complain about the extra click. I can see where this would be a great benefit in the app version, but on PC the extra click is meaningless.

Currently I hit the ghost level as a brick wall and will most likely need to go down one of the other paths.

Game clearly is a port, it does have limitations, virtually no settings available apart from sound controls, ALT tabbing will take the game out of fullscreen (easily fixed by pressing ALT Enter afterwards), keybindings are locked (although this does not matter because the game is easy to control by default), and pressing ESC at any time will close the game immediately.

Theres the bad part, clearly not a huge amount of effort went into porting it, but its still playable.

The Good part, the tactics are reasonably deep, the game is not easy, comes with a fairly complicated advancement tree and from what I can see so far, quite a few missions. The tutorial explains everything in a natural way that is easy to learn, but hard to master.

Also, to the people complaining about the requests for the player to 'swipe' over a building, saying that this is impossible for a PC, they are idiots, who did not actually attempt to simply drag their mouse from left to right using the left mouse button. That is what swiping means, and despite the general lack of features, swiping works just fine.

Overall for this towerdefence genre, given its price at about 3-4 USD, this game is easily worth your time.",1393127892,1393127892,True,9,0,0.544687926769256592,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game doesn't explain itself well and the tips it does offer it directs you to a forum post on the official forum for the game, which it alt tabs you from the game. When you do return back to the game it either crashes the game or puts it into windowed mode and guess what the options menu doesn't give you the option to go full screen again. Talking about the option menu, it's awful it has a sound option and how long you've been playing thats it. No resolution, no key bindings nothing just turning up or turning down the sound, I don't know what genius thought ""This'll do"". Don't press esc or the game will turn itself off no confirmation just boom off. The achievements are bugged it doesn't tell you when you get achievements and when you try to look at what achievements you do have it just gives a list of the all the achievements but with no breakdown as to what you have and what you're missing.

The gameplay is basically a 5 lane system, where you send your respective animal (cat or dog) down the lane of your choice to try and get to the end of the enemies lane and destroy their building that they have put in that spot. Obviously the CPU does the same as well to try and attempt to beat you. There are 4 different classes standard type soldier, archer, cavalry and artillery, they each have there own strengths and weaknessses for you to figure out which lane to put them down to be most effective(If you think this is a standout great feature on a strategy game, you're a moron).
You also have traps and spells and other smaller bits. Whilst playing I find myself questioning though where the CPU gets the funds to build some of the stuff they have as im scraping soldiers together and it sends them out in droves as well as littering the field with traps. 

Even 2 hours into the game im really struggling, I'm not a beginner at tower defense games but the learning curve on this game is appalling. The tutorial is lacklustre as well teaching you the very basics and then not really following through with further lessons as you unlock more items. It has a talent tree which is supposed to add some sort of depth (again if you think this talent tree is good you're a moron, even WoW has a better one and Blizzard destroyed characters talent trees like a year ago) but really all it is, is for you to use extra stuff in battles the problem is you need this stuff in the beginning of the game so effectively you have to grind losses and the occasional win to get experience to unlock the skills you need. 

Yes the game is cheap but so are other better games, you can even go on trading sites to swap TF2 keys for better games for a cheaper price. Don't make the bullshit excuse of it's good value for money, a happy meal is good value for money doesn't mean its worth buying because of what it will do to your asshole the next day. Don't buy this or game or do its your money this is just what I think about the game.",1393091486,1393091486,False,76,1,0.722871959209442139,3,True,False,False,False,,1393186628.0,"Thanks for the feedback, I hope that the latest update addresses some of these issues.

-This game is a bit unbalance .  this game is expecting you have a very good learn curve because the AI is already strong from start . You can easily lose first few missions .

-Five buildings/Five Lanes is not enough?  The main of this game is to use your pets to destory 3 of the building on the opposite side .You got 6 types of main building in 5 lanes , in early game you dont have much choice  usually 2 dojo, 2 bells and 1 other .You couldnt really play with your style like (1 dojo 2 school + others ) because this game is too focus on units ,strong magic is good but without a unit you cant even win the game. You dont have choice and have to go for 3 dojo because oppoents is doing 3 dojo as well .

-first units of  production of the Dojo is random so you cant control your first 2-3 pet type be , you lose your first 3 moves , you lose the game.

- Theme is not suitable ?  There are not much difference between Ninja cats or Samurai dogs.They have same classes so they have same skills.Even the start place of the story are the same. so you can really change cats to fishes , dogs to bears .


Although the below video I played is in Chinese , lets see how strong the AI is (but they are sucks at building)

This is correct, it is random, but you can remove that unit and it will start building the next unit you have queued and it will carry across the build time as a percentage, so you don't lose anything if you wanted a different unit for your first unit. Hope that helps."

Yes this is a mobile port. So if you dislike these games, just avoid this one. Now for anyone else who wants a review for this game let me continue on:

This is a lovely little game. I really like it. First of all, it's just simple Tower Defence. So imagine a lot of gameplay style like Plants vs Zombies and Ironclad Tactics. You build certain building, you deploy units and they fight with the enemy. Each unit has his strong and weak point, like I said simple Tower Defence. So if you like these kind of games. You're on the right track.

Next thing I wanna adress are the graphics and the sound/music. Don't expect anything fancy here, again it's a mobile port so you have to work with that. Yet I have to say the graphics suprise me very well. Both the cats and the dogs have very good looking sprites and the units are easy to reconigize. Also the music is what really sells me in this game. Remember Okami or Okamiden? Well that kind of music is what you are gonna get in this game, it really helps to strengthen the mood.

So anybody looking for a fancy story? Well, I have to hold you there. Nothing to big of a story here. Also the controls are still set to the phone version, so swipe and wipes are expected to happen. One note I have to attach to that one is, that in some cases that might cause slight problems with Windows 8. But you can work around that.

I would really recommend this game to people who loved Plants vs Zombies or Ironclad Tactics.",1393018155,1393018155,True,58,0,0.672363460063934326,2,True,False,False,False,,,
