While it might not excel as a language learning tool or stand out as an RPG, it offers an enjoyable approach to mastering Japanese characters and would highly recommend it to anyone trying to learn katakana.

The gameplay involves defeating Katakana enemies by selecting the correct sounds, a concept that's both innovative and fun for those willing to overlook its RPG flaws. The journey to completion takes approximately 10 hours, accessible even to casual gamers.

However, the game's design would benefit from some refinement. Navigating through all 71 characters is cumbersome; a simpler character stepper for the constants and vowels would of enhanced the learning experience. 

Only the basic attack is linked to character recognition, limiting the potential for deeper engagement with Japanese. Incorporating mini-games for spells or status effects could enrich the gameplay and learning experience.

Moreover, the game underutilizes reverse recognition exercises, where players identify Katakana from sounds, an equally crucial skill. Additionly the final boss introduces an interesting concept—forming words with monsters—that could have been effectively integrated throughout the game for vocabulary building but which was not.

The Enemy variety is another area where the game falls short, with repetitive encounters that detract from the learning experience. Introducing varied enemy types based on phonetic features could make memorization more intuitive and enjoyable (like a sounds being fire type/s sounds being fast/dakuten being unaffected by physical attacks).

The story is... there. I'm sure whoever wrote the game knows the quality of the story they wrote.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

[b]Reviewer:[/b] Kiba Snowpaw, a 36-year-old seasoned Furry Ice Wolf gamer from the frost-laden world of HowlStrom, mastering the art of ice magic.

[h2]Introduction: A HowlStrom Warrior's New Challenge[/h2]

In the heart of the icy tundra of HowlStrom, where the snow whispers secrets of ancient magic, I, Kiba Snowpaw, found myself enthralled by an adventure not just in gaming but in language learning.

As I embarked on this journey, each Katakana character transformed from a mere symbol to a formidable adversary, challenging both my strategic skills and my newfound linguistic abilities. Battling these Katakana creatures felt like facing the fierce blizzards of HowlStrom, where each victory was a step closer to mastering this exotic language.

[u]Educational Value: A Furry's Perspective[/u]

Diving into the depths of Katakana, the game provided me, Kiba Snowpaw, with a comprehensive guide to mastering this aspect of the Japanese language. Each character was introduced with visual animations and audio examples, reminiscent of the ancient runes and chants of HowlStrom shamans. This educational journey was not just about memorizing characters; it was about understanding a culture, a language, and integrating it with my furry identity.

[strike]Storyline and Adventure: An Ice Wolf's Tale[/strike]

The storyline of the game is an epic tale, resonating with the adventures and legends of HowlStrom. As I ventured through this digital Japan, I encountered various characters, each unfolding a new chapter of the story and deepening my connection to the language. These characters became my allies, my pack, as we fought together against the shape-shifting monsters of Katakana.

[h2]Conclusion: A Howling Success[/h2]

""Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War"" is a rare gem in the gaming world, offering both entertainment and education in a single experience.

This is the second game in the series (the game teaches you hiragana), and has vast improvements.
There is voice acting now, and you can win affection over your comrades like a dating sim, granting them extra abilities in battle. The story is a bit generic, but more effort was at least put in than the first game, and you even get your own snazzy apartment with its own theme song.

No more random encounters! you can just walk around enemies if you don't want to fight.
The menu is much better, you can now see all of the vowels (a,i,u,e,o) arranged all mostly in one big square screen, making it easy to select characters (even with the mouse, and you can now select enemy targets with the mouse too).


There's an interesting mechanic (that was present in the first game as well) that switches it up so you need to input the katakana radical instead of the romaji - I like this as it reinforces your learning even more.

The soundtrack is J-Pop and traditional Japanese Music inspired, and is way more catchy and fitting than the last game, The boss battle theme rocks way harder than it should. Sounds like something straight out of a modern anime. If you are a fan of JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, you will feel right at home. 

You could probably learn this stuff faster though a textbook or online, but lets be honest: playing a video game is way more fun and engaging. And the coolest thing is that you will actually be able to use the stuff you learn in this game in real life, so it's like you level up in real life.

Katakana War is an educational RPG developed by Sleepy Duck and released in January 2017 1. The game is designed to teach players how to read and write Katakana, one of the three writing systems used in the Japanese language 1. The game is set up like a classic 16-bit RPG, where you play as the protagonist who is learning Japanese from a teacher. The game has three chapters, and each chapter introduces a new set of characters to learn 1.

The game has several pros. It teaches Katakana in bite-sized pieces, making it easy to learn and memorize. The game also has vocab lessons and basic grammar lessons that are helpful for beginners 1. The game’s use of repetition to help players remember Katakana is also commendable 1. The game’s price point is also affordable, making it accessible to many people 1.

However, there are some downsides to the game. The music can be repetitive, and the storyline is not very interesting 2. The characters are not well-developed, which can make it difficult for players to become invested in them or the game 2. The game’s use of calligraphy-style Katakana can also be confusing at times, as it doesn’t always match the font used in battle 2.

Overall, Learn Japanese to Survive! Katakana War is a great game for early or casual Japanese learners. It has its flaws but is still worth playing if you’re interested in learning Katakana.

As a sequel: It fixes many of the mistakes of its predecessor, but adds a few of its own. For one it takes place exclusively in Japan now which is a deeply, deeply strange decision for a game about living katakana symbols who can only be hurt by making the correct noise at them. It's not clear why all of the random Japanese people you meet aren't just out there reading the characters instead of relying on six foreigners who are having to learn them as they go.

As a game: It's pretty bad. They tried to make the RPG battling a bit more interesting this time around which really just gets in the way of what you're here for: matching shapes. The story and characters are pretty bad, and the gameplay (while better than the previous entry) is bland.

This is an RPGmaker series designed to help beginner level Japanese student learn and practice very basic Japanese writing. You get a bit of vocabulary and a couple of useful phrases as well.  If you have not studied Japanese before, I would recommend you do the games in order (despite the first game being a bit annoying in some areas gameplay-wise).

The good:
There are quite a few improvements over the the first game (hiragana). 
From a learning perspective, you now get to hear the sounds of the characters while you battle. You also get to see stroke-order demonstrated when you learn.
Sidequests provide bonus vocabulary and sometimes unique weapons and consumables.
It's now easier to navigate the answer selection grid during combat.
The turn-based combat itself has been streamlined so that you will never end up targeting an opponent one of your other characters has already dispatched.
The character designs are modern and appealing.

The meh:
It's an RPGmaker game. Don't expect Elden Ring.
The Danganrompa style voice acting is obnoxiously cheerful and cringey. Luckily you can FFW easily enough.
The affection systems between characters are kind of half-baked. I did get some bonuses by spending some more time chatting with a couple of my party, but it mostly seemed like a distraction.  In fact, I would have preferred fewer characters but more depth back-storywise.
It's an educational game, so don't expect a meaningful story or overly challenging puzzles apart from the memorization necessary.

The verdict:
As a language instructor and JSL learner I would say this is a good supplement for Japanese students who also have a soft spot for vintage 8-bit and 16-bit RPGs. Despite having learned Japanese for years, I still have brain-farts where I mix-up ""sa"" and ""se"" or have no idea what ""wo"" means. If you're interested in learning Japanese for the first time, just pick up the whole trilogy, especially if it's on sale.

Прежде, чем задумываться о покупке данной игры, стоит обратить внимание на первую часть - Hiragana Battle. Как катакана учится по канону после хираганы, так и эта игра проходится после. Их даже связали хронологически.

Удивительное.
Поэтому и акцент я буду делать, скорее, на различиях, позитивных и негативных. Нападения противников теперь не происходят внезапно - их видно на карте, в том числе примерный уровень сложности, можно даже побегать от них. Больше не нужно вздрагивать при каждой встрече. Партийцы теперь обладают более живыми характерами, которые, впрочем, состоят из клише и какой-то одной ключевой черты. Каждый представляет какую-то страну, и Россия тоже есть. За нее девушка по имени... Миша. Или это парень в платье и сережках, я так и не понял. Японцы и не такое могут придумать. Еще ввели ачивки в единственной игре этой серии. Но достижения - это сомнительное достижение, как видно ниже. И наконец из грустного - пропали битвы на словах, теперь только слоговая азбука. Одно слово будет - в финальной фазе финального босса, но это очень слабое развитие идеи. В первой части было гораздо веселее и продуктивнее.

Плюсы.
- По-прежнему можно неплохо подучить или повторить катакану. Как основной источник знаний, я бы эту игру не рекомендовал, но как дополнение - почему бы и нет. В этом ее ключевая ценность.
- Большой плюс в сравнении с предыдущей частью - теперь атаки делаются не просто текстом, его сопровождает начертание и озвучивание.

Минусы.
- Игра проходится за счет хорошего знания катаканы и базовой прокачки - просто докупайте снаряжение и бутылки лечения. Почему минус? Магия не нужна вообще, всякие прочие зелья, временные усилители и прочий микроменеджмент - лишь пустая трата времени. Погружения не организуют, процесс обучения смажут.
- Еще одна сравнительно бесполезная механика - развитие отношений. Да, она качает показатели, но не сильно. Но нужно прокликивать много графоманской болтовни, и авторы решили завязать на эту механику адовую ачивку. Помимо вашей основной партии придется качнуть прочих потенциальных участников, а для этого нанести вместе в боях по 500 ударов на партию. Да, очки получают все сразу, но лишних партийцев четверо, а свободных мест в партии 3, так что придется кликать 1000 раз.
- И подарком за вот этот безумный гринд будут дикие тормоза в финальной сцене привязанности для каждого партийца. Как они умудрились так положить графику в игре на RPGMaker, я до сих пор не понимаю.
- По-прежнему никаких ассоциаций, мнемоники, только зубрежка и гринд.

В общем, как JRPG игра слишком быстрая, простая и блеклая. Как тренажер, пойдет в комплекте с какими-то другими техниками, учитывающими ассоциативное запоминание.",1680572580,1680607787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Oyunda her bir karakterin nasıl yazılacağını gösteren görsel animasyonlar ve her bir karakterin nasıl telaffuz edileceğini gösteren sesli konuşma örnekleri bulunmaktadır. Oyuncular Katakana şeklini almış düşmanlarla savaşa girerler ve hasar vermek için onları doğru şekilde çevirmeleri gerekir. Oyuncuların bilgilerini test etmek için oyun içi sınavlar da mevcuttur.

Відгук буде поділено на 2 частини: оцінка гри на оцінка саме системи навчання. Такої ж структури я притримувався коли залишав відгук на 1 частину (Hiragana Battle).
Почну з оцінки гри. Якщо порівнювати з першою частиною, то в цілому вона стала краще: 
 - з'явився вибір персонажів для подорожі. Їх по суті можна поділити на 2 по вмінням і характеристикам: воїн та маг. Що вже краще, ніж в першій частині.
 - з'явився показ ХП у ворогів;
 - нова механіка;
 - гра стала легше - в 1 частині місцями було складно, тому потрібно було хоч трохи та гріндити, тут в мене один з персонажів вмер лише 1 раз і то через розслабленість;
 - з'явилася озвучка персонажів, хоча на жаль не всюди, але приблизно в 50% діалогах, в 1 частині її начебто не було;
 - діалоги такі ж більш-менш реальні та теплі;
 - саунд, як на мене, став краще і досить гідним. 
До мінусів я би відніс:
 - неповну озвучку, хоча і не сказав би, що вона тут дуже потрібна;
 - змінювати екіпіровку у персонажів досить не зручно, адже потрібно робити лишні рухи для переходу до наступного персонажу;
 - сюжет такий же простий, як і в першій частині, й, в цілому, нецікавий. При цьому з'явилися завдання по типу ""вбий 6 ворогів"" та ""знайди вихід"", що тільки все погіршило;
 - сайд квести теж прості: ""вбий ворога он там"", ""купи мені випити"", ""знайди легендарту пляшку енергетика"" і т.п.
А тепер до більш важливого - систему навчання. В порівнянні з першою частиною вона практично не змінилася. Виправили деякі помилки, такі як різни шрифти при анімації та показі символу, вимова символів/фраз стала гучніше. Більш детально про цю систему я написав у [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/125889599/recommended/438270?snr=1_5_9__402]відгуку до першої частини[/url]. З мінусів я би виділив для себе шрифт символів під час їх вивчення: вони написані наче чорнилами, що не дуже зручно, коли ти намагаєшся писати їх ручкою. В цілому, ця гра допоможе вам вивчити Катакану й при цьому збільшити запас слів (хоч в сумі й дають близько 70+ слів, але уваги їм приділяється мало). Я це кажу зі сторони того, хто вже знає Катакану, тому не можу достовірно сказати наскільки сильно підвищиться вміння читати й писати, але закріпити знання мені допомогла.
І, як і попередню частину, можу порекомендувати пройти Katakana Battle для тих, хто починає вивчати японську, і не має огиди до простих JRPG ігор.",1677426128,1677426128,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

I'll just point out the differences 

It's pretty much the same thing with more vocabulary and more side quests.
There's also voice over and the characters feel way more alive.

The main thing is the combat system which is way better.
You actually get to see the katana warriors on the map and when you go near them you get into combat mode (you can avoid them if you want). Basically the same thing as Paper Mario, no more random combats at every single step.

You play your characters one by one and not all of them at once like in the first game and you can also see in which orders you and the ennemies play.

You actually get to hear the pronunciation everytime you pick the corresponding hiragana character in combat, which is quite a nice extra feature to help you memorize them.

I can say it's a huge improvement! 

Here the pro's: 
Before playing this game I had zero knowledge of Katakana,
and this game nailed it! I totally can write/understand the Katakana now.

Side quest are also very helpful for extending your learning curve.

Nice story about the Obake, or better said Katakana letters that taking over Japan. 

Later on in the game you unlock a place where you can always go to, where you can train/challenge your memory on all the Katakana letters you have learned.
They call it shape-shifting monsters that are in that place, but are actually Romajii letters, where you have  to combat with the right Katakana letter, and the other time in a battle it's Katakana, and you have to choose between the right Romajii letter that fits that Katakana.  
It's a nice place where you can challenge yourself in what you have learned.

Improvement with this game is the turn base.
In the previous game(Hiragana war) you have to select the right answer in a row for your whole party,
if one of the Hiragana characters where killed and your last party member gonna take a blow, then it's automatically the wrong character, because he give his attack to the undefeated hiragana, and so it is the wrong hiragana, because his attack was meant for the defeated hiragana.
In this game you have turn base, and attack with one character at a time, instead of all your party members at once.
if this is vague, you gonna understand, or understand already that it is a huge improvement with this game Katakana war! 

Also selecting the Katakana characters is a huge improvement, if have to relate it with the previous game Hiragana battle. 

So, lot of improvements!

Now the cons..

First of all, 'and it ruined my experience in the story'
the voice acting is horrible, and if I am honest it  would have been better without voice acting.
Also the repetitive sounds by the characters, makes the experience frustrating. 

Also the static images that represent the characters, were also a disappointment.. 

Further if you are for the learning and are 100% committed to ignore most of the cons, then this game is for you! 

I completed it 100%, so my review is very honest. 
But be prepared, the voice acting is horrifying/cringe,

so you don't necessarily need to know Hiragana, but i would highly recommend that you play part 1 nontheless,
this is a sequel afterall, it will teach you Hiragana, some basic grammar, and they don't cost that much.

They even added voice acting, it's not really ''Troy Baker'' quality, but it does it's job ^^

Why? Because it made learning Katakana easy and fun![/u]

[b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] I played this entire game on my phone using JoiPlay so my hours don't match: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cyou.joiplay.joiplay&hl=en_US&gl=US

Katakana is such a great game that I was able to learn Katakana fluently in 1 month in real time, 24 hours in game time. Comparatively, it took me from 2021 October to 2022 May to beat Hiragana Battle with the same amount of in-game time, 24 hours. Why such a long difference? Because Hiragana Battle was not engaging, it was clunky, and it felt really outdated just 5 years after release.

Here are the five things that make Katakana Warriors a great game:

1. [b]Hiragana Heartburn[/b]
Virtually all of the issues I detailed in my Hiragana review are fixed. It's easier to select Katakana characters, the characters play the sound when they attack, etc. https://steamcommunity.com/id/patpeter/recommended/438270?snr=1_5_9__402

2. [b]The characters Were Great[/b]
Each character is truly individual, changing class as you level each one up, unlike Hiragana Warriors where each individual character did not have their own personalities really. You actually become invested in each character. Kyoko is like Rei Ayanami, you can't help but root for her to come out of her shell. The characters spurred me on to complete the game.

3. [b]Voice Acting is Good[/b]
I can't remember cringing at any of the voice actors, so I'm giving this game an A for voice acting. The only thing I do remember is that there are parts where it will be voice-acted, the next few lines aren't voice acted, and then it goes back to voice acting. That took me out of the immersion of the game, but did not happen often as I recall.

4. [b]Combat: Fighting and Turn Order[/b]
The combat is much better in this game than Hiragana Warriors, as mentioned. Fights actually feel real, like the enemies are dynamic and their attacks are dynamic. All of the stats for your characters make sense. The game shows the turn order for each character/obake in the top right of combat. In Kanji Combat, it doesn't show turn order and the stats make no sense because each kanji is an instant-kill.

5. [b]Quests are Very Educational and Logged[/b]
Katakana Warriors has educational quests that help to learn Japanese grammar such as verbs and adjectives beyond just katakana words (Hiragana warriors basically just focused on words) and a quest log that allows players to see what each quest was about (each quest has a theme).

Of all these games I would suggest playing Katakana Warriors first and then learning Hiragana elsewhere, or just memorize Hiragana through rote memorization and then play this game.

There are substantial improvements over the first game in the series. 

The fighting mechanics were very improved, no longer as basic as the first game (though still pretty similar to it). In this one you actually see the enemies before they attack you (it's substantially less annoying/tiresome).

The gears, shops, missions and et cetera were more filled out (and more abundant).

The story was not really improved upon, however there were several more characters (and playable characters at that) which added to it.

I actually liked the soundtrack from the first game better. This one was clearly a bit higher production, but most of the tracks from the first one were better (at least to my musical taste). However, the new tracks seemed to not be repeated as much and never got to the point where any of them bothered me (which is an improvement).

The writing was... astounding. In my review of the first game I said it was a masterpiece of an 'ironic drama' because it made me cringe so hard that it was funny. This one took it even further. It blew past the funny side of cringe right around back to the deeply painful side. I was in physical pain every time there was a cut-scene. It takes real writing ability to make something so cringe inducing. Whoever wrote this is clearly a connoisseur and master of cringe. This is the work of a genius. In terms of pure torment, the pain conveyed is equivalent to the tragedies of Shakespeare (albeit a completely different kind of pain).
After praising the writing so much... I hate to bring it up... but there is a typo in the sequence after the last boss (of all places). 

All in all, this is an okay game (better than the first for sure), and a great learning tool (about equal to the first game).

Sadly I have a problem with the controls. You can switch between wasd-controls or arrow keys (or you can create your own costum layout). On my PC however the game failed to utilize the wasd layout for some reason. The log file also said that there is an error regarding the key-layout change.

I've been living in Japan for 3 years now, learning the language as I go. Arriving with zero, I've slowly built up a basic understanding by means of textbooks, broken conversations and language-learning applications, of which this is one.

I'm embarrassed to say that, in spite of my growing proficiency, there were still some fundamentals which I was struggling to hammer into my caveman brain. My knowledge of katakana, a writing system which I had glanced over within my first weeks in Japan, had since been left unrefined, and I would often blank on the readings of certain, less frequently appearing characters, such as メ(め) and ヌ(ぬ). 

Cue [i]Learn Japanese to Survive! Katakana War[/i], an educational [b]RPG Maker[/b] adventure, set in Japan. I think it's worth assessing it through the lenses of two seperate paradigms, first as a game, and second as an educational tool.

[b]A S / A  / G A M E[/b]

As a game, Katakana War certainly provides a decent chunk of story, though it's nothing particularly special. お化け(ghosts) have appeared throughout Japan in hordes, taking the form of Katakana. These spirits can only be vanquished if a human speaks their reading. This seems like it would be of little effort for native Japanese speakers to solve, but maybe the ghosts appear as difficult English words to them or something, I dunno. For plot convenience, you and a group of foreign-exchange students are the only ones who can quell the menacing apparitions.

The turn-based combat is very straightforward.  The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't exactly riveting by itself. You mostly wander through a relatively barren map and encounter battles along the way, which function roughly as pop quizzes, but with lethal consequences for failure.

Side-quests are unchallenging time-wasters, where you're typically sent somewhere to get a thing and return. At least you're given some very rudimentary vocabulary and verb conjugations as a reward for completing such tasks, but it feels like a missed opportunity to not use the information you've already been learning for side-quests. For instance, if we were asked to find a cola, there could be a specific vending machine out there somewhere with 'コーラ' written on it in katakana, so as to test your reading comprehension a little. We're instead left with a smattering of mundane fetch quests that do little to justify their existence, save for the reward at the end (disregarding a couple of quests, which actually ask you to source specific items using your katakana knowledge, I just wish more missions had been formatted this way).

The banter between the characters wasn't really for me, and I didn't find myself particularly invested in the plight of anyone. The dialogue felt like dialogue, rather than real people having genuine interactions. This wasn't helped by the fact that all the characters illustrations only have a single pose to work with, a piercing, beaming grin. When at one point the charismatic crew narrowly avoided death by explosion, they were still unnervingly grinning from ear to ear, all the while expressing supposedly genuine concern that the incident had nearly taken their lives. One or two pose variations would have gone a long way towards making the characters more expressive and relatable.

There are optimization issues, which is strange to say about a game as undemanding as this, but there were moments of genuine slowdown, especially when particle effects were on screen. 

[b]F O R  /  L E A R N I N G[/b]

For learning, Katakana wars isn't half bad. It takes on a 'drilling' sort of teaching style, but does it in a unique way.

Katakana is one of three writing systems used in Japanese, the other two being hiragana (ひらがな) and kanji (漢字). It's worth noting that [i]Sleepy Duck[/i] - the developers of this title - also have similar games based upon the other two writing systems.

There are 48 characters in Katakana, but this is excluding accents, which change the reading (for instance カ=ka, but with an accent ガ=ga).
Learning all the characters would easily be possible with independent study in a couple of days, using interval-based revision, but obviously Katakana Wars has advantages to its unique presentation and framing of information. Revising doesn't feel nearly as tiresome when framed as a game, and it almost legitimizes drilling as a method for teaching.

The opportunity to face シ(し) and ツ(つ) on the battlefield was long overdue, and after several hours of drilling, it feels good to finally be able to consistently distinguish between the two. 

Unfortunately, as the game goes on and the novelty wears off, it becomes more of a drilling exercise than a game, but the medium at least allows you to forget that you're technically studying for a while.

[b]To summarize[/b], Learn Japanese to Survive! Katakana War is effective at teaching what it's trying to teach. Although perhaps a little convoluted as a learning methodology, it alleviates the mundanity of typical flashcard based study.

As a game it's pretty bad, and I wouldn't recommend it, but as a learning resource for absolute beginners, it might have a place. If you already know katakana and/or N4/N5 Japanese, skip this one. If you're just getting started with your learning journey, this could be worth giving a go.

I think that there is too much voice acting. I'm not saying that's bad or good - just the thing that the input could be put somewhere else.

Overall - developers did improve the gameplay itself - they brought better mechanics and solutions (especially, that's quite faster and skill menu is more readable) - but enemies have more HP what's quite a nonsense for me. If you know the answer and enemies are fairly easy (it's not like you give bad answer and die in two hits)... why would you prolong that ""test""?

Plot is nice, characters are nice - but I have a question. Why can't you do a (let's say...) ""bromance"" team? Here are only two male companions. When forming male-only or (let's call it that way) ""reverse-harem"" team, you cannot really do that without having a handicap of empty slot in your team.

Last talk with one of the companions is... ""laggy"". Game stops working smoothly - text doesn't show up, just like the scene struggles with loading.
^ Just like in every RPG - save before talking with companions (just in case). Waiting is advisable - game should slowly unfreeze after a while. If you want a smooth animation - after finishing the whole dialogue, you may save on the new slot and reload the previous save - it should be working fine then.

Learning:
There still is lack of reliable revision/repetition segment where you can go and repeat what you've learnt (challenge me game, hmmm?). Instead we've got ""reversed learning"" site (finding character to written syllable), which wasn't available at all in Hiragana Battle - but don't be too enthusiastic - you cannot gain experience points from it.
I feel that side quests are made nonchalantly - メープル ケーキ (maple cake)- was it hard to put it in the quest? 

Still relying on 1 to 5 scale.
3,5/5 - I would say.
There is minor improvement (quality of life I would say) to the previous methods and game is really well done visually, but the methodology itself is not efficient enough (and still the same).
Completing every lesson took around 11 hours.

Katakana War improves on one of the biggest issues I had with in their first game (Hiragana War). Game play now goes turn by turn, rather than queuing everyone up. This is a major improvement, since you don't end up wasting a turn trying to hit something that's already been killed. 

The game graphics and music are both much improved over the original, with the visual novel style working well for laying out the story. The story lines with each of the characters in the party is a nice touch as well. 

Unlike the first game, this game only uses katakana for words that would typically use katakana (except, perhaps for Daisuke's name, since it would probably be written in kanji or hiragana). The vocabulary words present you with 5 katakana words, and 5 hiragana words in each vocabulary lesson.

In the first one, they did give you a bit more testing on the vocabulary words. This one only gives you about 3 mini-tests; one vocab-to-katakana word at the end battle, and a two quests where you have to buy items at the store.

The middle title is dedicated to Katakana, the writing system used for words of foreign origin. It’s the natural system to learn after Hiragana, since it shares a lot of elements. For the most part, it’s just different characters for the same syllables.
Once again, it’s alright as an educational tool, but isn’t enough by itself. It guides the player in using a notebook for writing the characters and corresponding romaji, while gradually introducing the characters in lessons spread throughout the game chapters. It teaches you how to write them, and the sound associated with them. Thing is, you’ll probably look at the notes a lot, which doesn’t help much with memorizing. For effective learning, you need other tools and find your own learning pace, but I suppose the game is limited in what it can do. It does what it can. It also teaches you some vocabulary and other rules, but they’re even worse because they’re never used in-game, they’re just exposition.
As a game, it’s still an RPG-maker title, but fortunately, it’s leagues above Hiragana Battle, which felt very generic and uninspired. Here, it actually feels like a proper game, and everything from the first game got revamped for the better. The combat follows the same principle of needing to answer with the correct romaji that matches the enemy Katakana character. It’s still a bit repetitive, but it helps you memorize through repetition. Sometimes it will reverse the matching, and there’s no word matching on the final dungeon this time, which is a bit disappointing. It was annoying in the first game, but at least it felt like a proper way to escalate the difficulty for the final level.
Fortunately, no more annoying random encounters everywhere! All enemies are visible on the map, so you know when to fight. It makes exploring dungeons more enjoyable. Magic and items are more useful as well, especially towards the end of the game. There’re AOE magic attacks, more focus on speed, more status effects (some even persist after battle), and even ultimate attacks! It’s not a lazy afterthought and adds much needed variety to combat.
Another big improvement is the story and presentation. There’s a lot of focus on your party members, with plenty of interactions and character development. There’s even voice acting and an affection mechanic where you bond with the characters you use the most. They’re also varied and enjoyable. The main plot is weaker, but it focuses on the characters. Each represent a different class as well, although some as better than others. The story is also slightly bigger.
Some stuff, like dungeons, loot, and side quests, still feel generic and uninspired. But there’re plenty of small improvements everywhere, like a better soundtrack and combat interface (selecting an answer is now neatly organized). There’re even achievements this time around!
Don’t get me wrong, the game isn’t amazing, because as an educational tool it suffers from the same issues Hiragana Battle did. As a game, it’s nothing special either, but a massive improvement over the first game. It made me appreciate the sequel more. And since Katakana is a separate system (and easier to write as well), you don’t need to play the first game to enjoy Katakana War. For this game I can actually give it a positive review and recommend it for what it is. It’s nothing special, but it’s good in its own right.

But this game is great. I could see that the Devs definetly improved and improved a lot of things that wernt that great.

Lessons: You got a total of 10 lessons were you learn 5 words at the start and in the last 2 lessons only 3 including the Dakuten. Also you get taught a few vocabulary sometimes too.

Side Quests: There is a total of 20 Sidequests in a lot of places easy find ith the ! above them. You get Vocabulary and items from them.

Obake: The enemies you fight. Compared to Hiragana (I only played a few hours) you got the switches between the characters and the Romanji (English letters) which is nice and helped me learn them even better. (Was one of the bad things in the first game)

Battles: The battles arnt random (besides the boss monster) like in Hiragana, but are shown as characters or a ? on the map. So you dont have random encounters. Also sometimes you got a quest when entering an area like kill 6 enemies.

Characters: I looove them. Each one got a unique character and voice and the interactions in the scences are just fun and fitting. I enjoyed every one of them and how the groups friendship improved over time. 

Affection: You can have 5 hearts for each character that chose the affection they have for you. At 1, 3 and 5 hearts you got a cute interaction with the specfic character and a buff to their stats if you choose the correct answer when talkign with them.

Team: You can choose 3 of the 7 Character to join your team (You the maincharacter cant be switched out. Everyone with their own unique traits. You start with 3 and get to know the others along the storyline. I stayed with the same team combination of Daisuke Owen and Tia and only switched for raising affection of the others.

Challenge Castle: This is an unique place where you can practice all characters you learned till now (in Katakana or Romanji) with a healing spot nearby which can be killed with 1 hit. You dont get any experience or money from them so a simple place to train.

Achievments: It isnt a must have but a nice addition to the game that lets me keep easier track of my improvment. I am an Achievment hunter so this was even more rewarding for me.

Overall a great game when you want to learn Katakana and some Vocabulary. I wrote everything down an it helped me a lot learning it easier while I was learning Katakana in another course.

So much. They never were fun, they typically were just rote memorization and provided no clues as to how to more effectively learn. This was a loooong time ago, folks. So if all the newfangled games kids get when computers are more than the Compaqs of my day are awesome, then I'm sorry, I don't know how to express that I really enjoyed learning katakana in this game. Though, to be fair, near the end I was just spamming through the dialog because they tried a little too hard to make the game humorous. Anyways, pick this up if you want a cheap learning game that will help you learn the katakana alphabet.

So, what's the good, bad, and in-between for ""Learn Japanese to Survive! Katakana War""? I'm about to break that down.

Good: Learn lessons at your pace. Learn the syllables and the dakuten syllables at the same time. So much free gear and upgrades, I didn't even need to worry about money. There's a story. You can grind affection in the challenge dungeon. The game started off hilarious, imo. Andrea calls you all sorts of cute names that I absolutely loved. A game absolutely for beginners of katakana. Options to speed walk through the game. Options to remember last syllable chosen.

Bad: Game bugs out when each character besides Daisuke gets their level 5 affection special. The antagonist of the story made no sense, but sure, we'll go with it. 

In-Between: Battles are very forgiving. Learn words that might be helpful. I can't tell you when knowing how to pronounce or spell ""oven"" is going to be useful in life, but I sure learned it! You have to grind affection in order to get the full affection achievement. There's very little reason to actually buy upgrades as the game gives them all to you. There's very little reason to not buy upgrades, as you'll be rolling in the yen that the game gives you. The game attempts to stay humorous and doesn't quite hit the mark the further along you go. Affection earned is for being the best of friends, which sucked when Daisuke didn't want any of my male MC's D. Voice acting, you can take it or leave it.

The game could use some polish, but the system and art seem much better than their previous version ""Learn Japanese to Survive! Hiragana Wars."" I liked the story (sort of, the ending was...), and I'm sure it helped that I started katakana from scratch without prior learning. It was neat to learn new words from doing quests, but I think it would have been really cool to have those words worked into conversations in the game. Besides one quest, there was no real use of what I had learned of the alphabet. But, overall, I think this is a great game. I'm not sure how much mileage I'm going to get out of it now that I've finished, though you can apparently revisit any area for practice once you beat it.

The fighting system was changed to turn-by-turn which is a big improvement so that you party does waste attacks. Also, the katakana selection screen layout is far superior to the Hiragana War... you no longer have to keep scrolling down to find the right symbol. All the symbols are shown on the same page. Also, each time you attack you get an audio sound for the character and see the stroke order every time. I definitely recommend this game to help memorize the katakana.

One thing I don't like is that there are 2 characters that they made confusing. One is ""di"" and the other is ""du"". they call it ""ji (D)"" and ""zu(D)"". It was a little confusing until I figured it out.

Next, I understand they were trying to make the game more interactive. But, the voice acting is annoying and the story is very juvenile. I found myself just clicking through the dialog as quickly as possible. They tried to make this too much like a dating simulator. But, it is just a minor complaint that I don't hold against them for trying too hard. 

Finally, it would be nice if they provided mnemonics or pictographs for the characters to help remember them. I had another website open with katakana pictographs to help me memorize the characters.

Bottom line is that this is a fun way to practice katakana. It is slower than using flashcards, but I appreciate the fun factor. I definitely recommend this.

+ можно пользоваться заклинаниями типа ""Молния"", которые наносят неплохой урон вплоть до 0 ХП, но победить врагов можно только назвав их истинное имя (катаканой или романдзи);
+ есть квесты на изучение японских слов по темам ""Знакомство"", ""Места"", ""Еда"" и прочее;
+ неплохой сюжет, связанный со спасением страны от злых духов, принимающих облик катаканы / романдзи. То есть, вполне логично рассказывается о том, как так произошло и зачем мы сражаемся с буквами :D ;

Overall pretty fun for a bit...Not great but not bad.

Learning...
I already knew katakana before playing, so I may not have the most accurate account of learning from scratch. However, it does seem like it would do the job. It takes the time to give a lesson on a set of katakana. After, you have a mission in which you will have to fight katakana of the sort you learned about, as well as previously learned sets. I did find it nice that the game will teach you words and simple phrases too. This is scattered about the game in dialogue and such.

Gameplay...
It's an educational game, so it's not entirely made to be a purely entertaining and thrilling game. It's a bit clunky for sure, but I can't knock it too hard based off of the game's nature. Does get a bit repetitive but this could be expected as you are trying to memorize the katakana. Affection levels and events are a fun add in.

It's a hit and a miss at most time. It improved most of the  issues Hiragana Battle had.

First and foremost if you're looking to learn the Katakana characters, look no further. This is the game. If you're seeking for more than just the characters, this isn't the game.

Personally, it did seem daunting at first to learn another 20+ characters following Hiragana. You know,""you can't teach an old dog new tricks""? Well, I certainly felt like that and I can say I think I got a good grasp of the Katakana characters and more or less.

Gameplay:

The great addition to the game has to be voice over, it added a lot to the 'dating sim' genre and made the characters more alive than just text and a picture on the screen. The downside, there's only three scenarios per character to complete, but considering the length of the game, it what it is.

The ability to swap party members was a great addition, however, the game just threw almost all the characters at you at once, and since they're all low level, grinding them felt tedious and unless you're going for 100% achievement, don't bother, find the characters that work for you and stick to them.

This time around, they added a way to see who's next to attack, it made it slightly easier clear the Katakana characters without taking damage. They also cleaned up the attack menu to fill up to four attacks per line instead of two like the previous game.

They also included more magic and each character had their own unique spell, but spell itself is way too broken. The only saving grace about spell is that you can't defeat them with magic alone.  In all cases the Katakana characters are left with 1 hp and is forced to be finished with their corresponding Romanji. It made no sense to use spells most of the time, just continue practicing and learning the characters using regular attacks.

Couple big issues that should have been addressed since the game has been out for awhile. Back in Hiragana Battle, you can use WASD to move, and in this game you can select it, but they never worked.

Another issue, at the beginning I said, this game is great to learn the Katakana characters, but anything else you should seek an alternative?

Well, learning the vocab is nice, however, unlike Hiragana Battle's final map of the game it had enemies in Hiragana vocabs. This game gets you to learn the vocab, but don't ever make use of them and there were never any encounters of Katakana vocab monsters at all, until the final boss that makes you use カタカナ (Katakana) in your attack option. 

In the end, it achieved what I wanted and that was to learn the Katakana characters, however, in terms of learning it was a one-step forward and two-step backwards. 

If you want to learn the characters, go for it! 
If you want to learn vocabs, don't bother.",1611968331,1611968913,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The ""answer"" attacks now display an animation of the character you're using to attack, so it's less punishing than the previous iteration in the series, as if you end up not using the correct character, you'll now know what that character (you used) looks like, in order to go ahead and learn, instead of getting a bland ""miss"" sound effect along with no damage done whatsoever.

There's also a lot of new vocabulary to be learned across the entire game (unlike, once again, LJTS: Hiragana, that would only teach you vocabulary really later on) and they've made the lessons more straightforward, removing the second writting animation (thanks) and sticking to a same design for the writting animation and example character.

Also, the new characters give you a lot of freedom to create a party that fits your needs. I for one was running Daisuke, Charlotte and Kyoko for the high-damage and survivability from the fact that I had 2 high DPS characters and 3 healers (Protagonist, Daisuke and Charlotte are good healers. Daisuke and Kyoko are good DPS characters).

The VN segments they added make the characters seem a lot more interesting than in the previous game. 

Well, you get me. It's better in all aspects. Some could say this is due to the fact that you'll be learning Katakana after learning Hiragana. But I'd say, this is proof of the fact that these devs have taken their time reading the reviews and improving their game based on that.
As with the previous game, this could be a really nice introduction to the katakana system. I'm feeling really confident in the fact that I'm now able to read both sillabaries thanks to this game series, but I didn't have this as my only source of learning, and I didn't really bother writting up the characters, nor making any kind of notes. This, however, would be most appropiate, as it will help you learn better, and will also help you in-game, as it would be a reminder about what characters you're facing. Either way, I decided against that, because that would be kinda like cheating I guess? I prefereed to commit them to memory the old fashioned way.

Either way, I highly recommend it to anyone trying to get their first steps in the japanese language. I'm using this game series and Duolingo myself, at least for the time being.

To learn a language one must repeatedly encounter it again and again, and by having the enemies you grind for XP be the words you know is like having continuous flash cards over and over. 

This game is really good at teaching you the core katakana letters. One potential issue is that you might start associating the symbols with their position in the attack menu rather than with sounds, but just make sure that you think of the sound or symbol before opening the menu and you should be fine. Another issue is that some areas aren't repeatable, especially the area where 'n' monsters were concentrated, which can make it hard to revise certain sets of katakana. 

Main bad thing is that the game goes over some bits of katakana really clearly, especially the little symbols (like the small 'tsu' that means you need to double the next consonant). These are mentioned, but not practised in game, so you might need to check them out separately. I ended up going to wikipedia to grab more info.

In my case, it's more of a review of the second language that I learned in high school and then didn't use for nearly a decade, so I'm just trying to brush up on the written language again. 

As far as gameplay features, the music doesn't loop very well and ends and restarts abruptly. There are spells in the game and they actually have uses this time around, unlike the previous game, but that's only because they have a few mage characters that can't do normal attacks very effectively. Considering the amount of characters, I wish the ones not in the party would level up with the group, even if there experience out of the party was reduced by 25-50%. Because they don't, some areas were artificially difficult as I tried to level up everyone somewhat equally. Sidequests are very basic, but are fine for a small and simple game like this.

The game just hangs on the experience screen and either takes a long time to load or wont load at all unless you switch the game from windowed to full screen and back multiple times or try using the mouse and a controller over and over again.

The game can teach you to write and read katakana, but its use for learning the proper pronunciation seems limited. While all the syllables are voiced, male and female characters often pronounce them in a different way, leaving the player confused as of which one the right version is.
Examples:
WA is pronounced as WA by the female characters and UA by the male ones.
WO is pronounced as WO by the female characters and O by the male ones.

More importantly, Katakana War is more refined than its predecessor, so it might be a bit rough to play HB after KW. In katakana war, random enemy encounter system is removed which makes the game more fun and dungeon crawling less tedious, the companion system is improved and you can have more versatile team strategy (in hiragana battle you had a fixed team with limited options) and the anime-like music/bgm made the game more enjoyable.

You(the protagonist) are able to restore your or other character's health if it is low and every character(not include the protagonist :( ) has 3 special abilities to help you fighting Obake easier.
Awesome fighting system, and some of them are golden Obake(For example: パΩ) which is very rare!!!
Japanese speakers to pronounce every Katakana; for the first time playing I thought that Alec Shea would pronounce every Katakana but actually won't.
Awesome Music Collection.
Form your best team with these characters.
Cons:
Only 10 chapters on this game; it should have 11 chapters after learning ワ ヲ ン,
You can only form your team at Osaka that caused time wasting.
Not much randoming your enemies, especially chapter 9 and chapter 10.
Some mistakes of Katakana database existed like トゥ is ""tu"" not ""to(ト)"" and ドゥ is ""du"" not ""do(ド)"".

However, my opinion of the voices was changed as soon as I heard the voice of the main villain. Holy shit, she is spectacular.

There are standard RPG elements & magic spells that don't involve learning Katakana too, but, obviously if you're not playing the game to learn Katakana, there are MUCH better RPGs out there.

The story is ""enough"" that it's not just a flash-card game, but other than the novel enemy design, it is a completely generic and mostly boring RPG. I'd even say some of the character dialogue is ""cringy"" at times. But if you let yourself have fun, it *is* much more fun than flash-cards. The main draw of this game over a traditional course is that it feels good to correctly identify the enemies (Katakana glyphs) and ""defeat"" them, and it feels good to ""level up"".

My main criticisms for this as a learning aid would be: 

1) I would like to have more fonts shown, to see what Katakana really looks like when it's not calligraphy. They show it sometimes, but not often enough.

2) It took conscious effort not to learn the characters by *position in the attack menu*, but by their strokes. I would really like an option to randomize the order for the attack menu, but having them in a consistent order did make it easier to learn them too, so it should just be an option that can be enabled/disabled during battle maybe.

3) Some of the RPG elements detract from studying. For example, every time Tia uses her maximum friendship spell, she says the name of the spell out loud, in English, and I have to try and ignore it because it is distracting and takes me out of ""Katakana mode"". You don't have to use the spells, but they are helpful for the RPG part of the game.

Overall, yes, I can recommend this game as a learning aid for Katakana. It kept me interested in the subject long enough to learn them all, and I imagine I'll keep coming back to the game if I need to refresh my memory.",1595335778,1595335778,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It has a more engaging story and charismatic characters; you can see the enemies on the map so you're not forced to fight all the time; it has better visuals, even though it still has that 'RPG Maker' look it clearly looks much better than the first game.
The voices are cool but a bit cringy sometimes.
Only thing I missed is having diagonal/8 directions movement, since the maps are kinda big it would make exploration more enjoyable.

And yes, it does teaches the Katakana alphabet very well, so it's a good way to learn or to reinforce your knowledge (which was my case).

Got me hooked and finished in 11 hours. You can finish in 10 hours because my computer crashed and an hour worth of save was gone. I picked the swift gecko, maybe wrong choice as its not the strongest character but to deal the most damage pick Tia, Daisuke, Owen in the beginning and after you unlock Kyoko change Owen with her.
Tİa: Strongest and has great defence. Dont use magic spells.
MC (Swift Gecko): Great strength and Magic, defense is a bit low but equip the best things on yourself and its no problem
Daisuke: Pretty much matches MC, his ultimate is handy, slightly better defense than MC
Kyoko: Not so  strong at attacking but if you use magic spells she is the best.
Owen: Strength is as good as MC but lacks magic damage. Slightly better defense.
Mischa: Good attack but weak overall.
I don't recommend using Charlotte and Andrea.

I  couldnt do it but to do max damage in a battle let Kyoko strike first or second so she can deal huge damage with magic spells and it will take 1 hit to finish every enemy one by one. In my case always Tia stroke first and MC could finish only 1 enemy so the battles lasted longer overall.

I made a mistake by playing this first as this is the second game, but i will start the other one  later.

Story is good characters are good (except Charlotte, she is annoying imo).

During affection events it would be better to answer more questions rather than 1 but its ok.

Would like to have access to Kyoto and Tokyo in this game but i guess they are for other games.

Katakana War is a great stepping stone for learning Japanese. You will need to supplement the game with other resources (I recommend using this guide for the first game https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1573508156 but instead use the Learn Katakana page from the Tofugu website that it references here: https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/) and you will need to go beyond the game once completing it, but it is a great start. 

Unlike the first game, this game also provides a Challenge Castle that allows you to practice previously learned Katakana characters. It also has a few nice JRPG touches, like an Affection system that encourages grinding but is actually a guise to review old material. I recommend trying to get every achievement in this game if only because doing so will strengthen retention for the most part (some achievements are just for fun but are easy enough to get that you might as well as try). Superficially, the game also has a great soundtrack, just like the first game. And the story is about as enjoyable as a story that can be concocted for an educational game masquerading as a JRPG but I still enjoyed it.

There are a few nitpicks, though. For example, there is some minor slow down at parts, but never enough to destroy enjoyment of the game. I also encountered a few times where my game refused to save, but exiting and re-entering the menu remedied that. The game also promises that you can re-map keys but I was unable to get this to work.

That said, this game is a great start to learning Japanese. Playing the first game, Learn Japanese to Survive! Hiragana Battle, is recommended but not needed. You also do not need to necessarily memorize much of the vocabulary in this game because once you can read Katakana, most words become instantly recognizable. This is because Katakana is mostly used for foreign loan words and these words are often borrowed from Romance languages and English. Therefore, once you can read the Katakana, you can usually understand the word provided you can read or speak English or other Romance languages.

All in all, you could definitely do worse for a game that takes roughly 13 hours to beat, so I highly recommend it if you have any interest in learning Japanese.",1591775009,1591775009,True,1,0,0.537773370742797852,0,False,False,False,False,,,

On a serious note tho, Daikatana War is a sequel of Higurashi Battle, still being a multimedia edutainment. It doesn't exactly require you to beat Hiragana, it even threw the plot hook down the window. So, education and entertainment.

For entertainment part, the game is a big improvement over the complete amateur bedlam that was Hiragana. They actually got an artist to draw character. Seems like they got music that isn't exactly self-made but isn't part of RPG Maker stock. Story is less stupid than Hiragana plot and semi-works at entertaining you somewhat albeit the new inclusion of voice acting is easily multiplying the cringier parts by ten. The rest of the stock assets was used in a way that it doesn't look too out of place. Katakana War has a look of respectable RPG Maker budget title. Kudos to devs for actually improving instead of sitting and sitting and sitting and sitting.

The combat now has a system where you give orders to individual characters and they act immediately, so you don't ultramegakill a single kana. It also seems to go faster in how it feels? Answer menu is now sorted like a proper table that fits to the whole screen, bringing joy to mouse users as well, as game has improved interface, you can actually point at Kana here. You still have to click and double click more than you should be if you are using mouse, so it's not quite there yet.
No more random battles either, all enemies encounters are represented as characters you can avoid in overworld. And less grind required, I feel.

There are more RPG elements, such few equippable items that aren't just direct upgrades in stats, having to build up a 4 member National Japanese Empire party from 8 chars and date them. Actually, no dating, more of hanging out after you battle enough, just small dialog. I am pretty sure this feature was taken from whatever jRPGs are popular now, I haven't kept up since 90s, it sure has little meaning there as all characters are cliches in personality... and same-face syndrome but that's same as saying ""anime"".

The balance however was still not quite on par. It started out semi-interesting in combat, with more bosses, and all that but half-way through the game I have managed to get a party and equipment that I could beat every non-boss encounter without a single loss of HP or MP, the spammable ""once per battle"" 0MP nuke of a magic that one of characters learned after doing all the dating scenes being the key. The idea that magic can't kill enemies by itself got annoying. And I never needed major healing powers, minor was still healing everyone perfectly.

So entertainment is fairly there but sadly edutainment remained largery on the same level.

The game is mostly only good for somewhat reinforcing kana characters in memory. Sorta. There are no true random battles, yes, but I still think that what formation you battle is still taken from few presets for each area. The picking of kanas per area was better than in Hiragana but I still felt annoyed at repeats of same battles as well as well, as felt that I rarely met few particular kanas. In the end, the best way I memorized katakana is by making myself write down a whole table of what I learned from memory each night, as I was slowly playing through the game. Yep, multiple sessions. If you are the power gamer who beats games in a single day while using guides, you are an idiot and an amateur in the wrong hood. Overall, it's still a bit weak in reinforcement and you can beat the game while not really memorizing the whole table correctly.

The variety battles when you encounter romaji and have to give the answer in kana are complete failures, just like in Hiragana. The systematically sorted answer menu allows you to easily cheese it by figuring out where such romanji would stand without actually remembering the kana writing.

The game is happy to give you random phrases and words as rewards for side-quests as well as random vocab lessons with barely any reinforcement. No, immediatelly quizing in 5 seconds once doesn't count as proper reinforcement. Not even for final level. Yes. That's right, my ever vigilant reader from whomsth hawk eyes see every spec and sliver. I was complaining about final level in Hiragana doing exactly that. But first, I would have been happier if I was properly reinforcement through whole game. Second, in Hiragana the phrases were random and the only good fundamental usage of it, the numerics, was used only once at final battle. However, vocab challenge would have fit to Katakana War as katakana words are often loan-words, making it easier to guess their meaning. It would have been perfect here, not in Hiragana. What a waste of potential.

Overall, hummmmm, I don't knooooooooow. 6 years ago I have abandoned learning Japanese very early at Katakana alphabet (I like to excuse that I was busy being a student), while now I actually memorized the table while playing this game as supplemental. So I guess Katakana War is good and I shall leave positive review despite numerous faults. But make no mistake, it's good only because of edutainment value it brings alone. If it was just a mere le entertainment, I would have kicked it down the stairs. It still could be so much more, and if better edutainment game comes out, you can forget about this one.

Katakana are one of the writing systems of Japan, used for representing the sounds (rather than meanings) of words.  They represent the same sounds as hiragana, but are used for writing foreign loanwords - the meaning of many words written in katakana can often be guessed by sounding out the word, and recognising the foreign word it derived from.  In this game you have to defend against an army of monsters shaped like katakana by correctly identifying the sound of the characters.

There is a story, a map to explore, and combat against the monsters; these are much better developed than in the first game - the story is much more fun and the exploration is made much better by removing the randomness of encounters with monsters in favour of seeing them on screen before meeting them.  Unlike the other games in the series, you have to make some choices about the equipment to use, as different items emphasise different stats, though ultimately this doesn't make that much difference.  There are also some side quests, which try to teach you a little about Japan, and are sufficiently distracting.

Of course the main point to the game is teach you to read katakana. The game teaches you to recognise the characters, it also shows you how to write them, though there is no assessment of writing, so it is entirely up to you if you want to practise writing or not.

In summary, this is a big step up on the previous game in terms of game mechanics, making for much smoother game play.

I already knew katakana in general, but because I do not use it as much as the hiragana, I had trouble telling apart certain katakana characters, hence I bought this game to help me with those few katakana characters I get mixed up with.

This is perfect for someone just starting to learn Japanese. I recommend you get the trilogy. £15 for 3 games that will teach you hiragana, katakana and something like 200 kanji is really a bargain and it is really a fun way to learn the scripts and there is a lot of repetition.

The game is very well made. The graphics are awesome, the kinda old school type, reminds me of ""Zelda"". That is the thing, games in the past were like this, very interesting and unique. The music is really nice. The audio for the vocals of the characters are very good quality, though the guy from Australia has an American accent, same with the Russian girl, same with the German girl. Would be even more unique if the voice actors were from the specific countries the characters represent to give it that extra feel to the game. The story is very interesting.

I really hope the developers make more in these serious. Some suggestions:

1) Make a game focused on learning vocabulary, loads of vocabulary.

2) Make the next part of the kanji learning.

3) Make a game of that sort that will teach all the particles and their different uses with sentences and other grammar etc.

+Art style is engaging and fun

Bad:

+Due to the above, some things felt half-baked in and it really would enhance the game to actually utilize those things (i.e. affection)
+Some characters were....annoying.
+There were a couple bugs that need to be fixed (see below)

Bugs:
+I Played the Mac version and it wasn't until I didn't get my first achievement that I did some research as to why. I then found out that the developer made a statement there was a problem with the syncing....please fix this.

Absolutely, you don't need any knowledge of the predecessor or any hiragana knowledge.

Absolutely, yes, when you successfully finish the game you will have no trouble to read katakana.

- Is it fun as a RPG?
Well, it's short and very basic, so as a PRG game it could satisfy absolute beginners in that genre, but nothing more.

---------------
What does it better than the predecessor?
- Better graphics, better artwork
- FAR better music
- Better battle system (the action choice is not done for one character at a time on their turn and not for all characters at the beginning of the round)
- The enemies are now visible and can be avoided which is a big plus
- Character affection system for those who care about such things
- Better kana selection system in the battle

What does it worse than the predecessor?
- The final boss and the final 'dungeon' phase is way simpler, less challenging and not interesting at all
- The story seems to be even more cliche

LJTS! KW is a big improvement compared to its previous game, Hiragana Battle. While I do say that it is improved, it still is an average and honestly I can even say its a good game, but not the best in the world (but hey not much you can do with RPG maker and its creativity) The following review will go into comparing the two games a bit and what I say is the Pros, the Neutral, and the Cons.

[b] Comparison [/b]

So after playing the previous game (Hiragana Battle) I took time off between playing (about a month) and then played this game within a 2 week span of 40 min to 1 hour sessions. Hear is what I can say about this game.

Comparing this game to Hiragana, this game improves in many ways and basically fixes a few of criticisms I had of the last game (such as the ending in Hiragana was bad and some other elements. Further detail in that review)

While in my last review I said that HB was a good secondary help to learn hiragana, this game for some reason I used it more as a primary, but maybe because of the help of HB maybe made it easier to use im not sure. I still will in repeat memorizing both scripts as time goes on just to keep it in long term memory.

[u] Pros +: [/u]
Study Guides: Just like HB, this game has study guides in-game in case needed to remember some characters. I only ever needed it about 2 times with characters like ス and ヌ or ワ and フ.

Level Design: the level design is pretty good in this game. Only thing that kinda sucked is a area in the game is a 1 time deal to learn the ""Na"" series so only way to reinforce it was study guides or challenge tower.

More Content: this game has a lot more content than HB had, considering I beat HB in 8 hours and it took this game 11 hours, ranging from the Challenge tower, a bit more side-quests, and a affection system (which is good but also has a bit of flaws IMO, more on that later)

[u] Neutrals +- [/u]
Gameplay: For a RPG Maker game, the gameplay isn't too bad. As well as a improvement from HB, Magic has a better and actual usage. I can say combat in this game is practically the same from HB, just when you hit them, it will have the character written out and pronounced. IMO I am not a fan of the pronouncing part but I liked the writing out. and again, the battles like HB are not 100% random, the groups are somewhat the same 3-4 groups.

Story: like HB, this game's story is pretty average

Characters: I think the characters were pretty interesting in this game and better with having more than 4 party members to change out. But at the end, you will have the ""Main team"" that will basically be OP. The affection mechanic was cool to have companions gain extra stats which was cool, but easily exploitable thanks to a guide in the community. BUT the worst part about the characters IMO is the voice acting. I wasn't prepared for the voice acting and I personally didn't like it, especially one character had an annoying voice.

[u] Cons - [/u]
Voice Acting: as I explained I wasn't a fan of it and it wasn't professionally done so it threw me off at times.


All in all, this game is better than HB, but not the best game in the world. But I can say this game was a good learning tool.

[h1] Final Verdict: 7/10 [/h1]

tl;dr: This game is better than its predecessor but not by much. and IMO it was a good primary source but to others might be better as a secondary source

Update (3/7/2020): Lowered score by 1 point as IMO 8/10 felt too generous where 7 feels more right.",1583600529,1583608153,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It feels pretty good being able to play a video game while also learning something worthwhile and valuable in real life (not that I go outside besides work). That being said, the ""Learn Japanese to Survive"" series are [b]more educational than they're games[/b], although they try really hard to be both at the same time, it's not working very well - the game part at least. The first thing I've noticed is how annoying the characters are, they use the lingo of a 12-year old and more importantly, they're all American and/or they speak English natively, rendering them kinda worthless if you're expecting to learn some vocabulary - sure there're sidequests that ""teach"" you vocab that include a native speaker pronouncing the words, but you're not gonna actually remember those unless you write them down and who wants to do that while playing a video game, you might as well just grab a Japanese textbook... But before that, let's talk about the story first. It's dumb and you should skip through it. OK, moving on.
The gameplay consists of study sessions where you learn characters used in combat against Obake (""monsters"", read [O-ba-ke] or as the voice actors pronounce it, [Ohbahke] if you prefer the English way) in a somewhat streamlined way of playing, go and kill X monsters, go and rescue X... besides that, there're 20 very simple sidequests, [b]totaling 10ish hours to complete the game in its entirety[/b]. As is tradition in RPG-maker games, you're presented with a variety of items and equipment that no one really cares about as you're here to learn, not collect legendary loot.
To answer the question you're sure asking, because who the hell plays an educational game for the gameplay - am I actually gonna learn anything playing the series? I could answer with a yes or no, but that would be too simple and simplicity is for autists. In other words, [b]yes it is somewhat useful.[/b] 
To elaborate - for those who aren't profound weebs like myself, the Japanese language consists of three alphabets - Hiragana, covered by the first game of the series, Katakana and Kanji - partially covered by the third game and the most complicated of the alphabets (mostly Chinese characters). 
[b]Now the reason why I'm rating the Katakana game positively while I'm most likely never gonna play the other two games, is because Katakana is the least used of the three alphabets (exclusively for foreign words) and thus harder to practice[/b] as you'll encounter it less often compared to the other two alphabets and let's be honest, I'd do anything to avoid learning from textbooks and spending hours staring at Katakana, trying to remember the characters. I wish the game offered more ways to study besides the obvious ""choose the right character"" and ""assign the character to its pronunciation"", e.g. translating entire words, writing practice, etc.
So there you have it, the gameplay's pretty bad and the story's worse, but I'd still take this over a textbook. 5/10",1580495133,1580495537,True,5,0,0.599325180053710938,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Almost everything has been built upon to be bigger and better, from the art and music, to the writing, characters, and gameplay. Even the educational segments felt better. If you liked the first game, you'll be overjoyed with the experience in Katakana War and you won't want to miss it for the world. 

Katakana War seems to provide a better educational gameplay system, as the menus are cleaner and easier to navigate, and enemy encounters involve more variety in their kana. The problem of ""memorizing"" a group of kana and simply going through the motions is far less severe, as different areas are more likely to include kana from previous chapters as well as providing the challenge of the new kana you've learned. Since Katakana symbols are more similar to each other than the Hiragana symbols, it's more difficult and more rewarding for remembering and interpreting of what you've learned. I especially like how ""older"" kana are weaker than newer kana, and it continues to spice up the gameplay by having you fight the English alphabet, forcing you to find their Katakana equivalents (though I was disappointed that the game includes almost no instances of ""phrase"" making as what was seen at the end of Hiragana Battle, which is a step-down). Furthermore, the gameplay in general has more depth and appeal, as there are magical attacks that are actually worth using compared to just straight answers, and there's seven characters alongside the protagonist to play with--meaning that you get to mix and match parties based on your favourite characters. There's a ""dating"" simulation where you build friendship affinity to unlock abilities, more weapons, armour, and items, and a stat system which is easier to understand. Overall, it's just more fun to play.

The educational component is very similar to the first game, but because they can draw upon your hypothetical prior knowledge of Hiragana and the new Katakana you're picking up, they can share more words with you and provide the proper way to spell them. If I recall, Hiragana Battle would only write syllables in English if you didn't know them, and had almost no appearances from Katakana symbols. This game fixes that issue by simply having the kana ""faded"" out to indicate you haven't learned it yet, so you can still write it down in your notebook to get a headstart. It also mixes vocabulary written in Katakana with vocabulary written in Hiragana. If you wish to practice with a ""flash card"" system, it's easier thanks to the Challenge Castle, which pits you against foes that are defeated with a single hit, but are made up off all the Katakana you've learned thus far, and this is also useful for leveling friendship affinities. As I stated, I was disappointed it doesn't test your phrase-making and memorization of vocabulary, as this helps in reading Katakana overall, but I think it's a fitting successor to the last game.

There's more musical variety, an interesting mix of levels that are solely focused on Japan this time and not just a random fantasy backdrop, and the art has improved a ton. It could pass for something done by a genuine mangaka, rather than an amateur Westerner. One of my favourite details is the inclusion of heavy voice-acting. Though it's a mixed bag, with some awkward and strange acting, and variable mic quality, every actor puts so much energy into their role I can't help but grin like an idiot while I'm listening to it. Every character is so likeable, and their voice is such an inseparable part of their identity.

Learn Japanese To Survive! Katana War reprend les mécaniques de son prédécesseur, Hiragana Battle, afin d'initier le joueur au système d'écriture japonais. Cette fois-ci, au tour des caractères servant en retranscrire les mots et sonorités étrangères. À travers une série de courtes leçons, on sera mené à maîtriser les Hiragana, tout en apprenant un peu de vocabulaire, armé d'un bloc-notes et d'un bon crayon.

Le système de combat d'Hiragana Battle est repris pour ce second opus, agrémenté de quelques améliorations, comme des attaques automatiques au tour par tour, de nouveaux boss et des combats plus animés. L'apprentissage est d'autant plus facilité que les caractères appris dans les chapitres précédents reviennent couramment tout au long du jeu, et pas seulement ceux du chapitre en cours.

So first of all the actual Japanese learning portion of the game is fantastic it helps you learn katakana through giving you the lessons (through showing you the characters, showing you how to write it, and showing how to pronounce it) and you are required to understand the characters in order to beat the game (hence the name of the game and assuming you don't look up the answers which defeats the entire purpose). The game plays as an RPG and so you can enter in combat with Katakana characters, allowing you to remember the characters in an entertaining way.

In terms of a functioning game in all aspects this game is great: good music, good characters, story is alright, and overall it's been a great journey, learning Katakana and having fun in the process.

One thing I recommend is that if you're playing this game to learn Japanese, play Learn Japanese to Survive! Hiragana Battle before this game and if you want Learn Japanese to Survive! Kanji Combat after this game.

This is going to be a review of developer Sleepy Duck’s second instalment in there three part Learn Japanese to survive series that helps teach the basic aspects of the three different Japanese writing systems. In “Learn Japanese to Survive! Katakana Wars” the player will be learning about the Katakana writing system. Hope you enjoy. 
Now in the words of Daisuke Sensei “Its Study Time!”

Learn Japanese to Survive! Katakana Wars is a classic style RPG game that focuses on teaching the player the Basic structure of the Japanese Katakana system. The game does this by having the player participate in ten study sessions where they will learn the 46 Basic katakana characters (which are called Gojuon) along with 20 dakuon, and 5 handakuon (these are modified forms of some of the katakana characters). In the game it also mentions 1 sokuon and 36 yoon characters however, this dimension of the katakana system is not focused on as the player engages in gameplay, so it can only be considered as a side note in the game. There are also different vocabulary words that the play has the option of learning in the lessons as well as during side quest but after these words are mentioned they do not have a specific purpose in the game. Throughout the game’s lessons/side quest it also mentions hiragana characters but does not focus on them since the introduction of these characters were done in their first game “Learn Japanese to Survive Hiragana Battle”. The main aspect of the katakana system that is focused on is Gojuon, Dakuon, and Handakuon. From my experience the game explains this portion of the Katakana writing system rather well and it helps make the memorization of the characters seem slightly more engaging than just memorizing the characters from a book. With that being said, I would say that this game is for novice Japanese learns or intermediate learners that want a referrer of some of the Katakana characters. This game is not made for you become a fluent speaker over night or for you to decide that this will be the only instruction that you will need to make your next big trip to Japan. In short, this game is either a supplemental resource to help you learn katakana characters for the first time or a supplemental resource to help you to reinforce the Katakana characters that you all ready know. Regardless, if you decide to purchase this game because you/a friend/a family member wants to learn Japanese, you/they will still need to buy other books, flashcards, video tutorial, learning software, games, or other supplemental materials if you/they are serious about learning Japanese. Now that is out of the way let’s get to the games story.

The story of “Learn Japanese to Survive! Katakana War” occurs ten years after the events of “Learn Japanese to Survive! Hiragana Battle”. The story begins with four foreign travels that enter the city of Osako Japan with absolutely no knowledge of the Japanese language. Suddenly a series of homicidal spirits that have taken the form of Katakana have started attacking the city with the hope of destroying the people of Japan. The spirits that have emerged can only be defeated by being properly pronounced. This leads to these travels finding a teacher that helps them learn the Katakana writing system in order to help them save the country of Japan. With this being the main primus of the story, it becomes quickly apparent that there is a huge contradiction in this story’s plot and that is “Why do people from Japan need to be saved by foreigners that know nothing of their language when Japan has a country full of fluent speakers?”. It is possible that this plot element could have easily been corrected by changing the setting of the game to a different country that does not speak Japanese. If this was done it is possible that the story would have had a stronger plot. I understand the game was also trying to show players a few cities in Japan but because this is Japan that this crisis is occurring, I found it pulled me out of the plot of the story more than I would have liked. Besides that, I found that the story was enjoyable enough to keep me playing and I found it had a slight ting of humour along the way. Next is the gameplay.

The gameplay in this game has the player engage in turn-based combat where the player has the option to Answer (normal attack), use magic (special attack), or use items in battle in order to defeat their opponent (Katakana Characters) in battle.  The player has the option of fighting in a party of 1-4 in game characters with a choose of seven different characters that you can choose from. The enemies in the game can inflict four negative side effects to the player while attacking on specific levels in the game. These side effects are bleed (drains health), poison (drains health), restrict (restricts action), silence (restricts magic). There are 10 chapters in the game that you have the option to engage in three phases before you move on to the next stage. The first is the lesson stage that the player learns around 5-3 new Katakana characters along with their modified forms. The game focuses on teaching the player how to pronounce the Katakana, the proper stroke order, and the function of the modifiers that are placed on the Katakana. In the lesson phase you also occasionally have vocabulary lessons that teach you 5 words using Katakana and 5 using Hiragana characters.

The second is the side quest phase that the player has the option to look around for side quest/restock health items/purchasing equipment/rest to recover energy. If side quest are completed you will receive a few bonus points that can be used to increase your entire parties level. It is also during this phase of the gameplay that the player gets to view friendship events with your party members. The affection system in the game essentially increases with the players in your party each time you engage in battle. There are a total of three friendship events that give the members in your party increased stats each time you make it to one of the three heart events that each of the 7 characters have. Once one of your party members makes it to their final heart event they will have a moment of enlightenment, which will change their class classification and give them one new special ability. I find that it is also worth mentioning that if a player wants to review any of the material that they learned during their lessons/side quest this would be the phase to do it since all the material can be reviewed at this time. There is also a practice castle that will unlock once you get so far into the game that allows the player to just practice their retention of the materials that they covered with various enemy types. 

The third phase of a chapter is the battle phase where the player has to complete the mission objectives to get to the final boss of the chapter that has multiple health bars of various katakana characters. Once a chapter is complete your player returns to their apartment to rest and start the cycle again. All the equipment that the player can acquire are either purchased, rewards from side quest, and found in chest. There are equitable item drops from the katakana that are defeated, the only thing that is dropped occasionally are shard fragments that can be converted into potions that can permanently increase a character’s stats. Unlike some other games of the RPG genre there are no item drops from specific enemies that gives the player an additional incentive to engage in battle with a specific enemy type.

Из недостатков:
1) затянутые диалоги, которые под конец хочется пропускать. Можно было удалить 30% диалого и только лучше бы стала игра!
2) разарботчики просто ничего не ответили на Мое предложение о переводе игры на русский язык, за 50% продаж в зоне РУ. В любом случае они бы получили дополнительные деньги, а так - просто глупо отказались от денег и не дали заработать тоже. Потому игра ТОЛЬКО НА АНГЛИЦКОМ.

Yay, un RPG éducatif !

Pour vous donner plus de contexte : je me suis mis en tête d’apprendre le japonais avant de partir au pays du soleil levant, et… j’ai un peu trop rechigné à apprendre les différents alphabets jusqu’à présent (faut dire qu’ils ne nous facilitent pas vraiment la tâche avec leurs systèmes de symboles complexes). Pourtant, vous vous doutez bien qu’une fois les clefs de la compréhension écrite en main, il vous est largement plus facile d’apprendre du vocabulaire, d’échanger avec des internautes à l’autre bout du monde et de traduire des dōjins frivoles (ce que je ne fais pas, cela va de soi… enfin, pas pour l’instant). C’est donc avec cet objectif en ligne de mire que je me suis lancé dans l’aventure Katakana et son bachotage relativement supportable grâce à « Learn Japanese To Survive! ».

J’avoue, il fallait y penser. 

À l’instar de nombreux autres J-RPG avec un système de combat tour par tour, vous devez terrasser vos ennemis et triomphez de boss redoutables grâce, non seulement, à vos compétences physiques et magiques… mais aussi et surtout grâce à vos connaissances dûment développées lors de « pseudo-cours » en classe, dispensés par votre sensei des temps modernes. Au programme, 5 signes par leçon (10 dans certains cas) et une petite aventure pour mettre en pratique ce que vous avez appris. Les objectifs sont très simples : vaincre X ennemis, se rendre à tel endroit, vaincre untel… et pour avancer, vous devrez donner l’équivalent sonore des signes Katakana qui vous agressent. Évidemment, plus vous apprendrez, plus le spectre de monstres deviendra large. Prenez des notes au fur et à mesure des leçons, cela vous évitera de passer 20 tours à chercher l’équivalent pertinent parmi une cinquantaine de propositions.

En dehors de l’aspect éducatif, de quelques anecdotes sur le Japon et d’expressions/mots passe-partout, ne vous attendez pas une histoire et des graphismes de qualité. Le jeu a été créé sur RPG Maker avec les ressources de base, l’univers est ultra-plat/simplifié et les dialogues insipides/ennuyants. Pour tout dire, je me contente de spammer les boutons « Skip » lorsque les personnages discutent entre eux, et n’ai aucune honte à l’avouer. Je pense que l’accent n’a pas du tout été mis sur le fond, et que seule la forme est synonyme de qualité (puisque l’apprentissage progressif des caractères nous pousse à terminer le jeu).

Je recommande ce jeu uniquement pour son aspect « pratique ». Il n’est pas extraordinaire en soi, et ceux qui apprennent les signes en ligne n’y verront probablement aucune utilité. Pour ma part, cela me permet de faire du bachotage et d’enfoncer (au marteau) ces foutus Katakana qui se ressemblent à deux-trois détails près !

Ce que j’apprécie :
💹Le système d’apprentissage, plutôt efficace.
💹Le contenu « bonus » (guide d’écriture PDF et l’art book)

Ce qui aurait pu être amélioré :

Why is it that in Japan, they would have any major problems defeating these monsters and have to rely on foreigners who don't understand Japanese? Think about it. In order to defeat the monsters, you have to pronounce the syllables each symbol represents. You average Japanese child could defeat these monsters. Holy crap. This is the equivalanet of English alphabet monsters invading an English speaking country. I'd be able to defeat those when I was 2 years old, since I was already reading at that time.      

Okay, onto the real review.      

Graphics have improved. Slightly better tilesets. Custom portraits. The enemies look nicer.      

Voice acting is here! It sounds corny and not believable, but it's still nice to have.      

The gameplay has improved. Slightly more treasure chests for exploration. There's a visible queue for every charcter's turn, and each character does the action right after you select it, instead of you selecting all the actions and then waiting. When you attack a katakana symbol, there is an audio sound and a visual representation of the stroke order, making it that much easier to remember the symbols.

Gra o charakterze edukacyjnym, biorąca za ""główne"" zadanie nauczyć gracza znaków katakany, czyli japońskiego pisma używanego do zapisu nazw z innych języków. 
Tych znaczków najlepiej się uczyć poprzez powtarzanie i twórcy tej serii postanowilii użyć RPG Maker VX czy tam nowszy program i powtarzać tobie mocno uproszczone kolejności, bez kierunków kresek w każdym znaku. 
Powyższa wada prowadzi do tego, że tak naprawdę uczysz się tylko czytać katakanę. W zasadzie i tak lepiej zrobić sobie zeszycik na znaczki, więc jest sensowne minimum... 
Jest fabuła poprowadzona w stylu anime z gaidzinami i senpaiem uczącym ich katakany, aby niszczyć inwazyjne obake.
Głosy są okropne, amerykańskie- nawet senpai straszy swoim ""maj nejm is dajske"". Najwięcej ich w intrze, minimum w dialogach,  w nauce są TYLKO przy znakach i słowach, więc użerasz się z idiotycznymi wstawkami niezwiązanymi z napisami i również tylko czytasz przy lekcji (a potem w dialogach gadają jak to fajnie ich Daisuke uczy etc. xD ).
Są minimalne elementy visual novel- scenki co ileś punktów znajomości zdobywanych po walkach, straszące przybliżeniem (gejoza alert).
Balans walk słaby- na planszach po jednej nauce masz przeciwników 95% z ostatniej lekcji, a ci z poprzednich są na hita. 
Robienie aczika na znajomość ze wszystkimi wymaga ode mnie walczenia na konkretnym etapie nauki, bo postacie po za drużyną nie levelują jak w normalnych jRPG-ach i powtory były by za silne potem. Robię to na dodatek na najłatwiejszych znaczkach, f- (mimo, że to praktycznie 15 znaków). 
Niby jest Challenge Castle, z potworkami na 1 HP, ale szybkością niemałą, i do tego są czasami literowe (romaji) więc szukasz idiotycznie znaku, bo wymowa łatwa. I do tego kapsuła regenerująca wszystko...

Fun, with a cute and engaging narrative, while also being a great resource for drilling your katakana learning. It helps if you played the first game or already studied Japanese before coming here (especailly learning your hiragana). But if this is somehow your starting point, it will do its best to guide you along. 

The only real downside to this game is that it was made SO WELL in comparrison to the first game in the series. While Hiragana Battle is great in its own right, the game is very old and clunky, and has not aged well. It feel like comparing one of the classic Final Fantasy games to something more modern in that series, like Final Fantasy VI or VII. With Katakana War, the game is fairly well optimized, with lots of quality of life improvements that are non-existent in its predecessor: no more random encounters, more simple and fluid leveling system, achievements, an endless dungeon for easy drilling of everything you've learned, and even lots of scenes that are fully voice-acted, which was a extremely pleasant surprise. 

This all means that if this is your first time engaging with the series, it will be REALLY hard to go back and play the first game after this, without all those quality of life additions. So it's recommended that you start with Hiragana Battle before Katakana War, and tough out learning your hiragana before you move on to the katakana edition. Which, honestly, is the more appropriate way to learn the language anyway, so you're doing yourself no harm by starting with Hiragana Battle.

One thing this game lacked was  putting to use the words you learned as vocabulary to use in combat like the first game. That would've been an improvement.  If you're learning katakana for the first time, I would once again recommend a notebook and pencil. But since I already knew hiragana and katakana, the game was very easy. It took me about 8 hours to complete everything minus getting everyone's affection up to 500. I liked that there was Steam achievements for this game. I wished all the members of your party leveled up with you, though, so you wouldn't be stuck using the same members you chose at the beginning of the game just to avoid hours and hours more of grinding (and yes, I know there were bonus points available, but I didn't use them). I also found the final boss of the first game just a bit harder than this one, because of the use of actual words used to beat the boss. Also, the characters felt deeper than the first game.

Happily, this game improves upon Hiragana Battle with wonderful art of all the characters, voice acting (which I admit is sometimes cringy, but heartwarming all the same), and a little bit of visual novel action too. It was pretty fun getting to know all the characters PLUS getting the rewards when I totally befriended them. There's also a visual display of the turn system, so you don't have to memorize every character's speed stat (which gets a bit confusing with 6 different characters). There's tons of other gameplay details too, but those aren't as important as the Katakana learning of course.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ you learn the whole japanese Katakana alphabet
+ makes the blunt memorizing of the characters much more enjoyable & entertaining
+ you learn japanese vocabulary written in the katakana, but also hiragana set
+ low price for fun >10 hours of learning through playing
+ overall many improvements in comparison to predecessor:
   + now a variety of good (<3 <3) battle & general music, that was needed but missing in the last title of the series
   + new gameplay mechanics like an basic affection system, a better fight-order instead of round-based fighting system
   + charming characters have more personality, interaction between each other and even some minor character 
      progression/development!
   + many characters that you can choose from to build your group
   + voice actors for the main cast! (even though not every line is spoken out loudly..)
   + no annyoing & high random encounter rates anymore (thank god), but free roaming enemies that follow you (you 
     could basically slip past most of them, but that would mean less XP too)
   + the character-drive story is a bit better then before, for an educational game where it just encompasses the learning- 
   aspect I find it good. Don't expect too much here though..
      enough.. 
   + minor quality of life enhancements (like that the whole set of characters is in one ordered & color-coded list, that you 
   navigate thorugh whithout scrolling)
   + many side quests, where you can learn extra vocab, if you please to do so

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
~ still no full HD (cmon devs, even with the RPGMaker I'm sure it would be possible ;))
~ grammar is utterly left untouched. Of course that's neither what the games aims to accomplish nor is grammar a small 
   topic you can rush through, but a bit of insight would be appreciated
~ many vocab-words that you learn throughout the game demand, that you know Hiragana..

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- I still think that the fighting mechanic could be expanded upon, especially approaching the end..
- the boss battle was less demanding and epic in terms of gameplay then in ""Hiragana Battle"", at least that's my opinion
- dungeon design is still way to straight forward, I think basic puzzle elements for the stages (that maybe even involve japanese culture) could have been added easily and would make the gameplay more refreshing!

[h1]All in all[/h1]
A big improvement towards the previous game of the series! Really helpful & entertaining way to learn the Katakana symbols. Even though it is not mandatory I would suggest that you first learn the Hiragana alphabet, so you won't miss out on any vocab content in this game (check out the previous game ;)).

My critiques stem from the fact that the concept of a random battler to help you study characters is briliant! its basically a flashcard game in a lovable and relatable format.

Couldn't face doing that again with Katakana so thought I'd give this a bash.


First thing I should say is that it works: you'll learn Katakana by clicking on the sound (denoted by roman characters) that corresponds to the right katakana character in JRPG-style battles. It's easy, quick and much less boring and laborious than writing it down over and over again. 

The lessons that introduce the characters are good - you're taught how to write and pronounce the characters and given tips on how to remember them. Words spelt with the characters you've learned are also introduced gradually, which is nice. 
This game rewards players who've learned hiragana with vocabulary lessons written in the same, but knowing hiragana isn't a requirement as the romaji spellings are also given.

One thing I worried about before buying this was whether it'd strike the right balance between game and language learning tool. I think it mostly gets it right - within 5 minutes you're practising Katakana and it's very accessible and easy to get to grips with. However, the battle system is very simple and gets boring after a while. Although you're given the ability to use magic early on in the game, it does nothing to enhance your learning and it barely does more damage than just choosing the right answer. There's a variant on the combat later on whereby the romaji and katakana characters become inverted, meaning the enemies are now romaji and you have to choose the right katakana. This was welcome, but that's about the extent of the variety offered (90% into the game, anyway).

On the other hand, it sometimes errs a little much on the side of being a JRPG for my liking. I completely tuned out of the  redundant storyline very quickly, and fortunately you can easily skip all the cut scenes and dialogue; however there's surprisingly a lot of the latter considering the game's remit is teaching you a writing system, and the sheer volume you have to click through gets a bit wearing after a while. 

In sum, having a podcast or something else going on while you play is essential to avoid getting bored and irritated by the simplistic battle system and superfluous game elements, but if you want a cheap, quick and easy way to learn katakana you can't really go wrong with this.

I have been studying Japanese for over four years now and have always feared katakana words because I had learned hirigana first (often cheated and just use hirigana). This game changed that, as most games simply throw letters at you endlessly until you can guess them well enough, this game decided to make them enemies. At first it was offputing, but after a little while it became the thing that helped me finally learn katakana! The difference? Like other games you learn attack patterns and what they look like to determine how you battle. This is the same approach katakana war took to teaching you katakana. First you have a lesson, then you begin to fight the embodiment of the letters as you move down the katakana table. At first this can feel a little tedious as all the enemies are from the vowel row, but bear through it as it gets better. 

In Conclusion: if your new to japanese or just never bothered to learn katakana like me then this is a must pick game is for you.

Pros:
- Story? (good to have it, gave me a reason to just keep playing and have fun)
- Different way of teaching
- Bonus vocabulary that is reviewable
- Enemies are the vocabulary so you begin to recognize by whats needed instead of just flat out memorizing

A definite step up from the previous game (combat wise). I already really liked the first one, but grinding is so much more fun on this on. The additional play of sort of platonic friendship dating sim stuff is seriously adorable and a nice break from routine.

I enjoyed the music and artwork for a $7 title.  I'm mixed about the voice acting; the competence of each actor varied quite a bit, and Satomi's was the only one who stood out to me, albeit in a positive way. Understandably, all of the characters have an American accent despite their backstory.  I don't have much to say about the story and whatever else I don't mention.

As for the negative:
– No real-time challenges. Whenever you read, speed is important, and this game offers no benefit for speed. Even just having a FF7/8-esque ATB system would be a huge improvement.
– Difficulty is extremely low. I just rushed through the story and absolutely destroyed everything, including the final boss.
– The organized Answer menu makes it way too easy to deduce the correct answer for romaji enemies without learning the katakana well.  You can ace all the answers by memorizing slightly over 20% of all the katakana.  OCR could be used instead.
– The vast majority of the enemies have attributes that scale with how recently you received their associated lesson, making it even easier to deduce the correct answer without learning katakana.
– Too often, the same enemies will appear in exactly the same positions. Compounded by a menu that remembers your previous commands, this makes it even easier for players to succeed without learning much katakana.
– Poor balancing between the number of katakana enemies and number of romaji enemies.
– The challenge castle is pointless. The NPC who takes you there makes it sound like a big deal, but it looks like unfinished content.
– Katakana [i]words[/i] are shown literally once ever in battle.  In my experience, I've only really encountered individual katakana characters in manga, and they aren't very important.
– Some of the sidequests require you to purchase a specific item so that you can receive the lesson that helps you identify that item. This is backwards and I don't understand the logic.
– Barely any ""RP"" in what's sold as an ""RPG"".  Your choices are basically inconsequential, and only have a minor impact during the character affection sequences.
– The gameplay and design have nothing interesting at all.

There are way better budget RPGs out there, and if you just want to learn katakana, there are plenty of free katakana flash games out there that would help you learn much faster.  Personally I think playing with a katakana Anki deck is one of the fastest ways to drill individual characters into your head, and if you can't even handle that, then good luck making any meaningful progress towards learning Japanese, one of the hardest languages for people who don't natively speak an East Asian language.",1516282311,1516338965,False,19,0,0.579019069671630859,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Also makes me wish I had the knowlegde and lets face it WILL to make my own game. In short this game is a diamon in the rough. 

Bad stuff:

A1. Dialog in english.
A2. Missed opportunity at writting actual word in battles.
A3. Enemies are quiet alike..
A4. Repeative missions
A5. Forced lessons to proceed

Good stuff

B1. affection meter
B2. character seperat story
B3. side quests
B4. crystal store
B5. short game
B6. achievements

The bad in more depth:


A1. Dialog in english.
It's a issue I have with most language tools. Too much english. A option for having the dialog read in japanese would help me learn even more. Listening to english kinda feels like a waste of time when I trying to learn japanese and since there are subtitles why not? I could listen to the japanese and read the english. Of course I do understand that newcomers might find listening to japanese overwhelming and finding and recording dialog in 2 languages (and translating the dialog) cost more money. Yet it would have been a nice option.

A2. Missed opportunity at writting actual word in battles.
The monsters or Obake you fight appear in shape of japanese letters. In most battles there are multiple letters on screen. Yet they don't say anything. This feels like a perfect opertunity to teach some more japanese words or remind us of words we've seen earlier in the game. All that would be needed is just to arrage what letters pop up at a specific battle and maybe the translation of the word writen at the top of the screen. A missed opportunity.

A3. Enemies are quiet alike
Not much difference between one battle and the other. Only difference was the bosses which change from one letter to another once the last one had been defeated until the final form. In my oppion this should have been the model for the normal enemies. Once I attacked ア with A there is no educational value in me attacking it with A again with a different member of my group. However if it after the first attack switched appearence to a different katakana which I would have to identify then we would learn more wouldn't we? Maybe some of the enimies could have cofused a party member. Maybe the others could have cured this by spelling out his or her name! There were of course some battles that toke place in another dimention where the monsters appeared as latin letters and one had to defeat them by attacking with right katakana. A good idea, but it wasn't used enough. Also a sweet idea that just poped. If one could attack Obake from both dimetions at the same battle. Maybe once party memebers could switch between the option of katakana or latin. Might take a move to do. Hmm...
And maybe throw in some really hard enemies once in a while... wait the game did this, but there weren't just hard enough. There's a escape button that I rarely use. 

A4. Repeative missions
This wasn't a issue at the start of the game while one was limited to the first town. But the later part when one has to travel to another part on the map to fight some small Obake before a bossbattle only to end up back in town 1 to repeat the process in the next part of the game. No sleep overs, No traveling without a party member or wich a curse one has yet to learn how to remove. Now the game is not the only rpg with this problem. And as I said before this isn't a problem in the begining of the game. Maybe because you can kinda see what difference you've made.. or because the walk to the action was shorter.

A5. Forced lessons to proceed
Kinda a part of the last complaint, but it comes from a different place. I've tried to learn japanese on and of for some years. So I kinda don't need these lessons, but to progress in the story and to get access to other ""tools""(in lack of a better word) in the game to teach me some japanese I don't know I have to sit thorugh them. Kinda wish this would have been optional.

Good stuff more in depth

B1. affection meter
Done a lot of ginding in other games to empower my partymembers. Rarly grinded to improve affection. Still grinding, but now it had more of a pay off. A simple short little cut cusceen. Well done! Grinding now has more of a purpose.

B2. character seperat story
The charaters in the story are kinda simple minded, but still kinda entertaining. Or maybe it just me. Yet The final cutsceens (especially Owens) gave me such hunger to learn more. Well written.

B3. side quests
The side quest were enjoyable and the reward was a to learn more japanese words and sometimes there was a quiz at the end. Those quizes were fun... maybe because they were so easy that I acced everyone except the ones that I kinda messed up on...
Also The simple bubble with the text ""rock on super star"" that appeared everytime you finnished a quest. Really got me hyped for some reason.

B4. crystal store
In some battles you receive crystals which you can exchange for items that permanatly boost your characters stats. Love having this opion. So now I can make my weakest character the strongest or the slowest the fastest or... I could just speed up my mages for the best results in future battles... Yet the option to modify like this gives freedom to do it all. Turn a warrior to a mage or a mage into a battle mage. Freedom like this is oe of the best features in gameplay probably only riveled by joy of double jump.

B5. short game
I'm old. I have a job and lots of other things I want to do. So Good things come in small packages and don't take up to much of my time. I rather play a short game than a long one that looses it's charm because of the time it steals from other activities or because fun of the game stoped being fun after 50 hours and you still have 100 left,,,
I know there are young people out there that want a game to last forever,,, but you will learn.
Still a ultimate boss to fight after would have been nice...

B6. achievements
Never thought that this would ever become important to me, but it did... and that is why I haven't fibbished Hiragana wars... Yet I found myself playing though this game in less than a week. Nice upgrade... Now please path the first game so with achievements as well... please..

Special thanks!

To Sleepy duck! I might have called your game a diamond in the rough, but that's still a diamond. Please continue your work.

I was amazed at the second time around, I was reacting quickly and accurately. It made going through the game even easier and faster the second time around.

Em primeiro lugar, você não precisa jogar o jogo antigo para jogar este, mas vai te ajudar MUITO se o fizer, já que o jogo tem palavras escritas em Hiragana o tempo todo, além de que, existem simbolos em Katakana muito parecidos ou iguais ao Hiragana, como exemplo: 
He = へ　
Ya = や/ヤ　
Ka = か/カ　

Bom, Katakana War não segue uma continuação do jogo passado, mas segue o mesmo estilo de gameplay: uma cidade foi invadida por símbolos japoneses e é seu dever acabar com eles.

LADOS POSITIVOS:

1.Aqui já temos um progresso, uma vez que, no jogo passado, ele funcionava igual grama do pokemon, que tu passa em cima várias vezes até encontrar um oponente, mas nesse jogo você vê a letra e tem a opção de mandar o ronaldinho nela, evitando um combate. Isso faz com que o jogo, em primeira instancia, pareça mais dinâmico que o anterior, mas existem problemas aqui que serão falados mais pra frente.

2. Outro ponto positivo é o menu de letras estarem infinitamente mais organizado. CUIDADO! Não decore o simbolo pela linha que ele se encontra. Entenda que, esse é um jogo educacional, então duele com todos os monstros se possível e decore de forma com que você não esqueça.

3. Nesse game temos dublagem. Ela é uma merda, mas auxilia na hora do combate. 
Quando você vai lutar contra um simbolo e aí seleciona uma tradução, o personagem fala em voz alta o que foi selecionado e escreve na tela. Isso é bom por termos tanto apoio visual quanto auditivo e facilita na hora do aprendizado. 

4. O uso das magias, pelo menos pra mim, foi superior tambem. No jogo passado era só pegar o personagem, socar level e itens que dão força pra dar hit kill mas nesse aqui, os personagens são mais fracos e as magias auxiliam. (Charllote é healer e roubada, use-a)

5. O jogo também tem nível de interação. Tu consegue fazer amizade e super amizade com a sua party e eles ganham buffs adicionais.

Agora vem os defeitos:

1. Me incomoda o tanto de diálogo entre personagens. Eu particularmente não dei a mínima pra interação dos personagens e nem pela história, que é completamente enfadonha. O jogo é educacional e deveria se comportar como tal. Isso faz você perder algum tempo só tendo que dar skip.

2. Tem um bug chato que faz o fps do game cair pra 1 quando seu personagem vai upar de classe. Isso faz você perder tempo também.

3. Achei os mapas bem pequenos, então se você for apressado, tu pode sair rushando o jogo e não aprender muito, o que no jogo passado, era impossível.

4. Dublagem. É ruim gente, desculpa.

5. Acho errado num jogo que era pra focar apenas nos simbolos querer me ensinar palavras. A melhor forma de aprender palavras é em textos, não no avulso. Pelo menos o final não teve o lance do final anterior, então ta bom.

CONCLUSÕES FINAIS:

Sim, você aprende jogando tanto esse quanto o outro, mas não sei ao certo o quão efetivo é. 
Posso dizer que, pra mim, os dois jogos me deram o pontapé inicial e eu consigo ler hiragana e katakana com facilidade, mas eu uso outros sites de apoio e estou sempre escutando o idioma, talvez tenha sido mais fácil, não sei como vai ser pra você.

Pros:
-For $7, it is entertaining and it gets the job done. 
-You'll pick up some vocab words you may or may not have known already. 
-The production quality is better than pretty much every indie / rpg-maker-like game I've played on Steam. It's painful how serious that statement is, but at the same time my hat is off to the devs.
-They cleaned up the answer table in the combat system from hiragana battle. It is much easier on the eyes
-The voice acting is straight up better than like 75% of dubbed anime, which was a pleasant surprised
-Inclusion of a 'practice' mode unlocked through normal gameplay (I think it was chapter 5 or 6). Didn't use it yet, but I might come back to it if I feel I need to review.
-This game has a bit more personallity than it's predecessor which was a nice touch

Cons:
-A few bugs, Couldn't get WASD controls to work. Final affection cutscenes lagged / froze to the point where I thought it would crash the game (it did not). The game did crash on me once after running it for  about 6 or 7 hours, I'm not sure why. I didn't bother checking the error log and it didn't happen again. And yeah, I played this from start to finish in one sitting. I know, I'm such an overachiever, stop, y'all gonna make me blush.
-If you played Hiragana battle you probably remember when they switched the Hiragana enemies for Romaji ones and you had to answer with the corresponding Hiragana. It really helped etch those suckers into memory IMO. This happens in Katakana War as well, but it's too easy. That new cleaned up Answer table makes it a little too easy to common sense your way to the correct choice (Ie. If you remember which column is which vowel). This is essentially nit-picking as any practice is helpful, but I figured I'd mention it.
-They cleaned up the combat gui a bit which, while asthetically pleasing, leaves me with one eensie-weensie bone to pick. In Hiragana Battle when selecting the Hiragana to answer there was another box in the menu you could look at to select the hiragana as well as the highlighted sprite. This was nice because the hiragana were displayed there in a more normal text-like font as opposed to the sprite's more artistic / calligraphic versions. I can't read the common text katakana nearly as well as I could the common text hiragana right after finishing the game. It's not a huge deal, there are only a few that look all that different, and if I stop and think for a minute I can usually figure it out without having to check an appendix or anything like that, it's just that the comprehension isn't quite as well as a result of not seeing both for the 8 or 9 hours I spent playing / learning. Ironically the best resource for reading the texty fonty katana is that Romaji Answer table I just whined about. After unlocking all the Katakana I took a moment to look it over and screenshotted it for reference.



TLDR: Will teach you Katakana in an entertaining fashion. Eagerly awaiting Kanji Combat which I believe was confirmed by the devs on a forum post somewhere, although there is no Kickstarter page as of 9/2017.

- Cringey voice over that if you want to disable, you have to lose all your basic UI sound effects as well.
- Battles are way, way slower paced and thus more time is wasted not learning. Characters yell the sound of the katakana they are attacking which sounds awful and makes the player less likely to sound out the katakana themselves. (Again, this can only be disabled if you also have disabled all of the game's basic sound effects.)
- Battles no longer have you select the character in a window showing the character in computer text. I liked this in Hiragana battle as it further cemented my memorization and allowed me to regularly see characters in both written and typed font styles.
- The writing animations in lessons are way too slow.
- Story is worse and gameplay focuses too much on being an RPG instead of actually learning like the first game did.
- BUGS. The game has been out for 8 months now and not a single patch. Really? Keyboard configuration is completely broken, and from reading what others have said there are even incorrect translations which will cause player confusion.

Magic system is a new inculsion and is handeled very well, it doesn't 1 hit kill anything but it does a ton of damage (depending on the character). The learning guide which was inculded in the deluxe addition helps greatly and is very appreicated and well put together. Katakana battle takes the Learning to Japanese Franchise and moves it forward and hopefully will continue to with Kanji Combat.

The level of polish on this game was above and beyond what I was expecting. Everything from the enunciation of the syllables (with both male and female audio as appropriate to the character) to the excellent side quests that allowed you to learn new words in an unintimidating manner were just excellent.

The game built on the previous game without the player ""really"" needing to have played it which was nice. Characters in this game were actually really well developed and I had an authentically good time with the RPG elements of the game.The maps were a little visually busy and I still think both games would've been better if the characters had dynamic expressions that changed to fit the situation rather than one genetic portrait... but there were small things like shaking the portraits and the voice acting that added a lot more life to the characters which was really awesome. 

Also, on that note, blown away by the inclusion of voice acting, it really added an extra layer of depth to this game that I love. I also like that the game has return-ability, unlike Hiragana Battles, there is still an end game that you can continue going through to practice and catch up on things you missed, which I absolutely love.

Shape-shifting monsters called Obake started appearing all over Japan, You, as a foreigner teamed up with other people to learn Katakana (one of the three writing systems in Japanese) in order to defeat the Obake, as the only way to defeat them is to call out the name their shape represents.

[b]Gameplay[/b]:
The gameplay is similar to that of a classic RPG game. You form a team of four, battle in turn-by-turn combats, collect items and money, and interact with NPCs. Through the repetitive battling, you'll learn Katakana while playing the game. In addition to that, the game also features light dating-sim elements and pure lecture scenes.

[b]Graphics[/b]:
The pixel graphic is detailed, the characters has traits that make them stand out from the others. However I wish that the texture of the floor has more variations as they look very repetitive. I also wish there are different animations for different magic skills. Lastly, which I think is the most important issue here, the artwork of the character that appears when they speak should have more variations. Because there are only one artwork for each character, so sometimes they don't match what they're saying (Like someone is saying something furiously but their artwork shows them smiling).

[b]Sound[/b]:
I like the background music of the game, especially the battle themes. However, I think different magic skills should have different variations of sound effect, it'd make the game more enjoyable. The voiceover is good, but could use some improvements in my opinion. During battle, I wish the characters would speak the answer in their own voice instead of two generic voices for male and female. The voiceover is not full which means most dialogues don't have full voiceovers. I have no problem with that but sometimes the voice is completely unrelated to what the character says. I get slightly annoyed when that happens.

[b]Performance[/b]:
Even though it's a 2D RPG game, I get some performance issues when playing the game, It could be an issue that only happens on my PC though. After every battle, when the score screen appears, the screen would freeze for a few seconds and during that time I can't do anything but to wait for the freeze to go away. This issue happens after almost every battle which can be a bit annoying. But luckily the freeze don't aways happen right after the score screen appears, so if I'm lucky I can skip the screen before the freeze happens to avoid the freezing. I use a game controller to play this game, it works fine except one part: when you're running, if you let go of the run button, your character would stop moving instead of continue walking. This is not a serious issue and will not affect the playability of the game.

[b]Conclusion[/b]: 
If you want to learn Katakana in a fun and relaxing way, then I recommend learning it through this game. If this is the first time you're learning Japanese, then I recommend you to play the Hiragana version first. It's made by the same developer and is a prequel to this game. After playing through this game, you should be able to recognize all Katakana characters. So why not do the learning through playing a game? Although the story and RPG elements of the game is very basic, it's still a good game. Remember, it's an educational game. At the end, you can learn so much just by playing a game, and how many game allows you to do that?

Игра построена так, что ты можешь проходить её с удобной тебе скоростью, без спешки заныривая в онлайн переводчик или отвлекаясь на заваривание чая. 

Из минусов - странное подвисание игры в определённые моменты общения с персонажами. Когда запустите игру и немного поиграете, поймёте о чём речь. Возможно, это изначальная задумка разрботчиков, чтобы я лучше осознала важность определённых моментов общения...Впрочем, больше и придраться не к чему. 

У игры свой стиль, своя манера общения с игроком. Мне импонирует подобная дружелюбная интерактивность со стороны персонажей. И этот стиль рисовки маленьких чибиков, спасающих Японию от всяких неприятностей - ммм, он иронично трогателен и омурмительно хорош. Няшные и отважные:D

I was never particularly challenged, with there being very few difficult knowledge checks. I feel like this will serve as a good foundation for my Katakana learning, and now that I have the basics I can find slightly more advanced training. You're going to want to write things down as you play; while there is a study guide, there isn't a prepared alphabet chart for you, and making one good alphabet chart will help you beat the game (and learn Japanese) with less trouble.

The total runtime of my game, where I completed *most* sidequests I ran in to and didn't experiment with my party very much, was 9 hours. Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War was a nice way to spend a weekend, and I would recommend it to any fan of anime as a first step in to learning Japanese. (I think, I haven't really ""learned"" it yet!)

For the game itself, I have a long list of gripes and wishes. These are mostly going to be negative things, but I want to note that the experience overall was very enjoyable.
- The music has a very short loop in some places, with obvious stumbles between loops.
- It feels like the engine can't handle having so many attack options; later in the game, the game will lag slightly every time you open up the Answer menu
- The final boss will also cause a slight bit of lag when particles are on him
- Some areas, such as the mountain, have very avoidable combat. I felt like just walking around monsters instead of fighting them. This is a gamer-thing, but it may have robbed me of some practice?
- There was very little reinforcement for vocabulary; only a few side quests quizzed your vocab retention
- The fonts chosen can cause some confusion; I didn't realize ""shi"" had that slant to it until it was randomly put next to ""tsu"" for a word, or that the ""a"" letter didn't connect at the top
- I enjoyed seeing my party interact, but I wish they would talk about Japanese a little more; there was a person who taught me about sports words like Tennis and Surfing, and I wish my friends would talk about learning the words for their hobby
- The very end of the game had a cool puzzle, buy a Radio using the japanese word, and the last few weapons were in japanese; I really enjoyed that content and translating the words to Romaji, and I wish there was more things like that",1501992198,1501992198,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Рекомендую игру для тех кто в состоянии читать тексты на английском и понимать хотя бы основную суть. Не знаю, хватит ли школьного уровня, тут скорей все упирается в словарный запас.

[h1]Введение[/h1]
Давным-давно загорелся желанием выучить японский, но все не знал с чего же начать. Однажды наткнулся на 1-ую часть данной серии [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/438270/Learn_Japanese_To_Survive_Hiragana_Battle/]Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle[/url]. Приобрел ее и к концу прохождения уже знал 85-90% Хираганы. Спустя некоторое время, увидев в продаже данную игру, приобрел и ее. Но руки дошли до нее только сейчас.

[h1]Геймплей[/h1]
Игра представляет собой JRPG и полностью построена на обучении. В основном делается упор на изучение Катаканы (японская слоговая азбука использующая для написания иностранных слов), также по ходу игры вас немного обучат грамматике и пополнят ваш словарный запас.
В японию вторглись пришельцы в форме слогов из Катаканы и вам нужно освободить ее от них. Единственным способом победить их является правильно назвать их. К примеру: イ - И (i), カ - КА (ka). Вам представляется возможность собрать пати из 4-ех персонажей (одним из которых является созданный вами в начале) по ходу игры вам откроются новые персонажи, каждый из которых обладает своими особыми скиллами и характеристиками.
И так, цель ясна, пати собрано, что же дальше? А дальше за 10 основных уроков(не считая побочных 20 мини-уроков(квестов)) которые будут по ходу игры, вас прогонят по всей Катакане.
И вот 1-ый урок завершен, теперь можно и в бой! Побеждаете захватчиков своими знаниями, с каждым новым уроком освобождаете новые области. Так же не забывайте заглядывать в различные лавки, где продается оружие и припасы.
P.S у каждого из персонажей есть шкала ""привязанность"", она будет повышаться лишь у тех, кто сражается вместе с вами в пати, при ее повышении откроются мини-диалоги с каждым из них, в конце каждого из которых вам придется выбрать 1 из 3-ех ответов, при удачном ответе персонаж получить + к характеристикам, и как только шкала привязанности достигнет максимума, персонаж получит уникальную, ультимативную способность, которую можно будет использовать 1 раз за бой.

[h1]Техническая часть[/h1]
Интерфейс простой и понятный.
Присутствует английская озвучка для важных диалогов, огорчило, что у русского персонажа не было ""русского"" акцента аля ""Лет пи спик фром май харт"" но это уже чисто мои придирки.
Саундтрек в игре очень хорошо написан, особенно вдохновил трек в самом конце игры.
Так же хоть и в сюжете не было ничего особенного, в самом конце игры саундтрек и актеры почти что заставили меня пустить слезу.

[h1]Итог[/h1]
В итоге считаю, что игра достойна для своей скромной цены, со своей задачей прекрасно справляется. В этот раз за 3 дня игры выучил 95% Катаканы. Советую пройти и 1-ую часть данной серии [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/438270/Learn_Japanese_To_Survive_Hiragana_Battle/]Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle[/url], еще в конце разработчики анонсировали 3-ую часть Learn Japanese To Survive! Kanji Battle, очень сильно жду ее, учитывая сколько кандзи в японском.  По ходу игры вам дропнется 4 карточки, каждая из которых стоит 12-15 рублей.

Katakana == Japanese alphabet for writing non-Japanese words. (This game)
Hiragana == Japanese alphabet for writing Japanese words.

Will this game teach you katakana? Yes it will. I was always too lazy to learn katakana the traditional way. So i found this game series and decided to give it a fresh try. I didn't buy Hiragana Battle because of the reviews saying that Katakana war is far better developed and less repetitive. And also has Steam Cloud and achievements. Even the art looks better from the previews and still the games cost (now) the same.. 

This game got the main point through. I am able to read words in katakana now, sometimes slowly, but i can do it!

I really hope developers will read this, however (SPOILER ALERT!):
1.Would have been nice if i was able to choose the order of attack on characters. It seemed sometimes too random and unexplained. I always had to attack with my character first. Would have been nicer if there had been more varierity to that.
2.There could have been so much more to do! For example, friend rooms. At least the option to add them to party or maybe discover some items in their rooms would have been interesting. 
3.Also would have been nice to travel using the train station, much more logical than just leaving the town. At least have an option to travel after finishing mission there.
4.The WASD keyboard setup didn't work. Please fix.

I suggest maybe developers make updated/improved versions of hiragana and katakana games.  Hiragana battle 2, Katakana war 2, etc... But of course kanji combat would be awesome too! I am so waiting for it!

The vocabulary lessons are easier if you have already learned Hiragana, possibly through playing the prequel.   On the other hand, it was mildly annoying that the storyline in ""Katakana War"" did not connect with the loose ends of ""Hiragana Battle"".  In terms of the learning experience this didn't matter at all, but in terms of enjoying the denouement at the end, it was a mild let down.  

There are some extremely good jokes made by all the other characters.  Andrea is possibly the most annoying female I've ever played with, and Kyoko's experience of ""having a conversation"" made me laugh out loud.  

If you are trying to have a fun way to practice your first lessons in Japanese, this game and it's prequel are really great learning tools that are fun to use.",1499312534,1499312534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

2.สอนได้ระเอียดมาก [สิ่งที่ผมชอบที่สุดคือเป็นลำดับการเขียน]

2.หากใครอยากจะได้เร็วผมไม่ค่อยแนะนำให้เล่นเพราะเกมจะค่อยๆสอนไปที่ละช้าๆ ถ้าจำหรือฝึกเขียนจะเร็วกว่าแต่ก็อาจจะเบื่อได้

If you have not played Hiragana Battle and are planning on playing Katakana War, please buy Hiragana War first and then Katakana war. The best way to learn Japanese is almost for sure Hiragana -> Katakana -> Kanji. 

Learn Japanese to Survive! Katakana War is the sequel, in more than one way, to Hiragana Battle, which are both games that introduce you to the Japanese language with an interesting take: mashing it into an RPG, putting some decent graphics in, and making it something you're willing to invest into. This game does not fully replace a Japanese class, but serves as a great introduction to Japanese and gives you a nice head start if you get into an actual Japanese learning program. After playing Hiragana Battle and seeing the Kickstarter for Katakana Battle, I knew I'd have to buy it first day. And then I got the email and I did. I'm not disappointed in one bit. I may or may not have made a meme out of it, just don't worry about it, let's talk about the game now.

So, what is Katakana? Katakana is a writing system in the Japanese language similar to Hiragana, except these characters are used for words of foreign originality, such as specific locations (ex. Los Angeles = ロスアンゼルス [Rosu-Anzerusu]), foreign names (ex. John -> ジョン [Zyon]) and other loanwords. Hiragana is used for words original to Japanese and articles of the language, and Kanji is used mostly for readability and to clear up the several homophones within the Japanese language.

Similar to Hiragana Battle, you will learn all 46 characters (plus some nuiances with Katakana, specifically) of the Katakana writing system along with a bunch more words and a couple more phrases in both Katakana and Hiragana (which I very much requested for and was happy to see!), along with them being written in Romanized English, or Romaji, for easier understanding for English speakers. Again, similar to Hiragana Battle, it's really quick and easy to learn all these characters, words and phrases to 100% the game (with an actual indicator that you have indeed 100%'d the game this time!), however this time after having experience with Hiragana, it was much quicker and much easier to understand how it all works. Plus I marathoned it over 9 hours straight on my stream, which was decently fun and helped all the lessons move on faster. And again, I highly recommend taking hand-written notes, with paper and pencil.

TL;DR: Slightly higher than my score on Hiragana Battle, I give this a 9 out of 10. It's a great game to play after conquering Hiragana Battle, still is a great way to memorize the basics of Japanese, and it still does not quite replace a class yet, but I will leave a couple handy resources below for that. I have learned way more Japanese after this game, and can confirm this as a very handy tool before getting into Japanese seriously, and will still buy the Kanji equivalent just to see it continue as a great tool.

スリーピングダーク、どうもありがとうございます！これは楽しいかった！

Now, as for the nice resources to use:

First of all, being able to type the Japanese you learn is probably going to be more important than anything else. For Windows users, refer to [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5zpoYHlNT4]this link to enable the Japanese IME input for your keyboard[/url], which will allow you to type in the all-so-familiar Romaji. For Mac and Linux users, sorry but I don't have anything for you. You'll have to look it up yourselves.

Next, this game isn't everything you need. I wish it was, but there are great resources to use after finishing up with Hiragana and Katakana instead of sitting there saying ""...So when's Kanji? Grammar?"" My first go-to source was when I finally learned about Duolingo a few months ago and found this website since Duolingo didn't have Japanese lessons, and the website is [url=https://elon.io/]Elon.IO[/url]. Elon.IO offers a Spanish mini-course, Turkish, and the one I wish to highlight, Japanese. The course goes through all the Kanji taught in grade school, Hiragana, and Katakana (which you should have down well already! Benefits, woo!), along with a lot of grammar and phrases, and best of all, it's completely free and repetitive enough to [i]really [strike]frustrate you with the same phrase fifty times just because you typoed once[/strike] ingrain it into your mind.[/i]",1493940330,1493940330,True,117,2,0.897383689880371094,1,True,False,False,False,,,

That was what I expected though, since I played game 1, hiragana battle ( which I also recommend, and preferably first, since is more important to japanese than katakana, although you don't need it to learn katakana ). The battle mechanics are okay, but they could be improved a bit, for example  the enemies are not random and so you battle the same enemies too much, and when you battle letters from the roman alphabet you can do it just by remembering the order of the katakana lessons. I do like the learning mechanics quite a bit though, and the pacing is good also.The side quests are very nice also, allowing to learn some sentences and words at the same time you're learning the katakana.

+ The mechanic of you micromanaging between the RPG elements of the game to distract you while trying to recognize the Katakana characters is quite interesting. 

The other guy who disliked this game for that reason maybe didn't like this kind of distraction but it worked for me especially for someone who has a terrible memory (yes I just attacked a katakana character with a 'se' syllable and after worrying about my character's health status, I forgot that katakana character right away and have to think again lol). If anything, I think those ""distractions"" served as a way to keep the learning process entertaining and helps you recall things upon getting distracted.

Hiragana Battle was a game I purchased on a whim, since I had about 8 bucks in my wallet and I decided, ""Why not?""
The game itself, while simple, didn't distract from the learning, and the gameplay was challenging from the enemy stats, and it kept me engaged so I continued with the learning, which was done really well!
So, after hearing about Katakana War, I anticipated the release, since I just finished the original. Once it was released and I had the money to spare, I bought the bundle and got to work.
After 3 hours, I quit the game and will probably never go back.
Why? Simple. Katakana War has too much content that distracts from the main focus. Learning with JRPG gameplay.
The gameplay has recieved some improvements, like Boss battles and being able to see the turn order, and the boost of presentation is nicely improved, with great character portraits and some voice acting.
The main problem? There's too many characters. Hiragana Battle had 4 characters, and, while I don't remember their names, I remember their personalities and looks, and they did almost nothing to distract from the learning.
Katakana War, on the other hand, has atleast 10+ characters, all with distinct personalities, and they just keep coming!
Plus, there's socalizing events, which, while welcome in games like Persona, are not needed and it distracts you from the most important part, the part of the title. LEARNING JAPANESE.
So, overall, play Hiragana Battle, and after playing that, study Katakana in a normal way, without playing this, as the little additions distract too much from the main focus of the game.
I give this game a 4/10. It has potential, but the fact the mechanics work AGAINST each other, just ruins it from becoming worthy of a purchase.",1490702405,1490702405,False,20,1,0.554303348064422607,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The concept is fantastic. You play the game and learn Katakana along the way. Even though the game itself has its flaws, the feeling of actually doing something useful motivates you enough to play on. While 'grinding' is usually a pretty boring element of RPGs, it comes along with training Katakana characters in this one. So you train not just your char but in the meantime yourself as well!
Despite the story being a bit far-fetched and the charakters being pretty shallow, I would still recommend this game. Not for its qualities as an RPG but for the omnipresent side-effect of learning something which might come in handy in the real world. 

There are, however, two things which could be improved to increase the games educational value: 
- There is no option to train specific sets of characters, which results in the player knowing the ones from the beginning of the game much better than the ones from the end (still mixing up Wa- and Ya- series).
- Also the randomizer seems not to work correctly. You often get to fight the same combinations of characters, which leads to you memorizing patterns instead of characters.

All in all a very good price-performance ratio makes this game very attractive to anyone wanting to learn Japanese.

Why do I still not recommend the game? The big flaw is the bad programming. Appearantly the game's .exe triggers alarms of anti-virus softwares.

The problem with an educational game is getting people motivated enough to start the game up and play it, to want to learn after they bought the game and finish it. I think expanding upon the RPG relationship system that was put into play this game would be a great idea for the next game. Maybe relationships or something other. Nothing too complicated, I do enjoy the simplicity of the affinity system.


- I only had a few problems with this game. The primary problem was the voiceacting. I like many people cant tolerate english dubs, usually this isnt an issue though because theres always an option to control the audio level of the voice acting for cutscenes in most games. However that option was missing from this game. Just to note I think voice acting is worth it so long as people like myself has the option to control the audio.

- Slight performance issues in Osaka and very bad performance issues when I reached max affinity with each character.

Zombies and Obake (as hiragana or katakana symbols). Not only I can break bones with rocks and sticks, but also with words.

Alright, jokes asides, I will start this review and try to stay low on spoilers the most as possible. The story is situated 10 years after the previous game (Hiragana Battle), but this time the enemies are Katakana warriors. Originally, their name is Obake, which is a shape shifting spirit. So, of course, you must stop them invading Japan.

This game is pretty good and is more complete than the previous one.

- More quests. 20 quests, which reward you like in Hiragana Battle by giving you an item, cash or a weapon, but also by teaching you a few japanese words in katakana or hiragana.

- More characters to control. 8 in total, but you can only bring up to 4 with you (your main character obligatory and 3 others)

- There are more musics and they are better than in the last game  (especially the boss one)

- The main character is you. You can choose to be either a boy or a girl and also your ""class"", that I will call a title, which depends of what you answer when you make a new game

- The enemies appear on the map, unlike the previous game where you could meet some every 5 feet. Touching them engage the fight.

- There a new feature which is Affection. Each characters (except you) has an affection bar that goes up when you fight and after some certain amounts, you can talk to the characters to trigger an affection event, which give them some bonus stats. When they reach their maximum affection level with you.... well I won't spoil that part

- Differently from Hiragana Battle, you can only obtain spells during certain key moments in the game instead of leveling up.


Now I will quickly go with some stuff I didn't like much, but those are really minor.

- The spell animations are all the same. By example, a minor thunder spell will have the same animation than a major thunder spell or a thunder spell hitting all enemies.

- Its not really easy to be pretty immersive in the game when everyone keep the same emotion. What I mean is that they only have one facial expression during cutscenes. By example, some of the characters have a smiling or laughing facial expression, even when there a big enemy or when they are angry. I will add a screenshot so you can more easily understand.


http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=857115516

They don't really look worried that there lots of monsters invading the town. Everyone keep the same expression in ALL cutscenes of the game.



- During the final affection event of a character, is it me or after they end talking, the cutscene freezes but still continue in the background? After that, it goes back to normal. Not much of a big deal, but just a bit weird.

- Ok, ok. This one is more of an observation than a minor thing I didn't like. At the end of the game, when the story says what happened to the characters after all the events, I found a typo at Mischa's part. Yea, the word ""classes"" had an extra ""S"", which changed it to ""classses"".

If I can conclude this, well I had a lot of fun playing this game and I even got some good laughs during some cutscenes. It also fulfilled its goal very well since I improved my katakana alphabet knowledge a lot (I barely needed my notebook to find which one is which).

I would just recommend having google handy to look up a written example of each character that is not stylized to look like brush strokes, the guides on how to write the characters become a bit confusing trying to figure out which characters have a tail on them, and which characters just have the tail because the brush stroke makes it look like it has a tail.

Example being the letter U. ウ
http://i.imgur.com/u3yAgkD.png

The U is just two straight lines at the top and the left, but the image made me believe there might be a curve to the line on the left.


Second example being the letter O. オ

The O has a tail on the vertical line but I confused it at the start for not just being part of the brush stroke.

You probably know what you're getting into by now, but know this is a very indie and small-budget kickstarter series that still manages to deliver the best gamification of hiragana/katakana learning out there today.

PROS:

1. Fun gamification of learning katakana. In ~12 hours you can get an extremely strong grip on katakana with some vocabulary and grammar rules sprinkled in, all through the guise of a cute little JRPG.

2. Additional polish that strengthens learning. For example when you fight a katakana character, the game now shows you the brush stroke order with every attack, as well as playing an audio track of the character's pronunciation.

3. Improved combat systems. Now you can fling spells at your enemies and decide to build your character as either a physical or magic damage user, and stack either physical or magical defense. Or both.

4. Extended content such as additional party members, affection levels, challenge castle (place to practice all you've learned), better art, narrative and chatter

5. CHEAP

CONS

1. Narrative and characters are still pretty weak, but better than first game

I played through the previous game Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle (I recommend this game as well, but its not required to play katana war) and it taught me all of the hiragana letters in less than a week, and I'm someone with terrible memory.

Speaking of memory, the way these games work is basically as follows: You are taught a bunch of -kana ""letters"" and then you come across enemies that you defeat with your newly taught -kana letters (you match -kana with the romaji equivalent). So its a memory game. Using pen and paper is highly recommended.

Other than that the game IS still a JRPG with leveling, stats and gear (and a story) but at least to me these things are not the most important aspect of this game.

The first game worked just fine, but this one comes with a couple of improvements, like (partial) voice acting and improved mouse control, but all of those new features are more of a quality of life things. You can play the game the same way you played hiragana battle and be just fine. I should also say that the combat is slightly improved and the interface looks cleaner (compared to the previous title). 

Good luck with your japanese studies!
