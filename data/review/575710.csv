You control a robot. You don't have a manual control of it, but you can set a program (a several commands) and it can execute it. So, basically how the computer works.

The game is great for children to help them understand how the computer works.
The game is short, it is a plus.

There are a few flaws. You cannot restart the level , it is bad because you can get in endless cycle. Also, there is no way to leave from this cycle.

It throws ya right into it, ya pick up the story from the cute little robot BOB and a snarky controler~ I found their back and forths a nice respite from some of the puzzles.
The programing aspects are well executed, though perhaps a little more explanation on a few aspects might be good, or I might just be dumb XD I did find a few puzzles I had to ""brute Force"" my way through, but those aside the puzzles are well designed and you have a real feeling of accomplishment when you finish them!
The Visuals itself are clean, crisp, cute, and pretty. beautifully rendered plants and waterfalls of cubes really pull the world together!

If I had to rate this game I'd give it a solid 9/10!
only critisisms I can think of are a few better explanations would be nice and a look at a few puzzles...

Jump, Step, Step is an entertaining game with cute graphics. But don't let the first impression fool you, this game gets really challenging after the first few stages.

The concept is similar to games such as Lightbot. You control a little robot (called Bob) stranded in a world full of dangerous cliffs, spikes and breaking stones. You'll have to program Bob by clicking together a chain of commands. Bob will faithfully execute your defined commands. If he doesn't reach the goal, you'll lose a life (in form of a battery). If you have no lives left, you'll have to start over at a checkpoint.

As you progress in the game, the stages will become harder and you'll gradually unlock more complex commands. You'll have to think of clever ways to help Bob reach the goal. In the later levels, you'll inevitable fail a few times before you get the right idea and you have to start over at a checkpoint.

Unfortunately, there's no ingame indication when you have reached a checkpoint and sometimes the placement of the checkpoints is annoying because they're too far away from where you failed. The translation of the dialogues is okay, tough not perfect (I accidentally lost an early save because of a misleading german translation of the menu option ""clear saved game"").

Despite of it's minor shortcomings, the game is definitly worth the price and the right choice for everybody who likes to program and/or puzzle! Even experienced programmers will get their money's worth with this game!",1490999220,1490999890,True,11,1,0.662207603454589844,1,True,False,False,False,,,
