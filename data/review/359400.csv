Will start out by saying - I don't really think this is my cup of tea. I spent more time frustrated than having fun, but I still want to leave a positive review here because perhaps someone else who doesn't have the same gaming quirks I do will find some enjoyment in it. Most of the game is really well done.

Great concept. The art is great, the faux-retro pixel art style popular with a lot of indie titles. The music is in the same style, nice and crunchy, different characters have different themes which is cool. The Ship has a lot of character, and the actual characters are all well designed and distinct. Their personal stories vary in quality (none are bad per se, some just really cliche) but the good ones are good. The mystery itself is intriguing. 

Now here's where it started being more frustrating than fun to me, and where other's opinions may differ. The actual gameplay is straight out of 90s adventure games in the sense that you have to rub everything on everything, but in this sense rubbing everything on everything is just talking to people over and over with different people until you finally find a fresh, precious morsel of new dialogue. The perceptive shifts sound cool until you realize instead of exhausting all dialogue options with a character and then moving on to the next, you now have to do that with every character you can possibly control. Then later you unlock full possessions which just means you now have a whole new thing to rub on everything. Most of your time will be spent wondering around the ship as different characters, trying to figure out just who in the hell you're supposed to talk to to trigger progression. It's not so bad early, when your possessions are limited, but by Chapter 4 it just becomes a mess of guess work and walking.

Speaking of walking, most of the characters are painfully slow. No sprint. Your ghost form is way faster than anything else, but characters hang out in specific locations, meaning most of the time to interact with a character as a character, you have some walking to do. One character goes faster with his ability, but it's drugs so it makes your screen all fuzzy and annoying to look at. 

Which segways me into the abilities, which I feel are wasted potential. Other than one allowing you to sequence break (Gwen's peeking ability unlocks the room for you as a ghost, allowing you to enter rooms a chapter early) they're all fairly useless or have very specific uses. 

Finally, the ending is such ""you have to do these specific things in this specific order"" 90s adventure game bull shit I was pulling my hair out. I don't care, I used a guide. You will too, because the entire game trains you to exhaust every dialogue option, but now, at the very end, the solution is to use specific dialogue in a specific order with specific characters, AFTER making sure you get the easily missable dialogue that could make it impossible to get the good ending. It's so 90s it hurts.

Ultimately, that's why this review is a recommend. If you love 90s adventure game bullshit minus moon logic but with an extra heaping of rub everything on everything followed by a side of ""do this specific thing in this specific order or else. and better make sure you found all the missable stuff!"" then you will probably love this. I hate that kind of thing, so the back half of the game became a slog to me. The mystery was interesting enough that I wanted to see what happened, and the art and music was good, so I powered through, but I was very close to quitting at points. 

Also, save often, characters can become stuck and you can fly out of the map.",1706131035,1706131035,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

If you make another game in this series, I would recommend the 'full control' mode to be an expansion of the regular dialogue trees rather than a separate set of dialogue options that you can use while controlling anyone. It was quite strange to see X character ask if they though X was guilty, for example.

Also, even if you can only uncover the mystery using your ghost powers, it'd be nice if you didn't have to use direct possession to incriminate and catch someone. It just feels like a bit of a cop out.

It is at the same time a common genre and yet one that doesn't seem to have very many good examples to pull from. Most simply have you follow a red line through the aesthetics of a mystery, without much input from the player themself. Well, I'm happy to say that Why Am I Dead At Sea (quite a mouthful of a title) is not one of those games. Here we have instead a great example of how to do mystery right – with depth, maturity, creativity and a crew full of ogres.

With ogres I of course mean the Shrek kind, because these characters sure have layers. You are a ghost looking to solve your own murder, and the main way you do this is by possessing the people on the ship. You do so by getting to know them, as the game puts it, which might lead you to believe that you know everything there is to know about them. What is great is that you won’t. Seeing into their thoughts, snooping through their room and even walking about in their skin is just not enough, because there can still be a surprise that you didn’t see coming, a secret they hid from you. This game really understands that in order to make a mystery game interesting, the characters can’t just lie to each other, they have to lie to the player as well.

On top of that, there is just a lot of details put into the cast. Every character has their own text scroll “voice”, their own music and their own thoughts and skills. They even walk differently, with some characters walking faster or slower than others, and they move around the ship in a way that makes sense for them and the story at large. All of them have different ways of doing things and they’re all useful in solving the problems the game throws at you. That’s not even mentioning that they all have their personal stories to share, all with set up and great pay off. All of this makes these characters more than just colourful, more than just charismatic and quirky; it makes them feel like people. It’s simply great.

There are more positives I can list, from dialogue to plot structure to the resolution of it all, but I’m afraid I’ll spoil the experience of getting surprised throughout the game. Instead, I will mention a couple of flaws. One, the movement is a bit clunky, especially in your spirit form. It’s not a big problem, but it can feel a bit irritating when you’re chasing someone that you want to talk to or possess. Two, there are bugs in this game, mainly one I had the misfortune to run into twice where I got stuck in a wall when climbing the stairs, soft-locking the game and requiring a restart. Save your game, and do it often! I learned this the hard way, having to replay some sections because of the bug.

Overall though, Why Am I Dead At Sea is a great mystery game, requiring you to actually solve the riddles with only limited guidance and the possibility of failure to keep you on your toes. It deserves more attention than it has gotten and should be what other games in the genre aspire to be. Play it. You won’t regret it.",1671053274,1671053274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

You are the body! More to the point, you’re the soul that has left the body that is presumably dead, and it’s your soul mission (see what I did there?!) to figure out who dunnit!

The gameplay is pretty straightforward. You play as Smilla, the spirit of the dead captain, and influence the thoughts and actions of the other people aboard the ship in order to uncover the gruesome truth behind your apparent murder. To accomplish this, you can possess the passengers and crew members and steer conversations and search for clues. Now, Why Am I Dead at Sea is actually a spiritual successor (I really should stop, but I won’t!) to the devs’ original flash game simply called Why Am I Dead. This is relevant because there are some major quality of life improvements to the possession mechanic. For starters, you can’t just go hopping into anyone’s body all willy-nilly, ya silly-billy! No, you must unlock the ability to do so by learning vulnerable secrets about the rest of the cast of characters in order initially to gain limited control over them and eventually total control. You must have the characters interact with one another, as well as the environment in order to accomplish this. 

Seems like a perfect recipe for f<3<3<3 around and find out, don’t it? On the contrary! To help guide you, you have a spiritually prescient kid named Paulo who has locked himself in his room and can only be interacted with when you're in spirit form. In fact, he’s the one who helped you materialize in the realm of the living in the first place! So, it’s only fair that he also provides hints in order to steer you in the right direction. And I’ve gotta say, these hints are really well-written. For the most part, the devs do an excellent job of doling out cryptic hints that offer great satisfaction when you figure out just what you’re supposed to do next and why. There were one or two moments where I had absolutely no clue, but I’d rather that than an in-game line saying, “Hey, stupid. Go look in the thing and do the thing.” And I doubt anyone could be perfect at this, but this team got d<3<3<3-near close to perfection in my opinion. 

To aid you further in figuring out what to do next, the devs also added a feature where each character has their own unique ability that is relevant to the story, as well as to their overall characterization. I will say, though, some of these are more useful than others. That being said, it’s a really interesting feature that encourages further immersion in the world of the game. Along the way, the other characters also reveal information about the presumably dead captain, and as you learn more about who you’re really playing as, her spirit starts to materialize more and her ability to interact with and impact the environment around the rest of the characters increases. F<3<3<3ing brilliant!

There are so many good things to say about this game. The writing is strong. There are some really nice twists in the plot that, while you may or may not see them coming, d<3<3<3 will you be thrilled to be on one hell of a ride! But the shining star of the writing would have to be the characterization. Each character has so much depth, which is a crowning achievement, considering there are 11 characters (including the captain and Paulo). But oh my goodness! Some of these characters and the shtuff they’ve been through had me absolutely weeping and fighting back the desire to Persona 4 my way through my computer screen to give them the biggest effing hug my spindly arms could muster! The amount of care and attention that went into crafting each character pays off immensely in making this an intriguing murder mystery. Every character has motivations for being on this ship, and none of them are willing to divulge everything, let alone be truthful even when it’s apparent that someone actually murdered the captain. 

Another strong element in this game is the atmosphere. If there are any retro fans out there, just think Earthbound. Everything from the text boxes to the character designs to the midi-style soundtrack just screams retro. Heck, I’m sold!

Finally, let’s talk about quite possibly the best part of this game. The soundtrack. I’m a bit of a music nerd. Some might say snob. Those people will be dealt with accordingly. But my God! This soundtrack is incredible. Bill Kiley does an amazing job of staying on brand with the retro vibes while still creating complex musical compositions that do a whole lot of heavy lifting! Each character has his or her own musical theme, and none of them are just a simple motif that gets repeated ad nauseum. We have actual instrumentation to bless our earholes! For example, Marcurio’s theme has voices singing in a very dramatic operatic style, which is actually a very relevant choice once you learn a little bit more about what makes that guy tick. 

And can I just gush about Donovan’s theme? That is my new pump-up jam! And the pacing of when you actually have unfettered access to that theme is perfection itself! Without spoiling anything, Donovan becomes accessible at a very crucial moment in the game’s plot, and having his theme play as you’re figuring things out and piecing the mystery together was a brilliant choice. 

I don’t say this often. Maybe only once before in one of my reviews. But this game deserves a higher price tag. The game itself takes several hours to complete, especially if, like me, you really immerse yourself in the mystery and settle in for a thrilling ride. On top of that, there are multiple endings. And, like, the overall presentation – the way various elements, all so strong in their own rights, come together and crystallize so magnificently – is so satisfying to me both as a retro video game fan and as a murder mystery fan. Seriously, how can I give you more of my money?!",1665172004,1665172004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Let down by the graphics a bit, especially in the endings, where characters can literally witness people being shot directly in front of them without a single emotion on their faces. A lot of it felt kind of rushed, but maybe I just prefer a slower pacing. Also would have benefited from a few quality of life improvements - I never quite got the hang of saving, and would've also preferred not having to detour to the dining room every time I wanted to save, and an ability to skip dialogue would've helped immensely, especially when playing the final confrontation 5 times for all the endings. I suppose some mysteries always go unanswered, but I would've liked more closure on the player character - do they pass on? Is their body ever found? Maybe it's a function of the possession system, like in Ghost Trick, but it weirdly doesn't feel like the player character is at all that fleshed out.

However, for the most part, despite all this, the game really worked! I found the mysteries compelling, I liked the influence/possession system. I enjoyed learning more about these characters, especially Quella and Darryl (although I wish more characters had the psychological confrontations that Darryl and Gwen had, I also get that they had a LOT more going on psychologically than the rest of the non-villainous main cast), and I liked the power system. Kind of like Disco Elysium, where you're brought in to investigate one dead body and suddenly you're talking to cryptids and trying to resolve decades old political beef, this is one of those games that starts off with a fairly small scale premise (solve your own murder) and then branches out substantially by the end. If you can look past some of the flaws, which I clearly did since I played this game to 100% completion, I think there's a really neat little game here. It's fairly brief and inexpensive, so I'd recommend giving it a shot for anyone into short closed room mysteries that go a little off the rails at the end.",1659791712,1659791712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Jako że twoje zwłoki szczęśliwie nie leżą specjalnie daleko, twój duch wciąż może zasuwać przez mały wycieczkowy statek. Pasażerowie go nie lubią, załoga nienawidzi, każdy chce tylko dotrzeć do portu i znaleźć wreszcie święty spokój. Nie masz znowu tak dużo czasu, by odkryć, kim byłeś za życia i dlaczego je tak gwałtownie zakończono.

Co jest HOT:
+ oryginalny system opierający się na opętaniach, wykorzystywaniu umiejętności (swoich oraz cudzych) i roszadach bohaterów;
+ bardzo duży nacisk na poznawanie bohaterów, ich charakterów, motywacji, celów;
+ ""karty"" obrazujące stan mentalny postaci przez symboliczne, proste wizualia i zdawkowe zdania - elegancki sposób na przekazanie wiele o obsadzie bez wykładania kawy na ławę, potrafi wziąć z zaskoczenia;
+ nagradzanie gracza za bycie drobiazgowym;
+ detektywistyczny, nerwowy finał;
+ dołujący, melancholijny klimat z przebłyskami spokojnej nadziei, gdzie najlepsze zakończenie (którego dorwanie jest bardzo oczyszczające) może być tylko słodko-gorzkie. 

Co WIESZ, TO ZALEŻY:
~ to jest przygodówka bez przedmiotów i puzzli: cała robota detektywistyczna sprowadza się głównie do uzyskiwania informacji przez opętanie odpowiedniej osoby, by porozmawiała z inną odpowiednią osobą;
~ gra ma dość niespieszne tempo, przed trzecim aktem akcja dość powoli się rozwija. 

A co NOT:
- jak na grę, która wymaga takiego przemieszczania się w tę i z powrotem po piętrach - tak jakby nie pomyślano o jakimś przycisku do biegania;
- muzyka nie zawsze pasuje klimatem do tego, co się dzieje na ekranie;
- dlaczego nic nie ma w toaletach, dlaczego nikt zgodnie z tradycją nie schował klucza w kiblu;
- rozumiem, o co chodziło w tym zabiegu w kontekście oczekiwań i założeń gracza, ale jednak odcięcie od systemu wskazówek w takim momencie było dość... niesprzyjające, zwłaszcza że to etap, w którym łatwo utknąć. 

""Why Am I Dead At Sea"" pozytywnie mnie zaskoczyło - przede wszystkim melancholijnym klimatem ze szczególnym posmakiem beznadziei, gdzie bohaterowie uwikłani w poważne problemy i traumy wciąż mogą znaleźć coś pięknego. Historie i relacje postaci szczerze mnie obchodziły, odkryło każdy dialog i sekrecik dla samej radości odkrywania, a system przygodówkowy skupiający się wydobywaniu informacji jest oryginalny i jakby pode mnie.

But that's neither here nor there. What matters is that this game is a story-telling masterpiece; a simultaneously disturbing and heart-wrenching character study that examines the struggles and horrors that occur during our everyday lives that, more often than not, we are completely oblivious to. The narrative forces players to question their own place in the world as well as those of others around them. 

The game revolves around you, a ghost aboard the S.S. Douce Amere, possessing the ship's passengers in order to uncover clues about your death through initiating conversations with other characters. At the same time, you will learn more about these characters' personalities, motivations and personal lives. In essence, the gameplay loop boils down to interacting with characters and objects. Thankfully, the cast of this game is well-developed, multifaceted and realistic, and by the end, the player's connection with all of them will be so strong that they will feel like real people. All of this is accompanied by beautiful pixel graphics in the same style as EarthBound/Mother and a soulful, haunting soundtrack that is just as varied, engaging and touching as the characters themselves. 

I know the term ""hidden gem"" is tossed around a lot nowadays and has lost some of its meaning as a result. However, if there is one game that truly fits the definition of ""hidden gem"", it's this one. Peltast Software have created a work of art with this game. I'm not sure where they are or what they're up to now, but I sincerely hope to see more from them in the future.

It was fascinating, the mechanics are something I've never seen before, and I always like to support games that do something different.  For the price, it was well worth it so if you're even a little curious then I would suggest you check it out.  The characters are fleshed out and interesting and I found something compelling about each one (yes, even that one), and the game tackles many dark themes with respect for them.  (My only sore point there was thinking one of the guys had a husband for a hot second and getting really excited, but then it was a predictable plot element that was well handled, but extremely played out and unoriginal.)

That said, the bugs absolutely kill it.  I enjoyed the quick movement speeds, but I lost out on progress constantly because I got stuck or characters got stuck on geometry and couldn't make it to locations where I needed them.  There was a really solid hint system towards the beginning of the game that I enjoyed, but towards the end things kind of fell apart and lost the consistent thread of revelation, so it became this chore of ""warg into X, check for dialogue, warg into Y, check for dialogue, warg into Z, check for dialogue, warg back into X,"" rinse repeat, until I looked up a walkthrough to discover that some dialogue cues actually weren't showing up for me to start with.  To top it all off, when I finally got to the end, the game crashed on the final cutscene.

So this review is being posted in the heat of frustration and disappointment and I may soften it later, but having to look up the ending on YouTube because the game won't run is I think a tragic cap-off to a game this otherwise nuanced and exceptional.  I would still say buy it, it's not expensive and it supports a game of rare style and quality (apart from its shortcomings), just be aware going in that these frustrating moments exist and you may get very unlucky with your finale to this experience.

Word of caution: You should download the kind of, but not really, free prequel from the creators, called Why Am I Dead: http://www.peltastsoftware.com/content.html?id=waid, it'll help you a lot to understand this game, and the story.

Basically, you're a ghost with no recollection of what happened to you, or who you are. You're in a boat, and a kid is able to speak to you. From this point forward, you'll have to get inside people's bodies to try to control their movement, but not their actions, you're just a push in their inner mind to actually say something. As you learn about the diverse characters, you'll be able to haunt them, deepen the plot, and understand more about what transcurred in the ship.

It can feel kind of like a puzzle, sometimes you might not be really sure what your next step should be, and that's where a certain character will be able to help you, so you don't get stuck. You'll be able to reach the ending easily, or if you're a bit slower, with patience. Now, reaching the different endings requires more deep thinking and certain actions, and I recommend you saving just before finishing the game for certain reasons.

Why Am I Dead At Sea doesn't think the player is stupid. It doesn't hand hold you. It expects you to think hard, and remember evidences. Do not get discouraged by the price, the length or the graphics. It's a very especial experience that is really beautiful and will stay with me for a long time.

Pros:
-An extremely compelling story, absolutely worth playing through every possible way.
-Characters that you'll either love or love to hate.
-Speaking of characters, their backstories, personalities, and motivations. They all have one or two things grating away at their minds, and it's wonderful to learn about everything they think about.
-Very clever mechanics in terms of being a spirit and moving the alive passengers down the right path.
-The special abilities of the alive passengers are all pretty cool also... at least, the ones that assist in gameplay/story.

Cons:
-It can be a little tedious to move back and forth through the rooms, but the map is fairly small so it's not that big of a con.
-The ""correct path"" isn't straightforward as a story-based game like this should probably be. Thankfully, there's a character you meet early on named Paulo who can help you in the right direction. However, in the final chapter you can no longer ask Paulo for help. The puzzles in that chapter are extremely out-of-the-box, but I admit I'm kind of dumb, so take that with a grain of salt.
-There are 4 endings. (or 5, if you count the two versions of the bad ending) This on its own is cool, but if you miss one piece of evidence, you may not be able to get every ending on your first save file. I was able to get two of the 4 endings, but the other two required a piece of evidence that I had no idea even existed. So yes, I did not 100% this game, but that comes down to me not wanting to start the game over, despite it being very possible to beat within the span of a day.

If I could suggest an improvement, I'd have liked a map that shows where all the characters are on the ship. I feel like I spent a lot of time hunting down the person I was looking for since the characters do move on their own.

At first the scale of the ship and the number of doors is overwhelming, as is the realisation that you aren't looking to talk to each character but each character AS each other character!  and that's before later abilities become clear.

For the most part though it's surprisingly manageable, each is unlocked in turn and generally the next step is easy to work out but not thrown in your face. I only got stuck once.  Feeling like I've figured most things out and that progression is natural is a sign of great writing. 

The characters are great, each has a lot of flesh to their personality that you'll chew through eventually, and the mystery has a few layers and twists going on, it took a while for me to feel invested in the story but I got there.  Some of the themes are darker and deeper than expected and they can suddenly come out of left field but they fit, they don't feel out of place and they give a deeper investment to the story as a whole.

Some of the mechanics are wonderfully clever and really squeeze some unexpected ingenuity out of a very limited toolkit. I would say it's a bit of a letdown that a lot of the abilities are completely useless, even some that feel like they should lead to some major clues.  The read/unread dialogue feature is frequently buggy which is annoying, and a hold-to-speed-through-text button would be a godsend

On the downside, there are some combinations of dialogue which don't make sense (e.g. discussing Gwen.. as Gwen) and I'll say outright the endings are unsatisfying. The story truly felt like there was another layer and another chapter to go through which would turn some things on their head but alas the conclusion hits you at speed and the finale is awkward.  Trying to hunt the endings was incredibly frustrating and felt like that part was rushed, a real shame.  Closure is.. definitely lacking, too.

As a tldr, slow start and the ending is unsatisfying but I'd still say the journey was fun

The art style is [i]very[/i] reminiscent of the Mother series and despite manual control over characters, it is effectively a visual novel. 

It's presentation is largely welcoming and much of the dialogue is humorous, but it is immediately apparent that the narrative contains dark elements. Sometimes, this presents itself in ways that are gratuitous, but mostly, the insidious elements are well-woven into the characters. (This game does not appear to be rated by the ESRB, but I suspect it would be rated ""Mature"" for ""Blood, Violence, Sexual Themes, and Strong Language"". Players sensitive to topics such as suicide, sex abuse, torture, and murder should be forewarned.)

[i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] has the same pitfalls of all visual novels and adventure games, which is that the player must often resort to exhausting every dialogue option to advance the plot. Exhausting the dialogue trees is especially exhausting when you are more than one person. Every person has different things to say depending on whom you are possessing and just how deeply you are possessing them, and hunting for the one flag can be tedious. With that said, the game provides visual indicators of what characters have something new to say, which alleviates the slog.

The game does have some bugs, however. Some of them make it unclear which options in a dialogue tree have been previously chosen, which causes the player to unnecessarily revisit some content. Most damning was a bug I encountered early on that caused the character I was controlling to race up two flights of stairs and soft-lock the game. Ultimately, these were an annoyance for me, but not a deal-breaker. The old adage holds: ""Save early, and save often!"" (And don't worry about missing significant content by saving after an event. There's very little you can miss in this way.)

A review often seeks to answer ""Is it worth the money?"" Yes. I purchased the game when it was only $1, but even had I payed full price (still only $5), I would have gotten my money's worth. That said, I think the better question amid the thousands of games available to a player is ""Is it worth the time?""

Yes, again. This game isn't any longer than it needs to be, and a significant percentage of the play time is discovering new things about what is happening on the ship and who the characters are. They are all deeply troubled, and many of them appear to be well-established tropes, but none of them are one-dimensional, and many of them are dynamic. The endings were a little lackluster - especially because there are technically five of them, but the journey is interesting. The conversation the game has with the player has value.

Whether you are undecided or think you'll be really into this, I recommend first playing the developer's original flash game, [i]Why Am I Dead?[/i] - or rather, the superior remake [i]Why Am I Dead:Rebirth[/i]. Its characters are not as fleshed out, and the scenario is not as well-developed, but it has a similar feel and appearance, and it delivers its payload within a much shorter period of time. (Also, the true ending of [/i]Rebirth[i] ties in with this game. Mind the bugs, though! It does have some issues that can force a player to restart.)",1584871053,1584871237,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First of all, the concept is great. I love the idea of slowly finding out who you are, and your conversations with the boy who can see ghosts, as well as taking control of people in order to use their conversations to talk to others. Using everyone's special abilities was cool in most cases (some were kinda useless, but my favorites were probably Quella's - added a lot of character information by identifying tone of voice - and Ferdinand's - a bunch of silly ""announcements"" that made me laugh). The mystery was fairly interesting, and it was reasonably satisfying to root out the evil goings-on on the ship, particularly as you piece together clues little-by-little and start realizing what's going on.

However, the reason I say I have mixed feelings is because the game is not without its flaws. Despite the engaging nature of the concept, the actual gameplay is rather unintuitive, and as one review pointed out, your only real strategy is trying to exhaust all your dialogue between every character, and with all the characters constantly moving around, this can be a pain, especially when you gain the ability to fully possess people, which unlocks even more conversation options. This was somewhat amended by being able to ask Paulo for hints when it seemed entirely non-obvious about what you should do next, but unfortunately you can't always do that, or he'll sometimes give you hints that only cover stuff you've already done. Chapters 4 and 5 were absolutely the most frustrating in this regard, and I ended up having to consult a walkthrough to figure out what I was supposed to do next. Some sort of mental journal, where you could keep track of the information you've learned in an organized manner, would have greatly helped things, since it's nearly impossible to keep every bit of dialogue in your head, especially when some things turn out to be red herrings. It doesn't help that the game doesn't appear to have been entirely bug-tested, seeing as while walking around normally I glitched into walls three separate times and became trapped in the black area, being forced to restart from my last save. On a similar note, sometimes characters that were supposed to follow you would get stuck places and refuse to come with you, forcing you to reboot the game so they'd walk in a different place. Another frustration was that sometimes the UI would indicate that you hadn't explored a conversation topic with one person when you already had, or even worse, sometimes crucial evidence inexplicably wasn't in bold as an unexplored talking point, so you'd walk around believing you already had spoken to that person about everything.

Finally, let's get to the part of the game that I found both positive and negative points in: the characters. I'll say what I can without spoiling things, and everything else will be spoiler-tagged. Overall, the game appears to have been playing with the idea of morally-grey characters, which is a concept that I think has been well-explored in other mystery-style games I've enjoyed, such as Ghost Trick, Hotel Dusk, Ace Attorney, and Danganronpa. However, a lot of the characters that fell into the morally-grey category came off as unlikable, even if you could feel a degree of sympathy for the situation they were in. 

Example: [spoiler]Marcurio speaks of his abusive childhood and how it shaped him into being a seriously messed-up person, but it doesn't really excuse him taking extremely suspicious bribes without question and pinning the murder on Gwen, who he knew was innocent - particularly since Gwen also experienced an abusive childhood that was possibly even worse and didn't take it out on the people around her, other than her investigation of Donovan, which was arguably justified and provoked by the true killer anyway. The fact that he admits that he's a bad person in the good ending is an improvement, but nonetheless...[/spoiler] 

Example 2, and this one especially: [spoiler]Even though Donovan was a massive jerk, I was all set up to like him as an interesting character despite his meanness, since his dogged search for the truth indicated to me that he was a good person at heart who believed in truth and justice. Unfortunately, him coming back at the end and threatening to murder every man on the ship pretty much killed my respect for his sense of justice, and it was especially frustrating that characters seemed to forgive him and say he didn't deserve to die from his subsequent suicide even though he'd casually said he'd kill them all without mercy.[/spoiler]

On top of this, I thought it was rather strange that the game portrayed Alton as [spoiler]basically forgiving Xu by saying ""I know we've had our differences"" when the day before she took advantage of his crush on her to steal from him, lied about it, and then when he confronted her she told him he basically deserved it because he was privileged. Like Marcurio, I appreciated that she seemed to come to terms at least somewhat that she wasn't a good person, but I really couldn't understand Alton's complete lack of bitterness a day after he had a self-loathing mental breakdown.[/spoiler]

Finally, last negative about the characters, specifically, the main one. Like Ghost Trick, you will eventually find out who you were when you were alive. Unlike Ghost Trick, you are given almost no personality of your own, and everything about your personality is told to you by other people instead of you being able to actually experience it. The circumstances of your death are eventually revealed, but you are given no closure as to what happens to your ghost afterward in any ending. So it's incredibly difficult to get invested in who you are as a character at all, especially when there are many things about your character's past that are left completely open-ended and not explained.

All right, that was a lot of negative stuff, and I apologize, because I didn't feel entirely negative about the characters in the game. In particular, I was quite fond of Quella, Darryl, and Gwen. Quella's the most genuinely nice character in the entire game, a cheery people person who gets on well with nearly everyone and is luckily saved from being some sort of Mary Sue/manic pixie dream girl by suffering her own deep-seated insecurities about her writing and, well, some other things you'll have to find out. Darryl is a man who you will just desperately want to feel better, a ball of depression and self-hatred that you can eventually get to the bottom of with the aid of Quella, and I felt that Quella and Darryl had some of the most poignant and enjoyable conversations of the game. Quella's conversations with Gwen, a shy, extremely paranoid woman who's clearly been through hell with people who have hurt her, are a close second, and I like to imagine the three of them as the best of friends. Darryl and Gwen also had some of the most compelling segments of the game that were entirely optional, and was a really interesting way that allowed you as the player to help them overcome their trauma. I won't spoil it, but let's just say I recommend that when you get a lot of your memories back, you go talk to them while you're in ghost form.

I purchased Why Am I Dead At Sea during the Steam Winter Sale because I read a review describing it as the lovechild of Ace Attorney and Ghost Trick if their child was raised by EarthBound, and that description was enough to make me interested. However, it doesn't quite live up to any of their legacies - it lacks the whacked-out quirkiness of EarthBound, and doesn't have as many compelling characters (as well as lacking much of the humor, though the game does have its moments) as Shu Takumi's aforementioned adventure games. However, for the fun of the concept and the three characters I did end up caring about, if you're into a bit of an atypical mystery game, it might be worth checking out.",1578170724,1628753513,True,3,0,0.570032596588134766,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You don’t know who you are, you don’t know why you are here, all you know is that you were killed by someone on the ship and you need to find them before the journey ends and they escape and everyone disappears. This story has multiple endings.

The controls are deceptively simple, you just use the “Z” “X” “C” keys and WSAD or the arrow keys to move around, “Z” to interact with people or things, “X” to possess or inhabit someone’s body, and “C” to use that individuals special skill, such as looking through pockets and peeking through doors. 

This game does have some negative aspects though, during my playthroughs twice I got stuck with the stairs. Once I moved right instead of left and got stuck outside the barrier on the stairs, and the second time I moved left far too quickly and broke through the barrier on the other side, so I could walk around in the dark parts of the screen. Needless to say, please save your game often unless you are in the 4th chapter to get all endings. 
Another negative aspect was the endings. Once you find out who the killer is you get a cutscene where everyone is outside the ship all thankful to be alive, but there is no info on what happens to you. No fading away into the afterlife, no goodbyes to the few you actually manage to communicate with, no nothing. You don’t show up anymore and credits roll. No idea what happens to everyone else or you, it’s pretty disappointing.

The story is insanely compelling.

I love a good mystery and man, does this one deliver. The characters are unique; you'll love some, you'll hate some, but in the end they all really do bring life to the story. There's just one that is significantly blander than others. He has some spotlight early game, but then becomes very flat and two-dimensional shortly after, though it does seem he was designed that way. It's a shame, but it almost doesn't even matter since the other characters are so interesting and a few MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS, GODDAMMIT.
The gameplay is engaging too. The powers that you unlock as you go are pretty fun to mess around with. Admittedly, I forgot to use a couple special mechanics a few times but not because they're uninteresting, simply that the game reminds you of these after you switch characters the first couple times but fails to even tell you what some of the later character's abilities do in the first place.

It runs very similarly to RPG Maker games, has a great soundtrack that fits the scenes, runs well on older systems, and has a fantastic plot. If you're a fan of these kinds of games like I am, you'll definitely enjoy this one and its many paths. That being said, this isn't a game you'll take more than ten hours playing. I personally checked every detail available to me and was able to fully complete the game in six hours.

Initially, what stuck out to me was the characters this game has. Everyone on this ship has experienced one of the many ways life can screw you over, including you, the protagonist. This turns a band of strangers into characters that either grow further from one another or closer over time, the puzzle pieces to their individual histories being steadily uncovered as the story continues. Each character has an ability unique to them that helps you explore the ship, unravel the truth, and reveal a multitude of secrets. Mystery lovers, this one's for you!

Furthermore, the game's atmosphere of suspicion lasts from the start to the end. You're constantly finding new details and objects that point to several suspects, only for something else to occur and throw you for a loop. In this story, you and you alone can solve this mystery surrounding your own untimely demise and the ship's secrets. Friends, blackmail, and distrust await you! Feels like an episode of the Twilight Zone, no?

In addition, we have the game itself, minus the fascinating plot and characters. The art, music, and subtle details show that the developers behind this game's creation weren't just slapping something together. No, they focused on putting together the perfect scenery and sounds to build this work of art -  the perfect mixture of thrills, chills, drama, and mystery personified through the use of well-crafted maps, sprites, and compositions. This is most typically a rarity in Indie games, as developers usually use parts of other games and royalty-free music so that they can spend more time cultivating their story.

These many goods things do not make this game perfect, by any means, though. The most bothersome part of this game for me was the glitches. On occasion, characters will get trapped in places. In some scenarios, they may even get stuck inside walls, making it impossible to advance the scenario (especially if you're stuck with them). Unfortunately, I often make the mistake of not saving the games I play often, leading to incidents like this where I have to return to an old save and ensue a do-over. That being said, this game's glitches are sometimes fixed by possessing a character or by just talking with them, though this is not always the case. Moral of the story: be sure to save often!

As a final note, I will say that this game is definitely for those who love a good RPG Maker-esque game in general. It isn't costly, and if you're an achievement hunter like me, it won't annoy you by making you play five more times just to get ""that one ending that requires you to already have beaten the game X amount of times."" I'll conclude this by not boring people with a wall of praises and simply say that this game is fitting for those who enjoy a variety of qualities in their games, such as suspense, intrigue, and adventure. Now, stop reading this semi-long review and buy this great game!

He often reviews RPG Maker games, and if you enjoy RPG Maker games at all, then chances are you'll love this game just as much, if not more. From personal experience, I don't *think* this game was made using RPG Maker, but its mechanics are certainly similar enough for someone to believe so. 

Regardless of that, this game is pretty amazing. It's been quite a while since I've been sucked into a game so much that I didn't hesitate to play it all the way to the end(s) in one sitting. The basic concept of this game is you play as a ghost who has lost its memories and is trapped on a cruise ship with a handful of other crew members. You have to use your abilities as a ghost to interact with the people and your surroundings to uncover the mystery behind your death. 

For pixel graphics, they aren't the best I've seen, but they're not bad at all, either. Plus, 8-bit music is playing throughout the majority of the game and this music goes along with the visuals pretty darn well. 

Where this game really shines is through its unique game mechanics and its story. First off, there isn't too much actual ""gameplay"" in this game. Don't expect any action sequences or anything like that. This game is heavily story-based, and other than that, the only other thing is somewhat like a puzzle or strategy game. For the most part, you just walk around and talk to people. There's a little more to it, but walking around and talking is roughly around 95% of the game. 

However, there is one unique feature that makes this interesting: you can possess people. Since you play as a ghost, possessing people will change the dialog for about every single character on the ship. You'll have to learn a bit about your character before you're able to possess them, but this will happen naturally as the game progresses so it's nothing to worry about. 

Anyways, other than possessing people just to change character dialog, each person you possess also has their own unique skill. I'll hold off from spoiling some of the neater, more useful skills, but as an example, one character can change what music is playing while another character can check what's in someone's pockets. These skills often aren't necessary to progress gameplay (and some are straight up useless like the music-changing one), but lots of them are encouraged to be used as they can add to the overall story. Speaking of which... 

This game's story is AMAZING. While the unique ability to possess characters is pretty addicting in itself, I never expected this game's story to outrank its unique game mechanics. Of course, I can't spoil the story for anyone, but I've played lots of RPG Maker games and while this game's story isn't necessarily the best I've ever played through, it's certainly on up there. It's essentially a murder mystery, after all. That being said, this game will betray your expectations with its story on multiple occasions. Right when I would mentally label a character as innocent/guilty, the game would find a way to prove me wrong. Also, maybe I'm just a bit of a baby, but I actually felt sad from some parts of the story, so I guess I'll give a minor feels warning. 

Anyways, to refrain from accidentally giving away anything related to the overall story or its ending, I'll leave it at that. If you like story games, murder mysteries, or RPG Maker games (or you just wanna possess people as a ghost because that's fun) then I'd definitely say this game is worth a try. It's not the BEST game ever, but it was pretty freakin' amazing and it surpassed my expectations quite a lot.

I found ""Why Am I Dead At Sea"" when looking through well-reviewed ""Story Rich"" titles on Steam. The premise sounded awesome - possessing people to investigate your own murder!? Come on!?

There is a lot to like about the title. First of all, the music is catchy, and developer Peltast Software has put in a great deal of work ensuring that the passengers on the ship are three-dimensional. My favorites were Darryl, Quella, Gwen, and Donovan. It's possible that the other characters were just as fleshed out as these, but I didn't create the right circumstances for this dialogue to occur. Each character has a special ability that you can access while possessing them, but these varied quite a bit in quality. Some were extremely useful, such as the cat's jump, Quella's empathy, and Gwen's snooping. Others, however, such as Darryl's pill-popping and Alton's music-changing, I had little use for. The ability that you gain as a ghost to hear the thoughts of the other passengers was fascinating. Not only do you see what the character is thinking, but you also get a feel for the urgency or mood associated with the thought through the graphical design of the reveal.

Although I liked getting to know these characters, I can't say I really enjoyed the game. I got stuck at one point, when looking through the room of another passenger with Gwen. I was under the impression that I would need to break into the passenger's computer to thoroughly understand what they were up to. I scoured the ship looking for that password. Instead, I just needed to report what little I'd found to the first mate. I also got stuck through no fault of my own, when my character model glitched outside of the level. This happened on three occasions, and I had to reload a previous save each time. The first time, I lost about 30 minutes of progress, which was pretty disheartening. Another issue is with replaying the dialogue. If you're interested in what a character would say if you responded in all the ways possible, you can expect to click through entire conversations multiple times. In addition, characters are shown as having something new to say when you speak to them with a different possessed character, even if the conversation options are identical.

Perhaps I'm an idiot, but the story also never quite added up to anything for me. I exhausted all the conversation options I could think of prior to setting in motion the final scene, but ended up getting the worst ending, an inconclusive one. I had an idea in my mind of what I thought had occurred, based on some late-game conversation I had as the cat, but when I went into the final scene, this conclusion was nowhere to be found.

I liked the creativity in the game and the careful craft of creating these passengers, but the glitches and overall story make it difficult to recommend.",1540838075,1540838241,False,0,0,0.403046190738677979,1,True,False,False,False,,,

-Clunky movement is a bit of a downer (minor nitpick).

So, this game is quite unique in its kind. At core it's a murder mystery with excellent writing and truly believable characters who are all flawed and likeable in their own way. The story is not predictable and entertaining throughout.

All that comes in a full 8-bit package, which reaches astonishingly realistic levels of neo-retro - from the good: the swanky pixel graphics and the excellent soundtrack - to the bad: the clunky game mechanics which require a lot of repeat actions, and quite a lot of bugs - I don't think I have ever seen a modern game that reproduces the frustrationa of 1980's games so well.

A lot of effort clearly went into the soundtrack, with different themes befitting each character. I really liked the mind-reading ability (shown in some of the screenshots above).  The length is fairly short, but appropriate, as the story doesn't feel at all rushed or underdeveloped.

A few small warnings: Like a lot of games that leave a lot of dialogue options and possible actions open to the player at once, things can get a little wonky if you do things in an unexpected order.  For example, near the end of the game, I wound up with access to a room with important evidence, but without the ability to interact with anything.  Thankfully I eventually figured out I need to have a few conversations over again, and that resolved the issue.  Frustrating, but since I didn't have to start from the beginning as I'd feared, it didn't impair my enjoyment of the game that much.  Much higher budget games have certainly had similar issues.

There are some bugs as well.  A few times, my character somehow got catapulted outside the playable area, onto the black background.  I was unable to get back in and had to exit the game.  I'd recommend saving pretty often in case this happens.

Мой обзор не будет клешированной и пресной рецензией псевдообзорщика, который заканчивает факультет журналистики, я попытаюсь объяснить, чем эта игра отличается от остальных, при этом не спойлеря.

Название говорит само за себя, мы ищем ответ на вопрос: кто, как и почему. На этом завязывается весь сюжет. И он не из таких, что догадаться невозможно, немного логики и преступник сам раскроет свои карты.

Игра порадовала своим гейплеем. Для меня это в новизну, как и для большинства, есть некая схожесть с ""Murdered: soul suspect"", но тут нет мистики, считаю это колоссальным плюсом. За все ~10 часов геймплея вам не будет скучно, потому что вы не попросту не успеваете, прохождение довольно динамичное.

За что я люблю подобные инди проекты - они не нацелены на массу, разработчик делает игру из удовольствия, он не пытается угодить кому-либо, приквел игре вообще флеш-игра на сайте, не имеющего русификатора (там простой английскйи, попробуйте, но после того, как пройдете эту)

Музыка крайне спорная вещь, у каждого свое восприятие, но музыки, режущей мои уши не обнаружено, скорее наоборот, пару треков добавил к себе (Questions Piling Up, Calm and Collected, Sinister People), созданные Bill'ом Kiley.

И наконец, я оставил то, за что я полюбил эту игру. Философия. Я не ожидал ее здесь встретить. Игра раскрывает сущность людей, их цинизм. Думаю отличным доказательством будет пример: ""Люди...Вы ничем не лучше всех остальных. Просто рабы своих инстинктов и эмоций"".  
Я бы мог привести больше примеров, но какой смысл проходить игру, если я все расскажу уже здесь, в обзоре.

В игре есть баги, но недавно автор выпустил обновление с их исправлением, что удивило, игра уже не новая.
Для нашего сегмента присутствует русификатор, тоже недавно внедрен, раньше пользовался неофициальной русификацией (она лучше), но лучше проходить на английском.

The game has a way of fostering empathy and relatability for a majority of the characters as you learn their deeper/darker side. It's interesting how much the developer(s?) did with so little in terms of graphics and mechanics. The music wasn't bad either though there were points where some songs could become rather repetitive depending on how long you were stuck with a particular character.

My only gripes are that there's only one save (that I could find, though there's an achievement for unlocking more) and you'll want to save often as it's not uncommon to go through a whole lot of dialogue just to encounter a game-breaking wall glitch and have to start over. To avoid it, attempt not to go too fast when in spirit form and transitioning from room to room.

It has its own internal logic but it really only makes more sense after you've already beaten the game.

It's very nice that the devs are continuing to support this game, even 2 years after release.

[h1]Setting and Gameplay[/h1]
You play as a ghost, trying to solve your own murder...

You are on a ship, with many mysterious characters. You don't remember them at all, but they must have something to do with your death!

Starting with a cat, you have the ability to possess living beings. This becomes the most important game mechanic, as you start to learn more about each of your fellow ship passengers by interacting with them with your borrowed body/bodies.

The more you learn about people, the more you are able to possess. This then unlocks different abilities (some people are able to enter restricted areas of the ship, for example).

[h1]Thoughts on Story[/h1]
Without revealing any spoilers, I'd say the ghost mechanic and the story writing is very well integrated. It felt like I was in a mystery movie, and the other characters are written with depth and multidimensional personalities. It didn't feel like a chore to learn about them, even if on the surface level, you might be talking to them in the hopes of manipulating them so you can enter a secret room on the ship!

There are multiple endings as well, depending what conclusions and choices you come to. Each ending has different reveals, for example one character is completely psycho but you do not see that on any other route. It was pretty fun to get the different endings, and I was happy to learn the most I could about everyone's dark secrets and motivation.

+ Well-written story. Even though it's not particularly hard to discover what's actually going on when you pay close attention to the clues, the way characters interact with one another, and their individual quirks, will still provide a lot of plot twists and make the story a wild ride.

+ The possession mechanic, which makes most of the gameplay, is pretty interesting. Since the ghost you're playing can't interact with items or other characters, you'll have to possess the boat's passengers to do so. However, characters you possess don't actually know there's a ghost that makes them do weird stuff, so whenever you possess character A they won't be able to ask character B about info you discovered with character C, unless you know enough about them to enable full possession and take them over completely. Basically it separates player knowledge from character knowledge, and you progress by learning how to merge them.

+ I loved the mind-reading screens. The ghost you're playing can ""scan"" other characters, and when you do it you get some kind of psychedelic screen representing their overall mindstate and thoughts (with their theme playing in the background). They get updated as the story progress and will often get very mindfuckey. I don't know why I liked this feature so much but I think it played a huge part in the characters' development.

- The engine is pretty awful (it's the dreaded Adobe Air). Prepare for unexpected freezes and glitches, and backup your saves often.

- The title is kinda silly (although it's apparently some kind of homage to the [url=https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/606173]flash game[/url] that was this game's prototype).

You start the game raising up as a ghost on a cruise ship with no memories of your past. Helped by a psychic boy [spoiler](and later on another ghost)[/spoiler] who can see and talk to you, the game mostly consists of you possessing people and talking to other passengers in order to learn more about them and your past self, while uncovering the mystery of your death.
Each character has its own ability, useful (looking into people's pocket or see inside locked rooms...), or not (changing the music broadcast on the ship, making stupid radio announcements...).

There are a few bugs here and there where characters tend to get stuck into walls or stairs (twice, I had two different passengers getting stuck on the stairs on the second floor, the third time was the cat getting stuck in a wall). I don't know if those will be fixed anytime soon, but I highly recommend to learn how to save the game as soon as you start playing. Otherwise, when you encounter your first bug, you will realize that you need to start over because you forgot to save anything, like I did... There are no automatic saves, so save often! There are 3 savepoints, one on each floor, the first one you find being the Teddy bear in the room where you start the game.

Despite the bugs, the captivating storyplot will get you hooked on the game. There are also 5 possible endings to uncover giving some replayability to the game.

You can possess characters on the ship once you get to know them a little and then talk to the other passengers on the ship, but you can only answer in ways that character would. Most of the game is spent talking to other characters about what's currently going on in the story and it feels really rewarding when you can take control of someone new. I really liked the cast of characters in the game and I also think the pacing is really good since there's a goal in every chapter and the overall mystery of the murder and the main character and the ship in general is really interesting.

There are a few other gameplay mechanics outside of possession and you unlock them the further into the game you get. You can take a look into people's minds to see what kind of people they are, and once you fully solve a characters problem you can fully control them and ask questions that the ghost would ask. Each character also has their own ability - some of them are pointless like changing the music but there are some useful ones like looking through doors and seeing what items a character is holding. This also gives each character a bit more personality.

The graphics remind me of something like Earthbound, especially with the characters, and it looks nice overall. The ship isn't very large so there isn't much to see, but still, it's nice. The soundtrack is also good, there's a new music track depending on what chapter you're on and each character has their own theme when you're controlling them. It's a mixture of chiptune and modern instruments and each track fits the mood well. My only real issue with the game is there are some missable achievements that are annoying, but the game is short enough if you're not talking to everybody so it's not the end of the world.

You play as the ghost of a person who was just killed on a boat. You are greeted by a kid who can talk to the dead who is able to tell you some basic information about where you are. You then have to go around the boat, possessing people as a means of interviewing everyone on board to find out who the murderer is.

What I like:
All the characters have a different personality and background. As you interview them you may be surprised by their individual histories and motivations for the future. The concept of possessing others to get them to talk to each other is interesting. Each character also has their own unique ability like peeking through doorknobs or reading people's emotions, but not all character abilities are useful to solving the case. There are several possible endings based on how much information you collect and your ability to conclude who the guilty party is at the end.

What I don't like:
I will admit this is a personal dislike, but this game contains some strong language. If you don't like the f-bomb, avoid this game. An NPC did get stuck on a corner in one of my playthroughs, and it was before I could possess him, so he was stuck there until I progressed the story meaning I couldn't complete a specific conversation involving him. I suspect this game could be buggy if you tried to find them.

Я купила ""Why Am I Dead At Sea"" на распродаже, поведясь на приятную пиксельную графику, неприлично низкую цену в 50 рублей и хорошие отзывы. Каждый раз натыкаясь на неё в библиотеке, я твердила себе ""когда-нибудь, может быть"". И вот, это ""когда-нибудь"" наступило, и я осознала, как же сильно я недооценивала эту игру.

Вы оказываетесь на корабле посреди моря. Вы - призрак, маленький, едва теплящийся сгусток энергии, такой слабый и растерянный. ""Кто я? Как меня зовут? Сколько мне лет? Что произошло? Меня убили? И если да, то кто?"" - именно эти вопросы и удерживают вас в мире живых. Времени на разгадку так мало, а подозреваемых так много...

Кстати о подозреваемых. На борту корабля ""Douce Amere"" ни много, ни мало -10 человек: персонал и простые пассажиры. Поначалу персонажи кажутся картонными и сухими: тут вам и добродушный дедуля, и заводила-диджей, и молчаливая красавица, и адвокат в депрессии... Однако, чем дальше мы углубляемся в сюжет, тем больше понимаем: это не ""клише-персонажи"", и у каждого есть свои скелеты в шкафу. 

Открыто взаимодействовать с героями мы не можем (оно и понятно - мы же привидение). Нам под силу лишь читать мысли и вселяться в персонажей, чтобы говорить от их имени. Чем лучше мы узнаём персонажа - его прошлое, пристрастия, характер - тем больше вопросов мы можем задать. Звучит сухо, но на деле это очень занятная механика: все пассажиры взаимодействуют друг с другом по-разному, и если один от вас отмахнётся, то другой с радостью выложит всё, что знает. За это я и люблю видеоигры - они предоставляют новые способы повествования.

Собственно, к этому и сводится вся игра: к диалогам. Мы выслушиваем героев, пытаемся уловить в их словах правду, а иногда - даже помогаем им советом. К счастью, диалоги здесь прописаны отлично. Персонажам хочется верить,  им сопереживаешь, искренне смеёшься над их шутками. С момента моего прохождения прошли месяцы, а я всё ещё помню имена всех пассажиров.

Я мало в своей жизни читала детективов. Может, поэтому концовка игры стала для меня полной неожиданностью, хотя предпосылки, как оказалось, всё это время лежали на поверхности. В какой-то момент сюжет даёт крутой поворот, и все детали соединяются воедино. Концовок здесь 4, и, по традиции, есть ""хорошие"" и есть ""плохие"". Всё зависит от того, как тщательно вы расспрашивали пассажиров на протяжении круиза.

В общем и целом, я рекомендую вам попробовать ""Why Am I Dead At Sea"". Заварите чай, устройтесь поудобнее и отправляйтесь в плавание: ""Douce Amere"" уже ждёт вас у причала.",1515958547,1515958547,True,18,0,0.717677533626556396,6,True,False,False,False,,,

Такие вопросы приходится задавать себе безымянному, бесформенному сгустку эктоплазмы, который движется в неизвестном направлении на борту убогого круизного судна. Удачно подвернувшийся мальчик-экстрасенс объясняет, что совсем недавно здесь произошло убийство. Наше убийство. И есть основания полагать, что это только начало. Десяток потенциальных жертв заперты вместе с хладнокровным преступником на утлой, ржавой посудине посреди морской пустыни. Им некуда бежать. А нам нечего больше делать, кроме как пытаться им помочь. 

Странное дело, но “призрачный детектив” – это почти устоявшийся жанр. Возможно, таким образом легче побудить игрока к действию. Чужое убийство – личное дело потерпевшего. Если же прикончили тебя самого, волей-неволей приходится закатывать рукава. Но разработчиков, скорее всего, привлекают экстравагантные методы, которые могут себе позволить паранормальные сыщики.

Вот и на сей раз мы не ползаем на коленках в поисках доказательств. Вместо этого мы контролируем персонажа, контролирующего других персонажей. Вселяемся в людей и заставляем их самих искать против себя улики. Если подозреваемый что-то скрывает, надо стать этим подозреваемым, отпереть его каюту, накопать компромат, а потом предъявить ему находки, вселившись в другого бедолагу.

Круизное корыто “Douce Amere” укомплектовано жестокими, эгоистичными, глупыми, а порой и откровенно жалкими персонажами. Детективный сюжет любит снова и снова подрывать нашу веру в людей. Однако, герои вызывают не только презрение или негодование, но и сочувствие. У старых грехов длинные тени, а от человеческой натуры ничего хорошего ждать не приходится. Но у всех внутри с переменным успехом идет борьба света и темноты.

Здешняя растровая графика не блещет яркими красками и эффектами. Она, напротив, аутентично воспроизводит атмосферу подержанности, бедности и безвкусицы. Корабль кажется достаточно старым, чтобы иметь два-три потайных хода между переборками. Достаточно дешевым, чтобы привлекать публику худшего пошиба. И достаточно гнилым, чтобы с первого взгляда вызывать самые острые подозрения. 

Тон повествования традиционен для бульварного детектива. Сухой сардонический юмор обрамляет тяжелую, мрачную историю. Пассажиры и члены экипажа не прочь пофилософствовать о природе добра и зла, преступления и наказания, жизни и смерти. Впрочем, без нравоучений и фанатизма. Личные трагедии не расставлены по кораблю отдельными экспонатами. Они так или иначе вливаются в общую канву. Все лгут. Все боятся. Все преследуют свои интересы. Поэтому мертвому следователю приходится работать на пол ставки психологом.
 
Праздная болтовня – дело грешное, но именно в ней скрыт ключ к правде. Да и ложь может рассказать не меньше, если вы умеете слушать. По сути, вся игра – один большой, завуалированный допрос. И чтобы не задавить нас лавиной информации, сюжет делится на условные главы, у которых есть только один диалоговый вход и выход. Таким образом свобода действий уживается с линейностью. 

Первая глава полна детского энтузиазма и такого же наивного неведения. Игрока наполняет ощущение вседозволенности. При этом нас невидимой рукой ведут по очень узкому сюжетному коридору, объясняя правила игры.
Вторая глава приносит понимание жестких ограничений и неизбежную фрустрацию, а так же детальное, въедливое изучае своего окружения и возможностей.
В третьей игра раскрывается во всей красе. Мы последовательно закрепляем свои успехи. Обстоятельства и причины преступления обретают очертания. Нас охватывает охотничий азарт… И, конечно, кончается все это внезапным и шокирующим поворотом, который разрушает ложное чувство контроля и безопасности. 

Оправившись от шока, мы начинаем складывать разрозненные детали в общую картину и, в конце концов, приходим к разгадке преступления. Или не приходим. Потому что “Почему я мертв посреди моря?” – это вопрос, на который никто за нас не будет давать ответ. И в этой автономности заключены как весомые достоинства, так и серьезные проблемы.

Скажем, один из персонажей стережет шкаф, который мы хотим обыскать. Мы вселяемся в этого персонажа, уводим в другую часть корабля, летим обратно, пытаемся открыть шкаф, но не можем этого сделать, потому что… в сценарии нет такого варианта. Подобные недоразумения убеждают игрока, что он гораздо умнее игры.

Но в итоге, когда все подозреваемые собираются в одной комнате и готовятся выслушать финальную разоблачительную речь, игра отыгрывается сполна, заставляя горе-детективов рвать на себе волосы. Представьте, что вы готовите блюдо по сложному рецепту. Каждый ингредиент должен быть заранее заготовлен и использован в точное время надлежащим образом. Одна ошибка, и блюдо безнадежно испорчено. Чтобы получить лучшую концовку, игрок должен найти абсолютно все улики, выпытать у пассажиров все тайны, а потом представить их в строгой последовательности, устами разных персонажей.

Но представите себе и другую ситуацию – вы пришли на экзамен, зазубрив ответы наизусть. Однако, экзаменатор хочет услышать от вас не только сам материал, но и его анализ. Эта игра доходчиво объясняет, что хороший детектив не просто копит факты, но активно с ними работает. Логика игры далеко не идеальна. Но автор всегда последователен в своих сюжетных и дизайнерских решениях.
 
“Почему я мертв посреди моря?” – это закономерный, интригующий вопрос. Много раз на протяжении игры я прокручивал у себя в голове имена персонажей, сравнивал их истории, пытался уличить каждого во лжи. А в самом конце, когда ответы на все вопросы уже давно лежали под самым моим носом, до меня наконец дошло, кто же все-таки меня прикончил. Ради подобных озарений стоит читать детективы. И играть в них тоже.

It's basically a murder/mystery RPG with a great story told in an inventive way that let's you gradually piece together the plot in layers as well as from various perspectives. The way it's implemented embellishes an already well-written story and keeps your attention the entire time. 

You wake up as a ghost without any knowledge of yourself, and need to figure out who you are as well as who on the cruise ship murdered you. You work towards these goals by possessing the suspects (crew and passengers) to take control over their bodies and investigate them. While possessing someone, you open up new dialog possibilties with other characters - and also gain a special skill that's unique to each character such as being able to peek in door keyholes or read people's emotional state. You can only possess people after learning personal/private details about them so you need to find ways to accomplish that during the investigation since it's critical to progressing the story. There's also two different levels of possession which makes things even more interesting by adding another dimension to the concept. Between the dialog choices from all possessed suspects' story threads and special skills, you come to understand/experience the plot in additive layers of detail from different perspectives. I really enjoyed playing multiple storylines and watching how they weave together while collectively manipulating the suspects through  forced interaction with possession. It comes together seamlessly as such a unique experience.

I can't believe this game is only $5. I played through it in about 7 hours or so and there's still a few more endings to see. I really enjoyed the graphics and the music was awesome too. Overall the entire game felt well polished in every way.

I did not expect that.
This might be one of the best indie games I have ever played.
In this game, you are a ghost trying to piece together your own murder case.
You do so by taking over the passengers and talking to each other.
Getting a whim of their personalities allows you to follow them around (you control their movement, but you can't relay information that you know through them).
After getting to know them intimately, you can finally possess them and speak through their mouths, relaying that information that you've pieced together through other characters and exploring the ship.
This game throws a lot of twists into the story. Some bigger, some smaller.
Some fairly predictable.
It keeps you interested throughout. It's a game that you can't really put down until you finish it.
Something that I really enjoyed was the Mindreading mechanic.
It doesn't really advance the plot (which is sad, cause that would've been kinda cool), but god is it aesthetic. 
The cat one is probably my favourite.
This game features multiple endings based on the evidence that you collect throughout your journey.
I recommend not looking at guides on how to get them until you finished the game once (don't worry, you can't really miss evidence until the very end. If you save, you can collect the rest of it before entering the finale).
Sometimes it can get kind of frustrating, in which case, look at a guide or keep trying.
The soundtrack is very memorable since its mostly tied to the characters. This gives every track a personal feel to it and it also helps giving life to the characters themselves. The melodies reflect their personalities.
The graphics have a very earthbound feel to them. They're fantastic for a pixel-art game.
The longer you play, the more do you get a feel for the ship, It's rooms, the character's usual hideouts.
One gripe I have with this game is that every character has his/her own special ability.
They really do range from kinda-, no - sorta-, nah, maybe important? to completely useless. 
For example, one character's ability is to see what other people have in their pockets.
Yeah. It's never used.
It's kinda sad actually. It could've been used for some cool evidence collecting.
Like, what if you look into someone's pocket and you find the protagonist's handkerchief in there?
Then you could point it out and they'd get all nervous, which could then later be used as evidence.
That's just an example. Not sure how you make the ""take pills which make you run faster but also muddle up the screen"" ability useful in collecting evidence. It just feels like a tacked on feature, which is sad. It could've been a pretty cool mechanic to be honest.
I've encountered one bug where Donnovan wouldn't meet me in his room and I'd be locked out. If that happens to you, just talk to him again and wait until he goes back to his room.
Now I'll get into spoilers, DON'T GO PAST HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GAME.
THE GAME IS FAIRLY CHEAP AND QUITE AN AMAZING JOURNEY.
SERIOUSLY, BUY IT.
PLAY IT.
PAST HERE IS NO-NO ZONE.




okay? good.

[spoiler] Some of the story twists really hit me. It really goes to show how indie devs write better stories than AAA companies with their millions of dollars. For once, I was really surprised to find out that the main character is female. I thought that that was a really neat twist. Adding that with her not only being the captain, but also a secret agent, she's a way more interesting character than I originally anticipated. I also like how every character tells you their own opinions on the captain. Again, it adds so much personality to these characters. They could've just as easily have every character say that she was really kind. The Donnovan twist was predictable as hell. I saw that coming from a mile away. That being said, he's used in a very interesting and cool way. When I took over Donnovan and that bloodpumping music started playing in the background, I grinned. You just feel so frickin' badass. And just as the Game Devs give you the Lollipop, they take it away and spit in your face. Before, I just thought that Donnovan was some kind of edgelord or really wanted revenge against the killer. But just those few moments you have with him, walking around with that music playing, knowing that he's an undercover cop, I immediately grew to love him. And then he dies (not really, but yaknow, I didn't know). I actually felt shocked and saddened. The Smilla/Donnovan Partners in Crime thing made that even worse. I'm amazed at how quickly they made me love a character who had zero appeal until then. Another thing that they could've improved is the showdown. Ferdinand just stands there and laughs while saying kinda predictable ""Nyeh-eh I am the bad guy Muah-ha-ha"" things. Also, Garv trying to pretend as if he's innocent and not really snapping out of it at any point until he tries to bribe a man who clearly has no need for money is EHHHHH. Also, they just kinda stand there and wait to get shot. Maybe one of them couldve taken a hostage or something. It may seem like I'm complaining a lot here, but I just intend to review games fairly. This game really touched me, it made me laugh, it made me hate (HOW DARE YOU DO THAT TO PAULO), It shocked me, surprised me and overall, I've had a great time with it.[/spoiler]

Dadurch ist der Spielraum natürlich begrenzt wie ein klassisches Kammerspiel, hat aber natürlich den Vorteil, dass man sich nach relativ kurzer Zeit sehr gut zurecht findet. Nach und nach lernen wir die Passagiere und Besatzungsmitglieder kennen und können sie mehr oder weniger manipulieren, um zu verstehen, was an Bord vor sich geht. (Jede der manipulierten Personen hat außerdem eine besondere Fähigkeit, die uns mehr oder weniger nutzen kann.) Irgendwas scheint hier nicht mit rechten Dingen zuzugehen. Wer sind wir eigentlich? Wer ist der Geist im Klo? Und wo zur Hölle ist eigentlich der Kapitän dieses Schiffes? Mit der Zeit habe ich das Spiel als sehr intensiv empfunden und habe über die Retrografik gar nicht mehr nachgedacht.

However, these were core elements for good reason, and the changes cause problems that are uncommon and jarring for the genre. But whatever the verdict, it's a unique ride all the way. 

The main draw to Why Am I Dead At Sea is its story. Without spoiling it, the basic premise is that the protagonist is a ghost (assumedly recently dead) trying to sort out, well, why it's dead at sea. This transforms the narrative into a murder mystery with a twist, as you can posses and manipulate the various characters during their own investigations. I personally love this mechanic. Instead of using a pointer, you'll control the ghost with a controller or in my case the keyboard. This makes the game significantly more interesting, since each character has a different ability, so once you unlock a new character you'll be able to explore the ship more efficiently (at least in most cases). Overall, this mechanic is the best part of the game. It makes playing the game more interesting than clicking and scrolling through text, it works well with the setting and tone of the game, and it combines some of the better parts of a first person and omniscent perspective without any narrative hiccups.

Speaking of the narrative, it does it's job well for a story rich game. The game is paced well, and has a great climax that will lead to one of the multiple endings. As far as the actual writing goes, you can learn a lot (I'd say a little too much) about characters and the mystery simply by reading the dialogue (which takes up most of the game). The characters are diverse, likable, and relatable, and the dialogue is well written. There are also a few missables that answer some questions that the main story never does.  And to top it all off, most of the characters' simple designs work with the visual style without seeming too basic. After all of this, it sounds like a perfect game, but unfortunately this isn't the case. 

My first problem in the game is that many of the mechanics are buggy. It's surprisingly easy to get stuck on a single pixel or clip through a wall, and since the game has manual saving, this can lead to loss of progress. I'd advise avoiding walls when you can ([spoiler]and not abusing the cats jumping ability[/spoiler]). To be fair, I only experienced issues twice in my two full playthroughs, but as both instances led to lost progress, I resent both of them.  

Secondly the narrative progression has some small issues due to the game mechanics. In most adventure games you'll expect a certain ammount of trial and error, but this game makes it much worse. Because each character is different, certain actions will only cause progression if done with a specific character. There is a speech bubble that will appear over a characters head when they have something to say to whoever you're controlling, but because you can only control characters one at a time (and the NPCs won't stay put while unpossesed), you may have to check each character, with every other character multiple times in order to progress. There is one chapter in which you must talk to one character with three different characters in order to progress to the next chapter. For this reason, I found myself possessing characters en masse and trapping them all in the observation room so I could check for new dialogue without having to walk back and forth between rooms. And what I discovered by using this strategy during my second playthrough was easily the most disappointing part of the game.

Now, the following contains pretty blunt spoilers. It does not contain any details that would spoil the plot, but this information will likely ruin the climax and any multiple playthroughs for you. In my case, ignorance was bliss, so I'd recommend skipping this part if you haven't played the game yet. However if you do intend to 100% the game, the following information is important.   [spoiler]Simply put, the different endings, aren't. There are two good endings, two bad endings, and the best ending. The good endings are nigh identical, the bad endings [b]are[/b] identical, and the best ending seems like a watered down combination of the good endings. Every ending answers all of the main games questions, so the only thing different about an ending will be parts of its dialogue. Furthermore, only the actions you take in the penultimate chapter affect the ending, although the game seems less linear than it actually is. With a guide (and no spoiler guides do exist) it is possible to play the game up to a point in the next to last chapter, save, and experience every ending from there by slightly altering your actions (which is how my second playthrough went). The multiple endings are easily the worst part of the game, as they encourage multiple playthroughs in a game that's best on the first play. The only rewards for reading through the same dialogue multiple times (i.e, 100% completion) are the achievements.[/spoiler] 

If you've made it to the end of this review, I'd simply like to specify that I do think Why Am I Dead At Sea is a good game. If you like this kind of game you'll definitely enjoy it, and if you don't it will likely change your mind. But in my case, I feel like I went in too deep (again) and ruined what was a fun experience for me by overthinking and overplaying it. If you're just looking for something new to play, I'd say go for it.

I enjoyed possessing people and searching the ship, trying to find new info that would help move the narrative along, but if you're not into a lot of walking and talking that might get old quick. There are a lot of secrets in this game however, many of which are tied to the original flash game Why Am I Dead (which isn't necessary to play before this game), and I liked searching the ship for all of the achievements.
 
My only warnings about this game besides what I mentioned above would be some of the themes and potential glitches in this game.

Most of the time they've got little good pieces but are overall pretty bad. But every now and again, I find a real gem hidden in all that dross, and this was one of them. Low production value, a number of minor non-gamebreaking bugs, but superb mystery and characters. Honestly, I found that this game captured all the things I liked about the Nonary Games (albeit in a different format and without escape sequences.)

The game takes the form of an overhead RPGmaker style game (without combat), like corpse-party or mad-father. You play as a ghost who can possess characters to some degree and read minds, but not work outside the context of that character's norm. A few characters have special abilities (technically they all do, but most of them are abilities like 'i change the background music' or 'I made amusing and silly flavor-text announcements over the PA' or 'I take a pill to walk faster'). So that means most of the game is instigating conversations between different people, although there are a few ""figure out how to get the key"" moments. In any case, swapping characters is a great mechanism for allowing you to investigate the story from different angles. As you get to know certain characters better, you get higher degrees of control over them, and so in some situations you need to learn more about each character to advance the plot. 

There is a hint system as well, although it was disabled at the end of the game when I really needed it. It offers both vague suggestions that give you a rough idea of where to look, but you can press for more specific ones. I did the specific one once, and the result was almost as explicit as a walkthrough ""try taking this character and talking to this other character to open up more dialog options, then return with a different character and they'll react differently."" I liked that because it ensured you never got really stuck, but again, it is disabled at the end and I ended up getting stuck once, although I did feel like the specific ones were a bit too easy.

This game is a murder mystery, and an excellent one at that. Multiple people are working in different directions, without knowing the entire story. Everyone has their secrets, and almost noone is who they initially appear to be. It creates a complex and intricate situation to unravel. The game does an excellent job of dropping just the right hints and the right pieces to keep things interesting without giving away too much. 

The ending takes place with a big confrontation between all the characters, a little like you'd expect from an Agatha Christie novel. Except instead of a detective putting together all the pieces of the mystery, that role falls to the player. So you take control of each character to get them to reveal their piece of the puzzle, and try to reveal the whole mystery. I'll admit, I missed a few pieces the first time, so the game ended with parts of the mystery unsolved. I'm not sure how many endings there are, but apparently there's more than one. I need to go through a second time to see if I can figure out the rest of it. 

The character development is one of the best things about this game. There are numerous characters, all with their own backstory and motives. Some are innocent. Some, not so much. Everyone's hiding something though, and as you sort through the evidence you come to understand the characters and get attached to them in their own way. Their interactions are complex and dynamic. Manipulative and dishonest at times as well (at least if I didn't misinterpret any pieces of the mystery)

There are lots of problems with the game too. The character sprites are good, but everything else is kind of bland. The music is simplistic and obnoxious, and I ended up turning off the sound about a half hour after I started the game each time. The characters were said to each have special abilities, but I'd say maybe half at least of them were useless. Also, the story can get caught at times, and your only way to continue is cycle through each of the characters and they've all talked to each other and exhausted all dialog options, which is a pain. The scenery never changes either. There's maybe two dozen rooms, most of which are tiny, and they get kinda old by the end. 

Also there are alot of bugs... nothing game-breaking, but just annoyance kind of stuff. The biggest one I saw was when you tried to enter a room, but another character was blocking the door in the other room. You'd enter and get pushed back out, or end up inside a wall. Also, sometimes you'd click on a door and it wouldn't react at all. Normally you'd get a ""door's locked"" or ""I shouldn't go in"" message, but sometimes you got nothing. There was an ability for the ghost to scan who he could control, and it lagged horribly whenever I used it. Also the game wanted to restart every time I exited it, so I could only close it by rapidly jamming alt-f4. Nothing gamebreaking, but obnoxious. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this game. If you like mysteries with strong characters anyway. It's got alot of little bad things, but the overall game is so great. The game took me about 7 hours on my first playthough, although may have left it idling a few times while I got dinner ready, and I'm not sure how much that inflated it. Still, it's much more length than I usually get out of a cheap game like this. The characters and mystery were masterfully executed.

I will certainly keep an eye on this developer. If they can produce more stories with such great characters and plotlines, especially if they can add a little more polish, we might be looking at some real masterpieces in the future.",1495061607,1495061607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The name, honestly is pretty dull and the art is barebones but what makes up for all of this is an excellent murder mystery wrapped up in flawed and interesting characters.

One of my favorite choices design-wise is a character named Paulo. He's completely isolated from all the action and therefore I never felt pressure when talking to him. Paulo gives a little backstory but what I especially loved what that he exists as essentially an in-game walkthrough. Paulo will rarely give straight answers, but he will point you to what characters/ areas of the game you need to focus on to complete the story. He's a great crutch for players (like me), who frequently struggle to solve these types of games but he doesn't take the fun out of solving the mystery. He does what Contradiction's chief tried to do, but he fills his role much better because of how we are introduced to Lewis. Such a simple character that gives the player a lot of leeway in how they want to approach the game!

Another thing i liked: i got the feeling the game had a lot of respect for the player. There's a point in chapter two where one of the main riddles of the game could have been solved with context clues in the dialog, but the answer is never spoken out loud until chapter three. However, at the end of chapter two the game gives dialog options to the player as if the mystery had already been revealed. This showed me the game had faith that the player was working the mystery on their own and didn't need obvious plot points to be outlined to them.

Noteworthy: The game gets dark, but it's not really edgy like a lot of games are now. This is a personal thing, but I hate games that try to be edgy, pushing things sexual harassment and gruesome murders in the gameplay and forcing the player to watch. Not that the game strays from those topics, but i appreciated the tact shown when handling sensitive subjects. 

There are a ton of choices in the game, but never does the player have an actual impact on the story. While you can approach the story in a nonlinear fashion by following different leads and characters, the narrative is ultimately linear and events happen in a fixed sequence. I appreciate this, because it meant for things like dialog are almost always repeatable. This is a very pleasant change for someone whose always worried about missing an option, even if it's a little disorientating when you give conflicting answers to one question.

Now with all that said, I did have several issues (mostly technical) that would have made me quit the average title. These include:
-having to completely restart my game because the first mate got stuck inside an invisible wall. Easily the biggest issue
-Almost all the controls for gameplay are with keyboard, but in the audio menu you can only escape using the mouse?
-the name, while descriptive, is pretty dull. If it wasn't on sale I’d never look into this game.
-unskippable cutscenes
-there is no auto-eject out of conversations. Honestly this one is super nitpicky, but i hate accidently starting conversations and having to mash through 4 textboxes
+-to that point there is also no button to progress a conversation other than 'k,' or whatever you remap it to. This means if you mash 'k' too fast you can accidently conversation you might accidently start it again. Having another button to progress the conversation that doesn't start a new one would be nice.
-sometimes crewmen back block doors. I see no reason why collision with other passengers is needed, especially with this sort of drawback
-The ending feels really messy. SPOILERS: The best ending comes out in a clever and logical way, but it's attachment to 4 other endings makes it an extremely painful trial and error bonanza (if you don't give up and grab the walkthrough like i did). Moreover, the entire game is designed so that you can also go back and redo events, and nothing you can do is permanent. Having major elements of the story locked away behind optional activities at the very end feels cheap as hell, mostly because it only happens once in the entire game. Considering the games linearity up the that point, it might have made more sense to have only one or two endings. 

All that icky stuff aside, love the game and will definitely be looking for other stuff the dev has made :D

You do this by posessing the passangers and crewmembers, lightly setting them into the good direction but they are making their reactions based on their personality.  It sounds cliché, but everyone hides something, be it a huge, dark secret, a tragic backstory or just a side of their personality they don't like to face. 
The game operates wonderfully - for example the first creature you can posess is a cat, and every single person's reaction is reflecting their personality, as they react to the cat. Each person has a theme music that fits their personality. You'll have access later to a feature that visualize their personality, and that's also incredibly aligned with their reactions, personality and music, or even with just the walking speed of theirs.

It's a bit on the shorter side, but the multiple endings, engrossing story, and rich details make it worth at least one replay. 

This isn't the only game where you play a murder victim back from the dead (with Ghost Trick being another great example), but Why Am I Dead At Sea executes the concept masterfully. The mechanics change as the player gains a better understanding of their former identity and the people around them, tying together narrative and gameplay in a way that feels satisfying and natural. All the characters have multiple layers, and their interactions are realistic and well-written. Also, I loved the way the human mind was handled. Reading someone's mind displays some abstract visuals that give you a glimpse of their general attitude, with snippets of text floating by as their surface thoughts. It's not a huge deal, but it does a great job of making the mind feel dynamic and real. Much more creative than just having a line or two of inner monologue. Also, interaction between characters is well-written and engaging, even in cutscenes when the player isn't at the wheel. For the most part, the things a posessed character is willing to say will tell you as much as the answer you get in return. Also, even within the same ending, characters will act a bit differently depending on what you made them say earlier in the game. Otherwise, the story is mostly linear before a certain point, although some things don't need to be done in a certain order. This gives the player a nice sense of flexibility.

There were a couple of issues I had, though. First of all, the last stretch of the game is a bit difficult to navigate. The pacing of the story doesn't suffer much, but there's a relative lack of guidance and some of the things you need to do are accomplished in an unintuitive way. Throughout the game, it can be difficult to figure out what to do, but this issue becomes more pronounced as the game goes on. A more astute player might have less trouble juggling all the information they have, but sometimes it's hard to tell which character needs to talk to who, especially near the end. Also, while the endings are mostly satisfying, I felt like a couple of characters could use a little more focus, or at least acknowledgement. Those issues, in my opinion, are still far outweighed by the strength of the characters and the excitement of unraveling the story.

In conclusion, Why Am I Dead At Sea is a thrilling experience, packed to the brim with complex characters and unique mechanics. An excellent mystery and a great game.",1491458102,1491458102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Neutral:
- The majority of the game is the conversational aspect.  There are very few puzzles, and what puzzles there are are pretty simple.

Cons:
- A game-breaking bug where characters can get stuck in place and unable to move, requiring you to edit the save file to continue.   You're advised to keep multiple saves.
- The plot runs on a script, regardless of your choices.  If you figure something out before you're supposed to, you can't do anything about it until the plot catches up.  Towards the end, you may know exactly what you need to do, but get stymied because you can't figure out the series of actions the game is expecting to advance the plot.
- The game begins to fall apart, mechanically, towards the end.  Actions that were able to be done earlier in the game cannot be repeated even though there's been no change, some actions (like attempting to open a locked door) no longer give any feedback at all, etc.
- Sometimes keystrokes are dropped, especially during conversations.  This is doubly annoying because you don't want to accidentally overpress the key either, or you'll inadvertently skip things.

As far as negatives go, there are some minor gameplay gripes. Players constantly going back to specific places when you're done possessing them, as well as certain characters walking really slowly, can get a little annoying, but it's in service to the plot and character development, and that is the main focus of the game, anyway. 

There's also the complaint that the gameplay really boils down to talking to random people as random people, but I'd beg to differ. I can't speak for everyone (and obviously I don't), but in my personal playthrough, I very rarely felt like I was just randomly guessing at what to do. Very few games provide, and reward players for following, clues as successfully as this game, and if you feel like you're fresh out of leads, you can always talk to Paulo. The few times I did come to a conclusion through random guessing, my reaction was kinda, ""Oh, I should've figured,"" as the clues are always there. Except, that is, in the Fourth Chapter. THAT is the point where I think this criticism is valid, as the game hits a bit of a lul, not only because of the absence of Paulo, but also because it takes a long time before a visual change in the ship, which kinda makes you wonder when a major change in the story is gonna come, as well as making the gameplay feel a little monotonous. Without spoiling too much, though, this lul doesn't last for long.

Why Am I Dead At Sea konnte mich von Anfang bis Ende fesseln, und das obwohl die zahlreichen Probleme im Bereich Steuerung fleißig versucht haben mir den Spaß zu verderben. Miese Vorkonfiguration der Tastenbelegung, kein Controller-Support, mangelhafte Kollisionsabfrage zwischen einigen Spielfiguren und Umgebungsobjekten … Das hätte alles nicht sein müssen. Doch die packende Handlung rund um menschliche Seelenqualen und Abgründe zwingt einen förmlich dazu weiterzuspielen und wenigstens ein paar der insgesamt vier Endings freizuspielen. Unterstützt wird man dafür von einem tollen, abwechslungsreichen Soundtrack und netter Retro-Grafik im Earthbound-Stil. Außerdem ist es einfach ein cooles Konzept als Geist von Menschen Besitz zu ergreifen, um auf diese Weise einen verzwickten Fall zu lösen.;)


Pro und Kontra:

Pro:
- spannendes, wenn auch nicht wirklich neues Grundkonzept (ein Geist als Detektiv)
- packendes Mystery-Krimi-Drama mit erwachsenen Themen
- abwechslungsreiche Charaktere mit Geheimnissen und Tiefgang
- toller Soundtrack
- bietet mehrere Auflösungsstufen
- gewohnt simple Steuerung, aber …

Neutral:
- charmante Grafik im Stil des JRPG-Klassikers Earthbound, passt jedoch nicht unbedingt gut zur düsteren Handlung
- solide Spielzeit von ca. 6 Stunden (ist für 4,99 € in Ordnung)
- ist kein klassisches Adventure, das Spiel besteht fast ausschließlich auf Dialogführung

Kontra:
- … die Steuerung ist schlecht vorkonfiguriert und bietet keinen Controller-Support
- einige Spielfiguren verhaken immer wieder mal mit Umgebungsobjekten
- die vollständige Übernahme eines Wirts ist unnötig kompliziert und umständlich

I say ""story"" rather than ""game"" because I think there's this notion going around that a video game has to have gameplay. This doesn't. You interact with the world and the characters through a set of mechanics, but it's more a storytelling device than a game.

There were things I didn't like. The supernatural angle didn't end up being particularly relevant. It only provided a way within the context of the story for the player to interact with the world. I'd have like to see it taken further. There are a couple of optional scenes in which the player character uses their ghostly powers to help a character conquer their personal demons from within. I wanted to see more of that, but then the game ended.

If you've played Capcom's [i]Ghost Trick[/i] - and you should - I'd compare this game to it as shorter, less interesting, with a less satisfying ending. But it is more grounded, which can be seen as a good thing, depending on whether you think the supernatural element clashes or not.

I thank Steam Community for the recommendation. For a low low price, what could possibly go wrong? Approximately 6 hours for one playthrough, and did i mention this game has multiple endings? No? Ok, now you know.

Nice graphics, amazing mechanics (I must admit, its very unique.), great characters personalities and interactions, and a well written mystery game. Peltast Software, please make another game, i will surely buy it! To finish this review, discounted or not, you need to experience this unique gem.

Как думаете, сколько людей ежегодно умирают в море? Это покажется невероятным, но по исследованиям около 372.000 человек. ""Вот это да"", - скажете вы и представите в голове всех этих людей, тонущих одновременно. Не самая радужная смерть, конечно.
Так вот. В данной игре мы играем за призрака, в прошлом он был... кое-кем, кто тоже умер в море. Но вот как он умер? Утонул? Повесился у себя в каюте? Поскользнулся на верхней палубе и упал за борт прямиком в пасть акулы? Кто знает... Хотя, по первым мелькающим кадрам, становится понятно, что это[spoiler] убийство.[/spoiler]Вот и думай теперь, как ты умер, да почему. Вот таким недостатком информации игра потчует нас с самых первых минут. Мы играем за призрака, который находится на корабле. Ему необходимо расследовать причину своей смерти, а также попутно узнать информацию о себе и о прочих пассажирах корабля. Ведь не просто же так мы вернулись в этот мир.

Выглядит игра в изометрическом стиле, с очень уютной, прямо ""по-домашнему"" симпатичной пиксельной графикой. Да, это инди-проект, но любители ААА, не спешите с выводами. Музыка в принципе неплохая, пара-тройка треков даже может остаться у вас в голове, чтобы когда-нибудь вы вернулись к этой игре. В звуках нет ничего особенного. ""Пиканье"" в стиле 90-х для ""озвучивания"" речи и набор не самых выдающихся звуков (но это не значит, что они плохи). 

На корабле у нас числится 11 человек (включая нас), кошка и... а это уже найдите в самой игре. Очень хотелось бы написать о каждом более подробно, но это тот самый случай, когда интересно всё узнавать самому. Скажу только, что каждый персонаж яркий и колоритный, со своим характером, очень запоминающийся, со своими тайнами. У игрока нет ни капли информации и он черпает её по крупинке. Но, кое-что для разогрева интриги знать всё-таки нужно: призрак имеет определённые способности. Вселяться в людей, управлять ими, читать их мысли. Подобное было в громком проекте от Square Enix - Murdered: Soul Suspect. Но здесь это всё в целом выполнено НА ПОРЯДОК лучше, поверьте моему честному объективному слову. Правда, приходится чем-то жертвовать, и игра проходится буквально за 4-5 часов. Но это даже не минус! 

В целом, это инди-жемчужина, но, к сожалению, малоизвестная. Как видно по оценкам Steam, у неё исключительно положительные отзывы. Несколько отрицательных связаны с какой-то технической проблемой, а не историей игры. Но игра была обновлена после тех обзоров и теперь она ещё стабильнее. Осмелюсь сказать, что по крутости она может потягаться с самой To the moon, вот только Мэдисон её не обозревал. Только другого жанра, это следует учитывать, чтобы меня потом просто так не закидали тапочками. 

Кто знает, с чем вам предстоит столкнуться, пока вы идёте к истине, силясь понять почему вы умерли в море...

I'm very critical when it comes to this type of indie game, but the writing in this one is actually very good. Perhaps most importantly for me, the dialogue writing feels fresh and interesting. The story keeps your curiosity piqued, and your brain working on figuring out the mystery. It's good stuff.

It gets off to a really good start that's almost immediately very engaging and dramatic (in no small part due to the soundtrack), and its characters feel surprisingly nuanced.

You get access to various unusual abilities that you can use while exploring or during conversations, and it meshes really well with the story (even if some are more useful than others. But I don't really see that as a flaw.)

Lots of things about this game work really well, but it does have a few pretty significant problems:

[b]Technical Issues[/b]
I've had to restart the game multiple times before I was able to finish it due to various technical problems, the most common of which is that some characters will get stuck before they reach their destination, and can never get unstuck.
Another odd issue i got was that the game's save files seemingly deleted themselves overnight.

[b]Design Flaws[/b]
It's very easy to get stuck not knowing what flag you haven't tripped so you can move on to the next thing. But the game dialogue is also oddly structured, which hurts the game's pacing.

Often, you seemingly need to ""talk to everyone about everything"", but the dialogue trees are oddly designed in that choices don't ""stick"". You can say every possible choice by just repeating a certain dialogue tree path.

If you haven't exhausted all your dialogue with a character, there's a ""..."" icon, but it doesn't go away before you've made every possible choice.
So the problem is the character you're controlling has to be a total weirdo who starts multiple identical conversations about the same topic by saying the exact same thing at first, and then ends it by, for example, stating wildly different opinions each time, say, 4 or 5 times, to the same character. This doesn't make sense in the narrative of the game, and stands out especially because the game is well written.

It seems to me that the game is signalling that exhausting all of these dialogue options and thus removing the ""..."" icon from every character is required to progress - but I'm honestly not sure how that really works. It's entirely unclear as you're playing, and becomes especially apparent if you (like me) end up playing the game multiple times.


[b]In conclusion[/b]
Skill and effort went into crafting this story, and I recommend this game to people who enjoy a good mystery.

If you can find a way to back-up your save files, then you might want to do that in case a character gets stuck, or the saves decide to disappear like mine. Or just beat it in one sitting.

I found it quite enjoyable despite having seen perhaps the worst of its flaws.",1477357130,1477357261,True,3,0,0.561799108982086182,1,True,False,False,False,,,

A great concept, excellent execution, fun world design that rewards exploration with insight, just a wonderful and memorable gaming experience.

I am so into these games that offer unique modes of storytelling, I mean, it's a brilliant solution to a concept I've always hated in games: dead-eyed, slack-jawed NPCs who sit around waiting for you to do every little thing. You're ostensibly playing one entity, but really this game has more in common with ""split the party"" type horror games like [i]Siren[/i] or [i]Corpse Party[/i] where you play different people caught in the vortex of one event, each with their own fully realized personalities and desires. The care that has been put into constructing the characters is really what makes the game so great. Each character has unique music that plays when possessing them, a unique mindscape that can be peeked into, a unique placement in the societal incubator that is the setting, and each has different methods of talking to the other characters and dealing with the world they're situated in. In order to possess them, the game asks that you understand them, and thus witness them through the eyes of the people around them and then ultimately through their own. 

What results is a game that feels very empathic, very alive, where both the player and the characters seem to have so much agency towards pushing the story forward and solving the mystery. This ties into the existential crises of nearly all the characters, which range from poverty to surviving the suicide of a loved one to facing their own imminent deaths, the game offers several discussions on time and moving forward, overcoming traumas and spending whatever time you are given meaningfully and not just keeping your head down and doing the bare minimum to achieve comfort.

And the mystery is good! And more importantly, it's something you can figure out with the clues you're given even before you get to the final judgement, though how to organize those clues into evidence is harder than it initially seems.

As the title implies, this game's universe revolves around a journey at sea on what seems to be a particularly small cruise ship.

You - as the player - are handed control over a spirit. And that spirit is an energetic remnant of what was once a human being, who unfortunately died under strange circumstances.

The fun thing about controlling this spirit, is the ability to float through doors. And that inevitably means you get to take peeks behind closed doors... in spaces that hold secrets.

Yes... secrets. We're here to uncover secrets. One obvious secret revolving around the protagonist's demise.

But there's more... mhmm, a couple of subplots that tie in beautifully with the main plot.

So, on this ship there's a lot of moving from one cabin to another on different floors (which unfortunately has the process feeling repetitive and even dreadful at some point, but because the story takes place on a tiny cruise ship; it's kind of fun and doable, thanks to speedy movement of the spirit).

This spirit has no memory of what happened, where, when or how it occurred (which is very distressing & confusing to this little residual ball of energy), but of course we are here to do something about that, ey!

And the way this is done, is by first being informed of the spirit's death, thru a very young passenger on board (i.e. Paulo) who is capable of tapping into the paranormal (and thus, communicating with spirits).

His guidance jumpstarts the exploration process and makes it easier to grasp what's going on and what to do.

He explains the process of possession/mind control, and encourages you to test the process on a cat which happens to be in his cabine at that time. 

Concerning possession; the game logic goes as following; the most insecure passengers of the whole lot are to be possessed first - which is simply figured out thru trial-and-error -  and via them you get to know the stronger minded folks (and thus possess them afterwards).

The more you know about someone, the easier it becomes to manipulate them (i.e. their insecurities weaken their aura so-to-speak, and allows for easier 'entry' in their body).

There is a basic possession mode & a full possession mode.

In order to unlock 'full possession' (which in this game, equals the unlocking of specific dialogue lines - which are required in order to progress and find out what really happened - one has to become acquainted fully with all passengers on board.

And this is where a lot of running is done, because you're required to possess each and every one of them to get answers, progress and finish the game.

The one thing that really stuck with me (after finishing up) was the music and the graphics. And heck, even the plot. 

The plot was nice. It was good enough and it made sense.

A really cool thing they did in this game is the ability to see inside the passengers minds. 

What you get to see is a graphical representation of what their mind looks like (this is done thru clever use of colour, music and specific phrases, which reflect their thoughts & demeanor).

This really adds to the atmosphere of the game. 

Each character has their own theme music (which plays when they're possessed + in their cabins) and this really helps grasping their personalities.

On top of this, when the characters converse, their personality is emphasized thru sound & pace (as the dialogue appears on screen). 

So even though, there's no voice acting present, it IS possible to 'feel' what the characters are like, because of the smart application of sound & tempo in regard to dialogue.

How this works is; as the words appear on screen, sound is played for every letter that pops up.

I thought that was really awesome. It made a difference. This is a feature I had come across before in games (especially of the RPG type), and it simply works well for this game.

Luckily, you can partially possess people and move them around the ship to uncover clues about your death. When you control a fellow seafarer, you not only get to abuse the relationships they have with other people on board, but you get access to a unique skill that can help you move around or talk.

-Some ideas were under-utilized (unique character actions, etc.)
-Characters at the beginning get neglected at the end
-Mediocre audio

I've seen this is a spiritual sequel, although I never played the first. The one real flaw in this game is that as you play it, something inside you knows it could be better. There's a lot of potential here, either in a completely re-polished version or just another sequel in the same vein. Still, I HAVE to recommend this. It's a fun way to tell a story and it shouldn't be passed up.

Like a lot of reviewers, I was immediately drawn to its Earthbound-style graphics, and expected a lighthearted indie romp through a ship. That compairson shatters within the first five minutes of gameplay, though. The 90's nostalgia and surreal charm of Earthbound are nowhwere to be found. Instead, you find yourself on a third-rate ship, among its cynical inhabitants. You've been murdered, and a telepathic boy named Pablo has pulled your soul back into the land of the living. He explains that in your current state, you can't open doors or speak to people, and must possess a living person to talk and search for clues.

And that's the basic premise of the game: possess people and puppeteer them into revealing conversations. The more conversations and clues you amass, the more leverage you have over the ship's occupants, and the more you understand about who you were and what's at stake. In general, it plays like a lot of early 90's point-and-click games, trying different dialogue combinations with different characters. Some might find that frustrating, but I honestly found it a highlight. I miss old games like that.  If you get too frustrated, though, Pablo offers hints throughout most of the game (usually two hints per section, a ""where should I go"" style hint, and a ""complete this part for me"" style one).  

Sadly, these hints fall away where they're needed most, in the fourth act of the game. Up until that point, there's a sort of internal logic that can point you in the right direction. By act four, though, your choices are too broad, and there's no rhyme or reason for the interaction combos you need to pick. After reading a walkthrough, I understood why the choices I made were necessary for the story, but still thought ""I never would've realized that I should possess this character and speak to this character after doing this not-very-obvious thing."" You lose sight of why characters are motivated to act the way they do, basically. 

That said, I still enjoyed the story quite a bit. It was a solid, unpredictable muder-mystery with a interesting game mechanic. The music never felt out of place, and a lot of thought given to the personality and backstory of each character, even down to how they speak to one person versus another. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone that wants to hear a good story, even if the last parts can be a bit frustrating.",1468021451,1468022051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I absolutely loved this game.  It was way better than I anticipated.  It was confusing at times, with me wandering around trying to figure out if I'd actually talked to everyone I needed to in order to progress.  I did use guides for a couple of the steps and three of the endings (because I'm not naturally very good at puzzles), but overall it wasn't too difficult or too easy.  The story was brilliant, as were the subplots, and kept me guessing for ages.  It's astonishing how much is really in this game and for such a good price.  It reminded me a little of Undertale without the fighting, by which I mean the many mysteries to uncover.  I had an enjoyable couple of nights playing, and I wholeheartedly recommend Why Am I Dead At Sea. ♥




**SPOILER** Trigger warning for pills for one of the character's backstories/special abilities.  Since I know several people who would definitely not be able to deal with that, I'm going to tell you what happens.  You can make the decision whether to read it or not.

[spoiler] When you are finding out more about the characters, you might find out Darryl's backstory.  He was happily married for three years, until one day he came home from work late to find his wife had committed suicide by medication overdose.  She had anxiety issues, the extent of which he was not fully aware of, and so it came as a total shock.  If you read his mind and listen to his apathetic speech you'll see he is quite clearly depressed.  He carries empty pill bottles in one of his pockets, and his ability is to take a pill which increases his speed but also blurs his vision (and yours, by default).  If you have problems with things like discussions of overdoses (especially by pills) then maybe this game isn't for you.  However it only plays a small part in the narrative, so it's possible it won't cause any issues if you are prepared for it.[/spoiler]",1467825969,1467825969,True,5,2,0.559952080249786377,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Salinger, [i]The Catcher in the Rye[/i][/b]

[i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] is an underrated gem created by Peltast Software just a year ago. Aside being an incredibly well weaved murder/mystery, it is a unique game that presents the rare opportunity of taking a glimpse on the human nature and the perpetual failure to communicate with one another, keeping unintended secrets while failing to hide things that they intended to hide to begin with. Through associations of the language and the mind, we are to investigate a horrifying affair. You should remember that you can only discover what people do care about the most by taking note on what they do not care about.

Our story starts with a brutal murder; a soul is snatched away from its mortal body before its time. We start as the fragment of this soul, as a piece rendered out of personality due to shock and we remember not a thing about our former mortal identity. Who were we? What happened? Who killed us? With all these ominous questions at mind, we awaken. A young boy medium seemingly managed to help us manifest at the last minute, thus our scarred consciousness has taken form in the cruise ship he's been travelling in as a ghost. We are to wander around, listen to passengers and the crew, and influence their actions by possessing them in hopes of revealing the vile businesses going on in this ship to reach some kind of closure.

The game manages to present a unique atmosphere with a limited environment. We are in an old cruise ship with 3 floors: the residential floor for passengers, the residential floor for the crew and the deck, alongside utilities and recreational areas. Graphics-wise, it's nothing exceptional, but these limited areas are well used in both in display and story purposes, harboring countless unique details that you may investigate and discover. All characters have their own background music, dominating the game according to your interactions with them - and with your ability of taking a glimpse to their minds, you'll gather uneasy clues about their goals and pasts.

We are given unique gameplay dynamics and a well written story. All characters involved has complicated personalities, various conflicting motives and secrets to keep depending on their situations. With all parameters involved, [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] may be interpreted as an Agatha Christie novel with supernatural undertone. You are welcome to possess people if you are to grasp a basic understanding about their personalities and motives only - and still then you can only present subconscious suggestions to manipulate their actions. They cannot talk about a subject they have no idea about to begin with! For the full control of people, you should first reveal the fundamental drive that each of them possess. Only then, you can completely control their actions and speak through their mouths. Each character has a unique ability that could become useful in your investigation, including your ghost self. By revealing details of your own past and personality, you are to gradually gather your former self and memories, presenting grander abilities with stronger manifestations. As the story progresses, you'll find yourself in a web of intrigue, lies and misconceptions.

This whole experience takes 5 chapters to wrap up - 4 investigation chapters and one conclusion chapter - and contains 5 different endings according to your ability to conclude the interrelation of all happenings during the last chapter, presenting you genuine replayability. All said and done, [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] is a noteworthy experience and a thrilling story with more than decent narrative and personality depictions. Enjoy!

MOTHER 시리즈를 보는 듯한 도트 그래픽이 대단히 인상적이다. 보나마나 MOTHER 시리즈에 영향 강하게 받은 것이겠지. 캐릭터와 배경 생긴 것 뿐만 아니라 아예 대화창 까지도 그냥 MOTHER다, 이건. 이 그래픽 때문에 이 게임에 끌린 거긴 하다만.

육체를 잃어버린 영혼이 되어 이 사람 저 사람 몸 속을 돌아다니며 다른 등장인물들과의 대화를 통해 잊어버린 자신의 존재를 깨닫고 사건의 진상을 추리해나가는 게임이다. 자기가 조종하는 캐릭터를 바꿔가며 플레이한다는게 꽤나 재밌게 느껴진다. 그 밖에 캐릭터마다 특수능력을 하나씩 활용할 수 있는데, 게임의 진행상 꼭 필요한 스킬을 지닌 캐릭터가 있는가하면 도무지 왜 넣어놨나 싶을 정도로 방해만 되는 능력을 지닌 놈들도 있다.

Why Am I Dead At Sea于去年二月通过绿光并于五月正式发售，让我惋惜的是这样一款游戏并没有获得足够的关注。它的风格、玩法与故事有足够的潜力让它成为一批人心目中的独立游戏佳作，很可惜这样的事情并没有发生，在我写这篇评测的时候它也在Steam上也仅有55篇评测，metacritics上甚至没有任何用户评分。但是你一定要问我，WAIDAS滋磁不滋磁，这游戏评价这么少玩家不滋磁它呀？他是个独立好游戏，我们怎么不滋磁独立好游戏（？）

由于正文结构有点乱，我先给个TL;DR版：

优点：
+有新意的玩法
+不错的剧情和角色塑造
+画面非常Earthbound，sprite清新好看
+BGM在气氛烘托上效果很到位

缺点：
-流程短
-系统上有累赘设计
-叙事上有些许漏洞
-少量bug

Verdict：推荐
——————————————————

言归正传，如同商店页面的介绍，故事是这样开始的：

[b]你在一艘船上，
而且死了。[/b]

与前作的困在风暴中的旅馆相同，这也是典型的与外界隔绝的凶案现场。经典而老套的悬疑故事设定，迫使主角在事态进一步恶化前解决事件。不同之处在于你是死者的……死魂灵（？），这点在设定上与Ghost Trick及Murdered: Soul Suspect相似，但封闭的设定使游戏的篇幅更加简短。这样短小的故事带来的好处是更加可控的故事及发展，因此作者也能大胆给玩家多那么一点自由度，反正整个场景就那么点，人物就那么几个，加上章节式的结构，随你胡来也不会糟到哪去啦……

游戏的目的是找到真相，进行的方式是附身。主角可以附身在其他乘员身上，通过他们的视角，引导他们说出该说的话来调查与交流来推动剧情发展，找回记忆，并将真相的碎片拼凑在一起。你可以观察他们的内心，就是商店页面中那些够意识流的画面没错——这个能力从功能性上而言基本鸡肋，即使你推动了剧情，或者与其他角色有了足够多够重要的互动，内容也不会变，你也无法从中得到任何足以推进故事的线索，但……这毕竟是一个了解lore的能力。当你对一名角色的了解足够深的时候，你可以完全占据他/她的身体，通过他们说出主角想说的话。

从玩法上来说是挺有新意的，但有些系统有些累赘。我感觉dev在做头两章的时候思路还没有定下来，他们希望比起Why Am I Dead能够添加新的功能和系统，但没有仔细考虑这些东西该怎么用。比如第一章里你可以控制角色像Earthbound那样带着队友到处跑，但这样的场景再也没有发生过。然后之前说的那个看别人内心世界的功能实在也挺鸡肋……再比如我在前面都不愿意提起的扫描能力，你可以看到哪些门你的灵魂能够进去哪些进不去，哪些人能占据之类的……完全不知道这有啥用啊？！目前我发现的这个能力唯一的用途[spoiler]就是发现一个场景中的另一个幽灵[/spoiler]了……

虽然你控制了一名角色，但他/她会说出来的话是受到她的性格和知识限制。每个角色关注的话题不同，比如Alton就会想要大家去他负责的Observation Room玩，而Sue则更关心每个人的工资水平，诸如此类。而当你完全占据了一名角色的时候，你就可以用过他们的嘴以你的知识说出你真正想说的话，但有些特定的对话也只有特定的角色对其他角色说才会触发，而这正很好地服务于……

角色塑造。不同的角色也拥有不同的能力，他们的能力与角色的性格与设定基本相符，因此也导致了一些鬼用没有的能力……但换一个角度看，若将能力视为角色塑造的一部分话，就挺合适的了。Why Am I Dead At Sea这款游戏最成功的一点就在于角色塑造：简单而直指人心的对话，加上角色脑内活动以及平时的活动，将一群有血有肉的鲜活的人展现在你面前。每个人，如同我们，都具有私密的欲望与阴影，差异鲜明的性格与爱好，这个短小精悍（大约5h上下能打通一轮）的游戏居然能将角色塑造得如此之好，挺不得了的，也可能只是我移情作用太强了……

剧情的进展是章节式的，随着剧情推进最终你会到第五章的解谜篇，总体来说这个游戏处处都有经典到成了cliche的组织结构呢……

在解谜篇中，你在之前的章节中获得的信息和证据（以及部分和个别角色的互动）会决定结局的走向。一共有五个结局，导向不同结局的选择则在于你在最后的standoff中在什么时机下用什么角色提供了什么信息。而因为有的信息所有的角色都不知道，因此有的路线要求你完全占据某人，说出你的幽灵知识，走向grand finale。如果你在这之前错过了一些信息，有的结局你就走不通了……

总体而言，Why Am I Dead At Sea的剧情比较令人满意，美中不足的是有少许情节上的漏洞[spoiler]，最后对主角的交代不够，以及部分结局中对一名角色完全没有交待[/spoiler]，以及虽然有五个结局，但结局后的过场只有两种。此外，对话中有许多选择支不会造成任何影响并且可以重复对话，还是蛮可惜的。比如我问你滋磁不滋磁，你可以回答滋磁，然后再对话一次回答不滋磁，也是完全没有影响的。

另外游戏还有一些小问题：

1. 一些trigger的设置问题导致了在一些角色被附身时，即使他/她缺乏一些信息，仍能与一些角色触发关于那些信息的关键对话。
2. 有少量图像显示问题，这一点在Observation Room最为明显。
3. BGM的播放和循环有些问题，会导致在一些时候完全没有音乐，而有时则同时有两个BGM同时播放。

音乐还算不错，有几个曲子在一些场合烘托气氛效果很好。但总体而言曲目数过少，但想想游戏也就这么点规模也倒算是够用了。OST在bandcamp可以免费下载（支付0美元）：

Throughout the game, you are set upon the task of finding out the answer to each of these enigmas, and in doing so you will also learn much about the passengers and crew aboard the ship. I've been waiting almost a year to finally play this title, so needless to say I was hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed; I definitely got a lot more than I expected out of this experience.

The game plays out like an incredibly gripping novel, and at any point it's overwhelmingly difficult to put it dow for even the briefest moment. You will want to continue playing through until the end, so that you can unravel the questions that were roused from the beginning. You will initially start off by getting to casually know the people aboard the vessel, but as you progress throughout the four chapters you will get to know their most intimate details and innermost thoughts. The character building, and the relationships that are formed between them, are key points to the success of Why Am I Dead at Sea; many of the details that you will learn later on in the game, and especially what lies in wait at the end, will have many players on the Feels train, headed full speed towards Feelsville.

So as you may be able to determine, the title relies heavily on dialogue. That being said, the actual gameplay is minimal; as a ghost, you are able to possess the other people on the ship, as well as use their unique special abilities. These special abilities range from extremely beneficial, such as Donnovan who can highlight interactive objects, to utterly useless, like Darryl who can walk faster but at the disadvantage of having the screen become disoriented. Needless to say, you probably will not utilize of most of these special abilities, despite possessing the characters multiple times. To fully understand the story, and to uncover your ""true"" self as the ghost, you will talk to everyone around the ship at least once on every chapter, and at some point you will also be tasked to investigate every room aboard the liner. These are not incredibly daunting or time consuming tasks, as the boat only has three floors and ten passengers.

Once you get to know a character completely, you are then free to fully possess them; doing so enables new dialogue options to appear at certain stages of the game. Once you reach the end of the fourth and final chapter, you then proceed on to unlock an array of different endings. While the endings are somewhat diversified, there is in fact one true ending in the mix; however, you are still left to piece together, yourself, many of the riddles that the game presents. This is a nice change of pace, versus games that feel the need to explain their outcome in excruciating detail; it also leaves an air of mystery to the title, and one that is open to interpretation.

As a final note, I will say that the soundtrack by Bill Kiley is an absolute masterpiece. I never found myself getting tired of the amazing retro, Sega Genesis styled bytes that were infiltrating my ears; from the downright creepy, to the dubstep influenced, to the upbeat. The only gripe that I do have is that each letter of dialogue makes a sound, and it overtakes the background tracks. These sounds, however, can be easily bypassed by pressing the action key; although it would be nice to have the option to turn it off completely. It's also worth noting that if you enjoy retro soundtracks, the one for this game can be downloaded for free, or pay what you want, at Bill's Bandcamp page.

Why Am I Dead at Sea is one of the best mystery games on Steam at this point, and it's unfortunate that it's severely underrated and often bypassed. As of now, this will be the 55th review for this game. The depth of the characters is really where this game shines, without that element, Why Am I Dead at Sea would not be the diamond in the rough that it is. The only way that the experience could've been improved was if the ship was a little larger, and the story a little longer. With talking to everyone, obtaining all of the endings, and earning all of the achievements, I clocked in at a little under 5 hours. Since the time that I initially posted this review, this title has seen a significant price drop, and the current price of $5.49 CAD is very fair for the amount of content that you get. If you can nab it on sale, it's one hell of a steal for a must-play title.

""Why am I Dead At Sea"" is a wonderful narrative-based game that desperately needs more love.

These small 2D characters have more dimension to them than most from AAA releases; they're broken in sympathetic and often relatable ways, and the methods used to convey them show how effective games can be for storytelling.

I do strongly recommend the game despite some faults; a few story details weren't elaborated on as much as I would've liked, even after the 'true' ending. Progression can be a little tedious or obtuse at times, mainly due to having to exhaust dialogue options with every character combination. Also, I did come across a couple of game breaking glitches (usually getting stuck somewhere with the cat), not to mention issues with music cutting out. Hopefully these can be resolved, not deal-breaking due to frequent saves but still something to be aware of.

I've not really heard of anybody mentioning it, and well, at this moment, it only has 50 reviews!

I would have to say that I would recommend this game to just about anybody that I know. I imagine most people would really enjoy this game - if they truly enjoy story focus, that is.

The whole premise of the game is to find out what is going down on a supposed ""cruise"" ship, as you are the ghost of someone who has died while the ship was sailing. Further, you do not even know who you are when the game begins, and you have to find that out as well - however, that question is a lot simpler, and is easy to figure out before the game actually confirms it.

In order to gain more information, you meet with a kid who seems to be able to communicate with ghosts, who will guide you as you go along. Using his advice, you possess other passengers and have them communicate with others on the ship, or go investigate rooms, attempting to gain any bits of information possible. Of course, you can't just possess someone and have them do crazy actions; your capabilities are limited early on in the game. However, once you learn more about the characters, you seem to be able to channel a stronger connection with them, and can then have them say or ask things that do not fit their normal actions.

As a whole, that is pretty much the setup of the game. There are a few other things here and there, like each character has a special ability that you can use while possessing them, but for the most part, it is really just to possess, ask questions, and sneak around.

The story of the game is both really well-done, but at the same time, has some very large cons to it, at least for me. I am going to avoid any spoilers and will be high-level so as to not completely ruin the game, so don't worry. But if you choose to avoid even broad complaints of the plot, skip the next two paragraphs.

In any case, there was one particular character whom I thought very early on was the problem - but as the game went along, it definitely leads you down different passages of thought, making you question yourself. That in itself is a pro for the story, but my con is that I ended up being correct about my initial thought, and the ending of the story somewhat cheaply threw it together to prove it, based on a singular minor detail.

Similarly, some background events that happened during the story ended up being connected to something a lot bigger by the end of the game, even though it did not really make sense to me when it happened. Perhaps it is because I played the game across multiple sittings, I don't know... But I just felt like the finale did not set the story up well enough.

Either way, the game has nice graphics and indeed looks Earthbound-style as many people say. I do not remember there being that many distinct songs in the game, but the ones I do remember were definitely nice. My main complaint in this area is that the game did not have a resolution setting to fit my laptop (1600x900), and during certain cutscenes, the screen seemed to get ""stuck"" and wouldn't re-focus to fit the entire event happening.

The game is decent length, but could probably be done in one sitting by many people. My time is over 10 hours, but that is both with pause/idle time, as well as collecting the achievements that I didn't obtain by the end of the game. I would probably suggest that you try to do it in one sitting, actually, since it would be more beneficial to keep all of the information fresh in mind. For me, it was 3 sittings across 4 days, I believe, because I did not know how long the game would be and so just played it late in the evenings.

So go ahead, get the game, set sail on the ship, and find out whodunit!",1457290790,1457291375,True,2,1,0.559244394302368164,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As I said before, the premise is great - you are dead. Nothing can change that. You are a ghost and you don't remember who you are or how you've dead. Your mission is to recover your identity and to try to investigate the reason of your death, if any.

As a ghost you can read other people minds and even posses other characters eventually. That way you can talk as your host and interact with other characters. Every character has its own personality and motivations (some of them lack of both btw) so is nice to see how different can be one character when talking to two different people. Nothing is as it seems to be at first and the characters will surprise you with their real personalities. 

As I pointed before the idea behind gameplay is cool but its not so well implemented, leaving you several times with no idea of what to do next or letting stuck physically on some points like doors or stairs. Luckily, the set of characters is pretty limited so the same are the options to interact to. 

Graphics are pretty simple, but effective. I understand that the main focus of the game relies on narrative rather than any other aspect so it didn't bother me at all. But for the same reason, you can't afford to have narrative inconcruencies in your game, like possess a character and talk about yourself in 3rd person as it wasn't you. (i.eg. with Gwen at the end).

Another disappointing thing are the endings. Yes, the game has 4 endings but all of them are pretty similar and kind of lame. Plus, some of them overlaps with the others so you can't properly trigger them in order to get some achievements. Even if you try following a guide. It would be great that this thing is corrected in future updates.

[spoiler]As I sad before the spoiler tag, all endings are similar and none of them have a real conclusion for the main character. That's pretty disappointing. You lead the main role and you don't know what happens to you at the end. I didn't expect a happy ending (you are dead from the very beginning afterall) but I was willing to know more about the captain background and that wasn't the case, leaving you with the feeling that your death was just the excuse for playing the game. The endings leave the story unnecessarily open.[/spoiler]

While it’s not a unique concept for a game – a similar title includes Square Enix’s Murdered: Soul Suspect among others. However, I argue that none of the games that I have come across does the concept as well as Peltast Software has…

Brilliant soul jumping mechanic: An important part that the game absolutely nails is the soul jumping mechanic. As a dead spirit you’re able to jump into the souls of the living characters on board the ship. Before you can solve your murder, however, you will have to find the clues and help these other characters solve their own mysteries or complete the quests that they have waiting for you. For example, the first such major quest, has you finding out who stole a family heirloom in the form of a vase. These quests first introduce you to the characters on board the ship then is utilized as a vehicle to enhance character development and to tell the narrative of the game. It was an intelligent design decision that keeps you immersed in the game. This soul jumping mechanic also enables you to read the minds of the characters who you have possessed. In order to take control of a person you must have achieved a spiritual connection with them previously – a further intelligent decision that makes players realize the depths of the story.

Superlative writing: What suckered me in most wasn’t actually the soul jumping mechanic even though I compliment it highly. Rather, it was the superlative writing. A lot of titles these days claim to be story driven experiences but few are able to maintain such a clarity of focus and achievement as what Patrick McGrath has. To think that this game was designed by just one person is quite remarkable. There is quite a significant amount of depth to the story and it handles a large number of real world issues inside a single game tackling them all with poise and grace beyond McGrath’s years. Each contributes wonderfully to the story without ever distracting the player from the game. A rare achievement.

16-bit and soundtrack mastery: The screenshots of the game tell you exactly what to expect from a graphical standpoint. It’s your traditional 16-bit game. I never had any issues with the graphics, I never found any bugs and do not have anything to say negatively about them. In fact, I would suggest that McGrath has done a very reasonable job in realizing his game world through the utilization of these graphics. Some may argue that this a simple achievement but I am certain that we have all played 16-bit games that have been riddled with annoyances. You will not find that here. The game’s soundtrack has been composed by Bill Kiley from Eugene, Oregon and who has quickly developed a very good reputation in video games. He is currently working on music for Katana Zero which will certainly be a game to keep an eye open for. Kiley is at his very best throughout the entirety of the soundtrack and I would wholeheartedly recommend that you not only purchase this game but the soundtrack as well. Best of all is that you can name your price (no minimum) for the album. You can purchase it here on Kiley’s bandcamp page.

Difficult to criticize: In my opinion there really isn’t much to critique in regards to Why Am I Dead At Sea. If I had to pinpoint anything at all it’s that I found it very simple to accidentally re-talk to a character. This may lead to you replaying the same dialogue that you’ve read multiple times. Although I find this to be a negative there is also a positive in this for those of you who accidentally skip a line of dialogue – which may ultimately prove to be essential to understanding the solution of the story. Otherwise this is a truly special game that has been criminally overlooked.

Why Am I Dead At Sea is one of the most intelligently crafted games that I have experienced to date. The grace in which important social issues are tackled is astounding. It is sincerely a must play title.

The art felt derivative and simple; the chiptune soundtrack suggested a by-the-numbers approach to game design. I am relieved to report that these initial doubts fell by the wayside after only a little play, and surface concerns of this sort disappeared entirely once I submerged myself in the mystery.

The central conceit is that you're the spirit of someone recently killed, and you can inhabit the bodies of people you know to access their abilities and research the circumstances of your death. If you learn enough about your host, you can take full control, doing things that they wouldn't normally or discussing subjects of which they know nothing. This didn't seem very original in my initial (uncharitable) assessment—Double Fine's ""Stacking"" treads similar ground. However: ""Stacking"" is a high-concept artpiece puzzler that I couldn't bring myself to finish. ""Why Am I Dead At Sea"" is a [b]thriller[/b]. It has [b]suspense[/b]. It has characters that [b]appear[/b] to inhabit straightforward archetypes—and then it challenges [b]you[/b] to figure out whether those characters have contradictory depths, or complementary depths, or no depth whatsoever.

I played through it twice in eight hours.

Highly recommended.",1452659067,1568509303,True,31,1,0.789422810077667236,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Su premisa me pareció intrigate y su estética atractiva, pero me resultaba dificil imaginar como sería su jugabilidad a la práctica. Investigando un poco me topé con su predecesor, un juego  gratuito llamado Why Am I Dead. Se trata de una aventura muy sencilla, de apenas media hora de duración. Me pareció un juego magnífico, la verdad. Se trataba de un extenso puzzle de diálogo que consistía que conseguir que una cadena de personajes se sonsacasen información entre sí. Una vez conocido el limitado plantel del personajes disponibles la solución al puzzle resultaba muy intutiva y satisfactoria. Realmente funciona muy bien como demo de Why Am I Dead at Sea, recomiendo jugarlo a cualquiera que esté indeciso.

Este juego es mucho más largo que su predecesor, además de ser sustancialmente más complejo a nivel mecánico. Cada uno de los personajes dispone de una habilidad especial y es posible leer su mente. Curiosamente estas novedades no tienen a penas utilidad práctica a nivel jugable y su principal razón de ser es enriquecer la ambientación. También disponemos de la habilidad de poseer completamente a un personaje, teniendo así acceso a un set adicional opciones de diálogo (aunque un porcentaje importante de éstas se repite independientemente del personaje poseido). Es muy de agradecer que cuando existen todavía líneas de diálogo sin explorar entre el presonaje actualmente poseido y otro cualquiera éste aparezca marcado con un bocadillo.

La personalidad de los personajes está bien definda y son definitivamente el corazón de este juego. El desarrollo del juego está planteado de tal manera que casi todo avance está vinculado al descubrimiento de nuevos detalles sobre las motivaciones y problemas de cada uno de ellos. La narrativa y la jugabilidad están perfectamente integradas.

El apartado artístico es simple pero agradable. Los escenarios son bastante minimalistas, pero nunca llegan a parecer desolados. Los sprites tienen personalidad y están bien animados, aunque en algún momento se hecha en falta algo de expresividad. La música es variada y pegadiza, aunque en alguna ocasión desentona un poco con la situación (debido a que se adapta al personaje poseido). Los diálogos de los personajes están sonorizados con distintas clases de pitidos a modo de voces. Personalmente me parece una decisión bastante acertada, ayuda mucho a dar ambiente.

El juego tiene una serie de bugs que pueden llegar a ser algo molestos. En mi caso uno de los personajes se quedó atrapado en una escalera cerca del final del juego y tuve que reiniciar la partida. Otros fallos menores incluyen opciones de diálogo que no concuerdan con el contexto, congelaciones temporales del scroll y otras cosas bastante random.

Si buscais una aventura sencilla y bien narrada, dadle una oportunidad a Why Am I Dead at Sea. Si teneis dudas jugad primero a Why Am I Dead (que además de ser gratuito en mi opinión es aun más redondo). De hecho hacedlo en cualquier caso, ya que sus historias están relacionadas.",1452444158,1452444158,True,3,0,0.562892496585845947,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The idea of possessing people is nothing new, but with each person you posses in order to learn about the death, the amount of backstory and character interaction you guy is truly outstanding. If you are ever lost and don't know what to do, which will happen at some points, then you can accidentally find some neat information about all of the passengers on deck.

The boat is so small so when you are moving from body to body it never feels too much of a chore because the map is so small that is quite simple to go from one room to the next.

If you are ever stuck, one of the characters gives great advice for you, and if you still don't get, they'll just flat out say it. Is nice to have something to help you on this journey.

There is a few glitches in this game. Some are as simple as a character getting stuck on the stairs, but others include the game not accepting that you have already went through a line of dialogue so you have to redo that conversation all over again so be prepared.

Overall, a great game so check it out!

No other game I've played more successfully weaves together intrigue, the supernatural, and complex characters. It has a mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat and tempt you to blow through the game in one sitting. There's a near-perfect balance of dark and humorous, of realistic and paranormal.

The characters are perhaps the game's most incredible element. As a ghost, you are able to possess characters and interact with objects and other characters. There's completely different dialogue for every combination of unwitting vessel and interviewee. You also have the ability to peer directly into each character's mind, showing their desires, internal conflict, and views of the world.

Before I start let's state the obvious. [b] Why am I dead at Sea [/b] is less of a classical game and heavily story focused. But it is a story supported nearly perfectly by its gameplay mechanics. Most time you will read text. If I had to label the game I would probably call it an adventure. Not the ones where you search and combine items but where you acquire and combine information. It is a story about people on a ship.

The game starts rather unpleasant for the protagonist. He is dead, he doesn't know who he is and he can't remember anything else as well. Why? Most of those questions will be answered over the course of the game. As a ghost you have different abilities, some which you will gain only later on. At the beginning you can read the mind of the people on board. Not word for word but as an overall impression. Later, with learning more about the people on board you will be able to control them, first partially and some completely. This is interesting as a gameplay element because as player you know more than the people you control and you can't ask the right questions because your current character doesn't know what you need. But if you control them completely those characters gain this knowledge for the time. There is for example a brilliant scene where you look up a ""locked"" place with one of the characters and then confront the same character with another one although he could actually never obtain this information. You also have to regard the relation between the different characters because they are not willing to tell/ask everyone everything. And with the game going on you will learn more and more about the tragic to happen and the people on board.

The game is divided in different chapters. To complete each chapter there is a certain amount of information needed to be found. But there can be found more than that (especially in the last chapter) which may lead to a different ending.

I was pleasantly surprised by [b] Why am I dead at Sea [/b] and as such it is the first game I recommand which I have not completed to 100 % at the point of recommandation. I wouldn't call it actually ""fun"" to play but interesting. It is not the most epic story ever but is surprising at points and the way the gameplay is used to unfold the story is intriguing. So go and buy the game and support the developers. Do not let the game become bundled -_-

This game is absolutley ASTOUNDING!!  This game has so much development and so many curveballs to through.  This games gameplay is everything that is presented in the games trailer, but if you don't know I'll explain.  You play as the ghost of an unkown person who was on a ship so, as said ghost, you get to possess people and use them to interact with other characters, and learn more about their past, find out their purpose on the boat, and gather evadants to find out who killed you.  The controls are perfect and very simple, which is good because what more do you need to do than interact, and possess.  The EARTHBOUND style graphics really make this game feel special for some reason, and every character is presented well through there sprites.

This games feature's and game mode's are standard.  There is the very enriching and indepth tale that is filled to absolute brim with fun and sad character arks, and lots of moments to pull at your heart strings.  I won't spoil to, to much, but this where I talk about the story, so stop if you wanna keep everything a surprise.  SO.  The characters will never be what they seem like and always are very much the opposite of what you will first perseve them as.  Every chapter is going to shock you, and people are going to die in the story and it will always surpise you who.  Finally the game has a few nods to the original flash game which is kinda cool.

We currently live immersed in the most creative an eclectic single period in videogame history thanks to the current indie scene. Not only as a consequence of the creation of new game concepts, but also to the revision of genres of the past adding new innovative elements. It’s amazing to think that only in the JRPG influenced genre using 16 bits aesthetics, we have seen in a year interval 5 of the all-time greatest classics in the form of [i]Lisa[/i], [i]Always Sometimes Monsters[/i], [i]Undertale[/i], [i]Hylics[/i] and [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i]. With each one being a different deviation of the classic structure putting a lot of new ideas to the table. While they maintain some recognizable premises and mechanics to appeal to the players most beloved memories, using the nostalgia as a tool to generate vivid emotions. And most importantly, each of these 5 masterpieces can equal and even surpass the original referenced titles. If we look at the past, we can see that not even in the most creative and fertile period for JRGP games in the mid-90s, we could find a single year with such a sum of instant classics.

But between all these masterpieces, [i]Lisa[/i], [i]Undertale[/i], [i]Hylics[/i] and [i]Always Sometimes Monsters[/i], I think that [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] is a leap forward from the rest. Because it is not only a brilliant and almost perfect JRPG influenced classic with a plethora of charisma in which every second is an immense pleasure, full of magic and unforgettable moments. It’s also a great achievement in its use of an interactive narrative element to create strong emotional ties between characters. With each one being infused with his own and complex psychological behavior. That can evolve based in the affective interactions created with other persons as part of life.

And with one of the most mature writings seen in a videogame. Introducing a lot of complex subjects like suicidal motivations, illness, unrequited love, consumerism, third world poverty, psychological reasoning beneath violence, youthful frustrated dreams, lack of communication, isolation, false appearances and the existence of two personalities living inside every single person, the one that he shows to the rest of the world and how he perceives himself. And all of this without forgetting its videogame nature, emphasizing the fun factor with the use of fantastical elements and a lot of winks destined to drawing a joyful smile in our faces.

Its playable mechanic is based on the idea of being the floating spirit of a dead person that needs to reconstruct his memories. So he/she needs to posses the body of the rest of characters in the game to gathering information. This idea on paper looks simple, but has an infinite number of variations and complex sub-mechanics. There is two types of possessions. With one of them, we incarnate the role of the other person, seeing the world from his eyes perspective. And with the second possession, we supplant his body, acting based on our own conscience that is molded by the clues found in the form of saved memories. And finally, we have a mental skill that permits us to trespass the subconscious of a character without taking his body. This mental plane is expressed in the form of a psychedelic alternate reality.

Based in the person or role that we incarnate, every single character in the game will react in a different manner and the subjects of conversation will change. Also, each possessed character has his own special ability. While we incarnate the role of a female writer, we can push a button during a conversation to analyze the psychological motivations of the other character. With a thief, we can see the objects that the other character carries in his pockets. And the special ability of a depressive person is to ingest antidepressant pills, seeing a distorted reality for some seconds.

In order to be able to possess another person, we need to previously reach a spiritual connection with him. Learning about his feelings, hopes and inner fears. And about his world envision and philosophy of life. To could reach this short of spiritual connection with a character in the game, we are obligated to interact with him using the rest of bodies and personalities until he opens his heart.

[i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] is a piece of interactive fiction that primarily talks about the healing effects of communicating with others as the only manner to overcome our traumas. Under the assumption that no man is a desert island. 

This accomplished use of narrative comes accompanied by an evocative graphic design inspired in [i]Earthbound[/i]. An by a captivating soundtrack composed by Bill Kiley, that with a single game has put his name close to some of the most iconic musicians in gaming history, evoking Yasunori Mitsuda or Jake Kaufman most iconic works.

If you are one of these people obsessed with numbers, I can say that [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] is a perfect [b]10/10[/b]. And my most firm candidate to the [b]Best Game of 2015[/b].

Story driven games like To the Moon and Last Word are classic examples of narrative over action. You don't need flashy graphics and explosions to make a good game. Dead At Sea captures this in natural style with its supernatural themes. From the moment you begin to play, your immediately entranced. You are given the powers of possession and to read minds and set loose aboard a vessel with a unique ensemble of characters. Someone aboard the vessel is your murderer. Can you find out who? Through conversation, puzzles, and a little bit of trickery. You will guide your ghastly visage in a tale that takes many twists and turns. With multiple endings adding even more layers of complexity to the story. Graphically the game is akin to a darker Earthbound style of avatars. It feels like an RPGMaker style game but is different and unique enough that I appreciate. The music is used quite effectively as the tone of the game shifts. As you possess different characters, enter different rooms, or read minds. I liked this quite a bit. The music gave personality to each of the characters and scenes. 
In all it was very difficult to find anything really wrong with the game. It's bug free and plays well. The only problem I found was that the momentum of the game was hard to maintain. With little direction given to the player as to what to do next. The goals were sometimes obscure and confusing. Only being made clear by constantly running back to your guide. This caused the game to drag a bit. As I constantly kept having to find the target I needed to possess over and over as they move about the ship. This lead to some frustrating moments. Nonetheless Why Am I Dead At Sea is a fantastic story and a example of how to do story driven game.

The game isn't without it's problems though, there's a lot of running back and forth, and some puzzles can be a tad tough to figure out once you no longer have Paulo to resort to for hints. Overall it's a great game if you're looking for a gripping storyline.

Having the full unlock on the characters just essentially double the number of characters I had to control to test all the conversation options.  It would be nice if the characters whom you could share knowledge with, just had that added when you possessed them instead of having two kinds of possession.  Some characters were also unable to start conversations with certain people or open doors when super possessed.  

Also programming the boy to tell us which character we need to talk from, or which character we need to talk to, in order to advance would be very helpful. it was 8x8 conversation testing to see if any of the conversations changed sometimes, and 16x8 with the second possession type, and then another multiplier of like 4 for each dialogue the new content might be in.",1431996659,1431996659,True,2,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b] Summary: [/b]  

Why am I Dead At Sea hits the points it needs to for the genre, as the narrative and interesting characters set a decent backdrop for this murder mystery. Attempting to figure out how you died and taking control of people via possession is a fun mechanic, and there are little touches that really help the game out like characters having their own music, and their own abilities. This does have the old school adventure game logic however: you will get frustrated wondering what is going on and will run around trying to figure out what you missed. And certain bugs can pop up that can halt all progress, which is a problem. But even with that said, it's a great narriative that will help those gamers lookinjgj for a mystery experience. 

[b]Gameplay Footage and Video Review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g27FrJ0yhH8[/b] 

[u] Lists: [/u]
[b]Positives:[/b]
[list]
[*] Great narrative and a good set of writing here. Gives you reasons to get into the plot in question and makes you really want to see what happens next.
[*] Character variety is strong and keeps the mystery going, even when a character or two is eliminated as a possible suspect. Backstories help connect you to these characters on an emotional level.
[*] Music is appropriate for every character, and really helps bring their mood and emotional state to life. 
[*] Good visuals, and change of scenery when it happens. It's not a big game, but something has changed (in particular the outside), it works rather well.
[*] Gets the mystery portion of the game down without reaching to do it. Doesn't force the element, which is critical in a good mystery plot.
[/list]

[b]Negatives:[/b]
[list]
[*] Trial and Error gameplay logic. Keep a notepad with you to write down what you did and didn't do. A couple of tools could have been used to help this in terms of not repeating actions you've done already.
[*] Some bugs seemingly (this is not CONFIRMED on my side) stop progress entirely. 
[*] Some characters lack of personality change with unveiling of certain items hurts overall connection to characters.
[*] Wish the mind reading mechanic had a tiny bit more use to it. Was fun, but ultimately didn't do much overall.

The gameplay can be really challenging. For me, at some objectives it took awhile to figure out what to do but eventually I did find solutions. There are times where you may get stuck, and repeat conversations with different characters to see what you missed which can be quite time consuming. Despite that, the storyline is amazing; sometimes humorous, other times really dark and leaves you thinking alot about...idk life and reality.

It's not a clone by any means; Earthbound was a true turn-based RPG while this is a more puzzle-y narrative-driven adventure with a supernatural twist.

The good:
-Great pixel graphics and environments
-Great character work; each person has a different personality, motives, secrets and strengths
-These differences are more interesting when you possess them in order to find out what happened to you
-Diving into people's minds was executed very well
-I really got invested in wanting to find out what makes these people tick and what happened to me
-The music in the game is fun and true to their retro roots
-Tons of unique dialogue to trigger depending on who you are 
-Great throwbacks to Earthbound

Cons:
-Not a wide variety of music to hear; can get a little repetitive as you walk around
-Some of the puzzles are difficult to figure out (Who needs to do what and where? Etc.) which leads to some extra wandering around
-Can be difficult to tell who is talking when you are learning who is who; dialogue boxes could have been positioned more over the person talking instead of centered on the screen
-Which there was more interactivity with mind-reading (A mini-game to learn secrets would have been cool, or literally explore their mind (Like Alundra on PSX?) and unlock secrets that way.)
