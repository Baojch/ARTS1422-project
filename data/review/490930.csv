Let’s get through them starting with the positives.

- The soundtrack is great! It adds to the intensity and urgency during some missions and very much fits with the whole mass surveillance theme. 
- Some missions were very good and fun. Definitely some memorable ones especially when you got better clearance levels. (As long as they weren’t crossmatch missions which I’ll get to in a bit) 

And that’s about it with the positives :/ on to the negatives which overall, lead me to not recommend this game especially if you respect your time.

- Bad tutorials. One of the biggest problems with the game. The guide talks pretty fast and the dialogue during its explanations keeps going rather than clicking to proceed which can make you easily miss information on what to do. Often times I felt like I was thrown into a pool expecting to know how to swim. This was especially the case with what I think is the worst mission type in the game, crossmatch. I was just lost with these missions and just rushed through them. I saw in a couple of cases I could just approve everyone very quickly and my performance would still be good.
- Money is useless. All you can do with your hard earned cash is spending it on items for your house that serve no purpose other than just sitting there. [spoiler] (Near the end of the game, you go to prison and are on the run after escaping which further adds to the uselessness of money and items from the shop.)[/spoiler] You never have to pay rent other than one point in the game but you can easily do something to not pay. Other similar games like Not Tonight, papers please etc had much better economies and it would’ve been nice to have some upgrades for work that you could buy.
- The game overstays it’s welcome. I think this game is way too long and drags on especially with the home missions where you have to find data to sell. At first they were alright but it got really tedious once you had to balance between 3 sellers. I didn’t do the home missions for money, more so I did them to keep the relationship between the sellers high and not get a game over. I think what would’ve been better is to have the main story be shorter and make an endless mode for those who want more. 
- Unfulfilled promises. I certainly think this is one of the biggest disappointments. Once I learned this game was made possible by kickstarter, I went to its page and saw that the only stretch goals implemented were a series of missions like taking down a cult, finding stolen artifacts, rigging an election etc. The ones that would’ve been really nice like better customization, clearance level 0 and arcade mode were never implemented despite being reached. I also saw comments from the dev saying they are working on a spin-off for this game but that was back in 2020 and their social media hasn’t had a post since then which leads me to believe they’ve abandoned plans altogether which is a big shame.",1696572164,1696572164,False,2,0,0.54114997386932373,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I mostly liked the game the game mechanics but it was too long for me with about 25-30h to complete. I felt some clearance levels were stretching for way too long and a shorter experience would have been more enjoyable.

The story is completely linear and you only have an illusion of choice with the dialogue. The only variation possible from the story is to lose. I made the choice to not interact with anyone with the dating app but the story forces you to be in couple with your hometown friend. I never leaked data to Denys but it still ends up backfiring at you. Same thing goes with Tripwire, you have no other way to handle them.

During the game, I never felt there was much at stake. I would have liked to have some dilemma when making a decision for suspects. The only times I wasn't 100% in compliance was because I made slight mistakes, never because I was compelled to protect people or serve some personnal interest. So most of the time I had no interest to know how much % of compliance I gained, nor my ranking changed.

The part I most enjoyed was the end where the rythm was different, even if it was still linear, I liked the sense of story progression and the interrogation gameplay.

I would love to see a sequel, maybe shorter with a non linear story and more stakes.",1681479356,1681479356,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,0,False,False,False,True,,,

I value choices in these types of games more than anything, however the developers really had just one type of character in mind; you can't be completely devoted to the Department, and you can't be a rebel either.

I would give this a 3/5 if such a ratings system existed on Steam.

This game reminds me a lot of Papers, Please but it lacks the urgency of PP.  There is a clock ticking down but as far as I could tell there were no repercussions to letting it run out.  Most of the missions were solved within 2 hours of the clock ticking and there’s no pro or con to finishing by a certain time.  This is one of many parts of the game where I thought, “Why is this here, it serves no purpose”.

The after work missions get extremely tedious.  I did all of them but I wonder if you didn’t whether the ending would have been different.  Something tells me it would not have mattered.  You get money but besides one particular time, it doesn’t matter if you do anything with it or not.  There’s another after work “task” that you can do that does nothing other than add a distraction (trying to be vague to be spoiler free here) and I stopped doing it halfway through the game with again, no repercussions.

Trying to select points on the map is a huge pain especially when there are multiple suspects in a location.  The map keeps scrolling and the location point doesn’t lock very well onto the mouse.  A lot (all maybe?) of the dialogue screens are off-center and near the bottom of the screen.  So you’re watching a cut scene and it’s in the bottom 30% of your computer monitor and not centered. Seems like a weird style choice along with half-hiding the graphics for home/office/etc.  There are a couple of missions that I had to write down data or take pictures of the screen to correlate data between people because there wasn’t a good way of doing this in game.  Also had some graphics issues where the screen would bounce around randomly.

The last act of the game really tried my patience.  I had to restart multiple levels because the data I was pulling wasn’t right and this is already a very lengthy game where there isn’t a meaningful change in mechanics so it was feeling REALLY tedious by this point.

All that having been said, I did enjoy the game from a storyline standpoint and the data correlation/searching aspect.  If there was a sequel with the gameplay problems fixed and the stakes were higher, I would definitely check it out.",1676149298,1676149298,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Need to Know came from the era of Orwell - which I've also played, loved and reviewed - basically pattern matching gameplay laid on top of a ""visual"" novel (only without boobs). The gameplay, while has to be involved and brain-teasing, needs to tells a story.

Orwell excelled with being a more aggressively ramped-up authoritarian nightmare. A seemingly more far-fetched future. A story where an outsider can help control information, narratives, and through that, the truth and history.

(Mild spoilers ahead, skip next paragraph if you don't wanna know anything)

Need to Know, on the other hand, writes a story in a near future - where we may be right now, or in a few years. You play as a US citizen, whose sole power is to prosecute, to ""just follow orders"", and meanwhile trying to survive a personal political hell. You play yourself into becoming a regular crimer, a warcrimer, and a national terrorist. You see repercussion of your own actions in the story. You may justify yourself into believing you're fighting for ""the truth""; yet the information you are given keeps getting worse, and it makes you wonder if you're becoming a eugenicist and a fascist. At that point, the only winning move may just be not to play, or yeet yourself into prison.

(Spoiler over)

If you choose to play on, the gameplay is more involved than Orwell - while Orwell only makes you marks single pieces of evidence, Need to Know makes you show the link between different pieces of seemingly unrelated information - only becoming related because you are given inside knowledge of what they may have been doing. Messages, tweets, locations, bank statements, satellite images, heartbeats - all the data we give willingly these days - can and will be used against them. You request more data, you use that data to find incriminating evidence, and you string them together to prosecute them. Everyday is like a mini-Sherlock Holmes mind palace minigame, only it keeps getting more complicated. It can get repetitive, but being engaged to the story and the new data types will help mitigate it a little bit.

The game isn't anywhere near what was promised (equivalent to the bad state of ""No Man's Sky"" at release).

None of the stretch goals were ever implemented, despite getting 4x the amount requested and it being a popular game on Steam at one time.

The game promised ""meaningful choices"", and various other options and customizability, but most ""choices"" [spoiler]merely lead to a game over[/spoiler].

This game had so much promise, and unfortunately, the game developers weren't and aren't clear about what the game actually entails, and a lot comes down to fussy micromanaging of elements outside of normal gameplay that aren't fun, rewarding, or interesting. Your choices there also don't appear to actually matter.

I fell for the idea of this game immediately when it was pitched, I was super patient, but this game ends up getting a hard pass from me. There's nowhere near enough actual ""game"" to play, and even with fewer bugs, it's mostly an exercise in frustration.

The sad thing was? I would've been happy to give the developer a lot more credit if they had ever done exactly one thing: been a lot more honest and up-front with what was and wasn't going to happen with the community. The community was never valued by this company, and unfortunately that means unlike the disaster that used to be ""No Man's Sky"", this is a game that, while at least it wasn't instantly abandoned, will never end up being even half the game that was promised.

Also unfortunately, since the decision to not do any of the stretch goals, and not truly ""complete"" the game as promised, obviously wasn't sudden...this is the sort of game where it WOULD have been a saving grace if they would've let the community take up the mantle via modding support, but this also never happened.

Now guess which way the devs of this game take. Right. Number 2.

This was one of the hardest games for me in the last years to force myself to get all achievements.
But the game isn't hard. Instead it is very easy, but unnecessary long (real playtime around 20 hours) and amazingly boring.
The ground premise of the story and the first hours of gameplay were really good and kept me going.
But soon all the flaws popped up:

- While some missions tell you, there is time pressure ... there is no countdown gameplay wise.
- There is no way to arrange your screen with nearly 1/2 of unnecessary infos for the mission, 1/5 for the mission info and only the rest for the changing mission data you need to process.
- While the game has a linear story and missions, that follow up older ones, there is no database or such and using info from it in further investigations.
- The very few times, the game expands the gameplay and make it a bit more complex (for example compare infos from different suspects), it ruins this step, by not changing your possible way to process the data.

The funny thing is, that with a way shorter game length/less missions (around five hours) I would have looked other all these flaws and would have given this game a thumbs up.",1636927466,1636927466,False,7,0,0.606986880302429199,0,True,False,False,False,,,

---------SPOILER TERRITORY. SORRY I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE FORMATTING---------


The story is fairly well written. It can be a little iffy at times when it comes to the grand scheme of things, but if you hold your suspension of disbelief, mainly the idea that someone could rise through the ranks like that and that you are pretty much the lynchpin for everything that happens in the story, it works well. I do wish that there were more outs from the story as time goes by, but you can only put so many options into a game before you start over-writing it. 
While I'm talking about endings, I'll bring up probably my least favorite one. One of the final endings is just one or two sentences and then it boots you back to the main menu. I get that they weren't trying to take a side in the underlying debate in the game, but it does seem a little strange when you have dialogue choices mean almost the exact same thing multiple times in the story.
I love how the characters are implemented into the story. On Day 2 meet someone who has your back. And that same person is with you until the final major decision. He's well developed and seems almost human with the way he's written, having real motivations behind his actions that are very relatable to many people. Almost every main character you interact with has an effect on the story if they don't straight up give you a way out of the story. For those that don't give you a way out, they still plant seeds into your mind. What those seeds may be will vary and what they grow into is up to you, but the fact still remains that they have really thought the writing out.
The mechanics of the game have also been very thought out. It may look like dots on a map when you first start out, but it quickly expands when you hover over that dot. A name and a picture along with a general location does enough to put meaning into a character that will be on your screen for about a minute. And then there's more information on the person once you click on them, information that will almost never have an impact on the case at hand. As you go through their data, it plants more seeds of doubt in the system. And then you have to click one of two buttons. Do they go free, or do they not go free? No matter what button you click, there will be text that pops up. That text tells you what happens to that person. Solely because of what you decided to do. The weight behind all that is monumental at times. It makes you question your decisions at times. And it is absolutely well done.
The commentary on the security/liberty debate is where this game really shines. By establishing a connection with someone who will be on your side until the end of the game, it ensures that the line for most people will be blurred. It's story is written well enough to have it come out to you at points and ask you if what you are doing is right and warns you that it's a dangerous path that lies ahead if you continue down it. As you keep climbing the ladder at the DoL, it's not just the people around you that starts to make you question the morality of everything that happens here. That's before you start to notice that the decisions are starting to become less and less mundane as time goes by. And as it all comes to a head, there's one question in your mind:
How much are you willing to sacrifice for security?
This question meshes in well with other subplots in the story, whether it be surviving though nepotism or just trying to live a normal life. You see people early in the game have moral dilemmas when they have to do things like authorize a new technology early or have to decide on where to take their career. Adds a nice bit of background to the characters you meet along the way.


---------[END SPOILER TERRITORY]---------


All in all, this is a fantastic game. It's entertaining, has a well-written story, and has a lot of deep questions that you have to ask yourself as technology advances in today's world. Takes a bit of time to complete. It took me about 16 hours to do my first full run of it. And it was 16 hours well spent.

Final Ratings:
Story: 8/10
Need a little bit of suspension of disbelief to get the ball rolling, but once the ball does get rolling it's hard to stop it. Excellent twist that you can just straight up miss if you're not paying attention.
UI: 6/10
Hope you like dots. You'll be seeing them almost exclusively. Does contribute well to the whole computerized atmosphere of the game. Sometimes Person(s) Of Interest (POI) get lost in the southern side of the map or in places that aren't really in conventional areas (looking at you Alaska and Hawaii). Sometimes the UI overlaps itself if you click a button too early and there's dialogue or if there's a POI on the eastern side of the map in the space between the phone and what the office around you looks like. Map scrolling can be annoying, so you disable it and then it's annoying that it isn't scrolling, so you re-enable it and the scrolling gets annoying again, and then you get annoyed that you have to toggle this on and off so you just leave it one or the other an deal with it.
Music: 7/10
Can get a little repetitive with some of the longer levels, but it's pretty well written. It's electronic style fits well with the setting of the game. Musical cues also help out in some scenarios.
Commentary: 10/10
Can't go into too much detail without spoiling a lot of the game. If you don't care about spoilers, go back up and reread the section that I start by mentioning the commentary.
Overall: 8/10

Das Werk von Monomyth Games erfüllt nach meinem ursprünglichen Preoder 2016 bei weitem nicht die Erwartungen, die der damalige Trailer gestellt hatte; derselbe Trailer, der auch heute noch die Steam-Shopseite ziert.

Während Hacking-Alternativen wie [i]Hacknet[/i] oder der Klassiker [i]Uplink[/i] durch ihre im Spielverlauf hinzukommenden Tools das Spiel immer abwechlungsreicher gestalten bleibt [i]Need to Know[/i] leider immer wieder auf demselben Level, den es zu Beginn trägt. Nachdem das Assay-Tool einmal verstanden wurde, geht es anschließend nur noch darum, die dargestellten Informationen nach Schlüsselwörtern zu durchforsten, eine Aufgabe, die sich wie Kaugummi nach einem tollen Erstgeschmack in eine erst langweilige, dann zähflüssige Masse verwandelt.

Ja, [i]Need to Know[/i] hat seine spannenden Momente. Aber andere Vertreter wie [i]Orwell[/i] verpacken diese weniger linear. Das ist der zweite Schlag gegen NtK: die Geschichte. Im Gegensatz zum 2016 versprochenen Dynamik und dem Trailer bleibt das Spiel ein linearer Strang an Einzelaufgaben. Es gibt ein paar Möglichkeiten, ein anderes Ende zu erwischen, aber diese Enden führen nach einer langatmigen (und langweiligen) Animation zum Hauptmenü, wo klar darauf hingewiesen wird, dass dies nicht das beabsichtigte Ende ist. 

Damit bleibt das Spiel das Hauptfeature, nämlich die angesprochene Entscheidungsfreiheit, vollkommen schuldig: ""will you stand up for privacy, or help create an unstoppable police state?"" ist keine Frage, die wiederholt während des Spiels gestellt wird; es ist eine Frage, die sich höchstens spielende selbst stellen müssen. [spoiler]Im Spiel selbst kann diese Frage nur am Ende endgültig einmal klar beantwortet werden, in der allerletzten Entscheidung.[/spoiler]

Things I loved:
I love the challenge. It's definitely a game you have to pay attention to and make correct choices. 
There are different facets to the game that allows you to balance home and work life and develop numerous relationships. These are not optional. NPCs will just force you to talk through the phone or at work. 
Relevant story that builds onto itself and you are ultimately working towards the final goal which is to identify and locate Cloud Dweller ( i believe thats his alias) 
I like the characters. I like the story. It's very well written and done. And I love that I can be sassy with that dude at work that everyone hates. LOL 
It's a long and complex game. It was longer and has more content than I expected.
The dating app KILLS ME! Those profiles XD no wonder people are single.

Things I hated:
Some choices lead directly into game over. I ended the game multiple times unintentionally with no warning through dialogue selection. Like I was talking to the reporter/boyfriend/friend? Not sure of his purpose yet. Anyway, I accidentally said I worked at DoL and BAM! game over. Thankfully the autosave system allows you to log back in and pick up before you make that choice. But it was just so sudden and happened multiple times during different scenarios.
Everyone forces you to work for them. You have to keep selling secrets to keep your reputation up with everyone so they don't either blackmail you or fire you. It's annoying. I would rather have more choices. I don't like being two-faced and this game forces you to be that.

Overall - I still recommend it. I keep wanting to finish it and it has held my interest which few games do. However, I doubt I'll replay it. Either way - it's definitely worth the price! Buy it on sale if you can, but even $15 is still decent for this game.

You are provided a list of keywords to find in tiny documents, given basic criteria. The biggest challenge is making sure it is spelled correctly before highlighting it. I expected the game to be more investigatory, being able to follow leads, etc... this is not that kind of game.

Your character is a young adult, fresh out of college, working his/her first job. The story and the style of the dialogue was written to appeal to children. At one point, my friend in the game texts me to ask who was my high school crush. I immediately assume he is phishing for the answer to my security question to hack my password, but no. I'm overthinking. The game just does this to determine if your crush was a male or female, so it can introduce a new character into the game.

The icing on the cake for why I have to give this game a thumbs down... An anti-government group tries to extort me. There is no option to report this to the Department. I choose not to provide them any documents, because I take national security seriously, and then I lose the game. ---You must leak classified documents, or it is game over.

So much for Monomyth Games' ""will you stand up for privacy, or help create an unstoppable police state?"" ---Well, I'm forced to leak classified documents to terrorists, so I guess I don't have much choice in the matter.

Monomyth Games also writes, ""You can also resist ... by aiding underground groups ... Or, you can just use all of that juicy classified information for your own personal gain. Your call."" ---But it's not my call, because if you don't leak the classified information, it is game over.

The pitch made about the game misrepresents the actual game. I would have paid twice as much for the game if it delivered on what was promised, but as it is, I feel duped.

My general frustrations have been:
- Cluttered screen, especially when using a laptop when the screen is smaller.
- Evidence not demonstrating what the rules require but marked as missed when not chosen. (E.g. Evidence of someone telling a suspect to buy shares, when the rule says suspect must have bought shares. These are not the same thing, but the game considers them to be.)
- Moving background makes selecting the small dots difficult and no option to turn the movement off.
- You can choose incorrect evidence yet the immediate feedback says something which suggests it was in fact correct.
- Some rules weren't fully explained either in tutorial or in Peepr so got confused especially in the beginning.
- No way to re-evaluate a suspect once you've made a decision even if the day hasn't ended.
- No way to replay a day or restart unless you log out.
- Strongbox missions are sometimes very long winded and so get fed up quickly as the strongbox only seems to allow as much evidence as you can fit on the screen without scrolling. When on a 13inch macbook it fills up too quickly.

We hope to overhaul some of the game’s systems in the future to avoid some of the gameplay frustrations you mentioned. We’ve tried to correct as many issues with evidence as possible, and we’ll go through your comments on the discussion board and investigate those too.

With a couple of the other issues, there are some options in settings which might improve your experience in case you missed them. For one, you can adjust the scaling of the UI in settings so that UI elements take up less space, giving you more room to work with. You can also disable the map scrolling in settings – a few other people have said this movement makes things fiddly as you said. If you did try these settings and they didn’t do the job, please let us know and we’ll see what we can do to improve things further.

Thanks again, we’ll take all your feedback on board for future updates and releases!"

You are a government employee working for the 'Department of Liberty' where your job is to spy on/profile suspects and targets. You 'match' pertinent information (dating profile, purchases, social media posts) to mission based criteria. 

[b] Play it if you like.... [/b]
If you played and enjoyed 'Papers, Please',  or 'Orwell' then chances are you'll like this game. If you like the concepts of 1984, V for Vendetta then you'll enjoy the story. And if you really just like sorting and matching information like a nerd (like me) then you'll love the gameplay

[b] Pros [/b]
Great gameplay concept and the profiling aspects are really interesting - a lot of thought has been put into these elements and I enjoyed seeing what I'd get access to next.
Progression through the 'ranks' is done at a decent pace which keeps things fresh. Theres also some evening missions to supplement your income
Theres also a nice mix of mission types - I enjoyed the 'waves' missions where you are given more information each 'wave' in order to keep or eliminate a suspect. 
Plenty of moral ambiguity to the main characters - although some are cartoonish. 
Overall story is quite compelling and I was always eager to see how it would progress (I did a lot of 'Oh I'll just play one more mission before I switch off.....')
Again, if you're an information-sorting nerd like me you'll just love the gameplay.

[b] Cons [/b]
UI is a bit painful sometimes - you can't zoom into information (you can change the UI to either 'IN YOUR FACE' or 'far away' but neither is a good compromise). For example when I had to look at a persons job on their social network it was so tiny I could barely make it out. And again when selecting suspects from a clustered area I couldn't highlight the right profile. I think this could be improved by making better use of the screen...there is SO MUCH empty space! I like to have the mission rules up all the time to match to but I constantly have to scroll through them at the bottom of the screen even though there was a huge empty space to the left of the screen totally un-used.
Story con - like a lot of these games you're given the illusion of freedom of choice. 

[b] Overall [/b]
I played the game through in 25 hours and was fully addicted to it as I was playing it. I think it just avoided getting stale mainly because the main story always kicked in at the right moments.

I can rate this game as being recommended, so long as you're okay with a few necessary compromises. I'll explain those below.

I wanted to like this game very badly, but 5 hours in and I'm starting to see the seams and cracks that make this a less than perfect experience. I think my dissatisfaction with the gameplay comes down to one question: when you played Papers, Please, was your favorite part of the game the times where you had to squint at the IDs to see if that was a D or a P or a G? If so, you'll love this game. Everyone else will be irritated, and rightfully so.

The game is beautiful - I loved the interface and the art style. The story, at least so far, is passable and engaging, and I'm conflicted about finishing the game because of its flaws and the main reason is because I do want to see how the story resolves itself, and there's an early ""flash-forward"" that has me intrigued about what remains to be experienced.

But when the core gameplay is ""spot the difference between two letters or numbers"" or ""try to remember this ridiculously complex flow chart of rules and protocols"", it gets exhausting. It also doesn't help that for me, the game was slow and plodding at times. Opening up a menu sometimes took 2 or 3 seconds longer than you expected it to, and visual transitions sometimes slowed to a crawl. Add to that the completely boring gameplay loops and you have a recipe for boredom.

So again, to summarize... if you have fun deciding which of these three names - P Vasquez and D Vasqez and B Vaskez - matches the one in a briefing supplied to you before the stage begins, and you can suspend your disbelief that so many people would have more than one variation of the same name in their address books, then you'll like the game. Otherwise, maybe read a plot summary.

UPDATE: I stuck with the game because of the story, as I mentioned. And I was surprised to see - well into the game - that the gameplay does get mixed up in interesting ways eventually. There are still lots of repetitive tasks that seem to be there just because, at the end of the day, this is a game and not a true simulation. But there was something to the premise and the characterization and dialogue that kept me wanting to press forward even when it was monotonous.

Ohne einen konkreten Lebensplan im Sack startet ihr eine Karriere beim ""Department of Statistics."" Hierbei handelt es sich aber in Wirklichkeit um das Department of Liberty, eine Behörde, die im Nachgang eines terroristischen Anschlags ins Leben gerufen wurde um dessen Urheber, den sogenannten ""Cloud Dweller"", dingfest zu machen.

Man startet erwartungsgemäß auf der untersten Stufe der Leiter - Clearance Level 10 - mit  eingeschränkten Befugnissen und Möglichkeiten und erhält mit Fortschreiten der Karriere - respektive der Sicherheitsstufe - Zugriff auf immer mehr und vor allem immer tiefer greifende Werkzeuge zur Überwachung und Bespitzelung seiner Mitmenschen. Moralisch ist das häufig sehr ambivalent, denn tatsächlich wird man im Verlauf des Spiels die kontinuierlich ausufernden Möglichkeiten immer wieder auch zum Wohl der Menschen einsetzen. Aber man sagt nicht umsonst der Teufel sei ein Eichhörnchen und im Detail steckt er ohnehin..

Schon recht früh im Spiel erhält man die Möglichkeit auch außerhalb von Arbeitszeit und Büro auf das Programm zuzugreifen und wird um ""kleinere Gefälligkeiten"" außerhalb des Protokolls  für die Führungsebene der Behörde gebeten. Aber nicht nur dort ist man an den Daten der Bevölkerung interessiert, auch eine Aktivistengruppe und die Unterwelt zählt plötzlich zur Liste der Interessenten.  Nun muss man nicht jede Anfrage bedienen, ein grundsätzliches ""nein"" ist jedoch keine Option sofern man an Karriere (und Leben) interessiert ist. Mehr sei nun aber inhaltlich nicht verraten.

Einen nicht unähnlichen Story-Plot hat natürlich ""Orwell"" auch schon erzählt. Persönlich gefiel mir die Geschichte in Need to know aufgrund der ganzen kleinen Nebenstränge aber besser. Musikalisch ist das Spiel während einiger Missionen mitunter fantastisch unterlegt, außerhalb dessen fiel mir die Soundkulisse nicht negativ auf.

Das Spiel ist in Englisch, der Sprache sollte man dementsprechend mächtig sein. Ich würde meine eigenen Sprachkenntnisse als sehr gut bezeichnen, musste mir das ein oder andere Wort trotz allem aber erstmal übersetzen - wer seit seiner Schulzeit also kaum noch Berührungen mit der englischen Sprache hatte, wird vermutlich wenig Freude an dem Spiel haben.

Grundlegend hat mich hier eigentlich wenig sonderlich genervt oder gestört. Gegen Ende fühlt sich das Spiel dann aber doch ein bisschen nach Arbeit an. Das, was man grundsätzlich in den Missionen tut - Datensätze nach vorgegebenen Kriterien abzuklappern und zu markieren - ändert sich im Verlauf des Spiels nicht. Man wird schlicht mit immer mehr Informationen zugeballert, was man dann damit anstellt bleibt sich im Grunde immer gleich. Jedoch macht die Geschichte das mehr als wett. Einen besonders hohen Wiederspielwert sehe ich hier ( trotz verschiedener Möglichkeiten wie das Spiel enden kann)  leider nicht.

The problem is that absolutely nothing is done with the immensely intriguing premise. You get to make absolutely zero choices on your own most of the time; the few times I got to actually decide for myself, any decision that doesn't align with the institution you're working for immediately results in a non-standard game over. You spend most of your time playing an elaborate version of Papers, Please, where crucial mistakes that would logically result in a high-threat suspect escaping are just brushed over, you're penalized in score, and someone else checked your decisions and found that you were wrong, making me wonder why I'm even needed if someone else is going to do my job anyway.

You're constantly railroaded into conversations with no choice on your part on how they progress or where they end up. You have no choice in who to work with; if you refuse to work with someone for too long, they rat you out and you go game over. The story progresses with no input on your part, if you don't count one or two inconsequential lines of dialogue being different.

The developers of this game had a golden opportunity with the subject material the game deals with, and they seemingly chose to do absolutely nothing with it. If you enjoy seeping through very limited amounts of data, stick to rules religiously, and having no influence on events in the story whatsoever, while (falsely) being told you're a big difference-maker, bossed around and punished with a slap on the wrist at worst for crucial mistakes, then I guess I can recommend this game - for me, I'm done wasting my time waiting for the game to get interesting.

*Excellent story
*Nice music (2021 Revision: The music is absolutely frickin' banging. Love it.

*Glitches are usually minor (little to no glitches as of 2021)

*Low replayability value
*Gameplay is fun but repetitive (2021 Revision: It could be seen as repetitive, but it's not an issue for me.)
*Price tag is too high for what you get (2021 Revision: This is the main contributing factor towards me not recommending the game. $14.99 is just too high. A $9.99 to $11.99 price range would be great.)
*Slightly frequent but minor glitches (No longer an issue as of 2021)

The surveillance concept is very interesting, and the realism of the whole thing made it deeply disturbing for me, which is a good thing, since it kept me on the edge of my seat many times. Gathering evidence can get tricky, there are many traps left and right, but the difficulty is fair. The UI could be better, especially in later clearance levels, where the evidence can get overwhelming. I love the art style though. The story is pretty good, although its tainted by the obvious illusion of choice.


However there are some things that i dislike very much, not because they are bad themselves, but because how the game interacts with or based on it. For instance, the game saves twice a day(ingame time) and creates a gazillion save points, which would be okay, if it were possible to load any other save point beside the last.


Very mild spoilers regarding game design:

Then, you can buy stuff, this got me excited, but it actually has 0 impact on anything aside your bank account, which again, has 0 impact on anything besides the possibility to buy stuff. So its basically a closed system of uselessness. The suspicion points are only used to 5 at max i think, the other 3 seem to be decoration until the very end game, and even then they dont affect anything either.

Its a good game, has some flaws, but nothing major. Interesting setting, worth full price, any sale would be a steal.

Cons:
Fair amount of bugs needed to be fixed
Log in animation seems pointless other than extending the transition.

*** Spoilers ***
You start off with basic tasks like hunting down murderers or catching terrorists, but then a hurricane hits...

... And you're not permitted to go snooping through people's offline data, but you break the law anyway because if you can track them down, you can send FEMA their location and save some lives! So it's fine, right? Sure, some people lose a bit of privacy, but you're rescuing them from the hurricane!

And then as you rise through the ranks you get a bit more power and you start dealing with tracking down serial killers or stopping an active shooter... But then a senator doesn't like the fact that your department is ignoring people's rights to privacy and wants to shut you down...

... So you blackmail her by digging through her data and finding embarassing information to damage her career. Can't have her foolish ideals stand in the way, obstructing your quest to save lives, right?

And then a bunch of corporations give you access to their data, making your job to track down terrorists even easier, and helping you along the way in your original mission to find a man who caused a few nuclear reactors to overload in a massive terrorist attack, but they want a couple favours...

... So you start doing a bit of corporate espionage on the side, but it's fine, I'm sure, because the backroom deals are how you make progress, and no one *really* needs to keep their shopping history private, do they?

But then some of this stuff gets leaked and more politicians start rallying against it. Fools. They don't know how hard you're working to keep this country safe! They don't know how necessary it is to use this data...

... So you launch a disinformation campaign to silence them and ruin their credibility. It was their fault anyways. They threatened the department, and you needed to protect it! You're the only one standing in the way of the terrorists attacking america, so getting your hands dirty sometimes is fine if it's to protect the greater good, right?

So throughout the game you're doing these underhanded deals, blackmail and character assassinations, but it's fine because you're catching terrorists, saving lives, and generally making sure the citizens can go on with their happy little lives. Soon it pays off! You catch a terrorist who leads you to a terrorist who leads you to a whole network of them! ... but they're scattered across the globe, and many of the countries aren't too keen on sending them to the states for judgement...

... Well they stand in your way! They're harbouring enemies of the state, that's basically an act of war, right? You need to show these governments the errors of their ways... Or maybe you can't. Maybe you should arm some of the militant groups in the countries who are more friendly towards US interests... So you start distributing arms to them and help them seize power, but it's fine, right? You toppled a government and installed a few dictatorships, but you've got to help your country! They were basically asking for it anyways by hiding your enemies, right? So what if a few thousand people on the otherside of the world got killed, you're supposed to protect Americans and that's what you're going to do!

But now your powers are growing and word of your department's actions are reaching the journalists, who are writing scathing criticisms of you and turning the people against you... Well you can't have that happen, so you need to silence them, either by getting them fired or threatening them to keep quiet! Freedom of speech is just getting in the way here, this sacrifice is for the good of the nation, right? Right?!

Despite your best efforts public opinion is still slowly turning against you, and the politicians are noticing... well there's an election coming up, so you've got to make sure a politician friendly to your department gets in. Can't have the president disband the department of liberty, there's still so much work left to do! 

... So you blackmail politicians, leak incriminating documents, and funnel support towards your prefered candidate, ensuring she wins the election. You've subverted democracy but it's fine, right? You need to protect the department because it protects the nation! You're the hero of this story after all! You can't let people who don't understand get in the way, right guys? Right?! Sacrifices must be made! It's for the good of the nation! The good of us all! There's no way I could be the villain, right?! I am the hero here!!!!

But of course, it doesn't stop there. You need more power. Even when you're launching military assaults on embassies in foreign nations, even when you drone-strike your own citizens, even when you assassinate the leaders of other countries who once tried to help you but now stand in your way... 

And then you see it. You get betrayed. People want the power your department has, and your boss and other corporations are vying for the systems that now control the world. What was a perfect, all-seeing system is being used as a pawn by people for petty power plays and revenge... to further their own ideals at the expense of everyone else. You know that you need to end this. You need to stop it. The people at the top need to be brought down. A system this powerful can't remain in the hands of those who would abuse it. A system this perfect either needs to be destroyed or to remain under the control of someone who would use it for good... someone like you... And after all, you're the hero, so why not take it? It's for the good of the nation after all...

Unfortunately there's still a few problems with the game. The interface is not nearly as responsive as it should be for as simple a game as this is. Additionally when you get assignments cross-referencing between multiple suspects,... ugh... the limitations of the UI really make themselves known, and despite there being hundreds of HCI papers out there for how to build proper interfaces when comparing data, this game chooses to use none of them. As someone who worked in an Info-vis lab for a while, I can safely say that the method they chose to link data between two different suspects is one of the most annoying and tedious ways they could have possibly done it. You will audiably groan when you see the mission rules ""Link evidence when two suspects travel to the same city at the same time."". It is that bad. Fortunately these missions are few and far between, so you don't have to deal with it too often.

I also didn't like that your actions basically had no lasting effects. Any big choice either ends the game or lets you continue playing. I was really hoping that...

When you get betrayed, you would have a chance to work with the Snow Owl black-ops division instead of with Tripwire to work your way back up to the top. Maybe based on which faction you had a higher reputation with. They're black-ops anyways, with everything they do being classified and deniable, so helping you wouldn't be completely out of the question.

That aside, the game was very fun and very satisfying to play. It played around with a lot of neat ideas, and again, I really liked the story. I also liked how it showed your progression from living in a trashy apartment and working in basically a basement closet to living in a super upscale neighbourhood and leading your own division as you progress through the ranks. I highly recommend it.

Unlike Papers Please, where if you make a mistake, you can see plain as day what you did wrong and how you can improve, Need to Know is as grey as it's central themes. There are going to be choices you have to make with incomplete information. You might flag evidence that game rejects, or ignore evidence the game was expecting you to flag- and you might do so fully believing your choice was right. There is an margin of subjectivity in this game that is wonderfully refreshing. You're not going to have all the information and you have to make choices. 

For many players this might be frustrating, fully believing you made a choice and the game just disagreed with you. But that's life. Rarely does that wrong choice fully lead to a game over and the plot itself is good enough to keep me invested. 

My biggest surprises is that this title isn't more well known. It's a solid game.

And judging by the progress in ""clearance levels"" I'm in like half of the game. And it's pretty unrewarding and just really, really long. The core gameplay loop is pretty nice when you get different mission types or advancements in the story, but when you spread it over so many hours it becomes boring anyway.

I also believe there is an issue with difficulty, since there's no option to change it, and for the first like 4 or more clearance levels it is ridiculously easy (with one very hard mission thrown in every once in a while). But there's really no punishment for failure in story sense - you can absolutely botch an ""investigation"" (when you are for example looking for a suspect in waves and accidentally mark them as non-suspect in the first wave) and still succeed. Which makes sense from gameplay sense, but it's pretty immersion breaking, especially when you are still awarded with catching the criminal and such.

And coming from there - a lot of stuff in the game feels very forced. Like your ""romance"" / ""date"" or whatever just eventually appears in your apartment with no option to reject them. Sometimes you are presented with ""options"", but when you choose certain dialogues the game just ends (sometimes as if you almost won, and sometimes you just end up in jail and such) but in the end you always have to go back and choose the options the game wants you to.

And speaking of ""going back"" - there are no save slots; The game saves randomly and you can't go back. If you fuck something up because there was no tutorial or the description was misleading or you didn't get the gist of what you are looking for - tough luck, the game punishes you for that and you have to keep going forward. This issue is especially apparent with some mission types or evidence gathering that's poorly explained. One time I got everything wrong for misreading what the game wanted me to do (matching years of consecutive growth when something happens vs. matching just the last year of consecutive growth *with the thing that happened*). And there is more where that comes from.

I also encountered some minor visual bugs and UI annoyances. One of the bigger one is that ""helpers"" (people who you don't use your powers on and only help match evidence and such) are marked the same color on the map as the suspects. Well, some times. From the tutorial I think they are meant to be teal, but they're white like everyone else... Unless they are red for some reason, but only every once in a while (even in a single mission) before they are white again.

All in all I'm pretty conflicted in whether to recommend this game - [b]if you really like the core gameplay loop (go watch some videos) then sure, go for it[/b]. The annoyances are minor enough to really affect that too much. But [b]if you are like me, spending 16 hours to get into what is presumably half of the game with very repetitive gameplay and just tiny bits of story... You are better spending your time elsewhere[/b].

1) Крутой графоний. Нет, речь не про технологии, само собой. Речь про художественную составляющую. Цветовая гамма, стиль и прочее вещи, в которых понимают только художники, дизайнеры и прочие визуализаторы. Ребята отказались от пикселей и не обосрались. Инди-игры дошли до той точки, когда за это отдельную награду давать надо.
2) Музыка. Ост скачать, конечно, не захочется, но свою работу музыкальное сопровождение делает как надо.
3) Сюжет. Он хорош.  Диалоги просты в самом хорошем смысле этого слова, персонажи в меру колоритны и не опускаются до карикатуры, а история интригует и даже неплохо так играется с вашими ожиданиями.
4) Геймплей. С одной стороны, основа не меняется. Вам даётся несколько подозреваемых. Выбираете подозреваемого, вам на стол высыпается пачка собранных Министерством Свободы улик, среди них нужно найти то, что соответствует выданному заданию и принять решение. Иногда нужно глазом зацепить какую-то заранее оговорённую деталь, чтобы на стол высыпалось больше улик, или чтобы нашлось ещё подозреваемых. С другой стороны, на этой неизменной основе создаётся достаточно вариаций, чтобы совсем тоскливо не было.
5) Самое важное на мой взгляд. Атмосфера. Или цельность. Первые четыре пункта усиливают друг друга. Так, например, одна из сюжетных веток посвящена тому, чтобы повлиять на голосование в Конгрессе по биллю, который позволит родной конторе залезть ЕЩЁ глубже в данные пользователей. Что потом открывает новые типы улик. Да и само открытие новых типов улик не только разнообразит геймплей, но и двигает сюжет вперёд. Не буду совсем уж жёстко спойлерить, но если в начале ты думаешь ""о, теперь теперь в местном вотсаппе читать можно"", то под конец открытие нового типа улик оказывается не только геймплейной фичей, но и инструментом для добавления напряжения в историю (N.B. ныне это модно называть саспенс). Другие изменение в геймплее тоже зачастую обосновываются сюжетно. Ну и арт-часть с музыкой тоже участвуют в этом симбиозе.
6) Ценник. Игра выглядит и звучит дороже, чем за неё просят, как на мой взгляд.

Что может отпугнуть от покупки. Особенности и недостатки. Расположены в порядке возрастания ""отпугивания"":
1) Продолжительность. Однозначно не недостаток, особенность. Может сработать как в плюс, так и в минус. Для меня однозначно плюс. Когда-то, во времена компании на кикстартере, они обещали, что игру можно будет пройти за 8-10 часов. Но релиз задержали на год-полтора, и в процессе прохождения я понял, почему. 25 ЧАСОВ. Именно столько ушло у меня на то, чтобы пройти эту игру. Что я могу сказать, ребята малость увлеклись. И да, у вас эта цифра вряд ли будет очень сильно отличаться. По причине описанной ниже.
2) Относительная линейность. Да, реплики в диалогах выбрать дадут, но радикально история нигде не равезветвится. К примеру, помогать местным борцам за свободный интернет всё равно придётся, даже если хотелось отыграть честного строителя тоталитарного государства. Будет несколько ""досрочных"" концовок, и в конце дадут выбрать из четырёх катсцен. Изначально разработчики, похоже, планировали, но не сложилось, не потянули.
3) Интерфейс + баги. Релиз ясно показал разницу между профессиональными тестерами и доброхотами с кикстартера. Поэтому первые два месяца разработчики в авральном режиме чинили хренову кучу багов (два-три десятка патчей за два месяца с кучкой багов в каждом) и шероховатостей интерфейса. Недостаток, но ТЕПЕРЬ не такой уж и страшный, так как с большего острые углы сгладили, интерфейс подвинтили, туториалов и внутриигровых мануалов добавили. Как же хорошо я сделал, что после трёх часов игры во время релиза отложил игру в сторонку и подождал пару месяцев. Здесь будет уместно сослаться на анекдот про ""обработать напильником"".
4) ""Слегка оказуалили"". Всё-таки особенность, но ценителей может отпугнуть. Papers, please подкупала ещё и тем, что заставляла работать чётко, быстро и безошибочно, попутно роняя кал. Здесь таймера нет и практически всегда тебе дают спокойно потасовать улики и подумать. Непоправимую ошибку совершить невозможно. Арестуют всегда того, кого нужно. С тебя просто снимут несколько процентов с местного счётчика профпригодности, если укажешь не на того. Когда счётчик дойдёт до нуля - гейм-овер и увольнение. С одной стороны, это делает игру доступнее. Это очень важно и это нельзя недооценивать. С другой стороны, это слегка надламывает симбиоз между геймплеем и историей. То, что арестовывают всегда тех, кого надо, а вместо ошибочных решений счётчик профпригодности, ещё можно обосновать (над одним и тем же делом работает толпа народу, поэтому твою ошибку всегда найдут и ткнут носом). А вот отсутствие таймера в тех миссиях, где согласно сюжету нужно действовать быстро, может немножко ломать погружение. Не сильно, к счастью. Тут музыка и арт-часть выручают очень сильно.

Но это именно что особенности, и для меня они игру совсем не сломали. Та же продолжительность, скорее, пошла в плюс. То, что игра развлекает меня уже больше десяти часов, и это мы ещё до середины даже не добрались, стало как раз таки очень приятным сюпризом.",1541384333,1541384880,True,11,0,0.669576823711395264,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Had to call this out: I posted a bug that broke my game onto the devs' Trello board, and they fixed it and patched it within a day! This is the kind of awesomeness I expect from game devs. Thank you guys for your hard work :)

I think I'm about halfway through with this game. It's very clear that Monomyth Games has put in a ton of time and effort into making this game really varied and fun. That being said, here are the major issues that I have with the game so far that make me closer to a ""neutral"" recommendation:

-UI is *very* clunky. Backing out of a profile or even trying to figure out how to end your very first day are both insanely unintuitive. This is fixable, and I have no doubt Monomyth is on it.

-Some weird prompts that have game-long consequences, but you have no idea at the time. For example, (mild spoiler) [spoiler] you get a text early on in the game asking if you used to like ""Max"" or ""Serena"" from high school. No indication at all that it's romantic, or that Max is a man. If you pick Max, you are now gay for the rest of the game. [/spoiler] Not anything major at all, but just... strange. 

-Doing ""side by side"" comparisons (i.e. ""Try to find out the real profile, given these archived profiles of former criminals"") are very hard to do, mainly because of the clunky UI. You can only have 1 profile at a time, and you can only save a certain amount of evidence to compare side-by-side at once. I wish you could have 2+ profiles open, especially since a lot of cases in the game require you to do side-by-side comparisons.

Regardless of these issues, if you're willing to have some patience for these developers, I still highly recommend the game. This game is basically ""Papers, Please"" but NSA-esque. You unlock more and more tools as you go along such as: [spoiler] social media posts, call metadata, audio recordings of calls, package tracking... you name it. [/spoiler]. As I said, it's very clear the company has put a ton of time into this game and want it to be fun.",1539362391,1539911605,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You start the game by creating your character. Only gripe I have here is that there aren’t many choices as far as looks goes. It’d be nice to have more than one face type for the male and female. After that, you go through a very detailed tutorial that goes through the basics of what it will take to get you through the job you’ll be tasked with.

The game is deals with a story that’s shaped by your choices as you completed various assignments, gather evidence, flex your powers, and gather profiles. You don’t have to snoop either. As you progress through the game, you’ll have various choices that will allow you to take a stand against the very government organization you work for. A regular in-game cyber revolutionary. 

However, doing more for your boss means a higher clearance level and a higher clearance level means unlocking cooler (albeit creepier) powers, once classified information, lots more money and of course, prestige. With a higher salary, you can impress or intimidate your peers with purchases like new homes and more.

The game play is slow, but goes as fast as you want it to. I mean that in the sense that if you’re the type like me that combs through evidence and meticulously pieces together a person's profile, this will be the game for you. The main story clues are littered throughout your missions. So keep your eyes peeled. 

The music fits the narrative and the UI is clean. The developers are constantly listening and are active on the Steam Discussions. So, if there is a bug you come across, post to the Discussions and you can be sure a developer will take your problem into account. The only bug I came across was the weird save bug where my game would not save, but after a few updates, the saves are working.

I backed the game, but it's $14.99 and runs about 8-10 if you’re not rushing through it. You can definitely stretch that time out by investigating and going through the side content of which there’s a good amount of. The developers have said they plan on adding more content after the game’s ending and that you will be able to continue after your end of game save.

I recommend Need to Know: The Mass Surveillance Thriller Game. If you enjoy intrigue, espionage, and tools at your fingertips for finding out people’s secrets, then this game is for you. It’s a slow burn that works your detective skills and you can be either for or against the government. The game still has a few bugs, but the developers are quickly churning out updates and changelogs that address concerns.

I backed it because I loved the idea of the setting and the Papers, Please-style gameplay. Now that I've finished the final product I can say I got both a little more and a little less then I anticipated.

So let's start with what was good.


From what I saw this game looked like a 1984-style distopian future game. It seemed like you would play as an evil institution with no goal but to moniter what people think. As it turned out, the game made it much more complicated, in a good way, that is.

The final product had a story far more intriguing then what I expected. As it turns our, the DoL (That's Department of Liberty, the department you work for) Does infringe on the privacy of everyone, but it also stops criminals, terrorists and even helps people deal with a natural disaster at one point. On the other hand the system can also be abused. even by yourself if you so desire. Still, there is acctually a bit of an argument for the work you do in this game. I expected it to be very one-sided but the game proved me wrong.

Aside from that, watching your character change over time, getting richter and with that more morally flexible, is also a lot of fun. As you rise trough the ranks of the game the department also pulls more and more power towards it. The change from the current world to an all-monitoring police state doesn't come instantanious, but slowly, as I imagine it would in reality as well. The story took me about 40 hours to complete.

Lastly, on the list of good things are the suspects. Every one of them has a personal profile and getting and image of who they are by reading through their ever-increasing personal information is also a lot of fun. Without giving to much away, you sometimes get to know stuff about suspects that they don't even know themselves.


Now on to the stuff I expected more from.

So the gameplay looked like it would be very fun. You sort through every suspect and decide if they're dangerous or not. Now this is pretty much what you do, and it starts of being a lot of fun, but the gameplay is very slow to add new elements. It takes very long before the game becomes more challanging. Also maybe it's because I played the game quite intensively, but it got a little boring after a while. To me the gameplay started to feel like a chore near the end. I believe they should have made more variety in the missions by adding more stuff. I tended to stop playing the game when the gameplay got too dull for me. Then after a while I'd go back to it for the story.

There is also the fact that there is no timer. You can take as long as you want to finish your mission. I'm personally a little split on this fact. On the one side, I'm glad you can just take your time. I personally get quite stressed when a game gives you a timelimit and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one on this. I also like that you can just take your time and learn all about a suspect if you like. It gives you a chance to enjoy all the detailed profiles that are in the game.
On the other side I do feel like not having a time limit makes the game a little easy. Mostly at the beginning you can just do most missions flawlessly because there is no limit to how long you can take reading about a suspect.

So if you're looking for a game with a really intriguing story and are willing to put up with getting bored of the gameplay a little from time to time, I would advise getting this game. The story really is great and it totally made the game worth it for me. If you want to buy this game for the gameplay, maybe try playing the Alpha or Beta version first and see if you would like more of that. And when I say more I mean quite a lot more.",1537283705,1537283705,True,51,0,0.844615757465362549,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Then in the first playthrough I failed the Tutorial... which was surprising, I didn't think that was possible to do that. My first game was a mess, particularly due to the scaling of UI and the controls were not very clear. I failed the timed mission and wasn't really getting into the story at all because of frustration. 

Maybe a day or two later update 1.14 came through and it changed everything for the better. I can see everything in the foreground/background, stop the map from spinning the targets out of view and actually focus on the tasks. 
Having reached CL9 things started to actually matter and my character was making the shady deals I'd hoped for from the initial kickstarter description. These choices were a big part of the pull of this game for me. Do I sell Torrent users data to the DoL Agent to buy the Camera Drone, or sell instead to the underground hackers aiming to expose the DoL system? Should I help my sister with her money trouble before she will admit about it to me, what if I don't?

The game is good, better after the first hour definitely. Many people mention Papers, Please and I can see that too. Once you get past CL10 and the missions start to open up a bit it is a much better experience, I'm looking forward to breaking into CL7 very soon.

Tolles Agenten/Detektiv/Spitzel-Spiel (so genau kann man das gar nicht sagen) - Auf jeden Fall ziemlich innovativ! Ich für meinen Teil habe so ein Game noch nicht gezockt.

Kurz gesagt: wir werden unter Vortäuschung falscher Tatsachen bei einer neugeschaffenen Behörde eingestellt, die es sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat den lieben Mitbürgern mal ein wenig auf die (kriminellen) finger zu schauen.
Wir können versuchen in deren Meta-Daten nach Hinweisen auf krumme Dinger zu suchen, oder auch unseren Chefs Bescheid geben, dass wir bei der armen Wurst nichts finden können.

Im Laufe des Spieles leveln wir auf, schalten damit neue Fähigkeiten zur Bespitzelung frei und finden immer komplexere Aufgaben vor.

Fühle mich auf jeden Fall gut unterhalten und kann das nur jedem empfehlen, der mal ""was anderes"" spielen will.

Great scripting, interesting storyline, unique cartoonish style that matches the theme of the game! I have become quite engrossed with the characters and their interactions. There has been a lot of thought gone into making these characters seem realistic and this game has already touched on some unsettling aspects related to mass surveilance within the first hour of gameplay.

The game has been easy to play and I didn't fail the interview (think of Men in Black alien test)! Not sure if this is because the devs fixed the tutorial thing, but I have had no problems so far - it has all seemed pretty straight-forward to me! 

The missions have been quite fun. I'm still at clearance level 10, but I can see how this will get harder. So far I have encountered one bug, but I signed out then in again and it was fine. Obviously as more updates come through this will be less frequent, but once I was into the third mission I had already forgotten!

I think the UI is supposed to represent a work-desk and I quite like the style. I'm playing on a big screen and I know where I need to focus becuase it's pretty clear when the phone is to be used, and when other various controls are to be used. If I'm in doubt, all I've needed to do is click or hover and discover different aspects to the controls. I appreciated the artistic license used in screen composition when the dialogue is going on.

So far I have gotten a little bit impatient with Peepr, i.e. when I had to sign back in, but you can click and the dialogue goes faster. Added functionality with the skip option would be nice but so far this has been minor for me.

I did not follow the kickstarter campaign but a friend recommended it to me because I often like a game with a story to tell - and Need To Know hasn't disappointed me thus far! I'll update this review as I play more.",1536567360,1536567360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I find that the most difficult part of missions is fighting the UI to layout stuff the way I want it or to switch back and forth between profiles. The missions feel repetitive and just like I’m doing a bunch of busy work.  There are also a lot of bugs in the UI

It gives you the illusion of choice, but even if you say you don’t want to do something (such as like someone on the dating app, or add them to your codex) it does it anyway which is annoying.

A few things that would make the UI easier to use. 

1) Get rid of the map, or at least stop it from scrolling, I spend so much time trying to scroll the map back to where I the last suspect was. 
2) When using the codex at home let me dismiss profiles.  
3) Increase the detail of items in the strongbox, also let me put more stuff in it. 
4) Stop making me click a thousand times for each conversation. 
5) Get rid of the end cutscene after the mission where you talk about each individual, its not needed and just waste my time.

Need To Know is fantastic, but it had glaring flaws at launch. I don't believe that this is cause for negative reviews, especially since so many people tend to make a review, and never change it. So here we are.

The game itself is great. Fantastic story, interesting gameplay in the realm of Papers Please/Orwell (Wow bet you've never heard that one before), and compelling decisions, such as the option to weasel your way out of major financial pits by looking at the person who you'd be paying's profile. 

But it was a bit...unclear at first. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to work certain features, as when I first started playing, there had been no updates. No updates, no bug reports, nothing. I was on a 5 hour plane ride, which turned out to be the best time to learn, because I had the time and patience to do it. Once I hit ground, there was already a post about the upcoming stream of updates, bug reports, and immediate fixes and additions to the game to help with clarity.

As of posting this, there have been about 9 updates the help with clarity and bugs. Some may see this as a lack of playtesting. I see it as the devs being incredible accomodating and helpful. You can test a game for months, and still come out with bugs and issues that you didn't foresee because your testers just weren't indicative of EVERYONE playing the game. It happens. And these guys were prepared to handle any complaints. 

From the time I put the game down because of how I was stuck on the first Evidence Wave mission, to the time I picked it back up a day and a half later, major steps were taken to make even that mission in particular less brutally confusing. It's a walk in the park now, and a great introduction to the level style.

Firstly, the lack of tutorials is a glaring omission, having to try and work out what you're supposed to do can be frustrating at times.

Secondly: The interface is unresponsive and a bit of a mess. Having to cover a chunk of your screen real estate with the 'requirements' panel makes it hard to look at evidence and requirements at the same time, and having to click on your badge to start the mission with no hint whatsoever is a massive oversight.

My major bugbear however: Sometimes you miss evidence because it wasn't actually in the requirements. Other times, you flag evidence that matches the requirements, but apparently one or two specific pieces don't count. The most infuriating example of this I found was when a name was misspelled - an O had been substituted for an A, which led me to believe that it wasn't a match for what I was looking for (often homonyms or similar spellings are used to try and throw you off). In this case, it was an actual spelling mistake that had somehow made it through to the final product. Errors like this are a dealbreaker for me - It adds too much of a random element to the game, especially when the penalties for missing something or getting something wrong are so severe.

About those penalties: Get everything right from a pool of 18 and you'll get a modest boost, miss a couple of things out of a pool of 20 and you lose a ton of points. Balance is totally off, and because it's a 100% scale, knocking it out of the park early on doesn't buffer you against getting screwed by inconistent missions later on.

Bugs-wise, the only ones I've seen so far are message alerts on your phone flashing up so quick that you'll miss them if you blink, and a conversation going on whilst I was supposed to be doing something else. Nothing game-breaking yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if I found something more problematic in future.

Until the inconsistencies are fixed, I can't recommend this game. It's frustrating, as it had so much potential and I really wanted to like it.

I've reached up to CL 3 now and have played the alpha version of this game as well. It's quite a bit of fun and I'm enjoying it.  PLEASE TRY THIS GAME. THE GRIND PAYS OFF.

Pros:
Neat concept, reasonably well executed by what I understand is a fairly novice indy team.
Developers are fixing the bugs
The art style is neat  (was kind of getting tired of Indy game meaning pixelart)
The CODEX facts are kinda funny sometimes and the little easteregg info bits are a nice touch.
The story is reasonably engaging
Fun sort of puzzle-type game
Doesn't feel like papers please
Hope to see new stuff get added in future as Devs are being fairly responsive to community input
The UI is well-optimized (especially when compared to the Beta)
Soundtrack isn't bad either.
The characters do actually feel like real people.
Cons

Sometimes the rules aren't always super clear and this can lead to some serious mission screwups (however, fret not, even if you get a huge compliance ding you can either A) exit the mission before going home (this will restart it from the login screen or B) Just eat the compliance hit because usually the next mission is more forgiving it's usually a couple easy missions then a kind of tough one and then a few easier ones)

The missions can feel a little grind-y. 

There's some stuff missing that seems like it should be there (There's no stock trading system as promised, the shop only has a handfull of items to buy, no cars or anything like what was in the original trailer for this game).

The first couple CLs are a grind. I've got almost 17 hours into the game and I'm at CL 3 (you start at 10). The real fun doesn't really start until about CL 6 or so and I think that's pushing a couple people away from the game.

The Data selling thing is just kind of super annoying and stretches the gameplay out unnecessarily while adding little to the story.

Wish there were more character customization options.

It is the foremost NSA-watch-the-world-from-an-office simulator you will find as of the time of writing this review, and possibly for a long time.

You play a young man, joining a government agency. The rabbithole goes deep, and you are thrusted into a position of Orwellian surveillance, intrigue and thrill.

Starting at the bottom, you analyze simple things. Metadata, browser history and try to piece together a puzzle that is very clearly Need To Know. Given only slight glimpses of what is truly going on in this world. As you progress, you will advance in rank, getting a higher and higher level of clearance, and quickly find yourself face to face with the choice of whether or not to use your access for the good of the agency, the government, the country. the people or even yourself. 

Utilizing your powers of cyber-espionage to predict and even outright uncover your flings interests and hobbies, getting the IRS to get off your back, finding your sister/brother during an emergency or even getting out of paying your rent.

It very quickly becomes apparent what kind of power it actually is you are trusted with, and you will immediately realize why exactly it is so dangerous if left unchecked.

Don't just take it from me. Take it from the very person who knows this the best when he retweeted the game
[i]""Art imitates life.""
~Edward Snowden[/i]

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The graphic artstyle of this game is great. It's minimalistic, but still detailed in the way it is done. The whole layout gives a sense of a point-and-click adventure, and for all intents and purposes it is.

Graphically, this game is unique in the way it focuses on the mechanics and uses the art direction to enhance them. You're never distracted by what's on the screen or in your peripheral vision, yet even after many hours (I'm writing this after a 24 hour bender on this game) it never ceases to be interesting or captivating. Artistically, it's very clear it was drawn by somebody who is passionate about the game, and it shows.

[h1]Gameplay & Mechanics[/h1]
The game had a very rough start at launch, with virtually no tutorial. That has been corrected. The team behind this game are very active both on the games own Subreddit, taking into account all the reports being thrown at them and have now rolled out the fourth daily patch in a row. Where else do you see that?

The gameplay itself is good. However, I will be the first to admit that it can be un-intuitive. They have and still are taking steps to improve on this, but the game itself doesn't suffer that heavily under the previous or current issues. It plays like one would very much expect of a game of this type, yet it manages to do [i]so much[/i] with the established fundamentals of the game. Despite having pre-ordered this the moment I saw it almost half a year ago (it has been in development since 2016 and undergone many redesigns), I was honestly afraid that it would end up like most games of this caliber do, where you end up feeling the developers grasping at straws, and the game for its breath as it tries to reskin the same old mechanics and play them off as changes to the gameplay. The gameplay [b]does not change[/b], and thats strangely enough the charm and appeal.

Connect the dots as you chain together events from mere fragments of information such as e-mails, texts, social media, phone calls, browser history, bank account transcripts and decide the fate of the very people you've been spying on from behind your screen. Will you label them a threat for speaking their mind in, what they assumed to be total privacy and confidence, or will you stand up and become a whistleblower and help bring down this omniscient, omnipotent government entity?

You do unlock new abilities progressively as you pass through the ranks of this fictional quasi-NSA government agency, but they do not change the way the game plays, only improve and enhance upon it. All too often do you see games desperately trying to change its own formula throughout the span of the game, and it more often than not ends up sweeping the rug out from under themselves. You won't find that here.

I have never been much for point-and-click games. So much so that I own none except for Orwell and Need to Know. If you have played Orwell, you will without a doubt find yourself enamored with this title.

On a final note, I'll add that there is a story. Getting into it here wouldn't do it justice, and I haven't even completed the game yet. But it will draw you in. Seemingly unrelated events tie together into something larger, and as you scale the ranks of this clandestine government, denying counter-surveillance groups information (or perhaps supplying it yourself), so does the plot thicken and grow.

I would most definitely recommend this game to pretty much anybody who likes a captivating experience.

It is not without flaws, but the developers have rolled out daily fixes since release, and are obviously very passionate about this game. It's not early access, but it isn't a triple-A polished and buffed product, either. But it is getting there.",1535807869,1535808007,True,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Lack of explaining what needs to be done, twice I failed a new section to sell data as it wasn't clear that a new area existed.
Unskippable sections. This means replay is you fail if boring and repetitive. Maybe an hour or 2 of grinding to get to the same place

We’re glad that you’re a fan of the game’s concept, and are sorry that our execution initially disappointed you. Since release, we’ve made plenty of fixes and changes which we hope will allow Need to Know to more closely match your expectations.

We’ve identified impactful decisions as a key area for improvement, and have already begun to address it. As well as other bug fixes and changes so far, we’ve: 

[list]
[*]Added outcomes for home missions, based on to whom you sell your data, to add more impact to your choices,
[*]Added more dialogue branches to conversations after work missions, to react more naturally to your decisions and performance in missions.
[/list]

We’re continuing to adjust home missions (as well as other aspects of the game). In future (among other things), we intend to: 

[list]
[*]Introduce longer-term impacts for your choices during home missions, 
[*]Give you a larger range of decisions to use on different suspects,
[*]Have more of your early decisions influence events later in the game.
[/list]

Several tutorials have been added to the game, especially the earlier parts. We’re also constantly working to improve general clarity, so if players are confused about a gameplay element, we try to explain it as quickly as possible.

We can understand how being forced to repeat the same parts of the game would have been frustrating, and this shouldn’t be an issue now. If you fail a mission, you can restart at the beginning of that day, and the entire opening sequence up until the first work day is now skippable.

We’re determined to continue improving every aspect of Need to Know, but hopefully the changes we’ve made so far will encourage you to try it again. Thanks for your time, support and feedback!"

I took this statement literally, and after my first major 'choice', I was told I failed and the game returned to the menu screen.

Now don't get me wrong. I have no problem with fail conditions in games, or even perma-death consquences to actions, but this fail condition was so illogical that it is [i]exceptionally[/i] unique amongst my experiences with video games and choice-driven RPGs. It went like this:

[spoiler]Civilian privacy protection group (TripWire) asks me to sell classified data to them instead of to an internal operative within the department itself. When they ask, I refuse.

Nevermind what you tell them, the game adds them to your buyer list anyway and assigns them a relationship meter. 

When I don't sell data to them the very first time I have the opportunity, and the relationship meter reaches 0, I get this text at the game-over screen:

""TripWire became dissatisfied with your lack of assistance and notified the Department. You have been arrested for treason.""

Arrested for treason....for [i]not[/i] selling classified government data to an outside group.[/spoiler]

Choice is expressly offered in the game description, but the choices are pointless when they merely determine [i]if[/i] you can continue instead of [i]how[/i] you continue.

Couple this with a lot of bugs, lack of tutorial and cluttered, clunky UI, and I simply can't recommend it in it's current state.

Pros:
Compelling Story
Interesting Plot Development
Nice Artwork

Cons:
Unituitive & slow UI
Unclear fail conditions within the first few minutes of starting
Strange save points (It is possible to be stuck in a loop of failure as the savepoint is after a wrong decision, but before the game ends).
Settings menu is basically empty of options.
The entire map constantly pans for no reason making it hard to use.

How to fix quickly: Remove the pointless animation of game elements like buttons and evidence.
Remove the insane pauses between actions.
Give the player more time to play and less time to wait around for boring animations to finish.
Clearly explain how new rules work
PLAYTEST THE GAME A FEW TIMES!

We really appreciate you following us for so long, and apologize for the issues you encountered on release. Since then, we’ve worked tirelessly to amend them, and hopefully the current version of Need to Know is much more fulfilling.

We’ve tried to address irritations with the controls in a number of ways. For instance, UI scaling will give you much more screen room, so you can maneuver the evidence without clutter, and with far less clicking around. We’ve also fixed a couple of issues with evidence selection, and changed UI transition timings to minimize waiting.

Our wonderful community has combed through the game and helped us resolve spelling errors, and if we’re alerted to new ones, we try to deal with them immediately. 

The same is true for bugs, which we’ve largely eradicated. The annoying problems you had with the map nodes and buyer relationships should also now be resolved.

We’ve added several tutorials, particularly throughout the game’s early stages, so everything should be much clearer. They are also spread out across various missions and sequences, so you won’t be immediately bombarded with information.

We’re delighted that you enjoyed the plot, and that you took the time to share your thoughts. We’ll continue to regularly update and improve Need to Know, and hope that our changes so far go some way to justifying your faith in us."

The game still has flaws, but it's heading in the right direction.
Currently I'm CL 8, here are my fidings.
- As I see until now there is no punishment for making bad decisions, unless you kinda miss all the clues, where it can go game over. The only downside so far is to get less salary, still you can't do anything effective with the money you make other then decorating your house, or paying off the rent or helping your family.
- On the other hand I was sitting on 100% compliance for a couple of days, and i didn't get any benefit from it. Initially i thought you move through the levels according to your performance, but unfortunately it's all scripted. I understand it would be difficult, still a nice change if the devs could implement this.
- There is no pressure, no engagement. The time stops at 5pm and waits until you finish all the suspects, no matter how slow you are.
-There is no real weight of your decisions, as everything seems scripted. You get updates after each mission, what happens with the profile of the suspects. Still it's so irrelevant, probably you won't even remember what was in their profiles, and even if they appear ingame later, you won't remember that you've already seen them. (Or it might be only me) Maybe would be nice to implement a summary of DoL record for the suspects, stating your findings and the actions taken. 
-Mission 3 was a so called speedrun, still it doesn't seem any different than the other days.
-The whole game is really slow paced, feels sluggish. CL 10 and 9 is way too long for the amount of diverse actions you can do. It feels much like a grind.
- As a lot of others, I don't like the UI either. I think there are too many irrelevent staff on screen while you are in mission (Phone, ID, building, office), they all take space from the important infos, i struggle to have all the data and the rules for the mission on screen. Also I hate that the map is moving, it just gives an extra level of frustration, that i need to drag the map between profiles.

I can not recommend the game at this moment, I'm enjoying it so far. But for people less prone to just try clicking on anything until something sticks, it's too confusing to get started.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW
tl;dr buy after a few updates or a sale.

First of all I will point out I enjoyed most of this. The visuals are clean, its reasionably easy to move on and i loved the first few missions.

Unfortunatly it all goes to pot around clearance level 8 with the damn crosslink missions. They are possibly the most frustrating things I have ever met in my entire life!

The most annoying thing about them is if you click on a 'suspect' then you CANNOT click off them without making a decision as to thier guilt or innocence. This is okay for the first dozen or so missions as all the info you need to make that choice is present on that particular characters BIO. The problem with the crosslink ones is if you click on a suspect straight away you have no option of actually finding the linking info or even who the non suspects are or anything about them. This is confounded by the fact you can only store THREE pieces of infomation in your little cloud storage area. Really, you really thought that was enough? That means you cant even collate all the data you want to maybe link to! And thats if you are lucky enough to click on those people in the first place! 

Add to the fact that the game makes wierd decisions about what it thinks is suspect infomation and you are frequently told you were wrong for very arbitary reasons. Thank god the game autosaves BEFORE your mission starts and AFTER you head home so be prepared to save-scum a LOT.

Add this to the small irritations that I can usually brush off in games, How slow the menus are, the lack of space you have to fit stuff on (like the bottom tab bar that tells you what to look for), the fact everything the suspects do apparently happens at exactly the same time and date (time travel!?!), plus some others i didnt conciously notice but are nagging at me even now and i simply cannot recommend this game at this time.

Save your money, wait for updates.",1535575694,1544272300,True,0,0,0.499135464429855347,2,True,False,False,False,,1540187344.0,"Hi! We’re glad that you enjoyed Need to Know as a whole, but apologize for the more frustrating aspects. Since release, we’ve been hard at work to address various problems, and the game has come a long way in that time.

The cross-linking missions have been improved since release, and will be overhauled further. Right now, you only need to make decisions on one of the two linked suspects, and these suspects are divided into two pools: Helpers and Targets. These different suspect types are now clearly marked on the map, so you’ll have to spend far less time searching through profiles to find the right connections. 

The Strongbox capacity has been expanded from three to ten slots, and will also be more easily navigable in an upcoming update. 

Several of the other problems you mentioned have been largely resolved. Along with many other fixes and changes, we’ve: 

[list]
[*]Added a UI scaling setting, which now sets all windows much smaller as a default, and allows you to adjust the size with a slider to fit your preferences. You now have much more room to navigate the evidence, and clutter should no longer be an issue.
[*]Considerably sped up menu and gameplay animations,
[*]Addressed time and date inconsistencies in evidence.
[/list]

Thanks for your kind words regarding the visuals and early missions, as well as your honesty about the game’s issues. We'll keep working to improve the game, and we hope you have another chance to play Need to Know, and that you enjoy the updated experience far more!"

I sense the direction of this game was focused towards a giant sandbox of snooping and somewhere along its devcycle someone said, ""Hey, this isn't a game."" Then someone else said, “Okay, we have all these things the player can do. Read emails, check contacts. Put people on watchlists… How do we make this into a game?” 

The answer of course was to have the player click on links, clicking on the right ones giving  the player points, or if they got it wrong taking points away. But that was too simple, and not very fun, so they added a couple tools to click on the links in different ways and it made it better. And the Devs (who by this point knew exactly how to use each different link clicking tools) said, “Behold! Fun!” And that’s probably as far as playtesting ever got; to the point where the small team of developers had fun playing their own game. 

This is always a problem with small indies with big visions,  they didn’t have time to playtest and get substantitive player feedback. And the biggest problem this game actually has is that the player doesn't receive feedback until  they’ve already failed. Of course, you can review these mistakes after you've failed, but with all the data you need to take in, it is difficult to parse exactly what you did wrong or even how you failed in some cases.

Despite these problems,  this game has there is a good core gameplay loop and a pretty fascinating story. KtK is a competent game in many senses and does not deserved to be tossed aside as a bad game when it is simly missing satisfying feedback.

With time I imagine this game’s player feedback will be fixed. And if it ever is, I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with an interest in ""connect the dots"" style gameplay and Snowden Era cyberspying.  Right now, the only people I would recommend it to are people who not only love the genre and click on the right thing mechanics, but also have a high tolerance for failing and vigorously studying their failures and don't mind reading forum posts to figure stuff out.

you fail and have to restart, and there are in fact multiple endings.

Pros:
-Engaging storyline.
-Pretty interface, actually makes you feel like you're sitting in an office doing this stuff.
-Simple, easy to follow gameplay, most of the time.
-Lots of different actions you can take make it feel like you're doing different things even though you aren't really.
-The mission where you interrogate the guy was REALLY fun and I wish they had more of those.

Cons:
-Gameplay can be frustrating at times, particularly on a certain mission type where it's unclear which power you are meant to use to Discard/Ignore/NoMatch people, and using the wrong power makes you lose compliance.
-Minor spelling errors littered throughout the game.
-Certain parts (""post-mission missions"") can be really boring, but they are fast and even skippable.
-Certain bugs, but nothing gamebreaking. For instance, there was one case of 3 pieces of evidence having to be linked, but you can only link 2 at once.
-Clarity on which tool to use could be better, but that's more my fault on not paying attention.
-Interface clunky at times.

Put simply, the idea of a game where you move through the hierarchy of a sinister spying agency is a great one, and this game's greatest success so far in my time with it has been not only showing how quickly the power to snoop on everything and everyone can go wrong, but also, and crucially, how it can still also be a force for good. The story is I think the strongest point of the game for me, because it's depiction of the ironically named 'Department of Liberty' is not really as some cartoon villain 'Illuminati conspiracy' but as a government organisation set up in response to a great crisis which, at least initially, is comprised largely of ordinary people. Sure, some of the people you meet in the game are dubiously motivated at best, but the game reinforces in the narrative consistently that there are good people in the DoL, who genuinely believe the spying they engage in is justified and indeed, there are examples in game where the power you use does make a real difference.

I can't say much more without spoiling the hell out of the game, but suffice it to say, if story is what you want, the game offers an intriguing story, and while it may not be a Tom Clancy tale, I've found it engaging and compelling.

Likewise, the gameplay offers good challenge, requiring you to carefully dissect the data you sift through, looking not just for keywords early on but as time goes on, looking for more complicated and easily missed details, like tracing suspicious bank activity with logs of suspicious contacts, and working out if they match up or are a red herring. These shifting challenges do a reasonably good job of building on each other, with each clearance level you go through iterating on previous challenges with an extra layer of complexity, and this organic growth of difficulty is largely well-executed. But it does lead into the big problem in the game: communication.

This game has a real problem communicating with the player, and I think it's largely down to an interface that can be clunky and unintuitive. Partially this is down to bugs, like notifications on your phone not displaying so you're left staring blankly waiting for something to happen, to more egregious errors like typos in the keywords you're looking for, and contextual menus being hard to close once opened and obscuring the screen. These are all fixable issues thankfully, and while irritating, they don't for me drag the game down too much, but the sooner they are resolved, the better, and they are likely to irritate some players too much to continue.

Also, the game can be ambiguous in what the objectives of each day actually require. For instance, you might be asked to look for keywords, but the game isn't good at indicating whether you need a literal, case-sensitive match of the word, or a contextual match. For instance, if the keyword was 'Bomb Kit' and you saw a log that said 'making my own bombs in a kit', you might well flag that as suspicious, and logically, it totally is, but because the game is looking for a case-sensitive, exact match, it marks you down as wrong for it. Again, these issues are not exactly common, but they're infrequent enough to annoy, and for me are the biggest issue of all in the game, but again, can be fixed by the devs.

So in the end, I recommend this game, but I do it with an advisory: if you want a good story, with fun challenges and an engaging concept of government intelligence and the morality of that, then I highly recommend it, but make sure you go in right now knowing there are currently technical and design issues, and while these will likely be fixed, as of the time of this review they exist, and they can annoy. Hopefully you'll be like me, and able to see through the roughness to the diamond within, and enjoy the experience for what it is, not what you necessarily would like it to be.",1535560930,1535560930,True,1,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Because the game (tactics) change after reaching clearance level 8. Still the below criticizm is applied, but for a game with this pricetag it doesn't to that bad.

So i was hyped for this game from the start & a early kickstarter funder, but it feels like a disappointment for now.
I specially played this game for a few hours to see if it just has a slow start. But sadly it doesn't only have a slow start.. It keeps slow (might even call it boring). 
Only positive note i have at this moment is, that the story is well written and has some noticable real life scenarios.

Another bad thing (in my opinion) is the time it takes to unlock new ablilities. This only happens when you reach a new/higer clearence level. 
I have more then 4 hours into the game. And i only just unlocked clearance level 8 and therby new abilities. This takes to long in my opinion..

The game has the ""beta"" feel all over itself. Feels cluncky, UI is horrible to work with & windows get blocked constantly. Rules window should be movable at least.
Crashes at weird moments and nothings happening at the same point after restarting the game.

Also the evidence that needs to be collected, can be very conflicting. The rules states that something needs to be collected. But it it isn't directly linked to your suspect but a contact. The game states that you made a wrong choice.

Just as many i was hoping for a ""Papers, Please"" like gameplay and challenge, but than in a intelligence styled jacket.
This game is disappointing on all fonts:
- Gets boring soon, game also needs some kind of speed mode.
- Sometimes very unclear/conflicting what kind of evidence needs to be collected.
- You get new ways to check on people but no new tools to use, but only whit new clearance levels.
- Just point and click/memory playstyle. I miss some sort of typing involved (for example keyboard shortcuts), playing as an analist.
- Some times theres logic in ""linking"" people or suspects together early on. You just/simply can't... This is only possible when the game tells you to.
- (to hide spoilers) You do the same thing anywere.
- Buying stuff.. Ehh, whats the use of this? Whats the use of making money in this game anyway. I don't even have to pay rent.. 
- Weird saving structure. Log out before ""End Session"" aaaand start all over again with the same mission.
- When you ""start over"" a session by quitting the game. The location and names of the suspects is the same every time & also their logs.
- Crashes mid game (had three in less than 4 hours of gameplay).

It's just constantly doing the same thing.. Over and over.
This is the thing with most games and isn't that big of an issue. 

The issue with this game is, that there isn't enough variation in ""what"" to do. 
There is just to little to do to keep it interesting. It's way too late in the game & taking way too long to get there, if you even get there you're interest in this game is most likely already gone.

Still putting all the negative points aside. For their first (major) game, it's actually quite good.

I love the premise, I love the feeling of detective work and secret-selling, and the narrative for me was more interesting and less stressful than Papers Please, which is easily the game it most resembles.

Unfortunately, the game is buggy, and on top of that, the process of identifying evidence or tying pieces together is so painfully unintuitive that it kills the enjoyment.  On top of that, the pace is absolutely glacial.  Assuming the idea is that you are working your way up from a rookie at the alternate universe NSA to ultimate shadow broker, I expected to be quite a bit further than 3 levels in at the six hour mark.   How much of that time was eaten up by really pointless missions that don't seem to tie into the narrative or plot?   Quite a bit.

And then there's the penalty for failure.  Woe unto the one that misunderstands the instructions for how to handle your pieces of evidence.   If you don't figure it out, you can lose a metric crap-ton of ""compliance"", which is the game's meter for how well you're doing.   I went from 97% compliance to 33% in a single mission.  It doesn't really give you much partial credit - if you recognize something is off about a person, but you don't mark it exactly correctly, it's nearly as bad as missing the clue entirely.   

I think that's what's really broken about this game at the end.  The part where you know in your gut when someone is clearly a problem or dangerous, but the game doesn't seem to recognize your efforts and punishes you for trying.

As a Monomyth developer posted below this review, this game has changed a lot since it's release and since I wrote this review. While I do not currently have time to give the game another shot due to classes, keep in mind that the review below is not an accurate reflection of the current version of Need to Know.
[/quote]

So I tried to like this game, I really did, and I was one of the ones who followed the hype from the first trailer release in the Kickstarter campaign. I really looked forward to the Papers, Please -eqsue surveillance game that the trailers advertised. Holding out to release (remember, no pre-orders!), however, revealed some key flaws that the game has.

[h1]Lack of Tutorial[/h1]
The lack of a tutorial is my primary issue with Need to Know. With almost zero instruction given, the player has no clue on how to progress, how to use the different tools provided in-game, and what distinguishes a subject between a ""safe"" individual and a threat. Players are expected to know beforehand what all the tools do and how to use them effectively, and  with the game not arming the players with that knowledge, I and many others were left confused as to what to do almost constantly.

[h1]User Interface[/h1]
The current user interface is extremely similar to the user interface that was advertised throughout the developer cycle. While it seems to be extremely sleek and inviting, don't let its looks fool you. The UI was another primary issue with Need to Know. In practice, the UI was sluggish and huge on-screen, with every single element in each window being blown up unnecessarily. Everything except any back or close indicators, which took minutes to find on several occasions. In the beginning of the game, it even took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to begin the first mission! 

[h1]Final Evidence is not consistent with Evidence Requirements[/h1]
At the beginning of each mission, you are given specific key evidence to look out for while analyzing individuals. Several times, the evidence the game wanted me to find were inconsistent with the requirements it gave me. This meant I often “missed” evidence which was never actually listed as a requirement.

[h1]Inconsistent Results after Missions[/h1]
As part of the story, you need to build up your agency's trust in you by successfully analyzing, identifying key elements a suspect might exhibit, and eventually classifying the subject as safe or a threat. These trust points given, however, were often inconsistent. Successfully classify and identify all pieces of evidence in a mission? Have 15 trust points! Missed one piece of evidence? There goes 30 points!

[h1]Inconsistent Dialogue[/h1]
Have a bad day and lose a lot of trust points? Doesn't matter, your boss will let you know what a great job you did today!

[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]
While many people (such as myself) disregard the bug warnings in games and play them anyway only to still have a positive experience, let me tell you that it is not the case with this game. Throughout playing, I experienced numerous bugs, some of which were game breaking or needed a restart. For example, after losing in the prologue (why is that even possible?) and making a new profile the game glitched out and showed two different points in the story, progressing through them simultaneously, requiring a full restart of the game and clearing out the old profile and creating a new profile. Notifications on your in-game phone often appear and disappear in under a second, not giving you enough time to read what it says. You can’t even change the wallpaper.

[h1]In Conclusion[/h1]
In its current state, I cannot recommend Need to Know. The game has vital problems that it needs to solve, problems so important that it makes you wonder if Monomyth Games even play-tested all the features in-game before the final release, in despite of several beta versions being released to Kickstarter backers in the previous months. The game feels like a rushed beta version, even though the game was delayed by a month. Should Monomyth Games fix these key issues, I would gladly re-purchase the game for another shot at Need to Know.",1535506613,1541276379,False,66,0,0.762777984142303467,7,True,False,False,False,,1540185990.0,"Hi, we’re glad you followed Need to Know so closely, and are sorry that it disappointed you upon release. We appreciated your thorough, clear review, and have since worked hard to address many of the issues you raised.

[h1]Lack of Tutorial[/h1]
Tutorials are now in place for key points in the game, particularly in the opening sequences. Gameplay is now also more clearly directed, and will continue to improve.

[h1]User Interface[/h1]
Our UI scaling now sets all windows much smaller as a default, and allows you to adjust the size with a slider to fit your preferences, which helps to minimize visual clutter. We can see how the interface was initially confusing, but with the new tutorials and more visual guidance, you should find that this issue has been heavily remedied.

[h1]Final Evidence is not consistent with Evidence Requirements[/h1]
Thanks to our helpful, enthusiastic community, we’ve corrected the vast majority of these inconsistencies. Although some may still be lurking around, they should now be negligible, and we’re working to root them out as soon as they’re reported. 

[h1]Inconsistent Results after Missions[/h1]
Although the Department of Liberty is an unforgiving organization that does not tolerate mistakes, we understand that the point deductions may have been harsh (particularly when coupled with unclear gameplay). We’ve rebalanced the Compliance system, so that you won’t be punished as heavily for errors. 

[h1]Inconsistent Dialogue[/h1]
We agree that this issue would have been immersion-breaking! Since release, we’ve expanded dialogue branches in most post-mission conversations so that NPCs now react more accurately to your performance. Your boss will no longer pat you on the back for a terrible work performance. 

[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]
We have fixed major, game-breaking bugs and addressed a host of minor issues that made the experience far more burdensome than it needed to be. The glitches you experienced should now be long-gone, and you can no longer be booted from the Department after the opening interview sequence. Though it was possible to re-load the game at this point, this was not clear enough, resulting in some players replaying the entire intro, which would have been irritating.
Also, you can change your phone wallpaper, and we’ll soon be adding a much larger range!

You and other reviewers are right in pointing out the game’s flaws on release, and we appreciate that you managed to be constructively critical without any malice. Since launch though, we’ve worked very hard to correct these problems, and in the future, will continue to make the game richer and more complex. For example, we’re currently implementing financial pressures, and more choice-based outcomes for home missions.

If you do get a chance to try the game again, and you encounter any issues you'd like to let us know about, you can head over to the Steam discussions or our Trello board [url=https://trello.com/b/ABG1gSZb/need-to-know-bugs-feature-requests]here[/url], and we'll fix it as soon as we can!

We really hope you give Need to Know another shot, and that your second experience is much more closely aligned with your expectations. Thanks for your time!"

I have only just started playing it but am already overwhelmed with the bugs and poor interface design issues. 
It gives you simple tasks yet the means to interact with the displays is plagued with problems both in its design and what appear to be bugs.

Just listing out the issues I ran into I can think of:
- Depending on your resolution important parts of the screen will be cut off and unreadable
- Phone rang after my first day and I was simply unable to click the answer button.
- Rules window becomes stuck in the up position covering up all other windows. Had to restart the mission to clear that up.
- Trying to change your tool to another tool causes windows to close that you wanted to use the tool to click on
- Rules window is very often covered up by the window of evidence you are trying to flag making it impossible to read the rules to choose the right one
- Clipboard window often does the same thing covering up things that you wanted to click on.
- No indication on the screen to guide you as to how to actually start your mission. Button to start work is the same button to view your overall status. Extremely confusing and no good feedback as to the current state.
- Clicking on the pyramid helper opens up a series of help tips but the window doesnt pop up making it impossible to scroll or view
- Rules window, when minimized, allows you to scroll but its such a small sliver its pointless. Why not just make this thing either minimized or full sized, why let it function at all in its minimized form other than to click on it and maximize it?

Both of which were nice examples of the software that worked fairly nice but were obviously just beta software.

The main issue with this game as it stands is it is still that - beta. It's as if absolutely no QA was done to the game before release. No matter how much I dislike ""early access"" or beta title on Steam, I find it surprising Monomyth didn't go this route or at least run a short closed beta to get input from users on functionality and bugs.

As it stands the current version is pretty much just the beta with more content and more bugs. The game is riddled with tiny bugs and typos that would have been found by a normal group of testers. It's also riddled with usability issues.

[list]
[*] The lack of a clear tutorial is confusing - and piecing together how you're supposed to go about things using peepr is a PITA.
[*] The UI is stale and unintuitive. Very few of the buttons in the UI you need to press are actually animated - with no indication you've moused over them or that they are a button.
[*] Another UI issue - no skip buttons? No way to skip over cutscenes.
[*] Lack of customization - why even offer a screen to customize your character when you've got 3 combinations?
[/list]

Overall with those usability issues and the current bugs, I'm going to have to say I can't recommend this.

On your first day of ""work"" (after getting hired) the mission briefing doesn't really explain specifically what you need to do.  I played the alpha and beta of this game and I can tell you that they actually did a better job of explaining this, not sure why they altered it.  Also they changed the assignment ""rules"" screen which used to be divided between suspicious people and suspicious data, now it just lists everything in a single list.  I personally liked it the old way but that may just be a subjective thing.

For those who are confused here are a few pointers to get you started:

1. On each suspects profile open their evidence which will be their web browsing history and/or their phone records.

2. If you find one of the names or websites in the assignment rules in those sections you need to:
   a) right click and select blacksheep tool
   b) select the relevant data (name or website)
   c) select the rule it relates to in the rules page
   d) mark the suspect as a ""Threat"" using the lightning (powers) button

3. If you find no evidence matching the rules, just click the powers button and select ""Safe"".

I don't know why the devs thought it would be a good idea to leave the above (or similar) instructions out of their game as it is bound to put people off, so yeah, I can understand some of the negatives so far.  But personally, I'm marking this as ""recommended"" because I'm enjoying it and I can say from playing the beta that the story gets more interesting as you get further into it.

I still can't recommend the game ( and i really wanted it to be a game i recommended)

First , this game still has a problem with the design , it is repetetive and most of the time , all you want to do is just be done with the mission so you can advance the story
When you do have a mission you like you don't actually get to do what you want with the information ( maybe at clearance level 1 , im one clearence level away )
There is a certain set of right or wrong answers , its a game about finding the correct answers not about decision making

Second , This game is still full of confusing instructions and data presentation
I have been playing games on computers for the past 28 years and i have never felt so confused like i did with the instructions on some of this levels 

Their QA department ( If they have one ) has really dropped the ball here , along with the designer

In short

Good idea , not a bad story
Poorly executed in terms of gameplay and intrest
Very repetitive
Does not allow you real decision making , just a game about matching what you see to what is expected in advance and marking it

I definitely would recommend this game to players that are more patient.

For e.g. - I had a research task to complete at home which I missed for two entire days, decreasing my in-game rating with my contact, and didn't realise it until after. 

While there are a few other minor glitches in this game, I think it has potential (as it's similar to the likes of the 'Orwell' games - side note: the Orwell series are one of my top favourite games till date) and for the price it's fun and there's lots of gameplay. I haven't reached the higher levels as yet but it's something i'm looking forward to play through.

There are 4 tools that you can use, and if I'm honest, I'm not sure really what any of them do or when is the correct time to use them. The points explaining them, after I found them, didn't offer much help. 

The missions, too, whilst well written and pretty self-explanitory, don't offer much in the way of what tools to use, for instance.

First, I was extremely hyped up. After playing demo for some time my enthusiasm went down a bit, mainly because of lack of real, engaging gameplay, very clunky interface and lack of clarity in every screen in the game. Still, game looked beautiful with it's cartoon style and many cool symbols, graphics, and so. And now finally it's out. While I still think that this kind of a game has great potential (UPLINK, anyone?), unfortunately Need to Know is very hard to enjoy, despite it's visual charm. 

First, there are so many small, but annoying things, like unresponsivness or lack of skip button during certain screens. There's a lot of it in this game, and I wonder why those things weren't eliminated during long developement time. 

Second, despite the fact that the game looks great, the whole interface is a confusing mess. It is so hard to figure out what you are supposed to do, there are so many buttons and aditional cards around and no tutorial. It is so confusing, since so much is just randomly generated and serves just as an extra, cause...

Third. The gameplay. It is actually a memory clicking game (Think of it as a very flawed ""Papers Please""). Granted, I played for an hour or two, but it gets repetitive already, and it doesn't feel real at all. There is no real suspense, just randomly generated trivia facts and phrases you have to find as fast as you can. It's no fun, at least for me. No excitement, no immersion. 

I'm sure the game gets more complex after a while: there is shop app in your phone and some stuff to buy, there are new ""powers"" that you unlock while advancing in the ranks of the agency, but everything feels undeveloped, almost like a free mobile game. And that's a shame, cause the visual style is (again) amazing, and the story is at least ok. So, maybe in Need To Know 2? 

Pros:
- Cool visual style
- Exciting topic 
- Modernately interesting story 

Cons:
- TERRIBLE interface
- Repetitive and almost non-existent gameplay
- Really annoying mechanics choices (No skip button? C'mon...)
