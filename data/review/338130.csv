These aren't real PC games... it's a cash grab from greedy mobile devs.

The games are all identical, just reskins of the same turn based strategy game template.  Because the games are identical, they suffer from the same defects which we'll get into... but it's worth summing it up... these mobile apps are just incredibly dumbed down screen tapper strategy games.  Tap your troops, tap the territory to attack... that's basically all you get, but then what do you expect from a mobile app, when this is Steam, for PC games?

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

One of the games is only in Russian and doesn't have any English translation that I could find... but don't worry, the games are so shallow, you don't need to be able to read to play them.  And that's a problem in itself. 

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure they are running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee these mobile apps will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

These mobile apps feature mostly static, barely animated 2D images, the kind of thing you expect to see in browser/flash games.  While the artwork itself, while mediocre, might be considered passable, the visual presentation here is negligible, it might as well be a slideshow or a Youtube video.  Pac-Man, Space Invaders and Asteroids had more advanced animation and visuals going on than these mobile apps do.

The controls can't be customised because the mobile apps have such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Because these are mobile apps, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile apps were designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  These mobile apps are deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push these mobile apps below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Strategy & Tactics: Wargame Collection didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the mobile apps, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the mobile app didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for completing any mission in any of the three mobile apps, trivial to get, but less than 21 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the mobile app collection.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in these mobile apps.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this mobile app collection was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the mobile apps.  But this only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the mobile app collection... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the mobile app collection just has a couple of players every week running up one of the mobile apps and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many mobile apps like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $10 USD, on app stores, it's free. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a premium for a free mobile app just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  For comparison, the $10 asking price for this game could get you games like ""Disco Elysium"", ""Deep Rock Galactic"" or any number of vastly superior Total War games.  Quality, professionally made games like those are frequently on sale cheaper than this.  

To put it a different way, if you really, really want to play this, go buy Deep Rock Galactic, then play this for free on your iPhone.  See why it's so important not to fall for these mobile app scams?  Buying this would be a complete waste of money. 

Because these can be played free elsewhere, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend them.

Just who do they think we are?

Ich kann dieses Spiele-Bundle empfehlen, allerdings bezieht sich die Empfehlung hauptsächlich auf das Sandbox-Spiel im WW2-Setting. Das erste ist historisch angehaucht, wobei die Szenarien in ihrem Ablauf nichts mit dem historischen Verlauf zu tun haben werden. Das letzte ist ein Mittelalter-Setting, das ebenfalls nur kleine Ausschnitte und Szenarien zeigt, wobei die Möglichkeiten sehr begrenzt bleiben.

Aber zurück zur eigentlichen Empfehlung:
Das Sandbox-Spiel bietet zwei größere Karten (Europa und Asien), lässt zwischen den Nationen der Epoche wählen und ist von seinem Grundprinzip mit dem Brettspiel Risiko vergleichbar, wenngleich es etwas komplexer ist. Gesammelte Produktionspunkte lassen sich in neue Einheiten oder Technologien investieren. Mit deren Hilfe versucht man das Spielfeld im Namen seiner Nation zu erobern. Es gibt unterschiedliche Einheitentypen, die sich beispielsweise in ihrer Bewegungsreichweite unterscheiden. Beachtenswert ist die Anzeige der Kampfbereitschaft einer Einheit, sodass man immerhin überlegen muss, ob sich ein ANgriff gerade lohnt oder ob ein Feind aus einem Gegenangriff dann nicht sogar mehr Profit ziehen kann. Hauptsächlich entscheidet aber eben doch die Größe der eigenen Armee über Sieg und Niederlage. Was die Komplexität angeht, hat das Spiel offensichtliche Grenzen schnell erreicht. Dadurch ist es aber sehr einsteigerfreundlich und im Mulitplayer durch Kommunikation und Bündnisse auch unterhaltsam. Wer alleine spielt, bekommt immerhin eine Auswahl unterschiedlicher Siegbedingungen, die Schwierigkeit und Länge des Spiels bestimmen.",1705502665,1705502665,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Well now for a more accurate feed back

⇨ As I said before, i really love this kind of games, and this was a very good surprise, the game is not 
AAA game graphics but it´s good for the eyes. ( forget about the music, it´s kind annoing once you came a lot, because it´s very repetitive

I  personally loved the one in the midle (sandbox) it´s a very accurate world war II batle 

⇨ I ´ve played with USA to destroy URSS ) ✔️- with aliances

⇨ Played my Portugal ( conquer 100 territories) ✔️ this was not an easy one  ( even so playing with no aliances was the best decicion here)

⇨ and one of the most chalenging mission I´ve had, was to play with German boy that was though
almost everyone around me atack me lol ( I´m not sure but this single mission alone took me ~20h) ✔️

but sadly the Medieval wars is unplayable... the mouse can´t reach the buttons and there´s nothing we can do about it, even if you get with the mouse to the corner he reaches the button to play, but once in the game nothing you can do again

i´m really sad I can´t play the medieval game but loved the other 2

They dont need to be much, they just need to do what they set out to do well. This game doesnt do that.

For starters, it was designed for phones, so the interface isnt intuitive or pleasant for a PC player. You can also give order to one unit at a time, which can be a huge drag.
Gameplay revolves around attacking tiles and ordering reinforcements, basically. Its fine, but you dont know how combat is calculated and you dont know your unit stats. Without it you dont know if youre forces are good or bad.
There are scenarios with different objectives. They are usually part of campaigns. If you complete these scenarios throughout a campaign you can get upgrades for troops, but these are bare bones.

Its not really worth the time, there is better stuff out there.

Pros: Easy to learn the basics and the UI that is there is also good in terms of understanding what does what. A fun map painter to an extent. good starting army on the sandbox mode

Cons: Doesn't give the player any valuable information. Poor Sound Quality.

In fact, I found one of the games in this collection as a mobile game for my phone first (the WW2 Sandbox one) and it was pretty fun, but had all the ads and in-app-purchases that you see with mobile games. I definitely suggest that as a mobile game because it was free and pretty in-depth compared to most strategy games on mobile. On computer, meh. It was incredibly cheap, and even cheaper on sale, which was the main reason I bothered getting it. The deal was pretty good, because this is a 3-pack of games. They all play basically the same, so once you learn one, you learn all of them. As far as strategy games go, it's simple compared to other games like it, and the mechanics become second nature within half an hour to an hour. The tutorials are pretty trashy, and don't cover anything more complicated than basic movement and attacking, which means it's up to you to really explore how combat and movement work. The AI is actually pretty good, but can be predicted and outsmarted with some practice. So why am I recommending this? This may not be a great game, but it's cheap and simple. If you're new to strategy games, or just enjoy casually playing them and don't like diving heavily into grand-strategy games, this is a good choice for you. There's also a mobile version, which I suggest for anyone. If you really like the complicated and in-depth mechanics that you find in games like Hearts of Iron and Victoria 2, though, stay away from this game on PC. There's quite a bit of content, but you'll get bored pretty fast, and personally I would take Hearts of Iron IV any day over these 3 games.",1574206082,1574206082,True,2,0,0.530003786087036133,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Na svém telefonu jsem ve všech hrách strávil docela dost času a rozhodně na telefonu patří mezi moje top hry. Díky tomu vím, že je tu pár ... rozdílů o proti původním hrám - ten hlavní je asi ten, že hry nejsou samostatné, ale spouští se přes hlavní aplikaci. Další zásadní rozdíl je ten, že některé věci, které tu jsou placené jsou na mobil zdarma (dlc Strategy & Tactics: Wargame Collection - Vikings! třeba) a naopak (v Sandbox jsou odemčeny všechny státy i Asie). Jediný rozdíl oproti verzi na mobil, který je přímo ve hře patrný je minimapa(vzhledem k velikosti většiny map je to asi zbytečné...). Tohle byly spíše drobnosti, jenž nemají na to jak se hra hraje žádný přímý efekt, takže ted k tomu jak se to hraje: Je to opravdu hodně jednoduchá strategie stylu ty jdi jsem ty jsem a koupím tohle, většina úrovní je docela jednoduchá (pokud chcete vážně těžké úrovně, tak doporučuji kampan za USA v dlc SSSR vs USA - hlavně osvobození středozápadu od SSSR je výzva). Mapa je zhruba na úrovni HOI2, někdy vypadá až podezdřele stejně jako v HOI2, ale jenom rozlohou - provincie nelze nijak upravovat, nebo v nich něco stavět (pouze v průmyslových provinciích můžete stavět nové jednotky). Dále tu jsou i technologie, které můžete zkoumat, ale klidně můžete hru dohrát bez toho, aby jste nějakou za body kupovali.
Závěrem: Jedná se o ideální hry na odpočinek od složitějších her, nebo strategie se kterými mohou začít noví hráči strategií (podle mého názoru by to v pohodě zvládlo i dítě mladší 10 let).

Avete presente RisiKo? Bene, adesso immaginate di poter scegliere singolarmente che classi di divisioni impiegare nella vostra guerra, aggiungete un po' di progressi di ricerca tecnologica ed il gioco è fatto.
Questo gioco non è limitato a farvi combattere in modo illogico e a farvi mandare a morire milioni di soldati. Infatti, grazie alle vostre direttive, la vostra armata potrà rompere le linee nemiche con combinazioni strategiche pressoché infinite, utilizzando diversi tipi di divisioni combinabili tra terrestri (sia di fanteria che di artiglieria), marittime (sia di superficie che di profondità) e aeree.
Queste divisioni saranno acquisibili tramite il denaro che raccoglierete dalle vostre province, le quali potranno avere più o meno potere di guadagno.
Ogni divisione ha una salute visibile attraverso una barra colorata al di sotto del simbolo, se la barra è verde, la divisione o il corpo d'armata (più divisioni insieme), la sua salute è in ottime condizioni, man mano che cala verso il rosso la sua salute diminuisce, questo significa che il vostro ""corpo"" va ritirato e lasciato a riposare nelle retrovie per qualche turno, in modo tale da risanarlo.
Non dimenticatevi infine di progredire nella ricerca tecnologica militare, la quale vi consentirà di ottenere nuove skills per le vostre divisioni, non vorrete mandarli a combattere la seconda guerra mondiale con fucili ""di fango e m***a"", vero?
Purtroppo, però, di qualche modifichina necessita anche questo titolo, dato che il livello del volume non è modificabile (si può solamente attivare o disattivare).

Dear Devs, thank you for creating a challenging WW2 wargame with fine touches. Good single player AI cpu opponent. Great free missions. Both war in Europe, and battles in Pacific theater.

Drei Spiele bekommt ihr hier über ein Startfenster.
Als Set erschienen 2016. Total überholtes Review.
Es folgt eine kurze Beschreibung der drei Titel.

Strategy & Tactics: WW II;
Übernimm das Kommando über deutsche, sowjetische oder alliierte Armeen und führe deine Männer in drei anspruchsvollen Story basierten Kampagnen zum Sieg. Dutzende Karten für den Gefechtsmodus und sieben historische Szenario Karten.
Sowohl Spieler, die gerne stundenlang auf riesigen Karten spielen, als auch Liebhaber von kurzen Konflikten kommen in den szenariobasierten Einzelspieler-Gefechte voll auf ihre Kosten.

WW2: Sandbox. Strategy & Tactics;
28 zur Wahl stehenden Länder.
Du kannst die historischen politischen Allianzen beibehalten und als Befehlshaber über die Armee der UdSSR zusammen mit den Westmächten Deutschland besiegen, oder du deaktivierst die Allianzen und feierst deinen Sieg auf den Trümmern Londons.
Zufällig stattfindende Ereignisse wie Guerilla-Bewegungen, Landeoperationen, freiwillige Rückzüge usw. erhöhen den Wiederspielwert. Europakarte mit über 500 Gebieten und
39 spielbare Länder.

Diese beiden Spiele benutzen die gleiche Oberfläche und sind auch sonnst gleich. Du Spielst auf einer zerknitterten großformatige Landkarte die in sehr vielen Gebieten und Regionen eingeteilt ist und zudem stark eingefärbt wurde. Dies ist zwar nicht eben gerade hüpsch aber sehr gut einsehbar und leicht verständlich. Vor allem für Neulinge die nicht erst ein Lehrgang machen wollen um zu verstehen was für Einheiten sie haben, sind die Abbildungen sehr einfach gehalten. Das Gameplay ist ebenso einfach gestaltet. Ich könnte jetzt meckern weil ja alles ""so"" Primitiv gestaltet ist, tue ich aber nicht. Wer sich erst einmal eingespielt hat wird bemerken das dies durchaus von Vorteil ist für all diejenigen die es nur mal kurz zwischendurch spielen wollen oder können.

In Medieval Wars: Strategy & Tactics;
Drei historische Kampagnen, die Heere Englands, Frankreichs und der Kreuzzügler. Ziehe in die Schlacht zu zeiten des 9. bis zum 15. Jahrhundert. Dank den Szenario basierten Karten kannst du für die Rus an den Schlachten teilnehmen, unter dem Banner Karls des Großen die Sarazenen aufhalten und den Aufstand der Hussiten entfachen. Dazu kommen noch vier verschiedene historische Szenarien mit 21 Arten von Truppen.
Auch dieses Spiel nutzt das Gameplay der beiden anderen, hat aber eine deutlich schönere Karte.

Allgemeine Empfehlung für Neulinge. Persönliche Meinung Negativ.

Strategy & Tactics: Wargame Collection
You get three games here via a start window.
Released as a set 2016. Totally overhauled review.
Below is a brief description of the three titles.

Strategy & Tactics: WW II;
Take command of German, Soviet or Allied armies and lead your men to victory in three challenging story-based campaigns. Dozens of combat mode maps and seven historical scenario maps.
Both players who like to play for hours on giant maps, as well as lovers of short conflicts come in the scenario-based single player battles fully at their expense.

WW2: Sandbox. Strategy & Tactics;
28 countries available for election.
You can maintain the historic political alliances and defeat Germany as commander of the USSR army along with the Western powers, or you can disable the alliances and celebrate your victory on the rubble of London.
Random events such as guerilla movements, land operations, voluntary retreats, etc. increase the replay value. Europe map with over 500 areas and
39 playable countries.

These two games use the same interface and are the same as the sun. You play on a crumpled large-format map that is divided into many areas and regions and has also been heavily colored. This is not exactly nice but very well visible and easy to understand. Especially for newcomers who do not want to do a course to understand what units they have, the pictures are very simple. The gameplay is just as simple gestalltet. I could complain now because everything is ""so"" primitive designed, but I do not. Anyone who has recorded once will notice that this is quite beneficial for those who just want to play it in between times or can.

In Medieval Wars: Strategy & Tactics;
Three historic campaigns, the armies of England, France and the crusaders. Go to battle in the 9th to 15th century. Thanks to the scenario-based maps, you can take part in the battles for the Rus, stop the Saracens under the banner of Charlemagne, and unleash the Hussite rebellion. There are also four different historical scenarios with 21 types of troops.
Also this game uses the gameplay of the other two, but has a much nicer card.

General recommendation for newcomers. Personal opinion Negative.

C'est peut-être sympa en multi, moi je joue en solo et je ne me suis pas amusé.

Les scénarios que j'ai joués étaient pour la plupart trés déséquilibrés quantitativement, qualitativement et  territorialement. Avec en plus une limite de tour qui ne laisse pas vraiment le temps de s'organiser. Sachant qu'une pile encerclée (y compris par des alliées vu que chaque région ne peut recevoir que 12 unités) va presqu'à coup sur se rendre, certains scénarios médiévaux me paraissent totalement hors de ma portée vu l'infériorité numérique et la distance aux objectifs de départ. C'est moins flagrant pour la partie WWII, mais ma principale reflexion sur ce jeu consistait à prévoir des trous dans mes lignes. Ca ne m'éclate pas.

Once the limit number of turms has occurred the entire campaign is over. 

The strict limited number of moves to win/lose is completely obsurd and kills all motivation to play this otherwise fun game. For example, the first ""battle"" is actually a campaign and requires the taking of Jerusalem (starting just south of what is Istanbul, Turkey today. The basic timing problem is your (Crusader forces) most forward unit is not only weakest but it takes every single move allowed just to get there. That means not only does that one unit have to survive but it has to conquer 14 provinces inbetween without fail and without any reinforcements. Until that time limit is removed I cannot recommend the game. Only calvary can move ""two spaces"" per turn but getting a strong enough calvary force takes more than half the game which negates the ""two province"" move advantage. I keep trying and getting better at it. I think I am beginning to enjoy it, it certainly is challenging.  

More turns (2x) per campaign, pretty please.

Notes: the use of the word ""infidel"" is an Islamic term used to describe non-Muslims but the narrative in the game uses it when referencing either side. Christianity described Muslims as ""unbelievers"" which has the same meaning. 

Almost Last: I have only pruchased this for the Crusades, I have not played or evaluated the other two modern conflicts.

Historical: The first (unorganized) Crusade was in 1091 AD. From 650 AD to that time Islam had conquered a significant portion of Christiandom, all of north Africa, Spain and Portugal, and Southern France and all the way to the bounders ancient India which at that time included modern day Pakistan. So, for 441 years, until 1091 all battles and campaigns were strictly defensive ones for Christianity. What surprises me, in this game, is the extend of the fighting between the various caliphates. My interest has peak in that respect, I need to research that.

Overall, considering what you pay for a movie ticket these days, this game is worth what it costs. I hopr to see a few improvements, like expanded turns, open ended campaigns, health level on each unit.

The order of the moves, which units should move before others, playing a couple of moves and executing them vs. moving many units before executing them, did you remember to block an escape route for the enemy before attacking but did that now make you too weak to succeed in the attack or leave you a easy counter attack victim and more.

I completely recommend this game if you like strategy, but you have to be careful what you do. If you expand too fast then you will spread your armies thin which in turn can prove both benefitial and disasterous. Play your hand well, and you might just be able to conquer the whole map!

Innerhalb der Einheiten gibts halt überhaupt keine Diversität.
Es gibt alles was zu Fuß unterwegs ist als Infanterie.
Motorisierte Infanterie (Motorräder, Jeeps ect.)
Und einfach nur ""Panzer"". Keine Jagdpanzer, leichte Panzer schwere Panzer alles egal, du hast halt nen Panzer.
Je mehr Panzer in der Einheit sind, desto hochwertiger ist der angezeigte Panzer auf der Strategiemap.

Es gibt 0 Diplomatie. 

Die Forschung ist sehr Oberflächlich. Bietet kaum Tiefgang, halt irgendwelche Boni für oder gegen dies und das.
Für alle Nationen aber die gleichen Dinge..wow

Das Eroberungssystem ist dumm. Manchmal treibt man nen Gegner wie ne Sau vor sich her, dabei kann es halt mal vorkommen, dass er einfach so in ein von dir besetztes Gebiet stolpert, wenn da keine Einheit stationiert ist und es ist einfach lästig überall irgendwas hinzuklatschen, damit man die ganzen kleinen Müllhaufen los werden kann.

Genauso bei den Flugzeugen, es gibt Bomber und alles andere zusammengefasst als Jäger. Keine Schlachtflieger usw. 
Bomber sind gut gegen Panzer und Jäger gegen Infanterie, soweit zu den Luftkräften.
Jäger können Patroullie fliegen und wenn Bomber ohne Escorte kommen sind die Matsch.

Im Sandboxmodus kommen in besetzten Gebieten random manchmal ""Partisanen"" hervor und wenn dann da nicht gerade ne Einheit steht, gehört es einfach wieder der Nation der man das Gebiet entrissen hat in vollem Umfang.
Wenn du dann da eben 10 Bomber stationiert hast sind die halt schrott. 

Man kann nicht durch Länder Verbündeter Parteien marschieren soweit ich weiß.

Zu See ist es genauso: Ist ein Verbündeter in einem Gewässer, unpassierbar. Und wenns ein einzelnes Uboot ist.

Außerdem tragen Zufallsereignisse wie schlechtes Wetter, gute Wirtschaft, gute Zeiten schlechte Zeiten immer wieder dazu bei, dass im Spielfluss Schwankungen auftreten, Zufall ist eine ***** in einem Spiel und sorgt nur für Frust.

6€ Kann man dafür ausgeben, mehr ist es nicht Wert.

Als + könnte man sagen, es ist so ziemlich das Einzige seiner Art, es gibt Sandbox und Szenariomodi in denen man die Geschichte nachspielt. Aber das wars fast schon.

Developed and published by HeroCraft, Strategy & Tactics: Wargame Collection is just as its name suggests, a collection of three wargames focusing mainly on European warfare during the Middle Ages and World War Two. I was surprised to find out that this is in fact a PC port of games developed for mobile platforms initially. They are very well polished for a Steam debut.
 
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Strategy & Tactics: Wargame Collection has plenty of replay value considering we have three distinct open-ended campaigns. Medieval Wars: Strategy & Tactics, of course sets itself apart from the other two, Strategy & Tactics: WWII (story-based) or WW2: Sandbox, which as the name implies offers more freedom to players, who can choose from 28 nations to steer through the war. All three are anything but static, since the AI can give you an enticing challenge should you select a higher tier difficulty setting. The games contain multiplayer options in the form of hotseat mode but I found the playerbase to be severely lacking and I stuck to fighting the AI, most of the time. I was never bored but then again, grand strategy is an aquired taste.

While the game’s graphics aren’t really something to brag about, they serve their purpose fair enough as this is the standard interface to this type of strategy. You’re supposed to stare at a map and plan ahead. The 2D unit icons have sufficient diversity and the hundreds of regions presented to us, seem accurate as far as I can tell from my hefty experience with such games.
 
It is almost a golden rule for strategy games of any given subgenre, to have a very good musical score and this title doesn’t fail to impress either. The songs and themes are fitting well within the game modes and settings. 
 
[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Balanced difficulty scale and eloquent tutorial
+ Pleasant soundtrack
+ Steam Trading Cards
 
[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Many gameplay and interface similarities between the three scenarios
- No Steam Achievements
 
[h1]Result / Final thoughts[/h1]
As I become more mature from an intellectual perspective I began to try out and actually enjoy grand strategy games. This subgenre relinquishes any form of eye-candy in the name of pure strategic thinking. Consider yourself in a war room, surrounded by maps and constant reports about troop placement. Would it be considered fun by you? If the answer is “no”, you should still give it a chance. Use the tutorial and keep an open mind about it all. Such strategies do contain a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, I’m certain that the experience shall be a breath of fresh air. Stop being just a follower of orders and issue them yourself!

For this game has three parts each unfolding a new type of game play, while two of them venturing into the (WWII) era while the third one in to the medieval era. But make no mistake this a TBS gamers delight. The game encircles primarily around Europe in a grand strategy sort of game play,  apart from any major ideological drawbacks.

Imagine a World where you are either the allies namely U.S.A. , Britain,  France or the axis namely the Japan, Germany or Italy.Now youre given resources and military supplies based on the amount of resources you have and have been ordered to conquer different parts of the World.(but in a fun sort of way). This game offers exactly that in the sandbox mode. One thing worth mentioning here is that the war is strictly fought over Europe and some parts of Japan. There are key provinces which you must control to win the game. Each province offers some resources (generally 1 crate/gold coin). There are a few provinces in which and in only them can you call your reinforcements. one complaint here is that because of the enourmity of the sandbox mode .Its hard to keep track of all the troops or troop movements in one turn.So it is advised you play the tutorial or the second part of the game first.

This part is the campaign mode, where you play as any of the (WWII) powers and conquer your enemies provinces one by one.Theres also a bit of cinematics to this part of the game, as you generally see the WWII characters come to life on your screen.Here it is worth mentioning that the music is different for different versions of the base game.How ever they are all superb.

The music in the third version of the game takes our adventure to the medieval era, where the rules are a bit different. The WWII is nonexistent.Here instead of crates of supplies you gain coins. These coins you use to buy gold from special provinces marked with a small camp sign. how ever it is worth mentioning here that, the amount of resources you generate each turn is limited and is proprtional to the amount of area you control of the map.

The game play overall is smooth and and its a very fun game for strategy and tactical game fans. You get to call in all the units of each era in each era you play in a time specific manner. There are special citadel structure on the map,  on special provinces that gives defensive bonuses. In each missions depending on the era you can earn bouses like research points , that unlocks new advantages in millitary or industry. Or medals which grant bonuses. but to achieve these you must fionish the game in a limited number of turns. It is also noteworthy that in each game you start off with a limited amount of land. The game has many pros and relatively no cons, but to mention a few.

PROS

+ The game has three different versions in one complete game.
+ The price for this three games are of that of one
+ Sound strategy sanse and tactical sense implemented in this game
+ Tons of units from each era present in the game namely horseman,longbow man,tanks,aircrafts,motorized vehicles to
   name a few
+ Sound music in all three versions of the game
+ Self explanatory tutorials which are fun
+ Fun tech tree specially in campaign mode

I'm used to playing Axis and Allies, both the Milton Bradley board games as well as the old Nova Games, which was the best...I also play the triplea version, which is excellent. This game is much more in line with the Milton Bradley games. A relatively simple game, simple mechanics. That being said, there are some very nice features that I enjoy. You can plot out moves in a step by step fashion. Moving infantry to take the first territory, then ""relocating"" mech units into the newly taken territory, and then launching an attack with them into the next. You are not required to to plan out every move for all your troops, they can be executed one at a time. This is definately a ""beer and pretzels"" kind of game. 
There are, of course, things that I feel need to be addressed to make this a truly awesome game. And I do believe the potential is there. One of the issues that I saw in other reviews was that there is no diplomacy. Since this game is based on WWII, the sides are pretty much determined. Don't let that stop you from buying this game. However, it is true that you are unable to move your troops through an allies territory. This is quite problematic. England is pretty much handicapped until Germany makes the mistake of taking a coastal province. As long as you don't do that, and there is no compelling reason to do so, you've effectively blocked any invasion from that front. As Germany, you are completely unable to send troops to aid Italy. English and French navies will never combine. Spain is pretty much on its own. Think of it as a first come, first serve kind of war. If I get there before my allies, they are going to have to figure out another way around, and if they get there first...oh well. This is the one thing that I feel needs to be addressed. The war was Axis and Allies...oh, and Russia. Axis and Allies and Russia. Not Germany, an independant state that promised not to attack Italy, Italy, an independant state that promised not to attack Germany, France, an independant state that promised not to attack England, England, an independant state, Romania...etc. Once that gets fixed, I would definately recommend this game.

YES please, three good games in one... YOU rock, Strategy and Tactics isn't just a single amazing Strategy game it's three of them.  WOW, you can't top that value three top notch super fun strategy games for a low price... Where do I sign up???   You already know the answer it's this games store page.  

The three games are similar to each other with slight differences, the differences aren't anything major, mainly just the games setting, two of the games are set in World war two, while the third game takes it back old school to the days of Knights and kings..  Great stuff. 

[h1]Strategy and Tactics World War 2,[/h1] allows you to play as one of three super powers from the second world war, the Axis, The allies, and the USSR.  The game has loads of skirmish mode maps, and 7 historical scenario based maps.  The game also has a multiplayer mode which I admittedly didn't play, although the single player game was enough to keep me learning and burning..  Lots of fun to play, dominate your enemies and bring them to their knees.  

[h1]Strategy and Tactics WW 2 Sandbox[/h1] is almost the same as the non sandbox game, with the difference being it's more open and accessible, you can pick one of 39 countries to pick from, a great mode to kick back and let your old school strategy game playing flag fly.  destroy the world through force or through.... FORCE, bend all he countries to your own personal will..  Are you going to go all out crazy and outlaw crazy mustaches, or maybe you'll ban men from wearing Skirts.. (that won't go over too well in Scotland)  Whatever you choose, this is your option if you want a more open experience that is far more open ended.

[h1]Strategy and Tactics Medieval [/h1]....  I'm sure you heard the expression, I'm about to go Medieval up in this piece... well this game is just that.  Go back to a point in time when king's sat on their iron thrones, knights patrolled the country sides in search of maidens to rescue and King Arthur pulled the magical sword from the stone..  (Ok I lied about the King Arthur part... I'm a bad boy)  What Medieval does have is 3 historical campaigns, 4 historical scenarios, more skirmish maps than you can shake a stick at.  

Three games in one, pick your poison and get ready to rumble because in this game you'll be rumbling and bumbling for sure.

[h1] Pro's[/h1] 

3 games in 1 neat package
Awesome tutorials, let you know just how to crush you enemies
Fun gameplay 
AI that doesn't suck

[h1] Con's[/h1]

You get 3 games, but they all have very similar gameplay
Slightly repetitive game play
pretty bad User Interface 
Could have used a bit more complexity in non combat aspects

[h1] Recommendation[/h1]

Well Strategy and Tactics won't be the game of the year, what it will do is offer you a chance to play a fun historical strategy game that has just the right difficulty to allow the gamer to feel like the boss, but keeping you on your toes at the same time.   I absolutely found the game to be thoroughly enjoyable and well worth the purchase point.  The few negatives the game has are overshadowed by the positives, and really leave the gamer enthralled by a visceral experience that can keep you entertained for hours on end.  Strategy fans should buy this immediately, it's a quality title, with decent Ai, and fast paced game-play.",1461892606,1461892606,True,26,2,0.621755599975585938,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You'll find yourself pulling off classic strategic maneuvers with armies and it's really rewarding when they work.

A properly placed attack can encircle an army and wipe it out. 

However, there are some cons about the game design itself. The UI is very annoying to use, the click-click option for moving armies is really a pain to use. I suggest they'd exclusivley use a click-and-drag instead so nothing gets mixed up in your commands.

Don't pick this up expecting anything realistic, the game is obviously designed to be a fun experience irrelevent of historical accuracy. As a fan of WWII history and strategy, I still enjoyed this game for what it is.

Except when you factor in that all the stuff that is worth anything at all is 100+ supply. When you purchase a unit, depending on how expensive it is, they have a strength number. If it is at a twelve, it is a full army. There is also a health system in the game where if you lose all your health, the units die. There is naval and air but those are the same things unless bombing with aircraft or ships which is by a slider. Thats it. The game's idea isn't bad at all. I like Risk and I love board games.

[h1][u][b]Game Overview[/b][/u][/h1]

[b]Strategy & Tactics - Wargame Collection[/b] is a package of three turn-based strategic games namely ""Strategy & Tactics: World War II"", ""Strategy & Tactics: World War II Sandbox"", and ""Strategy & Tactics: Medieval Wars"".

In [b]Strategy & Tactics: World War II[/b], you can play as one of the three forces prominent during the World War II which are the ""Axis Powers"", the ""Soviet Union"" (USSR), and the ""Allied Forces"" in each of their respective campaigns.
The skirmish mode features tons of maps for you to choose as well as seven (7) scenario-based maps. It also has a hot-seat mode available for you to play 1v1 with either an AI opponent or with your friend.

The gameplay in [b]Strategy & Tactics: World War II - Sandbox[/b] is quite similar with ""Strategy & Tactics: World War II"", however it showcases a rather single-player style skirmish with AI. 
In this one, you can pick on the main objective for you to priotize in order to win the game, which of the 39 countries you are going to play as, and the alliance settings for the session.

[b]Medieval Wars: Strategy & Tactics[/b] also borrows the game mechanics from the first two games in the pack, but is executed with a different period as it is set on the medieval ages. 
Campaign mode has three (3) armies for you to play as which are the ""English Armies"" (England), the ""French Troops"" (France), and the ""Crusader Forces"". It also has skirmish, hotseat and scenario mode that is similar of the first two games.

All in all, the games seems to focus on a more combat-oriented strategy rather than a combined gameplay with diplomatic aspects.

[h1][u][b]The Pros[/b][/u][/h1]

[list]

    [*][b]Detailed Tutorial[/b] - Having a detailed tutorial is a pretty important aspect especially when it comes to strategic games, may it be new players of the genre or the seasoned ones. Every game of the genre has something that is differently executed than the others, and learning the ropes easily depends on this.

    [*][b]Atmospheric Soundtracks[/b] - The soundtracks made for this game really gets the feel and presence of going into a war, which adds to a wholesome game experience and more importantly, the tracks aren't the annoying type that makes you mute them after hearing it repeatedly.

    [*][b]Great Value[/b] - Presenting a price of three (3) games for one is a very enticing offer, and even more if the games deliver to what they offer as advertised. Seeing through the game, it seems that there are more contents to come and it'll definitely be a plus for the game.

[/list] 

[h1][u][b]The Cons[/b][/u][/h1]

[list]

    [*][b]Similar Gameplay[/b] - Though there might be differences in terms of period setting and some gameplay mechanics that differentiates each of the three, there isn't really anything that makes them standout from one or the other as a whole.

    [*][b]Crude Interface[/b] - A thing that really bothers me in every game is when it doesn't have a clean interface to deliver. The font style used for each of the game are somewhat hard to read and is confusing to the eye at the very least.

[/list] 


[h1][u][b]The Verdict[/b][/u][/h1]

In terms of overall features, this game goes about what a standard strategic game offers. However, it is good to note that it'll be still updated with more content in the near future and is atleast worth the try to get.

Looking at the screenshots Strategy & Tactics looked a little complicated at first and I wasn't sure if it was something I'd love but I gave it a try and I have no regrets. The game is actually easy to learn and the tutorial is very in depth and talks you through everything as you play so you can properly understand what you need to know.
There are three separate parts to Strategy & Tactics: World War II, World War II Sandbox and Medieval Wars. World War II has a campaign mode where you battle your way across Europe via multiple missions. Additionally you can play multiplayer skirmishes against the computer or hotseat with a friend with rules which you set yourself. There are also various scenarios for you to try, each with different objectives, map sizes and bots so there is plenty of variation. World War II sandbox mode seems to be the same as World War II skirmishes but on a much grander scale. The whole world participates in one large battle where you can choose your country and whether or not you want to play with alliances. You can then set your objective and start playing. I've actually found this mode to be very intense and exciting rather than the smaller scale battles. In the Medieval Wars you'll take part in the Excalibur campaign where you defend, defeat, and reconquer you way through The War of The Roses. The gameplay is almost identical to World War 2 with the exception of names on areas of the map being different, having different units, different music and a nicer looking in- game interface (though this is just my preference).

In the campaign modes you'll start with a tutorial which will explain all about units and movements, attacking and supporting, defending, unit health and objectives. I've not found anything important whilst playing that wasn't explained. Once completing the tutorial you'll be faced with your first mission. Each mission has objectives, optional objectives, defeat conditions and the how many turns you can take to get the gold or silver medals for the said mission. You must use your units to secure victory by conquering key points on the map or clearing out enemy soldiers. Some missions have different ways to win and some have just one. [b]Strategy & Tactics is a very combat based game.[/b] There is little to no diplomacy in the game and it centres around military victory. You'll start with some units, which vary from ground soldiers, to air support to boats and armoured cars (WWII), and a small amount of territory. Some pieces of territory grant resources whilst you own them and those resources are used to call in reinforcements. These reinforcements can be chosen and dropped at any of the key locations you hold and are very pivotal to winning a game. Though there aren't masses of unit types, what you have gets the job done and stops it from being overcomplicated. As you play through missions you'll earn 'Research points' which can be spent upgrading either your military or science research which in turn will improve things like your soldiers strength or health adding some nice progression and an added incentive to complete the missions within the allotted turns. 

The sandbox mode is a lot more intense choosing to focus on large battle. This time instead of playing on small areas of the map the whole map is opened and every country is involved and starts with multiple units and a section of owned territory. You can choose to have alliances turned on for everyone, off for everyone or off for just the player so you can experience battle three different ways. You can also select one of many different end objectives which vary depending on which country you so it doesn't feel repetitive. There are tons and tons of different scenarios you can set up for yourself by combining these different variables. I would recommend playing some of the campaign modes first so you aren't completely overwhelmed but there is still a tutorial here for those who want to dive right in. 

The graphics and music themselves are very reminiscent of older games and although this doesn't bother me some people might be looking for something a little more refined. The in-game interface is nicer in the Medieval Wars game mode in my opinion at it just looks a little more modern but there isn't much difference. 
I should also mention though having a good amount of campaign/scenarios the developers are planning to add more so the current content will actually increase.

Things that could have been improved are: I think there needs to be a button to move to you unit that still have moves. This isn't an issue early on but as you play more and more and the maps get larger you have to do a lot of looking around to make sure you haven't missed something. It is most prominent in the Sandbox mode where there is a lot going on at once. It'd also be nice for difficulty settings as right now the bots just have one difficulty and it can get pretty challenging, especially if you've not played something like this before. I think steam achievements would be a great addition to the game as there are many different scenarios and campaigns to choose from, it'd be nice to be able to track your progress like that. Lastly I can find no way to move into allied territory in sandbox mode. It may be me doing something wrong but I tried everything. I was playing as Great Britain and ended up trapped on the island because France was an ally and I couldn't move into anywhere they owned. 

[b]Overall I think Strategy & Tactics is an awesome combat TBS with plenty of content and very fun gameplay. I've already sunk 3 hours into the sandbox part alone. $10 is a great price for what you get and I think any casual turn based strategy fan should grab it, especially on sale.[/b]",1461410786,1461410786,True,106,6,0.78074491024017334,1,False,False,False,False,,,

I don't know if they plan to update and add it, but there's little to no diplomacy whatsoever. The AI does diplomacy sometimes (Finland announces it has joined the Communist Bloc! O_o), but you can't. If you play Sandbox with the pre-set alliance disabled (neutral, Allied, Axis), everyone fights everyone. It's still really fun, but I thought I would warn you. This is a combat game, not a diplomacy game!

There isn't any other reviews yet, as far as I can see, so I thought I'd write a super-quick 10 minutes first impression on launch, so you might be spared the hassle to refund if you don't like it.

First things; graphics and sound is very dated. The game does not look pretty in the least. There also is no sound slider, but with the rather sad quality of the audio you might as well mute it.

Now for gameplay. I haven't played enough to find the real depth or tactics yet, of course, but I can say that altough the UI is a bit clunky, the game works well. It seems to be the straightforward WW2 sandbox game I've always wanted. Hearts of Iron is too complex and slow for me, while Risk has too much luck. This is a middlepoint between the two extremes, more towards RISK but without any stupid dice.

Would I recommend it as of now? Yes, yes I would. It's clunky, and looks bad, but you probably already saw that from the pictures. There's a specific type of gamer that would enjoy this, and if you are already looking at the reviews, you probably are that person. 

((45 Minutes later edit)) - the AI is pleasingly competent, and I feel there's more than enough depth and content already to justify the price. If you are looking for a milsim game, this is not it. If you want to play Risk with no luck against AI that's surprisingly skilled, this is it.",1461366999,1461372095,True,191,8,0.848093628883361816,11,True,False,False,False,,,

Российская студия HeroCraft постепенно переделывает свои мобильные продукты под компьютерные версии. Конечно, студия делает большой шаг вперёд и развивается не только в пределах AppStore и PlayMarket. Денежная политика в Steam и на мобильных сервисах у HeroCraft довольно сильно отличается, к примеру, Средневековая стратегия в AppStore без микро-транзакций стоит почти 800 рублей, а стоимость трёх стратегий на PС 449 рублей. Конечно, в мобильную версию можно играть где угодно начиная от метро и заканчивая какой-нибудь беседкой. 

Довольно редко встретишь когда в одном клиенте сразу несколько игр и данный проект, как раз из этой серии. В игровом клиенте можно найти две стратегии про Вторую мировую войну и одну стратегию о Средневековых и Крестовых походах. Каких-то глобальных различий между тремя этими проектами нет.

Игровой процесс во всех трёх играх одинаковый и представляет собой пошаговые сражения. Игрок распоряжается войсками и отправляет их на различные точки (точками выступаю поселения или города). Пехотные войска могут сделать лишь один ход за сеанс, а вот различные конницы, танки, машины целых два. Во время процесса сражения, можно вызывать подкрепление, но оно появиться в главном городе и на следующий ход. Здесь есть возможность вызывать во время боя различные пехотные, авиационные, танковые войска. Однако, чем сильнее отряд тем больше придётся за него заплатить. В роли денежных средств здесь выступают припасы и получить их можно путём удержания городов. Соответственно, чем больше точек находиться под вашим влиянием, тем больше ваши доходы. После прохождения миссии игроку будут начисляться очки навыков, которые можно потратить на различные улучшения, к примеру, танковые войска получают меньший урон от авиации и т. д. Между заданиями будут показывать так называемые ролики, на которых высокопоставленные военные обсуждают дальнейшие планы ведения боевых действий. Конечно, роликом это назвать трудно, скорее это больше похоже на чёрно-белый плакат, в котором меняется лишь мимика офицера.

Первая тактическая стратегия предлагает игроку погрузиться в исторические сражения времён Второй мировой. В сюжетной кампании игроку необходимо преодолеть весь путь Второй мировой войны. На протяжении всей кампании, игрок сможет участвовать в значимых сражениях третьего Рейха и Советского Союза, к примеру, Вторжение в Польшу, Европейский Блицкриг (захват Дании, Норвегии, Франции) и т. д. Баталии, которые не вошли в состав основной линии, есть в так называемых побочных заданиях, к примеру, Советско-Финская Война.

Во второй игре нет никаких кампаний и побочных заданий, зато есть одно масштабное сражение, а именно Вторая мировая война. Игрок может выбрать одну из стран участниц Второй мировой и вступить в бой. Стоит отметить, что для каждой страны свои приоритеты, к примеру, если выбрать Югославию, то необходимо захватить территории стран Болгария, Венгрия, Румыния.

Третий проект повествует историю о крестоносцах и борьбу за священные земли. Большее внимание здесь уделяется таким странам, как Англия, Франция. Есть кампания, в которой придётся захватывать и защищать священные земли. Здесь есть место и побочным заданиям, а именно Ледовое побоище, Война за объединение Норвегии, Итальянские войны и т.д.

Конечно, в игровом клиенте есть свой перечень недостатков, к примеру, в настоящее время замечена проблема с вылетами, а именно в первой игре во время прохождения побочной миссии Советско-Финской войны. Проблемы с синхронизацией сохранений т.е нельзя продолжить проходить кампанию на другом Пк.

В итоге, можно сказать, что перед нами полная копия мобильной версии, только без всяких микро-транзакций. Здесь придётся хорошенько пошевелить извилинами для победы в сражении. Если вам понравилась мобильные версии этих игр или вы простой любитель пошаговых стратегий покупайте без каких-либо раздумий.

Плюсы:
В одном клиенте сразу несколько проектов
Довольной интересный игровой процесс
Во время процесса прохождения невольно запоминаешь города различных стран

Минусы:
Периодические вылеты в различных миссиях
Отсутствие синхронизации сохранения
