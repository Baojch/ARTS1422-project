This game is a masterpiece no wonder everyone said it’s great despite its so short like a tech demo

It’s all incredibly delightful as Jake breaks the fourth wall and constantly attempts to defend or appease you with food or anecdotes. 
The VR feels justified, 

mostly because the developer Turbo Button, in a rare case for an Adventure Time game, actually tried to capture the essence of the show.

What developer Turbo Button has essentially done here is come up with an excuse for the top-down camera angle, which is kind of genius, actually, and reminds me of the camera system from Super Mario 64. 

 The duo is charming, as are the few cast members (like Lumpy Space Princess) players encounter on their journey. They nail the humor and charm of the series.

It’s a shame, then, that the experience is so fleeting. While it may seem like a fully-fledged game, there’s only two levels in total, both of which can be completed in roughly 30 minutes. The story, while cute, also never really goes anywhere, and it ends abruptly, almost like they ran out of time on the project. It’s weird. There also isn’t much to do, as both stages only house several collectibles to find — other than that, it’s your job to get from point A to point B.

I can’t stress enough that Adventure Time: Magic Man’s Head Games doesn’t amount to much more than a tech demo that you can complete in one sitting. In that sense it’s a proof of concept for VR platforming, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a joy to play from start to finish. 

While Turbo Button could have really stood to flesh this project out, 

I’d love to see more, and if it ever happens, I’ll be right there on day one.

 Sadly, I do understand that the ratio of tripe to good games is high and it makes it hard to find the good stuff sometimes, especially older titles that were either poorly marketed or just didn't take off for whatever reason.  I wish I had hope that this will change but I'm not too optimistic on that front.  I figure most of the good PSVR2 stuff will be exclusives, and I'm not confident that the good PCVR titles that are available are selling enough to encourage studios to keep making them.  Not when they can just cater to the lowest-common-denominator that is the Facebook Quest.

Let's cut to the chase:

- The game runs great

- Its art style is very in keeping with the show with some extra shading work on top to add a level of polish that I noticed and appreciated

- The controls and mechanics work fine but do little to add variety to gameplay, this is about as barebones an action-platformer as it could possibly be. The control input method being gamepad only with no support for motion controllers (emulating a gamepad) is a shame but not the end of the world.

- The amount of content (both plot and total playtime) is minimal and provides about 45 minutes of gameplay if you pace yourself and look for the secrets

- Difficulty is non-existent, the enemies aren't hard to beat and traversal is very simple

Conclusion:
This is a cheap but polished Adventure Time game with about as much content as you'd expect for the price. As a PCVR game it's just kind of ok (if you find this game scratches an itch for 3rd person VR action-platformers you didn't know you had, ""Moss"" and the Oculus Store version of ""Chronos"" are both stellar examples of what the genre can offer when given a bigger budget and scope), but as an AT tie-in this game really sticks out as a neat little novelty and is something I wholeheartedly recommend to fans of the show.

A pesar de que el juego es muy, muy corto (sólo son 2 niveles), es muy entretenido mientras dura. Además en lo personal me encanta el doblaje que hacen en español latinoamericano, en especial jake el perro que lo interpreta José Arenas quien para mí es el mejor Jake de todos.

Debido a la duración te deja con ganas de más pero en general es una experiencia muy agradable. Lo recomiendo mucho sobre todo si te gusta la serie animada, aparte el juego es muy barato. 
Ojalá en un futuro se animen los desarrolladores a hacer un juego más completo y con este nivel de calidad, quizás no necesariamente usando la franquicia de hora de aventura pero sí otro juego de plataformas en realidad virtual.

Als Auftrag von Cartoon Network Games entwickelte Turbo Button schon 2016 dieses Spiel, das auf einer beliebten Zeichentrickserie des Senders basiert. Ursprünglich war das Spiel für die Samsung Gear herrausgekommen, mittlerweile gibt es es auch auf allen anderen HMDs. Man merkt dem Spiel seine Herkunft schon an. Es wird lediglich mit dem Gamecontroller gesteuert, immerhin keine pure Kopfsteuerung und die Grafik ist sehr simpel, aber liebevoll und passend zur TV-Serie Adventure Time.

Adventure Time: Jagd nach dem Zaubermann ist ein lustiges nicht ganz ernst zu nehmendes Spiel. Das Intro beginnt mit einem Picknick mitten im schönen Land Ooo mit den beiden Protagonisten Finn und seinem Hund Jake. Die beiden fühlen sich schnell beobachtet und drehen sich um und schauen uns direkt an. Wir verkörpern in dieser Geschichte den neuen Freund Tiny. Aber genau jetzt erscheint der Bösewicht Zaubermann, er verwandelt uns einfach in einen riesigen Ballon, weil er es kann.

Von hier steuern wir Finn und Jake. Jake springt in Finns Rucksack, um weitere Angriffs- und Bewegungsoptionen zu bieten, sehr cool.  Mit einem Schwert bewaffnet kämpft sich das Duo nun durch böse Sandwiches und Gnome immer auf der Suche nach Jack-in-the-Box-Sammelobjekten. . Jake unterstützt Finn aus dem Rucksack heraus mit besonderen Angriffen wie einer riesigen Faust, die die Gegner betäubt. Außerdem können wir uns über weite Abgründe schwingen und der Hund kann sich in eine Art Fallschirm verwandeln.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2167993937
Vor Motionsickness braucht man keine Angst haben, die Kamera folgt langsam dem Spieler und bietet einen ausreichend weiten Blickwinkel, um nach den Boxen zu suchen, außerdem kann man prima im Sitzen spielen.
 Die Steuerung ist flüssig und präzise genug, so dass die Level nicht allzu schwierig sind. Allerdings wird das Spiel nur mit dem Gamecontroller gespielt.

 Der Titel richtet sich an Kinder, Fans und Familien. Die Kinder haben Spaß an den bekannten Figuren und die Erwachsenen freuen sich über den spitzen Humor der beiden. Leider ist das Spiel nicht sehr lang, es bietet lediglich zwei Level. Es macht wirklich Spaß und benutzt sogar die originalen deutschen Syncrostimmen der Serie.

Adventure Time: Jagd auf den Zaubermann ist ein großartiger kleiner Jump'n'Run-Titel, den man in ein oder zwei Stunden durchspielt. Der vorhandene Humor verleiht ihm Charme, es ist nur schade, dass es so kurz ist. Das Hinzufügen einiger weiterer Gegnertypen hätte dem Reiz für erfahrenere Spieler sicherlich auch nicht geschadet. Finn ist leider nicht Super Mario. Hätte aber das Potenzial dazu.

--------------------------------------------->
Adventure Time Hunt for the Wizard Man by Turbo Button is a short platformer.

Commissioned by Cartoon Network Games, Turbo Button developed this game back in 2016, based on a popular animated series from the channel. Originally released for the Samsung Gear, the game is now available on all other HMDs. You can already tell the game's origin. It is only controlled with the game controller, at least no pure head control and the graphics are very simple, but lovingly and fitting to the TV series Adventure Time.

Adventure Time: Hunt for the Wizard Man is a funny game that is not to be taken quite seriously. The intro starts with a picnic in the middle of the beautiful land of Ooo with the two protagonists Finn and his dog Jake. The two quickly feel like they are being watched and turn around to look directly at us. We embody the new friend Tiny in this story. But right now the villain Wizard Man appears, he just turns us into a giant balloon because he can.

From here, we control Finn and Jake. Jake jumps into Finn's backpack to provide more attack and movement options, very cool.  Armed with a sword, the duo now fights their way through evil sandwiches and gnomes always on the lookout for Jack-in-the-Box collectibles. . Jake supports Finn from the backpack with special attacks like a giant fist that stuns enemies. In addition, we can swing over wide chasms and the dog can turn into a kind of parachute.

There's no need to be afraid of motionsickness, the camera slowly follows the player and offers a wide enough viewing angle to look for the boxes, plus it's great to play sitting down.
 The controls are fluid and precise enough, so the levels aren't too difficult. However, the game is only played with the game controller.

 The title is aimed at children, fans and families. The kids will have fun with the familiar characters and the adults will enjoy their pointed humor. Unfortunately, the game is not very long, offering only two levels. It's really fun and even uses the original German sync voices from the series.

Adventure Time: Hunt for the Wizard Man is a great little platform title that you can play through in an hour or two. The humor present adds charm, it's just a shame it's so short. Adding a few more enemy types certainly wouldn't have hurt the appeal for more experienced players either. Finn is not Super Mario, unfortunately. Would have the potential to be, though.

I would not recommend this game at much more than $3 though. The game itself is simply way too short to warrant spending more than $5 on and if you're not an adventure time fan, I'd stay away.

This game has some stunning visuals inspired by the artwork animation from the show, along with concise gameplay mechanics for the player to almost immediately get used to. The game has added immersion with your favourite characters from Adventure Time interacting with you. This experience is similar to the PSVR exclusive 'Astro Bot Rescue Mission'; when you're essentially playing your average 3D platformer; but just using a VR headset to look around. The game is also fully voice-acted by the shows' cast. 

However, the game is incredibly short and I completed it (with all the achievements) in just over an hour. As mentioned by another review, the experience feels more like a demo of what could've been a much larger game. The developers should've experimented with more of the functionality with a VR headset. The only time I found the headset useful was when I had to use Jake to attach to a pole to lift Finn up a cliff face. Despite the inclusion of more VR complex game mechanics, I would've liked to see some other characters show up such as PB and Ice King; who are just as iconic as the four already in the game.

Overall, I feel like this is the kind of title that fits perfectly with a £3.99 (or 4.93$) price tag. It's an easy, quick entertaining little game, enough to kill an hour or two; especially during times like these.",1592588391,1592588391,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Good voice acting

Good use of minimalist art style

Ends just as it's getting started
Only four enemy types, and two of those are barely distinguishable from others
For one enemy type (melee gnome), you can't really tell when its attack is going to hit
Characters talk directly to you and act like they're waiting for you to reply (immersion breaking, since it ignores mic)
Story is barely there, yet still ends unresolved
Looking around the environment is unrewarding

It fits somewhere between Mario and Legend of Zelda for play style.  But really the mechanics are just so polished, the game really feels like it should be longer.  Length wise it about 2 levels long.  Only 3 or 4 mobs and no boss fight. But just the style of gameplay is very satisfying.

Story wise, it's light.  You start off as something tiny, then get turned into a giant balloon by Magic Man.  Finn and Jake adventure to turn you back.  It’s pretty cool how jake will stretch over to you to interact with you.  Execution is really well done.


I played on WMR, it worked nicely. I didn't feel motion sick but when the camera pulled back or moved down I definitely felt a little disoriented.  It requires a gamepad to play, motion controllers aren't supported despite nothing really preventing it from working. Steam controller was adamantly wanting me to start this game from big picture mode for some reason.

Overall, it's short but great. Recommended if you can get it on sale.

However the writing seemed a bit sloppy and everything needed to be smushed into a two level game which can be played within almost half an hour.
now i am not saying that it is bad, but it is hardly a beginning i would call this a demo and not really a full fledged game.
I have played the fan-made game ""what if adventure time was a 3d anime"" and i honestly believe that the devs could actually use a bit more tips and tricks from that game and their premise, without the NSFW stuff afcourse.

I even went into this game hoping it would have some of the same spark and feel as the fan-made game but kept an open mind throughout still i was somehow disappointed by what i received.

pros:
-making fully use of the voice cast
-creating a vibrant and active environment
-enemies are within the trend of adventure time
-good use of characters
-controls were good
-nice combo`s and abilities

cons:
-very short 2 levels are way too short for a game, this really falls in the category of demo`s
-sadly not much enemy types
-missing some easter eggs (i did see the snail multiple times but the phil face eluded me and multiple other appearances remained missing)
-puzzles and jumping puzzles weren`t challenging enough
-no particulair penalty to dying",1482755772,1482755772,False,1,0,0.502538084983825684,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The movement feels a bit unsettlingly floaty but that passed for me after a few minutes. Once passed that, it felt pretty rock solid. Annoyingly there are some points where you want to look around at something further to your sides, but as it is a seated/controller game, you end up having to manuever your character through your personal space so that the camera shifts over. Else you end up trying to crane over your neck in your seat.

The platforming is alright. Slow and floaty jumps, but not too bad. This isn't Mario 64/Galaxy levels of platforming. More like early playstation B-list gaming, with a modern/clean/polished look. Something you would typically buy for a younger sibling.

Annoyingly I would prefer to not leave a yey/ney. The game has me interested in what else the dev's might put out and for that I'd recommend it.

- BMO in a quest to find new batteries >(Time Trail gamemode)
- Marceline and collect new items for your guitar >(Search for items)
- Ice King and try to find all the pieces for your ultimate princess >(Gameplay trough diffrent stages and hunt down something)

Aslong as this game get's more content I would start recommending to others.

Easy, seated VR experience played from a ""giant's"" perspective. 
Adventure Time fans will appreciate the character interactions (they talk TO you)
Controls well and feels like a polished platformer
Cheap price.

Cons:
Way, way, way too short. Story (what little there is) ends abruptly. Price is reflective of the amount of content.
Magic Man doesn't actually play games with your head. I was expecting more tomfoolery from this.

I'd only recommend this for diehard fans of Adventure Time and for kids. I imagine it would be a decent way to get them to sit still for 30-40 minutes.",1460751625,1460751625,False,3,1,0.550098180770874023,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That said, this is a really lovely time. It'll probably take around 30-40 minutes to complete and in that time you'll get an experience that's pretty much just like a regular Adventure Time episode. Finn, Jake, LSP and Magic Man all make an appearence with wonderfully crafted character models and the same voice talent from the show. The humour is on point and the world looks just great.

Works great with a Steam Controller.

The only negatives are the achievements currently don't work, and the length, I definitely want to play more levels, but for the price it's not a swindle.

On the one hand:
* the graphics are great,
* the environments are lovely,
* the controls work well,
* it's fully voice-acted by the show's cast,
* there are some fun uses of the VR POV, and
* it's generally an enjoyable game to play.

Unfortunately, it's let down by:
* not being very challenging,
* no real punishment for dying,
* no particular reward for collecting all of the secrets,
* only taking 30 minutes to complete (without rushing), and
* coming to a very abrupt end.

Seriously, you've only just learned the final control when you reach the game's ""conclusion"".
I realise it's a $5/£4 game, but it really feels like a demo to a larger game. Even just a few more levels, taking it to an hour or two of gameplay, would have been enough.

I picked a ""yes"" recommendation because I do think it's a good VR experience, but it's a little over-priced as it stands.",1460008876,1460008876,True,104,3,0.892759263515472412,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sur vive ou oculus ca doit être un régal pour les yeux ;-)
Point positif pas de ""motion sickness"" lors de ma session de jeu mais peut être est ce du au fait que le jeu soit à la troisième personne.
En ce qui concerne le gameplay c'est un jeu de plateforme basique dans le fond (sauter sur des plateformes et tuer les ennemis qui nous barrent la route) mais dans la forme la vr ajoute ce qu'il faut pour avoir envie de poursuivre l'aventure.
