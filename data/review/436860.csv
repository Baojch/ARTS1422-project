The game launches but the graphics aren't rendered, you just get a big white screen instead.  This obviously renders the game unplayable, so right off the bat, buyer beware.  This didn't work for me, and it may not work for you. 

This game has been translated from some other language into English... badly.  If this was done through Google Translate, Google Translate should feel ashamed of itself.  Regardless, the language in this game is broken and will put off a lot of gamers.

Gameplay itself is a confused mess (if you can even get it to work).  It's trying to be a survival/crafting/adventure/RPG/stealth/horror mystery game and it fails hard on all these attempts.  It might have been better to do one thing well instead of a dozen things badly.  Disclaimer, obviously, this information about the game is accurate but it is second hand, I had to watch a lot of videos to get the gist of the gameplay because of the broken nature of the game. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the video game library/engine, Blender Game Engine.  It's rarely used, because it's arguably worse than construction kits like GameMaker Studio, RPGMaker and Clickteam Fusion, but it's also much harder to work with.  Despite this, Blender Game Engine has very limited capabilities, which go some way to explaining the poor quality of the game.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  In fact, the Blender engine is so bad it was abandoned many years ago by Blender themselves, because they knew just how bad it is.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a modest spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Because the game is broken and unplayable for me, it may also not work for other gamers.  This is a solid reason to approach this game with some skepticism.

This game features a number of suspicious, likely fake positive reviews. The reviews all appear at almost exactly the same time, very shortly after the game launched on Steam, all have a direct Steam purchase of the game, and all have very similar wording and writing style.  Immediately after this huge peak of reviews, reviews (and player counts) for the game dropped incredibly sharply.  This is highly unusual given the very low quality of the game and poor player counts.  The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be taken with a large grain of salt.This might have been done to deceive/mislead gamers into paying for a bad product.  The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be taken with a large grain of salt.

So, should you buy this game?

""Arctic alive"" is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

This is the sort of game that 'polarises' opinons (see what I did there?)

But joking aside, it really does. The game attempts to do many things for its low cost - however at the same time it doesn't quite succeed. There is limited crafting, as well as stealth, combat and survival. however some could accuse the game of being excessive in its attempt. 

A good example is the survival elements. The basics are there such as eating and drinking - but there is also washing, going to the toilet and even having to clean your clothes. This does lead to the feeling of a lot of busy work that really is not welcome when trying to survive.  All of this uses water which needs to be pumped into a tank meaning you have to run back to the pump room to pump even more water. 

And finally there is the stealth and combat. Both feel somewhat cumbersome as even the slightest movement will have the AI torpedo straight to you, but the AI itself moves in a somewhat random motion, leading to inevitable death. Once you finally have a weapon if you 'kill' the AI it turns into a sort of black puddle - which also will kill you on touch. However often this puddle is now blocking the path you need to take. So you need to wait for it to reform then try and kill it again, just somewhere it does not block your movement. 

Graphically the game is fairly ugly in all honesty but at least the controls are smooth, and the performance is good. 

With that all said - I actually like the game, despite the issues. In fact if anything I wish the game went on longer, as it is on the short side. 

So I applaud the game for trying to do a lot, and also for being a genuine indy game and not the usual asset flip - but be warned the game has a lot of rough edges, and it will test the patience of even the most patient saint.",1511204640,1511204640,True,4,0,0.534599423408508301,0,True,False,False,False,,,

というような表現がピッタリだと思います。

バイオ系のホラーADVにサバイバルゲーム要素をプラス
というちょっとユニークな内容です。

最初はどうしたらいいかわからないことだらけの中
ひとつひとつ自分で学び取りながら進めていく
というタイプのゲームで、それが程よい難易度で
表現されていて楽しめました。

いくつかのレビューには死にまくる為ストレスが…
という感じのものがありますが、アップデートにより
1階のメイン通路をうろつく敵が削除されたことで
だいぶプレイしやすく改善されたものと思います。

取れるアイテムには名前が表示されるのですが
かなりギリギリまで近づかないと表示されないので
自分で探して見つけるという要素はきちんとあります。

セーブがやりやすくさらに初見殺しになりそうな
場面では自動でチェックポイントセーブが入るなど
かなり親切なのですが、それは反面緊張感を低下
させていたとも思います。

敵の黒い液体人間はそれほど大きな脅威には
なっていないのですが（と言っても追いかけられると
かなり焦りますが）動きのランダム性と対処の仕方が
うまくマッチしていて面白かったです。
外にいるクマさんはモコモコしててプリチーで良いけど
木に登ってやり過ごすという方法にしても
ホラー度は弱めです。このゲームで一番怖いのは
こんな極寒の施設で普通の人間は自分ひとりだけしか
いない、ということを想像してみるときでしょうか。

サバイバル面では服まで洗濯しなければいけなかったり
するのですが、難易度的にはそれほどキツくなく
自分にも程よかったです。栽培や釣りまでできます。
料理をするときなかなか食欲をそそる音がします。
トイレではチョロロ…と音がします。
普通のサバイバルゲームと違って長期間必要な目標等が
無いのでサバイバル日数はそんなに長くはならず
そこはもっとやらせてほしいと感じるところでした。

ビジュアルは一見シンプルですが、一種独特な
雰囲気の表現力があります。光と影の描写にも
見応えがあり、こちらのライトからの影生成もあります。
キャラクターの動きも多彩で丁寧に作られていて
そういうのを作るのが大変だからファーストパーソン
にしているインディゲームのような安っぽさはゼロです。
ただウチだけかもしれませんが設定をどうしても
妙にティアリングが発生する場面がありました。

こうしてほしかったところ
・夜間強制的に外に出なければいけないイベントが
あればよかった
・施設の電源が落ちると一階の（削除された）敵が出現する

試行錯誤しながら答えを見つ出すADV部分とサバイバル部分
味のあるビジュアル、丁寧な作りのキャラクター挙動
黒い敵との攻防の面白さ、意外な展開のエンディング。
超低価格のゲームでありながらUnityアセット切り貼りゲーム
ではないしっかりとした作りで、僕はなかなか気骨のある
隠れた良作アクションADVではと思いました。
物体Xファンの人にもおすすめです。

If you're going to throw more than the standard three meters , health, mana, stamina / hunger, please, for the love of god explain indiciate what they are for. 

Issues that can be solved with a Tutorial.
-Whatever half the meters do.
-How to put away items.  For those that don't know, hit tab, select the item she's currently holding to put it away.
-How to use items. Most items are used the moment you pick them up, the rest go into your inventory.
-How to inspect items.


Right out the literal gate, there's no info given.

User interface/ controll issues.
-No option to change resolution.
-No option to run in a window. 
-Blender Launcher. Holy crap. I use blender for my own projects and it causes some sort of weird hangup on my system.  It ight be just me though.
-No crosshair option. Good gravy.  Adventure/ Point and Click Games need crosshair options.

Начну я свое повествование о данной игре с положительного.
В данной игре , из положительного , присутствуют :
- Не кинематографичная , но приятная игровая графика. 
- Интересный и разнообразный игровой процесс , включающий в себя "" крафт "" , изучение игрового мира , сбор предметов и контроль всех показателей главной героини.
- Удобное управление , к которому можно быстро привыкнуть. 
- Игровая атмосфера , которая создается за счет звукового сопровождения.
- Большой игровой мир , представляющий из себя 1-ый этаж , гараж и подвал научной станции "" Арктика "" , а так же некоторую территорию вокруг данной станции снаружи. Перемещение между локациями осуществляется моментально , без загрузок.
- Высокий уровень сложности , который нельзя изменить , а к которому нужно приспособиться. То возможно. 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695953626
- Наличие русского и английского языка.


Теперь , перейдем к тому , что мне не понравилось в данной игре.
А мне не понравилось :
- Не великое множество игровой музыки , из-за чего имеющиеся мелодии надоедают довольно быстро.
- Недостаточная интерактивность мира данной игры , как мне показалось.
- Артефакты могут не появляться , как было замечено во время игры. С целью подтверждения того , попытался пройти данную игру вновь. То было тщетно , однако это доказать я для себя смог.
- Конец игры не смог ничего объяснить , к великому сожалению.
- При длительной игровой сессии , игровой процесс может начать надоедать.

Моя оценка оценка данной игре: 6/10.
Игру данную к покупке рекомендую. Стоимость игры окупается приятным и интересным , пусть и иногда надоедающим , игровым процессом. Ситуация со звуками и мелодиями удовлетворительна.

Oyun Hakkında: 

Arctic Alive, Kutuplarda bir tesiste geçen korku-survival türündeki oyun. Oyunda kutuplarda yer alan tesisde bir hücreye kapatılmış şekilde başlıyoruz. Hücreden dışarı çıkmamız etrafımızı keşfetmemiz ile maceraya koyuluyoruz. Oyunda çok ilerlemeden bu tesisde yanlız olmadığımızı garip doğa üstü yaratıkların olduğunu görüyoruz.

Oyun Ağırlıklı olarak survival ve korku öğeleri içeriyor. Açlık, susuzluk, soğuk, sıcak hatta tuvalet ihtiyacı, mutluluk gibi pek çok kalem var. Bunlar bir survival oyun için çok güzel. Fakat, uygulaması ne yazık ki çok iyi değil. Yani düşünce güzel ama uygulama kötü.

Önce Mekaniklerden Bahsetmek istiyorum. Oyunu Third Person Bakış açısıyla oynuyoruz. Buraya kadar normal. Fakat grafikler yeterli düzeyde olsa da cisimler, karakterler ve özellikle kontrol ettiğimiz karakter çok yapay hareket ediyor, gerçeklik hissi ne yazık ki çok kötü. yürümek koşmak oldukça yapay.

Yukarıda bahsettiğim survival öğeleri teoride çok güzel. Fakat karakterimiz 7 derecede üşümeye başlıyor, üşümesi de anında hapşurma şeklinde ifade ediliyor ve yaklaşık 20 saniye sonra ölüyor. Tamam oyun survival öğeleri taşısın, soğuktan korunmak için yol arıyalım da, böyle bir hipotermi bence hiç gerçekçi değil. Hele 7 dereceyken sıcaklık.

Yine, oyunda pek çok öğe toplayabiliyoruz, fakat o kadar çok şeyi nereye koyuyoruz belli değil. Çantamız vs. olmadan da bir çok eşya alabiliyoruz.

Bir de ne olduklarını çözemediğim lateks giyisili bir adam var. Adam dediğime bakmayın yerden böyle karanlıktan çıkıyor dışarı, bizi öldürüyor. Bizi görünce öldürüyor ama yanından sessizce geçersek, bizi görse bile öldürmüyor. Bu anlamda hikaye de çok zayıf. Oyun boyunca bulduğumuz bir kaç günlük parçası yeterince karşılamıyor oyuna sizi. Biz nerdeyiz? Ne yapıyoruz? O Yaratık ne? gibi pek çok soru havada kalıyor.

Genelde oyunlara kötü oy vermeyi sevmem fakat bu oyun bir erken erişim oyunu değil. Erken erişim olsaydı bu hataları düzeltme şansı epey olurdu fakat şu haliyle ne yazık ki olmamış bir oyun. Kötü değil, ama olmamış.",1455291469,1455291469,False,6,1,0.602623283863067627,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First, it does have some minor bugs that I'll overlook. I kinda like the twitching shadow monsters.

Second, there needs to be a tutuorial to teach you certain things about the game mechanics. The badly translated diary pages don't help. G-translate could've done a better job. Everything you need is in the game but it's not a ""simulation"" game if I have to figure out how to change my clothes. Or that the game makes you think the heroine needs an antidepresant prescription.

Third, stealth is there. I kinda like it but it could've been better. 

Forth, the story is weak. I watched the trailer after playing the game for 6hrs. Now, i don't want to play because the supposed goal is in the trailer and now i'm not interested in the ending of the game. I'll do it for my viewers but there needs to be an explanation for English speakers to understand.

I am very impressed with the survival/simulation aspect of the game. Very in depth and involved. Gotta stay warm and fed and use the bathroom. Get some sleep. That's all good. I'll give a tip to all you players. You don't need antidepresants. Just a hot bath, clean clothes, a nap, food/water, a good evac, maybe play some tunes and you'll be a happy camper. 

I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. In my not-so humble opinion, this game is still in alpha. Biggest reason is for the less than poorly translated texts. Next, the weak story, which could be attributed to the bad translation. Third, would be the lack of tutorial for a non-user-friendly simulation/survival system. This can also be attributed to the bad translation because I've noticed now, some of the text is suposed to be instructions and hints. It took me a while to figure out what was being said about the bears. My biggest complaint is not that you have to find warmer clothes... just that it took me a day of real time to figure out how to change my clothes.

OK. I'm done. I will finish this game because it seems that my viewers want it. This is a skeleton of a potentially good game.",1454977933,1454977933,False,8,2,0.52947080135345459,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Okay, so the English is a little shaky.  But I'm intrigued by this game.  You're in an Artic outpost and your task is to survive.  And then...came....the bugs.

It's a problem that I can't put the diary page down.  You find it, you read it....and then you're carrying it in front of your face for the rest of whatever.  The problem is, you can't interact with any other objects when you have the diary page in front of your face.  And you have to choose -- do you want to read the diary and then doom the rest of your game to nothing?  Or not read the diary and therefore miss some probable relevant information?

The interface is rusty, I can't figure out how to plant seeds, water them, and grow them.  And then there's the enemy -- the black blog that morphs into the form of a human who quickly snaps your neck.  But I am compelled to play this game!

I don't know what it is -- the environment isn't particularly interesting -- it's like the movie ""The Thing"" without any supporting cast.  And yet, the concept is alluring -- how am I going to survive in the Artic?

So here's the deal -- DEVELOPER, fix the bugs and I will return.  You have something intriguing here.

ตอนแรกก็แบบเคืองอะ ตัวบ้าอะไรก็ไม่รู้ไล่หักคอ
หลัง ๆ มารู้ทริก สับขาหลอกแบบดิจิตอลมาได้ (แต่ก็ยังโดนหักคอนับไม่ถ้วน)
วิ่งหนีตัวประหลาดอะไรไม่รู้ยังไม่พอ ออกมาข้างนอกเจอหมีอีกค่าาา ก็ปีนต้นไม้หนีไปดิ

เล่นไปด่าไป รู้ตัวอีกทีเล่นมา 3 ชั่วโมง โอ้คุณพระะะะ จะขอคืนเงินก็ไม่ทันละ 
เป็นเกมที่ ว๊อทเดอะฟัคมาก ๆ แต่มันก็แค่ 99 บาทน่ะนะ
ใครอยากลองสัมผัสประสบการณ์เอาตัวรอดสยองขวัญ ลองซื้อมาโดน

ข้อเสียที่เห็นได้ชัดคือเกมแปลภาษาอังกฤษออกมาได้งงยิ่งกว่าใช้กูเกิ้ลทรานสเลท เผลอ ๆ มันก็กูเกิ้ลทรานสเลทมาจริง ๆ
เย้ะเม้ะ อ่านไม่รู้เรื่องเลยค่า หวังว่าในอนาคตคงจะมีอัพเดทอีกนะะะะะ

A very unique, engaging story. One of the reasons I love indie games is that they are almost always unique. 

If you're a casual you would definitely not like Arctic Alive. It can be a bit difficult. I died over 50 times .

The graphics are actually pretty good too, not typical for an indie game. I was really engaged by the main character, despite the lack of information revealed about her. Mysterious.

Okay, so maybe it's not in quite the same league as Deadly Premonition - since that one was wilfully weird and this one is, for the most part, just bafflingly incompetent - but there's far more to this mystery than a quick glimpse of the Store page can possibly communicate.  Let me first attempt to explain the ""gameplay"" and/or ""story"" to you...
 
   In Arctic alive (capital A, small A), you play a borderline emotionless, quite possibly ""bipolar"" woman who needs constant anti-depressants to cope with the curious predicament she finds herself in, and is so inconsolable in her isolated loneliness that she chooses to die of hypothermia rather than try on a BLOUSE (!) which she finds in a hallway closet.  Serves her right, really, for being in the arctic wearing a skimpy, skin-tight black latex costume, but I guess it DOES make her look all Jennifer Lopez from behind.  I mean, you've gotta get your priorities straight, even in a desperate life-or-death situation, am I right?

   Anyway, so little Ms Sexy Bottom awakens, without any explanation, in a small cage-like partition of a room which is presumably meant to serve as her prison cell, in spite of the fact that the fence of said cage ends about two-thirds of the way up to the ceiling and her captors have generously provided her with a chair to easily hop over it.  First brain-bending puzzle...CONQUERED!  

   The next puzzle is HOW TO PUT AWAY A MAP OR NOTE after you pick it up to look at it.  The only method I found for getting said items out of my hands and into my inventory was to use one of the food or medicinal items already in said inventory...fortunately, my survive-o-meter for hunger is already dropping, so it's not a complete waste, and speaking of such meters...did I mention there's one with the symbol of a TOILET?!  I fortunately didn't get far enough into the game to explore how THAT particular game mechanic works, but I'm sure it's a bit of an eye-opener (then again, she ""eats"" by just pushing foodstuffs in front of her face, whereupon they just magically disappear with a munching sound, so perhaps she goes potty in an equally visually - alas, not aurally? - petite manner).

   In any case, she soon enough enters a corridor where a spooky figure forms out of a black puddle on the ground, before promptly proceeding to walk up and snap her neck.  No weapon in her hand yet, and no expression on her face as she dies such a horrible death.  As I alluded to above, I think she WANTS to die.  But just in case you don't share her feelings, searching a different area before braving this one will find you a note which suggests that you should stay still when he's looking at you, and herein lies one of the game's few genuinely creepy features...as it's very surreal indeed to stand perfectly still while Mr Red Eyes walks straight up to you and stares you in the face, practically DARING you to move so much as a muscle, before casually strolling on.  It's quite an effective touch, really...made all the more surreal by the fact that you're quite possibly SNEEZING (""a-choo!"") from imminent hypothermia as he does so...

   I did eventually find the whole trying-to-make-some-progress-without-him-noticing shtick so borderline impossible that I eventually just RAN straight for the nearest door, because wouldn't you know it...Mr Red Eyes can't follow you through doors.  Thank fucking fuck for that, or I wouldn't have even made it to the sixth or seventh room in the game.

   I managed to achieve a few other things in the short time that I humoured this...let's be kind, and say somewhat ""underdeveloped"" product.  I managed to turn off a generator (to what effect I'm not sure, but hey, it IS a horror-adventure game), and I also managed to pick up a whole tonne of other possibly useful stuff, but alas...no weapon and no useable toilets.  Oh, and if you see a black puddle of goo that DOESN'T instantly morph into an obsidian-black gent with red eyes, I wouldn't advise trying to walk over it, as it insta-kills you for no apparent reason whatsoever.

   Now, the Store page eloquently describes this as ""a simulator with elements of survival horror"".  It doesn't tell us WHAT it's a simulator of, and as for ""elements"" of survival horror...well, call me crazy, but I'm not sure having your neck snapped by a supernatural entity multiple times in the first ten minutes of gameplay exactly qualifies as the ""simulator"" component of the game's description (unless it's meant to be a ""getting-your-neck-snapped-by-supernatural-entities"" simulator, in which case, it is most assuredly the quintessential game of its type).  But wait, I still haven't mentioned the single most curious aspect of this game, which is...

   Despite the fact that this game bears almost all the hallmarks of a cheaply-made, unimaginatively-whipped-up horror game made on an engine like Unity or Unreal, it ISN'T a first-person game, and it ACTUALLY DOES LOOK LIKE all the rather spiffy screenshots and videos on the Store page!  So this presumably wasn't made by someone who has no idea about either good gameplay or coding...as they'd actually appear to know a little about the latter, at least!  So if Dima Kiva ever learns anything about, y'know, logical storytelling and workable gameplay mechanics, he or she may actually be capable of making a pretty good game one day!  

   It's certainly been a surreal experience, I can tell you that.  I'm used to horror games these days being either really excellent, kinda decent, or just flat-out steaming DOG POOP.  This is none of those things.  It's closer to the kind of bog-standard incompetence you might have expected years ago, before anyone had heard of things like Steam Greenlight, for example.  Which is to say...it COULD almost pass for ""professional"" product, at least until you actually make the mistake of PLAYING the fucking thing.  From that point onward, Jonesy is most definitely out of the bag, hissing and feral and ready to claw your face clean off.  

   Who knows, maybe this will even be knocked into some kind of shape that one could deem vaguely ""playable"" sometime in the future?  Stranger things have happened.  In the meantime, I shall be sure to hold my breath until I'm as blue in the face as a victim of, well, hypothermia (bear with me here, trying my best to remain topical)...
