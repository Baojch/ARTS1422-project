The game launches but the graphics aren't rendered, you just get a big white screen instead.  This obviously renders the game unplayable, so right off the bat, buyer beware.  This didn't work for me, and it may not work for you. 

This game has been translated from some other language into English... badly.  If this was done through Google Translate, Google Translate should feel ashamed of itself.  Regardless, the language in this game is broken and will put off a lot of gamers.

Gameplay itself is a confused mess (if you can even get it to work).  It's trying to be a survival/crafting/adventure/RPG/stealth/horror mystery game and it fails hard on all these attempts.  It might have been better to do one thing well instead of a dozen things badly.  Disclaimer, obviously, this information about the game is accurate but it is second hand, I had to watch a lot of videos to get the gist of the gameplay because of the broken nature of the game. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the video game library/engine, Blender Game Engine.  It's rarely used, because it's arguably worse than construction kits like GameMaker Studio, RPGMaker and Clickteam Fusion, but it's also much harder to work with.  Despite this, Blender Game Engine has very limited capabilities, which go some way to explaining the poor quality of the game.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.  In fact, the Blender engine is so bad it was abandoned many years ago by Blender themselves, because they knew just how bad it is.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a modest spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Because the game is broken and unplayable for me, it may also not work for other gamers.  This is a solid reason to approach this game with some skepticism.

This game features a number of suspicious, likely fake positive reviews. The reviews all appear at almost exactly the same time, very shortly after the game launched on Steam, all have a direct Steam purchase of the game, and all have very similar wording and writing style.  Immediately after this huge peak of reviews, reviews (and player counts) for the game dropped incredibly sharply.  This is highly unusual given the very low quality of the game and poor player counts.  The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be taken with a large grain of salt.This might have been done to deceive/mislead gamers into paying for a bad product.  The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be taken with a large grain of salt.

So, should you buy this game?

""Arctic alive"" is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

This is the sort of game that 'polarises' opinons (see what I did there?)

But joking aside, it really does. The game attempts to do many things for its low cost - however at the same time it doesn't quite succeed. There is limited crafting, as well as stealth, combat and survival. however some could accuse the game of being excessive in its attempt. 

A good example is the survival elements. The basics are there such as eating and drinking - but there is also washing, going to the toilet and even having to clean your clothes. This does lead to the feeling of a lot of busy work that really is not welcome when trying to survive.  All of this uses water which needs to be pumped into a tank meaning you have to run back to the pump room to pump even more water. 

And finally there is the stealth and combat. Both feel somewhat cumbersome as even the slightest movement will have the AI torpedo straight to you, but the AI itself moves in a somewhat random motion, leading to inevitable death. Once you finally have a weapon if you 'kill' the AI it turns into a sort of black puddle - which also will kill you on touch. However often this puddle is now blocking the path you need to take. So you need to wait for it to reform then try and kill it again, just somewhere it does not block your movement. 

Graphically the game is fairly ugly in all honesty but at least the controls are smooth, and the performance is good. 

With that all said - I actually like the game, despite the issues. In fact if anything I wish the game went on longer, as it is on the short side. 

So I applaud the game for trying to do a lot, and also for being a genuine indy game and not the usual asset flip - but be warned the game has a lot of rough edges, and it will test the patience of even the most patient saint.",1511204640,1511204640,True,4,0,0.534599423408508301,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Once she escapes she must survive and also find out what is going on inside and outside of the arctic base. That's about all I'm going to say without spoiling anything else about this game.

You will have to survive and live as long as you can while figuring out the mystery of the arctic by investigating and reading left behind journal articles. You also have to take care of her by showering, eating, drinking, using the bathroom, etc. 

All in all this game is pretty unique and a really nice change from playing AAA games. The only cons I have for this game is the english translation can be better and there's a game crashing bug where if you try to change into the jacket outfit, the whole game goes on but the screen is all black. Do I recommend this game? Definitely worth a try and it's price is really low (even better if you buy it when it goes on sale).",1496169905,1496169905,True,4,0,0.561646103858947754,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're going to throw more than the standard three meters , health, mana, stamina / hunger, please, for the love of god explain indiciate what they are for. 

Issues that can be solved with a Tutorial.
-Whatever half the meters do.
-How to put away items.  For those that don't know, hit tab, select the item she's currently holding to put it away.
-How to use items. Most items are used the moment you pick them up, the rest go into your inventory.
-How to inspect items.


Right out the literal gate, there's no info given.

User interface/ controll issues.
-No option to change resolution.
-No option to run in a window. 
-Blender Launcher. Holy crap. I use blender for my own projects and it causes some sort of weird hangup on my system.  It ight be just me though.
-No crosshair option. Good gravy.  Adventure/ Point and Click Games need crosshair options.

Oyun Hakkƒ±nda: 

Arctic Alive, Kutuplarda bir tesiste ge√ßen korku-survival t√ºr√ºndeki oyun. Oyunda kutuplarda yer alan tesisde bir h√ºcreye kapatƒ±lmƒ±≈ü ≈üekilde ba≈ülƒ±yoruz. H√ºcreden dƒ±≈üarƒ± √ßƒ±kmamƒ±z etrafƒ±mƒ±zƒ± ke≈üfetmemiz ile maceraya koyuluyoruz. Oyunda √ßok ilerlemeden bu tesisde yanlƒ±z olmadƒ±ƒüƒ±mƒ±zƒ± garip doƒüa √ºst√º yaratƒ±klarƒ±n olduƒüunu g√∂r√ºyoruz.

Oyun Aƒüƒ±rlƒ±klƒ± olarak survival ve korku √∂ƒüeleri i√ßeriyor. A√ßlƒ±k, susuzluk, soƒüuk, sƒ±cak hatta tuvalet ihtiyacƒ±, mutluluk gibi pek √ßok kalem var. Bunlar bir survival oyun i√ßin √ßok g√ºzel. Fakat, uygulamasƒ± ne yazƒ±k ki √ßok iyi deƒüil. Yani d√º≈ü√ºnce g√ºzel ama uygulama k√∂t√º.

√ñnce Mekaniklerden Bahsetmek istiyorum. Oyunu Third Person Bakƒ±≈ü a√ßƒ±sƒ±yla oynuyoruz. Buraya kadar normal. Fakat grafikler yeterli d√ºzeyde olsa da cisimler, karakterler ve √∂zellikle kontrol ettiƒüimiz karakter √ßok yapay hareket ediyor, ger√ßeklik hissi ne yazƒ±k ki √ßok k√∂t√º. y√ºr√ºmek ko≈ümak olduk√ßa yapay.

Yukarƒ±da bahsettiƒüim survival √∂ƒüeleri teoride √ßok g√ºzel. Fakat karakterimiz 7 derecede √º≈ü√ºmeye ba≈ülƒ±yor, √º≈ü√ºmesi de anƒ±nda hap≈üurma ≈üeklinde ifade ediliyor ve yakla≈üƒ±k 20 saniye sonra √∂l√ºyor. Tamam oyun survival √∂ƒüeleri ta≈üƒ±sƒ±n, soƒüuktan korunmak i√ßin yol arƒ±yalƒ±m da, b√∂yle bir hipotermi bence hi√ß ger√ßek√ßi deƒüil. Hele 7 dereceyken sƒ±caklƒ±k.

Yine, oyunda pek √ßok √∂ƒüe toplayabiliyoruz, fakat o kadar √ßok ≈üeyi nereye koyuyoruz belli deƒüil. √áantamƒ±z vs. olmadan da bir √ßok e≈üya alabiliyoruz.

Bir de ne olduklarƒ±nƒ± √ß√∂zemediƒüim lateks giyisili bir adam var. Adam dediƒüime bakmayƒ±n yerden b√∂yle karanlƒ±ktan √ßƒ±kƒ±yor dƒ±≈üarƒ±, bizi √∂ld√ºr√ºyor. Bizi g√∂r√ºnce √∂ld√ºr√ºyor ama yanƒ±ndan sessizce ge√ßersek, bizi g√∂rse bile √∂ld√ºrm√ºyor. Bu anlamda hikaye de √ßok zayƒ±f. Oyun boyunca bulduƒüumuz bir ka√ß g√ºnl√ºk par√ßasƒ± yeterince kar≈üƒ±lamƒ±yor oyuna sizi. Biz nerdeyiz? Ne yapƒ±yoruz? O Yaratƒ±k ne? gibi pek √ßok soru havada kalƒ±yor.

Genelde oyunlara k√∂t√º oy vermeyi sevmem fakat bu oyun bir erken eri≈üim oyunu deƒüil. Erken eri≈üim olsaydƒ± bu hatalarƒ± d√ºzeltme ≈üansƒ± epey olurdu fakat ≈üu haliyle ne yazƒ±k ki olmamƒ±≈ü bir oyun.

First, it does have some minor bugs that I'll overlook. I kinda like the twitching shadow monsters.

Second, there needs to be a tutuorial to teach you certain things about the game mechanics. The badly translated diary pages don't help. G-translate could've done a better job. Everything you need is in the game but it's not a ""simulation"" game if I have to figure out how to change my clothes. Or that the game makes you think the heroine needs an antidepresant prescription.

Third, stealth is there. I kinda like it but it could've been better. 

Forth, the story is weak. I watched the trailer after playing the game for 6hrs. Now, i don't want to play because the supposed goal is in the trailer and now i'm not interested in the ending of the game. I'll do it for my viewers but there needs to be an explanation for English speakers to understand.

I am very impressed with the survival/simulation aspect of the game. Very in depth and involved. Gotta stay warm and fed and use the bathroom. Get some sleep. That's all good. I'll give a tip to all you players. You don't need antidepresants. Just a hot bath, clean clothes, a nap, food/water, a good evac, maybe play some tunes and you'll be a happy camper. 

I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. In my not-so humble opinion, this game is still in alpha. Biggest reason is for the less than poorly translated texts. Next, the weak story, which could be attributed to the bad translation. Third, would be the lack of tutorial for a non-user-friendly simulation/survival system. This can also be attributed to the bad translation because I've noticed now, some of the text is suposed to be instructions and hints. It took me a while to figure out what was being said about the bears. My biggest complaint is not that you have to find warmer clothes... just that it took me a day of real time to figure out how to change my clothes.

OK. I'm done. I will finish this game because it seems that my viewers want it. This is a skeleton of a potentially good game.",1454977933,1454977933,False,8,2,0.52947080135345459,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Okay, so the English is a little shaky.  But I'm intrigued by this game.  You're in an Artic outpost and your task is to survive.  And then...came....the bugs.

It's a problem that I can't put the diary page down.  You find it, you read it....and then you're carrying it in front of your face for the rest of whatever.  The problem is, you can't interact with any other objects when you have the diary page in front of your face.  And you have to choose -- do you want to read the diary and then doom the rest of your game to nothing?  Or not read the diary and therefore miss some probable relevant information?

The interface is rusty, I can't figure out how to plant seeds, water them, and grow them.  And then there's the enemy -- the black blog that morphs into the form of a human who quickly snaps your neck.  But I am compelled to play this game!

I don't know what it is -- the environment isn't particularly interesting -- it's like the movie ""The Thing"" without any supporting cast.  And yet, the concept is alluring -- how am I going to survive in the Artic?

So here's the deal -- DEVELOPER, fix the bugs and I will return.  You have something intriguing here.

Okay, so maybe it's not in quite the same league as Deadly Premonition - since that one was wilfully weird and this one is, for the most part, just bafflingly incompetent - but there's far more to this mystery than a quick glimpse of the Store page can possibly communicate.  Let me first attempt to explain the ""gameplay"" and/or ""story"" to you...
 
   In Arctic alive (capital A, small A), you play a borderline emotionless, quite possibly ""bipolar"" woman who needs constant anti-depressants to cope with the curious predicament she finds herself in, and is so inconsolable in her isolated loneliness that she chooses to die of hypothermia rather than try on a BLOUSE (!) which she finds in a hallway closet.  Serves her right, really, for being in the arctic wearing a skimpy, skin-tight black latex costume, but I guess it DOES make her look all Jennifer Lopez from behind.  I mean, you've gotta get your priorities straight, even in a desperate life-or-death situation, am I right?

   Anyway, so little Ms Sexy Bottom awakens, without any explanation, in a small cage-like partition of a room which is presumably meant to serve as her prison cell, in spite of the fact that the fence of said cage ends about two-thirds of the way up to the ceiling and her captors have generously provided her with a chair to easily hop over it.  First brain-bending puzzle...CONQUERED!  

   The next puzzle is HOW TO PUT AWAY A MAP OR NOTE after you pick it up to look at it.  The only method I found for getting said items out of my hands and into my inventory was to use one of the food or medicinal items already in said inventory...fortunately, my survive-o-meter for hunger is already dropping, so it's not a complete waste, and speaking of such meters...did I mention there's one with the symbol of a TOILET?!  I fortunately didn't get far enough into the game to explore how THAT particular game mechanic works, but I'm sure it's a bit of an eye-opener (then again, she ""eats"" by just pushing foodstuffs in front of her face, whereupon they just magically disappear with a munching sound, so perhaps she goes potty in an equally visually - alas, not aurally? - petite manner).

   In any case, she soon enough enters a corridor where a spooky figure forms out of a black puddle on the ground, before promptly proceeding to walk up and snap her neck.  No weapon in her hand yet, and no expression on her face as she dies such a horrible death.  As I alluded to above, I think she WANTS to die.  But just in case you don't share her feelings, searching a different area before braving this one will find you a note which suggests that you should stay still when he's looking at you, and herein lies one of the game's few genuinely creepy features...as it's very surreal indeed to stand perfectly still while Mr Red Eyes walks straight up to you and stares you in the face, practically DARING you to move so much as a muscle, before casually strolling on.  It's quite an effective touch, really...made all the more surreal by the fact that you're quite possibly SNEEZING (""a-choo!"") from imminent hypothermia as he does so...

   I did eventually find the whole trying-to-make-some-progress-without-him-noticing shtick so borderline impossible that I eventually just RAN straight for the nearest door, because wouldn't you know it...Mr Red Eyes can't follow you through doors.  Thank fucking fuck for that, or I wouldn't have even made it to the sixth or seventh room in the game.

   I managed to achieve a few other things in the short time that I humoured this...let's be kind, and say somewhat ""underdeveloped"" product.  I managed to turn off a generator (to what effect I'm not sure, but hey, it IS a horror-adventure game), and I also managed to pick up a whole tonne of other possibly useful stuff, but alas...no weapon and no useable toilets.  Oh, and if you see a black puddle of goo that DOESN'T instantly morph into an obsidian-black gent with red eyes, I wouldn't advise trying to walk over it, as it insta-kills you for no apparent reason whatsoever.

   Now, the Store page eloquently describes this as ""a simulator with elements of survival horror"".  It doesn't tell us WHAT it's a simulator of, and as for ""elements"" of survival horror...well, call me crazy, but I'm not sure having your neck snapped by a supernatural entity multiple times in the first ten minutes of gameplay exactly qualifies as the ""simulator"" component of the game's description (unless it's meant to be a ""getting-your-neck-snapped-by-supernatural-entities"" simulator, in which case, it is most assuredly the quintessential game of its type).  But wait, I still haven't mentioned the single most curious aspect of this game, which is...

   Despite the fact that this game bears almost all the hallmarks of a cheaply-made, unimaginatively-whipped-up horror game made on an engine like Unity or Unreal, it ISN'T a first-person game, and it ACTUALLY DOES LOOK LIKE all the rather spiffy screenshots and videos on the Store page!  So this presumably wasn't made by someone who has no idea about either good gameplay or coding...as they'd actually appear to know a little about the latter, at least!  So if Dima Kiva ever learns anything about, y'know, logical storytelling and workable gameplay mechanics, he or she may actually be capable of making a pretty good game one day!  

   It's certainly been a surreal experience, I can tell you that.  I'm used to horror games these days being either really excellent, kinda decent, or just flat-out steaming DOG POOP.  This is none of those things.  It's closer to the kind of bog-standard incompetence you might have expected years ago, before anyone had heard of things like Steam Greenlight, for example.  Which is to say...it COULD almost pass for ""professional"" product, at least until you actually make the mistake of PLAYING the fucking thing.  From that point onward, Jonesy is most definitely out of the bag, hissing and feral and ready to claw your face clean off.  

   Who knows, maybe this will even be knocked into some kind of shape that one could deem vaguely ""playable"" sometime in the future?  Stranger things have happened.  In the meantime, I shall be sure to hold my breath until I'm as blue in the face as a victim of, well, hypothermia (bear with me here, trying my best to remain topical)...
