I picked up this game on sale for about $2 and while it is underdeveloped I do think it is worth grabbing, just not at full price. It's a somewhat original take on the VR rhythm game formula and it mostly plays pretty well.

Major considerations:
The game can play pretty much every song in my music library and I can even play them with friends who don't own those songs themselves. However, if you play a song from your own music library in multiplayer will have to wait for them to download the file from you every time you want to play it even if they do own it and have their own copy.

The game does generate custom beat maps for your own music and there will be moments where can see the beats lining up to the music... But this seems secondary to the game throwing a diverse layout on the drums at you. You have to be playing a pretty high difficulty to feel the rhythm lining up, you can't always tell which instrument track is being used at any given time (and it varies) and different tracks definitely do not coordinate with different parts of the drum set. 

You are only going to be playing multiplayer with friends. The game does not really have a community, let alone an active one. But that's not unusual for VR titles.

There are 5 difficulty levels that can be played in 3 modes: 1 colour, 2 colours & 4 colours. On single colour, we were able to jump to difficulty 4 immediately with no issues. 5 felt a little spastic but I can see it being plausible to get used to it with practice. On 2 colour mode, difficulty 3 was very challenging. 4 colour mode was just awkward even on the lowest difficulties. Part of the problem is you can't pick the colours for each mode and the defaults are a bit stupid (red, magenta, yellow and bright green). So if you are colour blind you are going to be stuck playing songs in single colour mode. This is somewhat true even if you aren't colourblind (but then it's just annoying, not a deal breaker).

There are some pretty poor visual design choices all around really. There is a whole bunch of visual noise assaulting you at all times, from diamonds buzzing around you like flies, an actual noise pattern constantly moving about on the floor and asteroids that will sometimes fly right through you even in the middle of a match. It looks alright initially but eventually, you wish you could turn it all off and stop being distracted by it.

In summary to be clear this is not an amazing product. Or even a good one. But if you can pick it up cheap it does do what it sets out to do somewhat decently. Just manage your expectations. It's not going to compete with audio shield, but it is something you can mix things up a bit with if you audio shield is getting stale.",1521889800,1521889800,True,1,0,0.498257845640182495,0,True,False,False,False,,,

2/5

There are much better VR Rhythm games out there. This one is quite lackluster in many areas especially when compared to other VR titles of the same type. It's a bland Rockband Drummer simulator, the drums are not always Synced up with the music, the backgrounds are quite boring, the delivery method for hitting the drums isn't as good as it could be. 

I think it would be 100% better if they'd make it a ""real"" drumset (Or something like Into the Rythm VR), Change up the delivery method, and allow the background/scenery be more than just some techno-y place (maybe workshop support so people can make their own). For example a garage, auditorium, someplace you'd actually be playing drums in addition to the fantasy/techno-y places.

I'll leave the old review text below the dashes, but obviously the problem no longer exists.

---

Don't get me wrong - I liked what I saw and really wanted to play more of this on my Rift. It has great features such as working with your own music, and lettign you easily raise and lower drum height.

However, the game puts the drums beyond my Oculus guardian barrier, so every time I hit them the guardian wall appears in front of me - really distracting. I tried recalibrating SteamVR as standing only, and chose a location at the back of my play space, but Music Inside still insists on putting the drums beyond the guardian wall. I tried contacting the devs, but no response yet. One easy solution would be making one of the thumbsticks bring the drums forward or back. Or just match the stand location chosen in SteamVR. Until then I hate seeing the guardian wall continually glowing in front of me as I play, so uninstalled it. If this gets fixed I look forward to playing the game for much longer, and introducing my friends to it (and changing this review to a positive).",1509803371,1510175064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

VR opens up so many more possibilities for immersion and music. There are music driven games out there that can really pull you in, and VR has the capability of taking that and pushing it to the next level.

This game is okay. It's not the best, I wouldn't say it's next level material but I did get that hyped-up and happy feeling from playing a few of my favourite songs. Your surroundings are bright, colourful and it dances with your music. I found it fun to even stand and look around, let alone bust out some drum moves.

I won't lie to you, I held back a bit seeing as I was banging  imaginary drums like a moron to no music in the family dining area. If I would have been alone I think I would of gone in on this a lot more enthusiastically and gotten my rave on. With that said though I still found this to be a very enjoyable game.

When I booted up the game I was a little concerned that I would have to download some music for it to go from or be forced to use some lame sample music that music driven games tend to provide. The fun in these games for me comes from being able to put my own music tastes into the game. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can actually pick some music from the SoundCloud top 50 (so of course I had to get on that Despacito bandwagon).

The only thing I thought might make this game better was if hitting the drum actually did something. I mean, it does something, it determines your score and all. I just thought that it would feel a lot better if when you hit it, it actually made a sound. 
If you loosely compare it to guitar hero, in guitar hero the music will play as long as you're playing it properly. Hitting the notes will continue to play the song and if you miss it you get that horrid noise that breaks the flow and makes you feel like the worst musician ever. Then when you actually hit the notes correctly you feel a lot more accomplished and it gets you more hyped up during the song. 

That was my only fault on it, besides that I enjoyed it and would recommend it for someone that might just want a chill jam on the virtual reality drums.


TL;DR : Not the best music driven game ever, it might not take advantage of the new possibilities VR provides, but it's still an all around sound game to jam out on.

Despite owning Audioshield and Soundboxing, Music Inside is the one I've spent the most hours in and keep coming back to.

Pros:
[list]
    [*]Good beat detection.  Some songs work better than others, but on the whole, it's miles better than vanilla Audioshield. 
    [*]Satisfying, addicting gameplay.  The subtle haptics work well for every drum hit, and the grading system encourages you to go back and ace or S-rank every song you can.
    [*]Scalable difficulty.  In addition to 5 difficulty levels (affects how many notes appear), you can also change how many colors will be in play — up to 4 at once — requiring you to toggle between drumsticks with the trigger button.  This game can be a relaxing, casual stroll, or it can be blazingly fast and murdurously difficult.  It scales extremely well based on the settings, so it's up to you!
    [*]Soundcloud support
    [*]Local file support
    [*]A leveling system.  Nothing super important or in depth, but there's a small bit of progression in place for those who want it.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
    [*]No Youtube support.  It's nice that it has Soundcloud support, but it also means you're going to be limited to a lot of mashups, covers, and remixes of songs, instead of originals which can always be found on Youtube.
    [*]Visuals are pretty basic, though all of it pretty much fades once you're invested in a song anyway.  Note: things aren't cluttered and hard to see at all in-game, despite looking messy in the screenshots.  The spacial awareness that VR offers addresses that completely.
    [*]Varying bugs: sometimes crashes after selecting a song, rarely songs will give a ""corrupted"" error requiring a restart, and adding songs to your ""favorites"" list only works if you star it from the main menu, not the post-song screen.

There were times when I felt like I was playing the drums to the music and it felt awesome... but at other times I just felt like I was playing a game of whackamole sort of to the music and times where I wondered if turning the music off might actually help my score as I would no longer be trying to time my hits to the beat.

I think the biggest problem here is that it is a game that is specifically trying to be a drum kit, but it's algorithm can't even tell the difference between a drum hit and vocals or any other instrument. There were times when I was wondering exactly what the game thought I was supposed to be whacking when there were no drums playing at all... Dianne van Giersbergen's vocal chords perhaps? The other rhythm games don't have this issue since they aren't trying to be a specific instrument, so it doesn't matter what they synchronise to so long as it follows the song.

A suggestion on the forums recommends using USB audio for lower latency, but I noticed no significant difference between USB and HDMI audio - when the hits were out it was because the algorithm either missed a beat, or picked something that was not percussion to synchronise to.

If this is supposed to be a drum kit, why are there no cymbals, hi-hats, etc? There are just 10 circles that light up at random with no relationship to the percussion being played, and their placement only vaguely resembles a drum kit. The game does allow you to change the size and spacing between the circles (and they definitely need to be made a little larger than the default), but I can't help but think it would play better if I was sitting in front of an actual virtual drum kit and even better if I could adjust the placement of each instrument independently.

The game frustratingly ignores Steam's designation of which controller is in the left and right hands and offers no way to change the dominant hand. Thing is - I'm right handed along with most of the population, but it kept putting the pointer in my left hand, which was the opposite to what the tutorial was telling me, and the only way I could find to fix it was to take the wrist straps off and swap the controllers around in my hands. Other than that the UI works well and is quite polished - I had no problems navigating the filesystem to find my music, and it had no problem playing my collection of .ogg files :)

The idea is good, the graphics OK, and the gameplay is ok, but I would say that in my opinion the biggest disappointment for me is that hitting the right or wrong note makes no sound.

I feel you should be able to load a drum kit sound or theme and when you hit the right note it plays that noise. A choice to play a ""mistake"" sound if you miss could be added but not important.

I found on the three choices of my music that the drum beats and required hits were not really in synch and I would have achieved a much better score if I turned the volume right down, which would ruin the gameplay though.

This COULD have been the most awesome music game, setting standards and even beating Audio Shield perhaps, but in its current form (which is not early access unfortuntaley, so that's it I guess) I really think it is overpriced and deserves to have a better game come along and topple it from the chart.

I would rate this higher than Audioshield in terms of VR music game. Yes it's graphics are pretty simple, nothing flashy, and a bit hard to start, but I would treat this game as the VOS(if anyone know what that means to the music game genre) for VR MG. 
First the greatest thing about this game is the judgement. A serious music game is not about you hit the note, but hit it precisely on the beat. That's the only way you can feel the rhythm of the music and start to enjoy the game. I'm a heavy Jubeat player and I found Music Inside's judgement (Also the score system) matches Jubeat - which is one of the best music games in history. 
Still there is a ton lot of improvements can be made - which I hope the author doesn't just stop here. I'll skip the UI or graphics part as that's the easiest thing to make a change. Here is my wish list for the upcoming patches: 
1. Animation for Great/Good/Bad, which helps you to find the right pace back. 
2. Keynote sounds. That's a big disappointment that there is no keynote sound. This will improve the feedback further on top of the vibration. We can use different sounds too just like Reflecbeat.
3. Adjustable drum size. I feel the current one's a bit too small, also if we can adjust the space between the drums or even place them where we want would be great. 
4. Most important - The option to play premade charts and a chart editor. The chat generation is brilliant, but given the depth of this game (10 drums and 2+2 switchable colors) it's chaotic at higher levels. I've played a lot of music games that generate charts instead of premade. It's OK at easier levels but when it comes to the top levels, random charts just make the game stupidly unplayable. You can still show the skill and how fast you can move but it defeats the purpose of ""playing"" the music. Good Music + Well designed chart make songs epic. 
5. I'm not sure what's the plan for the tuning switchs at the bottom side, but really wish to see some motion play around them. 

Extremely highly recommended if you are a serious music game player. For casual players I would suggest try to ignore the rough graphics as the system mechanics of this game is best on the market for this genre so far.",1474163425,1474163425,True,3,0,0.476691484451293945,1,True,False,False,False,,,

They fixed the lag when going back from play to music browsing especially with high favourite count. Unfortunately, they haven't fixed the damn sorting of music folders. They added a search feature but it is only searching on the current open folder and will only search for music (not folders).

--------------------------------

Previous Patch review below so you can see how my opinion improved:

Pretty decent note generation. It's far from perfect especially on the hardest difficulty. It's like the game is trying to add more notes just to say it's ""harder"". Anyways Difficulty 3 and 4 is pretty ok, with the exception when the song is near ending and is slowing down. The game is giving you notes that doesn't really properly map on the song. Despite that, game is still pretty fun to play on Diff 3 and 4, maybe you need a slower paced song in diff 5 to make it better.


If you want a song that has decent note generation, it looks like pop and slower genres are preferable. Noisy song like rock and most vocaloid songs are a no-no. Bad note generation on those


There are also some issues that makes this game more annoying for me:

1) Music browser for folders is not sorted properly (not alphabetized). I have 1.6k song folders in my library and I can't fucking browse the music I want easily.

2) Extreme lag when going back from playing the song to music browser. I need to close my eyes a few sec just to prevent getting sick

Because this game is not in early access, I have to put a not recommended right now due to those annoying things that I listed that breaks with the enjoyment of the game. There's also only .mp3 support, so your high quality flac, aac, alac music wont be played

再加上打中了沒有鼓聲，也沒有鼓本體的震動
只有手裡控制器傳來一陣震動
造成這款遊戲玩起來非常的沒有打鼓感

Wow. This one took me by surprise. I almost didn't pick it up but am glad that I did. It's actually pretty fun and with SoundCloud you have a pretty much unlimited number of songs, not to mention the ability to import your own songs. I was able to find Youtube groups like Instalok. Music from The Guild and Jonathan Coulton. The integration with SoundCloud is very well done and while I'm no rhythm game affecianado, it seems to do a decent job. The game was very well done.

Starts off simple enough but can easily get very complex swapping between colors. Progression seems to be based on cosmetic items at the moment with you being able to select stick and note skins. Hope more are on the way at a more varied cost.

There was a little bit of stutter and consistant missed frames in the headset while in the main menu but other than that, it looks well made and fairly well polished. Definitely worth the 19.99. If you're a fan of rhythm games, definitely pick this one up.

Multiplayer would be a nice addition, head to head or coop.

I have noticed though that the game crashes somewhat frequently. It's never happened durring a song or I'd call that gamebreaking. It's usually on a transition and is more of an inconvenience walking over to the PC and clicking submit and restart. You lose about 20 seconds unless you type up a bug report.

这游戏好不好,那肯定是好的,而且耐玩，耐玩不仅体现在可以玩不同的曲子上而是他还有变态的四色5级难度
游戏的音乐可以自己添加,也可以用默认的
最后如果有人用四色五级难度打的很好请留言,让我膜拜一下

我喜欢玩VR也喜欢探索最新的VR游戏，也会用心做好每一个视频
steam是一个要花钱的平台，所以我希望用我的视频让大家能更好的了解每一个游戏
最后，祝大家游戏越快哦~

If you bought a Vive, this is the one of the ""MUST HAVE"" game.

Excellent rhythm game.
I was going to try this game just for 10 minutes before sleep.
but i played 1 hour. this is absolutely nice rhythm game.

pros
rhythm sync is amazing even though notes are autiomatically generated.
(now i can feel F***ING GROOVE!!! on VR rhythm game)
ultra low-latency 
Drum Drum Drum!!! Drum for vr rhythm game is perfect choice.
tons of quality music from soundcloud
difficulty adjustment by changing stick color is brilliant 
controller feedback when hit notes is super cool
unlockables 
IT ROCKS!!

cons
too korean-style alphabet fonts
(will be better with more sleek and modern fonts
especially choice of rounded edge font is the worst, i think)
stage is kind of bland 
(Could have been more dynamic)


VS Audioshield
graphics - Audioshield 
music - Draw
gameplay - Music Inside 

If you like music and have htc vive

JUST BUY IT.",1473189524,1473265259,True,13,0,0.612975060939788818,2,True,False,False,False,,,
