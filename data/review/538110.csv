The only minor issue is that the controllers appear as HTC Vive wands.  But you can figure out what to do.  It also says roomscale, but I played seated without any issues.  Although, you should be seated on a swivel chair to look around 360.  

The experience is 12-15 minutes long, depending on how much you want to look at the details around you.  But in all honesty, I did not enjoy the experience.  It felt like a student project.  I was at least expecting some interesting artwork to look at in VR, but it didn't even have that.  

The story is okay.  The narrated voice did not bother me.  But again, nothing captured my attention.  After 5 minutes, I was just hoping the whole thing would end soon.

General idea for this demo is absolutely great - a very personal, story-driven VR half-interactive psychedelic illustration book. It seems like a very powerful tool to convey ideas and tell stories, but in order to work it needs one thing - it needs to be done with great attention to details. As it is, ""Delia's gift"" is more of a very rough sketch than a complete experience. The art seems more like a placeholder, sound quality is very poor, and many of the story's pages do not have any weight to them.
I am not writing this to discourage you Cabbio, as I said - I absolutely admire your work, but as I said, I believe it needs much more polish to really work in I way I imagine you designed it for. The story could have much more impact if accompanied by a more fleshed out scenery. I mean, if the story is really that personal to you - take more time it and give it more LOVE:)
