K Station is a fun and nifty little adventure game that will give you a good few hours of entertainment, all depending on how good you are at solving puzzles. The game isn't for everybody, I think it's important to state that right from the get-go. It'll mostly please gamers that enjoy old-school adventure games, and even more so if you like games where you type commands to interact with everyone and everything in the game world. But I don't fall into any of those groups and still enjoyed it, so there's that.

Pros
Maya (the character you play) is hands down the best thing about the game, her personality and snarky comments gives life to the game in a way that nothing else can. I found myself wanting more of Maya after I had finished the game.
Then there's the art style, the simplistic pixel art fits well with the game and allows it to look good and simplistic at the same time. Another pro is the puzzles, a few of them really had me running around for a good while before I managed to solve them, and the feeling you get when finally solving the hard ones is satisfying. Then there's the ones where you've missed the obvious and feel like a complete idiot afterwards, they'll give you a good laugh afterwards. 

Cons
The art style, yeah, I know, I've already covered this in the pros, but bear with me... I'm talking about the colours, I would have wanted to see more saturated colours being utilised, the levels feel a bit dull with the washed-out colours. It's supposed to be a space station in the future, the colours don't do it justice ;(
Then there's the soundtrack, it has some good bits, don't get me wrong, but the majority of it fits too well with the washed-out colours, giving the world a dull feel. I guess playing your own music in the background isn't too hard (Spotify, iTunes, etc...), but still.
I guess it's only fair to cover the games length as well. I would have wanted it to last a bit longer, maybe 2-3 more levels at least; maybe it's just my longing for more Maya speaks for this :/

Conclusion
Taking both the pros and cons into account, you'd probably have a good time playing K Station. The pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. Everything that has to do with the actual gameplay is solid. It's more or less the aesthetics and sound that falls a bit short.

Final Thoughts
Seeing as this is the developer's first game, and that it was only developed by a single person, all in just over a year, I'd consider it a great game. Kudos to him.

The game started out pretty good because there seemed to be a mystery that needed solving... but as you progress you realise you're no closer to knowing why you're being asked to go back 'n' forth doing dumb things (the chess quest, for instance, was a terrible waste of time that yielded absolutely ZERO reward), and you have no idea what the end-goal is.

K Station is a text parser adventure game with a simple graphical art style. The parser in this game is very barebones, and pretty strict in its limitations, but it is effective.  Overall, the game feels a bit like a low-budget but high-concept arthouse indie film presented in an adventure game format.

The game looks like a very straightforward sci-fi setpiece at first.  We are a scientist on what appears to be some sort of a Martian research base - a pretty nice one, too, with a library, well-appointed labs, a full cafeteria, and even a classroom full of children.  One day, you learn about some sort of gravitational anomaly outside.  When you exit the station to investigate, something strange happens.

Very soon, the game takes a few hard left turns, and the end result is a strange and unsettling game that is groundhog day with a heavy dash of danganronpa and a pinch of time travel.
