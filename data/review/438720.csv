Heroes of Shadow Guard minimizes that to a first-person, claustrophobic dungeon crawler, where the longer you take to navigate literal labyrinths means more encounters to drain your health, mana, and items.

I originally thought to write this off, but came back to it on a whim and now realize how complex this game really is.  I didn’t appreciate it until I invested the time and head knowledge to really understand the gameplay.

Yes, it’s a mobile port.  Who cares?!  It’s very deep for a mobile game and not at all as simple as it looks.  You can play it very simply: apply XP potions, auto-equip better gear, instantly complete unlocked quests, let the computer run your battles for you.  Most daily bonuses take a few minutes of your day and provide many bonuses and rewards.  You can slowly rise your party to sufficient power to a point you just auto-resolve every encounter with ease.

Or, you can go hardcore, nitpicking which Gems to apply 4% bonuses to, max out specific skills, mix and match Pets between party members, swap out Heroes to evenly distribute XP earned.  You can fight tooth and nail wading through enemy players’ mazes, scraping by to maximize rank points.

Completing a labyrinth is often no easy task.  It requires lots of concentration to minimize steps (thus minimizing number of encounters).  I frequently find myself frantically rushing the final chest, one-shotting the boss with a javelin, and completing the maze.  Staying and grinding is a huge risk to your success.

I feel like a lot of balancing is warranted, but it doesn’t bother me a lot.  Just because you have access to the strongest items doesn’t make them viable for low-level players: they’ll drain your Gold sooner or later.  The $3, 100 premium currency daily for a month is a steal, and I’m not complaining; it’s another great reason to log in and check dailies.  The shield (preventing other players from raiding you) is reset every day and after every time you’re raided; probably also needs balance, but I’m still not complaining.

Heroes of Shadow Guard strikes a special mix of casualness and involvement.  The amount of time you spend grinding and customizing labyrinths is a lot longer than you’d think.  The amount of time you spend just checkin’ in for daily rewards is appropriately short.  There’s a world of complexity waiting for proper capitalization.  Ignore the plain visuals: this game has a lot to offer for the low price of “free.”",1502412021,1502412021,True,6,0,0.554952502250671387,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Game has some balance issues, but that could be ironed out reasonably quickly.

Just throwing this out there because I know a lot of people hate mobile ports like the 2nd coming of Satan.
The game is mediocre which isn't a bad thing because it does have a good idea however...

[url]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/263844100806115112/F21B7C379E412C57210082EB2197B21A6E60819A/[/url]

There are a lot of bugs and without explaining every single bug you will find I will warn you about one of the earlier ones that will crash your game which is being idle/afk. If you decide to go out for awhile and leave the game running or even take a poo, the game will crash. What is supposed to happen is that the game logs you out. Why? Because its a mobile port. When this doesn't work as intended, for example, you are in a shop menu, the game just crashes.

Even looking past the crashes however the game is a bit boring. Fun is there, to be had, but the shackles of mobile gaming hang around your neck in all its usual ""glory"". Having a good time? Well you have run out of ""energy"" and now you need to either spend more cash money or wait until the game says you can play it again.

Then there are rules in the game such as that you need to level up your minions. Failure to do so makes your dungeon an easy target. The level up system has a bug in it so it will take more credits than it says it will. Sorry, I did say I would [i]stop[/i] talking about the bugs didn't I.

Then there is the crafting system, repeat after me ""obtain x, y, z ingredients and then upgrade your items"" because that is the only way that crafting works.

I did have fun with the game, its a nice dungeon crawler and if you like Etrian oddyssy...You might want to enjoy this like I did. There is hope for the game if it makes itself closer to a PC game and further from a bland mobile port, it does have a future in a niche market but the keyword is ""if"".

Pros:

- First person dungeon crawling, with multible Heroes of different classes and skills.
- Creating your own lab for people to try and raid. 
- Gear and weapon crafting.
- Cross platform.

Cons:

- Low resolution on certain things in game.
- Finding bugs (but it just came out, so I'm sure they will be fixed).
