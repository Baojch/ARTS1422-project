I'm writing this to see if maybe I might reconnect with people during my time in Fiesta Online. So here's my story:

My username was fernandez154(level 36 fighter), halo117(Level 90 something cleric). I was part of the CBT and had my title of Closed Beta Tester that I was proud of wearing throughout my journey. I started off in the Teva server I believe, creating a guild called CBT. I founded this guild with the same purpose as anyone with creating a guild. Later on, I found out about pking in those locked range level dungeons (1 to 36 or so). I turned my guild into a PKing guild, creating a huge impact in the pking community in those dungeons. I then created an army, that invited others to compete against my guild, experiencing so much wars (I had a blast). Even got those endgame players to create a community to go against me. It was fun being basically ""infamous"". I was enjoying this concept so much that I even went to another server and attempted to bring the majority of my guildmates in CBT to invade those same dungeons in that server, I think it was called Epith? And I called it EoT (Exiles of Teva). Get it? HAHA We'd have our username with the EoT tag infront of it, just ravaging those dungeons. Of course it didn't last long since we had to start fresh and I believe Epith had a lot of charmers than other servers. But if anyone remembers this journey, either fighting against or alongside me, let's get reconnected! This was the first mmorpg that I invested quite a lot of my time during my teenagehood. And I'm actually planning on taking Throne & Liberty seriously as I did with Fiesta Online back then. So let's get reconnected, whether to just catch up, or if you're interested in joining with me in my adventures in the upcoming Throne & Liberty! 

Thank you Fiesta Online for all the amazing memories!",1707087539,1707087539,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Now its probably known that this game is P2W, excessively so. Between charms for a 20%, 50%, etc limited use cash shop item to increase your overall stats, (health, mana, mount speeds etc...) to play this game without spending money I believe is insane. It is worth a try, only for the novelty of experiencing a game from the past, that is still running, but don't make this your primary game, you can lose experience upon death, (not a bad thing early on) however you CAN purchase an item from the cash shop to prevent this. 

In the lower levels you wont notice the major flaws in experience and pacing, but there are deadzones in the leveling brackets. to my memory, its the upper 30's, 45-60, 85+. I only personally leveled to 105, and that was a struggle. The 90-100 bracket was 1 single repeatable quest, (not counting the single turn ins, which amounted to maybe 1-2 levels total) which rewards a whopping 1% exp. They have done a few changes like being able to turn in repeatable quests in the field, instead of warping to town turning in, and spending 10 minutes riding back, and hoping the lag at times won't get you killed, and lose the 1% exp you just earned. (happens frequently).

TLDR: its a fun game to try, don't spend money on it, its not worth it. don't try to be a solo player, bring friends, its much better in a group.

(power level a mage, dont bother using skill points in pre 60 mage skills, they stop getting ranks after 55~)
points in SPR increase critical rate, -BUT ONLY IN CHARACTER POINTS-. Some enemies can be staggered with crit hits, for 1/2 a second. Mages dont need END/INT as much as people will tell you, Dex int end, for some reason in this game Dexterity causes you to hit the higher of your damage range more often.)

        I burned the bridge that I kept crossing back over to.
Said many of times that I quit just to find myself back again.
Played cat and mouse with a state of guilt for not being/contributing enough in group efforts, actually one of the biggest reasons I quit the many times I did. Just didn't feel like I was enough.

        Regardless of the guilt, I would eventually press on and continue my journey.
See, this game can indeed be a long journey for people who want to reach max level.
During your journey you are bound to meet people.
I've gotta say, I've met some really solid people in this game and it's actually crazy the times I caught myself feeling like it was the best time I've had in like forever.
Like I'm literally feeling this way even with all the bad that this game offers, it's wild.

       It was a high and low cycle with both the high points and low points to a pretty extreme degree.
The lowest point in the game for me is when I got stuck and there was nothing I could do to change the situation. I then had to lean on someone who has spent a lot of real money or an absurd amount of time to farm in game money to then buy the real money progress that someone else bought. OR I myself have to spend real money or resort to insane ways to make in game money work to then buy the real money progress. Pretty obvious, It's blatantly pay to win. 

       You think of pay to win, you think of investment, you think of investment, you think of game life. When you think of an MMO's game life.. I don't want to think about it..

 Back to the upside! The high points!!! The good good that I couldn't seem to get enough of!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
       
        I can easily say that my highest point while playing this game was when I got to experience my journey and grow/develop with others.
        This game can be socially and guild oriented, and honestly it hits good with this one.
Due to the length of the journey and how much there is to do to get to max level, there is a longevity in it and a bond can form with people therein. It can really add to the immersion as well, did for me anyway.

       [Keep in mind that the content is nothing spectacular and in modern day would probably fall beneath standard.] 
But a lot of the elements that create the experience of going through the content is STRONG.

The way I was seeing it, that some people were seeing it, it was great, but in truth. It wasn't hindsight. 

I won't even.

All I will say is there is-
 What could be. 
 And what is.

Pretty straightforward yes?

        The only thing that causing me to come back was myself, my longing for the high points.
Focusing on what could be, rather than what is.
So this time rather than just uninstalling like i always do, I deleted my character, my progress, and in game account purchased features.

Can always just make a new character?

I deleted my account, and negatively invested in sabotage enough to lose all hope for what could be in this game that IS NOT and WILL NEVER BE what could be.

I am literally at nothing. Should be good now right?





God forbid you grow attached to someone along your journey...

God forbid you do it...

Trust me... Shit hurts.

It's like cutting off connection to a world to someone that matters to you.

Someone that made you feel significant. 


It's hard to feel at one with nothing, when you felt like you had it all...


X is dead fam.

A finales de la d√©cada del 2000 Outspark public√≥ Fiesta Online, un MMORPG para todos los p√∫blicos desarrolado por Ons On Software y comprado por Gamingo en 2011.

Su estilo cartoon y su simpleza mec√°nica hace evidente su p√∫blico target, busca abarcar al p√∫blico casual y de menor edad, y en su momento lo logr√≥ a medias; no obstante a d√≠a de hoy es imposible recomendarlo a causa de sus pr√°ctias nocivas de monetizaci√≥n.

Todo aquello que puede ser monetizado, est√° monetizado. Pod√©s pagar por vida m√°xima, da√±o base, da√±o cr√≠tico, armadura, probabilidades de drops, experiencia, regeneraci√≥n inmediata de vida e incluso reducci√≥n de cooldowns.

En el fondo es un MMO bastante gen√©rico, pero cuanto menos noto cierto grado de m√©rito en lo esencial, v√©ase la exploraci√≥n, el grindeo y el combate desde la √≥ptica de un MMORPG casual; y hasta donde s√© en su momento cont√≥ con un equipo de moderadores y desarrolladores muy carism√°tico y activo. Se nota que ac√° hubo muchas horas de diversi√≥n y risas, es evidente que su nula base de jugadores activos actual est√° ac√° por mera nostalgia y temor a despegarse de unos recuerdos nost√°lgicos, pero a d√≠a de hoy jugar Fiesta Online requiere de gastos constantes y demasiado caros para contenido que hace 15 a√±os quiz√° hubieran sido relativamente aceptables.

En su momento tuvo su auge aunque siempre conservado en un nicho muy espec√≠fico, pero a d√≠a de hoy apenas cuenta con jugadores activos y los 6 (o 7, 8 aproximadamente) servidores con los que contaba fueron mezclados en tan solo 4, de los cuales un total de 4 cuentan con una poblaci√≥n en ""very low"".

It was a wild ride, starting in 2008 as a complete noob and ending somewhere around 2014 as a legend of Apoline (at least I thought I was lol) Some friends turned into enemies and some enemies turned into friends. But in the end we all had fun, most of my old friends like to joke and say it was the worst game they ever played but they know deep down they miss it and they miss all the good times we had playing. I know I do. Sometimes I wish I could just log in and talk to all my old pals like we all never stopped playing. But we all moved on to bigger and better things. I may never download and play this game ever again, I sold my old account long ago and I don't even think it exists anymore. If It does, I hope it lives till the end of this game and whoever owns it now I hope you are having fun!

As always comments are turned off to prevent trolls.
And this review will be updated if they make updates or as i play.

Let start off with startup:
1: they make you make an account with them (instead of just linking steam)
2: the start up settings mess up your PC. then you have to go and correct after getting in game.
(which in turn glitch's out steam)
Now moving along:
Gamingo has always made horrible games. just look at trove. 
Sad to say its a fact they are horrible game makers/ game runners.

 you can't  zoom in to see the characters face untill in game
( which mean extra steps to get the look you want).
2: the ui is so small i can't even read or see the icons correctly. so forget about playing it at all.
3. they have no controller support( hello 2021 called did you not get their notice of vr control, game pad control, XBOX control, PlayStation controls, windows controllers, touch screen, and mouse and keyboard. are all controller types used in PC Games.) you can't even properly program one.

this game crashed multiple times.
it looked interesting but the fact it took over an hour to even get it to work, combined with extra small ui
and no  game pad controller support ( btw this game was released for pc when game-pads were a  big thing)

This was my first MMO; it has a place in my heart. It has never been updated in any meaningful way. They changed the looks of a few starting level enemies, but they now stand out in comparison to the rest of this very outdated game.

To all of the comments saying the music is amazing: I disagree. 
Songs are generic and heavily recycled for zones. You will hear the same four songs mixed from level 20 to level 70. The same one song will loop continuously in most zones. Few tracks are actually tailored to the zones they represent.

This is a very bare bones game in that sense that it is a decent introduction to MMOs as a genre. Basic classes. You'll get the idea.

It doesn't have an auction house. The market is run by individual pop-up shops, making entering certain cities lag because of the sheer amount of vendors there. It also makes following the economy difficult.; good luck pricing your items.

It is ugly. Since the game launched around 2005, there has been little to no update for anything. You can jump, but only as an animation? The environment doesn't visually match where you can and can not go; many strange invisible walls for smaller environment items like trees and buildings.

There is an INEXPLICABLE amount of typos. The translation reads poorly. Random emotes are peppered into NPC text for no reason at all like:
""not be tolerated. :-P""
The player character and NPCs also have some oddly rude or bogus dialogue, which is bland to start, but if you care to read them...

PvP is pay-to-win and closed. High level PvE also becomes P2W.

The most sensitive aggro you will likely experience. You will consistently pull something through walls without realizing it. Mobs don't care about environment, btw. They will walk through terrain to reach you.

It's bad game.

Let me start by saying that yes, this game is P2W, but it can still be fun if you just ignore that aspect of it. You can progress without it, it just may take a bit more time. But this is an older game so it's pretty much built around the big grind. It's a lot easier to get through the lower level zones and stretch your gear up to around lv115 then it use to be 10 years ago. Unless you fell like power leveling, but then you'd be missing a big chunk big content as a new player. 

Note: DO NOT PAY REAL MONEY FOR SERVICES ADVERTISED IN CHAT! There are still gold scammers in this game although not as many as there once were and they WILL pray upon new players.

Fiesta hasn't aged too badly as I feared it would, I have seen worse. The cuteness aspect of the game also still holds true. The armor looks better then the cash shop cosmetics (yes they are P2W as well), but that's my personal taste speaking. Lots of the lower level dungeons you can actually solo with a decent set of 'green' armor and pots. 
You can get to level 60 in less then a day. 
I recommend joining an academy in early levels, it's good gold for newbies. 
This is not an action combat game, it is tab-targeting. 

Now the unfavorable (aka inconveniences).......

The grind for leveling at higher levels is still a pain. That's expected though. 
There is still no world wide market, have to go from shop to shop looking for what you need, but at least there is no tax sink to worry about. 
You may have a hard time finding parties at a lower level. I find it stupid that some OP players tend to charge in game money for helping you complete a task as a new player (anyone under lv100.) Not to say that there aren't people that won't help, but just be aware.

but this game is a shell of its former self ever since Gamigo got their hands on it, its been in basically in stagnation 
you had a game where the GMs would be one almost everyday talking with people and hosting events 
players on hundreds and thousands of players playing everyone having fun with an mmo that you could run on the old hp computer and most of the time not have a problem. People just haven fun and the GMs also haven fun.

now due to stagnation the once great player base is gone, the old gms are gone ( atleast to my knowledge), events barely happen .

it pains me to give it a negative review for a game that brought me so much joy in the past but i cant ignore the problems and just say yeah play it i recommend it.

Feista wasnt a bad game in the past but with the lack of real updates , barely any new content, increased P2W stuff, and overall a decrease in the major playerbase as msot people who play are either old heads (like myself) or somepeople who jsut desided to try the game

You will be required to put in more work than if you were to play Black Desert Online to succeed in Fiesta Online from scratch without help/veteran players assisting you. The only reason this game isn't dead is because of end-game players with a decade of play time who have spent too much money to ever quit the game so they continue to play.

The mechanics for each class are unbalanced and animations for every class are scuffed. Most low end content is dead outside of specific ""Dungeons"" which are called Kingdom Quests in this game. All instances require you to pay if you want someone to assist you that isn't your friend, which costs a fortune for new players.

Prices for item shop stuff is extremely expensive, they added a token system which allows you to buy the item shop currency with in-game currency, but it's extremely inflated in pricing so you get screwed no matter which method you choose to get item shop currency.

The community only has two faces, either really chill people who are usually really odd/socially awkward or extremely egotistical psychopathic losers that use their disability checks to fund their characters while they catfish as multiple separate personalities on each character then quit and make a new persona when people expose them for something perverted or they just become too hated and need to make a new personality.

Gamigo staff team are neurotic, there are multiple instances where the Game Masters on Discord will ban you for anything possible, they are extremely sensitive and unwilling to handle community outbursts like proper adults which results in a huge quantity of players constantly being permanently banned from the Discord. [u]As for in-game, you don't have to ever worry about being banned or jailed in-game since they NEVER MODERATE THE CLIENT EVER.[/u] People will world chat, map chat, and whisper you every profanity and derogative slur in the book and even if you report it, they will never ban the person. All things that result in permanent bans on other games without warnings, don't worry about that on Fiesta since nothing will get you banned.

Even returning to this game, I find myself addicted to it again. 
No, it's not beautiful, like Perfect World. No, it's not story dynamic like WoW. And no, it's not perfect, but it has that simplicity. I don't want a complicated MMO were I have to micro-manage so many skills and quest and such. I just want to grind, level up, participate with the community, and have fun.
If you want to partake in PvP features, it's a pay-to-win game. PvE features are easily free. I suggest purchasing the permanent items, such as the iron box for extra storage and such. It's worth the money. 
These days, Fiesta is a much faster game. I remember spending YEARS just getting to level 60, only for the community to die. 
Recently, I read that the community is at least rich again in one sever, and I've been addicted all over again. lol
TL;DR:  It's a good starter game for anyone new to MMOs. Expect crashes here and there. GMs also seem to be active again!

However, this is for the Steam version of the official servers.

The graphical style and gameplay are both quite dated, but not so dated as to significantly drive away most players. It has a cute aesthetic, some rather unique mounts, and opportunities for a variety of play styles. The game is very grindy though, especially for free-to-play players, and it will take you A LONG TIME to get to level cap. Most of the quests and other content on that road to level cap are kill and fetch quests, where creatures just slightly above your level will wreck you unless you are very familiar with the game mechanics and well-geared. It does provide a degree of challenge, but when one wants to progress to the end game content -- it ends up being more of a hindrance to enjoying the game than a fun challenge.

If you truly want to be competitive in end game PvP, you can just utilize the cash shop. Definitely not something I like seeing in a competitive MMORPG, but if this is something that doesn't bother you -- then the option is available here.

The Steam version also seems to be quite buggy, with many quests -- including starter area content -- not loading properly and making it impossible for me to progress until I finally uninstalled and downloaded Fiesta Online from elsewhere. Not sure if I'm alone with that issue, though.

Overall, there's a core game here that's not too bad and could be quite enjoyable for the target audience. With it's pay-to-win cash shop and overly grindy and repetitive PvE content, I can't really recommend it in general. I typically don't recommend private servers for live games, but in the case where the only available option is being operated in a greedy and in such a way as to be detrimental to promoting a fair playing field, I really don't feel all that bad about informing others about their options. Many private servers for Fiesta are out there that offer an experience that doesn't require opening up your wallet just to have a fair playing field.

Not a title that I can recommend on this platform.",1598173477,1598173477,False,3,0,0.540407180786132813,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you have never played the (Outspark) version of Fiesta, then you are not going to know what most of these angry people writing angry reviews are going on about. The game is as it always was, nothing has changed. So veterans returning after a long, long break won't really miss much.

Now if you are a new player to Fiesta, then you have to ask yourself two questions before you make your first character.
1. Am I willing to play a game that have very few optimization options when it comes to character look, and game visuals, because there is limited to none.
2. Do I have deep pockets, and can I afford to throw real money at this game so it don't take me 3-5 years to cap out a toon.

This game always has been, and always will be P2W. Don't let people fool you into thinking it is only a recent thing. It's been P2W since the beginning. The visuals are not bad in this game but options to tweak the actual look of the game are pretty much null. 

Now if you are ok with one, or both of these things, then Fiesta can STILL be fun, there is a lot to do, with many different zones and dungeons to keep you occupied for a long time. The game still looks great even if you can't raise or lower graphics settings. Also the community population is steadily growing as, people are more use to P2W aspects in a game these days because 90% of todays MMOs are just that.

FYI avoid PVP because that is where most of the P2W cash shop stuff is used. I mean who wants to fight a guy running around with buffs and a 200% damage boost. Not me.

One last thing. You can actually get freaking married in the game. They have a whole ring exchange thing that you can invite your friends to, that takes place in a zone just for weddings!!

that being said, starting this game it seems to have promise although very dated graphics (which still doesn't run smoothly).
problems are- 
there's only one populated server.

people don't like to help in open world chat and even the two guilds I've been in while the game leaves many things vague until you eventually open a quest that explains things one at a time. (took a while to figure out how to even sell something)

you can only craft healing and buff items (no gear whatsoever)

the world is surprisingly small compared to how they make it look

nobody runs dungeons or raids even if you try to rally them (good luck getting any gear drops, you basically just use what you can buy at vendor for your lvl most of the time)

quest system... you can open it up and take almost all open quests on (and turn them in) wherever you are, losing the open world feel

you get two small bags for both personal Inv and Vault storage causing storage issues well before lvl 10 (have to pay to expand it)

This all culminates to a extremely linear, narrow grind with very little by way of options.
you simply play, follow directions, get to top lvl (one A-B option on last promotion)...

If you've ever played a good MMO-RPG you'll want to pass on this one (it may have been around for a long time but it's a cheap knock-off).",1586298569,1586299301,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,False,True,False,False,,,

all the quests are the same, essentially. the story is kinda neat, I think. I haven't really looked at it much, I'm too ADHD for that. least you can spam click through it though!

it's...kinda active? it's got a playerbase. a lot of it is just whales now though. and yes, the game is p2w, undeniably. cosmetics have stat bonuses attached to them, and while I haven't reached that level of content, nor will I probably ever as I only play this in passing now, I doubt any end-game content is soloable without paying through the nose. honestly though the kingdom quest system works well around that, considering it's literally just public raids at set times.

healers can, albeit slowly, level up reasonably well solo. if you die in solo pve as a cleric you're doing something very wrong, considering how many heals you get. I picked cleric, again for nostalgia, and have been enjoying it so far. real simple, not much thinking, and in raids, everyone always wants you in their party. you will literally get instantly invited for every kingdom quest party. makes  things real simple. just keep people alive is all. don't even attack beyond what you have to.

I've played this game for 10~11 years, and hardly anything has changed. Fiesta online was actually released on 2006, not 2008 as steam implies. During my time playing this game, I realized how lazy the developers actually are. You hear the same Soundtracks over again, face the same enemies (even with slightly different designs), and the game even has most of the same artwork since day one. You'd think that a game, that is 12 years old now, would have some extreme changes, but no, the way you see the game, IF you were to play it, is pretty much the same as if you played the beta. As for the gameplay, the game seems easy at say from Levels 1~89, but above those levels (Level 90~135), playing the game is Physically IMPOSSIBLE, especially if you have no friends, or are not in a guild, you can't solo at all like in any other RPGs. Reaching Level 100, you are literally forced to + up all of your armor sets (Which are 5 levels apart) if you want to actually progress and take hits, and enemies do a SHIT TON of damage, and are faster than you, so you can't really outrun them, so your fate is sealed pretty much. Also, if you die, you lose EXP (1%), and the only way to get it back is to continuously do Shitty Repeat Quests that barely give you EXP at all. Speaking of Quests, your required, accordning to  other players, to SAVE quests because some levels (Say Level 124) DO NOT give you any quests! The only reason why this game is still alive at all is because of nostalgia, and suckers like those will be willing to pay up cash to play the game. Oh yeah, speaking of ""Paying up,"" this game has no Permanant Costumes for your character, that you would simply buy in any other game. Costumes, accessories, and pets only lasts 1 month. All in all, Fiesta is just nostalgia, that's it. It's not a good game, it's not fair, it's crazy expensive, and it's the same as it always has been. The game is literally hanging by a thread since you cannot as simply as go on to the website and download the game, OR click the shortcut to open it up, it'll just prevent you from getting online.

Put 6 years of my life into this game, was a bug tester for it for a while, and can tell you first hand that it's really bad. There are trillions of bugs in this game that cannot be fixed. The Support won't help you with any issues you might have the vast majority of the time. Some players get away with cheating, while everyone else gets banned without ever knowing why. The game is purely pay to win, you cannot do anything without purchasing their in game currency as all of the monsters in the later dungeons are balanced around having the cash shop items.

If none of these things scare you, go ahead and try it out.. The abilities for most of the classes are fairly fun to use and the animations are pretty decent, so the game isn't terribly boring. The beginning levels are really easy and can be played without purchasing anything. The game is fairly dead however, but there are still some players left.

PUNTOS A FAVOR:

+ Altamente sociable, de hecho necesitar√°s serlo si quieres crecer en este juego.

+ Sus clases son muy divertidas y es muy satisfactorio usar cada una de las habilidades de las distintas clases, sobretodo las de nivel 100+.

+ La tem√°tica de la cual se jacta de ser un  MMORPG con estilo de anime est√° bien implementada y los personajes son agradables a la vista.

+ Aunque su exploraci√≥n no es muy amplia es bastante entretenida.

PUNTOS NEGATIVOS:

- Sistema de subida de niveles altamente repetitivo y tedioso a partir de nivel 60.

- Mala optimizaci√≥n, por lo que en las ciudades principales aunque tengas un buen pc vas a sufrir bajones de FPS.

- Alto Pay2Win (En mi experiencia podr√≠a decir que es m√°s un Pay2Fast debido a que jugando puedes conseguir mucho dinero y conseguir estas mismas cosas Pay2Win, aunque pues el tiempo que tienes que dedicarle para conseguir esto es considerable).

- El primer punto a favor de sociabilidad queda un poco disminuido cuando en un mismo Server convergen muchas personas que hablan diversos idiomas, principalmente he encontrado el Ingl√©s y Espa√±ol, aunque he llegado a ver gente que habla incluso √°rabe, si este no es un problema para ti pues que mejor.

- Otro punto en contra de la sociabilidad es que en muchas ocasiones vas a encontrar tus zonas para hacer tus misiones de nivel 100+ saturadas, por lo que te sentir√°s un poco excluido y si ese no es el caso a√∫n as√≠ ser√° un impedimento para subir r√°pido, por lo que puede ser un punto negativo igualmente.

- Si te animas a descargarlo prep√°rate para una larga espera debido a que no han actualizado el parche que descargas desde no s√© hace cu√°nto tiempo, entonces te va a descargar cada uno de los parches desde ese momento hasta el d√≠a de hoy.

En general, es uno de mis juegos favoritos pese a todas sus carencias, no podr√≠a ser m√°s objetivo por que amo a este juego con todo mi coraz√≥n, sin duda alguna vale la pena darle una oportunidad.",1517255100,1588167889,True,6,0,0.614035129547119141,0,False,False,False,False,,,

That's the only thing I'd like to see get fixed other than that I'm fine with the cash shop coming from FlyFF and Allods Online this cash shop isn't as bad.

I had played Fiesta from its closed beta testing days and till the cap was 79. The game feels very simple from its anime natured gameplay. I had come back to the game when Outspark (Onsonsoft licensed Outspark to run Fiesta NA servers back then) had raised the cap to 89. My sweet and faint memories of Fiesta's earliest days include guildwars between BR and GoR, pwning noobs in 10-36 Abyss and KKP with guildies.

 Oh, I remember how quick people enlisted in KQs. They were gone in a flash. Needless to say, I did spend my money on achieving the elite status. I had depended on Store to make me rich. Oh boy, It was the best feeling in the world, to pwn nubs and stroll with guildies. <Q.Q> I remember Outspark spawning Helga in Eldy and halls near it. I remember Loveless's first raid on Helga. It was just PRIDE and nothing else to actually raid helga, not weps or any other drops. The card system was basically extinct.

FIESTA BACKSTORY:

It all pretty much started with gamigo taking over, that a lot of players quit. Most of my then guildies went to Rohan online and some had shifted to Mabinogi! A couple of patches and cap raises later, mages became OP and the economy of the servers went ape-crazy. 

And yes, mainly ""GAMIGO QUIT ADVERTISING FIESTA"". All games need advertising to keep the game active. Server population was tremendous falling and gamigo had no actual recovery steps. Just when gifter rates went sky high, a couple of high levelers quit. That's when ""FIESTA BECAME A PAY2WIN GAME"". 
Fiesta's character power distribution was broken. Warlocks and Gladiators dominated PvP. Oh yeah, did I mention it's godforsaken enhancement system? Bundles of t5 are holysmoking expensive and nope that wasn't enough yet, Karen weps went for over 700 USD and were OP for PvP. 

FIESTA WASN'T DEAD YET, IT WAS BURIED IN A COFFIN ALIVE!



FIESTA CURRENT SITUATION:


TEVA AND OTHER SERVERS DIED.
Like every other fiestaholic player in my guild, I quit teva and came to Bijou. Needless to say I was still active in Teva <only at raids and PvP> Buuuuut boy, Bijou was a recovery. Although it had a broken economy, it was atleast fun to level with noobs and do low level KQ. It had about 20% population of the late Outspark Fiesta~                        T_T

Almost 95% players still play Fiesta for the relic of the game it was a couple of years back. Sure gamigo took nasty steps like banning couple of elites from forums and a few from the game <myself included> for criticizing gamigo and promoting Private Servers <NO IT WASN'T RACIAL COMMENTS, gamigo crooks really do give false statements>

Then it happened-gamigo started listening to the veterans-SERVERS MERGED.
Server merge brought back many maaannnnyyy players back, but not for long. Pagel was meant to be for mains and Isya for perms. H&G, Loveless, MK, OWA and many other top guilds turned to Pagel. Few others turned to Isya, and that was when FIESTA STARTED DYING AGAIN. MK and OWA dominated raids and shared no drops, others who wanted to be part of raiding system couldn't help but turn to Isya, so they wanted an out. <ISYA HAD THE RAIDING SYSTEM OF A 4-YEAR OLD> Gifters left and again Pagel became Teva. 

The game is still fun, you can get to 70 in a week. Server economy is decent and needless to say FIESTA IS STILL A PAY2WIN. Buuttt, heey it's atleast FUN. 
Fiesta just isn't that game where you can sell your +ed weps gears and buy higher lvl +ed weps gears again with the same money and effort. FIESTA IS A TIME SINK FOR VETERAN PLAYERS and yes mostly FIESTA WILL DRAIN YOUR WALLET DRY.

I do recommend fiesta to players because It is still FUN albeit demanding. I do know Fiesta is dying but it still is amazing all the while. On the flip side, it has survived a lot more compared to Rohan, Mabinogi and other MMORPGs. -_-

If you're that player who cares about every cent you've earned, forget you read this and search for another F2P game out there xD

To begin there are 4 servers that you can play on, only 1 is ""active"" so you really only have option to play one server.

the main towns arent nearly as packed as they used to be but they not nearly as dead as everyone makes it out to be.

THIS IS A P2W kind of game, as in to make your weps stronger you need bundles to decrease the chance to break and such (really needed over +3 upgrade) some items are pure cosmetic but there are way more that give defense,attack and evasion,ect boosts aswell as hp extenders and damage boosts so take that as you will. You dont need to put money to enjoy the game but it does make it easier/ more fun.

everyone in the game is pretty friendly but there are still alot of ""vets"" who are cringy as fk so take that as you will

So overall it is pretty fun still with or without money and alot to do with or without people.",1513006574,1513006574,True,2,2,0.530270755290985107,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's your standard, run-of-the-mill K-MMORPG.  If you're filthy weeaboo trash like me and enjoy emptying your wallet's green load all over anime waifus, you'll probably love this game.  

This game has been, and continues to be, one of the biggest money traps of a game I've ever experienced.  Even more so, now that the community has more or less died (only remaining players are people like me - sad people who have spent too much time to let go and keep playing for nostalgia).  So if you want to solo in the high levels, enjoy spending exorbitant amounts of money on charms and EXP boosts - that way you can spend TWELVE hours running in circles kiting giant snakes for 1/800th of a % of a level, instead of spending SIXTEEN hours. Profit!

Community is virtually dead and 95% of current players seem to be perpetually stuck in 2006.  Most unironically overuse phrases and symbols like:

1) XD
2) &&
3) :3 
4) Replacing ""the"" with ""teh"" because it's kawaii~desu
5) Rawr XD

Not to mention, the entire game often comes off as an enormous harem.  People in game take their virtual marriages VERY seriously and spend REAL MONEY to make sure everyone knows how madly in ""luff"" they are with their spouses every 10-15 minutes in global chat.  Who said romance is dead?

Game is extremely buggy and crashes constantly if you do literally anything at all, including important tasks like opening the map! (I  guess it's a good thing only vets play! At least they know where everything is.  Probably better than they know the inside of their own homes, exceptions being maybe the basement.)

For the past 11 years i've played games similar to fiesta such as Flyff, Cloud nine, the guild wars series in a way, and World of warcraft, It's a shame they all have something in common in the end now.

MMorpgs and roleplaying online games are dying out now because they are not unique like they used to be anymore. Specific skills, armors, traits, weapons, classes used to set all these games on a different path from one another.We used to have storylines or gameplay that made sence not some stupid quick made up world that made it easy for everyone to play a game or have some infinite way to beat everyone all the time by paying money out of pocket.

This game used to be good ""Used to be"" due to the team of Developers that actually cared to correct mistakes made by code or glitches made due to patches. It ""used to have"" a team of devs that gave two blown transmissons about the community and cared what atleast some players said.People are begging for a server transfer because when gamigo bought it out they messed up the merge and didnt just hand out free transfers to give all our mains a chance to transfer to the ""Real active server"" regardless of the tool being released twice and then shot down.

The veterans who missed out on their email warnings with a 2 week warning to choose what server to transfer got shafted if they joined too late, and wanted to come back for old times.

Games developers today care about nothing but money.I used to play games in a time where gameplay made us all curious, it used to make us dream about what we could become in game and seeing those become what you wanted and see better places we could have gone no one else had, items that set us apart from everyone else, not made it an equal playing field for everyone and a simple mindless skill clicking quest repeating cookie cutter game.

People used to help each other out not care about being better.

The games are dying because nothing today sets them aside like what Guild Wars, or Flyff used to, They all had their niche no other company could touch in gameplay and ending up going down the same road, it makes me wonder what really happend to our community over all.

I wish some day someone would stand up against all the boring expected gameplay and rushed game creation we have today that appeals to the masses and focus on telling them we need something unique that can be carried another 10 or 20 years like world of warcraft was, or like ""Fiesta"" ""Was"" or what flyff was in it's prime.

This game is ""What is left"" and now thats all it will ever be. and to be the best here now, you have to pay out of pocket and can't even set up a sale store without random disconnections, or run through a town/portal without runtimes. Even with it's multiple login attempts, and different feel to it overall that sets it aside from every other game i've played and is now shut down, this is going down that same road again like the rest. 

But is it worth returning regardless of having nothing left, That is up to you to decide, but I can't return anymore to a community that is begging for help from the developers that recline, step back, and keep waiting for it to end up like the rest.

I enjoyed this game from 2009 to late 2012, and I actually can't wait to see it shutdown, something I hate to say but feel is right in the current state it is in, or some major, major implimentations need to be made to fix common bugs everyone has been asking to be fixed for years now to bring back  some of whats left of the community.",1507903590,1507903590,False,1,0,0.482839196920394897,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I've known Fiesta Online since I was 12, and fwoooo has this game's development gone for a ride. Though I still play Fiesta from time to time, and even capped my character when it was 125, I cannot hit the yes on recommend because for new players... There's not much to see. Most of the player base are those of us who have been with the game for years and still love it despite the many flaws, but for new players Fiesta is nothing but a mess. The first 60 levels are far too frickin easy now, and entering the 60+ zone has a huge difficulty inbalance as that room of zombies will eat you up faster than Majin Buu if you don't have a proper team. But as said, this is only a problem for the newbies as old players already know what to expect from this crazy world, and likely have equipment and money around to support themselves. The biggest problem though lies in the fact that the devs... Just can't get everything done. We've had nice updates that made leveling faster and all, but I recently read a post saying they had no model artists on hand to fix an issue. Updates are constantly being announced and cancelled, or just forever delayed (that merge though). I could go on abot pay2win drama, but we've probably all already experienced free online games and know all about that s*bleep*tstorm. Oh yeah, and the community can be close and friendly, but also scary in that sense. If you mess with ANYBODY, you could end up on some player wanted lists and what not. Though personally I've never had issues with this as I'm a lovely perfect angel ^u^ (95% of the time), but I can see it driving some players away with headaches. Gameplay wise, be warned that Fiesta does not hold back with difficult bosses, at all. Though many dungeons became a lot easier with the lvl entry update, don't let the cute slimes and adorable hobo men of the early levels fool you. You'll get your squishy tush torn to shreds by the demons, beasts, and uhhh... bigger slimes of the high levels! And glitches, lots of them, fwoo! But that goes with the development issues. Overall, Fiesta is a game that still holds a place in my heart, and I'll still hop on from time to time when the devs give us those surprisingly decent updates (they exist whether the community admits it or not). But it pains me that I cannot recommend it to new players.

Fiesta Online was a bumpy road. Absolutely amazing gameplay that rivaled World of Warcraft: WotLK, and while the ""anime"" aspect can be annoying if you hate anime, you couldn't deny the community was close-knit and happy, as well as the moderators were fun and would take the time to get to know you one on one. That was when Outspark developed the game. Sales, events, and patches were frequent and the game was at the top MMOs list. Then, Outspark disappeared and ""Gamigo"" replaced it. Let me tell you now. GAMIGO IS THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER SEEN. They lost my account of $400+ purchased items during their transfer from Outspark to Gamigo servers, and their support was horrendous. Two weeks apart from each response and each was some broken english telling me to ""change your email"" or ""change your password"" or ""we will allow you to change your username this once"" to ""fix it"", when they never did. Still haven't recovered my account. While I soaked years into this game (At least 5600+ hours), now it's just dead, sad, full of people from other regions so nobody speaks English, and unfun. Not to mention all my accounts are gone and those months of grinding items and filling 5+ pages of my bank with rares and legendaries to give to new or learning players. I miss tutoring new people, giving out free stuff, chatting with mods in game, doing events with mods, and more. This game will always have a place in my heart. Rest in peace Fiesta Online.

EDIT: Contacted support and they finally gave me access back to my ""account"". I logged in to find that everything I had was missing from every single server. They carried over my ""account"", sure, but no characters, items, or my inventory. Nothing. Contacted them again and got this: 
""If you are currently missing characters, this is probably due to an issue that we currently have with the Migrator Script that is currently not working properly. 
Due to that, your characters have not been properly moved to the new servers of Fiesta Online NA. 
Our IT team is already working on a solution and once the latter has been applied, you should be able to connect on your characters again.
We kindly ask you to be bit more patient. ""
Okay, so, for 4 years now (Gamigo obtained the game in early 2013) the so-called Migrator script has not been working? It's 2017 and you still have accounts that aren't migrated. That's pretty sad, and it's not like I wasn't active before the changes, because you can tell when an account was last online (like most standard games these days).

I've been playing Fiesta Online since 2010, so this game gives me so much nostalgia that it's almost impossible to leave. Quitting cigarettes would be easier than leaving this bad Jackson.
But honestly ever since Gamigo took over it's been nearly impossible to do anything because a lot of players have left, the prices have risen, and absolutely nobody wants to help anybody anymore. There's a few tight-knit guilds left on the two servers that people actually play on, but it's still difficult since they're not always available to help you.
I guess what I'm trying to say here is that I would not reccomend this game for people who aren't willing to spend at least $20 monthly on it, because you're going to need it, and you'll probably spend more because it's honestly like cocaine.

I originally played this game when it first came out before it was ever on STEAM. I leveled a cleric up to level 90 over the course of off and on gameplay for about 2 years.

 IMHO, a terrible starting character experience. Having started an Archer, i had no money, no gear,  having no starter bow and no starter archer skills. Skills cost copper money.  Found a several quests to attack i guess begginning critters using hand attacks. 2 had rewards for hat and boots.  Looking in the steam forum and negative review saying this game is highly Pay to win.   

I didn't like this game, try it if you want to pay real money to win.

me and everyone else who ordered the items are still waiting its 5-6 months overdue. 
Some more points about the game bellow, but i recommend you don't try this game or quit if you still play things will only go down hill untill the servers close. 
- pay to win
- pvp is based on cash shop items ( the more you spend the higher your stats)
- pve is highly repititive ( almost no updates, new content comes every 1- 2 years)
- low player base 100-200 people on the main servers rest of the servers are really dead.
- need to pay money to be able to do raids/farm properly 
- bad graphics 
- no end game content  
- grind heavy 
- bad staff
- updates and deadlines constantly not kept 
- have to spend money each month to be able to play well 50$s+
- no value for money

I originally had it before it came out on Steam, and the only reason I got it through steam was because I stopped playing and uninstalled it at one point. It was originally owned by a company called Outspark, and it hasn't changed all that much since it switched over to Gamigo. Mostly skin changes for monsters and the starter town.. oh and maybe some NPCs. 

In terms of classes, it doesnt really matter what you pick since all the quests are the same. There is no story line whatsoever. There are seasonal events, and the premium item store holds some goodies if you are willing to spend real cash in order to get store currency. It has been said that FO has become a pay to win game, but as long as you're willing to put in the hours, it is possible to reach cap without premium items. I dont suggest battlefields, pvp dungeons or PVP kingdom quests without premium items... which I guess proves the pay to win section.

The enhancement system is also a lot harder if you dont use premium items, and even though enhancement offers some perks, and makes your gear prettier... it is still possible to play without, or you can always farm/sell for in game currency and hope to buy off another player. Players stores can be ridiculously priced though.. unfortunately people dont really offer an item for what it's really worth and tend to overprice useless gear. Be mindful of your class and stats before buying from other players, and really consider whether it is actually worth the price.

It has its pros and cons like any game, but if you're into things like this then by all means give it a go. It's not so bad, as long as you're willing to sink hours into it. (Though... if memory serves... since I havent started a new character in a very long time... you can get to level 30 within a couple hours)

Lo Malo:

Al encantar las armas/armaduras se pueden romper se necesita un item de pago!
Los mounts o monturas se compran con dinero real
Los sets costume se compran por 7 o 30dias con dinero real
Las Skins de armas tienen durabilidad y para repararlas necesitas comprar un item si no se rompe mas aparte las skins de da√±o se compran con dinero real

Para hacer raid o farmear necesitas tener tu traje encantado o comprar charm's (buff da√±o/def) de pago!

Leveling isnt as hard as it used to be, and quests feel rushed. It feels like rather than increasing the exp rate of the game, Gamigo decided to add more, seemingly meaningless quests which give ridiculous amounts of exp. You can accept and turn in quests without even being near the NPC you got it from. This does mean that the ""pay to level"" system of the older outspark game is gone, but it doesnt feel as satisfying to level (I hit level 60 in 3 days, whereas it used to be a huge achievement). The Trickster felt like Outsparks final attempt to reinvigorate the game before they turned it over to gamigo. And gamigo responded by adding the Crusader, a class which seems so rushed that it doesnt even exist below level 60, and it even has some skills copy pasted from other classes.
I can see that Gamigo are really trying to update and reinvent the game, with graphics updates, new quests, and a quicker leveling system, which allows you to get into the action faster. It even merged all the servers into a couple of servers to make the servers full of people again. As a result, this isnt the same game as it used to be, but its an evolving, fun game nonetheless.

Ultimately, this isnt the golden '105 cap' fiesta that I remember, but I'm not gonna say it isn't worth playing. While its not the game I poured endless hours of my childhood into, its still a good game. Fiesta used to be hailed as a ""pay to win"" game, but now more than ever I feel that this isnt true. You can do really well without paying a cent. Im going to miss the days of stacking, endless grinding and massive guild raids on Karen, but the game is still fun. If you're coming to revive an old interest, you may be better off on a private server.

Every server had lots of people and the economy was thriving!

Also, I played more than 27 hours. I found that steam makes this game crash so. I downloaded the client from the Gamigo website.

I heard about a server merge and figured I'd download it to check it out. They just merged the servers they had into 4 new servers; so, it's just like when I started there were 4 servers. When I left the game in 2009, they had 6 servers and I don't know if there were more added between 2009-2015. 

They would have to merge the 4 servers they have now into one to even get 1/2 of the number of people they had on just one server in 2009. 

Don't let the population reading confuse you. Two of the servers say medium population when they should say ""very low"" Don't get me started on the ghost towns that are the servers that say low...

I played up to lv 62 and I couldn't do any kingdom quests because no one else was playing them. This is one of the main reasons that I quit in 2009 because you need materials to craft and the best way to get them in through KQ's but if no one wants to play then the game really becomes a grind!. 

The only kingdom quest that was going was the level 105+ one and it was not even full. 

I saw some people desperately shouting for people to join the KKP level 70-79 KQ the one that I loved the most. These were some of the shouts.

Join KKP mats <3
Please Please Please join KKP
JOIN KKP FOR MATS WE DO HAVE A CLERIC!!!!

The people are not that bad they just seem to me to be trying too hard to hold on to this game when they know it's on its already dead. The people I met were mostly nice they helped me out more because they wanted to show off their cash shop godly powers than any other reason.

I was being run through this dungeon tower for Lvl 20+ toons by a Lvl 60. The whole time we when in there he was saying things like I can do 4000+ damage with these charms. (Charms are cash shop items that increase your damage for a set amount of time) He must have been wearing 60$ or more worth of cash shop items. I got the feeling that this guy had this toon set up to run people through this tower never letting the toon get past level 60. This is a common practice in all MMO's but, I just found it amazing that this person was still doing it on this game considering its population. I'm sure I was one of the only people he had helped in a long time.

Now on to the economy, to start, let's talk about guild academies! At least the two that I joined, were giving rewards of 1-10 gold per level. The academy that I mainly stayed in was ""Eradicate"" -- the one with the best rewards.

 I made 10g the last level ""60"" for a total of 2gems and 30 gold that's more than I ever had before. Guess what? I still could not afford anything for my toon the prices are insane now. I saw one good weapon priced at 7 Gems or 700 Gold. This was a level 70 weapon not even enhanced or anything. I started talking to the guy and asked if he would come down on the price he said one simple word ""NO"" 

The economy on this game now if based on everyone believing that everyone else has a secret level 100+ toon where the quests alone can make you a millionaire.

What really finally bashed the nailing into the coffin for me was today 10/9/15, I spent 20$ in the store on enhancement bundles this way my weapon would not break as I was leveling it up. 

I bought 3 of the T3 Bundles for 20$. I had already enhanced my ax to +4 the max limit before it will break if I try again without shop items. I used all 30 of the protection items and only got my ax to +10..... now remember it was already +4 when I started.... the max is +11 I spent 40g and 8 of those protection items just trying to get my ax from 10 to 11 the price is too high for me. A sub to World of Warcraft is 15$ a month and there are no paid in-game items except for looks on that game. 

I would have to spend 50, 60, maybe even 70$+ just to get my ax to +11 and armors to +10 anyone who says you can do it without ever enhancing your items has never played the game. Or, they played the game when there were 1000's of other people playing it and you could get a party if you sucked. I decided to let this game go and wish anyone who is addicted to it well. I hope you see what you are doing to yourself before you waste your life away like I did this past week.

I try to think of it this way

Say I keep on playing past level 62, The good thing is that it's possible to get to Lvl 70 just from quests. But then what,  Say I   spend the rest of the week getting to lv 70. Ok, I'm now level 70, so, I start getting to 80, and leveling starts to slow down as there are no kingdom quests. 

The quests offer 10-50% of the required XP per level. So, I grind for the next few months to get to 100+, then what? Now I'm a level 100+ toon and now what?? I can get all the money that I need by doing quests and play 1 kind of KQ. I can hang out with my ""Friends"" most of whom will be decked out in cash shop items. These people won't want me in their circle unless I spend money on the cash shop too... say I do spend money on the cash shop then what??? I'm now a level 100+ toon with godly stats that is accepted by his peers who spent 100's if not 1000's of $$$ and can do 1 kind of KQ if my ""friends"" feel like doing it too. I can go on raids if my ""friends"" feel like doing it too...

There is no future for me playing this game. However, if what I just summed up seems like your kinda fun, then download now and enjoy!!",1444404854,1595954900,False,61,9,0.786305487155914307,5,False,False,False,False,,,

This game has really good combat in my opinion because the skills and healing with sp/mana hp/sp pots and stones is really fun and different from most games of the genre. It has a really good core idea with lots of little funny and odd anime stories but i have more complaints then things I like.
       I said that I really like the combat which in a very grindy game is a must need. You dont have a million abilities but you have enough to keep you interested. I like that the balance is really good because there are a lot of buffs you can do to your character. You more often then not will have scrolls or potions on that increase your stats tiers 1-5 that can all be created through crafting and receiving from quests. The stat system is very normal and well made. The game has lots of different cool thins like your mini house. You reviece a mini house that over time restores your hp and sp over time from sitting in this mushroom that you can change the look of the higher levels you reach. Now on to the bad things.
       This game has a decent structure I think with a few personal things gamigo has come up with with cool buff systems and healing items to keep you in battle. But there are a few things that make this game absolutely atrocious at times. I am not sure what level it starts happening at (around level 50 I think) when you die you loose hard earned xp. Ok this seems ok sure you die and you loose like 5% of your base xp FINE. But this game was made so that when you level up you get a certain amount of quests for the next level and if you die to many times durring that level you are suck having to grind or do ""repeat quests"" which are quests that give next to no xp which are very grindy and take forever to do just so you can get the last 10% of your xp bar to level up and get a new set of quests to go grind more mobs. They try to cover up the flaw by giving you the ""repeat quests"". Another thing is the economy... THERE IS NO SUCH THING because the way you can sell items to other players is by setting up a mini house and selling your items in a stationary spot which means if you wanna sell things you have to be online. And instead of playing while your online which the makes should be emphasizing you sometimes just have to get on and go afk all day to make money.

Back to when I knew so little about MMORPGs and introduced me to a world of fantasy,adventure, long time friends....and sucking my wallet dry! 

Now this is a story all about how
this game will make your funds go down
the nostalgia is gone this game will set a flame
I'll tell you how why you shouldn't bother to get this game

Welcome to fiesta! Create your character! We have many options for you to try!
Oh what's that? There‚Äôs only three? We we have way more but you need to buy!
Its just a small fee, maybe 5 bucks or ten!
And then you'll never have to worry about it again... >.> (but if you change your mind you'll have to pay again)

Time to play the game and now you're in your first raid
Now look at all the the players that paid
They're stronger, better and can take a hit
Their costumes look awesome while you look like shit

Now now don't be sad and throw a fit
All you have to do is buy this kit
its full of great power ups and costumes galore
but because its bundled you'll have to pay a little more

There ya go, just look at you, hanging with the best
You rule this game now so stick out your chest!
But oh no.. what this? your shiny gear is gone?
Well you only got the small pack and it doesn't last long..

But now if you want the permanent kind
just pay a little more and just keep in mind
that permanent power ups are very rare
so buy them fast before they fade into thin air

Oh nice, lucky you, you found a great weapon
and you want to improve it for better protection
but if you want to make sure that it doesn't get destroyed
then pay a little more so you can fully enjoy...

Wait! What's wrong? Where are you going!?
I know it seems a lot that you are owing...
Fine! Forget you!  You can see my sin...
I got all your money and you can't even log in!

I remember loving this game and spending hours and hours online with a  community that was actually a joy to be apart of. One day, I just stopped playing Fiesta, and moved on with other games. 

When I saw that Fiesta had found its way to steam, I was surprised to see it was still alive. I'm not sure how its still around, considering how bland and repetitive it is. It's your typical Korean mmo grind fest with an uninspired tab targeting combat system and a pay 2 win cashshop.

I guess the only thing that would keep someone around would be the community. Its a shame there isn't one anymore. The game feels dead and empty.  At one point in time, areas that would be bustling with activity and parties  are now nothing more than barren maps with the occasional mob of enemies here or there. From what Ive seen, the towns are dead, say for the few newcomers who downloaded the game out of curiosity. I can only assume the sight of an empty starting town won't keep them playing for very long.

And pvp is no fun cause of what I am about to say in next paragraph

From 50% additional hp, 70% additional damage and armor, 20% more damage from weapon skins,  80% crit rates [crits are double damage], 50% additional item drop rates, Instant full hp, no cd potion, 100% xp rates. Everything is monetized, if there is an advantage you can get there is a thing to buy.

I played years  back, maybe 7 years ago, cash shop was mainly used as a consmetic items, maybe some had crit rates but were very minute, i remember a crit set [full cash shop items] having a whopping 3% crit, now its nothing to see people rolling with 80% crit rates.

The perm [never leveling] community is what made me wanna stick around, The farming of gears is actually a really fun aspect to me, it's all random statted and I am a collector at heart, i got near all max statted sets and the perm community on Epith never used cash shop, we were really all free to play outside of enhaching our sets. 

This is where I am now, it's a terrible community thats filled with people buying items for hundreds of dollars, through facebook groups. Pvp has turned into people obtaining the best items by paying real money for them, if you dont buy the items you spend cash shop points to obtain items so that you may gain gold faster, if you are true free to play you can not make the gold another thats spending hundreds selling his cash shop or just flat out buy items for real money, You will not outbid other pvpers for the best items cause some has spent thousands of dollars to obtain un heard amounts of in game money.

The drop rates are terrible, beyond bad, even with cash shop items that boosts rates its not fun at all, It wasnt always like this. The ratio of gears farmed to gears that people want is too low, the low drop rates has forced a sellers market that items are so rare that they can decide how much they want for it, where as if drop rates were increased and alot of that item was available it be buyers market where people undercut each other to sell theirs.

It is simple enough for ten-year-olds, but a few annoying bugs and a very grindy lategame may discourage you after many hours of play. It is free, and buying in-game items can help speed you along without breaking the game.

Positives:
1. Fiesta is simple as MMOs go: you don't so much *win* the game, but you gain levels by earning EXP from completing quests. Quests mostly require killing monsters, collecting drops from monsters, or gathering items in the wilderness. The quests and overarching storyline are text-based and perhaps tangential to the game itself; there is virtually no real ""roleplaying"" of your character. Don't let the anime feel fool you: you spend the bulk of your active gaming time looking for monster spawn points and exterminating them.

2. If dressing up your character in funny and cute cosmetic items is a draw for you, you will be pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of available costumes, hats, ears, pets, and mounts you can (rarely) earn or buy in the real-money store. Most cosmetics give a mild buff, such as increased critical hits or more EXP, and some can be earned by leveling, playing games of chance in the Lucky House, or completing timed rewards during in-game events.  You can run around in a t-shirt, butterfly wings and rainbow tube socks while fighting the bad guys, and still have all your gear equipped and active. Even a free-to-player can earn about 15 specific cosmetics by the time a character reaches level 66.

3. A handful of typical classes provides some variety, but you only acquire perhaps 10-20 skills unique to each class, so there isn't the deep customization you would find in action RPGs like Diablo or World of Warcraft. That said, you can spend skill points on your favorite skills to make them more powerful, cheaper to cast, or to refresh their cooldowns faster. You also get stat points to increase the raw abilities of your character also.

4. Fiesta boasts one one of the few truly female-friendly gaming communities. Also, the gender of your character can be chosen on creation regardless of class and without effect on your character's stats. Also, if you're a parent of a potential user, Fiesta has virtually no content that is inappropriate for preteens; only the chatter of the other players need be monitored. There is also no way in-game to purchase real-money content; the store is on a separate, secure website.

Negatives:
1. Fiesta needs to address a few bugs that cause the game to crash repeatedly, usually caused by switching areas or standing around in populated areas. This is causing the existing community to slowly leave, however the most popular server (Bijou as of this writing) still enjoys a large population. If you want to play alone or just with some close friends, you can choose one of the other servers and not be bothered much by chat spammers or other annoyances.

2. No Steam overlay for a Steam game.  No Steam Guard for a Steam game; it still utilizes a third-party anti-malware software (X-Trap). You can't use Steam Wallet Funds to buy Slime Coins, the currency used by the parent company, Gamigo (at least that I can find). Steam does little more than hold the shortcut for you, much like a non-Steam game you've added to your library. So what's the advantage of being a Steam game...?

3. Some of the crafting skills (i.e. making potions and scrolls) require you to spend hours of real time crafting many more items than you will ever need or sell. It's something you can have the game running in the background while you do other tasks, but it is kind of a pain.

4. On one hand, the game is growing: some low-level maps have had graphical updates, and the level cap has increased to 125 replete with new areas, quests, and items to find.  On the other hand, the North American servers are slowly depopulating, just because there are so many other games out there to play, and that the patches (and bugfixes!) of new content are coming too slowly. If you can find friendly players and join a Guild Academy, you are more likely to stick with playing longer. But playing solo is a real grind (even for me, and I'm used to grinding solo).

Free Advice:
1. You will level MUCH slower if you ignore the quests and just find a place to grind.  Until level 30 you can play as you wish, but in later levels, most of your EXP will come from completing repeated quests, not from defeating the monsters required by the quests.  That said, I hope you like grinding, because in the mid-game (say your level is in the 60s) a typical quest may require you to kill 40 of a monster for 4% of your required EXP to gain a level, and a repeatable quest will require 120 of a monster to earn 7% of the required EXP.

2. Save your skill points until you have played the character for a few hours and have become comfortable with your hot-keyed skills. You cannot unspend the skill points unless you spend real money to do so. Maxing out the power and maxing out reduced cooldown time of your main attack skills is common.

3. As far as your stat points, most players maximize their character's Strength in order to increase damage, unless you are a Wizard (max INT instead). Depending how you play your character, however, you may put a few points in SPR (to have some more SP and to crit more often), and perhaps a bunch in END (for extra health when you intend to get hit a lot).

4. You can earn a lot of random cosmetic items by participating in month-long Attendance Events. By logging on for one hour a day per character, that character can earn a reward of 1-3 cosmetic items per week, as well as another reward for earning attendance for at least 21 of the 28-day event. Stash these items, then use them when you're bored or when you plan to do a lot of leveling!",1419804345,1419806234,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I completely agree. Fiesta was one of the first mmorpgs I've ever played and somehow, I still love it (even with all the repetiveness and grinding). Why? The community is nice (which I find very assuring when you're just a starter, so this is the big concept I want to point out to beginners). People will always help you when you're least expecting it; whether it be a random buff from a cleric or people asking if you need help in your guild -you can always rely on the community. 
I might be naive saying this, but I've played other mmorpgs to some extent as well, and at some point they all have their repetiveness, so as far as the gameplay goes... what's so bad? The skills have increasing levels that you unlock as you level up, and skills that you eventually come to gain. You don't come equipped with all your skills and for me, I found that such an exciting experience when I first started playing. [If anyone else has played Vindictus then I would like to compare: you do get skills along the way, and can level them up to some degree, but unless you're not into the whole paladin/dark knight thing then there's no other skills] I always looked forward to getting new skills in Fiesta and still do (because I haven't reached the level cap yet since I've taken such a long time off this game, but I still come back to it).
Now if you don't like grinding or P2W then sorry; this is definitely NOT the game for you if you plan on playing it for a while. This is the reason I've taken long breaks and the only reason.

Overall, I definitely recommend this games to starters of the mmorpg worlds. 
Even so, I still recommend this game to experienced mmorpg players as well. This game goes back to the classics. Classes of Fighter, Mage, Cleric, and Archer can never let you down. To add, the developers have even added Trickster, and Crusader to those who want a little variety. note* Crusader becomes availible at level 60. I always seem to come back to this game even if it is repetitive because I miss it, and I think others who have reviewed have the same feelings. It's a relaxing game that has cute sprites and reliable gameplay. I think that's all from me ^^",1416693554,1416693554,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I played this game in it's first few years, 2007-2010, and it was great.. I made lots of online friends (many of which i still keep in touch and/or play other games with) and generally had a really good time. The game itself is a generic mmo with rather simple mechanics, it's essentially a beginner's MMO... but of course that's not what made Fiesta fun, what made it fun was the social aspect.. unless you make friends and join a guild you ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE FUN, this game isn't for ""lone wolfs"" that are just looking to play a game and level up because it gets extremely tedious.
I downloaded this game again after seeing it on Steam while mindlessly browsing in order to see how much it has changed and damn, has it changed. This game is now just a shadow of the shell of what it used to be..that's right, it's not even just a shell of it's former self, it's the shadow of it's shell... the reason being, there's very few people playing and even fewer new players getting into the game, it's currently Friday night and the server populations are all on Low.... It's mostly just populated by a handful of true newbies that in all likelyhood won't make it past level 50 and the rest are veteran gamers that have sunk way too much time and/or money to quit, which is made evident by the high number of not only high level characters but also mid to low level characters with +9 - +11 gear whom are most likely just alts belonging to veterans. I looked around the low level maps and saw only a few people doing quests, all of them by themselves of course.. Roumen to Uruga ( they're the maps for levels 1 to 60 ), checked all the maps in between and didn't see more than 10 people, none of them were in parties/groups.. just solo'ing. If you look at the screenshot of a group of players above, that's pretty all the people you'll see in Elderine which is the main vendor map...half of those people will most likely be AFK though, so you'll only see around 20 active players in that main city map.

So in short, don't bother playing this game.. I imagine it won't be around for another year or two.
*sigh* it really was nostalgic running through the maps though, almost brought a tear to my eye remembering all the good times I had with my old guildmates.. all the fun, drama, and plain old silliness.

This is going to be a fair review for a game that is quite old compared to the ""new-gen"" mmo's, comparing the good parts and the bad. 

Now the only reason I recommend this game is because I would recommend it to new players who are playing their first mmo, why you ask? Because this game is fairly good when one doesn't expect anything from a mmo, people that have played mmo's before are not going to like it only because they have played better. Fiesta isn't top notch and never will be but it's a good starting point for anyone who really wants to start getting into online gaming. Fiesta has a nice community, diverse classes (traditional mage/fighter/cleric/archer type of deal with a few different ones, crusader/trickster), and a huge PvE aspect from level 1-115 (Or whatever the cap is at now). When I say PvE I mean there's a lot of things to do, but there's a short list of what you SHOULD do to level and not just mess around. You can get pretty much anything without paying a penny but its extremely difficult, there's only 2 people that I know of that have never payed a penny and still were able to cap with high end gears. The guild/academy system is very useful as you can always find help provided that you joined popular guild or a guild with at least 5 people who still play. 

Now for the people that have played mmo's before, don't bother trying with this game. Compared to most mmo's this is pretty far down the list of ""good games."" It's pretty old and follows old mmo standard playstyles, it's very grindy and it's very P2W (pay to win) there's a large gap when you compare people who don't pay vs those who do. And it's not spend 10$ and you can get some good stuff like in other games, you nearly have to pay 40-50$ a month now to be properly ""geared"" with sc (slime cash/cashshop) items for the MONTH. 

Now the PvP is very tricky. I can say that it's bad and that it doesn't require any skill for a fighter/mage since they're the ""PvP classes"" of the game since they're easiest to spam skills with or that the cash shop really overly unbalances the PvP with the stat increases + some multipliers of skills = insta death but I have seen people fight really well using any other character that is supposively ""bad"" for PvP so it really does depend on skill in the end along with a little push of SC. ( the company has got to make money somehow right?)

In the end, recommended as someone's first mmo but not recommended for anyone who has played any mmo before.

1. The creators of the game are money hungry. It is extremely hard to ignore this when every person you see around has +9/+10 gear. (These are the best enhancements for gear, which can only be obtained with either buying things from the store to stop your gear from breaking and increasing success rate, or you can try with a 95% chance for your gear to break otherwise.

2. The community is basically dead. Most maps have only veterans or new players who have just started. Also, a lot of the community likes to scam you out of your money. You will come across the rare ""helpful player"" every so often though.

So, let me enlighten you on something that will make this worth your time, and will cost you less (Or no) money.
Private servers. Servers made by a community that cares about its players more than it's income, unlike Gamigo.

Unfortunately, I am unable to name any off the top of my head, but there is a site with a top 100 for them, look it up.

Now, these servers are more user friendly than the original server. Here is a list of things they do compared to the original.

- Most cash shop items (If not all) can be bought with in-game cash instead of your credit card. 
-Exp is multiplied (ALL servers have different rates!! ) to prevent you from ""Requiring"" an exp x2 card from the shop. 
-Drop rates are higher, but usually not to the point where you get a drop every kill.
-Money is easier to get, and items that are sold by other players are usually fairly priced, unless it is godike. (Max stats on it)
-Server maintenance is usually weekly for most servers, usually fixing bugs and adding in custom items, bosses, and more.
-Like I said above, custom content exists. Most servers will also accept user-made content, if that's your thing.
-Some servers run purely on donations, others DO have a cash shop, but they usually only contain non-gamebreaking items.
-Every server has a different feel and experience.
-Much more.

So really, the game is alright, but can be easily improved as shown by private servers.  If I were you, I'd skip the steam download and take the time to look one up, as It's well worth your time to try them out.

Good luck, and I hope you take my advice.",1403201217,1403201384,False,13,2,0.577620387077331543,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Granted...I had a blast pissing people off in full charms in PVP...but still. This game is a poor excuse for an MMO. It's a grindfest...and unfortunately every aspect of the game is set up so you can keep spending money. I played this game for 2 years and I must've spent about 100 bucks a month on charms/xp boosts/outfits/customizations/enchanting mats. It was pathetic. I could've paid for my car 2 times over with all the money I spent on making my character all 'elite'...and it didn't matter...if you're not willing to suck some guild masters dick...you're not gonna be able to raid or do anything remotely fun in the game. That's why 90 percent of the community sat around in town talking smack...and only the elite 10 percent of the active community were all in the same one guild and they'd farm the one raidable boss in the world...which isn't instanced so any other guild was shit outta luck.

My advice? Stay the fuck away from this game unless you have absolutely no goals for your life that take place outside of your house.

Fiesta is a Free to Play ""Anime"" MMORPG, Anime being a loose term for the style of art used and not the actual feel of the gameplay itself.

Graphics:  5/10

The Graphic team that put this together probably put alot of effort into it, but the cocders who turned it into a game probably stripped away alot of what they did to make room for other functions... They should have put alot more into the visualstyle instead of leaving things bare-bones pastels. Not bad, but definitely not good... evenf or a Free-to-Play game.

Audio:  3/10

Like most MMORPGs the audio ranges of the game almost feel like they are bringing back the old 8-bit music ranges. Constant loops and single grunt dubs are all you have to look forward to. This combined with some other lack luster features convinced me to do an uninstall after reacching level 7.

GamePlay: 1.5/10

Like most other MOORPGs out there the variety of quests are limited to:
1) Kill this for me
2) Get this for me
3) Do this for ""Yourself""
Nothing really new here, but they way that the quests were set up could have been more creative without hacing to add any new features. Grinding gets boring fast, and having to use the rest function (which heals you at an agonizingly slow rate) shows you that you either have to be as patient as a Saint, or be willing to forrk over some cash for a game that isn't going to be getting much better.


For the most part, this game was everything I hope to not find in an MMORPg of any caliber, but one thing that did please me was the ""Free Stat"" system which most RPG players are happy to see. The ability to choose where your stat point go into is always a nice thing :3

What can I say? I saw an ad, liked the colorful characters, and signed up. It's a fairly unimaginative game with very little free customization. I began playing back in 2008 and when I tried signing in a few months ago, my characters had been deleted, including all my mounts, custom character designs, and upgraded weapons (all of which cost money). I didn't try very hard to get the game back up and working after that.

But back in 2008, I invested a ton of time and a nice chunk of money in Fiesta Online. What eventually drove me away was the community and the grinding. If either could have been better, I might have stuck around but the carpal tunnel-like symptoms and the bickering were enough to make me quit.

I tried signing in again today, knowing full well it would mean starting over. I was curious. The same three hairstyles, three faces, and three hair colors are present. They updated the character creation screen but it fails to impress. They added a class, which I've only played for a brief period of time, but the mechanics of the game are still pretty much the same. The starting gear is the same cowgirl-esque stuff from 2008. They added a tutorial which I find frustrating to get through but maybe that's because I've done this all before. I think it could have been a bit more streamlined than it presently is. It was really boring standing in place as I swing the same mallet from 2008 at the same Honeying for several minutes before it dies.

As a Cleric, I still don't get any offensive abilites until a handful of levels in. The graphics are the same. Roumen appears to be the same. The controls are still clunky and because I've experienced other games since Fiesta, it was enough to make me lose interest. When I closed the game down, the same ""Fiesta.bin has stopped working"" error came up. Ah, nostalgia.

It's a very grind-heavy game in which dying means redoing HOURS of repetitive monster killing. Some levels give you a small handful of quests, others give you none meaning you have to space your quest turn-ins out so you don't go crazy.

All in all, the game does not appear to be any better than it was 6 years ago but I can't say I was expecting it to be.

I will, however, say that I rather liked the Kingdom Quests and still think they're a neat idea. You sign up for a KQ and go into an instanced zone with a number of other players and defeat the end boss. I would say the KQs are probably the more creative aspect of Fiesta Online. They're timed and utilize different mechanics to make them interesting. They tend to require a decent amount of teammwork which can be both good and bad. I also like that, even though I'm currently back on foot and moving slowly, I can press a button to lead me to my objective and basically AFK until I get there.",1401060390,1402664058,False,21,1,0.598163187503814697,3,False,False,False,False,,,

In a world where you can't even change your graphics quality, players assume the role of a fantasy hero and play out their life long dreams of being anime characters; desu-desu. Regular bug fixes, rehashed events, and more than 115 levels of doing the same thing over and over again with hundreds of hours of gameplay (thousands if you don't buy $500 worth of microtransactions) await you!

Having a hard time hitting that next level? Well don't worry we got 150% EXP Boosters there for you. This allows you to level up twice as fast! Now it'll only take 15 gameplay hours to go from 80-81!

Drop rate boosts are also available so you don't have to spend 10 hours killing the same Great Goblin King over and over for a chance at that rare item!

Lets not forget mounts! Even you can run around at the speed of sound with these guys! (Food for the mounts must be bought separately from the cash shop)

Who wants charms? These charms let you wreck any other player or monster in this game easily. Build a full physical damage Mage and still kill kiddies with your 200% boosted stats.

Can't enchant your item because there's a 90% chance of it breaking and going away forever? Buy some ENCHANT BREAKING PROTECTION. Want to upgrade the chance of the item actually upgrading? Buy some UPGRADE CHANCE FOR UPGRADING stones. Want to upgrade the upgrade amount per upgrade? Buy some more unfair shit. 

Either spend your life playing this to get better or pay to improve instantly. If you don't believe me on how much of a big deal this game's in-game cash shop is, try it out for yourself. Hell I played this for 3 years and thought it was great, then I graduated elementary school and got a PC.
