Micron is an unabashed, lazy ripoff of Deflexion/Khet (Copyright Innovention Toys, LLC, 2005).  Many lazy ""amateur"" developers don't pay attention to their obligations under copyright law, and often steal the ideas of actual, real game developers without credit, such as the ""developer"" here has done.  At this stage no legal action has been taken by Innovention Toys, LLC against the ""developer"" here, but it's never off the table, as previous copyright law cases have shown.

Putting aside the unethical intellectual bankruptcy of stealing someone else's game concept for profit, this is also breaking that unwritten law of stealing other people's game ideas... you should at least try to do better than the game you're ripping off.  Micron is considerably worse than Deflexion/Khet.

Just like Khet, the game is played by arranging various blocks (in this case even less embellished than those in Khet) to reflect the course of ""bouncing balls"" which replace the laser in Khet's video game and physical variants.  Create the correct path to ""solve"" each puzzle level and move on to the next one.  There's also an annoying soundtrack that makes this mobile app significantly worse than Khet, which at least doesn't assault your ears. 

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The mobile app features extremely lazy, minimalist ""art"", of the type you normally expect to see in low effort Flash/browser games and mobile apps.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the mobile app unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The mobile app never really caught on with the millions of gamers on Steam, with a very low peak player count close to launch, and then just a handful of players launching this mobile app every couple of days.  This is undoubtedly caused by factors such as those raised in this review.  It's always helpful with buying decisions to consider how popular and successful the product is, and unfortunately while this did accumulate a few participation trophy reviews, overall, people just aren't using it.

So, should you buy this mobile app?

Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $3 USD, on app stores, it's $1 USD. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay THREE TIMES THE PRICE for a cheap mobile app just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this is a mobile app, is priced to insult and gouge PC gamers, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.

Since there's no story, we're jumping straight into graphics. 

Graphics:

Micron is a very minimalistic game, there's not much to talk about here, since it's all basically shapes on a colorful background. There's basically not much to talk about there, they do their job well enough. 

Audio:

Since Micron is a music driven game, the music has to be decent and since you have influence you're sort of helping to create the tunes. Every time you do something it adds another note to the music and most of the tracks are pretty catchy, albeit nothing incredibly in depth.

Gameplay:

The basic gist of Micron is you try to guide notes from one part of the grid to another by placing stuff on a grid to move those notes around, which creates music. It's a rather simple puzzle game it's starts of pretty easy and fun and quickly becomes much more complex as you play and more. There's roughly 60 levels to go through and they increase in difficult over time. 

A lot of the puzzles can actually be beaten if you listen into the music and honestly it's quite fun figuring out the pathing of where to place the paddles and if you mess up it's a quick reset so you can go back into solving without thinking too much about it.

I will say though I still feel there's a very small amount of puzzles and it would have been cool to see a few more really difficult ones and possibly a level creator, but since this is a port of a mobile game, I won't nag on it too much for that reason.

Verdict:

Micron is a fun little puzzle game, where you don't have to think about the story, just pick it up and solve puzzles. It's really fun and challenging and really cheap to boot, so if you want a fun little puzzle game, definitely check out Micron.

Pros:
+ Fun puzzles
+ Right amount of difficulty 

Cons:
- Way too short

Let’s solve some puzzles and maybe make some catchy tunes along the way with Micron.

[h1] The Good: [/h1] [i] Very nice interaction between gameplay & audio. [/i]

The puzzles for Micron are well done, with the gradual increase in difficulty done very well. There are a few optional levels when you play through the game’s main levels and there are a few extra levels available to try after you complete the main levels. If that’s not enough, there’s always the addition puzzles available in the Steam Workshop.

Another thing that I would like to point out is while you’re working to solve the puzzles, music will start playing, but it starts with little instruments and notes playing. As you add bumpers, or pieces, to the puzzle and it starts to interact, more instruments start to play and when you’ve solved it, it feels like you put together a nice audio track.

[h1] The Bad: [/h1] [i] Not being able to remove individual pieces from the level. [/i]

In each level, you are given a set number of bumpers, or pieces, to use in solving the puzzle. If you made a mistake, you have a reset button available to restart the level and try again. If you want to remove one, but not all the pieces, tough luck, because there’s only the reset button and that’s it. I suppose this is made to ensure that the game isn’t completely easy, but it feels like some of these puzzles can be solved by removing one piece.

[h1] The Ugly: [/h1] [i] Game better suited for mouse instead of keyboard & controller. [/i]

Micron is set-up to be played with either a mouse, a keyboard or a controller. After playing through the game with the mouse, I felt it was unnecessary for the developers to set-up keyboard and controller options. Main reason for saying this is because it feels much easier to play the game with the mouse.


Micron checks a number of boxes for me: Gameplay, check; Sound, check; Price, check. There’s no surprise for me to make a good recommendation for this game.",1530367003,1530367051,True,7,0,0.654508054256439209,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The puzzles range from easy to appropriately challenging, with 51 puzzles in the main game and 12 bonus challenges. New concepts are introduced slowly and build on previous concepts, allowing you to master one thing at a time. Completing the game takes a few hours in total, and overall the puzzles are medium difficulty.

What really stands out, however, is the use of music and rhythm. Every puzzle mechanic is synchronized with the music: at the basic level the balls are created once every 8 beats, playing a tone, and then as they interact with the objects you place they produce tones and variations in the music. It is hard to describe why, but this really completes the game experience. In effect, you are solving the puzzle and composing a rhythmic music pattern at the same time.

The levels are color-coded -- most mechanics are specific to a certain color, and each color has its own music track and tones. This way the music does not get monotonous and continues to be satisfying. I also appreciated that the bonus levels were gimmicky and fun, rather than trying to be too difficult or complicated.

TLDR: Niche type of game in which you place tiles to object route a ball towards a goal. I found it to be restrictive and boring despite the good audio due to emphasis on strict puzzles.

This is an object routing game - using a hex grid - in which you deviate the movement of a ball to have it reach an exit point. The options menu is very limited. Game fullscreens correctly. Xbox 360 pad detected correctly. If this was mobile its ported mostly competently. Aesthetics are simple but clean and effective. Sound design is surprisingly good despite its simplicity. 

This is not a music game or a rhythm game. But what sets it apart as a puzzle game is how the sound effects for the ball and the routing tiles end up making a sort of a song sometimes, and are mostly pleasing to the ear even when they do not. Which is why I have decided to put it in the Casual - Music category rather than the Casual - Object Routing one. 

I only played the initial few levels to assess the worth of the title so I cannot comment on the complexity of the puzzles. The initial ones were fairly simple.

Conclusion : Between the Xbox pad support, the vibration of the pad in synch with the sound effects, and the overall feeling of rhythm that the game uses to stay dynamic and interesting. You can tell there is a legitimate attempt to make a good game here but it just is not my cup of tea.",1494442707,1550425958,False,0,0,0.429394543170928955,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Graphics: Simple and elegant. Nothing overly elaborate, but again, unneeded for this type of game. Colorblindness was not an issue for me with the red/green in the game, so they must have been far enough apart. 

Gameplay: Simplistic and easy, when using the mouse. I tried with the controller which it supports but the d-pad movement is too fast, and the analog is a bit slippery. Could be my controller. Keyboard mouse was much easier for this. Difficulty doesn't scale too quickly and you have 51 primary levels to beat. Beat those and there are an additional 12 levels to bang your head against.... while enjoying the music. 

Overall: 7.3/10 - If you like puzzle/logic games, this is a definite must have. Challenging in the later levels, and may take a few tries to really get it, but you will get there eventually. Price tag of $5 isn't too bad for what it is. Personally I like discounts and this has been in several bundles. Will likely reappear in one, so if you see it there, be sure to grab it. Or just pay for it. If you get a coupon for 50% most people won't complain over that price tag for what the game is.",1464635329,1464635329,True,11,1,0.582739531993865967,0,False,False,False,False,,,

To look at it from the outside, it's a faily standard switch-pressing puzzler of which there have been quite a few.  However, Micron stands apart in a couple of ways:

1. It doesn't get stupidly hard (see caveat below)
2. It doesn't go on longer than it should
3. Each level doesn't take too long to complete

Most games of this time get to a point, and it's clear the developer's been holding back some painfully hard levels, and has run out of 'ramp up' levels, and all of a sudden drops you off a cliff.  You're sitting there looking a level thinking ""The last level took me 2 minutes, and I've been staring at this for more than 20. What happened?"" (I'm looking at you P.B. Winterbottom amongst others). This doesn't happen in Micron... The levels are iteratively harder, and many of the 'nice interlude' levels (as I think of them) give you a strong hint as to what the twist in the upcoming level is going to be, while being pretty easy in themselves.

There are some strategies you learn, and sometimes you just look at a level, the selection of pieces and it all just clicks.

Okay, here comes the caveat. There are a couple of levels which require you to do something a tad differently to the levels around them: Bonus 9 comes to mind.   For those, there was no choice but to go have a look at a hint.  Every permutation I tried just wouldn't work.  In those cases, it's usually because you need to do something with precision timing, and Ijust hadn't experimented enough.

I like the little tricks it plays with your assumptions on colours, and the ways it makes you think about stretching 'flight time' to synchronise events.

The game would have only taken me one evening to finish, if I'd played it in one sitting.  All in all, I think about 3 hours of playtime, which was perfect.

The puzzles are never really actually that hugely difficult, there were a few that caused me a couple or so more minutes of thinking to solve, but there were only a few of these within a total of 63 levels (including the bonus levels). 

Your actual goal is basically guiding these different colored balls towards the goal of the level by placing down varying types of barriers that will, depending on their direction and orientation, bounce them in a different direction. More and more obstacles will eventually be added throughout the game the more levels you complete, like colored lasers that won't let any differently colored balls through. 

Additionally, in various levels, you actually gain the ability to place portals to further influence your control on these various balls. While some of the latter levels are definitely far more complex than the early ones, I doubt a guide would be needed for most of the levels. Personally, for me, all of the main and bonus levels took me about an hour and a half in total to complete. While that's relatively a short amount of time, I enjoyed the puzzles, liked the look of the game, and especially enjoyed the music. Additionally, there are also Steam Workshop levels if one still wants to play Micron after they finish all the original levels. 

Ultimately, Micron is a rather enjoyable although not frustratingly hard musical somewhat short puzzle game that I would say if puzzle games are your thing, is worth the five dollar price as long as you're fine that it's somewhat on the short side. Otherwise, go for it when it's on sale or in a bundle you're already interested in.

Moments later I stumble upon the solution! I consider roughly waking my partner to show her how clever I am but remember that she is a pregnant insomniac and this may not go down well.

Micron turns out to be quite a lovely little puzzle game. It features a clean minimalist art style, clever and challenging level design and, best of all, a beautifully implemented audio system which syncs the impact of every pellet with a different sound depending on the surface it hits. At its best, this system provided some gorgeously atmospheric soundscapes with sweetly tinging xylophones and triangles mixing with bass and drums or sometimes, just the gentle sound of rain. 

It will take fourteen years for me to finish.

Es ist relativ simpel, macht ne Menge Spaß und ist dennoch kompliziert. Man hat halt nur wenige Bauteile zur Hand und insgesamt gibt es grade mal 4 Bauteile(wenn ich mich nicht irre). Die meisten Level waren ziemlich einfach und ich habe nicht lange dafür gebraucht, später wurde es dann schon öfters ziemlich knifflig. Ein Mal musste ich mir sogar nen Walkthrough angucken. Es ist trotzdem sehr entspannend und ich muss sagen, dass es mir wirklich Spaß gemacht hat. Das Einzige Negative ist zum Einen die Spielzeit von ca 3 Stunden (im Workshop gibt es derzeit 37 zusätzliche Level) und zum Andern dass man ein Level notfalls nicht überspringen kann. 
Postitv ist noch die angenehme Musik und die wechselnden Töne. Ein Mal hab ich mir nen netten Song gebaut und einfach mal so liegen gelassen ;)

Für 5 € kann man hier meiner Meinung nach nicht viel falsch machen, wenn man gerne mal tüftelt. Daher darf man zuschlagen :)

The first half of the game is fairly easy, the puzzles are not very complicated and have nice solving ideas that sometimes can seem to be repeating a bit too much, but this wasn't an issue for me. However, the last few levels are pretty difficult and the bonus levels are extremely challenging to the point of frustration because you might find yourself trying to come up with a solution for hours and you simply can’t find any. For those that want to obtain all the achievements in this game, this might be a bit annoying unless they resort to consulting a guide.

Also be warned that some of these puzzles are timed; you need to coordinate to the second the timing of placing the special blockers on the board. This again requires a lot of trial and error.

I’ve also tried a few levels from the workshop and they’re nice and enjoyable; I appreciated that the game automatically downloads the workshop items that I’ve subscribed to, without needing a restart.

Micron is a decent game, short and reasonable. I would consider it purely average, providing good gameplay with fair polish, but treading familiar ground.

I was expecting some rhythm elements, but they really don't exist. Each level has sounds associated with bullet reflections, which helps to generate the music. Nothing is really based on moving to the beat, and some puzzles require actions between the beats. Most levels don't require speed, but a few require timed actions to catch bullets at the right time. The difficulty curve varied widely due to these timing-based levels, forcing several restarts to complete. Still, the game is quite easy.

The music is fair, but is not a real gameplay element. Most levels are short and can only be solved in a certain way, so replayability only comes from Workshop levels. Puzzles were interesting but not hugely satisfying. Later levels became more frustrating, as one mistake meant a full restart. Once levels feature over 10 objects, I was wanting an Undo button instead of a full restart. Granted, it didn't take long, but the short game length could mean that 20% of your time is spent restarting and rebuilding levels.

Micron didn't do anything bad, but didn't inspire me much. It's a decent game at a fair price, a nice way to spend a few hours but not really compelling you to challenge your mind. I would recommend a sale above 50%, below $2.50 USD is a good time-value. If you are looking for rhythm gameplay, keep looking. But puzzle fans should find some entertainment here for a couple hours.",1421821052,1440727668,True,3,0,0.572300612926483154,0,True,False,False,False,,,

With its simplistic design and musical sound effects I found it quite enjoyable and would highly recommend it.  The concept is simple.  Balls are shot from an opening and you must place angles and or portals to get it to open doors and get them to the end.  The difficulty is you must put them in the proper spot at the proper time to achieve your goal.

    It is a great game for all ages however those under ten may need help to finish it unless they are unusually patient.  A great game to play with your children though.  Get their little problem solving wheels turning!  The game has some difficult levels but not overly so in my opinion.  I did however cheat on one of the bonus levels and look for the answer elsewhere.

    There are a number of free levels for download in the steam workshop as well.  Just subscribe to them and they will be downloaded the next time you start the game.

    I did not find any bugs and was not able to complete any level using less than the full complement of pieces provided.   Note: This is edited because I could not find the level editor. I did find the level editor it is in your steam files.

Micron is a puzzle game where the goal is to guide streams of bullets towards the exit by placing pieces that the bullets can bounce off of. It's a very simple concept that is immediately understandable, but it turns out that some very interesting puzzles can be created with it.

A number of obstacles present in the levels create the challenge of the game. Present in every level is a barrier that requires four bullets shots to destroy. These do not make much of a difference in the early levels, but create much of the challenge in the later levels where you are forced to cut off the source of your bullets in order to complete the level.
Gates which are initially closed also appear, and they must be opened by a bullet hitting the correspondingly colored switch. In levels with multiple switches of the same color, bullets must hit the similarly colored switches at the same time in order for the gate to open. Finally, there are barriers which only bullets of the same color can pass through.

Later on in the game, portals which the bullets can travel through are introduced. These are a nice addition that add further complexity to the game, but they also make you wonder whether there is anything else that could be added to the game, as they are the only pieces you can place that aren't ones that the bullets bounce off of. Why not have a ""vortex"" piece that always makes a bullet turn left or right? How about a ""splitter"" piece that duplicates a bullet? There is a lot of potential for the concept of this game, and I feel that it is not always realized fully.

The game is also rather short, with only 51 main levels and 12 bonus levels. Most of these are easy and can be solved within a few minutes, although a select few of the later levels are quite difficult. Steam Workshop support helps alleviate this a bit, but currently there are not many user levels available.

Despite this, for $4.99 ($1.49 in the current holiday sale), the game is cheap enough to warrant a purchase for any puzzle game fan interested. The game seems to take a ""quality over quantity"" approach, and for what the game is, that's perfectly fair.",1419448279,1419448279,True,3,0,0.559748470783233643,0,False,False,False,False,,,

游戏的机制和画面一样简单粗暴，从起始点不停会有小球按照一定节奏射出，玩家需要做的就是通过放置挡板（中期追加传送通道）来改变小球的路径，让小球达到目标终点就获胜，主要通过限制挡板使用来构成谜题。大部分的关卡只要通过直白的规划路径就能轻松过关，大概对大多数玩家都不是什么问题，后期关卡的难度主要体现在传送门和回弹挡板构成的路径会相对复杂，又或者要考虑中途添加挡板改变路径时对正在运动中的小球的影响

官方一共只设计了51关普通关和12关附加关，而且并没有非常复杂的关卡，较有难度的也就个别几关，一般一路玩下来平均也就3-4小时流程，卡关时在社区指南里就有现成的全攻略，而通关后即可获得全成就；作者用来延续游戏寿命的方法是追加了关卡编辑器，可以在Steam创意工坊里找到不少玩家自己设计的关卡，其中就有一些非常奇葩或者非常难的，有爱的同学们可以去试一下

本作最大的创意是将节奏感融入游戏中——在小球反弹时会发出固定的声音，随着路径的复杂化，反弹声所构成的曲调也会越来越复杂，配合小球射出时固有的节奏以及氛围音乐式的BGM的，混合后听起来会非常带感～ 因为乐律是由玩家编制的反弹路径而决定的，因此每关都不一样，由于这个创意所以在一定程度上也本作可以被归作音乐类游戏，虽然这对于谜题没有任何影响，但作为休闲游戏对于游戏体验有着不少的提升，好评

Micron is a 2D puzzle game where you have a grid of tiles and need to set diagonal or horizontal/vertical tiles in a way that balls - shot out by non-movable cannons - reach the exit. While this is easy at first, the puzzles get harder continuously, although only few are really difficult. Some can however be described as tricky - if you don't pay attention to the setup and pieces you have, you can't solve them, as you might need to use pieces for more than one purpose.

After all, it is a nice little game I would recommend for a price of maybe 1.50 to 2 Euro, as it will take you around two hours to solve everything, unless you get stuck on difficult puzzles.

A smaller version of the game is available for free on Kongregate.

(Tip : have maybe 2 hours so far i think but steam did not record since my internet goes off and on so i did play this game and reached far : )  )

With the great 8bit Soundtrack that is very retrolike ( i think ) and very great and funny :).

you basically just make the way for the bullet to reach the end by placing boarders of different shapes, the game keeps getting harder and harder the more you progress with it, and needs a bit of fast thinking in most levels.
i think there is about 60+ levels and with steamworkshop you can even find more and create your own levels, i really like that about puzzle games because there are a lot of very creative people out-there that can make a very intelligent and challenging levels, so having Steam Workshop is always a plus for puzzle games in my opinion.

The achievements are pretty reasonable nothing too complicated just basic stuff, that you can get by finishing the entire game.

if you like a funny type puzzle game that packs a challenge For 4,49$ im completely satisfied with it.
and hopfuly if they add trading cards that would just attract more and more Players because currently they are a big deal ( trading cards ) for people to buy small games.

Also the game works with (Touch) tablets and whatnot so thats also pretty cool : ) 
i for myself perfer a mouse altho it also works with a controller so it supports it all.
Windows, linux and mac ? Thats also admirable : )  10/10 for the entire game.",1406158413,1406158718,True,20,3,0.570663988590240479,3,False,False,False,False,,,
