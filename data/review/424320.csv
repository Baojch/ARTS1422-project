The puzzles are solved by rotating the rooms (some may say ""manipulating gravity"") -- sometimes rotating the room on only one axis, sometimes two axes, and sometimes all three.  There is a story, but it's frustrating because you'll miss a lot of it due to the fact that you need to find pieces of a translation matrix throughout the game, and the letters you haven't found yet won't appear in the story text (so the messages will be incomplete gibberish for a large part of the game).

For me, this game was equally fund and frustrating.  Solving the puzzles was fun.  The precision platforming required to reach the destination was frequently frustrating.  Also frustrating was the fact that nothing is explained and there is absolutely no direction.  Some may say ""you shouldn't need a game to hold your hand"", but running around for an hour trying to find the next puzzle is not my idea of fun.

- [b]Graphics:[/b] The first half of the game is primarily only blue and has more of a flat world lighting feel with fewer particle effects and other sources of different colors.
- [b]Story:[/b] While the execution is decent, and the story is more of a reason/backdrop for Ano, the premise is fairly generic.
- [b]Controls:[/b] Never before has rotating something 90 degrees the wrong way been so easy! (This isn't 100% the fault of the game)
- [b]Dialogue:[/b] Stop or something bad will happen! Okay, wait, NOW something bad will happen...I'm warning you!
- [b]Puzzles:[/b] The puzzles in much of the first half to 3/4th of the game are a bit too easy once you grasp the mechanics.
- [b]The End:[/b] No, not the ending of the game. The part where you think it's the end...then you have to do more platforming through a long hallway for no reason at all.
- [b]Tutorial:[/b] I like a game that doesn't hold your hand overly much, explains through show, not tell, and action. On the other hand, I thought my game was broken for a while because it doesn't indicate in any way that it is normal at first to not be able to understand the dialogue/language on the walls.

± [b]Holes:[/b] Not necessarily plotholes, but after beating it I want more explanation...or more appropriately, exploration of the story's characters and lore.

[h1]================[b]Overview[/b]===============[/h1]

Hi everyone and welcome to this review of Anomaly 1729!

[h1][b]Gameplay:[/b][/h1]
So Anomaly 1729 is a hidden gem, albeit perhaps a slightly unpolished diamond. If there was ever a sequel or a reboot in the far off future, let's say it is a title with a lot going for it that could easily be capitalized on. In Anomaly you are a humanoid...robot(?) with a very natural curiosity to explore the world around you. You quickly find that the world, however, has other ideas. It wants to keep you where you are, with your freedom and curiosity intanct. Or maybe it only wants to keep you away from the truth?

Well, the world does this by changing all around you, at first against your will. Doors close as you clear areas, new passages open, and you're often maybe not quite sure where to go first or if it's possible to get there. This makes an interesting parallel with Ano, as you the player has to have a natural curiosity to see more to drive you forward as forward is often...not forward, but in any number of places, and in all places. So the question in Anomaly, is where do you go first to progress when you have to go everywhere anyway? It's nice, because you are often left free to explore the areas that seem most interesting first.

As you progress in the game, you slowly get more ability to control the world. You can stop or start moving platforms, rotate them, or make something push instead of pull. Eventually this results in you rotating whole rooms and floors to your brain's utmost dismay. It's absolutely beautiful, but hard to keep track of. What was just the ceiling is now the floor. What is now the floor is now again that wall to the right in the room. And all of it so that you can get through that door in the left side of the room that needs to be the floor. Welcome to Anomaly 1729. The game that asks: How badly you want to get to the end while challenging you, teasing you, and inviting you in for more with it's intriguing story, simple and effective graphics, good music, and openly oppressive world ready to be conquered.

[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1]
The graphics in Anomaly 1729 are simple, and I would argue effective...just not at first. Blue, blue, and more blue, with perhaps a touch of gray. Eventually you get to darker blue. To be fair, in that stage of the game, things are simple and you are learning by doing and too much variety would detract from your ability to do so. It also works well with the story, as you are early on in a more innocuous area. I challenge you to bear with it, though, as once the game opens up the graphics really start to shine, literally. Textures that were repetitive get broken up by more individual feeling light sources, there's objects and particles everywhere, the level design becomes complicated, convoluted, and labyinthine resulting in a much more diverse and beautiful experience. Later on, it even becomes more obviously thematic. The visuals do a great job of representing the state of the world and its characters. Word around the block is that it makes for a gorgeous VR experience as well, although I wouldn't know personally.

[h1][b]Audio:[/b][/h1]
Okay, I'll come clean here: I absolutely love the sound the dialogue makes. I don't know why. It's just deeply satisfying for no other reason than some odd biological imperative or psychological effect/manipulation it was possibly designed to have. Moving on, though, there's not a whole lot to the audio of Anomaly 1729. The sounds are understated, concise, crisp, and then over. Again, this works well, as it leaves you free to think about the challenge and the world before you. That's not to say the audio feels empty or barren, although you may find yourself thinking that at a few points if you get stuck, as the music feels very dynamic and appropriately engaging if you pay attention but zen if you don't. The strength of the audio of Anomaly 1729 is that like the world, graphics, characters, etc. it all blends together to create a cohesive experience focused on solving the challenges and getting to the end of the world. So, how badly do you want to find out what's at the literal end of the world?

[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h1]
I am hesitantly recommending Anomaly [b]if you want something that challenges you[/b] at:

[b][i]Half price[/i][/b] if you want a fun 4-8 hour experience that may leave you scratching your head or:

[b][i]Full price[/i][/b] if you are a diehard puzzle game fan, like gravity/rotation puzzles, are addicted to games like Portal/The Talos Principle, etc.

But for either category you fall into, don't expect Anomaly 1729 to have quite the same level of polish or big budget value.  Anomaly does, however, very much make up for it with it's raw and free design that clearly has some heart and soul poured in.

Graphics were very nice. Particle effects. Good use of colors.

Level design was intricate in how the level(s) connect and reconnect to each other as you progress.

It doesn't have a tutorial and I never felt as if I needed one. The game does try and detect if you're stuck and give you an appropriate hint like ""the exit is only available if this like that"". I don't know how far I got into the game (the room after your character feels like it's ""grown so much"") so I don't know how long the complete game is.

The game would not recognize my Xbox One controller. Keys cannot be remapped (Azerty users better add a US-layout to Windows to switch to).

For weeks now on indie game sites, social media and such there seems to have been a bombardment of promotion for the game Anomaly 1729. Completing the game I understand why. I had not heard of it before and it was an easy purchase during the steam sale for $1 and its an easy recommendation to fans of puzzle platformers. Its has solid controls, platforming, story and unique mechanics that will keep you entertained for hours.

In Anomaly 1729 you play Ano a robot? Who is awakened? Created? Forced? Driven? To find meaning in the world of Phiohm and to find Yuler who is constantly warning you to stop. Why all the question ? Because completing the game it will be up to you to interpret the story. Could it be all a metaphorical interpretation  or is it simply a journey of Ano? I felt very surprised by the story and it has a satisfying conclusion with player choice at the end. However the lack of voice work and even the minimal sound for when text messages were being presented minimized the impact of the story. 

As you begin the game you find yourself staring at a wall of unreadable text. As you move forward you find a small station that unlocks the ability to translate some of the letters. These messages and stations are scattered throughout the world and there are also 10 unique stations holding the pages to the story of Anomaly. I only found 5 of the story pages as they can easily be missed but fortunately new game + allows you to carry those along with any of the found translations so some of the early messages will be readable. This whole aspect is unnecessary until you start new game + and understand that not being able to interpret those early messages leaves a sense a mystery to your journey. 

Anomaly 1729 does not stray too far from the puzzle platform blueprint. You enter an (hub)area, learn some mechanics, enter a puzzle room and solve the puzzle in order exit. It's all straight forward and even if you are a novice or veteran of puzzle platformers nothing will be difficult to process. While Anomaly is linear for the most part there is not an actual ""go here"" next sign and I found myself on numerous occasions asking where am I supposed to go. As for the puzzles themselves again a lot of it will be familiar for vets with platform moving, jumping and a few switches to interact with but the uniqueness for Anomaly 1729 lies in the ability to rotate the room left, right, forward and backward. it's a cool effect done with motion blur and it makes for some interesting puzzle solving. The only problem I encountered with this ability were some of the larger rooms, due to the number of objects and shape of the room, as it rotates you could accidentally find yourself on the ledge of a platform and able to access the exit without really solving it correctly, if that make sense? One last thing I want to mention is the absolute fantastic controls. If there has been one mechanic for indie games that has continued to improve over the years it is the controls especially when it comes to platforming. 

In terms of graphics the world of Phiohm could be viewed as a part of the Minecraft universe or Supermans fortress of solitude with its abstarct block shaped world and pitch black depths. That may be a turn off for some but has no impact for me personally. Anomaly also uses a a limited bright color scheme to bring some different aesthetic to areas with some cool lighting effects and that's fine but limited use of shadows is noticeable and it can make the world seem more lifeless. It still looks OK but some more attention to small details and effects would have improved the visual experience. This lack of attention also goes to the sound which is noticeably lacking. Though the soundtrack is pretty good with its use of sci-fi tones it's the lack of and minimal use of sound effects that is obvious and again impacts the experience.

Anomaly 1729 is the first puzzle game I didn'tt have to look up (Ill grind out wrong solutions for hours before caving) a walkthrough for any of the puzzles in a long time and that itself makes it worthy of a stress free recommendation. It's not without faults due to the exclusion of some better graphical effects and sound that would have made the experience more enjoyable but it does not overall impact the gameplay. I enjoy a good puzzle game and with its unique mechanic, solid platforming and story Anomaly 1729 is just that, a good puzzle game.

I hope I can attract more potential buyers with my review and yes I payed for the game and bought it on Steam. 
This game was on my wishlist and as I saw it on sale it was an instabuy.
The biggest anomaly  besides the game's title is the low player count reflected by the lack of reviews. 
Then again to gain visibility with 10000+ games on Steam is a hard thing indeed.
The games style is minimalistic and as a fan of cyberspace environments I like it. 
The game's soundtrack is ideal to chill out. The idea of the game is deceivingly simple like a Rubik cube. 
You navigate from entrance to level exit by rotating the environment and you'll soon notice that this is 
easier said than done. 
The game's engine is Unreal 4 enough said. Movement is responsive and precise as it should be for platforming.
The settings menue is as minimalistic as the game itself and I wish for a gamma setting. 
How to play is pretty much self explanatory so the tutorial consists only of short in game hints.
I envy gamers  having a VR set to play this gem.

But then I loaded up Anomaly 1729... Man what an incredible experience!

The dancing particles look like you can reach out and touch them, the world rotation is super tripy, but what really struck me was how the scale of world seemed to open up.

Most of the puzzles involve hitting lever #1 to invert gravity or shooting lever #2 to rotate platforms.  There's a lot of trial and error in the steps but it is honestly one of the most rewarding things to beat one of the levels in the game and continue on.

- Puzzle confusing enough, but this one keep interest me while actually this type of game not really my cup of coffee. ""Third person, 3D-space-rotating puzzle""; well played Dev, well played.
- About setting, there are no in-game brightness or gamma setting. It was really really dark, darker than a horror game until I manually setting my screen's gamma and brightness. Not a real problem.
- There are no tutorial or clue about how I play this game, or the exit sign and enter sign, or how the gun works. You need to explore yourself, [b][u]which is a good thing in puzzle game[/u][/b].
- Firstly I thought this game is not optimized well until I realized that this one built on UE4. My bad, my rigs is a little bit outdated. But most of you will experience it well. It looks beautiful!

Talk about a beautiful game. If you are into puzzle and exploration games, this is right up in your alley. In the same field as Portal, this hidden gem is easily comparable to some of the greatest puzzle games out there. Although there are some small flaws in the game, it doesn't stop it from being as great as it is.

Jumping right into the game, you are welcomed by a simplistic, yet perfect menu. It shows the title of the game and there are a very small amount of sub-menus. The rest of the screen is covered by a neat animation of one of the rotary blocks. The only issue I had with the menu was the text, and this bothered me throughout the entire game. I think it could be made more legible with the used of an outline for the letters or simply just making the text bolder.

The music in the menu was great, and is great throughout the game. One thing I did notice, and this is because I am a musician therefore am very picky with the music, but there was a lack of low end. The music could have been a little more bassy. Also, I only noticed this during the main menu, but at the end of the song, there was a crackling. This could have been intentional though, I am not too sure.

In the options menu, I wasn't able to change the graphics quality in the visual details option. It was set to low and I was trying to set it higher. This changed after a minute of hitting all the buttons on the keyboard, but the cursors were still a little messed up.

The game starts off with a beautiful cutscene showing off the environment of the game. Now I do love watching these cutscenes, but some people don't. I think the lazy gamers should be able to skip cutscenes.

Anomaly requires more thinking rather than throwing you in constant action. You will be challenged with many obstacles, and unfortunately there is no tutorial, so you will be sent out to figure the game out on your own. Now, I don't like this approach, but some people might. I think a tutorial could be implemented somehow in the game. It took me very long to figure out how to work the game.

One last small thing is the aiming. I think the sensitivity should be adjustable and I also think that the hitbox for the rotary cubes should be made bigger. The precision in your shooting sometimes has to be a little too perfect.

There isn't much to complain about when it comes to actual game play. This game plays and looks beautiful. I am very impressed by this game. I see this game becoming very successful if the developers listen to what the gamers have to say. I think also bringing down the price (in the current state that is is), or adding it to indie game bundles, could bring in some more attention to the game and maybe some critical acclaim.

What a huge surprise. This game is one of the better puzzle games I have played in a long time. If you are looking for a hidden golden gem buried along with thousands and thousands of games in the store, this is one of them.

The graphics are very gorgeous, futuristic, and minimalist all at the same time which gives you a feeling of calm and peace. Awesome. 

My favorite part of this game is that it gives me a feeling of being a foreigner in a very unknown and confusing world. The confusing and foreign texts are well done that they really made me feel like a foreigner struggling to find a way out of an unknown country.

Now, how are the puzzles? The puzzles in general are very well done. Sometimes they require plenty of second thoughts and deeper thinking as the puzzles get harder and harder. The awesome combination of blue/orange trigger weapon, jumping platforms, and large trigger objects that changes the dimensions and gravity is insane fun. That was what I was looking for when I bought this game.

Basically, this game is a baby of Fez and Portal. If you like those games a lot, you will like this game without a doubt. 

Still blows my mind how criminally underrated this game is. Solid puzzle game.
