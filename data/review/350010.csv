I only played for roughly more than two hours.

It was straightforward, voice acting is actually one of the engaging one in my opinion. You can also keep pressing your left click to speed up the dialogues. I hoped they kept it that way for future releases. Recent Artifex Mundi games reuse voice actors. The puzzles varied from the latest releases as well, meaning if someone plays the recent releases and play this game after, the puzzles in this game aren't similar. The achievements are also easy to get.

However, as such positives entail, the game is also bugged with criticisms. The story is straightforward and only a few actions can be done in one scene. Some animations of taking items were clunky and robotic, and the scenes were blurry most of the times so it was difficult to see the items. The character movements seem flat, and the ending is pretty much just [b][i]Poof! You saved the day![/i][/b]

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The novelty of some of the mechanics makes up for some of the deficiencies in the gameplay.

[u]Critique[/u]: This is a remaster of an early Artifex Mundi game. Comparing it to other early games from the studio, I feel like I have a pretty good idea what has been updated. The cut scenes now have the creepy deepfake animation that the studio has used so much, where a static image is stretched and squashed to give the appearance of movement, rather than using more traditional 2D or 3D animation. Voice acting has been added, and I suspect that the graphics on many of the mini-games have been revamped. But the hidden object scenes are definitely old-school Artifex Mundi, where most of the challenge is accomplished by the difficulty of spotting items in grainy, low-detail images in very cluttered scenes. It doesn't help that there's frequently also imprecise names of the things you are trying to find: ""candle"" could mean a candle, or it could mean a candelabra, or a candlestick...basically anything related to a candle. So you often don't really know what you're looking for; the words are more [i]clues[/i] that you have to [i]interpret[/i], rather than lists of [i]objects[/i] you need to [i]find[/i]. That said, I liked the progression and flow of this game: gathering the seven rings in the different eras gave the game a fun, cyclical feel AND gave a sense of progression: you always know how far you are in the game when you know that there are seven parts.

The story is typically hilarious nonsense. At this point, having played so many hidden object games, I welcome the ridiculousness and look forward to how each game might top the previous ones in their B-movie drama, bizarre plot twists, flat vocal performances, and broken English. That said, because I played the second and third games first, the story here seemed like an unnecessary rehash, or an inferior prequel, to those games, which tell the story of the danger to the future much more effectively.

[u]Review[/u]: Vivian's dad has been kidnapped by a Borg weirdo. Everybody has creepy deepfake animation that is particularly bad. [spoiler]Advised by a sentient crystal ball that she finds among her father's effects, Vivian has to travel through several centuries to retrieve magic Ambrose rings. Each time period consists of three or four location screens and a few hidden object puzzles. This is to get the next time period's magic ring. Then, returning to the lab with the ring for the next time period, you add the ring to a time machine. Then you go into a storage room to perform another hidden object scene, collecting various items ostensibly to gather artifacts from that ring's time period. There are two views of this storage room (left and right), which you will see again and again and again as you proceed through the game...though the objects you are trying to find have been moved around each time. Then, when you have all the items, you put them in a hopper on the time machine to unlock the portal to go to that century. When you have done that, you have to solve a ""find the seven differences"" puzzle to activate the time machine. You do all of these things seven times, once for each time period. In the end, the borg weirdo is actually a benign time traveler who was looking to get help from your dad, who was so absent-minded that he got lost, rather than getting kidnapped. So the game ends on a denouement that sort of sets up the second and third game.[/spoiler]",1701798293,1701798293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

No, do  not play this game.  The gameplay is as basic as possible and it's so very, very, very old.

One of the pleasures of hidden object adventure games is looking at beautiful artwork.  This game is so terribly [i]un[/i]-pleasant to look at.

This is one of those ancient HOAGs that has been ""remastered.""  I don't know anything about the original game, but I can tell it was a 4:3 aspect ratio game.  For this version, they made the mistake of having it widescreen by default, causing the background images to appear horizontally stretched.

Don't play this game, but if you do, [b]I strongly suggest that you run the game at a 4:3 aspect ratio, rather than 16:9.[/b]  The only way to do this is change the desktop to a resolution with 4:3 aspect ratio.  I used 1024x768, which is the 4:3 equivalent of 1366x768.

Grungy, grimy, aliased, grainy, stinky low res images make hidden object scenes much more challenging than they should be.  Many objects are nearly invisible!  It's not even just the very poor image quality, these developers were sneaky jerks with hiding stuff!

I checked other reviews and noticed that people claim that it is bad because old. But I disagree - it's just bad. Age is not the case here. It's just lazy, boring and low quality product.

Story. Dumb and primitive. Even by HoG standards. This entire 'time travelling' thing is not developed anyhow. You are just randomly jumping into different time periods. Characters? -  absolutely unremarkable. To meet and to forget. The main caracters or the secondary ones - doesn't matter.

Gameplay and visuals. Yes, I put them together, because poor visuals also affect the gameplay. Local HoGs are very boring and repetative. Each time, after you visit new time periods, you come back to the same location and repeat the same boring HoGs. And completing them is not that easy task, because due to poor visuals, you often have to guess what exactly you see in front of you. Some locations, like a parlor, look absolutely ugly - it's just overstretched low-res jpeg.

Voiceacting and animations. They are not just mediocre, they also exist separately from one another. Sometimes you can see a character speaking without any animations. Another time - dude clearly says something and makes some gesticulation, but you can't hear anything. Bugged? Forgot to voice it? - no idea.

Something good? - YES! Suddenly - fascinating medieval BGMs. Really cool. Honestly, they deserve a better game. But in the end - this is 'NO' from me. Only if you want to get it for cards and achievements - grab it on good sale. Yes, this game is a part of a serie, but local events are barely related to other games, so you can safely ignore it.",1699532677,1699532677,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[*] love to play HOGs and may need to fill the void after running out of Artifex Mundi games to play
[*] want to see the ""beginnings"" of Artifex Mundi's journey into HOGs (as this is one of their first games)
[/list]

[b]In slightly-less-short[/b]
The story was [i]illogical[/i]
I personally don't have any big hate towards a bad or slightly illogical story in a HOG - I feel like they are often hit or miss when I try to check out a new game.
[i]However[/i], this one did manage to disappoint me. I personally love a good villain, so the idea that [spoiler]the supposed villain (kidnapper) you were chasing throughout the game was actually just some misunderstood guy trying to get help to save the world[/spoiler] ... it left me disappointed and kind of bored, to say the least.

The puzzles were [i]fine[/i].
I genuinely got excited at having to play some games of Mastermind for two of the puzzles, although I can imagine it would be a bit difficult to grasp the mechanics if you are not familiar with Mastermind in the first place.
Other than that, most of the puzzles felt a bit lack-lustre, and a majority of the HO scenes really irritated my eyes, because they were much too bright and the lighting kept pulsing (which I'm really hoping doesn't carry over into the second and third game in the series ;-;). Also... why so many spoons and flutes? Please explain.

The visuals were [i]unintentionally funny[/i]
As always, we have the well-known style that permeates every Artifex Mundi HOG. Beautiful and classic; it gives me a sense of comfort and nostalgia whenever I start a new game and see it. Except... this time it's less refined.
I'd say more than 50% of the HO scene art gave off ""we have HO scene art at home, though"" vibes. To be honest it just makes me grateful for how far Artifex Mundi has come on their HO scenes and their art in general.
The animation also isn't any exception to the ""unintentionally funny"" title. You really wouldn't think you'd be laughing much while the characters are having a Serious(TM) conversation about your father's kidnapping, but the way the faces wobble about because of the awkward (attempt at) animation really gave me a good chuckle - especially seeing as it wasn't particularly in sync with the voice over. Honestly creepy enough it could be used for a great horror HOG... And, again, I'm so deeply grateful for how far A.M. has come!

All in all, I'd give this game a 3.5/10, especially compared to many of A.M.'s other games. Still, if it's on sale, and you enjoy HOGs in general, [i]and[/i] you have a spare ~3 hours, might as well give it a whirl.

Broken game.. If you are one of those players that detest skipping mini-games, do not play or buy this. It comes to a point of a mini-game that because people figured out the solution, they introduced a random number generator (the rune lights-on/off game) that makes the game unsolvable.
And frankly the rest of the game is not much to look at or play with.. Doesn't help that the HOG parts have some really small pieces that you pixel hunt for..

First, there is a lot I like about it also. There are a lot of dialog scenes in the game, far more than most I have played, and I did enjoy that. The animations were a little janky since these early games mostly transform 2D shapes for animating things like talking as opposed to actually drawing all the frames, but it has a classic PC-CDROM charm to it.

This game had some of my favorite non-hidden object puzzles in a long time too. Some of them I just liked and didn't mind that they've been used in other games, but some were completely new to me and it had me wondering why I hadn't seen them used since in other games.

Lastly, speaking of puzzles, if the hidden object part of these games are your favorite puzzles, there are a TON of them in this game, more than in any other one of these games I've tried by a very wide margin.

But this is part of the issue for me. Because the game is older, a lot of the textures lacked the kind of detail you need to find these hidden objects properly, even with the remastering. But that aside, I also didn't really enjoy the puzzles and object locations at all. I know that all of these games attempt to hide or disguise the objects to a degree, but a lot of these were ridiculous and seemed to be hidden extremely aggressively on purpose. Typically, the objects stand out in some way or another, but these were mostly mundane things hidden among even more everyday objects. Some were named wrong, like a ""candle"" actually being just a candlestick.

The story also was mostly OK, except an important event at the end of the game isn't even revealed. I'll try to avoid spoilers, but the game ends very quickly in a nonsensical way, and doesn't explain or even reveal what this major catastrophe is that the game is building towards and is supposedly the crux of why the events of the game play out. Maybe trying to set up for a sequel, but regardless, this was not appreciated.

There is also one unmissable instance of part of the voice actor's dialog being said by a Microsoft Sam-type generated voice-- it's unclear if this was in the original, I assume strongly that it's part of the remaster and something they had to do because the original voice actor wasn't available anymore when the remaster was done, but it's just so noticeable and egregious. They try to add more exposition with it, which the game desperately needs, but it doesn't succeed, and so it's very jarring for no payoff.

The concept of the game and story was honestly fine, but because of the issues with it, I really wouldn't recommend it, there are better games you can play instead.

I did not encounter any technical issues while playing this game, and there is no bonus adventure. There are no collectibles, so you should at least be able to get all the achievements in one playthrough, although that ""finish any hidden object puzzle in 1 minute or less"" was brutal with the kinds of hidden object puzzles this game has.",1679118222,1679118222,False,2,0,0.50898975133895874,0,True,False,False,True,,,

From the first glance you can tell that it's an older game. It reminds me a lot of old point and click adventures, it has a similar vibe as [i]Atlantis[/i] (one of my favorite games by the way) for example. Graphics are older, but full of details and colorful. Character animation offers great laughs as their heads are so strangely moving during speaking. Gameplay wise there are a lot of hidden object scenes with a lot of items in them. Also there was usually some flashing light or something like that which made the searching a little harder. Puzzles were good.
Only complaint I have is for the UI design. I am now familiar with the concept that on the left side you have a menu with a diary and on the right side you have a hint. Here it is swapped so I had to control my urge to click it when quitting the game as I would hit the hint and would lose my achievement. ;)

Anyways, this is among the earlier Artifex Mundi games, it likely won't please fans of the newest games much.
Story is a bit wacky as it is for the earlier games, which is kinda funny in it's own way.

As for mechanics... there is a whole lot of focus on hidden object parts, and as an earlier game, it has the usual problems - low res photos, wonky scaling, some objects that are very hard to see due to the low image quality, weird lighting, a few misnamed objects, hidden object scenes that apparently have multiple items that matches names but only one is the right one.
There are also a few puzzles, one that got me so fed up that I had to skip. Nothing particularly wrong with it, it's just a type of puzzle that gets to my nerves super fast... first time seeing it in an Artifex Mundi game though.

But despite being short, even then there was a bit of economy on the number of different scenes side.
You basically pass through a time portal alternate dimension multiple times over, and each time you will search for objects in the same exact room, and go through a ""find the differences"" puzzle type thing multiple times. They are of course different each time, but it's still the same room and mechanic.

Getting closer to the end of the story the hidden object part ramp up considerably. Oh, despite being remastered, this one also has no bonus game... not a problem, but just so you know.

Again, I personally like playing the earlier games because I like to see how the genre evolved over the years for Artifex Mundi, but if you are more of a fan of the newer titles, be aware that it can be pretty crude in comparison. If you don't mind though, I do recommend.",1650098761,1650098761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Intro[/h1]
[b]Time Mysteries: Inheritance - Remastered[/b] is a hidden object game where you have to find 7 rings to save your father. The game has a lot of hidden object minigames compared to other [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/artifexmundi]Artifex Mundi[/url][/i] games in general with harder difficulty.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- 2 difficulties
- Some objects in hidden object scenes are tricky to find

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Progression is too redundant
- Sometimes it is hard to know how puzzles work at first glance

[b]Specs[/b]
Intel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b]
[i]The game has aged too much to enjoy to its fullest. There are better Artifex Mundi games that you can buy at the same asking price.[/i]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
As I said before, the visuals have aged. Characters look weird whenever they are moving since the game tends to stretch the image in an awkward angle to simulate their movement. Moreover, the 3D backgrounds are too plain to see. The game still looks great in the hidden object scenes though since they are drawn in 2D, albeit a bit blurred.

[h3]Story[/h3]
To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to the story. My focus was shifted to the awkward movement that the character does from time to time, which is too funny to ignore. All dialogues revolve around the main objective that is given at the beginning although there will also be other tasks that await you in order to collect 7 rings that are needed to finish the game.

The story can feel confusing due to the time travel. You will have a new task whenever you time travel to a new era, although the game tends to skip introductions whenever the character arrives for the first time. New characters will appear out of nowhere and the main character will act as if she already knew that character for a long time.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game is a combination of hidden objects, find 7 differences, and puzzles, with the hidden object minigame as the main focus. However, the gameplay loop is too repetitive with you having to do a combination of those 7 times before you finish the game. Moreover, there wasn't much break time between the hidden object scenes. It was exhausting to have another hidden object scene right after I finished the previous one.

The hidden object's gameplay is similar to other [i]Artifex Mundi[/i] games in general with you having to find objects from the given words. There aren't many words that are too confusing in this game, although objects tend to be hidden in a way that makes them hard to find. I admit that I had difficulties finding some of them - I even had to take a break from time to time to shift my focus for it.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=399841610 

It's hard to know how puzzles work at first glance. There might be an instruction on how to finish them, but I didn't notice that the button exist until halfway in the game. Moreover, the puzzle looks simple enough to solve at first - it's just that it's unclear as to what I should do to figure out the solution. Take the Hanoi Tower puzzle for example. I wasn't sure whether I should build the tower on the left, middle, or right side. The hints that are given without looking at the instruction are not obvious enough to notice.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished the game in 3h in the easiest difficulty, although it can be finished shorter depending on your skill. It took me some time to finish the hidden objects and find 7 differences minigames since I wasn't sharp enough to find the objects. If you don't want to play the hidden object minigames, you can switch it with match-3 minigames, although I didn't use it much due to the achievements that require me to finish the game by clearing the hidden object minigames. The game also offers a hint button if you need it, which again, can't be used for achievement hunters due to the achievement constraint.

As for the puzzles, most of them are easy enough if you know what to do, but I had difficulty with one puzzle. Luckily, there is a skip button for those who don't care about achievements.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Time Mysteries: Inheritance - Remastered[/b] is a solid hidden object game that has poorly aged. Despite the good British voiceover, the story looks like a joke with the animations, which I was too focused on due to its weirdness. Moreover, the story itself can be confusing with new characters and plots that are appearing from a new timeline, and the new plot won't be relevant after you shifted to another timeline. Since there are better [i]Artifex Mundi[/i] games that you can buy at the same price, I couldn't recommend this game, although those who like hidden object minigames could still give the game a try since the quality was better than the newer [i]Artifex Mundi[/i] games.",1643866332,1643873486,False,19,1,0.7415962815284729,9,False,False,False,False,,,

Например, тут есть несколько локаций, в которых, как мне кажется, разрешение исходного изображение составляет 640×480, не больше. А это ещё и ремастированная версия 2014 года! Что же тогда было в оригинале?

Большого спроса с казуальных квестов с поиском предметов у меня нет. Поэтому я не упоминаю сюжетную составляющую, не задаю вопросов по поводу логики действий героев и т.д. Для меня это просто развлечение на вечер, где можно одну за другой щёлкать базовые головоломки. [b]Time Mysteries[/b] прекрасно с этим справляется!

Но, как я уже писал выше, именно с картинкой я не смог смириться. И дело не только в её качестве. Думаю, что было плохой идеей добавлять скачки яркости (эдакое постоянное мигание) во время поиска предметов в некоторых локациях.

Improvements need to be made in the graphics for hidden object scenes. They tend to be a bit blurred. Some items were invisible (too opaqued), some were stretched a bit out of aspect ratio.  The room you go to in the museum to find objects to take for the next era was masked with a white layer and blurred, probably to give it an other-worldly feel.  Many objects sat on shelves in the back and sides and were too tiny to see well.

You follow a regular rhythm of hidden object scenes, find the differences, and time traveling.  So there are many HO scenes.  

I would love to see the story filled out and the graphics for the HO scenes improved.  The ending seemed a bit abrupt.  Still, I would like to see a sequel, and hope that growth and improvement come with time.

[h1]Unteres Ende des Wimmelbild-Spektrums[/h1]

Time Mysteries ist im Original von 2010 und das merkt man, trotz des Remasters von 2014. Es unterbietet auf mehreren Ebenen die niedrigen Erwartungen, die man an diese Art von Spielen eh schon hat. Es sei gleich mal dazugesagt, dass HOPAs mein Guilty Pleasure sind und ich nicht nur allgemein, sondern auch speziell in diesem Genre kein sehr kritischer Spieler bin - was z.B. Story oder Grafik betrifft. In diesem Fall, obwohl ich mich auf (m)eine Art unterhalten fühlte, stelle ich objektive Argumente über mein persönliches Empfinden und rate von dem Spiel ab - zumindest zum ""Vollpreis"".

[h1]Technik[/h1]

TM läuft natürlich wie ein übliches Wimmelbildspiel ab: man wechselt von Szene zu Szene, sammelt Inventargegenstände, löst Minispiele, und lässt seine Augen durch Wimmelbilder kreisen. Das funktioniert auch alles gut. Das grafische Manko ist, dass das Spiel gefühlt nicht oder nicht konsequent auf 16:9 umgestellt wurde (erscheint mir teilweise gestreckt) und v.a. die Wimmelbilder nicht auf HD aktualisiert wurden. Dadurch, dass sie in dieser Ära (um 2010 oder früher noch) sehr filigran waren, wird die Sache doch sehr erschwert.
Nicht zu vergessen wäre es, dass Charaktere jetzt, vermutlich als Upgrade zum Original, in den Cutscenes ""sprechen"": die starren Figuren wurden in Sprache und Mimik rudimentär animiert, indem man ihnen die entsprechenden Teile verzerrt hat. Das ist mit diesem einfachen Mittel teils und den Umständen entsprechend erstaunlich gut gelungen, andererseits sehen nun die meisten Charaktere aus wie Blubberköppe: nicht nur Mund oder Augenpartie werden bewegt, es wabert der ganze Kopf. Unfreiwillig komisch.
Die Musik empfand ich insgesamt als mäßig, da ich auf Dauer nicht auf mittelalterliches Geklimper und Gezupfe stehe.
Die sprachliche Vertonung ist bis auf eine Figur in Ordnung. Der Zeitreisende ist eher ein Laie bei der Lokalisierung, spricht aber auch nur zum Ende was und auch nicht viel.

[h1]Rätsel[/h1]

Es gibt viele Wimmelbildszenen, das ist grundsätzlich gut. Aber einiges konnte ich daran auch nicht so gut genießen.
1. Sie sind teilweise pulsierend mit Licht durchflutet, was eher nervt
2. Das Museum der Zeit muss man immer wieder durchqueren - nicht mein Lieblings(wimmel)raum
3. Objekte sind teilweise in Form UND Farbe super deckend angepasst, oder so hinter anderen Objekten versteckt, dass man wenig Chancen hat, irgendwelche markanten Umrisse überhaupt nur zu entdecken.
4. zu den üblichen Übersetzungsfehlern kommen auch noch unklare Bezeichnungen, z.b. ein Kerzenhalter ohne(!) Kerze, der aber als Kerze gesucht ist...

Überraschenderweise haben die Wimmelbilder am Ende an Gemeinheit verloren und waren plötzlich (zu) einfach. Nur warum fehlte hier die Konsequenz? Entweder das Eine oder das Andere, besser noch ein Mittelding, das wäre meins gewesen.

Die Minispiele sind fast allesamt nicht schwer zu lösen, trotzdem wäre es fair, wenn es bequemerweise eine kleine Erklärung gäbe, wie (nach welcher Logik) sie funktionieren bzw. was das Ziel ist. Das habe ich zumindest bisher in allen anderen Wimmelbildspielen so gesehen.

Weitestgehend logisch ist aber zumindest alles. Weil jedes Zeitalter nur wenig Raum/Räume bietet, sind die ""adventurigen"" Verwicklungen, das Hantieren mit dem Inventar, nicht allzu arg.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Geht ohne große Umschweife, aber leider auch sehr undetailliert vonstatten. Ehe man sich's versieht, reist man durch die Jahrhunderte, man kommt thematisch überhaupt nicht richtig rein. Physikerin, Kristallkugel, Zeitreiseapparat zum Aktivieren und ruckzuck werden die Jahrhunderte abgeklappert. Der Plausibilität des Ganzen hätte es nicht geschadet, wenn man da etwas mehr Mühe in die ganzen Zusammenhänge gesteckt hätte. Hauptcharakter Vivian wird in egal welcher Zeit stets so empfangen, als wäre das ganz normal, und sofort steht fest, was zu tun ist. Zudem läuft alles sehr linear ab: so lange Rätsel lösen, bis man in den Besitz eines der sieben fehlenden Ringe gerät, zurück ins Museum der Zeit, Ring einsetzen, kurzes ""finde die Unterschiede""-Rätsel lösen, neue Gegenstände für das nächste Jahrhundert zusammenwimmeln und ab geht's wieder zurück in der Zeit.
Der Begleiter an der Seite des Spielers ist eine sprechende Zauberkugel. Schon recht albern. Nicht dass das Spiel diese Albernheit nicht sogar wollen würde, aber das trägt nicht zur Glaubwürdigkeit der Story bei.
Irgendwie kam ich atmosphärisch auch überhaupt nicht in die Geschichte rein. Jedes Zeitalter besteht aus 2-3 Szenen und es kommt wenig Gefühl für das Setting auf. Nirgendwo findet man sich ein, man springt nur ständig von hierhin nach dorthin und schon ist die nächste Epoche ohne große Nachwirkungen abgehakt.
Leider ist inhaltlich nur ein kleiner Twist drin - den man allerdings ahnen konnte.
Als Trilogie bleibt wenigstens das Ende offen und lädt zum nächsten Teil ein.
Persönliche Note: ich hätte beim Thema Zeitreisen gerne ein wenig mehr Sci-Fi Thematik drin gehabt, aber es läuft Artifex-typisch wieder auf Übernatürliches/Magie hinaus. Leider geht's auch hauptsächlich ins zweite Jahrtausend. Für die folgenden Teile würde ich mir ja mal einen Blick in die Zukunft wünschen - oder meinetwegen auch den in eine ganz ferne Vergangenheit.

[i] Time Mysteries: Inheritance (Remastered) - обновленная версия hidden objects-квеста от именитой студии Artifex Mundi. Игра находится в Steam с октября 2014 года и на данный момент имеет 270 отзывов, лишь 45% которых дают ей положительную оценку. Разберемся подробнее. [/i]

[u] [b] СЮЖЕТ [/b] [/u]

История квеста ведется от лица молодой девушки по имени Вивьен Эмброуз. Возвращаясь в дом своего отца, она обнаруживает, что тот куда-то бесследно исчез. После тщательных обысков дочь выясняет, что папаня в свободное не пойми от чего время занимался изучением временных аномалий. Более того, в одной из комнат Вивьен обнаруживает устройство, позволяющее - ни много ни мало - отправиться в прошлое. Возможно, именно там она и найдет разгадку исчезновения своего отца. 

[u] [b] ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ [/b] [/u] 

Серия Time Mysteries была одной из первых проб еще когда-то начинающей польской студии Artifex Mundi, позднее сделавшей имя на самых разных циклах и одиночных квестовых приключениях. И, в общем-то, огрехи и недоделки тут бросаются в глаза, даже не смотря на то, что данная версия игры - не оригинальная, а претерпела ремастер. Большую часть прохождения вместе с незадачливой путешественницей во времени нам предстоит заниматься сценами с поиском предметов. Причем, зачастую, буквально в одних и тех же зонах. Помимо hidden objects представлен также ряд головоломок, большая часть которых из крайности в крайность либо слишком просты, либо, напротив, нелогичны и зубодробительны, и не вызывают ничего иного, кроме как желания пропустить. 

[u] [b] ПРОЧЕЕ [/b] [/u] 

Решив ""выделиться"", Artifex Mundi запряглись и сделали для внутриигровых диалогов (которых, к слову, довольно немало) между персонажами лицевую анимацию, ставшую впоследствие лютой притчей во языцех. Выглядит настолько ""крипово"", что Outlast порой нервно покуривает в сторонке. А вот чего игре действительно не достает - это сколько-нибудь толкового сюжета. Без особых объяснений перескакивая с одного временного промежутка в другой, мы будем бродить по рандомным арт-сетам, кое-как задним числом пришитым к нашей истории, только для того, чтобы закончилось все и вовсе лютой Санта-Барбарой. Нет, я понимаю что просить от квеста остросюжетную движуху - это моветон, но все же, будучи знакомым с другими играми этой студии, смело заявляю что тут они вообще даже не старались. Графическая часть тоже подкачала - эффект ""коллажа из газетных вырезок"", хоть и не так ярко бросается в глаза, но чем дальше, тем сильнее портит общее впечатление. 

В наличии имеется русская локализация и набор достижений Steam, половина из которых выполнены в задротном стиле ""успей за три секунды"" / ""не используй подсказок"" / ""ничего не пропускай"" / ""получи ачивку если уже собрал все ачивки"". В общем, не серьезно, товарищи. Если не заморачиваться на получение вышеописанного, то 3-4 часов за глаза хватит на полное прохождение. 

[u] [b] ИТОГ [/b] [/u]

По итогу, можно сказать, что первая часть серии Time Mysteries даже в ремастерном виде оставляет желать много лучшего, и уж совершенно точно не стоит 219 р. Если и брать - то только по очень хорошей скидке, но имейте в виду - это одно из слабейших творений студии.

Also, the achievements are limited and can be gotten in a single playthrough. There's not hidden items to find, you don't even need to play on expert mode, which makes finishing this game with all achievements ridiculously simple.

I skipped most of the story because, frankly, there was no achievement to watch all cut scenes. And these games aren't known for great stories anyway.

Gameplay consists of solving a HOG for an item which transports you to a specific period of time. Within these periods of time there's only 2 or 3 scenes, a few more HOGs, and at least one instructionless mini-game. There's about 8 or 9 of these time periods and they're easily solvable if you haven't slept in 3 days, as they only require about .45% of you brain's attention.  There's a good chance that a small child just randomly clicking the mouse around the screen could complete this game. And sometimes randomly clicking the mouse around the screen is the best way to solve the HOGs or minigames.

Overall, even if you're a huge HOG fan, stay away from this one unless you just want a simple game to add to your ""100%"" list.",1624845705,1624845705,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The graphics are absolutely terrible and your eyes will hurt after playing because of the low resolution of the hidden object scenes.

The story is laughable and repetitive, the ending is so bad it feels like a spit in the face after a very uncomfortable golden shower. The diaolgues and voice acting are pretty bad too.
The ""mini-games"" are maybe my biggest gripe with the games, always the same unoriginal and soul crushing stuff (I hope you like spot the differences), some are not even games : two of them literally require you to click the correct stuff multiple times in a row.

Non ci siamo. Questo Time Mysteries non ne azzecca una né dal punto di vista tecnico, né da quello artistico. Veramente terribile.

Everything about this game is done wrong, and done wrong in a way that is downright weird. I don't even know where to begin, but I'll just start by saying the way they animate people talking in this game is genuinely terrifying. I think actually make it look like the characters were talking was too hard or cost too much money or wasn't scary enough or something, so what they did instead is warp the entire character's head when they speak. The back of the head quivers and the forehead pulsates and all parts of the head are moving in different directions at once, and because of this it sort of looks like the mouth is moving. Think of any time you've seen someone talking. How much forehead pulsating did it involve? Your answer should be none, and the answer of any one who is a human and has seen other humans talk should be none. The way their faces move is so unsettling the only thing they should really be saying is ""help me there is a human soul trapped in here free me free meeeeeeee"". 

The voice acting is similarly weird. It is not just terrible, although it is terrible for sure. But there are weird stylistic choices that just baffle me. Here's a thing: I can't tell if one of the characters is a computer program or not. I don't mean that as a joke. He sounds like one of the text to speech programs you find online, and not a good one that can pass as human. I'm not sure if this is a person making themselves sound like this or if they just randomly picked one character to be voiced by some program they found online, but either way it is such a weird choice. Everyone else is human, I think, but are clearly not professional voice actors and might not even be people who routinely speak to other people. You could tell me the entire cast here lived in a cave their entire lives and had learned to speak two weeks before the game was made and I’d believe you. Everyone talks like they are reading a list of chemicals they’ve never heard of off the side of a bottle of shampoo and they emote like a calculator that was brought to life by a boring wizard. 

It is hard to get into the plot without ""ruining"" it (and I am using that sarcastically here because there is no way to ruin this plot) so I'll just try to summarize things and say it is really, really dumb. Our heroine is going home to visit her father, and she immediately knows something is up because she sees someone in the attic, a room that takes up roughly half the house and that her father had sealed up decades ago. Imagine if your father had sealed up an entire floor of your house and wouldn't let anyone go up there for decades. How unsurprised would you be when the FBI burst down your door and took away all your dad’s puppets made of human remains? But whatever, because she turns out to be right. Her father is missing and in the attic she finds a letter talking about her “inheritance” which is a set of  MAGICAL TIME TRAVELING weird rings. Yes, that’s right, folks, her father was a secret time traveler and has run into some sort of trouble with someone who wanted his magical rings capable of time traveling. Vivien soon finds a magic, talking crystal ball that wants to help her find her father. This happens within the first five minutes of the game, and it only gets dumber from there.

There are plots that are bad because no one tried and plots that are bad because the writers accidentally ate a bad piece of fish and are now hallucinating, and I have no idea what is the case here. It is an all-around, cataclysmically bad execution of the story that I have to believe it is some mix of both. Vivien reacts to discovering her father is a time traveling wizard in possession of a talking crystal ball with all the surprise of someone who found potato chips in their bag of potato chips. The game is always desperate to get back to the hidden object scenes so it feels like the plot is on an all out sprint at all times. Characters are introduced and disappear two lines later and it feels like someone watched a re-cap of the story a week ago on Youtube and is now desperately trying to recount what little they remember of the plot from memory. . Major events in this game are just sort of glossed over and you reach the point where plotholes become so significant that the plot is more holes than actual plot. It is a nonsensical mess of absolutely insanity, and it feels like the end result of hitting the writers on top of the head with a mallet until enough words fell out of their mouths to make a plot.

I would have forgiven all of this is the game was actually fun to play, but it isn't. The hidden object scenes are terrible, and a lot of them have this werid light pulsating in the background that makes things harder to see. Some scenes have objects in the background that are straight up blurry which I thought might be because this was an older game, but then scenes l found later in the game were perfectly clear so I don't know what is going on. Objects can be ill defined or vague, and sometimes they just tell you to find the wrong thing. They want you to find a ""pan flute"" but they write out ""flute"" and these are two totally different things. It would be like if they wanted you to find ""sand paper"" and just wrote out ""paper"". The other puzzles in the game aren't much better, and almost all of them will solve themselves almost immediately. The most ""difficult"" puzzle in the game is a sliding block puzzle that will likely take you less than a minute to finish. Everything is just so easy and basic and you can tell they were really struggling to come up with good puzzle ideas.

I hated this game, but I almost want to recommend it to you anyway because of how weird it is. It is such a bizarre package of failure that you almost need to see it for yourself. This is to video games what Sharknado is to film and what that crazy homeless guy in the park yelling random lines of Othello to pigeons is to theater, and it so strange and so bad you feel this urge to show it to other people so they can celebrate its terribleness with you. This game is so bad its terrible and so bad its good at the same time, and I cannot stress how much you should avoid it and also somehow play it yourself at the same time.",1593639110,1593639110,False,2,1,0.494435876607894897,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Les époques traversées par Vivien ne servent en fait que de prétexte à une succession de SOC que j'ai trouvé très brouillon par le fait qu'ils mettent des objets sans vraiment de réalisme (Il n'est pas rare de voir un objet suspendu dans les airs ou ne pas être de la taille correspondante aux objets l'entourant...) car Inherance ne possède que très peu de puzzles, 

Sorti en 2010 et remastérisé par Artifex en 2014, Inheritance a pris un ""coup de vieux"" et le Temps ne fait pas de cadeau.
Il devient vraiment difficile de distinguer les objets et il n'est pas rare de chercher ceux-ci faute à une résolution trop basse pour nos grand écrans...
On peut remercier d'ailleurs les développeurs d'avoir intégré un ""sonar"" qui vous montre l'ombre chinoise de l'objet de la liste afin de mieux le trouver dans le décor.

A la problématique du dessus, il faut rajouter à cela un choix plus que douteux de mettre un effet de surbrillance en mode alternatif qui a tendance à fatiguer la vue voire à donner un sérieux mal de crane (j'ai testé ^^)

L'animation n'est plus au niveau des standards et on a un peu de mal avec ces personnages dont la tête bouge ""bizarrement"" pour simuler le fait de parler...

- für Artifex-Mundi-Standards etwas steife Grafik/Texturen/Animationen, aber durchaus ansprechend
- keine sehr originelle Story rund um das Thema ""Zeitreisen""
- Die einzelnen Stops in den Jahrhunderten haben dagegen durchaus seinen Reiz
- Das Overlay fällt etwas ab zu anderen AM-Spielen. Das Minispiele selten erklärt werden und man erst auf die Hilfe klicken muss, ist etwas unschön. Auch die nur 2 vorhandenen Schwierigkeitsgrade sind wenig, denn auf Leicht will man es ja nicht spielen. Da sind die AM-Spiele mit 3, in denen man immer gemütlich Mitte nehmen kann, schon besser. Außerdem gab es keine fortgeschrittenen Aufdeckspiele oder Kombinationsfunde im Wimmelbild. 
- Gerade die Wimmelbildspiele sind in diesem Game besonders nervig und wirklich nichts für Epileptiker. Die ständige Lichtstreuung zwischen Hell und Dunkel ist sehr, sehr schlimm. 
- Der Schwierigkeitsgrad auf schwer ist etwas happig, aber ich bin mit 1x Hilfe in den Minispielen und 2x in den Wimmelbildern ausgekommen. 
- Spielzeit betrug ca. 3.5 Stunden

Also, I have to mention the Squidgy Squoodgy head and faces thing.  They had some difficulties with their animation of people talking (the voice acting's pretty good though).

Хотелось бы, чтобы был средний вариант, потому что я не хочу оценивать ее, но на самом деле я тоже не хочу ее ставить ей отрицательный отзыв. Я нашел эту игру слишком простой. Графика в некоторых сценах со скрытыми объектами была немного лучше. Я действительно должен был сделать несколько случайных нажатий, чтобы найти несколько вещей, не потому, что они были хорошо спрятаны, а потому, что я их вообще не видел. Они были пикселированы и отошли на задний план. Я пробежал игру дважды за эти 4,9 часа из любопытства, и я могу сказать вам, даже во второй раз, зная, где находятся эти объекты, я должен был случайно щелкнуть в общей области.

Определенно не одна из лучших игр Artifex Mundi. Слишком упрощенная и простая. Я ожидал более высокого качества графики для сцен со скрытыми объектами в обновленной версии. Это было просто лениво.

Отличная игра для детей, так как это не страшно в любом случае. Многие игры Artifex Mundi не подходят для детей. Не так хорошо для взрослых.  5/10

Definitely not one of the best Artifex Mundi games. Too simplistic and repetitive. I would expect higher graphics quality for the hidden object scenes in a remastered version. That was just lazy.

Time Mysteries: Inheritance to typowa dla Artifex Mundi gra, w której poruszając się między poszczególnymi planszami, szukamy ukrytych przedmiotów,  oraz rozwiązujemy zagadki, aby poznać dalsze tajemnice fabuły. W jakiej jakości zostało to wykonane opisze poniżej.

Jak widać gra daje się przejść bardzo szybko, mi to zajęło 5 godzin, z przerwami na robienie herbaty, itp. Ze względu na to, że zdecydowałem się dać jej negatywną opinię, najpierw opiszę pozytywy tej gry, a zakończę tym co mi się nie podobało.

[b] [u] Plusy: [/u][/b]

[b]* Muzyka -[/b] jest to chyba jedyny poważny plus tej gry. W grze fabuła opiera się wokół podróżowania między różnymi historycznymi epokami z przeszłości. Dla każdej epoki mamy inną muzykę odpowiadającą mniej więcej czasom z któryh pochodzi. Muzyka jest relaksująca i może się podobać.
* Na siłę - [b]Prostota gry -[/b] dla jednych to będzie wada, dla innych zaleta. Mógłbym napisać, że można polecić ten tytuł osobom, które chciałyby zagrać pierwszy raz w grę tego typu, bo można ją przejść łatwo i bezproblemowo. Jednak tak nie napiszę, bo tego tytułu nie poleciłbym nikomu.

[b] [u]I tutaj przejdę do minusów. [/u][/b] Nie wiem od czego zacząć, bo ta gra to praktycznie jeden wielki minus, ale zacznijmy od najważniejszego:

[b]* Fabuła -[/b] W tej grze coś takiego właściwie nie istnieje. Fabuła jest tak głupia, naciągana, bezsensowna, a zakończenie gry jeszcze głupsze i bez ironii powiem, że głupszego jeszcze nie widziałem. Myślę, że gdyby rozpisać w klasach 1-3 szkoły podstawowej konkurs na historyjkę do gry to dzieci wymyśliłyby coś ciekawszego i z większym sensem. WTF?? - tak czujemy się na koniec gry. 

[b]* Zagadki i ukryte przedmioty - [/b]Skoro fabuła to żart to przynajmniej to co powinno być sercem tej gry powinno trzymać poziom. Jednak i tutaj się srogo zawiedziecie. Sceny z ukrytymi przedmiotami są nudne, nie wiem co odpowiada za ten efekt graficzny, ale często przedmioty, które mamy odnaleźć wyróżniają się na tle, mają inny odcień, coś jak na starych kreskówkach, gdzie tło było ciemne, a animowane postacie jaśniejsze. Co to ma być? O zagadkach lepiej zaś nic nie mówić, bo są tak proste, a do tego jakby autorzy nie mieli pomysłów to się powtarzają. Beznadzieja.

[b]* Grafika - [/b]Jest to niby wersja remastered, czyli powinna być poprawiona. Jednak grafika wygląda jak z połowy lat 90. XX wieku. Animacje postaci, tzn ich twarzy kiedy coś mówią, są tak okropne i paskudne, że aż się patrzeć na to nie chce. Reszta także nie lepsza. Tła i miejscówki są brzydkie, postacie są brzydkie, ogólnie ta gra jest brzydka. 

Brak w tej grze jakichś interakcji, brak większej ilości lokacji, bo w zasadzie każdy etap gry to jedynie dwie lokacje pomiędzy którymi przechodzimy. Do tego etap w tym mauzoleum, który musimy przejść kilka razy za każdym razem jest identyczny. NUDA! tak, ta gra jest po prostu nudna, nie mamy żadnej motywacji do odkrywania co jest dalej, bo fabuła jest nudna jak cała ta gra.

The game is highly repetitive. There's a series of hidden object puzzles for a given era that you must solve to solve a normal puzzle/minigame. Then, you go back to a time travel hub, have to do a ""spot the differences"" game, do a hidden object puzzle to earn the items to go to the next era. Rinse, repeat.

Various things make this game's hidden object puzzles especially frustrating: a low resolution, muddy graphics, items that are 90% obscured by other objects (one object was partially off-screen and especially difficult to see). Many items are frankly too small to see, and blend into other objects too much.

The spot the difference games are particularly annoying because of the above issues and because many of the differences are frankly too hard to spot.

I know there's a thin line between challenging and unfair, but this game's hidden object puzzles and difference spotting minigames are on the unfair side.

The graphics are not consistant and it makes the HOS sometimes hard to actually see things to find them.  Sometimes your looking at painting to find objects, sometimes it's a room that repeats or it's another scene but I found the graphics just not as pleasant to look at as some other AM games have.

The characters are done in a very weird way.  They are static characters but seems to have some kind of overlay of movement that makes their heads and mouths move wierdly and bodies wave around to fien movement.   Half the time it looks like they have had terrible dental work done and their jaws are unhinged when they talk. 

There is barely anything to find or figure out to do in each scene, mini game/puzzles are minimal and sometimes it's a repeat of the same type of puzzle.    One of the character's voices is terrible as this VA simply sounds like he was bored even trying to have a character's personality and he sounds robotic as if he's simply reading the words on the script page.

The other two character voices are ok.  At least they have some kind of expression in their voices. 

I like AM's Hidden Object games and disappointed they aren't making any new ones anymore however this one is one of my least favorites.   It may be this game was one of their first and there for a bit unpolished but I have played older HOGs with even not that polished graphics that I have enjoyed more and this one just seems a bit to thrown together without a lot of thought into it.

This game came out in 2010 so for this genre of game it's considered a bit dated so I'm willing to say it's for that reason it's this way.

If this is included in a bundle I'd say fine get it.  If it's super sale time and you want all three in the series I'd say get it.  
I have the other 2 in the series and plan to play them and given that they were probably out different years I may find they have progressed.  We shall see.

Time Mysteries: Inheritance gehört meiner Meinung allerdings zu den eher schwächeren Spielen, das sich vor allem durch seine Übersetzungsschwächen und teilweise langweiligen Szenenbilder auszeichnet. Trotz der Kritik, die im Folgenden noch etwas genauer dargelegt wird, macht das Rätseln und Suchen von Objekten trotzdem wieder Spaß. Wer erfahren genug ist, auch Objekte zu finden, die falsch übersetzt sind, wird auch an diesem Spiel seinen Spaß finden. Wen so etwas nervt und in Rage bringt, sollte seinen Blick vielleicht lieber auf ein anderes Wimmelbildspiel aus dem Hause Artifex Mundi werfen.

Die Story, die bei vielen Wimmelbildspielen stark in den Hintergrund tritt, zeigt gute Ideen und Ansätze, verliert sich aber schnell in einem Aneinanderreihen von sinnlos verknüpften Zeitreisen. Das Verfolgen eines anderen Zeitreisenden wird viel zu selten in den Blick genommen. So sieht man diesen zwar zwischendurch, findet auch mal den ein oder anderen Gegenstand des ""Widersachers"", aber im Großen und Ganzen ist er immer ""gerade eben vorbei gekommen und hat das gleiche gesucht wie ich"". Interaktion mit diesem findet bis zum letzten Kapitel überhaupt nicht statt. 

Die verschiedenen Szenen, welche die einzelnen Zeitepochen widerspiegeln sollen, sind teilweise lustlos und völlig stereotypisch aufgebaut. Ein Jahrhundert ist in 3-4 Minuten erledigt, im nächsten hängt man ewig herum, weil das Zu-Suchende völlig unersichtlich in der Szenerie eingebaut wurde. So wird beispielsweise das Mittelalter sofort zum Ritterturnier und die Frühe Neuzeit in ein Kloster versetzt. Zwischen den einzelnen Epochen befindet man sich immer wieder in der Gegenwart, in der man jedes(!) Mal, das gleiche Wimmelbild vorgesetzt bekommt, aus dem man auch immer wieder die gleichen Gegenstände suchen muss. Allerdings wird die Szenerie immer wieder neu ""gefüllt"" und somit sind die Gegenstände an anderen Orten platziert. Dennoch ist das gleiche Bild spätestens beim dritten oder vierten Mal nicht mehr schön. Zumal die Lichteffekte, die eingebaut wurden, ein genaues Hinsehen so demaßen stören, dass ich teilweise Pausen machen musste, weil meine Augen einfach nicht mehr in die teilweise überbelichteten Stellen schauen konnten.

Ein letzter Kritikpunkt wäre die Auswahl der Objekte, die zu finden sind. Übersetzungefehler, die aus einer Taschenuhr eine Armbanduhr oder aus einem einfachen Fächer einen Ventilator machen, führen immer wieder zu Schwierigkeiten. Leichter wird das Ganze allerdings dadurch, dass in nahezu jeder Szene eine Lupe, ein Paar Handschuhe oder auch ein Paar Schuhe gesucht werden muss.

La storia è carina e interessante, anche se a tratti sembra quasi che corra troppo veloce e alcuni dettagli vengono tralasciati. Per il resto, l'avventura di Vivien Ambrose dovrebbe risultare abbastanza godibile.

Le schermate Hidden Objects non hanno nulla di particolare. Semplicemente c'è una lista di oggetti da scovare, niente di più. I vari enigmi invece sono stati carini, ma (per quanto mi riguarda) troppo semplici, sarà perchè ormai sono abituato a questo genere di giochi.

Tecnicamente invece il gioco lascia un po' a desiderare. Innanzitutto è (o meglio, dovrebbe essere) una remastered edition, invece si ha lo stesso la sensazione di un gioco vecchiotto. La risoluzione è pessima, a volte è persino difficile trovare certi oggetti perchè troppo sgranati o sfocati. Le aree di gioco sono completamente piatte, con pochissime animazioni.
Lo stile del disegno invece non è male, anzi.

Per quanto riguarda il sonoro non siamo certamente al top, ma è accettabile. Il doppiaggio è solo inglese. Le musiche adatte all'atmosfera. Buoni anche gli effetti sonori.

Ho riscontrato qualche errore di traduzione o imprecisioni negli oggetti (es: Brush = spazzola/pennello).

In definitiva: Per circa 3-4 ore di gioco, la bassa qualità (ricordo che si tratta di una remastered) e qualche errorino qua e là, forse non vale la pena spendere il prezzo pieno. In bundle o in sconto è comunque da acquistare se si ama il genere. Ricordo inoltre che è il primo capitolo di una trilogia.",1505975366,1505975366,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

From here, you embark on a journey through different centuries. In every era a ring has to be retrieved, which (in combination with items) unlocks a door to the next era.

Hidden object scenes are plentiful and come in a rather consecutive order. Maybe better would've been if they alternate a bit more between HO-scenes and puzzles. The fewer puzzles that you'll encounter are fun and not too hard. The mini-game that one can choose instead of the HO-scene, a match 4 game, is tedious and frustrating though. I'd recommend sticking with the HO-scenes instead.

Between each era there's also a game where you have to find 7 differences between 2 appearingly similar pictures.

The music is typical for every era and adds to the feel and atmosphere of your experience. Narratives, the protagonist & other characters with a British accent, give a Doctor Who feel to the game. Character animations are rather comical than realistic, though.

To conclude: Bearing in mind that this game is a remastered version of one of the first games from Artifex Mundi, the game delivers what it should and i enjoyed both my 2 playthroughs to achieve a perfect game. (It can be perfected in one playthrough, but i accidently clicked the hint button in an HO-scene, so i had to go through all again.) It's the first in a trilogy and i'm looking forward to play the next ones. 
Recommended for HO lovers and/or Artifex Mundi games players.

Animations are especially appalling: when every character starts talking, their heads start morphing, inflating and deflating, and mutating in such a way you’d think a flesh eating alien would burst out of their skulls!

Music is extremely bland and forgettable, while the sound effects, especially dialogues, are garbled on such a heavy compression, that you’ll hear nasty scratching every time any character speaks.

Elle va réaliser la particularité de sa famille et sera accompagnée dans ses aventures par un orbe de cristal qui parle.

Le jeu dure pas plus de 4h et chaque niveau est assez vite car il n'y a qu'une seule énigme à résoudre à chaque fois pour pouvoir obtenir chaque bague.

- Storia: 5/10
Vivien Ambrose una dottoressa in fisica raggiunge il padre a casa sua per festeggiare un importante risulatato scientifico da lei conseguito ma al suo arrivo scopre che il padre è stato rapito. Una sfera di scristallo parlante e la ricerca di 7 anelli faranno ritrovare il padre scomparso tra viaggi nel tempo e magia? Lo scoprirete risolvendo il mistero che avvolge la famiglia Ambrose da secoli, cosa che apparentemente solo la figlia Vivien sembra ancora non conoscere. La storia non è niente di speciale ma chiaramente fa da sfondo agli enigmi e agli Hidden Objects riuscendo a dare quel poco interesse necessario per proseguire.

- Gameplay: 4/10
Il gameplay è quello classico degli Hidden Objects. Classici e veramente banali pure gli enigmi. Non raggiunge la sufficienza troppe volte si chiude la palpebra. Noia...

- Grafica e Animazioni: 4/10
La grafica degli scenari disegnati a mano non è particolarmente bella e molto lontano dalla sufficienza. Deve essere una versione remastered e invece purtoppo non lo è, la risoluzione troppo bassa spesso porta a non scovare gli oggetti da trovare per via della scarsa qualità dei disegni. Insufficienza anche alle animazioni, soprattutto i personaggi (bruttissimi) e pure l'ambiente circostante (completamente statico). Fluido il motore grafico mai avuto artefatti, bugs o rallentamenti.

- Sound: 5/10
Le musiche sono orecchiabili e adatte all'atmosfera. Anonime e senza carattere le voci dei personaggi tra cui, confermo con le altre recensioni, pessima quella di Vivien . Gli effetti sonori sono buoni.

- Prezzo: 5/10
Ad oggi 03/08/2017 il gioco a prezzo pieno costa 7,99 euro, io lo comprerei al 75% di sconto. Questo per me è il suo valore effettivo. Io l'ho trovato in un bundle assieme ad altri giochi e quindi pagato decisamente meno.

--------------------------------------------

This is a very traditional hidden object game. You will stumble across various scenes with smaller riddles to solve and quite some hidden object scenes to complete. The voice acting is not the best and other games of the series have had better voice acting. I advise you to turn them off. The music is ok though. 

All in all I can clearly recommend this game if it's for sale. I would not spend over $5 for the game as there are better hidden object games out there and this one is quite short( I only came up to 6 hours playtime by having it on idle). Still it is not a complete failure and entertaining at times.

En cuanto a las ""cinemáticas"" decir que son de las peores de entre los HOG, quedan bastante mal los gestos faciales ya que se llevan a cabo a base de deformaciones de la imagen.

Por tanto, lo debo poner entre los peores juegos del género de los que he probado, sobre todo por el guión, el desarrollo de las localizaciones y el diseño de puzzles (las escenas de objetos ocultos sí están correctas y no encontré problemas de traducción que te dificulten la búsqueda).

Como punto a favor decir que es de los pocos juegos de Artifex Mundi que no te obligan a jugarlo dos veces para conseguir todos los logros. En la primera partida y de forma fácil se hace el 100%.

A Kinetic mystery novel and a hidden object puzzler, with other puzzle elements thrown in. Now me, I am one of those people who have trouble finding their keys to the house or car, let alone finding objects in a puzzle. But Time Mystery was an absolute fun game to play. 

The story is about Vivian Ambrose, who comes home after a night on the town, after winning a science award (Hottest Nerd Chick of 2013), to find her father missing.  She starts to regret the ten margaritas she had when she is shocked to find a talking orb, which tells her a strange time traveller has kidnapped her father. She now rethinks her life of hard drugs to be a bad thing, when she is told by the talking ball, that she must now travel through time and collect special rings to free her father.

Game Play
First up you look around rooms to find areas of interest, like finding hidden safes or closed draws ect. Some of these will have marble or memory puzzles, but most of the time the puzzle will be a hidden item pictures.

As with most hidden items games you get a list of items to find. There is no timers so you can go at your own leisure or if you find the hidden item a bit frustrating you can hit the old HINT button to which Tinker Bell flies to the item and yells “LOSER!”. If you want a change you can flip the mini-game to a ball drop puzzler similar to something like Bejewelled or Bubble Trouble. And if all else fails you can skip certain puzzles (Run you coward!).

As you solve each time line, without being hunted by time cops or grammar Nazis, you receive a ring to take back to your time machine, then you go on to the next area in history.

Inner Workings
Game graphics is a nicely done comic style, but Artifex Mundi has cheated a bit, by using picture warping to make people look like they are talking or moving. It works sometimes and other times it just looks weird, especially when Vivian smiles, which looks like she is snarling and about to rip someone’s throat out.

Voice acting is sub-par and at times destroys the atmosphere of the game created by the music, which is done well and keeps to the time period that you visit.

The story plot is not going to win any Hemingway Award but it flows nicely and keeps you hooked.

There is two game modes Regular and Expert.  Regular Mode your hint and skip meter/bar fill up fast, areas of interest are indicated with fairy dust and there is no penalty for extra clicking in the hidden object scenes.  With Expert mode the hint and skip fill slowly, there is no area of interest indication (no Fairy dust), and you are penalised for extra clicks in hidden object areas.

Time Mystery:- Inheritance is a surprisingly good game, I enjoyed playing it through to the end, which I did in a solid 3 hrs on regular mode. After the first time through, there may not be much replay value. Now, I wish there was a Hint button so I can find these damn car keys!

The adventure game elements just aren't working yet in this game. The game is broken into several distinct parts, so the adventure game puzzles can never get past basic complexity. This is probably for the best, because the game often had trouble communicating the current goal. Either the instructions were so vague that I could only just step through the active elements, or the objectives would give me information about things I had not yet found when I found part of a solution to a problem I hadn't encountered yet.

Mais ce qui plombe le jeu pour ma part, c'est les enchainements entre les scènes d'objets cachés et les puzzles : ils sont inexistants. Aucune liaisons, aucune explications... on est baladés sans vraiment savoir où on va.

Pro:
+Time traveling

-Characters design
-Ball reminds me of 80's sci-fi TV shows

I recommend it if you just want to chill and enjoy a hidden object game without comparing it with other 'new' ones.

Almost everything about this game is wrong.

I have really hard times to find something so that I could recommend this game but nothing really stands out against mentioned above. Get it only if you are hardcore AM fan and want to complete or own every single game from them or if you are perfect-games hunter (there is only few achievements which are not hard to get).

Единственный минус, с коротым я смириться не могу, так это графика в поиске предметов. Картинка то слишком замыленная, то слишком ужасна по шкале тех самых шакалов. Зачастую искомые предметы на таком роде фона видны невооруженным глазом, что даже и в список смотреть не нужно.

Des scènes d'Objets Cachés, quelques puzzles (dont un qui m'a demandé pas mal de temps et finallement de la chance), des 7 différences, du Master Mind... on est dans le classique. Le scénario est simpliste mais fait son travail en servant de transition aux enchainements de tableaux.

On y retrouve les éceuils classiques de traduction lors des phases d'OC (mais au final moins que d'habitude il me semble). Les graphismes sont corrects pour ce genre de production et les animations des personnages ressemblent parfois à des déformations. J'ai même trouvé les tableaux plus agréables car assez lisibles (il y a un effet de lumière gênant sur certains d'entres eux), bon... parfois il faut bien chercher quand même.

Le jeu me semble faisable entre 2 et 3 heures.

A noter qu'il manque parfois un peu de consignes mais globalement il n'est pas difficile de comprendre ce qu'il faut faire.

This is a Point and click hidden object game.



[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]

You can have different profile slots.
There is a music volume slidebar.
There is a sound volume slidebar.
Able to toggle the voice over.
There is normal and expert mode.


[h1]About the game.[/h1]

You are trying to find out the mystery of your own family and you will enter and travel from era to era. You have to collect rings in order to move to the next era. You are able to play a different minigame when you are doing the hidden object. This minigame is 10 faster and easier to complete then doing the hidden object. Each time you have filled up the bar, you get a question mark and if you pop that. You will cross off 1 random hidden object. It's sort of ruining the purpose of the hidden object.

Alternative way to beat hidden objects.
There is a hint system.
There is voice over and it sounds a bit ""stale"" (without an expression).
The subtitles are voiced over.
Has puzzles.
Lot of collectables.
Weak guide lines.
There is video animation/cutscene.
There is only a map available if you have unlocked the time machine thing.
Sometimes during the hidden object scene. The objects are BEHIND every decoration. Which makes it impossible to see with the bare eyes.

[h1]Other things.[/h1]

It's an okay game but the ""toggle minigame"" at hidden objects really ruins the game. So i can;t give it a high number.

But i do have enjoyed the era switches

그림체와 색상이 뭉개진 느낌입니다.
따라서 숨은, 다른 그림찾기 할때 그림을 알아보기도 힘들고 뿌연 시각효과까지 더해집니다.
찾아야 할 물품의 형태를 그림자로 보여주는 기능이 있습니다만 별 도움은 되지 않았습니다. 

정말 눈이 많이 아프더군요.
물론 미니게임과 스킵 기능은 존재합니다.

또 다른 문제는 한글 번역에 있습니다.

우선 띄어쓰기가 전혀 안되어 있는 문장이 많아서 가독성에 문제가 있고, 
반말했다, 존대했다 어투가 뒤죽박중이다보니 대화에 집중이 잘 안되더군요.

마지막으로 스토리의 단조로움입니다.
그림 레전드 시리즈처럼 진부하지만 감동이 있고 흥미가 생기는 이야기가 아닙니다.

그림 시리즈는 얘기에 빠져 순식간에 엔딩까지 플레이 하게 되지만
이 게임은  얼마나 더 남은거야 하는 생각을 하며 중단하는 경우가 많았습니다.
3시간정도 플레이 한 것 같은데 한 30분 하다 중단하는 식으로 며칠에 걸쳐 3시간이 걸렸습니다.

The characters are ok, the bg are blurry, the music I liked a lot, and the VA was ok. I really wish that they left the faces alone. When ever the characters talk there faces become extremely wavy like there heads are about to explode LOL.  

The reason why I'm giving this a positive review is because I didn't have high hopes for the story. My expectations where low. I read the reviews before starting the game and I do agree that the story was weak. The story if polished could of been soooo much better. The ending could of been much better.

Honestly the only thing that really borthered me about this HOG is the amount of blurriness in this game is just too much. Due to this lots of the HOG items are hard to find. U do have a sonar and without that sonar finding some of the HOG items could of been even more painful. It's too bad because if the game wasn't so blurry the game would of been beautiful. I have never used a guide so much before for HOG scenes. The reason for this is because I wanted to get the achievements and had to use the BigfishGames guide due to the blurriness being bad:( Yeah even the game being remastered wasn't good LOL.

One other weird thing is that for some reason the puzzles do not have instructions so u either guess what u do or consult a guide. In this case BigfishGames saved me again for the puzzles. Some puzzles I didn't undertand what I had to do. On their site they have pictures of the puzzles with the instructions on them. But be warned doing that will of course spoil how to complete the puzzle.

This HOG had no map. The thing is that the way the game was done that no map was really needed.

This HOG also has no bonus features.

I did read that this is Artifex's first game and wow does it show. I read this HOG was made on 2010 not too long ago. It's amazing how far Artifex has come along over the years. 

I got this HOG for I believe about $1.50-$2.00. I highly recommend getting this HOG for the price range I listed. This HOG was ok.

The Average:

The game follows the same ‘formula’. Complete a level, then complete a mini game where you have to find the differences between two photos and then do it all over again.  Each level consists of two areas and a few hidden object and mini games. 

The Bad:

- The hidden object games are too hard, many items are practically blended into the background forcing you to click everywhere at random. 

- Mini games are not explained very well

- Voice acting is awful 

Conclusion:

Artifex Mundi makes some great hidden object games, sadly this isn’t one of them.

As far as the game itself, it's pretty simple to breakdown.

PROS:
+ Nice Atmosphere
+ Beautiful Soundtrack
+ Hidden objects are well hidden

CONS:
- Lacking variety in artwork environments
- Some hidden objects are a bit TOO well hidden

IN BETWEENS:
= Story is OK but not thrilling
= Voice acting is decent but the main antagonist sounds like a robot
   (not sure if this is intentional or not)
= Some artwork towards the end is very pixelated compared to the rest of the game

OVERALL:

It's a decent little adventure not without flaws. I could have surely completed it sooner than 7 hours but again this was my first venture into this genre. I enjoyed getting my feet wet but I get the feeling I'll see why it's not as praised as other games in the genre(and by Artifex Mundi in particular) soon enough.

[게임 스토리]
: 시간여행을 통해 납치된 아버지의 단서를 찾아라


[한줄 평]
: 리마스터링 작품임에도 불구하고 게임 스토리 누가? 잘라 먹었어 --^? 범인 누구야 당장나와~ --^


[게임 소개]
: 이 게임의 전반적인 게임 스토리 설명 하자면, 주인공은 최근에 이룬 과학적인 업적을 아버지와 같이 축하하기 위해 집으로 가게 됩니다. 하지만 집에 도착 했을때 어디에서도 아버지를 찾을 수 없었으며, 집에서 발견된 낯선 편지를 통해 가문의 유산인 신비한 물건을 통해 시간을 여행할 수 있다는 새로운 사실과 아버지가 시간여행자에게 납치되었다는 사실들을 알게됩니다. 그리고 당연히 주인공은 아버지를 찾기 위해 시간여행길에 오르게 되며 이 게임은 시작됩니다.

 시간여행이라는 설정으로 다양한 과거의 장소를 탐험하며 납치된 아버지의 흔적을 찾아 가는 스토리라인은 매우 흥미롭다고 생각합니다. 이 설정으로 퍼즐들도 주인공이 여행한 시간때의 물건들 중에서 찾게 되며 시간여행 장소에 따라 분위기도 나름 변하기 때문에 일반적인 히든 오브젝트 작품보다는 질린다는 느낌이 덜하다는 생각이 듭니다.

 필자는 처음 게임을 시작하기전 스팀게임 평가란(복합적)을 보고 실제 게임을 플레이 하면서 시간여행이라는 흥미로운 주제와 아버지를 찾기 위한 흔적들을 찾기 위해 다양한 시간으로 여행하면서 게임의 분위기도 변해가는 부분을 보면서 왜? 평가가 좋지 못했을까? 하는 의문이 많이 들었습니다만... 본 작품을 클리어 하고나니 그때서야 평가가 안좋은 이유를 알게되었습니다.

 그 이유를 설명하자면 히든오브젝트의 고질적인 문제점인 잘못된 단어들과 왈도체를 제외하더라고 스토리 중간 부분과 클라이막스 부분에서 스토리가 짤리는 현상이 발생된다는 큰 문제점이 있습니다. 처음엔 필자의 PC 상태를 의심했으나 2회차를 플레이 하면서 동일한 현상이 재발생되면서 PC의 문제가 아닌 본 작품의 문제라는 것을 인지하였으며 리마스터링 된 작품에서 스토리 부분이 짤리는 현상이 발생된다는 점에서 한순간 어이가 없었습니다.

 흥미로운 주제로 한참 해당 세계관에 빠져든 상태에서 스토리의 중간 부분과 엔딩 클라이막스에서 끊김(검은화면) 현상이 발생되니 수많은 짜증이 유발되더군요(무엇보다 엔딩을 알수가 없네요....ㅜㅜ)

 그나마 다행인 점은 본 작품이후 2~3편은 스토리가 연관되지 않았다는 점에서 그나마 위안을 삼고 싶습니다.
 (참고사항: 3편은 한글이 지원되나 한국 지역제한입니다...)


[게임의 장/단점]
1. 장점
- 한글화
- 시간여행이라는 흥미로운 스토리 요소


2. 단점
- 중간 및 엔딩부분의 스토리가 짤리는 현상 발생
  (검은 화면 이후 다음 스토리로 넘어감...엔딩 부분에서는 엔딩 크레딧이 나옴..;;;)

Unsatisfying and creepy. Decent enough to get on the cheap (<$5).

A lot of little things bugged me. Nothing game-breaking.
*some voice overs got cut off.
*mystery guy sounds like a robot.
*inconsistent/eroneous object clues.
*many differences to spot are too subtle
*weird pulsing of light in HO sections is very annoying.
*I appreciate the sonar. However, showing objects as they appear behind other objects usually ends up more as a hinderance.
*vague plot point at the end is never elaborated on.

What really made it creepy for me is the weird photomanipulations in the cutscenes. It would have been enough to make the lips move but trying to make 2D images move like 3D was a mistake in my opinion. The sad part is that all that effort was probably an aspect of the ""remastering"".

Estas ideas hubieran conseguido que el argumento no fuera tan absurdo. En fin... En su periplo, tiene que salvar a su padre, un científico guay que ha encontrado la receta del salmorejo perfecto, y hay una conspiración global para arrebatárselo.

El aspecto técnico, pues eso, imágenes estáticas aceptables y ya. Lo normal en estos juegos. Lo que sí da pena, y mucha, es las caras de idiotas que tienen los personajes cuando parlotean. Las bocas se mueven como si se usara la herramienta ""Licuar"" del Photoshop sobre ellas.

한마디로 이 게임은 숨은그림의, 숨은그림에 의한, 숨은그림을 위한 게임이다.
그 정도로 타 히든 오브젝트 게임보다는 많이 등장한다는 말이다.
이 게임내의 미니게임들 수를 정리하자면,

숨은그림찾기 31개
미니게임 28개 (이 중 틀린그림찾기가 6개)

타 히든 오브젝트 게임의 숨은그림찾기가 20내외인데 비해서 이 게임은 31개로 월등히 많은 편이다.
게임의 주인공이 시간여행을 하는데 새로운 장소에 등장하자마자 숨은그림찾기가 나오는가 하면,
숨은그림찾기를 하나 끝내고 나면 연속해서 또 다른 숨은그림찾기가 있을 정도이다.

숨은그림찾기가 많다고해서 딱 이 게임이 나쁜편은 아니라고 생각한다.
Artifex Mundi사의 초창기 게임으로선 그래픽도 괜찮은 편이고
무엇보다 중세로 가면 RPG게임 워쳐3의 마을을 연상시키는 장면도 나온다.
배경음악도 좋은 편이라고 생각한다.

다만, 초창기 게임이다보니 캐릭터가 대화할때 입의 움직임은 조금 어색하다.
본인의 생각으로는 숨은그림찾기가 많이 나오긴 하지만 미니게임들은 준수한 편이다고 생각하고
특히나 다른 히든 오브젝트게임과는 다르게 틀린그림찾기가 있으니 이건 이 게임의 특징이라고 할수 있다.

그리고 아쉬운 점은 한글 띄어쓰기인데, 한글화는 고마운 일이지만 띄어쓰기가 안되어있으므로 이 점을 생각하고 게임하는게 좋을거같다. 완벽한 한글화면 정말 좋겠지만 여러가지 사정으로 한글화가 안되어서 나오는 게임들이 태반인데 이 게임은 그나마 한글화된 점만으로 고마운 일이니까 이 점에 대해서는 너무 비난할 일은 아니라고 생각한다.

게임시간 3시간 분량으로서, 도전과제도 1회차에 모두 완료가능하다.
스팀내의 유저 평가가 대체적으로 맞다고 생각하지만 이 게임만큼은 아니라고 생각한다.
막상해보면 나쁘지 않은 수준이고 평균이상은 하는 게임이다.
스팀에 있는 유저 평가가 대체적으로 맞긴하지만 100% 맞는건 아니다.
개인의 취향 따라 평이 달라질수도 있고,
다수결로 했을때 다수가 꼭 맞다는 보장은 없으니까 이 점을 염두해두고 게임을 해보자!!!

I do give it a recommend with the caveat that it doesn't work as a standalone game. Without the other games in the trilogy to tie up the loose ends in the story, it falls flat on its face. However, if you're a completionist like me who likes that sort of complexity, and you're a fan of Artifex Mundi's other works, the trilogy is worth a playthrough.

In terms of gameplay and mechanics you can see the bones of Artifex Mundi's success, but it's definitely lacking polish and can lead to frustration particularly if you're not familiar with how their games work.

After throughly enjoying Dark Arcana: Carnival, I've installed this game because - time travel. There are certain topics that excite me, and time traveling (alongside multiple universes) is one of them.

What I've encountered is a game that easily falls in the category of one of my worst gaming experiences. By the end of second hour, I've decided I don't want to risk my sight and sanity and I've finished the game by using hint system, randomly clicking and skipping minigames.

Mechanically, it is typical Artifex Mundi game where you need to find hidden objects and solve easy-as-pie puzzles while playing minigames. You can skip minigames if you find 'em hard (or awful to look at, if you're like me) and you can play Match-3 type of game instead of finding hidden objects. If you've ever laid your hands on any of Artifex Mundi games, you know the drill.

However, this game fails horribly at any other aspect. The story is lazy excuse of a plot. I am a huge fan of b-movies, but this thing really doen't even cut it as cute and/or funny. Characters are horrible, plot holes are HUGE (with some plot lost in their darkness) and game simply don't make you care about anything story-wise. I am not expecting H.G.Wells nor Arthur C. Clarke here, but hey, a decent writer could be hired (wink, wink, hint system is on).

The remastered version of the game is horrid. Sounds, occassional music clips and voices can pass if you're really ignorant. Even crappy animation can stand tall compared to complete and utterly disastrous HOG scenes. Scenes are blurry, low resolution. Colors are confusing. Some scenes hidden objects are in obvious contrast so you can easily click your way through the scene without even trying to read what you are looking for. Believe me, I don't even want to know what original game looked like if this is REMASTERED version.

To sum it all up, this is lame excuse for HOG and you shouldn't play nor buy it. Take good care of your three hours you could easily waste and never get back in case you decide to ignore my warning.

Das die erzählten Geschichten nicht der Kracher sind, ist in diesem Genre fast zu erwarten.

Die Vertonung war schlicht zum Weglaufen und ich habe sie nach einer Viertelstunde zusammen mit der Musik abgedreht und stattdessen nebenbei Videos laufen lassen. Eigentlich hätte man die ganzen Cutscenes direkt skippen können, man verpasst nichts.

Die Qualität der Szenen ist auch nicht besonders gut, in einer konnte man zum Bleispiel die gesuchten Objekte einfach daran erkennen, dass ihre Auflösung deutlich höher war, als die des Hintergrunds.

Wir sind Vivien Ambrose, eine junge Physikerin, der dummerweise der Vater entführt wurde. Um ihn aufzuspüren bedarf es der Hilfe einer Kristallkugel, sieben magischen Ringen und natürlich Reisen durch die Zeit. 

Mit Logik hat dieses Wimmelbildspiel offenbar nichts am Hut. Funktioniert es denn zumindest? An sich schon, technisch gesehen zumindest. Das Problem: ""Time Mysteries"" ist unfaßbar leicht. Wimmelbildspiele sind ja an sich schon nicht gerade skillnotwendig, aber bei diesem Spiel hat man so gar keine Herausforderung. 

Die Idee mit den Zeitreisen, durch die man in verschiedenen Epochen spielt, ist an sich ganz nett, aber jede Zeitreise läuft im Prinzip immer wieder gleich ab. Dabei nehmen die Wimmelbildspiele an sich großen Raum ein, zwischen die Geschichten eingestreut werden noch simple Rätsel- oder Verschiebepuzzles und hat man dann den Ring, gibts noch ein Finde-die-sieben-Unterschiede-in-zwei-fast-identischen-Bildern. Spätestens nach der dritten Epoche ist man von der Repetetivität angenervt.

Die Grafik wäre okay, wäre sie nicht gelegentlich recht unscharf, so als käme die Auflösung nicht ganz mit. Schade auch, daß man in den Wimmelbildern mit etwas Übung die zu findenden Gegenstände recht leicht erkennt, weil sie teiks erkennbar auf das Bild aufgesetzt wirken. 

Und die Zwischensequenzen? Sind zumindest alle vertont, teils sogar mit einer ganz netten selbstironischen Haltung. Irritierend lächerlich wirken allerdings die Animationen. Fehlende Mimik wird einfach dadurch kompensiert, daß Gesichtspartien gedehnt oder gestaucht werden. Ziemlich albern.

Ich werde das Spiel auch dementsprechend bewerten.

Ich werde mir mit diesem Review wahrscheinlich keine Freunde machen, aber dieses Spiel ist eines der frustrierensten, langweiligsten und overall schlechtesten HOG's auf Steam. 
Ich habe bereits viele HOG's gespielt und einige sogar perfektioniert (100%) und kann daher reinen Gewissens sagen, dass dieses Spiel in einer der unteren Schubladen landet. 

Warum das? Bittesehr:

- Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist BEI WEITEM zu hoch. Sowohl für Menschen, die bei solchen Spielen abschalten möchten (Casual-Gamer) als auch für HOG-Veteranen ist das Spiel an mehreren Stellen weder unterhaltsam noch herausfordernd. 
   ----- Viele der Wimmelbild-Szenen sind so vollgestopft mit Gegenständen, dass man viele Items, die man zum Weiterspielen finden muss (die btw. meistens in der Hintergrundfarbe gehalten sind) einfach unsichtbar werden. Durch diese kann man sich zwar auf ""Normal"" ohne Strafe durchklicken (was bei den überwiegend winzigkleinen Items wie ""Stift"", ""Büroklammer"" und ""Marienkäfer"" nicht wirklich hilft), so aber nicht bei....
  ----- ... den Rätseln. EInige der Rätsel sind trotz Strategie und Verstand beinahe unknackbar. Um euch ein Beispiel zu geben, zitiere ich hier mal einen Diskussionsthread-Ersteller, welcher seinen Post ""That bloody rune game in the 7th Century"" getauft hat. Dieses Rätsel ist ein sogenanntes ""Lights Out Puzzle"", welches Ecken und Kanten hat. Das macht das ganze in meinen Augen zu schwer.

- Manche HO-Szenen sind alles andere als hochauflösend.
- Die Synchronstimmen sind unterirdisch schlecht.
- Die Story ist... nicht gut. Belassen wir es dabei...
- Man tut neben den HO-Szenen und den Rätseln leider immer dasselbe. Man verbringt mindestens 60% vom Spiel in diesem ""Raum der Zeit"".
- Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist bestenfalls 'noch ausreichend' (4-)

+/- Man kann so gesehen nicht sterben/verlieren
+/- Es gibt zwei Schwierigkeitsgrade
+/- Das Steam-Overlay funktioniert
+/- Achievements + Sammelkarten

+ Die Musik ist wirklich überragend. Eine Schande, dass Artifex Mundi bisher keinen OST-DLC freigeschaltet hat.
+ Viele der Schauplätze sehen wirklich super aus. Mir hat das Mittelalter zum Beispiel sehr gut gefallen.



Dieses Spiel sticht negativ unter allen anderen HOGs hervor - und das ist ziemlich schade, weil es sich bei ""Time Mysteries"" um einen Dreiteiler handelt. Dieses Spiel ist definitiv das Schlechteste unter den dreien (und das sage ich, obwohl ich den zweiten Teil zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt noch gar nicht angerührt habe). Das Spiel bleibt bis zum Ende langweilig, träge, eintönig und zum Ende hin sogar lachhaft aufgrund der Story und der Vertonung.


Solltet ihr nach einem guten HOG suchen, probiert ""Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink"" (auf Steam erhältlich), ""Robin's Quest"" (auf Steam erhältlich), „Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends“ (auf Steam erhältlich), ""Mystery of Mortlake Mansion"" oder ""Luxor Adventures"".

Tut euch selber einen Gefallen und macht einen großen Bogen um ""Time Mysteries: Inheritance - Remastered"".

[b]Gameplay: 2 / 10[/b] - Boring, awkward, odd, without sense

[b]Story: 1 / 10[/b] - I must stick it with logic part. There is not any logic in this game.

[b]Music: 4 / 10[/b] - most of the time it was not fitting and was very irritating. But 2 or 3 times it was ""ok"".

[b]HOG: 2 / 10[/b] - 60% of items was drawed another way than the background, it was hard not to spot them.... AND SPOONS.... That ducking spoons... Almost in every HOG segment over there you must find one...

[b]Puzzles: 1 / 10[/b] - maybe it is a game for players under the age of 12?

[b]Using items puzzles: 1 / 10[/b] - maxium items you could have is 4 I think and there was a 3 clickable / usable spots to click in the location. So... meh... babywork...

[b]Locations: 1 / 10[/b] - you can be only at 1 location divided to 2 ""rooms"" at a time. If you finish them, you can only leave the place and find 2 another, from another timeline.

[h1]- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------[/h1]

Artifex Mundi sp. z o.o. made for the first time a remastered edition for this game and made a sequel for it. The sequel will have almost the same mechanics and improved features but will not have the 7 difference mini-game and sonar.

The story is good and graphics are fine.

According to me there is much more hidden objects scenes than puzzle. Puzzle are so-so and not so hard or challenging. Finally the game features an inventory where you can store items to combine with the environment to go deeper in the story. 

The game have two difficulties and have a guest feature : all the family can play the game and resume it where they left.
 
Also you can use the Hint/Skip hourglass whenever you want and wait until its refill to use it again. But be warned that you may not skip any puzzle or use hint in hidden objects scene if you wish to have some achievements.

The good thing is you got a sonar for the hidden object scenes which will show you the shape of the item's name you point. (Perhaps it's only available is the easiest mode) Whenever game you played you can also switch to a match-3 mini game instead of the hidden objects scene but I guess that you won't got the achievement for the hidden objects scenes.

In this game there is a kind of ritual to be able to travel time, you need to place a magical ring then find the difference between two scenes after that you need to retrieve a list of objects of this century in a hidden objects scene to finally put them in the machine to open the door of the related period.


(*) :
The game has some achievements that can be missed they are mostly challenging achievements. 

The challenging achievements require you to finish a puzzle or a hidden objects scene game under a minute. And two achievements require you to find 3 objects in 3 seconds or find all objects with a few misclicks in the hidden object scenes. Have I already said you need to not skip any puzzle and to not use any hint in the hidden objects scene.",1461052081,1468923052,True,5,1,0.528260707855224609,0,False,False,False,False,,,

By concept and gameplay it's a standard Hidden Object aka Adventure-light game, with a rather bland story, lots of Hidden Object-screens and quite some (often very illogical) puzzles added into the mix. The story isn't very convincing, but it's not that bad and could support a game if the rest was executed with the high standards we've come to expect from Artifex Mundi. Sadly, this isn't the case: the visuals aren't appealing (even downright ugly in some places), the voice-acting is terrible and most important of all: the hidden object-scenes miss the mark by far. Quite often the different objects are almost impossible to spot due to their disappearing into the blurry visuals, or they simply don't match the description given. And the seven screens or so situated in the museum (the central hub of the game) are hampered by a pulsing light that gave me a headache while looking for the hidden objects.

Since this is one of the earliest games by Artifex Mundi on Steam, it probably isn't wise to compare it with their later, much more polished offerings, but just taken on its own merits, the game fails to deliver. Normally, hidden object games give a fine opportunity to score a ""perfect game"" as far as Steam achievements are concerned, but I gave up on this one in the end, and decided to quit it before finishing it. Happily, the later installments in this mini-series are MUCH better, and a game like this actually helps to appreciate the increase in quality Artifex Mundi has achieved since then.

Ya sabemos que los juegos de este tipo nunca serán grandes obras maestras, pero el género en sí entretiene bastante, relaja y da un toque de energía a los engranajes de tu cerebro. Además las historias de estos juegos son un aliciente que ayuda a continuar. 

Desgraciadamente este juego en concreto no tiene nada bueno: mala resolución hasta el punto de escenas borrosas que parecen corrosivas, historia cutre de principio a fin, animaciones pésimas ya que los movimientos faciales se basan en deformaciones al límite irritantes para la vista, como si se tratase de un cruel homenaje a los afectados de la radiación de Chernóbil. El estilo artístico es muy feo y simplón, los puzles repetitivos y básicos que no concuerdan con lo que se nos cuenta en cada momento.

Чтобы найти папу нам придется отправиться в путешествие во времени, пройти различные головоломки, познакомиться с далекими предками и искать предметы...

¥ Русский язык.
¥ В игре присутствуют мини игры (легкие и повторяющиеся).

¥ Бессмысленный поиск предметов.
¥ Банальный и высосанный из пальца сюжет.
¥ Короткая продолжительность игры.
¥ Чересчур простые мини игры.

[h1]Достижения:[/h1]
Все достижения можно получить за одно полное прохождение игры. Главное не пользоваться подсказками и не пропускать мини-игры. Сложность выбирайте - гость, вам будет намного проще играть, а на достижения сложность не влияет.

[h1]Итог:[/h1]
Самая простая игра в жанре ""я ищу"", целостный и законченный сюжет. И можно смело пройдя ее забыть о двух продолжениях, как и наоборот начинать со второй части пропустив первую - наиболее слабую. Не рекомендую.

Les SOC sont peu évidentes à cause d'effets (flou / jeu de lumière) ça m'a plus filé la migraine qu'autre chose.
Graphismes relativement bof pour un scénario qui a été ajouté juste pour border.

- an hour in and i've already noticed 3 or 4 spelling errors in the dialog. (In the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy i only noticed 2 in the whole series, and one of them might have been intentional pirate slang.)

- while the animated scenes look relatively modern/slick, the HO scenes are fairly grainy and appear to be from the 1990's, and it's essentially impossible to tell what certain items are (cufflinks? Really? a knight?). The relatively grainy graphics on the HO parts are leaving me second-guessing too often.

- One HO scene wants you to find a compass, but it's got 2 different once (but only one of them is valid). (Look carefully!)

- At least one flat out lie: ""It looks just like the dresser in this room!"" There _is_ no dresser in this room. That leaves me wondering how many more inaccuracies will be tripping me up along the way.

- Objective texts appearing before they should. ""New Objective: Investigate the painting the ghost pointed to"" is shown as the ghost appears but before it points to anything. Minor, but confusing nonetheless.

- None of the puzzles presented so far as _any_ explanatory text. Just start clicking until you figure it out. (Maybe hard-core puzzlers like that, but i don't.)


OTOH, i like the voice acting and the pacing.


i'm unfortunately forced to rate this a ""thumbs down."" This came in a set of episodes 1 to 3, so we'll just move on to part 2. Maybe some rainy day i'll revisit episode 1.

Wcielamy się w niej w Vivien Ambrose, młodą doktor fizyki. Pewnego dnia, odwiedzając swój dom rodzinny, bohaterka dowiaduje się, że jej ojciec został porwany przez tajemniczego mężczyznę podróżującego w czasie oraz znajduje magiczną kulę, umożliwiającą takie właśnie podróże. Niedługo potem Vivien podejmuje się podróży w czasie w celu uwolnienia rodzica.

Większość rozgrywki w Inheritance przyjmuje formę tzw. hidden object, czyli odnajdywania ukrytych obiektów. Graczowi zostaje przedstawione zdjęcie, na którym znajduje się duża ilość różnych przedmiotów, oraz lista obiektów, które należy na tym obrazku wskazać. Łamigłówki zostały przygotowane całkiem dobrze. Przedmioty są zazwyczaj zręcznie wmieszane w otoczenie. Ponadto twórcy posuwają się czasem do takich środków, jak umieszczenie jednego z obiektów na obrazku w obrazku lub jako rysunku na innym przedmiocie. Takie zabiegi przyjemnie urozmaicają rozgrywkę i wymuszają na graczu nieco szersze postrzeganie otoczenia. Oprócz fragmentów hidden object, przyjdzie nam stawić czoła szeregowi innych zagadek logicznych. Będziemy układać puzzle, szukać różnic pomiędzy obrazkami, grać w masterminda oraz rozwiązać różne inne, mniej lub bardziej klasyczne łamigłówki. Wszystkiego dopełniają fragmenty wyjęte z typowym gier point'n'click, w których za pomocą myszki podnosimy przedmioty i dokonujemy z nimi interakcji. Poszczególne elementy są nieźle zbalansowane i tworzą spójną całość. Warto zaznaczyć, że Time Mysteries: Inheritance to gra casualowa. Żadna z zagadek nie powinna okazać się dla nikogo zbyt trudna, a nawet jeżeli tak się stanie, to prawie każdy etap rozgrywki można pominąć.

Produkcja ma też jednak swoje wady. Po pierwsze prezentuje się ona dość ubogo pod względem fabularnym. Historia przedstawiona w grze jest prosta, dialogów jest dość mało i są one mocno uproszczone. Często można odnieść wrażenie, że bohaterowie zachowują się nieodpowiednio do danej sytuacji, przez co całość przypomina raczej baśń lub bajkę dla dzieci niż poważną opowieść. Nie każdemu spodoba się też oprawa wizualna produkcji, w szczególności animacje oparte na deformowaniu dwuwymiarowych obrazków. Można się też przyczepić do samych rysunków. Ogólnie prezentują się całkiem dobrze, ale podczas poszukiwania przedmiotów można zauważyć, że niektóre przedmioty nie pasują do końca do sceny. Przykładowo są trochę inaczej oświetlone. Kilka razy zdarzyło się, że zaraz po rozpoczęciu sekwencji hidden object, zamiast sprawdzić listę przedmiotów do znalezienia, wskazywałem po prostu te, które nie pasowały do otoczenia. Trochę zawiodła mnie też polska lokalizacja gry, tym bardziej że ostatecznie jest to nasza rodzima produkcja. A dopatrzyłem się w niej pojedynczych błędów interpunkcyjnych oraz mało składnie złożonych zdań. Nazwy niektórych obiektów do znalezienia są przetłumaczone trochę myląco.

Podsumowując, Time Mysteries: Inheritance to całkiem przyjemna i prosta gra logiczno-przygodowa. Pod wieloma względami przypomina produkcję dla młodszych graczy, ale nie znaczy to, że tylko do nich jest ona skierowana. Pierwsza część Time Mysteries nie zalicza się z pewnością do czołówki gatunku, ani nie pokazuje w pełni, na co stać studio Artifex Mundi, ale jeśli ktoś tylko gustuje w takich grach, to z Inheritance może przyjemnie spędzić około trzech godzin.",1458219414,1458219414,True,12,0,0.670357704162597656,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There are a couple problems with this old but updated title.  Even the updated grapics are subpar. I am not a graphics whore but when you make an HOG, your hidden objects have to be clearly defined. There were many HO that were too blurry to identify and there were a couple that  were miss named. 

This is the type of HOG game where when you are looking for an object, and then you think to yourself, ""Hey I wonder if they think object X is really Y. And yes there were two or three times where an object was clearly mislabled. But not for adventurous clicking, I would not have got it.

Единственный плюс игры – это разнообразие локаций. Мы побываем и в средневековье и в эпохе Возрождения и в Викторианские времена. Бывает любопытно, куда нас занесет в следующий раз.

[b]Zusammenfassung/Kommentar:[/b]

Eine Sache, die ich am Steam Reviewsystem nicht mag: Es gibt nur ja (empfehlen) und nein (nicht empfehlen). Aus meiner Sicht sollte es zumindest noch die Möglichkeit eingeführt werden ein Spiel als jein (ausgeglichen / oder-als-was-auch-immer) zu bewerten. 

Den dieses Spiel ist jein, wie einige andere Spiele auch. Es macht einige Sachen richtig gut und andere sind dagegen nicht so gut gelungen. Grundsätzlich muss man hier wohl im Hinterkopf behalten, dass dieses Wimmelbildspiel eine Neuauflage eines der ersten Spiele von Artifex Mundi ist. 

Das, was dieses Spiel ausmacht (aber auch zur Qual machen kann) sind die Wimmelbildszenen. Zu einem Großteil besteht dieses Spiel aus Wimmelbildszenen und wenigen Rätseln. Wer ein solches Spiel sucht, wäre bei Time Mysteries genau richtig. Die Suchszenen scheinen auch schwieriger zu sein, als in späteren Spielen von Artifex Mundi. Das scheint aber ein wenig mit der allgemeinen Qualität zusammenzuhängen. Die Wimmelbildszenen wirken sehr überladen. Viele Gegenstände werden im Hintergrund oder bei anderen Gegenständen verborgen – meist farblich angepasst oder durchscheinender dargestellt. Die Gegenstände sind aber nie so schlecht dargestellt, dass man etwas nicht finden kann. 
Allerdings habe ich feststellen müssen, dass die Suchszenen meine Augen mit der Zeit sehr belastet haben. Etwas das mir bei anderen Wimmelbildspielen nicht so stark ausgeprägt passiert ist. 

Was die Grafik, Animationen und etc. angeht, bekleckert sich dieses Spiel wirklich nicht mit Ruhm – und das ist, je nachdem wie streng man ist, noch höflich ausgedrückt. Normalerweise störe ich mich an der Grafik gerade bei Wimmelbildspielen wenig. Für wenig Geld erwarte ich auch nicht so viel, die ganze Grafik muss aber zusammenpassen. Hier sieht alles sehr zusammengewürfelt aus. Einige Szenen wirken wie gemalt, andere wie überarbeitete Fotografien. Manche Sachen sind sehr verpixelt. 
Die Animationen hätten sie besser ganz weglassen sollen. Beim Sprechen verzehrt sich der ganze Kopf. Manchmal verzehrt er sich aber so, dass der Mund verrutscht und man schwarze Stellen sehen kann. 

Und nun zu meinem Hauptkritikpunkt: der wiederkehrende Ablauf im Spiel. 
[olist]
    [*]Wimmelbild lösen (Grund: Sachen finden aus der Zeit in die gereist werden soll.)
    [*]Zeitzone X angekommen: einige Wimmelbilder und ein Rätsel lösen –> Ring finden
    [*]Rückreise – zum Abschluss Findet-den-Unterschied lösen
    [*]Alles beginnt wieder von vorn[/olist]
Ich möchte nicht zu sehr von der Story spoilern, daher nur soviel: Es müssen 7 Ringe wiederbeschafft werden und das alles nach oben erwähnten Schema X. Daher fand ich das Spielprinzip recht eintönig und einfallslos.

Das Review klingt nicht sehr positiv, dennoch habe ich es das Spiel ganz gern gehabt. Gerade weil es so viele, teilweise herausfordernde Wimmelbildszenen enthielt. 

[i][b]Fazit:[/b][/i] Dieses Spiel bekommt von mir gerade noch so eine Empfehlung, wenn man ein Spiel mit vielen und schwierigeren Wimmelbildern (und wenigen leichten Rätseln) sucht, dann probiert es ruhig aus. Bitte kauft es euch aber im Angebot. Für den Vollpreis würde ich es nicht empfehlen.",1452520720,1452520769,True,14,2,0.699176311492919922,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Grande fan des jeux du studio Artifex, de Point and Click et d'Hidden objects, c'est avec bonheur que je me suis offert le pack de la trilogie Time Mysteries sur Steam. Malgré les évaluations variables, voire négatives.

Ben j'aurais du un peu plus m'y fier.

C'est l'histoire de Vivian Ambrose, et de sa famille. C'est une histoire de voyages dans le temps, d'époques diverses et variées, d'énigmes, de sauvetage ... L'intrigue est bancale, trop simple, facile, mais ça se pardonnerais assez vite si le reste suivait.

Mais on se contente de faire un tour dans la salle du temps, de faire une SOC (scène d'objets cachés), d'activer une porte temporelle, de passer 10min dans une époque (où tout le monde connais notre famille et notre secret de voyageur temporel ...), on fait quelques énigmes, quelques SOC, on récupère la bague et hop, retour à la salle du temps, SOC, nouvelle époque.

Les personnages principaux ou secondaires ne sont pas attachants, seul le globe m'a un peu fait sourire, mais sans plus. Le Sonar est pratique pour voir à quoi ressemble les objets qu'on cherche dans une SOC (scène d'objets cachés) surtout que celles ci sont franchement moches comparées à ce que peux nous offrir Artifex ! Je n'ai pas vu trop d'erreur de traductions, ce qui évite de chercher une pipe et d'en fait trouver un tuyau (Pipe, pipe, vous saisissez?) Certaines SOC sont auréolées d'une lumière qui clignote, notamment dans la salle du temps, et c'est affreusement gênant. Ça ne donne pas un côté mystique, ça donne juste envie de faire une crise d'épilepsie.

Bref, le jeu n'est pas très beau, il a une sorte de ""grain"" dérangeant, les énigmes sont correctes sans plus, les SOC brouillonnes (même pas besoin de regarder la liste d'objets à trouver, ils nous sautent aux yeux tellement ils sont mal incrustés dans le décor fixe) et il n'est au final pas très intéressant ...

Pour les fans du genre, préférez les Nightmares from the Deep (le 3 est magnifique, très Pirate/Steampunk) ou Grim Legends.

There's a lot of hidden object puzzles throughout the game, and I assume that's why you're looking at this game, because that's what interests you.

There's are some ""adventure game"" type puzzles, but they are really simple, and require very little backtracking.  There's a story that's not particularly interesting.  The characters are acted by voice actors that sound terribly amateur.  But none of that is going to take away from the hidden object and find the difference puzzles which are this game's bread and butter.

Perhaps there's a translation issue somewhere, but the writing was just as painful.

Das Spiel soll ja ""remastered"" sein, aber gerade bei den Minispielen ist es sehr unausgereift. 

Häufig weiß man bei den Minispielen nämlich anfangs gar nicht, was man eigentlich machen soll. Es handelt sich dann oft um Spiele, bei denen man einfach nach dem Versuchs- und Irrtums-Prinzip rumklicken muss, bis es irgendwann passt. Am schlimmsten sind die beiden Rätsel, bei denen man so lange klicken muss, bis alle Knöpfe eingerastet sind bzw. leuchten. Das ist einfach nur frustrierend. 

Daneben gibts bei den Minispielen kleinere Mängel. Bei einem Spiel muss man die passenden Ritualgegenstände anklicken (das man das machen muss, findet man raus, indem man rumklickt). Witzig ist hierbei, dass der untere  Ritualgegenstand von der ""Überpringen""-Leiste verdeckt wird. 
Bei dem Apfelamulett muss man wiederum die Puzzleteile in dem Quadrat (!) so legen, dass die Schrift waagerecht ist. Ich hab Sie senkrecht angeordnet. Warum kann die Protagonistin nicht einfach das Quadrat drehen? Grrr ;-)

Richtig unfair wurde es gegen Ende des Spiels. Ich spiele Wimmelbildspiele gerne so durch, dass ich alle Achievements erreiche. Für eines davon darf man in keiner Wimmelbildszene einen Tipp verwenden. Das ist ja kein Thema, die verwende ich eh nie in den Szenen. 
Sooo...blöd nur, dass man bei einem Zeitsprung gegen Ende des Spiels direkt in eine Wimmelbildszene geworfen wird, anstatt wie in den immer gleich ablaufenden Zeitsprüngen davor stets in einer ""normalen"" Umgebung zu landen. Das habe ich leider nicht gemerkt. Ich klicke also auf die Türe, fahre mit dem Cursor herum, finde jedoch kein Symbol, das reagiert. Was muss ich also tun? Klicken wir mal auf ""Hinweis""...

So overall the gameplay is fine - the point and click sections are all fairly decently done, the puzzles are fairly varied but easy and not really challenging (for example we do a 4x4 knight move puzzle, except you can reuse the same squares over and over to cover all 16 squares, so you can't get lose), the hidden object scenes are mostly decent and playable with the exception mainly of the history archive which has this weird glow that fades in and out and made it difficult for me to look at the screen for long (kind of a problem for a hidden object game!)

In terms of the story it is fairly standard stuff, you are some amazingly special person that has to save the world using your time traveling abilities, everywhere in time you go everyone lavishing praise on you as one of the smartest people of all time, which you prove by solving one or two very simple puzzles. The structure also makes it a bit repetitive as you do exactly the same series of actions seven times as you recover each of the rings you drop at the start.

Other flaws for me include being British the protaganists accent was very annoying, but probably works fine for American audiences. Another being the weird non-animation of speaking characters where static images of their head kind of bulges and warps when they are speaking.

But overall this is perfectly playable and decent enough, although later entries in the series are somewhat better from what I remember, the main reservation I would have is the glow effect in the archive which did nearly get me to quit the game half finished a couple of times (and note you go to the archive seven or eight times in all)",1451136717,1451136717,True,2,0,0.538002967834472656,0,True,False,False,False,,,

・Hidden Objectのゲームとしてはアイテム探しの頻度が多すぎる
・タイムトラベルしている割に主人公がすんなりそれぞれの時代に溶け込んでいるので、あまりタイムトラベルしてる感じがしない
・○○を探せといった時の○○が複数画面にあったりする。そのためにアイテムのシルエット機能があるのだが、アイテム探しとしては納得感が薄い
・他の人も書いてるが画面の光のエフェクトでアイテムを探しづらくしている

以上の点がアイテム探しとしては気になったがそれに加えて

・次の目的が手帳にタスクとして書かれるが、ストーリーの流れで何をやらなきゃいけないかプレイヤーが把握するより前に、手帳に書き込まれる。置いてけぼり感がある。
・水晶球と会話するシーンが多いのだが、""ball"" の訳が「玉ちゃん」て…玉袋筋太郎じゃないんだから

按理来说，一个系列的第一作可能不是最好的，但是一定会是奠定整个系列作品基调的一作。然而本作是整部系列里面和故事以及解谜系统相关性最低的一作。
首先，本作从头到尾也是仅仅交代出安布罗斯家族会穿越这一点，其他对整个故事的发展毫无帮助。
其次，本作的谜题设置简直可以说是侮辱玩家的智商，一款寻物解谜游戏的寻物环节里面的隐藏物品已经明显到不用看下方文字提示的程度了（而且寻物过程中那恶心的光效才是真正为玩家游玩增加难度的主因），7个找茬关以及其他谜题更是无聊透顶。
最后，我不止一次提过这家公司的动画制作是渣，本作简直可以说是游戏公司偷懒到极致的典型了，人物的对话完全靠静态图上做出一点面部抽动的效果，再回过头来看后2部的过场动画简直让人感动到流泪（毕竟玩家可以看出来那个NPC是在说话而不是脸部抽筋）。
最后还是那句话，如果不是成就党和寻物解谜类游戏狂热爱好者就不要入手这款游戏了。就算你是，也建议在入手所有这家公司的游戏时请严格按照发售时间从前到后依次玩下去，不然真心会对玩家的身心造成损害的。。。

It's a remastered version of an ""older"" game.  But, unless my Google-fu is letting me down, the original game came out in 2010.  So, we're not talking about an ancient game.  Anyway, the game is a casual adventure Hidden Object Game (HOG) and has its good side and its bad side.  For the good, there are a lot of HOGs and mini-games here, and they're much harder than normal (I guess that's good).  For the bad..., well:

- The story is pretty bad.  It's much worse than AM's norm.  Not only is the story silly, its ""logic"" breaks down by the end and there are all kind of holes in it.

- For the most part, the voice-acting, per-se, is adequate for the genre.  But, at the end, the voice acting of the ""villain"" is just awful.

- The animation in the main story is pretty bad.  When the characters talk, their mouths and lips don't necessarily move.  Instead, their whole heads deform like balloons.

- Even though this game has been ""remastered,"" the end result is not even.  Speaking specifically of the HOGs, some of them are very nicely drawn, while others (the painting ones) are horrible.  In the horrible ones, you can't even make out what the items are that you're supposed to be finding.  Even in the non-horrible ones, the lighting and shading in some of the HOGs is bad enough that you can't even see that something exists in certain areas, let alone figure out what it is to click on it.

- All of the HOGs (badly rendered or not) are very busy and have very small items to find.  Also, the HOGs, themselves, are just about all unique.  There's a HOG you go through repeatedly, but the content changes (not just the items you're looking for - the actual pictures are different).  I can think of only one HOG that's used twice.  This makes getting the timed Achievement very difficult.  Remember, these are all busy scenes with tiny items to find.

- Almost all the mini-games are entirely lacking in instructions and goals.  Some of them are very hard to figure out what's even happening.

That's a lot of bad stuff for a game I'm still recommending.  But, even with the problems, I found the HOGs, in general, to be good.  They're definitely challenging.  But, if you're interested in the game, beware the pricing.  The current list price is about $10.  It took me 4.7 hours to get 100% Achievements.  So, I normally wouldn't pay more than $5 for it.  But, with the issues the game has, I'd look for it for even less.",1441592198,1441634471,True,10,1,0.617484986782073975,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Alors parlons de Time Mysteries: Inheritance - Remastered,

Ba pour un premier épisode c'est vraiment pas mal. L'histoire est bonne et assez captivante.

Les graphismes sont bons, avec des décors colorés et variés, petit point faible, les animations des persos qui ressemblent plus a des déformations que des mouvements. Mais dans l'ensemble c'est propre.

La musique est bonne et les bruitage aussi, coté musical c'est un peut repetitif pour certaines mais ca passe.

Sinon ba comme dis plus haut c'est quand meme un épisode de la serie Artifex donc une valeure sure, et ca reste un bon jeux malgres ces petits defauts qui ne gachent en rien le gameplay ni l'histoire.

Donc pouce bleu quand meme héhé, mais seulement pour les fans qui veulent combler leur bibliotheque, pour les autres je dirais de voir d'autres episodes qui sont plus palpitant coté story ;D

女主挺美但是各种表情太做作，仿佛在看B级电影一样。游戏没有剧情成就不开心，但毕竟是比较老的作品，这点不苛求，不过，正因为是老作品重制了也没改进么？除了女主之外的其他角色都略诡异，尤其是在对话的时候，全身只有一张脸有动作是那么的奇怪，就如同被发酵的面包一样四处膨胀说话的时候总带着一种猥琐的笑容令人不快。
    我也玩过几作点击解密游戏了，但为何玩本作就老是卡关呐，我就纳闷了，各种场景变着花样的找东西，找东西，找东西，看的人眼都花了，解密游戏要的是费脑而不是花眼啊，哪有找东西的数量比其他小游戏要多的点击解密游戏啊？！找物要的是静止画面，脑抽的制作者不知道是怎么想的，弄了光源变化的图片，而且超级恶心的是不适用提示过所有找物品谜题，你这赤裸裸的恶意，我经常要看一张图看很长时间，甚至要拉上小伙伴一起来找，我服了。

这游戏本来我3个小时就可以通关，但各种截图切换出去导致游戏关闭和中途数次卡关以及一次为了全成就从头再来花了我更多时候，所以我更不开心了，许多委婉的话也变的毒舌了，我玩的不开心我干嘛不来黑你，真是的。

比起AT社的其他作品来说还有着切换后会无响应关闭的BUG，让我想起了我之前给差评的一部作品：Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends。重制版优化就不能弄好一点么？而且最重要的是！跳出之后存档不保存！

为了不让这游戏荼毒其他玩家，我自己弄了一个攻略图片。

Now that that's out of the way. Is this a bad game? No, not at all. I would honestly rather give this a neutral rating. In the sea that is Artifex Mundi games this is however, on the lower end. It's old and despite being remastered, it shows its age. Now, that isn't really a bad thing and not why I feel meh about this game. It's the storyline.

All of the games are about the time traveling Ambrose family, except the events this game have very little connection to the other two. Some things are mentioned and two of the characters do show up again but not the main character which I found disappointing. At the end it seems like she's going to go on exciting adventures and...nope. Not to mention, the story was a little confusing, had plot holes and left me with more questions than answers. If you DO play this game then you should play the other two in the series, they will help answer some of the questions left by this one.

All that aside, because of the storyline and rather dull mini games I found playing this a chore. Sure, the hidden object scenes were beautiful and fun but having to collect things to time travel got tedious. Not to mention, the odd lighting effects hurt my eyes and caused me to strain them a bit.

My other pet peeve were the cut scenes and how their mouths moved, would have been better to not move at all. However, that isn't such a big deal so I got used to it. It's an older game so some allowances are to be made. Like Micheal sounding like he was voiced by Microsoft Sam.

Overall, the other two Time Mysteries games are better and stronger story wise. This game isn't bad but it's also not good. Play it if it's on sale or in a bundle but I recommend just skipping to the other games in the series for a better experience.

... tohle je jedna z prvních her od bohů HOG žánru Artifex Mundi. Také nejela na jejich enginu Spark. I proto vyšel na Steamu nejprve druhý díl jejich trilogie Time Mysteries, jenž byl krátce poté následován uzavřením trilogie. AM si dalo tu práci, aby převedlo i první část příběhu. Má tedy cenu se do tohoto prvního dílu pustit?

[h1]Smát se nebo brečet? [/h1]
První zápory se objeví už zpočátku hry. Ano, mám na mysli (ne)kvalitu grafického zpracování, příšerné animace, strašně nízké rozlišení textur, divnou hudbu a otřesný dabing postav. Vše to působí skoro až groteskně, a tak nebudete vědět, jestli se tomu všemu smát nebo brečet nad tím, co je tohle za hru.

[h1]Příběh vše zachrání, že? [/h1]
Samozřejmě můžete ignorovat vše výše uvedené a hrát hru. Protože příběh je to, oč tu běží, že? Špatně! Nejde dokonale popsat, jak tu příběh nedává vůbec smysl, ale pokud byste chtěli zhruba takový náčrt toho, tady to máte: „Děje se tu toho moc najednou, ale přitom se vlastně neděje nic.“ Tento citát jsem si půjčil od Lucky Thirteen a vtipně shrnuje to, o co ve hře jde. Jen ještě dodám, že postavy tu jsou takové nijaké, ploché charaktery bez hloubky.

A až po 3 nebo 4 hodinách konečně dorazíte na konec téhle „pecky“, budete odměněni vskutku zajímavým koncem, který vás dostatečně uspokojí a vynahradí vám všechen ten čas. Oh, vlastně ne. Konec je tu tak odfláklý, nedává vůbec, ale VŮBEC smysl a dialogy tu působí jako kdyby je někdo náhodně poslepoval k sobě.

[h1]A co hádanky... ? [/h1]
Po technické stránce je to bída, po příběhové stránce taktéž. Zbývá tedy třetí pilíř všech her tohoto žánru. HOG hry a hádanky. Odpověď na otázku je NE. Nejsou dobré. Hádanek je celkem málo a i když je pár celkem originálních a zajímavých, zbytek sráží špatné provedení a jednoduchost.

HOG hry na druhou stranu jsou zatraceně těžké a je jich fakt dost, možná až příliš moc. To je dobře, ne? Bylo by, kdyby ta obtížnost nespočívala v tom, že:
[olist]
[*] Dost často poblikává obrazovka, takže se vaše oči musí přizpůsobovat a vy jste tak rozladění (možná to vadilo jen mě, ale fakt to byl děs).
[*] Hledané předměty jakoby splývají s pozadím, takže mnohdy ani netušíte, že přesně tohle je ta kýžená věc.
[*]Nízké rozlišení textur dělá z toho všeho utrpení. U některých věcí ani netušíte, co to je a některé jsou tak rozostřené, až je to fakt hnus.
[/olist]

[h1] „Bonusy“ na závěr [/h1]
Hratelnost hry je taky dost špatná. Tohle dílo je strašně repetitivní, kdy provádíte ty samé úkoly 7x v řadě!!! Všech sedm „kapitol“ je tedy zcela stejných, co se týče principu. Ano, máte tu minihru v podobě hledání rozdílů, která by osvěžila hru, jenže ve skutečnosti z toho nízké rozlišení dělá spíš další věc na obtíž.

Díky „zapuštěnosti“ předmětů důležitých pro váš další postup, navíc ani obyčejné obrazovky nejsou nějakou procházkou, ale musíte myší projíždět každý kout a dívat se, jestli se ukazatel nezmění na ruku, což znamená, že tenhle předmět můžete dát do svého inventáře.

Jako taková shnilá třešnička na dortu přichází po konci hry návrat do menu, kdy zjistíte, že toto dílo nenabízí žádné dodatečné dobrodružství ani jakýkoliv jiný druh bonusů. Na jednu stranu to možná zamrzí, na druhou ale... [b]DÍKY BOHU! [/b]

[h1]Plusy [/h1]
+ zajímavý nápad na příběh
+ hlavní postava je sexy, když nemluví
+ po 4 hodinách se konečně dostaví konec hry a vy si tak oddechnete, protože tuhle hru odinstalujete a už nikdy v životě se k ní nevrátíte

[h1]Mínusy [/h1]
- trapný příběh, který nedává smysl (a to si teprve počkejte na ten konec...)
- ploché postavy
- otřesný dabing
- nic moc hudba
- grafické zpracování
- nízké rozlišení textur
- divné animace
- hádanek je málo a většinou jsou lehké
- HOG hry jsou naopak těžké a je jich tu až příliš
- repetitivní hratelnost
- žádné bonusy
- vysoká cena (vzhledem ke kvalitě bych doporučoval kupovat za 1 euro a méně)

[h1]Konečný verdikt [/h1]
[b]Mé hodnocení: 1,5/10 [/b]

Čekal jsem, že hra bude špatná, ale ne až takhle moc. Nedokázal jsem ji ani hrát v kuse, příběh mě po pár minutách přestal zajímat, postavy taktéž. U HOG miniher jsem nakonec vzdal nějaké hledání předmětů a místo toho jsem radši klikal všude možně. A když se po 4 hodinách konečně dostavil konec hry, ulevilo se mi. V dnešní době, kdy je na Steamu plno kvalitních HOG her (nejen od AM) nevidím jediný důvod, proč sáhnout i po tomhle. Možná proto, že druhý nebo třetí díl trilogie může být už o dost lepší. Nebo si to koupíte, protože máte rádi Artifex Mundi a chcete zkusit jednu z jejich prvních her.

Dann kommen solche Wimmelbildspiele immer gut bei mir an, weil sie eben nicht sehr schwer zu lösen sind, ein entspanntes spielen also.

Außerdem stehe ich total auf das Thema Zeitreise, wie es auch Time Mysteries: Inheritance - Remastered thematisiert. Ich finde dabei jeden Ansatz interessant, denn hinter jedem Ansatz einer Zeitreise, des Gedanken an die Möglichkeit und wie man das umsetzen könnte steckt viel Nachdenken. Ich finde es dabei immer spannend mich auf diese Thematik einzulassen und der Phantasie der Entwickler nachzuerleben. Das fand ich in diesem Spiel sehr gut gelungen und weil ich eben auf diese ganze Zeitreise-Thematik stehe denke ich hatte ich besonders viel Spaß mit diesem Spiel. Vielleicht ist das bei Euch anders, wenn euch das Thema nicht interessiert, ist ja bei Wimmelbildspielen häufig der Fall, dass diese sehr Storyabhängig sind, denn das ist schließlich bei der Art von Spielen auch das wichtigste.

Time Mysteries 1: The Inheritance is one of (or is) the first hidden object games made by Artifex Mundi – a developer who is by now associated with the best contemporary hidden object titles on the market.

Not even the remake can mask the typical rookie developer issues though, like low-resolution, pixelated pictures or amateurish cut-scenes, where the story progresses by making two character portraits talk to each other.
It also shows the great potential Artifex Mundi had even by then. The hidden object scenes use public assets, cheap item placement, and pixel hunting, yet they are unique and surprisingly enjoyable.

The cheesy story about a family of time travellers is full of hammy dialogues, and it is barely more than a quick excuse to use a bunch of different themes from early medieval times to early 20th century Paris.

Let's tackle the big point here first, this is the remastered edition which I assume to mean it's redone graphics and such. Firstly, even with redone graphics a lot of the hidden object scences look worse than a youtube video at lowest quality. This being said, that makes these hidden object scenes painful to play since it's so badly pixelated you can't tell what it is you're looking at! To top it off in hidden object scenes when you go back to the hub, they all have this weird glowy light effect that really hurts the eyes. I just resorted to using a guide from the internet for most of those scenes after a while.

In terms of plot, it's very one dimensional, father gets kidnapped -> chase bad guy to reclaim rings -> finds rings -> catch bad guy -> save father. It really doesn't get that much more shallow than that. The game also suffers from the same formula the entire game. Go to an area that usually has only two screens, find 1/7 of the rings, go back to hub, do a spot the difference mini-game, then play horrible lightest hidden object scene, rinse and repeat 7+ times. It just feel stale and very linear.

For characters and cut scenes... Well... it's different.... Basically they took the original hand drawn graphics and instead of remastering them they just di weird stretchy things to them to make them look animated. It just looks like they have a monster inside of them trying to transform them into something. Not to mention how their skull buldges and warps as they speak. Redone graphics there were actually really horrible as they were done very lazily.

Overall, skip this game, it's not a gret hidden object game nor will it entertain you very much. Great if you can get it in a bundle and want to kill some time but if you actually want some entertainment value, look at most of the other games Artifex Mundi has made.

The storyline... well to be honest it's awful and makes absolutely no sense at the end.

[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]

Game Visuals

I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.

Game Audio

I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.

Gameplay

There are two different difficulty modes to choose from: Regular and Expert.

The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.

There is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary. The inventory panel comes automatically stationary.

The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions.

There is an optional mini-game: Match 3. It is only available during hidden object scenes.

The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.

There is a bonus chapter in the game. But it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.

There are ten different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they are unlocked.

Miscellaneous

There are six different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.

Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.",1433386469,1602041671,True,3,0,0.526641011238098145,0,False,True,False,False,,,

+ An old HOG that shows how bad this genre was 5 years ago.
+ Hilariously bad voice acting and dialog (?)
+ Nonsensical plot (?)
+ When people talk their heads are animated in a way they deform and look like they're going to explode, nice effect xD

CONS:

+ Low resolution graphics makes game harder.
+ Items are hidden using annoying tactics like: same color (white over white), different texture (a cup with wooden texture), a lot of the item obscured behind other items (that little end over there is a guitar!), ambiguous names.
+ Puzzles don't have instructions nor even a hint of what to do (in one or two you spend more time knowing what to do than actually doing it)
+ Re-used assets (there is one room you keep coming back 7 times to search hidden objects and every search for the difference round in between-rings is a room you've already been to)

While one of the weakest offerings by this developer in terms of quality, it's also one of the most (probably unintentionally) hilarious games of the bunch. The story and scenes are super cheesy, and the weird lipsynching animation and awful voice acting in parts really doesn't help matters. 

However, it still has some charm and mechanically it offers the same style of hidden object scenes and puzzles as the other A.M. titles, just not quite as polished. For example, I really found the lighting in some of the scenes, including the archive of artifacts you revisit over and over, really distracting. The dimming and brightnening light really just gave me a headache while I searched for objects.

The game is short and only takes a couple of hours to play through. Having played this game on another platform before it was available on Steam, I can't really say that I noticed much ""remastering"" and it pretty much looked exactly the same as it did as an app.

I'm still recommending the game, but only for hardcore HOG/AM fans and anyone that really likes a bit of cheese with their games from time to time.  Although it's definitely not essential to play through before continuing in the Time Mysteries series — which does improve drastically in quality through the sequels — it's kind of neat to see the story develop and I liked the way the third game went back to the central hub you first encounter in this game.

This one, however, I don't think I could recommend to anyone but a die-hard Hidden Object game fan.

My main complaints are basically:
* The Hidden Object components are far more frequent than they typically are in other AM titles.  Other titles feel more like Adventure Games which happen to include HO puzzles, whereas this one is very much a HO game which happens to include a few extra elements.
* The central Museum area HO puzzles, which you'll apparently do seven times, are all set in the same room and feature a distracting throbbing-light effect
* Inclusion of spot-the-difference puzzles as well
* The interface is clunkier than their later offerings...  One specific problem I had was the 17th Century chemistry puzzle seemed to get locked in an unfinishable state, with the ""Skip"" counter no longer even moving forward (so I couldn't complete the puzzle, and also couldn't skip it), which was the final thing that led to my uninstallation.

On top of those, there was the typical absurd and nonsensical plot, which I can typically just roll with and enjoy for having the surreal fever-dream like atmosphere which other Artifex Mundi plots cultivate, but combined with the frustrations above, it didn't do anything for me.

So yeah: check out some other Artifex Mundi titles instead, especially if you're new to the genre.  The two ""Grim Legends"" titles are the ones I'd finished just before starting this one, and were superb examples of the genre, IMO.",1432935447,1432935447,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Crank a game out as quickly as possible and with minimal regard for quality.  And I'm not saying that because it's a casual game, or even because it's a hidden item game.  I happen to like that genre, it's a great way to kill time.  But this particular game has problems with it.

Like other Artifex Mundi games (I have played several), this one does the ""warping the image to simulate movement/talking"".  The problem is, the effect looks really, really bad.  Particularly in this game, which seemed to be even worse than previous games I played.  There are at least two parts of the game where the wrong person reads a line.  A line clearly meant for someone else, yet it made it through the voice work and animation and nobody caught it.  That may well be that the reason for this is the developers are not native English speakers (Artifex Mundi is a Polish company).  This can also be evident a couple times where there are some awkward sentences, or where some of the 'hidden objects' are misnamed (there's one instance were a baseball is listed as a 'tennis ball', and another where - despite being correct, and specific, elsewhere in the game - a candle holder is merely labeled 'candle').

As for the hidden object puzzles themselves, there's a couple instances where the item you are looking far is drawn on something, but is done so lightly as to make it nearly impossible to see.  Also, unlike several other games from this developer, there is story mode... and that's it.  There is no bonus adventure, no area to repeat the puzzles, you have the play through which auto saves and nothing more.  On the plus side at least, the achievements for this game can actually be completed in a single play through (some other games prevent this from being the case).

As for the story aspect, it is pretty typical Artifex Mundi fare.  Something to drive the player forward, a reason to go from puzzle to puzzle.  And it works, you can 'care' enough to get through it.  However, the story completely gives up at the end.  To the point where it seems to forget that certain events have happened, shifts gears entirely, and ends abruptly with a bit of a hand wave.

If you really, really enjoy this genre, and don't mind some flaws in the story and presentation, then this is a perfectly serviceable game - if you can get it cheap.  But, even for fans of this developer, this game is not worth full price.

But it's still an AM game, which means that it is a well made HOG game that fans of the genre will appreciate.

As for gameplay, most locations are limited to two or three screens with at most two puzzles. The collection style puzzles are extremely simple. The HOG puzzles make up for it with the standard AM detail though.

This game is one of the older Artifex Mundi games, and it might be more to the fans of either the company or at least for fans of hidden object games. The graphics aren't quite up to the standard you might have in mind when you hear the name Artifex Mundi. Also you might be surprised by the story and the jumble of the same. 

The HOGs are on a higher end scale of difficulty, the minigames inside have simple to difficult setting. All in all it's not the fare you might expect from an Artifex Mundi game. This said the game is not up to the general standard, at least at my computer it crashes quite regulary on the endgame. The story also is not the general standard of Artifex Mundis games, but that might be reasonable given that during the last years Artifex Mundi has done a lot to evolve the genre. 

I give a conditional recomendation: If you have other games of the Triology this might be a nice to have game, don't buy it just to try out the genre, it might get you on the wrong foot. For fans of the genre this is also a nice to have, not an requirement. Never forget that hidden object games are casual games, that means they can be played for a nice intermezzo during a break, or as a productivity relieve tool. This game might not be the perfect game, neither it is one of the best games I ever encountered - but it also isn't a lemon at all, just something in between...

今作はタイムミステリーシリーズの1にあたります
2と3が先にSteam配信されていますがプレイしていなくてもストーリー上は問題ないです
元々は2010年のゲームだったものをHDリマスターした物のようです

・良かった所
パズル要素多め
美しい画像での間違い探し

・悪かった所
拠点から時間旅行→パズル→重要アイテムGET→間違い探し→時間旅行…と反復が多い為、マンネリを感じる
アイテム探しミニゲームが苦手な人への救済策の代わりのミニゲーム（落ちゲー）が余計に時間がかかってイライラする
実績少なめ
ボリューム少な目
プロモーションムービーでコッソリネタバレしている

別の方が書いていたミニゲーム（魔法板）のバグは解消されているので今は普通にプレイできます
既に2と3をプレイしていてこのシリーズが好きならまぁやってもいいかも？
救済策に見えるアイテム探し中のミニゲームが罠で今回実績に関係しないので出来れば
アイテム探し中のミニゲームはやらないほうがいいかと思います
美麗グラフィックでの間違い探しは面白かったんですが、人によっては疲れてしまうかもしれません

This game is kind of outdated. It was done with Mundi's older engine back in 2010, and is amongst their first games. It's not a bad game, but their other games outclass it by far - this is not a good game to start with because it's really rough at the edges.
I can only suggest it to players who can tolerate lousy graphics, bad voice acting, a story which- by the way fits quite well into the trilogy - weak on it's own.  It's a good example to see in what way and how HOGs (Hidden Object Games)  of Artifex Mundi changed in the past years.

Little more in-depth:
I can't value this game as other games of Mundi - because this is a really early one and based on my experience with their newer games, they improved vastly.  Take this into consideration, please - the list is more of an informative guide to the game, I don't want to bash at it.
Playing this game made me fell the same like when you go into a museum that houses some really old artifacts. They are not nice; not as sharp, as new, as fancy, as decorated or even as detailed as the new ones. Facing facts: they are worse. But it's intresting to see that this existed,  and this is how something started.

For example the facial gestures are - no better word - creepy. I think they were made with a technique that renders the 3D face but shows it in a 2D setting. Because meanwhile there are no strong outlines presented (They went for the realistic feeling, not the cartoonish way) it looks like you would see a person's face with a bad stereopsis. It looks really strange compared to newer HOG games but at the same time - I've never seen this animation, so it was really intresting to see a new (at least for me) way of presentation.
Voice acting sadly was really lacking - at lots of points I had a feeling that a program read out the lines, not even a living person :\
The game's system and the order of objectives are also really rudimentary. For example you arrive to a monastery and immediately pops up an objective: get medicine for the priest you haven't even talked to.
And finally an aspect I'd love to see in upcoming games: really creative hidden object scenes and puzzles. I've had to find items in paitings, rock-carvings, murals, even roseglasses.  There was also two puzzles when you had to solve a tangram-puzzle and two when you had to slide boxes to get one bigger box out of the grid.  I really do hope at least the tangram ones will come up again in never games :)
Probably you realized at this point if you want this game or not. If haven't - I'm sure it was a great HOG in it's time, but in today's standards, it's rough - like the rock in the ocean that will turn into a round pebble with enough time.
I felt that I have to give a negative recommendations because this game is a nieche one - I could only recommend it for comitted hidden object gamers, most of other, new gamers to the genre would felt cheated if they would buy this game on my recommendation.",1425225238,1425244665,False,62,2,0.834898173809051514,7,False,False,False,False,,,

Damit sage ich nicht, das Spiel sei schlecht, aber ich kann es - angesichts der Konkurrenz auch aus dem eigenen Hause Artifex Mundi - nur Sammlern empfehlen, die auch schon die Folgeteile gespielt haben und das Trio vollständig haben wollen. (Wobei meines Wissens der einzige innere Konnex nur die Familie Ambrose ist, nicht die Figuren oder Handlung)

Ich habe den Eindruck, als sei ein 'altes' Spiel nur halbherzig aufpoliert worden, um Steam-tauglich zu werden. Es fühlt sich aber ganz und gar nicht wie eine Neuveröffentlichung an und ist graphisch nicht auf dem Level aktueller Releases von Artifex Mundi. Vielmehr spielt es sich -und sieht auch ein bisschen so aus- wie ein Wimmelbild-Spiel, das in einer Compilation beim Discounter oder in einem Elektromarkt verscherbelt wird.

Die Wimmelbilder sind zum Teil etwas unfair, dafür sind die Minispiele (selbst für jemanden wie mich, der in anderen Spielen häufig ""auflösen"" lassen muss) sehr einfach. Über Mastermind, Rösselsprung, Anordnung von Zutaten nach Rezept, Finde-sieben-Unterschiede und ein Murmelbahn-Spiel ging es bislang nicht hinaus. Über ein simples Nebeneinander von Wimmelbild- und Minispiel, etwa in die Richtung echter Adventure-Problemstellungen, wie sie sich beim Thema Zeitreise anbieten würden und wie sie aktuelle Releases von Artifex Mundi bieten, kommt dieser Teil nicht heraus: jede Zeitzone besteht aus zwei bis drei Räumen, ein eingesammelter Gegenstand kann sofort eingesetzt werden, und ab geht es in die ""Zentrale"", wo man sich (wieder in zwei Räumen) auf die nächste Zeitzone vorbereitet. Erst den gerade erworbenen Ring in die Maschine geben, dann Gegenstände der betreffenden Zeit suchen, aktivieren ... und weiter.

Graphisch macht ""T.M. - Das Erbe"" einen durchwachsenen Eindruck. Positiv möchte ich hervorheben, dass es erfrischend ist, sich ""historische"" Gemälde oder Gobelins zu durchsuchen. Was freilich gleich wieder den Nachteil hat, dass die Macher leicht unfair werden mussten, indem sie in diesen historischen Bildern an unmöglichen oder unlogischen Stellen die zu suchenden Gegenstände mehr verhehlen als verstecken.
Die in der Ur-Version sicher statischen Dialog-Szenen wurden (nicht sehr sorgfältig) animiert, was objetiv SCHLIMMER aussieht als wenn man sie starr gelassen hätte, da nur eine Art Verzerrungsfilter über die Gesichter gelegt wird. Es sieht weniger nach einem Gesicht in einem Gespräch aus und mehr nach einem Gesicht, das auf einen Luftballon gemalt wurde, welcher dann ein wenig verformt, geknetet und gestaucht wird.

Als letzten Kritikpunkt (und hier bin ich wahrscheinlich ein bisschen päpstlicher als der Papst) möchte ich auf die vielen Anachronismen hinweisen, die gerade in einem Spiel, das sich so intensiv mit den verschiedenen Zeitebenen befasst, nicht wirklich vorkommen dürfen. Dabei spreche ich nicht von Gegenständen, die es in der entsprechenden Zeit (... so...) nicht geben kann (was allenfalls damit zu erklären wäre, dass man ja einem Mann hinterher jagt, der ebenfalls durch die Zeit reist und ggf. Sachen hinterliess), sondern mit echten Anachronismen wie *völlig* falscher Musik oder Erfindungen, die damals noch nicht gemacht wurden.",1425219507,1425220415,False,7,0,0.582959115505218506,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's true that I was missing something when I played the sequels. And at least, I get more time travelling here, even if it's each time two scenes. The HOG scenes are more present, a testimony from the transition from pure HOG like it was years ago to a more complex game. And the soundtrack is really good, fitting each era.

While I loved the game, I just disappointed in the animation of the faces. It wasn't feeling natural. Sir Bodwin particularly was kinda... how to tell... weird.
