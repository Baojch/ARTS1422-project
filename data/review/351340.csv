This one has a Mary Shelley's Frankenstein theme as you take on the role of a re-animated woman with amnesia who must piece together what happened to her by picking up oddly strewn journal pages from various characters associated with this incredibly short murder mystery.

I guess one of the key rules of Steam that a lot of developers really don't consider is that your game really has to have more content than 2 hours worth, so gamers can't just buy your game, finish it and then refund it.  I'm not at all advocating anyone does this, but developers really need to provide more value to gamers to prevent such thoughts from even crossing gamers minds.  Especially considering the price of this game, because you can knock this out in about half an hour... and the content you could get 100% from by just watching a YouTube playthrough.  So why bother paying for this?  It's just a terrible business model. 

I won't spoil the plot, it's nothing remarkable.  The artwork is okay but mostly static stuff with some very rigid, clunky animation.  The voice acting is really mediocre.  The puzzles and gameplay are very simple, shallow and uninteresting. This is no Monkey Island. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game features mostly static, barely animated 2D images, the kind of thing you expect to see in browser/flash games.  While the artwork itself, while mediocre, might be considered passable, the visual presentation here is negligible, it might as well be a slideshow or a Youtube video.  Pac-Man, Space Invaders and Asteroids had more advanced animation and visuals going on than this game does.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Belladonna has the farcical price of around $7 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  For comparison, the $7 asking price for this game could get you games like ""Ark: Survival Evolved"", ""DOOM"" or ""Mass Effect 2"".  Quality, professionally made games like those are frequently on sale cheaper than this.  There's also thousands of free, superior quality games on Steam.",1710076073,1710121067,False,2,3,0.168219923973083496,0,False,False,False,True,,,

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happineass of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Also, in this day and age, relying solely on a ""forbidden love"" storyline isn't sufficient for an entire plot.

A helpful suggestion for the creator: Implementing a double-click feature for doors would significantly enhance gameplay, allowing instant passage instead of repeatedly traversing the halls slowly.

В одном небольшом городке была популярна история о дворянской семье, которую погубила трагедия. Однажды в эти места приехал знаменитый доктор по имени Вольфрам фон Трауэршлосс вместе со своей семьей. Здесь он надеялся обрести душевное равновесие и сделать парочку научных открытий, но ему была уготована совсем другая судьба. Некоторое время у молодоженов была идиллия, которую они тщательно прятали от общественности, но в один момент их семейное счастье пошло под откос. Их маленький сын умирает, а супруги теряют интерес к друг другу. Доктор Вольфрам запирается в подвале, откуда инонда слышны взвизги нечеловеческой природы, а его молодая и прекрасная жена по имени Белладонна становится затворницей в шикарном особняке. Вся прислуга была распущена и девушка прикипела к единственной оставшейся служанке - Кларе. Некоторое время они проводили время вместе, пока в дом не вернулся доктор Вольфрам. Из под его заляпанных кровью очков на девушек глядел монстр с горящими глазами, который практически потерял свой человеческий облик. Открыв для себя запретные знания, известный доктор Вольфрам извлек из них все самое необходимое для своего нового открытия. Пока Белладонна проводила свои будни в праздности и скуке, бывший доктор нашел способ как победить смерть.

Игра начинается с того момента, как из под грязного полотнища на холодном столе морга показывается бледная изуродованная женщина.

[hr][/hr][h3]What I disliked about the game[/h3][hr][/hr]
The stuff this undead woman says sounds like something a 15 year old girl says to sound cool, edgy and philosophical, while in reality it's just random nonsense. 

[b][i]""Imagine a library with a book for every possible arrangement of letters.""[/i][/b]

Who walks into a library and thinks about that the instant they see a bookshelf. It's a library, get over it. I am very philosophical, and I like dark and obscure shit, but I do not walk up to some object and think. [i]""Damn, am I an object? No, I object to the mere thought!""[/i]

This game makes me picture some girl who likes playing with those zombie dolls and dresses up like a goth to stand out and be different while wondering why people call her a weirdo. Then her parents try to help her, so she stamps into her bedroom, puts on some Death metal and cries herself to sleep without taking her medication.

Also there's the cliche of cats loving milk. A kitten has to drink milk to survive. An adult cat is lactose intolerant and drinking too much milk would cause health issues. Sure, you end up killing the cat (I don't know why), but the game still promotes the problematic idea of giving cats milk. 
[hr][/hr]
[b]So that's what I didn't like out of the way[/b]

The game is easier than a lot of point and click games (which is a good thing, although this game still requires you to do some things that aren't obvious). The story is okay and the voice acting sounds alright, albeit it sounds a bit younger than the character they are voicing. I just don't like a few strange statements that are made by both undead women and it creates a vibe for me that I dislike. I think the game had some effort put into it and it's a short experience that Im sure a lot of people would enjoy.

[h1] Story [/h1] Wir spielen eine gerade zum Leben erweckte Menschliche Puppe (so sieht sie jedenfalls aus) und sind in einem Labor ohne Erinnerungen. Wir wollen jetzt herausfinden wer wir sind und warum wir hier sind

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Gleich vorweg, man hat das Spiel nach gut 1 Stunde durchgespielt aber um an die Sammelkarten zu kommen, muss man es 3-4 Stunden anlassen. Das Spiel hat mich sofort an Mary Shellys Frankenstein erinnert worauf das Spiel wohl auch leicht basiert. Es spielt sich wie ein klassisches Point & Click Adventure wie man es kennt. Wir klicken uns durch die Gegend und interagieren mit verschiedenen Gegenständen in der Spielwelt um Kommentare bzw. Informationen von unserem Charakter zu bekommen. Wir sammeln auch einige Gegenstände auf um diese dann, mit anderen Gegenständen im Inventar zu kombinieren um sie dann wieder irgendwo in der Spielwelt verwenden zu können. Die Rätsel sind allesamt sehr simpel gehalten. Die Story wird durch Handgeschriebene Zettel in der Spielwelt erzählt. Story & Atmosphäre sind gut und auch der Grafik Stil ist Fantastisch. Musik ist ebenfalls ganz ok

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Gute Story
+ Gute Atmosphäre
+ Guter Grafik Stil
+ Musik OK
+ Kurz (für das was die Story bzw. das Spiel erzählt ist es völlig ausreichend)
+ Sammelkarten

- Leider keine Achievements

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein gut gelungenes, kurzes Point & Click Adventure mit einer guten Story, toller Atmosphäre & einem gelungenem Grafik Stil. Es ist zwar kurz aber meiner Meinung nach völlig ausreichend für das was das Spiel an Story erzählt. Ich kann es jedem Fan des Genres sehr Empfehlen wenn einem viel lesen nichts ausmacht, aber ich würde doch eher im Sale zuschlagen

Wer bin ich, wo bin ich und vor allem was bin ich?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929716555

Um dies zu klären begeben wir uns in diesem klassischem Point´n´Click auf eine teils sehr morbide Reise. Wir bewegen uns durch ein Anwesen und sammeln, kombinieren und wenden alles Mögliche an. Dabei sind die Rätsel sehr einfach und die Lösungen werden teils sogar von der sehr gut gesprochenen Protagonistin angedeutet. Die Grafik war sehr passend zum Spiel, gleichzeitig schön und schaurig. Für Kinder ist es aber keinesfalls geeignet, da hier relativ viel grausames passiert, was verstörend wirken kann. Unter anderem muss hier eine Katze vergiftet werden. Es wundert mich, dass sich deswegen bisher noch keiner beschwert hat, die Leute beschweren sich Heutzutage auch über alles. 
Unterwegs finden wir noch viele Notizen, die uns die Geschichte drumherum noch genauer erzählen. 
Leider ist das Spiel nur auf Englisch verfügbar, schade eigentlich. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929716704

Auch die Länge des Spiels ist sehr überschaubar. Nach etwa einer Stunde ist das ganze auch schon vorbei. Daher würde ich hier raten, mit dem Kauf bis zum Sale zu warten, da der normale Preis etwas hoch angesetzt ist. 
Ansonsten eine sehr interessante, recht morbide Reise. Wer Englisch beherrscht, sollte sich das bei Gelegenheit mal anschauen.

เกมผจญภัยแนว point and click ขนาดสั้น (โคตรสั้น) สุดน่าเบื่อ ที่เน้นอ่านบันทึกยาวเหยียดมากกว่าที่จะเน้นแก้ปริศนาตามทาง แถมยังลากยาวแบบนี้ตลอดทั้งเกม (เอ็งหาวิธีเล่าที่ดีกว่านี้ไม่ได้แล้วเรอะ?) เรื่องราวเกี่ยวกับมนุษย์ดัดแปลงสาวคนหนึ่ง ได้ฟื้นขึ้นมาในห้องทดลอง พร้อมกับความทรงจำที่หายไป และเครื่องจักรที่เสียบอยู่บนหัว จึงเป็นหน้าที่ของเธอที่จะต้องค้นหาอดีตของตัวเองให้พบ ธีมหลักๆของเกมก็จะเกี่ยวกับ โศกนาฏกรรมความรักในเชิงกักขังหน่วงเหนี่ยว ต้องทำทุกวิถีทางเพื่อให้ได้มันมา ไม่เว้นแม้กระทั่งต้องฆ่าศัตรูหัวใจให้พ้นทาง

ถ้าได้อ่านบันทึกที่กระจายโจ่งแจ้งอยู่ตามฉาก (ซึ่งใช้ประโยคเชิงพรรณนาซะส่วนมาก) ก็จะรู้ว่า เป็นเรื่องราวเกี่ยวกับคู่รักคู่หนึ่งที่สูญเสียลูกชายไป จนสามีพยายามโหมงานอย่างหนัก มัวแต่ทำการทดลองเพื่อให้ลูกชายฟื้นคืนชีพขึ้นมา จนไม่ได้สนใจเมียตัวเอง โชคดีที่มีสาวรับใช้คนหนึ่ง คอยอยู่เคียงข้างฝ่ายเมียในวันที่เปลี่ยวเหงา ทำให้ทั้งสองตกลงปลงใจคบชู้กัน หลังจากนั้นได้ไม่นาน ฝ่ายสามีจับได้และเสียใจเป็นอย่างมาก จึงพยายามจะทวงเมียของตัวเองคืน โดยการแอบวางยาพิษให้คนใช้ดื่ม จนคนใช้ตาย พอฝ่ายเมียพบศพ ก็โศกเศร้า คิดถึงแต่คนใช้อยู่ตลอด ฝ่ายสามี พอรู้ว่าไม่สามารถทวงรักเก่ากลับคืนมาได้ ก็เลยวางยาเมียตัวเองตายอีกคน แล้วจับเมียทำมนุษย์ดัดแปลงให้เชื่อฟังคำสั่งตัวเองทุกอย่าง แม้กระทั่งความรัก 

พอเล่นไปเรื่อยๆ แล้วเราก็จะได้รู้ความจริงในภายหลังว่า ตัวละครผู้หญิงหัวล้านที่เราบังคับตลอดทั้งเกมนั้น แท้จริงแล้วคือสาวใช้ที่ฝ่ายเมียคบชู้ด้วยนั่นเอง ซึ่งถูกชุบชีวิตขึ้นโดยเมียของนักวิทยาศาสตร์ที่ชื่อ เบลลาดอนน่า และกลับมาในคราวนี้ เธอต้องการที่จะแก้แค้นฆ่าสามีตัวเอง และสร้างโลกใบใหม่ที่เต็มไปด้วยแฟรงเก้นสไตน์ที่มีชีวิตดังเช่นตัวเธอในคฤหาสน์หลังใหญ่นี้ ด้วยซากศพที่อยู่ในสุสาน เนื้อเรื่องไม่เน้นแหวะ แต่เน้นหลอน จะรอซื้อตอนลดราคามาเล่นก็ได้ แล้วแต่",1661237870,1662077171,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I love the overall story and think this game is worth it. The atmosphere, breathtaking. The music, enchanting. The voice acting for our protagonist, flawless. The animation, unique. I would love to see more animation of the like.

Quelques interactions et aller/retours sont à prévoir également mais il n'y a pas d'énigmes retorses ou de casse-têtes qui viendront vous compliquer la tâche. 
Ainsi le jeu se parcourt et se termine en 1 heure environ et il n'y a pas de succès à débloquer.

Le scénario est macabre et intrigant, il relate plusieurs thèmes, et revisite un vieux classique dont je tairais le titre... Par contre la fin peut paraître très abrupte, voire médiocre pour certains, on aurait aimé une suite ou quelque chose de plus étayé.

[h1]Solo recomendable para Halloween[/h1]
Belladonna es un juego que he estado bastante tentado de ponerle un “No Recomendado” porque como tal el juego adolece de bastantes limitaciones, aunque bien es cierto que no hace nada mal como tal, así que al final he optado por el “Recomendado”, aunque con matices.

Tienes que saber que este juego es extremadamente corto, dura una hora, con una dificultad totalmente inexistente y con un argumento bastante previsible que deja entrever cierta ideología muy en boga que tira un poco para atrás. Ya, es una sorpresa, para mí también lo fue.

Pero dejando eso de lado, el juego es bastante bonito y para lo que dura, que es nada, puede ofrecer un divertimento moderado en Halloween. Es decir, si llega Halloween y quieres jugar un juego con temática de muertos o similar y no tienes mucho tiempo, pues Belladonna es el juego que buscas. Y ya está. Realmente no hay mucho más que decir. 

No te preocupes si no se te dan bien las aventuras gráficas porque este juego presenta unos puzles que están planteados de tal manera que ni siquiera pueden llamarse como tal. Por ejemplo, hay una puerta cerrada y ves unas llaves. Pues eso, ya estás tardando.

Además, iremos recogiendo diversos escritos que serán los encargados de contarnos la historia, la cual al principio está curiosa, luego es escabrosa y luego levantas una ceja y dices: “Ah, amigo, ya veo por dónde vas. Vete a vender tu basura a otro, haz el favor.” Pero bueno, eso será al final, por lo que realmente estaremos entretenidos unos 45 minutos sin que nos llenen la almendra con estupideces metidas con calzador y que no vienen a cuento.

El juego como tal nunca salió oficialmente en español, pero si sigues el enlace arriba indicado podrás instalar una traducción para poder entender perfectamente la historia. Algo que es muy de agradecer, por supuesto.

Así que ya sabes, si quieres un juego escabroso para jugar en Halloween y que dure muy poco, Belladonna es una opción. En caso contrario, pasa totalmente de él porque salvo en su aspecto gráfico y sonoro, en todo lo demás es bastante mediocre. Sea como sea, carne de bundle.",1653149339,1653149339,True,8,0,0.623639225959777832,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Belladonna is a 2D Point & Click game, about someone who has been brought back from the dead like the novel ‘Frankenstein’.

In the game items are simple to find, everything stands out and there are not many items that you can interact with that don’t have a purpose. Only thing I recommend is checking the entire rooms, some rooms can scroll for further area.

Belladonna is mainly narrative focus, though most of the story comes about through the notes laying around the manor, there is a lot of text that needs to be read to understand everything that is going on. The story itself is interesting though nothing amazing, and most players will be able to work out the story early on.
The game is short should you not take the time to read all of the notes, in my video the notes make up most of the recording time.

Overall the game has an interesting story, the puzzles were simple, you just find all of the items in the map.
If you want to look at some gameplay, I will leave my video below:

Игра совсем короткая, анимации дубовые, загадок мало и они простые, локаций тоже кот наплакал. Зато плюс: в игре есть кот. И озвучка диалогов даже. Но большая часть сюжета втиснута текстом в очень длинных записках. Интересно не было.

L'atmosfera e la storia mi hanno preso molto, così come anche la protagonista. Quest'ultima è un essere artificiale che vaga per l'avventura a dipanare i fili di una storia misteriosa nonchè macabra. Questo personaggio, che per ragioni di non svelare il finale non dico chi è, mi ha veramente colpito per il suo carattere che la porta a fare commenti del tutto particolari ed anche inaspettati; forse è la parte migliore del gioco, uno sforzo dell'autore a delineare un personaggio che guarda la realtà quasi come da sopra un vetrino da laboratorio, distaccata come se esaminasse dei strani batteri. Ed un altro colpo dell'autore è che è perfettamente in tema con la storia e l'atmosfera dell'avventura.  Gli enigmi sono tali che se qualcuno usa le soluzioni per risolverli viene portato a frequentare i bambini di tre anni: per imparare da loro. La storia, se fosse stata sviluppata con maggiore ricchezza di particolari riguardanti i temi di rilievo che introduce solo marginalmente, magari con scene di intermezzo, introspezione dei personaggi, ecc,  sarebbe stata veramente dirompente, da penetrare e scuotere i sentimenti del giocatore. Invece tutto rimane interrotto: come quei ponti italiani che vediamo costruiti nel nulla e che finiscono improvvisanente nel nulla, inutili.

Good visuals, and the way that reanimation of the dead is presented fits the game very well thematically.

Much time is spent reading, well written, if somewhat hard to read (visually), notes from characters that do a good job describing how characters are feeling and what they believe other characters are thinking. I'm not sure why you are able to find some of these notes scattered on the ground throughout the environment you explore, all characters mention keeping the notes hidden and secret.

The game has no real puzzles and it is a very short game that should take around an hour to complete. I feel like it would have made a better visual novel as the same visual style could have been given to the house and characters, the short cutscenes could still have been used, it would fit the style of not having puzzles better, and would have been an easy way to make the text that you spend most of your time reading easier to see for people that will have trouble reading it the way they are presented.

Настолько нелепо выглядит образ главной героини. Не то киборг, не то инопланетянка, не то модница из будущего. Как же я был рад, что первое впечатление оказалось обманчивым.

Красавка - короткая адвенчура на час. Но построенная так, что воспринимается как гибрид симулятора ходьбы, побега из комнаты и даже интерактивной литературы. Всё из-за особенностей сюжета.

Игроку рассказывают классическую историю ужасов. На манер известного романа Мэри Шелли, написанного в год без лета. Героиня осознаёт себя в подвале некого замка и не понимает кто или что она. Воскрешённый мертвец или искусственный человек или что-то доселе неведомое. В поисках ответов она проходит сквозь обилие запертых дверей. По пути ей встречаются страницы из дневников трёх, живших в замке, людей. Каждый описывает, произошедшие в помещении, трагедии со своей точки зрения. Эти записки читаются как полноценный рассказ, который складывается в единую картину. И личность героини становится ясной игроку ещё до того, как станет понятной ей.

Игровой процесс достаточно прост. Подсветки активных точек нет. Но все предметы либо на виду, либо в шаговой доступности. Их применение интуитивно, а для не догадливых героиня проговорит подсказку вслух. Лично у меня был небольшой страх, что будет возможность покинуть замок и не осмотреть его полностью, не прочесть всю историю. Но игра линейная, даже концовка в ней всего одна. Хотя возмущение против финала так и напрашивается, но героиня не бунтарка.

Есть небольшие технические огрехи. Нажимаешь кнопку, чтобы пропустить монолог, субтитры уже исчезли, а речь продолжает звучать, приходится кликать ещё раз. Если попытаться использовать пилу на палку, то субтитры комментария по этому поводу не появляются. Инвентарь накладывается поверх комнаты, поэтому можно вместо выбора предмета отправить героиню идти в нижний левый угол экрана. Почему-то молоко можно использовать на миску, а наоборот нет. Это же банальное совмещение предметов, а не строгая последовательность.

Не понравилось всего два момента. Акцент на лесбийских отношениях. Почему они не могли быть просто подругами? И разъяснение возможности секса между чудовищами Франкештейна. Серьёзно, зачем? Но сама идея создавать Тик-токов из Страны Оз забавная.

Беладонна именно что классические ужасы, которые не пугают, а завораживают атмосферой, будоражат сознание. Игра больше для читателей, нежели игроков.

P.S. Почему-то у игры нет официальной локализации, но есть очень хороший фанатский перевод.",1644615826,1644618335,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[h1]Good things:[/h1] 

This game is a short and very dark point and click game. The more notes you find and the more you read the more evil this world looks. The good thing was how the zombies were created as that is a good idea for some other games. Graphic and voice acting was also one of the good things about this game.

[h1]Bad things:[/h1] 

I just think this game is short and feels more like an intro to a much larger story. Or like this game is just here to get us into this world and be an intro to some other more complex game in the presented world but sadly no more games were released in this world. The more clues and notes I found about what happened the more I despised everyone involved and in the end I even despised the heroine we play as.

Gameplay is super simple and you just click on all things you can as you will need 80% of these that you can click on and the rest are just flavor text. You can finish the game in one hour but you have to play for about 4.5 hours to get all cards so after you finish the game you are just forced to idle it just to clear it from your list of games finished.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1] 

All you need is one hour to learn the whole story and finish the game.

Definitely not a bad game, but throughout the whole playtime felt like a demo of a larger, more complex game and story.

You basically pick up journal pages from various people and that's the only way for you to experience the story. If you are the skip-all-reading type of player, you will not understand a thing.

It is about an hour long (reading included) with very basic and typical point-and-click item interactions. It is decently enough fully voice acted, with great visuals and an awesome setting. The soundtrack is pretty mediocre, but no too bad.

Again, I want to stretch that it is not a bad game. But the story and especially the gameplay are too superficial and lacking. I would just love to play the full version of it.

It could easily be a 7/10, but now it's just an attempt of an indie developer that shows what they are capable of. As a game sold for a (rather small) price, this is a 4/10.

An this is why it's not recommended. If it was free, it would definitely be worthy a try, but still, you wouldn't miss anything skipping on it.

La séquence de fin, qui n’est en vérité qu’une illustration représentant Belladonna surmontant une foule de morts-vivants comme elle, a des allures de la “Liberté guidant le Peuple” d’Eugène Delacroix. Ce final presque guerrier laisse un goût amer dans la bouche en plus de la sensation d’un raccourci scénaristique en total désaccord avec les journaux intimes décrivant une histoire pourtant sensible et tragique.

Belladonna est un jeu d’aventure plein de bonnes idées, avec une direction artistique vraiment top mais bien trop court (et trop facile) pour arriver à développer la moindre de ses thématiques efficacement. Il aurait été plus judicieux de délaisser les énigmes classiques du genre pour se concentrer sur de la narration pure à l’image des productions Telltale. Peut-être ainsi cette histoire où un couple hors des conventions cherche à se créer une place dans un monde qui ne voudrait pas de lui, aurait pu offrir un dénouement un peu plus satisfaisant et surtout moins à côté de la plaque. >> 12/20",1616419258,1616419258,True,3,0,0.570815443992614746,2,False,False,False,False,,,

The story is interesting but feels incomplete.  Overall, it was an okay game.  Not a bad way to spend 1-2 hours but also, nothing overly thrilling.

It's a Gothic horror style story based largely on Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein'.  It does spend a good deal of it's time (keep in mind it's pretty short) on playing with the themes of loss, grief, death, life, having a soul, good and evil.  It also has murder, forms of slavery, jealousy, and a love triangle involving a lesbian romance.  It tried to tackle an awful lot in it's short run.  I think that in order to do so effectively it probably should have been a longer game more fully exploring those aspects in more depth or it maybe should have pared down some of the themes and concepts to give more time to the ones that they really wanted to focus on in this game.

The story is revealed relatively slowly so that you get bits and pieces of the story each time you progress to a new area.  The do this with the discovery of journal pages but it can involve a lot of reading.  While I generally prefer to receive game information in smaller chunks the format does sort of make sense in the way they are telling the story but it may have been nice if these discoveries could have instead triggered a flashback, been told through cut scenes, or even been discovered in other ways besides just journal entries.  The story is pretty predictable once you have a few pages, the biggest twist is probably that the lover is woman instead of a man and that's not particularly hard to guess either.

In some ways this story has elements that remind me of Anna's Quest or of Edna & Harvey in that the protagonist is sort of sweet and innocent but also seems ambivalent or oblivious to any bad things they do.  For example part of the game is killing a cat which the character actually seems to think back on in retrospect wondering if it's actually worrisome that she didn't seem to mind or care about killing it.  This is supposed to be a big part of presenting the good or evil nature of the reanimated and whether or not they have a soul and if it even matters.  I will say that while the overall story is withing the horror genre there's nothing that should really scare you too much.  There is a moment when walking to the other side of the room that you discover the cat and I wasn't expecting that so it did give me a little jump scare but nothing should truly shock or horrify you if you go into this expecting a Frankenstein style story.

The voice acting quality was decent and actually was fairly well recorded with the exception of some minor issues with volume.  However, the voices seemed out o place to me personally.  It just didn't feel like they went with the character.  Sometimes, they grow on you (like Michael in Dead Synchronicity, his voice seemed wrong for the character to me but eventually after playing a while sat fine) but these ones continued to feel somehow out of place.  Perhaps because it was almost trying to be a period Gothic piece in which case the voices sounded too out of time and place or they just didn't match the actual personalities I perceived from the characters.  It's a bit subjective of course but, to me they were just off not that the voice acting itself was bad.  The dialogue was a little awkward  a few times but, mostly well written.

The graphics are actually pretty nice and the sprites have a good design.  Walk paths are good, but there are some oddities such as when walking up the steps to the clock you aren't exactly on the ground it can actually appear as though your floating over it at the top of the steps.  The backgrounds have some nice Gothic elements but, sometimes feel a little uneven with some feeling much more ornate and detailed with others feeling a bit too sparse.

Game play mechanics are pretty straightforward.  There's a simple inventory where you can view what you've collected and you click on the item to select it then click on an active hot spot to use it.  There's no shortcut such as pushing the space bar to find all the hot spots on the screen but a title will pop up when you mouse over a hotspot.  So some amount of pixel hunting is required but, not much.  Pretty much all o the solutions to gather items and use them are fairly simple and logical to discover.  There is no quick walk or fast travel to jump to the next scene so you do have to wait for the sprite to walk the entire scene.  Not a huge deal as it doesn't take long but still would have preferred the option.  The menu interface is minimal.  Clicking on the book in the bottom left will open a menu that shows your found journal pages.  Pressing esc allows you to exit the game or continue.  The game saves your progress manually, so while you can load game, there isn't exactly a manual save.  There are no options for adjusting sounds or anything just 'Load Game', 'New Game', and 'Quit'.  

I did encounter an error when in the lab with Belladonna where she was blinking in and out of the scene and there was no audio.  When I went to pull the switch on the machine, it went black and then just seemed unresponsive.  I though maybe it was an abrupt ending but it didn't show an end scene or bring me back to a menu or anything.  I let it sit a for several minutes but that do anything either.  I forced the game closed and reopened it and it had me back to just before I pulled the switch and now Belladonna was not flashing and the audio was fine.  The ending was abrupt and did end there but there is a final end scene of Belladonna lording over her undead army.

This game unfortunately doesn't have any achievements  but it does have STEAM trading cards.  Interestingly enough it has a lot of them especially for a game of it's size.  There are 13 cards and 7 drops.  Unfortunately this means you will finish the game before the cards drop so you will either have to play multiple times or allow the game to side open and idle on your computer while waiting for the rest of the drops.  This game took me  a little over an hour to play I'll be generous and say 1.5 hours.  1.8 was my finally tally at the time of starting this review (don't forget it sat idle with it's glitch for a while, and I didn't time that)  During that time I had received 3 cards.  I had to let it sit open quite a while to get the others to finish dropping.  That's a bit poorly designed.  Partly on the developer for making so many cards to atach to their work knowing it was short and partly on steam because their card drop rates are standard but should perhaps be set to an algorithm that measures actual played time to completion to allow a better drop rate during actual game lay and avoid these types of situations.

This game's full price at around $7 is too high in my opinion for what you get. It comes out to about $3.50-$4.67/hr of gameplay.  While it may not be super expensive this game just didn't offer anything extra special that would make it seem worth it at that price.  I received this for free as a gift from a friend on steam and so I didn't actually pay anything for it but, I would have been disappointed had I paid full price.  However, this game does frequently go on sale for $1 or less so if you see it on sale I'd say it could be worth the price if your into Gothic Horror or Point & Click / Adventure games in general.  It's not likely to be on anyone's top 10 games lists but it's entertaining enough to enjoy playing for an hour or two.",1610413191,1610413191,True,7,0,0.611148536205291748,0,False,True,False,False,,,

When I got to the point where the game requires you to kill a cat, though, that was game over. This is an absolute deal breaker for me, and the game isn't piquing enough interest to consider going against my instincts in order to proceed, so I won't be finishing.

I was expecting a spooky, gothic steampunk sort of tale about a girl rediscovering herself after she died. I got none of that. 

The writing is completely in your face. There's no build up, no suspense, you're immediately thrown into paragraphs of text on journal pages that are strewn about the castle for no apparent reason. The main and only real plot twist becomes apparent about halfway through the game so it's no surprise whatsoever when the reveal finally happens. Everything else that is revealed was completely expected based on the crazily detailed journal entries. Several promising threads are explored, but nothing is ever fleshed out with them and the one time right at the end where I was actually intrigued to see what a character had to say, they change their mind and abandon the train of thought completely. 

There's nothing scary about this game other than the general concept of reanimated corpses and one glaringly loud horror movie sound effect that jumpscares you because it's so out of place with the rest of the audio. Nothing to peace together, nothing to solve. The gameplay is ridiculously self-explanatory. There's no challenge to be had, no puzzles to be solved. If there is something unclear, the main character will basically tell you exactly what you have to do when you use an item incorrectly. 
To top it all off, the voice acting is completely devoid of emotion (I have no clue why other reviews were praising it), and does not always match or sync up with the written words above your head. You can click all the way through to the end of the dialogue for that section and the game will still be playing the audio from the first line. 

In the game's defense, it's short, it's cheap, and it's not trying to pretend to be anything it isn't. There were promising ideas and concepts  toyed with, and I'd be interested to see if the developer has refined their skills in any future games. But as far as Belladonna, it's so unpolished that I can definitely not recommend.

I personally like reading lore in games so this wasn't an issue, though if it's not for you give this game a miss. I was however pleasantly surprised by the fact that this was a WLW spin on the classic tale of Frankenstein. 
The Puzzles are incredibly simple to complete, I honestly think my 10 year old nephew could play this full game without any help. If you're looking for a challenge this isn't it.

Beautifully designed
Short and sweet if you want something quick to play
Pro WLW
I enjoyed reading the journals and learning the lore of the world

Cons: 
The puzzles are simple
They used the same voice actress for the only two speaking characters in the game, it's obvious and distracting.
You have to kill a cat at one point, I know it's just pixels but I felt bad
The game just abruptly ends. There's no real epilogue after getting emotionally invested in the story.

Overall: If you ever see this on sale, pick it up as it is worth a look, however if it's not on sale give it a skip. I enjoyed my time with it, but I'm probably not going to play this ever again.

Notre héroïne se réveille vidée de ses souvenirs et légèrement transformée suite à des expériences pas très ""naturelles"" et nous partageons avec elle la recherche de son identité et ce pourquoi est-elle comme cela.

Si il y a peu de dialogue, vous aurez, par contre, de la lecture à faire car notre personnage trouve régulièrement des pages qui vont permettre d'en savoir plus. Et si d'aventure vous cherchiez une histoire joyeuse, vous risquez d'être déçu car Belladonna nous conte les histoires de personnages qui se sont perdus et ont tout perdu au fur et à mesure du temps.

 Le dessin lui aussi fait dans la tristesse avec des couleurs pastelles qui donne un cachet bien particulier à ce cauchemar... Avec le doublage et la musique, on a là un jeu qui se découvre avec passion mais aussi avec épouvante.

Alors, jeu ""parfait""... pas totalement... Si on parcourt les quelques scènes facilement, il y a peu d'interactions avec les décors si bien que le côté point'n'click devient anecdotique voire inexistant...

Les animations de notre personnage manque... d'animations... la voir monter les escaliers comme elle marche dans le couloir me fait avoir un petit pincement au coeur. Surtout que là, on ne parle pas d'un millier de pnj à faire bouger à l'écran... non juste un...

Il faut penser à prendre les objets bien dans le menu inventaire, si vous cliquez en haut de l'objet (hors du menu) cela ne sert à rien... une habitude à mettre de côté qui a été laborieuse pour moi.

Alors oui, j'ai vraiment aimé l'histoire, nettement moins la fin qui nous est jeté à la tête ou plutôt le dernier screen.... Une image et pouf... ça met en l'air tout le côté dark...

En tout cas, je vous invite à jouer à Belladonna et découvrir la terrible vérité qui a touché le manoir du savant Von Trauerschloss...

The story is intriguing with a good gothic style and a twist (interpretation) of Frankenstein.  I thought the story was well written with the notes and the dialogue.  The voice acting was lacking.  It was passable for such a small short story but much longer of a game and I would have muted it.

The ambient sounds and the sound effects were fine and proper for the setting.  The graphics were simple, not groundbreaking, but fit well with the gothic theme and were done well.  The controls are your usual point and click controls with an inventory system.

There are no achievements but there are trading cards.  You must let the game idle for an [u]extended[/u] period of time to get all the card drops.  You will most definitely be done with the game before all the drops have triggered.  I finished the game in about an hour.

-------------------------------------
Pros
-------------------------------------
-I really like the overall feel of this title.  It’s a weird combination of gothic horror but with a sweet and innocent protagonist. It reminds me of a Tim Burton movie.
-Strange commentary and monologue from the main character.  I like weird s*** so I found it entertaining.
-I found it funny how opening a certain door uses the EXACT same sound effect as when a friend would come online in AOL/Instant Messenger lol.

-------------------------------------
Meh.
-------------------------------------
-No save slots.  It's a very short game so it’s not a huge issue.
-Minor pixel hunting.  Again, it’s a short/small game so it was not a huge issue eventually finding a few items.
-Game story background is told by journal pages which you ""find"".  I say find loosely here as it takes zero effort to actually find them they are prominently located in each new room you travel too.  I'm not usually big on reading a lot in games but on the plus side they did keep you interested in the story.  
-Gameplay is lacking.  Puzzles are very straight forward.  Combined with the overall art style and in some cases minimal animations it feels at times like I was playing a weird mashup of a hidden object/point and click game.  (For a game with a similar feel check out Hostil)


-------------------------------------
Cons
-------------------------------------
-Had to alter the config file to get it to play in the proper resolution in Fullscreen mode.
-Very short.  Ends just as the story was getting interesting.  I'm not sure how much of this was an artistic choice versus running out of time/funding to complete the game.  
-No double click fast travel.
-Skipping dialog by clicking ends up advancing the text but the sound file for the dialogue continues to play.  This ends up just getting the two out of sync and I felt was kind of sloppy.


Final Thoughts:  As another reviewer stated this game took on many themes at once of same sex relationships, domestic abuse, and dealing with loss as well as the gothic themes of life and death and what it means to have a soul.  How well it accomplished this depends on how you look at the game as a whole.  If it was meant to be more of an art project, then I think it kind of works.  If it was meant to be a standalone adventure, I think it really would have needed to be a longer game.  You get a glimpse of what this game could have incorporated in the ending title card where you see a bunch of other character designs.  I would have enjoyed seeing a game that had expanded upon Klara and Belladonna's relationship, what their lives were like before they transformed into gothic automatons, exploring what their interactions would be like with the village beneath the castle.  Overall, I enjoyed this Tim Burton/ Mary Shelly-esque mashup and liked the stylistic choices in the game.  It would have been cool to see this be a longer game!  

I go back and forth when it comes to placing a dollar value on P&C games.  It is ultimately up to each individual to determine if they got their money’s worth from a game they played.  In this case, I paid a dollar for an hour of game play in a title that I enjoyed for its artistic merit.  Had I paid the full current asking price of $7 for that same hour I would honestly probably have been not thrilled.  That being said if you are a real P&C aficionado with a desire to support the developer, by all means.  This developer’s only other current title has a very different feel and style than this but based on what I've seen in Belladonna I hope they consider making another P&C game in the future (maybe even a sequel?!?!)

The art and design are excellent, reminding somewhat of Deadalic Entertainment's simplified  style. Usable items are also clearly drawn as distinct from their surroundings without sticking out obtrusivley, which as a rarity in adventure games. However, animations are basic to the point of looking like rough proofs. At the time of my playthrough (March 2020), there was also an embarrassing bug where the screen was completely blacked out during the game's climactic cutscene.

Puzzles lack depth, and their solutions are usually spelled out or in one case literally written on the same screen, which is a little unusual for a game that not aimed at the youngest children.

In short, there are glimpses of a solid game here, with an excellent concept and setting that could have yielded some truly disturbing romantic drama, some wild humour or challenging mechanical/biological puzzles, none of which were developed far enough in the end.

Der spielbare Teil der Geschichte hingegen ist vergleichsweise einfach und recht schnell durchgespielt, die Rätsel eindeutig und einfach lösbar.

В этой игре есть очень много положительных заделов вроде атмосферы, потенциально интересного главного персонажа, которого можно нетривиально раскрыть, или самой идеи возвращения к жизни механическим путём, заложенной в художественной литературе Мэри Шелли, но...

Во-первых, я не знаю, какого уровня должна быть игра, чтобы покупать час-полтора геймплея за полный ценник в 175 рублей. Мною она была приобретена на распродаже за 15, и, в принципе, за этот экспириенс такие деньги отдать можно, учитывая, что готика и мрачность в квестах - редкий гость. Во-вторых, с самого начала я не знал, что игра столь скоротечна, и что её сюжет разрешится настолько бездарно. И хотя сама миниатюра полна спорных моментов вроде некро-лесбийской линии и убийства кота, из-за которого бомбит у изнеженной части комьюнити, поначалу у меня возникло желание поддержать разработчика, поскольку в игре был потенциал, и я действительно хотел бы увидеть продолжение, развитие, что угодно, но побольше. Но нет, вот это всё, что было в 2015, и это всё, что есть на момент написания обзора в 2019. Таким образом, я не понимаю, чего ради рекомендовать игру, если после часа, что равняется полному её прохождению, вас ждёт полный ноль?

Возможно, я не знаю закулисной истории создания этой игры, с какой целью она создавалась, что хотели в ней выразить, но после её прохождения у меня возник вопрос ""а зачем, собственно, она вообще существует?"" Как пролог или демка полной версии она зашла бы на ура, но проблема в том, что ""фулл в сделку не входил"".

The problem is, this game is very short. The story is interesting... but the voice actors don't really sell the characters as well. The puzzles were pretty easy, they can even trip you up in their simplicity. I like the game, but it has many flaws to contend with, and for 7 bucks I just don't think the game's good points outshines its bad points.

As some one who regards Shelley's archetypal Body Horror novel as one of the definitive narratives of my life (consult the work of Karl Jung for more information on that one), then I must admit that I absolutely fell in love with ""Belladonna"", right from the moment I saw it advertised. 

Carrying the same rich character design featured in ""Monkey Island"" or ""Day of the Tentacle"", combined with the same developing in-game plot-line featured in ""Whispering Willows"", players find themselves thrust into a classically bleak Gothic environment where science and mysticism converge. Dark laboratories, shadowy hallways and the silent finality of the grave. All are presented beautifully herein through painted backdrops and faux-cell animations, suitably accompanied by a deliciously ominous and foreboding cello-centred musical score.  

Admittedly, the game isn't very scary but that is hardly a concern. Those who know the enduring legacy of Shelley's work will appreciate that a greater impact of it's influence was it's ability to adapt to the socio-politics of each period. More specifically, the presence of contemporary gender politics in the game's narrative is highly self-evident and therefore may not be received well by those of a certain persuasion. I shan't get too much into the details here but let's just say that if you're interested in gender politics, then this is definitely a game to look into. 

It's also nice to be playing a female protagonist who isn't just some damsel in distress (I hate when they do that). 

The one criticism of the game is that it is VERY short. I managed to complete ""Belladonna"" in just under a hour and a half and, while the self-contained nature of the narrative was well put together, it would have been nice for the story not to have concluded at the stage that it did (fingers crossed, therefore, for a sequel).

[b]Pros[/b]
---
- Beautiful and unique art style
- Puzzles are fairly well designed with various difficulties, but overall don't feel too hard
- Environmental/background design is really well done
- Representation for sapphic women

[b]Cons[/b]
---
- Too short, especially for the money asked at full price. It is advertised as an ""adventure"" game, but your adventure has barely begun before it's over.
- The story is a little predictable and cliche, and the best twist was revealed way too early on. [spoiler]At the start of the game you believe you are playing as the inventor's wife as you find all of these notes. It would have been nice if the game stretched that pretense on for a lot longer before you discover that you are playing as the maid.[/spoiler]
- The queer representation isn't the greatest, since one of the characters is morally corrupt, and their relationship has an uneven power dynamic.

The puzzles are easy and few and far between. Instead, the game is focused on storytelling, narrative, and visual design. There are a few cutscenes that play out nicely, and the art throughout is simply striking. In a way, [u]Belladonna[/u] is a feminist and gothic take of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. With a twist at the end. It is a visually striking title, with healthy detail in each level and color that seems to jump out from the screen.

You awaken frightened and disoriented on an experiment table. Your cognitive function seems fine, but you don't exactly feel human. A faint call to Shelley's [i]Frankenstein[/i] is heard ... and alas, as you inspect the bookcase to your side, you encounter a reference to the literature. A subtle ode. Your instincts were right. You press on and exit the laboratory basement to find yourself host to a beautiful medieval castle. As you continue the story you find that your character is intelligent and very witty. Ocassionally she'll break the fourth wall and mock the player for being unable to solve a puzzle. She's curious too. And she has a delightful trait of naming inanimate objects you inspect.

I see [u]Belladonna[/u] as a short reflection on love. Albeit a dark and twisted one. It made me think about how quickly love can bloom when you're young, but also how fast it can fade away with tragedy and neglect. Here, the husband's inability to cope with his son's death resulted in isolation. An isolation from his supposed love that swirled him deeper and deeper into necromancy. And with abuse and neglect, Belladonna, who was also grieving, found new love. Only to be destroyed by his husband's paranoina and sexist ideals of how women ought to think, behave, and act around their husbands.

[b]The one thing I did not enjoy[/b] was that you [i]had[/i] to kill a cat in order to progress. I understand it was done to develop the protagonist's existential crisis.

You'll wander in an eerie abandon castle, clicking on objects to learn about them. The game has voiceovers but there are lots of reading when you pick the journal pages, which I wished they were voiced since the character herself doesn't say much during the gameplay. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1551911545

The artwork is beautiful, even the game's logo, but there are things happened in the game that left me wondering what the developers were thinking? Even if the main character doesn't have a soul or heart, she doesn't need to kill an animal to prove it! If someone says its ok, it is just a game, but no, when you create something, it means you don't mind this kind of an abuse! And I'm totally against it.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1551909337

The soundtracks were ok, nothing special about it. And the 'forbidden love' might not be everyone's cup of tea and found the reasoning quite weak just like the ending. The puzzles were very easy, and most of them are picking something and combining it with something else to use it. There is also another downside of the game is when you click on something and the character speak, you can't stop her from speaking, she'll keep on talking until she finishes her line, even if you accidentally click on the same item again.

Pros:
+OK soundtracks.
+OK voice over.
+Good artwork.
 
Cons:
-No Steam achievements.
-Short game (Can be finished in an hour).
-No manual save.
-Lack of puzzles.
-No manual save or options for sounds.

I don't recommend it because the story is weak, short and has animal abuse for no real reason.

 Where the game comes through is the story. It took a lot of familiar tropes and sculpted them into a lovely 2 hour vignette which was actually interesting to play through. There was a pleasant level of strangeness, small but unexpected narrative elements are planted through the game and turn the classic Frankenstein story into something we haven't seen before, and it made me laugh a couple times too.

PROS
- Cool Gothic art style
- Atmospheric gameplay
- Fully voice acted if you like that sort of thing

CONS
- Very short for the price they are asking imho
- No save points, the game saves on its own but doesn't tell you when
- Puzzles were a little too easy

I like that in a game. I like my mind to be challenged. I like to see characters with flawed morals and personality that so deeply contradict my own while still being engaging and sensical. This is what true horror should be, something that unsettles and disurbs you.

The gameplay though... lol, even when it comes to point and clicks, this is minimalistic. This is not a ""fun"" game, it's a pretty (very, very pretty) game that you play as a vessel to enjoy an interesting story. I didn't expect it to be anything more than a walking simulator, gameplay-wise, so I was entirely satisfied with the gameplay. Only caveat would be that the actually walking is incredibly slow, so backtracking is a bt tedious, but the game is simple enough that it's not too much of a bother.

The game is not overly dark or gruesome but story-wise, meant to be played for mature audiences only.

The biggest knock on the game is the price tag based on the length to complete the game.  This game can be completed within a 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Other than that, the game itself is really nicely done even in its simplicity.

There are a couple of gameplay elements in this game that may be considered a negative but should be considered as a positive.  

First, this game is a point-and-click game and the player interacts with objects and items like any point-and-click game.  Things you pick up aren’t many so it’s more limited and simple compared to other games.  This is a good thing.  In other point-and-click games, sometimes picking up objects are non-sensical and applying them doesn’t relate to the story.  It’s just a means to an end in progressing the game.  Also, collecting, combining and applying random items can be a common frustration in a point-and-click game.  In Belladonna, the items collected are far and few and sometimes they make sense.  This gets rid of frustration and allows the player to stay focused on the story while being engaged with a bit of gameplay.

Secondly, constant reading can feel boring and tedious.  If you play Belladonna, there will be a lot of reading; thankfully, the reading of journals not only bring context to the story but also purpose.  The journal entries bring light to what happened and the more you read, the more you are invested to collect all entries to see how it ends.

It’s a good game and worth a try for those who enjoy point-and-click adventure games

Positives
+ Voice acting does its job; its decent but nothing special
+Art is pretty good
+Easy baby puzzles
Negatives
-Maybe its just me but I don't think that Kelena's voice actor did her justice, she sounds like a teenage girl or a child. 

-Again, its just me, but I think that Kelena's avatar should have more movements rather than walking to the side and her front. I think it would do a better feel for making her more lifelike. I noticed at times when she was distressed, there was no emotion on her face to portray it. I understand that she's a undead body but she can still have emotions, Hell even Major Makoto from Ghost in the shell had more expressions than this girl does. It wouldn't be so bad either if she had some idle animations rather than standing there and blinking.

-Character development is very rushed and can be emotionless at times. All of the characters have one or two motivations and are very linear. Especially Belladonna, after she 'awoke' she sent out to do her 'duty' and then reunite with her 'lover' but then had a crazy idea to continue the evil work her husband has done. It makes no sense for her to do that and no where in the story hints that she would. 
-The story isn't really that unique. Not much stands out other than what the characters look like.

Its a decent miniature sized experience with very light user interface, thin puzzles, and low amount of content but decent flavor, with an eye catching art style and a simple starting premisce that hooks you early.

It has about the same level of polish as you'd expect to see in something like ""The Silent Age"".

So, I'll admit to being a little biased towards anything that breathes a little life into my favorite genre (no pun intended...oh who am I trying to fool - totally intended..)

With that being said, there were a lot of things I really liked about this game:  art style, music, plot - overall atmosphere was great.  I'm hoping that they add more to this game at some point, I would totally buy some expanded DLC or a sequel.

Now...the downside: 
For the price, it is too short and very, VERY simple when it comes to puzzles.  The only reason I spent slightly over an hour on it was that I stopped to give our cat his medicine partway through; and speaking of cats I spent about 10 min trying to find an alternative solution to a puzzle involving a cat ( [spoiler] come on guys, you really didnt have to kill it [/spoiler] )....so yeah, you could probably shave a good 15-20 min off my time as far as gameplay goes.  

So overall - if you are new to the point and click genre or think you suck at puzzles this might be the ego boost you're looking for.  If you love games like this absolutely get it on sale - its a good experience but not at $7 for 30-40 minutes of gameplay.

And Developers: if you would fix the fonts in the diary entries, that would be fabulous :) I like that they are different but they really are hard to read at that size.

This is a chore to play and to top it all off, sequel-baits, which is always a big no-no.

На деле это живое доказательство того, что от игр со скидкой 90% добра не жди.

С порога нас встречает давно набившая оскомину завязка с амнезией. Героиня, забывшая даже собственное имя, черпает сведения о прошлом из разбросанных всюду страниц дневников и узнаёт о трёх персонажах – докторе Вольфраме фон Трауэршлоссе, его жене Белладонне и горничной Кларе. После смерти маленького сына супруги потеряли интерес к жизни – муж погрузился в жестокие эксперименты над животными в подвале, а жена ушла в себя. Со временем их покинули все слуги, кроме Клары, в объятиях которой и нашла утешение Белладонна. К тому времени доктора настолько захватили его жуткие эксперименты, что он почти не покидал подвала, поэтому интрижку удавалось скрывать очень долго. Когда же всё выяснилось, он отравил Клару, а с женой сделал что-то невообразимое, после чего она стала покорной внешне, но внутри у неё зрел протест. Дальнейшая история свершается на глазах игрока – ну хоть какие-то крохи оставили для интерактива.

Дневники как средство знакомства с сюжетом давно успели превратиться в клише. Пространные, почти не имеющие ценности для истории вымученные тексты поминутно вклиниваются в геймплей и разрывают только-только начавшую формироваться самостоятельную цепочку рассуждений о том, что вообще происходит в замке. Варианта два: остановиться и прочитать эту белиберду, потом с удивлением вспомнив, что всё ещё надо проходить квест, либо отложить дневник и заняться тем, что заинтересовало тебя самого, а не навязывается разработчиком. Я считаю, что преподносить сюжет подобным образом – довольно ленивое решение, поэтому оставляла всю эту писанину на потом, и скопилось её столько, что перед чтением пришлось скачать в сообществе Стима любительский русификатор, иначе я просто не смогла бы заставить себя потратить на это время. Надо отметить, что тот перевод не хуже официальных локализаций – достаточно точный, без отсебятины, иногда взгляд спотыкается о тавтологии и неправильную грамматику, но в целом картина порадовала. Переводчик даже позаботился о шрифтах – в игре они разные и вычурные, имитирующие почерк нескольких людей, и хорошо, что эта деталь осталась. А ведь так делают далеко не во всех лицензиях!

Стиль дневников имитирует красивую дворянскую речь прошлых веков, но очень неуклюже, и причины тому кроются в неказистом оригинале. Работа по облагораживанию текста дневников не доделана и смотрится неумело. Бросается в глаза то, что дневник простой служанки написан таким же языком. «Очень много всего произошло в моей жизни за последнее время, мой мозг переполнен радостью, тайнами и волнениями, и если мне удастся записать хоть толику, это было бы огромным облегчением». Максимум, что может быть написано в её дневнике, – это «Если в крации, хазяйка продалжаит мной памыкать, я болие лимение хачу уйти».

Непонятно, для аудитории какого возраста была сделана эта игра. Как квест она очень простая, ребёнок пройдёт её за полчаса, если не будет читать дневники, а разгадки к простейшим головоломкам даются заранее. Однако в ней присутствуют однополая любовь и обезглавливание – темы, не подходящие для юных геймеров.

Начнём с обезглавливания. Процесс отпиливания у трупа головы должен шокировать, но что-то не сложилось. И дело не в том, что в играх другого жанра это происходит с таким постоянством, что уже перестаёшь обращать внимание. Всегда можно подготовить читателя/зрителя/игрока к какому-то зловещему действию так, что у него чуть ли не мурашки побегут по коже, когда настанет время действовать. В «Белладонне» же всё происходит так буднично и спокойно, что голова и вовсе воспринимается как пустой сосуд для другого мозга. А мозг – как шарик в банке. Можно подумать, что так подчёркивается цинизм происходящего, но нет, просто разработчик недотянул атмосферу… сюжет… характер персонажей… да всё недотянул.

Роман хозяйки дома со служанкой забивает последний гвоздь в гроб и так хромающего сюжета. Во-первых, как ни прискорбно признавать, истории о лесбийской любви стали дурным тоном, во-вторых, нельзя раскрывать эту тему так поверхностно, словно это что-то само собой разумеющееся. Любые отношения особенны и достойны красивого и детального описания, а конкретно этот вид отношений многим в принципе не понятен, к тому же здесь у него несколько слоёв: зрелая женщина – молодая девушка, хозяйка – слуга, замужняя – свободная. Такое нельзя просто обозначить и спокойно идти дальше, мы хотим деталей, почему это началось и как развивалось. Почему нам дали именно такую пару? А ведь этого материала хватило бы на отдельную игру.

Концовка внезапна и беспощадна в своей нелепости.

Всё, что есть в «Белладонне», – это приятное визуальное оформление, но даже оно обманчиво. Локации пусты, редкие предметы на них неинтересны.

Эта игра может стать для вас большим разочарованием, а ведь в умелых руках из неё мог получиться хороший готический хоррор – с чудищами, что скрываются не в тёмных углах мрачного замка, но в душах его обитателей.

Su belladonna non c’è molto da dire, un’avventura grafica in stile gotico che risente molto della cultura gotica dell’800.
L’avventura è semplice, gli enigmi sono pochi e molto facili, il design è accattivante ed ha un buon comparto grafico, ma è troppo breve.

L’avventura dura circa un’ora, decisamente troppo poco per appassionarsi ai personaggi anche se ben caratterizzati. Inoltre il gioco lascia quasi intendere che ci sia un good ending diverso da quello che si ottiene normalmente, ma nessuno sembra averlo trovato, e probabilmente era solo una mezza idea degli sviluppatori che poi non è stata realizzata.

Il gioco è ben fatto, e lo stile gotico è pienamente azzeccato, ma dura comunque troppo poco. (Un’ora per finirlo la prima volta, dieci minuti per la seconda).

La consiglio solo se la si trova in offerta.

После прохождения игры остались двоякие чувства. Но, начнём с плюсов, пожалуй. Кратенько:

Плюсы:
+ Красивая картинка;
+ Есть русификатор;
+ Сама по себе история не плоха. Точнее её начало, то бишь замес;
+ Есть карточки; 
+ На распродаже стоит 16 деревянных.

Минусы: 
- Текс писем на руссификаторе сложночитаемый;
- Концовка совсем не очень (имхо имхо имхо);
- Слишком лёгкие загадки; 
- Пол часа на прохождение;
- Мини-игр нет.
- [spoiler] Убийство котика :с[/spoiler];

Плюсо-минусы:
+\- Музыка( она как бы есть, но она как бы не очень. Но спасибо, что хоть так);
+\- Лесбиянки, идеи феминизма (на вкус и цвет, но мне не зашло).

А теперь разгуляемся и распишем подробно. Возможны спойлеры, так что аккуратнее. По возможности постараюсь их скрыть, но не обещаю.
Поехали. 
Итак. Мы просыпаемся в подвале – лаборатории и не особо понимаем «кто мы», «что мы» и «почему мы живое». Зато вполне осознаем, что имеем речь и возможность мыслить. Уже не плохо. И с этого начинаются наши приключения по особняку-замку. 
По пути мы собираем листочки-записочки, вырванные из дневников, и пытаемся догадаться, что к чему. Вроде бы как, сюжет начинает затягивать. 
[spoiler] А потом мы убиваем котика,  и всё несётся в сторону дна. И обратного пути нет[/spoiler].
После нахождения [spoiler] Белладонны [/spoiler] вся игра скатывается куда-то в самые низы мироздания и вот уже слышен стук с донышка. Начинается что-то… Что-то. Собственно, уже к этому моменту вы перестанете читать записки и уже поймете, в чём соль истории.
Главная героиня совершенно спокойно соглашается с мнением [spoiler] Белладонны [/spoiler]. Хотя, это можно свалить на то, что [spoiler] после воскрешения безвольное тело полностью подчиняется хозяину, какое-то время, что мы узнаем по ходу игры из дневника Беллодонны [/spoiler], но, вроде как наша главная героиня более совершенна, чем [spoiler] Белладонна [/spoiler]. И, возможно, именно по этому на неё это не распространяется. Тогда почему? Великие чувства? Ну такое ([spoiler] судя по последней записи в дневнике самый ГГ [/spoiler]) . А потом нам показывают чёрный экран и… ЛЕСБО-ЗОМБИ! Точнее ЛЕСБО-МЕХАНИЧЕСКИЕ ЗОМБАРИ!11!!
И на этом игра заканчивается. 
И ты сидишь, пялишь такой в экран. 
И такой:
-Чё?
В общем, особо игру не советую. Она не окупается даже на скидке (16р). Можно найти что-то более интересное на эти деньги. А если вам еще и не нравится феминизм и всё что с ним связанно, то точно идите мимо. Как не странно, но история затрагивает идеи феменизма. Но делает это как-то… Извращенно и неприятно. Оно отталкивает. 
А если вам так интересно посмотреть, что же там за дичь такая, то посмотрите на ютубе прохождение.

I am finished with Belladonna after about 45 minutes. It is still very short but I had fun. The puzzles werent very challenging like other Point and Click adventures. I would say the stronges points about this game would be the Art. I dont recommend it to buy it for the full price but if its on sale you can buy it.

I made a little walkthrough. Honestly its not necessary but if you just want to watch the game without commentary because you dont think this game is too short for buying then just watch the Videos.

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Too easy (can be suitable for persons who never played a Point & Click adventure game)
[*]Too short (I finished it in 1h30, then had to run the game in background to drop the remaining trading cards.)
[*]Lack of video and sound option (Launch in Fullscreen HD)
[*]Maybe too much text to read (the diary pages that you find all along)
[*]Currently overpriced in my opinion, even if the dev has made undeniable efforts to achieve a polished quality product, there are lot of Point & Click Adventure games that are more interesting for cheaper.

Wir erwachen in einem merkwürdigen Labor. Unser Gedächtnis ist ausgelöscht. Offenbar sind wir eine schlanke junge Frau mit einer Glatze und einem Aufziehmechanismus, der direkt durch unseren Kopf führt. So weit, so Frankenstein.

Also schleichen wir durch die Räume des gruseligen Anwesens und versuchen zu ergründen, was die Hintergründe unserer Situation und Existenz sein mögen. Dafür finden wir immer wieder einzelne Seiten, die Teile der Geschichte enthüllen. 

Mechanisch befinden wir uns im klassischen Point-and-Click. In Screens können wir Gegenstände betrachten, einige aufnehmen, um sie zu kombinieren oder in anderen Screens einzusetzen. Gute, alte Hausmannskost also. Mit Inventar.

Die Grafik ist erstaunlich stilsicher, schafft es mit seinem klaren Comicstil das Genre gekonnt zu treffen und mit Niveau zu unterhalten. Ebenso gekonnt erweist sich die talentierte englischsprachige Sprecherin in den vertonten Passagen. Ihre Haltungen spiegeln die intelligente, manchesmal zu ironischem Phlegma neigende Figur.

Und das ist das Erstaunliche und die eigentliche Stärke von ""Belladonna"". Im Gegensatz zum tumben Frankenstein einer Mary Shelly ist hier der Hauptcharakter intelligent, reflektiert und auch humorfähig, trotz oder gerade wegen der durchs Hirn getriebenen Drehschraube. Auch die Geschichte ist gekonnt erzählt und funktioniert wie eine Short Story.

Das größte Problem ist allerdings der Umfang, der durch das abrupte Ende und die sehr einfachen Rätsel auch nicht gerade zunimmt. Auch wenn man alle Zettel liest, kann man in 90 Minuten durch sein. Aber besser knackig und gut als umfangreich und langweilig. Auch in diesem Punkt ist ""Belladonna"" eine bella donna.

This is one of those games that really needs a ""meh"" button. I did decide to recommend it in the end, but if I were you I'd wait for the next sale. It's not a bad game, but it's pretty expensive for what it is - namely more of a slightly interactive short story.

-Technical Stuffs-
Runs fine. No crashes, no bugs.

-Visuals-
The art style is interesting and appealing, but also pretty rough in places. It's a visually pretty well designed game, though, and everything fits together quite nicely. There's a nice sort of coherence to the entire thing, also regarding the color choices. I like 2D games with a bit of character, so I'm willing to let it slide if the style occasionally went from ""stylized and painterly"" to ""pretty sketch-y, if you know what I mean"". 

-Audio-
The soundtrack was pretty decent and matched the game well, but it's not completely mindblowing or anything, either. The main character was pretty well voiced (in a characteristically rough-around-the-edges kinda way), the rest of the voice acting was... okay? I guess?

-Gameplay-
You click on stuff, which pretty much works as well as you'd expect it to - namely pretty well, if you're fond of clicking on stuff. On the downside, there's really not much to do except for clicking on stuff. The game is extremely linear, and extremely easy. There are some very, very minor puzzles, but I never even had to stop and think.

-Story 'n Stuff-
There are two big plot twists, one I (and pretty much everyone else) knew about and one I saw coming from a mile off. There were some small things I didn't see coming, too, which was neat. Not quite sure what to think about that ending, though - IMO it was either five minutes too long, or a few hours too short, but the game ending where it does feels a bit odd.

-Conclusion-
I enjoyed the game quite a bit, it was half cute and half pretty thought-provoking and it's certainly quite different. Alas, once you've played through it, you've pretty much seen it all, which leaves you with... oh, around an hour or so of playtime and no reason to go back and play it again. As I mentioned, the full price is fairly expensive for an hour of playtime. Not egregiously so, not by any means, but still. Then again, this is a tiny, tiny indie game made by a tiny, tiny team, so I'm willing to cut the creator(s)* some slack.
I do recommend this game on sale. If you can get it for cheap, get it. If it's worth the money at full price depends on your disposable income - if those seven bucks are a decent chunk of money for you, you should probably pass and go for something with more replay value, but if you've got money to spend... Belladonna is not a bad game by any means.

[spoiler]That said, I really hope they re-animated that cat after they were done with that... other... thing. I mean... sheesh, girl, was that really necessary?[/spoiler]

Things start off well enough, with a mystery and an appealing art style. However, as the play continues, it soon becomes obvious that the scenic designer has forgotten to finish the sets, the screenwriter left the script to be written by his curious teenage daughter, and the director is shouting out spoilers from behind the curtain. The gothic castle consists of a couple tiny rooms, the initially dark story soon throws all of that out the window and ends in a puzzlingly cheery end-title screen reminiscent of the game covers from the 90's (think Commander Keen) that looks extremely out of place, and the point-and-click adventure boils down to the game telling the player exactly what and where to use.

Belladonna isn't difficult. There's maybe an hour an a half of content here, give or take, and the puzzles are straighforward and perfectly logical. So, as an Adventure Game, it's unremarkable and not at all frustrating.

Where it really shines, though, is in the voice acting and the art. It is beautiful and charming in its Gothic-Horror appeal. It never even comes close to being scary, but then much classic Gothic horror just isn't. Neither of the gothic horror stories it seems to draw most strongly from (Carmilla and Frankenstein) are especially scary - but they deal in unsettling concepts.

There are some notes scattered throughout that tell pieces of the story of your creator, which was far from a happy one. With some effort, you eventually can escape your ""birth chamber""...and that's when things really get interesting. Such is the basic setup of Belladonna and to reveal too many more specifics would be a disservice.

Okay, let's get a few things out of the way first. One, this is not a long game to play. It took me a little over an hour to make my way though the whole story, there are no side activities and the overall area you're playing in is very contained. Two, the puzzle-solving is logical but extremely basic. I would be very surprised if a player who has made it through the likes of the classic Sierra or Lucasarts series of adventure games didn't have an idea what to do just through careful examination and deductive reasoning (to say nothing of your player character's own observations in the rare event that you are stuck). Indeed, had I not purchased this for an extreme discount during the Winter Sale this past year, I would feel extremely cheated by such features.

So why am I giving this game a thumbs up? Because, as little as it does overall, it does those few things so right as to make the experience memorable. I realize how many modern players object to reading letters as opposed to hearing them given a voiceover but the story the letters you find weave a tale that's worth the VERY few minutes you need to spend reading them. While there are plenty of playful references to Poe and Young Frankenstein as well as surprisingly insightful observations from your player character that emphasizes her innocence, the overall story is the real winner. It is nothing less than the most subversive take on Frankenstein that I have ever seen (and I am a hardcore fan of all things Frankenstein) with a feminist slant that makes me wish the game had lasted a little longer.

If you are willing to overlook the flaws I've already noted, I can promise that this video-game-as-short-story is VERY worth your time.",1483294274,1483294274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I think I paid, like, 15 cents for it during the fall? While it's an amazing game and I loved it, it's definitely not worth $6.99. It's quite a short game. As you can tell by my hours on record, I literally beat it all in 1 hour. I walked everywhere and double checked to ensure I did everything and still beat it in an hour. Others have beat it in less time. For me, I just took my sweet time so I could enjoy the game, which I would definitely suggest, since it's worth playing. 

That being said, if you skip over the price and the playtime length, it's  still quite awesome, simply for the enjoyment factor and the fact that it's definitely unique in comparison to other games. 

This game had an interesting premise to it and odd art. That's what drew me in. I love creepy and weird things like this, plus it's a point-n-click game, so it's even cooler, since I'm a huge fan of those types of games. It gave me the same eerie vibes that the game ""Harvester"" (Another great point-n-click game that I grew up playing and still love) gave me- a combination of Tim Burton and Guillermo Del Toro. The plot is interesting and I love getting back story and whatnot as you go along. Couple it with the strange music and it's definitely a great game. 

Aside from the price and play time, my only real complaint is about the ending.

The story (do not confuse this with 'a game') IMO is a decent but VERY Short visual novel / point and click with zero choices, other than selecting the questions you are required to ask at only one point in the story. The number of hours reflected above represent the eternity spent waiting for the 7 cards to drop, while actual playtime was barely 1-1.5 hours max.

PROS: The story is fairly interesting while being just too short. For what it is, I think it is well done and it did keep my interest. The artwork is ok, and the voice acting was nice. The click zones for items collected were good, and crafting was easy.

CONS: 1) Dev has stated that no Achievements will be coming for Belladonna - PERIOD (ok, fair enough); 2) BUT, the HUGE number of Trading Cards (13) are grossly disproportionate to the terribly small number of items that will drop (i.e. 3 backgrounds ONLY) - Really!!! Reeks of a cash-grab IMO.

Ah, and one other thing - the developer himself wrote somewhere on his website that his work is highly influenced not only by other video games, but also by literature. I can say that it really feels, especially while reading the pages torn from ""Belladonna's"" characters diaries.

In my opinion I see this game as charming and interesting with nicely drawn environments.

Because of the puzzles' simplicity it keeps the game moving forward and the story going. The notes give a good sense of story and even though it is a beautiful one it can be predictable as I drew two conclusions with one of them being correct in the end.
The graphics of the cutsene in the bedroom looks strange and out of place. I did not see the reason to even have that cutscene.

PROS:
¬Appealing art style to the game and story
¬Interesting story
¬A good way to relax for an hour
¬Main character with interesting dialogue (inspect everything you can, you won't regret it)

CONS:

Belladona is short point'n'click game with a decent story and very cute graphics.

This is of free flash game quality, but I don't feel cheated out of my money - I liked the story and the setting and the graphics.

The characters are all individually interesting, and the playable character is adorable and lively, she makes me want to interact with every object over and over again just in case she has another comment to make

My only true complaint is that this game feels as if it should be longer, the ending is rather abrupt and it just sounds and looks like there was meant to be more story

I was very interested in [spoiler] how Belladona and Karla's relationship would develop. There is and was such a complete imbalance of power between them, and considering the ending image, I doubt that would have changed, but I would have liked to see them talking more about themselves and each other, and rectifying the damage the Karla's lost memories would have caused. Did Karla ever remember, or did she develop into a new person without them [/spoiler] I'm left feeling like I'm 3/4 of the way through the book and find that the rest has been ripped out

La mecánica de juego es la propia de un point & click, con puzzles muy sencillos.

La historia no se transmite dentro del juego sino con notas, lo que lo hace más pesado y poco interactivo. No es una solución óptima.

Hay que reconocer que el suspense que se genera desvelando con las notas está bien pensada, pero es una mecánica poco fluida, y la historia en sí es muy simple. El final, muy pobre, decepcionante. 

En mi opinión, es un juego que le falta más desarrollo, y dedicación. Me parece un proyecto con un deadline muy justo o, simplemente, un proyecto personal que se ha aprovechado comercialmente.

No es un mal juego, y por unos pocos céntimos, o en caso de encontrarlo en un bundle, no está de más. No obstante, hay muchísimas mejores opciones en este género, juegos que realmente son algo más que un proyecto personal a ""mediohacer"". Es un juego que calificaría entre el 5 y el 6.

Puzzles are pretty easy, the main emphasis in this game lies in the story, and it's pretty mediocre. You can easily guess the ending halfway through the game.

Puzzles aren't too taxing and you don't really spend more than 5 minutes having to think up an answer. While this is a plus in any game, for a game that is as short as Belladonna, I maybe would have liked something a tad more trying.

This is added after I spent several more hours trying to get card drops so, first off, disregard the time on by my name. My original run through of this game took me 40 minutes.
Another thing I would like to add is, after I sat here and played the game several more times to receive card drops, I realized just how problematic this game is in general.

Honestly, it was just a game I sort of bought real cheap on sale, played real fast, then forgot about until I realized I had seven more card drops avaliable.
Through my second and third playthrough of the game, I started really reading the notes of that are left behind and listening to the converations Klara has with herself and Belladonna and the game is actually pretty disconcerting.

[spoiler] At one point, both Klara and Belladonna acknowledge that they no longer have concern for lives around them and feel no mercy towards killing things, and Belladonna literally just is all like 'it's fine; we're dead anyways so we should have to care about living people.' [/spoiler]

Just... some of the things said are really disturbing and, it's layered with pretty (yet sometimes grotesque) art and cute phrases from Klara.

Ainda bem que comprei com super desconto, porque o jogo é muito curto. E deu pra perceber ao longo do jogo, que tava acabando.

Um jogo razoavel. Queria mais capitulos. mais para VN que point'n'click, bem curto (1 hora no máximo), história interessante, boa dublagem da personagem principal, puzzles sem dificuldades e final que poderia ser extendido ou gerar uma sequencia.
recomendo pq gostei da história mas dou nota 4/10 pq como jogo é muito simples e curto. Jogo curto, divertido, com uma historia interessante! A letra dos textos podia ser maior. Aconselho o jogo pra quem conseguir pegá-lo em algum tipo de bundle ou promoção, fora isso não vale a pena. A história do jogo é até envolvente, e acaba de certa forma prendendo o jogador na leitura das notas, mas o jogo não tem nem 1 hora direito de gameplay, e o final é completamente desnexo com a proposta que a história tinha.

Belladonna é uma pérola indie e uma grande homenagem tanto aos antigos ""scummvm games"" (ou adventures point and click como ficaram conhecidos por aqui) quanto aos filmes de terror clássicos (a referência à Frankenstein é bem óbvia na verdade).

Você no controle de uma garota-cadáver recém acordada de uma mesa cirúrgica deve explorar uma mansão sombria atrás de pistas do seu passado, morte e reencarnação. É um game que te prende pela história simples, porém extremamente bem contada, do começo ao fim.

Разумеется, приятный и знакомый игровой процесс способны перекрыть всё плохое, что может быть в данном жанре, но это не значит, что на подобные проблемы не стоит обращать внимание.

Прежде всего, стоит сказать, что сюжет вполне себе интригует, и написан хорошо. Мы играем за некую девушку-«монстра-Франкенштейна», просыпающуюся с амнезией на операционном столе. В распоряжении у нас целый замок для исследования и тайна, завеса которой приоткрывается с нахождением разбросанных по локациям записок. Как несложно догадаться, игра в жанре «квест» и обладает типичнейшим для себя управлением: поиском предметов, комбинированием, использованием и так далее. Всё это нам знакомо, ничего нового в жанре не открылось

Среди самых заметных плюсов можно отметить мрачный готический дизайн и визуальное оформление. Происходящее напоминает атмосферой ранние работы Тима Бёртона с его безумной тёмной фантазией и чёрным юмором. Задние планы прорисованы великолепно, да и главная героиня радует глаз, в том числе и своей анимацией. Звуковое оформление и музыка соответствуют, создавая настроение. Загадки весьма простые, так что ни у кого затыков точно не будет. Голос озвучки главной героини приятный, а её монологи хорошо прописаны. Это среди сильных сторон.

Среди слабых, разумеется, продолжительность. Всего час на игру – это просто преступление против жанра, даже с такой небольшой стоимостью. И это даже притом, что половина этого времени уходит на чтение записок. Вот тут, на мой взгляд, главный просчёт разработчика, так как записок много, все они раскрывают историю, но насыщены такой дикой графоманией, что диву даёшься. Обидно, что они даже элементарно не озвучены. Да, это записки, их надо читать, но лучше уж пусть за нас их читает закадровый голос, чем пытаться распознать местный подчерк. В прицепе, если знать английский, можно понять и прочитать, но, блин, буквы просто ужасно микроскопические. К тому же, в какой-то момент, если внимательно всё читать, начинаешь задумываться, почему записок так много? Из восьми первых можно понять по сути весь сюжет. Две предпоследних действуют на атмосферу. А остальные-то зачем? Там рассказана история с других точек зрения, но при этом нет никаких сюжетных поворотов, оправдывающих это. Вот если бы с каждой точки зрения записки представляли бы всё в ином свете! Например, всё это время мы думаем о любви двух персонажей, и тут бац! Оказывается, что второй вовсе не любил первого, и всё это было подстроено. К сожалению, этого не происходит, что очень обидно, так как читать нужно много. Конечно, было бы лучше вообще обойтись без записок и оставить историю на долю исследования ещё большего числа локаций, но имеем что имеем.

Ещё не понравилось техническое исполнение. Иногда персонаж ходит по воздуху вместо локации, проходит сквозь другие объекты, масштаб завален. Короче, есть что подтянуть. Загадки получились слишком уж простыми, а та, что с котиком, вообще вымораживает. Далее по сюжету это слегка обосновывается, однако не вижу причин подобной жестокости, если в итоге это никуда не привело. Ну и, конечно, слишком очевидная и бессмысленная концовка.

Но отнюдь игра вовсе неплоха. Нарисовано всё здорово, хотя бы посмотреть на местные декорации обязан каждый, дизайн креативе и музыка держит атмосферу жизнеспособной. В общем, нормально для первого проекта, однако разработчику нужно что-то намного большее, чем получасовой геймплей с дичайшей графоманией…",1473678383,1473678838,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Belladonna strongly focuses on the story, not at all on the gameplay (hence the simple point&click actions required, no actual puzzles), which indeed translates to low replay value and also spoiler-sensitivity, but I had a good time with the game. My play-through took about 100+ minutes that I don't regret in the least. But they are over now. Mind that when you decide to get the game.

I saw complaints here about length vs asking-price (€7), and I do have to agree with those. 3€ or less would be well measured. (Sorry, creator, but I look at it from the consumer side. I can imagine what this feels like, I've been on the other side of the fence, too.) I got the game for practically no cash because it came in a bundle.

I played the game on Window 10 without issues or special settings.

The store page mentions trading cards. I didn't get any, but another review is saying that leaving the game on for a few more hours drops the cards.

以下内容剧透提醒：
1、游戏比较阴暗，但并不恐怖。
2、游戏主题比较哥特，书房中的乌鸦头像以及主角为其取名Annabel应当是源自美国最早的著名哥特恐怖小说家、诗人Edgar Allan Poe，其诗作[i]Raven[/i]《乌鸦》和[i]Annabel Lee[/i]都是上作。[spoiler]另外此人出现在South Park S17E04中。[/spoiler]
3、游戏基本没有太大难度，衔接非常连贯，英语好的朋友建议阅读故事情节，还是比较有意思的。
4、故事基本情节（剧透）：
[spoiler]故事发生于哥特时期，一个上流社会家庭中，此家庭居住于一座城堡内，男主人是一个类似教授的，女主人即为Belladonna，另外belladonna是一种植物，有剧毒。两人的孩子夭折后男主人精神失控每天躲在地下室中实验，因此家庭变故，仆人纷纷离去而只有一个叫做kalma（这个名字我记不得了）的女佣人一直留在女主人belladonna身边，于是两人百合，但可能被男主人发现，之后Kalma死亡，女主人也死亡，男主人研究的东西就是把死人复活，复活了女主人Belladonna，之后belladonna慢慢恢复了意识杀死了男主人，后Belladonna想要复活她的爱人也就是仆人Kalma，于是学习男主人的研究，但成功时没动力了，她却不能给自己上发条于是她就停在了自己的房间，后Kalma在地下室苏醒，即玩家的第一幕，也就是说本游戏主角，玩家操控者就是Kalma。之后找了一些东西女主人需要继续复活其儿子，最后戛然而止，从结尾的图片看貌似统治了世界？结局比较仓促。[/spoiler]另外还有一些剧情叙述了各个人物的内心世界，在此就不再赘述了，希望英语能力合适的朋友自行观赏。

Belladonna is a decent point-and-click adventure, and it's low price tag makes it easier to recommend. 

The story is not exactly inspired, somewhat of a generic ""Frankenstein's Monster"" story, but it is passable. About halfway through the game you will likely have guessed the rest of the plot. 

The game itself is only about 75-90 minutes long, depending on how fast you read and how much backtracking you have to do to grab items you didn't see the first time. Luckily, the game levels are not very large, so backtracking isn't much of a pain. The puzzles themselves are not too bad, I had an easier time with this game than some other point-and-click's where what you have to do next is very obscure. 

The writing and voice acting are somewhat amateurish, though for the most part the journals you will read throughout the game were not too badly written. The main character's voice just sounded off to me, more like a young boy than a young woman's. 

The graphics and aesthetics in the game are likely the best part of the game, and I thought everything was beautifully done. The only issue graphics-wise would be the walking animation. I didn't notice it too much until I was almost finished with the game, but the characters legs look strange when she walks, it does not work smoothly. 

The biggest issue with the game would have to  be the ending. I knew that I was nearing the end, but instead of finishing the storyline, it basically was one last click and then I was brought to a big ""game over"" screen. The game was mostly wrapped up, but it needed a few more lines of dialogue and/or another cutscene to properly bring the game to an end. It was rather jarring. 

Overall, for the asking price, especially if you can get it on sale, I would recommend this game if you are a point-and-click adventure fan. 

Pros:
+Graphics/Artstyle
+Decent writing, if not as refined as one may like
+Clear, non-frustrating puzzles
+Low asking price

Neutral:
+/- Short game length (can be a pro or con depending on the person's interest in the game)

 First of all i would like to let you know that Belladonna is not a bad game at all, but not a good one either, the developers had a great idea for their game but sadly they didn't know how to fully use it and implement it what made it feel like its still incomplete and missing many things, especially the ending; it  was acceptable for such a linear story but to be honest this got me so disappointed
The voice acting is good, the artwork is nice and well-drawn and the ""few"" puzzles are so easy to solve
The story is so short (1-2 hours depending on your reading speed, and yes .. if you don't like reading games don't even bother buying it ^^) and after you finish it you'll find yourself missing some trading cards what oblige you to idle it for few more hours if you do care about these stuff
To conclude with, this is one of the times where i wish steam had a ""meh, it's acceptable"" option, this game could be so good for newbies to the genre, other than that there is no real reason to prefer it on the other point & click games out there on the market.    5/10",1465299965,1465300566,True,6,1,0.551638245582580566,0,False,False,False,False,,,

My main problem really is that this game walks right up to the very edge of compelling narratives and then dismisses them and moves on. A character muses on a moral quandry that would make for a really interesting turn in the game, twice, and then just dismisses them. There is a vague reason for it in the narrative, but given the short playtime, it's frustrating that interesting content is teased but never delivered.

Also, given that the main character is a reanimated corpse, I'm not sure if the voice acting was well done or a bit off. Could have totally been intentional.

A less important issue is that the game has 7 trading cards, but playing this through to 100% completion took me a little under one hour. With no more content to see, I just have to leave this running in the background as I wait for the rest of the cards. A bit troublesome, but not so much as to take away from the Frankenstien inspired narrative.

In short, my main issues were:

-Makes tons of literary references (to the point of becoming annoying), yet does nothing to build upon said works to present something new or different. 

-One of the most interesting premises and moral issues of the game is brought up at the very end, yet rather than starting this game from this point (which could have set the stage for an even  darker but truly deep game that made use of its literary references) or at least continuing on for another chapter, one of the characters immediately dismisses the concern and leaves us with well-drawn, but uttering disappointing end screen.

-Voice acting does not fit the setting or characters at all. The actors really do give it their all, but the acting did not fit the gothic setting.

The game is very short, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as that's the amount of time the game needs to say and achieve what it wants to. Belladonna, though interesting enough to hang on through minimal puzzle-solving/ item finding, only begins to come alive (pun intended) at its very end, which is a shame.

Despite all of this, I truly hope the developers continue to make games,  Belladonna is not a bad game, in fact, if it was, then I simply would have dismissed it entirely and not bothered writing this review. 

What makes Belladonna so frustrating is that is has so much potential- interesting subject matter, good artwork, ethical issues, etc- but doesn't fully execute on those elements and ends before it truly begins.

Именно они послужили источником вдохновения для Эдгара Алана По, так как о хэппи энде в этих историях можно было лишь мечтать. И лишь спустя время сказки были переписаны, чтобы дети, услышавшие их, могли закрыв глазки спать и видеть чудесные сны, а не метаться по постели в ужасе, сгрызая себе ногти в кровь и со слезами на глазах причитать, что за окном стоит безголовый человек с топором, а в шкафу притаилось нечто огромное, волосатое и чья голова состоит из одних только зубов. Как бы то ни было, а это даже к лучшему. Нечего детям психику ломать. Пусть лучше сладко спят, ведь во сне их ждет добрый дядя в полосатом свитере, грязной шляпе и перчаткой о четырех лезвиях, хе-хе-хе.

Вот и наш сегодняшний гость является мрачным гостем из прошлого. Гротескным уродом, который тянет руки-крюки к горлу ничего не подозревающему геймеру и нежным голосом произносит: «Поиграй со мной». Впору развернутся и бежать со всех ног, но ведь мы все – храбрые люди, привыкшие давать бой всяким монстрам и чудовищем, верно? Вот и окунаемся в водоворот безумия, порожденного фантазией сценаристов данной игры. Перед нами готическая сказка в жанре квеста. Сказка, что красиво нарисована, интересно рассказана, ну а самое главное – все задачки, что подкинет нам игра будут логичны и не надо будет скрещивать кота с ослом, чтобы засунуть последнего в водосточную трубу, дабы последняя рухнула. Другое дело – сказка то зубастая. Она не раз и не два укусит геймера побольнее, насмехаясь над семейными ценностями, привязанностями людей, а также любви к домашним животным. Я не стану вдаваться в подробности, так как продолжительность игры – один час. Я скажу просто – история способна оставить по себе долгую память и массу впечатлений. Положительных или отрицательных уже зависит от мировоззрения конкретного человека. Так что если будет время и желание, то можете ознакомится с данной игрой на досуге. Одно «но» - не берите игру на полной стоимости, не надо. Она того явно не стоит. Возьмите лучше на хорошей скидке.

This isnt looking like a complete game. The whole game can be played under less than a couple hours with no speeding WHATSOEVER. It really is made with little content at all!

I would have wanted to start with the pro's, rather than con's, but...there are very little pro's to it:

- the concept: it is sort of interesting, sadly it remained what it was, a concept;
- SOME, and i mean SOME of the visuals are truly keeping up with the graphic style entirely;
- voice acting: Klara is rather nicely acted, a nice voice to listen to actually;

CON'S

- game content and inherently its length: are you kidding me??? The game is made out of maybe not even 10 rooms! And some of them are only used as passage from an area to the other, while other contains just a note and nothing else!
- story: the plot is almost entirely unfold through handwritten notes over and over AND over again. If that wasnt enough, they're just an image and therefore the font can't even scale up to proportion, and stays awfully small. 
- puzzles: all of the puzzles are just a joke. They take seriously no time at all to figure out, and often you're even told plainly what to do. They're not even puzzles! 
- some drawings: i chuckled as i saw Doctor's Wolf body. It has so many issues...and Belladonna isnt truly well drawn either.
- animations: oh my freaking god. Klara literally fluctuates and has no interaction whatsoever with the surroundings.
- overall lack of polish and care: room transitions carrying the description ""exit"" or ""to the next room"", truly short soundtrack looping over and over, lack of basic interaction.
- the ABRUPT ending. There's not even a cinematic at the end. Just a colorful screen with an ""END"" sign so you get it, at least....

In conclusion: this game was either not completely taken care of or maybe it was completed in a rush. As the story stands, it's pretty much uncompleted and feels more of a demo rather than a complete game.",1462431656,1462431870,False,2,0,0.546453297138214111,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's a short game, not the greatest one out there, but it's decent one~ It might be better to pick this one up when it's on a good sale, but that's yours to decide. Though just a heads up on some things:

-My initial run of the game took a little under an hour, and I was taking my time with it. Not the longest game around. 
-There is no volume control for the game, you have to adjust the volume on your computer itself.
-During the final item hunt, I knew what I needed to get and how to get in there, what the game doesn't allow is for that to happen unless you talk to the character who gave you the quest to trigger it. A bit stupid but that took me a bit to figure out on run 1. 

But what this game has too is some nice art and while cheesy with some dialogue, I did enjoy the fact 2/3's of the TINY cast were bi/pan and a lesbian. Combined with the ending and I'd call it a good game at the end of the day! Though the addition of a volume control in the game itself would be wonderful.

Mixing the themes of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein with a grotesque tale of love, Belladonna is an adventure game for those who like their stories a bit weird, even if it lasts barely an hour.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Belladonna is a name of conflicts: an Italian phrase that means ‘beautiful woman’, but also the name given to a somewhat bland-looking flower – a very poisonous flower. This game, named after both, carries that strange duality: it is beautiful, but it is a game about death.

Death and reanimation, death and unlife, death and what could be considered unnatural even by the less religious people too. In short, Belladonna is a game that starts with a re-enactment of Mary Shelley’s ‘Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus’– or, more precisely, the underlying theme of brining the dead back to life.
After this ghoulish start, the game follows the steps of the newly-resurrected girl who slowly discovers the reasons and events that led to her current state: a story about a marriage gone sour and a man getting obsessed with his work about creating life. A story which also has a few small twists in it, even if most are telegraphed in very obvious ways long before their big reveal.

Although this game is a point ‘n’ click adventure in theory, in practise few things will ever stand in the player’s way to discover the story it wants to tell. Only a handful of objects are used and most of the time the game tells how to accomplish the required objective, so the roughly one-hour game time– the only obviously sore spot about Belladonna– is spent by fully immersing ourselves in this weird, somewhat bittersweet, and maybe mildly disturbing tale.",1461570814,1461570814,True,16,0,0.670662760734558105,2,False,False,False,False,,,

1) Необходимо открыть путь к папке с игрой (У меня он такой):
     C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Belladonna
2) В папке найти файл:    config.ini
3) В этом файле отредактировать следующие значения:

     Поменять на:    RESOLUTION = Desktop
И / Или
     Значение:    FULLSCREEN = yes
     Поменять на:    FULLSCREEN = no
4) Сохранить файл
Мне помогла замена лишь первого значения. Один раз вылетела игра, но сюжет не обнулился.

Итого:
1) (Возможно) Для запуска игры потребуется отредактировать конфиг.файл.

А в играх подобного жанра сюжет-ядро. Потому заранее прошу прощения за тот текст, что получится ниже. Высказаться немного хочется. [/b]

Сразу оговорюсь, что квест достойный внимания но со скидкой. Почему? Потому что сюжета там на 1,5 - 2 часа. Зависит от вашего прокаченного навыка ""скорость чтения"". Практически весь сюжет подаётся в виде записок - страничек дневников героев. 

Играем мы за дамочку с большим ключом в голове. Кто она, что она, как она, где она, почему она - главные вопросы, главная интрига всей сюжетной линии. Не стоит искать в этой игре сложных головоломок. Всё крайне логично, всё очень просто. Еси вы хотите прокачать IQ и ради этого хотите купить Белладонну, то мой совет - нет. Вы разочаруетесь и поставите с большой вероятностью палец вниз. А игра всё же заслужила чуточку больше. Я сам хотел минусонуть проект, честно. Но что-то меня заставило этого не делать. Возможно суть в подаче сюжета.

Он правда интригует. Дело в том, что история подаётся под разными углами, что вызвало у меня некоторый эффект ""скачка симпатии"", я так это называю. Впервые подобное я испытал от фильма ""Исчезнувшая"" с Беном Афлеком. Сюжеты категорически разные, но вот чувство, когда ты сперва симпатизируешь одному персонажу, потом резко симпатизируешь другому и уже первого считаешь козлом, а потом снова восхваляешь первого, а под конец тошнит от обоих. Для меня подобные впечатления были тогда в новинку, когда я привык к однозначности. Вот тут герой, вот он злодей. Всё ясно-понятно. А тут разрыв шаблона. И вот именно в этой игре я испытал подобное ощущение. Нам дали возможность пороиться сразу в трёх головах. Взглянуть на один и тот же период жизни трёх героев с их собственных точек зрения. Возможно именно это вновь возникшее чувство ""скачка симпатии"" и заставило меня поставить лайк.

Записок в игре катастрофически мало. Я должен признаться, что написаны они действительно интригующе. Заканчивается каждая на правильных нотках, вызывая реальное желание почитать ещё немного. Понять происходящее. Погружение в игру я испытал достаточно глубокое, что для проекта в 2 часа максимум, просто отличный результат. 

Рисовка в игре приятная, с артхаусными нотками, элементами абстракции и достаточной мрачностью. Озвучка приятна на слух, герои не плохо отыгрывают, но всё же восторга не вызывает.

Скидочную цену игра вероятнее всего для вас отобьёт впечатлениями, карточками вряд ли, они дешёвые, так что брать рекомендую на сезонной распродаже. Во-вторых. Всё таки финал игры мне понравился. Игра обрубается резковато, но финал не типичный. К тому же по игре не остаётся вопросов. Есть один-два твиста за игру, что оказались неожиданными.

A short point-n-click adventure game where you play a reanimated zombie girl who tries to find out what happened to her. Took me 40 minutes to complete. I paid S$0.75 (~US$0.56) for this during sale.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+ Nice graphics
+ OK music
+ Decent voice acting
+ Pleasant gaming experience
+ Fascinating story - really knows how to hook you
+ Characters are well-developed

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
- Couldn't find a ""save game"" option anywhere
- Way too short for the price
- Puzzles far too simple
- Voice & text speed do not match
- Voice sometimes gets cut off once text disappears
- Text sometimes disappears if voice is too fast
- Zero replayability
- No Steam achievements
- No trading cards ([url=steamcommunity.com/app/351340/discussions/0/535152511373786456/]unless you leave the game running for several hours[/url])
- Only 1 ending
- Ending is horribly abrupt: [i]""The End""[/i] flashes and that's it!!!

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
Only get this during sale. It's very short and the ending was a huge massive gargantuan disappointment. But I did enjoy playing through the game because the story was intriguing (though also predictable), and the graphics and environment done pretty well. I hated the lack of a ""save game"" option.

Чистый плейтайм игры в области часа, так что и обзор будет коротким.

Минусы:
- Игру вполне реально пройти за час
- Для продвижения в сюжете необходимо навредить котику
- Весь сюжет подаётся в виде записок в которых кошмарный мелкий шрифт
- Ну очень базовая игровая механика

Плюсы:
+ Симпатичный мрачный игровой арт
+ Интересный сюжет // он на самом деле на любителя, но мне было интересно за ним следить
// а поскольку игра проходится за час - всё, что я мог бы сказать о сюжете было бы спойлером
+ Таинственная атмосфера

Я бы поставил этой игре нейтральную оценку, если бы так было можно,
но поскольку вариантов всего два,
то мне игра скорее понравилась, чем нет

A short point and click game.

Pros:
Nice artwork and unique character designs
Story though short is quite interesting
Simple gameplay, user friendly interface
Game difficulty is fairly average (No ripping the hair out puzzles, Still life cookie puzzle BRUTAL)
Cheap to buy
Voice Acting is decent
Atomsphere of the game is carried out well, does give you this eerie feeling, like whats going on. What is going to happen.

Cons:
Really short but its really cheap so i do not know if this could be a con
Ending wasnt the best. I enjoyed the idea and artwork presented at the end but i cant help but feel wanting more.

Overall its a pretty decent point and click game  for a cheap price just dont be prepared that it isnt the longiest game which is understandable when taking the cost into perspective. Sorry I am rambling now >_<

Belladonna from developer Neckbolt forms the latter. On the initial onset, it promises a gothic adventure filled with various themes like who’s the real villain and morale value systems. Yet when completing the game, there were very minimalistic morale systems as quite frankly, there was no choices to be made. In addition, the dominate feeling I had was, this is some kind a high school / first year university project played on primitive philosophy.

The plot encompasses the story loosely based on Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s Frankenstein. That is, the doctor Wolfram von Trauerschloss had a vision to reanimate the dead. Of course he has his own reasons thus forms the plot. To enhance the plot, there are scattered journal notes that are extremely well written, yet a little too pretentious at times, along with the spoken dialogues that gives out an impression of superiority among the readers. Also, as much as I enjoyed reading the journal notes, this places too much dominance over the said gameplay style, which is an adventure game.

Yet the strong points of this ‘game’ is the atmosphere it creates and most of that was due to its musical scores. The music was indeed haunting and does loop eventually. However the looping is so well done that you won’t notice it for the most parts. Every dialogues are voice acted and does a reasonable job at it. Visually it’s simplistic yet effective. There won’t be any pixel hunting as there’s not much inventory management to begin with. The drawings are all displayed with great detail, especially the opening scene where the female protagonist wakes up from her ‘sleep’.

Depending upon your reading speed, this game can be completed within an hour or so. It took me about two hours however I was very meticulous with all of my actions. With a price tag of USD $6.99, that’s not a good deal. I was hoping there were morale choices or at minimal, two endings. The game, whilst promises various themes and morale systems, the game ultimately is linear. Other words, it really doesn’t matter what I think as the game has a starting and ending point so basically I’m taking the viewpoint of the developer’s ‘ideal’ choice.

The game doesn’t even have a thought provoking ending where it makes the player contemplate for the moment (for instance David Lynch’s ‘Lost Highway’) and that would be an acceptable ending to a linear game however it was not the case. Also the game’s mix messages it’s sending out leads for more confusion (for instance, looking at the trading cards, is it taking the mickey out of old horror films or is Neckbolt a fan of this genre?). This clashes to the ‘moralistic’ approach to this game. So it looks like Neckbolt had some sort of story to share however couldn’t think of an appropriate gaming genre so it uses the ‘adventure’ genre as the be-all-end-all.

If it meant to be a philosophical journey, as mentioned before, it’s coming across as pretentious. Neckbolt should take a page out of a great philosophical fictional novel ‘Sophie’s World’ by Jostein Gaarder. The author uses words that can appeal to the wider audience without sounding haughty that also gets the message across. Because this game missed the queue too many times, I really cannot recommend it at its current price. If the price is maximum USD $2.99 then it can be somewhat forgiven.

Die Screenshots sahen gut aus, die Story hörte sich ganz gut an und der Einschlag von Mary Shelleys Frankenstein sprechen eigentlich für ein gutes Spiel.
Was ich jedoch bekam, war ein eher fragwürdiges Machwerk.

Zuerst einmal das Positive am Spiel, davon gibt es, trotz vieler Kritikpunkte, einiges. Mir gefällt der Grafikstil des Spiels sehr. die Hintergründe, Objekte und Charaktere sind sehr schön gezeichnet, man erkennt die Liebe, die darin steckt. Auch das Voiceacting finde ich sehr gut, welches hauptsächlich von der Protagonistin des Spiels kommt. Man hat hier definitiv die richtige Sprecherin gewählt, die Stimme passt perfekt zum Charakter.
Die Spielelemente sind sehr leicht zu bedienen, kein Wunder, man speilt es nur mit einer Taste, der linken Maustaste.

Das alles kann aber nicht darüber hinwegtäuschen, dass Belladonna in Wahrheit ein scheußliches Spiel ist. Scheußlich ist vielleicht etwas hart ausgedrückt, meiner Meinung nach aber angemessen. Ich erkenne die Mühe an, die der Entwickler in dieses Spiel gesteckt hat, aber durch viel Mühe entwickelt man noch lange kein gutes Spiel.
Was Belladonna nun so schlecht macht, ist an vielen Punkten abzusehen. 
Zum einen ist es kurz. Ein kurzes Spiel muss nicht automatisch schlecht sein, aber dieses Spiel ist bereits nach einer halben Stunde bis Stunde (je nachdem, ob man schneller oder langsamer liest) abgegrast. Die Spielzeit wurde hierbei sogar noch künstlich durch mehrere Aspekte verlängert. Zum einen bewegt sich die Protagonistin sehr langsam, dies kann man nicht beschleunigen, indem man doppel klickt. Ein Schnelreisesystem existiert auch nicht, mit dem man schnell von Zimmer zu Zimmer reisen könnte, indem man Laufanimationen überspringt. Viel schlimmer als das sind jedoch die Kommentare der Spielfigur. Wie in einem Adventure üblich, sagt unsere Heldin zu jedem Gegenstand etwas, was an sich nicht störend ist, da das Voice Acting sehr gut ist. Allerdings kann man Texte nicht überspringen. zwar verschwindet der Text auf dem Bildschirm, aber die Spielfigur redet weiter. Währenddessen kann man nichts tun, weder sich bewegen, noch Gegenstände benutzen, man muss warten, bis dieser Monolog beendet ist, was die ganze Situation nur noch viel schlimmer macht. Hier mal falsch geklickt und schon muss man wieder 3 Sätze warten. Dadurch wird die Spielzeit sehr gestreckt, ich schätze um 10 weitere Minuten.

Was ich besonders lieblos finde, ist die Geschichte. Obwohl sie sich zuerst sehr interessant anhörte, liest sich das ganze baald wie eine typische 08/15 Fanfiction aus dem Internet. Und zwar keine gute.
Ich möchte hier einmal kurz anmerken, dass jetzt gewaltige Spoiler zur Spielgeschichte folgen werden, die das ende schon vorwegnehmen. Nicht, dass es besonders gut durchdacht wäre. Die Handlung lässt sich auch viel kürzer abdecken, als sie im Spiel durch die zahlreichen und langatmigen Tagebucheinträge abgehandelt wird.


[spoiler]Die Hälfte der Geschichte wird im Grunde genommen schon auf der Shopseite erklärt, sogar die aller erste Tagebuchseite, die man direkt am Anfang findet, erklärt im grunde genommen das ganze Spiel.
Der Landgutbesitzer udn Wissenschaftler Dr. Wolfram von Trauerschloss (ganz klar eine Anspielung an Victor von Frankenstein) verliert seinen Sohn während dieser noch im Babyalter ist. Seien Frau stürzt es in eine tiefe Depression, ihn treibt es an grauenvolle Experimente durchzuführen. er versucht Herr über Leben und Tod zu werden und toten Körpern neues Leben einzuhauchen um so seinen verstorbenen Sohn wiederzuerwecken. Seine Dienerschaft ist von diesen experimenten angeekelt und flüchten vom Schloss. Einzig eine Magd bleibt, die fortan alle Aufgaben im Haushalt erfüllt.
Dies tut sie nicht aus Treue, sondern weil sie sich in die Frau des werten Doktors verguckt hat, weshalb sie zu keinem Zeitpunkt von deren Seite weichen möchte.
Irgendwann ergibt es sich, warum wird nicht im Spiel näher erläutert, dass Schlossfräulein und Magd ein Liebesverhältnis eingehen und das ganze Schloss nach neuen Liebesnestern durchstreifen, immer bei dem Versuch Dr. von Trauerschloss aus dem Weg zu gehen. Dieser kommt dennoch hinter die sehr verstörende Affäre (er hatte mit sowas gerechnet, aber er dachte, sie würde einen Mann treffen) und das treibt ihn immer mehr in den Wahnsinn. Er fasst den Plan, die Dienstmagd mit Gift zu ermorden, damit er seien Frau wieder für sich hat. Diese ist nach dem Mord jedoch so aufgebracht, dass er sie ebenfalls umbringt und danach mit seinen experimenten wieder als mechanische Puppe zum Leben erweckt. Durch diese Verwandlung ist sie nun wie ein Spielzeug für ihn, er kann sie befehligen und sie gehorcht jedes seiner Worte. Allerdings entwickelt seine Frau ihre eigene Persönlichkeit zurück, ermordet ihren Gatten, erweckt ihre Geliebte wieder zum Leben (die ihr spielt), aber kann eure Auferstehung nicht miterleben, da ihr vorher der Sprit ausgeht (scheinbar müssen die Untoten in diesem Spiel wie Speilzeuge aufgezogen werden). Das Spiel kickt ein, ihr durchsucht das Haus, löst kleine Nicht-Puzzle bis ihr eure Geliebte starr im Schlafzimemr findet udn sie wieder aufzieht. Die ist natürlich höchst erfreut und zusammen plant ihr den Doktor, llerdings mit dem Hirn des verstorbenen Sohnes, nciht seinem eigenem, wiederzuerwecken und danach wollt ihr eine ganze armee an Untoten erschaffen und eure eigene Gesellschaft gründen. Dabei wird angedeutet, dass sowohl eure Spielfigur als auch die werte Schlossherrin keinerlei Mitgefühl für die Lebenden empfinden können und deshalb grausame Mörder in die Welt schaffen. Im Abschlussbild werden dann all die grausigen Untoten gezeigt, samt eurer Spielfigur, die ihrer Herrin zu Füßen liegt und wie ein Haustier oder eine Sklavin ihre Knöchel umarmt. Sehr verstörrend.[/spoiler] 

U dem Spiel den Todesspiel zu geben: es ist an sich nichtmal ein Spiel. Mittlerweile sind sogenannte ""Walking Simulator"" sehr in Mode gekommen, die alleine deshalb existieren, um durch eien inszenierte Spielwelt zu laufen udn dabei die Spielgeschichte zu hören. Richtige Spielemente gibt es nicht und man könnte sich sogar den akt des Laufens eigentlich sparen. Die wenigen ""Puzzle"" im Spiel sind nicht anspruchsvoll und das ergebnis wird euch schon vorher auf dem Präsentierteller geliefert. eins der schlimmsten, dass ich fand, war, wo man Zahnräder in die passenden Löcher stecken muss. Dies war haargenau wie das spielzeug von Kleinkindern, wo diese die richtigen Formen in die richtigen Löcher tun mussten. Der Entwickler stellt somit den Intellekt der Spieler mit dem von Kleinkindern auf eine Stufe. Ich war richtig beleidigt über dieses ""Rätsel"". Das war allerdings auch schon das schlimmste, alle anderen waren, wenn auch kaum merklich, besser.
Hier und da gab es auch ein paar Bugs, das Spiel ist aber im großen ganzen bugfrei. Nur ein bug, der mir mehrmals auffiel, stört mich sehr, der auch wieder die Spielzeit in die Länge zog. ein paar Mal versagte das Pathfinding der Spielfigur, obwohl man etwas anklickte, wollte sie sich nicht dorthin bewegen. Man musste erstmal den weg herum anklicken, bis sie schließlich nah genug daran war, damit das Pathfinding wieder wusste, wo es lang ging.

Eine kleine abschlussbemerkung noch: Das Spiel besitzt ganze 13 (!) Sammelkarten. Ein weiterer trauriger versuch, die Spielzeit künstlich zu verlängern. Ich habe während meines Spieldurchlaufs nur eine Karte gekriegt, viele kriegen sogar GAR KEINE beim ersten durchlauf und der Entwickler selbst sagt, dass man 1-2 Karten pro Spieldurchlauf maximal kriegt (und das ist hoch gepokert). Da man pro Krte etwa 30 minuten warten muss, kommt man so bei 7 Karten locker auf 3,5 Stunden Spielzeit. Dies lässt das spiel viel länger für Außenstehende erscheinen, als es in Wirklichkeit ist.

Alles in allem finde ich, dass das Spiel nicht seien 7 Euro wert ist, nichtmal die Hälfte.",1456995905,1456995905,False,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Belladonna can best be described as a true classic gothic horror story. Most modern day horror games usually rely on jump scares and horrific images to create their ""atmospheric"" gameplay. Belladonna in contrast is using a completely different approach. By relying on a story progression similar to a detective story, the horrible truth of what dark deeds had been done, will be gradually presented to the player. This way the game manages to create it's dark and brooding atmosphere and keep the player interested in what has been happening.

Gameplay itself is your standard point-and-click adventure style, without pixel-hunting. Interactable objects will always be indentified as those (maybe except for one occasion where I got stuck XD).

[b]Belladonna[/b], как и положено по названию, выкладывает свои главные козыри в самом начале. Она дает понять, что неплохо выглядит для данной категории, и что в ней, конечно же, есть загадка. 

Некая героиня оказывается в подвале в полном беспамятстве, с железками в голове, и с желанием понять что же с ней произошло. Она бродит по комнатам, находя записки из дневников различных участников кое-какой ситуации, попутно разгадывая простые задачки, свойственные жанру point & click. И в целом, в голове игрока создается логическая цепочка, состоящая из произошедшего здесь события и причин. И были все причины начать считать данную игру простой и понятной, и если хотите «пробой пера» разработчика. Если бы не то, что началось твориться ближе к финалу...

[h1] Женщина в ногах мужчины — сексизм. Молодая худая девушка в ногах у взрослой женщины с явным уклоном на их сексуальную связь — норма. А вообще, давайте создадим армию лесбиянок и пойдем воевать с миром. [/h1]

Такого бреда и прямых отсылок ко всей этой тематики, не встречалось уже довольно давно. Причем забавялет больше не сам факт наличия этой феминисткой ереси, а то как это лихо преподносят, сворачивая весь сюжет к такой важной проблеме как «все мужики козлы».

За 30-50 минут, затраченные на прохождение, игра успевает и создать интригу, и даже немного понравиться, и полностью закопать себя ближе к финалу. Для подобной игры это провал, поскольку упор делался на историю, которая ушла куда то не туда.

А вот перекрутили бы сюжет в какое-то другое русло, чтоб эти лезбиянские вздохи были чем-то второстепенным и неважным, могло бы быть по другому.

По сути, это рассказ. Игра в данном случае выступает лишь в роли упаковки для рассказа и в этой упаковке ничего не отвлекает от главного - текста. Да, именно текст, главный в этой игре. Именно чтение всех записок (их не так много, не пугайтесь). Поэтому творцы игры сделали в ней очень простые головоломки, подсказывать способ решения которых будет сама героиня.

И так, если это игра про текст, если это рассказ, то какой же он? Он... Он неоднозначный. Увидев визуальный стиль, граничащий с сюрреализмом и прочитав описание игры, я ждал гораздо большего. Поначалу всё интригует (наверно, из-за изначально очень высоких ожиданий от игры), но уже к середине рассказа всё становится абсолютно понятным и даже продолжать читать текст не шибко интересно, поскольку и так всё ясно.

Но больше всего возмутила меня не предсказуемость рассказа. А то, что его тема пересекается с идеями феминизма, а именно с традиционным образом мужчины в глазах феминистки. И хоть это и не удивительно, учитывая, что в игре есть лесбиянки, но всё равно как-то... Отталкивает. Собственно за это, за нехорошее обращение с котом, а так же неоправданные ожидания я и ставлю игре негативную оценку. Но если объективно, то она должна быть нейтральной, поскольку игра вообще не сказать чтобы прям плохая, но она просто и не шибко хорошая. На распродаже взять вполне можно. Проходится игра абсолютно без напряга за два часа. Только сразу настройтесь на то, что эта игра про текст, а не про головоломки. А так же не ждите, что этот рассказ будет чем-то запоминающим.

Если вы заинтересовались игрой, увидев тэг point&click, и ожидаете загадок и вызовов, будете разочарованы - все типичные элементы квестов здесь чрезвычайно лёгкие и нужны исключительно для того, чтобы продвинуть вас по сюжету и занять чем-то. Основная часть игры развернётся не в красивейших локациях, а на страницах дневников трёх разных людей, которые жили в этом доме. Именно там лежат ответы на вопросы: что произошло, кто наша героиня, почему она так выглядит, есть ли в доме ещё кто-то, кроме неё. Дневники стилизованы под манеру речи и письма господ-аристократов из прошлого, и, найдя первую страницу, вы загоритесь желанием читать дальше и дальше, до самого финала. История, которая разворачивается перед нами, как и её герои, весьма необычна, но берёт истоки всё из тех же вечных тем: ревность, любовь, чувство потери, месть, ненависть. Порой от мыслей и действий персонажей (особенно доктора Вольфрама) приходишь в ужас и переживаешь за них, как за настоящих людей. Ответы на вопросы, которые поставлены в самом начале, даются только во второй половине истории, но с определённого момента несложно догадаться о том, что произошло на самом деле. Отмечу, что все записки разбросаны таким образом, чтобы умело держать в напряжении и неведении относительно того кто же наша героиня, поэтому их особенно интересно искать. Увы, я бы с удовольствием ограничилась сбором дневников и написанной историей, но создатель/создательница игры зачем-то решили не останавливаться на этом и развить историю дальше. Весьма... неожиданно развить, скажем прямо. Я так до конца и не поняла зачем был нужен этот странный и откровенно поспешный финал, будто вставленный на скорую руку, который только портит впечатление от трагической и постепенно развивающейся истории и, судя по отзывам, не я одна. Помимо этого, если вы защитник/защитница животных и жестокость в отношении них вас приводит в ужас, подумайте, прежде чем покупать игру - там есть неприятный эпизод с котом, который мешает пройти героине. 
В остальном, я рекомендую игру тем, кто любит интересные истории о человеческих судьбах и чувствах, о том, как люди под давлением обстоятельств могут раскрываться с совершенно неожиданной и очень жуткой стороны, что замалчивание проблем и уход от них никогда не были выходом, и что нельзя вначале отрицать, а потом и ""сломать"" личность другого человека (отличная и ужасная до мурашек метафора, кстати), а потом надеяться на хороший исход. 
Из недостатков упомяну разве что продолжительность - игра проходится за час-полтора в небыстром темпе и с вдумчивым чтением всех записок - и не самую хорошую озвучку (некоторые голоса звучат откровенно деревянно, но возможно оно так и было задумано).

Предупреждения (лёгкие спойлеры): физическое и психологическое насилие в отношении женщин (не без последствий для агрессора, но тем не менее), жестокость по отношению к животным.

Сюжетные спойлеры:
[spoiler]Под метафорой я подразумеваю убийство Белладонны и её последующее превращение в безвольную куклу, полностью подвластную своему мужу. Страшный момент, особенно когда понимаешь его не буквально, а метафорически - всё это время Вольфрам мечтал не о живой женщине, а о послушном красивом манекене, который улыбается когда надо, спит с ним, когда надо, никогда не противоречит и не спорит, улыбается, слушает и кивает, ловит каждое слово. У неё нет своих целей и желаний, нет своих чувств и мыслей, нет вообще ничего своего и его это более чем устраивает. Я была очень рада, когда в конце концов ненависть дала Белладонне достаточно сил, чтобы с ним расправиться.[/spoiler]",1455565732,1455653068,True,2,0,0.543189346790313721,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sure, I've taken a bath on a couple of games that weren't as good as I'd hoped, but it's never been too punishing.

Until now.

Belladonna is the first game that I truly, [i]sorely[/i] regret buying. Even if I had a time machine and could go back and buy it dirt cheap, knowing what I know now, [i]I still wouldn't[/i]. As I write this review, it's currently on sale for sixty-nine cents and my brain is still going, ""NOPE."" Listen to my brain. It knows what it's talking about. Don't make the same mistakes I did. By all means, laugh at my pain, but save yourselves.

Ostensibly, Belladonna is a point and click adventure game consisting of exploration, a mystery narrative and puzzles. That assessment is...generous, at the very least. 

In a game that takes place in what's supposed to be a [i]castle[/i], there are about a dozen locations, [i]including hallways.[/i] Most contain one item--two if you're extremely lucky!--and maybe two or three short bits of flavor text so bland I hesitate to call it flavor text at all. If light vegan mayonnaise were flavor text, it's what you'll find here. I guess if you've never had anything else, it might seem robust, but I can't imagine anyone with half a dozen decent-to-good adventure games under their belts finding it anything but dull.

The narrative isn't much better than the flavor(less) text. The plot hinges on a mystery so transparent it's easily solvable after the first clue or two if you've got a couple of spare braincells lying around to rub together. Halfway through the story, you're likely to get fed up with how it's belaboring the point you've already figured out. “I know something you don't know!” the narrative teases, “Such a mysterious mystery! Oooh!” while you start drinking heavily and praying for the sweet release of death.

The prose is written in a style that I can only adequately describe as “olden time-y,” superficially reminiscent of Gothic literature if you tossed any old novel in a blender and diluted it with heavy doses of pretentious goth kid who swallowed a thesaurus but neglected to get enough dictionary in his diet.  This might not be so bad if the story and characters were stylish or over the top enough to carry the awkwardness—Hammer or Universal horror films are hardly historically accurate, but are cool enough you don't care—but Belladonna has the panache of a worn out shoe.

The story is told primarily through diary entries written by three different characters: the scientist, his socialite wife and the maid. They all sound virtually the same. The only discernible difference between them is that our Frankenstein writes in a slightly more ornate style and throws a few scientific terms around. I repeat: a socialite and a scientist both write the same way a maid does. In the Georgian/Victorian era. (Which is it? Who knows!)

The diary entries also contain only explicitly plot related bits with nothing else to really round out the characters. They're basically props to be moved around at the whim of the developer like little cardboard cutouts. This is not the way to tell a story with any hope of emotional potency. The villain gets what feels like three times as much “screen time” through the diaries as the two main characters we're supposed to care about—and he's dead before the story even starts!

Because the whole thing is written as telling rather than showing, in spite of the fact it's all plot, the relationships between the characters are barely touched on in any meaningful way. The main romance is written about in detail—as in, what actually happened between them during the course of their months long affair—in [i]one entry[/i]; it's given no development beyond that.

Character motives are thin on the ground. The writer tries to convey that the characters are driven by grief, but does so poorly that I'm not sure they've ever met and interacted with a real live human being. Since the story picks up [i]after both characters in question are through grieving[/i], their motivations appear for all intents and purposes to consist of such compelling reasons as, “Because science! I guess?” and “Because boredom! I guess?”

The puzzles would be insultingly easy to even the most casual of gamers over the age of nine. And though I may have blocked out the more excruciating aspects of the experience, as far as I can recall with the exception of the final one, they all have the same basic end goal: open a door/container. That's it. Kill a cat to open a door. Rifle through a dead body's pockets to open a box. Get a screwdriver to open a clock. Necessary items for solving these “puzzles” are often just left lying around in plain sight, require no extra steps to acquire them and no critical thinking to make them function. Can you put two and two together and not come up with “cheese”? Congratulations, you too can finish Belladonna!

Worst of all, [i]nothing happens[/i]. Nothing. Because everything has [i]already[/i] happened. This narrative device [i]can[/i] work in games (Analogue: A Hate Story managed to pull this off pretty handily) but the writing is so lousy that even the attempt is torture. After forty-five minutes of opening doors, it finally looks like something will happen!...and then the story cuts to black. The end!

If for some reason—masochism, morbid curiosity, a large iron spike in your head tickling the 'lack of common sense' centers of your brain—you're still considering shelling out dough to buy this, let me at least mention that the less story-based aspects suffer too in hopes I might dissuade you from such folly. 

First, the voice acting is dismal and one actor portrays both speaking characters: the first in a plain American speaking voice, the second with electronic distortion and a high school play English accent. Never mind that this apparently takes place in Eastern Europe or...Germany? (Much like the time period, who the fuck knows for sure??)

The diary entries are all written in fonts that border on unreadable to various degrees. They're either too flowery, too tiny, or joy of joys both.

It's bare bones in the extreme. There are no extras. No behind the scenes character art or similar unlockables. No achievements. [i]No save button.[/i] Now that's commitment to minimalism!

Replayability is nonexistent.

If after all this you still want the game, well...Godspeed, you beautiful, romantic fool. I envy your optimism, naivete and by the way would you like to buy a bridge in Brooklyn?

In closing, I will say: if Belladonna were updated in the future and whole swaths of it were rewritten, expanded and for the love of all that's holy [i]edited[/i], it might be something special, or at least an interesting if noble failure. Currently it is anything but. My playtime will be just long enough to collect all the cards and not a second longer.

PROS:
+ I loved the artwork and the general environment.
+ Music wasn't annoying, and voice acting was ok.
+ I liked the Steampunk vibe, the theme, and the story was cool.
+ References to Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe, which made me squeal in delight.
+ Easy and logical, there is no constant backtracking, no pixel hunt, and no nonsensical inventory combinations.

CONS:
- Extremely short. I'm a VERY slow player, and I finished it in 2 hours, and that is including a pause I took for dinner while leaving the game on.
- Too easy. Not one puzzle and not one remotely challenging situation.
- The ending leaves lose ends, almost as if hoping for a sequel.

In short, if on sale, go for it. It's a nice hour and bit of a dark little story. But if you're into really challenging stuff, this one may bore you a bit.

В общем, в двух словах: игра очень короткая, а для тех кто не больно любит читать, это покажется поистине сущим ужасом. Геймплея там на час-полтора, не более, а сюжет подвязан словно на основе какого-то бразильского сериала, по типу ""А кто же убийца? Что кроется в записках? Был ли роман и как во всём замешана горничная?"", что выглядит довольно таки забавно. А теперь перейдём к минусам. 

Далее в данном обзоре будут СПОЙЛЕРЫ, так что тем, кто хочет поиграть в данный ""шедевер"", лучше не читать (но коли вы любопытны, то продолжайте, всё равно там особо никаких интересных поворотов не будет, как по мне).
1 минус игры - убийство котика. Серьёзно? Так сложно обойти кота, чтобы проникнуть в комнату? Нет - надо его обязательно травануть, а прежде чем травануть, надо надыбать молока, цветок и смешать с отравой всю эту бадягу...вместо того, чтобы просто обойти кота. ГГ не ищет лёгких путей.
2 минус игры - записки. И дело даже не в том, что они на английском (проходила без русской локализации). Вся соль заключается в том, что разработчики игры посчитали неплохой идеей ввести разный почерк в повествование сюжета через них. Ведь подписанных сверху имён авторов этих самых записок недостаточно - надо подчеркнуть индивидуальность каждого. Поэтому было решено сделать хитров****нный почерк, которым, наверное, писали графы и герцогини в веке так XVII-ом, что немного усложняет процесс их прочтения и осмысления.
3 минус игры - концовка. Концовка игры обрывается моментально. Вроде бы всё ведёт к концу, но когда он по-настоящему настаёт, то приходится сидеть секунд 10 и не понимать, что произошло. И это не из тех концовок, которые заканчиваются и заставляют тебя восторженно охнуть, мол недосказанность и всё такое. Нет. Там просто финальная картинка и титры.
4 минус игры - её неоправданно высокая цена. Да, за 16 рублей её спокойно можно приобрести, но никак не за 169. Ладно бы, если бы продолжительность игры оправдывала полную цену, но нет и этого.

Моя итоговая оценка 4/10, потому что всё же в ней есть какой-никакой сюжет, прохождение не напрягает своими головоломками (хотя это успешно делают записки), если играешь для расслабления, а цена по скидке оправдывает игру.",1454460196,1455862323,False,17,4,0.641848266124725342,10,True,False,False,False,,,

Первое что я заметил в игре это простая и в некоторых местах карявая рисовка и анимация, но стилистика игры выдержана нормально, есть атмосфера и даже появляется интерес пройти ее
Еще один минус игра короткая, просто ужас, я прошел ее за 58 инут это с тем что я отходил за чаем потом приходил и читал записки.
БАМ еще один минус геймплей сведен на минимум, из головоломок толко одна где как в детском саду нужно вставить кружок в кружок а квадратик в квадратик, весь геймпле состоит в том чтобы собирать вещи слушать мысли ГГ и иногда соединять вещи чтоб что то сделать, самое сложно что там есть это соединить 3 компонента да и то я не знаю у кого может это вызвать затруднения.и все время на кажой локации приходится читать записки в котором развиваються события до событий в игре.
сюжет прост и банален неожиданный поворот предсказуем

Niestety gra, chociaż wizualnie jest bardzo atrakcyjna, to ma swoje wady i jest to bardziej... demo ciekawej gry niż pełna gra.

Pros:

+ atrakcyjny tytuł
+ piękna oprawa wizualna - strona graficzna przyciąga uwagę
+ ładnie zaprojektowane plansze z artystycznym zacięciem
+ dość ciekawy fabularny punkt wyjścia oparty na motywach opowieści o Frankensteinie
+ czarny humor w grze
+ przejrzysty interfejs
+ pod postaci są podłożone głosy audio (co w niskobudżetowych grach nie zawsze jest standardem)
+ karty kolekcjonerskie (aż 7)

Cons:

- gra jest wyjątkowa krótka (przejdziesz ją w 40 minut - to bardziej demo ciekawej gry niż gra)
- podłożone głosy nie są najwyższych lotów (zwłaszcza póżniejsza postać Belladonny)
- prezentacja fabuły w kartkach dziennika jest słaba (nie chce się tego czytać, bo czcionka jest zbyt mała i nieczytelna)
- baaardzo prosty poziom zagadek (gra jest super łatwa)
- fabuła de facto jest szczątkowa
- głupie zakończenie robiące z niepokojącej gry farsę
- zerowe replayability
- brak achivmentów
- niewykorzystany potencjał na mocną grę

Podsumowanie:

Belladonna to zaczątek dobrej klimatycznej gry przygodowej point and click inspirowanej historią Frankensteina. Niestety chociaż Belladonna wizualnie robi wrażenie, to twórcy podeszli do niej mało poważnie - gra, którą można ukończyć na 100 procent w 40 minut to jednak jakiś żart, zwłaszcza, że fabularnie kończy się dość idiotycznie,

Gra może spodobać się jedynie tym graczom, którym wystarcza jedynie strona wizualna. Innym graczom odradzam, zwłaszcza tym, którzy szukają w grze dobrej fabuły, bo na tym polu Belladonna rozczarowuje. W bardzo dużej promocji za kilkadziesiąt centów może warto, ale nawet wtedy gra zostawia wrażenie niedosytu... Szkoda.

Довольно интересный сюжет, мрачная атмосфера, интересно выполненная графическая часть и музыкальное сопровождение. Однако у игры есть довольно существенные минусы.

Первый минус - длина сюжетки. Игру я прошла меньше, чем за полтора часа, учитывая то, что вчитывалась в записки, спокойно и тщательно все осматривала и даже местами тупила. Все остальное наигранное время я сидела в главном меню и выбивала карточки, которых должно выпасть аж семь штук. 

Сюжет игры нам передают через записки персонажей, в принципе довольно банально. Однако записки эти выполнены различными рукописными мелкими шрифтами, разными для каждого из персонажей, что показывает, что создатели старались, однако читать эти записки довольно затруднительно.

На самом деле игра очень даже хорошая, была бы она хотя бы на 3-4 часа геймплея, и если бы записки не были такими вырвиглазными, то цены бы ей не было. А так... Средненько. Честно сказать, своей цены она не стоит. (Но я покупала ее по акции с 91% скидкой, так что я всем довольна. Ну чего я еще могла ожидать за 16 рублей?)

Had I payed full price I'd be very angry right now. I love point and click games and the art style is lovely but this game is simply not worth full price. It took me an hour to beat and that's only because I got stuck and had to wander for a bit (didn't examine one of the rooms thoroughly enough). 

There were also no puzzles to solve which I could forgive had the story been better. It starts off interesting as there's a little mystery in who you are but then it kind of just fizzles. I would even suggest that the ending wouldn't be so bad if it were one a few options for endings? Not every game needs multiple endings to be good but I feel this one would benefit from it.

I did still basically enjoy my time spent but again, only because I got it on sale.


*MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS BELOW*


To be more specific, while I understand Belladonna's actions come from a place of grief, she's still a murderer and I had no desire to help her. (I also hate that I was forced to kill the cat, wtf?) I may have gotten behind her choice to build what is basically a zombie army had the game explored her reasoning more thoroughly but it seems like she's working out of vengeance and a desire to prove a point? Why no qualms about using Lucas's brain? Speaking of Lucas, I thought he was basically a baby when he died so what use would his brain be? Why can't Karla talk her out of it? 

Returning to my point of potential multiple endings, none of my questions were answered but they could be if there were multiple endings. One where you agree with Belladonna, one where you don't and leave/talk her out of her plans, and maybe one where you don't agree but can't talk her out of her plans and so you just wait for her to run down and throw her key in a lake or something. Seriously, this game has a lot of potential but basically feels unfinished especially since there's nothing else to do in the form of puzzles/hidden object areas that usually accompany point and clicks.",1454151642,1454151781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

How you may ask? 

In the first section of the game, if a 90 minute game can be said to have sections, your primary task is gathering journal pages. There are point and click puzzles, but to anyone who plays point and clicks, they pose no real obstacle. Anyway, the journals tell an interesting Frankenstein story that I would pay $1 or so for. I bought the game at $0.50, so at least I feel I got my money's worth.

After you finish reading the romantic horror story depicted in the journal, and wishing there was more story to read, the game takes a hard left turn to making a horrific undead army of mad science. The sudden tone shift is jarring. And then the sequence lasts barely 15 minutes, just long enough to lose the earlier focus, but not long enough to deal with the repercussions of such thinking.

The history and character information are fleshed out via journal pages/letters that you find while exploring. Each story is intriguing, with maybe one or two unexpected, little twists. While the style of the fonts were pretty, they were sometimes hard to read, but even I -- with glasses several years old -- read them just fine.

The music went well with the art style, and I appreciated some of the more dramatic moments. The voice acting was pretty good, not over-the-top or cheesy at all. Mechanics were easy and intuitive.

The setting is well done, a nice old castle with big rooms, and the artwork is pretty good.  The small amounts of music included are decent as well, although the semi-jump scare reveal music tends to play over the other sounds, lessening it's impact. But the game has too many flaws and issues to recommend at full price.

First of all, it's incredibly short. I beat the entire thing in less than an hour and a half, and didn't push myself to go quickly. The extra time is from me letting it run overnight to get trading cards. The primary voice actor for your character is pretty good, but her voice doesn't match the creepy gothic environment. She sounds like a modern, 21st century female, not a recently brought back from the dead monstrosity. But that's not the worst of it. The second voice actor is atrocious, with a faux British accent that is poorly done and not consistently performed. Some of the sound effects are ridiculous. One of them is literally the AIM log on sound for a door opening. The environments feel fairly sterile; except for a few of the more elaborate rooms, most are barren and uninteresting, despite being well rendered.

The story isn't too complicated, and it's revealed mostly through journal pages you find scattered throughout the house you're exploring. There is a bit of mystery, but no major twist or huge intrigue once you figure out who the major players in the story are. It does weirdly go past what would be the natural conclusion, then turns around and ends much too abruptly. And the puzzles are all quite easy, with the protagonist often explaining what needs to be done through her commentary. It's annoying when you think ""I knew that!"" but don't get the full satisfaction of having figured it out.

Belladona isn't terrible, but it's not all that good. Still, it's frequently in bundles or hugely discounted, and it's worth a look if you can get it for a buck or less, as I did.",1453951663,1453951663,False,4,0,0.560439586639404297,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Its a pixel hunter but its short, so that isnt a problem.

The puzzles are quite easy, so no head scratching there, which may/may not appeal to people.

It ends on a cliffhanger, dunno if the devs are still working on this game, no sign of them on the forum, which does not bode well, so if a cliffhanger doesnt appeal, then dont buy this game.

The story is told as you walk through rooms in a castle, collecting little notes that form a journal of sorts, depicting two sides of the story, its an interesting story, but due to the ending, there is no payoff. The writing is annoyingly small, making reading a bit of a chore.

BTW The game is about 90 mins long, but the developers have done some bogus programming that wont allow cards to drop untilnthe game has run for many hours, eg.

I can forgive a game when it's short (here it's about 45mins clicking on everything and taking my time) if there is something about it that it so unique, compelling, fun or just a wonderful story.  Sadly here it doesn't deliver on any of these.

Yes the artwork is beautiful, but very few scenes to admire. There is a character voiceover and  I loved how the story unfolded through journal entries.  The story starts out very promising if predictable but instead of continuing and ending on a more poignant note, from out of nowhere it descended into a silly farce that wasn't witty or funny enough to pull it off even if your like that type of story.

I don't even mind that there were no puzzles or even that it was so easy if there was something else to focus on but the story alone wasn't strong or good enough to carry it.

The one thing that really annoyed me and I feel I shoud warn people that would care about animal cruelty/distress in games is that you have to [spoiler]  kill a cat.

It assumes the guise of a typical point-and-click adventure game, but the puzzles are much too easy and I spent as much time reading the in-game 'letters' (journal pages) as I did playing the game. I guess it's best described as a cross between a visual novella and a short adventure game. Regardless of how one might best categorise it, I found it somewhat lacking at the end, and it left me thinking, ""Now what?""

The plot is interesting, very much like Frankenstein, as you will already have gathered from the Steam game page's description, but isn't followed through to a satisfying resolution. It's almost as if the developers ran out of time and finished it before they'd really got into their stride. Certainly in the short timeframe in which you'll play the game -- it took me 67 minutes to complete the game; the rest of my Steam-reported game time is idling for the remainder of the trading cards -- there's no opportunity for in-depth character development or anything but the most obvious plotline.

The graphics are good: cartoony, with an attractive visual style reminiscent of many point-and-click adventure games. The main character is reasonably well animated and the title screen is particularly attractive. The few still images present in the game are well done as well.

Sound is so-so. Music is good and sets the mood for the game. Voices are not so good. Or rather, they're okay, but don't fit the characters at all well. The main character sounds like a well-spoken, but somewhat pretentious American teen, whereas the other voice (yes, there are only two in the game) is a bit mumbly and not so well spoken. Given the roles they are meant to represent, the voices really don't fit.

So, overall, I was disappointed by Belladonna. I had expected more than what I received, but what was there was, on the whole, pretty good. It's just a shame there wasn't more. It doesn't really offer anything new, but it is quite nice all the same.

I recommend it, but with the caveat that you should take into account the very short play time.

However, for the price I paid for the game (I bought it on sale), I felt I received what I deserved from it.

Otherwise, I rather enjoyed this game. It's got this gothic romance vibe that borrows from the works of Poe and Mary Shelley.

I liked the story, but again, I wish there was something more substatial to it. The protagonist was likable and easy to form an attachment to, despite how short the game is.

If you consider this game a short story, its for the best. Its a small tale of lost love and love beyond death. there is no big developments or big twists. you character is the center of the narrative and uncovering what happened to you makes the story goes foward. small as a short tale should be. 


But, specially because of the whole inspiration from Frankenstein, you can't help to wonder what if the developers decided to do a Novel instead of a short story. what if we could see each and every detail of how that final illustration came to be. what if there was more! in that regard, being so short takes from the enjoyment, specially if you consider most playthroughs are supposed to last more than 1 hour.

other than that, the game tells too much instead of showing, but that is a problem even with AAA games out there. being a bit heavy on exposition does makes to comparisson to a short story or novel stronger tough.

on the sound department, its excelent. the soundtrack does convey the right mood at the right time. perfect. nothing much to add.

If you're a fan of old school click and play (point and click) titles you might find Belladonna to be disappointing. Not because it deviates from norms set by the classics but because it doesn't even try. If you've read the other reviews stating the shortness to be a good thing, well then imagine a game that's not even an hour long, has a very corny story, disappointing abrupt end and has no puzzles to be solved at all.[/h1]

[h1]In long: [/h1]

That's right. There are no puzzles left for the player to solve. The only ones you encounter are either so simple or outright explained and solved by the protagonist herself as she speaks to herself, leaving you no room to experiment or even ponder what you ought to be doing. I've never played an adventure game this easy in my life unless you count games targeted to toddlers with similar game mechanics. I would argue those games to be even more cerebral experiences than Belladonna.

The staple, the hallmark of a good adventure game to me has always been that they force the player to think outside of the box. A constant effort must be made by the player to figure out what to do. Careful and most importantly thoughtful game design is needed to keep the player entertained in these type of games. That combined with a vivid and interesting story, a deep mystery, or simply a protagonist that is interesting / quirky and full of character are also very important in a genre that only uses the left mouse click to play it. Belladonna has none of that. There is a mystery there but it's not meant to be solved. The game simply makes you read journal pages that explain it and that's it. The only difficulty in the game is finding an item (if you even missed it -- they are very easy to find) or trying to read the journal pages as the font is set to be so small it makes your eyes bleed.

The only positive I can give to the game is the art design. It's hard to explain just how little is in this game though. In the store page there are 7 backgrounds shown. The game only has about 12 of them, so it basically shows you over 50% of the game's scenery right there. There are also no cutscenes. Sometimes the game just fades to black and we get to hear sounds as if they couldn't finish the game or the artist couldn't bother drawing vital scenes in the game. I mean the entire ending has no cutscene at all. It just fades to black, we hear a few corny lines and then we get to see someone's doodle with the words ""The End"" on it.

The music is good. The very little there is. I mean I can't complain about it so my only memory of it is that it didn't bother me. It sets a tone and keeps it there. The voice acting is ok. You won't be moved by the characters at all since they are devoid of any. I can't blame the voice actors at all as the writing seems very corny. The game sets a good atmosphere at first in the beginning, but immediately breaks it by having joke descriptions when you inspect objects more than once (a staple in adventure games yes -- but very out of place in the games milieu). If you establish that the main character is a ""tabula rasa"" an empty slate, but then she makes quirky Monkey Island esque remarks, you just destroyed all the character you worked so hard to establish right of the bat.

[b]Final thoughts (and story spoilers):[/b]

Belladonna is a game that falls flat I'm afraid, unless all you're after is a short novel length story that's only twist is the protagonist discovering a note that tells her she was a lesbian when she was alive and the lover of the only other character in the game and that's it. That's it! No character arc, no nothing. It's disappointing because it's established early on that she has no memories, no personality and possibly no emotions at all and is basically an empty slate. Yet she reads a note left by her living self and instantly she's now the person she used to be I guess. 

It would've been so much more interesting if the game actually played with these concepts rather than just introduce them and then take the short route out. The game could've made strong statements about sexuality and the human persona, what it is to be a human and to exist. But it doesn't. It just says ""o-oh... I'm a lesbian? L-lewd!"" and then gives you an ending drawing out of a b-movie with the main character in a slave esque pose under another woman like she just accepted it no problems at all. The game begins ""tabula rasa"" and ends ""tabula rasa"".

The most disappointing fact is that the game teases with a lot of good philosophical questions and hints at many possible interesting side effects of what it might be like to be a reanimated human being. But then it doesn't even explore them. It's like there's two lines of the main character pondering about possibly being a sociopath after killing a cat and then talking about it with another character and then this is entirely forgotten. The ending of the game is also insanely cheesy and left me even more disappointed.

I can't recommend this game to anyone. Sorry.

The character art is atrocious.  Who has a neck that freaking long!?  There are only two characters in the game (apart from the ludicrous end image) and I can only assume they were reanimated through silly putty.
The voice acting is just terrible.  Well, alright, it's more fair to say that the acting is completely out of place for this setting, and the same goes for the script itself.  ""This oil looks expensive.  Let's waste it!""  No.
The music is... fine, until it decides something dramatic happened.
The story itself is fairly good until you reach the climax, after which it's all downhill.
I can say that the background art is good.  The gothic style is very well done, but unfortunately there is pixel hunting to be done for some of the necessary items, which is never fun.

I always mess about going back and forth all over games in my first playthroughs to see if there are Easter eggs to be found, even when it's so obvious what the next move is, and in this game it is always obvious, not just because the puzzles are easy, but they're also signposted in the dialogue.

Its good points are as follows:

- interesting storyline/nicely written, if a little (read a lot) derivative
- reasonable voice acting
- nicely drawn backgrounds
- a sense of vague mystery as to the identity of your protagonist
- a nice game to get the uninitiated into adventure games

- such a short game, I almost feel like I could have completed it within half an hour on my first try if I wanted
- very dissatisfying ending
- only two NPCs with which you can interact, and one of them doesn't talk. A third NPC is dead, if that counts
- the puzzles are so easy your average seven-year-old probably wouldn't struggle
- I've seen better background animation
- I've seen better characterization
- it's non-sale price is ridiculously high for what the game offers
- not a particularly original storyline
- protagonist walks so slowly, at least something that increases game time but one of my pet hates
- not many explorable areas
- hardly any meta (at most I think two observations per object)
- virtually nothing you can observe/comment on that's not essential to completion
- virtually no humour

Der Spieler erwacht in einem Labor als wiedererweckte Gestalt und macht sich auf den Weg herauszufinden was mit ihm (bzw ihr) passiert ist.
Dabei sammelt man Notizen, welche einem Aufschluss darüber geben, was passiert ist. Nebenher löst man noch Rätsel, in dem man in bekannter Manier Dinge aufnimmt, kombiniert und wieder verwendet.
Belladonna bietet in dieser Hinsicht zwar keinerlei Neuheiten, ist aber dennoch angenehm zu spielen, hat keine Fehler und ist schön anzusehen und schnell verständlich.
Leider etwas kurz für eingefleischte Adventure-Spieler.
Die Geschichte ist etwas makaber (wie bei Frankenstein zu erwarten), allerdings ist bis auf etwas Blut und das Vergiften eines Tieres keine sichtbare Gewalt im Spiel.

Positiv:
+ Optisch sehr schön
+ Interessante Geschichte
+ Leicht zu bedienen
+ Handlung klar und fließend
+ Keine Bugs / Glitches
+ Sprachausgabe (bis auf längere Texte (Notizen))
+ Sammelkarten

Negativ:
- etwas kurz, daher ist der Preis doch stattlich
- keine Achievements (wären für bestimmte Abschnitte nett)

Trivia:
- Referenz zu Mary Shelly's Frankenstein
- Ein Rabe (Edgar Allen Poe) sitzt auf einer Büste über der Türe

Fazit:
Bis auf die kurze Spielzeit ein gelungenes Spiel. Wenn es im Angebot ist oder in einem Bundle kommt, unbedingt zugreifen!

By 'short' I mean it took me only 1.8 hours to complete the game.
Although the story is interesting it might make some players feel uncomfortable at times,
as it features a lesbian romance which involves the death of your former husband, the need to break open a sarcophagus and decapitating the corpse inside with a bonesaw, etc. What I personally disliked the most, is that you have to kill a cat in order to proceed...

Aside from that Belladona is quite an enjoyable experience. The difficulty is easy, as most of the puzzles are very straight-forward and require just a minimum of logical thinking. So the game felt more like an interactive storybook to me than a classical point&click adventure, a fact that I liked. The voice acting was great, too, as it suited the main character especially well. The plot is transported through various notes scattered around the game environment, while being perfectly fine to me, some players might prefer the story to be shown to them...
What I also noticed is, that the spelling of some characters' names is not consistent,
meaning that the same person is sometimes called 'Franziska', another
time it's 'Franzeska'. Not sure if I got something wrong there, though...

Hand-drawn graphism really beautiful, with a lot of details, a sucessfull creepy atmosphere and nice music work. I really enjoyed to elvolve in this particular world.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

It's a pure point-and-click with a few easy puzzles to solve and collect journal pages all over the castle to know more about your story. More a reading game than adventure one.

- Really good atmosphere and world
- Nice story

- Extremely short. It deserves to be longer, with more areas to discover, puzzles to solve... The end of the game invites us to hope for more, like a prologue.

Worth $3-4 - More if it was longer.

Ultimately, the game is cheap, and as I got it in a bundle it cost me pennies, so I can't really hate it. For the price, it's probably about what I'd expect. It's a nice way to kill time for an hour, and once you start playing, you'll want to finish purely to confirm that your guess is correct regarding what happened. That doesn't mean it deserves a recommendation though.

The biggest problem I had with the game was the length. You can probably complete this in an hour, or 2 if you're like me and a) can't see for toffee and continually walk past one of the items tens of time, and b) spend half of it looking for secrets, of which there are none. The story progresses very quickly, and although it's interesting, it loses points for it's inability to keep you in anticipation of the ending. Not even half way in, and you can guess easily enough what happened.

It also isn't difficult. I didn't read anything about the game when I started, so I wasn't too sure what I was getting myself into, but I expected jump scares and hiding from a murderer or something along those lines, but there's none of that. There are technically puzzles in it, but they are so obvious that they require no thought. The items are easy to find, (though there was one that I just couldn't notice for a while), so most of them you're likely to have picked up on your way through already, so there isn't a lot of back tracking like you would expect for a game like this. The entire area you can explore is very small as well.

Another big one for me was the voice acting. The voices didn't match the characters, and they truly sounded staged. I don't know who did the voices, but it sounded like they picked someone random from the street, or perhaps the game makers used their own voices. It was off putting.

The ending was also rushed. You'll have everything already once you get the final objective, with the exception of one item which is already explained to you how to get, so you don't even need to work for it. You get them, do the thing, and it's suddenly over. The ending truly was not satisfying at all.

One thing I did like was the artwork, it suited the story quite a lot, though it could have been animated a lot better.

It's unfortunate that the ending wasn't really set up for a continuation, at the length it is it'd be better if it was just one chapter of a larger story. This game would be vastly improved if they increased the playing time, added a lot more exploration, added some difficult puzzles, and perhaps a mad murderer you had to avoid to keep you on your toes.


SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER 
SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER 



There was one thing that bugged me in this. You get a key from the dead body of the husband. The key unlocks a box containing another key. That key is used to wind up the wife. The wife says the reason she couldn't wind herself up is because the key on her back is placed out of her reach, so only someone else can wind her up. This suggests that she had access to the key. Then why did she lock it up and put the smaller key on the husbands body, whome she hated? It makes no sense. It'd perhaps make more sense if she just changed the line to: ""I couldn't wind myself up because I didn't have access to the key"", but if she had time to do the experiment, wouldn't she at least have time to look for the key on the corpse?

And since I'm spoiling anyway, there's another annoying thing about the story. The maid wrote a note suggesting she was falling out of love with the wife, but if you try to mention it to the wife, she decides against telling it in the end.

There are 18 notes total, 9 by Dr. Wolfram von Trauerschloss (Trauerschloss means Mourning Castle in German) 5 before and 4 after the reanimation of his wife, 4 by his wife, Belladonna while she was alive, 4 by Belladonna after she is reanimated, and 1 by her faithful servant, Klara Seiber.

Most reviewers state that this is a short game and it is.  I finished in 119 minutes (and I am slow) but was quite satisfied by the story told.  It was like reading a short story or novella.  The end was a bit truncated I thought and not seemingly appropriate until thought about.  Yet how else could it have ended but the way it did.  The epilogue is a single screenshot the credits play over, and picture shows everything that needs to be stated.  

Reviewers complain about having to READ.  Really? Seriously?  18 handwritten journal pages are too much??  And 1 has only a few words on it.  Plus the questions/dialogue near the end that explains so much motivationally, ethically, and morally. That was too much to read??? (Sighs in disbelief and shakes head).

There are no puzzles.  (Really there are none despite other reviewers saying there are.)

- Gothic and twisted? Sure. Horror? Not so much.
- Text heavy (in journal, which you have to read to fully understand the situation).

-good voice acting

Belladonna is a mixed bag overall: its story is pretty good and slowly uncovering what happened and who you are by reading through journal pages is an engaging, albeit short-lived, process. Puzzles, on the other hand, are so easy and straightforward that the gameplay suffers as a consequence, there just isn't any challenge.

Venturing through the castle, you collect notes from the doctor and his wife, revealing a morbid little story between them. There are a handful of inventory items to scrounge up to solve a smaller handful of puzzles, as well as some awkwardly-voiced dialogue to enjoy.

...And that's it. The game is 30 minutes long. I struggled a bit with whether I thought it was worth it, and in the end I decided it was. The animation is not much past Flash level but the art is clean and the look of the castle is a stark modern gothic that I haven't really seen elsewhere.

She wakes up in a laboratory, not knowing who she is or what she is, but exhibits joy of discovery & curiosity rather than fear. Her character traits quickly emerge, like the urge to name things (suit of armor? must be Roland the Poet:) making her the more fleshed out.

The story is quite simple, but still graceful & interesting. We learn most of it by reading torn out journal pages, which are well written & well paced out. Some additional information comes from interacting with objects or looking at things. Her commentaries about the surroundings are quite enjoyable, even if they have nothing to do with the plot itself.

I liked it myself, hence the thumbs up, but it has one major flaw - length. This is very short game. If you read everything carefully and listen to the protagonist's every comment on every subject, you still will finish it under an hour. It's is also quite easy, especially if you pay attention to what is said (the main character will often hint herself as what to do next), so you basically breeze through it, which just intensifies the length problem. 
Also personal & really minor gripe - card settings. I basically finished game 3 times when I hit 2 hour mark and first card dropped, and then I left it idle, but cards seem to be set do drop every half an hour or more, so I had to idle over 5 hour mark to obtain them all, in a game that takes under 1 hour to complete (and that's only if you try hard to prolong the experience).

Минусы – Они незначительны, но есть за что пожурить разработчика. Во-первых, игра очень коротка. Цена соответствующая, но история настолько интересна, что хотелось бы побольше часов геймплея чем от силы час (я жду выпадения всех карточек, поэтому у меня наигранно больше). Во-вторых, в плане сюжета нам выдали очень сырую и скомканную концовку. Она откровенна скучна и не стоит этой игры. Ну и есть три мелочи. Когда делаешь скриншот, то тебя обязательно выбивает в главное меню. Конечно легко вернуться назад, нажав Новая игра, а затем Esc, но механизм вообще странный. Иногда текст в дневниках становится слишком мелким. Ну и для любителей квестов игра наверное противопоказана. Потому что они взвоют от того, насколько лёгкие тут загадки. Квест для тех, кто не любит квесты.
Плюсы – Сюжет. Путь в самом конце он скатывается в неимоверную глупость, и в итоге ты сидишь перед экраном и говоришь «Это всё??», но всё же в течении игры следить за ним весьма и весьма интересно. А подача его через дневники разных персонажей просто превосходна. Сама же главная героиня готова подробно прокомментировать почти каждый интересный для нас объект интерьера. А где хороший сюжет частенько и атмосфера хорошая, верно? Ну по крайней мере, тут именно так. Игра напоминает серию Amnesia, пусть и пытается быть похожей больше на готические романы. Безлюдный замок, заснеженное кладбище, комнаты с покрытой белой тканью мебелью, жуткая лаборатория в подвале, живая оранжерея… Превосходные локации, что ещё сказать. Да и рисовка весьма и весьма симпатичная – напоминает мультфильмы от студии Дисней.
Итог – Если Вы покупаете игру загадок ради, то Вас круто обломают с их лёгкостью в данной игре (главная героиня порой даже прямые подсказки даёт). Но если Вам нравилась вторая игра серии Amnesia за её историю, Вы любите читать дневники персонажей с их душевными терзаниями и готовы пожертвовать геймплеем ради интересной, красивой и немного жуткой истории, то игра для Вас.",1443969858,1443969858,True,22,1,0.619468629360198975,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is very short, I've done it in less than 1.5 hours reading all the letters and staring on every scene to enjoy it's beauty. The drawings are great in this game and strangely it seems like different scenes are drawn by different artists, at least 2-3 of them. Dut despite all these beauty it's only like 10 or so scenes in this game which is not much. As for the gameplay it's more like a story-driven waling simulator in a form of an adventure game. Yes it has more than just walking around but believe me it's barely 15-20 usable items in the game so it doesn't make any difference. Also the use of items is very logical which is a plus of course but the minus is you use it immediately very often, few pixels away from the place you found them.

Overall the story is interesting though not very original, game is well-made, art-style is great, diary pages are entertaining ro read but the game is very easy, short and lacks actual gameplay and also the game almost has no ending and looks like devs wanted to make more but decided to just cut the game to the The End screen at some point.",1443267573,1443267888,True,1,0,0.502617835998535156,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Vous vous réveillez dans une cave où d'étranges expériences semblent avoir été perpétrées. Vous ne savez pas qui vous êtes ni ce que vous êtes et vous allez devoir explorer la grande demeure qui s'offre à vous pour comprendre les mystères de votre mort et de votre retour à la vie.

Le jeu se présente comme un point & click classique et vous évoluerez dans des décors peints à la main agréables à parcourir bien qu'il n'y aura pas énormément de tableaux différents étant donné la courte durée de vie du jeu. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520395736 Les animations sont un peu plus maladroites et rigides mais rien de bien alarmant. L'atmosphère qui se dégage du jeu est empreinte de mystère et les pages des journaux que l'on ramasse au fur et à mesure de notre progression attestent d'une histoire sordide et glauque. 

Votre aventure est jonchée de beaucoup d'écrits qui comptent pour plus de la moitié de votre temps de jeu. Ces textes ne sont pas disponibles en français et il vaudra mieux avoir un bon niveau d'anglais pour bien comprendre les secrets qu'ils recèlent. La durée de vie du jeu sera donc directement fonction de votre niveau d'anglais et de votre aisance à lire dans cette langue, cela pourra aller d'une à deux heures. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520395777 En tout cas, ce ne sont pas les puzzles qui jalonnent votre parcours qui vous retiendront bien longtemps car ceux-ci sont très simples et peu nombreux.

La [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPC3OqHV2Qw]musique du jeu est bonne[/url], composée dans un style classique elle reflète bien l'atmosphère froide et énigmatique du jeu. Les doublages sont quant à eux très corrects, à ce niveau là Belladonna s'en tire bien.

Là où Belladonna souffre un peu plus c'est sur de petits détails techniques comme l'absence d'options dans le menu ou l'impossibilité de reprendre la partie (notamment si on tente de prendre une capture d'écran car on est alors renvoyés au menu de démarrage, il est bien sûr rapide de rejouer la partie pour retourner à notre emplacement précédent une fois les textes lus et les énigmes connues mais c'est tout de même embêtant). http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520395813 Pour finir sur un aspect en demi-teinte, la fin du jeu est quelque peu abrupte et laisse perplexe pendant un temps, non pas qu'on ne comprenne pas les tenants et les aboutissants du scénario, tout est limpide ce côté là mais on aurait voulu en voir un peu plus.

Belladonna est clairement un jeu qui n'avait pas beaucoup de budget et qui a quelques failles qu'elles soient techniques ou plutôt dues à sa construction pas assez équilibrée entre lecture et gameplay, il n'en reste pas moins une aventure plaisante certes pas inoubliable mais tout de même sympathique à parcourir de par l'atmosphère lugubre qu'elle dégage et les secrets qu'elle recèle.

Es kann zwar auch ziemlicher Mist dabei herauskommen – zum Beispiel wenn Sherlock Holmes plötzlich mit Drachen kämpfen muss (damit ist im Übrigen kein Spiel gemeint, sondern ein literarischer Erguss, auf den ich an dieser Stelle nicht weiter eingehen werde) – doch hin und wieder entstehen echte Hits.

Belladonna basiert auf der Geschichte um Dr. Frankenstein, kombiniert mit Steampunk-Elementen. Man schlüpft in die Rolle einer [b]wiedererweckten Leiche ohne Erinnerung[/b] auf der Suche nach der Wahrheit über die jüngsten Ereignisse im Schloss des Dr. Wolfram.
 Als Spieler muss man hauptsächlich die [b]Geschichte rekonstruieren[/b], indem man überall im Haus verstreut herumliegende Tagebucheinträge sammelt.

Noch dazu ist die Anzahl der betretbaren Wohnräume und vorhandenen Gegenstände überschaubar. Wer nach kniffligen Aufgaben sucht ist hier falsch, der Fokus liegt klar auf der erzählten Geschichte.

Lediglich der Stil der Protagonisten ist deutlich klarer und undetaillierter ausgefallen und sticht somit etwas negativ heraus. Die Musik ist top und besonders in Schlüsselszenen perfekt eingesetzt; die Sounds können sich ebenfalls sehen lassen.
Ein großes Manko gibt es jedoch: das Ende kommt schnell und abrupt. [b]Viel länger als eine Stunde braucht man zu Komplettierung nicht[/b]. Es kommt einem so vor, als hätten die Entwickler selbst nicht gewusst, wie man die Geschichte zu einem vernünftigen Abschluss bringen kann. Hat man alle Tagebuchseiten gesammelt, folgt ein etwas längeres Gespräch, man löst ein Rätsel und wird prompt von einem „The End“-Bild überrascht. Dann sitzt man minutenlang paralysiert vom Rechner und fragt sich ob das ein Scherz sein soll.

Nun ja, man kann nicht alles haben. Vom perfekten Spiel ist Belladonna hauptsächlich aufgrund der [b]Kürze[/b] und des [b]abrupten Endes[/b], das es unfertig wirken lässt, noch entfernt.

Mając za sobą wyjaśnienie pora na nieco więcej szczegółów.

Belladonna to gra typu Point&Click czyli przygodówka w której sterujemy naszą postacią i rozwiązujemy wszystkie zagadki za pomocą prostych kliknięć myszką w odpowiednie przedmioty. Już na wstępie jednak wypada mi ponownie zaznaczyć że jest to bardzo króciutka gierka, więc jeśli zależy Ci na kilkunastu godzinach rozgrywki to niestety nic z tego. Gra starcza na jakąś godzinę.
W grze wcielamy się w kobiecą postać, która natychmiast kojarzy się nam z Frankensteinem i tym razem nie jest to w żadnym wypadku zły trop. Po tym jak obudzimy się w labolatorium jako nieumarłe monstrum, naszym zadaniem jest ustalić to kim jesteśmy, kto powołał nas do życia i jaki jest nasz dalszy cel istnienia, a odpowiedzi na te pytania wywalczymy sobie za pomocą rozwiązywania zagadek w pewnej posiadłości i jej okolicach. Niestety albo i stety, zagadki jakie przyjdzie nam rozwiązać są... naprawdę proste. Żadna z zagadek nie zajęła mi więcej niż minutę czy dwie myślenia. Proste łączenie przedmiotów, obserwacja otoczenia i tyle, utknąć tu byłoby naprawdę trudno. Dla jednych to zapewne plus, ale dla mnie, czyli osoby która przeszła dziesiątki klasycznych przygodówek, prezentowany tutaj poziom był po prostu za niski i nie odczułem nawet najmniejszej satysfakcji z rozwiązania którejkolwiek z zagadek.
Jeśli chodzi o prezencje Audio-Wizualną - tu jest akurat całkiem nieźle. Grafika to dość proste rysunki 2d, jednak mają swój niewątpliwy urok i ciekawy dość abstrakcyjny styl. Wszystkie przedmioty z którymi możemy wejść w interakcje, dość dobrze się wyróżniają przez co większość z lokacji zobaczymy tylko z 2-3 razy jako że więcej nie będziemy musieli się cofać by znaleźć przedmiot który pominęliśmy.
Muzyka w grze jest niespecjalna. Nie przeszkadza ale i nie zapada w pamięć. Efekty dźwiękowe są jak najbardziej ok i wszystko brzmi w sumie tak jak powinno, nie ma na co narzekać. Za to swoistą gwiazdą audio jak i zresztą całej gry jest głos naszej bohaterki, przyjemny dla ucha, odpowiednio modulowany w zależności od sytuacji czy sprawdzanego przedmiotu i co najważniejsze jest w tym wszystkim odrobina humoru. Niestety już tego samego poziomu nie prezentuje druga postać z którą przyjdzie nam zamienić kilka słów.

Po za tym o grze nie ma się specjalnie co rozpisywać. Klasyczny Point&Click ze świetnie zdubbingowaną postacią naszej głównej bohaterki. Odrobina zbierania porozrzucanych stron dzienników dla fanów dodatkowej warstwy fabularnej, po za tym naprawdę banalne łamigłówki i tyle. Mniej więcej godzina całkiem przyjemnej zabawy, ale nic ponad to niestety.
Jeśli po tych słowach uważasz że gra najpewniej przypadnie Ci do gustu, to śmiało, nie zawiedziesz się, no chyba że długością samej gry, w przeciwnym wypadku... Śmiało omiń tą produkcję nie tracisz wiele ;)

Belladonna is a game that revolves around 3 characters:
- The Scientist (I can't remember his name, so I'll call him Scientist Dude)
- Belladonna (The Scientist's wife)
- Klara (Belladonna's maid)
The introduction is that Scientist Dude and his wife Belladonna live in this big mansion place, the wife has a son (Lucas) that dies soon after birth. Scientist Dude and his wife start becoming distant, with Scientist Dude always in the basement and his wife always upstairs staring out a window. The mansion starts falling apart, with many of the servants quitting, until only one is left, Klara. Klara and Belladonna have a thing for each other. Scientist Dude has learned the secrets of reanimation (Frankenstein stuff).

What I enjoyed about this game:
- the art style
- the music
- the chilling/spooky parts (even though you can always tell when one of these is about to happen because normally the screen shifts automatically while you move but these parts it doesn't until you get close to the edge and the area obviously has more to it that it isn't showing immediately)
- the idea in the story of same-sex romance (which is rarely featured in games)
- the idea in the story of clockwork reanimated people
- The attention to detail in some parts, (Spoiler here!) [spoiler]after you collect all the parts for reanimating the dead scientist, the stairs leading to the basement get a bloodstain on them, suggesting Belladonna dragged the body down the steps.[/spoiler]  
- How you have to figure out the story for yourself, as not much is revealed to you without collecting the journal pages. I also liked how the end of the story is revealed first, then everything leading up to that point.

What I didn't enjoy about this game:
- The majority of the voice acting. It seems forced, usually without emotions. (especially the very first lines. They are really weak and made me want to stop playing in the first 30 seconds). Occasionally there is obvious cuts that don't sound too good.
- The attention to detail in some other parts. (Spoiler here, again!) [spoiler]when i was told to collect the things to reanimate the scientist, I didn't ask any questions at first because I THOUGHT I knew where everything was. After collecting the brain, your character says something about having all the parts, even though I had not found all of them yet.[/spoiler]
- The shortness of the game. I could see why someone who bought this game for full value might be a bit frustrated.
- With the shortness mentioned, I hated the ending. It was abrupt, and I felt like alot more could be said. There is a difference between a suspensful cliffhanger that keeps you guessing but still satisfies (think Inception) and an ending that is so sudden that it literally gives you a picture of what ends up happening, which is what this game did. The last thing happens, and the 'The End' screen shows a single picture that defines the future, no making up stuff allowed!

In the end, I have to say I did enjoy this game, although it should have been longer and not had such a rushed, sudden, and unimaginative ending.

Point-and-click adventures were a dead genre. And not unlike the protagonist of [i]Belladonna[/i], they didn’t stay dead forever. In a sea of modern adventures that eschew traditional puzzles in favor of character development and moral choices, I was interested in tackling a traditional point-and-click adventure game. Especially one with a horror aesthetic.

[i]Belladonna’s[/i] influences become obvious very early on. We start our game on a slab in a laboratory, suffering from amnesia, of course. We are a reanimated corpse and our goal is to piece together the events that lead to our initial demise. So you can see how Mary Shelley’s [i]Frankenstein[/i] plays a key role in the creation of this game, even before the game clumsily makes a reference to her within the first five minutes.

The laboratory we’re in happens to be housed inside the dungeon of a castle, occupied by Dr. Wolfram von Trauerschloss. Now if that name doesn’t sound silly to you, it’s probably because you don’t speak German, because “Trauerschloss” literally translates to “Mourning Castle”. So you can see why this was one of the early warning signs about this title, for me at least. The good doctor, true to his inspiration, tinkers with the elements of life to bring back recently deceased organisms. 

Unfortunately, we don’t really see him do that. You see, [i]Belladonna[/i] is more of an investigative story than one we’re directly involved with. We’re here to run around the castle, looking for clues and objects to solve puzzles and uncover what actually happened. That means, we’ll be collecting a handful of journal entries that explain to us the events and character motivations. It’s a rather clumsy attempt at delivering a story, mostly relying on exposition instead of actual story development. The problem with this however is, besides being a rather weak writing tool, that a lot of what we’re reading easily foreshadows upcoming revelations. This makes the story seem to be a paint-by-numbers affair, which it actually is, and does little to engage the player. 

This is only further exacerbated by the fact that almost every interaction with this world seems to yield a “funny” response from our main character. The game obviously follows the example made by the old LucasArts games, but unfortunately it undermines the gothic horror atmosphere the rest of the game wants to invoke. And the reason I put “funny” in quotation marks is because the humor constantly falls flat. Besides, this isn’t a funny story, none of the elements are amusing at all. This is a story about personal loss, about tragedy, interpersonal relationships, envy and madness. Disconnected, sarcastic humor doesn’t really fit well when contrasted with the serious nature of its themes.

This wouldn’t be a problem in most other games where gameplay is king, but unfortunately, adventure games rarely contain any gameplay outside of inventory management. If I’ve counted correctly, there are maybe 4 or 5 puzzles you have to solve, most of which have solutions that are immediately obvious to anyone playing. Inventory management is very basic, you can combine two objects in order to solve puzzles with the resulting combinations. And if that weren’t enough, the constant vocalizations of our protagonist makes the solutions even more obvious. We’re rarely required to get creative or think outside the box.

The only aspect that registered positively with me was the visual presentation. We find ourselves in a lovingly designed, very detailed environment that manages to give the game some semblance of a gothic horror atmosphere. And the music helps to underline that. But unfortunately, this is largely undone by the aforementioned tonal discrepancies between the world we’re in and the theoretical gravitas of the story, and the lighthearted nature of the simplistically written dialogue. 

Now some of you might be perplexed by the low number of puzzles presented to us and ask how long this journey through [i]Belladonna[/i] actually takes. And to be perfectly blunt, it takes less than an hour and 30 minutes. It’s a very short affair with no secrets, and the fact that the story is entirely linear also means that there’s literally no replay value. 

So at this point, the only thing I can say is that, in spite of its beautiful visuals and nice soundtrack, the game unfortunately doesn’t manage to capture the charm of popular point-and-click adventure games. The story would’ve had potential if it would’ve focused more on the more polarizing and grotesque elements in there, but in this state, you’re probably better off watching the Universal version of [i]Frankenstein[/i]. Or if you like a bit more humor in your horror, why not go for [i]Re-Animator[/i] instead? Because in the end, you’re about as passive in [i]Belladonna[/i] as you are while watching a movie.",1438795224,1438815754,False,5,0,0.471927434206008911,2,False,False,False,False,,,

This is a short point and click adventure game about a woman who wakes up reanimated in a dungeon and has to figure out what happened to her.

The story in these is interesting (if pretty scary and tragic) and told well, but the fonts chosen for each character are quite small and can be hard to read. It's a bit of a weakness that the player character has amnesia, since her relationship to the other characters is difficult to flesh out because she doesn't remember them. There's one particularly disturbing story thread that kind of ends up going nowhere for this reason. 

The puzzles are simple and logical for the most part. The only time I had slight difficulty progressing was when I couldn't find an object at the edge of a scene.

(At the end of the review I've added a note of what has been fixed).[/u]

[h1]Overview[/h1]
I have mixed views on Belladonna. On one hand the story is dark and intriguing and has pretty solid voice acting, but on the other it does not explore these themes in enough depth to make a lasting impression. I think this game is worth trying if you already got it on sale or in a bundle. My completion time was 1.5 hours, and the remaining time on my counter was for trading card drops.

[h1]Thoughts, story wise[/h1]
Belladonna explores some dark and mature themes, including life, death, murder and other moral issues. The game follows an animated corpse as she tries to find out about her past life and how she came to be in this state between being alive and dead. The dark and macabre nature of the story was interesting to me, and will interest those who are also fans of this type of story. I did enjoy unraveling the mysteries behind Belladonna as the story progresses, and some of the twisted revelations throughout the game I did find satisfying.

There are several shortcomings to this game, however, that prevented me from enjoying it as much as I felt I would. The story simply is too short and doesn't explore enough of the dark themes, and felt like a wasted potential. Play time isn't always the most important thing if there is enough emotional impact, but Belladonna felt very rushed at times, for example as some other reviews have mentioned, notably so near the ending.

[h1]Thoughts, game play wise[/h1]
Belladonna is certainly a point and click adventure game, but within this genre people do have different expectations. I would describe Belladonna as more as a story-exploration game with adventure game elements, that is the focus is more on the story while the puzzles are not very difficult, and do not take up much time. I personally do not mind this as there are other games I could play if I wanted a challenge, so as long you're not expecting some super difficult brain teasers you shouldn't be disappointed in this aspect.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I enjoyed the story of Belladonna, but felt there could have been much more to the game. If you enjoy dark, macabre stories and don't mind easy point and click puzzles, I think this game is worth picking up on sale or in a bundle, but no need to go out of your way to do so.

И некоторых женщин тоже*"". В этой игре слов идеально передан основной смысл истории: знакомые большинству из нас чувства и пороки - любовь, страсть, ненависть, гордыня, страх, отчаяние - порой заставляют людей делать ужасные вещи.

Начинается всё с того, что мёртвая девушка, как полагается без имени и памяти, приходит в себя и, кажется, перестаёт быть мёртвой. Судя по внешнему виду, сшита она на манер монстра Франкештейна из частей тел, а в голове у неё вращается заводной ключ. Предоставленная сама себе, девушка начинает изучать окружающую действительность в поисках ответов на многочисленные вопросы и постепенно восстанавливает цепочку произошедших событий. Причём событий одновременно и жутких, и забавных - наверняка автор и идеолог проекта Никлас Халлин вдохновлялся не только совсем уж мрачными готическими романами (пламенный привет Мэри Шелли), незнакомыми современным двоечникам, но и более доступными широкой публике образами, вроде сумасшедшей кукольной мультипликации того же Тима Бёртона. Да и положа руку на сердце, в процессе прохождения Belladonna воспринимаешь отнюдь не привычной приключенческой point&click-игрой. Скорее своеобразным анимационным фильмом с великолепным художественным исполнением, в котором позволяют покликать мышкой по интерьерам.

Нельзя забывать, что сюжет здесь существует сразу в двух агрегатных состояниях. Главная героиня исследует старинный особняк и активно делится своими соображениями и мыслями с нами, а временами даёт подсказки. Между тем на пути то и дело встречаются страницы дневника - их в обязательном порядке следует собрать и прочитать от корки до корки, чтобы понять предысторию (благо ничего сложного тут нет, записки аккуратно разложены на самых видных местах). И вот тогда история сложится из кубиков в цельное произведение, а мотивация и поступки персонажей встанут на свои места.

Единственное, за что хочется пожурить создателя, так это за небольшой хронометраж, чересур простые головоломки и несколько скомканную концовку. При неспешном прохождении игра заканчивается примерно через час реального времени. А ведь этого очень мало и просто напросто хочется продолжать пропитываться атмосферой готической сказки! Стоит Belladonna смешных денег, но лучше бы она была в два или три раза дороже, но длиннее. Хотя требовать невозможного от человека, работавшего практически в одиночку, не стоит. Да и сказка на то и сказка, чтобы помочь скоротать время перед сном.

А вторая и третья ""проблемы"" плавно вытекают из первой. Загадки логичны и прямолинейны, с ними справится даже начинающий игрок, только ступающий на тропу интерактивных приключений. Но в конкретном случае Neckbolt можно позволить некую безумную выходку, сеттинг обязывает. А вот с финалом сложнее: на мой взгляд, выбор очаровательная покойница сделала как-то слишком легко и непринуждённо, даже не по себе становится.

Хотя кто знает, что там в голове у этих кадавров...

It was simple, but don't fix what ain't broke.

There is an atmosphere of dread that is captured very well with the music, art, and voice acting. The story, while somewhat predictable after a few diary pages, was still chilling enough that I found myself cringing and being disgusted with every action I took. My character's questioning of her own actions and morals gave me a nice feeling of just how much this was inspired by Mary Shelley's work.

It was an appropriate love letter to Frankenstein. It really was.

Yet there are some things I should add that are huge, glaring downfalls in this game. The big reveal cutscene after dealing with the cat (UH. THANKS FOR THAT, BY THE WAY!) seems a bit awkward. The one character no longer seems to fit in with the artstyle of Belladonna and just looks out of place. We have all of this lovely art and...what? Yet this is easily overlooked. It's not very long and you'll get back to PRETTY! 2D! soon enough.

The largest concern is this game is ENTIRELY TOO SHORT. You will get to the end, not realize it, and reach the THE END screen and start bemoaning how this game deserved much longer. You're expecting the next phase of the game to begin, especially since your character seems to be wanting to voice her concerns, but...nothing! The puzzles, being simple enough as they are, make it feel as if this game needed much more time devoted to it.

Those are my gripes. Was it worth the $6.99 I paid? Probably not. Was it a good experience? Enough to write some cheesy fanfiction because you ripped my heart out.

This is the perfect game for those who want to start the adventure genre. Other games in this genre can be too difficult (from their puzzles), too long or too crazy (from their stories), but ""Belladonna"" is very well written, has some logic puzzles, nice characters and backgrounds. It is an ideal sample.

On the other hand, for adventure game veterans this game may seem too short (about an hour of gameplay) so it bites the fact of a little missed opportunity to add more environments, implement more puzzles, characters and dialogues. 
But after all, this game was made by one person - Niklas Hallina. So that explains the length of the game.

Despite the fact that this game is short and too easy for those who eat adventure games for breakfast ""Belladonna"" is very unique - the style, and the appearance of the main character - she is neither good nor bad and this adds some depth to the overall feeling.

Oh, and one more thing - the developer himself wrote somewhere on his website that his work is largely modeled not on other games, but on literature. I can say that this really feels, especially when reading pages torn from the diaries of ""Belladonnay.""

All in all, I highly recommend this game for people who appreciate atmosphere, characters and stories in any game. And those who only like long game and difficult puzzles may be disappointed.",1425161126,1666716085,True,10,0,0.594197571277618408,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I took a chance on this game, being newly released today, usually I don't purchase games I've never heard of but I couldn't resist the beautiful-yet-simplistic art style.  
The music and art style is probably the most enjoyable aspect of the game, and if you like Adventure Game Studio-style games you'll want to check this out. The story has a little room to be expanded on, and it would be nice if it had been a little longer than the barely an hour it took for me to play it (I was not rushing). 
This is, in my opinion, an art game.  

Those who enjoyed games like Dear Esther and Gone Home will enjoy the story.  The gameplay is mostly straightforward and relies on the player investing personal interest in the story between the characters.   The voice acting is good, though I could see some being frustrated at the fact that many of the longer sections of text had no voice over.

http://youtu.be/gel7-YrL4P0

The story, without spoiling too much, takes place in a old seemingly abandoned castle somewhere in Europe.
You wake up in the castles basement surrounded by ghoulish scientific experiments and you soon realize to be one of those experiments. A living corpse basically.

As you suffer from videogame amnesia, not really surprising considering that you have clockwork machine in you're head and being dead, you must explore the castle to find out what took place there.

Gameplay is what you would expect from a point and click. Point. Click.
The game will have you to also combine items you find in the level as one would expect.
Some puzzles are present, but they are not that challenging.

The story is nothing special, but it is enjoyable and I found myself to wanting to know more on what's going on in the castle. Although there's one part of the game which a lot of people on the internet will hate, I know I did :'(
The visuals are very well made and really help to set the mood in to the game.

If you like point and clicks I see no reason on not getting this, well it is a bit short so do keep that in mind.
And if you are uncertain you can view my let's play of the game here if that helps you.
