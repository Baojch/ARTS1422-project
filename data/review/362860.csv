One thing to note about it is that the game is primarily puzzles. Little action that means hardly anything, but it's meaningful nonetheless. And with that, the first puzzle is kinda bad to lock the player to the rest of the game, just felt less clear than it should've been. 

Beyond that, I suggest you keep this game at max volume. Do not change it or adjust it, leave it how it is. Because there was a moment while in an ashy, red forest, I heard what sounded like distant growling in one direction through the recording mic. Thinking it was an easter egg, I followed it and followed it. It kept going on for what felt like 20 minutes until nothing. Not a sound. Pure silence.

But, if you can look beyond this, there's a decent and interesting atmospheric horror game behind it. Having just finished my play-through of this on Youtube, I've enclosed a link below for anyone who wants to see a sample of gameplay before deciding to buy.

I'll try to summarise the plot here without being too spoiler-y. Sylvio puts you in the shoes of Juliette Waters, a ghost recorder who one night enters the abandoned Saginaw Park and begins uncovering the grisly secrets buried there (both literally and figuratively) using her audio recording equipment. As the game unfolds, you learn of the disaster that struck the park in bygone years and the sinister things that happened to it afterward. The story is a little cryptic, told through snippets of information gleaned from listening to ghosts or from tape reels left in the environment - so the plot is, to an extent, left to the player to figure out. I thought it worked, personally - it's that old horror adage of giving your audience a few hints, then leaving other aspects to their imagination.

The graphics may be somewhat dated, but personally I felt that they still work well for the atmosphere that the game is seeking to create. And speaking of atmosphere, there's plenty of it - no cheap jump-scares or fast-paced monster chases (though there are definitely threats you need to watch out), just a dark and unsettling vibe as you traverse the foggy landscape and rusty, decaying landmarks of Saginaw Park.

Where this game excels is in its sound design - which is arguably the key ingredient, since Sylvio is all about using your audio equipment to detect, listen to and record ghosts. The audio game mechanics are what makes Sylvio stand out from other horror games. As you come across ghosts and hold occasional seances, your equipment will record what these ghosts say - but their voices are scrambled and distorted, and so it's up to you to un-scramble them using your equipment. Reverse the audio, speed it up, slow it down, or a combination of these, and you'll uncover what it is the spirits are trying to communicate. This does lead to some good, spine-tingling moments where you un-scramble what sounds like demonic gibberish only to discover that you're hearing a ghost dropping some macabre hints about how it died.

As mentioned above, whilst the game is mostly a slow-building form of horror spent exploring Saginaw Park's remains, there are threats you need to watch out for. Not all the ghosts are docile; some, which take the form of shapeless black clouds or gigantic humanoid forms, are dangerous if you get too close. Not that there's much of a penalty if they get you - fortunately, Sylvio autosaves everytime you do something of any significance (such as recording a ghost or finding a collectible), so you don't need to worry about losing huge amounts of progress if you get unlucky and a hostile ghost sneaks up on you.

Plus, you do have a means to defend yourself. Early in the game, Juliette finds an improvised gun that uses old pesticide spray cans as propellant and which can be used to fire a variety of projectile types found in the environment - baseballs, rusty nails, stones, potatoes and more. Some of these (such as the nails) can be used to drive back hostile ghosts. Others (such as potatoes or baseballs) don't do much damage to ghosts but can be used to trigger things in your environment - such as hitting certain switches or knocking items off ledges that are out of reach. The gun mechanic is interesting, though it is one of the elements of Sylvio that would have benefited from a bit more polish - I did find it a bit janky at times, though fortunately this jankiness wasn't unbearable.

So, in short, Sylvio is a bit rough around the edges but it is an interesting take on horror. Would definitely recommend giving it a try.

It’s a ghost hunting game where you travel around abandoned areas in the outskirts of some forsaken woods. You’re capturing the dead through audio -- at least what’s left of them and their stories. 

It’s actually a great way to tell a story a couple of words at a time, carefully letting you piece together a larger puzzle. It’s also where the game builds a lot of its atmosphere, constantly surrounding and overpowering you with noise, through a sound design that really jostles your attention and imagination

There’s this great bit where you get to analyze your sound library after a discovery. At first glance it’s just filled with static and babel. But by running it backwards, or in slow motion, you find hidden messages that reveal more pieces to the puzzle. 

It’s a super fun, detective-like part of Sylvio that is sadly overshadowed by what can only be described as [i]the rest of the game[/i]. It’s the less flattering part. The less fun one. The one where you travel around inexplicable, awkward terrain -- sometimes by car -- in order to reach points of interest. Interspersed with puzzle solving and combat where you shoot apparitions with a potato cannon. 

It’s a mess, to be honest. Which is a shame, seeing as the game is so close to being a horror game about something more substantial; a lot more specific and interesting. But instead of being a game about deduction and listening, it turns into a more abstract one where you’re once again just chasing down waypoints ad nauseum.

Love the theme, not so much the execution. Thumbs down for me.

Sound is a major part and analysing what you hear around you is introduced from the start, using your microphone to communicate with what might still be lingering, or gain access to hidden items. Using an old reel to reel player/recorder instead of a modern, digital variant, adds to the spooky vibe as the reels spin up and down.

There are no jump scares and the game is more creepy than scary. Communicating with the ghosts can be pretty intense, since you have to listen closely to what they say or else you might miss important clues, and sometimes disturbing or instilling a feeling of unease. The ghosts are more often suggested than shown, but there are times when you have to fight some of them—using one of the best (and possibly also the quirkiest) weapons I’ve seen so far in a game.

The story has to be pieced together as you delve deeper, and was pretty interesting with a few twists, albeit a bit “all over the place”. I thought everything connected without any obvious plot-holes, although I haven’t fully pieced everything together yet. Don’t play the game for the story alone, but for everything combined: the developer has squeezed in a lot of great stuff to enjoy and explore.

I quite liked how the main protagonist was delivering her lines and thought it made a lot of sense for her not to be loud or pushy. For the other voice actors, I could hear a bit of an accent, which might be immersion breaking if one is extra sensitive to that sort of thing.

Sound is mainly provided by the environment, but the game also has a great soundtrack mostly heard when you’re driving between levels, so if you want to take a break and just relax for a while, without leaving the game, you can drive around while listening to the music and, like I did, crashing into trees a lot.

Can I recommend Sylvio 1? Yes, definitely, I loved every second of it and I think you would too if you’re into puzzle solving, first person exploration, or sound analysis. On the other hand, if you are obsessed with superrealistic graphics, then you might want to play something else: the game has its own unique style, which I appreciated, but others might not. The crudeness in style is, in my opinion, well compensated by gameplay, atmosphere, soundtrack etc...

[b][u]Визуал крайне небогат[/u][/b], хоть и немного приятен, однако не отпугивает от слова «совсем». Мне вообще было всё равно, насколько порой несуразно всё выглядит и местами пустынно.
[b][u]Проблема неосновных локаций[/u][/b]. Если на машине по большой центральной локации дают покататься, то многие неосновные локации, имея слишком широкий излишний масштаб, не имеют возможности вместить 4-х колсёного друга.
[b][u]Невозможность бега[/u][/b]. Да, по сути бегать то не от кого, но поймите правильно, неосновные локации, отмеченные выше, местами могут утомить, особенно если вы любитель полазить, где не просят.
[b][u]Отсутствие озвучки, отсутствие субтитров на аудиозаписях, в интро[/u][/b]. Опять же, может стать проблемой для многих людей. Английского много (не как в условном [b]Neverwinter Nights[/b], если играть на английском), слушать много. Благо ещё, когда работаешь с пойманными голосами, слова выписываются в блокнот, а во время путешествия, пока главная героиня озвучивает свои мысли, это выводится на экран. Но тем не менее, проект средней сложности в плане усвоения материала.

Sylvio is a Puzzle Exploration Shooter game, with a creepy atmosphere which takes place over large maps. The player is exploring the remnants of an old theme park, and what brought the place to ruin. With the use of Audio Recording Equipment, listen to the ghosts and discover what actually happened.

On each map the player explores, they will be looking for ghostly apparitions which can either take the form of a general location, white orbs or black clouds. Locations are simply points the player will be guided towards to record a ghostly apparition. The white orbs are passive and the player will simply need to find the correct spot around them in order to record the ghost. While the black clouds can injure the player should they get close. In order to get rid of the black clouds the player needs to use the potato gun with a sharp object to injure them, the amount of shots needed to kill a black cloud increases through the game. Once the player destroys the cloud they are able to then record the ghost.

If the player destroys all of the black clouds in an area then a giant ghost will spawn, like with the black clouds the player will need to load their potato gun with sharp objects and shoot each enough times to deal with them, the amount of shots escalates per level the player is on. Should you get too close to the giant ghost the player will be injured and collapse, the ghosts will attack the player with a black fog from a distance which will also cause damage. The black cloud can be hard to see, and may kill the player before they realise what is happening. Once the giant ghost is dealt with the player will once more be able to record audio.

Once the player has recorded a ghost they will need to listen to what the ghost says by rewinding and listening to the tape. The player may need to go back and forwards through each recording at different speeds before they can find the ghost's message. I found the puzzles of working out what the ghost was saying to be one of the more enjoyable parts of the game, as each time you listened to the ghost stories you found out more of what actually happened in the park.

It is not easy to find the ghost apparitions, the player will need to explore old structures and attractions. In order to get through them the player will need to complete puzzles to open up the maps. This will be done with the use of the Potato gun and hard objects which can be used to knock over objects. The puzzles are not difficult, but can be hard to find some of the locations with there only being one approach.

The player will be traversing large maps in the game in order to find the ghosts' apparitions, the player will need to drive to get from point to point as locations can be minutes away from each other. Driving in Sylvio is very basic, though does suffer with some ragdoll moments which can send the car spinning should the player crash. 

Sylvio’s story is interesting with lots of events leading up to the collapse of the park, and multiple stories coalescing from different perspectives. The story is told in such a disjointed way that it makes it really intriguing trying to learn more of what happened. Now saying that, by the time I was near the end of the game, I did get confused on what was happening anymore, to the point I would need to go through the game again to work out what goes on at the end.

Sylvio is not difficult, the problem comes that it is really easy to get confused on puzzles, parts can easily be missed, while others parts you may not realise you can interact with. This seems to be at worst in the Carnival, in which multiple attractions need to be interacted with in different ways to progress the game. At the same time puzzles that involve dropping platforms can be invisible in the red fog unless you are at the correct angle. It can come to such a problem that if you just do not notice a bullseye you can be wandering in circles for ages trying to find a way in.

When it comes to visuals, Sylvio is not a nice game to look at, maps can be bare, or so coated in mist that most locations are hard to make out. The theme park visuals of the early game are quickly lost to bare maps, in which the player will spend a lot of the game just driving from place to place. Buildings feel compact and tight, and having to explore them is both annoying and compact.

Do not come into Sylvio expecting a horror game, at times it can be creepy with the story behind the events and seeking ghosts. There are no scares, or real threats apart from dealing with the giant ghostly forms, shooting dark clouds at the player. 

Still I really enjoyed Sylvio, and I am not really sure why. The puzzles were fun, and offered a fair challenge to work out where to go, some of the more enjoyable ones were tactically shooting potatoes to open doors. The story was interesting, though I did get a bit confused the further I went in. I guess I truly enjoyed the game because it is such a unique experience that I find it hard to compare it to other games.

You hunt ghosts, listen to spirits, decode hidden messages and resolve mini puzzles to go to the next stage.
Sylvio is just really badly designed and boring, I can't recommend it.

First, you can't run, in a world that big it's a massive mistake.
You are just wasting my time by making me walk that much and it's incredibly tedious.

Second, the gun is tr*sh.
You have 2 bullets, one to knock objects over and another that kill spirits.
Your gun is powered by gas cans.
You don't have magazines on that gun so the last bullet you put in the gun is the one you will shoot first.
Do I have to explain what's the problem ? 
I can't just have 1 magazine for each kinds of ammo, no, I have to shoot the useless bullets and waste gas if the next bullet I shoot is the wrong one.
There is bullets and gas cans in the environment but in a game where you can't run it's really lame to go back non stop for resources.

Thirdly, it's repetitive, it never try to surprise or diversify the experience to the point I wasn't even feeling like I was playing a horror game.
The creep factor isn't there, I just felt like I was listening to records and not interacting directly with spirits, in my opinion this game is a big missed oppurtinity.
Stage after stage you are alway doing the same sh*t non stop, it's just the puzzles that change a little bit but that's it.
The spirits you are destroying are just clouds and there never is more than 1 coming to attack you, that's laughable.

At last the story is fragmented so much I didn't understand anything, at the end I was just like ''Ok, that's it ?''.
I understood what everyone said very well but I really didn't get the full picture at all honestly, maybe it was just because I was bored to death or I'm stupid, I don't know.

In short, the execution ruin the game completely and the horror in that game just isn't there so it's just really boring and tedious.",1640951049,1640951115,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Among the static, a broken women’s voice can be heard. She speaks in slow and melancholic tone “I didn’t want to… Daddy… They put me to sleep… I’m not alo…” Her voice turns to short scream. I’ve stopped the recording and played it backwards, at half the playback speed. At first there was nothing except distortion but a faint sound can be heard. It’s a horrid imitation of human speech, with no discernable accent or phonetic pattern. Its words now etched into my mind: SHE IS HERE WITH ME.” [/i]

In the late seventies, something terrible has happened in the Saginaw Park. Since then, no living creature, except for the crows, can live there. You play as Juliette Waters, a professional Ghost Whisperer, as she travels into the park to put her skills to the ultimate test.

Sylvio is a first-person survival horror game inspired by Silent Hill games and Twin Peaks in the best possible way. Its unique story premise, creepy atmosphere, and bone-chilling ghost recording gameplay left me in awe and hooked till the end. Considering it’s made by one person, this amazing horror indie game is very rough in its execution.

You‘ll spend 70% of the time investigating and solving puzzles, and 30% shooting and defending yourself. There are 13 chapters/levels in the game and you’ll need between 8-12 hours to complete the game. You start each level by using the Electronic Voice Phenomenon recorder to capture the messages from ghost residues or trapped apparitions.  Since ghosts exist in a realm where time flows differently, you’ll manipulate the playback speed and direction to uncover what they have to say.

Some of these ghosts will part with their secrets peacefully, while you’ll have to “reason” with others before communicating by using your compressor shotgun. As much as the investigation and sound manipulation segment of the game excels, the combat is quite floaty and imprecise, barely getting a passing grade.

The biggest problem with this game is sheer obscurity on what to do next. Puzzles in the first few levels are straightforward and logical. As I reached the second part of the game, I was often stumped on how to proceed, as puzzles can reach the infamous “moon logic” levels of difficulty. When you uncover how to proceed, you’ll scratch your head thinking how that puzzle made any sense.

Controls are also obscure, with too many keyboard input requirements for something simple. There is a guide in the main menu that I recommend you to read first. Even after this, I didn’t realize how to change and use objects in my inventory until near the end of the game. Your gun, for example, uses two types of ammo: solid, blunt objects to solve puzzles, and sharp and deadly ones to fight the ghosts. 

On top of this, you’ll notice a small compressor meter on the gun that loses its power every time you shoot. You’ll have to pick up compressed pesticide canisters to refill your weapon’s range and power. And all of this could’ve been simplified or better explained in the game, but it’s not.

Regardless, the outstanding sound and music immersed me completely and sealed the deal for me. Talking to ghosts got me unnerved every time. Juliette sounds like a curious and fearless kid, and yet very fragile and afraid adult at the same time. The voice cast in general is superb. 

The graphics are okay, but the art direction is amazing. Decrepit and mist-filled park locations felt eerie, packed with tension, unwelcoming and alien. Lastly, the unfolding story never disrespected my intelligence and chewed plot points for me. You’ll uncover some answers, but you’ll have to use your brain to get the full picture.

Among throngs of cheap jumpscare games out there, Sylvio has masterfully done the rising dread and uncertainty. If you can go past through rough design and no hand holding, this game will leave a lasting mark, just like a well told short horror story does.

[b]ANÁLISE[/b]

Enquanto jogava Sylvio e progredia na história comecei a pensar na análise no Steam, afinal já tem tempo que esse burro velho não escreve nada por essas bandas e meus fiéis 38 seguidores já devem se perguntar onde diabos estão aquelas análises que ninguém se importa, inclusive eles. Pois bem, quanto mais eu me aproximava do final, mais o dilema de Commodus me assolava: polegar para o alto ou polegar para baixo?

Polegar para baixo. Sylvio é um jogo fraco e isso precisa ser dito.

Videogames ainda são feitos para serem jogados (sei lá, vai que alguém resolve inventar jogos para comer ou cheirar) e o “jogar” de Sylvio não foi uma experiência agradável, que pode ser resumido em dois adjetivos: feio e chato.

Sim, Sylvio é um jogo muito feio. É um jogo de baixo orçamento e de 6 anos atrás? Sim e sim, mas graficamente falando ele está no mínimo uns 10 anos atrasado. A sensação é de jogar algo de PS2/Xbox. 

E quando digo jogar algo antigo não me refiro só a parte gráfica, a jogabilidade e as mecânicas implementadas em Sylvio são de 15 anos atrás. Controles duros, movimentação arrastada, física em slow motion e nas fases em que guiamos um “belíssimo” Lada Laika 69 chega a dar pena de tão ruim que é controlar aquela lada velha. Pelo menos o dev criou uma mecânica de spawn do carro pressionando Q. Vou te contar, o que aquele carro trava no cenário é uma piada, mesmo assim o fato de precisar desse spawn constante é tenebroso.

Sylvio é chato em muitas partes. Em especial na área aberta do parque, uma área bem grande onde precisamos usar o Lada velha para ir de um lado para o outro e que basicamente serve de hub para as demais fases. No zoológico também rola um vai-e-vem que eu vou te contar, por sorte já estamos perto do final.

Outra coisa que não entendi em Sylvio foi a lanterna. Ok, a lanterna é para iluminar, mas porque existe a opção de ligá-la e desligá-la? Não muda em absolutamente nada os confrontos com os poltegeists (eles te acham de qualquer jeito) e quando a desligamos perdemos visão do ambiente, já que grande parte de Sylvio é com baixa iluminação.

Por falar em poltergeists, o combate no jogo é bem bobo. Nem precisamos perder tempo comentando.

Mesmo com esse lamaçal de desgraça dá para tiramos alguns pontos positivos.

As dublagens são boas. A protagonista é tímida em suas falas, embora competente, já os áudios que coletamos de uma tal de Bobby que trabalhou no parque são bem interessantes.

A trilha sonora nos poucos momentos que se mostra presente, também me agradou. Curioso que ela ocorre na área aberta do parque. É uma trilha synthwave anos 80 e que contrasta demais com o clima do jogo em si. Sei lá, talvez seja isso que me chamou mais atenção, justamente por quebrar a monotonia que é percorrer o parque de um ponto a outro só para desbloquear o acesso para a próxima fase.

E por fim, o chamariz principal de Sylvio, [i]electronic voice phenomena[/i] (EVP), ou em bom português, fenômenos de voz eletrônica (FVE). Todo o jogo gira ao redor de tentarmos capturar mensagens ocultas em estáticas com um poderoso gravador de última geração. Sempre que matar um poltergeist você vai gravar uma mensagem dele, que vai te indicar a localização de objetos/ações para prosseguir na fase. Além do já decifrado é possível usar recursos AVANÇADÍSSIMOS do gravador para procurar mais mensagens ocultar em velocidade rápida, lenta ou para trás (não é para descobrir palavras satânicas igual se fazia com os discos da Xuxa, ok?). E é isso. Essa é a parte boa do jogo. Mentira, a história também é minimamente, interessante.

Sylvio é um jogo com uma premissa interessante e que tenta usar algo ainda pouco explorado nos games, mas sua parte técnica e jogabilidade são tão fracas que ele não vai entrar no nosso top de todos os tempos da última semana.

That said, the level design is atrocious. While each area fills you with unease, they're too sprawling and lacking in guidance to successfully navigate given the lack of a map or even a compass; expect to look up a guide if you want to actually find all the hidden messages, as well as plenty of failed experimentation over actual progress given the poor tutorial/mechanical explanation and physics-related bugs.

Ammunition is another recurring problem. There's different types of ammo for the potato gun; some are for solving puzzles, while others are used to combat aggressive spirits. Unfortunately, you can only queue up ammo as the barrel empties, not swap sets entirely. This inevitably results in wasted pesticide—your source of air pressure—spent on emptying the cannon just to swap in a metal ball to knock open a door, in turn leaving you vulnerable to spirits if you didn't a. pick up some ammo boxes along the way (which don't carry over to the next level) or b. ran back to the car to reload.

Surprisingly, the voice acting and original score are exceptionally well done, particularly for an independently developed game. Juliette—the protagonist—sounds like a moody, exhausted Björk, something that puts me at ease despite fumbling through red-misted woodlands.

More crucial, however, is that despite being kind of broken and janky and not very well thought out as a game, I still felt compelled to see [i]Sylvio[/i] through to the end, driven off of atmosphere and narrative intrigue alone, something that's a bit of a lost art in the survival horror niche today.

Unfortunately they're wrapped in a seriously buggy product. The atmosphere and setting are intriguing, and the ghost recording elements are fascinating and really draw you into the plot. The downside is that the puzzles swing wildly between easy and extremely obtuse. Which elements of the game are interactive, and the general physics, are not particularly well explained and can lead to some frustrating moments where a puzzle solution seems slightly out of your reach for an unclear reason. This reaches its apex in the final level, which happens to be the most bland of all the levels graphically and design-wise while also managing to place items you need in positions that make little sense other than to extend your time walking around this extremely dull area.

The combat is also extremely basic, and it is never really clear what exactly will 'kill' you. Some enemies seem to damage you simply by being nearby, and as they can float through walls you will regularly find yourself dying by an enemy that you have never even seen. There is also no way to change ammunition, so if you find yourself with the wrong ammo for a situation you are forced to waste whatever you have loaded into the gun before you can put the correct one in.

The driving sections of the game are extremely basic. It is simply: A) Drive in this direction, don't hit any trees. B) Record some sounds. C) Repeat. You will regularly find yourself at the whims of the game's very basic physics, and it is a blessing that the game includes a button to right your car. Unfortunately you have to do four almost identical driving levels through the course of the game and it never gets any more interesting.

I'm surprised by the number of positive reviews for this game, which suggests that horror game fans are so starved of content that they will lap up anything without being critical of its shortcomings.

Just wanted to give you an answer to the things you find unclear. 

The countdown on the mic shows your distance in metres from the thing the mic is currently picking up. It can be used to find spots of interest, or orbs to shoot.

After shooting an orb, it disappears and you will record audio. The audio can then be analyzed with your recorder.

You will see what kinds of ammo you have in your pipeline. When loading it's filled from left to right, hence the next ammo going out is on the far right on the UI.

Hidden messages are found when you adjust the playback in different speeds.

You exit the recorder by pressing Q, or use 4 to toggle.

It goes to the other end of the spectrum from the standard unity horror jump-scare-a-thon.  Instead it succeeds in crafting a masterful atmosphere that is an absolute joy to revel in.  It's a real slow burn, with a grimey, retro feel, right down to the minimalist synth soundtrack, which is very pleasing.
You play as an EVP-aficionado, or electronic voice phenomena junkie, who decides that the best thing to do to try out her new death-walkie-talkie is to to set off into an abandoned themepark in the middle of the night and chase up some spooks.
The game's mechanic essentially boil down to 4 things:
*Use your mic to find sources of EVP and record the audio
*Scour back and forth, forwards and reverse, at high and low speed, through this audio to eek out the snippets of dialogue imparted by the lingering dead - this definitely raises the hair on more than one occasion!
*Blast evil spirits with your nail/potato gun
*Get guided to items by the spirits and use them to progress through the, occasionally convoluted, puzzles.
And this core loop continues through a solid 7-8 hour journey.  The overall story of a huge tragedy befalling a group of people unfolds over the course of this journey.  And while some of the overall story beats are completely obtuse (and that ending, absolutely bonkers), but what is thoroughly enjoyable is the occasional engagements you have with specific named ghosts via a candlelit seance, where you find out how they died, and why they linger on.
In terms of polish this game is definitely on the rougher side, and it doesn't do a great job of explaining things to you.  I was 2/3 of the way through the game before I realised you could drive around in your car in the level, and not just use it as the 'load-next' button at the end of completing a level.
But persevere through some of that jank and you'll find an absolutely unique gem that will swallow up a couple of evenings.",1586214020,1586214020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]Julliette here knows precisely what she's doing,[/b] where she's going and what the consequences can be.

2.Conventional horrors hate outdoors. [b]The better part of [i]Sylvio[/i] is set outdoors.[/b] And what an outdoors it is! Surreal, red mist, half-buried shacks, rusting metal all over the place. The world of [i]Sylvio[/i] is akin to [i]Stalker[/i] in a lot of ways.

3.Conventional horrors make the protagonist passive. Here [b]you're always on the active side[/b] - looking for ghosts with your mic, making your way towards them, not away from them.

4.Conventional horrors do screamers and try to play on your reflexes. Or if not - then create the sense of panic or dread, like in [i]Alien:Isolation[/i] or evoke the feeling of being lost and confused like in projects by [i]Bloober Team[/i]. Sylvio does noting of that. The feeling you get from playing it is not fear or dread so much as [b]a delicate mixture of apprehension, curiosity, gloom and awe[/b].

5.[b]Conventional horrors never get this scary.[/b] No conventional horror has this feeling when you start catching something on your mic out there. And then you suddenly see that while you are standing still, the number on your distance meter is changing. And it's slowly getting lower.

No conventional horror will just let you come out of the barn and behold a three-story-high black human figure against a red sky. No intense music, no screamer, just the raging static in your mic. The figure isn't aggressive, it's just standing there, do what you want about it. It's bewildering.

For nearly every negative aspect the game unfortunately sports, a feeble, and occasionally justifiable, positive one can be provided in return; Sylvio gets all-so-close to giving as much as it takes. And had I been somewhat more charitable I would have tipped the other way, but in review of all I just played I can't rightly recommend what is in effect more a chore than a pleasance. 

Sylvio boasts the unique gameplay mechanic of audio-record investigation, as you'll be collecting scraps of audio to review and investigate, only to eventually further parse and evaluate. Doing this is essential to forwarding the game as it's the sole means of progression; the audio investigation is the fulcrum by which the game depends. In addition there is a paltry smattering of puzzle-solving, some flimsy and awkward gunplay, and a whole lot of nauseous exploration. It needn't be said that considering the nature of the game, graphical shortcomings can be forgiven, but the length of Sylvio (a game which boasts 10-odd hours) and its murky, crimson-fogged environments make for quite the ugly picture. Add to this a lack of diversity for just about everything (environment, enemies, items, collectibles, objectives, etc.) and you get a game that has exhausted all its positive, and in one case unique, attributes within the first few levels--and by the later levels completely ruined by its merciless repetitiveness and tediousness. 

The audio investigation, and associated creepy, ghostly voices and nocturnal seances, is an element of the game that is truly off-putting the first times it's executed. And in the game's defence I cannot think of another game that manipulates audio with this much efficaciousness: it's the core mechanic driving the game, and it functionally and emotionally works. But then you do it again. And again. And again. This action you do ad nauseam. By the third or so level the game has completely revealed what it is; the game quickly reveals just how bereft it is. By attempting to develop a long game, with an unnecessarily large environment, too much time was spent on blandly lengthening the already parchment-thin novelty present, where instead a shorter and sharper experience would have been endlessly preferable. It's understandable that featuring a longer play-time makes for an appealing Store Page bullet point, and undoubtedly appeals to many gamers, but the length of a game should always be in balance with the resources available. A confusing story and unengaging audio clips do not adequately recompense a mechanically poor game with a whopping two enemy types and a whole lot of frustrating, insipid levels.

If it seems that the previous two paragraphs aren't commensurate with the ambivalent preface, it's because I am actually disappointed that a game that so perfectly nails the horror movie creepiness of distorted audio and its manipulation, also happens to be a game that is whelmingly tedious. It's clear that developers cared about their product: evinced by the dedication to its core idea; the plethora of secrets and collectibles; and a dedication to their story (whether it's confusing and poorly communicated or not). But sometimes that's not enough. For me it wasn't. It may be for you. Make your own choice and don't feel poorly about it either way.",1519477408,1519723586,False,10,3,0.586176216602325439,0,True,False,False,False,,1657122747.0,"I realize it's been four years, so apologies for getting back to you so late.

This game certainly belongs in that group.

The core mechanic of this game is a sound recorder that picks up on voices from the other side. When you talk to these voices the recordings need to be analyzed and played forwards and backwards at different speeds. Only that way can you understand what a spirit is trying to tell you. This way you will also piece together the mystery of the pace you are exploring. It's a very unique gameplay mechanic and lends itself to a lot of interesting plot development.

It is created by basically one person alone so please keep that in mind and maaaaybe try the demo first?
Because of this a few things might throw you off. First and foremost - the graphics. This game looks like a PS2 game. And not a good one at that. Keeping in mind, though, how much content there is in the final product that is still impressive. The controls are very basic as well. The game basically uses Unity's standard FPS controller in the first iteration - which means no headbobbing, running or ducking. Or in other words: controls are not bad but feel a little like wolfenstein. From 1992. Sounds can sometimes also be a little repetetive. But look beyond that and you get a psychological horror experience that is eerie, chilling and creates atmosphere without ever falling back into cheap scares.

The best I can compare it to is finding and reading an independent comic by a local artist. Someone who self-publishes only a very small amount of his comics  and sells most of it on conventions, local comicbook stores or his own website. That small thing that would not be picked up by a large publisher which still ends up the thing that you read and fall in love with for all the right reasons despite not being printed in fukll color or on glossy paper.

Sylvio is a game that tries to cover a lot of bases. However this does lead to a game that comes with some issues as a result of this. So It has point and click, fps, open world exploration and jumping puzzles. And of course the EVP mechanic in which you use a tape recorder to decode messages from the dead. The game also deos not do much in the way of hand holding either. 

However it is fair to say that other than the EVP mechanic, the other elements are somewhat rough around the egdes. And there is also some bugs and glitches thrown in as well. For example the shooting mechanic is over complicated with two tyoes of ammo, but no way to switch directly between them, as well as the pressure in your gun effecting its range and accuracy. Add to that even when you get a clear hit on your target, the game may not register the hit. 

Jumping can be floaty and impresice, and sometimes you can jump into areas that will freeze your character in place forcing you to restart. 

On the plus side, the game is a decent length, the EVP mechanic interesting and the voice acting and audio in general is good. So all in all this is really a diamond in the rough.

You walk an abandoned family park and record ghost voices, then analyse these recordings in search for any clues. You do it by playing the recording slower, faster, backwards etc. It's an interesting and unique mechanics - and certainly a very strong point of this game. The recordings might seem random and chaotic at first, but fortunately you can return to your notes later (no need to listen to them all again - good!) and a bigger, unnerving picture starts to emerge.

Sylvio is also a very crude game in places: it has some collision problems, very uneven visuals (ranging from average to very bad). To make things worse, it employs a ""videogame-logic"" to many puzzles, forces you to go through a few abysmal jumping-and-walking-on-ledges puzzles. 
Be prepared to persevere through these, but don't be turned off! The good things about Sylvio certainly outweigh the bad. 
The game is strangely quiet - starting from the protagonist's voice. And by ""quiet"" I don't mean that there's no sound! The sound part is actually great and builds most of Sylvio's atmosphere. When nobody screams, even a small whisper can make you shiver.

If you like horror games, this one's very unique and strange. I want more games that are so courageous!

Sylvio es un juego de terror y exploración basado en el sonido. A pesar de tener unos gráficos muy normalitos la calidad y detalles de audio junto con una gran banda sonora sintetizada hace que la experiencia sea muy inmersiva.

La historia trata sobre Juliette Waters, una ""sensitiva"" capaz de escuchar por medio de un equipo de audio especializado los espíritus de las personas que no han podido descansar en paz (Inquietante, verdad, Iker?). La acción transcurre en un parque de atracciones abandonado, bastante grande la verdad, que se puede explorar a pie o en coche, con multitud de secretos y audios extra por descubrir. Tiene una atmosfera enrarecida, donde todo es bosque, sonidos de ambiente y niebla de color rojo sangre que hace que pienses que estas en un sueño constante. Los puzles son sencillitos pero están bien pensados.

A pesar de ciertos bugs molestos que no llegan a romper el juego pero sí que te pueden hacer perder el tiempo, Sylvio es una gran experiencia con un buen precio, con muchísimo trabajo detrás por parte de su desarrollador proporcionando un ""agradable"" resultado. Es muy necesario, aunque no obligatorio, tener un buen equipo de sonido (amplificado es la leche) para poder disfrutarlo al máximo. Sylvio no es un juego de sustos tipo screamers, es pura atmosfera único en su estilo.

Este Otoño verá la luz su segunda parte, donde este Developer tiene un comprador fijo.

[h1] [b]###Full Review###[/b] [/h1]

[h1] [b]Overview[/b] [/h1]

Sylvio is a 1st person horror adevnture game. You are Juliette Waters, exploring a dilapidated family theme park, armed with a microphone and a blunderbuss that can shoot anything you pick off the ground. You can explore the large levels, picking up audio samples with your microphone and decoding them to reveal clues. This is an interesting game progression mechanic that works very well. The levels are large and open ended, and you're sometimes able to drive your car around.

[h1][b] Components[/b] [/h1]

[b]Visuals[/b] - This is an indie horror game made in Unity, so that may put some people off. Unfortunately the visuals won't do it much justice; the graphics look dated by almost a decade. On the contrary, the game manages to pull off an atmospheric and creepy aesthetic which is enough to immerse you. And since the game is so dark and sombre, the lack of graphical detail isn't a big issue. The lighting with the torch is decent, but just don't expect any dynamic shadows.

[b]Audio[/b] - The voice actor for the protagonist is a bit of a mixed bag. While the voice acting quality is alright, it definitely lacks emotion and enthusiasm. One time in the game you suddenly fall through a hole in the ground, which is quite frightful. In response, the protagonst humorously proclaims ""I'm not getting back out that way,"" in a quiet whisper. Every line the protagonist speaks is quiet and sometimes difficult to hear, so thank goodness for subtitles. The music is definitely a positive aspect, and it's got a sort of 80's horror vibe going for it, with nice electric synth sounds. 

[b]Gameplay[/b] - This game is certainly very interesting. Each enemy you 'kill' actually helps you progess in the game. Sylvio's staple mecahnic is recording and deciphering audio using the EVP recording equipment. EVP stands for electronic voice phenomena, which are voices of spirits recorded electronically (and there's even [url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voice_phenomenon]study on it in real life.[/url] Using the micropone, you can pick up bits of audio after killing the creatures, or just around the place randomly. You can then playback the audio using the EVP to reveal a message, but you will also be able to find hidden messages by playing the audio in reverse and/or at different speeds. After successfully revealing the hidden messages, certain items or locations of interest will be highlighted. This is a really interesting mechanic for a horror game and it works quite well. 

For those of you looking for a scary horror game, you may be dissapointed to hear that this game is not very scary, barely at all. The game fits better into the 'adventure' genre, as you will be exploring locations, picking up items and using them to progress. Instead of relying on cheap horror tactics, this game's eeriness and intriguing story is what will be haunting you.

[b]Story[/b] - the story is slow and unravels as you play, and you can find audio tapes that also reveal some lore. The game's story might be slow, but it definitely does not fall into cliché horror tropes. Progressing the story involves holding seances to acquire information, and the EVP equipment can also be used to reveal extra hidden messages.

[b]Functionality[/b] - The game runs on the Unity engine, which I have had quite a negative experience with. However, this game is indeed very well optimised and I didn't experience any stuttering or framerate drops.

[b]UX[/b] - Sylvio makes some unusual control binding decisions, but it's easy to adapt to and the game is fairly simple overall. Using the EVP equipment is as easy as pressing the arrow keys. However, there is an odd lack of mouse support for the menus, and the in-game help guide is quite awkward to navigate. 

[h1][b]Valuation[/b][/h1]

[b]Longevity/replayability[/b] - The game isn't really long, and can be completed in under 10 hours. But you'll probably be wanting to come back for more and finding all the secrets and recording every voice, as it's a worthwhile and fun experience.

[b]Modablity[/b] - None

[b]Support[/b] - The game has received quite a bit of updates, and has even been remastered during it's time on Steam. However, the developer hasn't responded in the forums in over a year.

[b]Is it worth the money?[/b] I would say that if you get this discounted for under $10, then it's a very worthwhile experience for any fans of adventure or horror.

[h1][b] Positive Attributes [/b] [/h1]
[list]
[*] Very interesting and innovative gameplay mechanic
[*] Large open levels; hidden secrets to find
[*] The music is quite good
[*] Very well optimized
[/list]
[h1][b] Negative Attributes [/b] [/h1]
[list]
[*] Graphics are subpar
[*] Voice acting is generally OK but definitely not Sylvio's strong point
[*] The UX isn't very user friendly or convenient
[/list]

[h1] [b]Conclusion[/b] [/h1]

Sylvio is a very unique horror game and I'd definitely recommend it if your even the slightest fan of horror or mystery. It's likely unlike anything you'd ever played before.
I give this game a 7/10 - an innovative indie horror game with lack of polish

I won't tell about the story (apart of chasing ghosts), but this is a great way of telling the story. Many games are about doing stuff, because that itself is fun/great/what ever, but playing this game itself is not much (yet still very eerie and scary), but the story you unfold during the game is what this is all about. The story would not have been great in a book, but this way of unrevelling is great.

Get all the reels in the game, and listen to them after the game (in order), and everything makes completly sense... in a scary way.

Creepy and atmospheric, Sylvio provides a unique form of game play- the ability to record and subsequently analyze EVPs, or electronic voice phenomena. Although that would be something I'd be too frightened to do in real life, doing so in the game is a chilling yet thrilling experience. 

The puzzles in this game are nothing to scoff at either; some are particularly easy, while others appear easy yet provide a challenge, a need to think outside the box and adjust your expectations. 

Having a gun for fighting the shadowy blobs and figures (and solving those tricky puzzles) provides just enough action to keep your heart racing and balance out the quiet item hunt and freaky voices begging for your attention.

Speaking of, the sound design is eerie- even though I know it's only a game, all designed and recorded by other people, a shiver still traces my spine at the sound of garbled voices coming from seemingly thin air.

There seems to be no end to the secrets as well- I find myself revisiting previous areas to seek out all the voices in the static and discover the secret codes and items.

I will admit, that while the game doesn't seem terribly spooky at times while you're wandering around, turning around to suddenly find that a hostile black mist is phasing through the wall in your direction can be absolutely heart attack-inducing. I actually screamed in my husband's ear once when it happened xD.
The recordings of the ghosts are fairly unsettling, as well, especially if you're easily creeped out by the uncanny valley-esque weirdness of warped voices telling you about how they died.

On y incarne Juliette Waters, une jeune femme qui va chercher à communiquer avec les fantômes dans un ancien parc d'attractions. Celui-ci est abandonné suite à un glissement de terrain. Elle va donc s'aventurer seule à pied ou en voiture dans un environnement hostile dans lequel elle va chercher à enregistrer la voix des morts et à l'interpréter grâce à son système d'enregistrement analogue. Emmbarquez dans une aventure originale et comme vous n'en avez encore jamais vécu!

Sylvio n'est pas un jeu dans lequel on risque de sursauter ou de se faire massacrer par des esprits vengeurs et autres fantomes démoniaques. On va découvrir une histoire macabre de famille en parcourant le parc et ses différentes attractions et autres endroits emblématiques. Il va falloir découvrir les tenants et aboutissants de ce parc un peu à l'aveugle. Le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que le jeu n'est pas très explicite sur ses mécaniques et sur le cheminement logique de ses énigmes. En effet, le gameplay se divise en plusieurs parties entrecoupées de trajets jusqu'à la prochaine zone à explorer. On commence par chercher des indices et autres objets permettant d'avancer. Ensuite, il va falloir aller à la chasse aux fantomes grâce à un fusil artisanal. Une fois vaincu, on aura la possibilité de communiquer avec lui et ensuite d'analyser l'enregistrement à plusieurs vitesses.


Who you gonna call?

Ces manipulations sont un passage obligé afin d'avancer dans la résolution des énigmes. Une fois que l'on a extrait toutes les informations de l'enregistrement, on peut passer au suivant. Au passage, on utilise un micro afin d'enregistrer la voix des morts, il ne s'agira pas seulement d'enregistrer la seule voix du fantôme lors de ses apparitions mais aussi un peu partout dans les niveaux ce qui impliquera pas mal d'exploration dans les niveaux et de chasse aux achievements. On pourra également faire la chasse à des partitions de musique et autres enregistrements reliés à des corbeaux afin de découvrir une histoire parallèle. La progression est linéaire dans l'histoire du jeu mais elle ne l'est pas forcément au sein des niveaux, le jeu nous affichera des indices mais on ne pourra pas forcément les utiliser tant que l'on aura pas trouvé ce qu'il faut faire avant. C'est d'ailleurs un des rares problèmes du jeu, il est parfois assez confus et on peut passer une heure à chercher ce que l'on peut faire avec les objets que l'on vient de trouver, les combinaisons ne sont pas forcément logiques et il faudra s'armer de patience pour comprendre la logique derrière certaines énigmes.

Au niveau technique, le jeu est assez moyen avec une utilisation assez modérée du moteur Unity même dans la version remasterisée du jeu qui est sortie cette année et sur laquelle je base mon test. Les graphismes sont plats et les textures vont du moche au passable. La musique est plutôt bonne mais elle est très discrète et n'intervient quasiment que lors des phases en voiture. La maniabilité est correcte que ce soit avec la manette ou avec le combo clavier-souris. On peut sauter, utiliser des objets sur des éléments du décor ou activer des mécanismes. Les phases de combat sont assez particulière avec une gestion du bon type de munition à utiliser et de la pression du pistolet. Certaines interactions avec le décor sont logique tandis que d'autres sont plus nébuleuses voir chanceuses.


Not Alone in the Dark.

Sylvio n'est pas un jeu de combat ni même un jeu qui cherche les scarejumps. On évite également le côté Slender grâce au système de combat contre les esprits des fantômes mais aussi contre leur représentation physique sous la forme d'un géant faisant office de boss de niveau. On passe plus de temps à tenter de capter les voix des esprits et à analyser ce qui leur est arrivé. Il n'y a rien de perturbant au niveau visuel, pas de cadavres, pas de poupées qui font peur, pas d'animatroniques, rien de tout ceci. Sylvio est une expérience à part, pour peu que l'on occulte un tant soit peu les gros défauts du jeu, on passe 10-12 heures de véritable bonheur vidéoludique. Découvrir les secrets que renferme le jeu devient vite un plaisir plutôt qu'une corvée. Découvrir ce qui est arrivé à tout ce petit monde et refaire plusieurs fois le jeu pour y dénicher des enregistrements cachés devient presque une obsession.


Ne vous attendez pas à un jeu AAA ou à un jeu qui vous tient la main, on est loin de tout ca. Il m'est souvent arrivé de passer 30-40 minutes à chercher partout dans un niveau sans comprendre ou trouver de suite logique à mes actions précédentes. La réalisation est sommaire, on est obligé de passer son clavier en anglais pour pouvoir contrôler son personnage au clavier et il arrive souvent que l'on se retrouve bloqué dans le décor ou à court de munitions pour déclencher une ouverture de porte par exemple. Le jeu permet de sauvegarder à chaque action principale mais on recommancera toujours près de sa voiture. Les indices secondaires prrésentés par des distances et des ??? ne sont pas toujours clairs et ils induisent en erreur lors de notre progression dans le jeu. La voix de l'actrice est excellente mais on ne l'entend pas très bien ce qui également fort dommage!

They keep following me!

Sylvio n'est pas un jeu parfait mais il a une âme, un vrai sens de l'histoire et l'utilisation du magnétophone apporte un réel plus! On se croirait dans un film d'horreur des années 80, l'hémoglobine et les ectoplasmes en moins! Non exempt de bugs gênants, le jeu reste jouable du début à la fin sans réelle perte d'intérêt graduelle qui plombe la plupart des jeux du genre. Le final est brillant même si on a besoin de quelques temps pour bien comprendre ce qu'il s'est réellement passé. En fonction de ce que vous avez trouvé dans les niveaux, vous découvrirez des éléments en plus à la fin. Si les versions PS4 et Xbox One utilisent la même version que celle à laquelle j'ai joué, vous ne devriez pas être déçus!",1483562183,1483562183,True,7,0,0.623837471008300781,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The ambience was pretty decent too, at least until the last level where it suddenly when dead quiet. That last level felt rushed and amateur compared to the decent quality of the rest of the game.

The mechanics using audio and diving into EVP were really good and the events were eerily disturbing. The story was there, but at the end I was left very confused. Even after discovering all the voices and ghosts, I still don't really understand what happened at the end and I feel empty, for lack of a better word, at the overall experience.

[h1]あらすじ[/h1]
1971年に地滑りで閉鎖された、Saginawという元遊園地で起こる怪現象を調査しに向かった
心霊録音家のJuliette Waters、しかしそこには心霊だけでなく陰謀が...という
わりとありがちな内容

[h1]いいとこ[/h1]
[b][u]①電子音声現象(EVP)をテーマとしたアドベンチャー要素[/u][/b]
録音機に混ざり込んだ謎の音声、果たしてそれはなんなのか、何を伝えようとしているのか...
録音したテープを早送りしたり、巻き戻ししたりして解明していくスタイルなので
よくあるホラーゲームのようにドーン！バーン！ギャー！というお化け屋敷タイプではなく、
気がついたら鳥肌立ってた的な、意味がわかると怖いコピペみたいな、
じんわりにじみ出る類いのホラー感を味わえる
既に廃園した廃墟の情景も、一応恐怖を盛り上げるのに一役買っている

[h1]わるいとこ[/h1]
[b][u]①どうみても説明不足[/u][/b]
ゲーム内で手に入る書類や音声を集めても、理屈で説明できないところがある
ホラーなんだから理屈で説明できないのはしゃあないとは言えるけれども、
それはプレイヤーに考慮の余地を残しているのではなく、単に説明不足なだけ
(結局、Sylvioってなんだったの？)

例えば、Saginawに出没する悪霊は尖った弾で倒すことができるが、その理由の説明がない
エコーナイトシリーズのように、電気を点けて退けるとか
幽霊の思い残したことを叶えてやると成仏するとか、そういうなるほどねと頷ける要素がなく、
先込め式の空気銃でﾎﾟﾌﾝﾎﾟﾌﾝして尖った弾を当てるだけなので、
「何かよく分かんないけどﾎﾟﾌﾝﾎﾟﾌﾝしとけばええんやろ」ってなってしまい、恐怖感が薄れる
恐怖感が薄れてしまうと、作業感が半端ないという負のスパイラル

なお、謎解きも結局悪霊からヒントを聞かないと先に進めないので、
何回も、何十回もテープをいじることになる
もっと録音だけでなく、監視カメラの映像とか、そういうバリエーションがほしかった

[b][u]②主人公が電波[/u][/b]
プレイヤーは、主人公の視点でSaginawであったことを追体験する方式なのだが、
主人公が女性のわりに鉄製の棚を持ち歩いたり、
唐突に聞いたこともない人物の名前を呼んでみたり、
(音声ログで名前が出るので、ログを聞けば分かるのだが、ログ拾ってなくても呼ぶ)
そもそもSaginawにも不法侵入してたりと
プレイヤーとして見た時に、「うわぁ、何だコイツ」と思わせる要素が多い
せっかく主観視点で没入度高めてるのにそれはないでしょうよ

[b][u]③マップの繋がりがよくわからない[/u][/b]
サイレントヒルシリーズのように、「思い出の場所を回る」とか
そういうテーマがなく、とりあえず示された方向に進むだけなので
個々のマップの繋がりを感じられない
結果、「ハイここ終わり！じゃ次行くか」みたいな流れ作業感を産んでしまい、
マップに思い入れが残らない

[b][u]④主人公の喋り以外、字幕が出ない[/u][/b]
ムービーだと主人公の喋りにすら字幕が出ない上、
残された音声ログもテープ録音なのでそこまで音質がいいとは言えない状態
しかも主人公はウィスパーボイスだし、音声ログの人は発音がやや特殊だし
聞き取った音声のメモはこれもやや癖のある筆記体で書いてあるしで、
そもそもこいつ何言ってるんじゃい！というところが何度かあった
開発によると、「ユニティだと音声ログとかに字幕つけられないのゴメンネてへぺろ」
とのことなので、今後も対応することはないと思われる

It's a bit annoying, but I'll have to wait for a new PC.

The Story of this scary park is really cool. 
I don't understand the whole Story yet, but I really wanna try to figure out. 
It's nice, that there so many personal stories. Of the single ghosts, Bobby, the park and the native american Ghost ""Sylvio""

Despite a few glitches and textures being a little funny, the game looks and runs incredibly. 
 
 None of the mechanics are flashy or cool, which isn't a bad thing. There are so many studios that break their games trying to chase the cool factor. It's good to see this studio build a few mechanics that hold up the game, create a good environment to use the mechanics in, and leave it the heck alone and let the story of the game unfold at the speed of the player. It seems weird to compare a title like this to Half-Life, but the refined-yet-unpolished mechanics make it an apt association to make. Instead of using a physics engine to build a story around, they used sound recordings. 
 
 The voice acting and sound production are done with more flair and polish than the visuals, which is a sign that they knew what game they were making throughout the production process. (Without giving too much away, if the sound wasn't spot-on the game would have suffered immensely.)  The actress for the main character is impeccable; being somber, wistful, likeable and relateable all at once. She acts as the narrator, and is the only steady, recognizable character in the game. (So far, I'm only a few hours in right now.) The other voice acting is haunting and chilling at times. I wouldn't consider it dialogue in a traditional sense, but it is certainly worth noting. The music is well done, and never overdone. 
 
 The visuals are dense and dark, with browns and reds making up much of the color palette. It paints the environment in such a way that makes it seem foreboding and dark without falling into the trap many other horror games do of obnoxiously obscuring your vision with darkness and thick fog. The textures are sort of all over the place, I have to admit. Important stuff will be decently textured and look smooth, while more meaningless scenery looks like something from the N64 era. As I said though, this criticism becomes a compliment when you look at the larger work and see that they focused on the features that would make the better game, and really, they performed miracles with what little they had to work with with graphically. 
  
 If I had one wish for this developer, however big they become or whatever direction they take their company, I hope they retain the genius, ingenuity and focus that they showed in this title.",1471495438,1471495505,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As to the world built around this mechanic:  between great synth music, unexplained and bizarre plot elements, (sometimes) backwards voices, and other unsettling elements and settings, Sylvio is quirky to a fault and has a Lynchian feel... or maybe Euro-Lynchian (since Lynch tends to be much more distinctly American in his weirdness).  This isn't a horror game in the same sense as most entries in the genre; it's hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck eerieness rather than breathless, visceral suspense and terror.  And it works well; but only when indie clunkiness and other frustrating aspects of the game stay out of the way.

My primary frustrations include:

--Combat:  combat in Sylvio is usually a chore, especially because most of the threats are [spoiler]invisible[/spoiler] when they first materialize (and often stay so for far longer than would be needed to instill confusion and panic in the player).  This problem becomes most frustrating in interior environments.  I never did figure out what triggered the enemies to become [spoiler]visible[/spoiler], instead resorting to ""kiting"" them until they deigned to make themselves vulnerable to my attacks.

--Insuffient introduction to mechanics:  closely-related to combat, there is far to little in the way of tutorial.  Even after reading the in-game help/instructions, it took me quite a long time and many frustrating deaths trying to understand the logic of the game world.  I realize that mystery is an important ingredient of Sylvio's spell, but a tiny bit of mystery in gameplay mechanics goes a LONG way.

--Closed world:  in a game so focused on collectibles, the inability to return to previous areas (with the exception of the [spoiler]Main Park[/spoiler] area) is unnecessarily restrictive, especially given the relatively long total running time and the lack of narrative-related reasons preventing Juliette from re-exploring areas.  For completionist-minded players (such as myself), awareness of this limitation creates tension that pulls the player out of the gameworld and narrative.

--Lack of gameplay variety:  although I generally disliked the combat in Sylvio, I could still see that without it there would have been too few mechanics to sustain the experience.  And even with combat included, I found that repeating the same basic steps as I entered each new area became a bit tedious by the final few sections.  Perhaps the audio manipulation could have featured even more prominently, with more variety, and been introduced more gradually as Juliette 'learns' how to use her new equipment?

Sylvio is a welcome and unique addition to the horror genre, without a doubt.  But this makes it all the more disappointing that it can be so unenjoyable to play.  Still, I have high hopes that Sylvio 2 (which I understand is in development) can overcome some of these shortcomings.

Yes. You are a ghost whisperer investigating an abandoned amusement park. You use an electronic device to record the atmosphere, play it back at various speeds, forwards and backwards, and listen to words and phrases trying to piece together the mystery of the lost souls who remain. 

I really liked the idea behind this game and definitely give it thumbs up for being unique. The only thing that I found silly was the weapon of choice in this game. lol. [spoiler]A potato gun.[/spoiler] I'm still on the fence with the game ending... more about that later.

What this game is: 
lots of walking. (no running at all)
lots of puzzles/problems to solve in every map.
spooky/eerie
calm and slow paced, but not to the point of boring
yes, there are ghosts. Aggressive ones too.
and yes, it is possible to die.

What this game is NOT:
outlast or amnesia.
jump scares.
ghostbusters.
gory/disgusting/bloody/etc.
terrifying.

If you're the kind of person who likes to watch ghost stories on tv, or wants to try talking to ghosts in cemetaries or abandoned buildings with weird histories, or simply intrigued with the supernatural, you will probably enjoy this game.

Do I recommend this game? Yes!

Le jeu est à la première personne, on s'éclaire à l'aide d'une lampe-torche et l'on explore de grands environnements plutôt vides. Jusque-là, rien de novateur. Là où Sylvio tire son épingle du jeu, c'est en offrant la possibilité d'enregistrer des voix fantomatiques à l'aide d'un micro et d'un enregistreur à bandes. Certains mots sont résiduels et peuvent être captés à des endroits précis, alors que d'autres peuvent seulement être enregistrés après avoir détruit une entité sombre qui vous fait recommencer au début du niveau si elle vous attrape (mais votre progression ne sera pas effacée, il n'y a pas de game over dans ce jeu). Vous utiliserez votre micro pour traquer les entités et un genre de lance-patates fabrication artisanale pour tirer des clous, bris de verres ou écrous pour la détruire, cela fait, vous aurez un enregistrement plus long, qui pourra être écouté en lecture avant ou arrière, en trois vitesses différentes : normale, rapide et lente.  Il faudra bien utiliser l'enregistreur de manière à comprendre tous les mots sur l'enregistrement, ce qui débloquera des objets nécessaires pour progresser ainsi que des morceaux de partitions de piano éparpillés sur les niveaux. (bien qu'avoir toutes les partitions ne débloquera rien d'autre qu'un succès Steam, malheureusement). Une fois tous les enregistrements trouvés, une entité à silhouette humaine géante apparaîtra, faisant office de boss de niveau. Une fois éliminée, vous aurez un autre enregistrement puis vous pourrez faire une séance de spiritisme en posant des questions à une personne défunte. Puis on passe à une séquence en voiture durant laquelle on traque un esprit sous forme de corbeau en vue de trouver l'entrée du niveau suivant.
Chaque niveau offre son lot d'environnements et de puzzles, le lance-patate peut aussi être chargé avec des patates, balles... qui peuvent pousser des objets et déclencher des mécanismes. L'histoire va rapidement se révéler bien plus sombre que prévue, avec des enregistrements laissés par un certain Bobby nous éclairant un peu. Le jeu utilise des environnements délabrés, des sons intriguant et des mots inquiétants pour suggérer l'angoisse, il n'y a pas de screamers ou de fantômes qui vous attendent au tournant, mais plutôt des enregistrements ou des réponses à des questions genre « où es-tu ? » « A côté de toi. ». On se croirant dans les émissions de chasseurs de fantômes, sauf que là on est servi.
Pour conclure, je dirais que c'est un bon jeu dans l'ensemble, développé par une seule personne, original, malgré quelques bugs de collision gênants, surtout vers la fin du jeu, et quelques puzzles vraiment pas intuitifs à résoudre.

With some soft spoken scares and a slow burning horror, this is something to lose some sleep over for me. Sylvio is probably going to go down as my favorite horror game. It's a little early yet, but I'm already in love with it. It's odd...and that's why it's so great. Sometimes, Sylvio is trying to do different things at once because it knows it doesn't have to be just one thing. Horror doesn't have to be about making a player constantly piss themselves. And I think that's what makes it great. The fact it's juggling a few things at once? Sure. Let's embrace it.

Sure, collecting EVPs and hearing those ghostly voices from ""beyond the grave"" is enough of a horror premise, but it's the story that you slowly put together from the ravaged land around you and these little voices whispering about the trees and these mysterious deaths they suffered. That makes this game all the more spooky.

Sylvio is also throwing in a few things that aren't exactly needed, but do give the game some charm and force it to stand out compared to other generic horror games. There's some basic shooting. Nothing you need to headshot with, but enough to keep the angry spirits away. I wonder why they don't like shards of glass and nails, considering they don't have a body. I mean...eh. No spoilers. No spoilers, I actually know what happens even if I'm not there yet. Anyway, rather than add on something that makes this clunky and unneeded, it's sort of nice. There's a bit of anxiety while you're wielding your microphone and you're ganked by an angry orb. You do have to figure out the best ammo to help you while managing collecting recordings. It's a pretty interesting combo. Sort of the whole ""you got your chocolate in my peanut butter"" sensation that we all can't live without.

There's also a bit of wonky platforming going on. You feel like a weird sort of Mario or Sly Cooper, except you're Juliette...and you're trying to help some ghosts pass on...and uncover one creeptastic mystery of a family ""fun"" park. Hah. Fun. Yeah real fun. This platforming may cause you to think you've broken the game, but chances are you didn't. You were supposed to hop that fence. You were supposed to find that hole. It's all intended and part of the design... And through hopping around, you'll actually progress the plot. So feel free to climb on things! Admittedly, it's an odd feeling. If you've stood in the middle of Stormwind (or any major city/town) in World of Warcraft and just attempted to jump on everything, that's sort of the feeling you're going to get. This isn't bad. You're just going to feel really weird and like you're breaking the rules.

The story is haunting. The bloody reds of the land make you think about just how tainted that soil must be with all of the people who died in the disaster and other things that the ""helpful"" ghostly voices suggest to you. It's a pretty beautiful picture. A pretty spooky picture, if I might say. Places are decaying and have proper technology for the time period (yay 70s tech). Everything is researched correctly. Do you smell that? It's the smell of someone who got it right. Ahhhh. Someone who cared enough to do a good job. I've noticed some mention our leading lady's voice, but... I like it. I'm really not looking for someone hyperactive and peppy when she talks to herself. A mumble and a soft musing to herself in passing while she's doing her work? That sounds about accurate when someone is talking to themselves. She sounds authentic as a person to me. For this, I find most of the game very appealing and even worth mentioning because it's better than what I was expecting. Please. Don't feel ""inspired"". Do what you're doing. You feel more real to me.

When you play this game, it's not going to tell you anything. At least, that's my experience. Read the instructions, scrub. Get lost? Pull them up in game. Lost in game? Hold out your microphone and let the spirits guide you. Creepy but effective. I would have liked some instruction. I don't need a lot! I'm an independent gamer who don't need no tutorial level! Just...some sort of instruction. Something small. A blurb. Though I have to admit, just flashing use buttons in front of me did give me the right idea since I had bothered to read the instructions a few times. A minor gripe. It's just me.

A more major gripe is the car. I hate the car. I understand it's useful considering some maps are huge, but the controls for the car are absolute garbage. Considering the area isn't flat and you'll constantly run into trees or you're stuck trying to figure out if the car is in reverse mode or forward mode (yeah left and right will get switched if you're in one or the other, I've found!). That's something I would personally remove from the game entirely. It's not helpful. It's frustrating. It added on so much extra time and most of that was spent flipping my car over constantly. I've played similar portions to that in my driver's ed class when I was about fifteen years old. Listen, I'm over it. If I wanted to play that, I still have the link TEN YEARS LATER. I'm over it. Really. If the controls could be a little more polished, awesome. But honestly? Juliette runs better on foot and I find more EVPs that way, so the car is garbage. It was great for the purpose, and it's just garbage otherwise. You can just get out of the car and run. This is allowed. I feel like this choice makes up for it, but you gave us a pretty car... I'd like to use the pretty thing without it not working.

That rant out of the way? Please don't let that deter you from the game. I'm quite a fan of a slow burn horror that doesn't rely on jump scares. There are few in the game, if any. This story disturbs and upsets me, yet I want to keep playing not only to see it through, but because the EVP function is so unique and fun. It's delightfully creepy and I also feel heartbroken because you can hear the sadness from some of the named souls you're communicating with. It's a wonderful experience. Repeat after me. WE CAN DITCH THE CAR. This is not Thelma and Louise. It doesn't have to go over the cliff with us!

So...it's not Outlast. It's not a jumpscare fest of ""OOOH RUN FROM THE SILLY-FACED MONSTER!"" like Amnesia. This is a thinking horror game. You have to really take in the details and just sit there while realizing, my god they did this in a game! This is something you'd find in your worst nightmares or played out in some sort of horror series on tv! It's good! I mean, hey, it's not perfect! But it's certainly better than what I'm watching on tv right now!

Nothing badly flashy so far. I compared this to the original Sylvio that had a great deal of distortion during the fighting sequence with the uh, ""mean orbs"" and that would probably give you more health issues than this. But so far, I've been able to play this without any major problems. It's a pretty nice game...and they didn't force me to play the car part, so that felt awfully nice!

Please play. I'd honestly say this is something to offer to people who love ghost hunting shows, horror games that are not what everyone else is clamoring for, and people who may not be used to heavy horror jump scares but might want to try out a horror game. It's got a bit of mystery to it, so mystery lovers may also enjoy if they're willing to embrace a paranormal element.

A very nice game. Again, probably going to be my favorite horror game...and I'll just...ditch that car in the clay somewhere and ride on an overgrown raven to somewhere nice.

And horror is not really present, probably because danger is not there either. It's a dark ambience, but that's all the horror you will find here. 

Story seems minimalist after the firt try: I didn't really understand what it was about in details (but it may be intentional by the devs.). I prefer game with more story, but I was surprise to find out how compelling this story was. 

It took me 9 hours to complete and, by the end, it was becoming a little tedious and repetitive.

It does things in a very unique and interesting way and it all boils down to the fact, that the game is all centered around the EVP - Electronic Voice Phenomena. If you were every interested in any paranormal things you might understand that no matter how unscientific and disproven this is, it can still be a thrilling theme to explore. Hence the popularity of the topic not only in classic horror movies, but in modern ones as well. Yet, surprisingly, not a single game (to my knowledge) before Sylvio has dedicated itself fully to it.

Your main tool in this game is your is a reel-to-reel tape recorder that can play recorded audio at different speeds forwards or backwards. Which is important, because the voices you will hear in the dark can be speaking not ""normally"", but slowly and backwards, for example. It's a simple enough puzzle gimmick and not hard to master, but it creates a genuine sense of mystery and thrill, when you're recording some long died kid's voice in the middle of nowhere and suddenly in the same recording you hear a different voice say backwards ""he's mine"". It's such a simple yet effective way to tell a story - in short disjointed messages you record and decipher, - and to build an atmosphere that it doesn't get old until the end of the game.

What does get a bit old is ""hunting ghosts"" - angry black clouds and human silhouettes, - with a weird rifle you find early in the game, that shoots blunt objects to solve simple physics puzzles and sharp objects to pacify the aforementioned ghosts. It starts surprising and creepy, but later becomes a simple routine as you can't actually die or lose meaningful progress in the game and these black ghosts are very much finite per level, as each one leaves a message to decipher. The rifle ammo and pressure management becomes pretty annoying in later levels too, one funfair-themed one in particular long overstays its welcome and relies heavily on using the rifle in a very unfun way.

In addition, the game can be quite buggy. The hub-map you revisit between levels, for example, is traversed with a car and that car can behave abnormally or you can exit it and suddenly ploish through the floor, which sometimes spawns you above the level, but sometimes doesn't and you have to restart the game (it does save all the things you've completed but you always start near the beginning of the level). It's a pretty ugly looking game as well, despite the Remastered version upping the looks. And the menu is very lacking in settings, while the help & controls option is just a huge image file you need to scroll, with no rebindable keys to speak of.

All in all, the game could've used a bigger budget upgrade with few levels and puzzles rethought and a switch to a fully open interconnected world Vanishing of Ethan Carter-like. But, we don't have that yet. What we have is a very exciting, atmospheric game with fantastic 80s horror synth soundtrack and unique mechanics. It's unforgettable and fun, despite it's shortcomings and honestly muddled ending, and I fully recommend people trying it out.

P.S. Is it a weird coincidence, that the game has a logo similar to Aphex Twin's, who released a new LP called ""Syro"" in 2014? Great record, by the way.

It's a good thing, then, that the makers of Sylvio understand the importance of SOUND in a horror game.  In fact, with the exception of the trifling fact that they forgot to include the noise of your character's own FOOTSTEPS, they've pretty much based their entire game around it.  That's the good news.   

   But before we get too far into the positive stuff, let's just concentrate on some early negative impressions.  Along with the whole ""silent footsteps"" thing, you'd be forgiven for thinking that your character possesses full-blown powers of LEVITATION, as she seems to almost ""float"" above the ground rather than travel about on terra firma like the rest of us.  She furthermore doesn't need her hands to hold flashlights and other objects in front of her.  

   Now, I know that such - let us say somewhat ""abstracted"" - interactive mechanics have hardly been uncommon since Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but when it's coupled with virtually nothing else which seems to ""ground"" your character in the real world...well, she almost might as well be one of the ghosts that she's chasing.  She also seems able to jump or fall down enormous distances without, say, breaking both her legs like any of us regular mortals would. 
 
   Luckily for the game, though, it soon becomes interesting and unusual enough that I mostly - MOSTLY - managed to get past these reservations, at least until I quit the game altogether about four hours in.  One way or another, there's certainly no denying that for all its ambition and relative innovation, it could have used quite a bit more polish before being unleashed on an unsuspecting public (especially at that price).
 
   Another thing which made it a tad hard for me to get into - something which all you staunchly anti-""handholding"" people are gonna chalk up as a pro, so what would I know? - is that it takes a while to get the gist of what exactly it is that the game wants you to ""do"".  I mean, there's a lot of things in this game which are hardly intuitive:  Not the controls (un-remappable; C for flashlight?), not the story (""I'm just sorta, kinda, gonna go in this big spooky park place and, I dunno, maybe talk to some ghosts, I guess""), and not the part where you use your microphone and tape player to decipher words or short phrases which the dead offer up to you, then get on-screen ""distance metres"" to tell you where you're supposed to go next as your ""reward"" for the information uncovered in the messages.

   A few of the puzzles are admittedly quite clever, so there's definitely some good ideas here, and the actual ""tape-decoding"" bits are suitably spooky and novel in execution...helped in no small part by the fact that the ghostly voices are, to begin with, Euros speaking in what is clearly not their first language - i.e. English - so by the time that you slow down and speed up the voices, or play them in reverse, they ARE quite genuinely eerie-sounding!
 
   Oh, and speaking of which, the voice acting is on the whole fairly decent - not great, but decent - and fuck it, the GAME on the whole is pretty decent, if by no means perfect or astonishing.  There's still a few other reservations that I have - some part of me isn't entirely sure that they shouldn't have passed on the infrequent and borderline-pointless ""combat"" elements of the game, for example, and just opted for an out-and-out ""walking simulator"" - but in the end, it was the extreme repetition and overall TEDIUM of the gaming experience which did in the patience of this particular player.  I mean, I like a moody, snail-like pace as much as the next guy, but this game takes such ""tasteful aesthetics"" to new and frankly trying extremes.
 
   I'm actually looking forward to the announced sequel to this game, because I think they got quite a lot ""right"" this time out, but also quite a bit ""wrong"".  Undeniably interesting devs, in any case.  I'm not gonna go so far as to say they've done something truly ""original"" here - I've already gotten in trouble for such bold claims in Steam reviews of late - but yes, definitely ""different"", and definitely worth a look to anyone who considers themselves genuinely interested in the numerous possibilities which the horror genre currently presents to game designers (maybe best to wait for a significant sale, though, just to be on the safe side).

score : 8/10

Playing as Juliette Waters, you find yourself trapped in an abandoned family park and with the help of your gadgets, you have to discover the dark (ghost) story of the park and the landslide.

+ Excellent atmosphere, tense and very dark, no jump scares, presentation is very unique despite the fact that graphics could have been a lot better. The ghost bosses are fairly impressive and immersive.
+ No optimization issues, unity engine runs fine here.
+ Fantastic soundtrack, excellent voice acting and the in-game music is perhaps the best part of the game technically.
+ Gameplay seems a bit complicated at the beginning, until you find out how to use the gadgets and especially the gun, since the puzzles are sometimes tricky (especially those that require the use of the gun). You get clues of your next goal by using a stereo microphone which records sounds and points the way to spiritual activity. You interview ghosts and with the reel recorder you analyze and find hidden clues. You use the gun to solve puzzles and defeat the bad ghosts. Beware the gun can be loaded with things like rocks and then can be used to solve puzzles by hitting  doors and levers or spikes and pieces of glass so that you can hit and defeat the ghosts. Some inventory based puzzles as well which are fairly obvious. Not much to find exploring rather than some notes in shelves and  some piano sheets. You can move around by using an old yellow car...
+ Quite a long game, took me over 10 hours to complete.

- I have seen  better looking games using unity engine (and many worse ofcourse), but this is saved by the unique atmosphere.
- There is some platforming involved in the gameplay, which is not as smooth as it should be. Most of the times you are not sure if you are supposed to go that way or it's a bug of the engine.
- Could use some better explanation as far as gameplay mechanics are concerned. 

Highly recommended 1st person horror adventure game, for its originality and fantastic atmosphere alone. There is no comparison with those generic unity horror games , this one is an original and fresh game, with great ideas that are implemented just fine in the gameplay.

At first glance its very obvious that it’s a first person Unity horror game, what with its very unpolished appearance, and the game is bit buggy and janky with some uneven and unfocused gameplay elements like awkward platforming, driving, and combat, but what really elevates the game to make it far superior to most of its indie horror brethren is the ghost recording mechanic and its atmosphere. Recording and deciphering the voices of the dead using an old reel to reel really sets up a creepy atmosphere, that while it won’t keep you up at night, it still really sets an unsettling tone. There are no jump scares here, just pure atmosphere. The soundtrack also really helps and other reviews have said it’s got this synthy John Carpenter movie vibe to it which is neat.

Sadly the penultimate level is bad, with convoluted design and gimmicks and the ending is just super abrupt and vague, even if you get all the piano sheets. The game itself could have had smaller levels in general like the cellar and the old house areas were, because sometimes there can be a little to much wandering around.

Almost everything fun about it is counteracted by something else which is no fun at all. 

Finding and recording the voices of the dead -> wandering aimlessly in the dark without any navigational tools, waving a microphone around, for hours. 

Ghost-busting shenanigans -> Getting ambushed by black blobs coming through the walls or ceiling with little warning, and no real challenge to fighting them if you can just engage them from a distance. 

Mysterious supernatural plot -> puzzles that are almost solved for you thanks to map markers showing items of significance, coupled with a few very uninuitive uses of a gas-powered blunderbuss. 

Then are are a few things I just don't like at all - too much of the game's actual story is entirely missable, hidden behind little documents on bookshelves or tape reels left in random locations. The textures are bad enough that I usually have to determine what objects are by shape alone. Despite the huge number of collectible items, backtracking is not possible for most of the game. The game's save system is only semi-functional: it only autosaves, but it doesn't keep track of your physical location on a game map or what triggers you have hit already and sometimes loses Voices you have collected. Artificial fog and a red filter make it hard to see where you're going. The environment is bleak, but not really scary or unsettling. Death-by-ghost has no meaningful consequences, so they're not scary so much as they are annoying. Problems, problems, problems!

Beyond the novelty of using a tape recorder to play spooky noises backwards and slowed down, I don't think there is a thing about this game that would make me recommend it to others.

On the other side, Sylvio does one thing right: Atmosphere, and especially sound design. The EVPs sound just as you would expect to hear them in classical horror movies, and as you want to find as many EVP fragments as possible, you'll constantly run around with the micro out - which means that your ears will be filled with the noise of static and various creepy background noises. These alone often suffice to keep you on the edge of your seat as you walk through the game's dark forests, but it can become absolutely terrifying when you turn around and suddenly get a strong signal, signifying that a hostile ghost in closing in on you.

That being said: Sylvio's atmosphere may be very good, but I'm fairly certain many people will be disappointed by the game because of its many issues when it comes to polish and overall gameplay.

From that description alone, it would seem doomed for genericity - but this is perhaps the most innovative, unique horror title of 2015.

The first chapter does a great job of familiarizing you with the game's quirkiness. You're granted a blunderbuss that shoots potatoes. You fight against almost laughably unintimidating spheres of moving black mass. The protagonist voices her lines emotionlessly, almost inaudibly. You may be tempted to write off the game right then and there, and unfortunately, many do.

Sylvio's debilitatingly bizarre presentation obscures an incredibly impressive gameplay mechanic that serves as the core of all the spine-chilling, goosebumps-giving, jaw-dropping moments in the game: the EVP audio equipment and its accompanying sound design. The true star of this game. (Sorry, Juliette!)

Using the audio equipment, you will be inspecting every corner of the map for ghostly sounds that you can record and subsequently play back and hunt for clues. Through backmasking, rewinding, fast-forwarding and slowing down the audio, you'll hear all sorts of voices from the beyond. Some are helpful, some are not, and some are even... hostile.

I finished the game in roughly 10 hours, though you can complete it in a solid 8 if you're not interested in finding the many collectibles that shed more light on the stories you encounter. To be honest, the game overstays its welcome a bit towards the end, and drags a little in some parts. Fortunately, the synth-laden soundtrack and static-ridden locations in the game provide just enough of a dynamic feel to make it a worthwhile journey.

As a closing remark, the main complaints I have heard are about the voice of the protagonist, Juliette. It's a divisive voice that may make or break your experience with the game - but she doesn't speak much except for during seances, so I can't say I identify with the chagrin.

The sound recorder was a game mechanic I hadn’t seen done before and it is a very interesting idea.

Sadly though, the entire game is poorly executed.

First there is the controls. ‘C’ for flashlight, really? There’s no crouching, no sprinting. For some reason the scroll wheel turns the character left and right, jumping is inconsistent. It was incredibly frustrating when I needed to jump on a stack of sewer pipes to get to another area. The stack is right on the edge of the jump height, so if you don’t jump from exactly the right place you can’t get on the stack. Queue five minutes of trying to find just the right spot to jump from.	

There’s also no cursor on the main menu for some reason, forcing you to navigate it with the arrow keys. There is on the settings menu though, just not the main one, giving me the impression the dev was just too lazy to use clickable buttons on the main menu.

All in all, from the controls my impression was it was a very bad port of an old PS2 game and the graphics are in line with this. So I was surprised to find out it is not a port, it was developed for PC on the Unity engine. 

Then there’s the gameplay itself. The little jumpscares are predictable and not particularly scary, the atmosphere is kind of meh. Maybe I’ve just been desensitized too much, but I didn’t find it scary in the least.

The tutorial screens are also annoying as hell, covering 3/4 of the screen and they displayed the same thing repeatedly with no way to turn them off.

The flashlight is also useless, as it doesn’t even light up the dark areas. You might expect a dark corner to become visible when you shine a light at it, but it doesn’t, it remains dark no matter what.",1446428502,1446428766,False,3,0,0.465444296598434448,1,False,False,False,False,,,

The graphics are ugly as hell, but the audio design is the real star here; a fabulously moody soundtrack combined with a clever sound-scrubbing minigame makes for quite an impressive atmosphere.

All in all this is one of the most relaxing horror-themed games I've ever played. There are no jump scares to speak of; early on you receive a homemade gas-powered shotgun that can be used to remove obstacles including a few types of ghostly entities that I won't spoil. The fear comes mostly from capitalizing on the sensation of being stuck in the forest in the middle of the night with no choice but to delve deeper into a disturbing mystery, at which Sylvio excels.

My only gripe would be that some of the detective work required is sadistically specific. You need to analyze EVP to receive waypoints for integral objects in the game-world, which means you'll spend most of the game wandering around with your microphone out performing seances and listening for voices in the static. That's fine, but only seances and boss fights receive a bearing from your microphone; the majority of audio clues are masked in clouds of ""orbs"" scattered around the enormous maps. Most of the time these clouds are gathered around logical markers like ruined playground equipment or the wrecks of cars, but many are located in completely non-intuitive, out-of-the-way places that are frustratingly easy to miss, meaning often you'll be moving on to a new area without a 100% completion rate. 

This is a problem because in order to get the ""good"" ending you have to capture every scrap of evidence in the game. Considering there are absolutely NO walkthroughs of this game online, this is next to impossible, and the ""standard"" ending is highly anti-climactic, to say the least.

Regardless, this is one of the most unique gaming experiences I've ever had, and I loved practically every second of it. Highly recommended for horror fans.",1445203479,1445203479,True,4,0,0.395962774753570557,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is not a game of jump scares, so don't expect to see it on the youtube channels of those who make a living off squealing at games. Instead it is a slow burn as your character explores an abandoned tourist attraction trying to find the solution to a decades old mystery. The atmosphere is one of tragedy and oppressive decay rather than outright horror.

 The mystery is compelling and draws you in as you go from ghost to ghost, seance to seance, attempting to uncover just what happened to the people here and the circumstances of their downfall. The presentation is quite basic, the game was developed by a very small indie team, but the unique ghost recording gameplay carries the day and presentation aside, the game has a lot of atmosphere. 

 The game will keep you playing to the end in order to solve the mystery and there lies my greatest gripe, I really did not enjoy the ending. It is ambigious to a fault with no sense of closure whatsoever. There are extremely vague clues as to what the ending might mean but all of it is really up to speculation, and not in that good way you can chew over, as there simply isn'tt enough meat to chew on. I actually had to wait before writing this review or it would have been a not recommended, but once I had a breather I realsied that ending aside, the ghost recording mechanic had been enough to carry me through 12 hours of gameplay to the game end. That alone means it did enough right to warrant a thumbs up from me. There are pieces of piano pages you can collect throughout the game, I had all but one when the credits rolled. Perhaps if you had them all a better ending materializes?

Pros:
Novel ghost recording gameplay mechanic as the central driving force
Good atmosphere
The desire to solve the mystery is compelling

Cons:
Presentation shows its indie roots and limited budget
Unsatisfying conclusion

Pros:
-Amazing sound direction; each audio log and ghost voice is creepy and fun to find
-Game sets up a very creepy world and they developers tried to add a ton of content
-They have a ton of great deceased people that you converse with and it's exciting to learn what happened to them and learn about what happened to the park in the 70's
-The 2nd kind of enemy you encounter is huge and very, very creepy

Cons:
-Didn't scare me as much as just creeped me out
-Graphics are very poor
-Gamepage controls are awkward
-The gun mechanic is sloppy and not executed well
-The driving is the worst, hands down
-Enemies are shadowy but come off as not well designed; needed some actual details instead 
-Some areas w/ driving are too large and seem to just be filler offering no redeeming gameplay value
-Jumping into something results in an annoying kick back
-You can fall from any distance without any consequence
-The game abandons its best feature (audio reels) for the worst puzzles ever
-They abandoned their best feature (audio reels) in the most important last levels for no reason
-The ending did nothing to shed light on what the hell the entire game was about

Vous êtes Juliette Waters, une femme spécialisée dans les phénomènes de voix électronique qui va s'aventurer dans un parc d'attractions détruit par un glissement de terrain en 1971. L'endroit semble parfait pour essayer son nouveau matériel d'enregistrement mais à peine s'est-elle introduite dans l'enceinte du parc qu'elle s'y retrouve piégée. Les voix des âmes qui hantent les lieux sont alors sa seule aide pour comprendre les évènements qui se sont produits dans le parc et pour réussir à s'enfuir.

Sylvio propose ainsi un concept vraiment novateur très bien rendu au niveau du gameplay. Le micro que l'on possède nous permet d'enregistrer des voix qu'on pourra ensuite analyser en avançant ou rembobinant selon différentes vitesses. Les mots qui ressortent de l'écoute sont alors automatiquement notés dans votre carnet et une fois tous les mots trouvés, une croix vient nous indiquer qu'il n'y a plus rien à chercher de ce côté là. Plutôt bien vu car on aurait pu tripoter encore longtemps chaque enregistrement dans le cas contraire. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498624991 Ces voix sont d'ailleurs très convaincantes et les enregistrements ont été réalisés avec soin, ça donne vraiment des frissons. Jouez-y au casque pour une immersion parfaite !

Il y a plusieurs types de voix : [list]
[*] celles des esprits prenant la forme d'une orbe noire. Le micro comprend une [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498625011]indication de distance[/url] par rapport à ces esprits et il faudra se débarrasser d'eux en leur tirant dessus. En disparaissant ils vous laisseront un message contenant des mots-clés qui vous serviront dans votre résolution des puzzles (""clé"", ""trappe"", ""chaise"" etc...). Ces mots apparaitront ensuite dans l'environnement suivis d'un chiffre représentant leur distance par rapport à votre localisation. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=501012500 [*] celles des formes de vies humaines, des âmes qui ne sont pas conscientes de votre présence. Après les avoir trouvées à l'aide de votre micro vous devrez aussi leur tirer dessus mais elles ne chercheront pas à vous attaquer. A nouveau leur destruction vous permettra d'afficher des mots-clés sur l'environnement.
[*] les voix avec lesquelles vous pourrez avoir une conversation. Ces [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498624940]""séances""[/url] sont facultatives mais recommandées pour comprendre l'histoire. Elles sont toujours très intéressantes et très bien réalisées, on a vraiment l'impression de communiquer avec un esprit.
[*] les voix que l'on peut enregistrer dans l'environnement. Là aussi ces enregistrements sont facultatifs et il faudra explorer et tendre l'oreille pour les trouver. Les mots obtenus s'inscriront ensuite pêle-mêle sur votre carnet. 
[*] On trouvera aussi dix enregistrements du journal audio de Bobby, une personne qui a vécu dans le parc et qui explique son parcours depuis la catastrophe. Ici pas d'analyse audio, juste une écoute attentive pour comprendre le scénario.[/list]

J'en viens donc à l'un des défauts du jeu, le manque de sous-titres. Pas de sous-titres français, d'accord, on a l'habitude avec les jeux indépendants, ça se comprend mais pas de sous-titres anglais non plus. Autant vous dire que comprendre la voix de Juliette et celle de Bobby sur ces vieux enregistrements demandent un très bon niveau d'anglais. Heureusement que les mots analysés en écoutant les voix des morts sont notés sur un carnet.

En dehors de vos outils d'enregistrement vous aurez aussi une arme pour vous défendre et pour actionner des mécanismes. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=500875686 Les balles ""lisses"" telles que les balles de tennis ou les pierres vous permettent d'actionner des mécanismes à distance comme un monte-charge ou pour faire tomber un panneau barrant un chemin. Les balles ""coupantes"" comme des morceaux de verre, des clous, des vis vous permettront de venir à bout des mauvais esprits. Ces balles seront propulsées par la pression de l'air obtenue en vissant une canette sur le fusil. Vous en trouverez en bon nombre tout comme les munitions qui se trouvent un peu partout et de manière illimitée.
Le fusil manque de précision et parfois même si l'on touche un objet l'environnement ne réagit pas. Une fonction permet cependant d'avoir un aperçu de la trajectoire de notre balle afin d'éviter de tout gaspiller en vain. 
Selon moi le jeu aurait pu se passer de cette arme et se concentrer encore plus sur l'écoute des voix. Le fusil n'apporte au final pas grand chose et l'ambiance est telle que l'ajout d'ennemis n'était pas forcément recommandée, au contraire le réalisme apporté par l'écoute et l'analyse des voix est mis à mal face à ces gros ""blobs"" noirs. A la limite un design plus ""humain"" des ennemis aurait pu fonctionner, cela aurait été plus convaincant en tout cas.

On alterne entre plusieurs types de niveaux tout au long du jeu. Des niveaux courts où on se retrouve dans la forêt à suivre des voix jusqu'à arriver à un niveau long où l'on aura à combattre des ennemis et à résoudre des énigmes. On suit toujours le même cheminement : on commence à visiter les lieux et on doit combattre une orbe noire, on continue l'exploration et il en vient une deuxième puis une troisième, parfois plus. Ensuite il faudra venir à bout d'une forme de vie humaine. Là on a tous les mots-clés pour le niveau et on peut commencer à assembler les pièces du puzzle jusqu'à pouvoir passer au niveau suivant non sans avoir effectué une séance d'écoute et avoir exploré un peu les lieux pour recueillir d'autres mots ou ramasser des partitions (dont l'utilité m'est inconnue, une fin alternative peut-être ?). Au final c'est très répétitif et on finit par se lasser du combat avec les ennemis, tellement prévisible.
Les énigmes sont quant à elles très étranges par moment, autant certaines choses sont logiques comme actionner un moulin pour obtenir de l'électricité autant je n'ai pas compris comment brûler 4 corbeaux préalablement assommés pouvait permettre d'allumer un projecteur ni pourquoi effectuer un signal lumineux permettait de passer au niveau suivant. C'est juste moi ou c'est très illogique comme progression ?

Pour continuer sur les défauts du jeux je rajouterai que certaines phases nécessitant de la précision ne sont pas adaptées à ce type de jeu où l'on ne peut pas voir ses pieds ce qui rend les sauts plutôt aléatoires et on devra bien souvent recommencer non sans avoir perdu en immersion dans le jeu. 
Les graphismes sont quant à eux datés et les environnements plutôt fades, pourquoi avoir placé l'action dans un lieu si peu original ? J'aurai préféré que Juliette soit appelée chez des particuliers par exemple, j'ai trouvé le parc d'attraction très cliché. Toutefois l'histoire qui se cache derrière le parc est intéressante, si seulement on nous donnait plus d'informations... Je comprend que le jeu mise sur son mystère mais là il laisse trop de questions sans réponses, les quelques phrases obtenues après les séances ne suffisent pas à nous donner une trame à suivre. Tellement dommage parce que l'ambiance était réussie.

En tout et pour tout Sylvio n'est pas parfait. Très réussi sur le plan de l'ambiance sonore et avec un concept original il manque de cohérence dans ses énigmes et nous sert un scénario trop décousu pour être pleinement compris et apprécié. Malgré tout Sylvio est un jeu d'horreur unique en son genre.

THE GOOD: the mood in this game is generally on point, and the voice acting is good (every character has a swedish accent, but it doesn't really sound that weird to me). the scariest, most atmospheric part of the game is definitely listening to the audio and searching for hidden messages. the graphics are pretty enough. battling the ""human"" ghosts feels more like target practice than fighting, but it's still really cool (because they're huge, spoiler alrt). the music and sound design is REALLY well done.

THE BAD: like in many puzzle first-person games, there's way too much jumping, and there isn't even a lot of that. there aren't really any jumping mechanics to speak of, either, but players are probably used to the whole ""i'm a floating camera trying to land on this edge and not fall down for the millionth time"". it's not a huge deal, though. without spoiling anything, i'd also like to comment on the level design: it really isn't that great. the levels feel disjointed and just... weird, in the wrong way. also, lots of ground clipping through trees and fences in a way that just really looks kind of bad. while the driving mini game is cool looking, it's also sort of redundant and clumsy. from a player's perspective, not having to dodge a bunch of trees and awkwardly drive up/down hills would just feel a lot better. and it's a shame, too, because visually the car driving parts LOOK great and the music that starts playing during these sequences really help the mood. there are also a few bugs: my flashlight would occasionally disappear, as well as my microphone. i had to reload the game to make them come back. i'd also have preferred a traditional saving system where i save whenever and load whenever - now the game uses an autosave function and doesn't allow paralell playthroughs (starting a new game erases the autosave). the game (like EVERY indie horror game, ever, to be fair) also suffers from a major silent hill complex, which only serves to lessen its impact IMHO. i'm a huge silent hill fan, but maybe surreal level design and ""ooh maybe it's all a hallucination"" hints do not have to be in EVERY game, especially not a ghost hunting game. to capitalise on the scariness of ghosts, one should make their world feel MORE realistic rather than nightmarish/dreamlike/surreal.

i'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes to be spooked, it's without a doubt worth its price tag. sadly, technicals issues get in the way of the experience, and the areas should feel a bit more focused.",1438733075,1438733075,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

One of these concepts is explored in the game Sylvio, Kickstarter-funded and Greenlit by the Steam community, and is published and developed by Apostrophe. Being a horror game, especially one in first person which appears to be a rising trend in recent years thanks to Amnesia and Outlast, Sylvio has quite a lot to live up to, and it has a similar tone and atmosphere to the aforementioned games. In many ways, Sylvio succeeds in differentiating itself from the pack, but a few shortcomings prevent it from being the shining star it could have been.

Technically speaking, Sylvio isn't very polished. It's actually quite buggy at times, and while that is to be expected with games, no game is perfect after all, some of the bugs in the game can completely wreck the mood that the game is tiring so hard to set. Things like items clipping through the floor, getting stuck in random places and having to restart from the beginning of the sequence again. Building up tension is fine, but there's nothing worse than having to turn off the game because it freezes or something happens and you have to start from a point way back because of technical issues rather than your own failings.  Especially when the game itself has such a great concept and you have to muscle through it because of technical issues.

I've also found one very frustrating thing that I'd like to see fixed, but I guess that depends how deeply it's embeded into the game. 

The game has a very dark atmsophere, something similar to Silent Hill, but not near as gruesome. It's not really scarey in that I've only really been surprised once, but it does have a very suspensful tone to it. I am playing with an xBox 360 controller and that works really well. It only took me a short time to get the hang of playing the game. I'm stuck right now in an area where I know how to advance, but it's a timed thing and I just keep missing the jumps at the right time to move on.  While I can deal with that part of the game, although I don't like it, it's one place where the one fault I've found comes into play...you can't save the game where you want.  Personally I find this totally unacceptable. The game auto saves betwen ""chapters"". The issue I am having now is that after playing through the level and making spending time listening to the recordings and having a seance and figuring out what's next, I get to this one part that is a fairly hard ""puzzle"".  After a bit of trying and trying again, I get frustrated and quit.  The issue is that the next time I come into the game I have to play the entire level over again. 

Really guys, how hard is it to program in a manual game save or at least incorporate an auto-save every few minutes or after reaching some save point?


I'm addding to this review as the programmers have added somewhat of a saved game feature... thanx for doing that. Having said that the game still does have a couple of issues. The save game feature supposedly saves as you go along. So I tested that the other day. I started my current level over again and played through it for 10 minutes or so and then left the game.  Then later I went back into the game and it had sorted of saved the game. The game remembered that I had gone through the level in that things I had opened were already opened and things I had picked up were in my inventory.  I did have to ""physically"" begin at the start of the level again, but all I had to do was to walk thru to where I had stopped the last time.  At least I didn't have to gather and open and listen for things I'd already done that to previously. I do wish I could still say to save at this point and when I restart the game be taken to that same point, but this is definitely an improvement.

I did run into something that was very frustrating. I had been playing this level for a bit and was kind of stuck. I went into the settings... just to refresh myself as to what they were. While trying to exit the settings using the xBOX 360 controller, some button I pressed started me into a new game.  There was no waring that this was about to happen and when I got back into the game I double-checked the help file for the controller controls and no button should start a new game. So I had to play the game again from the start.  I was not happy about that, but fortuantely I wasn't very far in the game and I quickly caught back up to the place I'd been about an hour earlier. The only thing I can thnik of was that perhaps I'd pressed the button to take me to the menu and the top item in the menu is to do a new game, but the only thing I saw on the screen was the settings screen. 

I still give the game a thumbs-up as I think it has great potential, but these little frustrattions tend to color my opnion in the other direction.  If I could give it a 1-10 rating with 10 being excellent, I'd give it a 7 or 8.",1434252667,1438140783,True,2,0,0.437030971050262451,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I loved the setting, the style, and the premise behind the game. Nonetheless, I always tempure my expectations with these sorts of games, because there’s just something about video games that just doesn’t quite scare me as much as films do. Perhaps it’s the repetitious nature of video games that dulls down the scares as time goes on. Thankfully, I’m happy to say that Sylvio does a fantastic job of getting my adrenaline pumping.

The mouse works in the settings menu but not in the main menu.  There is sometimes no indication on what to press to proceed through a menu.  Enter is not a default key.

No keys are rebindable, the mouse is not invertable and the sensitivity may not be changed.

Turning and looking up and down carries this wierd momentum.  It's not mouse acceleration as a gamepad suffered the same problem.  It feels like Juliette has a 20KG weight strapped to the back of her head and it is as annoying as anything that has ever annoyed you in a video game.

Movement also has too much momentum which makes navigating the platforming sections unnecessarily frustrating.  Both gamepad sticks look around.  What was wrong with the usual RS move plus LS turn scheme?

The very first jump in the game glitched and I slowly sank into warning sign I was supposed to jump over.

The torch doesn't light black areas as the lighting is baked into the world mesh.  Generally world is dreary dark rather than moody dark.

The trees all glow red but with no indication of why're they're lit or why the rest of the world doesn't carry the same extreme red tinge.

Trees have been placed without consideration of where the ground is.  The trees in the intro float and many trees in-game have only their top branches above ground.

The microphone 'tutorial' menu kept popping up and eventually got stuck on-screen.

The graphics are extremely low texture and low polygon but still manage to have clashing styles.

Sylvio feels more like a proof of concept, as a full game that I have paid money for it is utterly not worth it.  Save your time - play something else.",1433671965,1433679530,False,43,2,0.490775108337402344,3,True,False,False,False,,,

It has so much intrigue and atmosphere, that you want to keep playing and finding clues and recordings. The voice acting is very well done, and in my opinion really adds to the game. Graphically speaking, it is not the best looking game out there, but the gameplay and the attention to the audio and recording device is really what drives the narrative of this game.

    The audio recorder and its place in the game are really well done. When you come across a recording with your mic out, the machine will automatically record it for you. You then can play it back and analyse it to your hearts content. Hear something strange? Play it backwards....still doesn't sound quite right play it backwards at super-slow speed. The recording device Is really the star of this game and you can tell alot of work and effort has gone into perfecting it.

    I really recommend this one if you are into horror/mystery type games, there have been a few jumpscares but nothing that scary so far. I also feel like I should mention the soundtrack, as it is reminiscent of old John Carpenter films like ""The Thing"", very synth heavy and really adds to the game.

Sylvio ist ein, zum Teil durch Kickstarter finanziertes, Indie First Person Horror Adventure. Bereits der Trailer macht Lust auf mehr. Vor allem die angenehme Musik und die schöne Stimme des Charackters Juliette Waters.
 
Das Spiel ist kein grafisches Highlight, aber das macht überhaupt nichts. Ich finde sogar, dass der Grafikstil zum Spiel und dessen Atmosphäre passt. 
Es gibt nicht viele Spiele die es schaffen, mir eine Gänsehaut einzujagen. Dieses Spiel hat es geschafft und schafft es immer wieder. Ich empfehle Euch auf jeden Fall einen Kopfhörer zu nutzen, dass macht das Sounderlebnis deutlich besser. Ein so banales Geräusch wie ein Mikrofonrauschen jagt mir in diesem Spiel immer wieder eine Gänshaut über den Körper. Das Mikrofon ist das wichtigste Utensil in diesem Spiel, denn damit nehmen wir die Botschaften aus dem Jenseits auf, die uns teilweise wichtige Tipps und Hinweise geben.
Die wichtigsten Hinweise geben uns sogenannte ""black orbs"". Sobald die in der Nähe auftauchen fängt das Rauschen an und wir müssen diese Orbs mit unserer Waffe abschiessen. Sind die Orbs erschossen, erhalten wir die Botschaften, die wir dann mit Hilfe unseres Recordes entschlüsseln können. Die Entschlüsselung ist keine grosse Herausforderung.
 
Was letztendlich Ziel des Spieles ist, ist am Anfang nicht eindeutig definiert. Es wird vermutlich darauf hinauslaufen, dass wir herausfinden müssen, was in dem seit 1971 abgesperrten Familienpark wirklich passiert ist. Angeblich ist ein Erdrutsch für die Sperrung verantwortlich....aber war es das wirklich?
 
Bisher macht das Spiel einen ordentlichen Eindruck.
Wenn ich es bewerten müsste (Grafik, Sound, Gameplay, Story):
7 von 10 Punkten",1433506479,1433506580,True,8,0,0.603563964366912842,0,False,False,False,False,,,
