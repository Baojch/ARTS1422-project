あれと同じか、むしろ劣化と言っていい。

スキルはメイン、サブ、パッシブのどれに装備するかで効果が違い、プレイ中、パッシブ以外はアイテム取得などでゲージを溜めて使うが、サブはメインに効果に足す感じ。

あとローカルcoopがあったり、ワークショップの人のボスとも戦える。

Pros:
Awesome Mech Game
Action packed
Easy to get into
Fun to get into without having to think too deeply

Con's
While the graphics serve their purposes some of the between mission graphics leave a bit to be desired. This seems to be some kind of artistic choice.

Should You Buy?: Are you a fan of series like Gundam and its descendants or Robotech? Are you a fan of twin stick shooters with random bosses? Do you enjoy action with a small bit of planning and customization? If you are answering yess to these buy it!

It is a simpler game though so you might want to wait for a small or deep sale. If purchased in a bundle often the cost of the bundle more than covers this game alone so it is worth it without question when found in a bundle.

Essentially the entire game is fighting bosses by destroying them part-by-part from the extremities inward, since only the outermost parts on a limb take any damage, with the scaling falling off such that hitting any part other than the two outermost is almost worthless.

So, it's all about slowly circling enemies, minimizing the amount of hits you take, and slowly wearing them down. Of course, with a system where you both regenerate health and destroy the boss's weapons as you fight, this means that essentially all stages get easier as they go on, which contributes to the tedious feeling. Likewise, there's not all that much difference between stages - some will have time limits, and some will have breaks for asteroid fields (which are to your advantage, since you regenerate health and super bar during this time), and as you go on you fight five different alien races, three of which have their own gimmicks, two of which matter - except for stages where you are attacking supply trains, which are similar (you still destroy armed parts coming off the train, from the outside in, then destroy the ""core"" that contains the supplies) but involve different enough mechanics that they at least feel like something different.

Startide is also not free of minor issues that I felt dragged the game down. The biggest one is that I felt the 4th alien race was the hardest to fight by far, which made the entire end of the game where you fought the 5th race feel very anticlimactic. Another is that, instead of getting notably harder (except when you fight the 4th race) or more interesting, stages just require you to fight more bosses in a row, which increases both the likelihood that you'll mess up and die sometime during them, and makes you have to replay even more when you die. The least and silliest gripe is that the game gave me a giant laser cannon with only one fight left before the rest of the game was fighting the 5th race, and due to how the mechanics interact, the giant laser cannon is useless against the 5th and final race of aliens.

Ultimately, I don't think I was expecting tedium from a shoot-'em-up. It's a genre with quite a few bad entries, but few boring ones, but Startide somehow managed to be. Check out Warning Forever instead, it's a significantly more fun freeware take on many of the same ideas.

(Postscript: Startide has a workshop functionality, but I felt it was somewhat limited in terms of being able to create interesting things due to fairly low ""cost"" limits, hopelessly degenerate designs like my Invincible are quite possible, and there's no real ship design community for the game. It's at least fairly easy to use, but I didn't think it was notable in any way.)",1508825394,1508917911,False,29,0,0.762212753295898438,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Startide é um jogo de ação de mechas que mistura a liberdade de movimento e combate de um twin-stick shooter com a jogabilidade de shoot'em ups de nave espacial.

Seu grande diferencial é o fato de não ter fases estruturadas, onde enfrentam-se vários inimigos fracos e um chefe no final. Ao invés disso, toda fase terá logo de cara um chefe, que pode ser seguido de outro, e outro.

Os combates em geral são rápidos, de início durando 30 segundos a 1 minuto, até onde pudemos cobrir no vídeo, e portanto as fases não são longas.

Há também algumas fases diferentes, que contam com naves menores para atrapalhar, ou objetivos principais diferentes, e servem bem para remover a monotonia de ser um jogo ""arena"" na maior parte do tempo.

O jogo traz também um editor de chefes, que permite ao jogador compor o corpo de um chefe, escolher e posicionar suas armas, e enfrentá-lo quando quiser, e ainda por cima compartilhar seu chefe com os demais jogadores, através de uma ótima integração com o Steam Workshop.

É possível jogar o modo História sozinho, para ver a história, liberar peças de chefe para o construtor, e também liberar habilidades e novos mechas para o jogador.

Cada mecha liberado possui stats diferentes, como também armas, e portanto a jogabilidade muda bem com cada robô, aumentando bem a rejogabilidade do título e deixando ele menos enjoativo.

Há ainda o modo Infinito, que possui suporte à cooperativo local para 2 jogadores, onde enfrenta-se chefe após chefe, com o objetivo de ter um desafio maior e ainda disputar no placar de pontuação com os demais jogadores.

Enfim, o jogo inova bem em seu formato, que por vezes parece muito raso, mas as fases rápidas podem ser uma boa alternativa para quem não é fã de carteirinha de jogos de nave com fases mais longas e cansativas.",1504982230,1505017533,True,8,0,0.603108346462249756,1,False,True,False,False,,,
