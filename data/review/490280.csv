This is not a boss rush game, this is an RPG.  The game gave me about 20 hours of gameplay, but I'm sure if you did all the side quests and a bit of crafting for your house you could get 30~ hours easily.  

My main gripe with the game is that on the open world you can dig as far deep as you want, but instead of finding rarer ore, more dangerous monsters, and new biomes, you find the same copy paste enemies with a chest.  You are region locked so no matter how much you explore the open tiles you will not find anything new until you progress.  

The gameplay loop of terraria was farm new ore, build new armor/weapons/tools, kill boss.  Repeat.

You could farm new ore on each region for upgrades but its painfully slow, and if you just find secret chests and kill bosses, you are rewarded with equal or sometimes BETTER gear than the region locked ore.  

Once I realized this I stopped crafting all together, this game is not a terraria clone at all.  The game rewards you with free crafting levels from scrolls that monsters drop, so randomly killing mobs is incentivised more than actually crafting items.  

You can skip entire acts of this game by grinding 10 pieces of a map in the open world, meaning you can skip literal hours of content in about 15 minutes of each new zone.  I skipped the snow region, and the main city region entirely.  

It's a bit sad that you can exploit like this but you are encouraged to do so.  I farmed Iron ore for about 2-3 hours in the Act 3 to gear myself up to steel armor/weapons, only to replace most of the gear in next 15 minutes of questing.

I think this game's fun factor really depends on what choices you make. It offers freedom of choosing what race and abilities you'd like to play, but I feel like some are just inherently more fun than others. 

For example, I played as a Goblin who just wanted to use a dagger (rogue type) and become a trader. However, there is no dual wielding and you are at a severe disadvantage in combat against other enemies. I imagine a necromancer or someone wielding a giant axe and not caring about farming is prob easier and as a result more fun. 

I really liked the profession system because I liked it in elder scrolls. However, dang is it slow...chopping a tree or mining is so slow. Also, digging in sand should not be the same as mining hard rock.

The game is [i]okay[/i], but it's not [i]great[/i].  Here's what I think after playing it through:
[h1]The plot is linear, short, and generic[/h1]
Don't expect great writing, and the characters won't really engage your interest - there's no depth to them, certainly nothing that affected the story outcomes.
[h1]The crafting is grindy and goes nowhere[/h1]
Tying character progression to levelling up skills is a novel approach, but the skills don't do anything much except for fuelling character levels.  The building and farming aspects of this game aren't interesting enough for me to want to play in the endgame after defeating the Big Bad Boss - like the writing, there just isn't the depth to keep my interest.  For example, there's no use for the starting materials after you reach the next tier of crafting - when you get to that stage, then it's just back off to gathering a new set of materials.  It might have been nice to have fewer blueprints to unlock, but being able to upgrade quality by using the new materials in crafting them...  But I digress.
[h1]There's not much to the landscapes[/h1]
Comparing RoM's terrains to Terraria's is unfair given the amount of dev-time and polish that have gone into Terraria's biome generation, but the majority of the map has no points of interest to make it worth exploring - unless you're gathering seeds or minerals.    There are extra hand-crafted dungeons to bash around in, but only a few.
[h1]No mods[/h1]
Mods would have given the game a [b]lot[/b] more legs - a quest-editor would let people create and share content to keep the game interesting after the storyline is over, even if a more complicated modding API were out of the question.
[h1]Lightweight, hassle-free combat[/h1]
I got this game to relax with after work, so I didn't need it to provide huge doses of adrenaline.  As long as you play intelligently, you can win without needing the reflexes of a cat.
[h1]Cool music, though[/h1]
RoM definitely harks back to Skyrim, and the music often sounded like a pastiche of Skyrim themes to me.  I liked it.
[h1]Overall[/h1]
You can have some fun with this game, but in my opinion the golden children of the genre are still Terraria and Starbound - and they're about the same price.  I'd definitely give RoM 2 a look if it came out, but you're likely to get more value for your money out of at least those two competitors.",1703248330,1703248330,False,9,0,0.624972403049468994,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Feels like starbound, the world is incredible big and lets you explore new areas and towns, however as far as I have come the underground biomes feels a little lackluster and repetitive.


Detailed and rich character creation, and each race have thier own pros and cons.
However I dont understand the purpose of the gnomes and that they only have negative traits. I get the idea that they are suppose to be a challenge to play. However i feels its more than enough to simply increase the difficulty, but thats just my own preference.


Cons

Having the ability to put your talent points into everything at some point. Some may see this as an upside I however dont like it, it destroys the RPG element and replayability to create new characters and build a personal connection to your character by having thier own speciality rather than being good at everything.

Ultimately, I fell for the Splattercat meme because he can make mediocre games come off a bit more appealing than they actually are. The game has awesome ambition and premise; I genuinely feel like this kind of terraria/starbound thing could be great in a more grandiose RPG-styled setting.

But at the end of the day, the combat is pretty meh and unrefined, half the skills are pretty nice but overall most of the skill trees feel a bit shallow and unfinished, weapon variety, enemy variety, fetch quests--just overall it feels like they ran out of time/money to spend on this and threw together what they could as a proof of concept. And it's a good concept, so I'm willing to buy the game and play through it to support them. It's fun enough for atleast a single playthrough IMO.

I'm not very far in yet (that's what she said), but up to this point I'm only able to mine one (1) (a singular) block at a time when digging, and it's legitimately giving me finger cramps.

This interesting beast proposes a blend between story and creation, in which the world is split into both handmade and procedurally-generated areas.  Refreshingly, the plotline neither sugar-coats not satirizes the fantasy-medieval genre, and this makes for interesting dramas that unfold along the way.

Mining and base building was almost unnecessary. And money is abundant. At most I spent it on vegetables and glass vials.

I think gameplay wise a comparison to Terraria is still closer, even closer to Starbound if you ask me. 

I haven't finished it yet and I don't think I will, but I still had fun playing it. 

 
My recommendation is if you are interested in it, play it for the first 1,5 hours. The gameplay pretty much does not change after this. The game is not truly open-world, it's tiered. 

All the resources will be simply replaced by higher-tier resources once you unlock the new tier.

Early game (first 20 hours) is sweet. Mid game is okay, and late game (After 35+ hours) is getting very boring. The resources get rarer and more difficult to obtain, and you are required to do even more grinding to upgrade your skills. 

At first I thought that Negative reviews here are simple complaints. But then I start to see how valid they are after 40 hours.

Pros:
-Nice level designs of Locations, each unique and interesting. 
-Nice Character Progression, from rag-clothes to a warrior in shining plates, gradual and satisfying upgrade. 
-Base Building
-Farming, Mining, Crafting
-Some quests are nice, funny. 
-Reactions of NPCs are well worked in early game (I find NPCs of late game towns are more bland). 

Cons:
-Simple fighting which using active skills is difficult and not satisfying. 
-Grind, grind, grind. It could be acceptable, if I am not required to wait very long time in front of screen waiting for some crafting jobs done. Each crafting takes at least 1-2 seconds as average and you are required to do 100-200 of them when you are trying to unlock next skill levels to unlock better items. Then the game starts to become boring.
-Many quests are obtaining item or collecting enough resources, which is boring.
-Finding gear/weapon items are almost never satisfying, when you find them, they are almost always in worse quality than your equipment. 
-Same underground maps for mining. 
-Enemies are just skinned versions of each other. Enemy types are few: Melee chaser, Ranged/Spellcaster, Brute (Cyclops, Minotaurs), that's it.

EDIT: After playing more I agree with the other reviewer who stated this feels like Morrowind in it's general vibe and especially the great orchestral sound track. Love the crafting and massive variety of crafting options. Alchemy is fundamental and potions give a massive boost to mining, crafting, and woodcutting. If you are struggling with mining (someone was complaining in another review about mining being too slow) bear that in mind. Also try to fully explore a biome/area before you travel to the next one you have unlocked. Each biome/area is an 'Act' in the game and every time you unlock a new one the difficulty scales and increases gradually, including the difficulty of mining rocks so prepare accordingly before moving onto the next area.

This isn't the kind of game where you funnel everything into one skill and expect to succeed. To progress your character invest in all your skills in order to level up and search for every last secret (don't forget to keep your torch equipped) for extra talent points. There are some odd typos and missed punctuation but there is a lot of brilliant descriptive and funny writing in this game so I don't agree with the person who was complaining about the English translation.

Yes there are some janky bits and oddities but learning to master attack swing patterns and positioning makes a big difference. For example when swinging a sword the 3rd swing is a stab that you should move back in your positioning to maximise its damage. I feel these elements of the game are intentional and skill based.

I held out on this game for the better part of a year but SO glad I finally picked it up on sale and am having a blast. If this looks like your kind of game but you are not sure, I would definitely recommend picking it up.

Yes it is clear to see inspiration taken from Terraria and Starbound but this game feels much more intimate and 'close-up' than those. It is slower paced and you can really take your time to enjoy building, crafting and exploring the world. Surprisingly, crafting systems feel a lot more like World of Warcraft's professions than those in Runescape. Which to me is great.

In terms of gameplay loop I find myself doing the following things:
Take every quest from the main town of a biome/area. Explore every nook and cranny of non-quest unique locations for secrets, and items. Scour a couple of randomly generated sandbox tiles. Then return to base armed with items and goodies to do some crafting and tick off quest objectives. Afterward I return to the town and complete quests and pick up any followup quests. Then I might settle down on my farming tile which is next to my homestead to pick and plant crops.

I give this game a solid 8 or 9 out of 10 for its ability to captivate and engage me.

Some wishes for the future:
Range weapons - bows/xbows/darts/throwing knives etc.
A combat Arena - face an ever increasing wave of deadly monsters and/or arena contenders for glory, cash or reward points
Water - Include water and the ability to swim in 4 dimensions, up down left right. Maybe add ocean or beach tiles where we can explore the seas and dive down into temples and wrecks.
Shapeshifting spells- Being able to become a shapeshifting druid who can transform into a bear or other wild creature
Increased villager options- hire peasants and other workers for your town/homestead and be able to tax them and set living conditions and have a community vault that when you pay into it, funds for living standards and other things are taken from it. (This is a big wish)
Increased diversity of randomly generated tiles and create more objects of interest in both the overworld and underground.

I could probably go on with improvements and wishes for the game and hope the developers continue with their current level of passion and love for their game. This is a real gem. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",1689454657,1689791944,True,5,0,0.557791829109191895,2,True,False,False,True,,,

1 Battle mechanics, not very rewarding in terms of play, 

2 Map layouts, both session and overall maps,   Session maps, generally will have where you are on a quest at a location, and you must get to some part of the map, in an open area you can build and change it how you need too, for quest areas this feature is limited to only, Special areas that you can dig, combine this with places you need to jump a special way, its is really a tired concept that takes away from the crafting , leveling up of your Character.

3. Overall map is locked till you complete quests and do tasks,  so if you want to play open world you will be stuck in tech since there are no animials, or plants in the first area that give you options , you can buy them but won't be able to find them in the wild.  Plus enemies you face will be at first area levels as well.  

Some bugs that have existed since early on and have been talked about are still in the game, this leads me to believe the developers simple do not play the game they make,

Enemy hitboxes are bonkers.  My sword more often than not completely overlaps the enemy sprite without a hit being detected.  It feels like the hitboxes are off to the side of the enemy, particularly when they are doing any kind of attack.  There's also zero impact or collision, so combat with more than two combatants is just everything in the same space flailing wildly.  Mining is adequate, but painfully slow until you've upgraded your pickaxe, which requires a lot of mining.  The ""zones"" are clones of each other with the same landscape and resources just one tier higher - tin becomes copper, jute becomes linen, etc.  It's basically palette-shifting the entire world, so after you've completed the first zone you've seen everything.

People will tell you about it, his wife is obviously afraid when you talk to her, and there's a quest that intersects with that.  However, you cannot interact with that piece of information at all.

Its a lot closer to something like Morrowind, but you can actually hit shit in this game, and the writing is only good enough, and not excellent, like Morrowind's.

The platforms are kinda wonky and standing on their edges wont count, and sometimes the game turns on the sneak mode and you move abysmally slowly. For a couple hours i didnt know that it turned it on by itself and i was frustrated by this. Look in the controls and turn it back on, it happens sometimes. Platforming can be wonky in this game because your character stops sprinting when your cursor is behind them, and running out of stamina mid jump will slow you down, and thats stupid, since its not you moving yourself at that point, but momentum itself.

Honestly, out of all the ARPG's i've played i enjoyed this the most. Torchlight II and Grim Dawn just didnt grab me, probably because the isometric perspective feels so disconnected from the action, unlike this game. I wish this game had New Game +

there are many things i'd like to talk about the game but the number 1 thing in the game in my opinion is how good ALCHEMY is compared to many games...which i will compare to Fallout 4's drugs ( temporary buffs )

the ALCHEMY cost little and is quite effective...it's cheap, no ultra rare item you have to test your luck to find even once in your playthrough and the effect is both strong and durable......STRONG EFFECT AND DURABLE......not just some 10-20% buff over something for 30 seconds...i'm talking about 50% buffs for 15 minutes......all you need is a vial with water, a common plant or 2, a common monster drop that can be bought for cheap...and presto! you can deforest an area 50% faster or speed up mining by 50% for 15 minutes aswell!.....how could anyone skip on that????....even the basic potions are worth using...healing 30%+ of your hp over a few seconds, refill your mana at a decent rate to spam the hell out of your magic and refill your stamina for unlimited sprint ( can be paired with the speed potion for speedrunning enthusiast )


if we compare the  ""temporary buffs""  with Fallout 4...Fallout's drugs gives tiny to small bonuses to your attributes or give a tactical advantage and only last 10-60 sec...and they are not common to find...and they're not cheap........wtf.....would you rather get a 50% bonus to your mining or wood chopping for 15 minutes with a tiny cost of common items easy to acquire or spend an hour scavenging for drugs or ""waiting"" 48 hours to restock vendors just so you can have a small benefit over something for 10-60 sec?





HEY DEV(S) JUST FOR THAT ALONE...JUST FOR MAKING AN OFTEN TERRIBLE ASPECT OF A GAME ACTUALLY USEFUL FOR ANYONE...YOU GOT MY PRAISE!







since i've stated out the best thing in the game ( compared to many other games' way for alchemy )...let's talk about the bad sides


the buy and sell prices when you start are atrociously bad...but thank god leveling up the trading skill makes prices go in your favor for income and price tags

the enemies are kinda basic and stupid...it is mostly fine how it is for the genre....but enemies should hide when they're getting shot at by magic spells ( ice bolt and fire ball for example )...they might just stand above you or under you unable to hit you and just stand there like idiots taking shots in the face....at least the humanoids enemies should be smart enough to hide from projectiles if they're unable to hit back ( possible hit detection according to the player's location and where they can move )

there are some common bugs that fix themselves shortly after they happend ( unable to place block, attibute point not detected, etc. )...not game breaking but they may happend once per hour

the human race is pretty much the best race in my opinion...having bonuses in pretty much everything...that's why i picked a high elf, to not have too much hp and stamina so i feel more the need to invest in magic stuffs

and spekaing of races...most races are not really worth picking since they lack advantages over the human race...i picked a 10% dmg bonus and double magic resistance over higher health and much higher stamina as starting stats ( starting with 40 stamina sucks, trust me )

THE BIGGEST FLAW tho is the lack of option to Romance the village idiot in the starting village...at least give us the option to give him a little smooch on the cheek...after wiping out the dirt off it...or not, if you're a weirdo

Being 20 dollars, this is a MUST buy, and if ever on sale a HAVE TO buy, i bought this game seeing it was much like terraria, and i certainly enjoy terraria it seems to be pretty cookie cutter start to finish. however, realms, on the other hand has many great qualities that exceed expectations, and personally terraria. Cons were very hard to come up with and i was really happy about a lot of the features and mechanics in game. 

Note: i am a melee build and havent used anything else such as magic, so i have no insight on the topic so far.

Pros:
-you can farm all sorts of things just like minecraft.
-lot of races to pick with unique background lore and bonuses and deficits that are specific to the race.
-love the graphics, looks like a classic game of the style would look like.
-the feel of the game is pretty smooth, and while not perfect, i have no complaints about navigation, movement, or combat.
-i can see the list of craftables in the crafting station menu and theres at least a dozen tiers of gears for weapons, armor, and tools, quite extensive.
-with only 5 hours on the books i can see this easily being in the double to triple digits for anyone whose a fan of the style.
-very RPG oriented. as terraria is the only similar game i can compare to this game definitely has lore, from races in character creation, to story, to books and notes found in game. 
-classic fantasy sword and sorcery. not to my knowledge or what ive played so far is there an guns or unicorn wands or things of the nature, very classic style weapons, which i enjoy over, over-the-top weapons and items.
-you switch between like a creation mode, where you can destroy/place blocks, mine, place chests/crafting stations and a combat mode where you have access to a primary weapon, shield and skills/abilities. this double bar system just allows for more compared to terraria/minecraft.
-crafting is very nice, with about 6-8 different crafting stations that you can work with, food, tailor, smelting, smithing, alchemy, etc. all having their own experience gain and levels to work towards.
-between the tutorial and the starting missions game gives a very nice grasp at how to get started
-quite a few skill trees that unlock some nice things.

Cons: 
-only able to hit one mob at a time so far, which makes group fights kind of clunky, but with dodging and jumping certainly can help.
-skill tree diversity, you will more than likely need 2-3 trees to progress at a time to avoid constant surplus of points, as you will gain talent points from scrolls as well as levels so they can add up and if you only intend on using 1-2 trees, your going to be sitting on a handful of points until next milestone (every 5 levels).
-Unique equipment doesnt really have anything special about them, just seemingly more damage, which makes the unique name weapons somewhat lackluster
- combat can be stale as weapons of a type only really have 1 combo your constantly using, however more variety in the single combo than terraria/minecraft.
-one area for sure i couldnt get back up. it was in a map i couldnt alter so i had to travel out and back to get from where i was. not a huge deal, just minor inconvenience.
-only including this for those that prefer a very open ended and free roam experience, that areas are dependent on quests. (Areas have dozens of sandbox areas and about half a dozen named areas) 
-sometimes dialogue isnt perfect for grammar.
-although i have not, and i am sure you can, autosave can hit at very poor times, like in the middle of combat or trying to do something.

Conclusion:

At the end of the day, if you like old school side scrollers, games like terraria and minecraft with a nice sandbox style, but crave a more RPG experience, this is definitely for you. i am a big fan of both of those listed games and while fun, can get boring as there isnt anything to really pay attention to other than your own self made goals i.e. base building, gear, bosses, etc. the cons list is all trivial stuff and minor inconveniences at best as with 5 hours under my belt i really dont see anything wrong with the game, zero bugs so far, no glitches, no crashes, and runs fine. very well put together, well executed, definitely real time and effort has been put into this game and it really shows, unlike a lot of games that dont really deliver nowadays, this one certainly does. i enjoy clearing every zone, and getting my crafting skills to max, so i can easily see myself in the triple digits EASY on this game.",1683302861,1683303652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

empiezo por lo malo:
-el combate: bastante pobre y en el nivel mas facil es ridiculo, no te presenta ningun reto... las espadas no se diferencian en nada mas que el daño que hacen, todas se mueven igual y no aporta nada interesante al combate... el swing de el arma cuerpo a cuerpo solo afecta al primer enemigo que se cruza, es decir, si hay un grupo de enemigos el sablazo de tu espada solo afecta al primero que toca, y no a todos los enemigos, se hace muy tedioso si queres matar grupos de mobs
-el autosaving no se puede desactivar, podes ponerlo con una diferencia de mucho tiempo pero es muy molesto estar jugando y que de la nada se congele el juego porque esta autoguardando la partida
-la papelera es una porqueria: la papelera es basicamente lo mismo que tirar los objetos al lado tuyo, no cumple ninguna funcion... no se deshace de los items, los deja a un lado y si al tiempo pasaste por al lado el item sigue estando ahi... encima hay items que no se pueden ni vender, si no los queres no podes reciclarlos, no te queda otra que dejarlos en alguna parte del mapa a la que no te interese ir mas o dejarlo en un cofre propio abandonado
-el orden automatico del inventario te ordena todo sin tener en cuenta las mochilas, si queres ordenar automaticamente una mochila en especifica no se puede, te ordena todo el inventario repartiendolo en todas las mochilas, si tenias items ordenados por comida (por ej) te los va a poner en cualquier mochila dependiendo de que otros items haya antes
-el sprint: mal hecho, para esprintar el cursor del mouse tiene que estar mirando a la direccion a la que se esta esprintando, es muy facil ir esprintando y sin querer mover el cursor hacia el otro costado, automaticamente se deja de esprintar
-no se puede deshacer una mision: si aceptaste una mision secundaria y queres abandonarla, mucha suerte! vas a tenerla en el journal por el resto del juego, no se puede abandonar ninguna mision

lo bueno:
-la historia esta buena, te atrapa y los guiones son excelentes, muy ocurrentes
-variedad de armaduras, clases y armas

The combat in particular - there's no impact. And no real threat, either. I actually think the game would've been [i]better[/i] if they got rid of the combat altogether.

There's a nice mixture of unchangeable, hand-crafted areas (villages, dungeons) and unlocked sandbox areas where you can just build whatever you want, plant crops, place crafting stations etc. I found building to be rather grindy, though - I needed a lot of materials to get what I wanted, and getting them was not the fun kind of grind. Many different options as to what to build and which materials to use; and they only expand as you increase your trade skills.

The locked areas actually felt like videogame levels with secrets, and that's great. I'd say it's the best part of the game: exploration of even a small pit with rats felt fun. Or rather it would've been fun if the combat had any weight to it.

Everything else - the dialogue, the quests, the world... there's clearly some effort here. But, how to say this... it felt like reading a badly written novel? You can tell that someone put their heart and soul into this but the result is just boring, and it... hurts, you know?

The game lacks this magic. This vision. Nothing seems to fit together. And it doesn't look like the game has any real design philosophy, so it probably never will.

The combat. Is. Atrociously bad. Like worse than any 8 or 16 bit game ever made. And it's made worse by the skills in the game. There are literally skills that are ""100% extra damage with weapon type X"". Which makes ZERO sense as you basically have to pick a SINGLE weapon type and just roll with it for the whole game. So 90% of weapons you pick up are useless. They also take too much stamina if you don't have the tree specced. It's just horribly thought out from A to Z.

And the actual animations on the weapons are fucking painful. No way to attack up or down or at any angle. Enemy attacks ALL see to me charge at you in melee and many of them instantly turn around when they pass through you and hit you in the back. It's honestly just an exercise in frustration.

HARD PASS on the combat alone.

Something like terraria, but much less freedom, much less variety and much more story and more rpg. You do quests, grind, craft, you can build too (well, you would need resources, which are boring pain to grind, so for me - no desire to build at all), although you can not terraform cities, but only free areas on map

Cons:
1) Grind, grind, grind. Boring, endless, senseless grind. Well, you would grind in terratia too, but here it is much more senseless, grindy and boring.
2) Unballanced skills - summons on higher difficulty are completely useless compared to melee, didn't want to try anything else
3) Very limited enemy variety that gets repetitive very quickly
4) Clunky combat overall
5) When you enter a village - you do it always from the left side of the map. If you want to visit someone on the right edge of the city map - you go there all the way every time, which is not short, and you do it often due to the game is heavy on quests.

Pros:
1) Crafting system is nice but doesn't fall too smoothly over the core of gameplay
2) Some amount of not-so-bad humor",1679434317,1679434317,False,6,0,0.535946428775787354,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Edit: Yeah... I'm kinda getting sick and tired of the leveling system. The grind is tedious for certain skills but quick and easy for others so the scaling or level of tedium for gaining exp for certain skills is really really, and I mean a giant pain.
Like I went from level 1 husbandry to level 48 in half an hour. But my crafting skill is still too low to complete certain quests which I find strange given how much more considerable time I have spent crafting things to build a giant base with. And that's a second thing. The grind. 
You have to spend so much time in the sandbox element to gather resources and loot chests and fight enemies to level up all of the necessary skills to advance. And that's ignoring the main leveling system regarding your character's level. This exp bar is the slowest of them all. I'm only level 15 and it's been almost a day of playing this game. How realistically am I expected to reach level 25 let alone anything past that with how petty the rewards for quests are? That's also ignoring there's no basic ranged weapons. 
You have to level up abilities to get anything canon fodder or range related. No bow? Spent ages trying to figure out how to craft one. Can't. I can't get anywhere in the third zone because of how slow the pvp is. Dodging and weaving in this game is really boring. Like REALLY boring. I spent all my skill points from player leveling up on using less stamina on running and dodge rolling. I have nothing in actual abilities because if I didn't have them fights would go on longer as I would have to run away and hide to get my stamina back. 

The difficulty curve doesn't make all that much sense. It seems like certain enemies are just op for no reason other than that they can. While it seems like anything around that enemy is just swiss cheese. This game plays very similar to Starbound because I used an RPG mod to have specialized classes and a leveling system. But at least with that, anything you did contributed to your player level instead of just the specific skill stat. Maybe this game does that too and it was too little to actually do much. The only exp I really seem to get are from fights, looting chests, or quests. The quests are kind of dogsh*t too. Not because they're boring or anything. It's that they have prerequisites. Especially the ones in the third zone because the game expects you to be a certain level in your skills to complete quests which frankly doesn't make much sense. 
You can't craft items being asked of you, and either have to buy them from merchants selling them from previous zones, or grind leveling for it. There's no good way of grinding your grinding skill to unlock flour recipe or unlock corn. You can't get corn in this zone or any previous zone so it mystifies me that there would be a quest that required it. You can buy the cornmeal which is what you need, but still. 
The money grind isn't as tedious as other games because you just gradually accumulate wealth and can sell junk for quick cash. But I find myself spending quite a bit of it on basic items because of them being tedious to craft or harvest, and wanting to craft the raw resources into items I'll actually use. I mean I get that's the appeal of MMO's or whatever but like this game is designed to have multiple playthroughs. How the hell is that ever going to happen if I'm stuck on one character that can't get past level 15? 


Edit 2: I'll thank you to not convolute basic game mechanics or better yet not account for reactions people will have to certain dialogue results. Why would you have like ""Oh the humanity."" or ""I'm just a small little goblin please do not kill me!"" when not killing certain individuals will actually prevent you from completing the game or getting rewards like exp or gold? Like you can't even go back on certain actions. 

Game has no wiki so there's no way of knowing before hand. So the fact you peacefully resolved the issues between the elves and the humans of whatever the name of the second area is means you've essentially made it mandatory to play the game from start to finish a second time to actually complete the game, 100% which the game really wants you to do. 

So why it would f*ck you over and make that impossible is beyond me. Like you can't kill what are certainly individuals you will be tasked to kill later on, ahead of time, and instead have to figure out who you need to talk to, so you can do the thing you already knew you were eventually going to do.

I can't stand it. 

You can have items needed to complete quests ahead of time but the fucking tedium of stalling the inevitable is such a pain in the ass. I don't know why you'd have things that are straight forward and just convoluted something that should be just as simple. It's not fun. It's annoying. Keep it simple.

However, I personally would not recommend this game.  It has some good qualities but there are many aspects of the game that I did not find enjoyable.  My biggest issue is that the character and gear progression did not feel very good.  The only difference between tiers of weapons is simply the damage.  This made weapon progression not very exciting, basically, I would get to a new zone, enemies would have more hp, and as a result I'd need a new weapon with more damage to compensate.  Since the only difference is more damage and enemies now had more health essentially nothing had changed.  Also I feel like there was a huge missed opportunity with the uniquely named weapons in this game.  You can find these weapons with unique names in the world, however they behave exactly like every other weapon, I think giving these unique effects or extra stats would have greatly improved the variety of weapons.

Character progression in regards to talents also felt sort of lackluster.  While the talents were usually impactful, many of the times my levels ups offered nothing of use.  This is due to the fact that talents in a tree are typically 5 levels apart.  This led to me unlocking a new talent in my mace weapon tree, putting a point there, and then waiting another 5 levels to unlock the next talent.  There were a few talents in the combat tree that were nice, and the frost barrier was great, but I saw no appeal in putting points into other trees as they did not support my build.

The art is ... um. Low-budget indie. It is of course basically Terraria / Minecraft under the hood. And on a keyboard + mouse, it can be a little tricky since side-scroller platformers for me are just kind of anchored to a hand-held controller.

And then I kept playing. And every time I went into one of the pre-built maps to explore or do a quest or something, I kept encountering some interesting little platformer obstacle course to navigate or discovered a secret hidden chest or was surprised by an uber mob I'd never seen before. And although the English localization is absolutely swamped with spelling errors and awkward phrasing, I found the dialogues and plot to be, well, charmingly sincere and executed with the distinct style of a well-worn song that is performed perfectly, without wonky gimmicks or kitschy in-jokes. Movement and combat are precise and responsive which is pretty important for this type of game. Base building and supply management is satisfying without being horribly grindy (though, let's be real, a *leeeettle bit* of grind is why we play this genre anyway). And although the sprites are... primitive... the variety of fashion options for personal customization is larger than I expected.

My main complaint is that the variety of active skills available is extremely small. You'll be using the same spell or type of weapon for basically 90% of the game from the tutorial on. And almost all of the talents just give you minor passive scaling to keep up with the hit points of enemy creatures as you go. Which is painfully boring and a waste of the game's potential as a platform adventurer. There are also some pretty glaring balance problems which can saddle you with a burning resentment after you realize that you can't respec your character for a long time yet but getting more points is going to take forever and all the points you've spent so far don't really matter because your summoned rats and wolves do pathetic damage and die instantly, even after wasting all your gear to pump them. Meanwhile even the weak ice bolt is doing twenty times the damage with one shot and you haven't even got any gear equipped for it and hardly any points spent in that tree. And your ice bolt goes where you tell it to instead of sitting around next to enemies, unresponsive.

The developer is (slowly) continuing to work on it. It's got all the potential of Terraria but has a far more narrative / RPG architecture with some absolutely fantastic level design. Hopefully they address the combat powers / talents to make them more interesting and varied soon.

What I really like:
It's a good use of 2D Terraria environments with a map mechanic to expand playable area. Skills are varied like a true RPG - milling, leatherworking, cooking, etc - and when you level each up through use, it has that Skyrim-esque satisfying drum fill. Graphics strike a nice balance between simple enough to animate on a grid and detailed enough to be pretty. I like how it's clearly both an RPG and a Open World Craft. The mechanics are smooth as butter. It's very clever - like your character has a slot for water and food, so you're not bothering to feed them every 5 minutes. And inventory is copious and bountiful - you have up to 5 additional bags, so there's no lack of space. It's so annoying when you play a craft open world game with thousands of types of things, and a backpack with 24 slots - this game does not have that issue at all.

Oh, and the music is solid. Props to the folks that pulled that together, it's quite good.

What could use some love:
In the third or fourth town, dialogue starts breaking down a little. It feels a little low effort there, some characters are just saying ""I hate this place."" It's a stretch from the first wizard you encounter that expounds on basics of gameplay. Some of the character visual face combos just look cartoonish, even for a game that isn't aiming for full realism. You can allow villagers to follow you to your camp, but they lack any personality - they're more like objects you collect and place in your camp. Once placed, they stand still like mannequins awaiting replacement. The game has a good variety of objects, but they seem to lack any animation, and as a result feel less alive. Sure you can create and place an outhouse, but it's effectively a static painting.

Overall it has a lot of promise, and I'll likely continue to play it through max level, but I'm not sure if I'll return much after that.",1673528018,1673896381,True,1,0,0.511421322822570801,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Something I enjoy greatly.

No new major mechanics or other interesting differences.
Especially the terrain generation, the terrain always looks the same.
I still don't know what is the difference between the plains and the forests in this game, they look basically the same, and you can find the same things in them.

Gameplay mostly consist of resource gathering, crafting, which is quite grind heavy, and questing.
The quest are either fetch quests, or kill everyone in a dungeon types.
But at least there is a story line to follow.

In regards to bugs, most of them ware only minor annoyances at first.
But there were a few cases of some game locations slowing down permanently and controls becoming unresponsive.
No reloading or restarting the game resolved it, and I had to mark the area not to visit again.
And finally, after investing 39 hours into the game, grinding out skills, completing all quests, finding all secrets, etc., my save files got deleted and I can not even attempt to load them from the load menu.

It is heartbreaking to say, but I do not recommend this game.
While it does provide a relaxing, and casual experience; the gameplay is way is too monotone, and drawn out.

You ever play a game and your first thought was, ""oh no, this is so jank"". Those were my first thoughts and it immediately turned me off from this game. The UI is jank, the text is difficult to read, why are the controls so weird, I can't customise the zoom level, this game is a full release and first impressions were not good. Let's push on, give this game a chance.

Oh, I levelled up a profession. That's cool. I like games that reward me for doing meaningful things. And that's how the game got me. It's discovering the next tier of progression and that ""fulfilment"". And that's all the game has.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Here are the problems I've discovered after 30 hours[/h1]

- Combat is unfulfilling, the AI is not there. Enemies run straight for you, they can't navigate simple terrain. They've been programmed with some dodge mechanic but they use it frantically. Enemies don't group up or surround you. Bonus: If you've played Terraria, you already know how to cheese enemies.
- Some skill trees are more potent than others. [spoiler] Playing as a pure ice mage, you can straight up murder everything at range. The ice debuffs make the enemies a joke.[/spoiler]
- Every tileset you visit is just the same. It slopes up and down, there are some enemies, vegetation, domestic animals to tame, NPCs looking for a nice place to live. There are no caverns, nothing to incite exploring. Just dig straight down hope for the best. Walk right, clear the enemies, call it a day and go to another tileset.
- Speaking of those NPCs looking for a place to live, it's either a missing feature and planned for the future. It's in the game but when you take them back to your base, nothing happens. You can recruit farmers, lumberjacks, alchemists and so on but they just stand still. This was the biggest trip for me.
- Base building. Sure, you can have it. But there's not much to it. You land at a tileset that you like? They're all the same. You're just better off building efficiently and not decoratively.
- You can come across ""hostile"" or faction NPCs that don't like your presence for trespassing. I came across a group of smugglers, couldn't trade with them, I just looted everything not nailed down and left. No aggression towards me.

Those are some of the negatives and I'm sure I'll encounter more. The negatives just compound as you play the game more.

This game is not bad. However, I have some thoughts I want to share with whoever reads this.
First of all, the setting, I love it, I am a big fan of fantasy worlds so that's cool. There is a problem though. The game is called realms of magic, but the magic is... meh. There is nothing wrong with it, but idk, after reading the name I expected more interesting spells, maybe with. 
I also really expected quite a bit more of possibilities for roleplay, mainly due to this sentence on the game page 'Explore the open world of the Old Kingdom as a knight or a wizard. Or build a house, plant fruits, invest in livestock… become a farmer… that also sounds nice!' which made me thought the story wouldn't be so thrown down your face, but unfortunately to explore the full map you are forced to do specific quests, which is a bit annoying imo. 
Also, while a talent tree is usually cool, I personally prefer to have some kind of 'teacher' or something to make it have a bit more of sense, though that might just be me.
Lastly, the races. While the one being developed promises for very big changes on how the game is played, the current ones are just a stat change and nothing else. No one gives a shit about your race, or at least no one I found so far so my original thoughts of potentially replaying the game as a different race slowly dwindled until they pretty much died.

The game can't even get the basic menu mechanics right.

I thought perhaps this was due to mouse/keyboard settings (although I have nothing special set up other than LED's), so I swapped to another keyboard and also tried a controller to no avail. This is when I realized that there is no native controller support.

i bought this game because of another positive review here that compared it to Skyrim. Of course, it should be judged on its own merits, so for that respect, it's got influence from the likes of Dark Souls and Starbound.

The fact there are quests surrounding your doings and the happenings therein is a boon to those seeking a good dopamine mine. People love to whine online about having to ""fetch"" items for NPCs and - would you believe it? - having to travel outward and KILL a certain amount of things or people, and return with news of it. It's almost as if they're actually growing out of the gamer hobby, and are better suited to casual time wasting? Because last I heard from the realm of REALITY, being tasked with venturing beyond my safe zone to hunter-gather while slaying offending parties sounded like the AWESOME life I've never lived in such olden times as to have grown up alongside.

The, quote, ""medieval genre"" has it made in spades. If you know what to expect in Skyrim - learning by doing, managing your red (health), green (stamina), and blue (magic) bars, gathering supplies for noteworthy needs, crafting, adopting various character builds, interacting with people in order to advance quests big and small, and gain loot, finding secrets (yes, Skyrim had a ""find the secret"" system. It's that ""relieving music"" you hear every time you enter a dungeon room with a nice amount of treasure containers and loose loot strewn about that was conveniently tucked away), exacting dominance upon enemies, and the like, then you'll feel right at home with Realms of Magic. You can expect to walk around gathering wood, food, clothes, armors, weapons, metals, miscellaneous objects, and doing other things. It's doesn't have a 3rd-person perspective, but it's currently achieving exemplary standards through its 2D landscapes.

I don't know enough about the game in-depth for not having played extensively enough, but I can assure you, if you're of the DnD, Skyrim, Dark Souls, Elden Ring, Dragon's Dogma, camp who vividly remembers a childhood of playing in the mud, running through the trees, getting into trouble, and bathing only to get back outdoors and have that innocent childlike fun all over again (as is the case with most fans of wanton medieval fare), then Realms of Magic is for you. Buy it. Sans the lack of controller support currently, it's worth getting used to its control scheme, or mapping the control layout to  a controller if that's your thing just to experience this still-in-development diamond in the rough.

Did I mention that it has good writing? ❤️",1669318503,1669318503,True,11,2,0.557098507881164551,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Realms of Magic is a misleading name, because there's not much that's very wondrous about this game's tone. It's more medieval than fantasy, and it has a really kind of gross tone.

Comparisons to Starbound have been made, and that's one of the things that initially made me want to play this, but it's not nearly as interactive. It's also not as robust, and there's not a whole lot of interactivity or destructability. It's comparable to Starbound in only the sense that the boss levels in that are also not very interactive or destructible, but in Starbound, you can do more with those levels and you're more likely to find some item to put in your ship or base.

Controls aren't super tight, and there's no real controller support, which is a shame since the keyboard and mouse don't do a great job. Combat is a chore, and it's not really as free an experience as the listing seems to claim. You are going to be fighting monsters, adventuring, and having basically no agency in your role-playing experience. Because there's not a sense of openness or ability to wander, again compared to something like Starbound, there's no real sense of just leaving the story for a while and doing your own thing. And the story is really awful, not even slightly fun. If you enjoy the garbage fire writing of the Dragon Age series, you might be somewhat amused.

There isn't that much customization for your character, so if you were looking for that, you're going to be disappointed. The pixel art style is fine, but it doesn't really excel here at being charming or quaint. That's in part because of the tone it sets, but it just isn't anything special to me.

Some Pro's,
- Levelling system is fun. Farming, Mining, bartering, etc all adds to your characters overall level, so everything feels worth doing.

- I enjoyed the game play loop. Go out, explore, complete quests, gather supplies then come back to base, craft stuff, level up, build up your base, repeat. It was simple but I lost many hours to it. though with this game trying to be open ended, other's may have different experiences.

- well paced early game progression, it was somewhat slow, but as you built yourself up, got better gear, and levelled your skills allowing you to handle enemies a little easier, chop trees and mine faster and so on did feel good.
 
Some con's
- Some mechanics just didn't work. Weapons like daggers and spears have -30% and 10% mana cost but this never worked, I tried a few experiments and never obtained the benefits, potions with the same effects also didn't work. But if gear specified the mana type (frost, Fire, nature, Necromancy) then the mana cost reduction on them would apply, but it seemed there was a Lowest cost cap.

- boring secret loot mid-late game. All the marked map area's had secret chests to find, each zone had special armor, weapons, tool upgrades and skill experience scrolls which were neat but in the mid to late game the tools always seemed worst than the set you had, and the supplies offered were worthless, like I remember a couple secret chests just having sticks. This made finding all the chests feel not worth it.

 - Quests could sometimes be done out of order, on more than one occasion I'd talked to a person and complete what they asked only to complete another persons quest who directs me to the quests I completed for the first guy.

A couple more thing to note, this game is fairly easy, I only died twice in this game, both were to kamikaze sheep, the first death came out of the blue and caught me off guard since no other enemy did this, the second death was me experimenting with how it worked.
Building felt uninspired, you had plenty of blocks which was nice but not all decorations could be placed on tables and the decorations didn't offer a lot to begin with.
NPC's/ village management also felt unpolished. On your travels you could come across villagers looking for a place to live, they basically acted as shops but had no personality or needs.

8 to 9/10 if you know what to do and get along with the interface and everything

If you gonna go completionist be a goblin or a dwarf for faster progress on some of the harder achievements and other stuff

If not depend on what kind of playstyle you are choosing if you are going melee goblin, human and high elf are good, if you are going magic caster i m not so sure i didnt tried yet but its preety clear from the start when you choose your character

There are at least 5 secrets on the tutorial and you cant come back after ending it, one is on a body that appear below a block if you mine it.

Do husbandry from start and make a good farm early on, also you need to craft and place trellis over fertile ground to plant some things.
Also to to get at least 3 or 4 of each category vendor to your main base that help a lot for faster progression.

I would add to the game replayability for the last boss (partly solved if you save the game before that fight)

Also try to evade having many saves and lots of autosave and quicksave slots, i ended having 1,83 gb on saves at one point and i deleted most of them and reduced the max amount of those in options menu. (i think they go like 20 to 40mb each)

- Compelling exploration: both handcrafted locations and sandbox areas feature plenty of secrets to discover, different loot types and a diverse enemy roster in each region.

- Great amount of secondary quests that are worth doing in terms of rewards, lore and story. Some of them have multiple choices that may unlock other quests later.

- Solid variety of possible builds, supported by a large number of different weapons and gear. Respec is possible (for a price) if you want to try other builds.

- The art style is pleasant, consistent, and has a high amount of detail in each location.
[/td]
[td]
- Mid to late game balance issues. Even on Hard difficulty, you’ll be too powerful most of the time with equipment congruent to your build.

- The sandbox features are useful just for a handful of secondary quests. Generally they can be ignored as you’ll loot, buy and find all you need regardless.

- Navigation and questing in larger cities prove annoying due to the absence of a local map and many areas or characters looking similar.

- Most bosses and ‘powerful enemies’ don’t feel much different from regular foes except for higher HP and damage. Exception made for the final boss.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Premise, Setting & Writing[/h3]
The Old Kingdom is your run of the mill medieval-era setting, with the addition of high fantasy elements like magic and other races like Orcs, Elves etc. Misery is the norm for most, death all too common, and even darker times are ahead due to war and the resurgence of old magic previously sealed for centuries. Legends foretell the coming of a great hero that will turn the tide of events, thus saving the reign - that indeed would be you.

Overall, the setting well-represents the grim quotidianity of the common folk in such times, and the stark contrasts between the various social classes in a kingdom that is still recovering from previous conflicts, and whose elite is selfish, unscrupulous. Each city, fort, outpost and dungeon is handcrafted with solid attention to detail, always in a style that reflects the region it’s located in, or the social status of its inhabitants. While the graphics may not be much modern, RoM makes up for them with detailed worldbuilding.

There’s an above-average amount of lore and dialogues for an ARPG: other than quest-related ones, those interested may peruse a great amount of books and documents, other than asking NPCs about plenty of topics. All of this is written competently, with a few dialogues that I found particularly clever or amusing, as well. The main story itself is nothing special and feels somewhat rushed in later chapters, but for this genre is more than passable.

[h3]Exploration, Looting & Secrets[/h3]
RoM’s world is divided into tiles each housing a city, dungeon, or plain wilderness. While pre-made locations are ‘protected’ thus immune to your tools and blocks, sandbox areas can be built upon and modified freely. Many areas and whole regions will initially be locked, becoming available only when you either progress the main story enough, or find ten map fragments of that specific region (very hard to come by) - quest-related locations will still be locked in a region unlocked this way, though.

Locally, levels lack a map and always house a number of secrets in the form of shiny containers often placed behind destructible barriers or in particularly obscure locations. These will prove vital to your progression as they often contain powerful gear and other rare items. Generally you’ll be able to freely loot any container, even inside houses, as ‘stealing’ isn’t accounted for - just don’t expect to find great stuff in non-combat areas. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863055627

[h3]Combat & Progression[/h3]
Fights play out in real time, in an ARPG fashion where stats given by passive abilities, equipped gear and stacked buffs will be pivotal to your success. For this purpose RoM has several ability trees to pick, ranging from four schools of magic to specializations in diverse melee weapon categories, each with their unique active and passive perks and freely multi-classable. Respec is available for a relatively high price, but if you screw up your build it will be there (if you find the right NPC, that is).

Enemies are varied and have a wide range of skills, damage types and attack patterns that will surprise you more than a few times. Sure, some are ‘reskins’ of weaker ones, but always have some additional quirk - it’s a shame ‘powerful enemies’ (mini-bosses) don’t further expand this variety. The combat system expands with passives such as dodge-rolls, magic barriers and more which further the tactical possibilities and flexibility - you won’t need to strategize much though, especially later when most builds inevitably become OP.

[h3]Quests & Dialogues[/h3]
Some NPCs will give you quests of various nature from assassination, investigating an event, to taking to someone and so on. There’s no indication of quest-givers, so talking with everyone is the only way to be sure. Most quests are linear, and will have only one outcome, although a few have different choices that may or may not influence the story ahead (but never in a major way). The dialogue system is nothing elaborate and has no roleplay elements: while some NPCs will react differently based on your race, the options and responses will be the same. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2861885746

[h3]Crafting, Base Building & Farming[/h3]
Sandbox areas will allow building a custom base that can eventually contain farms, animal pens, NPCs that trade for you and also act as Trainers, increasing your profession levels for a high fee. The various jobs level up either that way or by crafting things related to them, for instance Cooking is leveled by crafting food. While on paper this is a nice system, it’s ultimately a marginal feature for the simple fact you’ll find most of what you need by looting enemies, normal containers or trading with merchants, since you’ll soon accumulate vast amounts of money. The farming mechanics are basic, with plants growing without need for care and animals producing goods over time if fed.",1663425880,1664856615,True,178,1,0.915516674518585205,11,True,False,False,True,,,

TLDR: This is a cozy game that does not challenge or frustrate significantly. It's ideal if you want to explore pretty handcrafted 2d environments looking for secrets, and enjoy leveling up and seeing the next tier of goodies you can craft.

Pros:
This game is ideal for someone who enjoyed Oblivion or Skyrim playing on easy difficulty and enjoys the little hit of dopamine that every level up and progression provides, or someone who plays an MMO casually and is thrilled by reaching a new tier of equipment.
I've spent a lot of hours on Realms of Magic and for the most part I enjoyed them. I found the game to be ""cozy."" I didn't feel challenged at any point, except challenged to put just a little more time in and grind a few more skill levels before putting it down for the night. 
Overall, this game was able to capture my attention in ways that some other similar 2d titles simply couldn't. In other games for instance, there was never any incentive not to simply tear down NPC areas and use the materials to your own ends. This never feels good to me, It feels cheap and low, but it also feels irrelevant since many games like this generate these structures anyway. Instead, quest areas are protected in this game and look really nice. Additionally, dungeons and other locations are hand-made with secrets lovingly placed, so every single area in the game feels both fun and rewarding to explore. There are guides available to get all the secrets, but once I got a feel for how they were placed and what to look for, I was able to find all of them without a guide. 
If base building is not your cup of tea, don't worry! There are quests in both the mid and late game that unlock complete control of big pre-built places, even including secret chests full of additional crafting stations and materials you can use to make alterations.
If base building IS your cup of tea, the unprotected areas of this game ARE generated. They are all samey, so don't worry about placement too much. The map has marking tools to help you remember where you've put things. Once an unprotected region is cleared out, it's clear. It will not be attacked by monsters, and no new trees/crops will grow unless you plant them yourself. I never got into the base building and late game customization, but I did have fun populating my single house with traders who would re-stock with goods I didn't want to get myself, and enjoyed surrounding my small house with ever-expanding farmland.
You are able to make every kind of workstation you need from the very beginning of the game, and unlocks for these are only aesthetic.
Inventory management is not an issue. Additional inventory spaces can be accessed through 2 different crafting progressions, and I only found myself completely full a couple of times. 
Exploring and progressing in the game, as well as finding secrets, provide you with scrolls which give your character significant experience boosts to different skills, making skill progression a breeze even if you focus on finishing questlines.

Cons:
Polished Games has not, as far as I can tell, released any other games. From what I can find they are a small indy dev in Poland. That makes the name an excellent pun, and a bit of a misnomer, as this game is not exactly polished.
Realms of Magic runs pretty well. I actually find the art direction to be very appealing. The game controls pretty well, but not always perfectly. I struggled early on with sprint jumping, discovering that for a sustained sprint you want to use shift+direction but I found long sprint jumps were only possible by double-tapping the direction button. It was hard to get a feel for how to get my character to move how I wanted, early on. 
This wasn't a lot of trouble because the game is not challenging. I only used a single playthrough, a melee and armor build, and I did scour every region for all of it's secrets before progressing, so that may contribute to my perception. I found most enemies to be reskins of previous encounters with minor tweaks, and was a little surprised when in the last two regions of the game I started seeing units placed strategically to take advantage of ranged abilities. I will say magic looks and feels underwhelming, so perhaps playing a wizard is hard-mode. In my playthrough, I found that the progression system leads you to specialize in just one kind of weapon, and there was never a point at which it felt worthwhile to deviate. My whole playthrough was spent spamming the same never-ending slice-slice-stab sword combo, occasionally using my RMB to block or use another ability. 
The storylines are pretty basic, the same kind of stuff you see in RPGs, and never deviate from expectations. I found the early game to have some light choices in quest resolution in terms of whether to chose diplomacy or violence, but this stops being relevant fast. Only one quest got an honest chuckle out of me, and it's in the first region. My partner played this game as well and ended up with an ending so different I laughed out loud. 
None of the above is a con as much as it is a preamble to say that typos are common in the script, as well as pieces of dialogue that feel clunky. I quickly found that I wasn't getting invested in the story as much as I was just working on the vibe of each region.
The game does not have replay value. There are no significantly branching storylines. As far as I'm aware race and class are mostly irrelevant. If you play thoroughly, you will completely max out your preferred play style well before reaching the final region.
That said, the game is a headache if you want to complete it 100%. Some achievements are bugged. There is an endgame quest that requires you to bring a series of unique, non-quest items (which I sold to get out of my inventory) to an NPC.

4. Can we attract NPCs to our little sandbox creations? We can make sign posts and pretty much everything you need to create a town. Taverns and whatever. Will NPCs come hang out? Because if not, they need too. Don't want to spend hours creating a ghost town.

다양한 종족, 다양한 스토리,  방대한 세계관 

기본 난이도로 하면 스트레스 없이 플레이 가능합니다. 

마을이나 던전의 맵은 기본적으로 시크릿 아이템이 있는 곳 말고는 땅이 안파집니다.

그외에 일반 필드는 맵이 샌드박스 형식이라 
자유롭게 파고 짓고 가능합니다. 

엑트3에 가시면 마녀가 사는곳이 나오는데 
그곳에서 스킬 초기화 가능합니다 금화 10냥 

필드를 돌아다니면 노예로 부릴 만한 
농부나 광부가 있는데 따라오라고 할수있습니다 

나중에 제가 마을이나 집을 건설한다면 어떻게 이용가능한것같은데 아직은 모르겠네요. 

기본적으로 제작, 거래, 채집 등등 다양한 활동이 숙련도 시스템으로 많이 하면 레벨이 오르지만
필드를 돌아다니면 상자에서 나오는 스킬 경험치 스크롤로  무난한게 올라갑니다.

그래도 어느정도 채집과 제작은 해야 잘 올라요. 

가끔 퀘스트 아이템을 모아도 인식이 안되는 경우가 있었는데
하다보니 다시 인식하네요. 

게임이 상당히 짜임새가 좋은 느낌이라 
버그는 없는것 같습니다.


언리얼엔진4 크래쉬가 초반에 많았는데
이것저것 다해봤자 소용없고 
방화벽에 예외 설정해주면 해결됩니다. 

계속 플레이하면서 또 추가하겠습니다.

상당히 저의 취향이라 같이 하는 분들 많이 생기고 번역도 되었으면 합니다.


아쉬운 점 몇가지 적습니다. 

1. 언어   
아직 한글번역이 없어서 스토리나 아이템 등 직관적으로 이해가 어렵습니다. 
물론 천천히 보면 해석은 가능한 수준으로 어려운 단어들은 크게 없지만 
그래도 재미가 반감됩니다. 

2. 드롭 아이템.
이건 좀 애매한데,  좀 사실적으로 컨텐트를 구성한거라면 
사실 엘프를 죽이던 마법사를 죽이던   소지품이  돈이랑 생수 혹은 포션 일수도 있겠지만
이게 게임적으로 본다면 그래도 메인퀘스트나 네임드 몹이라면 
뭔가 그럴싸한 아이템이 드롭이 되야 재밌는데, 
전혀 그런게 없습니다.    그냥 생수 한병..ㅎㅎ  
이걸 보완하는 시스템이 맵마다 시크릿 상자가 3~6개 존재하는데 
거기에 보면 쓸만한 아이템과 스킬 포인트 올리는 재료템이 들어있어서 충당은 되는데.. 
그래도 좀 아쉽다는 말씀. 


3. 위 내용과 비슷한 부분인데, 
마을에 상점을 운영하는 상인들이 있는데.. 
전혀 도움이 안됩니다.
예를 들어서 내가 어떤 가방을 제작하려고 하는데, 
늑대이빨이 좀 부족하다.. 그러면 옆에 상점에서 늑대이빨 정도는 팔아야 하는거 아닙니까 
마을마다 상인이 파는 템이 똑같다는건 ..  아직 제작자가 손대지 않았다는 거겠죠..
업데이트 기다립니다.


4. 액션과 마법이 단조롭습니다. 

게임의 스토리나 내용물은 방대하지만 
그에 비해 케릭터의 액션이나 마법은 상당히 단조롭습니다. 
플레이 시간이 길어질수록 이부분이 지겹게 느껴지네요.


5.부족한 컨텐츠 

마지막 보스를 잡았는데 잡으려고 잡은게 아니라 
그냥 어찌어찌하다가 만나서 잡았습니다.. 

아직 만들지 못한 갑옷들과 아이템들이 있는데
그것들을 만들 이유가 없어짐과 동시에 
더이상 진행할 퀘스트도 없고 

act 1을  클리어한  기분인데, 
게임이  끝났네요. 

처음 종족을 선택하는 화면에는 대륙이 상당히 크게 나왔는데 
나중에 또 업데이트되면 대륙의 다른 곳들도 가보고 싶은데 
아마 힘들겠죠?

As you can see up there, I only played this for ~45 minutes. That is because, after my initial try-out, I didn't really feel like coming back to it, and going a little further would likely blow my refund-window.

And that, in turn, is mainly because Realms of Magic's combat doesn't feel right.


[u][b]The basics:[/b][/u]
This game is a combat-focused Terraria-like.

You mine, craft stuff, build a base (I [i]assume[/i] you do, because after the tutorial and a series of quick quests, I didn't get to that part in 45 minutes), and fight enemies.

Realms of Magic lets you move from one world location to another, on a map; it has an extensive skill tree, which is a great thing (sorely missed in Terraria and others of the kind, IMO); and skills that you need to level up such as Blacksmithing and Alchemy.

This all sounds great, at first. But, like I said, the combat ruins it.


[u][b]The combat:[/b][/u]
For starters, you cannot run opposite to the direction your character is facing. If you try, he just [i]walks[/i] backwards. If you are moving right, and then you want to run [i]left[/i], you need to move your mouse's pointer to the left side of the screen, turning your character around, [i]before[/i] pressing Shift.

That's annoying, and takes a bite out of your mobility, making your character frequently feel unresponsive.

You also attack a little too slowly. And the worst of all: you have a stamina bar that is drained with each attack. The one time, in my limited experience with the game, when I ran into 2 enemies at once, I had to kill one then stop and stare at my screen for some 15s, while my stamina bar recovered, before being able to kill the second enemy. So... imagine how horrible it must be when you have to kill 3 of them. Or 20.

Jumping feels a little weird. I can't pinpoint exactly why, but it does. Even if it doesn't to [i]you[/i], everything points to this [i]not[/i] being a game in which jumping is used in combat. So, dodging doesn't seem to be a thing here either -- you just move back and forth, block, attack, wait for your stamina to recover, repeat.

That's boring.

Finally [i]and[/i] least: you have melee weapons and magic in the game. But no ranged weapons. I decided to be an Elf, and intended to become an archer but... that's not an option. I assume they didn't implement archery because there's no dodging or flying/jumping enemies, so ranged combat would make things too easy for the player. (I don't know how magic works, I didn't get to try it; I assume you shoot it, but only straight left or right.

With crappy combat mechanics, the best asset of Realms of Magic -- its skill tree -- is pretty much wasted.


[u][b]Other issues:[/b][/u]
You need to change between Build and Combat mode. That's an unnecessary annoyance which every other Terraria-like game makes do without.

The graphics are fine, but I'm not particularly fond of the character animations, at least not for this type of game.

Your Backpack and Character screens are separated, while they could have been joined. Needing to have two different pop-up screens open to equip your character is always a bit of a drag.


[u][b]In short:[/b][/u]
The game feels generally clunky, in particular the character movement and combat.

In 45 minutes, I didn't even get to [i]start[/i] building a base, which means that, if you want to go into that, and be able to give this game a serious go, you'll very likely end up losing your refund window. (And I still believe you'd want to refund it, an hour later).

They had some good ideas here, but the execution leaves much to be desired. With a severely lacking combat system, the whole thing just becomes rather purposeless and boring.",1662659688,1662880178,False,4,0,0.406037449836730957,0,True,False,False,True,,,

In a game called realms of magic I was surprised to find that magic honestly sucks! I got to around level 9 and Summoning magic is near useless. They often die before dealing any meaningful damage.

Either way enemies I would spend 30 seconds on with default melee attacks took nearly 5 minutes with magic. 

Its nearly a great game but doesn't encourage players to actually use magic. It gets formulaic and grindy since magic is so slow. Combat in general is just unreasonably slow.

Why do we have huge towns that I need 30 stamina bars to cross the town? I don't know.

The tutorial is very much not comprehensive, it's a guy who just tells you ""Go here, do this"" a few times before story happens and you're on your own. 

You spend the first hour or so of the game gathering resources and leveling up your various gathering skills, as well as your character. After you level up, you get a talent point. This talent point is not something you spend on crafting, gathering, or exploration based skills, but rather, combat and elemental magic, things you have not been making heavy use of at the beginning. Was hoping to invest my first talent point in any kind of mining skill to make mining and gathering easier, but no such skill or even skill tree exists. It's weapons, combat, and elemental magic only. That's what you spend your talent points on after making a house and bed. 

It also has the problem of way, way too many crafting stations. It is tedious anti-fun to have to go from crafting station to crafting station just to make a door.

Its a addictive open world building crafting RPG with story, factions, quests and characters.

 Hand crafted maps for towns/dungeons/quest locations and procedural maps where you can build for wilderness, works well and makes the world feel alive and moving unlike other games that are procedural and feel bland and soulless.

Quests/story are mostly good, well enough written to be interesting - there are simple fetch quests too but not too annoying and they add some flavor/context to each town.

The wilderness locations are a bit boring though - when you dig down its pretty much the same all the way down except the bottom which is very un-impressive, I was expecting some kind of terrain change or to find some interesting structures or tougher foes as I dug down..... still a really fun game that just stood out as under developed.",1662297155,1662297155,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

My favourite thing about it is the customisation. You can vary your playstyle quite a bit by making your racial choice in the character creator, and there is a slider bar for difficulty - enemy HP and enemy DMG. You can play it like Dark Souls if you want. Or you could play it like Terraria on easy mode. The choice is yours and I absolutely love that and wish more games would have this feature. Even just to negate the amount of reviews people leave complaining about a game's difficulty. 

You can put in all the deathtrap mechanics you want to a game, so long as you give people the opportunity to walk through it all with plot armour on at the flick of a switch, then who is going to complain exactly?

There are some light story elements, some small time quests and mysteries to uncover, but it's nothing insane, the premise seems to be on building a base and crafting stuff, as the world map offers like a thousand different areas or something like that, once explored.

The problem I found was the stuff to do in those biomes. Other than the quests, and the usual gameplay loop found in these games of finding fighting looting etc, there simply isn't much to do. You can find loot, sell it in town and buy some other stuff like in a more traditional RPG, like in Starbound, but you can't really buy anything as interesting. 

There aren't any mounts that I've seen and the usefulness of items sold quickly became nil next to what I could craft. It doesn't feel like a lot of time is given to find the balance between grinding and the crafting system and the prior feels pretty useless. 

Clothes sets or anything would be cool to buy off them. Maybe have a little relationship quest system with each townsfolk  NPC and have them sell unique little inventories that unlock once you're friends with them? It'd help longevity. At the moment once you've bought a few things and done the few quests there's really no reason to visit towns.

And in the biomes themselves I found there weren't any hidden things or anything interesting within the procedural creation. No random little things that are out of the ordinary, compared to Starbound. It has had years of development though, compared to this, so perhaps it's unfair to compare them in regards to content.

The tailored zones are full of interesting little hidden areas though and are usually very well done. The hidden things are, if you don't upgrade beyond the quest's particular area, a worthy upgrade to what you have at the time. There are a few different sets of armour but I would have liked to see way random loot given the nature of the game's explorable map.

One thing I will nitpick on is the way buildings are done in this game. It has this Starbound awkwardness with the architecture which is very obvious when you try to make public / open areas like streets and shops.

Just have the lower part of the building only visible if you open the door and enter it. Which is on the front. So you'd have the building just looking like... a building, from the front, and when you go inside, THEN it transitions to the interior that you can interact with, with the npcs inside or the shop or whatever. 

I'm pretty sure this is how you used to do this in old NES RPGs but for some reason it is STILL NOT DONE in these games. Which more and more, appear to be paying homage to those games. With new technology in a game engine like this, you could up the way they used to do it by not having a loading screen once you enter, just phase the opening away and reveal the interior.

Other than that minor gripe, I really enjoy the game. I am excited to see the dev is still updating it, the last update that adds settlers and people you can find in the randomly generated zones that can join your base and sell stuff. And you can equip them gear. But I really would hope for more stuff to fight... maybe bandit raids on your built homes or towns to spice things up a bit. Random wolf attacks if you choose to keep animals so you have to keep your flock safe.

An awesome feature would be to add the ability to have these settlers be somewhat randomised, not vendors all the time, and instead like a companion. Who could live in a building you set, sure, could become a vendor that you'd like to have there for no reason, sure, but could also follow you. 

You could meet a really tough human dude on the road being attacked by bandits, befriend him, set him up with some awesome armour, and tell him to guard your base. Instead of just having a copy of a system from Terraria, and a less sense making system than Starbounds. A more Conan Exiles approach to npcs would be better. Especially seeing as it's glaringly quite strange to me these days that all these vendors are just here for.... me. My town... like I'm some weird tyrannical overlord or something. Some derranged cult leader millionaire.

No one ever visits our towns to just buy things or hang out, stay temporarily, drink at the bars, do they? It's all AWFULLY barren. That'd be a neat thing to add, too.

Anyway if you were to get that kind of companion system going and have varied, cool, sometimes random or rare stuff to fight like Demonic portals that rarely spawn in underground dungeons on some overworld maps, with Demons and a Demon Lord boss to fight that is really tough... with varied loot... then this game would really be something.

But right now it sits comfortably alongside other decent games like this, with enough of its own quirk to set it apart on the store shelf.

a quick comparison will immediately show that in both game the crafting/base building area is way more important
i am at the end of act two and i still have to understand how exactly this whole crafting work
there are on the map tiles that are ""protected"" from player modification and these are the hub and quest areas like cities or dungeons
i begin to suspect that all the other tiles (that in my mind where simply decoratives on the map) are actually sandbox location
that or i have yet to encounter a specific place on the map that is unprotected
i suspect that is the first of the 2 theories because i am stuck with delievering seeds of specific plants to a faction and i am nowhere near to have the amount required to complete the quest from ""scripted locations"" (the only one i have yet found)
from what little news i have found in internet it seems that i have to grind them in sandbox locations also because differently from the seeds of the first area the seeds of the second area are no found into a merchant inventory or if they are i have yet to identify the merchant in question

not only that but i hav yet to understand exactly how and whre to cut a tree because the game do an horrible job in explaining his mechanics and the only tree i have found are in scrioted not modificable locations

terraria and starbound are true sandbox games
you can farm mine and build almost in any location
in this game no
it seems that there are two games mashed togher 
a rpg with a storyline
and a crafting/base building game
but this game are separate and don't comunicate with each other efficiently

from what i have seen of the rpg part it is not bad at all
(expet platforming) that sucks badly especially because the inner workings of the sprint function (that half of the times doesn't work even with full stamina bar) is still debated among scientist and a profound mistery to even its original creator

jokes aside the rpg part is entertaining and combined with the pixel art a good experience so far
te problem of this game is that it hopes to be much much more but it seems that the developers divided themselves into two team
one for the rpg and one for the sandbox
they created two separte game and then at the end the put the two halves togher

it has potential but it need a good calibration better implementation of the sandbox part and a general polish

miles behind terraria or even starbound as sandbox
a pretty solid rpg in pixel art that can easily absorb a few hours of your time in exchange of a relaxed exploration as rpg

also don't expect terraria level of fighting
way more basic

Some glitches here and there but none were game breaking for me (well I did have to replay a couple areas as there were some glitches that would break a quest but they didn't happen consistently so the replay of small portion was ok).

you get starbound/terraria kinda. however, if compared, its even less content than alpha version starbound.
playtime first run until final boss? less than 15h.
replayability? moderate.
if you find it for 5€ give it a shot :) however for current price n content its a skip.

the world.
medieval/fanatasy setting. There is a world map divided into tiles. about 80% of these tiles can be visited and explored.
the remaining 20% are ocean or mountains which can not. About 70 of these tiles are handcrafted dungeons and towns. and they are rly great designed. here is were the game rly shines.
each of these prebuld maps comes with secrets to discover and minibosses to slay.
all the other tiles are sandbox maps. and those are kinda disapointing, since they basicly all look the same. there are no computer generated towns or dungeons as starbound has.

narrative and progression.
this is where the game shine above starbound, you are not forced to follow the narrative.
there are 2 ways to unlock new biomes and there for new tiers. either finish the storyline of a biome. or find 10 map pieces and craft the map of the next area.
the quest design is rather boring and once you reach the second biom you will hate the game. since you get 3 different quest each asking for certain plant seeds. which have a super low droprate and can not be obtain in any other way.
so yea i was glad to find out bout the map pieces. their drop rate how ever is way too high. you basicly go to 1 sandbox map. dig down for 10min, killing stuff opening chests and you will have the 10 map pieces requiered.
this means i did the questline for biome 1 and 2. skipped all quests of biome 3-6 and only did the quests of the final area since you have to.

difficulty.
the game is overall to easy. playing as a gnome, which is supposed to be the hardcore class (less health n stamina) becomes mandatory if you want to stick to the game.
thing is this game defines your character by the skilltree and the gear you loot. the combat-skilltree provides way too much armor and stamina cost reduction.
the gear is so stupidly strong you wont ever need to drink a potion biome 3+. since the amount of armor health/stamina/mana recovery on armor is just ridiculous.

skills and leveling.
there are 7 skilltrees?!
heavy duty weapons: sword, axe, mace, / fast weapons: dagger n spear / combat: passive stuff like armor n stamina / fire, ice, nature and necromancy
all schools of magic offer an aimed ranged atk, nature n necromancy summon minion as well.
without grinding to much you will be between lv40-50 by the endof the game, which is enough to max out 2.5 of these skilltrees.
yet skillpoints can also be crafted by looting cettain orbs. (rly unnecessary feature imho)
noticed sth? no ranged combat other than magic. no bow, no crossbow, no slingshot, no siege weapons not even as decoration.

construction complexity.
alot of basic things missing. 
- no liquids at all. no ponds, no sewage, no poison, ... no moat! hey i would like to build a d*** castle!
- no block functions. no slippery, no sticky, no need to water soil, no oil to spread fire. nothing.
- no craftable/placeable traps. there are spikes, flamesthrowers etc in dungeons but you re not allow to use any of these.
recipes are kept very simple and with each new tier you only replace ingredients.
believe it or not your main ingredient will be poop. so get chicken asap. :)

addiction factor. low.
- no multiplayer not even local coop.
- no reason to replay the game since races literly have no impact ( excluding gnome ) and even tho quests often have 2 approaches,
by the end of the day the choice doesnt matter at all.
- there is almost no reason to build a farm or craft own weaons/armor. thing is you find way to much stuff during dungeons or exploration.
crafted armor is the best in game yet only on the very last tier, and only about 2% better than the lootable sets.

fun factor?
dialoge are writen nicly n with some slapstick.
some npc names are just way too fitting like that male prostitute by the name of typhus.

PROS:
-- The art is nice
-- crafting good
-- good variety of decorations
-- cool fantasy races + lots of differentiation 
-- premade areas look cool + made of achievable materials
-- can rescue NPCs and have them move in with you


CONS:
-- almost uniformly bad dialog. poorly translated or in need of editing?
-- repetitive combat (no ranged weapons)
-- harvesting too slow / not enough resources (especially trees)
-- rewards from exploring (chests) random and underwhelming
-- NO MULTIPLAYER
-- inventory / ui shenanigans
-- stamina bar too small / sprinting too draining / too slow 
-- not enough ranged options
-- the NPCs you rescue just stand there and sell you things
-- can't stack chests or crates, bottles and goblets can't be placed
-- minimal combat experience for fighting
-- repetitive random generated environments
-- few enemy types


NEUTRAL:
-- deep talent tree but shallow selection of abilities
-- let me harvest + move around those glowing mushrooms and other decorative elements

基本的な操作やクラフトについてはベーシックな作りとなっており、類似作をプレイしてきた方なら戸惑うことなくプレイできるだろう。
キャラメイクではそれぞれ個性的な特徴がある種族を選択することができるため、時間をかけて楽しめるだろう。

ワールドは単一のマップではなくワールドマップがあり、その中で固定生成されたマップ（村やダンジョン）でクエストを行い、森や草原のようなランダム生成のマップで資源採掘やハウジングを行う形。
地域ごとのメインストーリーをこなしていくことで新たな地域（そして資源）が開放されるのだが、クエストに興味はなくただ単純にサバイバルクラフトとして遊びたい人向けに、ランダムドロップの地図を集めることでも地域の開放が可能となっている。

本レビュー作成時点では日本語ローカライズはされていないが、クエスト文章などは中学英語レベルで理解できる程度。
ジャーナルにも端的にどこで何をどうしろとまとめてくれるので、そうそう困ることはないだろう。
作中には世界観を説明した書物や秘匿された宝物のヒントを記したメモなどが多数あるのだが、これをじっくり読もうと思うと腰を据えて取り組むことになるかもしれない。

クラフトはスキル制のシステムとなっており、素材があってもスキルが足りないと作成できないという難点はあるが、ドロップやチェストからスキル経験値を付与する巻物が得られるため、意図してスキル上げすることは頻繁にはない（多少はある）

メインシナリオはリニアなものではあるが、サイドクエストもそれなりにあるので全部をこなしていこうと思うとかなりの時間を費やすことになるだろう。
ただし大体のサイドクエストはお使い的なものが多く、地域によっては何度も行き来をさせられる面倒なものもあるのだが、日数で結果が変わるようなものはなさそうなので、飽きてしまったクエストは後回しにしてしまってもよいだろう。

日本超ローカライズされていないことで敷居は高いと思われるが、ストーリーがなかなかに面白いので少しでも興味を持たれた方はぜひともプレイしていただきたい。

（メインクエストクリア後追記）
メインクエストを完走した感想だが、非常にオーソドックスなRPGキャンペーン1本をクリアしてヒロイックなエンドを迎えたという印象。
すべてのAchievementを開放したい場合はそれなりに稼ぎプレイが必要だが、ストーリーを楽しむだけならば40～50時間程度だろうか。

これから始めようと思う方へのアドバイスとしては、
　・時間がかなり掛かるので畜産、農業（特に果物の木の育成）は早めに始めること
　・食事はキャラビルドに合わせたものを欠かさず食すこと
　・Alchemyは育てば金になる

Summary: 

Realms of Magic is a fun entry into the 2d Sandbox RPG/Action Adventure category. Anyone that enjoys Terraria, Starbound or It lurks Below will no doubt find enjoyment playing it. 

There's plenty of options when it comes to skill trees and I really like the focus on the RPG-orientated features. 

My early impressions are really good, but I'll be playing through the main story in the coming weeks. Once I've completed it, I'll note any issues if they arise.
------------------
------------------
Update 1 - August 5th - Current Version: 1.0.7

I've played around 15 hrs at this point and I'm still enjoying the game. I'm doing a lot of quests and periodically going back to a little homestead that I've built in the first area. There's a couple of buildings and farming patches for me to keep on top of. 

Some minor criticisms: 
-Cheesing and kiting is often too easy. Kiting is as you'd expect, but cheesing is outrageously easy at times. You can outwit a lot of enemies by simply standing on a platform a few blocks above them. They'll remain stationary and let you kill them with mage. 

-Although I'm glad to see quests implemented in the way they are, I've noticed by now (up to act iv in the story) that the quests can be pretty tedious. The typical pattern tends to be: talk to NPC > Go to place > kill someone or retrieve item > go back to NPC. They're not very dynamic, and the story isn't all that captivating. Some of the dialogue is clever and well written, though. 

-The way NPCs (Companions) are just found in the wilderness and follow you until you drop them off could use some attention. These NPCs can also be duplicates (I've got two carpenters at my homestead), They have nothing in their inventories to trade with. They stay rooted where you leave them and don't interact with the environment. I'm hoping that I'm missing something and these NPCs will come to life in the future. 
--EDIT: 1.0.7 patched the empty inventory problem. All companions that are docked at my homestead now have an inventory to trade with.-- 

That's it for now. I'll probably do one more update after I've finished the main story. 
------------------
------------------
Update 2 - August 10th - Current Version: 1.0.7

I've been spamming the game, and really enjoying it. Luckily there were no glaring issues (there were certainly a few near misses). I've completed the main quest of the game, clocked about 45 hours of playtime and feel pretty content with the whole experience. Here are some notes below: 

-Sometimes the quest objectives marked in the journal lack clarity. There's a quest that I was stuck on for a long time, where I had to find a guy in a 'bear hide hat'. It was a total red herring. The guy I needed to find didn't seem to be wearing a hat at all. A quest towards the end of the penultimate act involved gathering crystals. I thought that the game glitched and wouldn't trigger the NPC dialogue, as I'd beaten a boss in the area that presumably had the last item I needed before turning it in. It turns out there was a loose corpse of some rando enemy that had one of the crystals I needed. In instances such as this, it might be advisable to put an animation on 'special' corpses. A shimmering effect would go a long way. Even just having a counter like 'You have collected 5 out of 8 of X item' would save so much confusion. The journal entries were usually fine, but sometimes unhelpful as noted above. 

-I encountered a bug where my homestead was completely wiped. Now, luckily, I countered the problem by reverting to an older save and didn't have to retread much ground, but If I had to go through hours of gameplay again, this would have been a dealbreaker for me. Thankfully, it appeared to be a one-off, but if I lost everything that I'd been building between quests and exploration that would have seriously sucked! 

-Late down the line, given the right prerequisites, you may unlock a permanent buff called 'Divine Intervention'. To put it bluntly, this tilts the game into easy-mode.The buff saves your life if you receive a killing blow. This buff needs to be nerfed. I would change the cooldown so it's at least a minute. I think it's currently 10 seconds, which is nothing. You can step out of a fight and back in with almost zero consequence. Also, I would consider setting a limit on how many times this skill can be used per in-game day. It's OP. 

-Some more minor issues include: 
*Lots of typos in quest dialogue. 
*Walking back and forth for quests can be tedious. The game would certainly benefit from having teleports/waypoints in bigger maps. 
*Minor visual glitches can occur, such as corpses that bounce indefinitely on terrain, or animations that don't cease (even after entity death). 
*The autosave is a little too triggerhappy. It often saves during combat. 

And that's it, really. Had a great time with this game. It's right up my alley. If, like me, you're a massive fan of Terraria, and you're looking for a new game to scratch that itch, this is definitely worth getting.",1659123983,1660170196,True,3,0,0.567104816436767578,0,True,False,False,False,,,

On first impression when I looked it up a few years ago I was hyped that a game with seemingly complex RPG mechanics in 2D format landed on early access, one that would later include both a sandbox mode and an open world RPG. It looked promising, systems were varied and unique, overall something worth getting excited over.

And then I actually tried to beat all the quests in the game.

Long story short? 

- Shoddy English writing likely done by people with no script checking leading to both dull dialogues and sometimes outright broken ones.
- BOREDOM. Sure, some quests involve a few interesting twists, however given that despite the open-ness illusion it feels very limited in the way you could tackle missions or choose to react to the world. Sometimes you are allowed to go against NPC wishes with minimal consequences, other times you don't even get that option. Other than that there's no fun to any of the quests, there is a small amount of exception to some that utilize a few mechanics to makes things exciting, but for the most part its ""go here and kill X stuff"" or ""fetch me this Y"".
- BROKEN (Sometimes). To put it simply: My play time is rather high because I already had to do several runs because sometimes quests would just not be possible at the moment to complete due to major, sometimes not even bug related problems that would lead to a quest that cannot be accomplished. Sure, they'll get fixed eventually, but that doesn't change the fact that this would be AFTER the proper release of the game outside of early access it still got released pretty messy.
- Oh yeah, and turns out all the varied skill systems are just number crunching. It's like skyrim but with no unique equipment or skills that really stand out.

Final recommendation? Wouldn't bother with this even on sale.

It's an RPG that looks like Terraria, but it removes the action/boss parts to replace them with crafting skills and talent points in a way that is similar to runescape (with new unlocked recipes/tiers when you reach a specific level). It's quite casual: trouble won't come looking for you, it's you who is setting the pace. The main maps (probably ~100 of those) are hand-crafted and contain NPCs, quests, secrets etc, and the other maps are randomly-generated sandbox areas in which you can do whatever you like: building your home/base, farming, mining for resources, looking for buried treasures... 

Only complaint is that in the current state of the game, the sandbox areas don't provide much exploration fun: they're all extremely similar, only the tier of resources/loot vary. Once you've seen a couple of them, you've seen them all.

[*]Le jeu offre un large choix de gameplay via c’est 7 différents arbres de talent. Divers choix d’armure et d’arme sont à ta disponibilité, du Guerrier ultra résistant en armure lourde, au Mage en tissu ou bien encore un Assassin DPS. Si tu te cherches encore un peu ou si tu es atteint de trouble de la personnalité le jeu te permet de créer ton Set d’armure qui te convient le mieux. Ah oui aussi, j’ai oublié de préciser qu’il existe 9 races différentes avec des passives respectives pour chacune d’entre elle lors de la création de ton personnage, donc si tu as toujours voulu faire ressortir ton côté gnome Mage des pieds et guerrier de la tête, je pense que tu seras heureux.

[*]Vu que tu dois te sociabiliser bien évidemment les PNJ, euh les villageois te donneront des quêtes à accomplir, le jeu est très centré sur les quêtes pour pouvoir progresser donc évite de les ignorer petit filou. Niveau mob il y a de quoi faire t’inquiète, pareil niveau DJ et si le jeu est vraiment trop simple, tu peut changer de difficulté en hard ou alors si tu es un PGM tu peux custom ta difficulté.

[*]Tu es la réincarnation de Valérie Damidot ? Alors le jeu va te plaire, beaucoup d'élément de décoration sont à disposition, tu peux build de la façon que tu veux, après bon ce n'est pas architecte simulator et on est sur un jeu de type pixel/cubic donc les constructions restent quand même limitées. 

[*]Farmeur de l’extrême dans l’âme ? Eh bien écoute, tu as 16 métiers différents a monter. Voilà que dire de plus, ah si jusqu’au niveau 100, si ça te motive encore plus quand je te dis ça et oui ton perso a des niveaux a monté si ça ne te suffit pas.[/list]

[b][u]Point Négatif/Point à améliorer :[/u][/b]

[list][*]Le jeu mériterait en tant que bon français une grosse mise à jour de traduction pour introduire le Français et plusieurs autres langues (L’Anglais est la seul langue disponible). 

[*]Le jeu dispose de beaucoup de dialogue donc si tu as trop de mal à comprendre l’Anglais attend la traduction du jeu en Français sinon pour les novices/amateurs de l’Anglais les dialogues utilisent de l’Anglais très simple à comprendre et puis ça ne te fera pas de mal de lire un peu d’Anglais non ? Pour les bilingues, vous avez de la chance d’être bilingues voilà.

[*]Malheureusement, il ne se joue actuellement qu’en solo et il a toutes les qualités pour être multijoueur. Mais ne t'inquiète pas, tu n’auras pas le temps de t'ennuyer.

[*]Les combats sont peut-être un peu trop linéaires, il ne faut pas que tu t’attendes à avoir des combats à la Elden Ring désolé.[/list]

Bon aller, je ne t’en dis pas plus, je te laisse découvrir par toi-même un jeu qui en vaut le détour et puis si il ne te plaît pas, tu sais il y a toujours le remboursement Steam.

 You two types of instances with protected and sandbox modes. Quest related instances like: Cities, dungeons, settlements are protected(You cannot break blocks), while normally wild places are sandbox. This reflects well into the gameplay, since the player can alternate between combat and tool/sandbox mode. I love this.

 But on the other hand, I feel like you should only permit fast travel from cities and player-made settlements, but not let player instantly fast travel into unknown lands. I miss a bit of difficulty to move around, because travelling through the world map feels like a super power. Not a problem at all, but that would increase the immersion, you could give the character the ""need"" to build a sign in the place in order to fast travel there. Exploration feels rewarding. Make a ""portal"" in both ends that allow you to move through the map.

 There is not much variety of weapons, there is a moderate to few amount of armor/outfit and few skills. The game can use more skill trees, and more skills for the existing.

 Art style is beautiful, the disposal of colors is a breeze, character design is good.

 Soundtrack is good enough.

 Quests are generic and basic, you don't have a organic feeling into it. There should be more quests than only kill and bring materials. You could defend, scout, build, build a house to someone into a wild place, a faction side quest with a settlement you build yourself. The sky is the limit.

 In general, the price is ok and I feel like it is a fair deal.

Але грі не вистачає відполірованості та деякі ігрові функції мають не найкращу реалізацію. Грі я би поставив оцінку ""добре"". Коротко про плюси та мінуси, на мою думку:

Сподобалось:
+ Сюжетна лінія, яка хоч і лінійна, але допомагає з прогресом та вносить різноманітність у ігровий процес, поступово розкриває гру
+ 2D пісочниця, в який є чим зайнятись: копання, майстрування, будування, фермерство - все це з прокачкою професій
+ Підземелля, битви, різноманітні вороги
+ Прокачка персонажа із деревом навичок, можна створити різні типи персонажів
+ Приємна піксельна графіка та прийнятний саундтрек

Не сподобалось:
- Бойовка не вражає різноманітністю та реалізацією, щей необхідно активувати скіли перед використанням - щоб пульнути файрбол, не достатньо натиснути одну кнопку, треба спочатку змінити активний скіл під ліву або праву кнопку миші, а це зайвий клопіт і все сповільнює
- Дерева талантів занадто прості і нецікаві
- Загадки у дусі платформерів на перманентних локаціях напрягають. Єдиний вихід брати расу гоблін, у якого є подвійне підстрибування одразу (у інших рас відкрити подвійне підстрибування можна не раніше 30 рівня). Але гоблін має найслабші расові риси.
- Расові відмінності погано пропрацьовані
- У версії 1.0 відсутня можливість скинути таланти - тому якщо вам не сподобалось, що ви там набирали - упс! Обіцяють додати у 1.1.

Great music too which would feel at home in an AAA title.

Edited to say the following:

After 50 hours in this game, I can safely say that it has all the pieces to be a must have in the Terraria-like genre. It could use some balancing, loot is underwhelming and combat a little on the easy side with tier appropriate gear in my experience with a spear user. If they made combat a little tougher, which may be possible just with AI improvements then bumping the loot from chests up one tier would make the various tiers more interesting to explore.

There is more to it, but the fact that there aren't awesome set bonuses for gear makes it so much less enjoyable to hunt chests for loot. The bumping up of loot and seeds to  the next tier would smooth that aspect out, but might make crafting feel less enjoyable. Set bonuses could fix that, since you'd be able to make a full set so much easier than finding one. Nothing a few patches can't sort, long term.

There are foods  that need sinks, cabbage could use a fermenting recipe, and corn currently only exists to be ground into flour. Magic being solely controlled through skills instead of equipment means that there's not as much reason to hang on to things. It's fun to progress, more fun than Starbound was, though it suffers from some of  the same issues.

Currently below a point in the map things cease spawning. If they, instead, had ore from the next tier and more gold and silver, with next tier enemies but current tier loot chests (if they did enhance chest loot one tier) then it would be more reasonable to delve deeply and greedily.

There aren't like, old ruins you find below ground, so the underground is possibly the least enjoyable to explore. Between underwhelming chest loot and few if any ore veins between open spaces it's typically best to run from place to place in caves and only cut small pieces out between them.

You end up with a bunch of zones, most of which are pretty useless to you. It's like Starbound in that regard, but even Starbound had gold and silver spread throughout. Gold lacks recipes, which is weird. Gold and silver are never used as ornamentation for armor recipes. A comprehensive balance pass could fix all of this. I hope this game does well, because it's still a high point in the genre for games not named Terraria. I'd love to see this developer be able to afford to release quality patches for some time to come.

Edited, original review follows:

This game HEAVILY apes Terraria, but that's not a bad thing per se. I've played most or all of the Terraria clones I am aware of but so many felt the need to do their own thing to some degree. Crea's research mechanics, Starbound's expanded tech trees and plot based progression, Necesse's town management automation and largely pointless map exploration, Core Keeper's boss based progression (admittedly Starbound flirted with this early on.) and multi layered quasi 3d.

RoM has a map like Necesse, but gives you reason to use it. It has quest based story based chapter progression from what I've seen. It's going more for e.g. ""High HP/damage regular monster"" for the first chapter but I imagine larger bosses are down the road for me. The equipment is more varied than Terraria and there are RPG mechanics as well so there's a lot to do.

I've got a feeling that this may be less fun multiplayer, the maps are fairly small, so there won't be huge boss  arenas for the player to build, but they also ban building blocks in dungeons or combat focused areas. This may be seen as necessary for balance, but trying stupid exploits is organic fun gameplay in a way. It's hard to say that a boss is bad IMO if no one plays it as intended, but I don't think the answer is removing the cheese entirely. I'm sure if there need to be large boss arenas they will be provided  for the player.

The combat is more character skill focused than item oriented from what I have seen, but there probably should be sales of items above your current tier. It's far more silly to limit shops than organic spawning, if there were safer places with no iron that doesn't mean people wouldn't sell better equipment at extortionate rates. That's just IMO, they should sell higher tier gear.

Instead they go all in on xp based progression, get level 15 and you can make all the copper gear, but it starts unlocking earlier and each piece gives near a level in xp so you have fits and starts of easy levels at least early on. You can spend your coin on training, and there are free training scrolls that give flat xp buffs. So far exploration is a little underwhelming, there are no early game balance changers like the ninja stars in Terraria can be for exploration focused players before they improve their gear.

On the one hand these limits mean you won't dive down to get ore and come back with enough to make  a full suit of gear three tiers higher than you have, or find a magic weapon that makes combat a breeze for awhile. On the other it feels like a safer investment to build  a suit of armor and tools each tier.

You can fast travel from map to map via the overworld map but you currently can do so from deep underground. I have yet to dig  a hole straight down to see if rare ores spawn on tier 1 maps for sure but I haven't seen *any* so I imagine gold and silver, even iron probably don't spawn at all in early locations. This makes the home mirror from Terraria useless but there is still a lot of neat stuff that these chests feel like they lack in RoM at this point.

So far it has it's hooks in deep, I may update this with additional impressions.",1658770835,1659256546,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Great quality of life mechanics like autosave w/ options for time-interval, auto-dumping similar items in chest and 'connecting' workstations to chest items. Game rewards gameplay, secrets give good rewards that insentivizes player to seek them out, completionists or not.  Orc racial bonus actually applicable to all class types unlike any other rpg with orcs in it. Change difficulty at any time in the option menu, up to 15x more difficulty than normal, this is great for all folks. 'Side' professions are rewarding but not totally essential, which is great.

Small Bugs: 
-Sometimes I cant loot(interact) a corpse until I switch to harvest/builder mode tool 1 for some reason.
-Sometimes home npc partially sinks into the floor blocks.

Suggestion for devs:
(I do not mind working for any of the stated features above as long as said quests or just the features themselves are implemented)
-Implement a feature where you get to loot all + bury defeated enemies with a single button press without opening up the corpse menu.
-There should also be a 'Take all materials' feature for the animal farms and another that 'Take all materials excluding the feed'.
-Have another potions bar for builder/harvester mode that stores another 4 potions different from in combat mode's potion bar.
-Implement 'Apparels' so that we can put certain armor on Apparels to reskin our current armor.
-Allow refilling multiple empty water containers/vials by holding left click on water source instead of clicking for each. Or any way to make them refill faster, really.
-Weapon tags for each weapon for ease of build. e.g. Bloodfury's weapon head could be a short axe or hammer. Having a tag in description would help immensely.
-Allows 'Full View' of all bags. It can be in a single big window or multiple smaller ones representing each bag that can be 'attached' to the main bag window.

Для начала хочу сказать, что если у вас есть на кошельке лишние 304 рубля (до 3 августа, после уже 435), то я настоятельно рекомендую вам взять эту игру. Теперь же чуть более детально

[h1] Сразу о минусах [/h1]

[b] 1. Отсутствие локализации [/b]
Серьезно, тут нет любой локализации, только английский. На удивление, для многих в наше время это решающий фактор и практически всегда воюют две стороны : ""как можно не знать английский"" и ""я пришел в игру играть, а не сидеть с переводчиком"". Ну лично для меня  язык здесь  понятный и текст я перевожу сразу же, но если у вас с этим проблема, то могу лишь посочувствовать, текста тут много, но об этом позже

[b] 2. Гринд и прокачка [/b]
Отчасти это и плюс и минус, но наверное больше минус. На каждой ""квестовой"" локации есть секретки и временами сильные враги. Из секреток всегда падает один и тот же лут, из сильных врагов, собсна как и из любых врагов, падает рандомный. Из секреток игроку даются : новые инструменты, новое оружие, новая броня, книги опыта и сферы знаний. Как понятно из названия, книги опыта прокачивают опыт в определенной профессии, а из сфер знаний можно создать свиток таланта, который даст дополнительно очко таланта. Чтобы собрать нужное количество сфер придется облазить почти все секретки на доступном участке карты. Да, это может быть интересно, но это может быть чертовски утомительно и лично мне было чертовски сложно достать секретку в пещере острых клыков, где нужно было запрыгнуть на карниз. Прыгнешь сильно - ударился в потолок, прыгнешь слабо - не допрыгнешь, а вот эту тонкую грань нужного прыжка было мне невыносимо достичь. Но я слишком сильно отдалился от темы, то уже проблемы секреток и моих рук, а никак не гринда и прокачки. Проблема гринда же в его затратности. Профессии в игре можно улучшать тремя путями, книгами, у мастеров за звонкую монету и самому, просто создавая разные предметы (исключая те профессии, где нужно собирать вещи ручками, например травничество или фермерство). И это долго и затратно, нужны ресурсы, а их нужно добывать. Имеешь ресурс более высокого уровня, который даст тебе больше опыта? А вот сиди с ним и добивай ресурс, который тебе доступен, чтобы потом, когда увеличишь свой навык, уже делать веревку не из джута, а из льна. Возможно, это базовая механика такого типа игр, но для меня это безусловный минус, ибо время для меня самый ценный ресурс

[b] 3. Загрузки [/b]
Что может быть минусом в загрузках? Микрофризы. Ты дерешься с противником и оп, игра решила сделать автосейв и тебя на доли секунды затормозит, кнопка не прожмется и ты погибнешь. Хочешь загрузится с автосейва и продожить бой? удачи, ты заспавнишся с ""мирной"" раскладкой, а не боевой и нужно будет уворачиваться и пытаться или добить врага, или схоронится в спокойное место, где уже сам игрок быстрым сохранением создаст себе точку.

[h1] Ну вроде с минусами все, теперь о плюсах [/h1]

[b] 1. Мир [/b]
Сюжетные локации очень красивые на мой взгляд, все очень гармонично и аутентично, у охотников висят трофеи, у повара котлы и столы, у торговцев ларьки и тд и тп. НО, тут очень важное но, мир за стенами не живой. Вся карта разделена на два типа локаций : сюжетные с бессмертными объектами, кроме стен для секреток и ""песочница"" дикого мира, где игрок может делать что захочет. В песочнице игрок не увидит как допустим волки едят кобольдов или троглодиты охотятся на крыс, для всех единственный враг это игрок. Даже если с игроком путешествует непись-торговец (вроде сломанная механика, но нужно наиграть больше, чтобы говорить об этом уверенно), то на непися не нападут, а будут охотится опять таки только за игроком (возможно неписи просто бессмертны бонусом, а умирают только во время квестов, но этого я доподлинно не знаю)

[b] 2. Диалоговая система [/b]
Когда я искал видео по этой игре, чтобы посмотреть обзоры или узнать что-то новое, то игру не один раз сравнивали с Террарией и Древними свитками. Каюсь, в свитки так и не поиграл достойно, но чутка про них знаю, а вот тераррия, ну тут лучше по порядку. Почти со всеми НПС можно поговорить, возможно это будет буквально пара фраз, но это будет пара фраз с рандомным неписем, из этих слов можно будет составить определенную картину о мире или о деревне, в которой находится игрок. Иногда могут подкинуть квестов, вроде мимоходом обучить работать со станками или попросить принести/отнести определенную вещь. И тут в отличии от некоторых  ""псевдо-рпг"" выбор фразы решает дальнейшие взаимоотношения игрока и непися, кто-то может и обидеться, если сказать, [spoiler]что он ничего не стоит как солдат и является посмешищем.[/spoiler] Но это уже стоит открыть себе самому. Чутка не относится к диалогам, но также влияет на них - книги. Путешествуя по миру можно найти разные книги, от дневников и поэм, до рассказов о старых богах и записок. Возможно, там будет всего одна страница, но эта страница будет написана и не будет просто текстом ради текста (ну я так надеюсь)

[h1] Суммируя [/h1]
Лично мне игра понравилась, да, она не без минусов, но для меня плюсы (хоть по цифрам их и меньше) перевешивают их. Для этой игры мало моих 10 часов, для более полного мнения нужно наиграть больше, гораздо больше

- Crafting is intuitive and fun, nothing groundbreaking
- Pre-generated areas feel rewarding to clear

leveling is just straight grinding in this game you need to grind a lot for useless items that you will never need note the fun kinda of grind that give satisfaction is not in this game.
the art style if very plain 2d pixel game no beatuifull at all (and wtf in the charchter creation menu when you make your charchter and try to chose some eyes you can see both eyes in one side like wtf i know humans do not have 2 eyes in one side or you sure cant possibale see the entire front face from a side shot )

It's a fun little game that scratches the open world, survival crafting itch. The handcrafted ""protected"" maps are mostly good, with interesting details and optional platforming rewards. The procedural generator ""sandbox"" maps are... ok. It's good if you just want a random area to gather resources and have a few fights but aren't overly interesting.

The game is a bit rough around the edges. The autosave causes the game to stutter, which can be painful during platforming or fights. As others have said, there isn't much juice or effects for potions, which can feel a bit underwhelming. It's certainly a playable game, but it could use some more polish. Hopefully the indie company ""Polished Games"" keeps working on it and lives up to the developer name. ;)

Edit: The autosave seems to be slightly better after the update, and they seemed to clean up the Save menu slightly. Not bad. :)",1658675625,1658930890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[b]The Good:[/b]
[b]+[/b]Decent pixel art. Somewhat plain, but good details, like equipment changing your look.
[b]+[/b]Ambitious amount of detail in races, skill tress, skills.
[b]+[/b]Dialog trees, though they could use some tuning to make them a little less dry.
[b]+[/b]Large amount to craft.
[b]+[/b]""Static"" levels are fun to explore, as there's hidden chests.

[b]The Bad:[/b]
[b]-[/b]Doesn't seem to run great on my hardware (AMD 5900x/RTX 3080) on medium setting, 1440 windowed.
[b]-[/b]Not every container is lootable, but you won't know if it is or not until you get close and manually mouse over every single one. The ""hidden"" containers are the exception, as they have a orange/yellow particle effect until looted.
[b]-[/b]Sprint doesn't work half of the time, with or without stamina, when platforming on 1-2 tile wide platforms. This makes platforming rather tedious quickly.
[b]-[/b]Limited weapon choices—axe, sword, hammer, dagger and spear. Some spells and summons, but from what I tried they are kind of weak. No bows, and no short term plans to add them.
[b]-[/b]Game [i]claimed[/i] it was autosaving, but there are no saves to load. I lost all my progress due to this, since the game pauses every five minutes to do this I didn't bother saving on my own. Technically my bad, but what was the point of pausing gameplay every 5 minutes, including in the middle of fights?
[b]-[/b]Crafting's a bit overwhelming as there are a TON of dedicated crafting stations.
[b]-[/b]Dialog is overly verbose for what it is, and super cringey most of the time. Things are either mundane, or borderline incel. Kinda... weird. The conversation about the lady's dress was one of the earliest moments of ""wtf"" for me.
[b]-[/b]Basic combat is kind of easy to the point of being boring. AI isn't particularly challenging and you can usually just hop out of the hole you're in and pelt stuff at range.
[b]-[/b]Everything is some variation of a fetch/kill quest. I'm only in the second town and losing interest in crafting tin axes.
[b]-[/b]Can't mitigate janky feel of controls by rebinding them. Apparently, adding this in the future isn't possible according to developer.
[b]-[/b]No co-op.
[b]-[/b]Lack of feedback when using potions. No noise/effect at all on the character, just the buff icon (thought the health potion will pop out small heal numbers).
[b]-[/b]Lots of randomly generated loot with little variations in stats that are a bit annoying to sort through, as there's no quick visual way to check if it's better than what you have (green/red color coding on the stats of previewed items, for example)
[b]-[/b]Game economy seems weird, with things like tin armor being better than the town guard's armor in stats, but costing less. Not sure if this is throughout the whole thing, but it was pretty noticeable starting out.

As I said—this could be good, and the fundamental idea is interesting (Terraria/DnD hybrid), but it just needs way more work before I can recommend it.

Realms of Magic touches upon the same type of game-play that these other two highly successful titles have. Albeit, a little differently.

Villages are pre built and not generated, meaning people have names and have existing backstories. Backstories that build the character of the towns. Quests in cases relate to these backstories even if it's something as simple as recovering clothing from a one night stand. Not every quest is to save the world.

The best bit? You don't have to do a single quest, you can unlock the next area with map fragments found in random places in the zone via enemy drop/chests. Quests are 100% optional and a few of them have multiple choices. Non violence is an option in some cases.

- Everything you do nets you exp towards level ups, crafting/gathering included. Crafting is complex enough without being tedious. You can grind out crafting levels and become stronger via the experience that is applied to your main class. So doing every profession, if you desired to, would reward you with level ups and talent points. Mining is an example of this, so literally nothing is a waste of time even if that skill isn't something you care about.

- Talent trees are fairly complex. I personally love Mace spec, Fire spec interests me and I can't wait to try it out.

- Race selection is extremely critical and they can vastly alter gameplay. Lizardmen being an example of a pure combat Race, others excel in skills by large factors and/or have unique abilities.

Also, story mode is quite long, as I'm 25 hours in at the time of typing this and I may have just passed the half way point.

While there aren't traditional ""classes"", you can build your character as you see fit. Want to be a spear user and go heavy armor and fight enemies up front? You can do that. Want to go pure Necromancer or Druid build? You can do that! Or mix it up, and be a combat caster! Swords, Axes, Fire, Ice, it's all there. Crafting is also quite rewarding, as you level (and it's needed for side quests), you can pretty much over gear the next zone by grinding your crafts out ahead of time.

Combat isn't bad. The game starts off slow, and ramps up. You go from crushing giant rats to destroying Minotaurs, Cyclops and human enemies. Boss monsters are also there to pose a challenge, and offer rewards for their defeat. Add in secrets across each landmark and you have plenty to do.

Want to build your own base? Maybe make a farm? yup, you can do that. All the tiles on the map (excluding mountain ranges) and their own random generated sandbox. where you can pluck the land dry.

If I had to give the game two negatives, it's that the AI isn't always top tier and you can manipulate them into positions where they can't fight back.

From everything I've seen so far it's a great RPG/crafter and I expect to play it for at least 25-50 hours to complete it once or twice, maybe a couple hundred hours if it holds up and get updates.

The game is spread around cells with loading transition between them, a huge number of randomly (or pre-randomly?) generated cells and dungeon cells proper, the later very interestingly disallowing crafting. 

The first impression within the tutorial was strong. The game is beautiful, the animations smooth, the mechanics are solid if a little slow overall at first (getting quickly better with the right stats and talents) while the NPCs and story are lovely.

Every weapons strike pattern feel unique and while it doesn't bring a whole lot of ""new"" to the table what it does, it does well. There's a ton of talents spread among 7 talents trees. While most of them are of the boring stat boost variety there are various ""gamechanger"" skills, spells and summon sprinkled in that make the game most fun.

My only concern is music, while my expectations are low and I'm fine with generic and sparse (or even inexistent), as long as there's a punch and originality to it, here the quality ""seem"" high but there's nothing hooking me. Just a small thing, I guess.

Leaving the review here, for now, might update later as needed but the game is a strong positive as-is.

Review:
At first glance of this game, it seems a bit boring, 2d Texture, the combat looks pretty repetitive.
I bought it and thought what the hell, ill try.
And oh boy was i happy to have been wrong on my first glance of this game. The 2d Texture, not the best, but the combat, the story, and the feeling of freedom while playing this game, is insanely satisfying.

I fist got blown away when i saw the character creation screen. There was several races? Many races to choose from actually, and all of them having different bonuses and different play-styles. For example the dwarf is sturdy, takes less damage and gains more exp from mining, which means he will expertly excel in building him tanky and focusing on mining, smelting and blacksmithing. While the orc for example has a berserker ability, meaning that every time he attacks he gets bonuses to damage, health etc. so him you want to build full on murder hobo build close range. While the elves have big bonuses to magic and exp gain, meaning they are perfect for building an arch mage.

And of course, the gnome....... the devs created this little bugger to create a hard mode. They have negative everything, i mean everything, health, mana, stamina, even regen. the only thing they are good at, is farming.
Ive seen a few reviews mentioning this game is too easy, WELL HERES THE BLODY ANSWER!!!! they made the gnome, specifically for you people, the hardcore people! play a gnome and cry!

The perk system have a few different trees, 2 Close combat, 4 Magic and 1 generic combat.
What i've seen so far, you can combo these trees to make insane builds, like: play Dwarf + Generic combat health perks + Wild magic armor and enemy less damage perks. And you will become a walking thick plate tank. How can you do damage? take some summons from the wild magic tree. and all you need to do, is walk up to enemys, spawn some creatures and watch them trying to hit you in their futile attempts, while they are being torn limb from limb by plauge rats, boars and bunnies...... oh god the bunnies......

Story wise, pretty good, it got me to laugh a few times. you also in a lot of quest have multiple endings to them or can delve deeper into the quests lore.

The map is humongous, every tile on the world map is a place you can travel to, there you can mine, chop wood, create genocides, and all the fun that comes with. And when you return to these places, they remain the way you left them..... that was mind blowing for me, since the map is so huge, i truly didn't think they could have that.

Last words: Its a good game if you enjoy RPG's where you create your own character and future. If your a hardcore Terarria or Minecraft nerd, then you may not like this game super much. Cause this game also revolves around doing quests, and following a story line, you cant just run to the final boss, you actually have to go from town to town, learning about the World and gaining exp to level up.",1658512481,1658512594,True,44,2,0.740954875946044922,0,True,False,False,False,,,

All crafting skills and things like mining, tree chopping, etc all level up by either visiting trainers, finding scrolls, or simply performing those tasks.  With that said, game provides different ways to play the game in a way.

You got also a skill tree that lets you use magic of different elements or learn weapon skills or passives for defense/offense.  Back in early access, I actually had ignored magic altogether except a buffing spell or a heal and went for weapons/armor passives and skills and it all worked out great, but enemies were lot weaker back then too.  Even now, you can still give enemy more health and damage if you find things too easy or give them less if too hard with a few presets already in place.

It's a low budget game that still lot of fun especially if you into the storyline, but best part is you can play as a lady dwarf and that's worth thumbs up alone.",1658427703,1658427703,True,4,0,0.521494150161743164,0,True,False,False,False,,,

All issues I reported were fixed (sometimes even in the release preview version)!

For me this was early access done right, and yes I do recommend the game if you can get along with the art and more action oriented combat with the occsional (mostly optional) plattforming for treasues and achievements.

Other interesting and in my opinion good aspects
- The game is balanced around locations / regions, there is no level scaling with the player level.
- You level up your skills by using that skill or alternatively by finding a suitable trainer and paying money
- The game has location specific handling (you can see the info on the map / travel screen in advance):
-- 1) fixed locations such as quest locations and cities in which you can not change the environment much (only some dirt here and there to find hidden items but nothing crazy) 
-- 2) sandbox locations in which you can shape and build to your liking.

[h1] STORY [/h1]
In fact, we write the plot in this game with our actions when communicating with the NPC.

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]
Gameplay is about exploring the world and points of interest in it.

The local world is divided into relatively large locations located at points of interest.

There are large buildings and dungeons that are teeming with dangers, monsters and treasures.

There is a progression of heroes and the study of skills.

I was pleased with the variety of races - there are as many as 9 of them. There are many options for crafting and building.

Consider the pros and cons of the game, sum up.

[h1] PROS: [/h1]
+ Nice 2D graphics.
+ Good music and sound accompaniment.
+ Good role-playing system with races and skills.
+ Good crafting and building system.
+ Excellent beautiful locations.
+ Many kinds of enemies.

[h1] CONS: [/h1]
- Not detected.

[h1] CONCLUSIONS [/h1]
The game is very good. It has a lot of content and opportunities to explore the local world.

Still a bit rough around the edges but has undeniable potential.

Main Pros:
- Really neat progression, with incentive for a balance between exploration, crafting, gathering and questing
- Good sense of freedom, you get to choose how slow or fast you want to progress in the map regardless of the main questline
- Gathering materials for crafting doesn't feel too grindy or too easy overall
- Great amount of content, especially for its price tag
- Diverse humor throughout the game, even with the dark tone of the main plot. Had some good laughs :)
- Excellent variety in terms of equipment, allowing for varied playstyles
- Interesting talent tree, you can customize your character itself to fit your playstyle as well

Main cons (are less important, but got into more details):
- Geography of proc-gen regions (basically every tile other than towns/dungeons/POIs) is VERY monotonous. Although the type of materials, plants and enemies change, different areas of the game play pretty much identically. More could be done to make exploring sandbox tiles of the map more exciting and refreshing once you get to a new region, even though the designed locations are quite good
- The lack of polish is clear, and the devs are aware+open about that, which is great. Some dialogues and journal entries don't quite match, bringing a bit of attrition in some quests - mainly breaking the veil of immersion
- Weapons have different effects and very practical differences, especially with talents... but FEEL quite similar due to the swing motions and lack of more tangible, visual differentiation.
- The character race system feels unfinished, outside of the creation part and stat differences it doesn't impact the kind of playstyles you could have or how NPCs react to you.
- The narrative and dialogues feel a bit childish/stereotypical. NPCs could have more depth and personal motivations

Bottom line is, this game is definitely worth its price and the time you put into it. None of those cons really get in the way of having fun while playing :)",1656354149,1656354149,True,101,3,0.88658982515335083,0,True,False,True,False,,,

As far as terraria inspired games go this is middle of the pack - it's playable, but unexceptional and boring.

When/if all the bugs are dealt with (and there are a lot of those), the game will still be meh:
The sandbox areas are just boring, same pattern repeated over and over with few different resources and a few different enemy types, most of them reskins.

Some concepts and mechanics are either abandoned or just redundant, ex - notes about hidden treasure are useless since 90% of the time you can just see where they are when just running around and the last 10% you just see different material wall and break it open. Growing anything is also completely redundant since just running trough sandbox areas and collecting everything will be way faster than growing them, and you never really need that much resources.

Combat is okay, but unexceptional too - there is basically no unique equipment and not much combat skills, and since skillpoints are few, you wont max out even a few skill trees, and even if you could there is not much of a reason to since there is little synergy between them.

Idk what more to tell here, the story is fine but predictable, and i was hard pressed to read it since the text is hard to read, and with grammatical mistakes.
If i didint have a backlog of podcasts to listen to i would not have lasted more than a few hours in this game.
Also, why does this have open wold survival craft tag? It's neither open world (instanced areas, and even the map you need to unlock area by area), nor is it survival, unless survival now just means having hunger/thirst system, and here it just debuffs you, you dont even die if it runs out...

Un terraria avec l'impression d'être dans un véritable monde vivant, avec des villes des villages des gens quoi.
Des environnements sandbox où construire sa maison ou toute autre création labyrinthique et farfelue.
Une véritable impression de grandeur des bâtiments, les parallax en arrière plan sont vraiment bien foutus et grandioses.

Une multitude de cartes (une cinquantaine) à explorer, avec pleins pleins pleins de trésors cachés. 
Les cartes à explorer sont souvent très bien foutues et très jolies.

Le jeu est très beau et très maniable (coté plateformer exigeant mais jamais injuste ou désagréable)

Un système d'artisanat sympa même si un peu simple et répétitif sur la fin (progression par tiers oblige)

Les moins:

Histoire pas terros. Nullissime au début, elle finit assez cliché mais un (petit) effort a été fait a fur et à mesure que l'on avance dans le jeu.
Les combats sont ... pas mauvais, non mais pas excellent non plus (on est a des années lumières de Terraria par ex).
Combats de boss inexistants.
Les zones sandbox (celles pas faite à la main) sont pas follichonnes. Ca devient vite répétitif. Y'a pas vraiment de changements, de biomes dingues et interessants. Les sous sols sont tous rigoureusement identiques, sympa mais identiques (c'est toujours le même biome).
La progression se fait par tiers et peut être assez lourde, ne nous laisse pas vraiment libre de notre progression (comme Starbound en fait, pas de allez go jungle après 15 minutes de jeu comme sur Terraria par ex).

Conclusion: Très bon jeu au final, très beau avec une quantité de cartes faites mains impressionnantes et de très bonne qualité. Le sandbox construction est trés bien. Le sandbox exploration devient par contre très vite répétitif (cela dit les premières fois, ça fonctionne plutôt bien).

Reviewed on 1.0 Release Preview patch.

- Movement direction is determined by which side of your character/screen the mouse is on, not whether you're pressing A or D. If you're coming from Terraria style games (like me), this is horribly frustrating. Pushing A with the mouse to the left lets you run left, but pushing D makes you slowly walk backwards. To turn directions, you have to stop holding a movement key, stop holding the sprint key (if sprinting), move the mouse, hold the sprint button (optional), then push the other movement key. If you're sprinting in one direction, then push the opposite direction (which you'll do often in gameplay), the entire screen also vibrates rapidly while you walk backwards.

- Can't rebind Shift and left Ctrl. These seem to be hard coded/bound in the game? Even if I cleared the keybinds using Shift I still couldn't bind it.

- Music volume slider just doesn't work. Music at 0% in the tutorial and music at full blast. Sound slider does work, though.

- Combat feels (and looks) like I'm playing QWOP. Google it if you are too young to remember.

- One of the Elf race descriptions says they are great with bows. So they get bow weapons, right? Nope, they don't exist, unless they don't have a skill tree and the Steam discussions are outdated.

If you want Terraria with Skyrim/OSRS elements, this might tick all of your boxes if you can deal with the controls and are okay with melee or magic combat only.

If you like games like Terraria/Starbound, as well as games like Skyrim, this is a perfect fit for you! 

Fun story with lots of side quests, along with a ton of sandbox territories for building, adventuring, treasure hunting, farming, animal raising, etc. 
Combat is simple, but gradually gets harder with each region which adds a fun challenge. You can summon creatures to fight with you, use magic, pick from a range of weapons, etc. 
Villages and cities are intricate and filled with NPCs with their own personalities and storylines. Lots of merchants to find and get new goods. 
Opening new regions leads to not only more story, more sidequests, and new merchants, but also new materials for crafting and building your bases, new monsters, new animals to tame, etc.

If you're like me you may have even seen the trailer and bought the game assuming it was multiplayer, and we disappointed when it wasn't. Also the title of the game is bad. Other than that. This game is a solid Terraria/ Skyrim hybrid. No I don't feel bad blatantly naming other titles here, because the inspiration is also quite blatant. Also I will continue to be salty about this game for no multiplayer. I actually love the concept of this game, but would use this as an excuse to use a ""middle of the road"" review option rather than a recommended just because it seems like the developers can't be bothered to add multiplayer even though they know that it's by far the most requested feature.

My experience in this game is really positive with very little negative. 

Graphics: Pretty sharp for a game of this style. you can really see the cosmetic changes with your character when you equip new gear and every item is distinct. Its quite easy to find what you are looking for without having to mouse over things. Thats about all i got on that. 10/10 for the game engine used. 

Controls:  This is kind of complicated for someone who rarely plays 2d games. Mouse placement controls the direction your character is looking and where s/he attacks. It took some getting used to but after about an hour playing it became second nature while playing.
Right clicking equips items and there is a glorious ""Sort bag"" button. it makes finding stuff in your inventory super easy when you learn the order it puts things in. Placeables first, armor, weapons, tools, pots, food, water, loot(drops)
It took me a while to figure out how to place background blocks (right click) but i should have figured that out sooner. Its nice being able to make a layered house and farm that looks nice. I agree with the control scheme. 
interacting with the world and other NPCS is nicely summed up into one button ""E""
Overall the controls are comfortable and there is plenty of utility to organize so you dont clutter up too fast.  This gets a score of 8/10 only because i want a ""Sort chest"" button. ""Stack"" is nice but i would like a sort button too. 

Sound: The music tracks and sound effects are top notch. Great music for each area and also while mining. It is lovely atmosphere for the game I am very pleased with it. 8/10 (i'm not a music guy)

Gameplay: Progression in this game is whatever you want it to be. You can either quest and fight things to unlock new areas or you can completely avoid the towns and just gather materials fight monsters and craft your way to new areas. If you find and assemble map pieces you can move on to the next zone before you do any story. This game is entirely sandbox and exactly what you make it. 10/10 for true freedom of progression. 

Crafting: The crafting in this game is DEEP. there are an absurd amount of craftables, placeables, food, and equipment. You have to level tanning to craft heavy armor and you have to farm or gather crops to level your weaving to level up tailoring. crafts are dependent on other crafts and its nice to have to work on many things to accomplish a craft goal you have. Also if you have a chest or storage container relatively close to the crafting station you can pull from the chest to craft. You do not need materials on your person. Great addition to such a complex crafting system.  10/10 for the crafting system.

Combat: Combat is ""Okay"" If your good at backing up and moving forward you can pretty much handle anything. You can be cheap in any non protected area and trap monsters inside a box and just shoot them with magic at your leisure. I guess there is no way around that in such a free game but the dungeons you get to explore that are protected are still a pretty good challenge if you do them at the correct level. Overall i give it a 7/10 when you dont cheat the games mechanics. 

Quests: Quests are like every other rpg ever but its hard to make novel quest lines. Kill this gather that. There are some quests where you have the option to not be a murder hobo and still complete the quest. Overall nothing groundbreaking. One questline i have enjoyed is Kathern's quests. Shes a farmer who will grow crops for you if you get her the seeds and will always keep them planted and restocked for you to collect as you need Pretty great long term reward for a fetch quest in my opinion. 6/10

Though it's still skill trees, so you can't be all the classes and it's better to pick one. Plus it has enough customization that you can stick with one. It has a LOT of sandbox zones separate from core game towns and quest locations. These sandbox locations you can mine in, cut down trees in, raise rabbits or chickens in, craft your house/fortress in, anything you want. I do love that system.

C’est pour Windows, et ça tourne bien via Proton sur les PC Linux. Les sauvegardes actuelles (juillet 2021) seront compatibles avec la version finale.

Le personnage est crée en choisissant une race qui donne des bonus/malus qui influencent légèrement le développement, sans être restrictif.
Par exemple mon perso est un gobelin, un peu plus agile et fragile (que les humains référents), et commence avec le double saut (qui se débloque optionnellement plus tard pour les autres, et donne un triple saut du coup pour le gobelin).

En utilisant les compétences, elle s’améliorent. Une fois une compétence au niveau supérieur, le personnage gagne des XP qui feront monter son niveau.
Exemple en passant de 4 à 5 en coupage de bois, le perso gagne 5XP. En passant de 76 à 77 en cuisine, le perso gagne 77XP.
Le perso gagne aussi des XP en se battant.
Une fois la barre d’XP pleine, le perso gagne un niveau, et un point de talent.
Il existe plusieurs arbres de talents, non exclusifs : spécialisation dague, lance, épée... ou encore magie de la nature, du feu, du froid... ou encore amélioration globale avec double saut, régénération de mana, consommation d’endurance, bouclier anti magie...

La carte est d’abord fermée à la première région, et il faut accomplir moult quêtes pour débloquer la région suivante, etc.
On peut ne pas faire les quêtes, et explorer pour trouver des éclats de carte, qui débloquent une fois complétées les régions associées.

La carte est divisée en cases, avec deux statuts : protégée, ou bac à sable. Le premier empêche toute modification du terrain, on ne peut pas couper les arbres, construire une cabane, etc. En générale, ces lieux sont pré-construit et sont des villes, donjons, temples, etc pour les quêtes. En bac à sable, on peut tout casser, et construire, à la Terraria.

Je recommande ? Oui bien sûr, malgré la relative linéarité de la progression (bronze, fer, acier...), au bout d’un moment c’est plutôt horizontale (plus de magie, plus de vie, plus de rapidité...) et un peu moins verticale.

Lo stile grafico è minimale ma carino,anche se in alcuni punti sembra quasi grezzo(cioè alcuni oggetti sono fatti bene,altre cose sembrano troppo grosse e danno quel senso di brutto).
La maggior parte delle missioni sono ripetitive: portami questo questo e questo, uccidi caio,sempronio, parla a tizio (solitamente si risolve in un lo ammazzi)
La storia è boh,niente di speciale.
Ho speso un sacco di ore su questo gioco per vedere se verso la fine si riprendeva(sapete un tutorial fatto di 3-4 capitoli è un po' lungo in ogni caso) e verso la fine diventa un pelo più difficile,rimane il fatto che spammando una skill ripetutamente si uccide tutti senza fatica,dei danni possiamo fregarcene,solo di rado mi trovo con poca vita.
La meccanica del gioco dei talenti mi aveva attirato,come anche lo stile di combattimento,bello anche che ogni pezzo di equipaggiamento ti da dei bonus in diversi campi,MA non ha senso se io one shotto gli avversari ogni volta..che sfida è? che gioco è?
Altra cosa importante sulle quest: inizialmente dicono i nomi dei personaggi a cui andare a parlare o riferire o riportare le cose,dopo un certo capitolo no, e la qual cosa è maledettamente fastidiosa poichè le città cominciano a diventare enormi,prendendo anche 2 caselle(la odio quella maledetta città) e ovviamente non ti dice più i nomi del personaggio da cui tornare  o dov'è situato,non c'è nemmeno una freccia che indica dove devi andare,nulla..cioè se io mollo il gioco qualche giorno e poi torno a giocare,finita una quest se non ricordo da chi devo andare o dove sono impossibilitato a finirla..beh fantastico.
Dimenticavo: gli achievement di steam praticamente non li prende,ne avrei diversi che ho completato ma si rifiuta di darmeli,il che spiega perchè molti hanno uno 0%

The last one I think deserves some real expansion.

I could never get in to Terraria, I'm not a boss hunting, rare ingredient/equipment finding/hunting kind of person. Been there, done that, got way too many damn t-shirts! I wanted a game that has some depth of character progression, a larger world with renewable resources, and real freedom (no attachment to story/prophecy or end in sight unless you want there to be an end). Crea got so close to that, but resources run out in that too, and it just can't fit that large/open world I was looking for.


This game does it for me! It's still in development and a bit rough around the edges (the mouse movement feels wrong in a way, you can only mine one block at a time, no official support for Linux but proton works great as of writing this), but the idea it is executing scratches the itch I've had for a while!


The only problem I really have with it is that multiplayer isn't going to happen. It was considered for a while but then finally dropped entirely, making this a strictly single player game. That really disappoints me, bringing a couple-few friends in to this kind of world would have been great fun!

This game isn't fun.  Lots of tedium, lots of fetch quests, lots of crafting skill grinding.  You have to get cornbread for some gnomes? You need 50 cooking skill to make cornbread.  Better do a butt-ton of farming/scavenging to get enough ingredients to get your skill level that high.  Also the plot is kinda lame, I can't kill certain bad guys, I have to kill the elves and can't make peace. This game looks like starbound or terraria, but it is very linear.  Also several items that you grind for are completely worthless.  Like the maps of splinterville (the maps would let you unlock a region early but that isn't clear from the description and the regions unlock fast enough that you never need them). There are also severe balance issues.  Translation errors abound.  You can cheese every enemy in the game with ice spike.  On the positive side the tile sets and art assets are great, the music is good.

Things that need to be fixed:
-Game breaking glitch, Can't turn in quest to hand orc's crystals back over to Orwell.  If this is the end of the finished part of the game, You're a jerk for not putting a notification there.  Given that you can't assemble the map to get beyond, it kinda looks like that is the case.
-Tilled soil reverts to regular soil.  This only adds tedium to the game as you have to constantly switch back to the hoe while planting.  
-Only 1 tier 1 hoe.  Let me till faster or more than one tile at a time, tilling soil is one of the slowest areas of the game.
-Generic crafting XP is awful.  It takes a boatload of wood and time and doesn't go anywhere.
-Fertile soil is way too expensive at 20 poop per tile.  So you finally get husbandry set up, create a massive farm to feed your animals and you can create maybe 10 tiles of fertile soil a week.
-Chopping trees takes too much time, not the chopping but waiting for it to fall. Even late game when you one hit the trees, you still have to hang around while they turn into logs. You can't just run and chop, it is run chop pause repeat. 
-Vendors don't sell enough items.  The vendors in the largest city had mostly empty inventories.  Have them sell building supplies, raw materials, dirt, etc.  
-Drinking potions should produce glass vials.
-Filling glass vials with water is super tedious because you have to click once per vial (given that you need hundreds if not thousands to level alchemy this is unacceptable).  Let me hold down the button to fill them all or fill them faster.
-Enemies aren't challenging at all,  it wasn't until the very end of the game that I started noticing damage being done and it was all mitigated by a lesser healing potion. Except for undead sheep, they do a glitchy amount of damage when they spawn on top of you.",1617687347,1617854412,False,7,0,0.572534680366516113,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Disclaimer: The game is fresh, it will probably change a lot.

The soundtrack for sure on +.
Quests? It depends. Most of it is ""bring, take out, sweep, kill those rats from the basement. Oh! And bring me 20 wolf fur by the way"", but a few are really cool, especialy main story line.
I would like to add that after completing a short tutorial, some of the quests still look like a typical how-to-do that is supposed to teach us the things that we learned 4 hours ago (example: in act 3 they teach us how to grind flour ... come on).
As for pixelart, the graphics look cool. The locations have a lot of detail.
The gameplay is simple, a bit overwhelming with the routine and the number of items, which differ only in the ""biome tier"", fortunately managing the inventory is made easier by a lot of slots. 
Skill trees terribly shallow. Some gamechangers are missing. 1/4 of trees are skills, the rest are just some flat synergies like ""10% damage"", ""bigger aoe"" or ""HP for minions"".
I played tank / necro myself. No challenge, just summon an army and
do some melee after using all your mana, and if your opponent is stronger, drink a few mana potions and make an even bigger army. Too ez. 
And the economy. Trading doesn't make much sense. Already in the first act, after getting the basic equipment and several levels, it is enough to enter the first sandbox chunk, dig down and after 10 minutes we will find gold ore, which give us money enaught to end of act 3. Not only that, we can hardly buy anything that would be useful. Lack of rare ""chase"" shop items or some exotic ingrediences to spend money on. 
Most of the things we have to create ourselves, which is not supposed to be bad, but the raw materials we farm running from left to right on the first biome. 10 minutes of running, 10 minutes of metal digging and a few side locations are all we need to max out in a given act. A bit shallow. Repeat every act.
In fact, we can use any crafting table and rob the entire city (most of it is crap). Nobody reacts. When we combine this with the fact that resources literally lie on the ground outside the city, building any base is pointless, and it spoils the immersion a bit. We run from the village to the village and hear what bad times have come and what kind of people are not poor, and we collect the winter supply of onions and carrots in 2 minutes.
As for me, this is the main problem at the moment. Let's give access to all workbenches so that the player can get to know the game mechanics, but only in act 1, let it only work for low-level gear. And let it be difficult to find some resources in the wild.
Despite these few drawbacks, the locations are made quite nice, most of them have hidden collectibles, interesting loot and they look really good. Each of them has some unique theme, sutch as cemetary, wolfs den, necro cave or abbadoned village with wandering bandids. Basic stuff, but works realy well. Visiting them is a lot of fun. The exploring is simply addictive.
For me it is 7/10. A fun game to play at once, maybe back after few patches. Easy to exploit, I would even say it's too easy, but it makes up for in the atmosphere.
If they introduced multiplayer it would be wonderful. Such a second terrarium on steroids. (I had to write it: D)

Terraria HEAVILY focuses on finding rare things, mining, crafting and fighting difficult bosses, this game, however, focuses on a greater world, towns, story, questing, rpg mechanics and skill trees.
As someone who likes similiar games like Terraria and Starbound, I can tell you my honest opinion on this game.

The good:
+ Quests
You don't get many ""choices that matter"" but you do get a lot of quests overall. 
The quests will tell you vastly different stories, but shamefully many of them are repetitive where most quests usually make you go to an area and kill all the enemies, or gather certain items for an NPC.

+ World-building
Each biome and town is different, with greatly varying people & motives.
As for the different biomes, they're lacking interesting enemy/animal types and underground variety that would make them stand out more. Also, this game has no water (yet?), which is a disappointment

+ RPG mechanics
I want to compare it to Runescape, and I can tell the devs clearly took inspiration from it, but I wish they did it  with more intent. As the game is right now, you only level profession/crafting skills, and your character's level. 
As for the combat skills, when you get character levels, you will get a talent point to spend on any different skill tree of your choosing. 
You can level your character through everything, be it quests, mining, crafting etc, and you can even get talent points by collecting certain materials. (Found from specific enemies or when finding secrets)
Practically everything will build towards your characters level, which sort of ruins it a little because it's extremely easy to over-level yourself just by mining and crafting, quckly turning the combat too easy.

+ Music
There's not a lot of it, but all of it is pretty good.
Sometimes it reminds me of ""Fable"" but that might be stretching it.

The bad:
- Effects
The particle/skill effects look very out of place and extremely simple, 
I think it would fit more with the aesthetic of the game if they were pixel sprites. 

- Combat
As I mentioned earlier, the combat is way too easy and simple, especially if you want to take your time and do everything before you progress to the next zones. Doing this will very easily over-level you and remove all difficulty.
So far, in my 28 hours of playing this game (at this time) I have not faced a single enemy, trap, boss or quest that got me killed, mostly that's because I've always been over-leveled, but also because most enemies and hazards just don't hurt you at all. I'm currently playing a Fire mage with 90% cloth armor on and even that protects me so well that I've NEVER used a single health potion. At worst, the enemies are so weak that I don't even need to avoid them, at best, they'll take 1/8th of my HP but they die in 2 seconds without me even having to be anywhere near them.
If you specialize in to a tanky warrior build and take heavy armor, some of the armor pieces will grant you massive health regeneration stats that can make you invincible even if you stood still in front of a flamethrower trap or a cyclops smashing you with all it's might. It's absurd.

- Leveling
Currently, you level up your character and gain talent points, and with talent points, you can learn anything without a teacher. Essentially, you could play as a warrior for the entire time, and then suddenly just spend all your talent points on a magic skill tree and instantly become a wizard with no build up or learning - many games do this, but in this case I would wish it to be more fitting to the old-school-RPG style like Elder Scrolls games or Runescape that this game takes inspiration from.

- Artstyle
It has decent attention to detail in many things but it doesn't stand out or look unique compared to other similiar graphics 2D mining/crafting games.
At the moment, I like the more darker visuals it has, but that's about it, as far as the actual art goes, I think Starbound has most games of this genre beat, even if it fails in many other fields.

Overall, I would rate this game 7/10 at it's current stage in development (This was written on 17th of February, 2021)
I'm being overly critical, but that's only because I like what it has so far and I wish to see it get better.
It is an early access game, so anything could happen.
I do recommend the game, but regardless I wouldn't recommend buying it just yet unless you REALLY want to play it before it's finished.
I've seen too many early access games just stop updating, which is incredibly disappointing and rude towards all fans and customers.

I had it on my wishlist for a couple of years but held back from purchasing due to previous reviews regarding the early access bugs and gameplay.
I saw that a large update occurred last December and reviews had improved so along with the Steam 30% discount I jumped into game a few days ago.
I have had 40 hours of RPG infused Terraria styled gameplay. My OCD levels have been thoroughly put to the test with the base building elements and the progression levelling of the crafting system is enjoyably addictive.
This game reminds me more of a lesser known game called Planet Centauri and I really like that game as well.
Regarding the various negative reviews on here the reader must acknowledge the date of said review as since I have been playing this week February 2021 I have found nothing to back up the majority of former negative reviews and make the assumption that the devs have utilised the open access period to great effect and have clearly listened to the feedback from players.
The quests may be boring to some but they are often a way to kickstart or promote the players professions.
The 'hidden' secrets in each quested locations range from the damn obvious to the 'hidden in plain sight' and several of them will leave the player feeling really satisfied when they finally work out how to get to them. I am so pleased there is not yet a guide to spoil these.

I have not discovered any bugs yet and certainly not anything gamebreaking.
However 1 item of armour (Cave Dweller Helmet) and a melee weapon (Infernal Kobold Dagger) did drop from a mob very,very early in game and are far too OP to be used by such a low level and with no level requirements for items ingame these negated all same slot player crafted items for at least the next 25 levels. 

The autosave can create a slight judder when it kicks in and the timer for autosave can be set to whatever you wish.
Yes death is permanent so nurture that autosave feature.
The combat is rather clunky for melee but I am a caster type and found the mix-n-match feature of class roles a nice touch.
My fire based caster works really well with addded necro skelly summons at his beckon.
You can assign an extra 5 combat options to each of the left and right mouse buttons but only ever have 2 'active' at any moment. This is different to most games in that they let you click the selection from a hotbar but once you get used to changing the assigned actions with the mousewheel it really is not an issue and my caster summons skellies then flamethrows them to place debuffs and then fires fireballs and then resummons skellies all very quickly and easily.
Some tweaking is required to the XP generation as currently you gain character XP at level up points of professions. On lengthy crafting sessions you can gain a whole level or more of character XP at present and it does seem a bit too much.
There is no issue regarding storage of mats and armours as the vast crafting menu has so many available options for containers.
Is there anything more satisfying in this genre of games than the destruction of once stubborn blocks now disintegrating with your self crafted upgraded pickaxe? ... love it.

The discord community is a decent one and have already helped me with a building placement issue I had.
Lots of helpful advice on the Discord and no unhidden spoilers either.

Best tip I can give new players is to map the toggle for Build menu/Combat menu to the middle mouse button.
That was a game changer for me as fumbling between digging and then casting was a struggle.

TL:DR Spelunking fun with RPG infused questing, OCD driven base building, leaps of faith and spiked pits.

By accident, I saw the game on my Steam list, and thought 'what was that one?' - As I had nothing much to do - reinstalled and gave it another chance. Man, am I glad I did! The game as it stands now is totally transformed. As many have mentioned - this is Terraria with RPG - a match made in heaven. 
Where there was little to do - there is now a full game - quests, full crafting and a much expanded world. 

I have been waiting for something to come close to Terraria (a game I love and have played to death), this not only comes close, but (IMO) has exceeded it on many counts. The graphics are better, the gameplay is more rewarding and having some sort of story takes this sort of game to a new level.

It's a simplistic Skyrim-esque type game when it comes to how it handles leveling up, looting, and questing. It has Minecraft/Terraria type building mechanics. While not groundbreaking (and not as deep as Terraria's), the option to have a sense of creative freedom is always nice. Though it is entirely unnecessary. There are no monsters assaulting your base, day or night. Character progression wise, there is no reason to do it. You need storage and workbenches of various types. But other than that, you can live outside without building a house at all if you wanted to. As a side note, the map is quite large. Though the scenery is quite repetitive for the most part. Especially underground. 

As of this time of writing, the game is unbalanced in several areas. Depending on your choice of gear and abilities, you can VASTLY outclass other less informed players. One-shotting pretty much everything past a certain point. I will say that I haven't tried to make a pure magic build because of how ugly the magic looks. What magic I have unlocked has not been satisfying to use. There is no sense of impact or power to it and visually it's an eyesore, to be truthful. 

I can't overstate how much this reminds me of Skyrim. It was clearly an inspiration to this game.

Altogether I'd say it's surprisingly solid. A pretty good mix of Terraria/minecraft/etc. and heavier RPG elements, which is something I've always felt was missing from those games.

I think this game could be pretty solid - the art style is a little hit or miss, some character faces and such just look.. ridiculous.. And some of the quests and dialog are just the usual low-quality humor nonsense that seems a good deal too common in the indie scene.

There's a bit of quirkiness with some stuff - running is kinda finnicky and you lose momentum mid-air when jumping after a sprint if you run out of stamina. 

If they add more stats/variety to armor/weapons, some special effects, secrets, spruce up things a bit in general, this could be a solid title.

I also personally love how there are actual skill ratings for crafting that unlocks stuff and how there is a MIX of procedural and non-procedural content. Dungeons and towns and such are hand-made, but any other square on the 'world map' you can visit and seems procedural, which is where you can gather materials, hunt, and build your own house or whatnot. It's more fun to me than having to constantly refer to wikis or spoilers due to simply obtuse recipes that aren't about discovery but moreso blind experimentation in a half dozen different crafting stations.

The only downside is I didn't really realize this was early access because I bought it a while back so I started to get into it a bit only to realize it's not finished and I personally prefer to play games through as I find it hard to play a while, stop, come back, and resume - much less start over.

The most recent update added some much needed gameplay mechanics with a cool way of unlocking each province as you go through the main storyline (which is pretty fun and dramatic at times). Despite being in early access, I've had hours of fun running around and leveling up my character.

The sound effects are as addictive as minecraft and there's a fair variety of building parts. The non sandbox zones are all beautifully designed with interesting puzzles. Not what I'd consider the most challenging if you pick the right talent points and can be a tad grindy at times when crafting resources, but really isn't too bad in either regard. Whilst the mining aspect can be time consuming for rare ores, you can run across the odd chest and stronger creature in the caves (even in sandbox zones).

Even with all the problems that i have with the caster build i think still is the most fun since melee feels boring maybe later after picking some talents gets more good but for now feels boring i only use when i run out mana. Another thing i notice about the talent trees is that they look big but most talents are useless or is not a major change since for example the fire talent tree most talents are %10 more damage is not a big increase even after they give you %10 few more times since the base fire ball damage is 15 and even the necro talent tree feels boring since most talents early levels are about +5 secs to make the pet last longer or some health buffs. Another problem i feel the game has i haven't tested on late game maps but i seen the enemies don't respawn after i kill them i think it takes the danger level away after building a base/house in a sandbox map also the maps feel kind of small i also wish i could invite npcs so far i know i can build buildings for farm animals but i not sure about npcs i haven't seen anything not even a trader if i want to sell anything i need to go to visit the town npcs.

I recommend the game since most people will find it fun i think the game has potential after early access but i think the game still missing the Terraria fun level even if it has more RPG elements or other game play mechanics and the reason i didn't get this game before is because most game updates are Beta updates and i didn't see post about regular game updates so i wasn't sure what version of the game i was buying since in order to get into a Beta/Unstable version of the game they force you to use Discord in order to get it unlock I think they need to remove the need to use Discord or don't mix the regular update with Beta update news since it keeps potential buyers away.",1606553329,1606553329,True,5,0,0.564547240734100342,0,True,False,True,False,,,

RoM is a bit like starbound but set in a ""medieval"" world which i ,personally, prefer. the game has a nice variety of main quests as well as sidequests that tell the story of the game. where it differs from your games like starbound and terraria is in its leveling up which make it more like an RPG. currently the dev'S are overhauling the skilltree in an open beta which you can already play if you own the game.

you have your stable RPG skills like frost,fire,nature and necromancy on top of a nice 2 different skilltrees for melee as well as general stats.
gear matters,pieces and weapons have a variety of enchantments that will help your build without making you a total god.

the map so far is quite big with currently 4 regions available to explore. each region has different enemies,new materials for crafting,farming and cooking. so exploration is encouraged even if you just want to build. which brings me to my favorite part...building stuff :)

there is a nice variety of blocks,furniture,lightsources,clutter and so on already in the game to help you ease your creative itch. its not perfect and you will be somewhat limited in terms of making your builds unique but iam sure more is to come.

I am on the beta but so few has been done and major bugs persists even if some new content is being released.

that said - I don't regret a penny! I actually like that this is not another 200 hours crafting game time sink. every level, every talent point spent, every new equip,.. all those you immediately feel and they have impact. if you (like me) hate those games where you are leveling and improving equip yet do not feel any real difference, this is not that king of game. leveling and crafting of equip feels very rewarding

fighting system takes a little time to get used to, but once you do it's really nice a not unnecessarily complicated. fight are not easy, but it gets better with better equip and talents

quest are simple but fun anyway. some of them will take you around a map a little so you have a reason to look at those places. travelling on map takes no time, so it does not feel like a chore. travelling on the single map place (map is divided to many small squares and each square is single place tens of screens wide) can take some time before you get, where you want to be. but even this can get much better with right talents

besides quest there is separated guide book, which will take you through basics. eventhough it's really intuitive and you would find most things without much problems

you improve your character in two ways. first of them is by spending talents points. for each level up you get one (after those 20 hour I'm somewhere like level 58). you get experience for levellign by killing, finishing quest or crafting - that's right by crafting. I actually got most of my levels through the exps gained by crafting. each talent point can be used to gain single talent in large talent tree (that is divided in some ~8 areas). each talent spent is important and you feel the result immediately. like 1 block higher jump or +15% to attack damage

second way to improve you character is by ""doing crafting"". there is around 15 or 20 crafting types and each is leveled by crafting items of that type. with increasing level in that type of crafting you unclock new recipes when crafting items of that type. most types are fully unlocked somewhere around 80 crafting level. the level by itself even make crafting a little bit faster. I've smelting somewhere around level 120 at the end. each crafted item adds to a bar of it's type of crafting levelling. when new level in any crafting type is achieved you get some experience for it (for character levelling). this way you may amass even more character levels then through combat

I haven't found a single bug in those 20 hours of gameplay. actually the game feels really polished. if only half of the finished games would be only half as polished as this one, it would be great

last but not least - you can save in traditional way. what's even bere - you can choose number of saves for rotating quick saves and auto saves",1594805087,1594805169,True,3,0,0.504319965839385986,0,True,False,True,False,,,

One went like; dude wants to impress girl. Do three fetch quests and then a funny cutscene plays out and you can talk to them afterwards about what went right or wrong with the quest. It's not revolutionary, but I like it.

When I first saw the trailer, I figured it was just going to be another Terraria clone like Starbound. Which in itself, isn't a bad thing, but not what I was in the mood for. But after reading the top review on the game that went into all of the reasons why it's not a Terraria clone, I was sold.

 Like it said, about the only thing similar to Terraria is the house building. Otherwise, it's more of an action RPG where you gain XP specific to whatever activities you do most. Like, you level up your tree cutting by cutting down trees, mining by digging out blocks and mining ore, which is much less tedious than in other Terraria games. Even the storage system is more forgiving as you can increase the number of storage bags you can use. Which allows potentially for a couple hundred storage slots. And you're able to do so fairly early on in the game. There's a lot of flexibility in terms of what kind of character you want to make. You can focus on magic AND physical attacks, or stamina etc etc. For so early in the development, the game is quite vast and varied. It's not common I find a game of this caliber.

 I've already sunk 20+ hours into it like it's nothing and I can see myself sinking at least a couple hundred more hours into it easily. The only down side is now I have less time for other games. But it's just the thing if you're looking for something to do during this lockdown. At this rate, it'll be done and overwith before I know it thanks to this game.

 Even the $18 price tag is more than fair given the amount of content in this game. Especially after the last update. I admit, the quests are a bit dull so far. But have improved somewhat with the new version. There was one part where I accidentally sold a quest item and was unable to get it back, so that I was unable to complete the quest, but the quest remains in my journal. So I'm kinda stuck with that. But that's no longer a problem with the update.

 My only other problem is any time I try to Google anything about the game, I end up getting crap about some Sims 4 expansion with the same name, or other games that are irrelevant to this. But I guess a lack of online material is to be expected with a game so early on in its life. And has nothing to do with the overall quality of the game itself. It's just not something I've had an issue with before.

 I'll just end this by saying, even if the devs abandoned any more work on the game at this point, I would be satsisfied with it. But to the contrary, they've announced they're taking more time with the latest update to make sure it's as polished as possible. So it sounds like they're really putting their all into this. I can't state enough how highly I recommend this game.

[edit] Since the new update has come out, the game is MUCH bigger. There's a lot more in terms of quests and they're a bit more varied. Although a lot of them, at least in the early game consist of either fetching something or clearing enemies from an area. I would like to see more variation on the quests in the future. But it's not really a huge deal.

I'm really glad they took their time with this update, as it definitely shows. Despite a few spelling and grammatical errors, you can tell they put a lot of work into the fine details.

 Thus far I have logged almost 110 hours on the game and it's still just as fun as it was when I first played it. Though I know another update's probably a long way off. I already can't wait for it. And I hope the devs take their time with it just as much (or more so) than with this last one.

Crafting is quick, easy, fun (or tolerable if you're a filthy casual) and is quite realistic. Doors need hinges and locks, tables need nailing together, etc.
Constant drive to craft more, more, more. New recipes are worth crafting. Very few things have no uses (all cups can be used to hold water!)
Farming is a little slow. Grass keeps growing on top of my crops. Have not had many crops ready to harvest as of yet. Likely am planning on editing thru XML.
Modding is stupidly easy. Poke numbers to your liking in the file the item exists in, [b]you're done![/b]
Workshop and patching system would be a great addon. I'd love to make mods that increase pickaxe speed/speed up crop growth etc.
Combat is genuinely stressful. You're insane if you don't panic when your health is low. Especially when you have no potions. It's super fast, reflex-based and high-stakes.

For now, though, whats there is good and shows promise, so I'd recommend it, certainly. 

The biggest problem with it at the moment is the fact that the best way to  get the highest tier equipment is to mine for it, which wouldn't be problem if mining in and of itself wasn't extremely tedious. I think the solution to this would be to add a skill tree for mining allowing the player to upgrade how many ores in a vein they can harvest at once, ultimately ending in harvesting the entire vein after mining one block. The skill tree could also include other passive abilities like the chance of harvesting multiple ores from a single block (like the fortune enchantment from minecraft) or adding buffs when mining ores/ discovering different types of ores (e.g. with the highest perk you'd have a low chance of finding mithril/cobalt from iron/copper). The skill trees are one of the biggest strengths of this game and I feel that they are under utilized for all of the professions there are in this game. 

I'm not saying that every profession should have a skill tree, but I think it only makes sense for some of them. Example: I can think of a handfull of perks for a farming based skill tree that merges agriculture, husbandry, and woodcutting. Alchemy and milling could make up a nice skill tree, and could possibly include a small set of perks for smelting. 

The cave update just came out last month and improved the game dramatically from when I first played the game, but I wish there were more ways to get into these caves and more to do with the items therein. I was really disappointed when I found I couldn't harvest any of the glowing crystals/mushrooms, building is a very important part of this genre and I didn't find much substance in that regard from realms, allowing the harvesting of decorative items like the crystals, adding more of those decorations, and adding more craftable decorations would help out a lot. I should note that, building wise, decorating is actively encouraged as it's one of the best ways to store clutter and ultimately makes your home look very nice, but there could stand to be more to make buildings stand out.

on the other hand, I think adding a house or a lot that you could purchase in town would make the town a lot more useful, I only stopped in town to drop off quests and sell to the vendor, which is probably what it was intended for, but with the RPG elements in this game, towns could be incredibly interesting. At the moment the towns are generic and the towns people react as if there is a reputation system (as far as I can tell, there isnt) and you're constantly mangling it. one moment the townspeople appluad me as a hero and the next they react to me with disgust. The shop keep tells me to get out of his sight before I talk to him then greets me as a friend! 
there are also a number of grammar and spelling errors, which I just wrote off as part of a weird occasional dialect, but I certainly wouldn't mind if they were fixed.

lastly, I'm certain that the devs have plans to expand the world map, which is great, because it felt a bit small, but I'd like if the travel feature was expanded, happening in sped up real time with occasional random encounters similarly to the first 2 fallout games handled travel. Adding mounts and carriages to speed up travel would add depth to the game and give gold more use, while random encounters would give more chances for experience and more reason to level up combat abilities and explore the world, making it seem bigger. At level 45 half of my levels were from smelting and a third were from quests.

I'm not expecting these changes soon, these things take time and this game seems to be a passion project, but it could be something to truly rival the likes of Terraria and Starbound, if not overcome them. I've played a handful of games from this genre and have over 1000 hours in Terraria, and this is the first game in the genre that I've played that I've felt could provide an experience as encapsulating as games like The Elder Scrolls or Fallout series.",1574183313,1574183313,True,4,0,0.519719421863555908,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Realms of Magic is a niche game. Set in your average low-magic fantasy setting, this action RPG lets you grind to your heart's content in a number of ways: you can gather, harvest, hunt, mine and chop resources from the wilderness, craft items, build houses or farms, explore dungeons and sell the efforts of your labor to NPCs. As you perform these activities, you acquire talent points for customizing your character and turning them into a warrior, a mage or something in-between.

Combat is fun whether you wield a sword or cast spells. You are required to dodge and time your attacks appropriately depending on the simple attack patterns of the enemy. Stamina and magic point management is important, so mindlessly spamming spells or attacks is not advisable unless you invest in resource generation and cost reductions. Other activities like husbandry or crafting are simple but engaging as well: you can plant seeds, harvest crops, turn produce into animal feed, shear or butcher animals, and cook using the fruits of your labor, among other things.

Realms of Magic suffers from a common ailment in early-access indie games: a lack of content and depth. The world features only two biomes, plains and forests, and they are based on the same tileset. There are some dungeons and quests that add content to the world, and some background lore to discover, but most of what the game has to offer can be experienced in the first two hours of gameplay. These issues are being tackled by the developers in a slow but steady manner, with each content update adding modest but well-designed changes, so this assessment may change in the future.

If you enjoy simple sandbox games where you grind for power and fortune or just for a nice-looking castle, this game is worth it even in its early-access state. I, for one, like it very much as it is.",1574116061,1574116486,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Realms of Magic is something incredibly special. The game is a clear cross between Terraria and the Elder Scrolls, but the emphasis of the game leans way more towards the Elder Scrolls. I say this because while the aesthetic and gameplay is that of Terraria, the premise, immersion, quest elements and UI resembles and Elder Scrolls like game.

I'm going to just point out things within the game instead of giving pros and cons and leave it up to those who read this to decide for themselves, whether or not, this game peaks your interest:

- In-game time system like that of the Elder Scrolls.

- You must ""Rest"" in a bed in order to pass time.

- Talent Tree Skill System

-  10 Playable Races
   (Humans, Wild Elves, High Elves, Dark Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, Goblins, Gnomes, LIzardmen, and Cursed.)

- Bag Slot Inventory System,

- Intricate Crafting System

   (Example: To make a door, you need Wood, Hinges, and Nails, not just wood)

- Simple Buffs and Debuffs

- Many potions for many things

- Farming in a 2D game that really works.

- Most of the NPCs have quests for you to take on

- the World is actually HUGE, and traveling is unique.
   (Example: You don't just keep moving left and enter a different biome. You must reach the end of your current area, and them press M to then move to the next Tile on the massive world map.)

- Vendor NPCs have their own amount of currency. Sell to much to them and they may run out of money.

And there is probably so much more I'm missing from here, but these are things I thought stood out.

It's only Alpha and there's already so much to offer and do in the game, and the price is definitely worth it. My hopes are high for this game and I believe the developers haven't even scratched the surface of what they'd like their finished product to be. If you're into these types of games, most definitely give this game a go. It's Elder Scrolls Sandbox 2D if you ask me.",1560958112,1560958112,True,3,0,0.507189154624938965,0,True,False,True,False,,,

All ""higher"" tier content, and especially dungeons you see on preview require quite prolonged grind to access.

All crafting hardgated and game forces you to craft thing you do not need and do not want, just to access next tiers.
You already have ""stone tools"", but game ""strongly advice"" to craft them again (and drop) just to get access to other crafting recipes.
This makes lower tier materials mandatory and higher tier materials locked behind grindwall.

Just imagine Minecraft that prevent you from crafting stone tools before you crafted wooden ones 20 times.
Then it prevents you from crafting iron tools before crafting stone ones 20 times...
Or early versions of Terraria that require all previous tiers of tools\weapons\armors to craft next ones.
Want iron armor? Kay, craft wooden, then tin, then copper, then bronze and only then iron armor.

Most satisfying is the leveling system. You have character level ups, then you have your skill level ups. There's crafting and building but neither is required. If it's more to your taste you can just buy or loot gear so you don't actually have to craft, build ect.

Updates seem to be fairly steady and overall gameplay isn't too bad either.

The game brings some differenct mechanics to the table - unlike Terreria with a long flat (not terrain) world or Starbound with a round world you can walk around, in this game you have sectors that you travel between using a map.  I wasn't sure I'd like this system, but find that I like it more than walking completely around a world as it makes the world feel much larger. Also, the way the zones are setup, you can even visit the empty areas on the map and find things to do.  Once you unlock signposts you can even travel right to your base instead of to the edges of that zone.

Right now magic seems limited (fire-based only?) and combat (melee and magic) feels really stiff, but the it isn't a dealbreaker - needs more balance and fluidity though.  Another thing that needs tweaking - you can't place potions into the combat hotbar, which seems rather odd as you have to switch back to exploration mode to then use them (unless I'm doing something wrong).

Progression seems slow initially, but I feel that this is actually a good thing in the long run.  Many games try to rush you through things and you end up unlocking all the craftables long before you even approach the endgame.  As for the craftables, it seems like it will be a rather decent number, but I haven't peeked at the items I haven't learned yet even though the game allows this.

Things are also very open ended - you don't need to follow a linear path on a timeclock to proceed.  There does appear to be some sort of individual story elements via NPC quests, but not sure if those come together later or not (UPDATE: I'm beginning to think that there isn't or isn't much of a story here - if you like to make your own then you should be fine, otherwise...).

One thing that is a limitation of 2D games in this genre - building multiple structures in a way that doesn't frustrate you.  Moving through towns requires opening doors, which you can leave open thereafter, but unless you build your own constructions on 'stilts' (ugly) or underground, things can interrupt your movement.  Fortunately I don't think this game has raids like in Terreria, so leaving the doors open appears to be fine for now.

For $10 this game appears to deliver quite a bit already and some other EA games with way less content and features are charging twice this amount.  You can enjoy the game for several hours now, but hopefully development will continue, combat will be tweaked, more features added, and this will end up being a nice addition to the genre.",1544037063,1544152504,True,1,0,0.503079891204833984,0,True,False,True,False,,,

That said, I just got hit by what I consider a game-breaking bug. I built two pine chests and unloaded all of my cloth and seeds into one of them and all of my hides into the other.

When I came back a day later, the chest with hides still had items in it, but the chest with cloth and seeds was now empty. I checked my autosaves (why does this game insist on creating a new autosave every time I load, anyway?) and from what I can tell, the chest contents disappeared shortly after I placed the items in it, possibly before I even left my base.

Crafting and accumulation of items is the heart of this game. If that doesn't work, everything else is pointless. Unfortunately, I can't request a refund anymore, but if I could, I totally would. Perhaps this will be a great game someday. As of today, however, I rate it ""hot garbage"".

It is one of my favorite games ever, the only thing beating it are giants like Mario Odyssey and various Zeldas. Well let’s get into the meat.

	The game has a great level system, getting a point or two every level to expand your talent tree. There are many options to flesh out your character. Character creation itself is pretty expansive, with a bunch of races and plenty of hairstyles and such. Your character is just plopped down after the tutorial, where admittedly it's a bit slow at the beginning, no execution or kidnapped sisters here, but that doesn’t exclude it from having a fantastic story. No, the story is great and a lot of the sidequests really bring everything full circle. Some quests are fetching food so the family won’t starve through winter while others are about taking out bandit gangs, which is a fantastic experience because of the combat system. The combat is snappy, yet realistically slow, it feels good to play. Well maybe it feels so good due to the epic jams by Tomasz Depczynski you listen to throughout. Your loot must go somewhere, so thats where base building comes in. Base building is intricate, with various furniture peices and the animal husbandry. I think more types ofblocks and such would be nice, but its well rounded. You could also sell the loot. Selling is decently put together, but most merchants aren't worth visiting.

Do you like Terraria more than Starbound? You will dislike this game then.

+ Terraria-like game.
+ Massive craft and many resources to gather.
+ RPG system with character level, professions levels, many skills.
+ Quests and many dialogues.
+ Big upgradable inventory.

- Skills are not motivating, some skills offer a slight boost, but can't really catch up with rising of the difficulty in a new act.
- Hybrid builds are barely possible due to lack of skill points and each skill tree passives boos only that tree.
- No synergies, e.g. earlier summons become absolutely useless and waste of point later on.
- Poor combat system, it just doesn't fit, melee feels too clunky and on higher zoom kind of hard, summons AI is really terrible, enemies will agro through walls, etc.
- Poor balance: many game mechanics left unbalances in certain tier branches.
- Way too much of ""protected"" zones, in Starbound this was mainly used for boss fights, here the whole quest chain progress through such zones. Sandboxes zones (where you can build and destroy) are non-interesting, feels as not fitting aspect. After completing a game it feels not like Terraria, rather like some sort of Metroidvania. Not what I expect or enjoy.
- Later in game level designs begin repeating self, sure it's a whopping number of handmade levels, but seeing same 2 cave entranced with exit door inside not so wide map is .. boring.
- Poor crafting UI, workbench is a scroll-hell, the crafting stations can't remember last recipem, nor filters, constant scrolling, too few filters, useless categories..
- Too many rapidly jumping enemies, they are not hard, they are annoying. Either a spellcaster who can jump half-screen away or a warg charging 3 times in a row.
- Bugs: a lot of bugs, breaking bugs, bugs preventing you from getting achievements,soft-locking bugs, even auto-save system is buggy and unusable.
- Game offer just one (!) fight with the boss mechanics. Whole game is filled with dozen elites, which are basically meaty versions of other bosses, sometimes with unique model..
- No official wiki. For a game of this scale with thousands of items, npcs, locations, etc. official wiki is a must have.
- Useless notes with hits to find secrets.
- ""The Library"" endgame quest which require you to bring several books, which aren't marked as quest, can't be crafted, are easily sold as a crap to npcs and don't appears to be respawnable/lootable.
- Enemy shouts (looks like huge tooltips floating above for quite some time) will obscure vision, no way to distinguish enemy from own summon, one-shotting attacks of certain enemies without a way to avoid them, difficulty to see dangerous enemy in a crowd, huge packs of enemies in sandbox maps of last biomes... I can write and write small, but very annoying things, which makes this game feels very unpolished and poorly thought.

I was enjoying the start of the game, first 2-3 acts feels ok. But then I understand that would be the whole game like this: boring protected levels with boring stupid mobs, primitive secrets to find (it's fun only first few maps). Even quests at some point become not fun anymore, especially when you have to move between 2 locations back and forth dozens of time.

Compared to my first impressions when playing EA 4 years ago, the released version fails miserably. I was expecting middle-age Terraria with nice skills. But I got somewhat boring journey filled with repeatable and poorly balanced content, which still require years of polishing and bugfixes.

Not sure to whom recommend this game.


Below is my positive EA review Posted: 24 Jul, 2018 @ 9:34pm

---

For an alpha game offers quite a lot. 

It's not as good as Terraria or Starbound, but in my oppinion it easily beat any other Terraria-like game: Sign of life, Planet Centauri, Dig or die, Crea.

Starbound is the closest analogue, same system of locked maps (aka dungeons) and free-to-dig ones. Same map with huge amount of pretty big maps to explore.

Game mechanics is interesting: there are active skills, e.g. fireball and passive (+life, +fire damage, etc.), which are formed in a kind of skill trees in several categories (melee, magic, etc.). Sill points are granted on level-ups. Experience is gained for increasing craft level, completing quest or simply killing enemies.

Enemies are sparse and game is balanced towards challenging fight even against a single opponent. Pulling too many enemies may make the victory a hard job. The main quest line will will lead through the game, increasing in the difficulty.

As an alpha the game has many cons:
- AI is very bad and sometimes very annoying;
- Most of environment is a forest (biomes are not yet a thing);
- poor UI;
- loot is too generic;
- poor balance;
- mediocre skills: no variety, rudimental choices (e.g. increase inventory skills are must).

I have hope this game will make it to the release and  the release will be a comparable to what Terraria was 5 years ago.",1532460861,1659918046,False,0,0,0.457848817110061646,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Well, as a huge fan of Terraria-like games I couldn't pass this one. It is sure a complex and fun game that features such things as:
- Tradeskills (Your skills develop, as you use them)
- Complexity (If you want a table - wood is not enough. You need nails as well)
- Variety of characters (Not sure what those races do, but it's fun to know you can play as Goblin instead of puny human).
- Vast talent system (Looks amazing. Some of the perks give you movement speed, others = bag slots, combat damage, etc)

There are some things I didn't like: for example - wolves on early start won't lose you once they see you. Yep, they will follow you no matter what and kill you. If you run to your respawn point and die by wolf there - guess who'll meet you as you respawn? :)
Also, the digging/cutting/lumbering feels a bit slow (especially if you start to play after Starbound or similar game).

I've played just about 18 hours of the game as of writing the review, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the game play so far. 

What this game does right comes in the form of most of the game play -- the leveling skills and experience, talents, the interface, the general character movement, map exploration, NPC interactions, crafting, farming, and resource management, and so on. Even in its early stages, this game offers a lot to do, and frames the activities through character development and interaction with the world map. 

Where I would like to see development is in the options available in all of the noted elements of game play, as well as addressing the writing, sprite movement, combat AI, and the variability and size of the world map itself. Many of the issues that make the game clunky right now, though, are the result of this game being so early in its development. According to the developers' roadmap, most of the issues I have with the game are scheduled to be addressed, so if they stay committed to developing the game I see no reason why Realms of Magic wouldn't become a welcome addition to the Terrarria / Starbound / Stardew Valley community. Primarily, Realms of Magic offers a character development and progression experience that is only available in small form (or with mods) in other similar games.

What differs this game from tons of similar? 
1) Quests. No randomly generated stuff that is repetitive. Meaningfull nice quests with equally meaningfull backstroy. They aren't complex, but yet they give a nice flavor.
2) Map. You enter a little mini-zone from the map. You can find ruins or inhabitetd villages. You can choose one of those in the wilds and build your home there. A lot of ""squares"" await your visit

What I like in the game:
- pleasant art
- enjoyable music
- quests


What I dislike for now:
- combat - too slow, too weak armor, too big damage from enemies
- only one biome (devs have plans to add more)
- not much under the ground level (same as above)

edit: 30/1/20. game is improving and getting better


I messed up a bit and realised it was my error on what i thought was a bug which is why i had firstly put this up as not Recommended, but after more play throughi still  i can't recommend this game at the moment. 

if this game keeps up with its development this will be a Terraria beater in no time. 
it has a great amount of character customisation and judging by videos i saw the future is bright for this game

BUT it has a bit to go yet, underground is just digging, in 11hrs i have found no special areas or hidden rooms.

 Above ground is bland and to be honest rather boring you have about 6 or 7 areas u can go to that lead to a cave or dungeon on the map, but so far i have found nothing else in any of the open unprotected areas


Pros:

Nice Graphics although not amazing
the Tool slots are a great idea
character Creation is indepth
skill trees are good touch


Cons:

digging 1 block at a time is seriously boring 
some bugs (but it is Early access)
had to change from Fullscreen because my screen went pink (fix posted by Developers)
Basic Design, underground is just digging nothing special has been found so far in 10 hrs of play, No special rooms or areas (it is EA though).",1520158455,1580409505,True,0,0,0.553496956825256348,0,True,False,True,False,,,

As of now, I've run out of new things to do, but I can see the potential for this game to be really great.

My hopes for this game as it develops - these may actually be in development already for all I know:

More random mobs, and regeneration of them.

Randomly generated underground areas (caves, ruins, monster dens, etc.)

A more scalable UI - as it stands, there's no happy medium for me - either the UI windows take up a large portion of the screen or they're so small that I can hardly identify their contents.

Areas with concentrated resources - instead of having some sand in every map area, have some beach or desert areas that are mostly sand. There are already forest areas, but really they're the same as all the other areas, but have a higher number of trees.

FISHING! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!

Make harvesting as easy as planting - unless I am missing something, harvesting is very tedious and unless you want to take a long time doing  it, it requires some very fast keyboard mashing. If I am missing something that makes it easier, will someone please let me know?

A bit more of a controls tutorial - for a very long time, I didn't know how to rotate a placeable asset, like a door. For those wondering, just press ""E"" while the asset is attached to your cursor, before placing. On that note - more rotatable assets, too.

Skills trees for crafting in which you can use talent points.

The game still has a lot of planned content to be added, and I imagine most of my wish-list is either under consideration, under development, or already discarded.

Whatever the case, this game is really good already. The finished product should be a real gem.",1519490116,1519490116,True,7,0,0.567275881767272949,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Игровой  процесс  схож  с  перечисленными  выше  играми  плюс  набор  опыта,  навыки  и  прокачиваемые  профессии.  На  данном  этапе  возможности,  конечно,  сильно  ограничены,  но  разработчик  в  своей  путеводной  карте  расписывает  всё  очень  уж  шоколадно  и  хотя  бы  не  заблуждается  в  своих  возможностях,  отводя  нахождению  игры  в  Раннем  Доступе  порядка  трёх  лет.  Если  он  сможет  реализовать  хотя  бы  большую  часть  задуманного  это  будет  отличная  игра,  если  нет…  что  ж  на  то  он  и  Ранний  Доступ.  Лично  я  предпочитаю  надеяться  на  благополучный  исход.

Но  вернёмся  к  нашим  баранам,  то  есть  версии  0.2.3.  Что  нам  предложено  конкретно  на  данный  момент  времени?  Для  начала  богатый  выбор  рас  из  фэнтези,  уже  неплохо,  хотя  какого-либо  влияния  они  пока  не  оказывают,  кроме  симпатичного  пиксельного  внешнего  вида  остроухих  эльфиек.  Далее  следует  первое  подземелье-обучение,  и  тут  замечаются  такие  вещи  как  присутствие  шкалы  выносливости  кроме  здоровья  и  маны,  а  также  сражения  с  монстрами,  используя  блоки  и  силовые  удары.  Если  заглянуть  в  дерево  умений  можно  увидеть  там  же  перекаты,  двойные-тройные  прыжки,  финты  и  прочие  интересные  вещи  и  это  с  учётом  того,  что  развитие  персонажа  представлено  пока  в  сугубо  базовом  виде,  только  одноручное  оружие  и  пассивки  на  увеличение  показателей  (обещано,  разумеется,  много  больше).

Пройдя  обучение,  оказываемся  на  относительно  небольшой  локации.  Тут  есть  деревья,  родники,  волки,  куры  и  широкий  простор  для  подземных  работ.  Начинаешь  копаться  и  разбираться,  а  потом  неожиданно  выясняется,  что  есть  глобальная  карта  и  она  немаленькая.  Если  в  других  подобных  играх  мы  перелетали  с  планеты  на  планету  или  переключали  миры,  то  тут  можно  просто  подойти  к  границе  начального  района  и  отправиться  в  путешествие.  Пусть  большинство  локаций  от  стартовой  ничем  особенно  не  отличаются,  но  тут  уже  имеется  десяток  пещер,  подземелий,  фортов  и  деревенька,  в  последней  к  слову  выдают  простенькие  задания  с  намёками  будущего  сюжета.

Не  забыт  и  ручной  труд,  множество  станков  и  рецептов  по  которым  мы  привычно  проходим  путь  от  каменного  топора  к  полной  металлической  броне  и  большому  тесаку.  Персонажа  регулярно  требуется  кормить  и  поить  во  избежание  негативных  эффектов.  В  наличие  смена  дня  и  ночи,  а  также  возможность  брать  в  дополнительную  руку  осветительный  факел,  который  не  мешает  драться  или  копать.  Садоводство  в  наличии,  готовка  имеется,  открытые  водоёмы  с  рыбалкой  пока  только  обещают.

Прокачка  профессий  это  как  стоило  ожидать  не  просто  циферка  в  статистике,  это  ускорение  создания  соответствующих  профессии  предметов  и  новые  рецепты,  что  смотрится  логично  и  поэтапно.  Вот  лично  мне  интересно  разбираться  в  таких  производственных  мелочах  и  цепочках  –  очистил  площадь  от  сорняков,  прошёлся  по  ней  тяпкой,  посадил  джут,  дождался  созревания,  собрал  и  сделал  из  него  на  прялке  текстильное  волокно,  а  уже  потом  пошил  одежду  на  другом  станке.  И  точно  также  дела  обстоят  и  со  многими  другими  вещами.

Из  отрицательных  моментов,  что  я  успел  заметить  –  при  смерти  (а  волки-троглодиты-медведи  тут  злющие  для  одетого  в  тряпью  героя)  выпадает  весь  инвентарь  и  горячая  панель  (экипировка  не  выпадает).  Из-за  этого  приходится  каждую  смерть  заново  расставлять  выпавшие  вещи,  что  раздражает.  Также  не  хватает  панельки  со  статистикой  параметров,  где  можно  было  бы  посмотреть  броню,  урон,  скорость  бега,  регенерации  и  прочее.  Ориентироваться  пока  приходится  “по  приборам”  и  понять:  почему  кожаная  одежда  с  меньшей  защитой  ценится  больше  чем  оловянная  решительно  невозможно.

Awesome user experience. 

* There is a general ""tool"" slot. If it is equiped the character uses the axe on trees, shovel on ground, pickaxe on rock and so on without having to switch between the different tools all the time.

* You can stack multiple food of the same time on the food slot and the character will eat it when hungry. You don't need to manually have the character eat something when hungry like you have to in Starbound.

No jogo você precisa comer e beber, a fome não desce tão rápido, somente quando você leva dano e a fome é reduzida para você se recuperar, pode usar poções também, a sede aumenta quando você exagera na stamina, o jogo tem um mapa estilo mario world onde tem vários locais para se visitar, vilas, castelos e etc...

Não tem multiplayer no momento mas é algo que será implementado futuramente.

You already know the form. You explore and craft and collect and build. Add to the mix quests and you have a real RPG feel to a standard side-scroller.

Music is a plus. More often than not I find the childlike tinkling to be very annoying. This has a more ""epic"" quest sound track, not annoying in the least.
EDIT - need more and varied tunes

The graphics are very good for the most part. It is the animations that could use some work. Walking is not an issue but use of any tool or weapon and you're watching your character windmilling their arm in circles.
It's a rather poor movement. 
EDIT - the more I play the less I care about this.

And THAT is the worst of the issues with the game - which is to say there are no real drawbacks.
It does not have enough content. No magic yet. (THIS IS NO LONGER TRUE with 0.30) Which is easily excused as EA.
(Give them time)

I own Terraria and Starbound and never felt the draw the way I do with this one.

All of my negatives have been acknowledged by the devs and it sounds as though they are being addressed.
(As archery is added the animations are being revised)

Two thumbs up.

Edit - Unreal engine? Wow.

Edit 0.30 Magic rears its head. The changes are huge...an order of magnitude. The stack option in your inventory is just the sort of thing that can make a stinky game better and this being a good game...this pushes it towards great.
The map has be trebled in size.

And after mining & crafting my way up to level 14 I finally ventured out to a nearby village. Within minutes I had several quests.

Most were simple. 
The lumber mill man needed 100 pieces of wood.
The poor woman asked for food.
Another wanted a group of wolves cleared out of the area.

I still have an encounter with a powerful Orc pending as well as a request for a claw of a bear, or was that a danish?

This is too much fun.

It is simpler and cleaner on the outside but has some depth inside.
The devs have a long road they have laid out and I can't wait to see it fulfilled.

First time when i play this game got a bug and i can say the developer fixed in few days after added me on steam to let me know the game is fixed. First time to see a game developer to be this way!

My new review of this game is 11/10 very fun game and now i can see if i have any more bugs with this game i can let the developer know and the issue will be fixed faster.

................................

The game is fun, i play few hours and i can say was fun. BUT i have a quest to go Wood City and from that city im getting other quest to kill some chickens so i plan to go forest ( using M ) when i select to go forest the game minimize and the game die, very bad bug ... after i close the game and i try to load the game from save file, the save file is telling me my character is human now but i select elf class, when i load the save file is auto minimize the game and crush.

I lost few hours of farming and set up my base ... how i understand this issue is from so long time but the developers didn't fix it even till now ( i just got the game today )

Don't buy this game till they don't fix the bugs.

ooo - ooo When I do a review, even when it's on the top like this one, most of the time when I update or make changes, sadly it was because I had to warn people away from a title for many a reasons. I'm glad to say, this is not why I am updating this review. I'm updating it, because there is a lot more information I feel is necessary for the people planning on buying this title to know. It's the type of information that I feel can make or break someones decision. So you don't have to read everything all over again, just look at the reply section because I can't fit the additional inforamtion here.  

***** When Early Access games like this come out, the first thing that comes to mind is how buggy is it, and will it end up like edge of space, is it a Terraria or Spacebound clone, or even worth the $9.99 price tag. After tearing the game up, and looking at the raw data like I do with just about every game I review, the only thing I cant say is if it will become abandoned like many others in the past. What I can say, and basically no one else knows, except the writers itself, is after looking at the content, the $9.99 price their asking right now is a complete joke. Even if they raise the price, and trust me when this is complete, they most likely will, not even $29 would be enough. I can guarantee many are going to beat themselves over the head if/when this gets complete for nor buying into the game when it was only $9.99. Why is this? Read on.....
***** When I looked into Edge of Space to find out why information was never posted in the forums and tore its data files apart, I found 80% of the content missing. I did similar with Realms of Magic, and when I did, I realized, this game unlike the others, has 80% of the content already entered. What they gave us to play with, while they remove bugs is just maybe 5% of the game. The rest, is locked out. For me to list what I have seen, would ruin  it for many, including the developement team who is working hard to get a fully working game out and most likely want to release portions of the game or decide what else to unlock, remove, or even add. 
***** The developement team made it clear, this is a one player game, and their concentration, is to work the bugs out for now, and decide later if they want multi-player. This I will say. If there were no plans for multi-player, why is it the program asked for firewall access? Steam already has permission. The type of permission the game asked for is the type a game server needs. For all I know, its their own patching server, or possibly a test to see how the game works through the internet. I havent fully checked the connections, you will have to decide on that part.
***** For the $9.99 price tag, the game is worth that price for what it already contains, which are a lot of quests, some bugs, but still extremely more playable than EOS ever was. The company who made Realms Of Magic, didn't release anextremely buggy game. They did their work, did a lot of teasting, more so than I can say many other companies have. They for now are using a small map, but from the hidden and locked content I have seen, there is so much more to come. ***** The only thing that would disapoint me about this game, is if they never put it in the workshop. So much can be done to expand the game should they do this. Even without there being a workshop now, I was able to mod this game and have it do things for me no one else has access to. The game is very user firendly and edditing your characters stats prior to starting  the game if you so choose to is so easy, it can be done just using wordpad as each stat and skill basically  says what it is when viewing the files.
*****  Lets talk about game play. If you have played Ultima Online, you would feel right at home with this game. Not only does this game have a very similar skill base, like mining, fighting, blacksmithy, it levels up each skill much faster than the long and boring way of UO. Even the stat set of HP, Stamina, Mana, is similar. Remember those days of dying and having to run back to your corpse to find the dragon or other monster sitting on your corpse making it extremely difficult to get your STUFF back? This happens in Realms of Magic as well! The only parts of this game so far that is missing is multi-player and GMs telling you ""Sorry, I can not help thee...."" Building better weapons or even better houses requires you to get skills like blacksmithy, carpentry, mining, and smelting up, and it's extremely fast too. You don't even have to get your skills to 100 to be able to craft the best. 60% covers just about everything in game and as I said above, you level up extremely fast. 
***** Leveling is extremely simple. Everything you do in game basically has a skill hooked to it, and every time those skills go up, you get points that help your character to level up and gain yourself more HP, Stamina, Mana. You get to decide where it goes.  
***** The music is fantastic. It brings you back to the days of how music in RPGs used to be, like FInal Fantasy and the early Ultimas (Not the online versions). 
***** The tutorial wasnt some quickly pieced together piece of garbage that no one can understand. The Tutorial obviously was put together with a lot of time and care, and just about completely flawless. Just like youd expect of a MMorpg, except this is an RPG. You can choose when making your character to bypass the totorial, but why bother? The tutorial is not only extremely fun where even I have made multiple characters just to find special hidden rooms, but also get items you either cant get till much later in game, or cant get at all unless you play the turtorial. You start out in a cave and must work your way out, with a narrator spelling out what you must do and at the right time when you need that information, not 20 minutes early and expect you to remember it.  
***** If this game were to be abandoned tomorrow, I can easily say it was worth the $9.99. Dont expect this game to be in the bargain bin any time soon like the others with 90% coupons and 50 cent price tags. The price obviously is going to go up, so do yourself a favor and get it now before you berate yourself later when its $29+!
***** The only bad review this game got so far is by someone who thought it was fun to jump into a saw blade to see what would happen and said autosave got him. I'll tell you now, most likely autosave did not get him. He more than likely clicked the (x) which as a safety feature had he looked says that will save the game before closing it, so if you dont want something to save, I highly suggest ctrl-alt-del and end task it. Thats what I did because hehe, I did the same exact thing =P
***** Lions and Tigers, and Bears, Oh mY! Oh wait, there is no Lions or Tigers, at least not yet. There are some nasty bears, so make sure you wear plenty of armour!!! Maybe I should have marked this one as a spoiler?
***** The game is so good, you can actually not realize how much time has gone by, unless you have a kitty like I do. My wifes cat has the habbit of getting between me and the keyboard when I been on the pc too long >_<
***** This is the type of game that people like myself years back had to wait months on a waiting list just to buy the game and right now you can get it without the wait!
***** Right now there is no storyline but there are a decent amount of quests plus the ability to build your home the way you want to with no limit to size and that includes height! Boy, if they put physics into the building laws, my place is definately going to fall!
***** The only similarities between Starbound and Terraria are the house building, but thats where it ends. Everything else, is quite different. This game was released December 6th of 2017 and for it to be an EA title that is this good, in a long time is quite shocking!

Really enjoying the leveling system, those perks...gotta love the triple jump.  Only 16 hours in right now.

If you like 2d sandbox games, this is a worthy title in the genre.  Very good value for money.  I really like the titles that come out cheap at the start, then increase as they add more content.   Makes me feel like they believe in their product, but at the same time, understand value for money.  Well worth the curernt asking price...even if they stopped today, I feel like i got my moneys worth.

Now the ramble, what I like, what I hope for in the future, and what I'd like to see improved:
Combat.  Now while i've only seen about 4 or 5 main archetypes for enemies, they all feel varied in their combat style.  I also really like spoiler: [spoiler]Enemies run away when hurt.  However you can create a trap for the animals, so they can't escape from you by making a pit two tiles high on either side...while they will jump in, they can't get out.  If this is currently a bug, then they should leave it, or make animals not regen health and run unlimited (bears/boars/deer) away from you.  If it's not a bug, then I love having to trap them to actually kill them.[/spoiler]

I'd love to see more enemy archetypes.  Also, would love to have a range of difficulty, so that maybe as I go further away from home base, the enemies become harder, have more abilities, etc.  Not sure i'm a fan of just having enemies leveling with you and making every zone feel the same.  I'd rather see new enemies, in new zones.

Also, no bosses yet, hope thats a thing.  Maybe I just haven't gotten far enough?

Leveling: So many places to put talents, although when i saw triple jump, had to dump all my points into it first.  Now while they have the standard, give xx armor, health, etc...i love that they have some for non-stat based as well which are fun to get, but you give up others places to spend.  

That being said, the standard ones don't really feel worth it.  10 extra points in any one of them don't seem all that big a deal.  The 50 extra armor points to me didn't feel like they helped at all.  

I instead would like to see them remove all the stat increases to health/energy/mana/armor in the talents, and instead just have them as part of the gear.  Maybe like gear that could be enchanted?  New profession maybe?  Also health/energy/mana should just rise from each main level gained I feel.

Map: I love how when you exit side of map, you get a top down view of the world your in, and can go to any square.  I really hope int he future, this means new biomes, etc.  Especially since there is leveling, I hope it also means that there will be identifiable places to know where you should go and not feel under geared or level.

Crafting: Standard, and they have so much to craft.  If you enjoy crafting there are so many things to make.  Stations: Alchemy, cooking, leatherworking, tanning, weaving, furnace, anvil, and a couple others I forget their names.  Each profession has leveling associated with them.  Kind of skyrim style, as you level a profession, it also levels your main level, giving you talents/perks.

I'd love to see more placeables, and I do think the dmg/armor vs what you fight, needs more tuning as well.  Going up in gear doesn't seem like it does that much.  Also, some professions seem way easier to level than others.  Definitely needs balance.

Which brings me to animals.  Could be I haven't figured it out, but feels like sheep/chickens/non-violent animals should be able to be tamed, and farmed.  Maybe it already does and I haven't figured it out, but i don't thinkso.  Getting wool seems super hard since I can't seem to find many sheep.  And once you kill them, doesn't feel like there are respawns.

Mining: I like this and have found sofar there is a nice abundance of materials.  I hope this doesn't get nerfed, and I hope that later materials are as easily findable, but maybe at a lower depth.  If they do want to balance the rates, I hope they add in an option to increase/decrease the amount of available materials, because while it's fun exploring and finding, I don't want to feel like i'm playing mining simulator.  Also haven't found sofar that many caverns...would like to see this happen.  I'm only starting to go deep enough to get iron.  So not sure how much more there is sofar?

Tutorial/Guide:  Really liked how it gave an option to hit a key to see what you could start doing next.  Kind of like quests, something that you can either ignore completely and do what you want, or can use to learn mechanics.  Would like to see this keep going throughout.

Quests:  Like getting quests from the vilagers.  Would like to see more of these, more villages, etc.  Very fun.

And please please please: don't fix it so I can't do my flying farming area.  I don't want to have a wall/dirt attached everywhere.  I like that they're brightly lit in the day, because they just float there.  It brought me so much joy when I removed the sides and nothing fell down.  It's a game, and I like my vertical farm as it is.

There are only really two main complaints:
1) Bodies don't disappear.  Even if you leave map and come back, they are still there.  Currently I was using a chicken body to store materials, because I killed it in my base, and it's body is still there 4 days later.  Not to mention it has WAY more space than any item/crate I can make currently.
2) No respawns.  Animals.  Wool, is killing me, can't find sheep.  Killed the few on my land.  Maybe i'm missing something here.",1514336295,1514336295,True,5,0,0.545341014862060547,1,True,False,True,False,,,

Unlike Terraria, you level your character by doing basically anything from killing monsters, humanoids, animals to melt tin ore, make barrels and cooking yourself a meal. Currently it has a few bugs but remember it is early access and not done yet.

The battle can be a challeng but if you fight smart, use potions and perhaps even traps in dungeons to your advantage it can be quite fun.

Current world map is really small with one village, a few quests and a few dungeons releated to the quests.

In Dungeons and Villages what you can destroy is limited to a few types of rocks, trees and harvesting farm materials or herbs. In the Sandbox areas however you can go nuts, build what you want and destroy anything you want to destroy.

Since magic has yet to be added, (or I have yet to find anything) You can save yourself from increasing magic resistance, mana and so on for the time being at least.

Unique on its own. I love the skill trees/professions level. Blend of skyrim and RPG 2D. Is it worth it at this stage? Yeah I would say so. For 10$, and early access stage, it's incredibly well done. Not much bugs that I've encountered so far. Content wise, mmm it's pretty good for 10hours or so (if you venture/do dungeons), probably more if you just play super casually and build things.

Pros
+ skill trees, profession levels
+nice crafting
+combat is fun (granted in the beginning, you'll be constantly backing), you can roll, triple jump, power punch, blocking, ect. AND the upgrades for those skill
+very RPG, craft, build, hunger/stamina/mana bar
+animations is smooth, though the character limbs are kinda oddly moving at times. Very ragdoll like (all parts move)
+seems like the devs are active/pushing out patches. So for now, I have hope that this will not fail like the majority of EA games I've supported. /crosses fingers and toes

Cons
- WORLD NOT RESPAWNING/RENEWING. probably a MAJOR one. Devs said they might reconsider . .""might"". This should be the first one on the list. It will be a problem the longer the players play the game as things can easily become barren and stale. Since nothing respawns; no renewable resources such as wool/meat/ect. For an RPG game, keeping things ""alive"" and ""fresh"" is one of the main point.
[strike]Corpses not despawning.[/strike] 
-not much craftables, it stops after gold bar but I've seen the codings, so looks like there will be lots more, but not yet. . .
-I can't be a translucent ghost (no pale/white skin)
-farming time is irritating. It uses REAL time, most of the crops are 2hrs and up, fruit trees are 10hrs. This is a big one for me, as I like to just be able to chill after my killing spree(which I can't really do since things I kill don't respawn) and go kill crops instead.
-only one town to visit, [strike]4 or so dungeons. and a lot of ""wilderness""[/strike] now 7 dungeons and wilderness
-no magic .. . 
-forced save. only one slots, can't choose when to save.
-no home mark so I couldn't find my way home. Some kind soul in discussion put in his starting location, so I managed to get home.
-there's this guy wearing pot armor following me in this part of town. He's scaring me. Sometimes he says he's hungry so I tried to give him food at first (you can't), kept saying people throw stones at him, then tell me he got a gift for me ""it's stones"".


small amount of content. it's good enough for ""now"" since it's in EA, but I definitely would love to see more craftables (especially functional chandeliers, better/prettier and smaller storage chests. Be able to place decorations on table surfaces (like end table/wardrobe/ basically flat table surfaces), increase stack amount in some items stack (ore stack is 100, feels like it should be 1000 like the building blocks, furs is only 20 max stack--which is annoying as heck). Big water flask and small water flask is exactly the same amount, there should be a difference

tips for new players: wolves are scary in the beginning. it WILL kill you. you can reset the shopkeeper's inventory by reloading the game. can switch your bags by changing in in the character screen (thanks to kind soul that helped me. I love you). Make sure you remember where your home/base is!, also maybe build base near the end of the map for easy travel.",1513722464,1513904175,True,17,0,0.660103082656860352,0,True,False,True,False,,,

（v0.2.0で追記）

将来性という意味で「おすすめ」はする。が、
まだまだバグがあり、未実装のシステムもあるので、開発が進展してから手を出したほうが十二分に楽しめると思う。
（現段階でもそれなりに開発途中のものとして楽しめてはいる）

具体的には、
種族が10もあるのに種族固有スキルが現状ないので、種族選択で見た目以外の違いがない（たぶん）。
敵の死骸が消えずに放置。→動物の皮を剥ぎ、肉を解体するシステムを考えているらしい。
（v0.2.0で死骸の除去が出来るように。）
一部の建築用ブロックがまだない。
（v0.2.0で階段ブロックが加わった。基本的な建築はできる。）
エフェクト関係はこれから。
（v0.2.0でライティング系が機能するように。）
クエストや敵、コンテンツが少ない。→ワールドマップは拡張するとか。
（v0.2.0でワールドマップの拡張、クエストとダンジョンがいくつか追加された。）

一応、内容についてもかんたんに紹介。
このゲームは、各種職業レベルと自アバターのレベルの関係が独特で、各種職業レベル（クラフト関連、農業、採掘などのこと）を上げると経験値が入って、それで自アバターのレベルが上がるようになっている。
もちろん敵を倒すことでもレベルは上がるが、ほぼ戦わずしてレベルを上げるようなこともできる。
例えば、素材を調達→クラフト→売る→お金で新しい素材をゲット→クラフト→売る、のような繰り返し。そのクラフトする過程で職業レベルが上がり経験値が入るので、それで自アバターレベルが上がっていく。
レベルが上がるとスキルを修得するためのポイントがもらえるので、スキルツリーで好きなように成長させていくことができる。

空腹と水分の概念があり、若干サバイバルに寄せている感があるが厳しいものではない。
食料と水のスロットにアイテムを入れておけば、勝手に摂取してくれる親切設計だ。

夜になったり地下を掘ったりしたら敵が湧いてくることもなく、ひたすら作業に没頭できる。
交戦したければ、道中で遭遇するかこちらから敵地に出向く形になる。

全体的にまったりというか、プレイヤーのペースで進めることができるゲームだという印象を持ったが、作業しないとレベルが上がらない職業レベルというシステム上、ゲーム内作業が好きな人向けかもしれない。",1513525820,1513945596,True,27,0,0.760308742523193359,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This is basically a Terraria clone at the moment. More of an RPG. Almost like Skyrim in 2D. No magic yet, maybe except for alchemy and magic resistance. No multiplayer, no overworld/level randomisation. Combat is difficult, if not downright hard or even brutal. The game overall is quite cool, albeit feels too grindy (for instance weaving does not give new recipes every skill level). ([b]EDIT:[/b] the latest patch nerfed boars and wolves, which is a good thing. Greywolf Camp quest and Zagmig (if killed) are still bugged, and there is no backup system to recheck if those quests were completed. Also developers are rolling out regular bugfixes, and the latest content update expanded the overworld by 10 tiles, bringing it to 30x20 tiles total.) Gaining profession experience and doing quests seems to be fun. There are even some dialogue choices. Books show a tad of penmanship and consequently some promise in them, too, well... apart from typos and other minor issues like that. There seems to be quite a few references to Fallout and Skyrim as well, a bit of humour (the barrel guy). Hmmm. No, to reiterate, haven't encountered any actual magic yet, or at least, the character themself has no magic skills either so not sure if the game deserves its namesake. 

Well, the one wish? For the races to be more meaningful. Not quite what RavnosFX mentioned, cosmetic things, but some real, vital things. Such as being able to raid and destroy the ""starting"" village, some essential consequences to choosing a race at the character creation screen. Different abilities. Something. Well, at least the game itself says nothing about their differences. 

[h1]Issues:[/h1]
1. Misc Colors do not show what they change (and there is only one Misc Color 3 option?)
2. Races have no descriptions (quite unlike the races described on the IndieDB page) or any unique or special non-cosmetic characteristics
3. Wolves seem to be OP at the moment, at least so early in the game especially if you skip the tutorial (skipping tutorial also means you don't get any tutorial items, perhaps this should be an advanced start, not simply skipping and losing starting items)
4. No incentive to build a shelter or make a stand (no randomly respawning monsters, nightly zombies etc. wolves/rats only respawn in their original locations)
5. No herding? No building skill? 
6. As mentioned earlier, no magic skills yet?
7. Setting up keys sometimes swap the primary and secondary (it also mucks up the skill bar labels), shifted keys sometimes can't be remapped to non-shifted key shortcuts
8. Could planting cones/acorns be done without tilling?
9. Skill experience could be mentioned as skill experience, not simply as experience (it's a little confusing which is which)

1. Most hair and mouth options don't include things like bands which colors are changed by misc options. In the future we want to hide misc colors when they don't change anything in currently chosen hair and mouth options.
2. Currently races are cosmetic only but we will be adding racial abilities. Together with them we will include race descriptions in character creation screen.
3. We like the idea of starting with nothing type of begining for more advanced players when they skip tutorial. We discussed idea of having more options for starting your adventure, maybe we will explore it in the future.
4. Right now the biggest incentive to build a base is to have a place to store all of your crafting stations and items. We want building to be optional, we want to give an option of playing a ""homeless"" adventurer.
5. Herding will be added in the future. We've had Construction profession before but we decided to remove it because it only increased radius around your character in which you can build and it wasn't that interesting. Instead we increased base radius.
6. It's a little bit ironic that currently there is no magic in Realms of Magic but it will be coming very soon.
7. We haven't encountered it before, we will investigate and fix it.
8. That sounds reasonably.
9. Sure, it should be easy to fix.

Could you send us your save so we can investigate the ""eaten"" talent point issue? Saves are located in My Documents in Realms of Magic folder."

[전투 방식] 은 템 뿐만아니라 특성의 영향을 많이 받고 달리기, 방어 공격등의 행동이 스테미너를 소모 하기때문에 초반에도 무작정 공격만해서 적을 잡기가 힘이듭니다. 적절하게 막기, 점프 등의 회피와 공격을 병행해야 피해를 받지 않고 적을 잡을 수 있습니다. 

[크래프팅] 시스템은 만족 스러운 편입니다. 생산 분야별로 수련 레벨이 존재해 무작정 고급 등급의 재료가 있다 해서  좋은 템을 만들수는 없습니다. 저 단계 재료로 꾸준히 생산을 해야 다음 단계의 아이템을 제작 가능합니다.

[맵] 시스템은 조금 한계가 보이는게 일단 좌우 맵 길이가 짧고 아직 얼리 엑세스라 그런가 많이 단조롭습니다. 각 맵은 좌, 우 끝이 존재하며 끝으로 가면 다른 지역으로 이동이 가능합니다. 전체 지도상 모든 칸이 이동 가능하며 마을이나 던젼은 고정된 맵이고 나머지 일반 지형은 샌드박스 처럼 채집이 가능합니다.

[몹] 들 또한 아직 숫자가 적고 무엇보다 리젠이 안됩니다. 필드 한군데 들어가서  다 잡으면 안나옵니다. 지하 공동 같은 것도 아직 구현이 안되서 땅파고 들어가면 지하에 빈틈이 없어 몹도 없습니다. 


긴 글이 었지만 지금까지 플레이 해본바로는 잠재력은 충분하나. 아직은 단계별로 크래프팅 하는 재미 말고는 테라리아 처럼 보스몹 소환이라던가 하는 사냥 컨텐츠는 많이 부족한 상태입니다.",1512579057,1512862896,True,33,1,0.790689706802368164,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Current version should provide about 10-20 hours of content.

If you ever feel like you don't know what to do then open Guidebook with [G] button, it should recommend you several things to do next."
