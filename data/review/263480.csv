[h1]Exposition, Concurrence and Summation[/h1]

[i]It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety[/i] – Isaac Asimov

[b]Final Rush[/b] is a wave based shooter. They say a polished turd is still a turd; I have no evidence to refute that claim. 

This is a very strait forward, run of the mill wave based shooter. It has your assault, recon and support classes. Your rifle, sniper, and shotgun with some variations in armor sort of base differences. You shoot robots on various maps while collecting currency to refill health/ammo as well as buy upgrades and different weapons. 

There is no limb damage, aside from head shots doing slightly more damage. The basic enemies as well as even most of the “higher” tier enemies just sort of stoically proceed in your general direction and swipe at you. (Some have guns.) I thought at one point I had done some limb damage to one of the enemy robots as it had a broken arm; I later discovered this was just a different marker for a suicide robot. Having a limb damage system I realize would have taken time to implement and possibly too much to ask for a small studio; however having it a game wherein enemies are constantly “at” you, mitigating or impeding their monotonousness onslaught might have lent [b]some[/b] additional strategy other than “shooting all the things”. 

The enemies will occasionally spawn behind you in the proverbial “monster cave”. A section of map designed to obfuscate from the player that enemies are being spawned into the environment. There is no environmental damage aside from bullets decals and the occasional red explosive barrel. 

The guns feel weak, the enemies unresponsive to not only your presence but your attacks. Getting trapped in a corner with little or no ammo is certain death.

At times, the screen shakes while firing your weapon that seems ostensibly an effect to obfuscate the fact the weapons are ill-contrived for the task at hand. This effect was so violent and accosting to my eyes it truly fooled me into thinking my weapon was an effective means of dispatching these mini terminators. 

[b]THE GIST
There just isn't much substance to this and the gameplay is rather boring and tedious; While simultaneously not being very satisfying when it does (sort of) work.[/b]

Very hard at first but just have faith and keep chugging along, once you unlock a few upgrades then the game gives you a strong reason to continue.

Fast pace, strategic planning, head shots really count, having ppl to play with is great, graphics are pleasing, the robots are a little dumb but it suits them well. The robots also say funny things while attempting to kill you.

If anyone out there, players or even Dev's see this and know how to possibly create more maps, edit the current maps or any kind of editing to the game to continue adding excitment then please message me. Also if the Dev's see this and it might be possible for you then could you look into having Steam Workshop for Final Rush?

After each wave you are able to upgrade/buy new weapons, skills or customise your armor. Sounds pretty neat, right?

Well, to be honest, the game is quite fun for a while. The thing is, a multiplayer game like this simply needs a lot more to keep being fun and interesting. 

The main problem of Final Rush, is the lack of players/servers. At the time of writing, there was no active server and for that, no active players. I did set up my server but during that time no other player joined me. You are able to fight the robots by yourself but that surely is not an easy task.

The gameplay felt a bit off to me. Destroying robots does not feel satisfying, gun control is a bit weird, even walking doesn't feel right. I did not get far enough into the game to know if the robots act differently after a few waves but the first waves of robots just come walking towards you and start beating you, so the A.I. is pretty much non-existent. 

Since the game uses the UT3 engine the graphics are OK. The maps are nicely done but might bore quickly. 

Overall, Final Rush is not a bad game and you could have some fun if you buy the game together with some friends. The game is quite steep and there are better games that offer the same kind of gameplay. One game that comes to mind is ""Interstellar Marines"", which also has a mode in which you destroy robots, just not in waves.

In game and action.

Just as soon you create server or join to server, game gives you option to chose your class (Assault, Recon or Support - yeah that's it). Game has 5 maps which all of them are indoors. All weapons have dreadful recoils especially assault rifle, christ, with that you can't kill anyone, while you are trying to surivive 10 robots at the time is just bullshit because shooting won't slow them down at all, sometimes they just decide to rush at you until you are surrounded and going to die after 2 seconds. (sure, i see fun and enjoyment here). Unlike KF here you can buy ammo and even heal up during waves as long as you have credits / money for it. After beating each wave you can go shopping but time to do that is rather short for new players.
Playing solo is extremly hard and trying to play online is just impossible, God knows where servers are hosted due to ping issues.
Yes, i know game has RPG system but it takes lot of time to actually get at least one level not to meantion soloing is extremely hard even on easy difficulty, i just managed to survive 4 waves.

Overall. Please do not buy it, game is unfinished and lacks content.",1421873794,1421873794,False,21,1,0.522651791572570801,9,False,False,False,False,,1421889635.0,"Can you please explain which video settings we are missing (hopefully so we can add them?)

We have Resolution, Anisotropic Filtering, Anti-Aliasing, Full-Screen/Windowed, Field of View, V-Sync, along with toggles for Shadows, Motion Blur, Ambient Occlusion, Dynamic Decals, Lens Flares, Bloom, and Depth of Field. We're also going to add Texture resolution control in an upcoming patch.

--

Our servers are hosted by NFO servers, and our specific server is located in Central United States. NFO servers is a reputable company, which hosts multiplayer servers for dozens of different games. Ping times appear to be decent or great on any test machine, or from my testers. Final Rush is also a non-competitive/PVP game, so low ping is not as crucial as for a game such as Counter-Strike, where every millisecond counts.

The accuracy is intentionally difficult on early level weapons, to encourage the player to upgrade and customize weapons, unlock skills for their character, and buy accuracy enhancers from the store in between waves."

Missing are a wider variety of robot behaviors, weapon impact, and interesting environments.

The robots tend to plod in your general direction in predictable ""robotic"" waves.  Maybe that's by design, but it is so basic that it gets boring quickly.  

Weapons lack punch, which is probably due a combination of muted visuals and sound design.  The customization and weapon variety look like they could be fun, but right now there's just no impact from your shots.  A shotgun should FEEL like a shotgun.

It's a sci-fi setting, but the metal corridors and rooms are just too clean and symmetrical to create varied encounters...especially combined with robotic waves.

Some of our reviewers may have suggest it, but it is not how we advertise the game.

Robots in later waves (there are 10 total) have more variety; such as the explosive bot, taser bot, ranger bot with a pistol, and the super-charge robot which buffs nearby enemies. We're also working to add flying robots and some additional behavior for existing enemies, but we're a small indie company. These things take time.

The early weapons lack punch specifically because you're supposed to both buy the more powerful weapons during a match from the store, and upgrade your default weapons over the course of several matches. By the time you've fully upgraded your weapon, most guns are laser guns capable of killing the lower level robots in 1 hit, especially with precision aiming to the head. Not to mention skills and player customization, and upgrades in match which gives you even more power.

You can't get the experience of the game by playing less than half an hour. I'm not sure if you can even win a single match on normal difficulty in less than 30 minutes. It's your prerogative to leave a negative review, but it's not fair to me and my team to not play the game and then complain of a lack of content.

- 4 very small and not so original maps
- apparently no damage localization for higher efficiency
- expensive weapons, so you'll stick with the 3 first weapons
- frustrating weapons, they don't feel powerful, slow reload, no zoom on sniper rifle
- no experience or perks or classes
- online play is dead
- has potential here with good graphics, it's kinda ok, but yet again, maps are too small

Final Rush is a very bad copy of Killing Floor's gameplay. The goal is to survive through timed waves that spawn robots and getting points to spend in a shop that appears between two waves. There you can buy weapons and upgrades only.To buy ammo or health, go find the two automated distributors that are elsewhere on the map so you have to choose what to go for, because despite the futuristic environment, you can't carry stuff to heal you on the way...
The story is set in a highly advanced technological future, and robots got corrupted. That's all we know, seems a bit lacking of context here.
Maps are small, only 4 of them, and so many choke points you can't use for yourself because you'll get swarmed with robots in no time. No welder to seal doors and taking a stand, absolutely no strategy here. Only way to survive is to continuously run around the (small) map and gather a horde behind you until the clock goes zero, then shoot them all. But beware of the map itself : you can jump, but can't jump above a tiny obstacle to flee the horde, which will bash you to death.
There is only 3 weapons to begin with, and an infinite ammo pistol (and bashing that merely damage bots or push them away...). Aim is tedious because of a very high recoil that screw your aim after each shot. Weapons don't feel powerfull as it can't one-shot a basic bot in the head. Oh, there is grenades too, but they'll bounce a weird way and blast radius is so ridiculous (maybe 1-2 meters), unless they badly bounce back at your face and kill you. It's safer to throw rocks and it might do more harm to those bots.
Tried the online game too, no server below 130 ping, all empty...
It seems there is an xp counter, but no profile page yet to see if there is perks to unlock, so there's no point to grind highly difficult waves of uninteresting robots for peanuts.

So it's an early access game, but it is still very unpolished in the current state. Even at 10€, get Killing Floor instead, or wait for KF2.",1411871028,1411871028,False,15,0,0.510648071765899658,6,False,False,True,False,,1412044404.0,"- Larger maps would only serve to slow down gameplay. Considering the players movement speed, if the maps were larger you would get the impression of much slower gameplay.

- You can shoot robots in the head to kill them substantially faster.

- Each of the weapons is a substantial upgrade to the starting 3 weapons, allowing players to buy them within the first moments of the game would ruin gameplay, or we would need to nerf the weapons, making them less fun to use. Still the next patch should improve balance in that regard.

- There are upgrades to improve reload speed, and both of the ""accurate"" weapons have scopes with at least x2 zoom.

- At the moment, you can only earn experience points. The next patch is including a substantial perk/class/customization system which actually uses these points. We figured it would be nice for players that are currently playing the game to be able to earn points now, instead of making them wait for the next update.

- Online play is almost definitely dead, as hardly anyone has bought the game. We can't hire online players, so there really isn't anything we can directly do about this.

Other points in your review:

- We opted to put health and ammo in different locations on the map to discourage people camping the main store (which you can use during the map) You also need Health and Ammo -during- waves, so the stores where you buy health and ammo are instant, instead of opening a menu.

- We had a very good story planned for the game, but never had the resources to impliment it. AAA games spend millions of dollars to produce story mode content which lasts only a few hours, expecting that from an Early Access Indie game is a little unfair.

- Most of the maps are designed around the player staying on the move, which is why there are many different paths, and why the player has sprint. If you stand still, you -will- be overwhelmed.

- The upcoming update already includes many improvements to gamefeel, include tweaks to grenade bouncing (now they drop directly to the ground) Improvements to melee attacks (Substantial damage boost to bullets fired after a melee) and improvements to feedback when robots are shot.

- There are many upgrades in the store which improve accuracy, if they are purchased, even the innacurate level 1 assault rifle becomes accurate enough to get headshots at medium range and beyond.


We're currently working as hard as we can to improve and update the game; and I personally apologize if the game isn't to your liking. We don't have very much in the way of resources to work on the game, so it can take a while to update it.

If you can, please take another look at the game once the 2.09 update has been released in a few days, as it will address many of the issues you have with the game.

I can't play it for more than a few minutes, because the sound effect that plays when you get multipliers (such as for getting headshots) is so much louder than the rest of the game that it gives me a headache. I tried to communicate this problem to the developer before writing a review, and he quickly released a patch to 'fix' it, but it's still awful. How awful? I recorded some of the gameplay audio to check it out, the BAMNFFF sound effect is a full TEN DECIBELS louder than anything else in the game (if you aren't knowledgable about audio editing, 10 decibels is a huge difference in volume). 

Other than that, the only enemy type that appears for the first couple waves is a generic looking robot with animations that look like they were done by a child. They have a huge amount of health compared to first-wave enemies in typical wave-based shooters, which I guess makes the game unique, but I just find them silly and annoying. Getting cornered and killed by a mob of these absurdly animated robots just feels ridiculous. 

The three starting weapons all feel very lackluster; if you like memorable gunplay, this probably isn't the game for you, although it's possible some of the purchasable weapons have a better feel. 

The graphics are nice for an indie game, nothing mindblowing, but far better than, say, Killing Floor. If only anything else in the game could hold a candle to games like Killing Floor. 

I probably have less than an hour logged but that was more than enough time to tell this is by far the worst wave shooter I've ever played. Take my opinion how you will, but I will say based on my experience that this game is a joke, the developer doesn't seem to have good taste or know what he's doing (and doesn't understand why professional gaming news sources won't give him the time of day), and you can get far better co-op gameplay for a lower price elsewhere.

Even on normal difficulty, I kept getting caught in corners and assualted by waves of robots, which I cannot seem to kill without extreme difficulty.

Edit: Alright, so I decided to rewrite my review upon request from Strike Games. This game is not my cup of tea, but that may be because I was raised on fast-paced shooters like Unreal Tornament. This game feels a bit too campy for me, and the fact that you are using bullets against robot seems ineffective. I feel that, in the future, we would have better weapons for dealing with such things, like plasma guns. The lack of pickups and instead having to pay for ammo and health is just not a mecanic I am fond of. I feel the game takes too long to pick up and by the time I have even a chance at getting a decent gun, I am being overrun.

I also feel that this game could benefit from having some sort of campain mode. It is cool that they included the story for the player to read, but playing though it would be much cooler. Maybe add missions and/or a tutorial so it is not just you getting thrown in.

You got one job, one job soldier. Survive! The robots don't make it easy but nothing is too difficult for a seasoned veteran.

As you endelessly murder the robots, the powers that be give you points that you can use to buy upgrades for your soldier. More ammo, more shield, damage resistance, better guns and lots of other stuff.

Game is in Early Access and has huge potential for improvement and make the game stand apart from its current generation FPS games.

EDIT: The guides are out-of-date, but it's the only guides there are and they have most of it covered.

- Settings?: Here's screenshots of them:

For purchasing game before price drop.

- Visuals?: Visually, this game looks amazing. The animations look a little weird, but other than that it's great.

- Sound?: The sound is alright, but it sounds a little wierd with this new update.

- Bugs?: There are thankfully not much bugs. I've only seen around 4.

- Singleplayer?: You are able to play by yourself, but so far the only thing to do is play Rush. The game is very difficult playing by yourself and there aren't much people that play this game.

- Multiplayer?: It's you and up to 3 people battling robots. There are a few dedicated servers, but barely anybody that plays[url=http://steamcharts.com/app/263480] this game.[/url] That being said, they did an amazing job with multiplayer. It's really fun to play with other people and earn some friends. You can get cornered a lot though, so make sure you have a mic to help yourself and others out. You can make your own dedicated servers. 

- Customization?: They have now added a customization tab in the main menu. When you level up, you earn more armor options, skills, and gun upgrades. You can buy these using the points you earn from beating games and leveling up. There are about 4 options for each armor piece, including head, bodym shoulders, legs, and boots. You can upgrade your guns to increase mag size, damage, etc. You can buy skills to make you run faster, reload faster, etc. There are around 25 skills.

- Content?: There are now 5 levels, around 9 weapons, around 8 upgrades during each match, 1 gamemode, multiple achievements, tradings cards, leveling up, and customization for your player and weapons. This game could use more content and workshop support, but it has enough to earn a quite a few fun hours. What they need is more gamemodes and levels. In MY opinion, they only need more levels, weapons, and workshop support.

- Replayable?: Somewhat repeatable, you should be able to get quite a few good hours into it. The addition of achievements, trading cards, and more have made this game more fun replayable (if that's a word). The addition of customization of characters, guns, skills, and even leveling up have definitely made the game more fun and intresting.

- Developers?: I'm very happy to say that the developers have delivered this update, and it is looking wonderful. There have been more updates and they continue to deliver what they promised they would. With more graphic options and improved visuals. I like the Path of Development so far, and I do wish them luck. They are active in the forums and they do respond to peoples problems. Sometimes, their response can even be humerous.

- What is Needed?: [list]
[*]Workshop support
[*]More content (guns, upgrades, levels, etc.)
[*]More players (which they can't really change :/)
[*]The ability to crouch
[*]An improved scoreboard
[*]Voting system
[*]Increase in amount of players allowed in each game (4 right now)
[*]# of robots determined by players
[/list]

- Verdict?: The game is actually quite fun. There is a lack of content and multiplayer could be improved, but they will do that in the future. I recommend getting this game now. If none of your friends play, convince them too or just ask people in discussions to play or ask me. People will be eager to play and I hope it will work out for you.",1404687435,1416670439,True,73,1,0.773428976535797119,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Persze vannak hiába, lesz ez jobb is, de nagy potenciált látok benne.
Amit én kicsit változtatnék rajta: (hátha készítők is járnak erre:D)
-gyorsabb és pörgösebb wavek
-shoti újratöltési idő marha lassú a többi fegyóhoz képest, és így szar is használni
-gomb csere lehetőség (z gomb zoomja nagyon szar)
-több gránát minden egyes kör kezdetén, gránát igen erős, minimum 3 gránát minden wave előtt
-több robotfajta
-kicsit redukálhatnák a narancsos szinű robotokat, szinte csak azoktól kaptam sebzést

Grafika tetszett, játékélmény jó volt, kiváncsian várom a multit, biztos jó móka haverokkal játszani.
Szerintem ruházz be rá, megéri!

So far i just have a few personal gripes that arnt very big fixes but would make things much smoother atm.

-first and most importantly, get real multiplayer going between steam friends ASAP. I have 2 friends myself that ive managed to sell this too, but they won't buy until they have multiplayer other than LAN
-allow custom key bindings (i know it looks like you can, but everytime i set keys differently, they just reset to normal upon leaving menu)
-A ""jump"" would be nice. Let's face it, when you play fps games nowadays, the ones who ""ground"" you with no jump feel as if there is something lacking mobilitywise the whole time.

Anyways, i do really enjoy this game and can see the potential like i said.

Очень экшеново,графика кстате весьма,играть надо точно не одному.

Сейчас конечно не все так оптимистично,игра не стрельнула,всему виной сложная разработка,игру переделывали с нуля два раза!Два гребанных раза!Постоянно менялись разработчики,в итоге игру доделывали два человека(Если я не ошибаюсь).Получилось ли у них?

Графика-картинка осталась все так-же приятной глазу,что-то в районе 2010 годов,для инди вообще очень солидно
Геймплей стал сложнее,оружие стало более ""настоящим"",есть конечно долбанутые образцы у которых отдача в небо выбрасывает камеру,но да не суть.Поработали над балансом,AI стал определенно лучше
Добавили систему рангов и прокачки,позволяет вам не только кастомизировать персонажа но и улучшать оружие.К сожалению тут с балансом накосячили,полностью прокачанный пистолет-лучшее оружие в игре.

Лично мне очень жалко что игра не выстрелила,я был доволен самой первой версией игры,когда я читал отзывы второй,люди закидывали игру дерьмом,сейчас,в финальной версии я действительно прошу вас купить эту игру,тем самым помочь разработчикам,это ведь действительно неплохая игра,часов на 5 вам точно хватит(А какая одиночная игра играется дольше?)",1390068480,1433272726,True,22,1,0.613159894943237305,5,True,False,True,False,,,

--OLD REVIEW
[YES I KNOW ITS AN ALPHA]

100% Honest review.

I would not reccomend this game in its current state. I bought it on a whim and quit after surviving 3 waves, There isn't a server browser but there is a LAN option. Gameplay is repetitive and boring, Just wave after wave of killing boring enemies with a limited use of weapons. There isn't any character customization, story nor different game modes. Maybe after 6+ Months of updates it would be worth purchasing but in its current state; HELL NO!

In all honesty this game isn't worth buying even with -33% or even -75% off.

I managed to last 1 hour, After 15 minutes I was bored, There isn't anything new or exciting at all older games such as Killing Floors (Even thought it is a slightly different genre, the concept it very similar) is much better. There is no character progression you just survive each round save up and buy a new weapon. That is pretty much the entire game in a nutshell.

I feel pretty much robbed at this point. I'd expect a lot better than this even for an early access game.. a total mistake buying this even whilst on sale feels like a cheap cash grab even after being under development for 2 years. I own a lot of early access games both with and without steam and this is in my top 5 rubbish list, I've already unistalled it and will give it ago 8 months down the line.

Also if you're using the shotgun you have to keep spamming R to reload, and it only reloads one shell at a time which is kinda annoying when you're trying to keep an eye out for the enemies. You can't even jump in this game, The environment is pretty standard and doesn't stand-out anywhere noticably. The devs say its their first game out of the studio and it shows, A good attempt but lacks content and there isn't a reason to even play it after 3 waves. 

Even when loading up the game for the first time it states there is a game update so I click on the update button and it loads up a web page stating that there isn't an update? O.o

Edit: Reponse to developer (Also posted in comments)

Hello developer,
I'm happy to receive a response directly from a developer, during the last couple of years  with game studios both big and small struggling I can to some degree understand your viewpoint. 

I'm also glad to see that the game will continue to be developed as I was worried from what I had seen (v1.00) and the dates surrounding the release and development. 

Multiplayer nowadays is certainly a must when it comes to first person shooters and being a game launched on steam I personally believe it is very important to have some kind of server browser regardless of what format and I am also hopeful now that the server option is being worked on.

I may have come across a little bit harsh in my review but for a small studio graphically I believe the game is quite solid. Environment features such as exploding barrels, laser trip mines & different types of grenades (Example. EMP & Damage over time grenades) aside from the regular fragmentation grenades. The ability to jump would also significantly improve player-environment interaction (Example. Climbing onto boxes when cornered etc)

I will be checking back time to time on this game and even though my review was negative I believe that this could be a decent to great game. 

I'd love to have a chat sometime and discuss some small ideas that I personally think would benefit the overall experience of the game. 

Lastly I'd like to thank you for the offer of a 15 dollar steam game of my choice and it is this type of developer to customer communication that just goes to show that even small studios care what their customers think and not just about sales figures.

-----------Update----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've downloaded and played it again to see what all these updates are!

There has definitively been some progress, The GUI revamp is nice!
The enemy AI is more intelligent. 
It interested me enough to actually beat wave 10. (The game)
I couldn't test out the Multiplayer because no servers would show up in the server browser?

Still lacking in content but it is definitively improving.

Is it worth the price tag? Nearly!

--------Update-2------------------------

So the multiplayer is now working there are two servers up with a maximum for 4 players (A little disappointing but meh, its okay)

Both servers were empty, after playing to wave 6 and dying it was +1 person +1 person coming in.

It was okay - But I have two BIG gripes with the multiplayer.

1. -Respawn lives are shared by ALL. 

Meaning that if some scrub joins your team and wastes all of your lifes during wave 1 and 2 you're pretty much screwed.

2. The STUN bots are OP.

I like the concept and the stuns.. but the stun time does need to get NERFED.

Even when you're not swarmed you'll be screwed over.

nearly all maps fill the same, all close-quarter corridor styled maps..The different maps are nice, but they feel all the same.

3. The RANKS.

Seriously? I've played 4-5 games and it seems like ranking up it going to take 3-4 months just for the second rank... Do they really expect people to grind day in day out for these ranks?

4. Limited weapon types.

They are all pretty much stuck into 3 catergories. 

Sniper, Assault rifle and Shotgun.

Pretty standard, pretty dull.

How about adding additional catergories? Such as STUN weapons, STUN grenades more AoE weaponary or heck deployables?!

5. Multiplayer teams.

there is not type of 'voting' in multiplayer which WILL have a negative impact on the player experience.

What happens if somebody is AFK on your team? How do you vote-kick them?

What happens if somebody on your team is just griefing and dying on purpose?

6. Robots - More creative entrances..

How about them dropping down from Vents? Coming up some conveyer belts like a production line churning them out. 

What about some kind of WEILD tools so you can temporarily hold positions?

How about custom player-made emblems for communities and just regular teams?",1390015118,1454882701,False,78,1,0.653290033340454102,18,True,False,False,False,,,
