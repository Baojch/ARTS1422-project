Even now, being retired, he invites me to shoot every time I come. The house is literally overflowing with weapons of different models and types. Personally, I didn't like the game too much, since I can always shoot live targets, but in virtual reality it was interesting as part of everyday activities. In reality, of course, this is impossible to do. However, the level of entertainment and involvement in the game was high. I recommend this game to anyone who is a patriot of American culture, gun lovers and anyone who just wants to have fun. Although the game is not a masterpiece, it is still a good game worth checking out!

Okay, now for the serious review. This really is a satire game first and foremost. DO NOT under ANY circumstances take this game seriously. I honestly wouldn't recommend this at full price because the story is VERY short at only around 3 hours, the gameplay overall is a bit on the repetitive side even with said short length and the only way I can describe the ending without spoiling it is that it gets more than a little bit preachy, enough that it kinda delivers the writers' obvious intended message with about as much subtlety as a shotgun to the face.

As someone who only payed 3 US dollars and 74 cents for this from the 2023 Steam Summer Sale though, I can't complain too much about the overall package. It was a fun little ride (quite literally given how level transitions are presented, actually...) and preachy ending aside, there were a few smaller jokes here and there that managed to get a good chuckle out of me.

If I was to give this a number rating, I'd say it's a solid 7/10.",1688950937,1688961843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Where everything is solved with guns, rather than more conventional means. The story is alright, the humour is okay but it's ultimately just a story telling game in VR, where you grow up and proceed to get more and more guns.

I bought this game partly to test out my new Rift S, partly because it was on sale, and partly because the mid-century artstyle and satire appealed to me as a long time TF2 player. So what went wrong? 

Where to start. Problems from SteamVR and the Rift S aside, the game is filled with technical flaws like weird clipping of the guns, audio playing over other audio, stiff animations(to be fair, all the people are cardboard cutouts, but still starts and stops too suddenly and speak at weird times). But by far the worst offender is the pacing. Buddy Washington, the dog that narrates much of the game, talks so slowly. Not quips during shooting or anything, the whole game stops and waits for him to finish whatever almost-funny joke before what you have to shoot slowly gets into position. Sometimes, the level breaks and full stops for no reason, requiring a reload and having to listen to the same jokes over again.

And for a game all about guns, there's hardly any gunplay. It's amusing the first few times you complete a mundane task by shooting it. But that's all there is.",1563937137,1563937137,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What really sets this game apart from most fps games i atleast have played or heard of is that this game is strongly satirical and critical of the americans infatuation and love for the right to carry arms so the game will surely be devisive as the subject certainly is a hot potato. Propably not a game for NRA members but if you as many americans cares for the right to carry weapons and still has some sense of humour left in regard of the subject i wouldnt necessarily recommend against the aquisition of it either. The game is outright preposterous like when you have to feed your baby with a gun by sticking a gun down the babys food while afterwards feeding it with the weapon stuck right into the toddlers face. On the other side the game has many quotes by renowned filosophers in regard of society and govermental power and such so the mix of the ridiculous and the insightfull makes this a truely unique experience while shooting your way through different scenarios with a talking dog by your side though the game.

Personally i loved this game and simply cant recommend it enough as its one of the best games ive ever played and im not only talking about games in VR im talking about all the games ive played over the years and ive played games since the mid to late 80ies.

Even though the games specs says NVIDIA GTX 1060 i ran it on a nvidia 970 and it ran fine for me so really glad i took the chance as i bought  it for half the price right after i got my HTC VIVE. With the knowledge i have now do i need to say i wouldnt mind had i paid the full price

The American Dream is a seated, on-rails first-person shooter experience for VR. Taking place in 1950's America and led by Buddy Washington the Dog, this tongue-in-cheek title takes players on a journey from birth, and throughout all the important parts of life such as prom, the first job, and marriage, in the shoes of a good 'ol gun loving All American patriot. Be prepared to eat, perform job tasks, secure a date, propose, and even help birth a baby using the only thing Americans know about, guns! There's one thing for certain, this game will either end up offending you, or you'll laugh at its obviously exaggerated take on the average American and their love for guns, America, and freedom.

It's also important to point out again that this is an on-rails game; if you're not familiar with the term, it means that it's a guided shooter. Too many of the negative reviews focus on this aspect, as if the players had no idea what they were getting themselves in to. There is no free movement, you're carted from one level to the next, and you play out the campaign in this manner. The American Dream does exactly what it sets out to do, and it does it well with excellent graphics, great voice acting, fitting music, and chuckle-worthy humor. Don't expect to lose your breath from laughing, but most of the jokes are worth at least a small laugh and an eyeroll here and there. That said, if on-rails isn't your thing you're not going to enjoy this release and you might as well avoid it. For those that don't mind a guided hand-held experience, it's one of the best seated games on the market for about 95% of its duration.

The fun and enticing 3-4 hour campaign culminates into a, I kid you not, nearly 10 minute long ranting rampage speech followed by one of the most annoying boss fights to ever exist. What makes this boss fight particularly annoying is the fact that the game likes to glitch out at random moments all through its campaign, and it just so happens that if a game-stopping glitch occurs at the end-game point you have to start all the way back at the beginning of the damned speech. There's also the matter of the awful white flashing when enemies strike you, which causes an almost instantaneous headache. It's a terrible and unfortunate end to an otherwise gem of a VR experience. It's the end that ultimately knocks an entire point off of the final score.

With the exception of the last 5% of the campaign, The American Dream is a fun on-rails shooter that is filled with enjoyable witty and dark humor. Its contents aren't meant to demean Americans, but rather portray them as an exaggerated caricature in the manner that so many Americans treat other cultures with their humor; it's tastefully done, and as an American myself I found nothing offensive here as so many others proclaim. It's also not a political statement, or a statement on gun control. It's just too bad about the ending, and the amount of glitches that happen all through the campaign. That said, it's still well worth picking up for its low asking price, and an even bigger steal on sale.

4/5

This is quite the comical little game, a really fun, funny, charming, and well made game. Though some wont see it's satire and will get offended by it being Liberal propaganda. I'd definitely recommend it.

The American Dream is hilarious. It's a great experience, and you should buy it.

It just has a lot of technical issues...

1. Audio is not realistic and often too quiet unless you aim your ear toward the source, ruining the immersion of a few scenes big time and making the game hard to watch as both the actual player and the people watching that person play.

2. Glitches. They be all over the place. You'll have to restart levels just because they didn't successfully load (similar to Anthem except it's not obvious that it didn't load until nothing happens for 2 minutes). Guns will start pointing in random directions not in alignment with your hands or your controllers.

3. The scale of the game is pretty off. The whole game is played in a poorly scaled roller coaster seat that feels too small for most any players. It might fit a child, though. Shrug.

Overall, it's still a memorable trip to play this game. Get it on sale if you have a sense of humor. Well worth the $10 ticket.",1552799907,1552799907,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was looking for an FPS VR game to play in a very small space (I'm in a dorm room), and this game exceeded spectacularly. I played the full campaign, which took me about 3 hours, and enjoyed every minute of it. I liked the humor and satire it provided, and for the most part enjoyed the shooting mechanics. 

I say most part because the ""hand-gun"" was a little buggy sometimes, and the springfield sections were difficult because of VR rifle precision (think playing competitive COD on the wii). 

I think the game is definitely worth the price, and don't see what other people are complaining about. If you wanted a 60 Hour VR game, go play Skyrim or Fallout. It's pretty much up to you. If you think it looks good, buy it. It's a good game, and for $0.11 a minute, it beats any carnival shooting gallery I've played.

The American Dream is a series of shooting galleries set against a backdrop of alternative Americana history.

The story takes you through the process of growing up and living your whole life with guns as your main tool of choice.
Starting from infancy, where as a baby you shoot at flashcards and learn to aim. Through adolescence where you clean your room by shooting things on the floor. Or your first job out of school where you flip burgers by shooting them. And so on it goes.

Everything lives inside a cardboard semi-robotic world. The graphic design is top notch. Lot‚Äôs of attention to detail especially in the posters and 2D art.

The big question is whether or not this is fun. And that heavily depends on if you like shooting galleries. Because this entire game is the ultimate story-driven shooting gallery. 

If you don‚Äôt enjoy shooting galleries, then this isn‚Äôt for you.
But if you LOVE shooting galleries, then I highly recommend it. It‚Äôs like the ultimate carnival shooting game come to life. The game will take you almost 5 hours to beat, so if these are your thing, then you‚Äôll be in heaven.",1535758148,1535758148,True,9,1,0.572113990783691406,0,False,True,False,False,,,

1. Polished comedic rail shooter.
2. Very clear visuals.  No/few particle effects.

Neutral
1. Political theme presented with elegance and impact most of the game.  Spoilt by a few hamfisted moments.  Probably needed some people from Texas in the testing team.

Cons
1. Exposition/lecture x2  near the end weakens the overall impact of the game's message.  Was it a condition of film Australia funding that you include film?  Both the live action film and final boss exposition felt last minute and not in keeping with the rest of the game.
2. The game misgendered my beloved in the resteraunt.
3. While it has scene select, you need to sit through the scene, you can't just jump to the game portion of each scene.
4. Last few scenes are noticably more indie than the rest of the game.

[b] The American Dream[/b] is a satirical (and somewhat controversial) VR game about the American obsession with firearms.

It is set in the United States in the 1950s. You start the story as a 1-year-old baby. This is when you get introduced to your first gun. The game tells the story of an ‚ÄúAverage American‚Äù. You will grow older, start dating, and find a job while learning how guns can help in your day-to-day life. There are 20 unique story levels. Each of them is being narrated and the voice is over is done well. 

The retro ‚Äúcardboard cut-out‚Äù visual style is interesting but graphics themselves are pretty average. I could not find any settings to see if I could improve them in any way. Controls are responsive and the aim seems to be accurate. 

[b]The American Dream[/b] is a short (2-4 hours) linear game with an over the top story that many people will find entertaining. The gameplay itself is a generic on-rails shooter for the most part and it is a seated experience only. There is some replay value that comes from hunting missable achievements and hidden targets in most chapters. Each chapter can be replayed from the main menu.

This game is fun was fun but $20 seems too high in my opinion. I recommend getting it on sale.

Whereas a game like Hotdogs, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades is a love letter to all things gun related, The American Dream is very much a satirical experience that happens to have guns in it. You play as the unseen protagonist and follow his life from birth, through his school years, adulthood and beyond in a railed experience - Quite literally in fact, since you sit in a rollercoaster type seat as the game pushes you from level to level.

Each level is presented as a defining experience in the character‚Äôs life, for example his first words, his first crush, or first job flipping burgers, all narrated by a patriotic cigar chomping dog named Buddy. The spin is that this America is a 50s-esque super-stereotype where guns dominate every aspect of American life in the most absurd of ways. The player uses his guns exclusively to interact with things in a kind of minigame fashion, such as to clean his room or wash cars, and thus ultimately progress through the level. If that sounds ridiculous to you, then you understand this game completely, as it doesn't even kind of try to take itself seriously. It‚Äôs not trying to make a social commentary, it‚Äôs just trying to poke fun at all the cliches people have about Americans, guns and 50s culture.

The art and design of the game is beautiful and very well realized, with an I love Lucy type of feel to the cardboard cutout world. Although each environment is rich with lots of clutter, the game is not as interactive as you might think. Most of the time there's only a very limited number of things you can shoot and even then it's mainly what is scripted to be shot in order to complete the level, so in this way the rail aspect of the game really shows.

Funnily enough one of the weakest aspects of the game is the guns themselves! They don‚Äôt sound, look or behave very realistically at all, which is a huge reminder, that this is not a shooting sandbox like H3, and that the ‚Äúgame‚Äù element is very much all about the satirical narrative, which I should make clear it does very, very well. The comedy is dry, dark and unapologetically non-pc, so if you get offended easily, this might not be your cup of tea.

The game is surprisingly quite long but has pretty much no replay value to to the rail element and one-shot scripted narrative. And for that reason, the $20 price tag, although low in general, is still a little high for my liking. I think a ten-fifteen dollar tag would have been a better value for money, so I would maybe advise people to look out for this one on sale.

A VR shooter game, that invites us to immerse ourselves in a world where we use guns for everyday tasks. The game even sees your hands replaced by guns, and the gameplay involves completing a series of mini shooter games, whilst progressing through the story of your life as a stereotypical 1950s male, simultaneously narrated in a satirical manner by your guide Buddy. The voice acting is of a high quality, although I did think that there was a little too much narration prior to gameplay, as I was impatiently waiting at some points for the narration to end. As you progress through the game and your ‚Äòlife story‚Äô, you can unlock and try out more weapons. The gameplay could be enhanced by adding global leader-boards, making it more challenging to unlock weapons, and perhaps by providing players with some ‚Äòlife choices‚Äô to keep the player also engaged in the story. The weapons are interesting to use, as some guns are more challenging to use than others, and the gun mechanics and interactivity are well considered.

Do you hate the ideology that guns make people safer? Do you love satiracal humor? Then this is absolutely the game for you! The American Dream, a game set in the 1950s that sees every man, woman, and child in America using guns as the solution to everything is just as hillarious as the trailers let on. Sprinkled throughout the game, despite it's 50s setting, are many gags and jokes centered around all the absurd excuses gun-nuts use to keep their beloved firearms. 

I won't spoil too much, but the ending boss battle even makes it rewarding to die, providing you with really amazing quotes by very influential figures (even those like Abraham Lincoln) about the dangers of a society so fixated on it's firepower. Yes, the game is very politically charged, and if you are someone who loves guns, said ending will probably upset you because it will tell you things you probably don't want to hear.

The team that made this game lives in Austrailia, a nation that passed strict gun control laws in 1996 after a massacre that killed 35 people and wounded 23 others. Ever since, they have had one of the fewest gun violence rates in the world. USA, on the other hand, is the outlier. This game comes from a country that reigned in the problem of gun violence over 20 years ago, so they look at the gun culture of the US with baffled amazement, but also understanding of why it exists: Fear. Fear of foreigners, Fear of the government and fear of your neighbor.

That said though, the game also doesn't defend any idealistic dreams often held by anti-gun liberals either. It doesn't pretend that if we banned guns that we would get rid of all gun violence. Austrailians know this firsthand due to the incident in 1996 not being the last time anyone ever got hold of or used a gun, with one of the most recent examples being the 2014 Sydney Hostage Crisis. They merely ask that we as Americans not be so lax about it. Don't let just anyone get a gun out of fear or anger. Keep better track of our guns (there is actually an entire level in the game entirely dedicated to that last point). Make sure we know who is buying guns and why. Otherwise, the truth of the real world might end up even more insane than the world depicted in this game.

If you are anti-gun, you are going to LOVE this game and it's message. However, even if you are someone who does currently support gun ownership, as long as you have an open mind (something incredibly lacking in modern society, hell even I have been known to not have a very open mind), you should still give this game a try. You might learn a little something.

I got this game on sale for 15% off, but even at it's full retail price it's worth the money. Do keep in mind though that it is a seated experience only and sometimes features long winded bits of narration/video. I usually found the narration and video to be funny and enjoyable, but I've seen other people in reviews for this game complain about it so I figured I'd bring it up here. There have also been a few audio and performance bugs I've encountered, but most of them have been quickly patched by the developers (who were actually nice enough to respond to my email about my technical issues personally) and the ones that still remain are usually easily worked around.

This is easily my most favorite indie game ever made and I eagerly look forward to what this developer puts out in the future.

The theme is a satirical vision of a gun culture america as seen by austrians. The art style and format of the game is like a Disney themepark ride with flat plywood characters and a dog with a speaker in his mouth. It has a kind of 50s aestheic in presentation. The whole time you sitting/standing in a cart like in the ride so there is no locomation. No real enemies and amounts to watered down job simulator with less things to do and options to get the on rails story to continue.

The gunplay doesn't feel right. Everything sort of feels under powered or somehow off. The main pistols used has some kind of rate of fire limiter on them that wouldn't let me shoot faster and for some reason the case ejects upward. For two handed weapons you use a luger knock off that has its own hand that you'd use to manipulate gun controls or hold the front of the gun. This results in you holding the larger weapons with a kind of foregrip but its of by a few inches. Most things reload by hiting a virtual button on the side of the cart. Might have to grab the mag for rifles or do something different for like for the bolt action or shotgun.

The game isn't really buggy but I did manage to find one that required restarting the chapter/level. I continue to play games that are worse in this regard.

I stopped at what it called an intermission but it drags so much with a lot of talking and literal cut scenes using a projector screen it's taken me over an hour to get to this point. No mini game is really a challenge although I guess you could sit through it again to try to get better ratings. A lot of the time I was playing I found myself shooting random things while story is happening just because I have nothing to do and I'm not really doing story. This isn't great for an interactive media but some people like story driven walking sims.

Even without getting to the finish line it is clear there is a political message behind this title. At best it is mocking the idea of gun ownership. Reading reviews on other sites, after puting down the game, confirmed this but apperently it gets real clear in the message and real dark. This political non-sense really taints the satire for me as it became less of a Starship Trooper's ""Do you want to know more?"" and more of a Hell House fundy churchs set up during halloween.

No, what you‚Äôre really here for is the ‚Äúquirky‚Äù theme/atmosphere/whatever, which is the unique part. The art, voicework, script, etc. hits all the notes they were going for, though you'll often find yourself wishing they'd shut up and let you get on with the game. There's a lot of sitting around while moving between setpieces or waiting for the narrator to finish. The subject matter/message is pretty... well... If you‚Äôre a non-American, I‚Äôm willing to bet you‚Äôll find this game hilarious. If you are American, this may very well hit too close to home. If you‚Äôre a gun enthusiast, this may feel like a straw man attack on you when admitting to being a terrorist doesn‚Äôt stop you from getting a gun, there's a level where you shoot police that are coming to take your guns, etc. If you‚Äôre concerned about gun violence and safety, you‚Äôre likely to be triggered (pun intended) by eating food off the end of a gun or seeing guns in the hands of babies, etc.

Look, god knows Americans have been insensitive about other people‚Äôs cultures, so I ain‚Äôt mad at this publisher. Just giving you a heads-up that whether you‚Äôre afraid the government is going to take your guns or afraid your kids are going to be shot at school, this game is almost as likely to cause offense/discomfort/awkwardness as playing Cards Against Humanity with your parents.

Hmm. I remember the ads for this game for along time. I wasn't really sure it was related to an actual game, or I might have gotten it confused with advertising for Duck Season. Apparently it's a real game, and it's out now, and I bought it really quick (actually it was a gift, thank you S-----) and I played the whole thing! 3 hours with the VR hat on. Let's hope I did it all quickly enough to get tons of clicks on my youtube!

Hmmm. [u]It's very similiar to Duck Season actually, but It didn't really 'pop' like that game did.[/u] You shoot stuff, and there is stylistic environments to absorb, alot like Duck Season. In this game, the shooting and the environments are mixed, and there is nothing nearly as lush as the TV room from Duck Season. It's front facing and very simple, even though the presentation is [i]very[/i] good.

The shooting in Duck Season was fun, but it was the same thing over and over. In this game you shoot stuff too, but its different stuff, not just ducks. The guns don't really make compelling sounds and there isn't any force feedback to the controllers, which blunted the fun.[b]The game play really is boring though. You just shoot stuff, targets mainly.[/b] Other than the boss battle at the end (the dog is evil like in Duck Season too, haha spoiled it) nothing shoots back at you. It's just a cascade of long shooting scenes, with some kind of scoring system. The game is quite long, which is both a good thing and a bad thing, and there are some pretty cool scenes (I liked the russian roulette part), but it does seem to drone on too long. They should have condensed the game length by a third and added more interactivity beyond shooting the main targets.

This game should be more 'badass', but it's a bit weak and diluted. You can see where they were going with it, but ran out of ideas to enhance the game play, especially considering it's not a room scale thing. It's a front facing target shooter, and I'm sure you've played a few thousand apps like that by now. Rating this up postively, because the price is still fair, and there is alot of polish and content and length, but yeah, get Duck Season first, if you haven't already.

Anywho, that being said, I support the SJW message inherent in this title, and the strong statement it makes on American gun culture. I should have played with the subtitles on to catch some of the funny things the dog might have said that I missed. It's made by the Australians, who have had great success with gun control. I think it's fair to say America is fucked when it comes to guns, and we will all continue to drown in the blood of school children for the foreseeable future. [spoiler]After background checks and the banning of bump-stocks and other wack accessories, I support a massive gun buy back program. It's the only conceivable way to address the fact that there are more guns in this country than people. None of this will happen though. It's hopeless.
