Apparently it works well with occulus.  But simply does not work on WMR,  and by the developers post responses to others in the past, it sounds like they didn't have a WMR headset to test it,  so they should never, ever have indicated it was WMR compatible.

So if you have an occulus, it might be worth trying.   If not,  you are out of luck, and the developer doesn't appear keen on fixing the problems for WMR users.

So I have to give it a big old thumbs down.   I was scammed.   Would never have bought it if they were honest about WMR support.

The programmers of this game have really botched the controls and mechanics of this game. The default controls on a gamepad do not make any sense at all and are not user-friendly to anyone who is used to flight sims. When attempting to map the controls to my hotas joystick/throttle, I wasted 2 hours trying to make changes that the game would honor. 

Horrifically, the controls sometimes remap themselves. For example, I mapped a button to ""menu interaction' (basically the ""ok"" button), and somehow in the middle of navigating menus, the button would stop working... >.<   other times, you'd specifically map something to one button, and in-game it would be swapped with another button.

I felt like I was fighting with this game almost every step of the way. I started off with a look at the [b]options[/b] which were pretty [b]minimal[/b], the game has a few graphical tweaks with a res ""booster"" (which I like, especially when the game ignores your SteamVR SS settings.) I left things at default which were high with base 100% res scale. The only gameplay options are toggle on/off for screen shake and pitch invert.

The game [b]looks very dated[/b], which is only made worse by the fact that it [b]runs poorly[/b] too. I had some stutters, it spent most of its time at 60fps (was set to 120Hz which it clearly was unable for) and even a few freezes. On my second session, I tried at 90Hz and it did at least spend most of its time there, but the odd stutter and rare freeze still happened. 9700k/2080ti/32gb/ssd.

First up, I went into test flight, which I thought would be an ok place to start - it wasnt. As I looked around my cockpit, about 10 seconds in I started to get flashing covering the right half of my screen as if I was being shot or hitting an invisible world barrier (I was still in the hangar!), ship died, started again. This time I thrust immediately out of the hangar, but as I got to the mouth, I have no idea how, but my ship acted like I hit something (I was as clear as I could be, having flown straight forward the short ~20 meters to the exit) and my ship spun and exploded. Take 3, I got out of the hangar and was blasted down in about 20 seconds. Ok, not the place to start!

Next, I went to basic tutorial, its almost entirely dialog driven with next to no visual ques. Its not uncommon for 2 messages to be playing at once. A bug that I thought was so annoying I stopped to look up if anyone reported it and if it might be fixed - found threads on it dated 2017 (pancake version), so I wouldnt hold my breath on that one :/ There is a good list of tutorials, I did just a few.

I then tested out how the game works with different controls. The short answer is terrible. It supports a range of input devices, but if you dont use a gamepad, enjoy having to bind everything. On keyboard/mouse, only WASD is set, not a single other key seemed to do anything, while its nice that you can rebind, it seems criminal to not have a basic profile for different methods setup, I dont mind tweaking things, but having to set a key for everything?! The knuckles (/Index controllers) were strange, pressing right on the right thumbstick selected things on the menu, and in game it had dual functions, so while you want to pitch down you kept getting spammed the scan function, or rotating right you were spammed with the matching speed function. Thats not even the worst part!! When you tried to rotate, you were jerked usually 5-10 degrees in *either* the direction you were trying to turn to, or the opposite (before then rotating correctly), so if you wanted to subtly turn 30 degrees and did so by touching the stick a few times - grab yo nausea medication.

The gamepad worked fine and things were mapped nicely. It is the input I would recommend anyway since the motion controllers are not tracked and only act as a gamepad anyway.

Finally, I gave the campaign a go. After a short video which is shown on a small floating screen (I dont mind this honestly, I would rather when devs are porting a game from pancake to VR to put the time in pretty much anywhere else than try redo cutscenes) and mission briefing while sat in VR, I was on my way. It started to feel a little like fun :O I managed to fly out of the hangar without exploding (noice!) and was given instructions to escort some ships. No problem! It was a pretty sleepy affair, after a few minutes I was told there was a ship(/blip) lurking around some asteroid and it was go time! Kinda. There was 1 ship, which took me a minute and a half to find (probably my fault, as I had no idea I could scan a near target - no controls are shown and I didnt get down through the tutorials, so maybe its in there somewhere), easy kill, on with the mission. 2 minutes of more sleepy flight and we arrive at what I am assuming was the destination because everyone kept flying around it. I must absolutely suck, because I couldnt see what I had to do for the life of me. I genuinely spent 10 minutes looking around the station, looping around it and scanning, flying to where I thought the game wanted me to go, flying next to each of the container ships... nothing happened. Got annoyed, started to fire at the ships! Was given out to (fairly lightly tbh!) Destroyed 1 of 3, no warnings or HUD changes happened, so I started to fire at the second! I figured at this point if I cant complete this mission I am going to fail it in style. As I fired at the 2nd ship I got a message which sounded like my shields were depleted? Dont know how or why, but I was no longer able to fire or fly! I could look around, but not thrust, or roll, or ..... I gave up!

So, I even failed at failing! What a perfect way to end!

After that experience, I just cant recommend this game.

----------------------------------------
Developer responded to my review, so I am changing my recommendation to positive. Unfortunately my problems persists, no advice helped and my Saitek X52 still does not work with this game, but otherwise the game is great and just the fact, that somebody still cares about his customers and actively works on development and bug fixing is good enough for me to give it thumbs up.
And what's even better, the remastered version is on the way!


This review reflects only current state of the game and I will update it when Saitek X52 issues making it unplayable for me will be fixed

I hate not to recommend this game. Its a work of love of someone who probably played all Wing Commander games, who watches Battlestar Galactica and even has a copy of Wing Commander movie, no matter how bad that movie is. This game is descendant of Freelancer and Freespace series.
From the moment I opened it I love it. The female computer voice, the attention to detail, the way that the computer voice interacts with what you do in the menu, the design style. 
And than you start the first mission, you are in a hangar sitting in a cockpit that looks so familiar, with the targeting and scanning system that fills your hart instantly with joy. 

So why the negative review?
Because the controls do not work. If you have Xbox controller, it works perfectly. According to other reviews, also HOTAS joystick works. But I have Saitek X52 and when I saw it in the controls menu, I was overjoyed. I have selected it and image of the joystick with description of all buttons appeared - I was so happy that I almost suffered a stroke.

So I started mission, applied throttle - and nothing happened. I my inital thought was, that there is some launch button that I just need to find. I had no idea that I just made a first step on the path that ends in the ninth circle of hell.
I started pushing all buttons and button that is supposed to be primary fire brought up the menu. This menu is not a step to victory, it's a death trap. You cannot change controls, it just gives you overview of your current controls that do not work at all, but what worse - there is no way how to close it. The button that opened it dos not close it (of course, its primary fire, not a menu button). No other button closes it either. There is no close option in the menu, so all I can do is find a sub menu that gives you options to restart mission or go to main menu.

So I went to main menu, check that I have really selected Saitek X52. Everything seems to by ok, so I fired the mission and repeat all the desperate steps that finally brought me back to the main menu.

But I did not give up - there are custom controls option. If you try them than you have to admire again the attention to detail in this game. Custom menu brings a non VR screen and computer voice gives you instructions what you need to do. You start mapping all controls to your X52 joystick and everything works perfectly, every input and axis is recognised, you can set sensitivity to every axis and also revert it if need.
Oh joy, I made it, it took some time and effort, but I made it! Cannot wait to finally leave the hangar.

So I started the mission - moved the stick and the ship reacted! Pushed the throttle and leave the hangar. There is some enemy! Lower the throttle, quick turn to get behind his back - oh joy, this is awesome - a little closer, now, fire! Pushed the primary fire - and it opens that cursed, inescapable menu... It doesn't matter that you mapped primary fire to that button, it still opens that bloody menu.

Next step I tried was to delete local user files to let the game recreate them - but this fix is for the older version of the game, not for the one I have recently installed. And it didn't help.

Curently I have copied .ini file which someone posted on forum. With X52 selected I am now able to browse main menu using the joystick - but no key, neither on the joystick nor on the keybord now works as Enter, so I cannot launch the game or open any other menu item. But I am not giving up, I will check the config I try to fix this.

Anyway I am not refunding this game. It deserves my money even with those issues I am having. And as always, it might be something on my side - joystick drivers, whatever... and the game itself is great!",1563108519,1565896694,True,2,0,0.522813081741333008,0,True,False,False,False,,1565642512.0,"Hi Were thanks for the feedback.  I read all feedback, and every bit of it is valuable feedback and a lot if not all of your issues will be fixed up in the remastered version, due late this year.  This is a free and a massive overhaul and improvements in every respect based on feedback from you guys.

As this is still taking time, just one developer - www.shauntwilliams.com  still giving the game love and when getting the time, taking it to a new level.  Just want to let you know that the X52, and X52 Pro both work in the current version.  Some people they don`t, and some they do.  There are many resolutions around the community pages, and I spent over $300 on both of these sticks to develop and support the game with these exact popular devices.   Best not to use custom.  Try deleting ""Game ini files as mentioned on forums""  Appsdata/Local/CDFStarfighterVR -  these files need to be recreated, and you need to use arrow keys to select the stick you want in options, first launch.    

Again, Thanks for the feedback, and I look forward to bringing you guys the Remastered version for free later this year, as the price will go up on par with other VR games in its genre and type, and game content when the remastered version goes full release and replacing this old one.

-BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS. 
-FEELS LIKE A PROPER COCKPIT SPACE SHOOTER
-SOUNDS ARE VERY GOOD 
-THE EVE VALKYRIE SINGLE PLAYER WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR
-A REMASTER IS TO BE RELEASED SO EVEN BETTER (unless i am playing the remastered version?)

CONS:

-MENU NAVIGATION NEEDS WORK. YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR GAMEPAD HANDY NEXT TO YOU.
-THE DASH CAMERA SCREEN IS TOO BIG. (any way to shrink or remove it?)
-THE ONBOARD COMPUTER VOICE IS REALLY NICE BUT COULD GET ANNOYING IN TIME. 
-ON FREE FLIGHT MODE IM HAVING TROUBLE LOCATING THE MOTHER SHIP TO LAND. 
-I WISH THE SHIPS COULD GO A BIT FASTER. MAKE ME GET ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. (they arent really slow either dont worry)

HMD Used: Oculus Rift with XBox One Gamepad
Computer Set-Up: i7-8700, Windows 10, GTX 1070Ti, 16 GB RAM

In reading the reviews on this thing, I had been staying away from it.  When the developer posted a Re-Mastered Version would be coming in the future, I thought I would take a stab (after all, if it were that bad, I could refund it).  I'm glad I did.

First off, starting this thing up in Oculus VR Mode, was nothing but a disaster.  Although I could get the game started, the gamepad was completely unresponsive (except for the Thrust)/
But when I started up the game in Steam VR Mode, I had a more pleasant experience, although I was stuck on the default Steam VR screen until I left clicked on my mouse, then the game started.
After playing with the game for a bit, I decided to change the GamePad Configuration to '2' (I'm a lefty), inverted the pitch, and reduced sensitivity on the pitch/yaw.  Getting to the Custom Control screen (which, unfortunenately, you had to take off the Rift, and make the changes on the flat screen monitor) resulted in a game crash or two.  When I got stuck on the Custom Control screen, Task Manager usually had my RAM pegged out at 85%.

In finally getting the controls to my liking, I started to play a lot more: Trial Run, Free Flight, Simulation/Training Mode. Wow! This is the first space game in a long time (I would count Everspace, but their support for the Xbox One gamepad was horrible the last time I played) where I had a game  impress me in the same way Eve Valkyrie VR did.  The sense of scale is immense (flying around the base ships is incredibly fun, and flying around the various astreroid fields was also a good time (especially the violatile asteroid field). Tracking both friendly and enemy ships is a breeze (love the 3-D radar), and the ability to match the target's speed is a great feature.

But then came the crashes........
Every so often (average of every 4 missions or so), the game screen would freeze, requiring me to re-start the game. Less common, but no less important, is that the Unreal Engine would crash (with an option to send the developer a report on what happened; which I took advantage of).  More rarely, is the one time where the crash closed down Steam entirely.

Normally, these crashes would cause me to refund the game, but the basic gameplay, its sense of scale, the fun of flying around, captivated me enough to keep coming back (although after the game crashed Steam, I decided to stop).
Now I haven't gotten to the campaign yet, but I've mostly enjoyed what I played so far, and do want to come back for more.

Unless the game performance starts tanking worse than the stock market in December, I plan to come back to play, and look forward to what the remaster may bring.",1546401660,1546401660,True,1,0,0.501173734664916992,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Before the bad, the one good thing was that setting custom controls seemed to work ok. It recognized my several joysticks and pedals and accepted mappings to most of their buttons and axes. However, menu navigation seemed to be stuck on only using the gamepad. So even if I successfully mapped everything to my joysticks for playing, I'd have to keep my gamepad in my lap to navigate the menus.

The main reason I'm returning this is because I couldn't navigate the menus properly to test out my mappings and get into a game. Whenever I'd bring up the menu, pressing what should have been the ""select"" key (A on Xbox controller by default) had some weird behavior where it would also cycle through the options and would only sometimes actually select the an option. Spent several minutes trying to just get started after changing my mappings. It probably had something to do with having multiple joysticks and the controllers plugged in, but other games can handle that just fine, so I'm not wasting my time with one that doesn't.

I grew up with wing commander, loved Battlestar Galactica 70s original, Starlancer, and Freelancer. This game captures the spirit that made these universes  engrossing.

I was an early supporter of it and spent money on it early on when there were just a few levels.  I flew around them, shot up stuff, had a good time with the game.  The first time I looked out my window and saw my cannons on the wing was one of my coolest VR moments thus far.

That said..

The controls are just a mess in the most recent update.  I don't know how you can neglect support for an Xbox 360 controller which much of the population still owns.  When I first purchased it played fine with a 360 controller, but 6 months later things have gone all to hell.   For some reason the game wants to default to keyboard buttons for my ship controls (my 360 controller works fine on every other VR game I have) instead of my 360 gamepad.  I had to go into custom controls to fix, and when back in the game, my ship spins like a damn top and the controls are all out of whack.  Left is right, right is left, up is down, down is up, and then I puke.  I have no other controls plugged into my USB.  This is running Windows 7 64 bit with most recent updates and 360 controller driver installed.

I gave up on trying to even get my starfighter out of the docking bay.  I've come to the conclusion that it's a lost cause.

And the menus?  They remain a nuisance with a gamepad after 6 months.  I've never seen a game where the cursor will skip options like it does in this one.  And it does it continuously.  I can't tell you how many times I've had to sit there and wiggle with the analog stick over the same area 6-7 times trying to hit the hotspot on an option button.  Same with the d-pad; it cannot see the hotspots.  The cursor just cannot see some of the hotspots half of the time when in the menus.

I'm a developer myself and can appreciate the work required for a game of this magnitude, but there's no way that this far into development there should be controls issues like this with one of the most popular gamepads in the PC market.  I'm not playing this with a 9.99$ controller made in Bangladesh; I'm playing this with a freaking Microsoft Xbox 360 gamepad.  And it doesn't work.  And every other VR game I have works with it fine.

My Thoughts:
A competent space shooter with a decent sense of scale (Man, those asteroids!). While it might not be upto the standards of games like 'Eve Valkyrie' it still has a lot of potential and was fun to play. The developers mentioned 'Freespace' and I have to admit, being a big fan of that game the art style did give me that vibe so maybe keep your eye on this one!

Gameplay Details:

The feeling of flying was pretty good and the AI is a challange and there are a lot of different training scenarios and skirmishes, though no offical campaign or multiplayer yet.

As others have said, the controls take a bit to get used to. On my PS4 controller, left stick is just a throttle control, and right stick moves your nose. There doesn't seem to be a way to 'roll' your ship, you just point your nose in the direction you want to go and go there, but you can't roll. I took it as a challange and just got used to piloting without rolls. 
TIP: Select button is what reset POV for me. Quite useful so you can play from anywhere.

* Frequent crashes. I've not been able to do two missions in a row without an exception popup, which of course doesn't display in the Vive headset. I have to set looking at nothingness for a minute or two before taking it off to check my PC monitor.
* Selecting a menu option takes you out of the VR world for a minute or more while a new scene loads up.
* I've had my fighter spawn somewhere inside of a wall, rather than the docking bay. No way to reset in-game.
* Controls are super twitchy with an Xbox 360 gamepad.
* I often look down to see  that my ""head"" - the game camera - is misaligned with my pilot's body. I woder what this headless pilot is doing there before I realize it's me.

And I think you can be assured this developer is pretty dedicated to making this the best he can. 

I'm recommending this, but only lightly. Steam reviews are very binary, and as so often is the case, this is a ""Yes it's good but"" review. 

This game has a lot of potential and I can see it being fun once it's complete. The immersion is there and the VR integration is relatively solid. Probably the biggest draw of the game is the 80s/90s theming which definitely makes a difference, and you often feel like you're in the middle of a cheesy dogfight from an older sci-fi TV series. This is actually pretty refreshing in my opinion, as many other games just try and be a little too flashy and end up becoming a little bland.

Graphically the game is pretty good, but much of it is likely due to the high grade engine running underneath. The GFX, such as weapons and shields, are quite nice. Ship models for the most part are detailed, and cockpits have since been updated in their textures to appear a lot more solid. It's no AAA work for sure, but it's still enjoyable to play in nonetheless. In some ways it goes towards the ""cheesy low budget sci-fi"" feel, but that's going to be subjective. 

Content wise it does feel a little empty. There seems to be a few missions along with a randomly generated dogfight mode, which won't keep you busy for long. 

There's a couple negatives though, but these are to be expected with early access titles.

The game is kinda buggy right now. The AI will probably stick out the most, since it still feels very much WIP and is capable of some funky manoeuvrers like turning and accelerating instantly. 

The other issue is the menus- the author has tried to create a full scene with a screen in front of you for each menu. It's very pretty, and the developer has improved the menus by removing excess menus, but I still feel like the transitions between each menu takes a bit too long.

My last point was the controls, specifically the apparent lack of throttle control, but since writing this review they've been touched up and are now much more enjoyable to use. 

Is it worth picking up now? I think if you're into space sims and have a VR headset, sure, and it's quite cheap all things considered. The developer is clearly here to stay and there's a nostalgic feel that not many games quite nail these days. However, it is of course fairly early, so if you're hoping for a complete experience right now it might be worth waiting a little longer.",1474171769,1474507547,True,4,2,0.541637897491455078,1,True,False,True,False,,1501117448.0,"Thank you for your feedback.

I only played it at Gamescom 2016,* and that experience was already worth the game's price.
It's probably the most immersive VR game I have seen so far, because it gives you all the freedom you'd have in a starfighter:
- look down and check your ship's controls and radar,
- turn your head to see the enemy approaching,
- barrel roll and dodge some shots, with your eyes still focused on the attackers,
- fly close to an asteroid (look up briefly to check the distance) to shake them off,
- lean to the side and look down to see your prey below,
- roll again (don't get sick!) and engage!
- Kaboom! :D

The game is still in development, some parts are far from being balanced, but the developers are very responsive and they still have awesome (almost creepy) ideas in mind on how to deliver an even better VR experience than they already do.

Their marketing, however, is a glaring understatement. The trailer is not even close to showing the full potential of VR free look and lean, although much of it is already implemented in this game.
If you try the game, I urgently recommend you experiment with your VR possibilities:
Don't just sit there staring straight forward! Look! Move! Roll! (Maybe get dizzy!)

I hope the game still gets better (more content/variety, balancing etc.), but even if it stayed like this (in it's very unfinished state) I would not regret buying it.

I say 'small / large' because the act of making this game enjoyable is actually very small but it makes such a huge difference. The game was supposedly designed with a gamepad in mind but it operates in a way that is completely odd if true. Re-mapping the controls is simple enough and makes the game about a billion times better. If you have a HOTAS, then better yet, but to be honest, even re-mapping the gamepad controls more to your liking improves the experience exponentially.

Once you have this issue out of the way, you'll find it is actually more polished than some of the reviews would lead you to believe. There is no doubt that the developer is committed to making this game as good as it can be, and from what I hear, it gets better with each update. I hope you can purchase with confidence with a good level of on-going support.

I recommend you give this game a try as it certainly has me intruiged and is a fair price for anyone who is a fan of space combat, especially since I'm sure it will only get much more content over the coming months!

Only got into the opening training bits so far.

The tutorial could be a bit better as it's not really explained how to move around at the beginning (using an Xbox One controller). I went through about 1/2 of the training missions, learning the basics before jumping off into a SCRAMBLE mode mission. The Macross/Gundam/BattlestarGalactica fan in me couldn't resist the whole ""SCRAMBLE!"" thing. Hello learning curve! Basically if a space fly veers off course and hits you, you'll be blown up! Superfly! Banzai! (+1 if you got that reference!) Well, maybe not that bad. I managed to eliminate 2 of 3 ships before dying. The gameplay itself though is good once you know what you're doing, and it looks decent enough.

The menus are the usual annoying look at what you want and press a button which I could live without. I'd get it if it looked like I was in a hanger and looked at the area I wanted to go to, but that's not what this is. After completing a mission you're sent back to the start of the menus instead of where you last were.

For $13, I really can't find a reason to not recommend this if you like these sorts of games. No, it doesn't feel as polished say say, Elite: Dangerous, but this is a smaller game overall, and once you figure out the controls which are poorly explained, you'll be on your way.

Really nice, especially since i'm not into learning a plethora of controls.

Just flying around looking out of the side window and seeing one of the larger ships pass by feels awesome.
No problems with motion sickness so far, and positioning of the head is correct on my setup.

It's definitely work in progress, some glitches.  
The spacecrafts turn to fast for my taste, shields are missing.
But there's definitely already a lot of content in there, more than in some of the higher priced titles.

I hope it goes a little more to the simulation side, considering the aerodynamics and the whole setting up your ship thing. Choosing weapons, managing shields etc. would be nice.

[u] DISCLAIMER! [/u] 
I got a Steam Key from the developer. 
HOWEVER, I got it for Beta Testing purposes. I am Beta-testing the Mac version. I will also be naming some cons. I'm not biased ;)

But, since I tried it out on my gaming PC, I thought I might as well leave a review.

[b] On with the review! [/b]


First of all, the pros. 

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
	[*]Good graphics! Because itâs made in Unreal4, thatâs to be expected. 
	[*]Voice acting is surprisingly good ^-^
	[*]Quite a few different ships (6 in total)
	[*]Cool sound effects
        [*]Easy to install! Worked on DK2 very well. 
        [*]Works well with the Steam Controller.
        [*]Each ship is super different. They each have a different HUD, speeds, and sometimes different weapons. 
        [*]Stealth mode is awesome! You can't see through your windows, but use a black and orange monitor to navigate! And the sounds it make add to the atmosphere! 
[/list]

[b] Mediocre: [/b]
[list]
	[*]Between loading screens, you have the default, endless, white void of the Steam VR set up. Not a real problem, but worth mentioning. This is a problem with SteamVR, not the game.
[/list]

[b] Cons: [/b]
[list]
        [*][strike]The crosshair is off centre. This might just be because of my set-up, but Iâm not too sure.[/strike]
	[*]Sometimes there is a bit of doublevision. Might just be because I am using a DK2.
        [*]Some of the ships don't have the Stealth/Scout/Fighting/Flying modes. This might just be because of the type of ship, but it is something I noticed. Makes the Scout/Combat Fighter a bit less interesting.
        [*]Crazy fast AI Pilots!
[/list]

(Update: Aiming is fine. By moving my head down a little, the laser aligned with the crosshair. Hence why I removed that from the cons)

[u] Note to the devs! [/u]
The minumum requirements might be able to go down a little, as my GTX970 handelled it easily on highest graphics. But that might require further testing to find out if it can indeed be lowered. 



Anyway, I do recommend it. 
Right now itâs a  7/10. 
With the cons fixed Iâll up it to an 8/10 or a 9/10.",1463067202,1463129938,True,5,0,0.524874269962310791,3,False,True,True,False,,1501118367.0,"Thank you for your feedback.

I was actually shocked when I got into the game and was blown away by the scale and feel of the environments.  It definitely feels like early access right now but that's because it is.  You can see this in some of the UI, the AI is predictable and parts of the game aren't accessible yet but the potential is there to see.  One complaint I recall was about there being no content, however that is not what I found and when I checked the hours played of that review, it was under 10 minutes.  I wasn't even flying out of the first hanger in 10 minutes with the database and just hanging around.  Once you get going, this game does have a lot to offer.  I was particularly impressed with the music.  It was not over-bearing and sounds professionally mixed, giving an ambience that set the scene as you controlled your way out of the claustrophic shuttle bay and majestically burst into a huge and artistically displayed zone in space.  One question I asked myself was do I prefer this or Eve:Valkyrie?  Well both seem too different to me.  Eve feels more like a VR experience on rails where Starfighter plays more like a game in VR.  Considering the AAA money and talent that went into Eve:Valkyrie, it says a lot about the indie scene and this developer in particular.

I am going to try to keep this fairly simple due to the fact that I wrote a massive suggestion that was posted in the Suggestions Forum.  But I will try to simplify it for the sake of this review.

Steam is telling me that I have 0 hours played.  I finally found the time to sit down with the game and played for a solid hour and a half.  The only reason I stopped to be honest was because I needed to give my brain a break from VR.  I haven't even looked through the database content yet.

The quick version is that I had a ton of fun in that hour and a half. The game is very reponsive and beautiful to look at.  Great sense of scale and immersion.  Love the sound assets (non-music).  All in all it's a fun time.  The framework and foundation is very solid.

With that being said the game is in Early Access and there is still a bit of work to be done.  As mentioned I posted a very large write up in the suggestions forum. so if you are interested you should go check it out.

The plus side is that the developer is working to fix issues that people are having, lots of updates and is listening to feedback.  My personal experience was smooth, no bugs or performance issues.  Everything loaded quick and was on point.  Keep in mind that you do need a pretty beefy machine to run VR properly (I am running an AMD FX 6350, 8gb RAM and a 980ti). 

With more development in the Early Access phase of this project I think that this title has the potential to be an amazing VR expirence.  Don't count this title out, afterall it's one guy doing the work.

I guess the bottom line is that I had fun and can't wait to see where the game goes from here.",1461980944,1461980944,True,15,0,0.542827367782592773,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Got VR?  Want to go on exciting missions as a space fighter pilot?  Want to immerse yourself in a fantastically rendered, battle hardened universe, where you are a member of a topflight squad?  Then this game is for you!  

This may be indie, but the immersion and the gameplay are top notch!  Works great with my H.O.T.A.S  and I got totally lost in the CDF Database, looking through all the ships and space stations.  Clearly a lot of thought and love has gone into the lore and backstory for this game.  

The dev is approachable and is open to feedback and suggestions from the community.  Iâm having fun with the game and eagerly awaiting updates - I can see myself losing many hours in the CDF universe as it moves towards a full release title.

There is currently a lot of content to explore- different mission types, and playable ships.  The VR scaling is good and you can see the basis of what could be a great game.

There are still some issues of course (early access) but I can now recommend this game, the parts that are currently playable are fun and the developer seems committed to responding to bugs and pushing the game forward.

That's nice to see. 

I will be returning home over the next 48 hours so i will re-purchase this game and try it on my vive.

Updated review:

I can see their have been a lot of improvements since I first tried this a few months ago.

What's lacking for me:

HOTAS Control.  I use the very popular X-52 Pro and can't use it because currently CDF only works with HOTAS X whatever that is?

NAILS needs to implement custom bindings for joystick rather than setting a number of preset profiles for a few select HOTAS.

It took Eve Valkyrie devs a while to do this and they are a big team.  Hopefully NAILS will figure out how to implement custom mapping of controls other than xbox controller.

There is another single developer game Vector 36 running on Unity engine and that lets the user assign whatever controls to any HOTAS.

The other thing needed I think is better engine sound with low frequency content.  I use a body vibration system that is fed from any low frequencies in games like explosions, engine sounds etc.  The sound in cockpit is currently a bit flat.

There is an increased sense of speed which is good... perhaps even more would be possible.  Elite uses star dust streaking past to give sensation of speed and the speeds look and feel higher (should be able to whizz past asteroids much quicker than currently possible).

I like the improved menus and the cockpit.",1460799057,1464296529,True,5,1,0.406972259283065796,8,True,False,True,False,,,
