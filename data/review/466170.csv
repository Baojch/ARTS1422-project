Its been around for years and has tons of content and challenges to get through. There's a pretty complete wiki, which you'll need.

A particularly nice feature of the game is that both quick and slow resets are actually useful at any given time. There is always progress being made.

One negative I can see is that it will take you a very very long time IRL to unlock a lot of this content. This is only a negative if you're looking for an idle game that has an end / finish to it. If you're looking for something that perpetually has more and more things for you to do

Another negative is that with so much content you'll get confused even with the reasonably complete wiki. Certain helpful things that can speed you up a lot may get missed. In my case, it took me a long time to realize just how powerful training your pets could be. Im sure there are other inefficiencies I'm overlooking as well. But thankfully you can have a good time with this game even blundering about like I am.

Actually there is one more negative that I almost forgot. Because of the long term time scale this game works at, some of the challenges are.... rough. Specifically I mean your first Ultimate Baal Challenge. Its recommended as one of the first challenges you can do and its quite unforgiving. Resets everything back to start and you have to fight through the gods again. Wiki says it'll take a week, it took me two. It's way beyond what you might be expecting from a ""prestige"" reset. Is it worth it? Yes, Crystal Factory will quickly become absurdly powerful. Do I wish the game and/or wiki was more explicit in saying ""prepare your anus""? Yes. The only reason I stuck with it is because I had other negative reviews complaining about it so I was expecting it.

Overall this is the best idler I've played, for the sort of idler I'm interested in. Long term, happily hands off, with lots of content and complicated systems. Just remember that JFC the UBC is a PITA, SMH.",1711809060,1711809060,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

The most important thing to understand is that this game was pratically finished a long ago, but it got extended with new mechanics over the time once the dev noticed that launching new games is a risky endeavour (see their next game: cooking game)

If you only play the original, now called the early game - about P.Baal and some challange runs -  where focus is more on your character itself getting stronger and learning god powers - then you will be for a really fun and imaginative idler.

But latter content diverts from the theme and power scale... you get pets (and waifus)  that train, get classes, go in dungeons, and build a city; you get a planetary factory that need to be defended by your clones and not yourself; those doesn't make sense when you are a god creating stars and finger flicking entire phanteons.

Also a lot of those latter mechanics exacerbate the game's main flaw - and probably the reason people say this games requires too much active play - rebirth requires too much agenda and forward planning. Let me describe some things that you need to consider:

- from a normal rebirth to a somewhat decent pace is not a fast process because you need to recreate and alocate your shadow clones (can be some minutes to some hours depending on how you spent your gp)
- not all mechanics/clone assigment unlock instally depending on your power at the moment, you may need to wait to build the div. generator for example
- if you get pets in dungeons or campains, its best to wait these to finish (and remember to pick the rewards!) before even rebirthing - and those can be really major problems as you need to set beforehand their duration (as know as guess when you will come back) in hours, up to 12. You can easly be blocked from rebirthing for hours.
- you may soon have to defend your factory from some ultimate beings - this gives a good reward... wait some extra minutes
- you may also need to wait your pets to be at the right hunger threshold so they grow stronger faster

This shows that game's definition of hardcore is less in form of complex mechanics interacting withother and finding the optimal investiment; and more in from of timing your activities so you get the best rewards.

This all makes for idler that you don't play when you get a opportunity, but a game that gives you opportunities to play it from time to time... and this is not what most people expect from a idler...",1710880342,1710884562,False,8,0,0.580334484577178955,3,False,False,False,True,,,

The Challenges keep the gameplay loop of ""watch numbers grow larger"" really fresh and entertaining, as each  challenge makes you more powerful.

Only minus is that the game will throw a lot of information at you, once you unlock a new mechanic.
It is kinda hard to explain, so if you're curious download the game, defeat the first god and see for yourself if what you've just unlocked is a bit overwhelming.
If you do, don't worry, just focus on the main mechanics introduced to you at the beginning and get used to the new mechanics slowly.
It is a very, very long idling game, not using a new mechanic propperly for a couple of days, or even weeks, means basically nothing in the great scheme of things.
I've played through 1.000 hours of this game and have unlocked maybe half of the mechanics this game has to offer. And I'll probably have to play for 10x that amount to play through all of the content this game has to offer.
So, yeah. Take you're time, it's an idler after all.

In terms of P2W.
There is a shop and you can pay for progress, if you want to.
I'll give this one a pass, since not buying from the shop doesn't take away from your gameplay experience, imo. And I honestly couldn't care less, if someone actually decides to spend their money for progressing in a single player idle game.

Only thing I bought there was ""improved next at"". Not because I really had to (could have gotten it for free after playing for a little longer), but because it's a little tradition of mine. Whenever I enjoy a F2P game, I buy one or two things from the shop to show my appreciation towards the developer.

In case the developer reads this comment. Thanks a bunch for your efforts.

When it comes to the perfect apple pie there are 2 questions you need to ask. What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust.

BEST APPLES FOR PIE
There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store!

Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush.
Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process.
Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety.
Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others.
Jonagold - A little tart and sweet.
Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet.
THE PERFECT PIE CRUST

A great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust. Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat!

The crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie.

If you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily.

HOW TO MAKE APPLE PIE FROM SCRATCH
Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F.

Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12"" circle that is ⅛"" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate.

Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl. Spread the apple slices evenly.

Apple slices in the bottom of the pie crust.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12"" circle that is ⅛"" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling.

Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in.


Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust.


In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38"" long) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise. Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a ""pie shield"".


A strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking.
Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes.

You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan.

TIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish.


HOW TO STORE
The pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

It said I have a billion shadow clones from the game I couldn't reset, but won't tell me what they're for.  This is stupid.

Edit in response to Dev:  Maybe I embellished the exact number a bit.  My apologies. 
 But the number was quite high in ""multiple digit land"".  My review was out of frustration.  I have no doubt that it must be something good for all the positive reviews.  But I didn't get that first impression with your game.

I basically remember when I first launched it, I felt strongly overwhelmed with all that was going on, without me even triggering anything from the start.  (It was counting up so fast, I was like ""WTH, what am I supposed to do now?""  So I closed it right away and decided to come back to it when I could.  But that wasn't for a month or so.

So I relaunched it, and it showed Shadow Clones WAY up there.  I tried to give it a second shot at trying to figure things out, but there didn't seem to be any guidance.  (I assumed that maybe I killed whatever tutorial there was by shutting the game down prematurely the first time.)  I also tried to find settings to try over again from the beginning, but couldn't find anything.

Maybe if there was some kind of backstory, or explanation as to what-does-what, I would've spent more time with it.  But there didn't seem to be any of that.  So I gave up again and uninstalled it.

I would definitely give it a 3rd try if there was something to make it less confusing, and tell me what I looking at.",1688846700,1690260056,False,1,0,0.372361600399017334,0,False,False,False,True,,1690252089.0,"Having 1 billion shadow clones without playing for years is kinda impossible to get.
Maybe you are confusing it with something else. You can easily reset your game if you either delete it on your pc and then start it without sync online or go to the settings and select reset game.

The tooltips and many info pages and the FAQ pages ingame explain a lot of stuff if you read a bit. The game also has a Wiki with lots of in-depht info: https://itrtg.wiki.gg/wiki/Main_Page"

Кину рецепт Квас из цикория в домашних условиях


Продукты
Вода 3л
Сахар 200 гр.
Цикорий 1 стол. л.
Сухие дрожжи 1 чайн. л.
Лимонная Кислота 0.5 чайн. л.


В глубокую кастрюлю всыпьте цикорий, сахар и лимонную кислоту влейте воду и перемешайте.
Поставьте кастрюлю на средний огонь и доведите смесь до кипения.
Как только раствор закипит, уберите кастрюлю с огня и охладите при комнатной температуре до 37-40°С. Проверить температуру при отсутствии специального термометра можно следующим образом: капните жидкость на запястье. Если капля чуть теплая, значит смесь охладилась до нужной температуры.
Когда вода остынет, рассыпьте сухие дрожжи по поверхности. Когда дрожжи напитаются влагой, перемешайте. Дрожжи перед применением лучше проверить. Небольшое количество дрожжей нужно залить чуть теплой подслащенной водой (37-40°С) и оставить на 10-15 минут. Должна появиться пенная шапочка. Это значит, что дрожжи живые, не просроченные. Если шапочки нет, то такие дрожжи не стоит использовать. Квас не получится.
Кастрюлю накройте марлей или прикройте крышкой и оставьте квас при комнатной температуре на 6 часов.
По истечении 6 часов на поверхности появится пенка. Это значит, что дрожжи активизировались.
Разлейте квас по бутылкам или банкам, закройте крышками и отправьте их в холодильник на 1-2 дня.
Разлейте охлажденный напиток по стаканам и подавайте к столу. Если закрытую бутылку вынуть из холодильника и оставить при комнатной температуре, то, согревшись, брожение снова активизируется и квас начнет бродить дальше.

I've mostly enjoyed my time with it except for some key issues and some issues which I simply can't stand any longer with the game.
I'll talk about the three main reasons why I am stopping with playing this game/idler and why I don't recommend it, 1. I first discovered that it was constantly attempting to connect to the maker's website (shugasu.net) which was getting caught by my protection software as a site that gives off an Error code: SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG message when attempting to connect to it via browser. Which is impossible to stop the program from attempting to do so through the game settings as a result I blocked the application from having any internet access via window's internet outbound rules.
2. Now this is where I found out why the game is not actually a good idler game and why it's constantly attempting to connect to the website, the maker stores your cloud data and saves that enable offline progress it seems (I don't know for sure) as I never got offline progression in this game before I even fully blocked the application, there are not calculations done like in Trimps or Your Chronicle for your offline progression. That added in with the fact that some bits of the game aren't even built that well I believe for an idler make this worse as before you've gotten to beating a certain powerful water god you are rebirthing very often with a few hours between each one, add on that you got new features that takes a few hours to get going with or some that require things you've not unlocked yet means that these new features are useless and barely make any impact at all. I rushed for the divinity generator and by the time I had just begun getting an hour on it's time till empty was I at the point where I needed to reset, but the divinity I had gotten was then useless since it has no effect seemingly on rebirthing. 
3. Graphic card abuse, I don't know why but for some reason whenever I let this game go to above 10FPS in the settings for the AFK mode with black screen or AFK mode off, the game would be attempting to use 80% of my graphics card's 3D capacity when at 10FPS or lower it would use maybe 3-5%. Why? I have no idea but it's been the last straw for me. As I see no reason for a game that's a mobile port to be doing this to a PC.

Okay with that all said here's a few other things that have been bugging me with the game and it's design: Pets are useless in the early game when you first unlock them as they get you so little before you have to rebirth and it's annoying to train them since if the difficulty is too hard the pets stay dead and gain no exp (if you make it too easy then you need more clones than you should spend on them) campaigns are a bit useful if you get lucky; BIG pay to progress aspect with that you have a cap on how many clones you can have that you can increase via god power which is buyable or you can earn maybe....10 at most each rebirth if you haven't met Zeus yet...this cap slows you down alot as you already have to grind up to that cap to begin with which takes a fair bit a time wasted with letting clones die off.",1674514816,1674514816,False,17,0,0.570440828800201416,15,False,False,False,True,,1683016733.0,"As for your issues with the security concern. 

The error ssl_error_rx_record_too_long might be caused by a wrong browser configuration or an add-on. You can try to delete cookies or browser might not be up to date.

Otherwise the cloud saves are hosted on a shared hoster and some other website which had the same ip had a hacker on their wordpress page which caused some virus scanners so show security warnings for that ip, even if it had nothing to do with my cloud saves.

You can check that even here: https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/188.40.30.32?page=1#report
Currently the confidence of abuse is even 0%, although there was again a brute-force attemt to their wordpress page. I do not use wordpress, though so it is a different user from that shared hoster. I guess shared hosting always has the risk that someone else on that hoster causes problems, but going to a different hoster now or host it myself would be rather time consuming and risks for players to lose their online saves. You could also check https://shugasu.net/ on virustotal or other pages to see that the page is clean.

Also other than some virus scanners not liking that there were hacking attemps on the word press page from the other users there is not issue so far.

This makes strategizing and optimizing very fun and challenging. This is supported by the huge amount of creative challenges that put different spins on the game and force you to always adapt your strategies.  Lastly one of the most important factor of idlegames: Progression. There is always something to do in ITRTG and you always feel a sense of progress.

The game starts off pretty slow and simple, with strong similiarities to NGU Idle. It almost seems like a worse NGU. After a few rebirths (read: several hours, maybe 2 or 3 days) the mechanics start to open up more and differentiate it. I tentatively recommend it but I have some gripes.

If you're already a fan of incremental games, you may well like this. You should know, of course, that this is a very long-term game. If you dislike idle/incremental games.... Well, you probably won't like it. 

I'm almost to the end of the ""tutorial"", defeating the final god, Tyrant Overlord Baal. I can't review the entire scope of the game, as I still have several menus/mechanics to unlock, and the real meat of the game to explore. While I expect to keep playing this for... probably at least several weeks, maybe a few months, I already have some major gripes I would share.

First, guidance and explanation is scarce. I was able to get started without much outside help thanks to tooltips and basic advice from the game's help menu, but I constantly had questions I couldn't find answers to, even when looking online.

Second, the real money transactions. The value is a fcking joke. Can't even call these microtransactions, and you're not getting much in return. They exist solely to suck $$$ out of people with more money than sense, or just too wealthy to balk at the prices. I have spent $60+ on NGU Idle, so I'm not afraid to whale a bit on a F2P game, but I wouldn't even consider it for ITRTG.

Try it if you think you're into this sort of game. Otherwise, you'll probably get bored before it gets particularly interesting.",1665620830,1665620830,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

何をしていても少しずつ強くなれるので手探りで大丈夫です

日本語化はされていませんが、日本語wikiが充実しています

悪い点
バランス調整が上手いとも言えますが、クリッカーにありがちなインフレは他よりも緩やかです
視覚的な変化は数字が主になります、派手さを期待するなら別のクリッカーのほうが良いです
イラストにそこまで魅力はありません、作者が頑張って書いているようです

progression is slow, and you have 5-6 different modifiers to deal with.
it's a rebirth style idle game, but you have to rebirth often, so it takes you a long time to get anywhere and do anything.

did you take care of your pets?
did you craft enough shadow clones?
did you fight enough monsters in the fight monster tab (literally just a bar that gets smaller, and a generic monster name (at least ngu idle manages to be quirky and actually funny)
did you defeat enough gods?
did you level attack and defense enough?

did you save up enough god points? you get 3-5 per rebirth in early game, so you need more.

you can buy certain stuff... after you have enough of a currency to make the option APPEAR in the ""shop""

apparently mobile players have an advantage: they can create things offline. 
PC players have a 300% boost that is shorter than 1/3 of the time offline
PC players can't watch commercials to gain god power (unless wink wink)

the name of the game is ""idle"" but if you are active you actually gain more divinity and a few god power

some things have non mentioned requirements. for example for building a divinity generator you need to beat a certain god... except that is NOT all. you also have to build 1 of all but the last monument, which requires time (and clones to build) and resources

the start might seem slow... until you get to ""challenges"", ""dungeons"" etc.

Pets start out being essentially useless, like most features. However, unlike other features, you will be spending at least 3 months grinding out pet campaigns to make your pets and their bonuses useful. Likewise, you will often be delaying a rebirth just so you can feed your pets to make their bonuses bigger. Then, you unlock dungeons, another slow burn grind from Hell. Additionally, each individual permanent buy in the Pet Shop takes months of heavy grinding just to afford one purchase. Finally, some of those buys can be bought multiple times.

Pet campaigns run by timers with the lowest being 1 hour and the highest being 12 hours. Most of the time, you'll be rebirthing every hour to push for more God Power farming to buy faster create and build speeds. Also, your pets' growth stats seem to affect the rewards they can bring back from campaigns. For new players, most of the campaigns are fuck-all useless. 

Item campaign? Your 5 pets bring back 100ish pet stones while the most permanent Pet Shop buys cost over 200k pet stones. Food campaign? Excluding shitty free food, all the food you farm here disappears upon rebirth until you farm stones and dungeons for 4+ months to buy the refrigerator upgrade in the Pet Shop. Level campaign? Your pets' levels reset on rebirth and clones are faster leveling. Growth campaign? Useless when you send a 24k total growth pet in with a 4k total growth pet and only see a gain of 6~ total growth after 12 hours. Divinity campaign? Never ran it since it I have the divinity generator. God Power campaign? Useless since a new player's pets can only find a MAX of 1 God Power per pet. Multiplier campaign? Literally the only useful campaign.

Now, lets talk challenges. They're unlocked when you beat the final god, Tyrant Overlord Baal. You're immediately recommended to do the Ultimate Baal Challenge, UBC for short, to unlock the Crystal Factory. This challenge takes a huge steamy shit all over everything you worked to accomplish. God Power and God Power upgrades? Locked away. Pets? Disabled. Might? Suppressed. Crystal Factory? Nope! That big bad army of clones you have? Reduced to the starting cap of 1,000. This challenge is literally as if you had started the game over at the beginning. Oh, wait, no it isn't. It's even harder since those pet multipliers you busted your ass to improve to boost your stats are DISABLED! The dev picked a heck of a way to say ""F*** you and the time you invested to get here!"". Then, there's the kick in the balls that you have to do the challenge 50 times for the full clear bonus. This is not a challenge. This is Hell.

Finally, let's say you decide to say ""screw that noise!"" and use Cheat Engine to bypass the garbage mentioned above. Change a single value and your title is permanently changed to ""Cheating God/Goddess"". If that doesn't bother you, God Power is mildly obscured with a small integer tacked onto the real value of your God Power. Regardless, this effectively means you can't play ""your way"" instead of the dev's way without the game trying to shame you for it with a stupid title. Nevermind the fact this is a SINGLEPLAYER GAME.

I can not recommend this because of the absurdly long grind times for Pet Shop unlocks, challenge-related bullshit, and anti-cheat bullshit. I don't know where idle devs get the idea that their player base is made of infinite time but we aren't. Lorewise, our character is but we are not. I wish idle devs would hurry up and realize that already.

EDIT: Ok, I gave the game the benefit of the doubt and played for a bit longer. I regret it very much.

This is in response to the dev response in the comment section:

1 hour rebirths are kind of bad? Seriously? So, what is a noob supposed to do when struggling for GP to get a high enough clone count for the factory? Pick 1 of 30~ challenges with rewards that feel lackluster and demand 20-50 completions per challenge? Sit around and do nothing while waiting for UBs to attack while building a black hole for 1 GP on rebirth and picking up 1 GP per hour from a crystal while making more crystals? Around 90% of the game feels entirely dependent on GP buys and UBs do NOT stack up against the gains in GP and Baal Power from clearing P. Baal V40 every hour. Naturally, this isn't even factoring in farming Baal Power for Light Clones to even TRY to make use of the Space Dim.

Now, let me explain why pets got such a harsh review. 3 hours of almost pure waiting just to feed them for...what? 1.5 base growth for 4.5 total base growth with Mighty Food? *rolls eyes* 

Let's do some math using a base Undine in an example that assumes Gold Dragon is NOT unlocked. The example will center around Undine's growth bonuses from being given the required souls and necessary feedings to simply evolve the pet.

Food: Mighty Food with no sauce
DPC bonus: 25%
Growth per feed: 1.875/5.625

Starting T. Growth: -11,111/-33,333
Evolve to V2 for +3,333 T. Growth:-7,778/-23,334
Evolve to V3 for +3,334 T. Growth:-4,444/-13,332
Evolve to V4 for +4,444 T. Growth:0/0
Evolve to V5 for +5,555 T. Growth:5,555/16,665
Evolve to V6 for +5,556 T. Growth:11,111/33,333

This leaves 22,222 T. Growth for the evolution requirement that MUST come from feeding since the Growth Campaign feels like the rewards for the time spent waiting is total shit.

22,222 / 5.625(Mighty Food)=3,951 feedings, rounded up from 3,950.57
3 hours * 3,951 feedings = 11,853 hours
11,853 hours / 24 hours = 493.875 days (1.3 years)

Naturally, this assumes the player will NEVER touch DPC for that 50% max bonus or anything else that affects pet growth. Likewise, this isn't even attempting to factor in the time requirements to craft the souls, farming the dungeon mats needed to craft the souls, farming the nevermelting ice for evolving Undine, or fixing your alchemists who got screwed for unlocking Undine in the first place. Hopefully, you get my point; you're either way far into the game or you get fucked for even TRYING to do anything with Undine.

Side note: There are seemingly zero hints as to where to get Shadow Essence or Magic Shadow Essence. So, you either spoil it with the wiki(like I did), spoil it with advice from others, or stumble across the answer out of pure luck.

Guess what? That 33.3k T. Growth is also leagues ahead of any other unlockable base growth pet by around 8k~ T. Growth. Should I do the math to see how long the above math would take for a pet to gain 8k T. Growth? Sure, let's run the math for some perspective.

Food used: Mighty Food
DPC bonus: 25%
Growth per feed: 1.875/5.625

8,000 / 5.625(Mighty Food) = 1,423 feedings, rounded up from 1,422.22
3 * 1,423 = 4,269 hours
4,269 hours / 24 hours = 177.875 days (6~ months)

So, half a damn year for a noob to gain the first inch towards starting to make campaigns feel worthwhile. Again, this doesn't factor in rerunning DPC or anything else that affects pet growth. Likewise, this doesn't factor in all the time spent running the Food Campaign only to lose all your food on rebirth because you're a pleb who hasn't finished the 6~ month long grind of 1,500 nevermelting ice and 250k pet stones to buy the refrigerator. I'm also not factoring in how rebirthing resets the damn hunger gauge while screwing over campaigns and dungeons either. This isn't even looking at the minuscule gains per feeding in percentage format or how those minuscule gains feel practically worthless.

Hilariously, this is just me mostly talking about how you've padded the grind to improve campaign rewards with absolute shit growth rates for pets. I can also delve into how some of the other features are frustratingly borderline useless when first unlocked, if you'd like. My final point is this; a feature should never, *ever* take a damn year to finally to start showing signs that your work *might* pay off.",1645126960,1646807783,False,73,10,0.734072685241699219,13,False,False,False,False,,1646183312.0,"It probably would have been easier to look at some guides how to progress faster or join discord to talk and get info about strategies.

While the game is rather slow, it is by far not as bad as you write. The game is a lot about what you do when in this game and how efficiently you manage your stats..1 hour rebirths are kinda bad in almost all cases for example.

An UBC for example is doable within less than a day each if you do it at the right time. It is also only one of a few challenges which takes away most stats temporarily. The first UBC takes a few days longer, but the other 49 are usually done much later and you can finish the other 49 of them within 1-2 months.

Someone who plays with the right strategy can finish everything in the game, get all pets and all pet stone upgrades within 2 years without spending money or cheating. While someone who plays inefficent and does not know what to do would never get that far."

You are incarnating a weak-ass human that survived a post-apocalyptic war and learnt how to create clones of himself to become strong. You will face gods that are increasingly difficult to beat but doing so will help you progress.
Your first goal will be to beat Tyrant Overlord Baal ; the strongest god.
After beating him, a whole new world will appear to you and you will be able to make your ""God"" even stronger.

You will never end the game since there is a system of challenges with different rules every time, some take days/weeks, others take hours.

What I like about this game is that even if you are totally stranger to this kind of game you will probably get addicted to it, past the few first hours.

If you are someone that likes to minmax everything, you will have room to do so considering the enormous amount of variables that this game possess. 
If you are someone who just want to chill, well you can do so, your progress will just be slower.

My playtime is at 2000 hours when I write this but when I started I was totally clueless and there were not as many features (4.6 years ago), so I lost a lot of time.

Den Großteil der Spielzeit wird man afk verbringen, das Spiel läuft im Hintergrund weiter. 

Das Spiel ist größtenteils Interface, wo du Einstellungen machen kannst. Es gibt kein live-play. 
Du bist der letzte Überlebende deines Planetens und hast die Fähigkeit, Schattenklone deiner selbst zu entwickeln. Jedes dieser trägt einen Teil deiner Seele, wenn sie sterben, kehrt dieser Teil zu dir zurück, sowie alle gesammelte Erfahrung. Durch diese Möglichkeit, dich zu stärken ohne dich selbst in Gefahr zu bringen, sowie der Fähigkeit, deine Seele in einen neuen, jüngeren Körper zu versetzen (welches Unsterblichkeit gleicht), wirst du zu einem Gott. In diesen Universen gibt es viele Götter und du stehst ganz unten. Langsam arbeitet man sich nach oben. Jedes Mal, wenn man sich in einem neuen Körper versetzt (""Rebirth""), verliert man zwar den Großteil des Fortschritts, aber je nach dem wie viel man erreicht hat, kommt man sehr viel schneller voran. Das Spiel hat unzählige Möglichkeiten, Spaß zu machen, von Skills über Challenges bis zu Pets, die man trainieren kann und die dann sogar deine eigenen Stats drastisch vervielfachen können. 
Dazu gibt es jedes Mal, wenn du einen weiteren Gott besiegst, ein neues Kapitel der Storyline, das du lesen kannst. Diese sind auch toll und interessant geschrieben und geben dem ganzen noch etwas Tiefe. 
Insgesamt sind die Texte des Spieles ziemlich ironisch humorvoll geschrieben, was das Ganze (zumindest für mich) noch einmal aufwertet.

游戏对于各种语言的本地化由于作者仅有一人  且代码需要重写  翻译需要找人  更新需要维护  所以是没有想法的   不仅仅是针对中文  而是所有语种  对于只有英文的现状     
作者并没有歧视任何国家的人   其本身也是德国人

I've tried playing the game a few years ago as well and was not attracted since it didn't had any good graphics or didn't seem to have any lore or anything. But now was convinced by a friend to try it again after, he explained to me the basics and where is the lore as well (yes it has a lore) and i've reached the moment where i would play this game even if i didn't had any friends that would play it just to see what else is there to unlock and at some point to read all of the lore which i'm to lazy to finish reading.
The more i play the game the more i notice that it's bigger and bigger, there is a big learning curve and each step you make doesn't feel like the increase gain is big, this game can only be played with small steps and only looking at the bigger picture you would notice that you are becoming stronger. Quite ironic to say that in this game the users knowledge and skill is quite important and not just how strong you are in the game, since you need to understand what you need and when you need, how to upgrade and when to upgrade, overall it's just learning and it's a steep learning curve.

As you learn the systems, you can automate various aspects of your play, but there's a good amount of strategy and maual imput to every session (and no pontless clicking – it's a management game rather that a plain time-waster). Also, you can progress both by intensive micromanagement and frequent resets, or very long periods of passive growth, depending on what you prefer.

The visuals are very simple, but the minimalism makes the game light and resposive, while still offering some customisation and flavour that helps it to not seem utterly generic. The developer seems very dedicated and willing to deliver updates. I kind of had my fill after a few days, but I can easily see why people might tinker with this for literal months – even after dozens of hours there are new things to learn and layers of gameplay to uncover, and there are likely to be even more additions in the future.

I even helped a bit with making NGU at the beginning. You can check it in NGU in the credits. So it can't be a cheap copy. If anything, it is the other way around.

Also which upgrades don't feel worth it? With only 86 hours of playtime you probably didn't beat baal yet and didn't even unlock most of the upgrades.

It has some similarities and some things are different. NGU is mroe casual friendly, while ITRTG is a bit more hardcore. ITRTG is also a longer game but it is easier to make mistakes and play not optimal.

Beating the challenges hugely increases your power in the end. And challenges don't really reset your progress, only some parts of it, which you get back rather fast. But the game has a lot of strategic choices and if you do the wrong challenges at the wrong time, or rebirth too slowly, you progress a lot slower in the end. 

Also the increased achievements was something a lot of players wanted and I only added them because of that. I also have no idea how more achievements reduce any progress. It just means you can get more than before and not less."

Let's analyze step-by-step.

1) Challenges, that rewards you something permanent for complection. Rewards for single complection often too small for making notable change, so, you need to complete most challenges several times. Is it problem? By itself- no, there are many different challenges, the entire gameplay you spend time during challenges. Problems appear with fact- you need to click insane times to complete some challenges- so, even if you are allmighty god, you cannot finish easy challenges by idle- you need to manual click every action. How many times it can be fine even taking into account the rest from the game? Answer  is disappointing.
2) There are simple lottery system, lucky draw. The best reward- 300.000 pet stones- have very low chance (≈0.17%), but partially nigilates by high draws count. I had noted, that for a season I was very lucky- probability worked from week to week. But last 4 months of everyday gaming I had no procs! What is it? Balancing bug of old broken increased probability? Donation luring? Random?
If it just true RNG then garant system should exist, like lucky draw pet from 2000 draws. I have decreased feeling of joy from very often drops and increased feeling sad from no procs from month to month.
My own, may be wrong opinion: I don't believe it was RNG.
3) Pet manipulation requires a lot of clicks. Some time ago campaing start was drastically simplified, BUT there are dungeons (you need to claim rewards, feed pets, choose dungeon, (time optionally) and click start for every dungeon team! Restart dungeon button is useless as long as requires even more clicks!) and recently released pet tavern activities, that requires individual pet choosing and if necessary, replacement! Every day!
4) Ingame changes can be proposed by discord voting. I was able to offer implemented new challenge (True God Skip Challenge, hey), but my offer to very slightly reform the third point met opposition. Why? Because voters usually are game lovers which are very loyal and conservative. Idlers meet future, but ItRtG stays in 2016, it doesn't matter if the game has a lot of mechanics if the basic ones exhaust the player. As a result, recent steam reviews show minimum new player interest.

As a conclusion. Only reforming able to save this great game with big perspectives. Slowness is not a problem only if minimum player actions required- but now, game will exhaust you. At first glance it is clear that the creator is not even trying to play this game. Idle games shouldn't be work, but relax. No old player would leave after simplification and automatisation of game actions, so what's the problem?
I will return only after automatisaon were implemented.",1631640639,1663201204,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Additionally, your Distribute buttons are not uniform in their behaviour; as the Pets Clones will Distribute ""to Capacity of"" whilst the Divinity Generator Upgrades are Distributing ""additional clones"", which means 5000 Pet clones will always Distribute up to 5000, however; 5000 Divinity Generator Upgrade Clones will distribute another 5000 clones each time you press the button. This lack of uniform programming, lack of modularity, and lack of progressive thinking which builds an incremental Game using proper Mathematics as the foundation for constructing literally everything else, this is why despite having over 7 years where you built this big game; you are barely earning enough to cover Rent, Food, & Bills, per month. I checked your Patreon, you are earning less than $700 USD per month, even with Ad Revenue you aren't earning more than roughly 60 Hours per Week in USD at Minimum Wage.

If I were you, I'd have at least 150% of that monthly income, because I'd have built something that functions properly, not this ""I refuse to fix this basic fundamental issue, such as just blatantly not calculating entire branches of pre-requisites because 'I don't feel like fixing this super complex problem that nobody can help me with because I don't allow any of my Code to be accessed as Open Source, not even to help me fix an error' because 'I' spent months fixing this error already and refuse to waste any further time on it"", which was basically what you said 5 years ago in your E-mail to me.

If you had fixed your game 5 years ago, you'd very likely be earning over $1,000 per month from the Patreon Profits currently, because I instructed you to fix something that you are introducing yourself with; Pre-Requisites for Creations, the entire first few rebirths are built entirely around creating, which heavily makes use of the Pre-Requisites functions, which means that round the time you are asking for money; people are seeing that you need only 2 Sky to build the 100 Planets, each one using 1 Night, each 1 Night using 2 Sky to build, in order to build an entire Solar System! 1 Night to build 100 Planets to build an entire Solar System? Are you sure that's functioning properly? 1/100=0.01 Night per 1 Planet, does that sound accurate? Because each Planet is requestion 1.00 Night, not 0.01 Night.

Did you even attempt to test this yourself even once before publishing the update? I don't care if you are required to rebuild this entire section of the Game because the Code is so old that you are no longer familiar with the mechanics used in that section; good riddance to bad code, use better code this time, code that you can easily sift through, fix any future issues, get your code organized, and then you will not have further issues because you built everything upon a solid foundation with plenty of redundancies and error catching with error correction...right? For your sake; I hope you built using stable code, because otherwise this is going to go very wrong very fast because of improper code-building.

Brackets are the only universal Mathematical Formulae Constant, NOT ""PEMDAS"" or whatever other other names you may recognize the Acronym as, because there's another which performs Multiplication BEFORE addition, not to be confused with performing Addition before Multiplication, thus; Brackets are the universal constant, because; Brackets are explicit: there is no second-guessing, no guess-work.

Maybe it would be a good idea to join discord and talk to other players a bit.
Games are not math and don't need to be correct in everything and realistic. Game mostly need to make fun and give the players a feel of progression. As long as a game is fun for a player and the player feels a sense of achievement and progression, the basic princible of a game is there.

While I try to fix bugs when they are reported, I also need to manage my time and evaluate it if it is worth to fix it or not. As for your creation prerequisites issue, well sorry to say that, but to fix that would be very time consuming and I don't have the time. It is also a very minor display issue which doesn't effect the game at all. Almost nobody even looks at that. And spending a lot of time to fix this would be a bad business practice. In the end I need to make sure the game makes enough money to be able to live from it, so I need to priorize things which actually can either make money or keep most players longer to the game. Fixing a minor, but time consuming thing is not something like that.

Also about that spread button, it adds the value you did input in the input value for clones to use, which is the same behaviour for any page with a spread button. The distribute button for the clones is named differently and is not really compareable to the other things. Pets and buildings are something totally different.

If you feel like you can do it better and make a better game, feel free to try that, but your assumptions about the money I make from patreon and the game are quite a bit wrong and far from the truth. I won't say how much I make with it, but I can say it is far above minimum wage, otherwise I would not work on it anymore, I couldn't afford that."

I always want to play a little longer. Let's say, I used the rebirth option. I feel like let's wait some to create clone up to limit, then after getting some stats, attack gods, focus on getting lot of divinity and making creations. Then I started building monuments till divinity generator. Then use the generator to get more divinity and make more creations, upgrading my monuments, sending the pets to dungeons, unlocking might, upgrading might, then releasing might to increase stats greatly and beating more gods.

The game eases you into its many systems and mechanics as you progress further into the game. It also has a neat feature where it temporarily boosts your progress until you reach a certain point of the game, which does help out a lot for the initial starting grind. While overwhelming at first, the menus typically housing a feature each are thoughtfully created as each system meaningfully engages with other systems and the overall feel of the game itself. It doesn't demand a lot of your attention, barring when you first unlock a new feature and experiment with it. A lot of the automation features is available to you free of charge at the start, with a decent amount of customization as well. The wait time between each progression wall is fairly reasonable; if you play your cards right using the automation features and simple planning before you leave the game to idle, you generally can expect sizable progression after each idle session. And if things get too hard to figure out, there is a relatively friendly Discord community too.

You will see a lot numbers, and early in the game it might be confusing so you might want to either read up basics or just take some time to dig into the game mechanics. This idle Game also gives always the impression, that you are making progress, because progress is not totally linear, unlike in many other trashy idle games, you will in ITRTG always be able to feel your progress, so it is motivating to make you play more. I could not write about the game mechanics for hours I guess, but instead I will only keep it at the impression, this game has made on me, because the overall mechanics are just too many, and there are already plenty guides, where you can read them up.

If you want to make long term experience with an idle game by clicking a bit here and there every day but not investing too much real life into it, then you will find what you are looking for if you decide to play ITRTG.

It will NOT help you find a Girlfriend and NOT grant you SUPERPOWERS in life but it will still make you happy.

As a disclaimer, I'm still in the ""early game"" (having defeated Baal) but I'm pretty sure even playing optimally getting to this point would take most players a month or so so make of that what you will.

Overall this game basically ""requires"" you to be hardcore into IDLE games, it is a very slow starter and the grind seems to have no end. It's a game you can play for a very long time for better or for worse. As far as active play is concerned the game does more or less push you to log in at least once a day and is not very forgiving towards extended IDLE play (In my opinion this is one of the weakest aspects of the game as I at times enjoy the freedom to play IDLE games on a longer schedule). The depth of the game systems is impressive within the IDLE genre and so it is well suited for types who like to optimize (although I think the slow pace of the game might actually turn the optimizers off more than the challenge of optimization brings them in). The UI is a little bit clunky but it functions (at least after you get used to it), visually it's nothing to write home about but it's above par among IDLE games (many of whom don't even have graphics). 

So how does it compare to NGU IDLE? NGU IDLE, while being similarly slow, is better paced overall and seemingly more feature rich (although ITRTG is by no means feature poor, also the pet feature in ITRTG seems to have a lot of meat to it). The progression also seems to be generally more exciting in NGU as you are constantly getting tangible rewards such as equipment, unique perks, new features etc. as opposed to just watching your numbers go up in ITRTG. ITRTG has surprises too but they are more infrequent (although I'm sure I haven't even scratched the surface there). I realize ITRTG is the inspiration for NGU but nevertheless the point stands that NGU arguably surpasses the original.

If you can only play one I would have to direct you to NGU but if you are looking to commit to a game long term and have the patience to engage with the game daily ITRTG is at least worth looking into.

Tl;Dr: Fun game that lets you play when you want, and rewards active and idle playstyles. If you like Idle games, do yourself a favor and pick up this game.


I have played a variety of Idle games over the years, and this is the only one that has kept my interest - although Cookie Clicker is 2nd.

Why is this game still so fun to play, even years later?

It rewards both active and idle playstyles, without feeling like you're being punished for switching between them or using one more than the other

The 'base' game, defeating Baal, takes a decent amount of time and is really fun, but the 'end' game has basically unlimited replayability. There's dozens of different challenges, which provide stacking bonuses, and not only are most of the challenges fun and different, but the bonuses are also very desirable. 
Some of these challenges are beatable in hours, and some take over a month (or even longer, if you don't have time/perfect setup). 

Other than some confusion over the game being about making 'shadow clones' and then the first resource being 'light' (which I thought were 'light' clones for a while), the game explains pretty well what you should be doing at any given point, and gives you enough variety of options to be interesting, without being overwhelming. 

That said, the game has added about 10 new tabs of gameplay since I originally started, so the learning curve could be more difficult than I recall.

I think one of the things that really helps this game stay fun after all these years is that even though a lot of the numbers get super high and can start to lose meaning, and even after you start to get lost in all the challenges, you can still see how much *real* progress you have made by comparing one number: Highest God Defeated, which even people who are considerably further than me in the game are still only in the low triple digits of. Don't worry though, lots of other numbers get silly high :) 

I'd recommend this game to anyone who has anywhere from 30 minutes a week to check up on their idle progress, to someone who is able or willing to spend hours a day micro managing the game.

So obviously if you don't want an idle game, stay far away from this. However, if you do like idle games this has some reasonable depth and a quirky sense of progress that you can fiddle with occasionally and then just leave it… idle, while you go do something else.

Bottom line: idle games in general are not for everyone, but if you are into idle games, there's a lot worse than this out there.

This is probably the best idle game I've ever laid my hands on.
Everything in the game can be acquired for free, no micro-transactions are ever forced upon you.
The only ""downside"" to it is that the beginning is quite slow until you complete your first UBChallenge.

The game has lots of lore, a written story (actually kinda interesting too) and a lot of cool features so there's always something you can do. Run dungeons with your pets, craft items to make your god and your pets stronger, craft a refrigerator to keep your food between rebirths, etc. etc.

My recommendation is contingent on you being willing to commit to playing an idle game, twice a day, nearly every day, for at least the next several months.

Pros:
- One of the most complex idle games around without the mechanics feeling gimmicky
- *Almost* everything can be obtained eventually thru gameplay alone
- Offline progress works for *most* things at the same rate as online, if you open it at least every 12 hours
- Holiday events make it much less frustrating to unlock certain things (mostly ""Pet Tokens"" and pet-related things)
- The developer personally responded to my original review, explaining how to mitigate my originally perceived flaws with the game

Cons:
- It's easy to slow progress while using offline progress by forgetting to reopen the game at least every 12 hours
- The existence of non-cosmetic mtx / in-game purchases / microtransactions destroys the possibility of competitive play
- Some mtx items (""TBS for challenges"", ""Improved Campaign Cancel""[strike], and ""Custom Pet Clones""[/strike]) [strike]seem[/strike][b]are[/b] impossible to obtain via gameplay alone
- It's still an idle game

Note: I checked the ""received this product for free"" box because it's ""free"" in the Steam store and I haven't paid for any mtx items.

It's a decently complex idle game, but the ""must be online for full progress"" requirement greatly inflates the playtime stat.

Be warned.

It's also getting p2w these days. Devs paying more attention on the existing oldies instead of caring about the newbs. It's addicting at first, but bad experience for me overall.

Active play is strongly rewarded, despite the ""idle"" name. You will gain far more progresses while online and checking in every now and then than staying offline. There are still large walls in advancement that will take a lot of time to get past, I mean a lot. Sounds fine right? The truth is it's repetitive and boring af, it's asking you to do the same boring task you've completed over and over again. Beat Baal, rebirth and beat Baal, rebirth and beat Baal x99999. Watching the pain dry on my wall is literally better than playing this game.

Edit: Devs just responded lol. I don't like the lies they try to push in my face; it's only aggravating. Nobody likes them and all they do is damage control and attempting to downplay your criticism. 

So in response to this, no it's p2w. Sure you can get the stuffs, say refrigerator by grinding instead of paying $$, but well, get ready to grind it out for years, if that's not p2w, I don't know what is.

Yeah, we can 'get almost everything in offline progress', except it's like .3 of what we're supposed to have normally. If that's what you call 'almost', well I guess you can say that I am 'almost' old at 10 years old. Let me give you another example, skill capping from active play requires 15-16 days, if you let the app run in your background it takes 90 days (1 min per usage cap), if you go offline it'll take 270 days (3 mins per usage cap). Literally about a year difference between idling and active play and you call that 'almost'.

Also no idea what you mean with p2w because you can reach everything in the game for free and I didn't add any new purchases lately while I often make things easier for newbies. That said, older players play the game for much longer and run out of content, while the content is already there for new players. This means for new update the main focus has to be for older players. Still every new addition also makes it easier for newbies. I  take extra care that nothing I add makes existing things harder.

Anyway if you have suggestions for improvements, there is always the feedback option and the suggestion channel in Discord. If people don't say what they don't like I can't do anything to improve it.

Edit:
Please don't write crap which is untrue.

P2W = you need to pay money to win, which you don't need to do here. The game never asks you for money or even advertises it. A player literaly needs to search for it and playing the game actively helps way more than purchasing something.

The offline gain is 98% the same as the online progress, you just need to play once in a while, too, to send your pets to campaigns, dungeons and feed them because that needs to be done every 12 hours at least.
As for one-capping the skills, it is even faster if you go offline and then online for a 300% speed boost every day. It is doable within a month or two, if you do it right.

And of course the game doesn't do rebirths or do any strategic play you might need to progress faster automatically offline, but you can't really expect that.
All in all it is still a game to be played, while it can be idled for quite a bit it doesn't mean it plays itself without the need to do anything."

Also I must note, it's free-to-play game with 'items' shop in it, but these 'items' aren't OP and I personally never felt like game won't progress if I don't buy them.
ITRTG was far from being my first idling game, so at that point I already was pretty sturdy agains these type of games addiction. But it still got me for good. If you are easily prone to gaming obsessing, you better don't play it.

In the end I got out of addiction. Sure from a side viewpoint it sounds like a waste to spend almost a year in idling game, and probably it is a waste, but I had a lot of joy and writing this review half a year after quiting just because of fond memories of this game.

If you want a short yes/no answer if this game is worth checking out the answer is yes (says the guy with over 5k hours as of writing this).

The most important thing to know about this game is probably the pacing. The pacing is in my opinion the weakest part of this game as it does start of rather slow - it does pick up the pace eventually regardless of your playstyle. Once you get past this starting phase the pace is mostly dictated by your playstyle which brings us to the next point.
You can within reasonable bounds essentially play the game however as it's not a competition against others but rather just you playing at your own pace. Does this mean that this game has no community because it is an offline game ?
No that is not how it is at all, this game has a active community both on steam and discord and if you end up playing it I highly encourage you to join the discord server.

Back to the gameplay: You start out as the last survivor of the human race and go up against the local god on your planet which then escalates into you going around the universe and fighting every god you can find. Why do you do that ? Simple unlike the gods you are different in nature and capable of learning how to create things relating to them. Oh didn't I mention that every single god you beat will allow you to create something new ? Well they do.
You will also obtain God Power (GP) for beating them which is the main currency of the game and used to obtain stats which allow you to progress faster.
You start the game out with your own unique creation: Shadow Clones (SC). These allow you to progress faster and are what you will mostly use to progress within the game as they can fullfill tasks for you.
The first gameplay shift is introduced with rebirths. These function like they do in most other idle games. You restart your adventure but start with higher multipliers which are based on what you achieved in your previous rebirth.
All of this is accompanied by a story which is still progressing.

While playing you will slowly be introduced to new systems which there are too many of to mention/explain them all here.
One that absolutely is worth being mentioned though are pets.
You will slowly be gaining pets while progression towards your final goal of beating every single god there is. Some of these pets are exclusively unlocked via pet tokens which are obtainable through normal gameplay.
Now what do these pets do ?
Everything and some more. You can sent your pets to gather resources for you, train, multiply your stats (campaigns), do dungeons or boost yourself through other means.
Did I say dungeons ? Yes, yes I did.
Dungeons are seperate from most other progress in the game and allow you to assemble up to 4 teams (as of the moment of writing this) of up to 6 pets. Of course these pets also need some armor so you'll have to get some Blacksmiths and Alchemist to supply the Blacksmiths with materials. Oh right every single pet you obtain can be evolved to one of 8 classes which have unique functionalities and can either be specialised on doing campaigns, dungeons or in working on your gear for your pets as previously mentioned.

Once you beat the ""final god"" and as such gain the ability to create universes you will unlock challenges which are the bread and butter of just about any idle game. As of writing this there are a total of 34 different challenges (6 of which are day challenges that you can redo from time to time for better rewards.
These challenges will give you unique rewards and be progressively unlocked. If you have ever player any idle game at all you are most likely familiar with this concept.
There are 4 types of challenges one of which I have already mentioned. The remaining ones are normal challenges, multi reset challenges and GP reset challenges.
Normal challenges will give you a goal to reach with all of your stats (with one exception)
Multi reset challenges will not take away any of your stats (with a few small expceptions).
GP resets are the grand daddys of challenges that will take away a good part of your progress for the duration of the challenge (but give it back afterwards).

Other noteworthy things are that this game is still being developed but that it is also over 5 years old.
Is that a negative thing though ? That somewhat depends on what kind of player you are. If you want access to every part of the game fromt the get go then yes it is a negative thing as some of the things you can unlock will take months and even years to unlock. If you are sitting there now thinking to yourself: ""But I can do that faster""; then I have to tell you: no. No matter how optimal you play some things will simply take time.

Now that I have mentioned ""optimal"" it is time to speak about the math side of this game. You can play this game casually without giving a second thought about things or you can try to minmax every last fraction of it which some people are constantly working on. You will do just fine doing whatever you want but if you want to go down the other route there are tools made available by players that will help you with that (refer to the steam community, the wiki or the discord sever).

Lastly one question that some of you might find interesting: Is this game P2W ?
Idle games or known to have a tendency to be P2W and I am not going to just say ""well you can reach XYZ with enough"" time.
I will also note that for the definition of P2W I will ignore that this game does not have any multiplayer aspects (apart from a chat option) and as such there is no real competition.
There are advantages within this game that you can get with money which I personally consider as P2W because they give you an advantage that you can't otherwise get or you would lose out on some form of progress. There are other options which will let you progress faster if you want to consider those as P2W in a single player.
So what do the ones that I consider P2W total out to ?
Option 1 would be the so called refrigerator which can be obtained during normal play but the discrepancy in time between when it starts to become useful to have and when you can actually unlock it is too big imo. The refrigerator costs 14.90€.
Option 2 is moreso targeted towards more advanced players and are called RTI slots. It is not really necessary to know what RTI means or does but the point here is that the ingame option to obtain there ""sltos"" requires you to sacrifice some of your progress while the money option skips this part. Each slot costs 4.90€ and you can buy up to 6. It should however be noted that by the time you can actually make use of these slots the amount of things you have to sacrifice are not as bad as it might sound at first. Regardless of that I consider this advantage unfair and as P2W.

Do these downsides make the game not enjoyable ? In my opinion not as those downsides are mostly based on if you want the benefit from them for yourself as you are not competing against anyone.

Every time you progress to the next thing in this game, the next run becomes more work. Theres so many different mechanics from the getgo that increase your multipliers. And if you skip out on those you did the last run, your multipliers will go down. So everyrun I now have to train all skills to at least 10000 (which means some even higher to unlcok them all), have to build monuments, upgrade said monuments, craft a ton of different elements for the achievement multipliers, etc. This means my runs are longer and drawn out with quite some idle time in between, but since I cant automate it all I need to check back every 5 mins in the first hour or two before I can let it idle for a couple hours. 

Theres also too many things to setup at once at the start of each run. I got a couple hundred hours in this game and it left me completely exhausted, and I havent even defeated Baal.

Пациент представляет из себя очередной идл, с развитой системой прокачки. Правда всю эту систему портит частичное отсутствие логики, для меня.
В игре присутствует крайне подробно опысанный сюжет, и все победы твоего божка над прочими божками, крайне подробно описаны. Крайне подробно и скучно, очень напоминает аниме вроде насруто или хрыча-блича, с их крайне подробными боями и прочей чепухой. Много слов, мало дела.
В игре есть петы, которых ты хрен прокачаешь без доната, или хотя бы десятка ребиртов, а мб и больше.
В игре есть несколько десятков скиллов-мобов-построек, иссдедовать-мочить-строить которые ты заибешься, извиняюсь, но это придется делать. Иначе останешься слабаком.
В игре есть довольно паскудненькая графика, симпатичного визуала очень мало. Даже в идле по Забытым королевствам, изуродованные херои выглядят симпатичней.

Вообще, плюсов здесь, для меня, возможность пожечь время. Все в общем.
А минусы. 
1) Криво работающая автоматизация, автозакупка ресурсов и прочего. То все работает аккуратно, то генератов диванов не закупает ресурсы, а денег завались, клоны на работе есть.
2) Отсутствие логики в создании своей вселенной, особенно в начале. Когда ты способен заселить планету хер знает какую, людьми.... а планеты земного типа и вообще, создавать ещё не способен. И подобное.
3) Донат, запросто способный склонить баланс в пользу игрока, влияет на все и весьма серьезно. Можно и без доната конечно, как я с другом играю, но донат позволяет все сделать охренеть как быстрее и лучше.

Поиграть можно, но рекомендовать не стану.
06.01.23 К Новому Гаду игра превратилась в донатную помойку по сути. 
Петы стали очень дороже, 300 к итемов вместо 200 к кстати, или это тем кто давно играет подарок.
Упали добычи пет стонов(меняются на петов) Мои зверюшки явно не слабже прошлой партии, но носят 338 стонов за раз, было в прошлой партии более тысячи.
Евенты скатились в донат, позволяя купить имбо вещи за 5 к итемов..... при 120 итемах за заход, и вроде 300+ за логин ежедневный, не уверен что возможно нормальными путями купить имбушки.
В общем очень сильно больше доната, снижения уровня прогрессии, да и обновления игру не то чтобы особенно расширяют.

It's really not a money grab, it's more about convenience and time savings.  Pets are still the ""not yet fully understood"" entity but they are relatively easy to get and you don't ""have"" to spend a dime on them.  Currently at 23 pets without having done so.

I will admit, it looks intimidating at first, and it does not have the most inviting user interface to new players. However, despite this, if you learn and grow accustomed to it, there is never-ending content waiting for you. The game, from what I have heard from the discord, can take a few months to *complete* (as I said, there is never-ending content, so there is plenty to do).

If you ever need help with where you are/are stuck then join the ITRTG discord and just ask. I can guarantee you that somebody will have your solution, as lots of the players in it are veterans of the game (with a share of new people too). 

The only thing I could say is that the UI could be improved. The developer is aware of this and has made efforts to improve it, which says a lot about them. 

It also has pretty sweet pop culture references (The Great FSM, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Dragon Ball) just to name a few! As well as references to countless religions from around the globe, without poking fun at any of them.

英文其实很简单，仔细看一下都懂
简单说一下游戏流程

1.界面概况
进入游戏先看左上角clones，代表你的克隆体数量，它会默认不停地自动制造（划重点），最开始你的上限只有1000个，每当你制造20个克隆体、或有20个克隆体被杀死时，你的上限就会加1（这种方法的上限为100000）。再想增加上限，就需要花费GP点数买了。游戏中完成绝大多数的工作都要靠它们驻扎~~而且最重要的是，无论你要完成任何任务，或者任何奇怪的终极挑战，你的clones上限永远不会下降（即使有些终极挑战下降也是临时的）。

最左上Power level：代表着你的战力，在挑战boss时，可直观对比体现是否能打过。
左下六项数据除Divinity外共同决定了你的Power level。其中消耗Divinity（神性）可以建造建筑或制造水晶，消耗Creating（制造）可创造毒星球（UB2用）。

Stats右边Rebirth：就是重生，点击底下的Rebirth后，你的power level和六项全部清零，但你会获得乘积倍数，以便在重生后更快的提高各项能力，当四项都变成绿色就可以更好地重生了，不过考虑到效率，初始游戏者建议四项倍数全部>10再进行重生。

Info：关游戏时候Save和Save Online都点一下，以防意外发生。

旁边的challange：完成挑战可获得丰厚的奖励，不过有一些非常难完成的挑战，也是这个游戏最费时间的地方，游戏中期才可以进行挑战，比较耗时。

Clones旁边小豆：点击查看God Power(GP)，整个游戏中最最有用的东西，几乎一切重要的东西都是靠GP换来的~购买Clones上限，增加建造速度，创造速度等等。游戏初期很难获得，但随着游戏时间的累计，人物的强大，后每天能得到上百个。

小豆旁边的红包：红包代表有奖励可领，拉下至lucky draws领取，每22h免费可领一个，领过后付费项目有折扣

这个游戏充钱不会有很大的提高，特别是游戏初期，不过非要充钱的话，还是有几个花少量的钱但能有较大提升的地方的。
（1）游戏中期开始，需要更多的水晶槽和水晶的等级，尤其是水晶槽，买过后会有质的飞跃，有的水晶会产GP。。。

2.游戏初期
（1）首先Train里面的Physical和skills，让clones驻扎进行训练，前一项够高（达到500.1000.1500.2000...以此类推）解锁下一项，注意将右边的Sync打开，可以实现二者同步训练。持续让clones驻扎在这个训练，能力则持续提升，右边CAP点击后驻扎当前clones最大效率。
（2）fight里的monster同样，需要clones驻扎，打败一个就可解锁下一个。同样地，持续让clones驻扎在这个怪物堆里，能力则持续提升，但clones在你战力低于怪物的时候会死，因此前期可以用怪物杀死你的克隆体增加其软上限。旁边的gods要按顺序打，打败一个会增加你重生后的乘积，而且会解锁build里面的各种物品（从造一滴水一点空气到造出一个宇宙），在其界面更改（默认是不停地造clones）。Build里面的creat以及upgrade，打败特定boss后，可看到，解锁建造各种纪念碑及升级的能力，让克隆体驻扎，消耗各种材料，建造/升级完毕后，增加你的各项能力。
（3）build、Train和fight都有各种小成就，完成将会增加乘积倍数，为下次重生加倍。
（4）上面说过打倒一些特殊的神后解锁monument（建筑）以及其升级功能，建造以增加自己的各项能力，其中ToG建造解锁神性制造机器，点击fill可将神性放上去，产出更多的神性，下面三项capacity，DG和CS分别和增加容量，转化率和速度，可驻扎clones对其升级。
（5）最右边planet，建议直至重生后能打败所有gods后再进行。

ITRTG isn't a clicker game because I generally hate clickers. It's a true idle game. If you ever wanted a hobby that could pass the few mundane minutes before work or until the kids get home etc, then this is the game you've been looking for. It's not a fast paced 'rite nao' game so don't go into it thinking you're going to speed through to endgame content. Everything in the game takes time, even if you spend money. Unless you're planning to spend copious amounts of money and then my question to you would have to be, 'where did you go so wrong in life that you're willing to spend that much to ""win"" an idle game?' That being said I'm not saying don't support the developer by refusing to spend any money at all either.

I've left the game a couple times for up to a year at one point. Every time I have left there's always a ton of new content and challenges when I get back. The developer has done a lot of work to the game and he doesn't seem content to just quit here. There's constant updates-both good and bad-but the bad usually gets fixed and the good definitely outweighs it. It's a game that you don't have to spend a lot of time on to get things rolling. 10-15 minutes here or there and you could be set for hours, or days depending on what you're doing.

Despite a positive review the game isn't for everyone. If you don't want to keep the game open in the background 24/7 you aren't going to get ahead as fast as someone who is. Online time really matters as there are quite a few things that will not happen while you are offline. Now early on this isn't a problem as really there's only one thing in the beginning that won't track offline. Later on though you will miss out on 'god power' (ingame currency) from different sources if you're offline for too long at a time.

I cannot stress this enough: Do not play this game if you can not be patient. There's a ton of wikis and guides out there. Both on Kongregate's forum and Steam's so spend some of that idle game time looking up guides and wikis and learning as much as you can. Don't just enter the chat or discord and ask a question that's covered in the ingame FAQ or the fan wikis.. it's annoying. We're more than happy to help but give a man a fish...etc. Also, it's an idle game so don't enter the ingame chat and spam 'hello' 3-4 times and then leave within 30 seconds. Most of us just lurk there all day. Sometimes conversations happen over the course of 6 hours, we're used to someone coming in 4 hours after a conversation and making a casual comment about it. It takes a special kind of person to idle... and idle chat. It's not that we're not helpful, we just may not be helpful RIGHT NOW because we're not there. I hear the Discord guys are more active so you can always go that route, most of us in the ingame chat are just too lazy to bother switching over, we're the holdouts.

In all seriousness though, if you like slow grinding strategy type games... MUDs for instance. Then give this a chance, it's not the same but it's the closest thing I can think of to a mostly text based slow paced game. There's really nothing else quite like it that I've found. I hope to see you all there and as I always say, ""Happy Idling.""",1569158724,1569158849,True,7,2,0.59677422046661377,0,False,False,False,False,,,

2. 都练得差不多了，可以fight了，fight一开始是monster，第一个是slimy，就像炉石的软泥怪类似，然后再慢慢解锁，fight monster 可以增加battle 也就是战斗技巧，和divinity 也就是神性，我猜想打第一个GOD，就是需要神性。

I played a lot of these kind of games (mainly because I'm lazy) and I can tell that this is a really well made game. 

Of course, it IS an idle game so you shouldn't expect much gameplay wise. It's pretty much just clicking on different things and looking forward to ""revive"" to be much stronger then before.

But this game know how to give you this feeling of becoming overpowered and even has a REALLY cool story line. 

In the game you will be fighting different monsters and your ability is to clone yourself. You clones, similar to the anime series ""naruto"", will make it so that everything they do will upgrade you in a certain way. So you can for example use 100 clones to fight rats. Just normal rats. Through that you will upgrade different abilities and will reach a point where you can defeat the first god of the planet. This will give you a new ability. A secondary ability of yours is that each time you revive you basically reset the time for everyone else except for you. So you lost your levels and everything but kept the new skills and clone cap (you will know what I mean if you play the game) and by that you can level up again MUCH faster and get to defeat new bosses.

As I said, your clones will be fighting rats at the start and struggle. This is because your clones are actually much weaker then you but if they die you won't even get hurt in the slightest.

It seems like a single person has developed this? I could be wrong, but if so this is fairly impressive.

Pros: This game will last you a long while if you stick with it... a long while. I've put so many ""hours"" (much of it was offline) into this game without much effort at all and I still have tons of content to unlock. The general concept is great and the feeling of becoming incredibly powerful is quite satisfying. Nothing quite like kicking godly a$$ and creating worlds... or galaxies... or universes. There's even a story of your journey to read while you ""train"".

Cons (these may be more just personal preferences): Though the general concept is great, some of the finer details are lacking for me.  The logic behind creation/training tends to get a little funny in certain areas; I realize this is likely due to gameplay balancing but it still makes me twitch if I think about it too much. The pantheon of gods are all over the place... Nordic, Japanese, Roman, and Greek (and possibly other) myths and gods all intermix in a somewhat strange fashion to my mind.

Review: Idling to Rule the Gods for the PC.

Idling to Rule the Gods is the poorly-anticipated new game from a Indie publisher you've never heard of, but is it any good? 

Screw the establishment, man! Oversized publishers that don't move with the times are so old hat. The cool way to publish games is to be a lean operation of a couple of guys who haven't been able to afford a YCMA shower in a week who release games like Idling to Rule the Gods for free and grow beards and hang out at coffee shops and have documentaries made about them.

It is basically idle/clicker games version of the weird kid that nobody likes in school. Idling to Rule the Gods tries to seperate itself from the pack with no new features.

There are a bevy of upgrades to buy through the game's obnoxious in app purchasing system, but players will find that they can safely get through some of the game without outlaying further cash. 

It's too slow-paced, even for an idle game. The graphics are pretty crap! You'll be checking if something's wrong with your system, and maybe some people will get a kick out of the poorly executed Anime art style, but it's not enough. Being a 2D game, the hardware capabilities of your PC aren't exactly being pushed to the limit. The animation-quality visuals are a cliche-filled torrent of junk which I think is OK if you're into that sort of thing..

Given enough time and money, Idling to Rule the Gods could really be something less terrible. However as it stands right now it's just too unpolished and boring to recommend to anyone.

Overall Score: 2 / 10

В 9001 году люди уничтожили все обитаемые планеты в известной вселенной. На последней планете им удалось создать устройство космического измерения. С помощью этого устройства они смогли переместиться в другое измерение. Мир безделья, чтобы править богами.
На первой обитаемой планете, которую они нашли, они заметили, что мир работает иначе, чем известная вселенная. Им правят боги. Вскоре после этого Гиперион, первый Бог, нашел людей и сразился с ними. После продолжительного боя все люди, кроме тебя – игрока – погибли. Выживая все это время, вы развили свою собственную особую способность: создавать теневых клонов.

Игра начинается здесь.
Вы создаете теневых клонов, они тренируются, изучают навыки и сражаются с монстрами для вас, в то время как вы поглощаете их силу, пока вы не будете достаточно сильны, чтобы победить первого бога “Гипериона”. После победы над Гиперионом, вы найдете много, гораздо более сильных богов. Чтобы победить их всех, вы должны найти различные способы стать более могущественными. Вы возрождаетесь, создаете свои собственные памятники, тренируете домашних животных и сражаетесь с высшими существами.

最強の神となり究極の果てを目指せ！

※追加レビュー※
バージョンも変わってちょくちょく色々追加されたので追加レビュー。
やりごたえのあるチャレンジ（ご丁寧にSteam実績対応）も数多く存在し、それぞれのチャレンジを複数回挑戦する大きなメリットまであり、チャレンジに挑み続けることが育成の指針になりうるゲームでもあります。
最初の目的であるBaalを倒して戦いのチュートリアルがスタート。より強いBaalに挑むも良し（それもメリット有ります）、一旦チャレンジに挑んで新たな力を得るも良し。とりあえず脳死でGodPower稼いで色々増やしてから考えるもひとまずヨシ！
やることは結局……。

По мере победы над ними открываются новые творения, которые нужно начать создавать, и дальше они будут создаваться автоматически. Чем больше всего этого качается, убивается и создается, тем вы мощнее. Когда прогресса больше особо не видно, перерождаемся слева во вкладке Rebirth (зеленые цифры означаются что вы станете мощнее, чем были во время предыдущего перерождения) и начинаем все сначала. Со временем вы победите определенное божество и получите возможность создавать монументы за ресурсы и станете еще мощнее, потом их апгрейды. Победив всех божеств, дальше следуют бесконечные П. Баалы, а вы сможете стать еще сильнее за счет прокачки планеты. На нее периодически нападают Высшие Существа, побеждая их добывается энергия, которую можно потратить на создание кристаллов, одев которые в конечно же станете еще мощнее. Еще есть Divinty Generator, чтобы создавать эти самые Divinty и больше и быстрее производить ресурсов. Так же по мере игры открываются питомцы, которых нужно кормить, отправлять на сражение со своими клонами или в многочисленные компании. Ну и так же после овладевания всеми тренировками становится доступна Might (мощь), где можно продолжить развивать свои характеристики, а после победы над последним из божеств открывается мини игра, где нужно попадать в маленькие полоски на линии, повышая урон крита и его шанс против П. Баалов. За определенные успехи даются god power, которые делают вас еще круче. Максимальное количество клонов повышается после их убийств на монстрах и создания новых до капа в 100к. Не забывайте ежедневно собирать билетики, из них иногда падают приятные штуки. Когда достигните более менее всего возможного, можно переходить на всевозможные челенджи, суть которых сводится к достижению определенных задач с разными ограничениями.[/b]

It works on a similar basis to clicker games, whereby you have to level up as far as you can, then ascend (or, in this case, ""rebirth"") and start all over again, with a slightly stronger basis each time.

You create items which can be used in your fight against the gods. More items are unlocked as you go.
Then you can build monuments and use pets as extra aids in your fight.
Training in various elements is also key to the process.

The game is mainly self-explanatory, although there are some tasks that won't necessarily be obvious at first.

When you first start, it seems to take a long time to level up through the various gods you have to fight.
Don't expect to get all of the achievements quickly - it's going to be a long slog (if you look at the global achievement stats you can see just how few players get the higher achievements).
To get all of the Steam achievements, you have to be in it for the long haul.

Nonetheless, it's a somewhat interesting game.
Be warned that Idling to Rule the Gods is not everyone's cup of tea.
However, if you have the patience for a long-term text-based game, then by all means give it a go.

If you can't tell by my play time - I've enjoyed the hell out of it.

I had ONE period where I put the game down for two months because I didn't understand a mechanic of the game.

The UI, while not the most intuitive at first makes more sense if you give it a bit of time to get used to. There's also a community that will help you, both in IRC (in-game or via your own IRC client) and Discord.

Pros
-[b]Active Developer[/b] - Ryu is very active in the community, Kong, Steam, and Discord. The game is still getting attention even  while he's got other projects ongoing.
-Plenty of content to go through (several years)
-Number crunchers will have a good time min/maxing
-You don't need to stare at the game to make progress, though you can if you so choose.

Cons
-Daunting to get into initially
-Some things are lost in translation. Ryu speaks english, but it's not his first language, so the phrasing on some tooltips lead to some misunderstandings (counter Pro to this - the community can help you with this if you're willing to ask!).
-Some tasks in game seem daunting (There's a challenge set that may take approximately a year to complete, give or take a few months).

And I have played a lot of them, even those not on steam. For reference, all the steam suggestions for ""More like this"" are already in my library. (And all have at least a few hours if not a few dozzen or hundred on them)

Having said that, this game is not for everyone. If you are someone who does not like math (And I have been told that this is a majority) then the game will not seem like much to you. If you love math however, then this is the game for you!

The game starts off complex and unlocks more complexity as you progress. While the sublimeness of the unlocks may not reach Universal Paperclips level of sublime, it does have it's own charm. Achieveing objectives opens up other objectives and hidden unlocks for very varied gameplay despite the same basic math.

You decisions in how to allocate resources and time can have very dramatic effects on the outcome.

The in-game story is basically an ""Isekai"" theme which fits very well.

* deep gameplay, steep learning curve
* a lot of updates (events every few months plus a ton of QOL updates and bug fixes - there is a list you can vote on & suggest to and most stuff gets implemented a few months later)
* no need to buy stuff with real money (BUT you can support the DEV by buying pet tokens, if you want to - buying god power is kinda useless)
* great community (access via chat)
* secret game play & pets / a lot of unlocks to make the game even more complex

cons:
* graphics are even less than 'meh' and you can 
change the UI so it at least looks ok/nice.
* Don't play it if you don't like idle games or don't like to plan ahead 
or hate maths/calculating/planning/idle games.


THE best idle game out there ever imho.
The game is not easy so if you don't try to learn it, then 
better leave it.
BUT there are more and more guides and the community is extremely helpful (IF you can wait for a few minutes or a few hours for an answer in the ingame chat - time zones, work, sleep...
or else just try out the discord server.)

BUT after having played for a while, things totally make sense. Real money is not required to advance, albeit patience is required, which is fine for an idle game.
The game plays like a very abstract economy build up game. Think of civilisation without a map. You optimize different parameters that in turn increase your rate of progress. The whole challenge is to distribute current resources optimally across a variety of settings in order to progress at maximal speed.
Check out the FAQ and the forums for information on how to play, you need it. But the game is not too hard to learn.
It is a game that I play in work breaks - as an idle game it is not meant for continuos play. For that purpose the concept makes the game fun and a good interruption of work. You constantly get a little feeling of progress.

Most Idle/clicker  games have an endgame which is no more enjoyable to play. Clicker Heroes, Soda Dungeon and Adventure capitalist are just 2 examples. This Idle game doesn't get boring in Endgame and the stat\resources and challenge system is makes this Idle game more complex when it comes to min maxing. To keep it short here is ashort list of pros and cons

pros
+no paywall to be able to play the game as it is meant to
+In game purchases which just speed the progress a little bit, but don't feel mandatory
+Lucky Draw each day to get ""premium"" bonus. The odds are OK 
+no fancy graphics( my preference, also listed at cons for people who do not like games with simple graphics)
+good endgame
+good midgame
+right to brag after finishing ultimate Arty Challenge
+Offline calculation and progress
+many different resources/statistics which influence your progress
+Challenges which give you bonus
+Not a so simple prestige/rebirth system as used in Other idle games

cons
-menu is hard to get used to
- pretty hard to get into
-you will eventually do the Ultimate Arty Challenge^^
-no fancy graphics

I enjoy the idle genre, as it gives a sense of satisfaction that is hard to get in most other games.  This one however, is much different from other idle games you have played. I'd recommend giving it a shot, but would also recommend that you watch a youube video to preface it (in place of a tutorial).  Or ask a friend that has played it.  Starting can be VERY rough (I had people telling me how to start it, so my start wasn't too bad thankfully) 

Pros:
-Very Cool story.  Seriously, the story is addicting and has me coming back to re-read it while I'm idling.
-A lot to do.  You can play this like an idle game, or (after first few rebirths) can actually spend hours of active play.
-The male hero looks kinda like Goku.  Seriously.
-The descriptions and abilities are hilarious.

Cons:
-Annoying menus.  Takes a few hours to learn the menus, and annoying that you have to swap between them so often.
-Wording of some things is confusing.  
-Dark Gray everywhere.  No color.  You can change some of the colors, but lack fine control over it.  You cannot make it look good, no matter how long you try (trust me). I don't know if this is how the end product will be, but it should probably get a cool shell to be played in. (although it is reminiscent of the old text/browser based games I grew up with).

If you want something that's played mostly actively, maybe not. {there are exception strategies, but not *that* many.} It's also rather complex, though less-so than some of the reviews make it sound. 

The game has a lot of different elements to micromanage, but none of them are, on their own, immensely complex. This game has only two clicker analogues/minigames as far as I've gotten- the special fights and the baal slayer. I think ultimate beings V2 are going to be a third, but it's not viable for me yet. None of these is incredibly neccessary.

Anything else's gameplay is micromanaging in some manner. Progress bars will fill with you or without you, but you can optimize through micromanaging or reset to restart building with an exponentially increasing starting multiplier. This is a very reset (rebirth in-game, at least for the simplest kind. Challenges are a higher-level kind.) heavy game, by the way. Active players might ""rebirth"" as often as every 1-2 hours for optimal progress. 

I enjoy this game, you might not. Still, one word of advice- either read the built in FAQ guide or look for a user-made guide. This game might be less complex than people are selling it as, but it doesn't start as simple as most idle games.

And don't pay attention to my playtime, I run it in the background. I spend between 1 and 5 minutes on the game per hour on record, usually, and when it's dramatic in either direction, it's usually less, such as 0 minutes per hour. A more relevant unit is when I started- which is less than six months ago but more than 3.

So i would say that this is a okai game,  theres not really any like it.  But over the years, its clearly been in maintenance mode where things (pets, challenges, such) gets added mostly just to postpone people quitting and to increase income.

At some point he added ""pgcs""  which is patreon gods challenges, which has basically been a way for the playerbase to pay him to troll the rest of the playerbase. And other challenges;  1CCC, UFCC,  UGC, UCC(remake) , MQC, LCC etc etc  have all been really bad experiences where the player experience is not considered at all. And while i been lategame for a while, other people i got to know there where not. and its a pretty awful experience.  Constantly new pets get added, since while you can get pet stones to buy them, but never enough to catch up or keep up.  

Overall i would say the game, dev and community is a thumb down.  But it is unfortunately a unique enough game where it has long term rpg progression which is neat.   But i am now free. Have quit. 


---

So i have played this game now for half a year, with pretty much always leaving it running in the background so i have close to 4000 hrs.  And i got to say i mostly like it, its a idle game with more dept than others i have played which i enjoyed. And it has a story which altho silly is pretty fun to read. 

The game is totally free and the microtransation in it while on the more expensive side is fair and convinience only. Theres nothing mandatory about it.   And after just finishing a UAC (the most time consuming challenge) i bought the refridgerator, just to support the dev with some money because why not. 

The downside is the community, the community on ingame chat (via irc) is pretty bigoted and toxic which is grating which the sole mod there seems to go along with. So that seems to be a lost cause. If your looking for a experience all by yourself ill give it a thumbs up but dreading the chat button lighting up makes it a thumbs down overall.

Man fängt am Anfang erst mit dem einfachen Training der Monsterbekämpfung und des Kämpfen gegen Götter an doch es wird immer mehr und das Managen der eigenen Klone wird auch immer wichtiger wenn man die Balance zwischen Might, Training, Moster kämpfen, Klone für die Haustiere, Divinity Gegnerator und vielem weiterem Aufteilen muss xD

Durch das Wiedergeburten System wird auch immer wieder man an den Anfang der Aufteilung geschmissen womit man immer wieder von neuen Nachdenken muss ob man jetzt die 20K Klone zu den Monster oder zum Training steckt was beim ersten Softcap von 99999 einen dann vor eine echte herausforderung stellt doch wenn mit dem benutzen von God Power kann dieses auch wider erhöht werden.

Ein großer Punkt des SPiles ist natürlich das AFK-Spiel, ich konnte mich einige male ertappen nur das Spoiel anzuschalten um nur das AFK-Spiel zu starten :D
Dort kann ein ""Afky God"" gelevelt werden und ich finde das macht auch tierisch Spaß immer schon mit dem Mauszeiger auf dem ""Power +1k"" butten zu halten um dann zu level wenn man genug Exp hat :D

This game is not a clicking simulator like many other incremental games end up being, with this game setting up an autoclicker will benefit you very little. Progression certainly FEELS slower than some other incremental games, but that's only because it doesn't have fancy graphics or sound effects; if you're actively playing this game it will feel slower because of the simplicity of the game.

Let's compare this to other incrementals on Steam:
-Clicker Heroes is a pretty solid game, but it fails to do anything special at all after prestiging a few times.
-Crusaders of the Lost Idols is an EXCELLENT game...assuming you've got the time to mess around with it nearly 24/7, otherwise progression in it is MUCH slower than this game, not to mention the content just loops with increased stats every 50-100 levels.
-Time Clickers if taken at face-value appears to be an in-depth experience, after logging a few hours however you see that it leads nowhere.
-Crush Crush is a fairly solid game but ends up slowing down to a slow, painful, MULTIPLE DAYS LONG grind after unlocking the first 7 or so girls.
-AdVenture Capitalist is certainly not for everyone, I personally hated it but love most incrementals.
-Every other incremental on Steam is a massive joke.

All I can say negative about this game thus far is that the micro-transactions are ludicrously expensive, however they offer such insignificant advantages that you'd have to spend $100 just to save a days worth of grinding. An example of these in-game purchases is a ""Godly Liquid"", this will increase your production by 100% effectively cutting the amount of time needed to complete certain tasks in half, the catch? It costs $1 and only lasts for 90 minutes.

^ But to all seriousness this is a pretty good game. The grammar in the game isn't the best if you've read the story (Looking at Chapter 10). There are various ways to progress in the game. I spent 35 dollars on the game because it has helped me kill quite a bit of time (seriously into the stat screens). There isn't really too much of a difference between your skills when you're using them on auto (never tried fighting the gods myself). Anyway, afk for a lot of the time (work and sleep) but I'm on this game a lot (it makes sense to play this game before everyone else loads into League of Legends or even Smite (Because I'm normally the first one loaded into those games).

This game is about making progress (I know that sounds extremely stupid) but when you start off playing the game, you start off at lvl 0, 1? Well anyway... you defeat your first god like the game actually tells you to do at one of the screens if you manage to find it and you ""learn"" how to ""rebirth"" your character. If you actually read the story you actually defeat your first god when you're like 50 something (Most likely) with the help of your ""shadow clones"" strengthing themselves to actually strengthen you. This is assuming that your character starts off in his/her twenties. After your rebirth you start off at lvl 0, 1 again (Can't remember if it's Zero or lvl One...)? I would like to mention how the game works. There are multipliers in this game that get absurdly high (Mine keeps rising). Anyway, You start off by training abilities by sending your shadow clones to do this and you also send them to train your skills (There is a cap where putting so many clones to do something won't benefit the skill anymore). You know you have enough clones when you reach the cap which is why they have a ""Cap Button"". When you reach the true cap ""1 Clone to train your physical/skills"", you will notice that the bar appears to not even show up (because you're clone has basically mastered how to do that skill). An example of this would be ""running"". Before anyone asks, no this isn't all the game has to offer. Later on in the game, you can build ""monuments"" which can significantly boost your stats. Upgrading these ""monuments"" provide even higher buffs for your character. I'm currently at the point where I created my own planet and I can fight the first ""Ultimate Being"". These also add a stat multiplier. It's fair to say that if you play the game a lot, you should rebirth at least once a day. I play quite a bit and it'll probably take me two days to progress where I was before.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edited October 21st, 2016
There are still challenges that I need to do even though I fought the ""last boss"" on my planet (with a technique I found myself [never was on the forums or anything]). I can still go and try to beat that boss again because the game literally never ends. They've added an extra multiplier to the game where you have an ""afk god"", which rebirths when you rebirth, but the point of him/her is to kill these shadow clones that they make. For everyone 1k clones your afk god kills, adds 1 to your statistics multiplier. So far, this is the fastest way to level your statistics multiplier. I'm also currently creating a universe for the 2nd time  (Ultimate Universe Challenge or UUC) so I can level my planet by 1 level. I still have no idea what ""might is in the game"" or the ""might tab"". I wonder how I don't know these things when I've spent ""this many hours in it"" lol.",1469938309,1482194106,True,5,2,0.55521470308303833,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Edit: Serious review now.
When I first played this game, it was on Kongregate and I didn't pay much attention to the details and features the game had to offer. Hence, I stopped playing it as I felt it was incredibly boring.

However, after moving to the Steam version of this, I realised how much more this game had to offer and being an avid lover of idle games, I actually read the FAQ (wow!) and actually understood the various features of this game. Now, at around 400h, the complexity of this game comes out. 

I must warn though, it may get boring at the start though due to having to reduce the number of shadow clones you spend on training.

All in all, I feel that everyone, idle game enthusiast or casual gamer, should give this game a try and try to look past the artwork which may seem off-putting for some.

Complexity (wait for it)
Numerous variables that will make idle fans enjoy the game more than other idle games

Cons:
-Artstyle - I mean the artstyle was made by a freaking 8 year old... my son can actually draw this!!! I sure do hope that the devs fix this... and something like a CG or wallpaper or a few elaborate pics come eventually. give them some time
-Complexity (yes, i know. i know you read the same thing on Pros) - the Con here is the beggining... the first 2 hours were painful to me! Too much information and such little help, which leads to my next Con.
-FAQ. I'm sorry but it's bad.. you are assuming way too much from someone who picked the game 5 minutes ago and it needs to be shortened and MORE useful... the FAQ was useful to me to get some info after having like 50h or so.
-Artstyle (i know.) - I just need to enphasize this again... it's horrible.

OK, so this is my first review of a game. And I choose this game. Why? Because I've played this game from early alpha, where you can only slap hyperion and barely have any hp left to win. I've seen my clones sitting there in the training tab, Whole 40k clones sitting on the training tab and wondering how much clones to Black-barring the skills. Ok enough for the rant, and here's my review.

You start with nothing. Except your name, gender, body, and your ability to create clone. The clones are what you get for doing nothing at the start of the game. And then you realize there's a training tab there. You clicked it and it shows you what can you do with your clone, let them train for you, the lazy one. Then, after a while, you realize that you can smack gods to create more things. Then after a few hours, you realize you just lost to some god. You get a rebirth, and starting your life again, just like reading from the start of this paragraph again. Only to realize you've lost hundreds of hours in this game.

Petit jeu sympathique à la adventure capitalist, vous êtes un dieu nouveau né qui va devoir assoir sa domination sur tout et tous.

Grosso modo vous devez remplir des objectifs de base qui vous permettront de débloquer une renaissance ""sûre"", une fois cette renaissance faite toutes vos stats prennent un coup de boost.

Le but pendant on va dire les 5-10 premières heures de jeu c'est principalement de viser cet objectif pour la renaissance afin d'avoir un très gros multiplicateur de stats pour que les combats contre les autres dieux se passent sans encombrent.

Le jeu n'est pas difficile, vous n'avez pas besoin de martiriser votre souris, vous assignez vos ordre et il n'y a plus qu'à laisser tourner le jeu en arrière plan.

Il y a beaucoup de choses à débloquer, ce qui est sympa, quand vous pensez avoir enfin finit un truc et bah non, quelque chose de nouveau apparait, le dev à bien compris que c'est comme celà que l'on garde son public. 

Le jeu est vraiment sympa, à première vue compliquée mais en fait réellement simple, il ne nécessite pas une attention de tout les instants.

Le jeu étant gratuit attendez-vous au cash shop qui ici est aussi bien fait, vous pouvez sortir votre CB et vous faire plaisir, ou bien défaire des dieux à chacune de vos renaissance afin de gagner la monnaie utilisée dans le cash shop. Ce qui signifie que si vous êtes assez patient aucune amélio du cash shop n'est inatteignable ;)

Si je devais donner quelques points négatifs se serait qu'il est dommage que notre avatar, male ou femelle, n'est pas assez d'options de personnalisation, ensuite peut-être que dans le cash shop on pourrait avoir des, je trouve pas le terme exact, des powerup qui permettent de skipper une partie du temps, genre avancer de X heures en échange des god points.

Voilà, sommes-toutes il y a peu de points négatifs ... alors oui le jeu n'est pas en FR, oui il n'est pas spécialement beau, mais personnelement je le trouve bien et vue le prix il vaut le détour :)

Je vous recommande donc ce jeu si vous êtes fan de ce genre de gameplay à la adventure capitalist.",1466715023,1466715023,True,10,0,0.642857134342193604,0,False,False,False,False,,,

And thats the moment that the game would normally annoy you into making a purchase, as designed. But my honest opinion is that the micro transactions are all way too overpriced. Its hard to justify 35$ price tags on anything, in a crappy progress bar game. A genre which I enjoy but lets be honest... 35$ goes a long way on steam and would easily net more than I would get out of any of the purchases. Not that I like to pay to win, because I wont even when its cheap. But a inexpensive upgrade that nets some long term gain is typically tempting.

Its not very visual, its 'progression system' is alright.

So far as features, unlocks, and the like: the game has some, but could use more.  its not as barebones as cookie clicker, or clicker heroes, and there are a lot of little things hidden here or there.  Your mileage may vary.

This game is not Clicker Heroes.

This game is not Adventure Capitalist.

This game is not simple.

This game is not a normal idle game. If you want to be able to make quick and easy progress, turn back now.

What this game is:

It's slow. You will not always feel like you are making progress, and if you aren't paying attention you can easily take a few steps backwards in terms of progression.

It's confusing. Instead of having one main currency and one prestige currency (for instance, Clicker Heroes has gold and Hero Souls), you have four main currencies that double as prestige currencies, based on a number of multipliers that are applied before or after your next rebirth, that may or may not be lower than your current ones. It's not impossible to figure out the way some reviews below are saying, but you won't be able to instantly glance at the game and know exactly what you're doing from the word go.

It's deep. You're given a big hit list of gods to defeat at the start, and in a way the entire list is just the tutorial-as you progress you continually find new mechanics, and just when the game seems like it's slowing down, something new appears that demands your attention. I've put many hours into this game, as you can see, and as of this writing I'm not done with the list yet-which means there's still more in the way of mechanics to unlock.

It's thoughtful. There are a number of systems, all of which tie into each other in different ways that create interesting combinations. Your level of skills is valuable for the special battle system as your skills become active abilities, but leveling them too much will increase your mystic level, which will make the enemies more challenging but not empower you because mystic is irrelevant to battles. Your Shadow Clones can fight in the Battle Tab, but pitting them against an opponent too powerful means they will die-but them dying increases your maximum number of clones on your next rebirth, so maybe you should let them be killed. Monuments increase your stats by quite a lot, but only after you have a lot of creations, so you need to buy them with divinity, which you get from the special battle system, or from the divinity generator. All of these feed into your ultimate goal of making upwards of six different sets of numerals grow to increasingly massive amounts, in order to complete your list of gods at Tyrant Overlord Baal and create a universe. Apparently, only then does the real game begin, but all this complexity occurs before that point. Hell, I've not even unlocked planets yet, which leads to some other ridiculous complication.

This game is not an ordinary clicker game. It's complicated and requires thoughtful decisions, with many sets of numbers that all affect each other in different ways rather than just one or two. If you just want to turn your brain off and watch big numbers become bigger ones, play Clicker Heroes (which, don't get me wrong, is a quality idle game). But, if you're ready to take the next step and see how mind-boggling interacting systems of numbers can be, give this one a shot.

Give it some time. You won't regret it.",1466349965,1466349965,True,294,9,0.937931716442108154,1,False,False,False,False,,,

Do this and beat your first god, it will help out.

Almost everything ingame has tooltips and explanations, there are many info pages which explain a lot of things so someone who reads that can very well play the game without discord. The game also has a nice wiki which gives info about all ingame things which can help players a lot. The game has a lot of content and some secret things which would be impossible to list all ingame.

As for the highscores, yes there are cheaters once in a while. Sadly that is not something which is preventable, some players just cheat and don't care for others. But I purge the cheaters from the highscores once in a while, usually a few times a month, which means that most of the time there are mostly legit scores.

And where am I dishonest and don't respect the players? I always respect players and add a lot of player suggestions to the game and listen to player feedback. There are just so many suggestions and feedback so I can't make it right for everyone. I never was dishonest, if anyone here is dishonest, it is you with your review. That is blaming my game and me for something I which is not true.

Also I have no idea what you mean with removing your progress with unwritten rules. The game has many challenges which can temporarily remove progress, but that is all written ingame as challenge-perk. Otherwise it wouldn't be a challenge.

As for the achievements, like I wrote above I listen to player suggestions and adding new achievements was a player suggestion which was upvoted by many players. Sorry if you didn't like that, but most others who suggested it liked it.
 
So people who read this can decide by themselves, who is in the wrong here. You can also ask others in discord about how I do things. I always try my best to improve that game."

It feels like it was created for the boom of the internet in the 90's, a game that I would have enjoyed in my childhood, maybe.

The interface is just godawful, the tutorial was pretty bad, I was left to fend for myself for the majority of the early game, until I understood how everything worked. You essentially have to check every damn tab on the interface early on to get an idea of what you need to allocate your shadow clones into in order to progress in the game.

Once you reset, you do the same thing again, unlike clicker heroes that gives you some reason to continue, whether it be gear, better monsters, better characters, this game has you fighting with the same damn things, and you just ""train"".

It's pretty user friendly but at the start it might make new players feel overwhelmed (but some great games do also.)

I do recommend this game for many reasons.

Pros
-----

Free (as almost all idle/clicker games)
A pretty rich story despite being an idle game (though I haven't played many so I'm not sure.)
A lot in which the player can do w/o feeling too overwhelmed (fighting, training, creating, and dueling with your pets.)
Daily free draws (in which you can get any one thing, even more free draws.)
Some pretty badass music (imo.)
Super friendly UI in almost all cases.
A pretty fast start actually, beating Hyperion took not even close to an hour and once that's done you can steamroll Itztil after a rebirth (in a quick amount of time from training.)
Little details in which the player can change the color of the layout and dress their person.
The art is nice actually. ""Some DA shit?"" Piss off, this is some nice art and fits with this kind of game.

Now of course the cons because almost all games have some.

Cons
------

Some of the UI isn't there or doesn't help much, like, I don't know what the 'Special' tab does. I'll click on a skill and it says ""Start the fight first"" and I've done that while battling a god.
Creating doesn't have a 'stop at' (stop creating Plants if Soil if Stone is 200 like JDude said.) Tbh I'd like to see that for everything but as a whole is needed.
Unlocking clothes, wings, and stuff is nice but I absolutely hate that it resets to default when I rebirth and I think paying a crazy amount of god power (though once you get there farming won't be hard) is silly for a perm. In fact, if the game could remember what I wore and once I unlock the items it would auto equip would be super freaking cool.
(NOT REALLY A CON) The (as some people think) ""P2W trash"" is crazy expensive. 5 god power for  2.90? That's pretty crazy and I actually think this deters players from buying it. So I don't know where this P2W is coming from.

I'm sure there's more but I can't think of any atm.

I am going to reuse parts of it since those are still true.

Now, when I first noticed the game, I recognized it's type. Idle type games are the sort that you don't need to pay too much attention too. In fact, it usually has an offline mode of sorts that keeps track of your progress. So when you boot the game up, say two days after, then you might find yourself having progressed a lot.

That having been said however, idle type games are also notorious for being hard to finish. Not because of the difficulty, but because the numbers get ridicilously high and because progress seems to slow down by a LOT after a certain point.

Now, one question you must ask yourself, is this pay to win? Because aside from being hard to finish, there are several titles out there that you just can''t finish without having to pay for it. Well, the answer to that question is mixed. Sure, you can keep playing the game without having to pay. But paying real money gets you god power, which lets you boost your character permenantly. Still, you can earn god power for free on your own so if you are patient you technically can get as far as you want. BUT I want to remind you that progress slows down by a LOT and that means you need to spent a lot of time on it. Logging in regularly to direct your character.

Graphic wise, you shouldn't expect anything. In fact, this is mostly numbers and text. Nothing else. 

Story wise... Well, there is a story of sorts, but right now it's halted at the defeat of a certain god and you can get to that god within a week. Definetly.

This particular game awards you for exiting the game completely, if you stay offline for a day or so, I actually don't know the exact number, then your stats increase by a whole three hundred percent for three hours.

My conclussion is much the same as my previous review. This game is excellent if you got some time to waste or if you are bored and you don't feel like booting up a more complicated game.

Would I want to pay for it? No. If you are patient, like REALLY patient then you can get to the end. Coughing up real money seems like a waste. I think that the only time that you would need to pay money is a) if you want to support the dev and b) want to get some handy advantages while you're at it.

So overall, I would recommend the game but I still wouldn't pay for it.",1465158737,1466887230,True,3,0,0.494989156723022461,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There's a lot more to it then one would think.

First off this isn't a CLICKER game. Not like Clicker Heroes, Time Clickers, etc. There are some parts where you click a lot of but it's mainly focused around idling and waiting for stuff. I know, strange that a game with the word IDLING in the title has a lot to do with IDLING, isn't it? Of course you could be an idiot and leave a negative review for just that reason.

Anyway, so here's how it works. You start off as pretty much just a normal guy, stuck on a planet after we humans destroyed our home world....for the 17th time. You end up in a world and universe ruled by powerful gods. Being the last survivor of a war against the god Hyperion, you end up developing your own godlike powers and start to challenge the gods, beginning with Hyperion and progressing up a ladder.

Yes folks this game does indeed have a story, with bits of it being unlocked everytime you defeat one of the gods. Currently the story stops after one of the mid-range gods with nothing remaining for the rest of them, so this might be something that comes in the future hopefully. For now the story that exists is pretty good, as it gives context and reason to your idling.

At its core the game is involved around you training shadow clones, and using these clones to train skills and fight monsters, which in turn raises your own stats. You assign a certain number of clones to each task and wait as your skills get higher. When you're strong enough you challenge a god, and then rinse and repeat until you find you can't beat the next god. At that point you can ""rebirth"" which starts you over but gives you multipliers on your stats; not much different then a lot of other idle games of this style. But there's a fair bit of depth to it, which i'll leave you to figure out yourself once you start playing.

плюсы:
1) в игре очень много возможностей, опций и вкладок. но все они удачно дополняют друг друга, при этом не являясь клонами. во всем есть своя особая задумка, изюминка!
2) наверное главное для кликера - развитие! в начале вы имеете доступ всего к нескольким опциям и по мере вашего прогресса открываются все новые и новые возможности!  вы все время видите перед собой новые цели. и награды за них не пустые ачивки, а новые меню и новые игровые режимы и фишки с которыми вам приходится разбираться и вписывать их в ваше развитие
ПОЛНОСТЬЮ открыть все игровые механики и возможности мне удалось примерно за 2 недели игры!
3) игра ""открывается"" постепенно. примерно по 1 абсолютно новой механике в 1-2 дня, за счет чего она не только поддерживает интерес, но и не перегружена в самом начале.  если бы все было отклыто сразу, разобраться с ходу в такой куче было бы мягко говоря трудно
4) оригинальная и хорошо продуманная математическая модель - нет ни откровенно бесполезных опций, ни имбовых раскладов.  (данная проблемма есть в очень большом количестве кликеров, и чем они сложнее и навороченнее тем проблем больше)
5) игра написана очень простым английским языком. имея обычный ""школьный"" уровень вполне можно прочитать 95% текста без помощи словаря. к тому же открыты почти все внутреигровые формулы. а уж сделать вывод из этих формул и выбрать правильный путь - это наша задача!

минусы:
1) как и любой кликер - он рано или поздно заканчивается :( когда все возможности открыты, все боги и Баалы повержены, все питомцы получены и развиты, все планеты завоеваны, все навыки освоены, все спаринг-партнеры побеждены, все монстры зафармлены, все здания и их апгрейды отстроены, все существа и создания созданы и проч (перечислил далеко не все)  вот тогда вы просто переходите к этапу - фарм уровней и бессмысленное увеличение циферок счета и показателей. к счастью до дойти не так и просто ;)
2) а незнаю...ну наверное вот: какая-то она не модная, технологию виртуальной реальности не поддерживает :)

PS - как всегда в кликерах, НЕ ДОНАТТЕ!!! или если уж понравилось - задонатте и купите красивую одежку. Но не ускоряйте игровой процесс! проще тогда читануть и пройти игру за 20 минут. но смысл? сами себя лишите удовольствия от процесса! тем более тут норм математика и ""заторов на неделю"" в развитии у вас не будет! почти каждый день новый интересный прорыв ;) удачной игры!",1464991903,1464992103,True,27,0,0.718530893325805664,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I was hooked on this almost as soon as I started. Coming off of a recent Cookie Clicker binge, I guess I\'m just not ready to move on from these idle games.
I think the reason these types of games are fun is becuase of the constant  goals you can set and accomplish. 

The game also is not a huge time-sink. You set your clones doing work, and then you focus on something else for a few hours. You come back and now you\'re strong enough to kill the next god.
The pacing of the game is also really well done; you\'re always unlocking new things even towards the end, and each rebirth feels like a new game but less grindy.

The game is also very transparent in how things are calculated. It doesn\'t just throw you in and make you deal with how things work, it very plainly tells you all of the calculations and formulas that are used, so you don\'t have to waste time searching the web for that stuff if you\'re a min/max addict like me.

And whats that? This game is only $0.00? (€0.00 for my friends across the pond)
That is free. This game is free. I like free. Free is best.
This dev is also not aggressive about the fact that the game is free. Sure, there\'s things you can buy in the game, but the dev doesn\'t even attempt to force those things on you or throw it in your face, and I really respect that.

This is an EXCELLENT idle game, and it has a lot of contributing factors to your progression. I will give some pros and cons as to why I think people will enjoy it, or not enjoy it.

Pros:
Exponential gain over time is pretty fun.
You can run it in the background of any games, and move the game without doing much.
It's fun to be figuratively killing gods.
Progress bars can be fun to watch.

Cons:
Time sink, many people will not like this factor.
Idle, many people want something to actually play.
Artwork may be a bit lackluster, thus visually un-appealing.

I did find that i quite like the tooltips. they did give me a few chuckles. However, i found a few more glaring design flaws.
Why is there a feature to limit the max amount of levels on skills, but NOT one to limit the max amount of creations? this means i jhave to watch very carefully if i want to make soil and have some rocks left over, or make air and keep light. Compare this to the absolutely useless ability to stop gaining infinitely extendable resources with zero penalites for making them, tranings and skills.
Also, the fact that pet food's tooltip seems to imply that it actively HURTS your pet isawful, and makes me not want to use it. i assume it doesn't but i'd rather not take risks.
Speaking of pets, why is food so expensive? just let me buy it in divinity!

24 hours in. Haven't progressed much at all, due do a few factors.
1. Offline progression either doesn't work, or is nonexistent.can't tell you which yet, but i'm leaning towards the latter. EDIT: IT WORKS NOW, dunno why it wasn't before.
2. you know how in every other clicker/idle, if it has a prestiege feature, this feature is something you should hold off on using until quite a while in? this game wants, no, DEMANDS you use it constantly.
3. grinding the clonecap down is tedious and boring, and it doesn't appear there is a way to speed up your ability cooldowns in the special minigame. ALMOST FORGOT: it is super counter-intuitive. i get what the dev was going for, i really do. he wanted you to have to keep your skill power and cap grinding time balanced. However, what really just ends up happening is that your low level skills you need to decrease the cap for grow with level, meaning that they do no damage, meaning using them solely to fight (one of the only reasons to use special) will not work. you are literally better off waiting 24 hours in auto before progressing (see point 1) in order to have decent enough skills to grind.
Not sure i'll progress much further before quitting, only redeeming factor so far is the decent fanfiction unlocked by beating a boss.



2 Hours in. this is the slowest clicker/idle game i have ever played. it takes ""less than an hour for newer players"" to even be able to defeat the first boss, in which it is ALREADY reccomended you ascend/prestige/rebirth. In my playthrough, it took 10 minutes to even START fighting! A lot of this is given in the FAQ, which the game starts you in, basically telling you ""read this, this is how you have to play the game, if not you will be entirely lost"". The game doesn't ease you in, either. ot's a complex mess from the start, that i am still slowly figuring out. Also, not a major thing, but te UI grapics are awful. yeah, player graphics arent needed, but when the UI makes me want to be as AFK as possible, there's an issue.

PROS:
Plenty of content
Unique Concept
cool story?

Cons:
Really slow
Incredibly complex
Required FAQ instead of simple tutorials
IRC has caused my game to crash when starting it
Non-permanent achievements

All of these reviews trashing this game for its graphics don't seem to understand Incremental and Idle Games. Trimps has no graphics at all, neither does Swarmsim. So tell me, how do they have active cult followings and hundreds of active players?

Idle and Incremental Games don't NEED graphics. The fact that this one has hand drawn art gives it a heck of a lot of charm to me, and if you choose to be a Goddess then you certainly aren't ugly. In my opinion, she's pretty cute, even without cosmetic unlocks ^^;

The progression is deep and will take you a good while, and content is added pretty often. I played a month or two ago on Kong, and now we have pets.

I mean, pets? I'm a puny mortal suplexing Gods and beating the shizzit out of my Shadow Clone Jutsus, and a Mouse adds  a couple hundred power level to me? Sure :D

On a final note, (and hopefully the arrogance and master race level of this little comment doesn't get too bad,) a true fan of Incremental games will see just how much time and effort can be sunk into this game. I'm an absolute $lut for seeing small numbers get big, and this game scratches that itch so very, very nicely...

    [*] The UI is poorly done, and it doesn't adhere to GUI conventions. For example, there are a lot of things that look like buttons, but they effectively serve as tabs, because clicking them changes the page that's displayed. Just, unlike actual tab controls, there is no visual indication of this whatsoever.
    [*] The game is rather complex, and the numerous pieces of information it displays and the actions you can do are all stuffed into the multitude of hidden pages. There is no simple, sensible layout of all this.
    [*] Speaking of the game's complexity, when you first run it, you'll be greeted by the FAQ page. Its wall of text will try to explain some of the game's multitude of concepts and mechanics to you. Why? Because [b]there is no tutorial[/b]! Instead, aside from the FAQ, there are tooltips on all the UI elements, briefly explaining what they do. You're going to be playing detective for a while to piece it all together.

als Browsergame auf Kongregate gespielt habe.

Es schafft Langzeitmotivation durch immer mehr Möglichkeiten die das Spiel einem bietet,
angefangen von Kämpfe gegen Monster und Götter, über dem Aufbau von Monumenten,
bis hin zum kreieren einer eigenen Welt, bietet dieses Spiel auch fordernde Challenges.

Was für mich auch ein sehr dicker Pluspunkt ist, ist die Möglichkeit des Erhalts der Echtgeldwährung
durch wiederholtes vermöbeln der stärkeren Götter, was positiv für alle Non-Casher ist,
da man so auch ohne Echtgeldnutzung die Möglichkeiten des Spiels voll ausnutzen kann.

Ob man sich nun das Spiel durch ""Speedruns"" aktiver gestaltet oder langsam vor sich hin 
idelt, das Spiel bietet für jeden die Möglichkeit sich hier voll und ganz zu 
entfalten und erfolgreich im Spiel zu sein. 

Für jeden Idlegame-Fan ist dieses Spiel sehr zu empfehlen. :)",1464409851,1464409851,True,5,0,0.557614982128143311,0,False,False,False,False,,,

For example, when I was doing schoolwork I would often keep the game open in another tab (I played on the Kong version before this was released) and complete an assignment, and then go change some things around, spend god power, allocate my clones, etc. Then I would go do another assignment, or some reading.

Das Spiel existiert schon seit einigen Jahren auf Kongregate und ist dort sehr beliebt. 

In diesem Spiel erstellt ihr euer alter Ego und fangt an eure Schattenklone zu erstellen und diese werden dann für euch trainieren und kämpfen. Da diese Schattenklone an euch gekoppelt sind, erhaltet ihr deren erfolge und werdet dadurch stärker. Seid ihr stark genug, könnt ihr anfangen euch mit den Göttern anzulegen und somit immer mehr Kreationen frei zu schalten. Mit diesen neuen Kreationen könnt ihr dann auch Elemente und Gebäude erschaffen, die euch immer mehr stärken. 

Auch gibt es ein Wiedergeburtensystem, welches unumgänglich ist, denn eure Fortschritte geben euch starke Multiplikatoren für eure Werte, wodurch ihr immer stärker werdet und ihr Baal, den letzten Gott, besiegen könnt, aber selbst dann ist das Spiel noch lange nicht vorbei.

Also, worauf wartet ihr noch? Klickt euch rein und werdet mächtiger als die Götter!
