[h1] Story [/h1] Wir spielen einen kleinen Karton namens Newbie und sollen die B√∂sen Wild Cards aufhalten

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 4 Level. Wobei das Erste als HUB World gilt. Die Level sind alle relativ Gro√ü und Semi Open World. Es gibt in jedem Level viel zum einsammeln wie z.B. Goldene B√§nder, Briefmarken & eingesperrte Karton Freunde. Einige der Briefmarken sind im Level versteckt und man muss oft Schalter bet√§tigen um an diesen heran zu kommen. F√ºr andere muss man mit Karton Freunden sprechen und deren Herausforderungen bestehen (Rennen, bestimmte Anzahl an Feinden besiegen usw.). Sterben kann man nicht, wenn man z.B. ins Wasser f√§llt spawnt man wieder am letzten Checkpoint ohne Verluste von irgendwas. Feinde lassen sich mit einer Stampfattacke besiegen, respawnen aber auch immer wieder relativ flott. Die Feinde selbst k√∂nnen uns nichts anhaben sie beschiessen uns zwar mit Feuerwerk und sto√üen uns weg aber Schaden gibt es nicht. Die Grafik ist niedlich und das Gameplay macht Spa√ü

[h1] Achievement Schwierigkeit 7/10 [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 15 Erfolge. Hierf√ºr muss man alle Bosse und bis zu 500 Gegner besiegen, 250 mal die Auspack F√§higkeit einsetzen (extra Sprung) und alle Collectibles finden (Briefmarken, Goldene B√§nder & Karton Freunde. Die Collectibles sind sehr frustrierend zu finden denn in jedem Level muss man 200 Goldene B√§nder finden und es l√§uft immer darauf hinaus das einem 20 oder so fehlen und man keine Ahnung hat wo man noch suchen soll. Es gibt eine In Game Hilfestellung durch einen Karton Freund aber man muss immer wieder zu diesen hin gehen um dann eine kurze Szene zu sehen mit dem Standort eines der B√§nder was sehr schnell frustrierend wird

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Nette Grafik
+ Nettes Gameplay
+ 4 Gro√ües Semi Open World Level
+ Achievements
+ Sammelkarten
+ Deutsche √úbersetzung ist ordentlich
+ XBox 360 Controller Support

+/- Die Collectibles alle zu finden kann sehr schnell frustrierend werden wenn man denn 100% Achievements m√∂chte

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein wirklich Gro√üartiger gelungener 3D Plattformer mit sch√∂nem Gameplay und Gro√üen Levels. Wer Alte Klassiker aus den 90ern wie Super Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie & Co. mochte, der wird auch dieses Spiel sehr schnell ins Herz schliessen. Ein kleines Juwel im Genre, welches ich sehr Empfehlen kann

If you're looking for the old school 3D collectathon vibe with varied minigames/challenges and general exploring without a whole lot of actual threat or anything at stake, this is it. It definitely has a Banjo-Kazooie vibe, despite having no ability progression. The main mechanic is that you can ""unbox"" for an extra jump mid-air. Each layer of box serves as a health point as well, and you can store up to 6. It makes for some interesting maneuvering sometimes, but refills are very generously distributed throughout the maps.
Speaking of, there are 3 main maps plus a hubworld to explore and I found that to be just enough content without overstaying its welcome. Took me about 20 hours to 100% those areas, though I wish the 3rd area had been a bit more of a variation. The first area is a tropical island/beach setup, then a snowy mountain, and then a jungle, which is just too similar to the first area.

Maybe for ""Baby's first 3d collect-athon"" it would be a good deal. Multiplayer, however, is what saves this game and makes it worth watching out for on sales. It's about as fun as 'Gang Beasts' in that regard.

THE GOOD
The tutorial island and World 2 (snowy mountains) had nice location specific gimmicks
* The story mode maps were all littered with fans of sorts, which might sound off-putting, but getting knocked into the air by air currents was an enjoyable method of travel, I'll admit.
* The multiplayer modes are all very entertaining! There is Delivery (racing), Boxing (arena battle), Thief (Coin battle), Oddbox (Fall Guys' take on Tail Tag), and Collect (Zone Control) 
* The inclusion of Bounce (the character, not the jump feature) made 100%-ing this game far less annoying in the long run, since you could essentially talk to him and deduce the location of various objects with the small camera angle he gives you, instead of wandering aimlessly for potentially hours looking for that stupid last roll of tape. (This is the only point I will give Unbox over ""Goat Simulator"" in terms of single player, as finding the trophies in that game with no help was almost impossible.)
* Air mobility feels nice. Using the slam button when your'e jumping over slopes feels smooth.

THE BAD
* In both modes, the player camera is not the greatest.
* The story mode is NOT multiplayer. This was to be expected, since collecting 800 gold tapes would be very convenient that way and this story mode hates convenience.
* The multiplayer mode is NOT actually supported online. You must use ""remote play"" to play with some friends online, which streams your audio and video to them. It's a nitpick, I know, but still.
* In both modes, the hat you are wearing effects the way your character rolls on the ground. This will effect your performance in speedruns and racing mode.
* The actual main story plummets after act 1 of the story mode, but nobody's really here for that.
* Getting off a sled in World 2 crashed my game all 3 times I've tried it. Unboxxing (double jumping) out of the sled however works fine. No idea why this happens. 
* All of the cosmetics in the game are either skins of characters from the story mode or a recolor of a Zippie (this game's take on Toad from the Mario series) which is disheartening to some, since it will mean your character will never truly look like an original work.
* Most of the cosmetic items must be earned in story mode to be used in multiplayer mode, which is extremely lame, since story mode is this game's weakness.
* The main collectible in this game is tape. TAPE??? Really?? These are DELIVERY boxes, the main collectible literally should have been MAIL, it would have made so much sense!!!

Overall, being able to do Steam Remote Play and couch co-op multiplayer on this game makes this game a total winner when it's on sale, and the game typically goes on sale for $5 or even just $3. The story mode even has a few neat ideas for hub worlds for aspiring developers today!",1679082565,1679082565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I wanted to leave a quick review stating that this game does work well on the Steam Deck. It initially starts in 320x240 resolution but that can be adjusted once you reach the main menu. Once adjusted to the proper resolution (it can handle the highest), it works just great. There's a teeny bit of screen tearing around the outermost pixel of the screen's border but I think it's more a display issue than a performance issue.

Now for the edited bit - the game starts off okay, but the jumping controls quickly become more of a nuisance. Some challenges leave you unable to Unbox which means enemies get to send you way off course, timed challenges are frustrating when working against the controls, the environment, and other enemies. Overall it's just not that fun of a game - if you're looking for a platformer, you could probably do quite a bit better. Some upgrades would have been nice, to change box shapes, give additional unboxes, etc. It just has a gimmick and sticks directly to it for the entirety of the game. The only boss (box?) fight that I bothered to do was just unreliable, and it felt like coincidence that I happened to win.",1672025530,1675433685,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Out of all the indie 3D platformers chasing the feelings of the ones from yesterday, Unbox does something the rest fail to do. It doesn't have a fancy roster of attacks - it's mostly a two button game (though not without depth). It doesn't try for faithful 1:1 re-imagining. No 3D Mario complex movement and succumbing to the Nintendo game design mold. No Rare-esque collectathon obsession. It's not trying to be a Banjo 3 or a Super Mario 128. No Yooka-Laylee here.

What Unbox does is manage to capture the *spirit* of those classics. I'd probably consider Hat in Time to be the closest thing to a new, great, spirited 3D platformer. Is Unbox as big or as polished? No. But it *feels* like an N64/GCN classic. More than anything else in its field

-- I couldn't find anywhere else in the review to put this but I feel like it might be of note to say that Unbox reminds me most of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger --

I think it's because it takes it's whole box theme and throws all its weight behind it. There's something incredible charming about moving like a box. You don't play as a box with feet, no. You play and move as a literal box - physics and all. I suppose there's something almost Monkey Ball to the experience in how you have to focus intensely on your movement lest you bounce off in an unwanted direction. And the mechanic of unboxing, what is essentially 6 double jumps you can use strategically, is clever as all hell. It makes me think Unbox successfully overcomes the comparison syndrome ie ""this game is like X"" or ""Unbox is Y + Z"". Unbox feels truly unique and isn't concerned with copycatting its comparisons. It feels like the devs were able to really identify the elements of a 3D platformer and use them as their own without having to drag along the identities of where they came from

It's not perfect. The biggest, most horrific oversight is this objective arrow/compass that takes up far too much of the UI. It's minimized form is visible at all times and it steals what feels like half the screen anytime it appears. Ant it appears anytime you talk to someone. It's honestly baffling that it was kept this way and without any option to disable it. I bound the button that activates it (D-Pad Down iirc) to one of the stick clicks this way I could immediately close it anytime it opens. After that the game became much more tolerable. But you better hope your eyes can mask away the ugly banner.

Having dialogue be consequential as a result really highlights how shallow NPC dialogue is. The named cast are above average but any world inhabitant is bound to say absolutely nothing. The one pseudo-attack you have (you won't be attacking much though) is a slam you preform mid-air. It's bound to B. And it reveals just how...weird the controls are. Jumping and unboxing are mapped to RT/RB and LT/LB respectively. Y is alternating camera views, X is respawn, A is interact (and to skip cutscenes, which is unfortunate because the dialogue boxes are so slow I'd accidentally skip cutscenes anytime my brain auto-ed the A button). It's like someone really, really liked those Dark Souls controls and were deadset on putting them into their platformer. It doesn't not work, but it feels weird. I couldn't find any comfortable way to remap them so I just got use to them. 

Matt Griffin who would later show his insane talent on The Impossible Lair does a lot of the music here and it's fantastic. Sound design all around is great. The artstyle is endearing and it gets points for having a plot that's actually engaging. The movement is weird and I love it. It's such it's own beast that it feels like you're constantly relearning how to play (in the best way possible). The verticality allowed is what I'll remember most from the game. I think it was paced well and, aside from some atrocious load times (you only need to sit through a loading screen once per world but it can take up to a minute) it feels like the game respects your time. Especially when you can talk to Bounce to get hints as to where the last collectables might be. I'm considering picking the game up as a speedrun but trying to maximize movement efficency feels like it'd be a nightmare (Speedrun only has four 4+ year old runs recorded). I usually loathe number scores but in spite of the giant yellow '68' metascore on the store page, I'd say Unbox deserves another 10 points at the very least

The main feature is the physics based movement, similar to Monkey Ball, the one difference being that you roll around a cube instead of a ball. This can cause some frustrations during some more precise jumps, but there is no punishment for failing aside returning to one of the many checkpoints around the map.
You have 6 ""Unbox"" points that serve both as you health meter and the number of extra jumps you can do, refilling the points either by reaching a checkpoint or getting one of the many respawning health pickups around the map.

There are 3 worlds alongside the hub, doing the bare minimum to finish the story might take only a few hours. I took about 10 to finish everything 100% (only missing one of the mystery vials on the last world).
The skill required is low to medium, so this game is on a good spot for young kids.

Each world requires a number of stamps (this game's stars/jiggies) to finish. They show around the map as collectables and as rewards for missions, which can be stuff like races, combat arenas or time trials.
The rest of the collectables (trapped boxes, tape and mystery vials) only unlocks new cosmetics.

There are just better 3D platformers out there even on PC right now. I don't have a problem with the mapping of the controls, but the jank of them and how difficult it is to ACTUALLY control your character make what should be simple tasks often frustrating or seemingly impossible. This is a combination of the control feeling bad, and bad level design. E.g. needing to roll a ball, uphill, into a curbed switch, with no way to actually like, do that but keep bumping into it and hoping the physics work in your favor. Or the ""race"" you do in a car (instead of with your character) where the car just randomly inverts onto its' rear bumper on flat ground and the ""flip car"" button doesn't actually do anything because the ground detection is so faulty.

I honestly think poor level design is like 90% of the games' problem, for me. You have to collect stamps to get through a level, but the hidden stamps have almost no tell range (the tutorial character will show you clips of where they are, but the sections are so samey it doesn't often help), and the challenges given by the NPCs often are designed to just limit or remove your control - I think over half of them either remove your extra jump ability, or stick you in a car, or literally strap something to you that completely breaks the ground detection for your character where I was getting constantly stuck on flat ground, unable to move or do a normal jump. If the challenges were just you doing something in your normal box mode, even with the completely random timers (some I ended first try with 75% of the time left, others I had 2-3 seconds left even though I didn't mess up as bad, it's all over the place) it'd at least be less annoying.

If everything worked well, the game would probably be very easy, but I'm in the last level and it's just gotten more and more frustrating to play - not because of actual challenge, but because of pure jankiness. Initial impression of the game was that it was a cute and somewhat novel take on the genre but it just fails to do anything special and instead suffers from too many weird decisions and poor design. All the worlds could be half their size without cutting anything notable, and there's no fast travel at all. Each stage seems to have a huge area of just ""dead space"" in it that makes traversal take longer for no particular reason. 

If you have played every other 3D platformer out there, and desperately need more, and can get this on super cheap sale, the first world is at least OK. But that's about as much as I can recommend it.",1604306891,1604306891,False,3,0,0.493165254592895508,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There's enough content across the couple of worlds (3 main islands) to keep you entertained for a fair few hours.

The unboxing main skill works really well and the controls are very good (on gamepad at least) for being able to launch yourself wherever you want to go. Seeing something interesting in the distance on the map and being able to move quickly through the air to go check it out never got old.

Puzzles and combat are in there but extremely simple. A few additional ideas in there are ok like driving vehicles but nothing complex or deep. Geared toward the younger crowd for the story etc.

#1: lack of difficulty and content. i am good at platformers, and this was a walk in the park. consequently it took me 6 hours to beat. not only that but there's no replay value. once you've done a mission there's no reason to go back and do it again. 

#2 bad controls. the controls for this game are sub par. you get extra jumps and to activate them you use left click, despite the spacebar being the default jump button. the F key is used for firing rockets and advancing text SOMETIMES. other times its space. this game cant make its mind up with its controls.

#3 jank. the world this game takes place in has many instances of jank and feels pretty unpolished. a low poly version of things will render when you're right next to them. things too far away from the camera are blurred, but the blur effect looks awful. not only that but sometimes levels and missions will have certain elements blurred out when they're in front of the sky when the other half looks regular. level geometry can sometimes trap your box and you have to respawn.

#4 annoying quirks. characters in missions will talk to you all the time while you're doing them and its always annoying. sometimes its helpful but this is rare. cutscenes and box animations are very sub par, with boxes just having a still image as their faces. there are way too many collectibles compared to the required content of the game.

#5 combat in this game feels out of place and unrefined. if you want fun exciting combat go elsewhere because there is auto aim, and the key for firing sucks, and the missles you shoot are homing and the enemies are a cakewalk to avoid, and the bosses are very very very easy as you can respawn infinitely and not loose progress, just long and tedious. yes that was a run-on sentence, there was a lot to run-on about

#5: positives. this game's actual platforming feels unique and is a fresh new experience. it felt very fluid and very satisfying when it worked well. sometimes your box will ""slide"" around too much and make some tight jumps a near impossibility but this is rare and avoidable with better skill. every new area was huge, had lots to explore and was fun. the race missions and primarially platforming missions were by far the best part of the game, and was super fun",1595263799,1595263799,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unbox: Newbie‚Äôs Adventure is a cute casual 3D platformer which I think fit the bill pretty well.

Although it has most of the classic characteristics of an old 90s 3D platformer; bright colourful graphics, hub world, collectables, slightly cheesy story, antagonist and characters, what Unbox does slightly differently is the movement mechanic.
If you haven‚Äôt noticed already, you are in fact, a box. You roll around as said box and you only really have one way of navigating the space or doing anything, which is jumping. No crouching, backflipping, wall jumping or any of that stuff you might possibly find in a usual 3D platformer here. Newbie just jumps to his heart‚Äôs content. You can do a usual jump, but you are also given the ability to double, triple, quadruple jump, ect, upwards of 6 times after your initial jump. You do this by collecting pickups (which actually double as your health). This makes it so you have to make sure you are managing your jumps and stocking up on pickups, it also makes for a quite fun and easy way to get around the maps. It‚Äôs a very basic movement mechanic but it makes it all the more casual really and it was something I appreciated whilst playing this in the mood I was in.
In total there are 3 main levels and a hub area for you to explore, this doesn‚Äôt sound a lot and it isn‚Äôt really but the maps are pretty huge and there are a fair few collectables in each area. This includes 200 ‚Äúgolden packing tapes‚Äù per area, which is a lot! I did have my worries with this at first as I do enjoy collectables in these games but know how frustrating it can be when you have a big map and you have to search every nook and cranny for one collectable you‚Äôve missed. Thankfully the game has enough hints to actually make it very manageable. If you get really stuck, there is a character you can ask who will show you a small preview of where a collectable is. From the preview you can then try and figure out what is in its surroundings to determine where it may be.

 If you played this game and only got the required amount of collectables to move on this would be a pretty short game, but if you, like me, actually for some reason enjoy the collectable collecting in 3D platformers it will take you a significant amount more time to complete.
The game felt really short to me, I blasted through this game in two days in two sittings so I thought it was a really short game but apparently it took me 16.4 hours according to Steam so that isn‚Äôt actually really that short, I just no-lifed the game a little too hard. I was a little sad when I completed it to be honest because I was enjoying how casual this game is.

In terms of difficultly it‚Äôs really easy, there are challenges in the game but they aren‚Äôt really any challenge, usually in these kinds of games there is at least one part of it I get frustrated with and it takes me a few tries (Stupid boss fights (looking at you Yooka-Laylee‚Ä¶) or higher difficulty timed challenges or races) but there was none of that in Unbox. I could completely understand that maybe some people may see this as too easy, but I guess it just depends on what you are looking for. If you want a casual/easy game it‚Äôs great for that, but if you wanted something engaging that gives you a challenge I can see how it may fall short.

All in all it‚Äôs a fun addition to the, what feels like quite a small collection of, old style 3D platformers here on Steam.",1590922294,1590922294,True,6,0,0.607135236263275146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

1) The attention for detail is extraordinary in both games;
2) For a 2D game I was surprisingly immersed into the Wuppo world due to the OST, character development, (humorous) story and atmospheric worlds, so I was motivated and felt to make progress vs. I didn't feel engaged with the 3D world and its  characters in Unbox; e.g. a forgettable, mellow OST that works counter-productive, I couldn't care less about any of the shallow chars and their unintelligble and sometimes annoying voices, and the story is lackluster. It's nice to be on sunny islands or icy mountains, but if there's nothing that keeps you moving but being a bit creative here and there ‚Äî and you don't really feel you're making progress either ‚Äî then why bother with further emptiness?!

The first world is brimming with charm; from the boxes that follow you around and welcome you to the little cars you can drive. I always think that you can tell the quality of a 3D platformer by how much you want to just forget about the point of it and explore, and this one had me doing it from the start (which is frustrating that it starts with a locked in tutorial).


Amount of content -

1x Hub World
3x Quest Worlds

Each world will take you around 2hrs minimum. I think most people will play it for between 8-10hrs and it took me 16hrs to 100% it. There is enough content to warrent the asking price, especially when you consider that the quest worlds are considerably bigger than a level in a game like Banjo.

Gameplay -

On the surface this is a collectathon like Mario64, Banjo etc, but it is not just copying them and I love the fact that it is also trying to bring something new to the table, which comes in the form of the unbox mechanic. This allows you to jump up to 6 times without landing, enabling crazy big jumps. The game suggests your health is connected to the unbox mechanic, however there are very few things that actually make you lose health which for me does diminish the excitement of it by the end.

Another way in which it builds on the platformers it takes inspiration from is the amount of character interactions. Not only are their quests to find, but people to talk to about the world you are exploring adding further flavour to the world you are tumbling through.

The difficulty of the game is similar to the likes of Banjo with a mixture of stupidly easy to more fiddly tasks. However the tone of the game gives you the feeling of relaxed fun even when trying to judge the gap between two distant boats you want to jump to.

Finally there is the customisation of your plain brown box. Completing the tasks and parts of the story lead to customisation unlocks which means you can turn your boring packaging into a weird bounding wonder. So if definining the protagonist your way is important to you then it is there and it is easy to do (you just need to find the tailor, which took me about 10mins after the first island unlocks).

Graphics and Technical Stuff.

The graphics are a mixed bunch with a combination of some great water textures and rock textures combined with some very plain ones mixed in, which works for the most part but at times can seem a little strange (watch the video above and you will see what i mean). However I found its short comings did not hinder the gameplay, which based on the first world I love.

It has an uncapped framerate and on my 970 rig will all settings maxed I was getting around 100fps at 1080p and there were no noticable major dips or stuttering. You can adjust things like FOV if you want and I know this is an important issue for some.

I would like to note that the game did crash for me while I was messing with the settings, but I suspect this was my firewall, because when I logged back in I had to allow the game access to areas my firewall didn't auto allow. After this initial crash I had no other bugs or crashes playing the game, however there was a little screen tearing which was largely removed by uncapping the framerate (others have suggested turning on vsync in your GPU control panel).

Controls -

How the character controls is important in a platformer as much as any other and I found the controls to be good; although controlling an object with sharp corners meant I needed a few moments to get to grips with how the box handles (because it does handle like a box and not like a ball). The vehicle controls do feel a bit looser and I am not sure how much that is me or the game.

The developers recommend a controller and because it is a 3D platformer I would agree, however I found it perfectly playable with WASAD and a mouse (mouse controls the camera and unbox mechanic while keyboard is used to move jump and interact). I could not get my DS4 to work with it natively, if that is how you like to game. However it worked great with my Xbox Elite and its paddles.

One issue I forgot to mention when I reviewed this initially was the fact that the controls are not customisable. So if that is a major issue for you, then you will need to take that into consideration.

Multiplayer -

This is local only and while it looks fun from YouTube videos I never had a chance to play it.

For Parents -

There is nothing in this game that would not be suitable for children of any age. The fact that enemies do not damage you, (only push you flying into the air and into the water grrr) and the fact that all enemies are boxes make it very kid friendly. Humour and tone has some more mature ideas but there is nothing sexual or particularly violent underpinning this game.

Overall-

All in all, I think this is a great game and I love my time within it. It is the 3D platformer I have been waiting for and wet my appetite for Yooka next year.

The game seems to be a platformer, but the controls and character movement of Newbie (your character) are... frustrating, to say the least. I spent almost five minutes trying to jump up one area to get a collectible, with the following issues: 1. Since your character is a box, and you ""roll"" around (even in the air??), precise jumping is near impossible. 2. Rolling around is either too fast, or too slow, even when changing the sensitivity of the analog stick. 3. The box physics is almost *too* good, because as you'd expect, square edges don't make for smooth rolling (thus, #1). 4. Jumping is almost never high enough to get you where you need to be, except when you overshoot it and then you jump way too high/far. This includes the ""unbox"" jump, which is incredibly high yet also hard to judge just how high.

On the initial ""platforming"" segment on the island, if this was almost any other 3D platformer I have ever played, I could have made the jumps easily within a minute or so, and MAYBE even fallen once or twice in the process. But no! Not here! It literally took me nearly 15 minutes just to go through the tedious and frustrating process of jumping a total of maybe 6 times to get to the different platforms. Mind you, I'm not the best platformer guy out there and I tend to fall to my death more often than I would like or should, however the controls/movement in this game simply make it absolutely unplayable for me.

Unfortunately, in the second hub area, I quickly and repeatedly encountered a game-breaking bug - where toboggan sled rides can too-easily end in a game crash/exit. This prohibits further progress and full enjoyment of the game, and it's a shame, because the sled rides in a snowy area (contrasted with the tropical first level) were otherwise really fun. It seemed the sled physics, paired with jumping out of the sled, just couldn't be handled by the in-game engine (it's not my rig - and the bug carried over across a couple of my computers, game uninstall/reinstalls, etc).

Maybe there's potentially lots of great material in the game that I haven't played... but for the time being (and for more than a year prior to writing this review - still not fixed as of this writing despite having applied all updates and checked back in), I haven't been able to access it, and it hasn't been patched despite this persisting a long time, so I may never know.

As far as the gameplay goes, it's some solid fun, but there's a lot to unpack here.

It's a reasonably short game, each level requires stamps to take on the boss and access the next level, each level requiring more stamps than the previous. Majority of them you earn through some seriously fun minigames (fun boss fights too!), unfortunately you may find yourself drudging through the nicely designed thematic levels to find the remaining hidden stamps which can be a bit of a box-ache to find - which is part of the game I suppose, however on the last level it felt a bit excessive.

The quirky world, story and inhabitants are enjoyable, and the janky movement is good fun when you get the hang of it. As a game about exploring nooks and crannies the levels are really well thought out and creative.

Although I didn't manage to find all the hidden logs and gold tape scattered across the levels, I don't feel an urge to continue playing to hunt them down unfortunately, so replayability is based on whether you want to do that.

Your box character can be customised, with new boxes and accessories unlocked through the activities or collecting all the tape on a level. Personal favourite box was the Shark, with a moustache accessory, classy af.

---

I definitely recommend Unbox, especially if you're looking for a casual time waster / brain switch off game, or something child friendly!
Side note: It's also available on Switch, which might be preferable.

The game is somewhat of a pushover, but that could be just my experience from playing thousands of hours of these type of titles, but there's nothing too difficult about this apart from maybe some of the challenges and awkward controls and combat. There is almost no punishment to dying or failing, levels are pretty straightforward, if not far too spread out.

My main frustration came in trying to jump around and finding myself constantly overshooting platforms as well as managing to get shoved in some random specific geometry. Enemies will ruin your day and seem a bit too hard for an otherwise easy trek of collecting.

While the game tries to be helpful, it goes pretty overboard with telling you that something is nearby, shoving hints, health, and checkpoints almost every ten feet, and repeats past advice.

Overall, this is simple fun.

And the first hour or two prove that this game has amazing potential. Unfortunately it was all squandered.

Let's start with the posititves: the overall feel of the game is cute, innocent and lighthearted to 11. Playing the first stage felt liberating and the mechanics seemed perfect. There's a lot of places to visit, micro challenges to tackle and collectibles to get. Climbing the radio tower is probably the best the game has to offer. But as I played more stages and delved deeper into the mechanics, I realized the fatal flaw of the game, the thing that totally breaks it for me. [b]YOU'RE A BOX[/b]

Hear me out: it could be original, funny and a nice way to make this game stand out from other collectathons, but we need to look at the controls and gameplay itself to understand my issues.

What's the most important thing in a 3D collectathon platformer? Tight controls and freedom of movement. Tight controls make platform challenges interesting and freedom of movement gives new and veteran players alike multiple ways to move around the stages. Not to mention that movement itself can be incredibly satisfying in of itself due to variety of moves you can pull off. Why I bring this up? Because those two [b]crucial[/b] concepts, I refuse to continue playing.

First off, the platforming is physics based. Because you're a box and you roll around the environment instead of having legs or something, not all jumps are consistent and it all depends on how you land, where you land, how steep is the slope and how fast you move. That means if you want to be fast you have no idea how high you'll jump, in what direction and how far it'll reach, resulting in very frustrating moments. It's hard to enjoy the game if you're so unsure of your own movement. To counterract this, the game brings you the ""unbox"" ability, which are disposable multi-jumps in the air that refresh back to full by collecting health crates or by reaching check points. Again, good idea on theory, but it has nasty side-effects.

Because you can make up to six jumps in mid-air, the level design suffered greatly as a result. Everything is too far away to accomodate this and most stages are just islands far apart with a singular obstacle course between each of them, making stages more linear. That ""unbox"" mechanic seems like a band-aid for the floaty controls and box-related platforming. In theory, wasting multiple jumps makes fighting enemies harder, but they aren't even that big of a threat, just a big annoyance. To beat them, you either get a weapon and shoot at  them or spam jump+attack near them to get rid of them. There's no challenge or point to it.

If your 3D platformer is hard to control or is inconsistent, it's a huge minus in my book. Even the amazing presentation won't salvage. You can argue how good the game is to actually master the controls, but if I can get into any other collectathon game like Super Mario 64 and have an amazing time with the controls in the first minutes, while at the same time still being challenged and impressed by the speed and flow of advanced moves hours in, I consider it a failure.

Then you listen to the music and realize that it's not that amazing. It sounds fake and bland. I have no idea how to put it into words.

Playing as a self delivering cardboard box is fun and creative, and once you get used to it the movement is a ton of fun to handle (except for a couple of times when you are forced to drive vehicles with tank controls). The challenge is not amazingly high, but it remains consistently enjoyable throughout. Unlocking and changing costumes and accessories for your character is also a nice touch, as you can make your box progressively more absurd as the game goes on.
 
The only questionable inclusion is the long-jump mechanic which tends to remove some of the difficulty from the platforming challenges. I personally had the most fun and found the most challenge in the missions where you weren't allowed to use it, so I generally ignored it when traversing the overworld. To be fair the small number of times you are allowed to use it before needing to either collect more powerups or return to a checkpoint limits its overall utility, but I still find it a bit of a crutch. I suspect the devs may have included this mechanic because the player (being a square box) sometimes gets stuck in the world geometry, and you need the extra boost to get going again.

Previous critics have been rather harsh on the game for its technical issues and crashes, but I don't think this is really warranted. Yes I did crash multiple times, especially when playing through proton on linux, but the game autosaves VERY frequently so I never ended up losing any progress. I think the low metacritic score the game has is undeserved, and for the price (just a few dollars) it is a solid entry in the mostly empty collect-a-thon genre.",1552030954,1552030954,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Default controls are awful. Jump is universally space bar or A button on Xbox controller. Not this game. Had to use alternative control scheme #1 to get A to jump. The rest of the review mentioning buttons will be the Xbox controller.

Your health bar doubles as a mid-air jump count. You get a maximum of six health. Multi-jumping is a different key. Why not activate while in midair and using the jump button like any other game that multi-jumps? Use action should be B and attack action should be X or something and be context sensitive towards the situation like in other 3D games. Engage conversation with a trigger button? No thanks. That should be B. Attack? Can only slam the ground with X button.

Movement feels imprecise. Because you are controlling a cardboard box rolling around, you can't move in a straight line because box physics. When you want to stop, you have a little momentum going, and trying to stop makes you fight with the controls. Controlling the camera jumps all over the place. All these issues make it annoyingly difficult to land on platforms.

Driving controls are stupid too. Cars are very unstable and can't maneuver well without going in some direction you don't want it to go. I've played games with more stable car controls.

You play as a box and need to collect stamps, tape, outfits, and do quests for other boxes to do that.
The gameplay is fun, rolling around as a box is a bit unweildy at the beginning but it becomes more like rolling a lumpy marble than anything. I found that I spent most of the time jumping to get around.

The Good:
-Theres a box you can talk to at any time and he'll give you a helpful hint as to where the nearest collectible item is, this is especially useful when you only have a few ones left. What's not fun is when the camera doesnt show a lot of details, and you have to talk to him again to get a hopefully better angle.
-Movement is great and fluid! It's really easy to get around the map, there are fans that blow you to other places, and cars too.
-Items make a noise when you're close so you know that they are near, super useful!
-Great Controller support, seriously, if i switched from m+k to controller mid jump, it would register it. 
-SPLIT SCREEN!!!!

The Bad:
-It has no real soul, yeah the environments are cool but you're doing the exact same thing in them: collecting items and talking to people. This gets really boring after a while, as there isn't anything to really break up the monotony.
-Water is the only real hazard you have, as the Wildcard boxes are really easy to avoid.
-Not a lot of content in terms of gameplay. The worlds are mostly empty and not particularly pretty when viewed from afar.
-Unable to rebind keys...what???
-A game crashing glitch.


I like the game but unlike crash or banjo, it lacks content! I'm just collecting things! There are few enemies, puzzles, anything! This is STRICTLY a collect-a-thon.

I have a hard time hating the game because it's cute and well made. I don't hate it and I think its fun but at the same time it felt more like a chore to complete than an actual game. If you like collecting things you'll love this game, but up until about the last level, there wasn't a whole lot of interesting missions or puzzles to do. If steam asked whether or not I liked the game I'd say that I did, but it's asking me to reccomend it to others. I'm really on the edge of whether or not to give positive or negative because of this. I think for $10 or less, it's worth it. for $20, maybe not unless you really love the genre. 

I'd give this game a 5/10, but I don't really know if that's valid since there isn't really any other modern comparisons in the genre. I'm giving it a thumbs up because above all else it was at least entertaining and original, but I have a lot of reservations about the game and hope if they make a second one, they'll add more features.",1545295797,1545295797,True,2,0,0.534180283546447754,0,False,False,False,False,,,

You're a box.. In an adorable world where there the concept of death doesn't exist even for your bitter enemies. You have to adventure around, doing few tasks along the way.. Mostly collecting stuff, racing, or just running around. Controls are a bit tricky at first but you will soon get used to them. You see, you're a box.. You don't have legs so you will have to jump around or just roll on your sides.. And as a box, you have a 90 degree edges everywhere making your movement a bit awkward.. You will be having a bit of a hard time at first moving around but it only takes an hour or so before you master it. Other than the tricky movement, the game is for casual players.. There are rarely any challenges involved.
Story is only there to give you an objective, not that amazing but something to make do. Gameplay is a lot of fun with all of these rolling and jumping around (And certainly, unboxing, which is a special move you will learn about as soon as you get into the game).

The game supports local multiplayer which is a lot of fun as well, i would even go further and say it is even more fun the campaign itself.. A lot of possibilities in this mode.

‚ú¶ Summary: Although I do not have many hours in this game, I can say that it is an interesting concept that was executed well. The game looks amazing and maintains a high FPS on max settings while I was playing it. Unbox also provides unique level designs that let you mindlessly explore to your heart's content, for a completionist it doesn't provide too many hours of gameplay. However, this game is not for everyone but for people who enjoy a rather at your own pace adventure game. In my opinion, this game is not worth 20$ because the story is not free-flowing and only appears at certain parts of the game while the rest is time spent golden duct tape and other collectibles. But, still gets recommended :).",1533320081,1533320081,True,0,0,0.458515256643295288,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's certainly not for everybody though.

I want to recommend this game.  I rather loved this game.  There are two things that really bother me:
Bad hint system for the golden tape.
A bug they haven't been able to fix.

The game is super fun, and if you just want to mess around as a box flying through snowy mountains, a tropical island with a volcano, and a beach resort under construction, this is totally worth the buy.

Unfortunately, there is a tedious feeling when playing (it's a collectathon, so to be fair, that's what it was going for) with a poor hint system that sometimes gives a hint of a wall due to the camera's placement.

As for the bug, I have no chance to finish this game unless I get the chance to visit a friend (and I'm even skeptical of that)
On the third area (Isla Cartulina) one of the stamps cannot be obtained.  You are supposed to defeat 20 enemies in 1:40.  I can defeat 19 within approximately 30 seconds now due to the number of times I've played this.  The problem with that 20th enemy?  It does not spawn in.  I contacted the devs and they have said they can't replicate the bug, so it can't be fixed.  Be aware if you want to obtain 100%, there is a chance you cannot do so.

So even though I gave this review a no for recommendations, it's a great game that is worth a play if you're okay with it being unfinishable.

If you liked Banjo Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, Super Mario 64 or any other 3D Jump n' Run with open world missions to do and funny stuff with a lot of happy positivity you will love this one!

""Unbox"" is called the multijump you perform by unboxing your cardboard box out of an outer cardboard box √† la russian Matroska style and ejecting you in unknown heights! You can do this 6 times and as this is meanwhile also your health means that when you're at 0 Unboxes/health and an enemy hits you another time, your cardboard box pops up and you respawn at the next post box. But that is not throwing you back, because you keep the collectibles you got before, which is the main task here. You just lose a bit of way, but that is peanuts and negligible.

It is a physics based movement system powered by Unreal Engine 4. It makes really fun to just move around the beatifully made world. I had a big grin just moving around, trying to control the movement. It's a quite interesting movement, because the shape of your box with its edges and corners makes a difference for your speed and jump height, so you have to time your jumps well to reach the most speed or height. The movement reminds me of Marble Blast, but as a cube and not a marble.

Its very unviolent and appropriate for kids of every age in my opinion. What comes closest to violence are exploding TNT boxes blasting a hut or you are shot with colorful fireworks so that you have stars over your head. You beat other enemy boxes by falling on them as in Super Mario. In this game when you fall onto an enemy box they get yellow ducks hovering over their heads to indicate they are confused and don't attack you now. And what I find really cute and funny is that when you hit them again these ducks fall down on the ground to be 3D objects which can be pushed and shoved aside. When an enemy box or your box ""dies"" there pops up some styrofoam wisps from the damaged cardboard boxes, no blood, no ""argh"" sound, just a happy ""poof"", some styrofoam, that's it. Or the cardboard box gets wet, they don't like that, hehe.

The difficulty is easy. All controls are quickly understood, I felt home right at the start. It's an easy and relenting game. You will have much fun with movement mastering, challenge beating and exploring. Absolutely manageble for elementary school kids. Though there are some harder, but manageble challenges which want to be conquered. But all in all its an easy play without much tension or frustration but happy boxes, colors and music being everywhere (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)

If you love 3D platformers like I do and like games that are a bit silly, you'll most likely enjoy this game.

In Unbox, you'll play as a cardboard box who rolls (as well as a box can roll) and jumps around 3 large levels plus a hub world collecting Golden Tape (collectable coins) and Stamps (for when you complete challenges), find hidden Stamps throughout the world, and rescue other boxes called Zippies that are imprisoned in little cages. You can also customize your box's appearance.

Something I loved about the game is that you can get help if you're struggling to find the collectibles - the Golden Tapes are *everywhere* throughout the level (like hidden in trees, under bridges, on islands that in other games just seem like the background and nothing else, etc.). Help comes in the form of your box friend named Bounce showing you an actual screenshot of the area so you can hopefully recognize the surrounding areas and go get 'em.

I'm sure this game can be completed in far fewer hours than my playthrough. I logged 16 hours but that's because I felt compelled to play to 100% completion.

Pros/Cons:
+ Lovable characters
+ Character customization
+ Unlockable hats/costumes/accessories/characters
+ 'Unbox' mechanic means you can jump 7 times in a row-- very fun to use.
+ Huge maps
+ Races/challenges
+ Vehicles
+ Hidden areas
+ Silly humor
+ Good music
+ Very forgiving with many well-placed checkpoints
+ There's an NPC to help you find collectibles.  
+ Collectibles have distinct audial cues.

- There was a puzzle area that twice left me unable to move-- meaning that I had to force quit the game and do the puzzle all over again.  
- Dismounting a sled upside down will crash the game.  
- The symbol for rockets will sometimes be left on your screen.  
- Controls feel clunky at first-- and its hard to be precise with jumps.  
- Vehicle controls were a bit awkward.
- The guide-arrow that leads you to NPCs does not lead you to the collectible finding NPC.  
- When you hide the guide arrow, talking to an NPC or reading a signpost will automatically bring it back up-- a little annoyance.  
- The game is 20$ and I only got ~14 hours of playtime, and most of that was collectible hunting.  The story could be rushed in ~5 or so hours.  

Overall: 
I am a sucker for 3D platformers.  This one is no exception.  It was nostalgic, it was goofy, it was fun.  Though the controls tended to feel a little clunky at first (playing as a rolling box and all...), they were surprisingly easy to get used to.  The unboxing mechanic was fun-- something I've not seen before.  Being able to jump so many times added a whole new level of maneuverability.  I definitely recommend this to anyone in the mood for a good 3D platformer.",1518859848,1518859848,True,16,0,0.699415624141693115,0,False,True,False,False,,,

A number of Steam users have likened it to the N64 era, but to me, it gives off a bit of a GameCube vibe as well. Unbox has stunning visuals and big immersive worlds, putting me in mind of choice stages from Super Mario Sunshine, and the sea rig which serves as a hub world always makes me think of De Blob.

There were a few things I took issue with. Sometimes the game crashed when I sped up on downhill ice in the second level, and I feel like the third level could have been something other than a second island (though it was more interesting than the first). As for the collectables, there really wasn't a whole lot to get. I feel like the gold tape could have been cut down to 100 and you could have included a couple of other things. Time achievements for the race challenges would have also been a nice inclusion.

It's a great game and easy for the most part, with a few parts requiring a little more patience. It did seem like a lot was packed into just three levels. Five probably would have been enough. I personally would have liked a city level instead of two island levels, but I've had a lot of fun with it and look forward to a sequel, should that happen.

The levels are massive but generally well-designed; the first two are sectioned off into smaller chunks and the third is so well designed that I don't even mind that it's more of one big area (though kind of sectioned off by the big mountain in the middle).

The game is pretty easy though; rarely is there any challenge to be found in the platforming itself. Aside from like, three challenges in the last world I never failed a single challenge and the ones I did fail there had more to do with the awful car controls than anything else. And there's a few platforming segments where you're not allowed to unbox, which can be a little tricky. I think that aside from the challenge time limits getting a bit more strict though there's basically no difficulty curve to this game. Heck, the first boss was the most difficult of the three and the tower in the first world is probably the hardest actual platforming segment in the game.

The unbox mechanic (basically just 6 extra jumps) is really interesting in terms of exploration though. It lets you get around places quickly but it's not unlimited, meaning you do have to scrounge for health to get your extra jumps back. And the way the game gives hints is pretty solid too, it doesn't directly tell you where stuff is but gives you a random camera angle of the location of what you want to find & expects you to figure out where it is. In some places it can be helpful, but there are other instances where it gives you a nondescript location and a useless camera angle which is basically no help to anyone. It's better than having to comb over the massive levels for that last gold tape though.

It does feel like the game improves over time, too. The third level is definitely the best but I'd say the second is also generally better than the first, which just feels a bit... barren in spots. All three levels could probably serve to be a bit smaller, the scenery gets a bit repetitive over time, but ehh. It's fun enough to play around in and find things even when you're not really being challenged and honestly sometimes you just want a dumb easy game to relax in.

Also yeah visually the game looks great, aside from the complete lack of any animations necessitated by literally every character being a box. Seriously, I don't think there's a frame of genuine animation in the entire game, just static objects moving around. And it's like, okay, but the world does feel a bit lifeless as a result, at times. The soundtrack is kind of... there. The main hub song and the first level's song are miditastic and sound kind of bad, the second level and third level have solid tunes that didn't get on my nerves after an hour or two of exploring though so I'd say they're alright. And the music does get slight variations depending on the vicinity of some NPCs, which is kind of a nice touch.

I'd say overall you could definitely do better in terms of 3D collectathons, and even with the three large levels the game is still fairly short - 100%ed it in about 11 hours according to steam, so. If you can get it on sale and want a relatively chill game to screw around in I'd say it's worth your time and money. It does feel like a lot of heart went into the game though it's also decisively not aimed at me but, yeah, it's alright enough.

-it had nice colors and visuals
-the hitboxes worked well
-they actually had implemented a destruction system in their cities while fighting
-interesting worlds

however I cannot give it a recommend rating due to many issues the game suffers from

first the glitches
-sometimes you get stuck where the only way to get out of it is to unbox (this happens when going uphill sometimes however it drastically happens more often when you are tethered to something)
-jumping off a sled while sideways or upsidedown causes game crashes
-sometimes the game dosent bring up button prompts (such as when completing a challenge usually it says press f but sometimes it dosent come up)
-in my first sit down when I had started up the game it had launched 2 instances of the game so I had annoying menu music playing in the background the whole time over the main game music (i exited the game and it brought up the second game which is how i found out that it had launched 2 clients)
- many checkpoints in the last level were faded out as if you were seeing them from far away even when right next to them

second the gameplay
-movement with rolling with a box while done realistically is kinda annoying making it both faster and easier to just jump everywhere the majority of the time
-the jumping mechanics are ok not bad but really not great either
-cars feel like you are driving on butter roads and it's flipping mechanic isn't really reliable often it would take 2-3 attempts to flip a car
-the worlds are really big but they feel empty because of the way the rewards are set up
-most of the npc's that talk dont even give any type of useful information in any way
-sometimes when done talking to someone or coming out of a shop or respawing i would be bounced away from where I should have been (usually off a cliff)
-the story is really slow in the beginning and it cant be skipped

basically this game had a TON of potential but it never really hit the right notes (like a typical middle school band playing the main theme from pirates of the carribean)

they had too much reliance on stamps where when you completed a quest you would recieve a stamp and a cosmetic and it took a certain amount of stamps to go and fight the boss and you would be able to do the next map there really felt like no reward from going and getting collectables

saving boxes gave 1 cosmetic if you save all of them per level
and WOW it take 200 thats right 200 gold tape to get 1 cosmetic item per level and the levels are actually quite big

you start with six unboxings (super jumps) it would have been smart if they would have tied all the cosmetics to the gold tape so every 20 gold tape you collected or so you would get a cosmetic and then they should have tied finding the purple future things with leveling up your jumping mechanic so you would really be searching for those to increase exploring potential that would have fleshed out the world and then also made saving the boxes from cages giving partial stamps or something like that and made npc's tell you hints about hidden items around the islands

so all in all not a terrible purchase but just not good enough for me for a recommended vote I hope they make a 2nd one that fixes those core issues",1515919121,1515919536,False,3,0,0.518986940383911133,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Unbox: Newbie's Adventure is an open world platformer where you play as a box. Confusing enough? Wait for the story. You are the latest employee of a self delivery box company and you have to destroy the company enemy. How complex... 

I have to say that the game has surprisingly good graphics, despite some glitches here and there, some of those lead to gamebreaking bugs where you have to make a restart since you become stuck under or inside the scenario. 

The soundtrack suits the levels, but each soundtrack is short and repetitive. They end up abruptly and that makes it even worse. I've liked the ""voice acting""‚Ä¶ ok, there's none tbh, but all boxes have a clear personality that we can associate with a voice. That was quite well managed by the team, and the final result is quite good. 

2- GAMEPLAY 

Jumping and make precise landings with a square box is quite tricky. The box never lands straight and the movement, as expected, is clunky. I know that the objective is that, but the controls are not easy to grasp, even with mouse and keyboard. With a controller is simply one of the worst experiences I had with a game. After you get the hang of it you start to take some fun from the game. It reminded me of Crash Bandicoot and overall, I've liked to explore and do all the missions. 

The missions were a bit repetitive, but I was never annoyed during them. Some are harder than others, but there's no sense of progression, some of the hardest are at the beginning, some of the easiest at the end. For instance, the first boss battle was the hardest one for me. 

Interestingly enough you can also drive cars. Don't ask you, as a box, can drive. Just do not think about it, ok? Driving is not a fun experience, since... well, ‚Ä¶ controls again. 

There are tons to explore at all levels, and a lot of collectables to find if you like to do that. I've finished the main campaign in about 8 hours, but you can easily take the double of the time finding all stuff and talking to everyone. The replay value of the game is here, in collecting everything. 

The game has some local co-op and you can play with 3 more friends if you wish. 

3 ‚Äì CONCLUSION 

The mix of genres in this game is interesting and I have to say that I've liked it. Beautiful and colourful landscapes, a fun open world to explore and much stuff to do. Very well conceived characters, lots of humour and references to pop culture. The controls made me not want to explore more and is certainly the worst of this game. Even so, if you find this game cheap, give it a go. It's not the best game in the world, but it's very competent and it did not disappoint.

At first, this game was very frustrating, since you are a box...I do love unique and new game mechanics, so this game quickly grew on me :)

I adjusted the camera sensitivity down, which ended up making thing much better.  I also used a controller, which is probably ideal.

It is a unique and cute concept, basic 3D adventure, but as a bouncing box.  This puts an excellently unique and most times frustrating spin on the adventure/action classic.  You move unevenly and often bouncing in undesirable direction, which means you have to change your way of thinking about motion.

All in all, there is lots of game play here (This game is HUGE), great level design and a good amount of open world scavanging for hidden/scattered collectibles.

Humorous and playful, with beautiful graphic design...Definitely worth a play through!


ACHIEVEMENTS:  Mostly story based with a few collectibles, so not too difficult.  There are a few time trials, which I am not a fan of :(

The game is pretty, I'll give it that. The controls are actually pretty solid, and I had a lot of fun navigating the world. That's probably why I played as long as I did. 

Many things turned me off from the game though. About 20 minutes is spent explaining the *incredibly* simple game mechanics, that could be shown off in-game, or even just a box popping up to the side, if the devs really wanted to ensure I wasn't confused.

As the game progressed, it never let go of my hand.

""Remember to save the Zippies!"" it says, over and over until I flip the switch to the Zippy cage I'm next to, thus, removing any real feel for discovery, or even that I'm doing anything for myself.

""I hear a stamp nearby!"" it also repeats, again, removing any personal discovery I felt.

This sort of went on and on, with lots of hand holding.

First up, presentation. This game call itself a 90's style 3D platformer and I believe they really nailed that feel. It feels like a nice modern version of games like Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie. The art style is a nice mix between cartoony and realistic. It's made in Unreal so the textures look great and as shiny as ever. The music in this game is a real joy to listen to, particularly on the first world. The level paradise isles has a lot of steel drum music which is so reminiscent of Super Mario Sunshine. The particle effects are pretty lovely as well, and there a good amount of them with all the explosive boxes lying around and the sheer amount of enemies as well. The only real negative I have is the ""voices"" of the other boxes, it does the thing where they just kind of make noises instead of saying words and I don't really like that. Overall though, super nice presentation.

Gameplay

For Gameplay, I'm a little mixed. So the basis of this game is you're a box that rolls around, and yes that doesn't really make sense, as well as jump and unbox yourself, which acts as an additional jump. Your main goal is to do missions that enable you to collect stamps, this game's version of stars, and once you have enough stamps you can fight the boss for each level. There's also gold tape lying around everywhere which you can collect to cash in for customization. Very simplistic, again it's set up very similar to Super Mario 64, more or less a clone of it. Most of my problems lie in the movement. I feel the controls are a little bit sluggish, partially because you are moving around a box, but you don't move immediately when you push forward and you don't stop immediately either. That sorts of makes sense to an extent, but it is just hard to be precise with the controls because you are a box and when you land you rarely land flat on one side so you kind of bounce in any direction. I guess that is some of the charm of the game, but I'm just kind of meh on it. Another problems with the movement is that since you really don't roll very well, the only real way to most quickly is to just jump around all the time. I do want to explain the unbox system as well. You have a number in the bottom left that serves as your health and your second jump. The number goes as the way to 6. So you can possibly have six extra jumps that allow you to reach higher places or traverse big bodies of water. There's health boxes around to replenish this number, plus you can go to a checkpoint to get it back to full automatically. I really like this system, and it makes the game far more enjoyable. The last thing I want to touch on is the missions. While they are nothing revolutionary, they are varied enough to keep you going. They can range from your typical fetch quest, to a race, to destroying enemies, to scaling buildings, and much more. Overall for gameplay, I like certain aspects, but there's a good amount of stuff that I don't like as well.

Content

Content is where this game falls flat in my opinion. There's 3 worlds, each with 18 stamps. You need 10 stamps to fight each boss. To just beat the game without collecting all the stamps on average takes a little less than 5 hours. To 100% it probably will takes about 8 hours. Considering this game is 20 bucks, that is just too steep for the amount of content. There is a fair amount of customization for you character, but nothing unheard of. Another problem I have in this game is the story. The jyst of the story is some boxes have gone rogue and you're sent in to destroy them and fix everything more or less. When I do missions, I don't feel like I'm accomplishing anything though, I don't really feel like I'm progressing the story. Most of the missions don't have to do with the story at all, they are literally just to collect stamps. Even when you beat a boss, it doesn't feel like I've toppled anything or saved the island. The story isn't the main draw to this game to be fair, this game is far more about the platforming, but I would have liked to see a little more to it.

Overall this is a pretty game, with some decent platforming and gameplay, but it lacking in the content department. I don't think this game is bad by any means, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this game. Definitely one that you should pick up on sale or if you see it in a bundle. I give this game a 63 out of 100.

The challenges themselves sometimes got a little repetitive, but like many of the games this is clearly an homage to, it's the world, level design, story, and dialogue that kept me playing. 

Especially the world design, which really is top notch. A lot of care was clearly put into making interesting paths that loop around and cross over one another like spaghetti, which makes the more open hub worlds actually work instead of needing more linear levels like a lot of collect-em-ups do. I kept finding new paths and things to grab in areas I thought I had already cleared whenever I approached them from a new angle, and that can't be easy to pull off from a design standpoint.

Between that and the clever bits of dialogue and gameplay references, this comes off almost as charming as the platforming giants it's giving the wink and nod to.

You play as Newbie, a sentient delivery box working for GPS (Global Postal Service). You jump and roll your way through three open maps (+ hub world) and collect as many stamps and other collectibles as possible.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
Unbox looks nice and colorful. The models are fairly simple but still look decent enough.

On a technical level the game is not quite as impressive. Some areas (especially large indoor sections) suffer from slowdowns and the rather extreme LOD popping is often distracting, particularly during cutscenes.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The sound effects are decent enough. I wasn't a big fan of the music or the ""voice acting"", however. The music is ok but extremely repetitive. Like in many classic platformers there is no real voice acting, just gibberish voices. Unfortunately, in Unbox many of the character voices are extremely annoying.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay-wise Unbox is a very traditional platformer with some extremely simple combat. The only real innovation is the ability to unbox. Unboxing let's you jump again in mid-air and you can do this as long as you have health points left. In practice this makes you extremely mobile as health refills are easy to come by.

The levels themselves are pretty open and you can move around them quite freely. The main goal in each level is to collect stamps. These can be won through various challenges (races, puzzles, fights etc.) or found hidden in the scenery. While the maps themselves are reasonably well-designed, many of these challenges aren't particularly fun or interesting.

In addition to the stamps, each level has a huge amount of other collectibles, but these are purely optional and don't seem to provide any in-game benefit. At the end of each level there's also a simple bossfight.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
Overall Unbox is a rather easy and casual game once you learn the controls. However, the difficulty of the challenges is all over the place and some of them can be fairly challenging.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
On a gamepad the controls were passable but not great. You control a box so understandably your movement is bit awkward. The controls aren't very precise either but at least you have the ability to unbox which is usually enough to recover from mistakes.

The vehicle controls on the other hand are truly atrocious and the vehicle physics are terrible. Luckily there are only a few sections in the game where you actually have to use the vehicles.

[h1]Story and Writing[/h1]
The story and writing are both very poor. I don't except a great story in a platformer, but the story in Unbox is particularly bad. The characters are all extremely uninspired and the constant bad jokes and pop culture references get old fast.

[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]
The game is reasonably polished. I did have one crash while restarting a challenge and the physics can be rather wonky at times.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
Personally I feel that Unbox is a rather poor imitation of the classic platformers. The controls are awkward, the story is rubbish and the gameplay isn't particularly good either. I wouldn't recommend the game unless you have already played the aforementioned classics to death.

I played through the main campaign but didn't bother collecting all the stamps or golden tapes. This took me around 6 hours.",1495393840,1495394137,False,18,0,0.594501256942749023,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Pros:

- Cute, clean and colourful graphics
- Real throwback to the 90s
- Large worlds to explore
- Lots of collectables
- Varied content between puzzles, exploration, platforming and challenges/mini-games
- Fairly easy and casual experience


Cons:

- Rolling and jumping mechanics can be clumsy and hard to direct
- No real story or purpose to what you're doing (goes with the genre though)


Full Length Review: 

After having an itch for a 90s platformer rear its head in recent months, and after being put off Yooka-Laylee because of its price and length, I saw Unbox on a bundle site sale at what worked out to be about ¬£2. So I took a gamble.

My initial impression was of the voice acting. Garbled talk just as in YL and Banjo Kazooie in the old days. I had to chuckle given this was my YL replacement. I did the quick tutorial and then worked on the first world.

The game has 3 distinct worlds plus a central hub world. Each world have various collectables to gather in order to progress to the next one, and eventually 100% the game if you wish. I am currently at the end of the first world and have found most of the hub world's collectables after about 5 hours of playing. Each world has a varied aesthetic and is pretty large - far bigger than I'd have expected.

The mechanics do grate on me after a while, with it being difficult to direct the rolling and jumping aspects. I like that you can double jump, up to a maximum of 6 times before having to refill health (basically a charge mechanic). Health boxes are plentiful and checkpoints are everywhere, which also fill health to max. Basically the 6 charge is your limit to attempt a particular jump or to land somewhere.

In terms of content; you have your exploration with 'golden tape' to collect. 200 in each world. Then you have mystery diary entries to find; about 5 in each world from what I can tell. Finally, you have 'Stamps' which are awarded by solving puzzles or completing challenges - little ""race"" types where you have to deliver a letter across the island in 5 minutes or fight 20 enemy boxes in 2 minutes etc. Unlock enough of these Stamps and you can fight the world's boss and progress to the next world.",1493833835,1493841119,True,33,1,0.76002037525177002,3,False,False,False,False,,,

- vehicles physics is really painful (for instance, if you barely scratch a wall, the car will stop as if it hit a 100 tons block of concrete), racing with those is horrible, with the ridiculously short timers making it even more painful. Thankfully, you don't have to use them much so it's not too bad
- mouse sensitivity is too low, even when set to the max, so the camera is a bit of a PITA

[i] Unbox	[/i] fa parte di quella stretta categoria di giochi scoperti ""per caso"", e in questo caso il ""per caso"" (troppi caso, proprio a caso...) √® rappresentato dal buon Sputafuoco, che mi ha fatto scoprire questa piccola perla grazie ad un bundle assai economico. 
Non posso non valutarlo positivamente, e mi rattrista il fatto che un titolo cos√¨ divertente e scanzonato sia passato cos√¨ in sordina, eccetto per qualche testata non proprio conosciuta che ci ha buttato giu un due righe a riguardo: con uno score di 68% su Metacritic (ben pi√π alto per quanto riguarda l'opinione del pubblico), [i] Unbox	[/i] √® un classicissimo platform 3D nel quale ci muoveremo all'interno di enormi livelli pieni zeppi di sfide e collezionabili da raccogliere. Tutto regolare fino a qui. La trovata simpatica sta nell'impersonare una scatola  che dovr√† sconfiggere il classico cattivone a capo della classica banda di sgherri cattivoni chiamati ""Wild Cards"". Il gameplay √® ridotto all'osso, non avremo movenze particolari o mosse sbloccabili durante il corso dell'avventura, e dovremo accontentarci del classico tasto per saltare e di una feature complementare ad esso, ossia il tasto dell'unboxing. Premendo LB (prendo come riferimento il pad della Xbox One) infatti potremo spiccare un'ulteriore salto, balzando fuori a mo' di matrioska dalla precedente scatola per spiccare un salto pi√π alto, e di fila al massimo sei: questo tasto sar√† fondamentale per poter raggiungere zone altrimenti inacessibili con la semplice pressione del salto normale. Oltretutto, con il tasto B, ci potremo schiantare atterra per compiere azioni contestuali o per stunnare i nemici. Tutto qua. Ma non √® un ""tutto qua"" polemico, questo gameplay ridotto all'essenziale √® estremamente divertente, e sopratutto non stanca troppo a causa della longevit√† non troppo elevata, che si attesta pi√π o meno sulle 6-7 ore di gioco. I collezionabili poi non mancheranno, come non mancheranno le customizzazioni della nostra scatoletta, e dalle sopracitate 6 o 7 ore di gioco si arriver√† a pi√π di 10 se vorrete completare il gioco al 100%!

As a gamer, I think it's an idiotic sandbox that isn't that fun. As a parent, I don't want my kid playing it, but I don't want to be ""that dad"" who blocks my kid from playing a game without offering a substitute. I can't tell you how happy I was when I found Unbox. Unbox is a kid-friendly version of Goat Simulator, while being interesting enough for me to join in and play a few multiplayer rounds with him.

Controls can be difficult to get used to since, well, you're a box and the physics for walking as a box are pretty spot-on. It's a challenge, but a nice challenge. Graphics are really nice for an indie studio, everything felt really smooth. Quests are  simple for the most part, and the tutorial is great to get you acquainted. My only gripe was the really weird initial controls, but you can remap them if you want. Level design actually had a Super Mario Sunshine feel to it, to me it felt like a Saturday morning as a kid.

I believe this game is much more suited for parents who are introducing their kids to Steam gaming and are looking to find a family-friendly title in the mix, and it does it's job well.",1491228955,1491228955,True,6,0,0.465493530035018921,0,False,False,False,False,,,

If you grew up on Rareware games and similar 3D platformers like I did and are looking to relive some of that sweet sweet nostalgia, no need to keep reading, this game will absolutely scratch that itch. If you're still skeptical however, read on, because there are a few quirks to Unbox that may make or break your overall enjoyment of the game.

The first thing that I would like to point out, is that, despite the fact that Unbox successfully capitalizes on N64 and early Playstation platformer nostalgia better than any game since... Well probably Psychonauts... It still feels like a new-generation game. The game environments have more in common with the likes of Far Cry and Uncharted than they do with Banjo Kazooie for example, and although the level design is still highly detailed and very good overall, there is an element of realism to the game enviroments that is not shared by the games that Unbox has been frequently compared to. There are pros and cons to this increased world size and realism, one major pro being that the game is a satisfying length and feels full of content even though the story only takes you to three different locations. The drawbacks are most notably that the stamps needed to progress through the story can be hard to find, environments aren't varied enough and ultimately will end up being boring after spending some time in each, and platforming is a little quirky even beyond the obvious caveat that you play as a box and, as such, control like a box.

That said, one of the biggest strengths of the game for me was the actual controlling of the box. A lot of people have pointed this out as a con, but to me it actually adds a nice challenge to the experience. None of the platforming is particularly difficult, and when it is harder than normal checkpoints are placed very generously, so the bulk of the challenge comes from how the rolling box actually handles. I found the controlling of the box to be satisfying and realistic even though some players might find it clunky. The movement is held back a little bit by an unorthodox control system (at least with an Xbox controller which I personally used for the whole game), but given that there is only about 4 different functions, the control scheme will very quickly become familiar to you, even if it isn't perfect.

This brings me to, in my opinion, the biggest shortcoming of Unbox, the ""minigames"". I call them that because I don't know what else to compare it to in other similar games. Basically the story is progressed by collecting stamps, anybody who played Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie will be familiar with this as they are functionally the same as Stars or Jiggys in those games (respectively). However, despite them serving the same function in progressing the story as more are collected, the way these are actually collected is different. In each of the three worlds, recurring characters will give you ""missions"" which are essentially just minigames. These can be fun at first but the real downfall of these minigames is that they are effectively exactly the same on all of the three worlds you travel to. You eventually come to expect exactly what each character will ask of you. There are some outliers but for the most part these become quite the grind. They are also not particularly difficult in and of themselves and the difficulty instead is creating by imposing an arbitrary time limit on almost all of these excursions. One of the worst offenders is a racing minigame in which the player is tasked with just getting from point A to point B in a certain time frame, sometimes these races include cars as well which just seems like a clunky and unnecessary addition to the game, and the game would've been significantly better without the inclusion of this mechanic. Some stamps can still be collected by just stumbling upon them or solving puzzles like you would in Mario 64 or most Rare games, and these are definitely the highlights of this stamp collecting aspect of the game, but that said, these stamps tend to be last resorts as there is no way to find them in the giant worldspaces other than stumbling upon them, whereas instead you can be directed to the minigame options with a giant arrow.

Overall, despite these flaws, my opinion of Unbox is that it is definitely worth it if you're looking for a potent dose of nostalgia with some modern flair and mechanics. This blend of new and old works more often than it doesn't, and the game succeeds through vibrant worldspaces, unique platforming and movement, and entertaining characters, even if it is brought down a little bit by it's core stamp collection mechanic. I got this game for $10 in the Humble Bundle and definitely think that is a fair price, so keep a lookout for it on sale.",1483040288,1483040431,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It's got the graphics, the level design, the game structure, the writing, the atmosphere. The game is well balenced with a good difficulty and a decent amount of content.

But the game has you controlling a box. Rolling a box around is the least satisfying movement mechanic I think I've ever experienced in a 3D game. The camera bobs constantly as the corners of the box flip, and the physics are fully fleshed out in that concept. This all gives me a huge headache - the camera bouncing looks terrible, and the boxes are very difficult to control. The ""jumping"" is more of a ""throwing yourself into things"" in the vein of joke 3D platformers like Goat Simulator, and it wasn't satisfying to control there and it's not fun here.

If the developers ever make a mode where the boxes have legs and it controls closer to your usual 3D game, I'd happily recommend the game again.",1482944419,1482944419,False,9,0,0.514167070388793945,3,False,False,False,False,,,

If you love platformers, love quirky games then this is a must!   


You play as a box and your job is to save the company which is called GPS. Like all platformers of yesteryear you do this by exploring the world, collecting things, doing challenges and finding secrets. As this is a game about boxes the main things you will collect is cellotape and stamps. Collecting 200 cellotapesin in each world gives you new clothing for your box and collecting stamps lets you fight bosses and progress. In each level you can also rescue boxes that are trappped in for extra stamps. The wolrds look beautiful and well detailed with lots going in and teh humour is fantastic. 

I've only couple of hours so far but I haven't come across any problems and really don't have anything negative to say.

The cute visuals and music help get across what kind of game this is going to be. From talking to the diffrent boxes, finding collectibles, to exploring the diffrent worlds, this games is one I can play and immideatly have a nice day. But is it fully worth it?
PROS
- The worlds are massive. I found myself exploring each world for hours in hopes of finding new secrets. The detail in them is incredible, and they immideatly get the theme across.
-The music, while simplistic, is nice. It reminds me a lot of the 3d Mario games. Each song is fitting for each of the worlds. Altough for some it can be a little repititve. 
- Each character has a unique personality that let you know rightoff the bat what kind of box they are. Wheter they are a jolly happy box, a worker box, or a possible homicidal bunny box, each of them has something that makes you like them
- All of the challenges ar simple and fun. None of them felt unfair, and I looked foorward to seeing what the next would bring to the table. From time trails, to exploring the maps for collectibles, each challenge requires you change playstyle in some way shape or form.

CONS
- The physics in this game, while functional, have a tendency of being a little messy. I found myself getting stuck a few times, and even had to restart a challenge or two due to some weird physics glitch.
- While I was not expecting Metal Gear levels of storytelling in a game like this, the game could have been even better with more bits of story. This become evident towards the end where everythig just becomes rushed because they needed a reason for boss battles.
- While I love collect-athon games, this is one of the weaker ones. Outside of a few cosmetic unlocakables, there is no real reason I found for collecting all of the tape and stamps outside of getting 100%.
- The combat in this games is just very clunky. It ranges from being simplistic to frutrating. You will go from slamming enemies, to doggin missles that range from being slightly annoying, to instant kills. This is especially proven in the final boss fight, where I found myself getting 1 hit KO like 20 times.
-Lastly, the game almost feels too short. With only three worlds and a hub world, the game almost feels incomplete in some way. I feel that the game would have benfited from having an addotional two worlds to make the journey feel satisfying.

While these cons may seem frustrating, I still had fun with the game, and look forward to whatever the developers have next in store. If a sequel were to be made and fix some if the issues this first one had, I feel we will have a good tribute to the old N64 collector games.

Der Preis ist in jedem Fall angemessen und man hat viel Spa√ü damit. Es ist zwar Stellenweise sehr kindlich angehaucht und versucht stellenweise Zwanghaft witzig zu sein, aber dennoch hat man einiges an Spa√ü. Es ist kein Riesenspiel aber f√ºr den Spa√üfaktor auf jedenfall zu empfehlen. Im gro√üen und ganzen ein echt gutes Spiel. 
Bugs gab es nur sehr wenige und bis auf 2 haben mich davon auch keine gest√∂rt. Die beiden die ich als nerven empfunden habe, waren dass oft wenn ich in einer Mission eine andere Box an mich gebunden hatte, das meine Figur nicht mehr richtig gesprungen ist weil der andere Teil irgendwo h√§ngen geblieben war. Der andere Bug war in einer der Speedmissionen, wo der Wagen nicht gespawnt wurde oder manchmal der Respawn, genau da gesetzt wurde wo ich die Klippe runter gefallen bin. Aber beides nichts Weltbewegendes. Und ein Tipp, in der 2. Welt (Schnee) bei dem einen Rennen kann es passieren, dass wenn man zu schnell ist, das der Checkpoint nicht aktiviert wird (wo man durch eine ""Box"" springen muss).
Die Steuerung ist mit Tastatur und Maus extremst nervt√∂tent und nicht zu empfehlen da sie zu empfindlich ist und man keinen Sprung schafft und auch sonst viele Probleme hat. (Da die Hauptfigur eine Box ist, rollt sie auch wie eine was oft sehr frustrierend war).
Mit Kontroller hingegen ist es angenehm. Nicht perfekt aber gut genug um Spa√ü zu haben. Es gibt viele Eastereggs und viel Spa√ü in dem Spiel. Viele der Nebencharakt√§re blieben mir auch im Ged√§chtnis, da sie einfach so total bescheuert waren oder irgendwie besonders waren. Stellenweise kam auch das alte Super Mario N64 feeling auf. Nat√ºrlich ist es nicht zu vergleichen, aber dennoch √§hnlich. 
Frustrierende bzw. schwere Ecken gab es nicht viele, es war die meiste Zeit relativ einfach bzw. fair(mal von der Steuerung abgesehen) . Die einzige Mission wo ich mein Gamepad am liebsten gegen die Wand geworfen h√§tte war eine Mission auf der letzten Karte und eine andere auf der 1. Aber ich m√∂chte euch nicht spoilern. Grafisch hab ich nicht viel auszusetzen, es hat seinen eigenen Flair und hat Ihn gut durchgehalten. 
Ansonsten sind einige der freizuschaltenden Kost√ºme echt lustig und es ist am√ºsant was man mit seiner Kiste alles machen kann.
F√ºr Archievementj√§ger kann ich das Spiel auch empfehlen, ich habe viel Zeit vertr√∂delt und auch √∂fter einfach mal nur Dialoge gelesen, hab es aber 100% durch und es gab auch keine Archievements wo man ewig lange Spielen m√ºsste bzw. extrem schwere/hirntote Aufgaben erledigen muss. Auch gibt es keine Verpassbaren Archievements. (Ein Tipp: Die kleine Rote Kiste die wir im Tutorial kennen lernen, ist in jedem Missionsgebiet zu finden. Wenn am Ende noch Rollen oder Puzzleteile fehlen, sprecht Ihn an und er wird euch ein Bild von dem Platz zeigen wo diese sind. (Mehrmals anreden ist auch m√∂glich um das Bild aus verschiedenen Winkeln zu sehen)).
Die Story war nicht sonderlich tiefgr√ºndig, aber es ging ja eh in erster Linie nur um den Spa√ü und in dem Spiel steckt viel Liebe f√ºrs Detail. Aus diesem Grund kann ich es klar empfehlen.
Ich muss jedoch zugeben das ich den Multiplayermodus noch nicht ausprobiert habe und bisher auch nichts positives dr√ºber geh√∂rt habe. Hierf√ºr lest am besten eine andere Review.

TL:DR - Das Spiel macht Spa√ü, ist fesselnd, viel liebe f√ºrs Detail und auch einige Eastereggs (z.B. kann man auf der 3. Insel ein Bonfire aus Dark Souls finden) zu finden. Die Archievements sind alle relativ leicht und machbar. Aber wer ein schweres Spiel sucht und kein Gamepad hat bzw. viel Geduld f√ºr die Tastatursteuerung mit bringt sollte die Finger von dem Spiel lassen. Der Preis ist angemessen und wer wollte denn noch nicht ein sich selbst auslieferndes P√§ckchen sein. :)

I would completely recommend this game, but only if you have friends to play it with. The story mode is okay, but the real fun is the multiplayer.

-Quirky 'box' characters
-Heavily inspired by late 90's platformers with regards to gameplay and worlds
-Plenty of collectibles and costumes in game to try on
-Active Publisher/Developer that still constantly reachable online and releasing free updates 
-Charming humour (may make you groan or cringe but guaranteed to make you react) 
-Variety in quests, boss battles, and world design
-Hidden Eastern eggs and nods to other games/pop culture moments 
-Sound effects and music that keep the atmosphere alive with energy
-Multiplayer included! 

Cons: 
-No built-in steam shop support (not even for custom costumes)
-Game under 10 hours of gameplay unless going for 100% completion (currently at $17.99 steam at time of writing)
-Controls are frustrating (as to be expected by controlling a box, not a sphere) 
-Camera-work equally frustrating, especially when giving you 'hints' from Bounce
-Load times inbetween game start-up and world loading screens strangely long
-Lack of actual game walkthroughs/tips online to help if trying for true 100% collection goals 
-Tutorials/Help Tips can seem never-ending at times, as what at first will feel helpful and guiding through confusing parts (especially the initial tutorial) can devolve into repetitive information, especially when asking for locations of certain items or challenges

Overall it may seem like a game that can leave mixed impressions and I won't deny that it certainly will try your patience at certain times. However the game is built that way because it motivates you to go 100% collecting all the way if that's your cup of tea. Otherwise it doesn't mind if you focus instead on just the main story and that by itself is worth the game. Also much of the gripes I listed in cons you either get used to or are acceptable when viewed overall at a game that does a lot of things right and if you like a challenge with regards to modern platforming, is right up your alley than.

It thinks so highly of what they do and tries so hard to emulate them, and it's cute but ends up falling short because of a fundamental lack of understanding.

Right out of the gate the game holds you on a leash through a forced tutorial for just long enough to be aggravating, while dangling pickups here and there in your face but saying ""oh no, little Billy, you can't get those just yet!"" if you attempt to stray so much as 2 feet off the trodden path. Then, by the end of the tutorial, you are familiarized with your titular Unbox ability which allows you to take as many as 7 consecutive jumps at the cost of your health meter. It is how you will mobilize yourself through the rest of the game, scrounging for the obligatory collectibles and completing (re)quests in the form of instanced minigames. You can also stomp with B to hit buttons or defend yourself.

This never changes. This is the entire game.

It controls awkwardly, because of a semi-accurately simulated ""rolling box"" physics model for your movement, and jumping, unboxing, and pounding are mapped to RB, LB, and B respectively. The cast of characters is flat and insipid, with probably 90% of the population being literal clones of the oblivious, happy-go-lucky, incompetent, bad-pun-spewing stooge by name of Zippie and the remaining 10% being pretty much the same one-note caricature besides. Both the hub world and the first main level you go to have very similar, very repetitive caribbean-themed music with two-chord backing tracks and I never want to hear another steel drum in my life. The graphics are nice! I like how everything looks. But even all this aside, the game's primary stumbling block is that there's a blatantly straightforward and yet completely squandered opportunity for a good sense of progression.

Stamps are foisted as the most important pickup because they apparently unlock new worlds, so they got that much right (although I seem to have access to at least 3 worlds from the start anyway). There are occasionally special fragments tucked away in really well-hidden places that are kind of fun to dig for. But simultaneously the most prominent and pointless pickup is golden tape; it is the bananas / musical notes of Unbox, with a whopping [i]200[/i] to collect on every single level, and yet it serves [i]no point whatsoever[/i]. Perhaps it unlocks an extra cosmetic or something, but if the developers were riding on cosmetics as a main driving force of the gameplay then I'm not sure who they were making this for.

You start the first world with all of your abilities. You don't unlock extra jumps. You don't unlock rounded edges to make movement easier. The only things you unlock in this game are cosmetics and doors. There [i]could have been[/i] a much more intriguing system in place here, perhaps requiring you to gradually unlock progressive extra jumps per level, meaning you'd have to make do with the lower areas at first or come up with cheesy ways of exploiting physics to sequence break. Maybe your progress in the separate worlds would dictate how much of the hub world you could access. But when everything's set in stone from the start, the entire point of the collectathon genre has swooped by overhead. It's like if you started Saints Row 4 with all your upgrades and superpowers at their full cap; yeah, you [i]could[/i] go around and collect hundreds of glowy pickups, but why would you want to?",1477920172,1477920172,False,10,0,0.493924438953399658,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Chasing collectibles for 100% is frustrating at best when you `just barely miss` because of the cube movement.

The physics are far superior to anything that could have been offered in the late 90's, as are the graphics (but without seeming too flashy). They retain the cartoon, polygon appearance we all love, and the spirit of those games is upheld even in the characters ""speaking""

I only really have one complaint about this game, and it pains me to admit it, but it has made me start to lose interest just a tad. In the 3D platformers (actually all platformers, back to the NES), there were lots of short levels where you could feel a sense of accomplishment, many times, over a few hours. This game doesn't really do that for me.

I enjoy open-world games as much as anyone else, but in many other successful games there's still incremental payoffs that occur fairly frequently ie. deeply interesting story and accomplishments or brief challenges with frequent minor rewards along the way. I did not get that with this game.

I would play another game in this style, from the same dev's, again for sure. But I would really hope for twice the levels/worlds and 2/3's the collectibles per level. At that point it would be absolutely equal to Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64, or all the other fantastic games this emulates. Hands down.

https://youtu.be/LdmNT1Y9HOA
Unbox is a throwback to 90s platformers with obvious inspiration being taken from games such as Glover, Conker and Banjo and Kazooie on the Nintendo 64. 

You play as Newbie, a box. I take it you understand the title of the game now.

Newbie was created by the Global Postal Service, GPS for short, with the sole aim of saving the floundering company. Newbie was created not only is a sentient  box, but also a self-delivering box, which would not only save the company money, but save it from bankruptcy.

Controls:
Well, you're a box, you move how a box would, turning is delicate, the controls can be quite jagged and can be at times, tough to control. I found that when I was moving faster I was definitely struggling more, but if you pace your movement and try to aim your jumps and movement it becomes more fluid.

There are a number of moves which Newbie has in his arsenal including slam, unbox, and jump.

While movement is tough at the start, it gets easier the more you play it, don't let the initial frustration throw you and spoil the experience for you. 

Soundtrack:
The game sounds like Banjo and Kazooie, the NPCs all respond with similar meeps and merps, as well as having similar interactions with the player. These small details help the player to embrace the world and the retro vision the developers had. Either that or they were too cheap to pay for voice actors, or they weren't sure what a box would sound like.

The soundtrack is alright, a bit repetitive at times, but it fits each world well. If you're a collection enthusiast it could definitely grate on you, and considering the game is somewhat of a collectathon I could definitely see that happening to some players.

In Conclusion:
Unbox is a very fun game which is suitable for a lot of people, of many ages, it has an expansive and colorful environment and quality gameplay to boot, while being not too difficult, it's also not too easy and definitely has replay value. Would I recommend it? Definitely.",1477432958,1477432958,True,0,1,0.432707607746124268,0,False,False,False,False,,,

In Unbox you control a box(duh), that can move, jump and unbox(essentially a extra jump). You have to collect a certain ammount of items in the levels to proceed to the boss fight and then to the next level.

Which levels is quite big and detailed world, being almost a open-world-lite per level. You have several quests and activities, like rescuing other boxes,  races, challenges, and even combat against the ""bad boxes"" It offers good variety if you just want to progress, although it might get a bit too saturated if you aim for 100% every level (but then again that's true for most of the games in the genre)

Made in Unreal Engine 4, it does look pretty good, even more so coupled with the charming artstyle. The worlds are full of detail and are consistent throughout. It's very pleasing to the eye. The worlds are also pretty different from one another which keeps the experience fresh (a oil rig, a tropical island, snow mountains and a jungle with ancient ruins).

Soundwise, it's quite good. There's lot of sound effects and details that help the world come alive, and the banter from NPCs is reminiscent of stuff like Banjo and others. The soundtrack is alright and it fits each world well, but it is a bit flawed in there's little variety in it and each theme can be repetitive in itself, so while well composed those themes might be grating while trying to 100% a level.

As for controls: it handles exactly how you'd think a box would handle. As it is a box and it has corners, you will get the expected behaviour from it which will make it a bit erratic compared to what you would expect from other games with characters that have a more ""smooth"" appearance and gameplay. It takes a little bit to adjust(20-30 minutes), but when it does, it becomes natural and it handles quite well. The unbox mechanics, which consists in essentially adding a extra jump(up to 6 max). It makes it a game very fun to speedrun, coupled with the momentum physics that can make you go roll at very high speeds. I was worried it would trivialize the game too much, but after playing it for a quite a bit I don't think it does. Making big skips and jumps still requires skill and for you to have proper control of the character.

The boss sections aren't bad, but they might be too simple for their own good. It doesn't feel like you take full of advantage of what you learned from the levels and that's a shame. It would be really good if they added more platforming on those sections.

But it's not the genre that we really miss.  It's that wonderful personality that those games had.  That goofy sense of humor, that hilarious cartoon approach to characters that made us feel like we'd jumped into a saturday morning cartoon.  That's what Unbox nails.

If, like me, you grew up playing classic 90's platformers such as Spyro the Dragon and Banjo Kazooie, Unbox is the game for you. Placing you in the role of a sentient cardboard box (because, why not) Unbox lets you fling yourself freely around several large environments, tasking you with collecting a variety of objects in order to progress to the next level. It looks great, it controls great, it's just great in general. Unbox. It's worth both your time and hard earned cash.

I love the box rolling mechanic, I think it's incredibly fun.
Here are a couple of the main reasons why I don't reccomend this game despite the game's charm and appeal.

First, right off the bat, the game has long unskipable cutscenes which wouldnt be a problem if it's not for what comes next in the list.

Second, the map design in the game is great and a lot of fun. The problem is there is this mechanic in the game called UNBOX which essentially uses a life to launch you great distances. which ends up turning this map that, at the start of the game seemed overwhelmingly large. To a much smaller map due to your increase in speed and mobility. It turned all the obstacles into non-problems. This was killer for me. and what made it worse was:

Third: You unlock all your abilities at the start of the game. This is what turned me off of the game. This game has a lot of potential without the UNBOX abliity The tutorial levels where you can't use it are really fun. They should have waited till later in the game to give it to you. You can really see the developers struggle to make interesting missions with this ability simply due to how overpowered it is.

Fourth: The missions in this game struggle to keep the game interesting. I hate to say it, but they really do. This is for a couple reasons. One, the story itself can't really figure out it's main purpose so they really just drop you in and say ""have fun"" with no real reason why you need to do these missions. Plus most of the missions are completely inconsistent in difficulty and time to complete. This game has collectables similar to banjo-kazooie as you are probably aware. But the main ""stamp"" collectable is what gets you essentially to the next level. But one mission can take you less then a minute to complete saying ""go here"". And others that are whole races which you need to get 3 gold metals to get one stamp. I think this just goes back to the developers trying to accomadate for the UNBOX launch.

Fifth and Finally: The story. The reason this is last is because in these collectathon games story is ususally of minimal importance. BUT! This story is particularly confusing. Lets get some of the minor gripes right off the bat. Other characters have somewhat inconsistant personalities but tend to stay true to their ""Archetype"". The major problem I have with the story is the fact that the developers never actually figured out a driving force. You start the game as ""The box that will save the shipping company"" which is a fantastic premise. Then they go on to the first main ""open world"" island. And tell you ""oh forget about it, go and have fun doing our missions"". It just never feels like you are making any progress despite beating the boss, and going through levels.

tl;dr
Game has fun mechanics and a fun story and interesting level design, but is dwarfed by game breaking powerups that should have been locked till the end of the game, a story which loses purpose within the first 20 minutes of playing, and challenges which fail to remain interesting for long periods of play.

The developers show a lot of potential in this game, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next.  Given a chance to learn from their mistakes with this game. Hopefully the next one is fantastic.

     First off, I'd like to say that I saw this announced a while back and have been pretty stoked about it since. However, I was kind of disappointed when I finally got my hands on it a couple days ago. Furthermore, I only have two hours on record so there may be some later content that I did not access and therefore cannot know that it might relate to the things that I am going to write about below. Also, I guess I'll add a TL;DR at the bottom.

____________________________________________________________

[h1] Collectibles [/h1]

     For the first half-hour or so, I found myself lost in the game's charm. It was fun rolling around as a little mustachio'd box with all my other sentient box friends but it grew kind of dull after a while.
     After the tutorial was over, I went on to just start collecting things because that's what you do in this kind of game. Just to explain this a little further there are three different kinds of collectibles: Gold Tape (the plentiful, 'coin-style' one), Trapped Zippies (the bonus 'free your friends!' one), and Stamps (the main 'star-type' one). Those three things are what you'll find around the world of 'Unbox.' Now, here is what I think could be improved on:

     I feel like there should be maybe one or two more types of collectibles. Having two hundred rolls of Gold Tape strewn about each world comes off as a little lazy, especially considering these are the types of items that tend to be collected while on the way from one objective to another. While there are plenty on the roads and paths, a lot of them are also quite hidden so the player must search high and low for them all which, normally, wouldn't be so bad but there are just way too many. I think changing the amount from two hundred to one hundred and then adding a new collectible would be a better option.

[h1] Difficulty and General Gameplay [/h1]

     Next, I'd like to talk about the difficulty and other things related. The game feels far too easy and I understand it's supposed to be a casual collect-a-thon (and that's okay, I love games like that) but 'Unbox' lacks something that keeps me engaged. I breezed through whatever challenges were in my way and the only difficulties I had were from the wonkiness of trying to roll around as a cube-shaped object. While I understand that is the point of the game, I'd like to say that it's too much here. A game can be wonky and still feel right to the player (think Katamari here or even Starwhal if you've ever played it) but this game does not do that for me. Instead, I would find myself frustrated that I failed missions or missed an item due to a messed up jump because my box was laying at an awkward angle or something like that. I think the gameplay would greatly benefit from something that could add a level of fluidity or smoothness such as slightly rounded collisions or much less rough terrain. In short, the only challenging part of this game is its handling and not in a fun way.

[h1] Writing, Story, and Development [/h1]

     Continuing on, I'd like to mention the less important aspects of the game such as writing and whatnot. I say, ""less important"" because I know that these things weren't the developers' primary focus here, but since this is a review, they're worth mentioning.

     To put it bluntly, the story is not good (spoilers ahead). It's like this: GPS (Global Postal Service) is going out of business because they can't stop losing people's stuff. As a last ditch effort, they started manufacturing sentient, self-delivering boxes. However, this didn't entirely work and they were still in trouble. So, as a last-last ditch effort, they designed a totally new and improved box that was supposed to be much better than all the others (that box is the player). Then everyone keeps saying that you're the only one who can save GPS and that's pretty much it. ...or is it?

     Almost immediately, a good 'ol 'mystery character with an ambiguous moral alignment' arc is thrown in. There is no build-up, there is no point, there is only 'Mystery Box.' He also very quickly reveals that the G in GPS doesn't stand for 'Global,' but in fact 'Galactic' so this also has something to do with aliens and/or space or something. It just feels like the developers didn't really know what they wanted to do with their own game. Also, they do this thing when you continue your game or travel to a different world that automatically tries to replay the most recent story-related cutscene and I don't like or understand that at all.

     That being said, I do really like the world that 'Unbox' is set in. The idea of sentient delivery boxes that just want to bring things to people is cute and fun. There's also 'Mop,' a box that used to deliver mops until marketing research decided that wasn't really selling. He's sad and that makes me sad because all he wants to do is deliver mops. But anyway, the game is beautiful, the environments are great, and I really love the concept. I just really don't love the writing. In addition to that, the villains, otherwise known as the 'Wild Cards,' are super annoying. I don't mean they're annoying as characters, they're annoying in-game. The player will occassionally come across these guys whilst in the middle of going somewhere or doing something and they don't add anything to the gameplay at all. They just knock you around and they're a nuisance. But I guess that belongs in the gameplay section? I'm too lazy to move it and it's a kind of acceptable segue into the fact that I also hate Bounce. This character is also incredibly annoying because he/she/it never stops giving me useless hints from the tutorial. Please add a 'Turn off Bounce' option for everyone else to enjoy.

[h1] Bugs [/h1]

     Finally, I'd like to address bugs. At the time of this review, 'Unbox' is at v1.02 and still contains a number of bugs. This is pretty okay due to the game being brand new, but it's a necessary thing to mention in a review.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

     To conclude, 'Unbox' is a fun game in its own right. However, it falls short of what one might consider to be a polished game and its only saving grace is the creativity of the concept and world. There are just too many smaller issues to ignore, which is why I cannot recommend this to others.

This just takes you back to playing games like Spyro, Gek, TY, and Croc.

You jump around massive game levels as a box who can Unbox, into a smaller box, and doing so will give you a ""double jump"" which you can do up to 6 times. While it can be sometimes awkward as a box to roll around, the platforming controls in the game are extremely tight and well thought out. It's a pleasure to play.

I've seen 3 of the games levels which are huge, and they all look beautiful. I highly recommend if you're not sure about the game to at least play through to the 2nd level, not including the hub, as moving around in that level is such a blast as you slide along in the ice.

A small complaint if I had one was about the music in the game (at least on the 1st main level) almost driving me insane. The second levels music sounds a lot less prominent and therefore less annoying though.

Fun little game that didn't really do anything that hasn't been done before but does what it needed to right.

Pros:
Large open world, no invisible walls
World is flavorful, not lifeless. Most open worlds are just hills and trees and roads with points of interests here and there. In Unbox everything and everwhere feels designed, no filler
Movement is simple and unirritating, the devs give you a sextuple jump so you can go where you want to go no hassle
Every collectable you failed to find? There's an NPC that will show you where it is so you have a chance of finding it in this huge environment

Cons:
Story? Meh.
Dialogue? Meh.
Music? Meh.

There's a lot to see in Unbox, and you don't need to collect everything. But if you don't want to do that then there's nothing really else for you.

I'mma write some things that really sticked out.

- The Unbox Ability feels like it was added on a whim, the map is even build to be able to 
  traverse without it, honestly would've been more fun If you unlocked it at the end of the 
  game.There's also a vehicle license in the world but we ""somehow"" have it already 
  unlocked. also would've been fun if we unlocked it after the 1st boss fight.

- The Golden Tape is annoying to get at times, they should've enabled the sound it makes 
  before you've collected over a 100 (I think). Then it would've been easier to find and you 
  wouldn't need to look around aimlessly to hear a sound, or ask Bounce for a tip. (Also 
  stamps and Golden tapes make the same sound.)

- Missions repeat with different characters, could've been more diverse, honestly there 
  should've been more Characters in general as well, probably just some minor that appear 
  only in 1 world.

- There isn't a forklift centered mission.

- Bugs that I encountered that ""apparently"" haven't been fixed since launch: 
By going into the box the only ""puzzle"" stamp is located in your game freezes permanently (Alt+ F4).
If you ride the sled and somehow flip yourself backwards while sliding, the game should crash.
 
+ But something that I have to award is that the ice pathing in Parcel Peaks is incredibly fun 
   to use, so are the cars.

I'd say it's worth half the original price (works with my game time).

Amazon Drone Simulator 2016

What a silly little game.  The page said it was like Mario 64 and Ratchet and Clank.  To me that covers a lot of territory... but it definitely covers this.  The graphics are bright and cheerful, the humor is ridiculously cringeworthy, but the controls are kinda sloppy.  And the camera angles may take a minute to get used to.

I have to say, I think this game is excellent. I'll start out with describing play style, then talk about the positives and negatives.

Obviously, this is a platformer game bringing back the days of Banjo Kazooie, Spyro and Crash Bandicoot. In regards to world and feel, it seems that Unbox hits it right on the head. I felt like I jumped right into a platformer world which made me happy. If was to compare the movement to the likes of 2D Nintendo games, I feel like it would compare more to a faster Mario play style than say a slower Donkey Kong Country style. You do have a lot of control over the boxes movement and it feels pretty easy to get used to.

On the positive side, well, this game is just really positive. The world is bright and fun, the interactions are light hearted, and the game sucked me in almost immediately. I was compeelled to start obsessing about finding gold tape because that's how I typically play these things. The box was fun to control, and yet surprisingly challenging. I thought the number of jumps you get would make it a bit easy but quickly found out how difficult it can get, but not in a super frustrating way. The game is definitely fun and I can't wait to try out some local co-op on the PC with friends!

My negatives are minor at best but I'll point them out. First, there are some reports of bugs but I only ran into one. I tried max view distance (depth?) which lets you see more of the world on your screen. Max is bugged for my setup and all I had was a strange fuzzy tunnel on the screen. Anything less than max worked fine though and I quickly settled back to the 90 default so I could see up close better. Second, someone already mentioned this but I felt like reiterating it. You can tell that this game was made on Unity. The boxes look great, but some of the world objects look a bit rigid for the rest of the world. I'm sure it's because Unbox doesn't have the art budget other titles have, but it isn't something that bothers me while playing.

Overall, this is a great game to sit back, relax, and enjoy the afternoon with. These are the games I love to play when I just need to de-stress! I'm really looking forward to Yooka-Laylee when it comes out, but we have a little ways to go before it releases. With the current 20% off promo, I feel like this game is a steal and you should definitely get it before the 12th! Support the platformers!!!

They nailed the tone/feeling/gameplay of the era but in their own colourful inventive world of sentient self delivering boxes.

The gameplay mainly consists of free roming around the different worlds doing challenges for a cast of different Box characters scattered around the worlds. If successful you will receive a stamp form them. There is 20 stamps to collect in each world and 200 gold tapes scattered everywhere. The gold tapes are everywhere from just around on the floor to in some really hard to reach places (eg. On top of a really tall tower). There is also 10 caged box NPC's that need freeing in each map aswell as a Boss to beat. You can't face the boss until you have collected enough stamps to do so.

That's where the games one main mechanic comes into play, to move around the wolrds you can do a normal jump but you can ""Unbox"" while in the air to perform a double jump if you will. The great thing is that you can do it up to 6 times to get some serious air, you'll be flying thru the sky trying to land in some very hard to reach places coz you can see that shining golden tape just waiting to be collected.

You can only ""Unbox"" once for each Health box you have (up to 6). These Health boxes are in abundant supply tho so you rarely find you can't use the ability. There is also checkpoints scattered  around that when used will fill your health boxes up aswell as count as your next spawn point incase you die.

That brings me to explain that there is no real dying in this game. You will see tho that you can't hit the water more than once without ""dying"" which sends you back to the last checkpoint you visited with no consequences. You migh find that some collectables are so far out that you won't have enough Health boxes to get back to land, you can hold down a button/key and it will respawn back at the last checkpoint. You might get crushed by stompers and other hazards around the worlds but again all it will do is respawn you at last checkpoint.

So as i'm sure you can tell this game isn't supposed to be anything more than it is. A casual kid friendly collectathon game which has been a joy to play. You definetly see the Banjo-Kazooie influence all over this game down to the text boxes, the noises the NPC's make when talking and just the general gameplay similarities. I'd say this game is a lot easier than Banjo-Kazooie but I have only just unlocked the 2nd of 3 worlds from what I can tell (correct me if i'm wrong), so I don't know if the difficulty ramps up but I can't imagine it.

You have a main Hub world which also has stuff to collect in and which gives you access to the Worlds thru doors in different areas of the Hub. The worlds look huge and is really fleshed out into what theme it is supposed to be. The first one being a tropical island them and the only other world I have seen yet is a snow themed one complete with slippery snow. Can't wait to see what the next theme will be.

I found myself amazed at just how well it all works maybe being used to so many broken releases nowadays, it was such a nice suprise to play this and it just oozes Nintendo like quality control. I haven't encounterd a single bug/glitch while playing with a solid 60fps. Seriously if you like these type of games you will have a blast. 

There is even local 4 player races and battles which I haven't tried yet so won't comment on it.

Higly recommended if you like the games which it is inspired by. However if you like your games challenging, you probably won't find satisfaction here so probably give it a miss. The only real time you might notice a difficulty spike is when you are doing challenges for stamps as some of these are on time limits, which means you might fail a couple of times but they're still easy enough to get thru.

 If you do wanna just sit back and and enjoy a well made original nod to the golden era of the N64 then pick this up you won't regret it.",1473410012,1473410575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unbox, un juego de plataformeo lleno de colores, diversidad de locaciones, muchos personajes y f√≠sicas divertidas. El equipo desarrollador Prospect Games ve su obra inspirada en juegos como Banjo-Kazooie, donde la nostalgia les ayud√≥ a llevar a cabo este juego que pueden disfrutar desde ni√±os hasta los mas grandes en casa. Tuvimos una entrevista con sus creadores, la cual esta al final del articulo.

https://youtu.be/Xstrq25E074

Unbox nos cuenta la historia de una compa√±√≠a encargada de hacer env√≠os de correspondencia, la cual en su af√°n de no caer en la desgracia de la bancarrota decide empezar a crear cajas que se auto entregan a sus debidos destinos, ahorrando tiempo y dinero. Nosotros entramos en acci√≥n cuando se crea la ultima de las cajas, con la mejor tecnolog√≠a, si nombre es Newbie y sera la encargada se cumplir una serie de retos y misiones con tal de salvar la compa√±√≠a.

Enfocado en una experiencia de un jugador, con plataformeo como su experiencia jugable principal, Unbox nos propone salvar a GPS (Global Postal Service) de un inminente cierre de operaciones, para esto deberemos realizar muchas actividades, como recoger estampillas, las cuales se nos ser√°n otorgadas por medio de la realizaci√≥n de eventos o misiones que nos encomendaran los NPC‚Äôs del juego, que de paso cada uno tiene sus peculiaridades y actitudes, algunos con personalidades muy chistosas y alguno que otro muy gru√±√≥n.


Entre las actividades que deberemos realizar para ganar estampillas, est√°n acabar con los secuaces de Boss Wild , nuestro n√©mesis en el juego, en una de las misiones, nos dan dos minutos para acabar con 20 de los pillos que trabajan para Boss Wild, si lo logramos, ganaremos una estampilla. Otra de las misiones consist√≠a en ir a dejar una carta a uno de los NPC‚Äôs en cinco minutos, mientras evit√°bamos ser atacados por los ya mencionados secuaces, intentar evitar los enemigos, no caer al agua, evitar cajas con TNT y buscar la manera mas corta de llegar a destino a la misma vez, se vuelve un desaf√≠o divertido, otro enemigo son los Wildcards.

Pero quien es Boss Wild? De primera entrada el porque de su enojo es un misterio, conforme vamos avanzando nos vamos dando cuenta quien es y porqu√© esta tan enojado con la GPS. Ademas de los distintos personajes, podemos encontrar la sastrer√≠a, donde podemos cambiar el look de Newbie, dandole distintos colores, ponerle sombreros, agregarle detalles como bigotes, anteojos, entre otros, con hasta 40,000 posibilidades diferentes en cuanto a maneras de vestirle o cambiarle el ‚Äòlook‚Äò.

Lo mas llamativo de Unbox son sus distintos escenarios, todos super coloridos y bien detallados, el uso de Unreal Engine 4 fue sin duda un acierto. Podemos encontrar zonas nevadas donde podremos incluso esquiar, un pueblo donde viven las cajitas lleno de color, muy vivo, y super agradable a la vista, aqu√≠ es donde los ni√±os encontraran lo bonito de Unbox. Hay una jungla que nos traer√° recuerdos de Donkey Kong.


El juego tambi√©n viene con un modo multijugador para modo local, donde podemos juntarnos con otros 3 amigos y jugar distintos minijuegos muy divertidos. El audio del juego a√±ade una excelente banda sonora, con m√∫sica que va muy acorde a las √°reas en las que estemos jugando, uno que otro peque√±o problema al inicio del juego con respecto a las ‚Äòvoces‚Äò de los NPC‚Äôs en la introducci√≥n del juego es lo √∫nico que pudimos percibir.

En resumen, Unbox es una excelente propuesta jugable para los que gustan de los juegos plataformeros, entornos coloridos que nos traer√°n recuerdos de Mario 64 con saltos, rompecabezas y carreras contra reloj, a parte de este analisis, hablamos con el Director General en Prospect Games, Andrew Benninson, abajo la entrevista.",1473381414,1475246748,True,6,0,0.481939852237701416,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Anyone looking at this game and looking at the massive, and positive score it's getting and thinking of buying it, well three words! Go and buy it!
It's a refreshing fun game that does not take it self serious.

As a lot of reviewers have said already, it's like playing a Nintendo game back in the 90s.
Full of charm and humour and you get that feel of super Mario world 3D or one of the great Rare game.

The developers have put this on steam at a cheaper price upon early launch, but to be honest the full price is very very cheap for a really fun 3D / adventure game with platforming elements and other great ideal's thrown in to this awsome game.

It real feels like it should be on a console, but we have this style of game on PC!.
It's got so much stuff to do in it like shooting targets, quests for other little box buddies you meet along the way and even racing sections to.
Also you have baddie's to fight and the normal Boss sort of fights to.
And from the mini games you do as well, it well sort of feels a little like Mario party to!.

There is so much to say about this refreshing game, amongst the norm of call of duty and battle field games, that this is original to a degree, and not some tired franchise which is loosing ideas!.

I spoke to one of the Devs to ask if there was any plans for future expansions, and sequals!.And they emailed me back and said they would love to if the game does well and the interest was there.

Even at full price this game is cheap, and I would happily have paid double for such a awsome,charming,fun and funny game with well balanced controls and difficultly to.

Two more things to mention is it has alot of graphic options for low and very high end PCs, which you can tweak to your needs and full game pad support to.
Last but not least it has a great Caribbean music which fits the game perfect, and makes you feel you are playing a Nintendo game from the 90s even more!.

So all that's left to say is buy buy buy!
And after if you don't like it within the 2 hour play time, then get a refund! But I will be surprised if you do!.üòä",1473285361,1473285361,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The platforming is original, it's something new and it works really well after an hour of messing around. Controller is needed for this. And you unlock customizables for your character!

For the price even a few hours of gameplay would've been worth it. But the game is bigger than the price indicates. The game is casual and makes me feel mellow. It's not hard at all, but with the weird and fun box-rolling physics I think that's a good thing.

The gameplay stays the same from the first to the third island. So no upgrades or anything, just custom looks for your box which isn't enough to make me want to collect everything in the game.

The multiplayer is actually really fun if you have 4 people to play with. Chaotic fun. 2 or 3 isn't enough because of the complex juming and rolling around the most experienced platformgamer will almost always win. So it's not a great party game. 

It took me about 10 hours to complete (without doing everything) and that includes playing multiplayer.

The game isn't comparable to super mario 64 or banjo-kazooie in my opinion, but then those were aaa-titles with the pricetag to match.

No, seriously, I had never heard of this before it released on Steam, but I decided to take a gamble and buy it, and I'm blown away.

If you miss the 3D platformer/collectathon genre, and maybe you've been disappointed by some other indie attempts to mimic that genre, I think maybe you should try Unbox.  It does have similar gameplay to those N64-era favorites, but it's kinda doing its own thing at the same time.  Unbox isn't a straight-up clone of Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie.. it sets out to provide a similar type of game, while bringing its own unique flavor.

The controls are solid (at least on a controller, I haven't really tried Mouse/keyboard yet), the gameplay and world seem polished, and the game gives you some really big, detailed worlds to explore, collect things, and complete challenges in.  It even has boss fights!

At the time of writing this review, I've played about 2 hours, and I've only just reached the second world (not counting the rather large hub area), and I'm having a great time. I've been collecting any collectibles that I've come across, and I plan on going back for the rest later, because I'm actually having enough fun to maybe 100% this.

If I had one thing to complain about, it'd be the music.  It's not bad or anything, you just hear it looping over and over and over and over again, and it gets kinda old after a while.. or at least the first world's music does.

From the moment you start this game you can tell where it gets its inspiration and thats the games of Rare in the 90s. From the cute nonsense babbling characters to the light sense of humour, this is a love letter (no pun intended) to the likes of Banjo and so far I love it. The first world is brimming with charm; from the boxes that follow you around and welcome you to the little cars you can drive. I always think that you can tell the quality of a 3D platformer by how much you want to just forget about the point of it and explore, and this one had me doing it from the start (which is frustrating that it starts with a locked in tutorial).


Amount of content -

1x Hub World
3x Quest Worlds

Each world will take you around 2hrs minimum. I think most people will play it for between 8-10hrs and it took me 16hrs to 100% it. There is enough content to warrent the asking price, especially when you consider that the quest worlds are considerably bigger than a level in a game like Banjo.

Gameplay -

On the surface this is a collectathon like Mario64, Banjo etc, but it is not just copying them and I love the fact that it is also trying to bring something new to the table, which comes in the form of the unbox mechanic. This allows you to jump up to 6 times without landing, enabling crazy big jumps. The game suggests your health is connected to the unbox mechanic, however there are very few things that actually make you lose health which for me does diminish the excitement of it by the end.

Another way in which it builds on the platformers it takes inspiration from is the amount of character interactions. Not only are their quests to find, but people to talk to about the world you are exploring adding further flavour to the world you are tumbling through. 

The difficulty of the game is similar to the likes of Banjo with a mixture of stupidly easy to more fiddly tasks. However the tone of the game gives you the feeling of relaxed fun even when trying to judge the gap between two distant boats you want to jump to. 

Finally there is the customisation of your plain brown box. Completing the tasks and parts of the story lead to customisation unlocks which means you can turn your boring packaging into a weird bounding wonder. So if definining the protagonist your way is important to you then it is there and it is easy to do (you just need to find the tailor, which took me about 10mins after the first island unlocks).

Graphics and Technical Stuff.

The graphics are a mixed bunch with a combination of some great water textures and rock textures combined with some very plain ones mixed in, which works for the most part but at times can seem a little strange (watch the video above and you will see what i mean). However I found its short comings did not hinder the gameplay, which based on the first world I love.

It has an uncapped framerate and on my 970 rig will all settings maxed I was getting around 100fps at 1080p and there were no noticable major dips or stuttering. You can adjust things like FOV if you want and I know this is an important issue for some.

I would like to note that the game did crash for me while I was messing with the settings, but I suspect this was my firewall, because when I logged back in I had to allow the game access to areas my firewall didn't auto allow. After this initial crash I had no other bugs or crashes playing the game, however there was a little screen tearing which was largely removed by uncapping the framerate (others have suggested turning on vsync in your GPU control panel).

Controls -

How the character controls is important in a platformer as much as any other and I found the controls to be good; although controlling an object with sharp corners meant I needed a few moments to get to grips with how the box handles (because it does handle like a box and not like a ball). The vehicle controls do feel a bit looser and I am not sure how much that is me or the game.

The developers recommend a controller and because it is a 3D platformer I would agree, however I found it perfectly playable with WASAD and a mouse (mouse controls the camera and unbox mechanic while keyboard is used to move jump and interact). I could not get my DS4 to work with it natively, if that is how you like to game. However it worked great with my Xbox Elite and its paddles.

One issue I forgot to mention when I reviewed this initially was the fact that the controls are not customisable. So if that is a major issue for you, then you will need to take that into consideration.

Multiplayer -

This is local only and while it looks fun from YouTube videos I never had a chance to play it.

For Parents -

There is nothing in this game that would not be suitable for children of any age. The fact that enemies do not damage you, (only push you flying into the air and into the water grrr) and the fact that all enemies are boxes make it very kid friendly. Humour and tone has some more mature ideas but there is nothing sexual or particularly violent underpinning this game.

Overall-

All in all, I think this is a great game and I love my time within it. It is the 3D platformer I have been waiting for and wet my appetite for Yooka next year.
