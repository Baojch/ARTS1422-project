After an unfortunate rushed release, this game was panned and ignored because of reports of bugs, glitches, and unbalanced mechanics. This may have been true in the first few weeks, but the developer of the game has polished it since into an incredible 2D character action/metroidvania blend.

The meat of this game is the combat system, which encourages you to string together combos, like in DMC or Bayonetta, to stunlock enemies and bosses for as long as possible. This game accommodates high level play while still being accessible to lower skilled players. The combos are easy to grasp and open to experimentation, with nice optional tutorials that reward you with items for showing your mastery. Every single attack can be dodge cancelled, allowing you to focus on combos and quickly dodge enemies without worrying about committing to a long string. Even if you're not good at combos, you can beat the game by using consumables to freeze enemies, heal in the middle of battle, raise your damage, and more. Additionally, most bosses in the game give you the ability to choose between an easier or harder version of the fight by choosing to taunt the boss. The regular version of the fight generally has lower health, lower damage, and the hardest attacks are nerfed or removed from the fight. The harder version of the fight is a great challenge that will test the limits of seasoned masocore players, especially if you try to beat them without using any consumables at all, a feat the game encourages its mostly sweaty players to accomplish, same as all great character action games.

The metroidvania elements are a distant second to the fights, but they are still satisfying. After the first two bosses, you are given free rein to explore the entire world at your own leisure. Throughout the world, you can find trinkets, which can be equipped for status effects and nice buffs, which allow strategic players to mix and match for an advantage. You can also find permanent HP/MP/Damage boosters. The metroidvania elements themselves are somewhat standard, but the platforming is nontraditional, same as the developer's last game, Wings of Vi. You'll be encouraged to use your jump and flutter, as well as various types of jump refreshers, in novel and interesting ways that are not always obvious how to get past. The developer also does a good job of keeping the platforming interesting by throwing in fun gimmicks that help to keep the game paced well.

The bosses in this game combine with the platforming to make up the most fun segments of the game. No boss feels like filler, and all of them have unique gimmicks and attacks that differentiate them and encourage players to use their brains to figure out the best way to minmax damage while still managing the boss fights gimmick. The developer's bosses are so fun because they have little to no invincibility frames, and can be attacked at nearly any point, allowing highly skilled players to quickly kill bosses. I enjoyed nearly all the bosses (one boss involving the water level doesn't count) and didn't even find the boss I didn't enjoy a big issue, as I could have made it easier by playing the easier version of the boss and using consumables if I really felt tired of it.

In short, Roah is an excellent time with a unique 2d character action game style combat that is very rarely seen, if at all. I would recommend this game to both moderately skilled players and sweaty hardcores, and I can not wait to play this game again on the hardest difficulty.",1711437826,1711437826,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

If you try to load it, then it simply will not load. I found a work around , use the blue crystals to save. I play this on Proton but I encountered this bug on Windows as well. This is a good game from what I can tell, and I am not sure if I am the only one suffering from this bug. I do recommend this game because I am a fan of the Developer and I enjoyed Wings of VI.

Edit:

After Playing this game hardcore on Ubuntu Linux, I manage to beat this game on Grand Master mode on my first attempt to beat the game. The game is really fun and very challenging. Their seems to be more then one way to beat the bosses. The levels are truly challenging but not as hard as wings of vi which I actually do enjoy because not every game needs to be as hard as wings of vi. I understand all the complaints about the game ,but keep in mind their is only one devs at the time of launch. At the time , I played this game at 2023 when I started and completed early 2024,  I think the game is Fantastic. The map was a little hard too follow but in the end, I never felt like most bosses were unfair.  I like the design of the character , the game play is now solid as of 2024 Grand Master mode.  For all purposes this game is golden. The only thing I wish could improve is easier to follow map system and maybe a little bit more lore for the character. I give this game a 8 out 10!

As your usual metroid-like game, you have to explore the open-ish world, defeat all bosses and collect powerups and upgrades along the way in order to complete the game. Visuals are good (DAMN levels of good, I am surprised there are little to no rule 34 content about this). I played with music turned off, but the first location soundtrack is a banger. 

The world is tightly packed, so you won't need to travel 20 kilometers just to reach your destination. Movement is quirky, but I got used to it pretty quickly, because there is no additional movement buttons like in Wings of Vi. Combat is straightworward enough, I don't like using combo systems and I was fine in this game without it. Level design from the platforming side was on par with movement: quirky, but manageable. Bossfights require you to learn them, so no facerolling (you will get overwhelmed pretty quickly if you try to). 
There are also additional challenges for the fans of boss grinding in form of achievements.

My keyboard controls won't even save when I exit and re-enter the game, and combined with other bugs, this makes it quite infuriating for me to get into speedrunning the game.

[h1] Cons [/h1]
[list]
[*]BUGS. Bosses like [spoiler]Moka and B.O.S.H.Y.[/spoiler] have a history of odd behavior and cheese strats, though these issues have largely been patched out by now. Other small issues include occasional weird behavior with enemy shields, occasional sped-up animations and infinitely spawning rocks (causing immense game lag) on [spoiler]Reanimated Field Marshall[/spoiler], indefinite music looping if a player exits a save file immediately before a new track fades in, and probably more that I can't think of right now. Despite this, the developer is very responsive and has historically patched out issues that players bring to his attention (via the Official Roah Discord).
[*]A few platforming saves probably have not been playtested enough, particularly in [spoiler]The Crypt and Sekkian Hive 2, the latter being virtually impossible if I recall correctly[/spoiler].
[*]It feels a bit clunky to have to pause the game to use consumables; it sort of detracts from the boss fight experience.
[*]I'm still confused as to why save points have limited respawns. At the very least, there's a consumable in the game that directly counteracts this issue.
[/list]

[h2] Pros [/h2]
[list]
[*]The combo system feels very nice. Once you get it down, it makes the combat feel fluid and engaging.
[*]Trinkets are generally well-balanced and creative and they support a variety of playing styles adequately (damage-based, health-based, defense-based, gimmick-based, etc.).
[*]Achievements and challenge runs are fun to do.
[*]Bosses and enemies are creatively designed and generally fair.
[*]Fun references like [spoiler]B.O.S.H.Y. and King of Death = Skeleton King[/spoiler].

Je však potřeba si uvědomit, kolik lidí na hře pracovalo.

Příběh není nějak úžasný. Orimu se nemůže rovnat ani v emocích, ani ve vyprávění, ale na uvedení do děje stačí. Vlastně to považuji za celkem výhodu. Ačkoli hra má podobnost s anime, není tak ukecaná, což uvítají zejména hráči, kteří nepotřebují číst kvanta textu (což mi teď připomíná, že v Orim se vůbec nemluvilo).
Jako vyvolená válečnice Roah se vydáte do pouště, zjistit, co se vlastně děje a co způsobuje narušení světa.

Jako většina metroidvánií, je i tady otevřený svět, i když ten není tak komplexní, jako u jiných her. Svět je sice otevřený, ale nemáte ho ničím ohraničen. Pád do propasti tak prostě znamená smrt. Stejně tak se přistupuje i k mapě, která postrádá nějaké detailnější zpracování. Je to trochu škoda, protože mít k dispozici i detailní mapy jednotlivých lokací, by usnadnilo navigaci a předešlo občasnému bloudění.

Velký vliv ve hře má soubojový systém. Po úvodní sekci získáte klepítko pro základní útok. Postava Roah je neohrabaná a nemotorná a špatně se ovládá. Jenže po čase získáte další způsoby útoků a i když o moc obratnější nebude, bude možnost vytvářet z útoků komba a řetězit je, celkem zábava. Ve výsledku tak můžete udělat brutální kombo, kterým zabijete i silného nepřítele.
Tady je ovšem nutné zmínit, že ona neohrabanost při soubojích se trochu projeví i na přesnosti útoků. Často se nějaké kombo prostě nepovede nebo řetězení se ukončí dříve, než ho dokončíte. Je to trochu vrub indie her, ale hraní samotné to neovlivňuje, byť možnost dělat nekonečné komba by byla super.
Nakonec se přidají i kouzla, kterými si můžete pomoci, nebo je prostě zařadit do svých komb.

Smrt zde má svůj styl. Není ani dobrý ale ani zlý. Vlastně je řešen celkem zajímavě a většinou nebyl nějak na překážku. Ve světě jsou totiž rozmístěny checkpointy, kde se vám hra uloží a v případě smrti se vrátíte sem. Každý checkpoint má však jen omezený počet použití. většinou 3, u bossů 15 (a věřte mi, že to nemusí ani zdaleka stačit). Když vyčerpáte všechny použití a zemřete, hra vás prostě hodí na předchozí checkpoint, na kterém jste si hru uložili před tím.

Díky tomuto systému se autor rozhodl jít cestou větší výzvy a náročnějších bossů. Mezi checkpointy tak můžete narazit na náročnou pasáž plnou trnů a nepřátel, kde musíte rychle a přesně reagovat, nebo tuhých bossů, které si nejspíše párkrát zopakujete.
U těch rychlých a přesných rekací se však dostáváme do trochu složitější situace. Jak už jsem psal, ovládání Roah je celkem neohrabané, což tyto pasáže dost komplikuje a často se tak dostanete do situace, že ani na 10 pokus zkrátka nemůžete danou část udělat (u mě to bylo i 50 pokusů, ale dodávám, že šlo o bug ve hře, který znemožnil pokračování, komunikace s autorem však byla dobrá a hra byla opravena do několika málo minut).
S povzdechem tak budete vzpomínat na ladně se houpajícího Oriho, ale srovnávat Oriho a Roah je ve své kategorii dost nefér. Přes to se srovnání s jinými podobnými hrami nevyhnete, především, že to šlo udělat trochu líp.

Hra se dá dohrát za cca 15 hodin, což je na metroidvánii velmi slušný čas, ale je individuální, kolik času strávíte nad jednotlivými částmi hry a jak moc chcete prozkoumávat svět. Ve světě se totiž nachází i podpůrné předměty, které vás vybaví nějakým tím pasivním bonusem/postihem.

Grafika hry působí celkem dobře. Není to žádná patlanina, ani pixeartová hra, ale nabízí celkem hezké a ručně malované objekty. I přes to, že se jedná o hru dvou tvůrců, není vyloženě ošklivá.

Hudební doprovod se také povedl. Není zde dabing (kromě nějakých hlášek bossů), což však nevadí. Hudba se sice opakuje, ale na poslech to není špatné. Spíše egyptsky laděné.

Hůř je na tom technické zpracování hry. Ta nabízí poměrně mnoho bugů. Ať už jde o uvíznutí v texturách a objektech, nesprávně se objevující nepřítel, nebo zmizení bariéry o bosse. Většinou se nejedná o nic zásadního a případů, kdy vyloženě budete muset resetovat hru, bylo minimum, přesto se jich však pár našlo. Výjimkou nebyl ani případ, že skok, který byl potřeba pro pokročení ve hře, zkrátka nebyl technicky možný, což způsobil bug v aktualizaci. Je škoda, že hra nemá trochu lepší technické zpracování. Byl by to přece jen trochu lepší herní zážitek, nebýt takových záseků.

Roah tak ve výsledku doporučuji. Jedná se o hru, kterou se v této kategorii vyplatí zahrát a pokořit. I když není bezchybná, je již ve stavu dohrání. Doufám, že do budoucna se podaří odstranit i zbytek bugů. Zejména lidé, toužící po výzvách a náročnější herní náplni, si přijdou na své.

I flawless-ed all the bosses in that game and I loved the platforming and movement in the game. Roah is a frustrating (and not in the good kind of way) buggy version of Wings of Vi.

The combat is fun, it plays like a 2D fighting game with some platforming. You have a weak and heavy hit moveset all which you can use to combo enemies. As well as some magic abilities which use a ""magic bar."" All of this, is fun. Throw in some platforming and you have yourself a fun and challenging game in your hands. What isn't fun is dying to a boss that has an insane amount of health and has the potential to do 3/4 of your health in a fraction of a second. 

The bosses just feel horrible in this game. It also doesn't help that the game limits the amount of tries you have. Yes, you read that right. (At least on normal difficulty) You get 3 retries from the last save and then you get booted back to the previous save spot and repeat. This is ok for platforming sections, they're not too hard but it is terrible for bosses. This makes grinding against a boss EVEN MORE frustrating. Bosses (on normal) have 15 tries then you get booted back. There are items that can restore your health and the amount of save retries you have but its like...... why? Why can't the player have a larger health pool and no restore items? Larger health bar allows you to make more mistakes each attempt. No restore items means your mistakes count. If you die in 3 hits to bosses whats the point of restore items. Why have the player regress backwards for failing to beat a section or boss in less than x attempts when they have already proven they can beat the previous section? That isn't difficulty, that's just annoyance. That's just to make the player frustrated, that is NOT what difficulty is or should be. 

I think the reason bosses feel so bad is because Roah is all about combos. Your combos deal a LOT of damage if you get good at them. The problem is..... you can't combo bosses. So you do no damage. And they have a metric f-ton of health. So it's gonna take forever. And it's just frustrating more than it is hard.

As for the buggy aspect of the game. I have softlocked a few times in the four hours I've played. I have clipped into a wall while climbing a ladder unable to get out. I softlocked sliding down a hill and landing on an entrance in the ground. I softlocked jumping after exiting an entrance. I wonder how much more there is.

I get that this game is supposed to be difficult and I honestly like games like that (wings of vi, I wanna be the guy etc) but this just replaced difficulty with annoyance and frustration rather than actually making the game hard. This feels more like a ""getting over it"" kind of game than anything else.

I'll stick to the game, maybe try and beat this stupid boss. But I'd hate to restart the game on easy.... I don't see myself trying to flawless bosses in this game. I just can't recommend the game right now.",1609475478,1666600547,False,13,0,0.666142404079437256,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's some bits that may be frustrating but honestly it's ultimately satisfying. Exploring and challenges are very rewarding and it feels like it's all worth it. I'm glad something like this exists where I had to think about how I should attack and evade throughout the game so you always feel engaged. I'd say the positives outweigh the negatives. Sometimes you may snag on ledges, which is the most consistent problem. Some situations are made a bit more overwhelming because of it. Still, from what I understand this game was a big learning experience as well and even now updates keep coming in for it to tweak the experience. The game's also much better since launch, from what I came to understand.

Movement and physics can be very satisfying in this game, among the other interesting ideas. Platforming challenge from Solgryn's previous games can be felt here with creative sections. They don't all land quite that well, but even then it's satisfying to complete. That being said it also can be pretty fun to just get around.

Fighting is heavily inspired by timing in traditional fighting games and it's part of what makes this so interesting and engaging. There's no one thing that will win you every encounter and your style will matter.

For as tough as it can get, it's very fair. Such as bosses paying out money as you land hits so you never stay broke or have to grind on enemies to stock back up on items.

I say that if you're unsure about it then at least watch for a sale. But, I think many people who want a satisfying challenge should get this game. 

Also, transforming monster girls. Come on, people.

Pros: Bosses are colorful and fun. Platforming is as finger-destroyingly satisfying as ever (controller binding suggestion: assign up arrow to right bumper).  

Cons: Core movement feels slow and floaty, no weight to it. The combat system is probably too complex for a platformer and is hard to parse, particularly when the character is small and obscured by a large enemy. 

Verdict: This is a good game beneath the quirks. If you liked Wings of Vi, you will find this worth your time.

Advice to developer: Your bottleneck is lack of delegation. Take a page from Derek Yu's book and find a trusted partner who knows good code architecture. It is a lot easier to code well the first time than it is to fix problems afterwards.

(In-depth analysis deleted due to Steam's character limit. Here's the summary)

In summary, Roah might not be a perfect game. It's a little rough around the edges. But it's doing a damn fine job being what it was intended to be, especially considering that Solgryn did all the programming, writing AND artworks by himself. I'm having a lot of fun with it, and am glad to see that Solgryn is still actively developing it, fixing bugs and even adding content. 

In its current state I can gladly recommend Roah to fans of the genre. Why Solgryn released it in November as the bugfest that it was back then remains beyond me, but the game has already come a long way, and continues to get better and better.

(a word of advice though: If you're not either extremely good at action platforming games or just a bit masochistic, do yourself a favour and play it on easy. Standard difficulty is fine for somewhat seasoned players for the most part of the game, but the last 3 bosses WILL F**K YOU UP and make you question your every life choice. You WILL suffer. I know I did. Solgryn... let's just say he has a very different understanding of a 'challenging game'.)",1583433005,1583791420,True,6,1,0.598270058631896973,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In all honesty in many areas this feels like an early access game, (Some reviewers mentioning unbalanced bosses for high difficulties), glitches of various kinds, both graphical and gamebreaking, lack of quality of life features(of which some have been added in the two weeks since I started playing) and the game really having trouble processing advanced terrain geometry where you can be stuck on the stairs while running up them, get turned around when entering the crawling animation therefore moving forward much slower, or grab on the wrong side of a ladder.

So while I'm not saying ""Get it NOW for sure"", I see a familiar pattern to what went on with Wings of Vi where it took a couple of years worth of patching to make it as great as it is.

The reason I'm giving it a positive review though, is because of the amazing developer interaction when it comes to fixing bugs on top of the ongoing little content updates appearing rather frequently for a team of that size.
If you run into a bug, both a rare one that makes your character t-pose on rare conditions, or a gamebreaking bug that does not let you play the game without crashing all the time, you just message the developer on Discord, and if they're online at that time, after some back and forth messages and sending the game logs and screenshots, a fix for that problem gets made in about two hours.
Not to mention that the fixes arrive on the weekends when needed too.

You will have to treat this game as It's own thing.

I never felt I got unfairly hit by a enemy or a boss, the hitboxes are spot on in these departments.
Where It's not is in the platforming, many times I know the jump I need to make but will take far too many tries than it needs.

The awkward bugs of the character standing sideways, projectiles lingering even after death and respawn checkpoints putting you inside black holes can't be ignored. 

Roah has some huge improvments from previous Solgryn games however.
Art style being a major one and a better menu to switch and use items. 

To sum it up, It's a challenging fun platformer that needs a lot more polish.
I do recommend it to any fans of challenging platformers in the style that Solgryn makes them.
The price would be fine if not for the need of so much polish.
Wait for a update of bug fixes then get it to satisfy your platforming itch.

Roah has just passed her test to become a warrior of the Shaqaal when mysterious devices start falling from the sky and drilling into the ground. She's ordered to remain in the Buhro while older, more experienced warriors investigate... so, naturally, Roah does what any good protagonist would and disobeys, sneaking out to discover what these strange machines are for and which, if any, of the Shaqaal's enemies has sent them.

The most fun by far I had with Roah was with its exploration. The world Roah inhabits is huge, gorgeous-looking, and full of quirky enemies and well-hidden power-ups. As Roah gains new moves to improve her mobility, the world only gets bigger: she starts out able to run, jump, crawl, swim for a limited time, and dash, but will gain the ability to glide, air-dash, hold her breath longer, swim faster, and eventually, straight-up fly. She starts in a desert area, but just around the bend is a mystic forest, the deep sea, a necropolis, and a hive for giant talking insects; and the great thing is, you have more access to these places right off the bat than you usually get in a metroidvania. You can't get to some bosses or treasure, but you also never feel like the “good stuff” is locked away behind abilities you don't have yet.

There's plenty to love about the combat system, though. Roah can attack with her pincers, her tail, and magic in a variety of combinations to paralyze or juggle enemies, and combat is centered around picking the right set of moves for the enemy you're facing. If you want to rely on short, quick combos that deal a moderate amount of damage, you can do this against regular enemies, but bosses mix things up; most have specific ways they're meant to be damaged, and at least one can one-shot you if you run at her swinging your fists. Favorite boss at this point: the Risen Field Marshal. How do you make zombies better? Make them able to run. How do you make a zombie that can run better? Make her fifty feet tall.

Roah isn't exactly what I would call “easy,” difficulty-wise. By the endgame, the bosses and platforming are quite challenging (unavoidable Wings of Vi comparison: the last level of this game has a lot in common with the Underworld). Roah is, however, more forgiving than I was expecting. On the apprentice setting, spikes and (most) pits won't kill you, only deal damage, and Roah is able to heal, which gives her room to make mistakes. This works well with game's design, since the open world and combo system reward experimentation, and these elements give you room to experiment without penalizing you too heavily for, say, jumping into a pit or scrolling off the right side of the screen over a spiky gap to look for treasure.

And here's one random thing I liked: I thoroughly enjoyed how Roah managed to surprise me in later levels. The final upgrade, final area, and final two unique bosses were a delight I did not see coming.

Are there flaws? Well... most of the bugs are fixed now, the rest are still being worked on, and I only got what I'd call “creepypasta glitches;” they didn't seriously interfere with what I was doing, they just occasionally turned my inventory into a slush of disembodied arms and torsos, made shopkeepers offer me high-priced empty void for sale, or turned a Deathguard immortal (I named him Archimedes).

What did trip me up were the occasionally unclear directions. Don't get me wrong, I do not want to be led by the hand through a game about exploration, and I want to figure bosses' weak points out myself as much as the next guy, but... that boss you're told to damage by hitting her tentacle? You're actually supposed to [spoiler]hit her tentacle to lower her defense, and then combo the rest of her.[/spoiler] That boss you're told to take down from the inside? You're actually supposed to [spoiler]go inside it, combo its power core once, and then leave and “take it down” from the OUTside.[/spoiler] Roah never reaches Castlevania II levels of misdirection, and in both cases it only took me a few failed tries to figure out what I was doing wrong, but those are still two distinct examples where doing what the game appears to be telling you to do will get you killed.

I still think the good outweighs the bad, and honestly, I'd recommend Roah just for the Latent Crypt and the swimming sequences. I loved the whole thing, though, and look forward to replaying.",1576285325,1576334679,True,3,0,0.505358576774597168,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Roah is a 2D-Metroidvania with fighting game-like controls. Comboing is a very important thing in this game, and learning to do so is not very hard. The game encourages you to experiment with Roah's varied movepool, leading to various combos useful for many different scenarios.

The bosses are absolutely the highlight of the game. Solgryn's strength in creating amazing boss fights in IWBTB and Wings of Vi continues showing in Roah with the bosses being incredibly fun to fight and providing a very good challenge. 

The music is once again gorgeous to listen to and fits the game like a glove. Ashton Morris knocked it out of the park with this OST.

Solgryn has promised to continue adding content to Roah, such as additional costumes and a Boss Rush mode, and even though I'm not even halfway through the game due to me adding artificial difficulty to the game by choosing to beat the bosses flawlessly on my first runthrough, I'm very much looking forward to the future of this game.",1575731880,1581988446,True,2,0,0.516129076480865479,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Old Review:
After playing through the entire game on Apprentice mode (my actual playtime is 16 hours, I was just offline on steam half the time)...

The game is alright at its core. It has a fun combat system, It's just very janky and buggy, which makes it disappointing compared to Wings of Vi (the previous game by the developer)
It can also be hard to really enjoy the combo system when most enemies don't really let you play to its strengths, making light light heavy, just a basic combo that works well enough for almost everything.

On the bright side said developer is very active, but the release is basically early access without being properly labelled so.

Now this weekend I was finally able to play it. Also receiving mixed reviews so far, I feel more than obliged to write a detailed review on Roah.

Roah is a platformer, featuring a thic arachnid-scorpio-kind female protagonist and comes with a combo-heavy fighting system.
As far as I remember it is based on the Unity engine. The input/control is well done and it features beautiful 2D art.
As for the combos, I think at times they are rather difficult to execute with the right timing, but this may get better with the game's learning curve.

Roah is not as hard as Wings of Vi and I managed to hit ~36% completion in about 4 hours on medium difficulty.
However, the game does get significantly harder in the areas I'm exploring right now.
But compared to Wings of Vi, which I wasn't even able to finish on angel (easy) mode, Roah appears much more doable, while still being pretty hard.

The game does have some minor control and clipping issues as of the time I'm writing this review, but it's only been released 3 days ago. Today there even were at least two patches. I did not encounter any game breaking problems so far, so I guess these problems will be evened out in some weeks. And finally, native high resolution :)

Only real criticism on my part is the story, which seems rather thin up until now.
But still, I've only seen a third of the game so far, so let's see.

So, to summarize:

+ challenging, but not insanely hard
+ unique character
+ combo-heavy fighting
+ hot characters (if you are into thic girls)
+ beautiful artwork

- sometimes hard to do combo inputs with correct timing
- minor bugs 3 days after release

Controls are awful, controller support seems to be an afterthought (if any thought was put in at all). The game just feels bad, it's difficult to tell where ledges actually are as the collision on them does not match the art.

I have beaten I wanna be the boshy, wings of vi demon mode etc. I loved his previous games for the most part. I'm a seasoned hardcore platformer beaten rabi ribi DLC 3 BEX etc. This negative review isn't a matter of ""git gud"" considering I was one of the first if not the first to complete some of these bosses esp harvester unnerfed version GM with like a 17 hour binge play.

Roah was released extremely buggy - Solgryn's strategy was to tackle bugs as they come up in streams (i.e. use guinea pigs). He is also unsure of how hard to make the game on grandmaster and there have been several patches after the fact that players are unable to beat bosses where he nerfs them heavily. Then wait til the first player / first few players get to another boss then nerf / fix. Rinse and repeat - it's not a fun experience when you're the one ahead of everyone else.

Imagine you're the first to fight a boss and you see the numbers are INSANE compared to the previous bosses. Spend 4 hours fighting and beat a boss only to have been a patch to basically make that boss a joke and beatable within a few attempts. Even the hardest version of boss easier than the unnerfed version. Okay fine move on. Two bosses later run into some impossible shit where you have to memorize 6 exploding balls to attack in correct order or instant death and also with broken hitboxes made this even more frustrating when you hit wrong ball instant death. It's also limited time you must hit all 6. Spend a few hours doing that while the save point is broken forcing me to run back 3 checkpoints go to boss every 10 deaths. Complete the 6 bombs and do 10% of the boss' life. Make one mistake = instant death. I wasted 3-5 hours. So what was the nerf for this boss? Dropped a few hours later - reduced armor of boss. The BS mechanic of the exploding balls was there there so how do I win? Equipped all the damage items and basically 100 0'ed the boss. Literally he didn't even have time to do anything at all. I spammed magic and attack he literally went from 100 to 0 stun locked. That's not good boss design. Or game design for that matter. Also his patch introduced a bug where you could spawn infinitely from boss spawn point instead of 10 deaths like it should. Instead of making him burstable, he should've made the aspect of memorizing the balls less intensive. Twitch clip: (SPOILERS): https://clips.twitch.tv/SoftPowerfulDurianDatSheffy

This process will likely repeat for the remaining 2 GM bosses with 0% achievement so best thing to do is wait for the nerfs then play to avoid the frustration of an impossible fight. 

Also, you're very likely to run into bugs that basically trap you into death, force you to restart, screw you over in boss fights, kill you, crash your game, etc.

There are positives, though. The metroidvania aspect of the game was fun - altthough you'll have to explore and run around a lot to figure out where to go / what upgrade you're missing. There is no detailed map so you'll have to make do with your memory and running around, but I find that to be a plus in a metroidvania especially one that is difficult. Luckily after the first day, he nerfed all the trash mobs which originally (surprise) were basically impossible to kill. I'm talking HUGE nerfs as with any time I mention nerf. Like up to 70% damage reduction, 50% health reduction etc.

In short, what you're buying is basically an EA version of the game and a clown fiesta. I'm just going to beat the game and forget about it at this point. After playing Rabi Ribi I can't look at this game and say to myself that it's good boss design. 

If Solgryn can polish the game to make it as good as or better or Wings of Vi, great. But I don't see that happening. For me, my experience and hope has already been soiled and destroyed. 

Wings of Vi was a step in the right direction after his first game I wanna be the Boshy. He tried to make Roah another step forward but instead went like four steps backward.

Wings of Vi from same developer was so much better, smooth and fair. That game was patched a lot, so maybe this one will be fixed as well? Especially bugs when you got stuck inside the wall or in the floor.
Challenges and platforming are more annoying than challenging overall, bosses are fine, but in Wings of Vi they were many times better, plus here sometimes bosses just forgetting to attack. Invul frames on enemies is a weird descision as well.
I was expecting from this game more. It is still not bad game, tho. For now it is maximum 6.2~6.5/10, when Wings of Vi was 8.5-8.8/10.

Edit: Solgryn did a lot of fixes and added new stuff. Game is much more polished now and controls are better. However, they are still not perfect like in Wings of Vi, and bugs with stucking in things are still there. I would give it 7.2~7.4/10 now.
