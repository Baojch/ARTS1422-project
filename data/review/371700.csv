Aquí todo va a una velocidad supersónica, por lo que los reflejos serán nuestra principal herramienta para hacer frente a los numerosos niveles con los que nos toparemos en el juego. Todo va a una velocidad endiablada, y será fundamental ir recogiendo los diferentes ítems que se encuentran diseminados en los niveles (mejora de disparo, bombas, reducción temporal de la velocidad del scroll, escudo protector, etc.), ya que de lo contrario todo será mucho más complicado.

Si te gustan  los matamarcianos y también la velocidad, sin duda este juego te gustará. Resulta adictivo, variado, y con una curva de dificultad bastante bien conseguida. Muy recomendable...",1563549450,1563549450,True,2,0,0.540407180786132813,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It took some adjusting to get used to the speed at which the ship moved, but once I got that down, I found that I was able to survive a lot easier.  Also had to change my thinking to coin collecting rather than blowing everything else up since coins will up yoiur multiplier, and high score is the name of this game.  This is made trickier by the fact that your ship continually accelerates until it hits top speed for the level, making you have to dodge obstacles at break-neck paces.  To make it even worse, as you progress through levels, your top speed increases, so you just will continually go faster the longer you play.  You can get power-ups to help, well, if you can react quick enough to get to them.  The main issues I had generally stemmed around death.  Having a finish line to every level that's actually a wall you have to shoot through can be irritating if your weapon is at the lowest power or you're at very high speed as it's very easy to just slam into it, and dying right at the end of a level to something like that is just a bit demoralizing.  The other issue is that, after you die, your weapon power is dropped all the way to the lowest setting which, while blowing up stuff isn't really the name of the game, gives you a much narrower target area making sections where you have to blast through walls or die much trickier.  I also was left wondering if the other ships are just cosmetic since I tried out numerous ones and they all felt exactly the same.  Only other issue is that this is a game I have to play in shorter bursts.  The bright colors combined with the high speed just wear on my eyes a bit, so extended gaming periods with it would be rough for some.  All in all, it's still one heck of a solid game that is great for scoreboard chasers since it has an online scoreboard.  If you have good reflexes and memory for level layouts, then you will be able to wreck this game.",1547501945,1547501945,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,True,False,False,,,
