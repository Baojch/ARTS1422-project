I really wanted to love it. It's a great concept. The combat is great. The art is nice and different too. And it's a cool throwback to old Dungeon Crawlers. But it really needs a lot of tweaks. But basically the procedural nature of the levels - or actually how bad it is implemented - is the worst part of it. The randomness of the levels creates way too many absolutely unfair and stupid situations that could be avoided with just a bit of better design and just a bit more respect for players' time.

It will not be uncommon for you as a lvl1 or 2, in the two beginning dungeons, to suddenly enter a room that is a trap (and no way to identify it as such), that blocks all exits as soon as you touch a pixel inside, and throws immediately two zombies at you, and an enemy on the other side of said room that shoots projectiles at you. And you only have a knife and some pants.. and you can't move because the zombies were right at the entrance and jumped at you as soon as you got in, and again the door behind you is now blocked, so you are stuck and can't move at all.. and the projectiles from the enemy on the back of the room pass through the zombies, so you can't reach him or dodge those attacks as well.

So you'll die and die and die in the beginning dungeons. Not because its your fault, but because the game is just incredibly bad and poorly designed at the first two dungeons. If you managed to be lucky or very persistent, or both, and you manage to get the good items then there is fun to be had after the the second dungeon (and sometimes it gets too easy afterwards ironically). But to get there you'll suffer a lot from repetition, since your skills are completely denied constantly in those starting couple of dungeons.

This could be easily sorted by just programming the system to:

a) not create certain situations that are nearly impossible to overcome on the first couple of dungeons (i.e. more than two enemies per room, no ""block all doors"" traps on the first dungeon, introduce enemies that shoot projectiles only on the second dungeon, etc.)

b) not make the player get constantly stuck in clutter in the already very small rooms

c) and to make projectiles from enemies hit other enemies as well (this would feel much fair given that most of the time there is no space enough to dodge so many projectiles). It could even create infighting like in Doom. Now that would be fun, and funny, to see.",1710531894,1710532522,False,3,0,0.481545418500900269,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's a competent dungeon crawler with very nice combat, reminiscent of dark messiah (you can parry, you can kick enemies into spikes or pits, you have some special abilities, etc.) and admittedly fun progression and skill system.
Enemies are varied, the spells and skills are cool enough you can focus on different playstyles. I absolutely adore the aesthetics and the plot (at least of the characters i played as, every character has a different story that unlocks as you progress) is surprisingly good for a dungeon crawler.
I would buy in on a discount, as the game has a few flaws that really sometimes left a sour taste in my mouth.
First big nitpick is that the progression system really awards playing like a coward. 80% of your progression is items and you lose them if you die, but there are chutes you can drop your items and they become available at the start of a new run. So they moment the levels start getting difficult, the best play is to drop all your good items down the chute and start over with your good items and grind the easy levels again.
The second thing and the one that almost made me quit is that each type of the dungeon has some jumping puzzle, that depending on the generation, is mandatory to progress. The jumping in this game is not fun, the action grinds to a halt as you wait for slow moving platforms to rise out of the walls and you still miss the jump because of the terrible jumping. Shout out to the last chapter that has a mandatory jumping puzzle that instakils you if you fail. 
Lastly, start of your run often depends on you (randomly) getting some skills that really seem like they should be by default, like a skill to parry ranged attacks, or not having your wands explode when you run out of ammo. If you are unlucky and never get them, the game will feel turbo clunky.
Overall, its much easier to criticise than to praise, and i want to repeat that the game is very good, and most of those problems are blemishes on one of the better dungeon crawlers i played in a good while.

Personally though, the switch from that sweet feeling of discovery to ""Oh, ok now it's time to put in 50 more hours if I want to beat this game"" was remarkably quick. There isn't a lot that goes into this, but I still feel like it's missing something. Some extra spice, like unlocks or a more tangible way to see progress; or just more persistent buffs would've helped immensely. Leveling up is all fine and dandy but it doesn't soften the blow when I lose a quarter of those every time I get knocked off the tree and hit every branch on the way down.

I do appreciate the dormroom-style vibe of the graphics, but ultimately I can't contend with the grind this game is asking for. Repeatedly grinding levels to upgrade wimpy perks into cumulatively slightly less wimpy perks just doesn't do it for me. I mostly feel sorry for the main character here, he got stuck in the most prodigious, state-of-the-art security complex packed floor to floor with deadly monsters and traps that eviscerate healthbars.

[h3] The good [/h3]

A roguelike Dungeon Crawler with lots of action with some puzzles, which is quite challenging regarding skill, have a mysterious story and encourages you to go on exploration without feeling ultra boring.

Nice systems like forge custom gear (even the looks/pieces) and the vault which gives less punishment for dying and varied strategies for enemies.

I felt like LoG (Legends of Grimrock 2), which you should try if you don't know what it is and you agree with me until the end of this review.

[h3] The bad [/h3]

The good experience is true for the first 4 levels. Or the first boss.

[h3] The worse[/h3]

From level 5, the game becomes ultra punishing on normal difficulty with huge balancing issues. First, remember you are not allowed to LOAD GAME or restart from the same floor if you die. You kinda die with 1 or 2 shots from most enemies no matter if you are heavily armoured or not, and there will be obligatory rooms with a lot of ranged characters, and you will simply waste a lot of time for something to go wrong and have to start over.

It not only becomes ultra hard on a bad way in combat, reflexes and decision making, but it becomes a frustrating platforming puzzle game. And no, no matter how many times you will restart or what difficulty setting you put, you have to face the same rooms to make the same jumps on every single run. Which kinda breaks the rogue like part. And no, they could make it a few jumps or optional to get some nice treasure, but nope, it's like 30 obligatory consecutive jumps, with some if you miss ONCE you will end on a spiked huge floor or have to start all over again.

I played until level 5 on normal, then got smashed. Started over on easy and finished it only to see the ending. I don't care bout achievements (disabled on easy mode). Unfortunately the journey from the 5th level and beyond ending is quite lackluster. There are many death pits and traps that feel unfair, which mixed with having to start over from the first floor kinda becomes a boring GRIND quickly.

The bosses are also not good design. Either they are huge chunks of HP or you simply abuse a cheesy bs way (feels like a bug but it's easy to correct) to kill them without any challenge. It felt like all or nothing on that regard.

I also heard some fanboys defending this game with thoughts like ""Changing the type of gaming entirely was needed"" or ""You can close the game because it doesn't save until you click on respawn"", which is kinda strange, because people DON'T like to buy a game expecting a genre and discovering they are playing another completely different AFTER they can't refund anymore. It also points to repetition and boredom. Also, suggesting to CHEESE the game to avoid it's harsh rules kinda proves that the game itself is flawed, doesn't?

Which is a shame, because the game has great ideas and was made by a single person. Maybe that was the breaking point, no matter how talented you are, there is the need to share your ideas with many other point of views, even if it goes against your own.

Art style is great, music is good, general game play mechanics and combat are fun. Enemies and items look cool, the crafting system is pretty decent.

The combat is rewarding to learn and I haven't had many games that make me laugh and get motivated to be better when I die. Even falling into a hole while blocking and moving backwards is a valuable lesson to learn.

It is so fun to explore and the custom weapon crafting is nuts, every game should have that! You can pixel-perfectly customize your weapons VISUALLY and ability wise. Such a lovely idea.

The secrets, the alchemy, the perma unlocks, the graphic and atmosphere is pure nostalgic bliss for me.
And as someone who usually turns of ingame music right away to put my own chill music on, I am pleased to say that the music in this game is top notch and never distracts from whats going on.

The blue quest giver has one of the greatest looping monologues I have ever heard and he sounds like one of the beatles :D

Eating spiders for magic wand charges? Check.
Sexy Orc posters? Check.
""Kicking"" enemies into spikes/abyss? Check.
Different charged attacks and attack patterns? Check.
Jumping puzzles, traps, shops, secrets, keys, chests.... CHECK, CHECK, CHECK!

My only gripe so far is that some things the game wants you to be very exact but it isn't programmed as exact as it wants you to be. As someone who has done all jumping Puzzles in Guild Wars 2 and loving many jumpingpuzzle type games, it is QUITE frustrating when your character decides to not jump, or just fall through one of them plates that extend from the wall. Or when the interactable area of a lever is NOT the bright red handle, but instead where it is mounted on the wall, leading to many frustrating deaths before I found out where I had to ""aim"" to interact. (Come on, you literally made the handle red, dev.)

The combat feels good and fair without being easily exploitable or too easy, the room layouts and enemy AI are dynamic enough to stay fresh over time, the abilities, stats, and equipment all feel impactful and improve at a comfortable pace, and the push attack (which is swinging your bag of loot at the enemy) is super useful and incredibly satisfying to kill enemies with. 

I adore the weapon crafting system and love making a funny face-on-a-stick and then bashing enemies with it. This is a system i deeply wish to see more games expand on.

I also love the way the game handles death and resets - you only lose 25% of your levels and money, and are able to send items back to your future self as you go. Meaning, every character will *eventually* be very powerful over several runs and you're always experiencing a satisfying acceleration of gameplay. 

[b]some minor complaints:[/b]
- i wish i could jump over waist-high fences and boxes. this especially annoying when enemies push a box into the only path and my only option is to just walk into it at different angles until it moves. it's still kind of fun when this happens though because it creates some weird and unusual situations with enemy positioning

- i wish i could crouch. honestly i think every first person game should have a crouch even if it doesn't provide any practical value. it's just super weird feeling like i don't have knees. this /can/ contribute to a retro game feel and is tolerable when a game never gives you a reason to crouch, but this game puts lots of things on shelves at shin-height and has enemies shoot projectiles through fence holes that would be cool to crouch under. not a big deal overall. 

- i wish the deflect skill was a default feature. you don't have a real defense against ranged attacks without it, besides 'kill them first'. maybe make it so you can timed-parry projectiles by default and have deflect enable blocking them?

- the minimap is generally pretty hard to read. increasing the negative space between rooms and giving an indication of door direction would go a long way imo

- wands aren't effective enough. they all feel GREAT and look cool - but equip time is too long to use during normal combat, and damage is too low to pick off most enemies from afar. this limits wand use to a few annoying flying enemies and to pulling aggro. could be a skill issue though.

[b]things i like (not a complete list)[/b]
- overall level design makes the most out of few assets. environmental hazards and enemy types, the delightful push attack, and the range of melee strategies between fast and slow weapons and their various power swings/stabs, all combine to create a suprisingly dynamic experience

- only game i've played so far that was super consistent and fair with the aimed-parries thing. it feels great to skill your way through being cornered by four enemies. most dungeon crawley games in this genre are more than content to just kill you and say better luck next time when you mess up or the game decides to mean to you about enemy spacing/positioning.

- the weapon crafting system is such a treat. i need more of this

- the progression system is a welcome change of pace from the full resets of other games in the genre. most of these are either way too easy or way too hard, and it's difficult to keep slogging through the hard ones when you don't make much progress. Slasher's Keep goes fully in the opposite direction, [i]arguably not punishing you enough[/i] for dying, giving you a lot of meaningful choices about what to send down the chute for your next run and when to take risks, and guaranteeing a satisfying sense of progression and empowerment without getting too easy at any point.

- the Permalearn system is a fun one. every 2 levels you get a 'permalearn' point, allowing you to take any of the perks you've acquired so far (randomly every other level, and from equipped items) and learn 1 level of that perk forever. You could decide that you like the way this mace gives you fiery attacks, and gain fiery attacks **forever**. or maybe you want to refill your wands when you eat spiders? the dungeon is your oyster. there's lots of perks to choose from and permalearning skills makes it feel like every character is a multi-run project

- the shop keeper is easily top 5 in videogames for me. what a lovable dude. 

- and more(tm) i like this game. play it if you like first-person dungeon crawlers.",1688417103,1688417103,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,True,,,

Version 1.36 時点

一人称視点+近接攻撃でダンジョンを探索するアクションゲーム。
ダンジョンマスター、キングスフィールド、シャドウタワーなどが好きな人にはお勧め。
ただ、上にあげたようなゲームのように若干もっさりとしていて独特な操作感なので人を選ぶ感じ。
キャラクターが素直に動いてくれないから難しいタイプのアクション。

アクションは、シンプルで分かりやすいが、独特で簡単とは言い難い部分がある。
武器の振りが遅くて防御が間に合わなかったり、攻撃の当たり判定が良く分からないでミスしたり、パリィの条件が分からなくて被弾したりする事がある。
まあ、システムを理解できていないだけかもしれないが。
敵が一撃で倒せない場合、こちらが先手を取ると防御が間に合わずに被弾してしまう事が多くしっかりパリィしてから攻撃した方が無難。
こんな感じで、全体的にスローペースなゲーム。

システムになれるまでとキャラクターが強くなるまでは死にまくる。
始めに階層で死にまくりました。
死ぬとレベルが下がり、装備を全て失い、お金が減る
しかし、ポイントを割り振って覚えたスキルは忘れなかったり、アイテムシュートに入れた装備は消えなかったりするので徐々に強くなるシステム。
強くなるまで時間が掛かるので上手くないと辛いけれど。
また、クリア後のダンジョンは、難易度が上がって油断できなかったりと、強くなったら楽過ぎて緊張感が無くなる事もない。
敵がどこまで強くなるかは分からないが。
そして、クリア後のダンジョンで死んでしまうと、敵が強すぎて全く立て直せなくなるけど。

スキルは、装備に付いているかレベルアップ時にランダムで覚えられる。
ただ、こうやって覚えたスキルは、装備を外したり死んだりすると忘れてしまう。
しかし、レベルアップ時に得られるスキルポイントを振ると永続的に使えるようになる。
また、スキルポイントはスキルのレベルを上げるのにも使える。
スキルが実用的になるにはある程度のレベルが必要なため、レベルを上げるのを優先するか新しいスキルを覚えるか悩むことになる。

キャラクターは、はじめから1つだけスキルを持っている。
これは作成時にランダムで決まるみたい。
そしてこのスキルは、後から覚えられないようなのである程度吟味した方が良いかもしれない。

2層目以降に現れるアイテムシュートに入れた装備は、次の周回で使うことが出来る。
レベルが上がると、落ちるアイテムの質も良くなるようでいつかはクリアできる感じ。
落ちている装備には、ランダムでスキルが付いていたりボーナスが付いているものがある。
そのため、アイテムを集めるハクスラ的要素もある。

慣れないうちは、HP回復手段が乏しくて難しいと思うかもしれない。
しかし、アビリティなどで改善する事が出来るし、それ以外の回復手段はそれなりに豊富にある。
回復薬や、テーブルの上にある肉などで回復することが出来る。
そして、ダンジョン内の所々に居る虫を食べる事でも回復出来る。
こういうノリが好きな人にもお勧め。

敵は、決まった数しかいない。
そのため、経験値稼ぎのような事は出来ない。
ただ、一定時間内に敵を殺すとキルストリークとなり獲得経験値を増やすことが出来る。
細かい探索を後回しにして敵を殺しまわった方が、経験値効率は良い。
タイムアタックなどに向いているシステムかもしれない。

足場が消える所をジャンプして渡らなければいけない箇所がある。
死んで繰り返すゲームでこれはとても面倒。
これだけで、低評価にしたいぐらい。
ただ、多ボタンマウスやゲームパッドを使えばそんなに難しくはないと思う。
最後の最後に、ジャンプを失敗すると死亡する所がある。
自分は、3回中2回失敗して死亡した。
どうしてこんな所に配置するのか。

(一回クリアすると?)、開始時にダンジョンの階層数を指定できる。
そのため、思う存分、キャラクターを強くしたり、強い装備を作れる。
もっとも、1回クリアするのに時間が掛かったのとアンロックなどもあり無限階などに挑戦する気になるかは分からない。

# 操作

左クリック: 攻撃
右クリック: 防御
F: アイテム袋によるスタン+ノックバック(ダメージなし)
Shift: 走る
Space: ジャンプ
X: 武器を構える
C: 魔法の杖を構える
Q: 武器と杖の切り替え
1-8: アイテムショートカット
B: アビリティ画面を開く
Tab: 装備画面を開く

攻撃は、通常攻撃と溜め攻撃がある。
溜め攻撃は、3倍ぐらいの威力だが隙が大きい。
溜め攻撃は、方向キーを押しながら溜めると横振りや突きなどが出せる。
モーションによる違いは、ダメージや射程が変わるようだがよくわからない。
パリィしてくる敵が居るので適切に出すとパリィを防ぐ事が出来るのかもしれない。
少なくとも、対応するスキルがあると威力などが変わる。
敵の顔に攻撃を当てるとダメージが増える。
また、条件が良く分からないけどスニークボーナスもある。

防御は、ボタンを押しっぱなしにして敵の攻撃を正面にとらえると出来る。
防御をしっかりして戦うと、殺陣をしている感じがして好き。
シャドウタワーよりかは、戦っている感じがするかも。

スタミナの類は無いので、攻撃はずっと出していられるし、制限なく走ることが出来る。

アイテム袋による攻撃で敵をノックバックさせ、フィールド上になる棘や穴へ吹き飛ばすと即死させる事が出来る。
また、スタンさせて敵の攻撃を中断させる事も出来る。
ちなみに、敵を穴に落として殺してもアイテムはしっかり取れる。
シャドウタワーだったか、レアアイテムが奈落に落ちて泣きを見るなんて事はないので安心です。

魔法の杖で遠距離攻撃が出来る。
ただ、杖のチャージ回数分しか攻撃できないので連発は出来ない。
スキルを強化していくと、回数を増やせたり、回復させたり出来るようになる。

# 基本能力

- Strength: 攻撃力とHP
- Agility: クリティカル率とアーマー
- Intelligence: クリティカルダメージ、魔法の杖のダメージ、アイテムの値段、経験値
に影響する。

また、防具を装備することで
- Armour
が上昇する。

レベルアップ時に、4ポイント貰え好きに割り振れる。
クエストを達成することでもポイントが貰える事がある。
しかし、クエストは、クエスト自体が無かったり、達成条件が難しくて達成できなかったりでなかなか難しい。

 # 装備

装備は、
- Helmet
- Shoulder Armour
- Chest Armour
- Glove
- Leg Armour
- Boots
- Amulet
- Ring
- Weapon
- Wand
と装備箇所が豊富。
盾が無いのがさみしいけど。
装備画面が主だが見た目にも反映される。

武器には、
- Short Sword
- Long Sword
- Axe
- Mace
の種類があり、射程・振りの速さ・威力が違う。
特定の種類にしか影響しないスキルもある。

インベントリは、アイテムの大きさによって占有率が変わるタイプ。
容量は、あまり大きくない。
もう少し多いとより好みだった。
斧やメイスは、ショートソードの3倍ほど容量を取るがその利点が無いのが残念。
まあ、大きいアイテムにメリットがあるゲームをやった覚えがないけど。

武器は、特定の場所で作成する事が出来る。
必須のパーツ2つと追加の2～4個のパーツで作る。
パーツをどこに付けるか見た目をこだわる事が出来る。

残念ながら3D酔いしやすい人には向かない。
ただ、視野角(Field of View)を調整出来たり、歩行時の揺れをなくす等のオプションはある。

ちなみに始めは牢屋の中からスタートする。
どうやって抜け出したら良いか迷ったが、仕組みが分かれば突っ込みを入れたくなるようなオチ。
シャドウタワーなので初めに後ろに下がると死ぬのと同じようなノリを感じる。
さらに余談だが、セーブのアイコンがフロッピーなので古いゲームを意識しているのかもしれない。

成人向け要素があるとなっているが、女性キャラの初期装備が下着姿だったり(日本人好みではないと思うし、装備画面でしか見えない)、
オークかゴブリンのグラビアポスターが所々に張ってあったりする感じ。ｳﾋｮ-
また、首が切れるゴア表現もあり。

正式リリース後に買ったのですが、ゲームを終了すると高頻度でクラッシュするというバグがあります。
実害はないようですが気になります。

危険な罠を避け、モンスターを撃破しながら牢獄からの脱出を目指す。

アクションは非常にシンプルというかオールドスクールな造りで、WASD移動とダッシュ/ジャンプくらいしかない。戦闘は近接がメインとなるが、魔法のワンドを銃っぽく使って戦うこともできる。キックの代わりに荷物袋での殴打が可能で、敵を突き飛ばして落下させたり壁面スパイクに突き刺して敵を即死させ、周囲の環境を利用して戦うことも可能。

階層が進むにつれて敵の強さが大幅にアップし、防御力が弱いとワンミスで死亡することもあるため、道中での装備強化が必須。装備はランダムドロップなので、アクションの腕前もさることながら引きの強さもゲームの進行を左右する。死ぬとスタート地点に連れ戻されステータスに少しペナルティがあるが、装備品は死ぬ前にマップ上にあるダストシュートに入れておけば、リスタート時に宝箱から取り出して持っていくことが可能になっている。進行状況によっては無理に進めて装備を全てを失うよりも、強い装備品をダストシュートに入れて早々に撤退(死亡)するのが吉なケースも多い。強力な武器を装備しているが防具が弱い時などは、進むか退くか悩みどころ。

中盤から消える足場の連続ジャンプが必要だったり（落下ダメージが無いのが救い）、敵や罠の配置が異様にいじわるな時がある（マップが自動生成なため簡単な時もある）、良い装備品が出ない時がある等、誰でもすぐ簡単にクリアできるように作られていない。繰り返しプレイして、遊び方や有利な進め方を覚えていく必要があり、見た目のゆるさに反してしっかりとした攻略が必要な難易度になっている。ステージクリアごとに表示される「プレイヤーが投獄されるまでのストーリー」もアートスタイルと裏腹にダークな内容。

自分は２周したら飽きてしまい、パーマデスモードや大きな規模のダンジョンに挑戦する気はおきなかったが、値段分以上に楽しませてもらった。ちょっと歯ごたえのあるローグライトを探していて、アクションの得意な人におすすめ。",1681205935,1681205935,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

STILL JANKY
It's a pretty cool first person dungeon crawl adventure roguelite, with a neat inheritance mechanic for skills and some items.  Also has a simple but kinda neat weapon building mechanic.
Attacking is either melee or zapping with wands.  Though, you could shoot magic out your weapon if you have the right skill.
There are over 60 different skills that I can find in wiki's, but there are more.  Many are very fun, and I think you can get them all over time.  

I got 14 crash errors from what might be every time I quit the game.
Item overlap will hide things, but if you keep an eye on your map at least you will find the important items.

The most annoying thing I found was the platform jumping you end up being forced to do (eventually).

I had read a review on here giving the game a negative rating because the guy had died from slipping on a severed head after buying expensive gear from a well-dressed mole person, so I immediately proceeded to purchase and download. In conclusion, as indie rogue-lites go, Slasher's Keep is pretty gd good, especially considering that the game is first-person and has a great aesthetic. And yep, you  can even get lots of merry lols from the good old slip n' trip on some severed heads. It's also refreshing to see a game that treats the mole-people as *people*; they *do* have fantastic sartorial sensibilities, as well as a polite demeanour and reasonable prices.

Extremely unique art style (these days) that makes the entire concept work better, and fixes a lot of the problems first person games like this have. Because the 2D models move like its the OG Doom, blocking attacks and responding with your own is extremely fluid and fun, and everything feels fair. Attacks that should miss generally miss, attacks that should hit generally hit (which is a disappointingly HUGE issue in other games), the magic is interesting and satisfying. 

My only complaint is the huge difficulty curve. Unless you have king luck, you are generally not kitted enough to clear bosses, ever. I can only compare this to other dungeon crawler roguelikes (and I do ackowledge that I'm low level and low play time, much of the game is balanced around player level), so I look to games such as Pixel Dungeon and Brogue for the answer. Having randomized loot allows for the 1% and 0.1% drops that would allow the player to obtain equipment/weapons suitable for actually dealing with bosses in a timely manner. An enchantment system to complement the forge system would also be helpful (enchantments are entirely non-permanent, cannot be carried between runs, but are subsequently more common and more varied, and perhaps could stack with one another).

However, that said, the game is coming along nicely. Well worth the purchase, it looks like and plays like exactly what you'd expect from the advertising.

...Until you hit the first boss, the skill ceiling skyrockets and your enjoyment plummets. You die without touching its health bar because it has really vague hit-boxes so getting close enough to strike is suicide (you have wands but they are ***), you have to start all over losing most of your weapons and experience, and you suddenly realize you are playing another grind-fest disguised as a dungeon crawler.

I also couldn't figure out the save-system for the life of me: there is one on every floor that I assumed meant I could save my progress, turn the game off and go run an errand, but when I booted the game back up to continue it dropped me back on the first floor(?)

I suppose the closest comparison would be Heavy Bullets, another BS shooter with a procedural-generated feel (all the rooms are cells that get rearranged like a slide puzzle each run.) The jumping mechanic is also floaty and super inaccurate; there are several areas where precision leaping is required to access secrets and it's a total crap-shoot whether you a) barely make the jump, b) almost make the jump but fall off the lip even though you did everything right, or c) don't jump in time and fall off the starting ledge like a total putz.

Can't in good conscience recommend a game with such a harsh and obvious difficulty spike at the first boss. Honest question: are we about done with bosses in first person shooters? This isn't 1995. Give me an arena with a swarm of enemies from all sides, or better yet, a quick-time event. I mean, all games are is just mashing buttons anyway.

И чисто технически, все так и есть... Все, кроме ожидаемого фана от игры

Дело в том что атмосфера трейлера держится эдак до этажа третьего. А дальше Slasher's Keep из проекта явно вдохновленного Dark Messiah с добавлением своих идей и фишек, резко превращается в TES IV Oblivion

Но если увидев название Oblivion Вам в голову пришла хорошая сторона IV свитков с их размахом, обилием квестов, персонажей и множества локаций

То нет, начинайте ловить вьетнамские флешбеки темной стороны TES IV, где выходя с гоблином шаманом раз на раз уровне так на 60-70, будучи одетым в лучше снаряжение из возможного, сражение превращается в долгий и изнурительный бой - марафон, по продолжительности сопоставимый с групповыми рейдами на мировых боссов в какой нибудь MMORPG 

К сожалению Slasher's Keep, не смотря на пеструю, действительно красивую обертку на деле оказывается игрой про превозмогания, духоту, однообразие и что самое паршивое - про уныние, а начинания с второго биома, ещё и про eбаные прыжки и тайминги. Чем дольше играешь Slasher's Keep, чем острее чувствуются её недостатки, абсолютно ужасный баланс и уeбанские игровые решения

Первой начинает сыпаться сама концепция арен, если в той же Dark Messiah, они были хорошо режиссированы и дополнялись смекалкой и фантазией игрока, то тут они генерируются случайно по ассетам, и не всегда эти генерации удачны

Локации тесные и часто перегруженные кучей препятствий и не разрушаемых объектов, что путаются под ногами и мешают движению как Вам, так и тупым болванчикам, что в них регулярно будут застревать

Частенько можно видеть, как какой нибудь моб завидев Вас включает все свои лошадиные силы и пытается добраться до Вас тараня какой нибудь стеллаж и большой кухонный стол в придачу, роняя с них всю стоящую кухонную утварь, медленно но верно толкая все эти вещи Вам на встречу

Или какой нибудь крот или зомби запутался в паутине и смотря на Вас жалобными глазами ожидают расправы над собой

К тому же у игры странное видение подвижности и возможности ГГ, герой может легко запрыгивать на ящики и на столы со стульями, но по не понятной причине не в состоянии перепрыгнуть перила, которые тут встречаются удивительно часто и тем самым срезают не мало мобильности и довольно часто могут оказаться причиной вашего окружения. Тем более что большую часть комнат - арен покинуть не выйдет, пока Вы победите всех врагов внутри

Не все гладко и с боевой системой, она простенькая, но в тоже время интересная, однако перестающая работать если Вам приходиться сражаться более чем с одни противником

Slasher's Keep так же пытается быть и рогаликом, но делает он это тоже не очень удачно

Тут Вам не интересных билдов, ни разнообразия, хоть враги и лут случайны, как и характеристики лута, по сути все сводиться лишь к набору по большей части мусорных статов и пассивных навыков от этажа к этажу, но какого либо опыта от уникального забега, потому как выпало особое оружие или уникальный предмет в корне меняющего геймплей тут нет и в помине

Арсенал холодного оружия, состоящий из 4 типов тоже разочаровывает. Из-за раздутости ХП врагов, использовать легкие атаки почти нет смысла в виду их нищего урона, а силовые атаки молотов и топоров заряжаются слишком медленно и в тесных помещениях, где происходит большая часть сражений не всегда получиться отступить для хорошего замаха, кинжалы быстры, однако их базовый урон сам по себе самый низкий в игре, поэтому единственный тип оружия который имеет смысл использовать - это мечи в виду их сбалансированности

Как в какой нибудь ARPG / RPG в игре так же присутствуют требования к характеристикам персонажа, так что если Бох рандома пошлет Вам хорошую броню или оружие, не факт что Вы сможете их использовать в виду недостаточной прокачки одной из трех представленных характеристик в игре. А новое, хорошее снаряжение имеет критически важное значение, потому как кривая сложности в игре аховая и остро ощущается с каждым новым этажом, поэтому жизненно важно обзавестись максимально лучшим снаряжением из возможного

Но что примечательно из-за общей уебанской концепции баланса, все требования к характеристикам сходят на нет, если Вы к примеру осилив игру решите сыграть на 30 этажном данжеоне, потому как в игре есть зелья перманентного буста характеристик, которые в стандартной компании дают от 1 до 3 единиц статов, а вот на 30-60 уровненном забеге сходят с ума как враги и другие параметры игры, бустя Вашего персонажа сразу 40 или даже 60 очков статов

Превращая прокачку в раздувание трупа игрового баланса

Впрочем уже начиная начиная с 4-ого этажа обычной компании, игра превращается в тот самый TES IV с почти не пробиваемыми врагами, которые в свою очередь наносят по Вашему персонажу весьма впечатляющий урон

В этот момент увы приходит осознание, что точеные пики и пропасти которые есть почти в каждой комнате, там присутствуют не для того чтобы Вам было весело на них сажать врагов, а скорее потому что использование окружения порой единственный способ этих врагов в принципе избавиться, так как силы оружия становиться просто недостаточно

Доходит до такого что оружие в руках начинает воспринимается скорее как палка - талисман, содержащая пассивные абилки для персонажа, нежели средство устранение врагов

Разумеется при таком раскладе не мудрено словить от здешних обитателей - ваншот, но не переживайте смерть в Slasher's Keep - это часть гринда и прогресса. Погибнув в бою Ваш персонаж отправиться обратно в свою камеру на первом этаже, с потерей всего надетого снаряжения и содержимого сумки, а так же с денежным пенальти, однако у Вас останется часть прокаченных статов и навыков

К тому же блуждая по коридорам Slasher's Keep Вы будете время от времени натыкаться на мусоропроводы и именно в них Вам следует скидывать оружие и броню которые Вы переросли, потому как все что Вы туда отправите, в последствии окажется внутри стартового сундука возле Вашей камеры

Таким образом, вероятность удачи Вашей следующей попытке зависит исключительно от Вашей запасливости и осмотрительности

Причем эта гринд концепция сохраняется даже в режиме с одной жизнью, с той лишь разницей, что рестарт будет происходить не в результате смерти (она приводит к окончательному проигрышу), а через специальные сброс - люки которые появляются только в хардкорном режиме

Однако эта игра не была бы настолько уeбанской, если бы мобов нужно было бы просто перерасти. Дело в том что в игре присутствует некий автолевелинг, который все равно будет подтягивать врагов немного вверх, поэтому подымаясь по башне во второй или даже третий раз, все равно можно встретить ощутимое сопротивление со стороны мобов

Если бы не этот гринд, стандартная компания пролеталась бы за час – полтора

В игре впрочем есть есть и положительные моменты 

В отличие от самого игрового процесса тут на удивление и хорошо сделаны два босса, которые побеждаются не очевидным способом

В игре ОЧЕНЬ крутая кузница позволяющая собрать диковинную вундервавлю с собственным дизайном

В игре большое разнообразие артов оружия и брони, а так же несколько рас разблокируемых при определенных условиях во время прохождении компании, а ещё тут можно ловить и есть тараканов, опарышей и даже пауков

В остальном Slasher's Keep скорее увы разочаровывает и не дарит никакого удовольствия от скитания по своим коридорам и сражениям с её обитателями, нет так же никакого фана от фарминга снаряги получше, при условии конечно, что Вы не начнете игру в EASY MODE, в нем все это есть

Однако разработчик не хочет чтобы Вы получали Фан, он хочет Вас душить, поэтому ачив и прочих наград за игру в этом режиме Вы не получите

Theres a save system in place and a way to pass items back to your next run, so theres a choice of which items you keep for your current run and which you drop down for the next.

There is an Easy Mode and a Permadeath Mode which deletes your character upon death.
You can find secrets and quests (however the quest sysem is super simplistic).

1) Movement. The character moves like molasses. There is a sprint key for forward movement, which is handy in particular situations, but backward movement is deliberately slowed to prevent you from back-stepping out of enemy melee attacks and so that you engage with the game's parry system. It's a poor method of requiring the system's use, as this could have allowed for something like dexterity to increase movement speed, allowing variety in playstyle. In addition, the character easily gets hung up on terrain, small stair lips, and so forth. This oversight led to several frustrating deaths which should not have occurred.
2) Combat. It's generally a left-click spam, then right-click directional parry to block or prevent damage. Attacking an enemy's face usually results in higher damage. It works fine up to level 2, assuming you have a reasonably decent weapon. However, combat becomes a slog by level 3 as you fight recycled enemies but with higher damage and health. Ranged combat with wands is utter garbage, as most wands have insanely slow projectiles and low damage output. In addition, wands require the use of certain potions to recharge them, thus taking up more precious inventory space.
3) Upgrades / level up. You have three stats - STR, DEX, INT - which are clearly marked with tooltips as to their effects. Simple, but serviceable. You'll gain a skill point for purchasing perks / skills each level as well, but which ones you have access to are provided by what equipment you've managed to pick up. If you've had poor luck then you will have either terrible or no skills. The skills that are available provide arguably useless abilities, like 7.1% chance to deal X fire damage, or an increase of 4.0% damage during a killstreak.
4) Death. Characters are persistent, but upon death you lose a portion of your levels, stats, gold, and any items in your inventory. There are chutes you can use to drop equipment for beefing later runs. Unfortunately, due to the tedious grind the game wishes you to perform, your best bet is always dumping the best gear you can find at a chute, going back and killing every monster, rinse and repeat ad nauseum.

[h1] Úvod [/h1]
Musím se přiznat, že mi trvalo najít si k této hře cestu, avšak po několika strávených hodinách, ve kterých jsem pochopil, že budu umírat (HODNĚ), jsem zjistil spoustu věcí. Momentálně na tom nemám nahráno tolik, takže hodnotím 5 prvních levelů, ale už ty mi dokázaly, že tohle je úplně jiný rogue-lite, než na který jsem zvyklý.

[h1] First person a combat [/h1]
First person zde funguje ruku v ruce s combatem, ve kterém opravdu záleží, kam se zrovna díváte, když vykrýváte útok. Dále můžete při combatu ovládat i směr švihu, či jestli nemá další útok být výpad. Každá zbraň má pochopitelně jinou nabídku útoků (se sekerou se výpad dělá těžko), a tak přijdou momenty, kdy se budete muset rozhodnout, zda chcete rychlé švihání upřednostnit před drtivými údery obrovským kladivem. Mimo svou hlavní zbraň a kouzelnou hůlku, která funguje jako vaše zbraň na dálku, můžete použít i svůj inventář. Ano, prostě můžete toho šmejda před váma přetáhnout svým naplněným inventářem a poslat ho tak přímo do ostnaté zdi nebo dolů do propasti.

[h1] Nějaká ta pomoc vašemu budoucímu já [/h1]
Je zde mechanika, která vám dává možnost si nějaký ten gear ""poslat"" do dalšího runu v případě, že umřete, a protože určitě budete ze začátku umírat, dost to ulehčí další průchod. Samozřejmě nebudete do té šachty házet to, co zrovna používáte a je vaším hlavním vybavením (pokud tedy nemáte 1 % životů a nejste si 100% jistí, že ta obří divno-moucha vás sundá, už když se na vás podívá), ale nějaké ty věci, které se nevyplatí prodat a zároveň nejsou nějak náročné, co se požadavků na atributy a level týče, se vyplatí prostě do té šachty vašemu budoucímu já hodit.

[h1] Herní smyčka [/h1]
Zmiňuji tu smrt, ale neumíráte v pravém slova smyslu, spíše vás zajmou a vrátí vás do cely, ve které jste začínali. Sebere vám to pár bodů ze základních atribut, vezme vám to všechny perky, které jste se nenaučili permanentně a sníží vám to level – dostatečný trest, avšak ne tak obrovský krok zpátky, aby se herní smyčka stala bolestí a jen frustrujícím grindem.

Enemy variety leaves some room to be desired, you get very tired of seeing the same goblinoid fellows over and over again with different colored skin and faintly different patterns of combat. While you gradually increase the viability of your equipment, it is not remotely enough to outpace the dungeon's level of rapid damage increment, enemies in later floors will be 3-4 shotting you even with a very well put together set of equipment that you spent time collecting, and your weapons start to feel like they're doing chip damage against enemies which you had been effortlessly decapitating one floor ago.

There is a major problem with progression, in that the game progresses too fast, and you will rapidly find yourself falling behind the times. This is, in my estimation, due to the way you are defeated (off permadeath mode), in that you retain some skills you had obtained through your previous run, as well as some of your stats, and whatever equipment you managed to spirit away on the above floors. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the initial floors do not tend to out-pace your combat effectiveness, but it is extremely dull. Additionally, enemy combat AI is very beeline oriented, and the cluttered, clumsy, procedurally generated arenas in which you find yourself, make for annoying combat encounters as you find yourself bumping into shin-high boxes which slow you to a crawl as you attempt to reposition around deadlier and deadlier enemies. The result is combat that wants you to think methodically about your plan of attack, but ambushes you with clutter around your feet and face, along with extremely potent traps that seem to violate hitboxes with reckless abandon. Your run can end very quickly at the hands of a goblin with a sword who cheap shots you as you attempt to clamber away, stymied by an inexplicably heavy, yet tiny box, or struck by a deadly energy ball that clipped through the terrain to slap you as you dove for cover.

To exacerbate issues, going through the initial floors is nothing but a chore, and while the menu, final boss, and first floor start with excellent music, the rest of the game is very low key, or ill-fitting in terms of music, to the point where you question where it has gone. This, coupled with the frustrating and grindy gameplay loop, makes for a bothersome experience that stops you very quickly in your tracks as you get the ball rolling, and tells you to hand over a large portion of your progress so you can go back to the beginning and experience power again, before the game repeats itself.",1659922818,1659923054,False,12,1,0.627598881721496582,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Additionally, there can be persistence between deaths by using an item chute (maintains special items between runs) and levelling abilities. However, if you're not interested in that, you can play with permadeath enabled, raising the stakes of your run and also improving your skills with the core game mechanics.

I definitely don't feel that enemies are unbeatable as they all have very learnable behaviour, and don't randomly stray away from them (thus far). The weapon swinging does have a bit of learning curve, but once you get into it you can really feel the weight of your actions (especially with heavy weapons), and I like that.

I think this game would have been way better if it weren't a Rogue-lite game. I much prefer games where you don't lose progress when you die, and in this game you not only have your dungeon progress completely reset but you also lose all your items, some gold, some permanent skills and some permanent levels. I don't know why you couldn't just lose some gold and then respawn like regular games? Why does every indie dev in the past 10years have such an infatuation with perma-death? I simply don't enjoy a game where I lose 2hours of progress when I die.... call me weird, but I just don't. People who play Diablo2 on hardcore might, but I don't... and it's why I can't recommend the game. I was juuuust starting to get a nice few pieces of equipment together and then I got kekd. The game is already extremely punishing with the non-regen of health, so why do you ALSO need to lose all progress? Anyway, I'm done.... uninstalling and won't be touching this game again. I actually value my time and can't have 2hours of my life just sent to the shadow realm like that.

The game has nice graphics and visual style, some cool mood and music, but combat, physics, interactions are totally broken and even don't look like a beta, maybe a pre-alpha... namely:
- interactions often fail to execute;
- you can easily get stuck into any dynamic objects on the map;
- you can easily get stuck by an enemy near door (goblin in plate armor);
- combat is boring, dull and not engaging - very slow pacing;
- enemy attack animations are horrible and even my pixel art Unity demos look better;
- game has no dynamic action what-so-ever ;)
- the beginning of the game is very strange, tutorial seems a bit not inline with the surrounding and those keys you can see through the hole in the wall are luring, but you even can't interact with them;
- 'spell / magic system' is strange to use imho,
- the game's difficulty should increase over time imho,
- steep learning curve.

If you enjoy directional combat (to block you have to actually look where you're blocking jnstead of mind-lessly pressing a button), and dungeon-crawler loot grinding, then I'd HIGHLY recommend giving this game a shot. 

I see people complaining about the combat or the parkour areas. Simply GIT GUD (the chute is a mechanic for a reason). And when you go for a run longer than 10-15 floors the parkour rooms become really nice breaks. Almost like safe rooms with a puzzle and items. 

To keep it short, this is a solo dev project. What he has done is made a very unique dungeon crawler-rougelike, with good crafting, art design, and a really fun combat system. Once you get used to it, nothing beats putting a podcast on in the background and losing track of time. 

Even now the dev is somewhat active (an update every few months), making fixes and adding new additions, such as rooms, weapons, and secret liquid combinations. 

MY ONLY COMPLAINT is I want MORE. More weapons, enemies, rooms, etc.... which is more a compliment than anything.

An excellent rogue-lite with a great art style and good sense of humor. The story (told in notes between levels) is intriguing enough to keep going and you keep enough progress (via exp levels and skills) every death to still feel like you're making progress. The movement is somewhat clunky I suppose, but that's kind of the point given the retro approach to the games style. The difficulty curve is very steep, you will die a lot, it can be frustrating, but using chutes (a way of storing items for your next life) and gaining exp/skills you will get stronger every time. It's a rogue-lite, so I dunno how people can complain about starting again after dying. 

Some people complain about controls. There's like 11 keys to remember so I dunno what's up with the complaints. X draw weapon, C draw wand, WASD move, shift sprint, space jump, tab open inventory/character sheet, LMB strike (use WASD to change strike type and hold for power), RMB block (aim at incoming strike to block better) or aim with wand; it's easy really. Hover over items in inventory with your cursor and press a number key to assign a hotkey. Seriously, it takes two brain cells to figure out. 

There's Lots of items, skills, and even weapon crafting. 

You can push enemies (even chain pushing by hitting them into each other) into spikes like M&M Dark Messiah; you can light oil spills on fire, you can lure enemies into traps, break platforms of crates into them, etc. etc. It's good fun.

If you don't mind dying a lot, like rogue-lites, and like quirky tongue-in-cheek style games, then you'll almost certainly like this. It's really a hidden gem with a lot more depth to it then you'd expect.

[b]Movement:[/b]
• All movements is to floaty, slow, and uncomfortable.
• Jump is to low and useless. Player can jump over the pit, but can't jump over the fence - why?
• Moreover, the player gets stuck on every little object like a stool, pot, head, and other junk - again, why?

[b]Combat:[/b]
• The range of the player's attack is less than that of the enemy, and I didn't notice an increase in reach when using a larger weapon. They all the same = lame.
• Every mob has a huge reach ( over their visuals ) and bad attack frames -> at least fix the reach pzl.
• Player attacks can miss at point-blank range - reference to the X-COM or laggy hitboxes?
• Or sometimes game just ignores my inputs like jump, attack, and block -> fix the state machine plz.
• Block/Parry is too floaty, again. Despites that block/parry activates on mouse click, this animation don't give me enough visual information -> fix: sharp and fast parry with little overreach animation ( about 0.45-0.75 sec. ), then to the block position = two clear visual sections.
• Sack attack = suck -> fix: make it chargeble to smack mobs harder and cast them further. Addational: at max charge mobs can hit and push aside other mobs. If they hit walls - they stanned for a few seconds, if they hit fence - they fly over = Sack attack now doesn't suck.

[b]Misc:[/b]
I really don't like hidden mobs scaling: the best weapon from the first floor is a toothpick on the second! Thats to fast, besides mobs even don't change visualy, they just got more health and attack power = to lazzy :\
But fix for that leads to rework of all power scaling system. Good example -> ""Beneath"" mode from the Paint the town red: mobs have static stats, visual power scaling, various strong and weak points.

Come on devs, you at least played the Void Bastards - jump must be higher, animations - sharper with a better ""hit"", movements more responsive, weapons must have different reach, mobs must have way less reach and have visual differences in power lvl.

After the Void Bastards and Paint the town red - to slow, uncomfortable, and boring. But, it can be fixed pretty easily for the most parts.",1651928213,1651928213,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's plenty of mechanics that interact to allow you to grow stronger, and overall it's not particularly demanding at the lower levels.

The melee system is functional and doesn't overstay its welcome. You hit with a click and can hold for a stronger attack. Enemies will swing at you on a particular interval for what they are, and you can parry them with a right click. Later on this will do more damage and become very very useful. For now it's just nice to avoid the loss of health. 

Weapons swing faster based on what they are, and it overall makes sense. Daggers are quick and low damage, Maces and hammers are slow and high damage. Everything else sits on a spectrum between them. There seems to be knockback and stagger mechanics based on what the enemy is hit with, but it's inconsistent and easy to miss.

You can dodge attacks and traps with movement, so once you have decent gear you can sprint through the first level with a heavy melee strike and chain kill everything you find, and simply step around enemy strikes.

The problems start when you reach more complex rooms. Most of the time you're just in a hallway or square room with maybe a pillar or two to dodge and fight around. Some rooms though feature stairs, fences, loose boxes, furniture, and traps. It's very easy to lose track of the enemy you swung at because they clipped to a higher position due to loose boxes and furniture moving around.

Because Slashers Keep uses a Doom styled 2d sprite system, most enemy models are just a flat sprite that faces you at all times. This means that if they clip to a higher or lower position than standard, they can become very difficult to shoot at, block, or attack in melee.

This isn't a problem in the first rooms, but once boxes and shelves fall over and create more complex and difficult terrain, it rapidly can turn an easy 1v2 fight into an unmanageable mess. This could just be a skill issue.

I've lost many strong characters and runs to a zombie that managed to climb several boxes and continue to hit me from what feels like way to far up for a standing character model to strike at.

The wand system is alright, but I haven't interacted with it nearly as much as the melee. The wands function more like firearms than anything, with an ammo system that is tracked for each individual wand you pick up. There's different varieties that act like sidearms, shotguns, snipers, filling their combat role in a satisfying fashion. However, your melee damage will almost certainly outpace the wands damage immediately, and with the extremely low ammo and inventory space keeping your wands topped up with ammo will be a serious challenge, as will killing anything without needing to reload at least once. It reminds me of bloodborne, where your ranged option isn't meant to deal damage, but is utility for opening up more options in a fight. The problem is that wands here don't seem to do anything aside from deal direct damage. If they staggered enemies then it might be different, but it feels like you're spending a lot of ammo, inventory space for the ammo, and time better spent with your melee, all so you can deal a bit of damage to ranged enemies.

On top of all that, wands disappear when empty and there's no way to recover them. A skill you can acquire early on will prevent them from vanishing, so you can in theory reload them and continue to use them later. You aren't told this skill exists until you encounter it, and it feels like a mandatory skill to even engage with wand combat beyond firing what drops and then returning to melee. Again, ammo will still be an issue, but at least you can hold onto wands that you like, to reload and keep using.

Now, I've mentioned skills a few times, so I'll go into them now. You acquire skills by picking up gear that has them. Early on you'll find simple ones like Melee Life Steal on a sword. This gives a microscopic amount of life steal, but it'll help keep you alive long enough to keep climbing.

The real skill system appears once you have a skill point, which you get every few or every other level. Not sure which. A skill point allows you to take a currently active skill, whether from gear or from having bought a level in it before, and make that one level Permanent. In the melee life steal example, this means you could now drop the weapon and continue to have the small life steal amount with other weapons, and buy more levels of life steal in the future. This is nice because you can essentially find what skills you like, and if you value it enough, buy a permanent level to keep it in other runs. Early on you'll basically be deciding what you want to get permanent levels of from the first few floors. 

I really enjoy the skill system, since it means you get a sense of exploration and wonder when you find a new weapon or armor piece that has a skill you haven't seen before. The fact that it has some permanent progression is nice too, but your mileage may vary on if that's a good thing in the roguelike/lite environment.

Based on the character backstory you chose, you gain a single skill that you can't get any other way. You can't gain levels in the skill either, so it starts as powerful as it will ever get. It could color every run with that character, but they haven't felt that distinctive so far.

An early character, The Prince, starts off with more damage on sneak attacks. Without this skill existing, I wouldn't even know sneak attacks are a thing, since there's no indication of stealth or sneaking being mechanics. A pass of them, or some early skills that make them obvious, such as the eye from Elder Scrolls, might be in order. Crouching to see vision cones could be a good implementation.

Alongside the skill system is the chutes and crafting. Any floor above the starting floor has a drop chute that allows you to send items back down. The purpose of this is to save valuable items for your next run to pick up and use. Most often this means sending down a good weapon and some armor so your next try has an easier first few floors. The best use early on, is to help crafting. You will occasionally find components as loot. These are clearly labeled. There's hilts, blades, axe heads, crossguards, gems, enchantments, and anything you could think of. These can be combined, up to four at a time, to create custom weapons that will hopefully be stronger and more useful than anything you've found. 

Components take up valuable inventory space, and dying with them means they're gone for good. So you might spend a few runs trying to collect components for one very nice weapon, only to craft it and die immediately. Or, you craft it, send it down to pick up next run, and perpetually live in fear of losing it, so you keep sending it down at the second or third floor, never using it to push further up. This is probably just me, since I play like a rat. Currently the crafting system stops at melee weapons, but you can add enchantments and upgrades to wands as well, just not make any from scratch.

Occasionally you'll find empty bottles. These are very useful, since they are the only way to interact with Alchemy. To use Alchemy you take the empty bottle in your inventory, and combine two other consumables into it. This could be ammo for wands, health potions, bombs, and stat upgrades. Some results of alchemy are extremely useful, others are novelties. These aren't random, so finding powerful combinations that grant skill levels you want is a priority.

There's also a random shop from the second level onwards.

Using your crafted weapons, powerful enchanted wands, gear, farmed skills, and hopefully honed experience you'll push to the first boss. That's where I've ended my runs so far, since I'm not experienced enough yet to push past it. By grinding my skills and gear I'll eventually kill it, but for now I want to really explore the lower floors and see what I might have missed.",1644695836,1644695836,True,15,1,0.672073662281036377,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While the visuals may easily be a turn off for some people, it's worth mentioning to anyone unsure that the graphics actually support the game (And allow a certain crafting mechanic to be more effective) more than feel like a easy out for the developer.

However the game does have issues here and there, namely with hitboxes and variety (hitboxes are really silly at times, and once you've done three or four runs through the first tileset youll have experienced just about every version of every room and it no longer feels unique as it does a chore), but issues do arise in other places too. Like the player's jump feels like 10% too short, and some rooms are way too tight for what they send up against you (There are mages that can place buffs on normal mobs so you have to target them first, but it can be in a situation where you can't get past or out dps the mobs so you get stuck in a stalemate that ends you run through no fault of your own) and in addition to that the system that gives it the roguelite-ness isn't really optimally designed meaning that your runs can often feel completely wasted because you gained basically nothing in the grand scheme of things simply because one of the previous issues took you out before you made it to one of the 'pass onto the next run' chutes with an upgrade to pass on.

So, an absolutely solid base for the future, and plenty of fun on its own, but with a dire need to change some things.",1643636148,1643640311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Progression is fought tooth-and-nail for, and the addition of the item chute makes coming back from where the game last kicked your balls in less of a pain if you use it effectively.

Some things I think the game could use:
- Modding tools, however, this is a pipe dream. Damian has stated that he's not even sure if it's possible.
- Anti-grind. Of any kind. Please. Something like starting on later floors if you beat them enough times or decreasing the chance that an item has a skill you've already gained before or... _something._
- In-game clarity on how to unlock the other characters. The Jellyman is esoteric at best and [strike]I haven't even seen the shrine you're supposed to unlock the Demon with. (Am I doing something wrong, Damian?)[/strike] (No, I just needed some luck)
- The difficulty spike after the spider boss could use some smoothing.
- The penultimate floor has a significant and annoyingly large chance to generate a floor which is completely impossible, requiring you to use the ""reroll"" cheat code quite often.

A list of things I think the game does really, really well:
+ Behold! A combat system more nuanced than ""left-click until it dies,"" but less needlessly complex than ""here's 8 cooldowns for 10 special abilities!"" They said it couldn't be done.
+ A lore and history is built and presented in a way to the end user that isn't needlessly expositive or hopelessly arcane.
+ Character creation is goofy and neat despite extremely limited options. 
+ Crafting is easy to learn and worthwhile to perform.
+ Alchemy adds another layer of depth to the game and subtly puts a new way of thinking into the player's resource hogging instincts.
+ The Item Chute is a great way to make the next run not suck.",1643058372,1644951096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Slasher's Keep is an Indie, RPG, FPS, Action RogueLite that is all about Hacking, Blasting, and Slashing your way through a Procedurally Generated Dungeon, [b]In Beautiful Cell-Shaded Glory! YES! [/b] 

[h1] Think a Procedurally Generated, Cell Shaded, Dark Messiah of Might And Magic! OMG YES! [/h1]
[b]Knock foes into Spikes, down Pits, into Fire, Show em Who's The Boss![/b]
Knock em around! [b]Smashing em around with your Big, Manly Sack! Not Kidding. [/b] 
No Boots of Doom here: in Slasher's Keep, Your Loot is your Secret Weapon! 💰

So Swing away! Smashing and Stunning them with your radically unconventional tactics and power! 💪
Be Unconventional! 👍

[h1] Impressive Environmental Interactivity![/h1] 
The dungeons are packed full of physical and physics based stuff that reaction to your presence, and to the presence of monsters approaching you. 

Crates and barrels block movement and can be pushed around, as can the Explosive Barrels of fun you find, just waiting around for a good whack for a good time. 

Pressure plates slam spikes into any meat in their path, scything blades speed across corridors, acid slimes leave caustic little presents for any unwary feet, turrets fire off bolts of dark energy to blast down any in their path, and more!  

And spike traps are everywhere, just waiting for anyone to push it too far, just like in Dark Messiah, so you know what to do! 💰

[h1] Big Hits For The Big Win![/h1]
Remember to charge up your attacks for more Power. 
Holding that power attack while you sprint towards the moleman or zombie or goblin from across the room to get the sneak attack + sprint bonus on damage helps rip through them pretty quick. 💪
[b]Power Attack FTW![/b]

Those quick little attacks are to finish off weaken foes, or to smash pots, even when you get boxed in, it’s best to still try to charge up the big hits, holding the A or D key Skyrim style when you to swap the area in a cone. It will hit each foe in front of you. 
You are a hero, so cleave through your foes for victory!

[h1]But Be Careful Manly Man! Or Wo-Man! Or Manly Them![/h1]
Though you are a Manly Man, or manly Lady if you wish, your foes hit Hard! 
And healing is sometimes hard to find. So try not to get hit! 
Stick and Move, and remember to at least block if you see a hit coming, as even a moleman can scratch you up something fierce! 

[h1]Plus, the Permadeath is Optional in this Rogue Lite![/h1]
Which is quite the boon, if you're not into the whole dying and starting at the beginning scene.

However, there are a few things I would like to see fixed in the future:
- Attack range seems a bit wonky. Enemies who make use of close range melee attacks can sometimes land their hits from far, but your character can never do so.
- If you're walking from side to side and try going up wooden stairs, your character gets stuck on the last step.
- When charging up an attack you can run in any direction except backwards... why?
- The random generation of levels can be quite aggravating, as sometimes you don't come across a smithing station until the 4th or 5th floor.
- Music does get a bit redundant.

Overall a good quality game and would recommend.

However, I think the roguelite structure (as currently implemented) does the game more harm than good as it makes the game rely on needless grinding too much. But wait, you say, you mentioned that the gameplay is fun. It is, but only on the floors where the enemies pose an actual challenge. You see, when you reach mid game, clearing the first floors poses no challenge at all. However, you still have to tediously do it each time you restart because if you skip these floors you'll miss out on valuable experience. When you die (as far as I understand the game mechanics), you loose the percentage of your overall stats (not just the ""new"" stats you acquired during that run), so if you skip those first floors and die, you might actually end up in worse state than when you started.

I wish the game offered unlockable shortcuts every couple of floors to where the challenge/fun is (to compensate, the default dungeon size could be increased), however that would also mean having to change other systems, such as only taking away from the newly required stats.

Slasher's Keep might initially seem like one of many rogue-something games that oversaturate the market without providing any real value in return but that's where you'd be wrong as the game has quite a few tricks up its sleeves. While simplistic at its core, it does offer a fairly competent procedural random generation of levels filled with decently interesting variety of enemies and loot. Where it truly shines though is its auxiliary mechanics - you have got a good combat system at its core, yes, but you also get a fairly innovative crafting system that let's you utilize all little bits and bobs you have collected throughout the dungeons and put it together to obtain either a weapon that looks competent and believable or a utter mess of components smashed together without any thought that looks like a fantasy DYI project gone bananas - but it will be fun. Slasher's Keep is not a game for tens of hours of immense fun, but it is really good for being developed by just one person and is worth its price, now that it's out of Early Access.

I really enjoyed the game's whimsical feel and gameplay throughout my first few hours of trying to level up a bit, learn the mechanics, and eventually beating the first boss. The next area was rough, a nice spike in difficulty. However, I was then greeted by the true enemy of the second chapter and the part that is preventing me from giving it a fully glowing review.

Platforming.

It's jank AF. Not only are the platforms tiny, but your character can 'stick' and not catch them properly. Then, once you start getting a rhythm, you have to make the another ten to twenty jumps, many in a row. It totally killed my vibe for the game and felt like it destroyed the pacing. The challenge was leveling up, getting stronger skills, crafting and looting better weapons, but now my progression is being blocked hard by something that honestly feels like it should just be removed, retooled, and then added back in. It's incredibly frustrating and then some random generations of the ledge puzzles can FORCE you into doing them multiple times over. This is typically what ends my runs and stops me from returning for a day or two before trying again since you can't progress through a level without doing this.

I also have not found any skills that makes this easier. No increased jump height or movement speed. Height especially would be really helpful.

Other than that, it honestly is a fun game and I can see myself playing for a lot longer, but the platforming is just a monster buzzkill for me. Thought you should know.",1640839725,1640839725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So there are bits I'll mention that fans of the genre can just immediately disregard, I guess. If anything, reviewing this game is testing my own self-reflection because I have very mixed feelings.

The most notable thing is that I have 30+ hours in the game. Only something like... 12-20 was to complete the ""story"" of the character I chose. My point is that this game got me excited and invested not only to ""complete"" it, but to play it beyond completion. Which is where my recommendation comes from. Certainly, even at full price, this game earns its worth.

I'll start with story, since I mentioned it. And it's usually something I care about. I didn't pay attention here. It's told via text screens between loading into levels. It's so disconnected from the gameplay that I didn't even realize at first it was talking about my character. You end up seeing the same text over and over due to the rogue-like nature, too, so that makes it feel even more like it's not the same reality that you live in.

The next thing I'll mention is the jank, since everyone makes mention of it. What I felt was that the jank was deliberate. It added- for the most part- to the learning curve of the game. So I don't consider it a downside... sort of. The most noticeable jank had to do with crap being in the way of doors and stairs. Sometimes this seemed like things were misaligned, but it's hard to tell. Clearly the game seemed to have fun making locomotion a chore for the player. The second thing was enemy pathing. They just walk in a straight line at the player. It's funny at first seeing them knock over bookshelves and tables. But it gets eyeroll inducing when they get stuck on EVERYTHING.

The thing that ultimately ruined the game for me was, indeed, the rogue-like nature. Even though this is a rogue-LITE in the sense that you can retain so much after each death that you just get stronger and stronger despite continual failure. At first it seemed clever to me. What an interesting twist on RPG leveling mechanics. But then I thought, ""Why not just make the game longer?"" Indeed, since you are continually fighting the same enemies and seeing the same rooms, rather than have a 10 room dungeon, why not 100? Just make a regular game where dying sends you to the checkpoint. At some point I died to something stupid. I stepped on an easily avoidable trap and it ONE SHOT me, despite having really good gear. And I was carrying both items for a rare character unlock I had successfully been retaining for my entire playthrough thus far. And I just had that defeated sigh of losing that, plus all the awesome gear I was carrying... and I just gave up. I'll never know why people find the idea of losing progress to be so exciting. I'm guessing there's some correlation to people who enjoy gambling. Hell if I know. So I started a new character (the demon) I had unlocked and UGHHHH starting from the VERY beginning was so much worse. Sorry, but I have other games to play.

So why even play this game? Personally, I'd say it's a fascinating set of systems design and execution. It's a pretty niche experience. Like the dungeon-crawler/looter aspect is there and all, but figuring out how to succeed is really interesting.

Oh, and the second biome sucks. Too many traps, too much platforming. It might be one of my recommends with the MOST warnings/caveats.",1636344763,1636344773,True,12,1,0.586363732814788818,0,True,False,False,False,,,

When i first started playing this game back a couple years ago, i never thought to move more creatively or using the surroundings to my advantage and with my recent revisit of the game, i noticed more small boxes to jump on leading to more risky jumps on the railings on room or even jumping on one of the breakable pots. The games got small features that make it better sooooo.

Here's a couple things i noticed:

-traps are hell and a simple solution (certain rooms will have a trap that shoots out dark orbs and usually there is a switch somewhere in the room to shut it off)
-its got lovable jank (enemies might just end up spawning in the stairs in rooms but will pop out)
Also if your melee knockback stat is increased sometimes you are able to knock enemies out of the room (but they come running back through the walls)
-Stat loss is temporary, skills are FOREVER (for real you can keep skills, every other level you get one permanent skill point) but keep in mind you can only put points in skills you already have like from weapons and armor, etc.
-you can run forever, you'r character will pant and in general breathe heavy but you can just keep running forever
-sprinting bonus and sneaking bonus, they are nice but one of them the sneaking bonus is much harder than the sprinting bonus

Unfortunately gameplay itself gets stale quickly. Combat is tedious and repetitive, you just attack and block over and over. There are no special attacks or dodges and ranged combat using wands is pretty shitty.
All enemies feel like damage sponges and you can either push them into spikes or do the attack/parry dance, patiently waiting for enemy to attack so you can parry. There is no sense of progression as with each floor enemies damage and HP goes up so much you either die to the first enemy you fight or just mind numbingly chip away at their health for what feels like eternity. Add to that tiny, cramped combat arenas that don't allow much freedom in tackling the encounters. Very often you'll be pushed into the corner by the group of enemies and ganked, cause combat system isn't really suited for fighting multiple enemies at once.
I get it that its a roguelike and there is a persistent character progress between each run, but it just feels so insubstantial. I played plenty of other roguelikes that have satisfying combat that doesn't make you feels like its mandatory to die over and over to restart the game and progress your character (City of Brass and Dead Cells come to mind).
Slasher's Keep isn't a terrible game, its just tedious to play and despite unique visuals there isn't much here to keep me playing.

Well into the game, there is climbing by **jumping around a tower with timed steps**.

Climbed that tower, not so difficult, but when I found 2 towers more complicated in the next level, I uninstalled.
So, if like me, you detest timed jumpings, think if you want to buy it.
If not, buy it.
The constantly appearing ""FACE"" popup when meleeing enemies, breaks the immersion. Thanks.

SOLUTION FOR JUMPING: Cheat Engine SPOILER !!

On ground, search 4 bytes, exact, 256.
On air (get a pause with alt tab to cheat engine) search 0.
Repeat a few times: the correct address ends in 0, freeze it ticking the square box.

pros:

cons:
-world visuals are a bit repetitive
-procedural doesnt create super interesting dungeons to look at
-iventory bash instead of kick, pretty weird decision
-inventory system is a bit rudimentar but it works
-combat is decent but needs to be against smarter enemies to be more tactful, its sad that its not very technicall and most enemies only have one attack and if  they move they just move towards you.
-due to its roguelite nature, late game content is gate keeped by how patient you are. you can save in between sessions but you might die and lose your whole progress so its only worth if you have to close the game.

It's a charming, unique and well-polished indie game, and I honestly feel bad for leaving a negative review, but the issues this game has with it's balancing leave me with little choice.

There's a lot of good ideas in here, and a lot of things that work well. The artstyle and music is great, the combat feels good and responsive, and the roguelike mechanics are well designed.

However, out of all the roguelikes I've played, this is one of the worst cases of balancing I've seen. The standard difficulty feels akin to ""Very Hard"" in most other games, and this stems from a terrible scaling system. By floor 3, if you haven't gotten lucky enough to find a decent weapon (which has been a very rare occurence) you'll have to get used to trading blows with basic enemies for what feels like an eternity. The philosophy behind the scaling model seems to be to make enemies as spongy as humanly possible with each floor increase. This gets incredibly frustrating when you get locked into room with 4-5 enemies. Enemies hit like trucks and you hit like a wet noodle. Even with a high level, good perks, a high armor rating, it doesn't feel like it makes any difference at all. Even the lifesteal perk heals next to nothing.

I can only imagine this was made more for players with a masochistic mindset who enjoy gameplay bordering on unfair. If that's your cup of tea, this game should be able to scratch that itch quite competently.

Starts off as a fun little dungeon-crawler RPG with interesting mechanics and complexity, but it all quickly grows to wear in the gameplay loop. 
The ramp-up from one level to the other is HUGE, you seemingly face the same enemies in each level, except that they grow tremendously stronger, meaning you have to fully explore the previous level to increase your chances. This wouldn't really be a problem for a roguelike, but when dying means you have to start all over again, scrupulously exploring each level time and time again instead of moving forward feels like a chore.
Upon arriving on a new level, your first goal is to immediately find a new weapon to compensate for the ever-increasing enemy health pool, something not always possible since the first room you find might leave you locked in with a throng of enemies with  no means of escaping.
The game encourages grinding, with every death making you lose a slight amount of progress, but still not enough to knock you down back to null. This is very redundant in a game of the roguelike genre.
Combat feels very slow, aiming is clunky. There are plenty of other games in the genre that very able to combine stuff like kicking, directional parrying/attacking with fast-paced gameplay, but it all comes to a slog here where to most effective way is to hold LMB and swing a charged-up attack, wait, hold LMB  and again and repeat.... *sigh*
One other gripe I have with this game is the unnecessary physics engine that only serves to inhibit the player - items getting stuck underneath the player, blocking movement etc.

It's a real shame, because the game's artstyle is fun and some of the detail in this game is really exceptional, but my listed downsides far outweigh the good.",1630146756,1630146756,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Art style and overall mood is great, good amount of various upgrades - too. But other than that this game is a big oof.

First zone is fun and enemies/environments aren't as frustrating. The second zone is like a big middle finger. Lots of spikes, lots of extremely frustrating platforming, where missing a single pixel makes you go down to the ground for a frustrating repeat. 3rd level with its books and code search are also bleh. And most levels require you to find a silver key in order to open the exit door. Sometimes you have to run around the level looking for that one particular monster with a key which you somehow missed earlier.

The leveling system and the way to get stronger - is very very slow and methodical. You literally have to sacrifice every few levels just to restart and grind experience for your character's level increase and to gain some additional skill/attribute points. It just prolongs your suffering. 

I think the leveling-up should be much more player-friendly and much less grindy for this game to feel much much less abnoxious to play for longer period of time. A player should be able to complete a run in a single sitting. And if a player likes what he gets with this game - just let adjust the difficulty the way one wants to suffer while playing this... game.

Steam trading cards (3 drop, 5 to make a badge)
Steam achievements (30, require a lot of grind)
6 different characters to pick from (2 are from the start and 4 are unlocked)
Passive skills are really interesting game design
Roguelite is well done
Crafting is really interesting and you see everything inserted in the weapon 
Weapon and armor designs are really cool in the late game 
I love the character menu and how everything shows on my hero
After you finish the game for the 1st time you can make runs of custom length
I kinda like the risk-reward and in between runs progression 
One of few 1st person rogue lites 
Mainly melee-oriented with a lot of weapons and playstyles to pick from
Different story for every origin (told in between floors)

-
The different characters are only making different noises and start with a different passive
The ramping of difficulty feels off and you will get into a point where you are one-shot by any trap 
No narration of the story and very little voice acting overall 
Unintuitive stats - required stats are at random, it is not like heavy weapons would require strength and wands intelligence 
Too many ""what the hell is this"" rooms with a gazzilion traps going through enemies and ranged enemies sitting in the back
Insta dead pits in every other room
Only 2 bosses (at the end of the first biome and at the end of the last one)
Basically no enemy variation - you will see the same few enemies from level 1 to the final boss

Just to pinpoint a few problems.
1) The menus go off the edges of the screen in every direction, left side, right side, bottom side... actually, they never went off topside, so I'll give it that.
2) The mouse doesn't click where the cursor is.  In character creation it was clicking about a third of the screen to the right of where the cursor was at, and it didn't show up in the first menu at all, requiring me to use a controller to play.
3) Control aiming with camera is horribly off, I had to adjust the Y axis to about 70% of the X axis to make it feel even remotely close.
4) Control use in the inventory is borderline impossible, to choose a dagger I had dropped beside an axe I had to actually pick up the axe and move it out of the way, because it would always jump past the dagger to the next item no matter which direction I came at it from.
5) Swapping between mouse and controller works horribly.  Often in games where the controller is lacking, I'll grab for my mouse to do things like inventory management, and it simply...

It's a first-person dungeon crawler, and is pretty basic. You can stab, bludgeon and parry with melee weapons, shoot spells with ranged weapons, and finally can knock back enemies with your swag bag. This can be used to shove them into spikes, or off platforms, and is fun, but fiddly to get right.

At first you don't do much damage, can't take many hits, and things like the magic-casting weapons have limited ammo. As you progress you can level up, and with each death some attributes are transferred over, and some are lost. So grinding is key to getting better here, and then finding bigger, better loot.

This progress makes it easier to play, but doesn't change it up very much. In a linear game you'd probably not die so often, or can start from a save point, so whilst the fundamentals aren't dissimilar, you aren't constantly reminded it's the same thing over and over again. 

Or the narrative, or set-pieces, break up the flow. You don't get that here: you die, and you re-start, and it get's boring quickly. It's fun for a bit, though having played two types of this game in a row (Delver being the other), and having bounced off of them hard in a short period of time, I see now that this isn't the genre for me. 

Fundamentally this is the same as Elderborn / Dark Messiah / Underworld Ascendant / Kingdom Come Deliverance / Dying Light etc etc, in that you stab / block / shoot etc, but randomising levels and enemy placements is no substitute for depth, exciting combat, atmosphere, stealth, an interesting narrative, or set-pieces. 

Or preferably all of the above, such as Dark Messiah manages (if you're forgiving about it's dubious story, at least).

And this has none of those, bar the mildly enjoyable fighting which you''ll experience the entire range of within ten minutes of picking it up. It's not fair comparing a title that barely counts as ""indie"" against C to B, to A, to AAA titles, but for maybe twice the cost you can get a game that is ten times better.  It might be crushing a lone devs dream to say so, but you can't argue with maths and facts. 

If I spend £30 to £40, then I'd expect at least 20+ hours, or more, from a decent RPG or melee / FPS game. This has cost me about a £1 in a bundle, and after an hour I can't be bothered with it. If I'd paid full price I'd want a refund, because it gets so samey and boring.

If you can't afford the more expensive examples of what I would call a ""proper game"" then this is okay, but there's plenty of games with the substance that this genre (in my experience) lacks. That's two for two now, and so far my response is....""meh""

Despite some flaws and the dreaded mid to late game slog that these roguelikes tend to have have, its a fun game with some interesting ideas.

Story is meaningless, in my 20 or so runs, i have 0 idea why im in a dungeon, or why i need to go up instead of out. Some lore is shown in loading screens, but i hit play the second i can which on my SSD, is like 2 seconds so i rarely read more than 3 words. 

Graphics are a very nice hand drawn style. Everything is colorful and vibrant, this isnt Legends of Grimrock where everything is dark and grim. If it werent for the blood and decapitations, it would be a pretty cute little game.

Combat is hit or miss, depending your tolerance for BS. Melee swings are very hard to read distance, so you WILL miss a good number of strikes on even point blank targets. Ranged weapons are fine, but this isnt a shooter, even the best wand is cumbersome to use sometimes. Some features like sprinting or sneak attacks seem to be random, there is no sneak button so its pretty much walking up behind something and hoping they dont notice you before your strike hits for a little extra damage. Everything works fine, but i wouldn't say this game has great combat even when everything is working.

As a roguelike fan, i have experienced many mid-late games in the genre, and most of the lesser known ones all seem to have a pacing problems near the mid-late sections. This game does have permanent upgrades like perks and stats, but you lose stats on death, and although perks are pretty useful, you need stats to equip stronger gear and weapons to even have a chance in higher levels. Alot of my runs end around 3-5 levels in, enemies turn into sponges and hit like trucks, so half the time you're trying to cheese everything with ledges or traps, but the hit detection is so odd, half the time you miss point blank strikes, leading to taking half your health from a zombie or mole-rat thing.

This game is brutal, and reminds me so much another game i sunk too much time into before i realized the fun is gone and im just playing because im bored and want to finish and be done forever with it. I do enjoy this game, but i feel like in order to progress higher and win, i need to farm levels and play the first levels WAY too much, and although i do think this game is fun, its not THAT fun. 

Im going to recommend it, only on the basis that it wasn't ever in early access, is only $14, and clearly alot of effort was put into it to make it unique and fun.

One can see that [i]initially[/i] there was lots of attention to detail. Artistically, at least. And the tiny little bit of music is okay.

The rest is still a looooong ways off of even becoming half-baked. The AI is totally braindead and not even able of the most basic pathfinding, other than running at you in a straight line. Some will even just casually step into bottomless chasms. The enemies will be utterly and completely unaware of and unable to deal with any and all obstacles in their beeline towards you.

Chair/vase/whatever in the way? They don't know what to do. They won't smash breakables to clear their way and even though they can push movables, they can't actually make any intelligent use of it. If the blockade is accidentally and unwittingly pushed aside by the enemy's movement, good. If not, they'll just run in place interminably until [i]you[/i] clear the blockade for them.

If it is another enemy that's in the way, you're out of luck as well. They're oblivious to each other's presence and will neither step aside nor alarm each other.

The aforementioned novel twist forces you to replay the first couple levels over and over and over until you overcome the gating on level 4 (first boss)... of course, playing mostly the first couple levels over and over and over is kind of par for the course when it comes to roguelikes until you get better.

But most other roguelikes that I have played and [i]enjoyed[/i] playing have much more variety and bigger levels. The levels are tiny and you go through the same tiny procedural building blocks over and over and over and over... everything is sooooo samey and boring once you've done it 5 dozen times. To be clear: this game gets extremely repetitive, grindy, boring and frustrating [i]very, very quickly.[/i]

I have now spent about 60 hours. Unevenly distributed among these 60 hours are 5 hours that I learnt something new, a further 5 hours enjoying what I've learnt. The remaing 50 were spent on repetition, frustration, bewilderment and boredom.

The dev seems not to care anymore (if at all, judging by his adversity to/ignorance of feedback, not having responded to the ""bug report"" thread in over half a year), having already proclaimed his being fully focused on some other projects.

Don't expect to get any achievements on Easy difficulty, though. Apparently, you are not welcome to such a luxury for purchasing the game. 

As for the default difficulty, I wonder if the developer even saw the massive drop off in the player achievements attained after the first boss. Clearly there is an issue when the majority of players aren't progressing past the first 4 to 5 levels of the game.

The game was very enjoyable for about 6-7 hours. That's the point where I defeated the first boss. Now, if you thought the game was difficult up till this point, the next area is pretty much doubled in difficulty. I lost all motivation to continue slogging through the first 4 levels just to get back to that point again.

The deal breaker for me was that the first boss is not some kind of checkpoint. If you die after that, you still have to start all the way from the beginning again.

In summary:

- You become powerful over time. The enemies fear the very sound of your grunts echoing through the halls.
- You beat the first boss and feel a sense of achievement! (If you aren't playing on easy mode. Heh.)
- Your legendary weapon forged by your own hands now hits like a moldy wet rag.
- Your godly armor you found in questionable places now feels like you are wearing moldy wet rags.
- The new area's inhabitants think your Halloween costume is cute.
- They make quick work of your trick-or-treating ways.
- You wake up in your jail cell feeling weaker and unable to use your less wonderful wet rags.
- You decide not to celebrate Halloween anymore.

Seriously this game is amazing its so much fun, the combat style is unique and the challenge is great

Visuals are really new to me, never had much experience in 2D models in a 3D world before that were done as good as this one 


Its neat, you block enemy attacks by pressing right click on mouse while aiming your weapon towards the area they are attacking from, this makes blocking really fun and requires good reflexes

So far I havent gone past the first boss, the curve goes up a LOT after that which I love

This is a roguelite, aka it has progression
If you die you keep your level, you lose the current items you have and some gold and some stats like 1-2 str or whatever.

You can store weapons in hatches and they will be ready for you in the beginning of the next run, so you  throw stuff there to start the next run with great gear if you already have something else 

Honestly I got this game for $9 on the summer sale and I am having a blast, this game is great

Basically if Chivalry and the serie Archer had a roguelite baby.

Edit : 
Changed to negative sadly, but it's still a really good game imo, it just need more work.
After beating the first boss, the difficulty become really nonsensical especially if you play in permadeath.
The enemys suddenly become bullet sponges and they do a sh*t ton of damage, even tough you level youre character and get geared as much as possible.
The difficulty curve is trough the roof, I like my games to be difficult but make it at least make sense, it shouldn't ramp up that much that fast it should be way smoother than that.
Also reusing the assets of the first biome is really lazy, like the rat, they use him later in the game with a huge hp and damage buff but it's still the same rat visually, he isn't even geared.

Edit 2 : Gave up on trying to finish the game on permadeath normal difficulty after loosing a game due to a game breaking bug several times  where suddenly I can't run, open the menu and the inventory for no reason. 
I alway get that bug in the middle of a combat late game, I absolutely don't know what trigger it.
I'm suposed to run to avoid bullets but I can't run, I can't open the inventory for the invincibility potions and I can't open the pause screen to quit the game to reload, so I die and and get punished for playing permadeath on a sh*t buggy game.
There is also the famous bug where the goatman hit obstacles but don't stop and get his cooldown like he's suposed to, so he keep charging non stop toward you until he hit you.
Combine that with the ridiculous difficulty curve where you get one shoted by almost anything and you get a mess.

The Update!
After an additional 48h and a insaine Quality of life update and patches, has made this game fun! I have decided to re-review the game with all the new work put in to it. To be fair it is a bit of a grind fest, but it feels far more balanced this time around. I have been dying a lot less because of enemies being a way higher level than me. They have fixed the scaling issue. They have added crafting for potions and other mystery things to consume or throw. The map layout has been patched, No more dead ends with unbeatable floors.

Gameplay!
This game can get repititve on a inferno run, But i think the mindset is to not try and grind it all out in a day. Its a test of endurance. One small mistake like falling in to a pit, or not healing at the right time can send you back to the start. I wish there were more unique looking enemies, Right now the loot goblin is by far my faviourte mob/boss. The 2nd area dosent have a boss, but you fight a giant spider at the end of the first area and final boss at the end of the third. Feels like its missing a boss. The enemies get repititve in there looks by the time you hit the third floor. Its all the same looking mobs. I think giving them armor they could drop if defeated would help with this, along with giving new ways of gaining loot. The crafting in the game was confusing at first, but makes sense once you find out the 3 skills you should permalevel for it.

Overall id reccommend this game with the recent patchs. If you think the trailer looks fun, and you are a fan of first person hack and slash games give it a try!

It feels weighty and aiming at the enemies weapon to parry is really fun. I was hooked for the first 10 hours.

Progression is just awful though. You come to multiple points (specifically the first few times you encounter the second and third stages) where your stats just aren't good enough and you will find that you are hitting enemies 10+ times with power attacks to kill them and you will just randomly get insta-killed to something. You'll have to spend your time bashing your head into the same 5 enemies slowly leveling your stats (as you lose a bunch of them on each death) until eventually you do enough damage and have enough health to reasonably take on the later stage enemies just to find yourself in an unwinnable situation the next floor and have to do it all over again. This problem may be remedied with a proper build, but that is so hard to do considering the perks you find on gear and getting a point to permalearn one comes down to leveling  and getting one randomly or completing one of the quests (some of which you can do within 2 rooms and others you can't complete if you don't get the right conditions). Basically you're going to be going through the same 3-6 floors numerous times fighting the same few enemies hoping to finally be at that point where you have good enough stats to brute force your way through.

First 10 hours of this game were extremely fun, the next 5 were a slog. I genuinely want to like this game but I can't if the progression stays this way.

You lose 25% of your levels, stats, and gold when you die, along with all of your held gear. I don't know why the developer decided to be so punishing. The only thing you can keep from your level ups are the abilities every so many levels. That means in order to make a death worth it, or a run worth it when you die, you have to really capture and grind as much XP as possible. You can't afford to sprint through sections to get back to where you were before, which is one of the key components of making a Roguelike respect player time, by getting them back to their milestones faster the more runs they put in. Instead, the developer decided to make it more punishing when you die by eating your levels and stats. The more runs you put in, the more costly everything is because of how much more XP you have to gain to get another level.

Lower level mobs don't give enough XP to justify making it to the first boss and getting murdered by it or murdered shortly thereafter. You really have to make sure you're scraping every bit of XP you can to avoid suffering from the level loss. It's 25% of your levels gone every death and it's not as if you get strong enough by the time your level loss on death is equivalent to the levels gained by the time you get to the spider boss. Those enemies in the first section of the game will hit quite hard and you will need to hit them through several block sequences in order to kill them. You can't quickly get through the game to return to your furthest mile stone. Your level ups do not trivialize enemies you've killed for hours and you can't afford to ignore the XP and items you've been churning through and losing for hours.

The whole thing really maximizes that treadmill grind that makes video games a complete waste of time. If it was only item and gold loss on death, then I would have less of a problem with it because you would be able to sprint through the early sections, get enough gear to make it through the first boss, and have something resembling a quick return to your previous milestones but the fact that XP and stats are lost make death so punishing that it's not worth playing. It really feels like the developer wanted to make the game give the player as little progression as possible for as long as possible.

Beyond the sheer garbage balancing, the game has some serious, glaring quality of life flaws that I'm honestly shocked weren't caught in play testing because they can't possibly be seen as fun.

First, there's so much garbage on the ground that will slow the player down. I'm not talking about oil slicks that are intended to slow the player, I mean anything that the player touches of any size is an inertia eating, black hole Kirby that will suck the player in until they're no longer touching it. Skulls on the ground might as well have a chain attached to your foot that's being pulled the opposite way you're running. Crates the size of your foot will lock you down like you're walking through a linebacker. Parts of busted crates are glue traps used to catch rats that you somehow stepped on. You get the point. Every single interactive edge in this game destroys your movement and there's crap like this in every room and hallway you encounter. It's such a terrible decision to make non-trap items slow the player down. Even the pressure plates that spring traps on you if you walk on them will slow you down as you walk around them. The only reasonable thing to do is jump over them because skirting to the side turns it into an impromptu oil slick. All the developer had to do was not make these items slow the player down and I would not have much of an issue with them.

Second, enemy attacks are abysmally hard to track. This is partly due to the medium, in that it's fake 3D sprites. The sprites themselves are 2D and they spin on the center of the object and are drawn from the perspective of always facing the player to create the illusion of 3D depth. The problem is that it's ridiculously unreliable to judge actual distances of attacks when you're moving side to side, which is the motion required to parry attacks. Enemies that can parry will auto parry, because the game's not using human beings relying on visual cues to intercept a foreshortened attack whose angle changes when you twist.

This mechanic is so unreliable that I still don't know which enemy attacks can even be parried. There's no indicator on which attacks are able to be parried and which ones are not, you just have to figure it out. Ranged attacks seem to universally land, but I think sometimes I've been able to attack them out of the air. There's a charge attack that will all but one shot you when you first encounter it. I think there's an attack the mole person does that is able to be parried but when they wind up for the side angled swipe I just get nailed by it every time, even though I can mostly reliably parry the shots from the ghouls with swords and without swords.

This is especially bad if you're on any kind of elevation change as attacks going up and coming down are not drawn to account for those perspectives. It's only ever worth parrying when on even ground. I would really like to have seen a red, 50% opacity line indicating where the enemy is going to land their attack while they wind up, because that's the point of the wind up. The wind up tells the player where to put the parry and the timing of the parry but it's so poorly communicated through the faux 3D depth of the chosen medium that I'll get hit by shots I swear I was intercepting. Having an actual line draw in the air separate from the attacking object that represents where the attack is going to be would help immensely with tracking and parrying. Plus, having an indicator for which attacks are parryable, unparryable, and which ones can be intercepted with player swings would be very helpful. It's rather surprising that these basic conveniences aren't included.

There's no dodge. There's sprinting, and there are bonuses associated with sprinting when the player lands a hit, but there's no way to slip to the side or slip backwards. Not every space you're in will allow for sprint attacks. Most rooms are cluttered, filled with movement speed destroying obstacles, and you simply don't have enough time to get around so many enemies before you take so much damage it's not worth it.

Crafting is too unreliable to be useful. Crafting components are not readily available through the course of your playing, they're not good enough to justify doing the crafting, the components and crafted items are all lost on death anyway, and they're expensive to acquire from the merchant. Plus, you have to actually find a smithy in order to craft the weapon.

Wands rely on the Intelligence stat, take up an equip slot, and provide passive stats and ability bonuses like any other piece of gear. But the way they're treated is like an occasionally useful piece of armor.

Enemies in this game all take so long kill. I legitimately stood in a room with pillars for 5 minutes to bait two skull enemies down and kill them because pillars busted their detection / pathing so much.

There's no gear protection and not enough gear to fill all your open gear slots. Marginal upgrades on gear you already have but not finding gear you don't have feels bad.

The item chute. You might think you can churn through enough gear to fill out your sets by throwing excess gear down chutes, but not really. The other uses for gear are better options than using the chute for a later run.

The inventory space is terrible. I don't think you can spin items, so throw standard inventory management out the window. I don't know how having such little inventory space is supposed to make my experience more entertaining but all it does is make the player leave value on the table.",1621122998,1621123076,False,9,4,0.504463076591491699,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I had a lot of fun with it but it has SERIOUS problems, so I recommend reading this!

PROS:

* This game really captures the best parts of a classic action RPG when it comes to loot.  I honestly have been bored by most newer RPG loot since Diablo II.  This takes me back to that feeling.  The gear you find matters A LOT, and it's not just a pure numbers game.

* The skill system is unique and interesting.  Gone are preset paths.  Instead you get points you can use to lock in skills items provide, or a random one you get every other level.  You can choose what to pick or buff, or sit on your points hoping for a game changing skill to appear on an item to invest in.

* Creativity is rewarded.  Sure you can slash your way through everything, it's in the title.  But you can knock enemies into spikes and pits to get insta kills, if you can manage it.  You can try to even build your character around it.

* Good sense of humor.  The game makes plenty of meta jokes, from referring to your inventory in serious lore parts.  To weird posters on the wall.

CONS:

* The game relies too much on just making enemies tankier and doing more damage, rather than introducing more enemy types.  To the point that your first run with every character will be a slog every floor.  Yeah, you can sit there and block (melee) attacks to grind through it with no damage, but it takes forever - sometimes spiking things isn't an option.

* READ THIS IF NOTHING ELSE!: The middle three floors of this map RUIN the game.  Suddenly the game is full of platforming challenges, which are often REQUIRED to proceed.  There are NO platforming challenges in the floors before or after these middle 3 levels.  And that wouldn't be all that bad if it weren't for the fact the platforming is VERY BAD. 20% of the time your jump inputs WILL BE EATEN and you WILL fall.  Many of these have spikes at the bottom which do a TON of damage.  And no, I""m not just bad, I've beaten many a troll platformer in my day.  It's just bad,  doesn't work, and stands out like a sore thumb from the rest of the gameplay. [Damian please get rid of these, this game is otherwise a 10/10]

* More middle floor issues: The middle floors also have 10 times as many traps as the floors both before and AFTER it.  Rolling hallways of spikes, swinging blade traps, rapid fire turrets.  Any of these on their own is not an issue, but often they will all be in the same place and make it impossible to not take damage.  Even worse, often their will be ranged enemies that also back away from you as you get close in the hallway, making it even harder.  This is ON TOP OF enemies being extremely tanky by these floors, making it even harder to take out the ranged unit

* Ranged enemies.  There's no way to block ranged shots except for a rare skill which I've only been able to lock in on one run.  One or two two is a nice challenge, but some rooms will have like 5 moths, which are the unit that backs away from you while firing.  They can back over pits where you can't melee them, or fly too high up to melee(I haven't seen this in a bit, it might be fixed).  You may say ""just shoot them"", except in this game you have very limited ammo.  Which might be better used for skulls, another flying unit that almost always floats out of melee range, with some variants that never charge at you.  I think the best fix for this would be to get rid of the ammo mechanic, I could live with it, even when they're in terrible death hallways.

* Bosses are too easy.  You'll see a lot of threads from new players that ""the first boss is too hard"".  As soon as you know it's gimmick though it's the easiest thing in the world to beat.  Drop a bomb on it's eggs when it lays them, and kite it onto the acid it leaves behind.  I'd fight this boss 1000 times before I'd face a single moth in a spike hallway.  However the final boss is also too easy.  Unlike the first, the main villain just yells over and over at you how to beat him for one.  And again like the first, once you know the gimmick it's easy to beat without taking any damage.  Floors are MUCH more dangerous than bosses.





TL:DR - You will have a lot of fun with this game for the first 3 floors and the 4th floor boss once you figure it out.  Floors 5-7 will ruin the game for you. 8-11 you will be pleasantly confused that the difficulty seems normal again.

I just found it far to difficult to finish the first floor after the boss and when you die you have to start from the start and you've lost all your best gear so now back to the grind so you can survive it again. No thanks, such as shame as well.

The art style, the theme, the fragmented story you learn as you progress through the dungeon is all great, however the combat goes from okay to bland very fast and the difficulty ramps up fast. This isn't inherently bad, but it seems it's intentionally designed around preparing for your next run. This is obviously fine in roguelikes but again it becomes much more bland than roguelikes of a similar nature. You fall into a pattern of get good gear, dump good gear into chute for next run, die then try and find better gear than the gear you dumped the first time in order to dump that gear. It wears down on the player especially since most people will probably hit a wall around the first boss or the level after as, as i said, the difficulty becomes insanely hard, Enemies that look and act exactly the same then can one/two shot you. Obviously this is intentional and you're supposed to level up and get better in order to overcome the difficult levels, but without a skill tree, 3 very bland stat-booster skills, you're really reliant on gear. 

There are other annoyances such as the physics of boxes and barrels getting you stuck or wedged into hallways and flying enemies with no real way to attack aside from wasting time trying to get them to come to you or hoping you find a wand decent enough to kill them with the few charges it has. The game has these things called ""challenge rooms,"" that aren't any different then every other room and there's no real way to tell what rooms are challenge rooms. One of these rooms had an enemy glitch through the floor causing me to become stuck as there was no way to kill them and no way to leave the room.

And as he opened his eyes, he yet again saw the hand extended, and once more he reached out and was struck down. And on this went: sleep, wake up, get knocked down, for a thousand days, or years. But the man’s faith never wavered, he reached for the hand each and every time. 
    And his head grew sore from the beating, and he grew a great horn on his head from where he was struck. And after some time he awoke, and he reached out, and his torturer gripped his hand tightly, and he pulled the man to his feet. And still the man spoke no ill of him. And that’s not why, instead his horn was broken off and melted before his very eyes. And it was poured upon his skin until it engulfed him whole. And then that shell of his grew darker and green and then red then finally golden. Because, you see, the man was rewarded for his devotion! And now the two stood, one before the other, as equals! 
    They stood for a day or so, until the winter came, and the man who once stood his master now bowed before him, and then laid flat on the ground face down and fell asleep. And so did all the other people of the land, as far as the man could see. And in a day’s time or a week, one by one they would wake and the man wandered around striking them down as they tried to grab his hand. And the man did his duty as the seasons passed him by until he came upon another man in autumn, who did no sleep and did not lie. And he spoke unto the man. He said “be gone”, and the man went and gone he was. And when the weather turned and thunder tore open the sky, there came an ill wind and it shoved him over; to his knees he fell.

What I didn't expect was how well it lent itself to playing a second or third, or tenth time.  Kudos to the Developer - I think this was a hit.

Not that I didn't find some things annoying.   Getting slowed down or, caught up on small debris or on the edge of stairs introduces a level of ""tedious"" that wears like a blemish on an otherwise smooth experience.  I didn't hate the parkour portions, but less of that would probably be better (IMO).

There are games out there that are better, like Hades or Dead cells, but if you are tired of them - try Slashers keep, it's quite worth your time and money.

Good stuff:
+immersive 3D action battles with tactical parry system
+intresting ""comic'sy"" sprite graphic
+variety of perks
+ability to craft super strong but silly looking weapons
+fun factor due to a bit of sillyness here and there.
+you can smack moles with a loot sack!
+the game runs well and smooth, hasn't seen any bugs in 50h playtime.

Neutral stuff:
difficulty curve - during your first run you will feel weak, miserable and frustrated. But if you continue to play the same character and aquire enough perks - you will feel like an unstoppable god of war. Snowballing really gets out of hand later on.
[strike]anime was a mistake[/strike] Second biome was a mistake. Jumping puzzles waste a lot of time and the number of spiky and thorny things is really excessive to my taste.
Just 3 main weapon types - swords, axes and maces. And due to their sheer strength most people use only the later one.
Way too many repetetive monsters, and most of them persist through the all biomes. Not enough enemy variety.

Negative:
-with levels monsters only get bulkier and hit harder but that's it. no intresting modifiers/perks/conditions, just more hp.
-hot goblin girls posters are only in the first biome!!!
-just 3 biomes, not enough details on them either. the same walls all the time are kinda sad to see.
-literally just 2 bosses. spider and the last one. Totally not enough in my opinion. 
-lack of a truly unique weapons/equipment. Like literally - there is just one truly unique weapon in the whole game - the exterminator mace.

Slasher's Keep seems to be made for people like me in that sense because there is character progression, and dying doesn't feel like too much of a punishment. When you die you do lose a little bit of your character progression, but it doesn't take long to get back to where you were. The art, music, voices, sound effects, atmosphere, and occasional silliness all come together to deliver a truly unique and entertaining experience that keeps me coming back.

It's extremely tedious and repetitive, it's not like many other roguelike games where you are pretty much guaranteed to win based on your skill level. Your character only loses part of it's perks and levels on death, meaning the game actually wants you to die countless times before making any good progress with each new character you start as.

Enemy scaling between the floors is absolutely terrible, that's where the fun gets sucked out of the game, you are going to be facing the same enemies over and over again and watch them grow absurdly in power while you remain largely the same. They will eventually have an enormous health pool and will mostly one-shot you, ending your run regardless of how far you made it in the game.

There are some things named item chutes on each floor, the items dropped inside them will be given back to you at the start of a new run. In theory it should work wonders when you have good equipment later in the game and you know you can't quite win yet.

Majority of the negative reviews for this game seem to be because of the jumping puzzles. Yes, they are one of the weakest parts to the game but it doesn’t deserve a thumbs down because of it. Slasher's Keep is a really fun roguelike dungeon crawler that you can easily loose time playing.

The combat having directional blocking is something I found great about this game but at later levels I just had to kite every enemy as this was the only way to defeat them. The RPG elements really helped with the replayability of the game, with all the different weapon types and perks. You can make some interesting builds. The level design for me did get stale but that’s due to there only being three different themes.

[b] Is the game worth buying? [/b] Yes, but they need to work on adding more content and making the jumping puzzles more diverse as they are currently boring/repetitive.

It is fun, up to a point, but it's really too much work without much payoff in the long run. You'll basically run the first few levels over and over and over until you get enough levels, stats, and gear to make if farther. If you die, you lose about 25% of your levels and stats, as well as all of your gear. You do get to keep your skills, and they do help. You can save some gear for the future if you make it to a chute that sends gear to your future self. Kind of standard for a roguelike, but there are some problems.

1. It's really really easy to die, and it's not always because you played poorly. Getting one shot happens pretty often, no matter how many levels or the gear you have. This makes it easy to get caught in a loop, where you die, start a new game with reduced levels and stats, and bad gear. Then you die again almost immediately because you were undergeared and didn't have enough stats, and now you are even worse off than before. You can recover from this, but it takes a LOT of work and luck. 
2. The game isn't as smooth as you would think. It's too easy to get caught on the edge of things like steps, or barrels, or just a broken box. For a game that requires absolutely precision or else you'll get 1-2 shotted, that's not acceptable. You might even just step on or around something and get bounced up in the air. 
3. Eventually you run into plaforming/jumping puzzles. These are not fun. It's obvious they were put into the game to slow down progress, but they are frustrating. The lack of precision and control means you end up falling because you snagged something you didn't see, and you start the puzzle over.

I did have some fun playing the game, and when you are making progress, it's great. When you run into levels that are nothing but spike floors, jumping puzzles, and things like that, it's frustrating. If you play long enough and rack up enough skills, you'd likely be undefeatable, even if you died multiple times in a row, but the progress is too slow and frustrating for me. I like the first 1/3 and last 3/3 of the floors, but the middle ones are slogs that basically ruin the game.

During my playing of Slasher's keep I got very mixed feeling of it and felt like for every good feature the game also had a negative one.

Game's blocking mechanic is better than Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, but this game has only melee weapons and magic wands as your weapons.

You can craft weapons from different parts that you have collected during the run, but you rarely find a crafting station where you can do that.

Game has a leveling system, but only three (3) statics you upgrade. 

What finally got me lean towards giving a negative thumb was second boss. Not only does it have enormous amount of health, the fight doesn't change between runs and thus felt so boring I quit the game and felt done with the game.

Sure you have – maybe you’re involved in a few campaigns yourself, or perhaps learnt of its existence from a tiny little show called Stranger Things. It’s a game that inspired the whole RPG genre of video games and so much more besides, but to me it feels like the genre of roguelikes has remained remarkably untouched by its influence. Yes, I’m sure there’s a bunch of titles I don’t recall or know of that tap into that love of D&D, but as far as I'm aware none hold great mainstream appeal.  Enter Slasher’s Keep – a fantasy game all about fighting with swords and magic through randomly generated maps, traps and foes, all the while growing stronger in your attempts to escape the eponymous keep. 

For something that seems to wear such inspiration on its sleeve so clearly, it’s got to be good, right? In principle, sure, but it doesn’t take much playtime at all to realise that Slasher’s Keep is... Remarkably unrefined, to say the least. Let’s run through a few of the obvious offenders; the world itself is devoid of any real personality, as are the enemies you face – the latter taking the form of what almost looks like paper cut-outs that oddly float towards you before whacking you with noodle arms. When not noodling you to death, the enemies may choose instead to just bug out completely, ignoring you until the last second or getting caught on tiny bits of scenery. If it's not them getting snagged on things like bits of fence of broken box, it's you, which endlessly breaks the flow of the game. There’s basically no music, apart from an incessant little lute/guitar solo that is just about catchy enough to prevent complete insanity. Opening chests often see their contents fly out erratically, often down the nearest pit they can find... On and on I could go, but suffice to say, it’s not the best first impression.  

[h1]Diamonds in the Rough[/h1]

Persevere, though, and there are certainly mechanics and features beneath this grainy exterior that hold their own distinct charm. Blocking and parrying is one – it’s initially a confusing system, where merely holding a button is not enough. Instead, you have to turn to face the direction an attack comes from, which feels so alien to begin with. Get used to it, though, and it’s a nice twist to combat that ensures you keep at least some of your wits about you no matter the battle.  There’s also the item chutes you can find dotted around, where anything you surrender to them this run will be available to you at the start of the next. This becomes a matter of risk versus reward - do you dump all your gear in and basically sacrifice your run to assist in helping the next dash for glory? Or do you be stingy, potentially creating problems for future you? It’s your choice entirely. 

Being able to swing your item sack around to bounce opponents into pits and spikes for an instant kill is also pretty cool – difficult fights instantly become a lot easier with good positioning. While levelling up is an ancient concept, it too is still fun enough here; bash enough heads in and you can place points into strength, dexterity and intelligence, which only assist in the rapid bashing in of more heads. You’re also given the chance to retain one of the skills from your gear as a permanent boon, which range from the odd (decapitated heads explode) to the insanely good (the ability to deflect ranged attacks). Given a small amount of time and effort, mixing all these together make the first floors go from games of intricate battles patience where you constantly fight for your life, to mad dashes where it’ll be lucky if the bad guys get a good look at you before you turn them into a fine paste. 

This couples well with a system where rapidly chaining kills provides big boosts to the amount of experience points you get, and therefore the amount of levels and skills you can achieve.  This ends up shifting the dynamic over time into something which sees you blitzing through the early stages as fast as you can, chaining kills for the biggest payout. Becoming the medieval version of the Flash is in fact where I think the game excels the most – I can’t get enough of zooming down corridors, desperately seeking out my next kill as the bonus timer ticks down in the corner. 

Yet even when racing around with the wind and bits of zombie in your hair, that overall lack of polish keeps bringing things to a screaming halt. One occasion saw me just randomly fall through the floor, immediately ending my run and wiping out my progress – which, as you’ll soon find out, is a very bad thing. Another time the random map generation bugged out completely, leaving me with a floor I could thankfully still complete, but for which a good ninety percent (including all the goodies within) was completely blocked off to me. There’s also an odd issue with the difficulty balance, which spikes to an almost baffling degree if you manage to defeat the first boss and reach the second area. Even as I type I’m stuck there, in a section that honestly feels like the game is chastising me for doing too well. The loading screen for this level even alludes to having to grind this, seemingly asking you to put hours in for even the chance to progress onwards.  

[h1]The pitfalls of punishment[/h1]

It’s from this where the main, massive problem of Slasher’s Keep really rears its ugly head – it just feels too cruel and punishing. Every death not only loses your items, but also a remarkably large amount of the levels you’ve earned, dramatically staggering your ability to grow more powerful and proceed. Worse yet, this happens no matter where and when you die. On one recent occasion I lost a run to the tough as nails second area mere moments after entering it. A pain, make no doubt about it, but one I was willing to take the penalty for. Yet then, mere minutes later, my own clumsiness caused me to inadvertently  fall down a pit – as which point I was punished again, with practically the same severity, placing me in a position where I was actually weaker than when I had started playing [i]over an hour ago[/i].

In short, it fails to achieve the strange paradox which defines the best games of the roguelike genre – it fails to make losing fun. There’s no sense of accomplishment in a loss, no real sense that a lot of the time you invest has any value. It’s practically all of nothing, do or die, every single attempt you make. It’s an exhausting approach, and one that consistently threatens to wipe out my entire motivation to play. 

As such, this level of brutality and disregard for your efforts unfortunately couple with the other issues in play, making Slasher’s Keep a very difficult game to recommend. It’s a shame, because there are some really interesting ideas at play here, ones where I was willing to battle through the issues on more than one occasion to try and appreciate the gems within. But when this genre is so filled to the brim with instant classics, with more appearing all the time, it hardly seems worth the effort. This could stand among the greats given a fair bit more polish and refinement, sure. But as it stands?

essentially requiring you to die and start from the beginning enough times to boost your stats high enough to be able to kill bosses in a reasonable timeframe (otherwise they would literally take you HOURS because you do so little damage, not to mention they would still one-shot you).

The dungeon generation isn't very complex and the enemies aren't very interesting, in fact, I'd go so far as to say that this game has some of the most generic enemies I have EVER seen in a game, which wouldn't be as much of an issue if you didnt fight the same 4 enemies over and over.

The premise is simple, you are a prisoner locked in a very shabby but ever changing dungeon. Every time you start the game, go to a new floor or die the levels shift. Enemies roughly stay consistent with each floor but the layouts, trap placement, special rooms, secrets all shift and change each time.

Dying isn't that big of a deal but it does punish you in a few lost levels, coin, all your items and of course starting back at floor 1. Permadeath is a option if you really like that extra thrill.

Theres a few bugs here and there, (I wish you could pick up enviroment objects and move them as pushing them aside using only your thighs gets tiresome sometimes) but nothing game breaking.

写在前面[/h1]
原谅我才打出来一个成就，就开始写测评，因为我万万没想到，玩了7个小时就解锁一个成就，这款游戏的前2-3个小时由于英语原因，游玩并不顺利，后来习惯之后才感受到原来这款游戏如此爽快。从某种程度上来说这款游戏更接近RPG游戏，因为一命通关真的好难啊！[h1]想要玩这款游戏的玩家可以先看看我文章后面自己总结的一些新手攻略，希望能帮助想玩的快速入门。
游戏简介[/h1]
第一人称高难度砍杀肉鸽地牢游戏。游戏画面风格偏向粗犷的卡通风格，有种老式美漫的感觉，游戏通过制作人物的侧面手绘实现伪3D。游戏难度较高，在容易模式下玩家可能探索十小时左右才能首次通关。游戏玩法主要是砍杀并不断地向地面前进，游戏中有较为丰富的装备、技能系统等，同时游戏的各种房间和陷阱也给玩家带来不错的游戏“乐趣”。游戏没有中文，不太影响游玩。推荐喜欢第一人称砍杀游戏或者喜欢美漫风格游戏的玩家购买游玩。

[h1]手绘卡通风格与伪3D技术的结合[/h1]
这款游戏的画面很像《行尸走肉》、《无主之地》的游戏画面(更接近无主之地，毕竟都是第一人称游戏嘛)，这两款游戏画面应该都是美漫风格画面，专业点说这款游戏使用的是Cel Shade技术(卡通渲染技术)，然后使用具有手绘特点的人物造型。就这款游戏的画面来说，游戏人物以及物品都比较粗犷，同时又较为写实，游戏的写实性体现在游戏的阴暗面，粗犷则是因为游戏的所有物品以及人物周边都有很粗的线条感，也正是因此给我的感觉像是以前的卡通一般。

如果这款游戏没有绘制人物以及物品的侧面图案，那么这款游戏的画面应该会如同《恶魔之书》一般，是立体书风格。不过这款游戏采用了伪3D技术，举个例子，当玩家镜头内的物品正面向着玩家时，玩家轻微转动角色视角，物品会随着玩家一起转动并保持物品正面始终面向玩家，不过当玩家镜头转动幅度较大时(这个转动是以物品为中心做圆周运动)，物品不再是正面对着玩家，而是侧面对着玩家，如果玩家转动180度则时物品反面对着玩家。

实际游玩时，就我个人的观感来说，几乎没有那种伪3D的僵硬感，游戏节奏比较快，战斗中的玩家很难关注到这些细节变化，唯一能感受这种伪3D的僵硬感的地方就是敌人死亡后的尸体，有时候拐角的尸体会突然“转动”一下还挺吓人的。同时这款游戏又借助了物体的阴暗面设计，使得游戏的整体立体感还不错，个人认为在目前这种较为狭窄的空间内的表现完全不输于《无主之地》这些大型游戏。
[h1]高难度的“砍”“刷”游戏[/h1]
从游戏名称《血屠城堡(Slasher's Keep)》就能看出这款游戏的暴力程度，无论是中文(血屠)还是英文(Slasher，这个单词的含义不是很确定，一方面可以用作人名，另一方面又是厮杀的意思，甚至还可以表示腐女)，都透露出血腥感。进入游戏后，玩家出现在一个监狱里，玩家要做的就是往上爬，而在往上爬的过程中，怪物会阻碍玩家，并且开门的钥匙也在怪物身上，因此玩家不得不与这些怪物进行厮杀。这大概就是不懂英文的我对游戏剧情的理解(/狗头)。玩家杀死怪物后，怪物会留很多血，并且有些时候怪物的头会分离，场面还是蛮血腥的，对这些比较介意的玩家还是慎重游玩。

接下来主要讲一下为何说这款游戏是高难度的“砍”“刷”游戏。游戏的高难度的地方首先体现在怪物上，玩家前期遇到的怪物其实很简单，但难点在于第一大关的BOSS蜘蛛，这个蜘蛛会召唤小蜘蛛(召唤后BOSS会短暂消失一段时间)，玩家如果不能在一定时间内杀死小蜘蛛会导致BOSS与小蜘蛛的围攻，个人认为很难在围攻中存活下来。那么如何快速击杀小蜘蛛呢？你需要一把强力的武器，在前期武器的获取途径基本上只能是打怪掉落，但掉落一把极品武器基本不可能，最多掉落一把绿色的武器。(除非对游戏有相当程度的了解和理解，不然通过可能性极低)

以上这些原因导致玩家第一次通关是极难实现的，作者可能也是基于此设计了一个选项——是否选择永久死亡。就目前我体验到的难度而言，我个人比较相信多数玩家和我一样都没有勾选永久死亡，那么这时这款游戏的性质就不再是第一人称肉鸽游戏，反而偏向RPG游戏，玩家可以通过一次次失败积累出不少的消耗品如血瓶、蓝瓶以及一些其他道具，并且基于游戏设计，玩家每次死亡后角色的等级保留，也就意味着玩家的角色属性点会随着游戏时间的延长不断增长，这样玩家就可以通过不断积累的经验和消耗品平推游戏，则也是为何我说这是一款“砍”“刷”游戏的原因。
如果只有这些怪物带来的难度，这款游戏自然还称不上高难度“砍”“刷”游戏。随着角色上爬的层数增加，游戏的地图中陷阱的数量开始不断上升，一开始还是明显的陷阱，到后来变为触发式陷阱，到最后甚至变为触发式致死陷阱(本来有希望通关的，直接给我干死了)，同时怪物所在的房间也增加了一些固定式的武器攻击玩家(和以撒里的那个无法攻击的石头一样)。最可恨的是，游戏设计师还在玩家去往不同房间的过道增加了一些需要掌握时机才能完美通过的陷阱，这些陷阱和固定式武器的增加给玩家通关游戏提出了更高的要求，玩家不仅要面对越来越难的怪物还要应对越来越难处理的陷阱。
[h1]一些游戏攻略(给新手玩家)[/h1]
由于我个人游玩时间也不多，因此也只能简单给大家写一些我感觉比较好用的道具以及一些物品或者机制的中文攻略(翻译)。
游戏按键这些很简单，按照提示自己试试就知道每个按键的功能是什么。但有一个攻击方式是重击，可能不太容易发现，玩家只要按住攻击键等武器抬到头顶后松开就可以触发重击，这个攻击方式用好了，基本上小怪一刀一个。还有针对那些快速攻击武器的攻击方式，玩家在正常攻击模式下，一直按住攻击键就可以一直发动正常的攻击。建议玩家可以自己感受一下这两种方式的不同。
然后是武器，近战武器这里没啥可以说的，砍就完了，远程武器则不是这样，远程武器个人感觉应该叫蓄能武器，它依赖于武器“弹夹”，如果弹夹没有子弹是无法打出子弹的，在传统RPG游戏中一般是蓝条，玩家可以通过道具给它充能。也可以通过房间中的那个像大脑的球补充能量。
还有就是游戏中的一些简单机制，第一个也是我个人认为新手玩家最常用的，我把它叫做“垃圾桶”，无其他原因就是因为它很像那种酒店或者某些楼房将垃圾倒入其中后顺着管道滑到垃圾收集点，这个“垃圾桶”在游戏中起到的作用就是将玩家暂时不需要或者想要留到下一次冒险的物品放到玩家一开始打开的宝箱中。这个垃圾桶大概长在墙壁上，上方有特殊标志，将物品放在垃圾桶后会消失。
第二个是锻造房，这个新手不太常用，玩家需要很多集齐很多东西才能打造出来武器，锻造需要蓝色的图纸(是的，那个蓝底的武器是图纸)以及锻造材料，根据图纸上武器的形状，锻造需要的基底材料也不一样，因此这种锻造类的东西直接扔给垃圾桶就行了，也许之后会用到。第三个是商店房，BOSS层必有，其他层可能会出现，只要不买图纸这个商人还是不错的，买的武器等级基本都是跟着玩家角色等级走的。
目前我也就这点心得能与大家分享了，希望能有大佬给出更多的游玩攻略。",1610380086,1610380731,True,79,3,0.870232105255126953,0,False,False,False,False,,,

After the first level all the monsters become sword sponges, and I cannot get past level 4, which is a boss I have gone against about a half dozen times, and there is nothing you can do to beat this thing from what I can tell other than pure cheese. 

Having your stats reduced every single time you die, and the gear you find at the start not scale is also really annoying, and once it clicks that you're just running your head into a wall over and over, it makes you realize there really isn't anything here to keep you playing the game.

Pros that make it all worth it:[list]
[*] art style
[*] atmosphere
[*] combat
[*] progression
[*] crafting
[*] movement (for the most part)
[/list]

Cons that ruin your day:[list]
[*] everything in the “pros” column is designed and executed at 20-60% of what a great game would’ve had
[/list]

There’s a lot of irreverence to the design of Slasher’s Keep. Despite looking and feeling like a game jam demo cobbled together in 48 hours, it’s a finished experience with a more or less complete story, a random level generator (that glues premade rooms together), several playable characters, (awfully balanced) skill, progression, combat and crafting systems and a teeny-tiny soundtrack. 

One of the game’s best parts is that it barely goes beyond the basics of the very first level of the dungeon. I swear, it’s a pro even if it doesn’t sound like it. The game very slowly ramps up the complexity of gameplay, but the formula largely stays the same: if you’re overpowered, rush in and annihilate everything; if you’re not, use your wand, lure individual enemies out and spike them.

Some of the design choices are so bad that it boggles the mind: from innocent ones like the hideous font found on the stat sheet and on crafted weapons to far worse ones like the skill and stat systems where the balance flies out the window in 20+-level dungeons, to outright weird stuff like the enemy design: like, why the fuck do you fight loincloth-wearing naked molerats next to zombies, imps, goo balls and levitating skulls? Simply because the creator found the wordplay of them no longer being naked funny? I mean, seriously.

The thing is, all these issues combined cannot outweigh the sheer fun of spiking yet another zombie or shooting a chain lightning that jumps six times and clears the room, or smacking open a supply crate and finding a +30 to Strength Liquid Ember. Despite its many flaws, the game delivers way more fun than one could typically buy with the money it costs.

The art style is great! Straight up very well done, unique look. Inventory management and gameplay is easily understandable and comfortable. What i enjoy about the fighting part specifically is that you got to block manually, which means parrying into the swing; adds a whole lot of immersion and yea semi realism to the game. 
Now the negative sides that i experienced and the reason for refunding it; Missing enemy types! You mostly face up against the same 3 or 4 maybe 6 variations of enemys that are stacked into rooms, some are challenge rooms that simply lock you in to prevent you from escaping. Got a bit bored of fighting the same mobs over and over again, you need a bit diversity here! To the balancing, its probably alright. I finished up the first 3 floors and the system was always like ""start of each dungeon is kinda tough but when you catch up with the level and gear requirement it gets basically easy"". I was reading a lot about enemys overscaling too hard later on, i cant really say much to that but it could go into that direction from my feeling. Item creativeness is although really cool, so much different stuff: maces, axes, swords and gigantic bones, again well done here!

Overall Slasher's Keep is a decent game in its early state already and definetely an interesting experience. I guess its up to the individual player wether you burn out fast from missing variety or you catch the motivation and grind a good amount of time into it. I can definetely recommend it, it got a -25% sale right now so thats a good time to try it out.",1610053237,1610053651,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game has amazing potential and is one of the coolest roguelike games I've played, but constant bugs, cheap one shots that kill runs, and ridiculous enemy scaling is keeping this game from true greatness. 

Yes, you can make it through this game, but it is torturous - and not in a good way - in a ""why did my run end from a one shot I couldn't even see?!"" kind of way. 

The roguelike Loop is enjoyable too, but overly punishing in an attempt to artificially extend the length of the game. You loose 25% of your stats every time you die. That means you could work 20 hours to build your character, then hit a streak of bad luck and see all your hard work completely destroyed. ""But what about permanent perks?"", you might say. Well, most of them unequivocally suck or are ""build"" specific (e.g. things meant for Ranged builds over Melee). There are some REALLY good perks, but they are harder to come by. 

I do like punishing RL games. I have 174 hours in Dead Cells at Boss Cell 4, but this game has yet to find the sweet spot between challenging and tedious.

Schlimmer noch: Ich (als Spieler) weiß noch nicht einmal, wie ich dort hinein gelangt bin. Der Prinz hingegen weiß es schon, wird mir die Geschichte aber erst im Laufe meines Abenteuers zuteil werden lassen – und zwar immer dann, wenn ich ein kleines Stückchen weiter komme.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I81ScAUEy0

Und während wir noch über die Ungerechtigkeit dieser Welt sinnieren, tut sich plötzlich ein Weg nach draußen auf: Die Gefängniszelle fällt nämlich einfach um und lässt uns nach draußen. Jackpot! Jackpot? Von wegen: Die Zelle ist ganz unten, also in den tiefsten Tiefen des Kaninchenbaus, während der Ausgang ganz oben beheimatet ist. Das wäre an für sich nicht so schlimm  --- die paar Leitern hochklettern kriegen wir noch hin -- nur leider ist der Weg in die Freiheit von unendlich vielen Monstern gespickt, die uns halt nicht durchlassen, also zumindest nicht freiwillig. Und jetzt der Clou: wenn wir sterben, können wir keinen Spielstand laden, sondern müssen wieder ganz von vorne anfangen… 

Wem das Prinzip bekannt vorkommt, hat vielleicht vor 40 Jahren Rogue gespielt, oder irgendwas, was heute als so genanntes Rogue-Like durchgeht. Dabei ist das Ein-Mann-Entwicklungsteams namens Damian Schloter gar nicht sooo brutal zu Werke gegangen: Wer stirbt, beginnt zwar wieder in jener Zelle, darf aber trotzdem einen sehr deutlichen Fortschritt verzeichnen. Spiele solcher Art werden ja dann auch gerne unter dem Begriff Rogue LITE geführt, weil sie uns eine Karotte mit der Aufschrift ""Progress"" unter die Nase halten.

Im Detail sieht das so aus, dass wir für jede hinter uns gelassene Monsterleiche obligatorische Erfahrungspunkte einheimsen. Jedes dadurch gewonnene Level lässt uns drei Attribute (Stärke, Geschick, Intelligenz) mit je 4 Punkten/Levelaufstieg pimpen. Außerdem bekommen wir für jede zweite Stufe (oder so) die Möglichkeit, einen permanenten Punkt in eine Art Skillsystem zu investieren. Skills können zum Beispiel Schleichangriffe sein oder besondere Fähigkeiten im Umgang mit Zauberstäben. Eine komplette Übersicht aller Skills, die man in einem Run erhält, hat man nicht, weil diese bei den Levelaufstiegen zufällig vergeben werden oder durch Gegenstände hinzukommen. Ein permanenter Punkt auf einen dieser Skills bewirkt jedoch, dass wir den Skill(-level) nach unserem Ableben behalten – und das ist ein wesentlicher Vorteil. 

Auch von Vorteil: Selbst wenn wir sterben, behalten wir den Großteil der vergebenen Attributspunkte und verlieren „lediglich“ einen unserer Level, dafür geht allerdings die gesamte Ausrüstung hops. Aber selbst die kann man über eine Art Flaschenpostsystem an den nächsten Run weitergeben, wenn man vor seinem Ableben daran gedacht hat – man möchte hier also fast schon von einem Rogue Extra-Lite sprechen.

Rogue? Ausrüstung? Skills? Attributpunkte und Levelaufstiege? Ja, das alles klingt erstaunlich stark nach einem Rollenspiel und wer bei dem Erklimmen der Gefängnisebenen Assoziationen mit dem legendären Grimrock bekommen hat, liegt nicht völlig falsch. Falsch liegt man hingegen, wenn man von einem 90° tilebasierten Dungeon Crawler ausgeht – denn hier ist Geschwindigkeit angesagt: Grade wenn man einen Run mehrmals wiederholt, schnetzelt man sich mit einem Wahnsinnstempo durch die Gegnermassen der unteren Stufen und nutzt dabei Mechaniken eines weiteren Spiels – nämlich Dark Messiah of Might&Magic: Gegner können munter in bösartige Tiefen heruntergestoßen werden und sind dankbare Opfer für die überall verteilten Stachelfallen. Auch immer gern genutzt: Ein beherzter Schubser in eine offene Feuerstelle und unser Kontrahent kann im nächsten Fanta 4-Streifen als Human Torch sein Unwesen treiben. Wenn ich dieses Spiel also beschreiben müsste, würde ich sagen: Ein Mix aus Rogue, Dark Messiah und einem typischen Dungeon Crawler – nehmen wir einfach den besagten Grimrock her oder vielleicht das gehaltvollere Ultima Underworld, weil’s doch 360°-Drehungen mit Bitmap-Gegnern einführte – genau wie das hier vorliegende Slasher’s Keep!

[h1]Fazit:[/h1]

[b]Slasher’s Keep[/b] hat auf den ersten Blick nicht viel zu bieten: Die Optik kommt zwar im erfrischenden Cell-Shading-Look daher, mutet aber sonst eher skuril an, insbesondere sobald man bemerkt, dass die Gegner als 2D Bitmaps in der Spielwelt herumwandern (oder auch liegen), ganz so wie wir es noch aus guten alten Ultima Underworld-Zeiten gewohnt sind (oder wie bei Meridian 59, falls das irgendwer kennen sollte). 

Aber der Schein trügt: Ich hatte für schlappe 14 Euro ja schon lange keinen solchen Spaß mehr, denn das Spiel macht so verdammt viel richtig: Es lässt uns zwar ständig neu beginnen, aber motiviert ungemein durch den Fortschritt, den wir letztlich machen. Es wirkt irgendwie simpel, hat aber mit den ganzen Skills, den vielen Gegnertypen und den unzähligen Ausrüstungsgegenständen dann doch wieder Tiefe.

Hinzu kommen solche kleinen, aber feinen Mechanismen wie das Verschicken der Ausrüstung in den nächsten Run oder der sporadisch verteilte Händler – denn der ist einem klassischen Dungeon Crawler mitnichten eine Selbstverständlichkeit! Außerdem mag ich das Schmatzgeräusch, wenn sich unser Held Essen einwirft, um die Lebenspunkte zu regenerieren.

Wenn ich wirklich etwas zu bemängeln hätte, dann dieses: Die Leichen und auch alles, was man so zerstören kann (und das ist leider nicht viel), sind zwar mit einem Physikmodell versehen, aber das Ganze macht im besten Fall einen unfreiwillig komischen Eindruck, im schlechtesten Fall stört das Zeug einfach, weil man nicht gescheit darüber hinweg laufen kann und sich unsere Figur desöfteren irgendwie ""verkantet"".

もう少し、もう少し…とついついプレイを延長してしまうという
ローグライトとしての魅力はきっちりもっている

値引きなしのフルプライスで購入したとしても、確実に元は取れる品質だと思うので
おすすめさせていただきます。

I really wanted to like Slasher's Keep but unfortunately the combat is boring and clunky.
The controls and movements are way too floaty and unresponsive, it really feels akward to play.
The level design is not very good and the minimap doesn't help, it's a mess, kinda annoying to say the least...
Slasher's Keep also seems to be very unbalanced from what i've played...

Oh btw there's no keys rebinding while in game, it's also impossible to pause while playing, so have fun getting killed while your browsing your inventory or have to go idle.
Honestly i don't understand how can you release a game out of early access without these basic features ?

I'm usually very tolerant for indie titles but this one didn't worked for me.
I'll go back to Ziggurat 2 and Nightmare Reaper. 😉

It's not entirely garbage, i like the artstyle, creatures design and the musics but overall the experience is more frustrating and boring than enjoyable.
If you love fps roguelike and can tolerate clunky controls and boring combat maybe give it a try...

Do not let Slasher's Keep's cute charming exterior fool you, this is a fun, fresh, dungeon crawler that offers an addictive single player experience. Its combat mechanics are great. Beyond the close quarters ""slash, strike, and parry"" swordplay, wizard wands offer ranged combat and your environment offers the opportunity to ""Home Alone"" your enemies. In combination with procedural generation, looting offers replayability by ensuring you will never have the same load out twice. It is also great how you can bring looted components to a blacksmith and make your own weapons. In terms of difficulty, play throughs will definitely challenge you and the addition of a permadeath makes it all the more intense. The game's high level of polish and attention to detail, includes a genuine sense of humour too. I always crack a smile when my character audibly ""chomps"" bugs off the dungeon floor to regenerate health.

Art style, soundtrack, and game play offer a relaxing, enjoyable experience that deserves your attention. Really pleased with Slasher's Keep.",1609169539,1609169539,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The issues I have with this game is that you need to unlock the characters and customization and that with the system it uses, if you have the game set up incorrectly, your mouse won't align with the game, this isn't a problem really as all you need to do is set the game to your screen size, for me it worked with just using direct 3D instead but the reason I'm complaining about this is because my brother is an idiot when it comes to computers and when he played this (he uses a different computer) he was nagging me a ton to fix it. I also feel like there should be a teleport system in the game since running across the entire map to sell some shit is really annoying. I believe it would be a good idea to add an upgrade that increases your inventory size so this isn't as painful. I feel there should also be a setting to make it where you can find the weapons you made in chests or after bosses, or even in the shop. This game I would say is easily one of the top dungeon crawlers of 2020 and it has a simple move set, however there are a lot extra things in it, such as how the end lag on the super attack is extremely high on maces, and make using the super a more situational thing than normal so you only want to use it to finish/ one shot enemies. 9/10, would bang",1609154470,1609154470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The problem is not the combat difficulty curve or platforming, as this is clearly intentional.

The main problem is the physics of the game. You can try to walk up some stairs or navigate a room while being chased by enemies, but if there is an inch high bump in the ground u cannot walk over it. I understand getting caught on huge boxes that are placed purposely, but not the tiny fragments of the box that remain when u destroy it. It feel super janky to even move around in this game and feels even worse when you die because of something out of your control. For example, I sent some crafting stuff down the chute for my next run as i was looking for a handle for my mace head i found, got to floor 2 and somehow glitched inside one of the little metal cages that are sometimes around with a hollow inside. Couldn't get out, run ruined, lost everything. 

No problem, I caught up to where i was found some new good gear. Climbing the tower to my new personal best. Hit floor 6, enemies scaling hard now so I'm cautiously scoping out each room before entering. Oh wait, the metal doors closed on me and I'm stuck in a wall dying to skulls.

Once or twice is fine, i don't mind a few bugs here and there, in fact a lot of games wouldn't be the same without them. It's just really frustrating to lose all progress to something out of your control.",1609134587,1609134587,False,208,4,0.852960705757141113,1,True,False,False,False,,,

[*] NG+ is straight-up broken. I beat the regular dungeon, died at once in NG+ because I kept my health and had no health potions after the boss fight. Everything now two-shots me (and keep in mind that blocking timings are way more difficult because enemies attack way faster) and I can't level up because my character is stuck at level 13 and I can get like.. 20% of a level before dying.

There is quite a bit of content to it.  Lots of weapons, crafting system, procedurally-generated floors, assortments of enemies, and a variety of skill paths. Sure the graphics are not Skyrim, but its not meant to be.  It's almost like a paper-Mario style Skyrim really.

Pros:
+Lots of stuff to do.  Lots of floors, lots of gear, and a fun crafting system to make your own loot.
+Simple and gripping combat.  Its not rocket science but its fun and when you master it it makes you feel good.
+RPG Elements.  So there is a skill type system, that really doesn't let you customize too much as it really depends on what you get lucky enough to find to unlock.  But this adds a flair to the Role Playing aspect.

Cons:
-Skills system is RNG.  Some people will not like that, and it is understandable, though I kind of dug it.
-Graphics are simple.  Its not Skyrim, but it isn't meant to be.  Though I do like the goblin (orc?) pin up girl posters.",1608878170,1608878170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I don't often see something that badly designed in a game.

The control aren't fit at all for any kind jumping (to add more, you barely jump, get stuck everywhere when you jump like on platform border that doesn't make any sense, move somewhat slowly and doesn't have much air control, it's floaty, there isn't enough feedback), and the jumping puzzle are just annoying ""timed precise jump"" in long session when sometime harsh punishment if you fail at any point.

They break the pace of the game, they are way too much of them as they come one after another.

They aren't interesting or engaging. It's something you are forced to do to progress, doesn't feel any better than a timer in a free mobile game. Feel like it's here just to be annoying and that's it.

1. Mandatory platforming in a hack and slash. Why? Every single shoehorn platforming section in a game that isn't built around platforming always ends up frustrating and jank. This game is no exception. If it was optional I wouldn't care, But the exit is hidden behind 4 platforming sections, and you have to do the same section every run. 
2. Risk and reward. The game rewards you for banking all your good loot very early (when you are still in the 10-15 Hit to die range) and severely punishes you for taking risks. If you lose some of your staple equipment that you have been carrying with you you lose about 2 hours of progress due to the need to find gear that matches what you had lost. Additionally there is little to no reason to risk your good loot to push on and find maybe some better gear when you can just find that same gear earlier by forcibly banking and dying on purpose.
3. General BS. Dying to Broken trap textures/projectiles phasing through walls/softlocks has been the cause of my death on 3 occasions, and while 3 times in 20 hours and multiple runs isn't high, it is still very frustrating when you lose some late game gear due to something underhanded or completely out of your control.

To Surmise, if you buy this game I think you will have a fun time trying to beat it for the first time, but afterwards you will get run down and frustrated, not wanting to sink any more hours into it.

Get it on sale and it'll be worth it for about 20 hours of game play mindless enough that you can still listen to podcasts (if you do that).

The central premise is you start at the deepest part of a dungeon, start with almost nothing, and have to work your way up 10 procedurally generated floors (for your first playthrough; after winning once you can set it for more).  Between floors you get a little snippet of your character's story and motivation (there are different characters, but between the main two and one additional secret character I've played the only difference in game play is one starting skill), and at the end you confront the big bad who put you in the dungeon in the first place.  

Combat is almost entirely melee, with some wands providing ammo limited and anemic ranged fire for special circumstances.  The melee itself is somewhat Mount & Blade-ish, with directional parrying and a slow pace.  One annoying piece of jank is that the 2D sprites don't adjust to verticality well, so fighting enemies on stairs can mean either you or the enemy will whiff a lot.  I wish the player's range on their swings were increased slightly as I found the extremely limited reach frustrating to work around at times (not even with combat, really, but smashing pots and striking things on the ground).  You are limited to one hand weapons that range from fast and weak knives to slow and powerful maces (I believe they all have the same in-game range), as your other hand is carrying your inventory in a bag which doubles as your ""knock-back"" move.  You'll depend on this a lot when you're under-leveled as knocking enemies into spikes is an instant kill.  While it does make the game more immersive, as trying to get an attacker off you by smacking them with a bag is closer to your average gamer's irl defensive skills, I think the game would be well served by not requiring you to completely complete an attack with your weapon before throwing the bag out there.  Being an even-or choice means you'll either be fencing someone if your weapon is powerful or waiting for the right time with the bag if not, because using one means you won't be prepared to use the other in a more dynamic way.

For any rogue-lite, figuring out how to do progression is a key game design question, and here I think Slasher's Keep shines.  There are a lot of different skills, all technically passive but colorful, a crafting system, and of course the standard leveling and loot-grabbing.  When you are defeated, you get sent back to your cell and lose some levels, ability points, and any skills you haven't ""perma-learned"".  Skills are either awarded randomly on leveling in a run, or from the weapons you are carrying.  Periodically, on a level up you'll get a point to perma-learn or upgrade a skill.  But the best part is the item chutes on some level.  Throw an item down the chute and it'll be ready for your next run from the start.  While backsliding levels and items from a run of bad luck is possible, if you're smart and drop off weapons and armor as they you get better things, the early floors will become a breeze (but exp rewards scale with your level, so it's still worth having fun and going on a long killing spree before climbing).

There are three biomes as you climb, standard dungeon to start, aristocratic mansion at the end, but the second is maybe my biggest complaint about the game.  Artistically, it's more of a ""booby-trapped pyramid"" sort of feel, which already doesn't make a lot of sense compared to the other two, but no one really cares about the art style making sense with this sort of game.  The game play is very different for the middle floors, with traps *everywhere*, with swinging blades, timed floor spikes, and even some platforming (sometimes above said spikes, which do not insta-kill but are a very frustrating way to end a run if they do get you), all with enemies included.  There is no fall damage, so there is that, but it's a very different feel than what you thought you were signing up for after the first few floors, and honestly, I was always just trying to get powerful enough that I could get past them before I started enjoying myself again.  It's much worse if you're not getting great frame-rates for crisp inputs, as I wasn't before switching to a low graphics setting (which could be a complaint in and of itself: my machine can run modern Doom, albeit at a sluggish pace; I wouldn't have expected a repeat of that experience with game looking like this).

All in all, Slasher's Keep is impressive for a one-man operation, with some good ideas thrown in with its more obvious limitations.  Good for some non-serious time-killing.

Not that I'm complaining, I love those games.

Nifty lo-fi first-person-slasher roguelite. You're a prisoner in an orcish dungeon and you have to fight your way out from the bottom floor. Each time you ""die"", the orcs capture you and throw you in the dungeon, where you lose your gear and a level or two but get to keep your skills and any items that you hid in a drop-chute. There's a pretty major difficulty spike on the second zone, so odds are you're going to use this feature a good bit...

For a game made by one dude, it's pretty well put together. Physics and environmental collision detection can be a little janky, and once or twice I got stuck in a challenge room that I couldn't complete (I believe once the last enemy got stuck somewhere I couldn't get to, and the other time a healer enemy kept doing its heal aura after it died, making the last enemy invincible. Both of these were fixed by reloading the game). There's also no true pause function, so keep that in mind. Other than that, the polish is pretty high all things considered.

Pretty damn solid if you ask me. Definitely worth the price for a few playthroughs.",1608311458,1608311458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Instead you could rather just thrust at the enemies and run away then thrust ran at them and repeat you do more damage that way anyways and you knock them back but if you swing attack your gonna take damage. Also instead of parrying by blocking in the direction of where the enemy is going to hit you why can't you also attack where the enemy is going to hit to and by doing so countering that attack. Maybe the game can work on these things as I know it only came out not too long ago.

[list]

[*]There is a learning curve. You cannot win on your first try. You're going to have to learn the rules of this game's universe and how combat works, which is very different from most other roguelikes. Some tips I have if you've just bought the game would be to not concern yourself with winning on the current run, but how you can best prepare your future runs for success. This strategy lessens the crushing defeat of dying on ""the run"" to something stupid or easily preventable. Additionally, focus on surviving and minimizing damage taken rather than killing your enemy as quickly as possible. Taking time on encounters might teach you more about how to consistently kill something rather than trying to sloppily murder it and never attempt to parry.

[*]THERE IS SO MUCH IN THIS GAME. After beating the first ascension and making a new character, i was floored at the sheer upper limit on how many floors you can add to a run (close to 200!!!!), no pun intended. There's unique items that I haven't found yet, wand types I've never found, perks I've never tried, and honestly so many different permutations that I likely will never find, and that's a huge plus for a roguelike trying to break into an extremely saturated genre. They're all interesting, too, which is mostly a result of an extremely satisfying combat system involving dodging, parrying, knockbacks, consumable items, and interesting enemy design plus procedurally generated environments and traps that add peril and excitement to every room and hallway. The way permanent progression works with sending items down chutes to your future runs and permanently learning perks plus stat increases is very satisfying. If you really hate yourself, you can play a hardcore version where there's no progression between runs.

[*]This game offers something wholly unique in the roguelike genre and it's a first person perspective in a dungeon crawler. These kinds of games fell off in popularity and its a lovely setting that I hold pretty close to my heart. If you like games like Legend of Grimrock, this might be right up your alley.

[*]There are some minor annoyance I have with movement and collision, notably certain enemies explode or drop their body parts and they can actually prevent you from moving through them. The first boss of the game is pretty large, and one time its corpse blocked my from entering the next area because the dead body prevented me from being able to access the door. A minor grievance that forced me to reload a save, so nothing too major, but it can be an issue for some if you're unlucky. Theres also [spoiler] parkour puzzles... The game's floaty movement and jumping make for some frustrating moments when you fail these, and you'll often feel like it's no fault of your own. Just push through them and you'll get to the good parts.[/spoiler]

[*]I think the base types of weapons are cool and interesting. There are certain perks related to these weapon types and some are far better than others. My biggest grievance is how cool wands felt to use but how impossible it was to make them your main weapon. They have this DOOM-esque feel to them, where each magical element maps to a different type of gun that you can literally aim down sights with. You can snipe floating skulls from across the room with arcane magic, or shotgun a ghoul in the face with frost magic and it feels really gratifying, but they operate with a limited ammo system that places strict restrictions on how much you can use them. Perks can alleviate this, but not enough to the point where they become a main weapon to use, and I'd like to see this changed in the future.

[*]Spoilers on boss fights ahead. [spoiler]When you first load into the floor for the spider boss and fight them for the first time, it is an incredibly imposing feeling that you never really get to feel more than once. I feel like this was a missed opportunity further down the line, especially when I found that there was no boss for the second ""area"", and only at the very final floor would I find a new boss that I actually managed to beat on my first try (the gimmick for the final boss is environmental and not really reliant on having good stats or items). Maybe the masochist in me is wrong on this one, but more bosses and more difficulty could've gone a long way towards making each run build up to something engaging.[/spoiler]

[*] The sound design in this game is so perfect for what it's trying to accomplish. Slashing a ghoul's head off sounds meaty. Blasting someone with a frost wand shotgun is loud and impactful. The voice acted shopkeeper's timid and weird voice fits him so unbelievably well; it really does sound like a naked mole rat if it could talk. The soundtrack is filled with these plucky, mellow guitar strums that create this weird mix of coziness and tension, and each area has its own themes and instruments that really come together to create engaging environments that you won't forget.

Slasher's Keep is a game that, if given enough time and attention, might be something that you can end up sinking hundreds of hours into. It's a fascinating, unique, and charming roguelike in a genre that feels like everyone is trying to reinvent the wheel in. This game keeps things simple but changes up the base formula just enough that the final result is something special. However, it's not for everyone, and you're likely going to find that out for yourself after the two-hour refund time limit has expired. If you enjoy hand to hand Dark Souls-y melee combat, loot generative FPS games like Borderlands, or are just looking for a roguelike to consume some of your time, give this game a shot and it could really suck you in. There's no harm in trying out the base game for a few floors and seeing how it feels. You might really enjoy it",1607484827,1607484827,True,20,1,0.727136552333831787,1,True,False,False,False,,,

In this game, increasing your level is not treated as a reward you get for defeating difficult bosses, it's treated as an integral part of gameplay, requiring the player slog through every earlier level to get just enough exp to equip slightly better gear and actually have a chance in the RNG based level design. 

This game has a really low skill cap; once you learn to take every enemy in a 1v1, the only thing left to learn is how to bait every enemy into a 1v1. 1v2s are possible, but use the exact same skills you'd use in a 1v1, just faster. However, if you fight a group of enemies large enough to recharge their attacks before you can get a hit in, there's nothing you can do if you don't have any items. The possibility of getting swamped and straight up losing regardless of skill level is a frustrating aspect of this game that is largely luck (bad luck if the room layout is like that) based. You can, of course, win in these situations if your strength is high enough to one hit everyone, or if your dexterity is high enough to make their hits do little to no damage to you, but that's about it. 

Slasher's Keep also discourages kiting by making backwards movement about 1/4 as slow as forwards movement (sideways movement is about 1/2 as slow), and the lack of a skill tree in place of randomly receiving perks discourages players from playing with specific builds in mind. The combat is also somewhat bland. Wands will be massively underpowered until you can get to a higher level, at which point your build will be focused around melee weapons. There are a few different attacks for each melee weapon, but there is no reason to use anything other than a quick light attack. Given this information, you'll probably assume that combat will benefit the fastest melee weapon. 

There is one overwhelmingly good strategy; put all your points in intelligence until the amount of points you lose on death is equal to the amount of points you gained. After this, just put all of your points evenly into strength and dexterity, until you can equip better gear. This is the fastest way to play because points put in intelligence increase your exp yield and allow you to level faster. The game does not have level locks (situations where you are not allowed to enter an area because your level is too low) electing instead for gear locks--you will frequently be put in situations where you can no longer progress because your gear isn't good enough. This however, is an indirect level lock; any gear that isn't worthless requires a minimum number of points in strength, dexterity, or intelligence; this is a horrible yet deliberate design choice that forcibly slows player progression until they level up. 

Slasher's Keep took a steep skill curve and replaced it with a logarithmic grind curve and thought nobody would notice. It has a low skill cap; once you hit it the only way to get better is through increasing your level. It discourages different play styles by removing a skill tree and replacing it with RNG based skill progression. As a result, there is only one good way to play--put all your points in intelligence. Despite these gripes, I would be lying if I said the game was all bad.

Huge amount of effort and talent. I think this is a testament to how far the video game industry has come that one person has the platform/tools to do this.

Love the oblivion style combat and directional blocking. 

Many of the mechanics are well thought out. Particularly the shoot mechanic where you pass down items to your next life after you die. If you keep this mechanic in mind, when you die you can easily fly back through floors depending on how far up you get. I also like how you can lock any ability you find if you have a stat point. It allows you to prioritise how you want to play, although I feel you are strong armed into getting at least some life steal (the abilities Golden tongue and Deflect are game changers if you can get them as well). I also love that ultimately your mind is this strongest weapon in this game. Almost every combat situation, including bosses, can be defeated regardless of whether you have really good gear. 

The DIY crafting style is unique and fresh. Great idea that I hope gets fleshed out more, and taken up by other games.

I really love the janky, retro, highish fantasy atmosphere of the game that does not take itself too seriously. The music is a truely excellent component of this. I usually turn off music in video games which require a high degree of focus, but not in this one. The orc posters are a hilarious touch as well.

BE WARNED: this game punishes mistakes brutally and swiftly. A few of my deaths were from bugs (i.e. imps hitting me through walls etc) but i'm sure they will be fixed. It can be a very frustrating game at times, but it usually always rewards patience and planning. The traps in the game are your biggest enemy IMO. They hit extremely hard (entire health bar) if your gear/armour is under-leveled for the floor, particularly the black/purple orbs. Be careful! 


Suggestions:

IMO this game could really use a teleport system, similar to Enter the Gungeon. You spend a lot of time retracing back to the exit. 

Also it does suffer slightly from a lack of enemy types. I think there a 7 types off the top my head, with variations on the theme within each type. I would have really like to have seen a whole new class of enemy in each biome, or perhaps just more enemy types in general. More bosses would be amazing as well. On the way to the final boss, there is only one other boss! I hope he keeps supporting this game, or adds DLC. Would 100% buy it.

Also, i never really gelled with the wand system until much much later in the game when I realised how good kinetic wands are. The whole ammo system really put me off at first but i guess its necessary to balance it out. I think an added magic system with mana (which would be a very rare resource), independent of wands, could be awesome, from summoning lightening or fireballs with your hands, to weird quirky stuff, like creating ice patches on the floor for enemies to slide into pits or spikes, or turning them into chickens etc. 

Perhaps the combat is a bit too simplistic. The ability to crouch would be cool to duck under blows etc. Enemies with unblockable, but well-telegraphed high or low strikes could had an extra level of complexity to the combat. i.e. duck high strikes, jump over low strikes. A quick but short ranged side step with a hefty cool down would be a nice addition as well. The molerat's haymaker move only counter seems to be running around wildly or smacking with the sack. This side step would a graceful but rewarding mechanic I feel.

Anyway...

Overall, a very impressive game with bucket loads of potential. 9/10

There are soo many options and build paths styles to play that youll never be bored.

Yes!
This charming little dungeon crawler from Damian Schloter has pretty much consumed my last nearly two weeks. And I'll go over why this may be just the game for you or not. That's ultimately up to you to decide.

[b] What is Slasher's Keep? [/b]
Slasher's Keep is a first person dungeon crawler done in the style of old school shooters and RPG's from the 90's. Games like Doom, Wolfenstein, the Shining series and so on. You play a prisoner tasked with escaping through a dreaded keep to find your sister. This is accomplished in a roguelite style formula where you do ""runs"" through the dungeons levels gaining loot and leveling up your character. The ultimate goal is to gain enough permanent belongings and stats before you perish and must restart to give it another go.

[b] What makes the game unique? [/b]
The way the game handles its combat and it's progression systems are something we really haven't seen a ton of in modern gaming. The combat plays similar to Mount & Blade with targeted striking and parrying your opponents. You must learn their patterns and tackle each fight on their terms. Regarding the progression systems there is so much to cover, so I will simplify. You can both find and buy powerful gear for your character as well as occasionally gain enough materials to craft your own weapons. Every level you can increase your primary attributes of strength, dexterity, and intelligence. Every few levels you are able to select a skill you have gotten from gear to permanently learn (meaning it follows you into your next life as well) gaining momentum into future runs. I will also briefly note that the game contains way more content than your first ""completion"" will showcase. This is something those familiar with roguelites will be understand.

[b] ""Okay buddy, TLDR. Gimme the score and stuff"" [/b]
I highly recommend this game 100%.

I would say that Slasher's Keep, while rough in spots and far from non-janky, is one of the highlights in gaming this year for me. And if you aren't sure whether or not to get the game yourself yet after reading this. Do be sure to check out some of the gameplay from streamers and youtubers to finalize your choice. I personally am playing it on youtube and twitch, to shamelessly plug myself. Find me @PentaHybrid on all social media if you have interest or any questions on the game.

Took to long to type so heres a bullet list:
-Fun for the first playthough
-because of how stats are handled after you die and how xp gains scale with you, if you just keep throwing yourself at the game you are granuteed to win.
-1st boss, use a gimick to defeat it, still a neat fight
-final boss, would have been intresting if the npc didnt annoyingly tell you exactly what to do over and over again, also you cant damage her, you have to use a gimick again. Makes the fight just a waiting game
-the platforming sections only really deduct from the gamplay
-wands are only useful to get out of potential softlocks by enemies who fly
-honestly all of the flying enemies feel out of place for such a melee based game, all of them cause issues such as the skulls making you wait forever, killing streaks, and mosquitos flying way over ledges you cant reach forcing you to use a wand
-POST GAME CONTENT
-if you chose the same character its just back to floor one but the enemies do way more damage and has various bugs such as taking 32 damage but having to heal 270
-other characters are neat, but its still the same gameplay. the only diffrence is a single skill you get at the start and the ""story""
-hitboxes are all over the place, you can get stuck on the head of an enemy you kill and lose your entire streak.",1607230674,1607230674,False,0,0,0.447761178016662598,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You can replay the game, but there's really no point. You just get more of the same loot and fight the same enemies (which are again just variations of enemies from previous floors). There's a few unique skills that you can find on legendary/unique items, but they are far and few in between.

Crafting is cool. Parrying is cool when it works. The first boss was interesting to fight. The game is very charming. Skill system is interesting.

That being said, you almost certainly will encounter a game-breaking bug at some point that will ruin one of your runs.  The dev is patching this regularly though, so hopefully those become less frequent.  On top of that, there is a bit of first person platforming in the middle of the game, and it takes awhile to get the hang of it.  Once you've figured it out, you can breeze through it, but I strongly believe that no one actually enjoys first person platforming, and developers need to stop.

Otherwise, it's a great game; the original experience will probably take you 15-30 hours, and there's a good bit of replay value.  Definitely one of my favorite games of 2020, and one of my favorite rogue-lites of all time.",1607132269,1607534592,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unfortunately, there are pieces of boxes and bricks, etc on the ground everywhere so it becomes a major pain.

I dont remember how it was when I started but I think once you complete the dungeon then you can decide how many lvls you want your keep to be 10 to infinite and Im sure its just gonna be the same 4 different layouts.

I really hope this game gets more content and more dangerous enemies and more boss battles.

The RPG systems here are robust and there are a ton of different skills to mix and match to create a unique character. The way progression works is pretty unique: while there is a Permadeath mode that makes SK into a true Rogue-like, most players will want to play on Normal, where there are a couple key methods of progression. Primarily, you only lose a percentage of your money, stats, and XP when you die, so eventually you'll be starting your runs on level 10 with 20 of each stat, compared to 2 of each on a fresh spawn. The other big one is the item chutes: every floor after the first has a chute that will deposit items back in the room you start in. So basically, as long as you make it to a chute, you can always send back your second-best weapon to give you a big headstart on the next run. Combine all this with the fact that enemy XP rewards scale based on your own level, and after several runs on the same character, you will be steamrolling through the early floors one-shotting enemies -- which is still fun and rewarding thanks to the Combo system which rewards you with extra XP for killing enemies quickly.

There are some definite rough edges: the flying Moth enemies run away from you which can lead to very annoying situations where they can't be hit, the inventory management can be a pain thanks to the lack of a PUBG-style loot menu, instead you have to sift through everything on the floor, and there are first-person jumping puzzles, which I personally love but I've seen lots of people complaining about. The physics engine also feels endearingly janky, which can sometimes lead to you getting tripped up on small objects, and can make the jumping puzzles less fun.

It scratches that itch for dungeon crawling, player upgrading, and a great game play loop all at once. I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of rougelikes and rpg elements, it does have a little jank but nothing that isn't to hard on the player. I guess I should specify, there is points in the game where you require a silver key to progress, sometimes you will be on a floor for 10-30 minutes looking for it, you don't know if its behind the secret door which is on almost every level or on an enemy or what have you sometimes it takes a little longer than you would like and that may put some people off if they are looking to do a ""Quick Run"" that just isn't the game, its long, even on the smallest length dungeon which is 10 floors. After you have completed the game you have the ability to continue and even extend how far the dungeon goes, all the way to infinite. Now I really like this about the game but if you die in one of these post-game dungeons you generate, you might as well kiss that character goodbye as even the equipment you throw down the item chute for your next life will seemingly not be enough to balance out the difficulty. Some maps can be confusing and specifically the floors right after the first boss, and i think that this section is really the meat of your play through as everytime I've gotten to the next section after that its a cake walk to the final boss. I really enjoy the game and it may not seem like it but some of these things are kind of what gives it its charm.

But, as it stands, I think this is a good game that has a lot of potential.

Pros:
Has a fun amount of mechanical fun with the knockback and inventory sack mechanics, making terrain just as effective as a normal weapon, given the right ingenuity.

Killstreak mechanic means that skilled players can reap much better benefits with proper routing, and makes speeding through the early game feel like you're an insane adventurer whirlwinding through their initial escape.

Crafting your own weapon is very satisfying, and you can get attached to the PERFECT weapon that you want to keep around forever, making deaths a little more personal.


Cons:
The actual physic mechanics leave a lot to be desired, a decapitated enemies head poses the same physics as a gigantic barrel, in the fact that it stops you in your tracks and forces you to shove it.

The spikes in difficulty are a little too pronounced to feel good, i.e. going from area 1 to area 2, enemies go from dealing about 15% of your HP to 75% in one hit. Either armor values need to be bumped up in the later stages of area 1, or enemy damage values need to be toned down in early area 2. 

Wands are hard to like. Obviously the game is more worried about the melee, since it's SLASHER's Keep after all, but so far I feel like the Lightning Wand and Kinetic Wand are the only usable ones, the others just simply dont deal enough damage, have too low projectile speed, or are too inaccurate.

On top of the bugs, the difficulty curve between BEFORE the first boss and AFTER is a bit excessive. Enemies end up having enough health to make it tedious as opposed to challenging to fight them, especially with the hitboxes that can be imprecise at times.

Lastly, platforming wasn't a great choice for this game. There's no drop shadow and the player hitbox tends to get stuck on the edges of platforms; alongside the relatively imprecise movement controls, this causes you to slip off of platforms more often than you should.

[b]THE GOOD:[/b]
[list]
  [*]Stylish, faux-retro look. A little janky, but ok for an indie game.

  [*]Pretty nice variety of loot, both in stats and in looks.

  [*]A large amount of skills to choose from.

  [*]Pleasant soundtrack.
[/list]

[b]THE NEUTRAL:[/b]
[list]
  [*]A system that saves some of your progression on death. It's a standard idea in roguelites, but this implementation is balanced in a way that very much corners you into building a character over MANY deaths to amass some permanent skills and a good selection of items, which you have virtually no chance of acquiring in a single life.

  [*]Some skills are pretty much mandatory to succeed, while others just outright suck. It feels like the useful skills like blocking the projectiles, faster attacks or better crafting should be either a basic mechanic or much more readily available.

  [*]Stats are heavily skewed in usefulness towards strength. Intelligence only modestly boosts your XP, and dex is an outright scam, only useful as a prerequisite to equipping stuff.
[/list]

[b]THE BAD:[/b]
[list]
  [*]Very harsh difficulty spike mid-game to late-game, which makes you either play absolutely flawlessly (because otherwise most enemies just two tap you), or, as mentioned, grind your character to the point when you have superior gear, stats and skills, and you can still lose most of that in an unfortunate death.

  [*]Melee combat gets repetitive very quickly. Slash-parry-counterattack, slash-parry-counterattack, slash-parry-counterattack with an occasional bash against some enemies. Yes, you can instakill enemies with a bash into spikes, but they are not always readily available.

  [*]Wands pretty much suck balls. Even worse, investing skill points into making them better doesn't even pay off that much, they still remain bad with how little damage they do, how little ammo they have and how underwhelming the effects of most of them are.

  [*]AI. Boy oh boy, is it terrible. I'm not talking about the enemies being predictably stupid and getting stuck all the time in various props, I'm fine with that, since it's a low-budget game. I'm talking about the intentional design of some flying enemies that either just back off and hang above a deadly chasm, unreachable with melee (remember, wands suck), and lobbing infinite shots at you. Nothing is less fun than being locked in a room, trying to lure a bug into a melee range or waiting until a flying skull finally aggroes on you.

  [*]Level generation in general. The rooms get repetitive quite soon, which makes the gameplay stale and boring. Some of the rooms are pure bullsh*t (like a spiked ceiling one), especially the first time you encounter them. Quite frequently you need to find a ""secret"" just to complete the floor, which makes absolutely no sense. Do you know what a secret in a video game means? It means optional content.

  [*]Some of the ""secret"" content in this game centers around jumping sections with timed platforms. And OH MY GOD, this is the worst part of the game bar none. Not only the jumps feel floaty and hard to control (you can still get used to that), the collision physics are pure garbage. Get ready for your ankles or head to get clipped in a platform, which results in starting over. That, coupled with a terrible platforming room design can just make you stuck at a jumping section forever. After several dozens of attempts on one such a room (which was a mandatory ""secret"" one), I just had to uninstall.
[/list]


In summary, this game still feels rough, unbalanced and kind of barebone, like it's still in early access, and I was surprised to discover that it was in released state.

[h1]————————————[/h1]

[h1]当第一人称遇到复古画风[/h1]
《Slasher's Keep》是一款第一人称的地牢逃出游戏，光看宣传画面你就可能被那独特的画风所勾起兴趣，而实际进入游戏，绕是你再有防备，也会再次被那画风给震撼到。

无论是精美的3D建模类游戏，还是经典的马赛克风格，第一人称游戏的画风大多都为两种之一，而像《Slasher's Keep》这样夸张的美漫式卡通风格，确实较为少见。给人眼前一亮。

玩家在地牢中遇到的怪物就像纸片一样，只要你行动够敏捷，就不能发现，它们真的只有一个面。这种奇特的设定，一下子就能勾起一些接触过早期PC单机射击游戏的玩家的回忆。

[h1]当第一人称遇到roguelike[/h1]
《Slasher's Keep》的地牢逃出，是以roguelike形式进行的。玩家每次复活或者重开一场游戏，都将遇到与之前不一样的配置，怪物，装备，道具等等。而与常规roguelike游戏注重每局的局内构筑这一特点不同，《Slasher's Keep》更多在于第一人称的战斗技巧上。装备技能种类没有特别多，但是真刀真枪的劈砍却略有门道，轻重攻击、劈砍、直击，不同的攻击方式需要玩家反复练习，熟练的操作相比随机的奖励来的更加靠谱。

[h1]当第一人称遇到手感不适[/h1]
《Slasher's Keep》最大的问题，是让我萌生了我真的逃不出这个地牢的心累感觉。首先过近的视角让我产生了一丝不适，游戏中移动后退都算不上灵敏，或者说作为一款第一人称游戏，过于笨重，而在我与怪物周旋快速转动画面，又或者在巨大又昏暗的地牢中到处摸索时，又加重了我视角的不适感。（能玩绝大部分3D游戏的我，在这个游戏中幸运的晕3D了）。

同时游戏新手引导方面做得不是很好，现阶段都要靠玩家自己去摸索，作为一个很有想法的独立游戏，游戏中很多东西都显得与常规不太一样。比如一开始房间墙壁上挂的钥匙，只是一个装饰，而真正路线的牢门，根本不需要它。我表示真的，很累。

Good combat mechanics for sure.

Not sure how much content the game can give, since I haven't beat it yet, but I imagine there's plenty since it's a roguelite.

Not so quick synopsis: If you like roguelites and haven't played dark souls, this game is still probably for you. It starts off throwing you into a dungeon while you learn to parry attacks and hit enemies slowly, but as you get used to the game the killstreak system turns it into a more fast-paced fighting loop. You will find yourself often taking hits because you want to get an extra hit in so you can keep your killstreak going. But, you can still play as slowly as you want if you prefer that playstyle, or you have some items you don't want to lose. 

There's quite an interesting thing that puts this game aside from most other roguelites: your character doesn't die. Unless you choose to play permadeath, you only lose stats, levels in skills, gold, and items on death. From this point you can work your way back upwards from floor 1, but you'll be stronger every time you respawn. This makes it easier to get back to where you were last time you died, as well as a form of permanent progression. There are also levels in skills that you can permanently upgrade every now and then. 

I'm not yet sure how 'beating' the game will affect the permanent progression, or if there even is an ending in the traditional sense.

Overall rating: 9/10 - This is definitely my favorite game of 2020 so far. 
Recommended players: Anyone who likes roguelites, anyone who likes RPGs, anyone who likes fast-paced fantasy combat.

Update: I beat the game and got to new game +, which looks promising, but you die in 3 hits to the weakest enemy in the game. This is a game where you constantly fight hordes of enemies. I'm having trouble getting even 25% of a level-up. Haven't made it past the first floor. Not sure if I'm a fan.",1606634012,1606790416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Please pay no mind to the droves of crybabies who can't handle VERY simple parkour/jump puzzles. The game does NOT become akin to a platformer at any point, there are just a few parkour ""puzzles"" in the second dungeon that are quite literally the easiest I've seen in any game. If you've ever completed a Minecraft adventure map or had to crouch-jump to get somewhere in Garrys Mod, you will have absolutely ZERO trouble with this parkour. That said, I do feel the puzzles are a bit out of place and in their current state are a relatively shallow addition to the gameplay. I for one would be happy to see more difficult or complex jump puzzles if the mechanic is going to remain a staple. 

I LOVE the Rogue-Lite nature of this game. Upon death you're sent back to stage 1 and have to start all over without any of your equipment, but you retain the majority of your levels, skills, and cash. You also have the option to drop items down an Item Chute located somewhere on each level so that when you die or start a new run, these items will be in the crate that spawns in your prison cell. This allows you to really invest in your future runs and make sure that each run is better than the last. This game is NOT designed to be beat on the first try, and that's part of the beauty of it. 

The visuals are not going to be for everyone. As someone who just barely missed the boat on games like Morrowind and Doom, I love the modern take on such a genre. I could never get into any of these older games because they just felt too dated for my feeble, born in '99 brain to handle. This game brings back that feel with slightly prettier graphics, more fluid gameplay, and without the cumbersome narrow FOV. 

There's two storylines. As of now I've only played & completed the Northerner story, and I found it fun albeit a bit simple. Hard to fault when you've got a one man crew. The final boss fight is very clever and I had a good giggle at the reverse-psychological dialogue from Prince Bindrick, but I was actually disappointed to discover that you can defeat him in 15 seconds flat by whacking the pillars out from beneath his balcony. I know that this is the theme of the game considering the earlier spider boss is melted in her own burning placenta, but something in me yearns for a genuinely challenging boss fight.",1606633919,1606773864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You get caught on everything even stuff that is not there. The spider fight is just broken and so buggy its almost impossible to melee. The game is otherwise pretty ok its just not there yet. Not quite good for a rogue crawler. If this is what is considered ""Good"" then games are just sad now. go play Rampage Knights and tell me this game is any kinda good yet. Once they figure out mobility a little better i can give it 3-5. Fix getting stuck all over the spider boss and teleporting over its head and then it teleporting into the ground  for no reason and i might just change this to a thumbs up and 4-5 it.

Revised review after 17 hrs
 Still don't thing this game is much good. So many clipping issues, enemies clip through walls and floors making the game just annoying. you get stuck on EVERYTHING including knocked over cups on the floor and 1"" high exploded barrel bases. there are many other things to get stuck on for no reason too. like the air sometime i swear it. so many time you swing and miss for no reason and they hit you for even less reasons then none. unless firing blanks and bugged out enemies constantly was part of the RNG plan this game still needs work. 

20hrs in, Game contintues to be trash, jump mechanics are extremely bad and buggy so why not add jump puzzles? um ok this is just stupid at this point why are there so many jump platform rooms when the game barely can handle walking without clipping into nothing? Do the devs not understand this is just bad for the game. FAIL

23hrs in, I uninstalled the game due to jumping puzzles. these puzzles get larger and WORSE as you go deeper into the game. They are SO broken and annoying i had to uninstall the game. But i beat it multiple times and thats good enough for me.

You start off in a jail cell, push your way out to the first chest and get your first weapon and a random assortment of low level gear. As you work your way through the first level, hacking and slashing your way through giant mole rats and zombies, you slowly start collecting better gear, whacking enemies into traps like spikes or chopping at a wooden pillar to crush them with barrels, or whacking them with your inventory sack to knock them off a ledge. When you die, you will end up back in that jail cell and you will slowly level up your character, getting more stats and getting through the levels faster and faster. 

I'm only and hour and a half into it and this rougelike is way better than most of the others I've played. Others that offer up different weapon drops like Gunfire Reborn feel too repetative in their level generation, so while it's addictive, you'll see the same few tunnels over and over again. This one's level generation is very unique and more spread out from what I've seen so far. There's levers to unlock doors on the other side of the map, buttons to lift bars blocking doors. Almost two hours, played the first level about six or seven times and never once did i see the same room twice.

肉鸽类游戏最近这几年是越来越火，前有死亡细胞、以撒，后有 Hades等，一大票优秀的肉鸽游戏。然后今天这个游戏有点不一样，这是个第一人称的肉鸽类游戏，还有地牢爬塔等元素，听起来很不错的样子，具体是什么样的呢？

[b]个人战斗而非策略[/b]

大部分肉鸽类游戏中，个人技巧的熟练度所带来的加成远不如道具装备搭配所带来的收益。例如死亡细胞，虽然手残拿神装还是该躺的地方一样躺，但是容错率会高很多，虽然比不了大佬但是神装带来的游戏体验还是很不错的。然而这款游戏完全不一样，因为是第一人称而且装备道具的数量并没有太多，所以个人战斗的技巧性要求比较高。掌握一定的战斗方式可以极大的提高游戏体验感，一味贪图神装是没有作用的。

[b]随机性[/b]

说到肉鸽，那么不得不谈的一个点就是随机装备、道具和地图。这一点本作勉强可以说及格了。虽说装备道具不多但是地图超大，而且 3D 的第一人称，特容易迷路。不知是不是迷路了，游戏过程中有碰到过死路的时候，着实有点糟心。

[b]种种小缺点[/b]

首先，这个游戏是颜控的灾难，务必听劝慎重下手！且不说可以说是粗制滥造的建模，这一点在第一人称中会被放大很多倍，导致游戏观感不佳。不过，游戏画风还是挺独特的，也可以说有格外的一种风味吧。

然后就是手感问题，无论是跳跃、攻击、躲避……几乎所有的动作都透露这一种僵硬感，说不上难受但是手感着实是糟糕，往往失误都不知道到底是手感太差了还是手感太差了还是手感太差了。

The secrets in this game that take you outside of the map to find keys and hidden areas are really satisfying to find, some people might be annoyed that there is a chance puzzles and secrets must be found for any progression to be made, not just for goodies, but once you solve them once they're all pretty similar until you move to the next biome/world.

Momentum issues, when walking sideways you can't walk fast enough to get up the top step on most stairwells. Have taken a lot of unneeded damage because I dare turn too soon or face my enemy when walking to block their attacks.

Update: Controller support needs A LOT of work. I frequently have to go into my inventory and adjust things because the quick swap from wand to weapon doesn't always work. Sometimes I'll be stuck with a wand in my hand that's empty and have to run from enemies while I try to figure why I can't swap weapons. I open it and it turns out the item is pregrabbed, but I shouldn't be able to grab items when my inventory isn't open. Maybe remap it so swap isn't on the same button as drop.

Slasher's Keep is a very weird rogue lite with a lot of mysteries and intended jankiness. The art style looks hand drawn similar to Archer (tv show) and everything is a jpg. Your arm, dead bodies, loot, all have a hand drawn look and is 2d. It reminds me of older games in aesthetic, like in classic doom where the dead bodies are just images of them at different angles. You and everyone in the world is 2 dimensional in a 3d world. Feels like I'm playing someone's dnd campaign.

Gameplay: First person dungeon crawler like elder scrolls but with high rpg mechanics like attributes and skill points with a traditional leveling system. But the gameplay is very difficult, enemies are strong, and there is tactics! You get a melee weapon, ranged, armor, and your bag. Weapons and loot are semi randomized, they're scaled to the region. Your bag isn't though, it knocks back and stuns opponents which plays nicely with the many spike walls, traps, and pitfalls. I'll do three swipes on an enemy, realize I can just hit them with my bag and impale them on spikes. It makes me feel clever.

RPG Mechanics: These are somewhat superficial, you level, get 4 attribute points and sometimes a skill point. Attributes are strength, dexterity, and intelligence, everything else is dictated by gear. Strength raises damage, dex raises crit chance, int raises ranged damage and exp earnings. Very standard. The variety comes from your skill points, as you get gear and level you'll get perks but they're temporary until you invest your skill points in them. Once it's learned with a skill point it's yours even if you die. Then you can invest more to level it. You get some neat stuff like this like thorns, when enemies hit you they take a portion of that damage back. 

Progression Mechanics: Skill points and where they're invested are permanent. Items thrown into item chutes pop out of your starter chest when you die and respawn, the rest of your items disappear when you die. You lose a level sometimes, but you always gain at least a couple per floor so it's a net gain. Some attribute points are lost, I think it's just the ones you get from potions that raise stats, then 1 from each, still a net gain. But I would like to keep them all, besides the gear, I understand gear being lost but I worked to reach those stats.

Customization: Doesn't really matter since it's a first person game and you play alone. But you have 2 starting races, Northerner and Amazon, but you can unlock more. 

Difficulty: Permadeath is an option but the enemies scale significantly with each floor gained. It feels so much so that you need to play on Normal if you want to beat them game at all. But I'm sure you'll see someone beat it on permadeath one day. Easy mode disables achievements and unlocks, don't like that. It feels like you're punishing people for having different skill levels. Let people play how they want and don't punish them for it. 

Other than that, Normal feels difficult at first but as you learn how the game works, how it thinks you should play, adapt, and learn your playstyle it gets much better. Difficulty is right where it should be but I feel like it would be better if we could change our difficulty or add and remove modifiers between runs. Like add an easy modifier, make it -25% gains and loot quality, disable it for normal, then add that but for hard versions. Permadeath chosen at the beginning is fine though.

Overall: Slasher's Keep is fun and challenging, a problem people have with rogue lites is that if you're allowed to improve your stats the game gets easier each run. I think in spite of this SK still remains a challenging experience. I'm enjoying it a lot and I love the art style. I don't like how when you die you just flat out respawn at the beginning of the dungeon. It feels too abrupt, like I need a cooldown period. There should be a room where you can view your stats, see everything you've unlocked, stuff like that, then you interact with a something and it respawns you on a new run. 

If you can handle the difficulty and the janky aesthetic then you might really enjoy Slasher's Keep. If this is your first rogue like game I'd suggest starting elsewhere like Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy.

Souvent, pour avancer, il faudra compter sur vos échecs. En effet, rapidement, on tombe sur des ennemis trop balaises. C'est là qu'intervient la mécanique essentielle du jeu : mourir vous fait perdre quelques niveaux et votre stuff, et vous recommencez au premier niveau. Grâce à la sauvegarde de certaines compétences acquises en cours de jeu et en planquant votre stuff (que vous déposez dans des ""chutes"") vous allez petit à petit trouver le parcours de plus en plus simple. Au départ ce système est déroutant, mais il s'avère au final excellent. C'est un plaisir de construire son personnage et de recommencer le donjon à chaque fois avec un personnage plus fort, une meilleure connaissance des ennemis et des pièges. 

Il m'a fallu plus de 30 heures pour terminer le jeu. J'ai l'impression d'avoir galéré par rapport aux autres mais ce n'est absolument pas grave car je me suis vraiment amusé, je me suis jamais ennuyé et je n'ai rencontré aucun bug (j'en ai vu signalés sur le forum mais il faut croire qu'ils ne sont pas si fréquents que ça ou que beaucoup ont été résolus depuis la release officielle). 

Enfin, plusieurs fins alternatives et des classes de perso supplémentaires sont déblocables, assurant au jeu une bonne durée de vie.

So..

The platforming:
- I've seen over a dozen reviews complaining about the movement of this game but if they are talking about the platforming puzzles or falling in insta-kill holes they are probably complaining just because they are mad they died to a hole or just really suck at platforming. The puzzles that require jumping aren't nearly as hard as they describe it and the game does not in any way trick you into falling into them via platforming or puzzles, it's literally their own fault. 
-There's really only one actual problem with the movement in this game. Items that are destructible (barrels and potion crates) can be a nuisance sometimes to just move around or over them. While I'd classify this as janky, this is more of a slight inconvenience.

The Combat:
-Some reviewers talk about getting stuck at floor 5-ish and hitting a wall in their progress. This is intentional, since you're supposed to eventually die in order to progress in this game. If you never die, you don't scale fast enough to keep up with the enemy scaling throughout the levels, so you have to die in order to scale more efficiently when you come back. A bone you could pick out would be that this kinda sucks sometimes, however, that's why there's an item chute to conserve your progress.
- I've seen some complain about hitboxes and I have honestly no clue what they are talking about, either you are close enough to hit them or you move out of range, I haven't seen any disjointed hitboxes or any of the like and all the projectile hitboxes are telegraphed and fair. A valid complaint would be  how punishing this game is. You get hit while trying to scale or preparing to set up a god run and you will likely be almost dead if not entirely oneshot (depends how deep you are). Personally, I see this as more of a risk-reward mechanic where the deeper you go the better the gear and the stronger you are, but eventually you will likely want to drop that gear off to you next run when you start feeling like you're made out of paper.

I saw some other review that claimed the dev wasn't going to update the game more and that it hasn't changed at all since 2018, though if they looked at some previous patches or read the devs last statement, they probably wouldn't have claimed this. The game has gotten a several content updates (with bugfixes) since January. Also I'm not going to guess what they will do, but the dev did say they'd stick around for the game after the official release (you can read this on the official release update announcement). 
Besides, its strange to cry out slow development of a game when its made by a single dev.....

The Big Issues:
-An actual problem are bugs, Ive seen room gens that have the flying enemies that stay up until they replenish their ammo. This is typically not an issue since you can smack them when they come down to restock, however, very rarely will the room generate this ammo orb out of your reach or even out of line of sight. While ive still made it past a couple rooms like this (I've only encountered 2 in my playtime), this can soft lock players if they don't have a wand or props to move around in order to reach higher places. Additionally, you can lock out enemies from rooms that seal the exits after you enter if you maneuver properly, which led me to actually prevent myself from beating the game once since I managed to do this to the final boss.
-I'm surprised i haven't seen anyone talk about the unlocks in this game being underwhelming, i have unlocked most of the characters so far and the only gameplay difference between each character is just their starting permanent perk. The problem I have with this is that I expected a different kind of playthrough with every character, but that isn't really the case since one perk isn't nearly enough to change how someone would play the game. In fact, I'd argue most perks don't really change how you play the game, they just make you stronger, which in of itself is a complaint since you look at other rogue-likes where perks are a much bigger deal. The story bits for every character is pretty neat and that does make me look forward to progressing more floors to hear the story, but I wish there was actual gameplay variety.

I don't blame most reviewers, the game is incredibly punishing if the enemies have out-scaled you. This game isn't anywhere near perfect and most criticisms are entirely valid, though I've had alot of fun with it (and this game has charm). I just wanted to refute the few that weren't.

You'll be fencing, throwing bombs, finding loot and learning new skills - all of which is good fun, at least during the first few levels. But after the first boss, the game becomes brutally tedious. The number of enemies increases and they start hitting like tanks. One flush hit will cost you about 50% of your health and sometimes you'll be cornered by 3 or 4 enemies without having a possibility to parry every attack or escape. This is due to the janky movement PITA physics. You see, your character has a tendency to get stuck on crates which are below your field of view (meaning: you'll run into them, because you can't see them - pretty annoying, when you're trying to evade enemies and 9 times out of 10 you'll die because of it). 
There are some truly AWFUL platforming puzzles too. VERY few games get 1st person platforming right, and ""Slasher's Keep"" definetly isn't one of them. Even moving around is janky and awkward, jumping, however, is hell. 

It's too bad: This game has some cool ideas, but most of them simply aren't implemented that well. It has those environmental kills that made ""Messiah of Might and Magic"" fun but pushing an enemy into spikes is awkward and unintuitive. Ranged combat is underwhelming. There aren't any cool synergies like in other roguelites - instead there's even more grind than usual. Now, of course, you could try to ""git good"".

But every time you die you come back stronger and learn new things like how to properly time your blocks or not staying on top of a camp fire. 
The game encourages you to look for secrets because sometimes the only way to progress is by going through the secret area which at first took me awhile to figure out. I really like art style and the combat system paired with the old school dungeon crawler look but fighting can sometimes get awkward because of the hit box and some of the enemies being out of reach so you have to sit and wait for them to come or you're gonna have to lure them instead which can get tedious in some rooms.

A few tweaks on the  collision (like broken boxes and heads) like a severed head on the ground should not stop you dead on your tracks. Buffing the wands will make this game even more enjoyable imo. My only gripe is the map layout, maybe make the map clearer because it looks like the walls are pathways if that makes sense. With all that being said give this game a shot or at least give it a follow because it feels like with some few updates this is going to be one of those games where you say ""one more run"".

Once you get near enough to the second half of the game, it introduces silly, and quite frankly, unnecessary platforming. It feels wrong because it doesn't suit the rest of the game and almost ruins the experience in my opinion. Some of it would have been acceptable, sure, but not when it isn't the core of the game and hasn't been developed properly. It's not that the platforming is particularly difficult - it offers a challenge, but nothing overwhelming - it's that the jumping to the platforms is just fundamentally broken and bugged. I've gone through platforms, I've experienced jumps not registering, as well as platforms just throwing me off them entirely. I appreciate this is a one man band developing Slasher's Keep, I just wish there was a little more done to alleviate some of the annoyances with the jumping/platforming. A quick floor can very easily turn very lengthy because of this, thus ruining the flow of the game.

I would go so far as to say it is the worst I've ever seen, but I still recommend it, because everything else about Slasher's Keep is just downright stellar.

Hardcore dungeon crawler with a simplified Mordhau type combat system that will challenge the core of your existence you will be scarred sh!tless to peak into a next room / corner especially if you progress further where mobs can kill you in 1 or 2 hits.

If you die you will lose all your items and some levels but since you will start at the beginning after death you will be eventually slightly stronger everytime you get to the floor you died in. So you shouldnt be discouraged to buy it. All of us will get there to the end some faster than others though.

Afterwards its a bit of a chore. You lose 25% of everything when you die but you can send equipment back to your next life.

And levels 1-3 this is mostly true. Level 4 is a bossfight, always. Levels 5 and beyond suffer from poor level design where this is far far far more traps to worry about than actual monsters to kill, thus levels 5 and beyond the killing and exp gain slow down dramatically.

Also there are a lot of very strange collision issues where your character will get hung up at random times. Rounding a corner? Get hung up. Random debris on the floor? You're gonna get hung up.

 [*](+)Lots of random items and skills for replayability
 [*](+/-)Combat is tactical or repetitive depending on play style
 [*](+/-)Cheap price but limited scope
 [*](-)Tedious jumping puzzles
 [*](-)Some annoying features and bugs
[/list]

I recommend this game to anyone who
[list]
 [*]Enjoys randomly generated loot and dungeons
 [*]Wants interactive and skill based combat
 [*]Is fine with losing progress on death but still maintaining some meta-progress
[/list]

I [b]do not[/b] recommend this game to anyone who
[list]
 [*]Does not like losing progress
 [*]Expects a large and lengthy game
 [*]Hates jumping puzzles
[/list]

[h1]Aesthetics[/h1]
[list]
 [*]Art style is flashy and unique
 [*]Music is catchy, varied, and does not grow stale.
 [*]Sound effects are cartoony yet unintrusive
[/list]

Vibe is cartoony; don't expect immersion.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
[list]
 [*]Swift light attacks
 [*]Directional heavy attacks
 [*]Directional blocking
 [*]Tactical knock back for environmental kills
 [*]Limited ranged combat with wands and throwables
[/list]

Combat can be varied and [b]tactical or repetitive[/b] and stale depending on playstyle.
Combat [b]can grow stale[/b] over multiple playthroughs.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[list]
 [*]Randomly generated item properties, attributes, and appearances
 [*]Robust skill system gained through equipped items but permanently unlocked through with ""permanent skill points""
 [*]Death loses some player stats and items that are not saves but progress can still slowly be made with permanent skills
 [*]Optional permadeath mode (for those roguelike fans out therre)
 [*]Traders, shrines, and secrets
 [*]3 environments to explore and about 5 types of enemies with up to 6 variations of each
 [*]Sometimes [b]MANDATORY JUMPING PUZZLES[/b]
 [*]Everything annoyingly body blocks you
[/list]

[b]Limited in scope[/b] with only 3 environments and a handful of enemy types (but with different variations of each).
However, [b]enemies and environments are well crafted and varied[/b].
[b]Jumping puzzles[/b] are long and frequent throughout the middle dungeon layer and are frequently mandatory.
Body parts, chests, barrels, and crates along with their debris will stop you from moving and will become increasingly frustrating to move through.

[h1]Quality[/h1]
[list]
 [*]As of right now, still has bugs that can crash the game or softlock your run
 [*]Bugs are rare but extremely frustrating.
 [*]Bugs are steadily being fixed by the developer
[/list]

Some players find the game crashes or that they cannot start the game. These types of bugs are common in every game.
The beta branch of the game offers workaround in case of softlocks.
Overall the quality of the game is fine.",1606431487,1606431487,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Some bugs I've encountered
1) Move to the next level, and after loading in I immediately fall over dead with no enemies/traps around (this has happened 3 times so far in 7 hours, ending my run each time) 
2) Enemies suddenly dishing out insane amounts of attacks with no cooldown or windup
3) The game features a directional parry/guard system, with enemies telegraphing attacks. Their ""recoil"" animation when you hit them takes priority over the windup animation, meaning while you're attacking enemies they can be attacking you with no telegraph or swinging visually
4) Being sky-rocketed by physics objects into pit-falls (which instantly kills you (and this bug is extremely common))

There are just some very odd design choices too. Some of the enemies like blood-moths split into parts when killed, but the gibs and pieces are physical and physics enabled, meaning you can get stuck on the severed head of a goblin and it can block a doorway - but the bodies themselves aren't physical, just the giblets, which is just so odd of a choice.

Everything else is just so unique and fantastic, but just marred by the lack of polish; but because this is a rogue-like and most of the bugs end up killing you just as much as the enemies, I just cannot recommend this unless it gets a little more polish; again, this is otherwise a [b]FANTASTIC[/b] game, it just needs to be put back in the oven for a few.",1606430330,1606430388,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,False,,,

有幾點讓我厭惡 :  
1.無鑰匙BUG : 所有敵人清空，箱子全開，一把銀鑰匙都沒有

2.因為是隨機生成地圖，所以會有必須跳躍的地形，但是某些跳躍的地形距離過遠，你無法跳過去 (兩倍以上跳躍距離)

3.打贏最後BOSS 有時無金鑰匙掉落

4.通關70樓後，常常遊戲出錯，無法繼續第2輪 (死檔，我死了3個檔)

5.某些高樓層使用魔杖時會發生無法使用，並無法掏出武器

It has one of the most satisfying progression systems I've ever experienced, where you permanently learn skills that you find on equipment. You can focus on a select set of skills (or even just 1 skill) to form a build, or just learn everything to become a sort of well rounded monster. It's really satisfying.

Dying is cool too; you don't just start a new run like you normally do in games like this. You respawn back at the start with the same character, with all of the skills you've learned still in tact. You also lose a few levels, but you only lose 75% of the stats you gained from those levels. So every time you die you start from the beginning of the dungeon but you're stronger than you were previously. You can even send equipment down the dungeon for your next run, if you're unsure about succeeding in your current run. There's a permadeath option for those who want the true roguelite experience as well, so if you really want to start from scratch every time you die, you can!

+Cool visual style. Enemies and levels look interesting. The levels come in 3 different visual styles which represent your depth in the keep.

+Lots of randomly generated equipment.

+Randomly generated levels.

+Adaptive difficulty. Make it as hard as you want by pushing through levels or just make yourself OP by throwing all your stuff down the chute and intentionally die (or use the trapdoor on permadeath). You'll lose some levels and stats, but on floor 1 with most of your accumulated stats, levels, permaskills, and equipment you'll be a god.

+Crafting that offers better weaponry than you'll find off of enemies, provided you get lucky enough to find the parts for the weapons. The crafting also lets you visually make the weapon look like any kind of monstrosity you want... which is nice.

+Skills that make a difference, and skills that aren't just +dmg or +defense. The skills in this game can geniunely change the way you go about playing a run.

+Good audio. I can tell what kinds of enemies are around me by the distinct noises they make, and the player character audio is very different depending on the race you're playing as. I have no opinion or knowledge of the music in the game as I use my own background music.

+Good storytelling. Each character has a story that is revealed to you as you progress in the game.
+Enemy design is on point. You have to stay on your toes and adapt to the situation based on what kind of enemy mix you're facing. Some are melee, some are ranged. Some leave acid on the floor, some give buffs to other enemies. Some charge at you, and some are wielding more than one weapon, etc. etc.

+No time constraints. You take as long or as short a time on each floor as you feel like. This might be a negative to some, but I strongly prefer a choice over a forced timer.

+You determine how many floors there are. You have to have a minimum of 10, but it can also go crazy high.

+""Hidden"" rooms that you have to go out of your way to open. This may involve just hitting a switch, lighting braziers in enemy-infested rooms, or finding a code for a codelock. Sometimes this is necessary to progress, but generally it's just a room or set of rooms with a higher than average loot value.

+3 different weapon types: the fast sword, the balanced axe, and the slow mace. Each plays quite differently and each has many skills that benefit it. The difference between swiping enemies faces with a sword in-between parries, and sprinting into enemies with a charged mace is massive.

+Reasonably priced.

+Haven't experienced any crashes mid-run (see cons).

[b] Cons: [/b]

-Crashes after the last boss seem common and it may or may not affect achievements and unlocks. It hasn't for me, despite crashing, but the forum suggests that it has happened to others.

-Bosses are not super interesting, and there are way too few of them.

-The mid-floors (not the first, nor the last variations of the three) are way too trap and platform heavy. I'm not saying this simply because I hate the traps, I just think they should be more spread out. You essentially go from no traps or platforming sections to having them in almost every room, and when you get to the last 'biome' you return to not seeing platforming or traps again. Depending on how you feel about traps and platforming you'll either love or hate the midsection and feel the opposite about the other sections.

-No modding support.

-Value of items at vendors when selling is a bit simple. The strength of the item seems to matter considerably less than what floor you're on. Say that you carry a sword from floor 1 to floor 20 and then pick up a much more powerful sword on that floor. The super powerful sword should be worth way more, right? Nope. They're pretty much worth the same amount.

-The level generation isn't 100% reliable. It can sometimes generate levels that simply cannot be completed. It sucks but given that you're supposed to die often anyway... it's not a dealbreaker.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[*] Innovative Rogue-like, surprisingly polished, very replayable for different builds/stories/dungeon sizes, progression oriented (even in permadeath), neat crafting, awesome permanent skill learning system, and an overall charming indie game.

[b]Cons:[/b]
[*] If you are a min-maxer, you may spend way too much time on a level selling gear, some insta-kill instances can be annoying, and potentially punishing for unskilled casual players.

[b]Would like to see:[/b]
[*] Slasher’s Keep is fun mechanically to play, but enemy types should vary more. Instead of throwing the same flying cockroach at us, it would be tremendously cool to see a slightly deadlier upgrade visually (aka maybe a gray color with spiked carapace, similarly to how the spider got a black widow variant), or instead one could always just add more common enemies into the game to give more artwork diversity/gameplay experience.

[*] Much like like desire for more enemy variance, more skills would be welcome too, like perhaps some new game plus skills or perhaps just like 10 new skills to play with. 

[*] A lack of storage for items, perhaps there could be a storage box at the smithy or elsewhere that would allow you to store items/components for your current run that of course gets wiped when you die. Alternatively, there could be a permalearnable skill for increasing inventory slots. 

[*] More breakable objects, like regular boxes/barrels/tables. Some more room variations could be cool too.

There might be more to what ought to be added, but this game is really a gem that deserves some more attention, if not at least as DLC.
If you are interested in a challenging, yet engaging progression rogue-like, you ought to enjoy this beyond just a new game excitement high 👍",1606387918,1606387918,True,1,0,0.515625,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've made it to ""act 3""
And let me tell you, this game is simply amazing.
The combat is intuitive, you really need to pay attention to where you are, where you're going.
Because in 90% of cases, it's your fault if you died.
The crafting system is something i've never seen before. 
You get to design your very own weapon? Take my money
Enemies fly away when you hit them with your sack? Take my money
It's heartbreaking when you die after crafting the ultimate weapon? TAKE ALL MY MONEY

Only thing I would like to point out is that sometimes the range of weapons/ hit box can be way off and I hope they fix it soon :)

Thanks for making a great game. And if anyone wants to see me play I stream on twitch @ https://www.twitch.tv/verifiedmental

Looking forward to hear/talk to other Slashers!

The combat is very fun and engaging, if not clunky. There are lots of little secretes to find and there is so much loot you wont know what to do with it. The art style is also great once you get used to it.
It however falls flat in some key aspects.
Right off the bat the punishment system is bad, just bad. I understand what they were going for, but having a flat 25% 
loss in skills/lvls/money is not the right way to do it. Just 1-2 bad runs can make you loose so much progress. 
The horrible level scaling only adds to it. There is no way you are going to gear up or level up enough in your first couple of runs to even make it past the first 3-4 floors. You need to progressively get stronger and stronger with each run, saving equipment and weapons in order to get past the harder stages, but that is so counter intuitive to the degradation system, because  each time you die you lose progress.

ネガティブなレビューは4階のボスの強さや、5階からの敵の強さの異常とも言えるインフレ具合を指摘している。

以下、購入を検討している方への参考として述べるが、ネタバレを含むので注意されたし。

このゲームはローグライトだが、ゲームオーバー時にすべてを失うというものではない。

・主人公の強さ
敵を倒すことで経験値を獲得し、レベルアップする。レベルアップ時にステータスに自由に割り振れるポイントを獲得する。
死亡により、ペナルティとしてレベルが下がり、その分のステータスも失うが、以前のレベルに到達するまでは経験値ボーナスが付く。

・アビリティ
装備品にはアビリティが付与されているものがある。基本的に装備している間だけ有効だが、一定レベル毎に得られるアビリティポイントを消費することで、永続的な主人公の能力として習得できる。また、さらにポイントを消費することで習得したアビリティはランクアップできる。これらは死亡しても一切失うことはない。
前述のレベルの仕様と合わせ、屍の山を築き上げあげることで主人公はより強い状態でスタートできるようになる。

・アイテムの引き継ぎ
死亡時、装備しているものやインベントリにあるアイテムは全て失われる。
しかし、2階以降に出現するダストシュートにアイテムを放り込むと、次回のプレイ時、最初に用意されているチェストからそれらのアイテムが手に入る。
より良い装備が手に入ったことでお下がりとなった装備品を放り込んでおくと、次周のプレイが楽になる。

・武器製作
3階以降からフォージのある部屋が出現する。
剣の刃、鈍器の頭などの「ダメージを与えるパーツ」と、武器を持つために必要な「柄となるパーツ」を組み合わせることで製作可能。その階層で入手する武器よりも、その階層で得られるパーツから製作した武器の方がはるかに強い。ボスの討伐にあたっては、失っても良い装備でボスの動きを把握したうえで、製作武器や良質な防具を持って挑むと良いだろう。
また、製作した武器はフォージにてパーツに還元もできる。貴重なパーツを使いながらもお下がりになってしまった武器は、売ったり捨てたりせずダストシュート送りにすると良い。

・戦闘のポイント
＞パリー
右クリックでのパリー(防御)は敵の攻撃方向に合わせる必要がある。最初に遭遇するであろうゾンビ的なザコ敵がそれをよく教えてくれる。真正面で相対するとして、敵が右手で殴ってきたら、自分は武器を左手側に寄せて防御することでノーダメージと
なる。ソウルシリーズのようにジャストタイミングである必要はなく、防御しっぱなしで問題無い。
右も左もない、正面からに見えるような攻撃は正面向きで防御すれば良い。
＞Fキー
アイテム袋でぶん殴ることで敵をノックバックさせるというユニークな攻撃。数秒のクールタイムあり。ダメージは無いが、行動を中断させたり、スパイクにぶつけることで即死させられる。並んだ敵をまとめて吹き飛ばしで串刺しにすることも可能。
スパイクなど効かなそうな、硬そうな鎧を着込んだ敵も例外ではない。


私はこのゲームをサムズアップとしておくが、序盤の印象が良くとも、5階以降の難易度にモチベーションを維持できるかどうかで評価が分かれるだろう。
死にゲーといっても、ソウルシリーズのように死んで攻略法を見出していくゲームや、ローグライクのように死にながらプレイヤーの経験値を積み重ねて行くゲームなどがあるが、このゲームは死んでキャラクターを強くしていくゲームで(も)ある、という点について、購入を検討されている方は留意されたし。",1606358514,1606358514,True,48,0,0.843047857284545898,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The reason for the negative review is that it has a mandatory jumping puzzle, with temporary platforms on level 7. I've tried it over and over, but I can't get the timing down. I hate first person platforming, and if I had known that I would have to do it, in order to progress, I would have never have bought this game. This is a gamekilling problem for me. 

I even tried ending a run on purpose, and when I got back to level 7, again, mandatory platforming puzzle. 

There are other issues I have with it, and I'll detail them below:

1. You have no melee attack whatsoever, if you lack a weapon in your hand. Normally not an issue, but I purchased one weapon that had a specific skill on it that disintegrated my weapon after 8 hits. And it was a boss fight, so had no weapon to fight the boss with. Seriously?

2. There are frequently mandatory secret areas in floors. Either you need to use them to get to the exit or the silver key is in the secret. Also, not sure why, but using the copper key is considered a secret in the first area, before the first boss, but isn't a secret in the second area. 

3. Sometimes due to RNG, there is no Chute on levels 2+. 

4. Not sure why you can't put a forge or vendor on the first level. More often than not, I have more items than bag space, waiting for me in the starting chest.

5. Why you can't upgrade the bag space at all. You run out of space constantly. 

6. Why wands have so little charge and why there aren't spellcasting. 

If the developer made these jumping puzzles entirely optional, I would likely give the game a positive review. However, having secret buttons or mandatory access to other parts of the floor, gated by a jumping puzzle, requiring very precise movement, makes the game cruelly hard. Maybe with enough attempts I might make it, but I'm giving up on it now. Up to now was enjoying myself. But I despise mandatory first person platforming, and its the only reason why I haven't bought Doom Eternal, because again, hate the platforming.",1606357890,1606357890,False,0,1,0.43810155987739563,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[hr][/hr]

Un jeu excellent, cela faisait un petit moment que je n'avais pas autant aimé un jeu au point où j'en oublie de me coucher.
Certaines ""races"" commencent avec des skills spéciaux (la capacité d'avoir plus d'emplacements d'objets utiles au craft des armes, des dégâts accrus lorsque vous sprintez, des ""sneak attacks"" faisant 25% de dégâts de plus, etc.)
C'est un roguelite sympathique avec une progression intéressante, la mort fait reculer légèrement la progression mais elle est quand même généreuse :
[list]
[*]Elle entraîne la perte de quelques niveaux d'attribut (force, dex, int)...
[*]...Mais on recommence dans les niveaux les plus bas du donjon avec des attributs accrus par rapport au commencement.

[*]L'équipement de départ est aléatoire : une arme aléatoire et une autre pièce d'équipement aléatoire (jambière, casque, anneau, etc.)...
[*]...Mais il est possible d'envoyer de l'équipement plus performant dans le début du donjon à l'aide de trappes situées dans les niveaux supérieurs (vous sentez les objets craqués que vous pouvez envoyer à votre futur vous qui aura succombé face à des tas de monstres et des tas de pièges ??)

[*]Vous perdez une partie de votre argent à chaque mort...
[*]...Mais ce sera toujours un pourcentage ce qui vous permet d'avoir un max de pognon pour la prochaine run si vous la jouez finement !

[*]Vous pouvez crafter des armes qui sont en général bien plus puissantes que celles de base, des fois même plus puissantes qu'une arme bleue ou violette ! (""Mais c'est nul si j'perd tout à ma mort, il y a pas d'intérêt.."")...
[*]...Et vous pouvez les garder pour vos runs suivantes si vous envoyez ces armes au début du donjon avec le système de trappes dont j'ai parlé plus haut ! Vous avez crafté une superbe épée ayant pour joli nom Durandil ? Si vous sentez que vous ne réussirez pas l'étage suivant, n'hésitez pas à l'envoyer dans une trappe !...
[*]...En parlant de ce système de craft, il est tout à fait possible de démanteler une arme précédemment craftée, il faudra juste faire un clic droit dessus une fois dans la forge et vous récupérerez toutes les pièces !

If you deposit them, they will be available for your next run should you fall in the dungeons.  Some skills you gain, you can perma as well so you don't lose them when you die.

Your character has a few stats and an inventory system.  You use and wear what you find in the dungeons, most items having stat requirements to use them.  Crafting and magic are available too if you don't want to hack and slash your way through.  

Fights are fun, being able to block most monster shots if you time and block the weapon as it comes in at you.  Plus you can use the environment too.  You can push monsters into spikes, traps, or off into pits.  In fact, sometimes its the only way to survive a bad situation...

Things that hold up well are:
1. Permanent stats crossing over btwn lives making slow progression possible even with a few bad runs in a row
2. You lose levels and stats between runs - so multiple bad runs in a row can really knock your progress back a bit. While it sounds bad at first, it's actually added a new layer to the game and does something that other rogue-likes fail at - it forces each run to matter. In Binding of Isaac or Hades (my most played games in this genre) , when I was having a bad run I'd just sabotage it or quit and start a new one. I'm motivated to actually keep the run going and try to squeeze out a few more levels in EACH run now so I don't get hindered too much. 
3. Swordplay feels good, and the parrying dynamic works real well too. 

Cons:
1. Level design - I've only reached level 3 so far, so there is a chance the level design might change at higher levels but so far the level design has stayed the same for levels 1 to 3
2. Enemy variety - same as above

Random loot from all enemies which make all your runs different,  also you can bank your items for your next run and  if you die you  start with them.

Visually appealing indie dungeon crawler. I wish the parry mechanic were a little easier to utilize in battle (especially playing with permadeath on), not to mention a better, easier to read map/mini-map. Of course, these are just personal preferences and neither really impact the game greatly.\

 I also don't get why the game continues to play when paused when it is a single player experience. I have bathroom issues and had to run to the restroom, left the game paused, and came back to find the one bug I couldn't reach to kill did me in.

Personally, its worth the $10US I paid for it, but not something that has me by the balls demanding I keep playing.

The crafting never came up in the little bit I played, not a common component early on at least, but I didn't have the patience to sit through another run after losing stats (Yes you lose stats on death, permanantly, and you retain your level so you have to work harder to get those same stats back.) to enemies that were standing ontop of each other, so stacked into the one doorway I had walked into, that I couldn't move.

It just feels like it's still an EA game, and from the sounds of it the developer dumped the baby out with the bathwater here, just publishing it and bailing out on any sorts of fixes.

I barely got an hour in and I'm begging for a refund. The game crashed when I tried to close it. It's that bad. Clicking ""Quit to windows"" caused the game to crash. How do you even do that?",1606300728,1606300728,False,1,0,0.444486886262893677,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is atrocious.

Huh the game? Ain't ever had the pleasure to play an early access title like this. It is seriously polished with just issues to understand its not in its final state. I'd that months won't fly lower on a higher axis is the issue, and that some flying enemies just stay in the air not attacking you.

The polished gameplay? Combat is simple and fun, its got a parry and charge attacks, can you seriously over power your self and earn it and just swing around the level trying to get a high kill chain going.

The UI design is overall very well done. Gamepad navigation UI needs refining but making a game ain't easy and so making the decision to purchase an early access game.

I'd if this wasn't early access buy it. I'd say if you are genuinely interested in this game buy it in early access state. If not you'll just end up coming back once it fully releases, if your interest is still. If it is buy it.",1606278863,1606278863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Very bad balance ruins fun and make game just about grind.
Why? Well, every next level just add about 70% to enemy DMG and HP. Your gear progress much much slower. Only way you can beat it - lvl up and die, because you loose very little on death. 
Boss is also very stupid. You can beat with 4 grenades or put it in acid areas. Your weapon is almost useless, because you can't dodge or parry boss attack.

[b] Summary: [/b]  
 
Slasher's Keep....yeah it's sorta taken a bit of my time. I'm the indie guy who tries to cover as much as I can, so I've got a lot of games at 2-3 hours. Slasher's Keep has dug under my skin, decided to live there as much as Hades on the Switch has, and well I find myself still wanting more of it. There's definitely a formula that Slasher's Keep follows that keeps the addiction going: including a variety of interesting skills and items that make different characters and runs interesting, and a core combat system that gets accuracy of melee combat right in so many ways. All the different systems that Slasher's Keep synergize together to be something that I didn't want to put down.

There's so many things to praise. The rougelite elements, specifically the way that you level and keep levels on death (some of them) and in particular sending gear down to your character when he restarts is fascinating: it leads to important decisions on whether to push forward with the gear you have, possibly losing it, or stop right now and throw everything you own down to your new character. Permanent skill learning leads to interesting build types like an blood slurping axe murder or a swordsman who focuses on cutting off heads that turn into explosive bombs. Crafting system is cool with the hilt/gems/swords system, and it all helps that the combat is a good back and forth, rewarding precision. 

The story is probably the thing that lacks here from the character portion, only occurring between levels, although the environmental storytelling isn't that bad honestly (the orcs having pinup posters is a hoot). 

Look, see that play time? Go look at all the other games I play, and all the types I play. I play a lot of different games and genres. Slasher's Keep found itself being my overall gem of 2020. That's saying a lot, and well, it'll serve you well.

[*] I'm unsure if Slasher's Keep or Crack Cocaine is more addictive. Granted I've only tried the first, but I'm going to go with it.
[*] Combat System is precise: not blocking with your sword in the right way will get you slashed, and it feels natural in the progression of attacking, blocking, and trying to deal with multiple enemies.
[*] Skills are reasonable and yet a good mixture of old staples (lifesteal/crit) and some really interesting ones (decapitating exploding heads)
[*] Rouge lite system is actually a great balance and leads to risk/reward mechanics that can undo a few runs with a bad decision, but rewards smart decision making.
[*] Enemies AI is good and yet can lead to some hilarity, but will challenge you. Good leveling and progression.
[*] Weapons have a real weight to them, all of them feel different and require different play styles. 
[*] Have I said addictive? It's addictive.
[*] Sound design is great in general, and music while repetitive is also pretty great.
[*] Good enemy variety for the most part, even with repeat enemies that have a twist. 
[/list]

[b]Negatives:[/b]
[list]
[*] Could have done a little more with the storytelling elements.
[*] Once in a while you get a level configuration that ends up you needing to find a secret in order to get to the next level. 
[*] That right now I want to play it more despite the fact that I have other games to cover right now.

I love the very unique and unusual art style of the game which makes it feel oldschool and kinda cartoonish light hearted but depressing at the same time. The fighting is simple but still challenging and there is lots of Weapons, abilities and items. There is a high replay value since every run feels actually different. Also i love the progress systems which i have not seen before like sending items to your next run with the chute so you start with an advantage and the permanantly unlockable abilities. Also the crafting mechanic is very nice since you can actually design your own weapons. 

I would love a few more enemy types, a few more or craftable staffs and some kind of backpack or similar to be able to expand your carrying abilities but other than that this game has everything I wanted. My indie game of the year!

Hacía rato que no me atrapaba tanto un juego de este estilo, no tengo críticas fuertes, así bien hay bugs, no hay nada que te distraiga de tu objetivo, de avanzar avanzar avanzar. Querés craftear? podés! Querés entrar a una mazmorra? podes! Tenes ganas de encontrar formas ingeniosas para matar monstruos? podés! Te gustan los desafíos que no te sacan las ganas de jugar? este juego te da eso! 

El juego tiene esta estructura:
1. Comenzás la partida
2. Avanzas hasta donde podés
3. Juntás items y leveleas al personaje
4. Tratás de enviar items para tu próxima partida (una mecánica hermosa que te obliga a pensar a futuro)
5. Morís y sos penalizado
6. Comenzás la partida nueva utilizando lo que pudiste salvar

Esto no te asegura un avance constante, pero sí te pone ante una curva de dificultad que depende mucho de las elecciones y del tipo de juego que haga el jugador.

En pocas palabras: es un juego hermoso que recompensa el esfuerzo, y que no busca frustrarte para nada, cada partida es un aprendizaje que suma para la siguiente

I would expect on average for people to sink in around 5-10 hours of gameplay before all the little physics and hitbox annoyances make you lose interest. based on the gameplay i have experienced (up to floor 5 out of 10) i would give it a 70/100.  The concept is great, visually unique, it has depth and variety but it also feels  a bit janky and the gameplay gets repetitive. Basically its a good game that doesn't quite have the flawless feeling, endless fun factor that top tier roguelikes (isaac, risk of rain, ftl, rogue legacy, spelunky, slay the spire) have.  If this game gets regular updates and or the dev makes changes based on community feedback i think it has quite the potential to be killer.

Pros: 

   - Art style - very unique, original feel

   - depth/variety - so far, a decent amount of enemies, weapons/armor, trinkets and map variety.  Tons of unique skills you can inherit on your character allowing for different play styles

   - weapon customization - fun feature where you can collect different weapon parts and create your own weapon with unique stats and skills based on the parts you use.  you can also ""build"" the weapon, moving around and rotating the parts you use to make the weapon look as badass or as funny looking as you want

   - Combat - combat feels pretty smooth, is easy to pick up and has a good amount of variety to it

   - character leveling/skill progression - as you level up you add points to attributes, to increase your stats, and you gain skill points to permanently inherit skills from unique weapons or armor and upgrade the skills once permanent.  

Death/respawn - when you die you keep most of the character levels, attributes and gold (i would say you lose around 20% of both upon death), not enough for it to not feel like you are losing everything and just starting all over (see cons for the negative side to this).  the game also has a chute feature where you can send any inventory item (consumable, weapon, armor,  trinket) back to the start for you to use from the start when you die, allowing you to semi-breeze through the first few floors.


Cons: 

 - janky movement/ enviornment -  controls are fine, but movement over and around objects feels off and you get stuck on things that you should be able to walk over (exploded barrel parts).  Along with this, there are destructible and movable objects, potion crates and explosive barrels can be broken/destroyed and yet regular crates and barrels are indestructible, only able to be pushed around, get in your way and falling in front of doorways (stupid shelves).  it feels like everything movable should also be destructible, otherwise rooms and areas just feel (and are) too cluttered.  

 - Wands seem way under powered - not much to explain here but i have almost never used my wands, except to see what they do.  and when i do use them it usually ends with me taking more damage than i would have, had i just kept my melee weapon out.  It may have to do with the limited capacity to shots, but also just the damage seems so weak in comparison to a melee weapon.

   - Item stacking on ground - When you say open a crate or kill an enemy that drops multiple items, everything stacks on top of each other, often glitching inside of the open chest/ dead body and it is nearly impossible to hover over/ move around and see the items on the ground, meaning you have to either pick it all up and drop what you don't want, or if your inventory is full, drops items out of your inventory, pick up items from the ground, look at the stats, keep/ drop items you want, then pick up the items you dropped (i don't mind having to do inventory management, its more just the fact that i have to do it just to see the items).  

   - Hitboxes - it may be due to the 2d/3d fusion paper mario-like art style but the hitboxes of objects and enemies feel off.  sometimes for example it takes me like 6 swings to finally make contact with, and break open a pot if my character is not literally humping the pot.  when it comes to enemies, depending on the angle you are trying to hit them at, you can pretty easily whiff an attack that looks like a spot on hit (usually due to stairs, items, other enemies or camera movement)

   - minimap - I feel like the map is too small, making it hard to see where the key points are and where i want to go.  i feel like the minimap should be more zoomed in and have a large map you can open up to.  Also just something about the style of the minimap makes it hard to see where exactly the doors are in relation to the walls/rooms (hard to explain, might just be me)

- Parkour map post floor 4 - There are around 40  perfectly timed jumps in a row and you have about 2 seconds in between jumps to make the next jump.  In concept this is not that hard, and it is passable once you try enough, but due to the physics and lack of a jump that give you really any vertical, you often get slowed by a wall or have your jump input eaten, causing you to fall all the way back to the start.  For me, this section really is just a nuisance and frustrates me when i get there.  Although i will say at least for the first 10 floors i believe this only shows up twice, which is not as bad as i had initially thought.  (from other reviews it seemed like every level after that would just be riddled with these types of puzzles) 

   - Repetitive - (Edited) The difficulty scaling at first is very high, and requires a lot of trial and error and frustrating losses, but as you progress and become more confident with each floor, there is less and less resetting needed to get further.

   - Losing progress -  when you die you lose everything (item-wise) you did not stash away in the chute.  Because of this you need to farm and stash away second set of items in case you die.  this seems fine, except for when you are trying to strengthen you character by resetting runs aka stashing all your best items and restarting to get more gold and consumables/ weapon parts in order to be strong enough to progress.  If you accidentally die while doing this, you lose every item you have and almost all of that progress is lost, all of the gold you spent on top of the line equipment is gone,  and depending on how much you were grinding, you lose ALOT of time/progress.  I accidentally fell off the edge while looking at the minimap, speeding through the beginning few floors after resetting about 8 times in order to prepare myself and get good armor and weapons for the big boss and it felt like i lost hours worth of item progression. (small kind-of niche con but thought i would mention it because it bugged me)",1606088613,1607014439,False,209,7,0.775251030921936035,20,True,False,False,False,,,

The art style is fantastic and really helps with the atmosphere.

I do have a few things that I think could be better or could be changed
1. Make intelligence and dexterity more useful (not just being used to equip equipment) They could do this by having dexterity make you run faster and intelligence making your wands more powerful.
2. I think the game needs more enemies to spice things up. 
3. More outposts like shops and smithies.
4. Make the skills more potent and actually change the way you play instead of just being a flat update. This would need a rework, but I think they could do it by say only allowing you to bringing 3 skills and then that can be upgraded by using three skill points on having more skills able to be used instead of upgrading skills.

Overall, I think slashers keep is a great game, but it could use some polishing and changes.",1606075674,1606075674,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a slow, and very simple game, with the majority of the action to be found in directional parries and sack tapping enemies into pits and trap like something from Dark Messiah: Might and Magic. There's plenty of loot to be found and a crafting system to be had, although I haven't had a chance to dabble in it myself. There's perks that you can learn from equipment like Path of Exile, with the ability to assign points and make them a permanent part of your build, along with RPG stat point standards.

Bottom line you like the spirit and pace of old dungeon crawlers with the look and feel of something more modern like Void Bastards then pick it up, its worth the low price.

The game starts off well enough. The graphics and music are pretty decent, and charming, in a retro sort of way. 

The combat, while nothing special, works pretty well. The melee, in particular. The AI is pretty dumb, but that might be a good thing, as we'll discuss in a second.

The game starts off easy enough. You find consumables that refresh health. You have ways of using the environment against the many enemies you'll encounter, which makes up - to some degree - for the fact that your weapons are fairly underpowered compared to the amount of damage the enemy deals.

Around level 4 or so, however, the game gets very hectic. Enemies start doing [i]ridiculous[/i] amounts of damage, and equipment become obsolete very quickly. I honestly don't know how people survive. Seems to involve a lot more luck that skill, most of the time. Good thing the enemies are dumb as heII, because I can't imagine how we'd get through them otherwise.

The reason why I'm requesting a refund, however, is the jump puzzles. Around level 4, you start encountering them, and they just suck the fun out of the experience for me. Have me figure out how to use the environment against a mob, by all means. But having to perform 20+ perfect jumps, in sequence, to get to the top of a tower, and get a key, when the character seems to handle like he's drunk, is not worth my time.

https://youtu.be/z2_rxNnbjpM [/h1]

Slasher’s Keep is a roguelite that plays unlike any other roguelite I have ever played and it has an extremely unique art style and overall feel.

The most obvious thing to mention with this game is it's presentation and artstyle. The game takes place in a 3D world but all the enemies and the loot you find in the game are 2D. 

So they do that you thing that you may have seen in other games do where the 2D sprites rotate to always match your perspective. And this gives the game a kind of unsettling vibe, at least to me because it makes it seem like every single enemy in the game is always watching you.

And so you start in a dungeon and you open a chest at the beginning of every run that will give you like 2-3 random items normally like some armor or accessories and a weapon.

You will be finding a lot of different loot so there is a lot of attention on the inventory system. You have a bag that can hold a certain amount of items by size and every item you find takes up a different amount of space and you can equip any items you have on your character. 

And one thing I really like about this system beyond it just being very streamlined and easy to understand is that if you mouse over an item like a helmet when you already have a helmet it will show you very easily if it is better or worse in various different stats so you don't have to get out a calculator to figure things out.

From there you than go from room to room killing enemies, finding new loot, leveling up, and trying to find the exit point to climb one stage higher in the dungeon to escape.

And the combat in the game is a little more rigid than you might encounter in other FPS roguelites but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing and I’ll explain.

So for every weapon you can swing it normally, you can charge attack in three different ways by holding different directions, and you can parry enemy attacks. So as enemies see you they will start coming to you to fight you and because the models are pretty much these 2D sprites they have to get really to close to you. 

So a lot of times you start getting overwhelmed by several enemies just getting right up in your face. And a lot of the enemies take a lot of hits in order to die. So in order to not get completely overwhelmed. You can actually hit enemies with your inventory sack knocking them back a little. 

And so the combat is a little more about timing your attacks and blocking the enemies and overall just very spacing focus. You can’t let the enemies start overwhelming you right up in your face because otherwise it gets extremely hard to hurt them without taking damage.

Also the game knows it’s not this crazy action packed game and so the rooms you fight sometimes contain traps like spikes that you can hit enemies into instantly killing them or pit you can knock them into.

You also have wands which are the other major way you can deal damage. There are special ones but the one you will see the most is something that shoots these slow projectiles at enemies. And they all have a limited amount of ammo and will break when they run out. So you can’t use these too much because ammo is so limited and that is one of my minor complaints with the game of what I have played so far.

The other huge part about this game is it has a leveling up system very similar to an RPG. So when you get enough experience to level up you instantly get all your health back, you get a couple skill points, and sometimes new abilities. 

The game is definitely on the challenging side. I have played for a couple of hours in order to get a general feel of the game to make a review but I know for a fact that there is so much in this game I haven’t even scratched the surface of. So it’s definitely the type of game that you could play for countless hours to master and discover everything it has to offer.

So overall I would definitely recommend Slasher’s Keep to fans of FPS roguelites as long as you know it is a little less action packed in terms of high octane combat and more fleshed out in RPG elements like the inventory and character development side of things. Also if anything you should definitely get the game just to experience the really interesting style of the 2Dish sprites in the 3D world as it is really awesome.",1605985726,1605985726,True,1,0,0.488449901342391968,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Minor being issues with the controller, it's impossible to quick swap away from a broken wand with the B button. Avoid able with the right skills or setting the hot swap bar, but still irritating.
Lack of any tutorial or explanation for setting up the Y button or Hotbar, again not rocket science but irksome.
The speech volume is way too low and leaves the few speaking characters, mumbling gibberish to themselves.

The major one (that I have encountered) is with level generation.
It's still possible for the code to generate a map with no way of getting through, beyond killing yourself and losing everything.

A huge grind. And that's good. I originally bought this for its aesthetic and then refunded it because it was so grindy. Then I reconsidered and repurchased it because in retrospect it was just what I wanted.

So a couple of points. 

First off, the aesthetic. If you've ever played Daggerfall Unity you know exactly what to expect (if you haven't, check it out, it's a blast). The characters are emphatically not 3D and everything looks hand painted. It makes for a charming, low key, and slightly goofy experience, especially once the blood (of which there are buckets) starts to splatter. The weapons range from silly to badass to ridiculous. Want a club made from bananas tied to a stick? A prehistoric stone ax? A classical xiphos? They're all there. Armors are the same: everything from fur to fop. There are even great decorations: come for the endless dungeon crawling, stay for the slightly disturbing orc pinups. 

Moving on to UI. It's a tad frustrating, to be honest. The keymapping, for example, is not intuitive and fixed. Want to draw your weapon by clicking the mouse? Too bad, press x. Your inventory is likewise fixed and cannot be upgraded, although this is part of another rather clever mechanic I'll get to later. Fortunately, everything is simple and easy to learn, so slightly frustrating is as far as it ever goes, 

Mechanics. This one is tough. Part of me things they're pure genius, the other wants to strangle the devious dev who made the decisions. There is no pause, but there is a save spot on every floor. The floors are small, but random and packed with baddies. Stores exist, but good luck finding one when you need it. You lose everything when you die unless you've deliberately sacrificed something to an item chute for your next run (truly, if you love something you must learn to set it free). The crafting system is clever, but in five hours I've found TWO smithies. And my personal least favorite, you lose levels and skill every time you die. Which you will. A lot. This makes the grind feel endless, but you learn, and you get better, and the game rewards you with learned perks that can't be lost. 

This doesn't mean it's all frustration and no payoff. Remember that size-locked inventory? That's because it's actually a bag you carry in your offhand and can beat monsters with for knockback, preferably into one of the VERY generously distributed spike traps. Oh, and spiking any monster is one-shot. Satisfying. There are no shields, but you can parry, and I don't mean just pressing a button: you have to actually block the swing. It makes combat more entertaining and less mindless. Ranged combat is by means of disposable wands that act like everything from pistols to shotguns and mortars. 

To make a long review short, Slasher's Keep is a dungeon-crawling roguelite created by someone who obviously loves the genre. It takes a simple format and uses its mechanics to force the player to make choices that can frustrate, but also create an atmosphere and experience that both enhances replayability and extends enjoyment. And the cherry on top is that it's all wrapped in an aesthetic and art style that says ""it's okay to just goof around, kill stuff, and laugh at the posters on the walls. Go ahead, bash the slightly befuddled looking wizard into the spike pole: that's what it's there for. Besides, he deserved it.""",1605982780,1605982780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is not ready for a release, its probably not even ready for early access. Issues with the UI, with the physics, with animations.
This isn't a bad idea for a game they just loaded it down with poor decisions, or simply a lack of talent.
The dungeon lacks any kind of atmosphere. I think its supposed to be going for wacky, but beyond like two or three funny things the majority of the environment lacks any kind of character, not helped by the strange, mannequin bodies and sad attempts at animations.
Melee combat is so stiff and unintuitive that I'm willing to believe that your meant to slowly switch over to ranged weapons as you progress through the game, but I wouldn't know.
There are two interesting ideas; to block you hold down M2 and hold your guarding weapon in the direction that an enemy is attacking from. Now with this in mind the weird animations could be forgiven to a point. The problem is that you can't block every character's attacks and if you cant block their attacks your just going to take damage because you move so slow and awkwardly. Also hitting the flying enemies with melee weapons is infuriating. The second okay idea is that you can smack people with your loot sack, which is genuinely funny and unique, mechanics wise it knocks enemies back and you can knock enemies into spikes or off the map. The problem with this is that it doesn't knock them back far enough nor does it recharge fast enough. This is probably how your meant to avoid unblockable attacks but the timing is off.
There's a lot they could have done here. Add a dash mechanic. Hire an actual animator. Work on world design. Fix the doors so they don't always swing open in the most inconvenient direction, and tons more but honestly it may not be worth it. Its a cheap game and was probably one of the dev's first projects and I'm sure it was some good experience for them. But I just cant recommend this, in fact I can't even believe how anyone could recommend the game.

[*]Atrocious hit detection during combat.
[*]You can't even pause the game. Pressing ESC doesn't stop the gameplay.

Что мне понравилось, так общая атмосфера игры - здесь нет тотального хардкора и начала каждый раз с нуля (после смерти характеристики лишь немного теряются, золото тоже + с более высоких этажей вы сможете сбросить себе в первую камеру сильные предметы) - как следствие, игра вместо атмосферы сурового хардкорного приключения имеет окрас скорее приятной ненапряжной истории, где можно поискать тайнички, покачать героя, потолкать врагов на ловушки и т.д.

Este jogo se baseia em um sistema onde, nós aventureiros estamos em uma masmorra e temos que enfrentar diversos inimigos enquanto saqueamos a masmorra, melhoramos nosso arsenal de armas e armaduras... E também subimos de nível para evoluir nossos atributos que são força, inteligencia e destreza. 

Quanto mais progredimos no jogo, mais desafiador fica, você pode escolher entre se morrer perde tudo incluindo o personagem ou modo normal, onde mesmo se morrer, você volta do inicio, mas mantem o personagem e algumas caracteristicas e atributos dele.

Falado isso, vamos para os pontos positivos, negativos e que podem ser melhorados neste jogo:

Pontos positivos:

1- Seus gráficos são muito bem trabalhados e desenhados.

2- Ótimo desafio dentro do jogo, até o modo fácil se torna desafiador.

3- Progressão longa, ainda não joguei o suficiente para saber se a progressão é infinita, mas aparentemente é.

4- Uma boa variedade de itens, armas e armaduras com variaveis status disponiveis ao longo do jogo.

5- Em niveis mais avançandos de masmorras, tem até puzzles para resolver ou armadilhas mais desafiadoras que exigem paciencia e agilidade para as resolver.

Pontos negativos:

1- De vez em nunca, alguns inimigos teleportam enquanto atacam, não interfere tanto na gameplay e nem deixa o jogo injogavel, apenas deixa alguns inimigos mais dificeis de se matar graças a esse bug.

2- Muita pouca variedade de escolhas e opções para criação de caracteristicas de personagens, tendo só disponivel algumas opções, mesmo as desbloqueaveis são poucas.

3- No forjamento de armas, onde criamos armas, a criação das armas está um pouco bugado, fazendo com que geralmente as armas tenham aparências bem feias ou estranhas, com peças em locais que não deveriam estar.

Pontos que ainda podem ser melhorados ou adicionados ao jogo que fariam esse jogo ser ainda melhor:

1- Modo multiplayer e cooperativo entre amigos adicionado. (Sério, faz isso e o jogo bomba!).

2- Mais variação de customização de personagens.

3- Arrumar a criação de armas e disponibilizar também mais formas de custumizar a arma, como mudar sua cor, adicionar mais enfeites e coisa do tipo.

4- O bloqueio do jogo é um pouco dificil de se entender e usar com precisão, talvez uma melhoria no sistema de defesa ajudaria.

5- Poder explorar melhor as armas nesse jogo seria muito interessante, como usar 2 facas(uma em cada mão), poder usar cajados, escudos, arco e flechas e outros tipos de armas, pois por enquanto, só é possivel usar varinhas mágicas, machados, facas, porretes e espadas, e não pode usar duas armas ao mesmo tempo.

Acho que por enquanto, esses são todos os pontos que eu gostaria de apontar, o jogo em si é incrivel, viciante, bonito e com um super potencial! Vale MUITO apena os 20 reais, espero que coloquem um modo multiplayer neste jogo, pois eu gostaria muito de jogar com os meus amigos isso.",1605899674,1605900370,True,37,0,0.821797370910644531,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Most of the time, you run around killing stuff and looting their corpses - you're essentially SACKing the areas you go through. The combat feels quite hack n SACKshy, and pulling off a parry is always SACKisfying.

The death penalty could use a rework - it's cool that you lose items upon death, and that you can send some back for future runs, but it kinda SACKs that you also lose 25% of your stats - if you then die before regaining those, you still lose 25% of stats you have now. This can lead to a downward spiral if you mess up too much or you don't play your cards right. I'd much rather you kept levels, but each level took exponentially longer to acquire, so that you're essentially softlocked before you can reach the later areas of the game. The crafting SACKstem is also pretty good - later on you can essentially SACK buff on top of buff on your weapons, making them op until later stages of the game. Some of the skills feel somewhat underwhelming.

The artwork is phenomenal - the game has a cartoon-like aesthetic, with hand drawn sprites for pretty much everything. Enemies and items have all of their angles manually drawn, which looks kinda goofy, but it fits in and brings a lot of charm to the table. Not to mention the SACKsy goblin pin-up posters littered around the first area, those really are a SACKht to behold.

The game is really hard though, so don't say you haven't been warned. However, the fact that I SACK down and played this for 5 hours in a row without realising should tell you all that you need to know.

Также интеракция с окружением сделана  очень хорошо и заставляет постоянно пользоваться что делает бой немного зрелищней.

[h1]自定義地牢[/h1]

地牢中的每一層都是隨機的地圖，玩家需要在未知的地圖內尋找上樓的梯子，有點像魔塔的感覺，只不過是3D版本的，雖然整個流程只有十層，但是怪物的難度卻是成倍遞增，越往上走，挑戰會變得愈發困難。沒過三層是特定的boss更需要玩家沈著應對。從第四層開始地圖裏的陷阱會變得十分多也需要玩家加倍小心，不然很容易就會被清理出地牢。而一旦死亡就會從頭開始，不過不開即死模式的話，只會損失部分經驗和物品，算是一個不錯的輔助。

[h1]極度註重反應力的挑戰[/h1]

在本作中，基本上的遊戲難度都來自於對於反應力的考驗。遊戲的難度也來源於此，在戰鬥中，鼠標左鍵是輕重攻擊，右鍵就是格擋，基本上大多數攻擊全部可以通過格擋來抵消。但是這個格擋必須是對怪物出手方向的精確應對，不然不會判定格擋成功。所以很多時候能成功的格擋到怪物的傷害就會讓妳的旅程變得更加輕松，但如果妳應對錯誤的話，基本不會走的太遠。而且遊戲還有一個擊退的動作，玩家要善於使用這一點來把怪物打到陷阱上，可以讓冒險的旅程更加輕松。

[h1]豐富的裝備設定[/h1]

遊戲另一大特色就是裝備系統，拋去常見的裝備品質設定。玩家還可以自己打造裝備，通過冒險取得的零件來在熔爐上鍛造，這一點極大的豐富了遊戲的趣味，畢竟自己打造出來的武器屬性才更加偏向自己的喜好。而且各種詞條的豐富度也讓玩家更具有成就感。

[h1]小小的瑕疵[/h1]

目前看來遊戲的大體框架已經足夠有趣，剩下的就是一些小bug的修復已經最終的完善，目前遊戲還缺乏漢化翻譯，所幸遊戲的文本量並不算大，多熟悉之後也不會覺得特別困吶，唯一不舒服的地方就是有些裝備的詞條看不太明白。希望遊戲正式發售後會有中文本地化的添加。

战斗系统上可以通过吸引少部分敌人过来慢慢应付，不能直接莽，因为游戏里的玩家并不够强力，无脑的损血很不理智。可以依靠观察怪物的动向来用武器以不同方向进行攻击或招架，也可以蓄力等怪物过来给一下狠的然后拉开距离，同时需要注意攻击时机，比如远程骷髅会固定的冲上来，如果攻击时机不对很容易出现挥空的尴尬情况。场景中的陷阱也被利用，玩家可以用布袋把怪物击退到陷阱上或推下深渊。
 
难度还是颇高的，前面几层可能不明显，但是后面真的相当难打，只能靠死亡后保留自身大部分等级、属性点的设定来慢慢培养角色刷过去。机关也很让人头疼，可能因为独立制作者的关系，跳跃的手感很僵并且游戏设定的角色跳跃能力相当低，在某些跳跃机关中真的难操作。另外比较麻烦的是游戏里小地图画的挺抽象，而每关的场景并不小，导致个人这样的路痴经常在寻路中跑来跑去。

Slasher's keep is a first-person Roguelike dungeon adventure game. The game takes a piecemeal and American Comic model. The rough style looks quite unique. Everything you need to do is explore the map, defeat the enemies in the dungeon, and get the treasure. Avoid the trap to find the key, then go to the dungeon on the next level and finally escape.

The combat system can be slowly dealt with by attracting a small number of enemies. It can't be directly smashed, because the players in the game are not strong enough, and the brainless fighting is very irrational. You can rely on the movement of the monster to attack or parry with different weapons. You can also wait for the monster to come over and then pull the distance. At the same time, you need to pay attention to the attack timing. For example, the remote squat will rush in fixed time. The traps in the scene can be used too, and the player can use the cloth bag to knock the monster back into the trap or push down to abyss.

The difficulty is still quite high. The first few floors may not be obvious, but in late period is really quite difficult to play. You can only rely on the setting of most of its level and attribute points after death to slowly cultivate the character. The organization is also very troublesome. It may be because of the relationship of independent producers, the feel of jumping is very stiff and the character jumping ability of the game is quite low, which is really difficult to operate in some jumping institutions. What is more troublesome is that the pictures in the game are quite abstract, and the scenes of each level are not small, which leads to the direction idiots such as me often running around in the pathfinding.

[h1]前言[/h1]
《Slasher‘s Keep》是第一人视角的RPG冒险游戏。


[h1]游戏体验[/h1]
游戏的美术风格采用了卡通渲染，但却又不是完完全全的卡通渲染而是兼采用里Dos时代FPS游戏节省资源式样的面状态纸片渲染方式，举个例子就是，如果前面看到一盆火，当玩家走到它旁边时，这盆火的纸片会根据玩家角色的位置而旋转,达到“欺骗”的效果。通过这样的渲染方法既复古又节约资源，作为小成本游戏还是蛮不错的做法。

游戏的游玩体验则让笔者想到了昔日曾经游玩的《上古卷轴2：匕首雨》。玩家以第一人称操作主角,通过武器魔法与敌人战斗，角色搭载了布娃娃系统。玩家可以如果给角色面板装入不同武器，角色的外观也会随之改变。游戏中拾取的武器会有品质区别，高素质武器往往会带上一大堆强力buff。游戏自身也充满了不少黑色幽默要素，例如哥布林法师的攻击方式整个就一个巴啦啦小魔仙。游戏中的隐藏要素与技巧也不少。例如第一个隐藏关的铁皮小boss玩家怎么打也打不动，而是需要退开的方式将其被钉板扎死，某些不起眼的墙壁会藏着终要的机关......
不过游戏的死亡惩罚还是比较严重的玩家如果不慎挂断那么会强制一无所有从头再来。


[h1]总结[/h1]
总体来说是款素质还不错的第一人视角的RPG冒险游戏，推荐尝试。

[h1] [u] 是男人就上10层	[/u]	[/h1]
与其他地牢游戏不同的是，该作并非一路向下进行探索，而是从下至上爬梯冒险。地牢总分为有10层，玩家在每一层的任务是通过探索找到能解锁前往上一层区域的钥匙，随着层数的增加，攻略难度也越来越高，因此期间玩家还不得不击败敌人，获取经验升级，发现宝藏，找到装备武装自己。大部分情况是随机生成的地牢，部分楼层又是特定的强力BOSS房间，想要一口气通关并非易事，不过贴心的是每一楼层都提供了存档点，玩家可以自行保存并在下一次接着游玩，不同于其他同类游戏，一旦退出，其攻略的进度也将会被重置。

[h1] [u] +注重战斗技巧	[/u]	[/h1]
说到地牢冒险，当然离不开大大杀杀，不过与拿到神器就突突突的同类游戏不同，该作在战斗方面可十分有考究。无论是面对单枪匹马，还是成群结队的敌人时，玩家都不应盲目地随意挥舞武器进行硬刚，这样会得不偿失。游戏更鼓励玩家像个真正的英雄一样，不仅注重武器的一招一式，针对敌人的弱点进行致命打击，更要见机行事，见招拆招，格挡自如。攻击分为轻，重攻击（由按压的时间长短来决定），攻击的方式也分为左，右，下劈跟向前突刺。格挡类似，玩家需要预估并摸清敌人的攻击方式，从而进行不同方向上的格挡操作。此外，玩家还可以利用各种诸如尖刺陷阱，深渊等地形杀来消灭敌人。总的来说趣味性不低，也有一种玩中世纪战争跟骑马与砍杀的味道。

[h1] [u] +高随机性地图及道具	[/u]	[/h1]
游戏的随机性很强，几乎每次体验都能感受到不一样的味道，这极大提高了游戏乐趣。每次每一层楼随机的地图一般都很大，有的甚至大到路痴可能经常会迷路，甚至就连像我这种方向感很强的玩家来说，有时候也得好好研究下地图。地图上的所有内容都是随机的，包括商店，锻造武器房间，秘密区域，祭坛，传送带（传送物品回去，方便下次开局直接装备）以及各种怪物兼陷阱跑酷等房间。道具类似，不过比较看人品，若是遇到好的武器，则可以直接过五关斩六将。正是因为随机性过高，也导致一些问题，好比有时候可能会像我一样随机到一张死图，只能从头来过。

[h1] [u] +贴心的难度设定	[/u]	[/h1]
如果你是手残或者非酋，很难进行地牢攻略，别担心，你可以使用人海战术，这多亏了游戏的保留设定（人物每次死亡只会损失25%的金币，属性点，等级跟相关技能），因此即便是死亡，在下一局游戏中，玩家也能很快重振旗鼓。如果这样也不能满足你，还可以试试游戏提供的简单模式，不过代价是不能解锁相关成就。

[h1] [u] -音效的丢失与欠缺	[/u]	[/h1]
部分场景BGM或者武攻击的音效会随机出现丢失或者缺失的情况，使得玩起来不够更有沉浸感，也不算是缺点，只能说稍有影响体验，但总的来说无伤大雅，依旧该过瘾的过瘾，该上瘾的上瘾。目前处于EA阶段，很多东西不够完善，更何况该作是一人开发，因此进度就不要要求了，相信无论是现有的BUG还是后续的中文化都能够在正式版中见到。

[h1]有趣的地牢探险模式：[/h1]
游戏中需要玩家起初在一个空的牢房，牢房里有个箱子可以提供初始装备，初始装备也是随机生成的。随后玩家需要一个一个的探索地牢房间，当然绝大部分房间里是有各式各样的怪物在等着玩家，僵尸、兽人、飞蛾、地鼠啥的。击杀这些怪物后会掉落装备、药瓶。掉落的装备也都是随机的。玩家也不要忽略货物架上的东西和木桶里的东西，有时候也可以出一些不错的补给品。

[h1]刻意营造的难度：[/h1]
游戏体验一段时间后就会发现，游戏中极度缺少血瓶，主要是游戏中的格挡还是会少量掉血，第一人称操作有时候有十分变扭，敌人攻击时躲闪起来也不是很轻松，不过可以利用房门来进行卡位，不过这样小心翼翼的玩法确实大大降低了游戏的体验。

Das Spiel wurde von 1 Entwickler komplett im Alleingang erschaffen. Eine bemerkenswerte Leistung. Wer mehr Hintergrundinfos, Entwicklungsdetails und die ein oder andere persönliche Anekdoten aus 1. Hand direkt vom Entwickler selbst erfahren möchte, kann sich gerne das Interview mit Damian Schloter hier anhören: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zLqCgDrFGw

Mein Fazit zu Slasher´s Keep:
Ein tolles Spiel. Wer was für Rougelike-Dungeon Crawler übrig hat, der sollte sich Slasher´s Keep unbedingt mal anschauen. Das Kampfsystem erscheint auf den 1. Blick einfach, bietet im späteren Spielverlauf aber einigen Spielraum für Taktik. Außerdem muss man, wenn man denn mal scheitern sollte (und das wird oft passieren!!! Rougelike eben), nicht immer wieder bei 0 anfangen. Man verliert lediglich 25% seiner Skillpunkte und des Geldes. Außerdem kann man sich Gegenstände ""sichern"" und für einen Neustart direkt am Startpunkt verfügbar machen.

Das Crafting-System ist ein tolles Feature. Aus Einzelteilen kann man sich wirklich einzigartige Waffen zusammenbauen und diese auch benennen. Später im Spiel sieht die Waffe dann exakt so aus wie man sie im Bauplan angeordnet hat. Durch gezieltes Sammeln von Bauteilen kann man daraus teils mächtige Waffen anfertigen, die einem das Weiterkommen enorm erleichtern.

Da sich das Spiel stark an den Beutegegenständen (Waffen, Rüstung, Tränke, etc.) orientiert, gelangt man recht schnell in die bekannte Loot-Spirale. Nur noch eben diesen einen Raum mit der Kiste. Nur noch schnell diese Kurz-Quest fertig machen. Nur noch..... Aber genau aus diesem Grund spiele ich ja solche Games **grins**

This game is absolutely great. I'd just recently tried to get back into mount and blade, but the mod I tried was crashing.
I was really looking for a good fantasy RPG mount and blade kind of game. Boy oh boy did this scratch that itch and even more that I didnt know I needed.

A big part of this game is movement, weight and knock back power. You can knock enemies into traps, off ledges or just make space to charge up another heavy attack. You level up and get various passive skills from challenges and... maybe just some early levels. These didnt feel like they did too much early.

Then I started to find activatable skills, things like Riposte. I started trying to get as much Riposte skill and as heavy of a sword as I could. I kept dying to the spider boss that gates off the second zone. Eventually I realized a little trick that does tons of damage to him (which I'll leave out so you can discover it)

Zone two is absolutely mind blowing. The first area became a 'try to find as much loot as possible while blowing through the levels kind of deal. But zone two makes me feel like indiana jones. So many traps, everywhere. You'd think they wouldnt be that hard to deal with but you're wrong. You WILL be in a position where you get your last tick of health shaved off by a trap you cant avoid while not getting hit in combat. 

I found a really cool hammer that lowers your attack speed but shoots an unblockable wave of fire after you swing. I found another skill that lets you charge up a stab longer to dash forward and deal alot of fire damage, and there's another I've found that lets you overcharge forward heavy attacks to deal even more damage.

The farther I get in this game the cooler it becomes. 

This game is an absolute gem, try it out. $11.19 (as of the steam sale currently) is a great asking price for this game.

Games parkour part plays quite horribly as sometimes you get stuck in the moving platforms and the maneuverability doesn't really help at all

some rooms feel way too crowded for their size so its easy to get stuck.

It is a game with a lot of depth in the few mechanics, and systems it has.

The developer has been supportive enough, and he has even added an alternate level of difficulty for people who choose to play the game at a more relaxed, and care free, pace.

The big issue that I have with the game is the balance of difficulty, at around the fourth floor of the game or so, the game has a sudden difficulty spike that changes not only the enemies that you face but also the traps that you come across.

There isn't a gradual process through which this happens, and up till that point you'll probably lack the defensive items neccessary in order to progress further.

It is a problem to have a rogue lite game that understands the concept of a game that progressively becomes more and more difficult, but it is a completely different thing to have a game that forgets that part of making the game more difficult is to make the player stronger, in order to give him, or her, a fair chance in fighting against his, or her, foes.

So i'm torn in between recommending this, or simply not recommending it.

On one hand this is an incredible job for one guy, but on the other it is a game that requires a heck of a lot of development of its systems, and, or, mechanics, in correlation with its absurd, and sudden, difficulty increase.

Playing on ""Easy mode"" didn't make a single difference.

So you're pretty much reduced to replay the game again, over, and over, up until you get to the fourth floor, or any of the subsequent ones.

Memorize enemy patterns, develop strategies, and force yourself to change your style of play in order to bend to the game's will and requirement of not getting hit by almost any trap, or enemy around you.

It's a similar case of what happens in Enter the Gungeon with how the game becomes increasingly difficult but forgets that the whole concept behind a rogue-lite game, beyond procedurally generated levels, and random item drops, is the fact that while the game becomes more difficult, the player also becomes much more stronger.

The Binding of Isaac gets this, Nuclear Throne understands this to a lesser degree in favor of offering a much more challenging experience.

Slasher's Keep, and Enter the Gungeon do not.

This are rogue-lite games that require you to play them endlessly in order to then comprehend each of the different adversities thrown at you, so then you can overcome them.

I frankly don't have the time, or the patience to do such a thing.

Generally the game's enjoyment, and my so called ""immersion"" where grinded to a halt around this sudden difficulty ""spike"".

I would recommend the game to support the developer.

Between Enter the Gungeon, and Slasher's Keep, the difference is that Enter the Gungeon was created by a team of several different individuals, while this game was created by a single one.

Giving him the benefit of the doubth, and considering a neccessary experimentation in connection with the development that video games require, I can only hope for this to get fixed, or resolved in some way.

Otherwise I'll have to remain ambivalent, and upset that a game as creative, and clearly, as with much passion behind it, remains a game that excludes people like me from playing to simply appease other people that prefer a much more challenging, some might say, relentlessly, ""gated"" experience.

Maybe through altering ""Easy mode"" even further and not scaling the damage that the enemies do to player this can be resolved.

Either way, in its current state, I'll would go mixed, but knowing the general attitude that the developer has had toward his game, and the fact that he listens to feedback.

I just don't have the heart to not give it a recommendation.

Slasher's Keep is a first-person roguelite dungeon crawler that focuses on melee combat with procedural generation in dungeon floors, items, etc. that is currently in Early Access.

The game offers everything in 2-dimensional hand-drawn art that is immediately very appealing to me. Everywhere you go, and everything you do feels like exploring in a pop-up story book. While the art-style is certainly not unique, it is certainly very well done. A lot of 3-dimensional appearing objects have several 2-dimensional sprites, so depending on the angle you are looking at them, different sprites show up. I really like the way the game looks, including some very amusing wall-art. 

There is a story, which you really don't need to read. There are two playable characters to begin with, and as you move from floor to floor, you have the option to read the small amount of lore that is embedded in the story. The game does throw your character's name into the story blurbs, which is nice. You can unlock more playable characters as you move on.

In the heart of the game is the procedural generation in the dungeon floors, the progressive difficulty of the levels, and as all roguelites, it has a Permadeath option. Fortunately there is also an Easy mode, so that gives you some options as to how you want to tackle this game. You can play Easy or Normal mode, with or without Permadeath. If you choose not to deal with Permadeath, you still lose 25% of your money, stats, levels, and associated skills every time you die. There is a item chute to be found on each floor after the first floor, and you can throw whatever you wish down this chute and it will be there if you die. And of course, you gain experience, level up, select which of your attributes you want to put your gained points in, and continue, the usual dungeon crawling way.

There are what appears to be alternating shop/crafting stations on every floor above the first as well, and crafting can be utilized to better your chances of survival, but is unnecessary. Though this is a great way to get items that have properties to your liking. Since the other items are randomly generated, you just never know what kind of RNG you will get.

This game focuses on melee combat, so that is how you will go through most of your combat. Enemies either walk/rush to you upon line of sight, or if they are a spell-casting type, they will always aim at you and continually cast immediately after their designated cool-downs. You can charge an attack with your melee weapon or do rapid swings, of course the charged attacks will do more damage. The Left Mouse Button is used for attack using your equipped weapon. There is a precise parry system built in, where you try to parry with the hold of the Right Mouse button that is very directional dependent. You have the best chance of a parry if you aim your parry in the direction of the incoming attack. You can also knock enemies back with your charged attacks or your inventory sack, and if you knock them into spikes or pits, they usually do not fare too well.

There are ranged weapons in the form of magical wands or other similar things. You can wield and use these, but they drain your mana fast. This game is designed to be mostly melee and occasional ranged. [spoiler]If you have an enemy flying over a pit, using ranged attack is definitely the preferred attack option. Trust me, I learned the hard way.[/spoiler]

You equip your loot findings throughout the floors from chests that are always shiny or just from enemy drops. Some of these loot are directly usable items, others are crafting parts that you can use  to fashion your own items.

You have a fairly limited inventory, unfortunately, and often I find myself running back and forth between the shop and the random loot on the floor on those floors that have a shop. The shop really does not pay much for your items, but there are usually one or two pieces of equipment that is an improvement or a crafting piece that I really want in the shop, so I spent a lot of time running in and out of the shop. It would be nice to be able to carry a bit more.

Picking up items and equipping items can sometimes be a bit troublesome, especially because everything is a 2D sprite, a lot of items have fairly large sprites that shadows other items not in the foreground. Picking up everything in this stack of pancake-styled items is also not always feasible, since the game does not allow you to pick something up if your inventory is full. It would be nice to allow the player to pick up and hold with the mouse cursor and set the item aside in another location on the screen. Instead, the item just get spat out if you try to pick it up and your inventory does not allow currently. 

There is a mini-map that is fairly difficult to see, it is located in the top left corner and is just too small. The entrances to the rooms are also not too easily seen. It would be nice if this could be made into an in-game full screen partially transparent overlay on a button press toggle.

In addition, there are some known performance issues with GeForce 10 series cards, and I experienced this myself. According to the developer, launching the game in Direct 3D 11 mode helps, but I was still experiencing some issues with this.

The jump ability is unfortunately just not quite enough to clear most physical hurdles, and so there are times when I was in a room with a lot of stairs and railing, and trying to jump past the railing just never worked. There are also some physical stairs that do not allow you to directly walk up them. So I would be on some stairs and needed to jump to keep moving up the stairs. Another time I got stuck in a area closed off by walls on two sides and these railings on two sides. I got in from above, but couldn't get out, and had to restart. One time I jumped and got hit by an enemy, and got knocked back into a pit--instant death. I never knew that climbing stairs would be so potentially detrimental to my health.  

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Slasher's Keep is a very neat-looking first-person roguelite dungeon crawler that uses a lot of 2-dimensional sprites to simulate a 3-dimensional feel, offers mainly melee fights, and is fairly difficult. All of the dungeon floors undergo procedural genreation, and so the game has a lot of replay value. There are enough enemy types who have different abilities to keep you on your toes. The game offers an Easy mode and Permadeath is optional, making it a bit more forgiving and allowing it to reach a wider audience. It is still in Early Access and there are times while playing that it feels a bit clunky and could use some fine-tuning and polish. It is a fun game, without a doubt, and you should seriously consider it. Current version (0.72) I would rate as 7/10.

入坑是很久前看王老菊玩的，对这类画风有点兴趣，看打折就买了。

总的来说游戏内容方面还是比较丰富的：技能，装备，怪物特性，小boss法师特效（好想拿他的法杖放个大），地图解密。
总共10关，10后面基本就是从头开始的无尽模式了。前面9关中每三关一个地图风格。
1-3是上面介绍里图片展示的地牢风格，主要特点是找隐藏门上高台拿钥匙或者地图联通。
4-6是类似于金字塔感觉的，会有爬楼的内容，主要特征是冲刺铁甲怪+大量机关（地刺，摆锤为主）。
7-9是城堡（大概）有图书馆有卧室啥的，主要特征是双刀小怪+360度旋转机关（可关闭）+衣柜藏门。
10关是boss关，进门正式打boss（似乎是被操控的男主妹妹？？）前会有支援点三连——锻造炉，商人，存货点。进去后不能再返回，通关后直接重置回第一关。打完后会有绕房一周的箱子开（看脸，不一定是好装备）+boss掉落双刀+boss尸体（可拾捡是什么操作？？？我拿装备去了空间不够捡尸体就没管）。

游戏机制决定了这是一个需要在死亡中积累的游戏。前期死的较快，第一个瓶颈大概是第3关，这个时候需要利用锻造+装备继承积累一套绿装出来，打法稳点比如单拉+勾引踩陷阱+F踢上陷阱或踢下悬崖，可以减轻对防具的要求。此时期装武器伤害最好冲到100-200阶段（一般是重武器，我靠合成出的），此伤害可以保证你在三下蓄力内秒掉绝大多数怪。第二个瓶颈大概是第五关左右，此时应着手把装备换为蓝装（从这层商店会爆蓝装），攻击提升至250-400左右。4-6图内必须熟练掌握跳高台阶梯，不然会伤很多血甚至卡关。接下来进入7-9图，商店会出紫装，本人运气好摸到了400+的武器，怪基本4刀蓄力内搞定。需要注意的是有绿骷髅和紫骷髅的时候一般房间里会有一个能力祭坛，他们喷完能量会下去取，可以这个时候上去平A清掉。1-9我走的基本是重武器路线，但boss前摸到了金色剑，就换了。进去发现boss的血那叫一个厚，估计有20000+。双刀伤害高，貌似无特殊技能。我靠剑的连击打她硬直慢慢推到后面的钉墙上3-4次左右推死，带缴械技能的话可以把她双剑打掉，全部打掉后她不能攻击会去捡剑，可以输出。

前期的辛苦到中期舒服发育到最后幸运卡bug通关，这游戏给我的体验相当不错，推荐！但通关后重复关卡有种喂shi感，希望能有以后内容能有更多更新吧！

[h1] RATING: 7.5 / 10 - Prison Break [/h1] 

===

[h1] Overview [/h1]
Slasher's Keep is a first person action roguelite focused on melee combat and dungeon exploration. Confined to rot in a cell deep in the bowels of Slasher's Keep, you suddenly find a chance to escape your destiny, you take it, and your escape begins to reach the top of the dungeon and run away. In this perilious journey you will have to fight dangerous monsters of all sorts: undeads, giant molerats, slimes, animated skulls to name only a few, level up your character, find always new and powerful weapons and items to equip, explore vast dungeons full of traps and secrets, all in a melee-oriented, brutally violent combat style that is easy to learn but hard to master, and where timing is of the essence. With procedural dungeon and loot creation, roguelite elements, optional permadeath, and varied enemies, Slasher's Keep is definitely, already, a solid game in the roguelike/lite genre.

[h1] Gameplay Analysis [/h1]


[b] General Gameplay [/b]
Slasher's Keep gameplay focuses mainly on combat, exploration and resource management, as any good roguelike should. I will talk about combat in the next section. For exploration, each level of the dungeon is procedurally generated with different patterns each time, and filled with secret rooms, hidden panels, traps, traders, bonus encounters and more, so variety is guaranteed as no two floors will ever be the same. This of course partially ties the progression to luck, as an unlucky floor generation with little positive things and many traps and negative encounters will make your escape a lot harder, with the possibility of death, but such is the nature of roguelike games in the end, so no big deal.

Permadeath is optional in this game, and if not enabled, when your HP reaches zero you will be dragged back in your cell on Floor 10 and lose all your items, and part of your money and attributes gained by leveling, and of course, you will have to traverse all the Keep again. Some items can be retained through death by using item chutes, special objects that appear randomly in floors from time to time, and allow you to send any item to your cell, ready to be used immediately in case of defeat and return to the cell.

Item generation is aswell procedural and items each have different speed values, armor, damage values, damage types such as slash, blunt, magical, etc. - and special attributes that confer your character unique bonuses, such as life steal on attack, bonus damage against certain enemies, or more attack speed. Items can also be crafted at Forges if you are lucky enough to find the, during your escape you will find all sorts of item parts, and at a forge you can combine them together to craft powerful custom gear that best suits your character.

Character progression consists in a rather simple level-up system giving you four attribute points, to spend in Intelligence, Strenght or Dexterity, to receive the relative bonuses to each attribute, it will be up to you how to manage them and decideeither to go for a pure, single-attribute class or a mixed attributes jack of all trades, depending on your play style. Performing chain kills in a short amount of time boosts experience gained, so the game rewards bold, quick moves against multiple enemies, but being too reckless will result in quick death.

As in any roguelite, resource management is important, as your inventory space is limited and each floor contains abundant items and resources to be gained. It will be up to you to decide what to keep, what to sell, and what to send to your cell to plan in advance for your very likely next defeat. Decisions, decisions.



[b] Combat System [/b]
Combat in Slasher's Keep is mainly focused on Melee even if there are ranged weapons such as magical wands. Clicking the left mouse will perform attacks continuously, while holding it will perform a much more powerful charged attack, of which you can also decide the direction by combining WASD+Click. Right click is for parrying. This is certainly not a button-mashing type of combat, as timing for when to parry and when to attack will be fundamental to win a combat. Enemies are vicious and will wait for you to charge attacks to strike on their own, exploit your weaknesses, and work together, for example support enemies will heal and buff melee ones that will charge at you in the meantime.

You also have a magical wand at your disposal, your ranged weapon, that costs Mana to be fired, and also your loot sack, usable each set amount of time as a powerful interrupting weapon, useful to push enemies insidetraps, spikes, or cliffs. Understanding the usage of all these weapons takes time and practice and is easy at first but then becomes more complex and tactical.


[b] Content [/b]
Since the mostly procedural content, the replayability is theoretically infinite, and variety is abundant.


[b] Balancing [/b]
The game is difficult, but fair, i did not see any particular unbalance.


[b] Challenge [/b]
The game starts off quite nicely but then difficuly suddenly becomes much more serious after some floors cleared. A good challenge.

[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]


[b] Graphics [/b]
With a very original art style, this game totally conveys a brutal, dark fantasy world in an unique way, really a good job. I completely fell in love to this graphical style that so few games use nowadays (cel shading), it is the right point between a comic book and a 3D game. 

[b] Sound [/b]
Weapon sounds are good, impacts are aswell, effects in general are of average quality.

[b] Performance [/b]
Nothing to report.

[b] Stability [/b]
Nothing to report.

[b] AI [/b]
Enemy AI is vicious, will wait for openings in your guard, collaborate, surround you, and in general give you a hard time in your escape.

[b] Quality of Life [/b]
Nothing to report.

[b] Bugs / Issues [/b]
N/A (Early Access)

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Slasher's Keep is a solid roguelite game with good melee combat, satisying progression, challenging enemies and a lot of variety. I'm really waiting it to come out of Early Access and see how better it can become.",1526947957,1526947957,True,6,1,0.576793909072875977,0,False,True,True,False,,,

I liked the weapon crafting, you make some rather goofy weapons OF DOOM and other such, and the armor you get makes it hard to take your character seriously (currently wearing a plague doctors helmet, edwardian dress shirt, giant plate PAULDRONS, and leafs for shoes.

I'm going to start off by beating the game into the ground, because really, that's what it does to you, it beats you down and tries it's hardest to break your spirit.
It's not a great casual game, you can very easily find yourself going backwards due to how much you lose from dying, if you can't recover everything lost from your most recent death before your next one you'll find yourself going backwards or even just nowhere. A good example of this was that I was strong enough to get to level 4, I died losing my best gear, lots of money and lots of experience, since then it's a struggle to get past level 2 again.
It doesn't help that combat is a bit clunky, sometimes you can block an attack only for it to still connect anyways, I know you're supposed to direct your sword to successfully block, but theirs just passes through on occasion.

It's the harshest rouge-like I've played so far simply due to how easy it is to die from a bug like that or failing to be able to switch to your melee weapon because you're aiming down sights with the wand, there's no way to turn off 'toggle' either, so you need to press it again to be able to change weapon.

The procedural generation of the maps can be a little off sometimes too, like a door requiring a copper key only for there not to be one on the entire level, I moved on to the next level thinking I could find a key later on and come back, only to find you can't go back through the levels.
The level sizes are also a part of the difficulty problem, due to the levels being so small there is only so much experience you can obtain from one level which makes it feel like the game is heavily rail-roading you into the wall that is the games difficulty curve. Didn't get enough XP from those last 2 levels? Too bad then, you're probably going to die to the first enemy you see on this level.


All that being said, I absolutely ADORE the art style, it's brilliant, the game runs super smooth and there are little details that have been thought of that other games don't; for instance if you kill an enemy near a drop/hole then the items will appear where he was last standing before it was killed, no need to worry about keeping them away from ledges.
I also love the range of abilities and loot, the weapon crafting is really impressive and the player movement feels very natural.

I do find myself rage quitting fairly often, especially when I'm killed by something really simple, but I find myself jumping back on the game every now and then to see if I can make some progress.

I'd love to see a fully fleshed out game without procedural-ly generated maps, or just have them as dungeons in a larger open world type game.
Also, the positive reviews this game is getting, and the success of the Borderlands series proves that not all gamers want the highest levels of graphics, but instead just want really fun games.

I do recommend the purchase, especially at such a low price, I hope to see more from this dev.",1523166568,1523166568,True,4,0,0.541748404502868652,0,False,False,True,False,,,

You can pick from a variety of characters that unlock in certain ways. Each one has a different story.
You must keep getting to new levels to find out more of your character's story.

When you choose a character, you must also choose what to do when you die. You can enable permadeath, or just keep it at softcore, where you loose 25% of your levels and the skills obtained from them.
This means that when playing without permadeath, you will start back at the beginning, but with most of your experience and skills, and therefore you have an advantage. And even you, the player, will gain your own personal experience, and know how to better survive the dungeon.

The dungeons are randomly generated. So are the items, with their damage, armor, bonuses, and included skills. This is what drove me into Slasher's Keep.
The items even look different based on their rarity, so it's even more satisfying to find rare items.

Also, you can make your own weapons, if you have the parts, and are on every other level, alternating with the shop.
Even the parts are randomly generated, but categorised into hilt + blade / shaft + head types.

I'll explain the one minor issue I have. If, like me, you only pay attention to the main stats of an item (damage and armor), you'll notice you'd choose a mace, because of the high damage.
What I want is for all weapons to have the same range of damage so that I can use all the weapon types more often.

Another issue I have is that the game doesn't pause when you press esc.

The art style is very unique, and it uses sprites rather than polygons for the monsters and many of the objects that you encounter. I appreciate this both for the nostalgic looks, and the ridiculously high performance that this design choice provides. This game will happily run at 144fps+ on mid-spec hardware, and it looks very good doing it. The combat mechanics are also very nicely done. This is especially impressive when you consider the fact that this is an indie game developed by one person. Often, combat is one area that many indie devs really struggle to get right. I'm happy to report that this is not the case with Slasher's Keep. Well done, Mr. Schloter!

There are a few things that I would like to see the developer work on while the game is still in EA. First - and I realize that this is an entirely subjective opinion - but the music didn't leave a very good first impression. Fortunately the game options allow you to turn the music off, so this really isn't a huge deal. Still, I was struck by how annoying the music is when I first booted up the game. Second, some of the sound design is rather questionable. Most of the effects are quite good. The player-character & monster grunts, groans, and yells are all perfect. The issue that I have is with the magic sounds. When a wand is used, for example, it quite literally sounds like one of those toy Disney princess wands. Perhaps that is what the dev was going for, but I found it to be disconcerting. 

Aside from those minor niggles, I think this is an excellent game, even in its Early Access state. I definitely recommend it!",1521414019,1596228347,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Essentially, you get random weapons and armor locked by the floor your on to be a certain tier: you gain XP by killing monsters, and even more XP if you do so in a combo, and you get levels and stats to level up.

Death is a certainty, and the game depends on you dying - you lose items adn some stats, but keep everything else, and so you get a little better each time... you also get the ability to save items by dropping them in a ""loot chute"" that puts the items where you start the game on a new game, and you can craft weapons from various parts.

There's magic in the form of wands, but thats it. 

The best way to play this game is to run around killing monsters at a fever pace, ensuring you get the maximum bonus, only picking up weapons as you go on your spree, and THEN going back to explore. 

Eventually, you'll be forced to slow down and fight more technically by blocking, dodging, zapping enemies with wands, and otherwise avoid going berserk, because you'll hit a stat-wall. you wont be strong enough to progress, and enemies will proceed to one,two, or three shot you to death depending on how far you managed to progress. 

and then you die, run through weak enemies to farm XP, and do it all again.

Slasher´s Keep es un juego de rol y acción en primera persona, en el que tendremos que tratar de escapar de una prisión de 10 pisos. Cada uno de los pisos, como sus criaturas, trampas y tesoros se dispondrán de manera procedural por ser un ""roguelite"", por lo que nunca jugaremos 2 veces a la misma partida. Podemos optar por muerte permanente, o poder continuar con nuestro personaje si nos matan con penalización en nuestros stats, oro y pertenencias, pero si las pudimos salvar en unos lugares especiales aparecerán para poder usarlas en nuestro próximo intento.
Me ha gustado mucho la estética de los gráficos, y cada nivel tiene un diseño que casi ni se nota que fue creado de forma aleatoria. Además tiene un sistema de crafteo en el que podremos construir con partes que iremos recolectando nuevas armas y armaduras (eso todavía no lo vi en mis primeras 2 horas de juego, me mataron demasiadas veces XD).
El juego en cada piso se va poniendo difícil, pero es muy entretenido ya que siempre vamos a ir encontrando nuevos enemigos, trampas y hasta sencillos quests que nos ayudaran a subir de nivel o conseguir items especiales.
Los combates pueden ser con armas melee (con distintos tipos de ataques según nuestros movimientos con el mouse y el teclado) o a distancia con varitas mágicas, y el diseño de las mismas es muy variado.

For a single developer, it’s an extremely impressive project. The difficulty may feel cheap, but the attention and care gone into design is clear. On top of this, Slasher’s Keep does have character. Nothing about it feels cynical, It’s just going to require a very specific type of player to get the most out of. If you’re looking for a fun, casual dungeon crawl, or even one that offers a clear route of progression for getting more heavily involved over time, Slasher’s Keep is currently not that game. 

Overall, A quirky first-person dungeon crawl with some interesting interplay between systems and a wide variety of loot, let down by baffling and frustrating difficulty spikes. Getting parts of my pretend body torn off in fantasy settings is fun. Genuinely wanting to mutilate myself is not.

A truly impressive effort for a one man team.  15 dollars well spent to enjoy what's already here and to encourage more.

Personally, I would love to see further elaboration on the exploration gameplay.  Whenever there's a permanent minimap, I can't resist the urge to have it on all the time, which results in less satisfying exploration, as I find myself with one eye on the map constantly.  I realize some people would prefer it that way, but I would love for it to be more deliberate, say, having to equip the map or make it take up the full screen.  Or even having to find the map and compas a la Zelda or Hollow Knight.

The objective is climbing up through the floors of a dungeon, killing monsters, gathering items, discovering secrets and even crafting your own weapons, to fight against a Boss located at the top floor. The crafting aspect of the game took me entirely by surprise, the moment I found a forge and discovered that I could make my own creations with the resources I gathered (and even name them!) made me so happy, I just love having my own weapon designs and actually see and use them in-game.

The combat feels pretty good, as you progress, you'll find other ways to fight the enemies you'll encounter where you don't even have to worry about parrying their attacks, but I have found myself clashing swords and parrying attacks for a while with some of them and it feels pretty awesome.

There is elemental damage like fire and ice, and all kinds of perks that give you some advantages like regenerating mana on your own, making the severed head of a monster explode, etcetera. You can get them either leveling up, via armour or via weapons. Here the weapon crafting plays a huge role, as you can gather the resources you need to create something with the perks you want.

The sound design is very good, everything sounds as you would imagine and it fits perfectly with the environment, from the grumbling of your character, to eating some critters straight from the ground. The voice acting, for what it is (and I mean, there aren't many NPCs or else with real dialogue on it), is wonderful. Especially the shopkeeper. I'm in love with that character, he's without any doubts my favourite.

As I said, there are some minor issues that I have experienced at the time of writing this review, like some doors not showing up on the map, when dying and loading for some reason the map resets (you have to discover what you already discovered before, and fill up the blank map again), on higher levels, the monsters tend to deal lots of damage even if you are well-prepared for them, but once you learn to move around, parry precisely and use your environment (such as spikes, traps or bottomless pits) to kill your enemies, you can pretty much be untouchable. But as I said, the developer is actively working on the game, so there's nothing to worry about!


To sum up, Slasher's Keep it's a magnificent game that will provide many hours of entertainment by exploring all the dungeons' sizes (small, medium... even infinite!), completing quests/achievements, creating all kinds of weapons (the weirder, the better), unlocking new characters (that have different initial perks), using all kinds of wands to see what they do, managing your inventory and knowing what to send through the hatch for your future self, and discovering all the secrets that lie within the dungeon's floors. And also by wasting all my money at the shop to hear those sweet sweet voice lines. I strongly recommend grabbing this game!

boss战结束,控制妹子的人被吓跑,妹子也复原了晕倒在地上,还有一把紫色的钥匙.这时候需要扔掉所有的道具和装备(其实并不需要,装备栏是5*7,而妹子是4*7,所以可以留上最后一列),腾出装备栏,妹子会和装备一样在你的装备栏里.带着妹子,拿上钥匙,走到最后的大门那里,开门,游戏通关!

1) The monsters are strengthened too much for each level. The problem is that no matter the rarity of your equipments, they will become meaningless when brought to the next level and you need to loot new weapons ""fit"" for the level. Or in other words, you will feel kinda ""naked"" when you enters a new level.
2) Still the difficulty. Below is how I deal with monsters in the game: i. try to grab attention of any single monster in a room ii. block-attack-block-attack..., repeat until it dies iii. repeat until all the monsters dies. It's so repetitive and totally a different game from the video. An unsuccessful block will cost you 20/120 health (or a health portion) on level 3, which is too costly to try anything cool. Wand is also not so useful since on level 3 it will basically cost ALL your mana to kill a single monster if you don't have a powerful wand.
3) The skill system is too RNG based. I once got three ""ice mage"" traits on leveling up while I dont have weapons dealing ice damage.
4) Death penalty. In non perma-death mode, you will be punished 25% attribute points on death, which makes you weaker each time. In my view, the current death punishment is actually not a big difference from perma-death cause I don't think I can achieve as much with less attribute points. I'd rather restart a new game.
To be fair, I may be biased cause I didn't spend much time or I may be poor on this game. I will give more tries and will edit or delete the comment if inappropriate. Experience sharing on the game is also welcomed.

Выскажу свое имхо:
[h1]- передвижение и атака:[/h1] персонаж ходит, словно зацепился за гвоздик подтяжками. Удары оружием не ощущаются вовсе. ЛКМ вы будете ковырять мобов полдня, а пока ""заряжается"" ПКМ мобы наковыряют вас. А если подниметесь на второй уровень - то вообще пиши пропало. Враги там толще и жирнее в несколько раз, по сравнению с первым.
Блок номинальный: с медленным оружием вы попросту не будете успевать его ставить между атаками, да и большинство мобов успешно его пробивают. 
Если вы решили побегать с даггером/шотсвордом будьте готовы к промахам по мобам (привет, синие и желтые шарики) особенно ""тычковой"" заряженной атакой. Длина оружия совсем не ощущается, вроде бы должен попасть, а на самом деле не достал. 
Ванды стреляют весьма медленно, если моб идет к вам не по прямой траектории то попасть проблематично. 
""Толкайте мобов рюкзаком на шипы"" говорили они. Ага, щаааас. Отталкивающая сила вкупе с кулдауном мешка делает это возможным только в том случае, если моб стоит прямо у самых шипов, иначе они банально успевают от них отойти и настучать вам по лицу.
[h1]- подземелье:[/h1] некоторые комнаты генерируются странно, нагромождаясь какими-то непонятно зачем поставленными лестницами, по которым персонаж движется, как калека, переходами, неразбиваемыми бочками и ящиками, валяющимися под ногами и мешающими отступать а также прочими предметами, через которые продираешься, как срочник на полосе препятствий.
Решетки, закрывающиеся за спиной отрежут вам путь к отступлению. Будьте готовы отъехать от пачки кротов, зажавших вас в углу.
[h1]- лут:[/h1] его величество рандом в деле - из первоначального сундука вы можете вытащить ваншотающую мобов палицу, а можете шотсворд с атакой 6-8, исход предсказуем.
С некоторых мобов сыпется, как из рога изобилия по 3-4 предмета, а в некоторых комнатах вы рискуете не получить ничего, кроме пары монет и БЧП.
Опять же, понятно, что рандом, но кольцо на скорость мили атаки, требующее интеллект - это нечто.
БЧП восполняют смехотворное количество ХП.
[h1]- прокачка:[/h1] и опять же рандом. Будьте готовы бегать с бесполезными скиллами, которые при этом еще и остаются после смерти. (какой-то странный roguelite, в играх такого типа ты сам выбираешь необходимые параметры при прокачке).Проще в этом случае начать новую игру.

Кроме вышеперечисленного, в игре отвратительная, на мой вкус, анимация, при довольно-таки своеобразной и приятной на вид графике. В целом, играть поначалу интересно, но постепенно начинают раздражать детали, описанные выше.

I saw someone mentioning the gap of difficulty between floor 1 and then 2, and while this may be true, there are tons of ways to kill monsters. I found out the best way to do so is by running back a little and strike, run back a little and strike and so fort. There is the possibility to ofcourse do it in the way Damian Schloter wanted it to be, which is by precise blocking, but that took em longer and well....this feels fine as well. Traps can be used, together with the smart use of wands for luring monsters out of a room instead of jumping right in there and locking yourself. 

One annoying flaw on my end was the fact that you can get overrun by monsters and have nowhere to run lol, hence insta death is on the horizon after that.

The game is in early access, and it shows. The great potential of the game is very clear already, however. In it's current state I can recommend it IF you can deal with the stuff I am going to mention now;

The game is difficult and buggy. This should be noted by all who would consider buying it. It's playable, its fun and its interesting. There's an ending and boss fight. It has everything a game would need to have. However, some bugs will lead to your death, save stations only save for when you quit the game, dying always sends you back to the first level with a huge penalty to your level (and thus your skills). On the other hand, some exploits allow you to farm items infinitely, grant you the posibility to get ludicrous stats and to craft a weapon even Zeus himself would be jealous of. 

Those exploits are what allowed me to beat the game. My character has over 500 in each of the 3 stats, my armor and weapons were blue or higher, with my weapon having 24 attachments with purple and blue parts too. I was one hitting every enemy with my ice wand, sniping everything from doorways. I could have gone into melee, but not only did my mana regen to 100% thanks to having a lvl 24 ""coldblooded"" skill, so i could spam wand shots forever. I also still got one hit by enemies. 

No I'm not kidding. At the 4 or 5th  level of the dungeon, enemies started one-hitting me, and they never stopped. No amount of armor would save me. Only through save-scumming (alt-f4 the game then reload a save if you die) did I get to the end. If I play a roguelike I expect to be screwed by bad stats or shitty items, but I also expect that epic loot will make the game easier. In Slasher's keep, you don't need good loot. You need cheesy loot. You need those 10 items with ""Coldblooded"" and that epic wand so you can snipe everything before it hits you. You need seperate items with ""Artisan"" and ""Mastersmith"" to be able to make an OP weapon that gives you 5 skills per attachment and allows you to attach 25 of those. 

I had all of that. And then the game decided it would generate a floor with geometry blocking off the only route to the exit. I tried everything to get past the inside of a boulder generated in a doorway. To no avail. I simply ran into a spike 3 times and got back to the first floor of the dungeon. I was level 20, not anymore though. I used to have epic gear, not anymore. I picked up my shitty weapon and armor and went on my way. The first enemy I found did 3000 damage to me. I had around 500HP. I reset again, losing even more levels. Now my guy is level 5. I got a couple floors in again, because I found a wand and have literally over 500 intelligence. Everything still one-hits me. But then again, I also kill everything in 2/3 hits and never have to get close. 

If after reading all this you still think giving the game a try is worth it, be my guest. I enjoyed the 14 odd hours I played of this game. I will probably play more, but I also eagerly await the much needed balance patch. 

PS.

Mr. Schloter, should you be reading this, your game is great. But by god is it not optimized correctly. 
- Enemy damage needs to scale better (as in not so high so quickly), or armor needs to do more, or both. 
- Some bugs need fixing, like the one randomly disabiling your block or attack. Or the one where you start running really fast for no reason, or the one where the room generation makes a secret door in a rock, so you cant run through said door, or the one where skills that are present on your weapon and armor don't actually show up on my character.
- Many skills need hard caps so you can't have ""Bloodlust"" so high it literally ticks your multi-kill time counter up instead of down every second.
- Sacrificing a (blue) potion to the altar should not give a (green) item with a chance to get a free potion. Because that (green) item then has a chance to give a potion when sacrificed, leading to infinite items and potions. The purple Stat-up potions should not be able to be sacrificed, as they can come from sacrificing green or higher potions randomly, but they give blue items when sacrificed, leading to free blue items very early and very easily. 
- Dying should have less of a penalty, maybe resetting you to a save point, but at the very least not taking (so many) levels from you as it does.

Du findest dich beraubt deiner Habseligkeiten im Verlies von Slasher's Keep wieder. Viele haben versucht von hier zu entkommen und sie sind alle gescheitert...
Wirst du es ihnen gleichtun oder die Schrecken von Slasher's Keep überleben?

[h1]Die Technik[/h1]
Grafisch trifft Slasher's Keep mit seinem Comic-Cel-Shading-Look und handgezeichneten 2D-Sprites in einer 3D Umgebung genau meinen Nerv. :D
Performance is gut.
Sound ist gut.
Ich liebe den Song im Hauptmenü. ^^

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Spielerisch bietet Slasher's Keep alles, was man von einem Dungeoncrawler, wie Delver etc., erwartet. Schlagen, blocken, looten, erkunden, sterben und das Ganze wieder von vorne.
Dabei sammelt man natürlich auch Erfahrungspunkte die unweigerlich zum Level Up führen, der dir wiederum Skillpunkte beschert, die man in Stärke, Geschick oder Intelligenz investieren kann.

Der Dungeon wird dabei jedesmal random generiert.

[h1]Fazit[/h1]
Slasher's Keep macht auch jetzt schon im Early Access einen guten Eindruck und man kann nur hoffen, dass das Ein-Mann-Entwicklerteam am Ball bleibt.
Spaß machts definitiv. :)

从前年开始就夜不能寐地关注着这款游戏的开发Twitter了，而现在终于释出了EA版！！（狂喜乱舞）

作为一款由单人开发的独立游戏，Slasher's Keep已远超我的期待：
[list]
 [*]画面 - Cel-Shading着色器与Billboard物件的结合，第一眼就给我留下了深刻印象。
此外，恰到好处的卡通美术风格，又给阴暗的地牢题材增添了一抹诙谐的色彩。

 [*]内容 - 在传统Roguelike式地牢探索玩法的基础上，着重强调了战斗部分：配合方向键与轻/重击，便能根据战术需求打出侧砍/前突/劈斩等不同的花招；而格挡时，玩家需将视角对准攻击袭来的方向，才可抵御住伤害。
若对战斗技巧没有自信，随处可见的尖刺/深坑陷阱也为执行地形杀提供了大量可能性（按F推搡怪物；地形杀有额外经验值）。
此外，武器拼装系统、交易所、秘密房间、祭坛等设定更是为游戏锦上添花；大量精心设计的随机要素与能继承装备的储存箱，在平衡了难度的同时也加强了重复可玩性。

玩家的最终目标是从关押自己的地下10F一路摸回地表 - 其间将逐渐出现新的怪物、装备、陷阱和地牢环境。
[/list]

由于本作尚处于早期测试，瑕疵也是有的 - 例如突然鬼畜的物体、偶尔闪烁的阴影贴图等。
但目前这类bug并没有影响我在地牢中大杀四方和搜刮宝藏 (`･ω･´) 先期待个后续的内容/修复补丁。

总而言之：推荐购买！

2. There will always be a time where you're stuck in a corner and your potate sac just doesn't do it, Doesn't feel deserved to die like this and feel simply... bad.

3. This point is a bit more personalized but i would love to see more new weapons in the game like Polearms and Bows, both of these can really freshen up the game and add more ways to play.

4. The option to disable posters around the dungeons. I was streaming this game the moment i got it and i had to look away instantly to avoid seeing some tiddums on stream and to hopefully not face a ban. Please consider working on this point in particular. If there is a way to turn it off let me know.

Overall i would give this game an 8.9 out of 10

The random generation of dungeons and loot makes it interesting with every new start,  as you never know what you will come accross (this appears to be the case with the passive skills you are assigned after levels up's and through gear).

The combat actually feels responsive..its great when you one shot a zombie or goblin and the blocking appears to be on point.

You have quite a few breakables which help including the vases and the boxes with the health potion symbol on, these tend to drop money, food and potions to help replenish health / mana or to become invulnerable for several seconds.

I have only got to level 2 (almost to level 3) and noticed how much harder and how much more HP the mobs have, so make sure you get a few level ups on the first level before you go on ahead further lol.

You also have alternative rooms for example a shrine you can offer gear to for a reward or curse, you also have shops, health/mana globes and a mounted lion head which offer you quests i.e. kill 2 creates with an explosion x2 (look for barrels with fire symbol on - require one hit to set off, just make sure your not trapped in one corner before you do :P)

To note, when you enter the fairly big rooms the door tends to slam shut behind you until you have killed every creature in the room, so be aware!.

I have also come accross 'components' some very powerful which basically add to your weapon as an enhancment, I have yet to apply one however, if your lucky enough I think there are forges's that allow you to apply them to your weapon that can appear on levels - on this ..you sometimes get map drops which will show you important symbols on the map, i.e. secret doors, keys etc.

I have only come accross one bug that appears to be after I have used a wand, i am unable to melee or block until i remove the weapon and add it back on through the inventory, sometimes the mobs will walk into boxes and shelves which impede their movement but you can use this to your advantage, smacking the mobs off into the abyss or onto a spike trap is satisfying.

I am looking forward to spending more time in the game, obviously it still needs work i.e. more enemy variety, more loot, boss fights, more rooms, classes etc but this is a thumbs up for me!..I am looking forward to seeing what more this gem has to offer.",1518230063,1518230063,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

If you're into dungeon crawlers, this should feel familiar.  Level up, collect items, become powerful, kill everything.  Sound is great and the art style I particularly enjoy.  The game takes a dull and drab environment and transforms it into eye candy while still keeping the gameplay we enjoy so much.  Did not encounter any bugs.  Even early in development, I can recommend.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]
Slasher's Keep is a fun dungeon crawler with cartoony graphics and a light-hearted atmosphere.  You start out ""locked"" in a prison cell, with your only option to fight your way out.  The prison cell room is the same every play through, but each subsequent game features a new dungeon layout (procedurally generated).    The goal of the game is to escape the dungeon by crawling up throughout each level of the keep.

Weapons are varied in the game; clubs, maces, magic wands, swords, etc.  Dead enemies can drop various pieces of gear, either weapons, armor, potions, or money.  If you've played a dungeon crawler before, than you get the idea.

Controls are decent, and I only have minor complaints.  Attacks feel okay, but I wish they carried some more impact.  You can block as well, but only if your main attack animation is completed.  One thing I thought was particularly clever is the ability to use your inventory bag to hit enemies with.  

Sound is excellent, from the ambient noises to the soundtrack to enemy grunt noises.  The music at the title screen is particularly good.

Graphics are a bit of a highlight for me.  I really enjoy the direction they took with this.  Instead of gray and dull as most dungeon crawlers are, this game finds a away to make things still look great.  The game is a little silly, and you see that from the artwork on posters in game and from various things throughout.

Even as early as it is in this games development, this feels like a full game.  I recommend.

Если вы желаете поддержать разработчика, то берите, если хотя бы немного сомневаетесь - повремените с покупкой.
На момент написания отзыва игра сырая и требует многих доработок и контента, однако и на данном этапе зависнуть в ней можно. Что же это за творение? По сути, это обычный рогалик, в котором нам нужно выбраться из подземелья, однако боёвка в игре сделана в духе скайрима, а графика - в очень сочном и красочном 2D. От чего выглядит свежо и играется приятно. 
Из плюсов выделю:
+ оригинальное исполнение
+ МНОГО лута
+ МНОГО слотов, куда лут пихать
+ обычный рогалик
Из спорных моментов хотелось бы выделить боёвку, так как лично мне очень не нравится, что здесь нельзя как-то отпрыгивать, уклоняться, а можно только бить и ставить блок, отчего в лицо ты будешь получать всегда. А хилки тут удовольствие редкое. Было бы круто добавить больше подвижности хотя бы для лёгкого оружия, и уж тогда полное поглощение урона в блоке для тяжёлого оружия. 
Минусы:
- чувствуется сырость игры 
- оптимизация пока хромает
- нехилая сложность (на первом этаже можно набить уровня 2-3, а для второго требуется минимум десятый, но благо вроде как характеристики персонажа после смерти сохраняются, отчего это даже можно убрать из минусов)
- из-за 2D порой не понятно, достанет атака до противника или нет
В общем-то и всё. Минусы в основном из-за раннего доступа и непривычности к механике.

I have been monitoring this game for a few months as I nervously waited for it's steam release. I was overjoyed today when I saw it had released this morning. After starting  it up and quickly choosing a randomized character, I found myself locked in a cell with the keys being visible through a crack in the wall. After attempting to retrieve the keys for a minute, I accidentally stumbled upon the solution to the puzzle. While I wouldn't spoil it here, it was unexpecteed and hilarious and really sets the tone for the rest of the game. As I emerged from my cell, a nearby chest rewarded me with a bunch of bananas on a stick/mace and a wizard hat. Slasher's Keep is a lighthearted, hand drawn dungeon crawler with peppy, skyrimy hack and slash combat and fun physics. It is clear that Damian Schloter loves his game and put a lot of heart into this project.

Update:

After putting 10 hours into this game I would stay it still holds up. There are some minor issues, the biggest being difficulty scaling in general, but the one big technical glitch was fixed by a patch on the first day. There are no issues that ruin the game right now in my opinion. I am sure this game will get much better as Damian continues to update and balance it. Even as it is now, If you like the idea and are willing to deal with minor early access issues as the game grows and improves, you will likely enjoy this game. I wholeheartedly reccomend it.",1518189469,1518385986,True,111,3,0.867838501930236816,3,True,False,True,False,,,
