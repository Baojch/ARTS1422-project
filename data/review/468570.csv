My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Unterstützt von einer KI forscht die Protagonistin auf der Raumstation sowie auf dem Planeten Ancyra nach dem Verbleib ihrer Kollegen und ergründet dabei die Geschichte hinter dem Verschwinden aller Menschen.

[b]Besonderheit:[/b]

Leider nicht mehr auf Steam erhältlich ist das Spiel ""Planet Ancyra Chronicles"", das den Vorgänger ""Solarix"" sowie die SIm ""De-Void"" als ein zusammen hängendes Spiel enthält. Es ist aber durchaus noch bei Händlern zu finden und sehr empfehlenswert für alle, die Solarix als reine Laufsimulation spielen möchten, denn die Horrorelemente wurden entfernt - sterben geht also nicht, übrig bleibt die Stimmung und die Geschichte. Nebenbei bemerkt hat die ""Chronicles""-Version wesentlich mehr Errungenschaften als Solarix + De-Void, was (für mich) das Spielerlebnis noch vertieft hat.

Auch 5 Jahre nach Veröffentlichung noch eine sehr schöne Sim, die ich nur empfehlen kann.",1634427280,1684837600,True,6,0,0.568481922149658203,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Unlike many, I also appreciate walking simulators and a more narrative approach without much game challenge per se, so that's not the issue either.

De-Void has a sci-fi setting (a plus for me), good (although repetitive) graphics, a nice ambient soundtrack and good voice acting, and yet I'm sad to say as a game it fails miserably. Walking simulator doesn't mean ""aimlessly wander around without a clue about what you're supposed to do"", which unfortunately is exactly what De-Void is. More than once you'll find yourself in huge environments that are completely empty apart from a few trigger points scattered around, which are of course few and in between, and often look exactly the same as a ton of other non-interactive elements. More than once you find yourself sowewhere without a clue of where to go: the log is useless, the guiding voice too, and of course no map to be found. One may argue that maybe this was exactly what developers wanted: make you feel lost. All they managed to accomplish this way, IMHO, is a frustrating and sometimes infuriating experience.

Had this game been a 30-45 minutes narrative experience, with much less focus on the aimless walking, I would probably have recommended this, as the bits you read/hear around, and the story that unfolds, is eventually interesting enough.

Ein Außenposten auf einem weit entfernten Planeten Ancyra. Von den Einwohnern der Kolonie fehlt jede Spur. Also machen wir uns auf, das Rätsel zu lösen.

WIr sind Elizabeth Woolgather, gehen durch die leeren Gänge der riesigen Station. Einträge in Computern und Sprachnachrichten geben uns eine Ahnung davon, was auf dem Planeten wohl passiert ist. Zudem gibt uns das Protokoll-Programm Wilco wichtige Hinweise. Und wir können einige Objekte auch in die Hand nehmen und genauer betrachten. 

Die Welt, die Station wirkt riesig. Eine Form von Einsamkeit ist spürbar. Später bewegen wir uns auch in Außenbereichen der Kolonie auf der Planetenoberfläche. 

Wirklich viel zu tun gibt es nicht. Es geht vielmehr um die Stimmung, das Erkunden, das Nachempfinden der gut geschriebenen Geschichte. Solche gern als Walking-Simulatoren verspotteten Titel sind sicher nicht für Jeden etwas. Und doch kann man in die Welt eintauchen, wenn man sich darauf einläßt, denn die Atmosphäre stimmt.

Die Grafik ist technisch bestenfalls Mittelmaß, weiß aber dennoch geschickt mit Weite und Raum umzugehen. Die Musik sollte man lieber ausmachen. Zum Einen loopt sie viel zu schnell, zum Anderen realisiert sich das Gefühl der Einsamkeit in der relativen Stille weitaus besser. Dafür machen die Sprecher einen richtig guten und professionellen Job.

You dont do anything in these type of games, you just take in the environment and the setting. So if you dont like this concept, move along.

Now what is good or bad in this particular walking sim. The graphics are quite alright, if you switch it to 1920x1080 you should be fine. I had I genuine sense of wonder in the first chapter of the game, although as I kept playing the visual appeal continued to fade. The game creates an interesting sense of scale, you feel as though the giant building and machinery really are the size youd expect them to be.

Soundtrack is alright. Low end sci-fi music that blends well with the environment. Voice acting is also decent.

The story is where it kind of fells apart. Its told through audio logs, written messages and some dialogue. While the beginning sets a good premise, the mystery as to what really happened and why it happened is explained in a vague way and it left me confused.

Level design is also an area where they did some mistakes, specifically, the vast open areas in chapter 2.  There is this huge desert area where you can look between ruble for audio logs, but theyre so far spread out that you will spend at least 15 minutes just running from one to another. And there isnt anything particular to look at while running all this time. I dont think its necessary to go through this area and that does create a good sense of scale, but still, I think there could have been a better way to do that.

I found the game to be fairly enjoyable. People who like scifi and walking sims should be pleased. Just keep in mind what youre getting into as well as the potential shortcomings and you should be fine.

A walking simulator with very little substance.

There's no inventory or map, and the different areas of the same level lack distinctive features, so most of my time was spent wandering and/or backtracking, looking for where I was supposed to go next.  The level design is bland and repetative, with Gamecube-era graphics.  There are few objects to interact with, and of the ones that are interactable, only the terminals actually do anything.

The story itself seems confusing and un-noteworthy.  This is apparently a prequel to another game, so maybe I had to play that one first to understand it.  However it seems unlikely it would be enjoyable even then.

    [*]I do not know how many sci-fi-themed walking sims are out there but De-Void is one of them. I am the fan of the genre so I am a bit biased here as I usually recommend most of these short, little games.
    [*]De-Void tells the story of a remote colony - this is a tale taking place long in the future when the population of Earth is already facing a lot of issues due to low resources. Meet Planet Ancyra, a place of refuge and perhaps the only salvation of humanity. But then communications are lost so our heroine is sent in to investigate only to find nobody.
    [*]The above is not exactly true as there are indeed no living beings but there is an A.I. called Wilco who assists us along the way. This is a walking sim where you explore the base and use a lot of computers to find texts to read and video logs to play, all in order to decipher the puzzle of the missing personnel. I liked the logs talking about the Planet Loss Syndrome (PLS): an illness with some awful symptoms for those missing the good old blue planet!
    [*]De-Void is mediocre at best in terms of graphics. It is not really optimised well and here and there you can find some glitches. I believe this is understandable as it is a low budget product - the atmosphere certainly compensates especially when you are able to finally put on the VR Helmet to be able to see the crew members... 
    [*]When discounted you can get De-Void for as low as 1 EUR. In fact, the product called Planet Ancyra Chronicles comes bundled with it. Apparently, there is a prequel to this game titled Solarix and Planet Ancyra is the release of both under one title. Interesting. I will get there, in the meantime, grab this one if you like walking sims and great sci-fi. You know, the ones that make you ponder about your existence in the universe.

playing this game is pretty much pointless if you don't know solarix and you don't plan to get it. obviously you can still play de-void but you will end up with a story that has more holes than swiss cheese. 

even if you own solarix i don't recommend this game for a very simple reason: there is just not enough substance to justify buying it!
you get some extra text messages and voice logs and a small piece of bonus plot but it doesn't really impact the big picture.
like with solarix piecing together the story is a task in itself since you don't get a journal or log and you have to make connections  to people and events as you go. or you just miss all that since you can't re-read older notes.
also about 2/3 of all locations are almost exact copies of the original solarix locations so you don't even get a real chance to explore a lot of new real estate.

i don't even know why this game exists. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

if you still want to buy any of this just for the story i recommend you take a look at 'planet ancyra chronicles'. that's de-void combined with an enemy-free version of solarix to avoid the rather underwhelming stealth gameplay of the original solarix. the story of both games combined is still worthwhile.",1521677731,1521677731,False,2,0,0.54314720630645752,0,False,False,False,False,,,

游戏里的最终“boss”是被称为“E.Y.E（全能之眼）”的一种神秘力量[spoiler] [strike] 暗示某某会？	[/strike]	[/spoiler]。它以男性声音的特征出现，不时的引导主角以达到“占据”[spoiler] 数字化？	[/spoiler]她的目的。个人设想，等到将来科技发展到顶尖时，会不会也会发现同样的来自宇宙的神秘力量？我们是否会为了掌握这种力量而为之投入大量精力，甚至痴狂，成为它的“信徒”？也许，“科学的尽头是神学”吧。
+游戏对于多种环境氛围塑造到位
+背景音乐不错
+一般喜加一就可以得到

-除了走路以外没有更多的游戏性
-对路痴不太友好
6/10
喜欢喜加一并且喜欢步行模拟器的可以玩一下

Данный проект рассказывает нам предысторию женщины, которая впоследствии стала одним из персонажей игры Solarix.
Игровой процесс представляет собой симулятор ходьбы (скорее, западания кнопки Shift) с возможностью активировать переключатели и открывать письма на компьютерах. Врагов нет, прыжок отсутствует - спасибо, что хоть спринт не вырезали! Переключатели лифтов теперь работают только в одну сторону: выпали - загружаете сохранение. Уже ставшим классическое застревание в предметах осталось на месте. 
Что же в игре плохого? А то, что 3 из 4 глав - это перетекстурированные копии уровней из всё той же Solarix. Причем на двух из них поработали с освещением (туман и метель), так что прохождение будет затруднено и искусственно увеличится время пребывания в приквеле (час-полтора вместо тридцати минут).

Как DLC за несколько десятков рублей для игроков, знакомых с первоисточником и считающих его довольно сносным творением - вполне себе ничего. Остальные - увы, мимо!

Some people dismiss this genre of games, wittily called ""walking simulators"" as not engaging and generally boring. And, true enough, the common theme for this kind of games is lack of agency or interactivity. But if these components are missing what makes a good ""walking simulator""?

Generally the games of this genre rely heavily on observation and exploration, allowing player to experience story and world crafted by the developer via bits and pieces of information, spread across levels, something called ""environmental storytelling"". Walks between these objects and reveals serve as a sort of a mental buffer for a player, a way to process new information and tie it into the mental model of the game universe he's building in his head. Additionally, such walks are best accompanied by expressive environment and music, serving to cement mood and impression the game is going for. And of course the centerpiece of this exposition is the story that is woven into gameplay, the characters, the mysteries.

Unfortunately, De-Void does none of it right.
Perhaps, the best parts of the game are voice acting and music. That's not to say that they are excepionally good or memorable, it's just that these components of the game were good enough. Other than that the game fails miserably at what it's trying to be. The levels and environment and bland and washed-out, offering little to no entertainment during the soul-draining walks from one point of interest to another, some of which can take several minutes. These points of interest themselves are mostly audio or text logs from other people you never encounter and have absolutely no emotional attachement to. The protagonist is similarly bland and uninspiring, simply a vessel, moved by players hand through empty vastness of scarcely populated levels. The only discernible purpose such long walks serve in this case is to pad the length of the game. On top of that at times your vision will be obscured by weather, making navigation all but impossible. And no map, of course. Where we're going we don't need maps.

It all could've been saved by a good story, a decent mystery to solve. But unfortunately, no, instead of such we get pretentious and obtuse pseudo-philosophycal ramblings about the nature of man and abrupt ending, which ties none of what we've seen up until this point together. The parts of story and world feel disjointed and don't fit into a whole.

Throw some gameplay bugs on top of that (I've got stuck into tight spaces a couple of times) and you've got a failed attempt at a ""walking simulator"".

This game is about nothing else but pointlessly wantering around in very poorly designed areas that are completely and utterly without any purpose. The story is.... a piece of pointless nothingness (see more at the spoiler part).

The interactivity is near to 0, you can use ONE ITEM in the whole game, all the rest is automatic doors and about 5 elevator buttons. That's that. Even though it wouldn't be such a bad thing, as the game could be awesome even like that - it is NOT.




**WARNING, SPOILER ALERT**

Okay, so seriously, the story is basically nonexistent. There's this girl who wakes up, we have no idea about who she is (player character), or what is her purpose here. Then we find out that ""something is very wrong"" and all people are gone. So we start to work together with this AI, then we get a helmet TO BE ABLE TO LIVE/SEE EMOTIONS (this is the only item we can take in the game) and then we wander around.

Then we pass out and we are in the desert. Yes, no point, nothing. Then we go back, the AI friend does an examination, turns out we have about 37 thousand people's neural activity, then we wander around and then we have the truth: this alien is here to destroy, or whatever, but it just used us and it says thank you. Then the credits roll.

This game is all about exploration but exploration becomes a chore when you want to go to bed, to work or whatever rl things you want to do.

Well with a map it would not have taken me 4 hours in chapter 2, I would have had some sleep, I would have been able to finish it, I would have liked it and I would have recommended it.

[h1] Overview [/h1]

De-Void is a first person adventure / exploration game. You will find yourselves impersonating Elizabeth, one of the many workers aboard a space station orbiting a planet apparently suitable for colonization that has been found. But from the first moments, you will realize something is not right. The entire station lies deserted, and communications are silent. Something happened, and you somehow have been spared from all of it. Helped by Wilco, the station's artificial intelligence, you will have to find out what happened to everyone, first on the station and then on the planet itself, where something very strange has been discovered.

===

[h1] Gameplay Analysis [/h1]

The gameplay of De-Void is the one typical of a graphical adventure game, despite the fact this one is fully tridimensional which is rather unusual for this genre, but stripped of many layers of depth and down to the bare minimum: in this game there are only five controls, the WASD keys to move of course, and then left click to interact with an object. With such minimal controls, every player would expect great levels of interaction, analysis, description and things to find out around the game environment, but De-Void is not the case...

There are basically just three types of interactable objects in the entire game, the first are doors, which will open automatically when a certain condition has been met, and not before (even if they are supposed to, the game gives no real story-wise explaination of why they should not be opening). The second type of interactions will be with computer screens, datapads and buttons, which will usually play an audiolog or activate an elevator when pressed, and the last interaction will be with very few objects the player will be able to pick up, rotate, examine (without any description o sorts or other types of analysis) and then put down in the exact sam eposition. Basically a 3D model view. The interaction count in this game is very small, very linear and very average at best. Interactiveness is the core element of games like this and in De-Void has been totally stripped bare.

The main goal of this title is to follow the instructions of Wilco, our computer assistant, which will tell us what to do and suggest how to progress. There is some exploration inc ertain areas, especially on the planet surface, to be done, but mostly the environment is very empty and devoid (no pun intended) of any interaction whatsoever. You will walk and walk and walk through unresponsive and static environments just to find the next door to get in and so unlock the following part of the chapter. 

The story upon which the game is based is a bit interesting for some aspects, but in large part is an overused clichè: ""humans have dug out something ancient beyond their compresion from somewhere in space, BIG mistake, now everything has gone to hell"". Mission control calling originality, please respond! That bit of mystery the story lingers around is not even remotely sufficent to hook any player to it for long.



===

[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]

De-Void uses the Unreal Engine 3 graphics engine, nothing wrong with that even if it's a bit outdated now that its number 4 counterpart has come out.

Speaking of general graphics, De-Void is set on pretty low standards from the current gaming generation. Such lacking may be justified by great artistic direction, but there is none of that in this title: environments have ups and downs in both design and quality of textures, models and meshes, you will more than once notice different resolution textures in the same environment creating a very unpleasant contrast, models are jagged and nowhere near the average standards of the current industry, effects are minimal aswell apart from a very persistent distance fog which is totally unjustified for what this game delivers.

Speaking of Performance, the game runs pretty well, also thanks to its quite dated engine and the lack of details and polygon counts in most areas (in some areas it looked like we were back to Quake 2, but that was just a dream), but luckily there were no major issues in this aspect.

Speaking of bugs and problems, a game of this kind should hardly have any, but still the level design is sometimes faulty, so the player can manage to get stuck inside some rubble with no exit, and will have to restart the entire chapter from the beginning since... there is no game save except for the BEGINNING of each chapter! You heard it right. Apart from this totally MINOR fault, there are no other issues in this aspect.

Speaking of sound design, we are on an acceptable level, sufficent at most but not too bad. Sounds are coherent with the environment we found ourselves in and are not glitched or low quality.

In conclusion on the technical part, we stand in front of a game coming from many years ago but made in the current generation, and not even that well.

===

[h1] Conclusion And Rating [/h1]

De-Void is an exploration adventure game which has been brutally mutilated of the core gameplay elements which make this genre great, down to the minimum to function. It is not sufficent in Technical and Gameplay parts by far, and i do not recommend this game for its current pricing at all.

I respect the efforts and talent of the creators, yet the game fails to deliver a stringent experience for me as a player.
Though I did not encounter serious bugs or glitches, there were too many small ones that spoiled a fluent gameplay.
De-Void did not present too much of a challenge, only some rudely unspecific directions fom the AI left me wandering through the scenery to somewhat stumble upon the next required step.
The control of movement is rudimentary - left, right, forward, back. Annoyingly two-dimensional.
The subtitles cannot be de-activated, at least I did not find a respective setting despite my best efforts.
The transition between chapters is a bit lame, but this is the product of a small indepedent studio, so I do not mean to be pedantic.
The fact that you can't save your progress at your own discretion is a most annoying subject of the game.

There are positive aspects to De-Void.
The voice-overs are quite decent, and even though the gaphics are not stellar, I rather enjoyed the scenery.
Some philosophical thoughts are being introduced, and if you take the time and patience to look around more thoroughly you can appreciate some nice details and clues.

The story has a lot of potential that unfortunately has not been sufficiently exploited. That is a real pity.

All in all I do not begrudge the developers the money I payed, but I can't recommend the game in good conscience.

First off, voice acting.
I disliked all the voice acting except for 2 characters, the character you play and the AI that gives you 'missions', they are the 2 main characters.
There is nothing more to say about that, bad voice acting is bad voice acting. It doesn't feel engaging, it's too obvious someone is just reading a script in a studio, not good at displaying emotion etc...

Story was just bad, didn't seem very well thoughout.
I will admit though that the first 10 minutes made me feel hyped, the story seemed cool then, but it very quickly dropped off.

Very short soundtrack.

Too much walking.
I am a fan of walking simulators, but you can't make the player walk for several minutes between anything happening if your world is dull, if you got poor graphics and virutally no selection of music.
Made the game very boring.
A walking simulator has to make up for the fact that there is barely any content, this one didn't.

This game could've been much better if it was made more linear. Give us a map and show us the path to the next objective etc...
-
You can't save your progress, so if you want to take a break you need to get to the next checkpoint for it to save your progress.
No option to disable subtitles.
This is a very bad walking simulator, the world is ugly and dull. This reminds me of Lifeless Planet, another 'Sci-fi' walking simulator that failed in every aspect that a walking simulator has to succeed in to be a good game.

PS: 5 of the 6 hours I've spent in this game are AFK'd hours, as there is no save option so I decided to leave the game open while I left.

Literally.  Don't usually get naseous, but this one you had to run.  It was just way too much empty space between locations to stop and when you did stop it was maybe for 30 seconds.  So you are just running and running while scenes fly by and you go up and down bumps with doors opening in your face,  Too much running for too little reward.

The story was interesting, but I couldn't finish it without starting to last chapter over and crossing my fingers the game wouldn't glitch out on me again.  I reached almost the end when I had to go up an elevator.  Push button and start to rise, hear engine and then ... nothing.  I go nowhere and now I can't use elevator any more.  So, I thought maybe it wasn't important and looked at someone's playthrough.  Grrr ... yes it was and so I can't access next active area.

That brings me to next bone of contention.  There are only three save slots in this game.  So you either have to leave it running (which is why I have long play time) when life happens or I just needed a break from wanting to throw up, or you have to restart the chapter over again - more running and reading/listening to the same logs and messages over again.  So as I contemplate the last chapter hoping this time the elevator works, ehhh, I think I'll pass.

Some bullet points if you want to ignore my nonsense.


PROS:
>Promising story!
>Interesting story development through clues around the levels
>Solid music
>Decent character development

CONS:
>So much excessive, unnecessary walking between stuff.
>Unclear idea of directive, where things are, and sometimes even what to do
>Much of the story left with loose ends, undeveloped, or ignored
>Game ends abruptly
>Next to no player choice
>Lack of character development for the main two characters
>Easy to get caught and stuck on certain objects
>No easy saving mechanism
>Short:  Can probably be done in less than 25 minutes by someone who knows where to go, and maybe an hour at most if they look at all the little details


This game lacks just about everything I like in a game.  As a huge sci-fi fan, this one was a total disappointment.

Firstly, I'll share what I liked.  The story was kinda neat, and seemed very promising!  On the one hand, it had me asking questions about it!  That's a great sign that I've been drawn in.  On the other hand, most of those questions went unanswered.  When the game ended, abruptly at that, I felt hugely let down by the fact that there were SO MANY loose ends left untouched, so many questions left, and a very, very unsatisfying resolution.  What did I expect from such a short game?  Even a game like Antichamber, which had no built in story, had me feeling emotional over it at the end.  This one?  My first thought was, ""wait, that's it??""

The gameplay was about what you'd expect from someone who just learned to design a game and made their very first one - hurriedly, and excitedly, to show their friends they can do something other than stroking their own genitalia.  ""Walking Simulator"" is a great tag for it.

This game would have been far better in a different medium - a visual novel, or even just a short story with pictures.  There were some collision issues that had me having to restart a chapter right before I got to the end, because I was stuck on some object.  Then about 80% of the game was spent with me running around through vast, mostly oversized landscapes with no clue of what in the hell I was supposed to be doing.  It was hard to follow.  Things were named inappropriately for what they were.  There were references to things that might be worth checking out that weren't even in the game (like the oasis).  There were even little rovers sitting around the landscape, even having one of those as driveable would have made that desert wander a lot lot lot more manageable.  Again, ""Walking Simulator"".

To the studio, if you're going to do a story based game, make it about the story.  This game was released 18 days ago.  The clunky gameplay made it seem like it was from when I was a lil kid playing Doom without my parents permission back in 1999 or something.  It totally distracted from the story and made it easy to miss details littered sparingly across the map.

Lack of story developement. Before anyone jumps to the defense of the studio I'd like to point out that I enjoyed the game, I just felt it was devoid of so many smaller points that could have really helped me emerse myself into the genre. 

Spoilers, please be warned. 

The environment felt like a mix of 80s Doom2 cover art over boxy 3d objects, and when it came time for something different they just lazily pulled the textures off and let you walk around the world in grey waiting for a voice to pop up. In certain places objects made no sense as touch pads (for show and not utility) were at different levels as if you could touch one but you had to jump for others. 

Also if people just vanished, would their cloths? Wouldn't there be visual record of people... joining this ... conscisousness? 

The intents of W1LCO and AM1 for example seemed just limited to an only talked about AI and one that just kinda strung you along and you willingly follow it instead of looking for more info. 

Why have objects you can pick up and look at if they do nothing. A shuttle with a cargo hold that is basically a bedroom, and a ramp out.. but no way into the cockpit? I could understand automation but surely you're not an animal on a plane, it makes no sense to me. 

Shadows. Maybe this is the issue with the engine used for the game, and it relates to my issue before in textures, but shadows could have gone a long way to created a more mysterious and creepy vibe as you are the only person... living thing on the station and planet. 

Cut scenes would have been nice. A grander look at the colony and the station perhaps? Or even just transition from station to planet side. Also, I felt the faithful and the back story were not fleshed out enough. They really meant nothing to me, or even the story. 

There were also transitions where the character seemed to jump for seemingly no reason from one place to another, and there was no way to understand why later on except to walk around till you found things to click and press. There was no buildup of trust with anything, no really need for me to do anything but walk, click on a few things... and run away from large rolling pollen balls that actually did NOTHING save bring upon louder ominous music. 

I got the intent, but the reasoning behind it bothered me. The artifact they found wasn't explained, shown, or really even anything other than a mental marker...

In the end 8 bucks, an hour or two later, I feel kinda let down. I just felt the story could have been more fleshed out. And while I did enjoy it, I can't recomend this game. I think it's probably my first game that I can say if I had the choice I wouldn't have purchased this as the game stands. If this has been an alpha or other early release game. Yes. I'd buy it. But even if later patches fix things or do any modifications, I just can't find myself thumbs upping this game.

Concernant De-Void,

Un petit jeu assez sympa, une sorte de simulateur de marche de l'espace, même si graphiquement on a vu largement mieux pour du 2016 et sur le moteur UnrealEngine on sent qu'il y a eu des efforts dans l'ensemble et sur certains plans (puis faut pas oublié que c'est une équipe indépendante qui est derrière), l'histoire est pas mauvaise même si elle n'est pas extraordinaire, ca reste correcte dans l'ensemble, par contre le jeu est court (comptez 1h30 pour les rapides et 2h en flânant pour le finir).

Il est clair qu'ici il ne faut pas s'attendre a du très lourd, mais pour son prix ca reste pas mal, il y a eu bien pire dans le domaine et plus cher. 

Du coup pouce bleu pour ma part car c'est de l'indé et donc ca le mérite et ce n’est pas des plus mauvais.

Pros: 
- really enjoyed the visuals, and the imagination of the visuals.  Is not all about super high res textures, but more about the massiveness and scale of the world and efforts to make it seem like a functional lived-in space with purpose.  The world worked for me.
- I like to look around and take in the world, and this game accomodates that for the most part (although the final levels offer less than the first parts of the game in that regard).
- for much of the game my imagination had fun.  I play games as much for ideas and feelings they inspire as much as what's literally in the game, and I had fun with this.
- I thought the voice acting was good
- I'm a fan of the ""Roanoke"" mystery type story where ""something happened and nobody-knows- what"" type story, and ""you to go figure it out"".

Cons
- I was a tad let down by the story.  Toward the end I felt less exploratory and more on rails. I'm unsure if there was a different ending, but I could see no other path to take.  In general, I'm not a fan of unreliable narrator stories because they often take away some of the agency from the player and don't give options, requiring you to play along. I'll probably try again.to see if I missed something - maybe there is alternate ending?.  
- some of the transitions seemed rough, inadvertently ended level before I wanted, and I had some audio cut ins/outs
- got caught on edges a several times, and fell through floor once.  Probably not an issue unless you explore every nook and cranny like I tend to do.  There's no need to get into tight spaces, so just don't go there.  I would've liked a few more rewards for exploration.

Overall though, if you like space themes and walking sims, this is a good game and I recommend without hesitation.  I tend to play slowly and explore thoroughly and ended w/ 5 hrs. 

The game reminded me a lot of Spirits of Xanadu, so if you like this, try that, or if you like Xanadu, try this.  Anyhow, all the best. Good game


Original reveiw below:
Since this is a new game I wanted to go ahead and leave this brief review for anyone considering it.  It caught my eye on the new releases sections as I tend to enjoy type stories of ""something bad has happenened in deep space and you're sent to figure out what went wrong.""  I'm not finished with De-void yet (not sure how close I am to finish, but maybe near), but wanted to let folks know this is an interesting and well done exploration walking sim w/ a good mystery like story behind it that keeps you searching and exploring.  The visuals and imagery are quite inspiring also.

The only technical issues I've encountered so far are some audio that cuts in/out abrubtly during some scene changes, and a few places where you can get caught up in the environment.  I had to us unreal console commands ""ghost"" and ""walk"" a few times (press ` first) to untangle myself or escape.  But overall I'd say my issues were more from me trying to sneak into tight areas that are easily avoided if you don't prowl around every nook and cranny like I do sometimes.

Audio is very well done as well.  Overall, this is a polished and engaging experience so far.  It caught my eye in new releases and hasn't diasappointed.  I'll try to update when I finish, but it's 2:00 in the morning and I gotta go to bed for now.  ;-)",1472969418,1473038036,True,6,0,0.477614283561706543,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Being I haven't had a chance to play through the story all the way yet I will say nothing on the story itself, just gameplay and the like.  On to the actual review! 

Graphics: Let's get this out of the way right now, graphics don't make the game but they sure help it, thats no exception here with De-void. The graphics are great for this Sci-Fi game, they are clear, crisp and I just loved the way the world looks with all the different environments shown. 

Sound: The music is good and doesn't make you wanna tear off your ears after hearing the loop for the 100th+ time. There is different music for different points in the game and environments so it's not the same song looping through the whole game. The Voice acting is pretty good in the game, not great but its not bad, so its more Meh then anything, all characters are voiced and it works out pretty well for what they were going for.

Gameplay: The real maker or breaker of the game. The game plays really well with very little UI, it has smooth animations and the game world is well put together where you know where you are going next with only alittle need for help at some points (Yea I might be blind sometimes lol). along with that intractable laptops and tablets throughout the world that you can interact with so that you can piece together the puzzle of what happened to the lost colony. The AMBER Helmet is a really nice thing they added (Story point I'm not explaining) and it adds another “Level” to the levels already in place. 

Story: Going to edit later with my thoughts on the story once I beat it.

PROS:
Gameplay.
Story (So far and is subject to change)
Graphics (Maybe not AAA quality but still great).
Music isn't tear inducing.

Meh: Voice acting at times is Meh, Not good but not bad enough to make it a con. It leans more on the good side but there are some characters that are worse then others. 

CONS: 
Lack of direction at times. 
No instructions on what button does what at any given time. (Granted theres only some 7 ish buttons but still).
