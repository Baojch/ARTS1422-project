The AI ​​cheats way too much for a sandbox game. Which makes it almost impossible to win without exploiting diplomacy. Due to the amount of micro management, it is impossible to manage a large empire. There are also a number of bugs and exploits in the game that you will encounter again and again. 

In principle it is not interesting to have more than 1 city and to develop it completely. After that there is little more to do in the game. This makes the idea of ​​starting a new game in your old world not interesting.

The game certainly has potential, but it is not being developed further. Don't expect much from it.

The core of the game, the RTS battles, need a ton of work, there's missing animations for cavalry units, no complex formations, no different movement modes (running vs walking), no queuing orders (move here then there), no naval battles (in a game were vikings are a thing), spear units (both mounted and on foot) use the same animation as long axes, swinging their spears instead of thrusting with them. The battles are fun, don't misunderstand me, it's because the game is fun that it shortcomings stick out.

There's mod support but the modding scene for this game is as dead as the development.

If they had a middle option it would be that, but I do give props for one person making the entirety of this title, so I’ll go with a positive rating than a negative. 

This title has potential and it would’ve knocked other titles out of the water if it had a bigger developer team. It’s a one man team and the fact this person made so much by himself is rather amazing feat. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get into it and my reasons are as followed:

I’ve seen plenty of bugs throughout the game even with it being released on the final version. I do like the use of RTS mix with huge battles that of Total War titles and even some sim management to that of Grand Ages. Unfortunately, it’s not ironed out in terms of being smooth transition from one stage to the next. I’d see AI just completely sit there during battles or on the management side of things the cities would lose food constantly even though you’re producing more food than there are people (this includes fighting off bandit/enemy factions that try to raid/rob your villages).

The UI could’ve use improvement and the use of hotkeys would be beneficial too. A lot more customization would have done wonders too since your character is more or less on the RPG stage in terms of leveling up, attributes, leading, etc. It felt slow and clunky at times, but I just couldn’t get into even though I enjoy the concept of the title very much so. I don’t want to sit here and ridicule a title that one person put his soul and heart into, so I’ll keep it short and hopefully sweet for others who are more into Indie titles. Again, great job by the developer for what he was able to accomplish.

1 hour- This was plenty enough time to play the tutorial and mess around a little in the actual game.

Outside of combat, gameplay seems to be more or less your standard civ builder; gather resources, manage your cities/population, and build up your army. Inside of combat, every troop you've trained takes their very own place on the battlefield- even you. It is reminiscent of Warband's combat, only from an overview POV rather than actually fighting.

Like, what if I want a crew of axe throwers with shields? or maybe I want to make horse mounted archers... or knife throwing spearman. 

Generic units taken from strategic tactical rpg ish games. 

Also, moving units, they clump up so damn much and theres no attack move from what I can see. This means they rush in and the enemy gets first hit because my units havent finished their move command. I had this happen when I was trying to edge some archers... the enemy sent their archers and I didnt notice until one of my men dropped. showing me the enemy was shooting at me. theres no reason my men should just stand there and get shot up just because I keep telling them to move another few 'feet' forward. 

I havent seen it yet, I hope heroes can have ranged weapons.

*edit* 
So, I actually just encountered a game breaking mechanics.... its not even a bug. 

I had 78 troops, at least 10 were cavalry, 15 were ranged units from fowlers to actual archers, 30 were peasents, and then I had an assortment of melee types from axemen, serfs, etc... and two heros with one who had leadership 4 or something like that.

I took this army and attacked an army of 11 barbarians.... using auto resolve... guess who won? Whatever is used to determined auto resolve is just (in my opinion) irredeamable, unexcusable, and a game breaker.

Under no circumstances should this be compared to Mount and Blade Warband.

This game crashes about 2-3 times a day for me. It happens intermittently as well, which means I can't point at a single cause. Other than the lack of stability, the game concept is a great idea and I hope to change this review when the developers put some more work behind it. But this game should be Early Access, not an official release.

Otherwise the game gets a little dull after about half an hour. I've restarted my character so many times, as the game's difficulty has spikes. The AI will all level considerably faster than you, and most will start with multiple settlements, even when you start as a settlment owner. So they just edge you out of resources you need to even level up your town from the beginning. Leaving you feeling a little cheated, more than beaten.

Combat is somewhat generic and seems to rely heavily on numbers. Since much of my game time has been spent restarting before I could reach a level 3 town, you might imagine that I haven't had the opportunity to test this with higher tier troops. you would be correct.

It's just not a very ergonomic game, the UI is a little rough in some places and there isn't a lot of depth to the game. Once you start out as a baron (which is an option), you pretty much have seen as high as you're going to get and there is no point in starting out as a lower class, simply because you will be lucky to get anywhere.

Overall, it just feels incomplete, or almost like what we expect from mobile games these days. There isn't enough there in terms of roleplay or story, or diplomacy (the last of which is essentially a single skill on your character and a percentage chance for the target to accept a bribe or trade). You can't even call allies to your aid or use spies to see an enemy attack coming, etc. etc. Too many missed opportunities.

Side note to my potential detractors: I'm well accustomed to difficult and long games. Having played an incredible amount of tabletop roleplay games where a single story can take 1-3 real life years to complete. That's not even counting the number of simulations and hardcore games I enjoy.

I decided to try playing this game again two years after its release. I gave it a negative review back then. And I still give it a negative review.

There seems to have been little to no difference in the game since 2018. The micro-management is infuriating when you are dealing with a bad camera control. There's little to no difference in speed when you play on highest graphics or lowest graphics.

It looks like a top-down version of Mount and Blade, only with worse graphics, and you cant control a person to fight with. It appeared to have tried to mimic a strategy game too, although it was not a very good mimicry. Its nothing like Total War....its closer to Stronghold, and it does that badly.

Basically, you take Total War, Mount and Blade and Stronghold, smash it onto one game, strip the best parts of the game down to a bare state....and you have Veil of Crows.

There is apparently mod support, but good luck finding anything. I just checked and there was like....three mods that don't really do anything, two change the starting stats of your game start and one that adds a banner. It makes zero effect on game play.

The idea is good, it has potential, but that's it, its just got potential, I don't think it will ever get past that stage.

いったん戦闘に入ると、Total WarみたいなRTS。M&Bみたいに自キャラがうまく立ち回れば勝てるってものではないので、まずは部隊の数揃えないと、7人くらいのBanditにも瞬殺される。なお戦闘画面のメニュー画面はESCで閉じられる、不思議。

There is also a sandbox mode for more direct tweaking. Towns produce gold through taxation, consume food, and collect resources from nearby mines, farms, and quarries. These resources can be used to construct new buildings and raise troops. Quests can be undertaken from neutral villages, while other factions in the game can be traded with or fought. Combat involves giving orders to troops using cumbersome, non-intuitive controls that use keyboard buttons instead of interface icons. The game world is an effective setting, with other factions going about their business before you intervene. The beginning of each scenario can be slow as you wait for resources to accumulate and better units to unlock, but large battles between different factions await. Overall, Veil of Crows is very reminiscent of Mount & Blade, except with RTS-style battles in place of third-person combat, and is a mostly successful pivot of that construct.

Good concepts, but I expected more from this game than what is originally there. The current trade system doesn't work.. I trade bread for 3 gold and my inventory has no gold.. How can you start from nothing if you cannot get the coin to be something, doing quests with no inventory yields to doing quests that lead to no rewards. The reward system is based on available inventory, and not for Gold. It seems you have to take things over to get any where in this game; instead of, ranking your character by many battles and selling loot.. The only decent way to play this game is by being a baron or sandbox to get unlimited men.. Then you have to fight AI town/castles that have double the men constantly than what is available to the player. Easy quests yield enemies that have brigands that completely devistate any new hopes defeating enemies without ample Gold to hire double the men.

M &Bと比べるとイベントとか無いし決まったキャラがいないからゲームとして薄く感じるかもしれないけど、戦場の雰囲気はこっちのが出てる。
あとAIの敵が斬られた時のリアクション？反応の動きはこの値段のゲームにしてはよくできてると思う。首飛んだり血吹き出したりとかもあるし。

Total Warと比べると兵士一人一人を操作できるし、一人称視点にできるのはtotal warの戦闘より個人的には楽しい。

設定によるけど、デフォルトが自軍300人くらいまでしか出撃できないので、Total Warの戦闘と比べると規模は小さい、あと城も小さい。

ヒーローユニットはそんなに多くないけど装備買ってグラフィック変わるから愛着湧くかも。

あんまり選択肢ないけどモブ兵士も装備変えたりできます。

まだ内容薄いので妄想で補完できる方なら値段分は楽しめるはず。

[h1][b]Disclaimer: Its a YES for the idea and general concept of a game which I find very interesting and fun to toy with, for most other things its a NO.[/b][/h1]

First of all, I have to write about the reviews claiming that its not simillar enough to M&B(Mount & Blade) thus negtive review. These reviews should be taken down honestly, ayone coming into this game expecting it to be M&B2 clearly hasnt read the description nor looked at the videos, these people are just dumb and hurt the creator for their own idiocy. Its a M&B sandbox concept, but a different genre with some shared similarities. Now on to the game.

As in the disclaimer, I enjoy the concept and general idea as this is something that brew in my mind since I got to play M&B,  The idea of creating a kingdom but in more of RTS setting. What really caught my attention though was the army customization, I always wanted to do that in M&B, you know, get the equipment to play an actual role too, govern it and distirbute among troops. So yes, its another take on M&B style sandbox and I like the idea BUT....

All other aspects are lacking, from graphics trough UI to design chocies. I can swallow bad graphics no problem, but the map is very very hard to read and tiring to look at or even move around it, this I cant overlook. UI is horrible, disorienting, messy, badly designed for most part, unresponsive, some gameplay mechancis seem doubtfull (though I didint explore the game enough to make thsi a solid point), for example my first run:

Lack of funds ->Try to establish trade route -> cant due to not good enough relations -> take up a quest to improve relations -> quest is to kill 200 storng army -> cant due lack of funds. 

So first minutes of gameplay and I already fell into a loop. I will admit that I didnt play long enough do dig into other options that there might be but at this point I got so tired and annoyed by the UI and map itself that I just had to quit.

So its a YES for the idea, BUT only if the game itself sees MASSIVE improvements in all other aspects, if these wont be HUGE enough then this will be a NO. So really its a huge credit on my part to give a posstive review for game that tired me out in 50 minutes and made me quit, but I will treat it as early access syndrome and hope for the game to improve enough for me to be able to play with its cool idea.

It's like a very well and thoughtfully modernized mount and blade injected with some concepts from destructable siege games with some solid RPG and interesting politics.

All of the game systems are heavily affected by the leaders you choose in those roles which is great.  An economic leader gets a lot of exp from governing a trade town, likewise a diplomatic one gains experience from increasing the happiness in the town.  Your combat oriented leaders gain experience from the results of combat - if they boost stats of units, they get exp from the units fighting.  If their own stats are high, they get exp from dealing damage and defending.

All of your units including hero units can have their gear customized to an extent and upgraded.  

There are horizontal play options as well as interesting emergent situations.

I definitely suggest supporting this title if you're a fan of the old mount and blade and warband titles.  I'm Nox from the Taleworlds forum, author of the Bandit King mod for the original Mount and Blade, and this game has many of the interesting interactions that I added with my mod such as observer faction modifications when you affect a party.   For instance, making peace with bandits pisses people off, and starvation sieges that threaten peasants will prompt a more vigorous response.

This game is in early access, and has warts but it is solidly fun.  Expect crashes, weirdness but it's a lot better than any early access game I've played lately and even in better shape than some recent release *cough* surviving mars *cough*.

Even in early access I'd give this game a solid 3/5 stars which is about as good as an early access game can get.  If you like this genre of game I'd give it a bonus star, which would put it over the max.  

Just get it, support this dev.  They are doing it right, and it's fun.

The reality is its closer to a cross between stronghold and mount and blade. That said I'd still definitely reccomend the game. Even in its current state its worth buying and is great fun with decent replayability. It also has a very good death system. For starters death is an actual fear unlike mount and blade and if someone ticks you off you can put them to the sword. When you die you can start in the world your last character died in. Meaning even though your previous person may have died their faction can still have an impact on the world and you can monopolize on it. For instance I had a bandit run through where I occupied a key mine cutting off a factions only source of metal preventing them from fielding units. I died and had to come in as someone else however taking that mine caused the faction to ultimately collapse in external wars, allowing my new character to seize several villages before they did. Resources are important without metal and leather troops don't happen, without wood or stone buildings don't happen, and without food villagers will starve and turn to banditry. The AI, like you, needs all of these and without them they will collapse (although it takes a while).

Pros:
Customizable Faction
Different Starts ranging from bandit to lord to adventurer (about a dozen total)
Hero Equipment
Lead multiple armies in a true king like manner
Great Economic system
Good AI
Continue in the world your predassesor created

Cons:
Bad UI
Currently lacks much playability for those not trying to command armies
Still needs to flesh out a lot to be a finished game

So on the negative the user interface is still bad it took me 30 hours to figure out how to bring in reinforcing units. Also the interface, and features in general, vastly favor people leading factions rather than adventuring as a party, such as no inventory screen except in armory, having party gold separate from national gold ext. Also right now the quests vastly favor those leading factions. Even easy quests usually require a dozen or so people meaning solo adventuring simply isnt viable at the moment.

One solution I think that could solve this is making assassination quests an actual duel between heroes meaning there would be reason to actually beef up your hero and make them into a warrior rather than a commander. Also you could allow more options for you to actually work directly for lords as a warrior or captain would also help. Also I would like to see great gap between someone who has good equipment and doesn't in the armory because as is the gap is marginal at best.",1533786051,1533786091,True,68,1,0.806168675422668457,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Before we start let me just say, yes i understand this is Early Access, and am aware the game is likely missing a lot of balancing and features. 

This game is almost identical to Mount & Blade: Warband, which isn't a bad thing except it's too much like it. i feel like the game doesn't try hard enough to set itself apart from the game it was clearly inspired by. The M&B formula is solid, and fantastically fun, but when comparing the two i simply think ""Well yeah, but i can do all of this in Warband. If i wanted to do this, i could just hop on that, it's basically just a different map with some new mechanics"". The game has a few features and mechanics that Warband doesn't, and they are all great ideas. Bribing enemy armies, resource management for towns, being able to take over a town by itself with no fort to siege, different types of settlements like lumber mills and mines. The problem i have with the features i listed is it feels like it makes the game too easy. Somehow i managed to earn several thousand gold within a half hour. I was simply testing game mechanics so i took over a small lumber mill immediately on my merc band character. Town offered virtually no resistance, and i was at war with a new faction now. i think i got quite a bit of gold from taking it, but either way i just grabbed all the resources in town and all the fighters and left. No one ever even attempted to take the town from me while i was away. i went around, raided two more towns selling resources in between, and amassed a few grand. i bribed two decently sized armies from the faction i had recently turned hostile, with just a chunk of my vast wealth i was able to get a 100% bribe chance, keep in mind my character is level 1 right now. So i bought off about 60 more soldiers from 2 patrolling armies, and felt like if i raided a few towns, then bought off some more small armies i could easily build up a huge force, but i didn't, i stopped at 150. It's cool that you can bribe armies to do different things and even bribe them to join your army, i like that feature, but it's incredibly imbalanced. No skill requirements for bribing any size force, no caps to how many soldiers can follow you at once, no skill caps to increase bribe chance, it's just you can bribe any army no matter how massive to join yours (I haven't tested this extensively but i'm pretty sure there are no size caps) as long as you have enough gold, the amount to bribe a decent sized force is also really easy to come by. Another thing, you pretty much never get attacked, i mean, this could easily be a feature that simply hasn't been implemented yet due to it being Early Access (or maybe my army was too big?), but i never got attacked by patrolling armies of the faction i had recently attacked, or any bandits. 

So right now the game lacks balancing, and that balancing is in your favor, the game is simply too easy. Plus, it doesn't help that the game feels like 90% of it was just a reskinned Warband mechanic. Again, not saying it's a bad thing that it is heavily influenced by Warband, but at the current time the game simply doesn't have enough to set itself apart. 

The combat in this game, for the most part, it's solid. The problem is, and it could just be my short time with this game, but the combat felt a bit bland. Yes, there's different types of units and maybe they all do different things that encourage tactics and strategy, but it was far too easy for me to bribe and raid until i amassed a big enough force to simply steamroll anything in my way, so the use of strategy was never enforced upon me.


A message for the dev, anyone else can just skip this paragraph if you want to:

This is what i have to say to you, the developer: Whenever you are able to, in your development timeline, implement a ton of features and mechanics that really set this game apart from Warband. What you have right now is solid, but it simply feels to much like a Warband copy. I don't know exactly what you should do, but there needs to be a lot of things in this game that Warband doesn't have, and not just small tweaks like bribing armies or lumbermills, big changes that greatly impact the game itself. This is my advice to you, because this game has great potential, and right now it's a decent game that i would have enjoyed much more had i never heard of Warband. As for the combat, whether or not it's already in the game or planned for it my advice remains virtually the same: Implement, or refine the implementation of unit types that have vastly different uses on the battlefield, and make sure the player knows what each of those units are good and bad at. Another thing is, it's great that the game has a third person bird's eye view for battles, and you don't feel locked to one character like in Warband, it helps set the game apart, but if you have that kind of view there should be a focus on strategy. Terrain, weather, unit types, unit experience, damage types, armor types, etc, all these should contribute to making battles dynamic so it feels like you have to plan out the battle. That's just what i reccomend for the game so it helps set itself apart from Warband. In Warband you can just amass a big army of dudes, train them, and swarm your enemies, there's not a huge focus on dynamic combat and strategy, at least in my experience. So if you did focus on strategy, it would make the game feel much different from Warband i feel. 



TL;DR 

The game feels too much like a Warband copy and the few features that are different aren't enough. 
The game feels far too easy because of some of those different mechanics. 
As an Early Access game, it's solid from my experience. Runs fine and has enough content. 
I reccomend this game as a whole and especially if you've never played Mount & Blade: Warband, but if you want a finished, more entertaining version of this game you can still always go buy that. In the future, if the dev handles this properly, it'll be a great game that doesn't feel too much like Warband, and i think it could be great, but it's not there yet.",1530807121,1530807121,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,True,False,,,

So two gold icons to monitor...  and I still do not know how much I earnt for that job!

so ....onwards.......

 ""Hello Village leader -""do you have work?"" Yes - Easy - get resources (food)  - find farm - 10x speed - no food - find a farm - 10 x speed - we have food - great - not enough men to carry - sigh ....... get more men - great .....not enough money to buy food - AGGGGGH!  ok, ok ...slow down ----- this is a game - just take it slow - try again - round two ....got enough money - buy food - go back 10 x speed -   you are attacked by an army of 41 bandits.  No money to bribe - no way of running away - no chance of winning.  I have to fight when I am 100% going to lose - so fight or ""quit to windows""

Do this 10 times before you write a review.

I applaud the idea of this game, I really do - but it is so clunky - easy to get lost - graphics are from the 1990's (overall map at least)  combat looks fun - but I came here for the whole ""start with nothing - lead an army"" -  great - but randomness - lack of easy work initially - unlucky chance encounters. Very unfriendly interface - just lacking so much.  

Good luck with this game - for now it just is a protoytpe of a good idea - beyond that, this small hope you'll overcome these annoyances.  But I enjoyed writing this review more than playing the game.

leaning toward nay at this point.
Too unoptimized. takes long to load, or to hang or even lock up the whole system. half of gametime is almost loading screens.

Game idea is cool, with lots of potential, but at this point I find myself going back to older games this got its idea from.

Things that annoy on gameplay, when sieging a town, enemy patrols can simply reinforce their town by walking in. Your army does nothing to block them.

Buildings's gold cost is too high in my opinion. It takes ages to build a town up with its low taxes. Much easier to just conquer a built one.

Most quests don't give you any information until after accepted. eg. mission title was just to defend or raid a place. You only find out its details and location 'after' accepting ie. oh no, its way on the other side of the world map...  Then you are obligated, and pay the price when you find you cannot finish it.

Then, its too easy to loose your leader in combat and then game over, whole realm is lost. start over. I understand the realism idea, but even mount/blade foresaw the problem in that and didn't let your hero die in combat, but instead get captured or just knocked out instead so your game could go on at least.

This review is not given lightly. I'd rather play some game or do something productive than waste time typing out reviews. I'm the type of old gamer that would thumbs up old dosgames which the majority of the world would downvote due to crappy graphics.

After realizing that there was only a single, devoted developer, who was constantly in contact with the community, I kept the game. I uninstalled and forgot about it until today, when I decided to give it another try. This was going to be very short  to see if the solo dev delivered on any promises. Four ""short"" hours later, only after dying, I realized that it's super late and I have to wake up early in the morning.

This early access game, like any other, still has a LOT of room for improvement (bugs, features, visuals, music, etc), but the game seems completely playable, fun as hell and very addictive! The developer does a great job communicating and keeps their promises. The tutorial only teaches you game the controls. To see some first-time-playing tips, look up some gameplay on youtube. Just make sure that it’s a recent video because the dev makes frequent updates.

To Mount and Blade fans:

If you, like me, loved Mount and Blade, then you should try this. It's NOT the same, but it does have commonalities. I do miss the first person fighting that I got in Mount and Blade and the configurable weapons, armor, etc. At this point, you will not get that (not sure if you will ever get first person). But what you do get is a much more thought out, detailed and fun campaign with a lot of interesting strategies. For example, when I started playing, I wanted to capture a gold mine next to my village, but instead of fighting and losing my men, I gave the enemy an option to leave and they took it. The quests are simple, but much more enjoyable than the ones from Mount and Blade. The battles are in 3rd person and you control your character like any other troop, which I don’t love. But you can build different siege engines and fully destroy buildings, walls and gates, which is quite fun. This is not a replacement for Mount and Blade, but in some ways, it’s even better, which is probably the best compliment that I can give it.",1514869046,1514869046,True,42,1,0.776901006698608398,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Starting from the bottom we have Character customization, as in weapons, armor, and mounts as well as points placed into skill atrributes for your Hero character and other heros you can come across. A fundamental ability to craft your ""OWN"" faction with a color scheme and symbol to stand as your house. As well as being able to build and outfit your buildings on the campaign map similar to Total War in that its broken into two fields of play the battlefield and the world map. 

Here is where it gets interesting as VoC pulls in aspects of stronghold, total war, and mount and blade to create the hybrid most RTS players have been waiting for. Your units are single stacked as well as your hero, equipment can be built for sieges and manned by certain units, you can make battle lines and set defensive or offensive behavior. Effective archer use and multiple unit classes like spears, halberdiers, dismounted knights, footmen, millitia, sworsmen, men-at arms, longbow, recurve bow, archers, cross bow,(shitload of unit variety to tickle your pickle). 

Once you get past the variety and on field battles that feel like Mount & blade action crossing stronghold theme with elements of total war strategy it ends up being fun to warch. Although they need to slow the fucking game down, the ai once set to attack tend to sprint and move too quickly to enjoy anything, also supper stuttering. 

The world map is dope though, using a map more like Mount & blade. You can create armies out of any units stationed in the town counting soldiers, heros, prisoners, peasants and even supplies which you can attach to an army depending on its size and ferry supplies. Effectively manually transfering supplies from your towns to your keep without having to upgrade the carts which leads me to my next point. The ability to upgrade towns and villages as well as interact with them and develop relations which can aide in the future. Theres a strong emphasis on supplies and upgrading but will punish you if you fail to maintain an adequate army as bandits roam free.

It's fun but can get tiring with the bugs and lack of polish. I would buy in to support the project just because the more revenue = a better end product.

While still in Early Access I want to kick in my few notes and opinions on what I think you are going to find as a consumer. In my early evaluation I have come up with a few notes, however I cannot stress enough how much I love this game, I have a feeling of, almost ""pride"", because this is exactly what I would have done with both of those titles. (early total war series and the Mount and blade series, both of which are in my favorite games of all time pile.)  This game is a winner , through and through, if Kerry walked away from the project today.. not mad... good for you. (please dont though)

The good ... well everything, As a game developer and exprerienced Early access player I know when something is not as the developer intends to leave it, and I have very few complaints from what i have seen, but here are the notes i have for things that arent so good yet and should be made better for the Early access consumers. 

The visual diversity of the units can be a little misleading in the tactical view, a lightly armored cavalryman takes way more punishment than you think he will, even surrounded by 15 men and unable to move he lasts way longer than he should, I would like to see mobility play a factor in the defensive and offensive capability of units like this, but even more i would like to see a unit mousover that summarizes the unit. (name/type , index style info)

Loot is a little lighter than I would like, Looting is near and dear to my heart and I would rather find junk I dont want than nothing at all. But this will require work to the market and trade gameplay too, so I can be patient.

Time Controls : the controls to speed up , pause, slowdown and otherwise manage time are a little sketchy, the overland, and tactical versions are different sets of controls making it unintuitive. I would also like to see the time toggle working properly, there is no indication of what time speed im at now, and that is confusing. 

Camera anchor shortcuts, I would like a more fluent way to lock the camera around on the battlefield, double clicking a unit icon, or using the hotkey twice for example, Im having a hard time setting a mouse scroll speed im happy with, and tend to fly off and find myself looking at the dirt. 

Tactical map setup phase, the minimap of the grid is pretty simple i would like a chance to get my bearings on locations of major landmarks or enemy armies before i have to worry about the engagement, discovery , or arrival timers. 

Reading the game index is a must. Some of the interactions between town, faction, trade and production are a little obscure until you figure that out.

Escaping to a menu screen doesnt pause the game... thats just annoying, sorry. 

Some of the menus and sub menus have no self contained commands, for example when upgrading a town facility, you cant close that window on its own. 

The Really Good:  So far the game has a wonderfully diverse set of starting game options, in my opinion this is the single biggest downfall of 90% of the grand stratagy games out there, the way i want to play is rarely represented completely and sometimes not at all, But VoC has covered all the bases as far as Im concerned, very little needs to happen here. 

Tactical AI: The Soldiers on the battle field , besides some visual/animation work that is needed, behave as I have come to expect in all the best ways.

Combat unit balance: Kerry has a terrific handle on this, though im sure more units and types will appear in the future, Im sure they will be amazingly fair, 5 ragtag peasants with sticks against an armored soldier with quality gear = 5 dead peasants and an angry soldier with some sticks...  as it should be. 

I have gone on too long now, and need to go play this game. It is a definite buy, I paid full price during the Autumn sale and im not even sad about it. 

I strongly encourage fans of total war, mount and blade, or grand stratagy with RPG elements to throw their support into this game. Its a homerun already, we just have to run the bases now. 

Thank you so much!

While there are still bugs aplenty and many of the game mechanics not fully implemented, I got an immediate sense of the game's spirit and the direction it was headed.

Like most people already know there is a clear resembleance to Mount & Blade.  However where it sets itself apart is in its strong focus on economy and trade, larger variety of settlement types (Forts, Farms, Quarrys, Gold Mines, Ranches, Lumber Mills etc.), and the ability to customize and upgrade those you own in a much more meaningful way.  

The other comparison often made is to Total War, though I did not see this quite as much.  When engaging an enemy in combat, you are able to place your troops and defenses (if in a fort battle) and move the camera around much like in Total War, but thats where the similarities end in my opinion.  For me, the combat felt more like a ""throw everything at the enemy and hope for the best"" kind of deal.  Controlling troops, and sorting out troop types once combat begins is quite difficult, as the two armies tend to turn into a swirling mosh pit of death.  This of course can be chalked up to the phase of development the game is in.

Dadurch kann es schnell passieren, das wenn man zuviele Schlachten verliert, oder aber auch verlustreich gewinnt, der Nachschub ausgehen kann und das eigene mühsam aufgebaute Königreich kriegsmüde wird.

Dieses Projekt ist meines Wissens ein Ein-Mann Projekt und dieser Kerl, haut wöchentlich Updates und Verbesserungen für dieses Spiel heraus. 
Dafür mein Respekt an den Entwickler. 

Was mich derzeitig am meisten stört ist nur, das es noch in dieser Alpha relativ wenige Städte und Points of Interest gibt und die Kampagnenkarte noch relativ leblos auf mich wirkt. Konnte in relativ kurzer Zeit die gesamte Kampagnenkarte erobern. Was jedoch sehr viel Spaß machte ;) 
Bevor ich dieses aber ein zweites mal anstelle, warte ich noch auf ein Update für die Kampagnenkarte ab. In der Hoffnung das der Entwickler noch eines heraus bringt ;) ich hoffe es sehr! :)

Für mich hat es sich zumindest schon gelohnt!

With that being said, the game is not in the best of shape.  It  has it's bugs, some more irrating than others.  While there is no argueing that, I do have to point out in the short period the game has been released, there have been many updates that significantly increase the playability of this game and the overall enjoyment.  I've seen some of the other reviews and don't feel it does this game justice.  Is the game rough at the edges? Yes.  Are they being polished? Absolutely and the response of the developer is quite amazing.  In the couple of months the game has been out, the content has significantly increased, and the quality of the game has increased as well.  This is not the most coherient of reviews, but I do feel like this is a good game and is going in a great direction.  I would and do recommend this to my friends, and do to you as well.

******UPDATE**********
So, I took a break from this to give it time to update and mature.  Let it work out the bugs. And holy shit has it been updated.  So let me give you a little update to when I first played.  There wasn't much to do except for quest and do a little bit of fighting, god forbid you die and then restarting is impossible, not to mention, start choices were limited.  However, compared to now, you have more options than i remember (about 8 or so i think).  One of which includes you starting off with a town called graywatch.  And of course, not playing for awhile, i jumped onto that one, because getting and maintaining a town was (still is) quite a feat.  While at first, i thought it was a bit broken to start off with a city right off the bat, i soon almost regretted it.  I was pretty worried about my food supply (not something you have to worry about if you start off by yourself).  Not to mention, i was always broke, barely able to afford my troop upkeep while trying to upgrade my city.  I never felt overwhelmed, but a mistake could've easily costed me dearly.  

Overall, from when i purchased this game, back in may of 2017, it has significantly improved.  Save/load times are much much MUCH better.  The AI aren't so special anymore, except for the archers, who now only occassionly put an arrow into a friendly (most likely another archer of all things).  The number of troops has greatly expanded, and the balance of the game has also changed, and it does feel pretty well balanced.  Speaking of troops, the games performance has 10 fold performed better.  Siege battles have improved (wooden walls < stone walls and ect) and the AI's compentence to defend the area.  They do have a tendency to spam ballistas and catapults but they actually use them now so thats good. 

For those who worry about purchasing a early access and getting left in the dirt without any meaniful updates, don't worry, this game won't do that.  While it still needs to work to be a finished game, it would be hard to recogonize the game if  you purchased it when I did.  

My conclusion,

If you can't handle some little annoying bugs (Like prisoners rarely being added into your queue of prisoners) then you shouldn't buy this game.  Little things that happen in this game.  If the little things don't bug you and you love mount and blade, you should love this game as well.  Would i say purchase this at it's full price (I think $19.99 or $14.99)? Yes, I would.  The game has greatly improved and is very playable now.


*****UPDATE ON V1.0*****

It has come a long way from where it first started.  Promises made were promises kept.  The game has greatly improved.  I don't play as much as I would like to, but i can whole heartly recommended the game.  It is no longer ""little bugs that bother you"", its more of, is this game your style of game? If so, then i most definitely recommended it.

I've seen people comparing it to total war, and while it may initially seem similar in ways I feel that this is an unfair comparison, apples to oranges if you will. The important thing that sets this game apart is that you create YOUR faction, the way you want it to be. As a fiction writer, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to create factions with specific uniforms and a leader from my stories. That being said, I do wish that the faction customization was more expansive, and I wish that there was a way to rename cities. Other than that, this is a perma-death game, which has its pros and cons. I love the thrill of risking my leader's life at times, yet when I am in over my head and he gets killed I am not always prepared to deal with that. For some reason, some aspects of this game remind me of Kenshi, another game on Steam that I love. This is a major compliment because Kenshi is one of very few games that has such great potential and appeal while in early access. Veil of Crows has a ways to go, but I am interested in seeing how things turn out. I think we all would like a rework of the overworld map, among other things. As of right now I would give the game a 7.5/10, docking a few points for the few issues that irk me. The rating would be lower if this were a less original idea, but I like the concept and I think it can go far. I also appreciate that the devs update the game VERY frequently, which is something to be respected. Things I'd like to see added: diplomacy improvements, more faction aesthetic customization, city/town customization (other than upgrades/buildings), the allowance of group creation in battle (prefered over the current numeric organization system, but that may just be something I need to get more acquainted with), and greater hero customization among other things. While total war and civ games excel at history, this game caters more to those wishing to create their own faction. I like starting out in sandbox mode, as I can start with an abundance of resources and soldiers. Even still, it is rather difficult to win battles and get by. I will update my review as I go, and I look forward to seeing if the devs manage to unlock the true potential hidden in this gem of a game.

Das Spiel ist derzeit noch im Early Access. Das heißt, es kann jederzeit zu Fehlern kommen, es können sich Inhalte oder Grafiken ändern und das Spiel ist noch nicht fertig.
Wer das nicht bedenkt und beachtet, sowie ein Problem damit hat, sollte die Finger vom Spiel lassen.

Doch obwohl Veil of Crows noch im Early Access ist und von nur einer einzigen Person entwickelt wird, haben wir eine bereits gut spielbare und auch durchaus fordernde Kampagne sowie einen netten Gefechtsmodus.
Aber im Moment ist es noch zu früh für genauere Aussagen deswegen gehe ich erstmal auf das Spiel selber ein.

Jeder der Mount and Blade kennt, dürfte sich mit dem Spiel schnell zurechtfinden, zumindest was die Kampagne angeht.
Der Schlachtmodus erinner ein bisschen an Stronghold nur ohne Basebau, aber es wird mehr Wert auf Realismus gelegt.
Die Steuerung funktioniert nach kurzer Eingewöhnung ziemlich gut und das Tutorial erklärt alle wichtigen Mechaniken in knapp 10 Minuten.

Vom Schlachtmodus abgesehen ist das größte Feature sicherlich die Kampagne. Es gibt mehrere Fraktionen die sich um die Vorherrschaft prügeln. Da man seine wachsenden Städte auch immer versorgen muss um diese upzugraden, muss man stets dafür sorgen, dass die Dörfer welche die Rohstoffe bereitstellen nicht von Barbaren oder Feinden geplündert werden, sollte das doch mal vorkommen und wir haben Einheiten in den jeweiligen Dörfern stationiert switcht das Spiel in den Schlachtmodus und wir können unsere Einheiten selber Befehligen.

Die Kampagne/Sandbox bietet viel Freiraum zum testen und probieren und bietet bereits einigen Tiefgang, aber erwartet keine Weltbewegenden Soundeffekte, da muss noch etwas mehr kommen.

Derzeit funktionierte das Spiel in knapp 4 Stunden ohne Abstürze oder große Fehler, kleinere Bugs wahren da, aber wie gesagt, Early Access.

Für alle die gerne etwas mehr vom Spiel sehen möchten empfehle ich einfach meine neue Videoreihe für alle anderen gibt es eine überarbeitete Review wenn das Spiel released wird.

He rushed this project out the door far too fast, he got it to a point where he thought it was good and jumped the gun, landing it right out of early access and saying ""This is the full game, this was my vision, this is my completed dream!"", and it's by no means bad but... it definetly doesn't feel like a full game.

He slapped this onto the store and called it good, when it's obvious most of this is store-bought assets. From the models to the textures to the very animations, and the landscape and such is probably hand-made cheaply, it's not that hard with the detail of those buildings. it's very rudimentary in being 'Mount and Blade' but also 'Total War' feeling, and yet very clumsy and off-handed, with sometimes tactics feeling like a bit more on luck side. it's extremely unpolished and missing many features, and needs almost a complete revamp, so I changed my review from a positive, to a negative. Sorry man, but if you're gonna leave this behind, take my advice and use VERY LITTLE store-assets for the next game. make the animations, make the models, make it look good, but more importantly, make it PLAY good!

========================================================

對於渴求歐洲中世紀(不含魔法)戰略遊戲包含領地建設和健全軍事活動的玩家來說
除了Total War (中世紀 2 年代久遠) 以及 十字軍之王 II (這款偏重政治 軍事活動也只是政治的一部份)
Veil of Crows 是近年少有的選擇

水管上被英語玩家比喻為戰略版的Mount & Blade 倒是挺貼切的
大地圖移動方式完全一樣
也是英雄帶隊，在村莊徵兵，需要付軍費維持軍隊
不同的是士兵沒法累積經驗直接轉職，得靠訓練設施跟城堡擴張才能徵用較高級的單位

村莊(領地)不是單純圈起來躲在裡面就可以了
村莊圍牆之內只有領主的宅子(初期的版城堡)、房子、倉庫糧倉、士兵的訓練場
農田、伐木場、礦場等通通都在村子外依賴馬車把物資運到領地
換言之堵截運送馬車便能斷糧斷物資，也是一種作戰方式
跟無MOD的M&B比，因為產糧、採集等設施有升級選項
能對村子做一些生產力上的改進也算是增加了可玩性

======================================
缺點:
-我也不知道生產設施能不能自己建 現在玩下來好像只能搶地圖上已經生成好的設施
 如果只能搶地圖上有的，各種設施也未免有點少。這樣對開局真的很不利
 畢竟連民兵也養不起的村子要跟其他集團搶設施根本玩命

-士兵操作沒有UI 只能叫他們移動和決定排隊方式
 弓箭手要不Team Kill 殺自己人殺得比敵人殺我們前排還起勁
 就是衝上前肉搏增加損耗，都不要的話只能盡量跑到地圖邊緣希望他們不要自己走回來

-AI 在攔截敵軍時有點爛
 如果說敵軍騎兵衝過來我們的步兵擋不住，可能是因為民兵跟騎兵戰力差距太大也是沒辦法的事。
 但他們民兵衝過來我們民兵擋過去，我方跑過頭，敵方直接穿過打後排弓兵，那就太慘了

======================================
優點:
-良好的攻城戰
 攻城是靠圍城－>建設攻城器－>進入戰場的形式進行
 攻城的戰場正如宣傳影片一樣做得很用心。
 把弓箭手和步兵指示到城牆箭塔等地佈防時不會遇到惱人的操作
 (例如有些弓兵站不上去被擠出來呀、明明有空間卻沒人走上去呀之類的)
 另外無論是攻城器逐步破壞城牆內的建築物，或是在房屋、塔樓裡的發生室內戰
 通通都是完整地在運行不會用敷衍的方式帶過

-良好的戰鬥細節
  雖然AI的攔截是悲劇的，但戰鬥表現卻不錯
  進入混戰後士兵不會呆呆的站著等攻擊""冷卻完畢""，能作出各種閃躲抵擋的動作
  也會移動位置做出纏鬥的動作，畢竟中世紀跟古典時代的方陣間戰鬥不太一樣
  這時期一些臨時拉夫的民兵非正規軍以及騎士之間的一對一精神諸如此類
  兩群人混雜在一起亂戰反而才是常見的狀況

  另外混戰期間也會因為距離改變立刻把離開攻擊範圍的目標轉換成眼前的敵人
  不會看到一堆步兵傻傻的追著一名騎兵跑馬拉松，結果背後人變少無辜大戰敗
  這也是值得一讚的地方

不過還是那句啦

La verdad no se ni por donde empezar, es que es la primera vez que critico un juego pero me siento estafado, ¡No hay por donde cogerlo! 

El juego empieza mal, la caracterización de tu personaje y de tu facción es practicamente nula y muy rancia, tanta que ni si quiera funciona correctamente el mezclador de colores, ni el cuadro de escritura, ni las flechas para cambiar de logo. 

Una vez empiezas la partida te encuentra en un mapa sin objetivo alguno y con muy pocas opciones, si consigues hacer un par de misiones (Que ahora detallare mas sobre ellas) y reclutar unos pocos granjeros date por contento y cuida de no perderlos por que no los recuperas.  El mapa esta lleno de pueblecitos de obtención de recursos que pertenece a facciones mas grandes y de muchisimos otros personajes que se mueven sin sentido aparente, se hace hasta confuso. Si te matan el juego guarda automaticamente despues de que hayas muerto y te borra el progreso conseguido.
La forma de conseguir dinero es absurda, todavia no he logrado entenderla, casi siempre que llegas a un pueblo y pides comerciar no te dejan, ni reclutar tampoco por supuesto. 

Las misiones son siempre de 3 tipos, assesinar aun objetivo, defender un pueblo y obtener recursos y no cambian nunca, solo el nivel de dificultad, a veces para una mision sin apenas recompensa te manda a la otra punta del mapa y cuando vuelves para cobrar la recompensa ya no te aprece la misión en cuestión, o la flechaque te guia paracumplirlas e indicauna dirección erroneay no llegas nunca. ES DESESPERANTE:

Finalmente, el combate, tengo que admitirque me gustan graficamente las unidades y algun combate e entretenido pero la mayoría de las veces no tiene ni pizca de sentido, es imposible clicar sobre las unidades enemigas, tus tropas hacen lo que les da la ganan y cuesta horrores organizarlas. 
La caballeria literamente PATINA, no hay cargas y cuando pega a un objetivo se pasa 10 metros e largo porque se resbala sobre el suelo...!
Mas de una vez al asaltar un campamento de baniddos, mis tropas aparecen en MITAD DEL CAMPAMENTO ENEMIGO y dichos enemigos son puntos invisibles que van aareciendo segun pasa el tiempo y se retiran a los 5 segundos.
A menos que personaliceis los combates las batallas que vais a librar van a ser de 5 vs 5 o de mayoria absoluta.

En fin, yo me lo pensaría dos veces antes de comprarlo, me arrepiento constantemente de haberinvertido dinero y tiempo en esto..

Úplne začiatkom uvediem, že medieval hry mám nesmierne rád. V podstate kultová hra Mount and Blade zasiala semienko a hier podobného typu nám v poslednom čase pribúda pomerne dosť. Vývojári zistili, že tento žáner je (ku podivu) veľmi žiadaný a dá sa to aj bez kúziel, nadržaných chlpatých amazoniek a prerostnutých storidne pôsobiacich orkov. Hier s alternatívnou históriou, respektíve s alternatívnym ""stredovekom"" pomaly ale iste pribúda a to, či už z profesionálnych vývojárskych štúdií, alebo malých nadšeneckých ""garážoviek"". 

Jednou takou hrou z malej ""garážovky"" je aj hra Veil of Crows. Autor sa priveľmi netají tým, že hra je mixom Mount and Blade a sérií Total War. Hra vyšla v podstate nedávno v predbežnom prístupe a naozaj treba povedať, že autor hru patchuje pravidelne na dennej báze, čo si zaslúži jednu veľkú pochvalu.

Začínate tým, že si vyberiete či chcete hrať kampaň alebo sandbox. Ja som si zvolil pieskovisko. Následne štandardne tvoríte postavu, kde si zvolíte pohlavie, vzhľad, farbu a erb rodu. Nečakajte detailné ""piplanie"" sa tvorbou postavy. Tvorba postavy na mňa pôsobila systémom ""A to je všetko?""...a po pravde nemyslím si, že po tejto stránke niekedy bude kontent obohatený. Takže tvorba postavy je naozaj veľmi chudobná. Následne si zvolíte základné nastavenie sandboxu a to aké mesto chcete na začiatku vlastniť. Či chcete vlastniť aj dediny (dediny sú tu chápané ako farma, lesné hospodárstvo, ranč, baňa so železom a zlatom) a prípadne aj nejakú tú vojenskú silu. Ja som si zvolil len mestečko. 

Herná mapa je podobná skutočne hre Mount and Blade, hory, more, lesy, mestá dediny, bandity, dezertéry, sily ďalších oponentov, karavany atď. atď... Princípy hry pochopíte veľmi rýchlo, v hre naozaj nie je žiaden prevratný prvok nad ktorým by ste hodiny a hodiny pátrali a dúmali nad nesmrtelnosťou Európskej únie. Začnete tým, že si k svojmu vladarovi pričleníte nejakú tu partičku po zuby ozbrojených sedliakov. Zájdete do prvej dediny, kde si kúpite za pár zlaťákov pár dokonalých hrdlorezov s vidlami v rukách. Zároveň v dedine sa popýtate po robote, kde dostanete za úlohu ""zavraždiť nejakú postavu"", ""obrániť dedinu pred banditmi"", ""doniesť suroviny"", ""doniesť väzňov"" a pod. S tým, že jednotlivé úlohy sú rozdelené na ľahké a stredné. Obtiažnosť sa líši len v počtoch, napr. na ľahkú úroveň máte vyčistiť tlupu o počte 5 mužov, na stretnú je to 25 mužov. Úloh je pomerne málo a po pravde sú nudné a veľmi stereotypné. 

Prvý boj! Zo začiatku budete bojovať len proti malým útvarom tak do počtu 50 mužov na oboch stranách. Neskôr sa vaše bitvy rozrastú až do počtu stoviek mužov, žien a koní... Samozrejme nejedná sa o stronghold, takže nečakajte, že na mape budete mať naraz 2 000 mužov, myslím, že by vaše CPU riadne zaplakalo. Ja som síce problémy s FPS nemal, ale pár krát som kde-tu čítal, že sa ľudia sťažovali na zlú optimalizáciu. Ja som hral plynule aj na väčších bojiskách na zostave Intel i7-7700K (bez OC, len na základnom takte 4,2GHz), 16GB RAM DDR4 2300Mhz a GTX 1070 (8GB,256Bit). No, ale teraz sa podme presunúť k samotným bojom...zabudnite na total war, zabudnite na warband! Boje sú skotočne na zaplakanie. Nie je to o taktike, nie je to o dobrom naplánovaní, nie je to o využívaní terénu, počasia a pod. Je to o počte, ala sovietsky systém vedenia vojny ""Náááás mnogo tavarišč!"". Vyhráva jednoducho ten, kto má väčšieho...teda väčšiu armádu. Takže boje ma bavili veľmi malú chvíľku. Obliehanie a bránenie hradu nekomentujem nakoľko je to jeden veľký bug. Napr. v budovách kde sa rodia posily sa často jednotky zaseknú a ste v háji a bitva sa nedá dohrať nakoľko sa súdruh Žižka z Trocnova zasekol s koňom v stajni! Taktiež v hre je aj veľmi málo máp, ktoré sa donekonečna opakujú. Animácie boja vyzerajú skôr ako tanec plodnosti spomínaných amazoniek než ako animácie boja. Takže čo sa týka tejto stránky hry, tak tu ma sklamala na plnej čiare a kúsok pod čiarou. 

Keď už budete mať čo tu nabojované, pár zlaťákov v kapse a nejakú skupinu anonymných alkoholikov vo vašej tlupe, tak začnete túžiť po sláve, moci, a zapísanie svojej osoby do učebníc dejepisu. V zásade máte dve možnosti ako rozšíriť svoje impérium a to: vojenskou cestou (niekoho naseriete) alebo tým, že si dedinu kúpite (niekoho naseriete). Já som si zvolil voľbu č. 2 - dedinky som si kupoval od môjho pseudospojenca. Jednoducho stále som plnil questy pre nejaké královstvo, čím som si zabezpečil priazeň a potom som si kúpil nejakú dedinku, priazeň mi klesla, potom opäť som splnil pár questov, priazeň stúpla, potom som si zabojoval, potom som sa išiel vykakať...priazeň stúpla, potom som opäť kúpil dedinu priazeň klesla, opäť som splnil questy, priazeň stúpla, potom som si trošku zabojoval, a dokola stále to isté až som sa po 42 h. takmer unudil k smrti. 

Hra má určite potenciál, na druhej strane každá myšlienka má potenciál otázka je akým smerom sa uberie a či nebude nad sily tvorcu samotnej myšlienky? Budem hru sledovať, hlavne sledovať obsah a dopĺňanie nového kontentu do hry - zatiaľ dávam uninstall. V prípade ak sa vyskytne patch ktorý pridá na tony a tony nového obsahu, tak sa k hre rád vrátim. Pathe typu fixovanie chýb akože samozrejme je to super, ale podľa mňa to nie je to za čo spotrebiteľ vyhadzuje peniaze. Povedzme si úprimne, že 40 hodín strávených v hre a výhlasenie o tom, že hra je ""zlá"" by bolo trochu pokrytecké. Hra ""zlá"" nie je, na druhej strane treba ale povedať, že od dobrej má taktiež na míle ďaleko. Úprimne, otvorene ak by túto hru spravilo nejaké veľké štúdio, tak by som hre dal o jeden bod menej a neodporúčil ju. Opäť sa ale jedná o ""amatérsky"" počin a práve z undergroundu sa zrodili tie najväčšie hviezdy - ako napríklad Justin Bieber! :D Ak ste fanúšikom koníkov, panákov v zbroji, hradov a zámkov, máte rádi princezné a Justina Biebra, tak hru skúste prečo nie?! Bannerlord je zatiaľ v nedohľadne, tak treba nejako zabiť čas! 

Ale nie, teraz vážne! Je potrebné hru po hrateľnej stránke doladiť, hra je veľmi jednoduchá, v hre nie je žiadna diplomacia, v podstate za pár hodín bude vaša ekonomika neporaziteľná a môžete bez problémov viesť takmer beztrestne vojny a keď vám to nebude vyhovovať, tak môžete za pár zlatých uzavrieť mier. Hra skutočne nie je vyvážená a pre ""ostrielaných"" aj menej ostrielaných hráčov tohto žánru sa bude zdať veľmi primitívna až nudná. Taktiež bodlo by keby sa pridali ďalšie mapy bojov, a na kompletku prerobil bojový systém, lebo vyhrať bitvu tak, že zoberiem celú armádu zgrupím ju na kopci a potom jedným ťahom roznesiem protivníka v kopytách je rovnako naivné ako predstava, že v snehovej kalamite nebudú prostriedky MHD v Bratislave meškať. Ďalej v hre chýbajú štatistiky, prehľady, reguľovateľný obchod. Keď sa tieto základné veci do hry doplnia hru rád skusím opäť. Toď zatím vsio...


Jóóóó a takmer som zabudol, ešte si môžete vaše mesto, mestá vylepšovať a to ako dediny (urýchlenie výrobného procesu) až po mestá (rozširovanie skladov, odomykanie nových jednotiek), ale opäť nič prevratné čo by vás prebudilo z bdelej kómy.

In the first week of a game being on steam, I never seen such a responsive and active developer, you truly do get the feel he is passionate about this project and feels a responsibility to his new customers. 

If you read the rest of this review and like what you hear, PLEASE CONSIDER SUPPORING THIS DEVELOPER AND GAME. Veil of Crows is modestly priced, and already has more fun and replayability than many rts games.

Fans of Total War, Mount & Blade, and even Stronghold will appreciate the fusion of some of the best features of all games. Focusing on adding more freedom (on the battlefield and world map), and the sense that you are actually affecting and changing the world as you grow your small faction is truly what makes Veil of Crows stand out.

There is still far to go, but there is so much potential here for the developer to take the features and concepts to the next level and the next. I can't recommend it to casual RTS fans in its current state, again it is very rough, but I personally love it, and all the potential it has.

To survive early access hell, the game needs its 2 core concepts to be expanded:
1. More freedom given to the player to do whatever the heck they want to, and
2. A deeper dynamic world of competing and cooperating factions.
(of course bug fixes, UI, balances and optimizations go without saying.)",1494094920,1494095469,True,14,0,0.64006572961807251,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Luego las batallas, despues de la pantalla de carga, te encuentras en un mapa mas parecido al de las batallas de Total War, todo mas cercano y mas detallado. Con la diferencia de que no son escuadrones, es soldado a soldado.
Batallas en campo abierto o excelentes asedios con maquinaria de asedio; catapultas, balistas, escaleras... Tambien utensilios de defensa de asedio como troncos, pinchos anti-caballeria o hogueras para las flechas de los arqueros.

For those of you, however, that are currently looking for an enjoyable gameplay experience in which to spend time, I can't put my backing behind this in its current stage. While the screenshots on the store page do look nice, the current combat setup, recuitment method, and general feel of the gameplay is very cold and distant. It doesn't grip or motivate you, and while you've got a vested (gold) interest in seeing your troops victorious in battle, that isn't currently something that you can truly affect.

I will say that I really *really* like their world developemnt over time. I'd like to eventually see some sort of succession system put into the game (ala Sunless Sea's prodigy system) in an attempt to create longer lasting lines of nobility (or ignobility!).

Идея, которая здесь подана была взята со многих игры, начиная Total War до Mount and Blade. В связи с этим мне пригляделась.  
Так что отмечу плюсы и минусы.
Минусы:
-Плохая оптимизация, при не самой свежей графике( i5, gtx960, порой фризы и просидает до 15 фпс).
-Старое меню, то бишь лоад скрин, экран меню, сами панели управления довольна таки устарели по своему стилю, лет эдак на 10, а некоторые панели либо слишком большие, либо плохо обрезаны.
-Слабая анимация. Не только на большой карте, но и на поле сражения.
-Мало детализации, особенно касается персонажа, флага и т.д.
-Неудобное управление, чтобы,например, напасть напротивника надо вначале выделить войска, потом ctrl(обвести противника) и потом только атаковать,
Это основные минусы, которые я для себя выделил. Надеюсь, это когда-нибудь поправят.
Плюсы
+Игра достаточно амбициозна, если её довести до ума.
+Много хороших задумок и механик.
+Неплохо проработаное поведение НПС в драке и осадах
+Дружелюбная графика в боях, но анимация и графическое изображение ГГ,к примеру, ужасно.
+Довольно таки хорошая разрушаемость.

I would focus on improving the FTUE, having players frustrated and losing interest within the first few moments means they will not spend the time to see the glorious parts of the game that come later down the line.

****************************
Some would even call this game unplayable as it stands now. 
It's a rough gem, but it is just that; a gem. 

Sure it's really Total war, with Warband, but that's not a bad thing. 
It adds its own flavours. 

The only fear I have with this game, is that it will get harsh feedback early on by people damning it and ejecting with their steam refund. Leaving poor user reviews, to the point where fewer customers try it out, and the developer lose heart.

So not played long but that is for a reason. Now i love strategy games even the bad ones and the unpopular ones. This is neither. The graphics are awesome the look is authentic the gameplay is fun the game is an on paper winner. So why a thumbs down ? Its complicated. Im not talking difficult marriage complicated. Oh no. Its worse. Im talking hold left alt and left click whilst holding right control tapping left control, doing a raindance and boxing over an enemy complicated. Its good but unnecessarily complicated. Why not select your unit, attatch them to catapult then right click on enemy wall to bombard ? Now i admit. It is mildly hilarious to watch 8 engineers run across a highly detailed field where men take arrows to the face (no joke) only to reach a wall and stand there going 'oh s@&t' BUT it sort of ruined my strategy. Now as i said i played all strategy games and many games with less potential than this have covered the same ground with awful graphics, awful pathfinding and awful AI yet still been fun because it was ..................... well simple. Now im not asking for an easy game. Im asking for an easy UI. This game has everything but. It challenged me, it made me think, it made me worry, it made me draw tiny plans on napkins !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But not for the reason youd expect. I had to pre-plan every key stroke, every box i drew every single right mouse click. Because everyone of those should have had an 'ALT' or 'CTRL' in there somewhere. The game has mountains of promise. And it truly is not a bad game. It is however a bad UI. When games such as Total War solved this issue eons ago by using a 'drop equipment' button it is a terrible shame that a game with this much promise should struggle on this point. By all means try it. Enjoy it as i did. But remember it is not your keyboard or monitors fault when you forget to press 3 keys whilst drawing a box over both friendly and enemy units pressing left and right mouse button and selling your soul to the eternal evil that is 'how do i win that level'

Enjoy :)

Le meilleur moyen de définir Veil of Crows est d'imaginer une fusion entre Mount and Blade et Total war. L'aspect Mount and Blade est très présent, surtout au niveau de la gestion de la carte (avec les différentes unités qui se déplacent et leur faction d'origine affiché au-dessus, les villages et caravanes...) avec (comme défaut pour certains, ou comme avantage pour les excités de l'imprévu et exploration), le fait qu'il y a un permanent brouillard de guerre, On aura donc toujours ce petit frisson de l'inconnu : est-ce-que, plus loin, je vais enfin tomber sur une ville et pouvoir soulever des petites daronnes et dépenser mon précieux argent, ou alors, tomber sur une armée de bandits qui vont me la mettre bien profonde ? On retrouvera aussi M&B dans sa mecanique de jeu, le fait de devoir aller chercher les paysans dans des villages pour se construire petit à petit une certaine armée, les entrainer,gagner de plus en plus de points de compétences pour son propre personnage, aller mendier du travail chez les uns et les autres, faire du commerce ( et oui, pour ceux qui adorent compter leur précieux argent en faisant du profit, le commerce est plus développé qu'un M&B donc assez présent) et bien evidemment, posséder son propre village ! Gestion assez poussée, sans non plus être trop chiant à gérer : possibilité de gérer le seuil des impots de tes paysans, de gérer leurs ressources et nourritures avec le fait de ne pas être non plus un nazi esclavagiste qui les fait travailler tout le temps sous peine de les voir se barrer. On pourra également entrainer des unités qui pourront défendre vos villages, patrouiller, et même nous aider à agrandir notre territoire. Coté gameplay, on est sur du Total war en beaucoup moins developpé : pas vraiment d'ordres spéciaux à donner à vos unités (en gros, aller par à cet endroit, dire à l'infantrie de taper sur les villains, aux archers de tirer, à la cavalerie de charger, bref, les ordres de bases) et deplacer les unités pour qu'ils adoptent la formation que vous voudrez. Le plus interessant surtout sont dans les batailles de sièges, ou y pas mal de petites mecaniques sympas : on pourra notamment apprécier le fait que vos unités tombent une par une sous une pluie de flèches afin de poser 2 échelles contre les remparts, les assaillants se faire déchirer la gueule par de l'eau bouillante balancée par les défenseurs ... Bref, la partie siège est assez complète et jouissive. Le jeu graphiquement est très correct, mais pas de quoi faire non plus bruler ton PC. Niveau musique, préparez-vous une petite playlist de musiques épiques pour les batailles, sinon vous aurez plus l'impression d'être chez papi mamie à regarder Louis La Brocante. Après, est-ce-que je recommande le jeu ? C'est difficile à dire : le jeu, par son concept est génial, pour ceux qui ont aimé Mount And Blade, Veil of Crows est vraiment inspiré par ce dernier : la diplomatie, le marchandage, avoir la patience d'entrainer ses villageois et de voir petit à petit son armée grandir, Veil of Crows essaie vraiment d'avoir les mêmes concepts sans pour autant n'être qu'une simple copie de M&B. Pour les fans de stratégie et des Total War, niveau ordres, remettez votre  pantalon, y a pas de quoi vraiment s'exciter : le jeu est assez basique, pas beaucoup d'ordres ou de stratégies possibles dans les simples batailles, on se consolera un peu pendant les sièges. En revanche, pour avoir des batailles du feu de dieu, c'est génial. Après, est-ce-que le jeu vaut le coup ? Oui. Est-ce-que vous devriez l'acheter et y jouer tout de suite ? Non, pas forcément. Même si le jeu a un gros potentiel et a un concept génial, il souffre de beaucoup de bugs ( des ennemis qui rester contre un arbre  plutôt que de participer au massacre, jeu pouvant crashé lors de temps de chargement très longs etc la liste est longue poto), les controles sont assez crispants par moment, la difficulté des quêtes est mal gérée (sérieusement le jeu, ca aurait été plus facile de me dire d'aller me faire foutre que de me donner comme première quête de me battre contre une armée de 120 bandits)... bref, le jeu est vraiment en pré-alpha. Après, faut retenir quand même qu'il n'y a qu'un seul développeur derrère ce jeu, et qu'il est vraiment très à l'écoute de la communaute. Bref, le jeu n'est sorti que depuis le 28 avril mais de nombreux (petits et gros) bugs ont déjà été réparés donc je vous conseille d'attendre 3,4 semaines avant de l'acheter avant de vous faire une opinion fixe.

[*] Buying into a game in EA should be for one of two reasons: to help kickstart, regardless of current state. Or because the current state of the game offers the desired gameplay.
[/list]

Update as of 23-September-18:

The game has improved drastically, and the state of the game is in a much better place than it was a year ago. I'm still giving this game a 'no', but in a much more tentative manner.

So some of the good points about the game:
[list]
[*] The game offers Mount & Blade style combat with a stratergy twist.
[*] Your saves/worlds can persist (factions and more) even beyond death of your character.
[*] The game is highly replayable, due to faction randomisation and will be more so with the unit randomisation that is coming.
[*] Micromanagement heavy, for those that enjoy such mechanics.
[/list]

So some of the good points about the development:
[list]
[*] Updated on a very regular basis, often with a good heap of content.
[*] The developer plays a very active role in the community, and listens to the voices of their customers.
[*] Lots of bugs, issues and balance issues have been resolved over the last year.
[*] The game is reaching a final state, which means refinement of what we've got should hopefully follow over time.
[/list]

Some of the bad points:
[list]
[*] Animations absolutely suck, meaning combat is slow and clunky.
[*] The world map leaves a lot to want for. There are trees as big as cities on the map, so stylistically the world map is very ehhh. It is however functional, and additional map/s will be added in the future.
[*] UI isn't great either, and everything about the interfaces feels tech-demoey or 'indie', if that makes sense.

The gorey, yet simple graphics perfectly portray the medieval setting this game recreates. The fighting mechanics both in skirmishes and sieges are wonderful, although a bit clunky control-wise.

Cons/SUGGESTIONS: -Bigger HUD/UI, it's so hard to read anything rn.
-Not a big fan of not seing the entire map, or at least pressing M and having a bigger map that shows the places you've discovered
-The game needs to have a bit of a story at start so that it kicks the player in a certain direction. With the plethora of factions the game offers, it's confusing to pick a side as there aren't any lines drawn between them(all of this compared to mount and blade, as it stands at the pinnacle of this genre)
-A pause button during battles(maybe i havent seen it yet)
-The village/town options are also confusing, they should be clearly delimited to smth like 'Go to the marketplace//Search for volunteers to join your party//Talk to the village's elder)) but that's just me haha.

(I know I don't have enough time on this YET, to make a FULL opinion but...) [/h1]

Frist off, this game is awesome. It is literally a mix of ""Mount & Blade and Total War"". 

You start by chosing a character, name appearance, coat of arms, name of your clan and your profession. Then whatever starting position you chose you join the world map. I have only explored one starting profession/position, and that was called ""deserter"". In this case everyone on the map is your enemy, except for roaming deserters. You start with a small Army of around 25 Soldiers. Now you can attack others traveling around the world map, capture and occupy cities and villages, bribe bandits and deserts to join your ranks or just plainly raid and pillage the country side. The options are endless, and I really enjoyed the hour I played this game. 

The reason why I am saying its a mix of the two games mentioned above is, because the map and traveling, resource management and city upgrading is literally exactly like Mount & Blade. But when you get into battle, you are not actually controlling your Heroe/Character, you are not in Thrid Person fighting the battle, but it switches to a Total War/Age of Empires sort of strategy bird view. You can then control your Army, a la RTS, and fight out the battle. (which you can also auto resolve, hence the Total War mention). 

Of course this game has bugs, of course its clunky in a certain way, but it is fun and has TONS of potential. So for now this game gets a big thumbs up, until I play some more and explore some more.",1493555947,1493556079,True,1,0,0.501883625984191895,0,True,False,True,False,,,

- animations need to fixed,he already knows this and im sure he's working on it.
- fog tends to block your view a bit too much.
- I would like to scroll the map with a mouse not the direction keys.

Anyway Im looking forward to this mix of mount and blade total war vibe game. 
These game making guys need support, Cheers.

So this game get my recommendation, its unfished but what you expected?

Its a kind of Mount & Blade with TW feature's.

Als alter Stronghold-Fan liegt mir natürlich mehr an den Schlachten als an der Kampagne, aber auch diese werde ich sicherlich noch spielen. Mount&Blade, Total War Reihe - alle diese Spiele wurden bereits schon als Vergleich zu diesem Spiel angeführt. Somit sollte eigentlich klar sein was hier auf dem Programm steht. 

Ganz klar, es ist EARLY ACCESS! Es gibt noch viel zu tun und wir dürfen noch viele Änderungen erwarten. Allerdings ist der Entwickler wirklich für Verbesserungen zugänglich und setzt konsequent Community-Wünsche um. In den 2 Wochen vor Release hat er nahezu täglich Patches rausgebracht. Respekt!! 

Wer etwas für diese Art Games übrig hat, der sollte unbedingt mal reinschauen. Wer noch zögert sollte sich den Titel aber auf jeden Fall auf die Wunschliste setzen und ihn im Auge behalten. Freue mich schon auf die nächsten Verbesserungen die der Entwickler in das Spiel implementieren wird.

So.....jetzt muss ich wieder eine Burg stürmen!! 😁

So far i am loving this game, The gameplay is nice and easy to learn but has alot of depth.. The dev team seem quite interested in the community and responsive to questions and lots of updates..The game only releashed but ill update as i go,, But first impressions are great no crazy frames drop in massive battles yet and.. I look forward to spending many many hours in this game...Well worth the 15$ when compared to other titles in the genre.",1493372343,1493372343,True,32,0,0.644172430038452148,4,True,False,True,False,,,
