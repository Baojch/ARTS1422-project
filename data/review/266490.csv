Grab stat is insanely powerful at ALL times, while speed isn't that much of a deal due to the lag of Spirits running away, as well as the abundant use of speed-boosting sandwiches. Still, very fun.

From the perspective that this game is for young children: It's decent enough, I doubt a young child would complain much and I bet it would entertain them for a short while. Characters talk in a childish and cute and funny way, the animations are in a cute, cartoonish way.

The game is not voice acted which is a bummer.

Keep in mind you have to use keyboard and mouse as controller is buggy and not fully supported. Perhaps you can get it to work fully by using Steam Big Picture and creating your own config if possible, I did not try.

From any other perspective it's pretty bad.
The options menu is very bad and there's a bug with resolutions, for me it got fixed by playing in Fullscreen Window but this has not worked for many others. There are some solutions in the Discussions forum that might help you.

The main and only mechanic used throughout the entire game is that you jump on the back of enemies and do a very easy QTE to pick flowers from their backs. This becomes incredibly repetitive and boring.
It is incredibly shallow from start to finish. It might work as a toilet break-game on a phone, but not as a PC game.

For 2 hours of gameplay from a mobile-port it is priced too high

Controller is not supported beyond basic functionality of you being able to navigate the basic menus and move around and do QTE's.

Everything shows up as keyboard characters(like Press M to look at your map, for example) except for in the QTE's thankfully, there is no controller button map in the game, it just gives you a keyboard button map(no way to re-bind) and it's not possible to navigate to certain menus with a controller like the Journal and your sidebar hot keys(you get some items on a side bar).

The other game on Steam from this developer is an Early Access abandonware title from 2015.

Not recommended, there are plenty of other games within this same vein that are much better.

I did everything available to do in the game, got every outfit and accessory, and got all of the achievements (which requires 1.5 playthroughs in order to get all the skill stats) and didn't even log a total of 6 hours. 

That being said, Lili is visually exceptional. It's a whimsical game with incredible scenery that reminds me a bit of a blend of Studio Ghibli and Legend of Zelda vibes. I would never have assumed this game could be considered a mobile game. It's a lovely casual play game for a calm and relaxing break.

However, there are quite a few bugs with achievements (I got my 1000 flowers achievement when I had only picked 780ish, for some reason the 1000 vases achievement triggered the unlock of the flower achievement as well. The bird achievement also got stuck on my first playthrough at 179 and would not progress no matter what. Luckily I got it my second time around, however the tracker for it still wasn't functional, it just popped randomly.) There is also, in my opinion, great room for improvement in terms of where the plot could have gone. I would have loved to have more side quests, more dialogue, more information in general as to the background of Lili, Geos, the spirits, and the constructs. Much of it is just expected to be taken at face value, but I would have liked to know and understand more about the world I was exploring. Also, the ending in my opinion was very anti-climactic. The 'battle' with the mayor was much too simplistic and just sailing off into the sea with no epilogue or anything was a bummer. I'd have liked to get an idea of what the constructs decide to do with Geos, what becomes of the spirits (since we see one still there), and what happens to Lili. It also would have been neat to see Lili utilize the flowers she collects as more than just coin fodder. If she was going for a degree in botanical magic I feel like we could have used the flowers to craft our own items, maybe for side quests or even just potions for our own uses. 

I think this game is a lovely experience for a casual game, and I think a younger crowd would especially love it (granted there are a few mild adult jokes like a 'deflowering' joke but easily acceptable for a young teen or preteen to play) so I definitely recommend it, just expect this to be more of a brief atmospheric experience than a true story driven RPG.",1651461403,1651461403,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

~[i]C.S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia[/i][/h1]

Ah, the casual games... Say whatever you want, I always had a very special place in my heart for those. From [b]Br√∏derbund Software[/b]'s [b]Arthur[/b] games to [b]SiMS[/b] and [b]Animal Crossing[/b]. I just love all that. Even though such games aim mostly to people who don't usually play games with complicated mechanics and tons of challenge, I just... I dunno, [i]I need[/i] them in my life. With all that bull that happens in the world around us, it's great to have something cute to relax. Something with no challenge at all, something to make you feel like a little kid again. That's why I loved [b]Nintendo[/b]'s [b]Wii[/b] and [b]DS[/b] so much. Those were like paradise for people who enjoyed such stuff. Unfortunately, nowadays it's hard to find a good casual game. Just because modern market treat casual players as fools and is trying to milk the heck out of them. And it works. Unfortunately. I mean, just look at what's going on. Nowadays, ‚Äúcasual game‚Äù usually means ‚Äú[b]f2p[/b] disaster‚Äù and even [b]Nintendo[/b]'s platform, which was meant to be a home of family-friendly entertainment, can't offer anything special. And that's exactly why I'm always glad to find something like this game here.

It's not like [b]Lili: Child of Geos[/b] is something special. It originated on [b]iPhone[/b] (was called simply ‚Äú[b]Lili[/b]‚Äù back then), it has only four maps / locations, it can be finished without much troubles in only a couple of hours and so on. So... what's with the thumb up? Well, first of all, this game looks surprisingly good. [b]PC[/b] version has a nasty resolution glitch, which can prevent you from changing the resolution through options menu and this game also hates [b]AMD[/b] video cards, but honestly, for [b]2012[/b] game from [b]iPhone[/b], it looks absolutely beautiful. Even today, it's a very charming experience. Especially since it's also very colorful and comes with surprisingly great character design. No, seriously, I didn't expect such a nice job. I mean, you know how it is. When it's about casual games, especially those for mobiles, we rarely get proper design. Most of the time, it's either copy / pasted design from popular [b]AAA[/b] games or some [b]Adobe Flash[/b]-like nonsense. While here? Here, it's something that makes you think of [b]Henry Selick[/b]'s [b]Coraline[/b]. Like I said, very impressive.

The best thing about this game, though, is that it's a casual game done right. If you have little kids? Those won't have any problems playing it. It's a very easy game (especially on low difficulty settings), and yet, it has pretty much everything to be called a real deal. You'll explore, you'll trade, you'll level up and you'll fight enemies. All easy for kids to understand. Talking about enemies, by the way. Another thing about [b]Lili: Child of Geos[/b] is that it's a very peaceful game. No violence here. Like... at all. And even though technically, you'll fight enemies, you'll do that by picking the flowers from their heads. Long story short ‚Äì you catch the evil spirit (in order to make the process a little bit easier, you'll need to level up speed and stealth, which will make you run faster and harder for spirits to notice), you jump on its back and you pick up flowers by participating in [b]QTE[/b]. You know the drill. Just press the right buttons to pick up corresponding flowers as fast as possible (third, and final, stat called ‚Äúgrip‚Äù will help you stay on enemy's back longer), and avoid spikes. On [b]iPhone[/b] and [b]iPad[/b] we were supposed to use touchscreen, which used to make things to feel more realistic (hello, [b]Nintendo DS[/b], miss you a lot, old buddy!), and yet, [b]Quick Time Events[/b] work pretty well too and are actually more comfortable. What's fun about battles in this game is that... theys surprisingly addicting. You know? I already said that this game is very kids-friendly, but even as an adult, it's hard not to feel addicted. That's exactly why this game will let you continue playing even after you'll be done with the main thing. Hunting down evil spirits? It's just way too addicting.

You can also make money by picking up flowers around you. Which is not nearly as fun as fighting spirits, but first ‚Äì you'll make enough money from spirits anyway, and second ‚Äì it's a very cute addition, which aims mostly to add the atmosphere and prevent you from feeling bored when you'll run from [b]A[/b] to [b]B[/b]. There's a story too, of course. Way too generic, but still, it's there and, aside from the main storyline, there'll also be optional objectives. You'll need to take pictures in certain spots, you'll need to plant trees and so on. Very cute and heartwarming stuff, which the entire family will be able to enjoy. Talking about families, while kids will totally enjoy bright colors, cute characters and heartwarming gameplay, parents would enjoy the nods to the old video games. [b]Zero Wing[/b], [b]The Oregon Trail[/b], [b]Super Mario Bros.[/b], etc. All of those got funny nods here. Heck, we'll even get ourselves [b]Link[/b]'s hat and [b]Navi[/b] ‚Äúpet‚Äù from [b]The Legend of Zelda[/b] series! How cool is that?! Sure, it's nothing special, but... you know. Fun stuff.

Talking 'bout hats and pets, by the way. [b]Lili: Child of Geos[/b] is one of those games that makes you want to get [b]100%[/b] completion. There isn't [i]that[/i] much stuff in here, and yet, collecting money to unlock new clothes (hello, [b]Barbie[/b] games!) and new hats? It's just... very addicting... somehow. There'll be important stuff too. Which means that not all purchases will be about cosmetics. But that's actually a bad thing. How? Well, see, one of the worst things about this game is its balance. Or lack of it. See, in [b]Lili: Child of Geos[/b] you can just grind for win. Collect enough money and you'll get yourself a key that will unlock all the doors that lead to treasures. All the doors in the entire game. Also, while you won't be able to level up right away, grinding for potions will compensate for lack of stats, so... yeah. Like I said, grinding is the answer to everything here. And it sucks. It's not like it ruins the entire thing, though. I mean, [b]Lili: Child of Geos[/b] is far from being a hardcore experience. And I don't... think that complaining too much about balance in kids-friendly game that can be finished in only two hours is a good idea. I mean, when you play [b]Corel Wild Board Games[/b], you don't complain about [b]AI[/b] not being as good as in [b]Fritz Chess[/b]. It's a different kind of fun with different purposes. It's all about cute characters, charming animations and heartwarming atmosphere. So, honestly, who cares? The game does its job.

And when it's about doing its job? [b]Lili: Child of Geos[/b] is absolutely brilliant. You run around, you collect flowers, you help funny-looking citizens of [b]Geos[/b] and you fight enemies in a very cute non-violence way. Bright colors, nice graphics and cute character design included. As a person who played a lot of such games (like, [i]a lot[/i] of them), I must say, I'm impressed. In other words, don't expect anything big and complicated here, but if you're looking for a family-friendly game like [b]The Dog Island[/b], [b]Falling Stars[/b] and [b]The Island of Dr. Frankenstein[/b]? That's it. This right here is exactly what you're looking for. A nicely made cute and charming game with easy gameplay and heartwarming aftertaste. Something you play with kids, or when you need a simple game to feel better during the cold winter nights. Just make sure to get some hot chocolate and you're ready to go.

Lili child of Geos is a very simplistic yet beautiful game which could be relaxing.

It's a third person game where you play as a girl in an open world environment while doing various tasks. It's isn't hard, more on a relaxing side. The store page says it's similar to Zelda, tagged as rpg but I don't think it qualifies as anything like that.

You basically have a map of a city and just run around doing quests which by the way lack variety and imagination in general. The game is very repetitive although it's very short. But when a short game feels like a 50 hours one that means the tasks are boring.

Nevertheless the game is pretty fun if you don't expect much from it.
The level design is pretty good and running around in that beautiful world is fun. It's a chill game with no pressure or hard tasks.

There are some challenges for the achievements which might be little annoying due to being repetitive and janky controls. But nothing too bad, i've seen much worse. You will need to run a lot, to same places, get the collectables and other items.
I think this game is perfectly suitable for children. It's colorful and cheerful.

It was a mobile game and it's pretty old game by now but it looks pretty good and I can't say anything bad when comes to graphics. Not a blockbuster level of quality obviously but it's cute and charming including the main character, side characters and all the areas are really cute and creates a charming atmosphere.

Animations are better than many games which came out recently and I was really surprised about that. Great job devs.

When it comes to sound it's decent. Music is fine and fits the mood of the game well but there are no voice-overs.


It's a decent game if you want something cheerful and relaxing. It's pretty short and lacks variety in tasks but it's definitely worth picking up on sale.

This game has fantastic art direction and looks incredible for an UE3 game. I experienced no issues and ran the game free of technical issues. The KB/M controls seemed good, but I used a controller. You can't remap keys. The game doesn't support 21:9. It supports 4K, and some tinkering will let the game run over 60fps.

The game is fairly simplistic and only moderately challenging even on the hardest difficulty, and felt like the developers were aiming to attract children as their primary whales. This was an iOS game that was ported to PC and PS4. You can tell by the structure of the game it was designed with micro-transactions in mind and to be played in small repeated bursts. And yet I played it for 6 hours and had fun exploring and playing.

It's charming, relaxing, and something to chill out to for a few hours. It's heavy on repetition so be warned you'll be breaking thousands of pots and scaring hundreds of birds.

The game can be summarized very easily, so I'm just going to do a Bullet Point review for this one.

-Story revolves around Lili, a student from a magical academy, who comes to the island of Geos to pick flowers. She gets involved in the local conflict between wood constructs, and plant Spirits. As it goes along you learn more about her past.
-Gameplay revolves around speaking to people for sidequests, and performing QTE minigames to pluck flowers from spirits. The entire game is essentially these QTE events, which are picking flowers and avoiding bombs.
-Spirits are rated on score, so there is a score chase element.
-Story is very simplistic, game is only a few hours long. Can get repetitive since once you've seen how one spirit works, you've basically seen them all - there's just more bombs, or more thorns.
-There is no traditional combat, and no puzzles (beyond ""How do I get in this room"" or ""Where is this NPC"")
-Some unlockables, some new abilities to buy, mostly improvement of basic stats, like movespeed and grip strength. Strongly recommend maxing movespeed as soon as possible. There are some costumes as well.
-Other very minor minigames, like a shellgame, exist, but for the most part it's dialogue and QTE events. There are collectibles to find around the world as well.
-Several achievements would need a NG+ to do in any reasonable fashion.

However, my first experience with the game lasted <15 minutes. Had Steam had a return policy at the time, I would have returned it immediately . I even began questioning my friend's character and taste in games. This game was nothing like I typically played. The combat system involved plucking flowers off creatures that looked like they were covered in wall siding, and the challenge level was close to 0. 

BUT---in the middle of 2018, I was having a rough time with my career and personal life. My typical go to games weren't cutting it. I wanted to be distracted, but I didn't want to play anything too challenging or dreary. I decided to give this game a chance, and boy, am I glad I did.

This game brought a serenity I hadn't felt in a long time. It was simple, wasn't high stakes, and didn't make me feel worse after playing it.

If I would describe this game in one word it would be ""pleasant"". You can't stay sad and play this game - you have to pick one. 

Is it for everyone? Nope. But if you like simple and cute games that don't require a lot of mental effort, this is a good one. 
It is short, I probably completed it in 3.5 hours - and the achievements are mostly collecting flowers or breaking pots which can get a bit repetitive. 

Even now in 2020, if I ever think of games that are just ""pleasant"" my mind first goes to this game.

I couldn't justify running this on a tank so I ended up never playing it. Recently bought a lackluster laptop that could run it okay and finally played it. Because I had it forever and I probably got it in a bundle or something.

The game is downright beautiful. The lights and particles along with the shiny textures scream tropical. The colors are flush and pop in a very delightful way, and everything is just polished and looks very good.

Gameplay is simple, make money, take out baddies, gather rare flowers, solve quests to get more flowers. It's fun, however, the game is well over before you really can get irritated by the way some of it is structured. So short in fact, that trying to explain specific situations in which the game acts up, or is just unfortunate mechanically, will feel like I am spoiling the game. 

The game is worth a look... But I'm really no sure about how much you should pay to get it. My game time says 8 or so hours, but that time was filled with arbitrary things like kicking jars, scaring birds, picking flowers, and starting over to max out a skill i didn't have enough points to in the main playthrough. And doing things like picking flowers, kicking jars and scaring birds have their achievement progress locked to your save, so you can't multitask while unlocking your last skill either. Not a gripe at all, but I'm just putting it out there so you can attempt to gauge how much of that time was spent... doing nothing.

I guess the most similar game I would relate this to is, Starfox Adventures. But without the puzzles. Just adventuring and killing one enemy type. at 15 dollars I would much rather you save a few more bones and play something else, but if you manage to find this game bundled with something else, it is a nice cute stroll. I am happy I played it. And recommend you do so if it is already on your list of games you own, or at a sub 10 price... If you don't have means to play starfox adventures, or something like that. The game takes a real big liking to Zelda... Maybe go play that.",1586397662,1586397662,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I was disappointed with this game, sometimes you simply cant trust the tags on the games' page, got this thinking it was in fact a rpg-focused game but it isnt, its something completely weird, first of all I love the artstyle and graphics, the game is GORGEOUS and I would love if we got this artstyle on an actual RPG game from the likes of zelda or a platformer, but what we got is mostly a walking simulator, you just walk around this town talking and knowing more about its residents with sometimes mundane tasks throwed in like grab 5 flowers scattered arond or find a key to open a door to another section of the map, the game main focus besides walking around and talking is ""purifying"" those spirits around the map, which is such a weird stuff to focus on a game like, your main focus is rid the evil of those spirits, how do you that ? you simply run after them (they flee if they spot you) and them you jump and grab on them which will start a weird minigame where you have to drag flowers out of them... WHAT ??? and you complete missions you get upgrades to last longer and complete this minigame faster, thats pretty much what the games revolves into, i have no idea what the devs are smoking and why they decided to make the game like this, its just a walking sim with a weird minigame throwed in the mix, nice graphics ? yes but that doesnt excuse the boring, repetitive and unconventional gameplay loop.",1578095875,1609732178,False,4,0,0.571644723415374756,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The environments and the characters are brilliantly designed. The story is short and simple (you can probably beat this game in less than three hours if you don't try to 100% it), but satisfying enough.

The game does try too hard to be funny at times, and some jokes just don't land, but for the most part it's charming. The soundtrack is nice but gets repetitive fast, and so does the gameplay. This is essentially a flower-picking game (you beat enemies by plucking out flowers that grow on their backs), but a very pretty one. It's very chill and the ""combat"" is not violent at all, so it's ideal for kids.

I thought it was strange that this is described as a RPG, because the only RPG-ish element this game has is a choice on how to level up three stats (speed, stealth and grip), which don't really matter all that much.

I wouldn't reccomend paying full price for this, but definitely consider it if it's on sale.",1570647477,1570647477,True,0,0,0.45792841911315918,0,False,False,False,False,,,

New or rare game mechanics: [NO]

Personal opinion: 
[Honestly, there's not much to say. Aside from the pretty graphics, there really is nothing outstanding in ""Lili: Child of Geos"" which I would consider to talk about. The story's presentation is weird, some might like it for the quirky humour here and there but this is as far as it goes.
For the gameplay, well, I wouldn't mind it as much if the story would be interesting. Games with going from A to B can be great, just take a look at OneShot. Yes, there's just a little more gameplay in ""Lili"" but it becomes just unbearable when you don't get a satisfying reward (in that case a good story) out of it.
And the grinding tasks don't make it any better.
The game looks good so it is a shame that it drags itself down so much.]

Price: [BAD]
- If it's not at least on a 75% sale, don't even think of buying.

Game length: [5-8 hours]
- You'll invest most of your time collecting annoying stuff for the achievements (collect 1000 etc...), the game itself is rather short.

Lili is a simple game with cute graphics and charm.  You explore four areas doing simple fetch quests and ""defeating"" spirits.  The spirit ""battles"" consist of quick time events, however they aren't that quick, you have plenty of time to press the correct button.  There is no dying in this game, if you lose a spirit battle you just get knocked down.  

There are many achievements, most are easily obtained.  There are some I skipped, such as collecting 1000 flowers and breaking 1000 vases.  The flowers and vases respawn when you revisit an area.  I played with an Xbox controller and it doesn't tell you what the buttons do.  The Left Trigger is a speed sandwich, which increases your speed to catch spirits as they run away.  The Right Trigger is a flash bomb, which will remove thorns and bombs during the spirit battles.  The Y button is the invisibility potion, which you can use to get past certain enemies with shields that knock you back from reaching an area.  You can also press X to use the flash bomb, however that doesn't have any effect during regular game play and you press the trigger to use it during the spirit battle.

Turns out you will try to free the people of this Island from their ""evil"" masters.
Originally a mobile game, Lili:COG is a really neat little game that will take you to a nice Island where you roam around and help people do quests. I recommend it if you are looking for something light and relaxing to kill few hours (5h max I'd say). However, this is not worth 15‚Ç¨, try to get it cheaper, around 5‚Ç¨ or less.

(+):
* Relaxing gameplay
* Beautiful world and graphics
* Nice dialogues and colorful NPCs
* For what it worth, this is a ""family friendly"" game, if you have a kid, that's a good buy

(-):
* Some achivements are bugged (not a big deal unless you are an achivements hunter)
* One quest is badly created and throw you in the incorrect direction. Nothing the community HUB can't resolve however, just search for it in the discussion.
* Not worth 15‚Ç¨. I would recommend it around 5‚Ç¨ or less.

Customization in here is fairly limited, there's a lot of cameos to a lot of older games, and achievements that aren't difficult at all rather mind-numbingly grindy.

The humor is what really makes it.  The game mechanics are pretty basic and the quests are fairly simple. Despite all that it was still super fun to play.  I would recommend it if you want to play an easier game with a lot of quirky character.  If your one of those people who explore everything and talk to every character then this would be good for you.

Yes, you read that right.

Pros:
* Novel ""combat"" system.
* Fun characters.
* Four mildly varied areas.
* Has three stats (and three stat-boosting equipment slots) - which are all equally useful, when you come right down to it.

Cons:
* Easy to farm for the ""skeleton key"" - I never bought even one disposeable key.
* Getting the bigger achievements requires really tedious farming - I'll pass.
* Probably a bit simple for teenagers, but shouldn't be played by Jr High-School age kids.  (I enjoyed, after I reset my expectations)

NOTE if you do buy: If you don't get a 3-star win on any combat, be SURE to click ""rematch"" - else, you may not be able to try 'em again.  Only says this after the 1st combat or two.

TL;DRL 6.5/10 if full price - else, maybe 7.5/10.",1537939598,1537939711,True,3,0,0.579077661037445068,2,True,False,False,False,,,

It was extremely bright and colorful, because it was set up as a ""for kids"" MMO. Nobody died, the focus was on harmless exploration and minigames instead of lots of combat (although it had some), there were concerts and lots of outfits to collect...

That's what Lili - Child of Geos reminds me of. Lili arrives on Geos Island, where wooden constructs are held in service to various spirits. Lili, researching for her degree in plant magic, can climb onto these spirits and pluck the magic flower from their back to defeat them and make them blast off.

Yes, this IS referred to once as ""deflowering them"". More on that in a bit. 

Aside from that you do a lot of exploring around the island, collecting things, breaking pots, breaking into people's homes, running sidequests...

That's another part of the MMO comparison.

The third part is that much like Free Realms was, Lili - Child of Geos is GRINDY AS HECK. In my 4 hour playthrough I broke about 140 pots and picked about 245 flowers, for example. The top-tier achievement for each of those requires 1000 EACH. I beat about 20 spirits, but it wants me to beat 50 and rematch 5 and 3-star all of them and...

So that's clearly not going to happen. 

Aside from that, Lili really wants to be a noncombat Zelda game. (You can get the hat and fairy, and two of the treasures you can find on the island are the Sword of Masters and a weird golden triangle thing that's probably important to SOMEbody.) 

The thing is, it's full of weird dumb ""Gamer"" humor to the point where Lili herself is a huge video game geek and just spends a while identifying meme quotes from video games in one of her side conversations. You've got jokes about 'deflowering' and pixelated 'naked' photographs of the wooden (sexless) constructs at the same time as you have bright bloomy landscapes and ""collect 20 gems"" gameplay.

Man this game ... I can't figure out who it's for. Kids? Sarcastic adults who hate violence? People who just really like when a game lets them wear hats? ... Rare fans?

I enjoyed the experience but I'm glad I got this for only a few dollars. At the current non-sale price of $15 it's a HARD no, no matter who you are. If it were on sale, it could be a provisional yes depending on how you feel about doofy humor and using a controller instead of the hideous mouse controls.",1535910114,1535910114,True,7,1,0.635318994522094727,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The environments are beautifully made, and I was always excited to see what each new area was going to look like. 
My favorite zone in particular was Rust Grove.

Rust Grove also had the best music track, in my opinion. The other songs were... a bit more ordinary, but not bad.

With the environments being first, the characters are my second favorite thing about this game. They are interesting and silly, and some have a decent amount of dialogue that I recommend clicking through and reading. Their designs are also very quirky and refreshing.

The story is cute, but it's rather short and plain. Nothing spectacular.

The gameplay is nice, but fighting Spirits got kind of boring after a while. Unless you're like me and you want to complete everything, you may not feel that way.

As far as bugs are concerned, I didn't experience any while playing.

A personal pet peeve of mine is grammar mistakes, and this game had quite a few of them. I'm not going to tell you to skip out on it because of that though.

I bought Lili: Child of Geos while it was 60% off, and played it for around 10 hours getting all the trophies, and doing everything it had to offer. 

Overall, I recommend this game only if you have nothing better to play. I don't think it's worth the full price, so I also think it's best if you wait for a sale.",1526783201,1526783513,True,0,0,0.475517898797988892,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Man, am I disappointed. 

The story was incredibly short and rather lacking. The characters were pretty one dimensional and Lili's character development in the game is more awkward and strange than anything else. I get the message they were going for but it's really forced and doesn't really make sense. In the end, I really had zero attachment to any of the constructs or even Lili. There was potential for so much to be done with the constructs and their backstories and even the backstories of the spirits but instead it's just tiny bios that get shorter and more nonsensical the further into the game you go. 

A lot of the references to other games also feel forced. Everything regarding WoodBored bored me and made Lili look like a pretentious brat. A lot of the humor really relies on a certain type of player...

""Combat"" is EXTREMELY repetitive and the vast majority of achievements are absolutely mind numbingly grindy. The 1k flowers isn't so bad because flowers from spirits count. But... 500 vases? Scare 500 birds? Extremely boring. The nice towns were just not enough to make vase hunting really worth it, especially since money is such a nonissue there's not much reason to hunt them down during normal gameplay. I wish I were kidding that most of my time spent in this game was kicking vases and scaring birds. The birds actually glitched on me, too. It stopped at 306 and I had to make a second save just to finish that.
I felt no sense of accomplishment from really anything in this game. It was a series of fetch quests mostly and overuse of a flower picking minigame.

The one thing I liked is the one thing that drew me to the game in the first place but even that had some disappointment as I progressed. It really is a pretty game. The constructs have some decently varied designs other than Wanderer and his many clones (soup guys). The spirits, however, were all nearly identical. Their masks were the only thing that was different between them. Sure, their bios varied, but then the later spirits you encounter have absolutely barebones entries. There's no reason to care who any of the spirits are aside from the Mayor.

This is fairly ranty so I'll end this here. 

In short, I really can't recommend this even to people who just want to pad out their achievements. It's easy but just not worth the time.",1526627701,1526627701,False,10,0,0.618895471096038818,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sotto queste condizioni, mi spiace, ma devo bocciarlo, perch√® per me conta il primo prezzo. Se lo trovate a molto meno per√≤ fateci un pensierino.
Intendiamoci, il gioco non √® terribile, ma l'esborso non √® giustificato a fronte di contenuti davvero miseri. E non solo.
Il gioco consiste nel liberare una isoletta dal giogo di una banda di spiriti cattivi, comandati dall'autoproclamatosi sindaco locale, anch'egli uno spirito come i suoi scagnozzi.
L'isola √® costituita da una serie di mappe (5 o 6, ora non ricordo bene) lungo le quali si incontrano dei personaggi amichevoli (costrutti), fiori da raccogliere, vasi da distruggere e bauli da aprire. I vasi e i bauli danno come premio una certa quantit√† di denaro e gli ultimi anche degli oggetti, a volte utili per missioni secondarie (loffie e pochissime) che vengono assegnate dai costrutti. I fiori invece possono venire convertiti in denaro nell'unico negozio dell'isola per acquisire potenziamenti od oggetti (ma anche abiti per la protagonista, inutili, solo estetici).
Potenziamenti ed oggetti servono per migliorare e/o attivare tre caratteristiche della protagonista: il movimento in stealth, la velocit√†, la capacit√† di aggrapparsi agli spiriti (pi√π √® alta, pi√π tempo si rimane aggrappati). Ma a cosa servono? E' presto detto: lungo ogni mappa si trova una serie di spiriti che vagano a caso. Bisogna avvicinarsi e saltarci addosso aggrappandosi. Alcuni per√≤ fuggono appena sanno di essere visti, quindi la velocit√† serve a rincorrerli pi√π rapidamente e la capacit√† stealth ad avvicinarsi senza essere visti.
Una volta aggrappati sugli spiriti parte la fase focale dell'intero gioco: un combattimento che funziona essenzialmente come un Quick Time Event. Sullo schermo appaiono i 4 tasti del pad da premere e bisogna farlo velocemente prima che il tempo scada (si ha pi√π tempo con una capacit√† di aggrappo maggiore). Nei negozi si possono acquistare anche delle bombe accecanti che in questa fase sono utili a disorientare per un poco lo spirito e rallentare la sequenza.
Il grosso problema di questi eventi √® che sono confusionari e poco divertenti: mi sono ritrovato pi√π volte inondato di icone da premere, decidendo di premere i tasti a cazzo e riuscendo lo stesso nell'impresa. In altre parole, il fulcro del gioco √® questo, ma quando arrivava il momento mi veniva voglia di sbuffare, talmente √® fatto male.
Tutto cos√¨, fino allo scontro finale compreso: 

1- entri in una nuova mappa
2- fai un paio di missioni secondarie (puoi anche non farle)
3- uccidi i 3-4 spiriti che ti vengono indicati
4- passi alla mappa successiva

Non tenendo conto degli achievement il tutto √® completabile in circa 3 orette (o anche meno). Davvero pochissimo.
Gli achievement sono altra cosa: alcuni prevedono la raccolta di 1000 fiori e 1000 vasi e mille altre cose... uscendo ed entrando nelle mappe questi oggetti si risistemano, quindi si dovrebbe fare avanti e indietro in continuazione per arrivare agli achievement. Il problema √® che raccogliere 1000 oggetti vagando per il nulla cosmico puzza davvero di riempitivo per giustificare 15 euro.
Le ambientazioni per√≤ sono davvero molto belle ed evocative, anche se con interazione nulla. Ma dopo un poco vengono a noia. Anche la canzoncina di sottofondo √® molto carina, Zelda Windwaker Style. Solo che va in loop e dopo un po' comincia a sfiancare.
Il gioco √® tutto in inglese. Ora, non √® proprio un inglese facile (con alcuni costrutti che distorcono le parole), ma non √® questo il problema: la storia √® meno di mediocre, non c'√® un vero interesse a seguire le vicende, per cui all'ennesimo siparietto parlato (tramite fumetti, non vi √® doppiaggio) leggere diventa anche molto fastidioso. Perch√® quello che i protagonisti dicono non interessa a nessuno (due uccelli chiedono alla protagonista di togliersi gli occhiali per vederle gli occhi, e la cosa va avanti per linee di dialogo: interessante).
L'ho giocato con il pad, ma la mappatura per l'uso degli oggetti in game √® davvero scomoda e confusionaria. Forse √® pi√π apprezzabile usando mouse+tastiera.
In definitiva, a parte i difetti elencati, i due punti di forza sono essenzialmente l'aspetto visivo e il senso di leggerezza e di pace che il gioco trasmette.
Ho letto di bug qui nella community, ma io non ne ho trovati. Se mi fosse accaduto qualcosa di spiacevole, avrei azzannato il prodotto in modo molto peggiore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lili: Child of Geos nasce con dei presupposti ed un contesto particolari: √® un progetto mobile succesivamente portato su PC, il che renderebbe comprensibili alcune mancanze del titolo, ma d'altro canto gli sviluppatori sono ex-dipendenti di Epic Games, che quindi dovrebbero essere in grado di sfruttare l'Unreal Engine (motore utilizzato per questo gioco) al massimo delle sue potenzialit√†.

Il risultato √® un'incredibile via di mezzo: un gioco che √® piacevole da giocare e scorre senza problemi, riuscendo anche a intrattenere con [u]una storia e dei personaggi vivaci e ben caratterizzati, ma che scade in meccaniche di gioco semplici e ripetitive le quali non forniscono al titolo la minima rigiocabilit√†[/u].

[b]Parlando di gameplay[/b], il gioco si basa sull'esplorazione dell'isola di Geos (suddivisa in 4 aree) con lo scopo iniziale di raccogliere alcuni fiori che la protagonista dovrebbe usare per completare un progetto scolastico; le pieghe della storia ci porteranno poi a combattere degli ""spiriti"" e quindi migliorare le nostre abilit√†, rompere vasi ed aprire casse alla ricerca di denaro per poter comprare oggetti e potenziamenti.

Il problema principale √® che [u]l'unica componente action del gioco si riduce a dei ""combattimenti"" eseguiti tramite Quick-Time-Event[/u], mentre invece i dialoghi, il completamento di piccole quest secondarie, l'esplorazione delle abitazioni e la raccolta delle risorse sono estremamente semplicistiche e risultano quindi ripetitive a lungo andare.
Si pu√≤ quindi notare come, in realt√†, [b]il paragone che viene fatto dagli sviluppatori tra questo gioco e mostri sacri come Zelda o Psychonauts in realt√† cade a pezzi[/b], perch√® la complessit√† di Lili: CoG non sfiora minimamente quella dei titoli sopra citati, n√® tantomeno la sua longevit√† √® paragonabile.

Analizzando invece [b]la grafica[/b], si pu√≤ dire che il colpo d'occhio offerto dal gioco, grazie anche all'[u]ottima scelta estetica effettuata dagli sviluppatori[/u], risulta molto piacevole con alcune scene e paesaggi che hanno veramente un look fantastico; con il controller alla mano, per√≤, si possono notare varie cadute di stile dovute a effetti post-processing (non rimovibili dalle opzioni grafiche) totalmente fuori posto che vanno quasi a rovinare l'impatto visivo generale: in particolare un'aberrazione cromatica fuori luogo ed un motion blur di scarsa qualit√†.
[b]La musica di sottofondo[/b], anche se non conta tantissime tracce diverse, riesce ad accompagnare piacevolmente il giocatore durante le 6-7 ore richieste per completare il gioco.

Una nota dolente ricade - ahim√® - sul [u][b]doppiaggio[/b], praticamente assente da ogni personaggio (inclusa la protagonista)[/u] se non per alcuni versi e vocine che vengono utilizzati in corrispondenza di animazioni durante i dialoghi per sottolineare un particolare stato d'animo. I personaggi risultano comunque interessanti e spesso anche simpatici nel loro essere ""cartooneschi"", ma avrebbero giovato grandemente da un doppiaggio che caratterizzasse ancora di pi√π le loro personalit√†; in ogni caso la protagonista risulta subito molto carina, simpatica e vivace anche senza un doppiaggio.

Anche [b]la trama alla base del gioco[/b] - semplice ma non banale, anche nelle tematiche trattate - ha delle potenzialit√† che si sarebbero potute rendere molto meglio dedicando pi√π cura ed attenzione al lato narrativo del videogioco; la storia risulta comunque un buon accompagnamento per le avventure della nostra Lili sull'isola, portando il giocatore a provare un senso di appagamento quando riuscir√† finalmente a sistemare la situazione sull'isola di Geos.


[b]PRO:[/b]
+ Un ottimo stile estetico, colpo d'occhio sicuramente piacevole
+ Protagonista carina, vivace e simpatica, vi affezionerete facilmente
+ Storia semplice ma coinvolgente, buon accompagnamento durante il gioco
+ Ambientazione azzeccata, personaggi e atmosfera ben caratterizzati
+ Controlli fluidi e interfaccia dei menu facilmente navigabile
+ Completo supporto ai controller
+ Carte collezionabili di Steam

[b]CONTRO:[/b]
- Meccaniche di gioco semplicistiche e ripetitive
- Longevit√† non eccezionale e rigiocabilit√† pressoch√® nulla
- L'assenza di doppiaggio pesa notevolmente sulla narrativa del gioco
- Prezzo troppo elevato per un gioco portato su PC da mobile
- Effetti di post-processing fuori luogo
- Implementazione degli achievement penosa, trofei stupidi e con trigger pessimi


[h1]Voto: 6.5/10[/h1]
Non √® difficile notare che il gioco ha una sua anima e un buon potenziale, ma la scelta di meccaniche semplicistiche e ripetitive (probabilmente dettata dalla natura mobile del gioco originale) e la realizzazione tecnica non troppo curata rendono il prezzo pieno di 14.99‚Ç¨ totalmente fuori luogo per quello che il titolo ha da offrire. Se trovato in saldo a ~5‚Ç¨ per√≤, questo titolo sar√† sicuramente in grado di offrirvi qualche ora di piacevole rilassamento mentre vi avventurate in esplorazione dell'isola.

[b]Pros[/b]: Pleasant characters, nice look, charming style, very easy, approachable to most people I imagine.

[b]Cons[/b]: Inexplicably poor performance, dialogue is not voiced, instead it's text with moving models/faces which is sort of ridiculous for a modern title. The island can be a bit large/winding to navigate comfortably, and as travel/backtracking is required if you are impatient it can really hamper the experience.

[b]Bonus Con[/b]: The developers abandoned a more ambitious and better looking title to rush this one.

Despite the game's simplicity, it manages to be utterly addictive. The world is gorgeous, and the characters that fill it quirky and adorable. The game's humour is also fantastic, and there's a bunch of references to well-known media. 

Some advice I have for new players: Don't bother buying keys. Convert your flowers to money and you'll quickly have enough to buy the skeleton key, thus rendering buying small keys a pointless waste. I had enough for the skeleton key before reaching the third zone (there's four in total). Also pick as many flowers, smash as many pots, and rip the flowers off spirits as much as you can. Even if you don't want the achievements for it, it'll still be helpful in getting resources. 

All in all, it was a very cute, quirky, and memorable game. Possibly one of the best I've ever played, in fact. There were a couple of minor issues (slightly awkward camera controls, occasionally getting stuck), but nothing game breaking. It's a solid 10/10 for me. And tbh, even if the rest of the game totally sucked, I'd be inclined to at least rate it a 7 for the fact that there's a genderqueer spirit.

[b][u]Positive:[/u][/b]


[list]
[*][b]Story:[/b] Quirky, light-hearted characters and story (which still has a message you might/can think about for a bit)
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]lore and world:[/b] The lore and world feels huge compared to the shortness of the game! Every character is unique and fun to talk to, every spirit has his or her own characteristics and there are a lot of lore items to gather. I would love to explore more of this world... Or just have it be bigger in general.
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]References and humor:[/b] I found the references to other games and things quite funny and the tone/humor in general made me chuckle from time to time. 
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]Graphics:[/b] Good looking for what it is, of course no high end graphics but I enjoyed the art style and the looks of it (also rainbow colored paint pooping birds.... !!!)
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]Outfits and Collectibles:[/b] Yeah most of the Outfits are the same just differently colored but outfits being rare nowadays without having to pay for them makes this a plus. There are also quite a few hats and masks to gather and a few pets. Makes my inner perfectionist smile tho <3.
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]Sound/Music:[/b] the music fit perfectly most of the time. The last area felt a bit off sometimes as it went into action-heavy music even though I was just running around collecting flowers. All in all it didn't feel bad, definitely not one of those games that makes you hate the music because you just can't listen to it anymore but also not super awesome like Nier or Kingdom Hearts. 
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]Controls:[/b] More of a positive even if it has some flaws but the option to play with a controller saved the game for me. I personally used the controller even though the game doesn't fully explain which button does what (accidentally used some items trying out the controller, but meh). Main reason was the flower plucking mini game (aka ‚Äúfighting the spirits‚Äù) as it felt awkward with the mouse (although the idea of actually plucking the flowers is awesome! And it makes a lot of sense for a former mobile game). With a controller it's a lot easier and I'm happy they support controller usage (playing the game with mouse and keyboard only would've probably ruined it for me). 
[/list]


[b][u]Negative:[/u][/b]


[list]
[*][b]Length:[/b] Very, very short with only 3 hours to finish the game (achievements not included, going to need a few more hours for the more grind heavy achievements) and probably even less time if you just do the story part
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]Side-quests and npcs:[/b] Very little side quests and a lot of npc were unused after introducing them to you, felt like a lot of wasted potential (maybe I missed something or it is bugged for me)
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]‚ÄúBugs‚Äù:[/b] minor bugs but nothing that a bit of wiggling around couldn't fix, the quest marker being buggy and not disappearing was a bit more annoying (achievements were fine for me, only missing 2 of the more grind based achievements)
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]False advertisement:[/b] I would recommend watching a video first if you can't decide. I read the description on steam before writing this review and most of the points they make are just not true. It's by far no Zelda game (I haven't played the other two games they give as a reference) and other things they state are also... no really true. No ‚Äúhuge number of quests‚Äù, [spoiler]there actually is no choice (or not a lot, yes you do have the choice if you want to fight the spirits or do quests to progress)[/spoiler] and definitely no reason to play it for 40 hours (except MAYBE if you want to have the best score in every spirit, but why? Or if you want to play it once a day, but why again? xD)
[/list]


[b][u]Neutral;[/u][/b]


[list]
[*][b]Difficulty:[/b] As I only played on normal I can't say a lot here. Normal difficulty felt OK and appropriate, had to redo maybe 3-4 fights cause they somehow threw me off, but the game isn't supposed to be hard IMO.
[/list]


[list]
[*][b]Skill tree and items:[/b] I mean it's nice to have stats and it felt like they actually did a bit but they still felt glued on. Could've easily done without them. Same for the items, I rarely used them and the bomb sometimes even made it worse.
[/list]


[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b] I would recommend the game. It is a small indie gem and I enjoyed my time with it, especially because I bought it on sale. The full prize of them game feels a bit expensive, I'd say it's more of a 10‚Ç¨ game give or take.


I would definitely buy and play a bigger more fleshed out version of this game! More areas, more quests, more story, etc! And maybe then the advertisement would actually be accurate ;)",1510225172,1510226074,True,6,0,0.599503517150878906,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The world itself has charm but feels very sectioned and restricted. It has small blasts of originality but the areas are too similar. There isn't really anything distinctive about them.

It's also very repetitive and the final achievements are a real grind and lazy. Do you really need to kick a thousand vases?

For kids or casual players who are just getting intio games, I would reccomend it highly.

The graphics and animations are vibrant and smoth with solid controls. Some decent humor and interesting characters. Most of the game consists of defeating spirits by chasing them and jumping on them to pick flowers out of their heads in a mini-game that is kind of like Simon. If that sounds appealing to you, by all means get this game because, other than fetch quests and exploring, thats really all there is to it. You beat the game when you beat the Mayor spirit of the island. Not much replay value but I didn't finish everything. Not much incentive to after beating the last boss besides just acheivements.

- good graphics

- nice simple relatable story
- funny characters
- soundtrack (gets a little boring after a while)

- keys can only be changed editing the configuration file, that is bad game design
- no voice acting, it has a little but is just a glimpse of what it could have been
- could of had more achievements for finishing the game on other difficulties (not really a con i know)

Lili: Child of Geos is sooo the place to go!

I really liked this as a getaway. Maybe it sounds silly but collecting flowers once in a while isn¬¥t a bad throphy to strive for. 
It¬¥s a simple but nice story with very likeable fairytale like NPCs. To be honest, I¬¥m not one of those players that need high end graphics, so with that being said: I really like the graphics off this game. 

But there are two Con-Points on my part:

1st: The Music is kinda repetitiv and can spoil the overall relaxation (which I found in the game). Luckily it can be turned off.

2nd: I have a different understanding of full controller support in a game. It¬¥s not that the game does not tell you straight up the allocations of the controller, thats ok. BUT, the forgott to allocate the <WALK> Botton. ;0)
So, after you leveled up your speed, it¬¥s kinda ""Running Only"".

The plot is decent, the gameplay is pretty fun, and the world looks absolutely beautiful... but there's one big issue that might be a potential deal-breaker for some people.

I have an Alienware 13 with an Intel i7-5500U processor (2.40GHz), an Nvidia 960M GPU with the latest drivers, and 16GB of RAM. When I'm using the game's ""Low"" graphics setting, I can get only just above 30fps if I stand still and stare at a wall. If I use the game's ""Highest"" graphics setting and I'm moving a lot or generally trying to play the game, I can easily end up with less than 10fps. (For comparison, my computer can easily and consistently get anywhere from 120-150fps in Portal 2 without even breaking a sweat.) I have no idea if the problem is with the game or my computer (though I'd be very, very surprised if it was the latter), but this definitely needs to be mentioned, and hopefully fixed.

Other than that, this game is a great experience and a lot of fun, considering that it's a PC port/expansion of a tablet game. Though I was a bit disappointed when I had to play on the ""Low"" or ""Medium"" graphics settings to have a framerate better than ""slideshow"", I didn't really notice it after a while and was simply able to enjoy the game for what it was.

The other thing I'm slightly disappointed by - though in a good way - is that there isn't any way to get the soundtrack! The background music is all really nice and calm for the most part, with simple instrumentation and nice melodies. If there was a $1.99 DLC I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] If the very thought of getting less than 60fps makes you want to throw up and/or throw your computer out a window, I wouldn't recommend this game.

Graphics: 10/10. Everything looks absolutely gorgeous.

Sounds: 8/10. Solid sound effects, pleasant to listen to and add to the ambience.

Music: 10/10. Calm, relaxing, and fits the carefree adventerous spirit of the game.

Story: 9/10. A pretty good story overall; I don't want to spoil anything though. The characters have a good bit of personality, and you can find items with random bits of lore attached to them all over.

Gameplay: 8/10. A solid core of exploration, and the spirit wrangling minigame is pretty fun. Somewhat gameplay-light, but it fits the game well. My only real complaint is that the white flowers you collect don't really do all that much... you can turn them into keys (rendered obsolete as soon as you get the Skeleton Key, which you can do pretty early), sell them for money, or gamble them for a potentially larger amount of money. I was kind of hoping that they'd do more than that.

Overall: 10/10. A short game, but a really fun one.

A quick note: While the game is mostly kid-friendly, there are a few moments of subtly racy humor here and there. It's nothing a kid would really get though, so it's probably not a major worry.",1474913081,1474913081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Lili is a wonderful litle game, I gotta say. The art style is fantastic, everything looks so vibrant and full of life. That's actually the main reason I bought it. However, the fantastic scenery isn't the best part. Lili's cast of characters are quirky and unique, all with plenty of soul about them. There wasn't every a single time when I could say I was bored with this game.

Now, that being said, the developers did say it was originally going to be a tablet game, and you can tell. While that is by no means a bad thing, it may throw some people off.

Another thing is, holy moly, the music is fantastic. Each zone has its own original track that plays throughout that just sounds wonderful, in addition to a few other tracks you'll hear when fighting a boss or entering a room.

Each zone is crafted in such a way that is unique from the others, but still fits the over all feel of the game, filled with its own ""Constructs"" (the wooden robot like inhabitants of Geos) that all have things they need help with, and with malicious spirits that need a good clobbering.

One thing I will say, and this may be a negative to some, and a positive to others, but this game is incredibly easy, once you have the controls down. Like I said, it was originally supposed to be a mobile phone/tablet game, so it takes a bit of getting used to on keyboard and mouse, I'm not sure how it feels on controllers. It gets especially easy with the addition of power ups and items.

One final thing as well, the game can run very well even on older systems. I purchased a copy for my sister as well as myself, and her gameplay looked identical to mine, and she's using a 9 year old Nvidia GTS250 graphics card and an Intel G3258 processor, and she had no issues at max settings. So, props to the developers for optimizing their game so well.

Pros: 
Fantastic scenery 
Wonderful OST
Fun characters 
Fun ""combat""

Cons:
Relatively short game
Pretty easy, although to some that may not be a bad thing.

all in all, for what it is, I love this game and highly recomend it.

If you are like me, someone who feels compelled to break every pot and whatnot, then you won't find the repetative collecting annoying. Flower picking sim at it's finest, but I enjoyed it. I actually went through and got 3 stars on very single Spirit. 

The nods to Zelda and the one LOTR reference I thoroughly enjoyed, though I wish the underlying cannabalism story had been touched on more.

- too easy spirit fights, even on hardest difficulty

RESULT:
I can highly recommend this game, if you like exploration games. There are some battles, but those are only a reaction test, nothing really special or challenging, even on the highest difficulty. The music, atmopshere and graphics are really outstanding and comes with a few of different settings for the player to explore. Every character in game is different and loveable. For achievement hunters it's also interresting, that all of the achievements are easy to get. Only a few achievements need some grinding. Another cool thing is, that there a two different endings, but those are only a bit various from each other. The storyline is nothing special, but the one or other suprise you might experience anyway. For me personal even the 10$ are not too high priced. After all I got 9 hours of gametime, so only 1 hour too less for best time/price performance. :) (\√¥/)",1472734184,1472734184,True,7,0,0.641325473785400391,0,True,False,False,False,,,

 There  is nothing  bad  about  Lili  and it  was ok . It has great  visuals and  the sound and music is ok. The writing for the characters  was very good  and this is where the game shines .  This game is a very short  . This is what you do in the game  talk to  constructs  those  are the ones oppressed by the  sperits. 

Chase the spirits  ( the oppressors ) and pick flowers off there back .  kick pots full of money and open treasure chest with various items in them .   It is a very easy game to complete. But it is a very short game .  If you read the description this was originally  a game played on   smart phones,   Given my play through of   it do I recommend you buy it ?  


I would purchase it but at a reduced price .. There is not what I would call full voice acting . Each character has  a sound loop  with various sounds. Given for various printed   answers .But with limited  sounds  and face expression .   Lili  in my opinion does not have a lot of replay value . I would  say playing this game is like watching a very good old Walt Disney cartoon   movie. That you had not seen before. .  but once you see it the first time  you really do not want to be watching it over and over again. 

Also fair warning I did not have any  problems with this game . But  it seems others have  and according to this  LiLi community thread the developers have  abandoned the game years ago .

The characters are pretty original, and the gameplay style is something on it's own.

The story is basically you're a botanist girl going to a strange island to learn about the flowers. While there, you meet these wooden NPCs called Constructs that you befriend. You find out they're enslaved by the spirits, and so you go on a quest to defeat the spirits and free the constructs.

The gameplay is mostly simple. It's just find the items or jump on a spirit's back and take their flowers to win. The key element that makes the game enjoyable is how beautiful and crisp all the design is. Everything is in an almost super-HD style and it is really pretty.

Assault, kidnapping, attempted murder, cannibalism. Yes, cannibalism. 
Enemies beg you to stop, pleading to not be violently deflowered. That's right. You violently deflower your enemies from behind. Chasing them down, or sneaking up on them from their blind spots. When you're close enough you'll [b]leap upon them and begin your assault[/b]. They'll beg, plead, cry out in pain, even struggle and lash out to shake free from your grasp. And you'll set an actual flashbang off in their face to pacify them while tightening your grasp on your victim. If you do well enough you'll also collect a trophy in the form of their mask they wear, available for you to wear. Showing your next victim they aren't the first and likely won't be the last. When The Mayor stations guards to stop you, a merchant sells you information on where they'll be. This allows you to get the drop on your next victim blocks away from those ordered to protect the people you're assaulting.
One of your victims worries their spouse will leave them after you've violently deflowered them. Young, old, male, female. The main character does not discriminate. Eventually assaults the Mayor in the same way, claiming him as yet another notch in the main character's belt. This is some seriously messed up, rapey stuff. And all of this is in the game, including dialog.
A game Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton would approve of. 
At the end of the game main character's father mentions the main character's deceased sibling. At no point in the game are we introduced to this information before then. The fact that the it comes up so very late in the plot can only mean the main character murdered their own sister. The main character is a psychopath, maybe even a drug dealer.

It's colorful and interesting and to be honest, that's the part that pulled me in. Actually playing it though was something else.

It's a game that focuses more on the story which is fantastic because this is what I'm here for, I bought it on sale from summer sale, because it looked pretty and seemed interesting at least from the story aspect, but it's one of those stories that kinda throws it at you like a brick through the window. Here's Lili, your main character. What's she doing on Geos? Looking for flowers. How'd she get here? Shrug. Why is she not surprised by these talking constructs that are literally made out of wood that she did not expect to find? Seen stranger, I guess. 

All your motivitation for this game is: I told you to. The enemies are jerks, and they're mean so go beat them up for us so that they can be less jerks and we the little people can stop being bullied around. But what about the enemies (the sprites), like, why do they do anything? Idk, they're just... jerks. They go out of their way to show you how big jerks they are by pushing your construct buddies to the ground and laughing evilly, but why are they evil, and why do you care? Because flowers. So let's just goddamn, body tackle them from behind and yank out their backhairs until you yank the /special/ backhair. For science (Literally).

It feels like a kid's game, and it is, because it's a simple concept, it's bright and colorful, it doesn't punish you, but it feels TOO kid's game. A stealth game where I don't really need to sneak if I can just chase them into a corner and yank their backhairs I mean hell they turn around for me. 

I'll be fair I didn't play too much of the game, but I really didn't feel like going forward. I didn't care about the story to get over the slippery controls (I mean it, it's slippery. I kept wrestling with the camera because it kept feeling like going more to the left than what I asked it to.) The keybinds are for keyboard, but when you're doing the combat (yanking backhairs) bit, it suddenly swapped to controller which blindsided me the first time. It feels like a game with a lot of potential, but it also feels very unfinished. It feels like there should be voice acting, it feels like the sounds are stock, (Lili has the world's loudest clunky footstep sounds), the story seems so strangely fragmented that the text seems translated from another language.

I absolutely love the way it looks. And now I'm going to throw in my two cents about this title.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+Game is absolutely gorgeous, great art style, nice textures, some decent graphics, nice use of shaders and shadows especially.

+The worlds are very nicely detailed but not too detailed to keep with its somewhat cartoony/realistic style.

+Characters are all really nicely detailed, matches the style perfectly.

+Writing is very well done, some nice jokes that don't go over your head and just nicely done in general and each character has their own style of dialog. There are a ton of hidden adult jokes in the game, it feels almost like there was a conflict between writers, one was trying to put in all these clever little dirty jokes while the other wanted to keep it clean. And I love it, the jokes and gags are well done and not too silly or too adult. Example: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=717972689

+Xbox 360 controller support with two control options, MMO and FPS with keybinding.

+Kid friendly for the most part but it's done in a way that it's friendly and interesting for everyone, even adults.

+QTE's are fun when they work properly.

+This game has hats that are not micro-transactions. You actually...dare I say it...UNLOCK THEM BY PLAYING.

+Pets that do absolutely nothing but look cool.

+Costumes.

+Really well done music, has a Wind Waker vibe.

+Get to explore the island after completing the game.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-Very basic game, there's really no depth to this game at all and the gameplay consists of running around, talking to people, doing some very limited side quests and then doing a QTE mini-game to defeat spirits.

-Controls are a bit confusing when using a gamepad, I personally use an Xbox 360 controller on 3rd person action games and racing games if I'm able to. Lili has some very confusing ideals for the controller. There is no pressure sensitivity for walking/running. I managed to get her to walk once by slightly pressing the stick to the side but that was it, only once. Controls for items on the UI are still showing keyboard inputs and NOT the X360 buttons. Double tapping A will make her run infinitely which is annoying when trying to click on something. Game auto locks onto items and people, I've had this happen to me a few times when trying to attack spirits and all of a sudden talk to a villager even though the cursor was showing on the spirit and NOT the villager. Also, for some reason while running, if you hold the camera left or right, your character then stays stuck running in the direction you were holding when the camera was first being turned, it's not a big deal but it makes the game feel a little clunky.

-QTE mini-game messes up, like a lot. I had the camera go into other characters, buildings and walls constantly during the mini-game. Sometimes the camera would look ABOVE the spirit and my character so I couldn't see anything at all. The QTE controls also mess up. You can press a button too early even though you saw it pop up and sometimes the buttons change around for no reason and a lot of the time the buttons won't show up or show on items you can't do anything with, like all four buttons will be highlighting the sharp weeds on the spirit's back and you have to just wait as a bomb is about to explode. I've had bombs explode because of this issue but I only ever had to retry the spirit fights twice, ever as the QTE's aren't hard, the hardest part is the bugs. I also never used an item during any of the spirit fights. And sometimes during a spirit fight, you'll pluck a flower and it will also trigger pulling a sharp weed as well, it can be very annoying at times.

-+Performance issues. The game runs fantastically for me and it looks great 99% of the time, but sometimes it'll just drop to 30-40FPS out of nowhere at the most random times, this happens in a lot of games, but there is literally no reason that a game this small in scale should tax a R9 270 2GB at 1080p, specially when there's no AA going on. This game also lacks a lot of video options, it has no advanced video options and no audio options. So a warning to those with lower specs.

-Costumes. This is my biggest gripe in whole with this game, it totes itself as having costumes but every single one aside from the secret costume at the end is just a re-colored version of her original outfit. The secret outfit is nice at first, but then you really get a look at it and it's very poorly put together, there are a lot of sharp angles, her legs are messed up and it's honestly just not that appealing. I really wish there was a costume pack or something with genuinely nice costumes.

-Bugged hat. I collected everything on my first run through the game without using any kind of walkthrough because I like to be surprised. Well, I found everything but one hat. The blue bird that you can get as a hat and a pet, I missed the hat, you get it from the cardboard axe dude, I missed it and now I cannot get it again unless I replay the game. That's annoying. I just wanted everything in a single playthrough.

-The devs try to push the game as a Legend of Zelda like title, [spoiler]they even have an outfit and pet hinting at the series[/spoiler] but it is most definitely not. It doesn't feel like a tablet title as it was born from, but it most certainly doesn't feel like a LoZ like game. And that's not a bad thing, the game is fine and isn't trying to be anything it's not but it's a bit misleading to potential buyers, especially since the art style is clearly inspired by Wind Waker minus the cell-shading.

-Game is super short, I beat it in a single sitting of only a few hours and got everything but a few achievements and a single hat that you can‚Äôt get if you missed the window to collect it.

-Music volume. It is so loud and no way to adjust in the menus, especially right in the beginning. Luckily, it's got some really nice music, sadly, there are very few songs.

[h1]Ehh's:[/h1]

-Annoyingly long achievements. Almost all the achievements for this game are just okay, I have no problems with them. But there are two I dislike; break 1000 vases and pick 1000 flowers. You'd have to beat the game a grand total of about 12 times if you were just casually smashing vases or picking up flowers and not purposely trying to get the achievement. I just don't have the patience or will power to play such a short game so many times to get two simple achievements specially since it takes a whole two seconds to break a vase when it should be instant for such a grindy achievement.

-Hats just don't fit right, they look really strange on Lili, like they're way too big and most of the hats are not very inspiring or ""cool"". I just feel nothing when I put a new hat on her. Masks are fine, the wings are really nice too, but the hats just do nothing for me.

[h1]Closing & Other Thoughts:[/h1]
Overall, I really dig this game. It‚Äôs not GOTY material or anything and it is a very well done port of a tablet game so don‚Äôt expect anything too crazy out of it, but it is a fun exploration game. Just know, you‚Äôre playing this game for the story, writing, art, music and characters and not the gameplay itself.

The game has some annoying issues that I addressed but ultimately, I still really liked this title and recommend it to anyone who likes exploration, story or puzzle games.",1467718143,1467987925,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Normally I'm not the adventure game type, and considering there isn't a huge amount of variety in the tasks required (nearly everything is a ""find X of Y"" hunt), the world as a whole is actually very well rounded and detailed both graphically and with optional flavor text and dialog. The characters are well personified with minimal (absolutely minimal) but well done voice acting.

It is also short, and I manged to beat it in ~3 hours. There is a choice to be made at a pivotal point in the story so I might actually go back and try to take another path. Plus there might be some things that subtly change the ending dialogs. I almost certainly missed some side quests/characterization too. For a relatively short game they managed to pack in quite a bit of content.

The story is simple but serves the purpose well, as does the crude level-up stats system. This is not an RPG to the extent that you need to consider min-maxing the few stats you have, and they seem to have minimal impact on gameplay. There are no dialog trees, but the dialog is at least partially context aware: If you encounter a character before you were meant to, often that encounter will be acknowledged during the dialog with other characters (eg: ""Oh, I met (character) earlier..."") which adds a nice bit of immersion.

The flower picking mechanic (flowers basically being used as a form of currency) is a bit tedious, and picking enough to get all of the extra items (keys, mostly) to unlock all of the optional doors and collect trinkets/flavor text is a daunting task. There is an achievement for picking 1000 flowers and boy howdy do I believe that could happen...

There's also an achievement for breaking 1000 pots - you basically walk into people's houses and break their pots for money Legend-of-Zelda style. That number seems to be a lie, though; The achievement counter advanced by 5 for every 2-3 pots broken, so I suspect the *real* number is 500. Still a lot though.

There is no health/death mechanic, and the consequence for failure is being teleported a small distance away.

The semi-optional mini game where you cling to the back of the ""enemies"" and pick flowers out of their heads is fun at first but gets annoyingly difficult. It is only required a handful of times, fortunately, and the reward for completing extras is merely extra masks that your character can wear.

The map consists of six areas - one of which is a single room you only deal with for an optional side quest - four of which are 99% of the game. These areas are fairly good sized, richly detailed, beautifully rendered but labyrinthine townscapes in which you meet the characters, collect the trinkets and find the switches which are the meat of the gameplay. The design and styling gives each area a very organic and ""lived in"" feel despite the cartoonish colors and proportions. It won't dazzle you with blooms and particle effects but it is very pretty. The mechanic by which you move from one ""quarter"" to the next is *nearly* seamless, with just a slight hiccup as you transition through an airlock-esque connecting area.

There is an abundance of invisible walls which gets a little annoying at times.

The protagonist character, which you play as, is notably not an annoying brat, moody or woefully inept. That wouldn't normally be something to mention... maybe I just have far to cynical a view of modern adventure games.

Finally, there is no foul language, sexually suggestive themes/dialog (not even a passing euphemism!) or meaningful violence - all ""fighting"" is the previously mentioned minigame where you sneak up on enemies and pluck flowers out of their head.

Overall a great game and I'd recommend it.",1467671640,1467671640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is a bit short, as you'd expect. But I had a lot of fun with it. And I'm on my way to 100% the achievements. It's at best, a game that will take you 5-7 hours to complete, if you're going for everything.

------

I like this game.

It has a nice charm to it. I'm not far into the game, but it's one of those casual RPG games where you go around collecting everything you see. On that part, it's not too overdone, and it actually makes the game even more peaceful for what it is. It's a light RPG. Best way I can put it, is - it's kind of Zelda-esque, just without any of the intense and fast paced combat.

I'll be honest here, this is one of the best games I've scored on the Steam Sale so far, at just .99c, it's hard to argue that I can possibly put many hours into this, if I want a relaxing game to go to. 

The graphics are great, and there isn't much else to it. The controls are fairly simple, the game itself is not hard to pick up. It's a perfect game to de-stress.",1466736199,1491499089,True,18,0,0.713677048683166504,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I don't remember exactly how I got this game (I think there was a Female Protagonists bundle?), so I didn't really know anything about it before it was in my library. I didn't know that it started out as a mobile/tablet game, but it makes sense considering much of the gameplay would probably be more approachable on a touchscreen.

You play as Lili, a sort of magic-botanist grad student who has traveled to an island to collect flower specimens. You navigate around a small number of interconnected maps, collecting flowers, smashing clay pots full of coins, and completing minor quests for townspeople. There is growing tension between the masked spirits of the island and their peaceful wooden servants, and your specimen hunt lands you right in the middle of the conflict.

While the exploration and character interaction is fun and engaging, the majority of the game seems to focus on one particular minigame, which is sort of a precision flower-plucking game. While clinging to the back of a masked spirit, you must accurately grab sprouting flowers while avoiding traps. The spirit bucks back and forth to create moving targets, and occasionally interrupts your progress with a ""frenzy"" of traps. This minigame is reasonably fun to play, although I don't think the instructions were very clear. You pick flowers while exploring by simply clicking them; to pick a flower in the minigame you have to click and pull away to uproot it. The more advanced stages get very chaotic, and it's unfortunately very easy to lose track of your cursor with all the bright objects flying across the screen.

The biggest issue I have with this minigame is that there are FIFTY separate instances for you to complete, and there's not enough variation between stages to justify more than, say, ten. Add the fact that each instance has a 3-star scoring meter, giving compulsive completionists like me cause to replay them, and it starts to get really grindy. Because of the emphasis on this particular part of the game, I assume this was the core concept that the rest of the game was built around.

Also grindy are the optional achievements for plucking flowers and smashing pots, which set the goal at 1000 (!) apiece. The flowers and the coins found in pots both function as types of currency, intended mostly for use in the item shop. The shop doesn't carry much; you can buy stat boosts, consumable items to make the plucking minigame easier, and a map upgrade (which I actually found pretty essential). There's a separate shop that sells single-use keys for locked doors. I don't quite understand why that wasn't just incorporated into the main shop, since the main shop also sells an expensive but reusable skeleton key. There's an achievement for maxing out each of your 3 stats, but for some reason they didn't make it possible to bring your 3rd stat all the way to max, so you can't 100% the game in a single playthrough.

The music is charming and pleasant, the designs and palettes are visually appealing, and there are some great particle effects. I had some trouble with the camera (mostly the FOV) when I first started the game, and it made me feel kind of queasy. It didn't help that the first area also has lots of lens flare and water spray, but once I got into town it became manageable. 

The writing was more clever than I expected, considering how cute and all-ages the game apparently is. I don't mean the plot, although there are some dark touches here and there. The character dialogue and some of the menu descriptions have a lot of character and sometimes give teeny-tiny hints of being sort of not exactly all-ages. It's often self-aware, but never self-congratulatory. As an added bonus, the main character is allowed to be female without the writing needing to rely on ""girl"" tropes.

There are a couple bugs (sometimes the minimap toggles off when you decide to challenge a masked spirit again) and more typos than one would expect from an updated release. When you pass through a loading gate between maps, the camera and music both stutter and it's a bit jarring.


I would love to see either a remake or sequel with more areas and a greater emphasis on exploration & collection rather than chasing & plucking. Maybe all the functionless Lore Items need to be redistributed to the correct NPCs, etc., and find more reasons to reuse existing characters and give them more involvement.

Overall it's easily worth playing. It's fun and bright and engaging, and for me, the great one-liners make up for the grinding.

Really boring, and not my type of game.

First the options menu: It's horrible. Only a few resolution options, a few buttons for graphical options, which are preset according to setting like High, Highest, and so forth. No actual customising available. Keybindings cannot be changed. Basic mouse options of inverting, and mouse sensitivity buttons, rather than a bar or a number. All in all, the options menu needs a lot of work.

Game starts off talking to everyone, and walking into building to talk to more people. You can also add to your fun by breaking vases or opening chests. The chests contain items that have really unfunny descriptions. That is basically a recurring facet of this game. Unfunny dialogue, stale descriptions, and flat jokes.
During dialogue there is some voice work, but it doesn't match the text. Rather, it's your character saying hello multiple times in a conversation, and the constructs/spirit things making weird sounds.

Finally, the character design is pretty bad. The female doesn't have to be attractive, nor have large assets, but I'm going to have to say the haircut is pretty horrid. A tumblrina if you will. The whole look of her is unbecoming to me, other than the outfit, which is passable. I suppose she matches an explorer, although it feels like the designer wanted her to be Lara Croft, just without being attractive in a tradional sense. I suppose the word is, hipster. This is of course subjective, but will this present times inspired look work in the future, should someone find themselves playing it? Does it work in present times? I don't feel her look emphasizes 'geeky girl'. It's different, and I feel emphasizes tumblr, SJW, feminist, things of that sort. I personally don't fall into that camp, and as such, makes me worry that the game is designed by a development group that IS affected by those camps. Politics don't belong in a game, unless directly marketed as such, and creativity marred by such a thing is troubling. From what I played of the game, I don't necessarily think the game itself is an extension of SJW beliefs, but I believe the creation of the character you play as in a physical sense, IS affected by the creators political beliefs. Take that as you will.

The world is colorful, and the game is inoffensive, in terms of interactions, but it just seems aimed at a younger audience, or people with easily offended sensibilities. I like a wide range of games, whether shooters, puzzles, rpgs, or some adventure games. I'll even go back to games like legend of zelda, or super mario bros. This game, however, is not my cup of tea, and I cannot recommend it. It lacks depth, and your interactions with the world reflects that. I didn't feel engaged, and more like the game was a chore. Maybe I'll come back in the future, but as things stand, it's too boring to hold my interest.",1462288279,1462288279,False,3,0,0.377531081438064575,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Pros:

+Gr√°ficos bonitos y cuidados.
+Jugabilidad sencilla. Compatibilidad con el mando.

Contras:

-En las opciones de configuraci√≥n se nota bastante que un juego de iOS remodelado. Especialmente en la escaasa configuraci√≥n de video. Se han olvidado de decir las funciones de algunas teclas.
-El valor de rejugabilidad es escaso. Una vez has vencido a todos los esp√≠ritus no tiene sentido quedarse dando vueltas para coger las 1000 flores ni mucho menos romper las 1000 vasijas. Que haya que jugar dos veces para conseguir el logro de maximizar todos los stats tampoco tiene sentido.
-Se parece a Zelda, Broken Age o Psychonauts en lo que un huevo a una casta√±a.

Lili is a short, story heavy game with beautiful graphics and simple gameplay. Controlling Lili, a teen researching this colourful island for educational purposes, you find the island is full of slave like, wooden built, sentient robot humanoids run by evil spirits (who are in the form of creepy, mask wearing creatures). The plot is simple; stop the spirits and let the robot things be free and happy. 

When it comes to gameplay, this game can get boring quickly, since there are a small amount of mechanics used to vary the gameplay up. Defeating spirits is fun at first, but after realising the amount of spirits there are to defeat in the game, I couldn't be bothered chasing them and accomplishing repeating quick time events over and over again. Sure, defeating them isn't wasted, as oyu are rewarded with their mask and character biography. Every character has a biography, which is nice, but not all characters are interesting. The main characters you meet in the story are charming, cute and even funny when reading their dialogue.

Overall, this game is colourful, happy and relaxing. Don't let the advertising image fool you, as this is far from a LoZ game.

You get a nice little selection of alternate costumes (mostly colour-swaps), a large selection of hats, and a few companion animals that float along-side you - all aesthetic goodies that serve no purpose, and that's how I'd want it. The dialogue in this game is solidly written, with some memorable characters; one in particular is a veritable stream of game references, which you will also find in hat collection. Will you be donning a plumber's hat, or perhaps a green hood with matching tunic and fairy? It's a little on the nose and slightly out of place, but all in good fun.

The game isn't 'huge'. You get four small areas of the island to explore, filled to the brim with unique characters and flower-picking 'combat'. You'll spend a few hours here, deep in the game's universe of wood-sprites and mask-wearing opressors. The only complaint I have about this game is its acheivements. Get ready for the long-haul, because the number of pots to break and flowers to pick requires 3-4 playthrough-lengths of grinding spawn points over and over.

Not gonna lie, was not expecting much when Lili's character model loaded on the beach and then walking towards walls pushed me forward. However, I got something that was really fantastic. I really miss this genre of games that were popular in the N64 era, and don't understand why they died out. 

Basically, you're going around collecting flowers off the heads of ""Spirits"" which are tyrants of wood people called Contructs in order to further your studies as a ...flowerologist? (they made up some name for it don't remember anymore.) 

Anyways, if you miss these open world collecting games you'll love this. It could do with a lot of fine tuning, especially with Lili. She doesn't have any idle animation except for her fingers twitching and her clothes/hair are constantly being wind blown even inside buildings. Sometimes they zoom in on her face and she's totally expressionless in the few cutscenes they have and I feel like there's more that could be done with it. Also, I don't like how she halts when she picks up flowers from the ground or breaks pots. Kills the flow and makes collecting even more tedious. 

Upside, the writing is well done and a lot of the characters are extremely likeable and goofy. I actually had a good laugh at a couple of the Spirits and I don't often when I'm playing games by myself. Constructs can be kind of adorable too but many of them sit around crying about being slaves like it's even that hard on them. You got ping pong, guys. Lighten' up.

They don't hide the games influences (Legend of Zelda, Mario, Fruit Ninja are all referenced heavy handedly) so if you enjoy those games you'll have fun.",1450716132,1450716132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This was originally released as an iOS game and it shows. The game can be completed within about 3 hours. It isn't a very complicated game and is extremely kid-friendly. The whole game tasks you to explore around the land while doing simple subquests for its inhabitants.

There are some hostile enemies called ""Spirits"" that you will encounter, but because this game is kid-friendly, you don't actually engage in combat per se. The way to defeat these Spirits is to pluck flowers from them. Yes it sounds kindda silly, but then again, this is a cute little silly game in a way.

The graphics looks gorgeous despite it being an iOS game and the artstyle looks somewhat like Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker although the bloom effect is used abit too much. Soundtrack is appropriately cute with little jingles and the animations are pretty well done. 

The over-arching story while simple and humorous can be unexpectedly dark for an older audience with its underlying story of slavery and freedom. Younger children will however probably be too distracted by the action to focus on the story.

The game also features lots of in-jokes and item collections that pays homage to classic games. (Eg: Super Mario, Legend of Zelda, Portal 2 etc.) It can be quite addictive to try to collect everything and the game allows you to continue to play even if you have completed the main story.

Overall Rating: 7 / 10
A very short family friendly game that is surprisingly quite entertaining. While the game is probably targeted at children, there are some interesting treat for older audiences.

Lili Child of Geos √® un divertente gioco misto avventura/azione in terza persona con elementari meccaniche di progressione del personaggio. Dopo tanti giochi ambientati in mondi tetri e da paura, con colori smorti e terrificanti, di tipo horror, √® piacevole invece averne uno con colori sgargianti e luminosi, ambientato in mondi di favola. Ma anche in questi mondi incantati non si sfugge alla logica del cattivone oppressore di anime innocenti, per cui comunque bisogna sollevarsi le maniche e darle di santa ragione; solo che la modalit√† di combattimento √® una simpatica lotta di tipo particolare, assolutamente non cruenta ed in sintonia con l'ambientazione, di cui non voglio parlare per non rovinarvi la sorpresa a scoprirlo (dico solo che ha a che fare con i cavalli...).  La protagonista √® Lili, una simpatica ragazzina alle prese con un bizzarro esame per diventare una maga o qualcosa del genere. Mi √® piaciuto anche la presenza di un guardaroba di vestiario sbloccabile e/o acquistabile per Lili, insieme ad altre trovate. La pecca, secondo me, √® la mancanza di un parlato che avrebbe dato al gioco un altro spessore, sostituito da esclamazioni verbali che ogni tanto sia la protagonista che i personaggi non giocanti si lasciano scappare. In tal senso √® strano che non si sia prevista la possibilit√† di poter far scegliere all'utente in modo separato il volume dei suoni e della colonna sonora: dato che il volume di quest'ultima risulta essere alquanto pi√π elevato degli effetti di sottofondo, dopo un po' l'ho disabilitata. Un'altro difettuccio consiste nel fatto che i personaggi non giocanti, che sembrano in libera uscita dal mondo del Mago di Oz, magari potevano essere resi con uno spessore maggiore, con maggiori personalit√†. Non manca neanche l'elemento di mistero, che il gioco lascia non svelato, su cosa sia successo in passato sull'isola prima dell'arrivo di Lili e su una misteriosa passata visitatrice ...",1444048081,1621797473,True,4,0,0.581749081611633301,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's hard to argue with anyone that might label this as a port of a casual, mobile, kid's game; you'll play as a young woman on a field trip wandering around an island, picking flowers, making friends and not really being challenged all that much. But while all that may be true, to be so reductive is to a do a great disservice to an amazing hidden gem of a game.

The most obvious strength of Lili: Child of Geos is its visuals, as there's a glowing radiance emitting from every individual pore of the world along with everything that populates it. But what's less obvious is the writing that backs it up. I feel like the dialogue in a lot of games is there merely to facilitate moving the player to the next objective or set piece, and I guess that's fair enough since actual game play is typically going to be the feature that gets top billing while the story is little more than connective tissue to form vague context for your actions. However, I think people sometimes forget gaming is an entertainment medium, and there's lots of other ways to entertain besides pure play, a fact this game thankfully does remember and arguably makes its greatest triumph.

The story is a strange mix of being playfully throw-away and surprisingly thoughtful and philosophical. Lili travels to the island of Geos in search of its unique floral life as part of a final school exam, but once there finds it is inhabited by Spirits and their workforce of slave Constructs. These large, wooden homunculi must tolerate the bullying whims of their masters lest they cease to exist upon failure to serve their purpose. I probably make it sound much heavier than it really is, but it does at least dabble with notions of free will and life choices and prioritising the things that are really important to us, which are bigger issues than most titles will ever dare to approach. As it transpires, these Spirits have the most exotic flowers, which also gives them their power over the Constructs, setting the scene for several hours of roaming Geos searching for Constructs to help and Spirits to deflower.

Geos is made up for four medium sized districts that are unlocked sequentially as you rid each one of its Spirits. The game and its world may not be huge, but that just allows them to focus on populating it with beauty as every inch of the environments are lovingly crafted with a wondrous level of detail. In many games you'll find yourself wandering into some stranger's house and find the entirety of their personal dwelling is made up of a table and a few chairs, or maybe a bunk bed and a fireplace if they're lucky, that sort of thing. I love how every single house in this game looks properly lived-in, with bedrooms, kitchens and even bathrooms, which really sells the illusion that this is a real world being inhabited by real people... or wooden slaves and freaky tree spirit things, in this case. I really wish more games would take the same effort to make the peripheries of the world just as interesting as its core like this one does.

Unfortunately, when it comes to game play, that's where I'd probably have to admit the game is at its weakest. You'll spend the majority of your time here either picking flowers, smashing vases, looting chests, talking to people or ambushing Spirits, with the amount of time you spend on each of these things pretty much depending on the type of player you are and what you decide to make your goals for this game. There's no combat as such, and you can't die, the only real challenge being trying to jump on the backs of the game's 50 Spirits and playing rodeo with them as you pluck their flowers off. Otherwise it's all a very leisurely affair, the only other complication being upgrades to help make your plucking experience a little easier.

So, yes, it's kinda short, it's arguably shallow in some areas, and it isn't massively challenging, but there really is so much warmth and charm and personality exuding from every part of this game that I feel like it more than makes up for any other shortcomings. Lili herself in particular is the very embodiment of this as she's an incredibly lovable foil to the rest of the cast and a perfect example of a well-balanced female lead that's entirely capable in her own right rather than lazy developers falling back on sexuality to sell a character. I think there's still great depths of enjoyment to be drawn from Geos, and especially from Lili herself, and I can't wait to join her again on her next adventure.",1443975685,1443975685,True,19,2,0.674412071704864502,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I started playing this game in the hope it would provide a counterpoint to Dead Island which had become exhausting and bullseye. After playing like 15 minutes I felt pretty relaxed. The game still has tense moments but all in all it's a pretty tranquil experience.
Although the game's world is not too big it has an expansive feel to it, maybe because it looks lived-in or alive.
The back story is rather light, maybe owed to the mobile origins of the game. You control Lili who has come to Geos as a Vegi-Magical student from the Gildern Magis College (with a deadline) but is quickly entangled in in the conflicts of a two-class society. Most NPCs have some depth to them which you learn by interacting with them, i.e. fighting the bad ones (Spirits) and talking to the good ones (Constructs). There is usually a reward for exhausting interaction.
There are some indicators to a story that happened before so there may be a prequel.
[spoiler]
[list]
[*]A Construct mentions a geophantasmogramist visiting the island before Lili
[*]There is a pair of glasses in the lighthouse that look like Lili's
[*]A letter from Lili's father mentions Lili's lost sister
[*]Lili finds a tombstone for a girl named Orchid, who may have been, fitting in with flower-named girls, Lili's sister
[*]The game's title is ‚ÄúChild of Geos‚Äù so Lili is supposedly linked to the island
[*]The fishes find Lili's eyes (without glasses; the player never sees them) very interesting, alternating between wanting others to see them or Lili to hide them
[*]Left over comb
[/list]
[/spoiler]
The Constructs are wood-based being making a disturbingly wood-based living in wooden houses with wooden furniture and wooden toilets, even toilet paper [spoiler]and even bringing it to a Soylent Green conclusion[/spoiler].
There are a number of pop-references in the game and there is a mock pop-quiz where Lili can show off here extensive knowledge of games.
There is also occasional, not too much, advertisement for another game by BitMonster.

The game is of moderate length and may take you two evenings to complete. You can explore the world some more after you beat it. There are a number of achievements that may make you play some more and the ‚Äúmax out skill‚Äù achievements actually require you to stature at least one additional game ‚Äì it took me not quite an hour to max out a single stat. Besides that there is almost no grinding.

Unfortunately, there is no voice-acting. Instead there are a few generic sounds or words, e.g. ‚ÄúHello‚Äù, and Lili's feelings are well-done by stances and facial expressions.

With so many games not actually having any actual options, I found it interesting that the game starts out with advising you to go to the options menu and offers to automatically determine your machine's graphic settings.

The controls work fine with the world's topology and are pretty tight with few exceptions. When chasing a Spirit it happened at times that instead of jumping onto them I suddenly found myself in conversation with a Construct or picking a flower because the game decided that was more likely what I wanted. Then you're supposed to collect flowers set around the world but a few of them are simply set in places Lili can never reach, e.g under bridges.
There is a number of different camera modes that aren't listed in the games help - I didn't find any use for them. Activated them with keys Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, then move around a bit to see their effect.

Lili: Child of Geos was a lot of fun and I recommend it. I bought the game as part of a bundle and probably wouldn't buy it for the full price (currently 10 Euros) but wait for 50% off.

[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]
Lili: Child of Geos is a 3rd person casual adventure game about picking flowers and exploring a strange, colorful and cartoony island. Said island is under the tyrannical ruler of the Mayor of the wood spirits. So, what's a girl to do? Pick flowers off of their heads until she viva la revolutions the entire island. Duh. I mean, using a sword/gun is so 2012 anyway. Well, the non-voice acted characters in this game are happy enough to greet you upon your arrival. Some have side quests and others just want to chat. The side quests are amusing (and sometimes eye-raising) but are pretty much busy work fetch quests. The exploration is reasonable but a bog standard affair of finding keys and opening locked doors/chests to locate the multitude of artifacts in the game. What‚Äôs rather interesting about the key system is that you can buy a skeleton key pretty early on and it makes a key vendor completely pointless before you even get the chance to encounter him. That wasn‚Äôt well thought out. Otherwise, this is a fairly standard and mechanically light adventure game. So, let‚Äôs talk about the flower picking. 

[b]Flower Picking Mechanics[/b] 
The main mechanic to fight the wood spirits is picking a certain amount of white flowers plus the final red flower from their heads within the time limit that Lili can hold onto the spirits. You have to sneak up to them or catch them in a run in order to start the flower-picking mini-game and this isn't very difficult to accomplish. Picking flowers is done by click and holding a flower and then dragging them away from a spirit‚Äôs weaving head as they run around. Lili must do this while avoiding accidental clicks on thorns or allowing bombs to explode. There are also green flowers that extend's her grip time and gold-coin flowers that give Lili, well, more gold. There are also ‚Äúbonus rounds‚Äù where the head may be covered with bombs, gold coin flowers or thorns. Upon completing the level, the game will rate your score, giving you one to three stars for how well you did. You can then replay each spirit to get a better score, if you wish. This is repeated for every wood spirit ‚Äúfight‚Äù and the only thing that really changes is the difficulty and amount of grip time Lili has. 

This mechanic isn‚Äôt the most interesting I‚Äôve stumbled across. It definitely feels like it was designed for touch screens first and it doesn‚Äôt make the best transition to the mouse. Its passable when using the mouse but I think you‚Äôd find it more entertaining on a tablet. The flower picking is certain different from what I normally see. However, I will say that It‚Äôs good that the campaign is as short as it is. Since it really starts to run out of steam towards the end. I can‚Äôt imagine a longer campaign sustaining itself on the back of this idea. 

While Lili claims it‚Äôs a RPG hybrid, it‚Äôs an extremely bare-boned one. The only things you can customize when you level up are your running speed, time under stealth and grip aka how long you can hold onto forest spirits. Which are certainly helpful to progress through the game, there‚Äôs not a lot of in-depth choice to any of these stats. The other things you can customize are Lili‚Äôs clothing, floating companion and hat she wears while running around the island. There‚Äôs a decent amount of selection but they only affect how Lili looks. 

[b]Story Thoughts[/b]
The story is pretty straightforward. You‚Äôre Lili, a student at some school who‚Äôs on assignment to this island to find flowers for some research project. Upon arriving to the island, she sees how the wood constructs are being oppressed by the wood spirits and their mayor. Though he‚Äôs not very good at stopping you from achieving your goals. The wooden constructs request that she helps them out. So, she does. What follows is an amusing, light-hearted exploration of the island. Littered with references, jokes and quirky characters. The script is pretty well done, especially when it comes to some of the descriptions of artifacts she‚Äôll find along the way. Though some of the character growth dialogue that Lili has feels forced or out of place. The whole subplot of Lili being unsure whether she wants to continue her degree at the college or if she wants to do something else. It just kind of comes out of left-field. 

[b]PC Settings, Audio/Video and Controls[/b]
Originally developed for mobile devices, Lili was ported to PC later on to mixed results. Lili‚Äôs settings menu is horrendous and lacking a lot of features that should be here. There‚Äôs a casual-normal-hardcore difficulty slider. Graphics can be changed but only with a quality slider low-medium-high that gives you very limited control on how the game looks. For resolutions, I could only select 1280x800 and 1680x1050 (my native resolution), with full or borderless window. Windowed mode doesn‚Äôt seem to exist. It's very inadequate for a third person title even if it does run rather well. Music can be turned on and off but there‚Äôs no slider to adjust the volume of the music or sounds. 

It does get worse with the keybindings. You can‚Äôt change them. The game simply displays a keyboard showing you what they are and that‚Äôs it. This is where Lili shows her mobile roots the worst. You can get by with what it has and the game is short enough to prevent it from being annoying. However, I'd prefer to see the devs make the settings menu more comprehensive and customizable in the future. 

Probably the biggest problem I had with Lili was the control scheme. Lili has two different input schemes: ‚ÄúFPS‚Äù and ‚ÄúMMO‚Äù. It seems that the MMO style was designed for touch screens while the FPS style was intended for regular PC gamers. The difference between the two is mainly how the camera can be changed in regards to your moment. MMO has you click and dragging to move the camera while FPS‚Äô camera stays with your mouse. Regardless of which style I picked, I was never entirely satisfied with how Lili controlled. She felt largely unwieldy to move around the island. Especially as you started getting movement speed items. It took playing around with my mouse‚Äôs DPI setting, the in-game mouse sensitivity and input scheme before I could get it to a place where I was reasonably ok with it. 

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
I liked my short time with Lili. However, I‚Äôm having a hard time deciding whether I should recommend this to anyone else. With the main mechanic being just about picking flowers, there‚Äôs really not much to this title. Even the flower picking is only really fun at first, then it loses its appeal towards the mid-to-late end of the game. There aren‚Äôt any puzzles or platforming or any other ideas to sink your teeth into. So, it‚Äôs a bit lacking. I‚Äôm also aware that this is a more casual adventure game. As such, I‚Äôm willing to let a lot of this slide because I knew what I was getting into. Additionally, there are control and PC settings menus that are just...extremely lacking. That all said, if you‚Äôre just looking for a casual adventure experience to break things up, Lili is a title to give a look. Otherwise, I‚Äôd recommend looking somewhere else for something that has a little more depth and content. Do not expect something on the level of Legend of Zelda or a more involved RPG because it will disappoint.

Pros:
- Very pretty
- Slightly absurdist, awesome writing
- Simple yet effective plot
- Gameplay is straightforward

Really the only major con is that it's a mobile port, so the ""combat"" aspect and RPG elements are well-defined but simple. It definitely works and is quite playable but the potential to have a bit more variety is there. Game is also pretty short, I played it in 4.4 hours in one sitting and I'm a bit of a completionist. I didn't get the 1,000s of flowers or vases achievements, but I did take my time. However, this was the perfect length for what I was looking for at the time. 

Excellent mobile port adventure 8/10

The game lacks any classical combat mechanics instead opts to use quick time puzzle events, and exploration to drive the story, and multitudes of side quests. The game is short, but does not over stay its welcome, and has more than enough depth to keep you pushing forward to complete the game and the optional side quests. 

Where the game lacks is in UI elements. The UI is often cumbersome or just archaic at times in its presentation and having to search through your pets, hats and outfits to find what you want. The other major issue that I ran into while playing the game was sometimes the controller would switch to keyboard and mouse controls and force me to switch out of the game and back in, in order to fix it.

lets have a look at Lili: Child of Geos.

You like brutal action with a variety of hundrets of Weapon and hundrets of different enemies?
You wan`t to see pixel blood and kill your Enemies?
All right!!!

So this game is NOT for you.
We have fast clicking action, you have one weapon (Your barely hands) and one Type of Enemies (Spirits).
You will see flowers and get them from their Head.
Sounds boring, hmm?

It is not!!!

Lili: Child of Geos is a small pearl in a sea of Sharks. It is a short but fine lets say Action Adventure with a nice graphic style and nice music. You are Lili and arrive and at to Island Geos on the search for flowers, because Lili is a Student and needs them for her exam. Fastly she found out that somethings wrong on the island and she, the only human on the 
Island, must do the things right.

The Graphics reminds me to an old game called Zanzarah (Nice game, you should google it.) and presents a wonderfull detailed world. You can control Lili via Mouse and Tastatur and have a free choice of your ways. You follow a main story but have sidequests. Your target is to solve the Islands Problems. You can earn money via collecting Flowers, finding treasure or defeating spirits. For those you have to come near them, jump on their back and in a minigame you must get the flowers from their heads. Sounds simple, should be, but can be harder as you thought.
You can also raise your skills, that helps you to get and defeat the spirits. Also you can spend the money in usefull items. 

Most of the achievements are very easy, some depends on grinding but i think the hardest one ist to defeat all the spirits in the Gold way (You can get Bronze, Silver or Gold, depends on how good you get the flowers from them). 

I like this game and i have much fun with it. Yes it is short. I`m through after about 5 hours, but i wan`t all the achievements, so i will play on. 
Thanks to Bitmonster for this little pearl. Would  be nice if you make a second part.

You go on quests, break pots to get loot, challenge enemies, unlock doors and the character talk in text not voice.  Lili is a less violent version of Zelda because you can't die and the enemies are defeated and not killed.  Instead of swinging a sword you pick flowers off their head.  It sounds like a cheezy game but I had fun playing it and it takes some effort to get through the game.  The graphics are really good and the gameplay is easy.  This game is no match for Zelda but it's a fun adventure none the less.  Great for all ages.  I would like to note that considering this game was originally a mobile app game I'm impressed how well it's made.

[b]Pros[/b]
Simple gameplay
Graphics
Clean language
Not very long (complete around 5-7 hrs).  If this was a Zelda game that would be bad but for this game it's good.

[b]Cons[/b]
Achievements - most are easy to get but there's one you can't get with one playthrough which I find annoying.  To get all 3 training achievements you have to play through a second time.  You can get 2 out of 3 in a single playthrough.  Also, the game wants you to collect 1,000 flowers and breaking pots.  The flowers one takes time but not hard if you constantly collect them.  The breaking pots one seems to take forever because there's fewer of them and never marked on your map.  By the time I finished the game I only broke around 500/1,000...ugh!  If you're serious about achievements that will take up more than 5-7 hrs to complete the game.  The achievement issue doesn't make the game bad, just annoying.",1437208638,1437208699,True,2,1,0.502044975757598877,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Basically, there are two possibilities: either you want all the achievements, in which case you'll play between 5 to 10 hours and have to start a second save (there is ONE achievement that cannot be finished with one save. But it'll take like half and hour MAX to get it done with the second, so...), or you just want to play the game to the end, which is maybe less than 5 hours. (all this in casual mode)

I liked playing this. I had two or three times when Lili got frozen/bugged, but they were resolved with a menu on/off in two seconds. The game is very repetitive, if you want all the achievements (get 1'000 flowers, 1'000 broken vases,...), but those will go much faster if you check the tips section on Steam's page.

The characters are interesting. It's nice not to have human characters for once, and the dialogs can be fun in a nonsensical way. For a female character, Lili isn't even written annoyingly (much) which has to be noted, since female characters make so very often me want to slam them into the wall. Guys definitively can't make female character interesting. It's like they can't imagine that they could possibly multi-faceted. 

Anyway, nice game. Not worth more than the 10 ‚Ç¨ it is sold at, but fun and beautiful, and easy enough if you only want to play the casual mode (haven't tried normal/hard though)

Ah, one thing: you can't change the keys in the option menu, and wasd in azerty keyboard is a pain.

I bought it (like many people have) based on the dazzling screenshots and videos on the store page, and because it said it was an RPG. It took about a minute since I booted it up to realize that what I had just bought was in no way an RPG and in no way the game I had paid for. If only the Steam refund system had existed back then.

The sad part is that this game is beautiful. Really beautiful. The soundtrack isn't half bad either. Now if only those things could have been combined with a robust combat system, a world larger than 3 subdivisions in a small town and more than just a smattering of a story line then it might have been a runaway hit instead of such a letdown. Seriously, you can beat this thing in 3 hours or less, and all the side quests are nothing but fetch and find quests.

I want to like this game, but I just can't bring myself to.

You play as a young woman named Lili who embarks on a quest to deflower an island of spirits for her botany thesis and save wooden people from certain doom. I enjoyed that there's some darker themes to this game too- cannibalism, drugs, and murder to name a few. 

The fighting is extremely fun, you hop on top of an unsuspecting spirit and yank away at the rare flowers growing from them while avoiding being shaken off or hurt by traps. You can replay certain enemies as much as you'd like- and the bios definitely had me giggling.

I think the story is original enough and the characters are quite quirky In my opinion and quite likable ^^ Among them are some (Seemingly flirtatious) fish and wooden constructs. You get to do side quests helping out the residents etc as well which makes it a lot easier when you're getting to grips with things. I wouldn't say I loved this game but it was charming in it's own way, one thing I really liked about it is that you're free to explore the Island as much as you like during or after you've finished. I would say it is more suited to younger gamers as it's quite simple and tame, also you might find that the achievements during the game are glitchy. A lot of people have had random achievements being unlocked at different times but if this doesn't bother you I'd recommend it :)

And having 3 skills that just do the thing a little better (Speed = faster walking) does not an RPG make. At least IMO.

After I stopped trying to compare this game to what I thought it was going to be, I really enjoyed it. You have to accept that most of this game is running. Go back and watch the trailers and see what happens: running & talking to NPCs. Which is indeed what you do but it's fun because of exactly those things. The world is really amazing; it looks beautiful and unique. The dialog with the NPCs has great humor and various video game (and other media) references and the music is just plain amazing, mostly because it sounded inspired by the music of Zelda games. I found myself reading the text of everything in the game (Treasures, baddies, etc) because they were often very funny and often had great references to video games and things of other media. And Lili is a pretty awesome protagonist.

I feel like this game gets a lot of flack because it's not what people expected, which is true. The way it is marketed is rather misleading so as a result, a lot of people buy it who would not have if they had seen footage of it represented properly, which means they won't enjoy it. No, it's not going to appeal to everyone, but I would argue that there is a large number of people who would find it very enjoyable. It's a very original, simple adventure game with video game references, amazing atmosphere, and great writing. And it's got hats. How can you go wrong with hats?

I bought this game based off positive review and what seemed to be a game with rather pretty game design from the trailers. And sure, the game is rather gorgeous on most occasions. What really bothers me, however, is that all the overworld design and assets ultimately do not play a huge role in what becomes the main goal, so there is no real incentive to explore the world at large. There are mini-quests you are able to undertake, but they are simple ""just find x in this area"" collection quests. Movement is alright, but there is no jumping or running, and speed boosts and special potions in this game seem kind of rough around the edges, ultimately not fitting in with the rest of the game design.

To save the spoilers, albeit the story is rather sparse and easy anyhow, you play as a graduate botanist student where the main goal of the gameplay is to jump on the backs of spirits, and by using the keys (or the xyba buttons of an xbox controller) you must grab a special flower off the spirits for your report. It's simple, cheesy at times, and vaguely child-friendly. There are constant innuendos, so I guess it's supposed to be a game for everyone, but the simplicity of the game mechanics and the lack of content reveals the game to be a simple collection time-waster for a much younger age group. And although I would recommend this game for a younger audience, this game may never challenge anyone older than 8 years old.

If you are someone who is looking for a cute puzzle platformer like I was, then do not buy this game. I'd recommend that people keep an eye on this studio, however, because it seems like they have all of the assets to make a great game, but did not deliver on anything substantial this go around.",1433698435,1433698435,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

While easily beatable in a single sitting, Lili manages to nail several things that far more complex (and higher budget) games from bigger name studios struggle with. All the characters are interesting and memorable, the controls are elegant and simple, the writing is legitimately funny, and the social dynamics at play feel strangely believable. It even manages to have an actually realistic lead woman, a college senior working on her thesis in magic botany who has a complex family dynamic and struggles with the question of what she actually wants to do with her life now that she's on the cusp of her degree. Interactions with the game's NPCs fill out her personality wonderfully, and Lili manages to become a more developed character in the span of four hours than many games several times its length ever achieve. She even has a normally proportioned body! 

If you're into fun little puzzle games with good writing, but aren't looking for a major investment, Lily is absolutely for you. 

The only real flaw with the game is that its developers tried to be a little too pop-culture-reference-y, and especially seem to be obsessed with the Legend of Zelda series. References to Fruit Ninja mean Lili will become as strangely dated as Disney's Hercules now seems. So long as you don't mind the odd reference, though, the game is an absolute little delight.

First off some of the most notable bad features:
1. The controls starting off suck. If you are using a controller. The game does not tell you what buttons do what. All the key maps are for the keyboard. That is until you start playing and enter combat. Then they show up as the controller keys.
2. The resolution cannot be adjusted in the game. You will need to edit the config file if you are not happy with the settings. (FYI that file is filled with junk you will need to sort through).
3. The storyline starts off very pathetic and Lili just decided to do whatever everyone wants,

With those out of the way, you have a short, lighthearted adventure game. You play Lili who ends up on the island looking for flowers for her Vegi-magic college assignment. There are 3 types of inhabitants on the island. The constructs are the ones you will interact with for quests. The fish will give you general information and the spirits are the guys you need to battle to get the special flowers. The story starts off slow and progresses more about Lili's life and the freedom of the constructs. The enphasis on flowers starts to slowly go away as the quest to defeat the evil mayor takes full stage.

The combat system in this game is a bit different. Both good and annoying. You must jump on the back of the spirit and collect flowers. Once you jump on them, thorns, flowers, and bombs pop up on their backs. It is your job to hit the right button coresponding to the flowers and bombs. Get enough flowers in the timeframe and you defeat it. Fail and you just fall off and have to run back up to it and try again. There is no dying in this game so you can keep trying all you want.

The graphics are beautifully done. The locations are vivd with life. For the most part, all with the exception of a few constructs look uniquely different. The spirits look almost exactly the same but with different masks. Each location although foresty has its individual look and feel. Definitely a good looking game. I played it on my 4K tv and the resolution defaulted to that. (When you first log in the game sets the resolution to your systems max even if you do not want it to.)

The game is definitely not hard to beat and ranges from 4 to 9 hours to play depending on how many achievements you want. One thing to note is the abundance of game references and items from other games throughout the island. The dialong is quirky and not meant to be taken seriously. 

If you want a simple game that does require a little bit of action, this is a good game to get.",1433217023,1433217023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+ Item shop.

Man k√∂nnte k√ºrzer spielen, wenn man sich nicht alle interessanten Upgrades leisten will, oder etwas l√§nger, wenn man alle Achievements und den besten Highscore bei jedem der 50 ""Gegner"" durch Rematches erreichen m√∂chte. 

Worum geht's? Die junge Protagonistin Lili erforscht eine Insel zu botanischen Zwecken, mutiert aber schnell zur Probleml√∂serin der Bewohner. Auf Geos leben h√∂lzerne beseelte Konstrukte, die von ""Spirits"", lebenden Pflanzenwesen, erschaffen wurden, und nun nicht nur kontrolliert, sondern auch regelrecht versklavt, manchmal sogar gemobbt werden. 

Es gilt nun mehreres zu tun: 
* nach und nach die vier Stadtviertel zu erschlie√üen und zu erkunden, inklusive zun√§chst verschlossener R√§ume, in denen sich fast immer Truhen mit (insgesamt 50) sammelbaren ""Artefakten"" (Alltagsgegenst√§nden oder Spielzeug) befinden
* mehrere Quests f√ºr die Konstrukte zu erledigen, die manchmal zum Schmunzeln anregen. Es sollen 45 individuelle NPCs sein, aber es vergeben leider nicht alle von ihnen Auftr√§ge, ein paar sind auch sehr kurz und simpel. F√ºr meinen Geschmack h√§tte es jedenfalls ruhig deutlich mehr und l√§ngere Quests geben k√∂nnen ;)
* es gilt auch Blumen sowie M√ºnzen zu sammeln, womit man sich Hilfsitems, Outfits und Upgrades leisten kann
* zudem bis zu 50 Spirits zu jagen und besiegen (es besteht aber kein Zwang, wirklich alle bis zum letzten zu bezwingen) 
* und nat√ºrlich den Hauptqueststrang zu verfolgen, in dem es darum geht, den Tips vom ""Trainer""-Konstrukt zu folgen, wobei Lili wahlweise die drei verf√ºgbaren Skills gesteigert bekommt (bis auf zwei Slots, soda√ü man sich aussuchen kann, auf was man am ehesten verzichten kann), und nat√ºrlich zu guter Letzt die Konstrukte aus der Kontrolle der Spirits zu befreien (n√§mlich durch letztendliches Ausschalten des Kontrollturms)

Die Spirits werden ""bek√§mpft"", indem 
* Lili die vor ihr automatisch fliehenden Spirits verfolgt (und Rauchbomben ausweicht, die die Spirits werfen) 
* oder sich auch mal an sie anschleicht (was durch Items erleichtert wird)
* dann durch Tastaturbefehl schnell auf ihren R√ºcken springt 
* und dort angekommen den Spirits mit Mausbewegungen Blumen aus den K√∂pfen rupft, die die Spirits sprie√üen lassen (oder auch mal Rauchbomben oder Dornen)
* das Pfl√ºcken will jeweils in einer gewissen Zeitspanne erledigt sein, in der sich Lili auf dem R√ºcken der Spirits festhalten kann (durch Items verl√§ngerbar), und es sind durch Geschick mehr oder weniger Punkte/Highscores erreichbar (m√∂glichst auf die wei√üen Blumen konzentieren!)

Und das war's eigentlich auch schon. 

Die Spielwelt - ein kleiner Strand, die vier Stadtviertel mit ihrem Stra√üennetz und jeweils mehreren betretbaren H√§usern plus kleinen Verbindungsg√§ngen - ist nicht riesig, aber auch nicht allzu winzig und ausreichend abwechslungsreich. Es mangelt an freier Erkundungsfl√§che (haupts√§chlich sind es ja Stra√üen), und man kann auch schon mal mit der Figur in einem Winkel steckenbleiben, aber das Spiel zu beenden und wieder einzusteigen l√∂st solche Probleme. 

Jedes Mal, wenn man in ein anderes Stadtviertel wechselt, sprie√üen dort haupts√§chlich am Rande der Stra√üen neue wei√üe Blumen zum Sammeln (und Verkaufen), aber auch Vasen mit M√ºnzen, und eigentlich mu√ü man die nicht mal ""grinden"", um auch ganz nebenbei im Verlauf des Spiels - wirklich ""im Vor√ºbergehen"" - zu genug Geld f√ºr die wichtigsten kampferleichternden Upgrades, zur hilfreichen Karte und einem Universal-Schl√ºssel zu gelangen.

Vor allem die Musik hat es mir sehr angetan, die macht wirklich Laune und ich k√∂nnte sie mir jeden Tag anh√∂ren :)

[b][u]Summary[/u][/b]
Lili is out sailing to find the island of Geos which is for whatever reason super rare to find. She finds the island and plans on collecting flower samples from the island. The island consists of wooden constructs and spirits. The constructs are essentially ill treated slaves and only Lili can help because your a human. Thus your goal is finish your school project by grabbing onto the mean spirits and... deflower them. As Lili runs around grabbing and deflowering male/female spirits she also collects things. You can buy stuff at the shop as well. You also level up your grab, stealth, and speed skills.

[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]
The art style is amazingly fun and colorful. The pull flowers mini game is actually quite fun considering how simple it is. The music and characters are quite lovely as well. More then anything this game just has that casual goofy fun vibe going for it.

[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]
It doesn't have actual speech in the conversations. It advertises itself as a Legend of Zelda when it play more like a Animal Crossing slash flower picking similulator. I would also say that the game suffers from being to simple. You'll be left feeling that the game could have been a legend of zelda if they would have tried for it. The game tends to shove video game references and trivia down your throat.

Its a casual fun game. Don't go in expecting a grand 3D platformer because this is just a phone game on steroids.

I played with a 360 controller and the hit detection for collecting items was a bit unforgiving at times, but I'm guessing that isn't the case for keyboard/mousers. That was my only real issue with this game.

At the start of the game, I'm struck by it beautiful visual. Lili Child of Geos is one of the best beautiful visual game that i have ever played.

In this game, you'll be playing as Lili. A student of weird botanical major that exploring the island of geos to find a good speciment of flower. Like all of klise game out there, while in there, she became a hero that freed the citizen from the evil mayor.

The story of the game is not one that you will remember. The quest and the level system are really bland.

The only thing I like is the game visual, and the refreshness of the minigame and unique character found in the island.

The game started as an iOS game, to developer BitMonster's credit, the PC release has end of improvements, to the graphics and gameplay. However, you still get the inkling its not that far removed from its iOS origins.

[b]Pros[/b]
Funny, beutiful, and unique coming of age story that is generally fun.
Lots of collectibles with plenty of pop-culture nods and winks

[b]Cons[/b] 
Combat gets tedious quickly, achievements are very grindy.
Bit too easy, a bit too simple.

[b]Overall[/b]
Considering the time it takes to play through, I'm not sure its worth the price (¬£15). It may sound a wee bit elitist but Lili: Child of Geos is just the type of ""casual"" game you'd expect from something designed for iOS. Last word, it's fun enough if you want something pretty, amusing and simple to chill with.

TL;DR:
Go on youtube and watch a video of this game actually being played before you buy it. If you still think you want it, go ahead, but don't say you weren't warned.

The graphics are beautiful, the world is beautiful, the character and object designs are really nice, and there's even a hint of a decent plot in there. So where did it go wrong?

When it comes down to it, this 'game' is pretty much a flower-picking simulator. You can have as many textures, shaders and polygons as you like but when your core gameplay consists of picking flowers off the backs of tree sprites, you have a problem. Had this been a 3D visual novel or a point and click I'd probably be able to give it a straight thumbs up, but I just cannot get over that fact that this game's core 'gameplay' element is flower picking. People compare this to Zelda, but it's nothing like Zelda, there's exploration but there's no real puzzle element to it, no tools or weapons - just free roaming, talking and flower picking.

I get the impression that this 'game' was made by a 3D modeller to show off their work rather than someone who makes video games. This is one of the massive downsides of modern game making tools, anyone with next to no experience in making games can create a game, but because they don't have experience it falls very far from the 'masterpiece' they are dreaming of. It's like a paint brush, in the hand of an artist it creates masterpieces, in the hand of a child it makes a mess. This is almost the opposite of that - give a 3D artist the tools to make a game and they create a beautiful work in which not much happens. This game proves definitively that games should be and are much more than just good graphics.

I can't bear too much of a grudge because I got it on sale for about ¬£3, but I feel like this 'game' is something designed to sit down and gaze at lovingly rather than actually be played. Whoever did the art for this game is definately a true artist, even better than the artists for lots of popular, well selling titles. But whoever came up with the gameplay should either spend a long time evaluating what they think games are about or just not be allowed to manage gameplay at all. 

All in all it's pretty tragic really, because this game could have been a real masterpiece. Instead it just leaves me with a very empty feeling, somewhere between admiration and regret, like a beautiful rose being picked before it could bloom or a promising young life cut short thanks to a tragic accident.",1428814284,1428814284,False,74,2,0.693198323249816895,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is definitely a game for those people who love to get to every chest and go through every door. There's some cute hats, masks and outfits to collect too.

I have only two cons for the game. First, if you see the cute flying french bulldog in the banner? Apparently they took the dog away for newer buyers of the game. I obviously didn't buy the game just for the dog, but it was still disappointing (and throws the term ""complete edition"" into question). Second, there were a few loose ends left unresolved, so that feeling of completion was marred a bit by a few unanswered questions. I also got the impression from some of the dialog that this is a sequel to another game, but I don't think it is?

The concept seems rather boring, but put some quirky characters, interesting world design and beautiful visuals on the mix and thus is born [i]Lili: Child of Geos[/i]! A mixture of [i]Yume Nikki[/i] and [i]FEZ[/i] on a 3D environment, Lili's journey to complete her degree in something quite close to botany is not only a banquet for the sight, but also an entertaining non-violent alternative to not-always-so-subtle gaming references and somewhat-intelligent humor. However, as most indie games that try to inovate, the title has remarkable flaws or raw concepts.

The story is not impressive or captivating, but the funny and varied cast of characters sure compensate to what could be a dull, uninspiring experience with a cute message that didn't stick because the road to it was so ""meh"". Although the game has no voice overs (despite a few heys, yep and ""SOUP, SOUP SOUP!""), the dialogues flow smoothly, soon making you feel like you know the pers... no... construct you're talking to.

Gameplay-wise, there's not much on store. First, there is no such thing as full controller support (if you want to play with a controller, that is) as the store page implies. This is actually a [b]partial controller support[/b] where you'll get to use the analog sticks to move the mouse cursor on menus and get XBox controller inputs only during the ""fights"", making you get used to how 1, 2 and 3 translate on an XBox controller or simply use the keyboard when those item slots are necessary. After the early struggle, you'll soon find that the only interesting thing about the game is its ""unique"" way to deal with enemies -- which is actually a far more simplistic and fast paced [i]Shadow of the Colossus[/i], but with smaller enemies. Simply put, you jump on their backs and try to cope with a swarm of commands indicating where you can pull flowers, thorns or bombs, carefully not to dry the ""grip"" matter as that will make you fall off the enemy. With a decent score you get to collect that enemy's unique mask and learn about it. Other than that, running (walking is exclusive to houses), collecting flowers and the few RPG elements are clunky and raw. There was a lot of room for improvement, but clearly the developers wanted to seel a gorgeous game with that one fresh feature that you won't even get to play that much.

Speaking of features, content is another thing [i]Lili: Child of Geos[/i] lacks. There are no puzzles at all, unless the game giving you the answer to stepping on buttons is considered a puzzle now days. For an exploration game with no actual combat, puzzles could make the experience far more enjoyable! The world layout is entertaining, but soon falls flat as the areas are pretty much narrowed corridors without much places to go. No no dear, you cannot jump or swim to anywhere you want to explore -- not that there are many places you think you could jump to anyways. You won't have to work much to get the god-mode items (e.g. the skeleton key and the treasure map), either, so instead of having the slightest hint of challenge on a casual exploration game (because even though it's casual, doesn't mean it can't be challenging), you can just keep running, collecting flowers, kicking vases and collecting flowers from the back of spirits. As for the outfits and hats, considering how short the game is and how useless they are (only there for cosmetics and eventually some lore relevance), there could be a larger variety -- like letting us use the Mario collectable hat as an actual hat instead of hinting on a reference-NPC that doesn't even exist.

[list]
    [*] Gorgeous graphics
    [*] Runs smoothly at highest settings on a medium rig
    [*] Interesting designs
    [*] Quirky, funny characters
    [*] Nice music
    [*] Some subtle and funny references to the gaming world
    [*] An exploration game with few RPG elements and a weak focus on flower collecting

[u][b]Cons:[/b][/u]
[list]
    [*] Partial controller support instead of full
    [*] Gameplay feels clunky at times
    [*] No puzzles
    [*] The only inovative mechanic is uninteresting and might become a burden if you're not a fast catcher
    [*] There could be more hats
    [*] There could be more pets
    [*] Flowers could be more relevant
    [*] There could be more items and shops
    [*] Some game references feel stupid (if I can call the Portal 2 thing a reference)
    [*] Extremely linear considering what an open world can offer
    [*] Extremely short considering the potential it had (you can clear the game and most of the achievments on a single day, maybe two if you decide to take on the 1000 vases and flowers)
[/list]

All in all, [i]Lili: Child of Geos[/i] is a funny one-time experience with a lot of wasted potential. Gorgeous graphics and funny characters, but poor controller support (considering the developers promised full support), lack of content and short playthrough.

Very minimal combat, and mostly a game of tag that ends in a flower picking minigame.  I certainly think their intended audience was children, with the tone and major gameplay mechanics.

Lili: Child of Geos is hard to categorise. It‚Äôs not an RPG, adventure game or a walking simulator‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs more of an exploration game with heavy emphasis on item collecting (hence why people call it a flower picking simulator). With some adventure elements in the mix, including ‚Äúfights‚Äù, which are actually simple minigames.

Don‚Äôt let the simple gameplay fool you though. Lili is an engaging game about exploring the world of friendly wood constructs and helping them out with their requests. (This usually involves gathering some items or ‚Äúfighting‚Äù an enemy.) It‚Äôs not a community simulator like the Animal Crossing series, but has some similarities, including the same non-violent, relaxing charm.

Technically it was ported from iOS, but the only thing that may give it away is the very simple control scheme; the developer practically remade the whole game for PC, which includes astonishing, yet not intrusive visuals‚Äì all presented by the Unreal 3 engine‚Äì and brand new game elements. It is a version made with love (which sadly doesn‚Äôt extend to provide support for technical issues), and if you start playing it, you will feel that love too.",1426579879,1426579879,True,4,0,0.577334761619567871,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The first thing you'll notice about Lili: Child of Geos is the absolutely stunning visual aspect. The world is rich and vibrant, with colours and structures that are nothing less than a joy to take in; from a crumbled and dilapidated residence to a light and woodsy forest, the visual design of this game is a real treat. 

The next thing that sticks out is the simplicity of it all. Lili runs about collecting flowers as they spring up for use as currency to purchase upgrades which make the main task of the game a bit easier. Essentially, you chase down an enemy, leap onto it, and hold on as you race against your own fading strength to collect a rare flower from it, furthering your progress in the game.

Finally, you'll notice the life in the game. L:CoG has you playing a likeable character amidst a cast of silly and quirky personalities who really bring this world to life. From a heartfelt postman with an odd way of delivering letters to an out-of-place group of spirits bent on destruction, there's so much to discover in the conversations with people alone, even though some of them are more than you bargained for (such as a photographer who stalks you or a woman who serves cannibalistic soup). In some cases, the storytelling can be surprisingly subtle [spoiler](Towards the end of the game, you can see a pair of glasses at the top of a tower, hinting that Lili's father had possibly visited previously)[/spoiler] or even a bit powerful [spoiler](such as the dismantling of your mentor or the creepy and sinister feel of the Mayor.)[/spoiler].

Rife with secrets and easter eggs such as a knockoff Master Sword and an E-tank lying about in a house, my experience was nothing short of satisfying. Lili: Child of Geos harkens back to the late nineties/early aughts, before ""collect-a-thon"" was a derogatory term. It revives in me a feeling of nostalgia for Spyro and Crash Bandicoot but also the wonder of a new experience, and for all of that, I sing its praises. L:CoG is not a long game, by any means, but it is an experience that I highly recommend.",1426545496,1426545496,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

This game is fun, and it is very polished, BUT it spends way too much time reminding you that it was inspired by better games.

The majority of the 'items' that you collect in the game are unusable, often refences to other games, only visible in your inventory screen, and far more exciting than any of the actual usable items you will receive.

The game is packed with arbitrarily placed invisible walls. Especially the first couple of areas. They've designed and built an exquisite world for this game, and then decided that they don't want you to actually explore it. You can't walk through a lot of bushes, jump on walls, walk down the beach, climb on roofs, or even go down some passageways. I honestly don't understand what the decision process was during this whole thing. Beautiful environment that is begging to have every exquisite inch explored, climbed on, and jumped over, but no you need to walk on the path.

The enemies are unchallenging and repetitive. Not really a bad thing, because you spend so much time doing other stuff, but... well, it is a bad thing. It's definitely a weak point. It's not good. I at first thought that it was because it was targetted at children, but my friends kids (5 and 7) also think the enemies are too easy.

It is crazy short for what you're paying. I cleared it in about 5hrs, and then spent about an hour looking for other, secret, things to do, but didn't find anything.

After all of that, I am recommending it, because I enjoyed playing it. I like this game, and I want them to fix it, make a sequel, and keep making games.",1426090221,1426090221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are no lives, no health, if a bad guy throws you off like a bucking bronko then you just dust yourself off and try again. 

The story plays out like an old cartoon, fun but full of holes. The characters are intresting to look at and some of the comments got a giggle but don't look for actual depth behind them, the game is incredable to look at and I could spend all day just looking around enjoying the sights, just wish a game that focused so much on exploreing gave us more to explore. I felt like just when I was geting into it, it was over. 

If your looking for a silly family firendly game to kill a few hours then this is worth checking out as a nice breath of fresh air, though you might want to tone down the settings a bit as its a bit intensive unless you on a gameing system.

La idea original no es mala en absoluto, aunque est√° poco desarrollada y es tremendamente absurda. Lili, una estudiante, de Vegi-magia necesita recoger flores ex√≥ticas en la isla de geos para su proyecto final. En la isla descubre que las flores crecen en la espalda de unos abusivos y malintencionados espiritus que han implantado un sistema de apartheid oprimiendo a otros seres llamados constructos. As√≠ que Lili tiene la doble tarea de recoger estas flores y libertar a los constructos, saltando a la espalda de los espiritus y arrancandoles flores.

Este ""saltar sobre la espalda y arrancar flores"" sustituye de forma relativamente pacifica a una resoluci√≥n violenta de conflictos, lo cual es algo original y la din√°mica es divertida y con una dificultad creciente, y aunque en un juego normal solo he fallado una √∫nica vez a la hora de intentarlo, tiene cierta complicaci√≥n conseguirlo perfectamente a la primera en cada espiritu. 

Graficamente es muy colorista y suave, me recuerda al majora's mask, con lo que estoy encantado con este apartado. 

Mis pegas se centrar√≠an sobre todo en el hecho de que es un juego tremendamente corto y no excesivamente complicado. Solo unas 4 horas de juego para conseguir todas las busquedas y un sistema de logros que te invita a recolectar objetos sin parar cuando no hay absolutamente ninguna complicaci√≥n para encontrarlos. Se echa en falta algo m√°s de diversidad en las din√°micas de juego, lo de arrancar flores de los espiritus se queda algo soso enseguida, podr√≠an haber implementado otras formas de luchar contra los espiritus sin necesidad de recurrir a la violencia, pero que aportasen alguna variaci√≥n. En definitiva, el juego carece de complicaci√≥nes imprevistas lo que quiz√°s, a√±adido a sus graficos coloristas sugerir√≠an un target infantil, ¬øcierto? error, y en eso se basa mi segunda queja.

Lili est√° -en mi opinion- sobresexualizada. El juego hace dolorsamente obvio que no es una ni√±a a pesar de su aspecto ani√±ado y hay momentos (escasos, aunque bastante incomodos) en los que se alude implicitamente a su atractivo fisico como intentando vender el personaje como una ""waifu"" o amor platonico para jugadores masculinos (o mujeres gays si os gustan lo videojuegos, gui√±o, gui√±o). No os tomeis est√° acusaci√≥n como criterio para jugar o no el juego ya que se basa completamente en mis sensaciones, pero s√≠ que diria que ""Lili: Child of Geos"" se ha dise√±ado con un publico adulto en mente por estas razones, y el juego es, como he dicho antes, un pel√≠n demasiado simple para un p√∫blico adulto.

Est√° en ingl√©s, lo cual es una pega si es que eso te supone un impedimento.",1424524715,1424524715,True,1,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False,False,,,

That's not a bad thing. In fact, I'm glad that kids these days can be introduced to gaming with such charming experiences.
That being said, ""Lili"" isn't exactly non-violent. While the most brutal thing you do is pluck a flower from a tree creature's back, there's a strong sense that the confrontations are very personal. The tree creatures end up being humilliated, though not mutilated.

""Lili"" is charming, pretty, and, surprisingly, funny. The humour here works, in large part because the writer wasn't trying too hard. It's exactly the kind of slightly absurdist affair with affinity for randomness that I remember enjoying a lot back when I was 15.

What ""Lili"" is not is a deep game. The environments are pretty, but they're not ""explorable"", in the sense that you can look behind a corner and sometimes even find some secret stash, but you won't find this activity very compelling. There's no emergent narrative to it. The game's main collectible and currency, namely flowers, feels like a wasted opportunity. There's only one variety of flower and you never need to do anything specific in order to find them, because they just grow everywhere. I was kind of hoping that I was going to build a collection of unique specimens, but that's not the case.

I played this game with mouse and keyboard, and in this configuration it's more difficult than it would be on a tablet. During encounters with the tree creatures, the ones that have flowers growing from their backs, plucking a flower requires a mouse gesture rather than a click. This is fine on its own, but mouse gestures are slower and more awkward than their touch screen counterparts, and the timing doesn't seem to have been adjusted. As a result the minigame feels more difficult than it should be.",1423940807,1423940807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Too much to slap you with a witty pair of sentences and run away giggling.  So here's some proper paragraphs for you kids as I lead you on a bold coming-of-age adventure where you learn to part with three to five of your dollars but no more than that; an adventure where you learn if great art direction with a bit of humor can make up for some flawed gameplay and a very basic story:

You will take control of Lili: a young crossdressing botanist with daddy issues on a quest to ""deflower"" a population of anthropomorphic gardens.  Okay, okay.  That is only technically true, you cheeky reviewer, you.  It's a very inclusive, cheerfully bright, and quite original game, although the daddy issues still stand.  And in fact they stand in the way of me giving this game an unqualified recommendation.  

I'm talking not about Lili the character, but the game itself.  It is so proud of its roots that it spends too much time placing them on display rather than nurturing its uniqueness to blossom into a memorable classic.  Lili brings a lot to the table, but what's ultimately going to keep you playing (or not) are its story, characters, and setting.  Lili: CoG tries to follow the likes of games like Monkey Island by having a story-focused game supported by a strong sense of humor.  The story itself is unchallenging, boiling down to: bad guys are bad guys and it's up to you to put things right.  Bless it, it tries to do more by giving Lili a personal dilemma that comes into conflict with her objectives, but when it comes time for her to choose, there's really no consequence to the choice you make.  Although, I guess we can hand out a gold star for at least letting the player make a choice.   

Okay, so the story is middling, what does this have to do with that whole roots/blossoming/flower-metaphors-for-a-game-about-flowers  line you were banging on about?  Well, presumably if the story is lacking, it could be supported by its humor.  And the game has some wonderfully funny moments.  Unfortunately, you might just stop playing before you ever get to them.  A lot of the jokes in the first areas of the game you explore take the form of references to other games and the games industry, and praise toward the games that inspired Lili.  And, as many of us know, references aren't really jokes, especially since you have to have a pretty broad knowledge of games to appreciate most of them.  I did get a grin or two out of these, but it wasn't until the second half of the game when the earnest chuckles came; when Lili started being Lili instead of her various daddies' girl.

I know anybody reading the length of this review is probably ready with their metaphorical throwing produce if I don't get to talking about the gameplay soon, but this is a very hippy-dippy, rainbow colored, mostly non-violent, interactive experience and there's a bit more to be said.  This game.  Is.  Beautiful.  No, really, it is.  The birds even poop rainbows!!!  It could sell itself alone on its art direction (it's a shame it comes a bit too close to doing that).  Without an army of artists and polygons, Lili creates a vivid, bright, painterly world that is going to stay good looking for decades.  The environments feel very open, engaging, and wholely Lili's own.  Lili is a realistically proportioned human exploring a luminous world populated by wooden robots and grim-looking masked spirits none of which are short on personality.  It's got a bit of a Miyazaki vibe to it, but it's ultimately Lili's own world, and it's truly charming.  

Right, gameplay.  In Lili, you chase down spirits, jump onto their backs, and try to yank off the flowers that sprout up with your mouse, while avoiding hazards that threaten to knock you off and let the spirit escape: interesting, arcadey, surprisingly challenging as the difficulty ramps up.  It's refreshingly different from many other adventure/action/RPG hybrids that will mostly have you swinging a sword around at the things you want maimed.  It isn't quite perfect, though.  It works okay with mouse controls, but does feel imprecise at times and can get a bit frustrating when the things you want appear in dense clusters of hazards.  It seems designed with touch screens in mind, but I only used the mouse, so I can't comment on that implementation.  

The RPG elements, especially, seem misguided.  Upgrades are handed out at odd intervals and never seem essential, especially with items providing boosts that don't so much compliment your skills in running fast, stealth, and hanging onto enemies, as render them completely irrelevant.  The increments from leveling up and getting items aren't entirely unnoticeable, but the RPG elements could have gotten cut and nothing would have been lost.  In fact, the stealth aspect to the game is really non-existant.  You won't have to worry about things like which way the enemy is facing, what cover you place yourself behind, or the amount of lighting on you.  Stealth is merely a stat that determines how close you can get before the enemy automatically notices you.  If stealth games really turn you on, as they do me, just know that this isn't a stealth game, but a perfectly fine arcadey affair.  And, you know, you can just have a stealth-sandwhich and be invisible, so why the stats at all? 

I'll admit, I only played the game on normal difficulty.  The game does have easy and hard settings, but as an adult with adequate reflexes, I found Lili to be fairly easy to get through, but challenging to get through well (you are scored for each enemy you face and given a small reward in the form of a mask for doing well).  I'd say that makes it ideal, but then, I'm not sure exactly who this game was made for.  The simple saccharine story and visuals make it seem like a casual game for parents to play with their children, though I think even with an easy setting, reflex challenges might prove inherently difficult for younger kids.  But if it's just meant to appeal to the children of the 90s, now present day indie gamers, the difficulty is on the ball in terms of gameplay.  That audience will probably find the story a bit too easy, however (unless you want to get meta and compare Lili - the character's - struggle living in her father's shadow to Lili - the game's - struggle to emerge from the shadow of monumental games like a terribly clever gamer whose review will be super influential).

So who is Lili for?  Well, me, I guess.  I mostly enjoyed it and I recommend it if you think the strengths I've just beamed into your head outweigh the bits that are mediocre - and those bits are just mediocre, never really bad.",1423223082,1423223082,True,1,2,0.500907480716705322,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is a very colorful are open game and great graphics and visuals. It is a great breathtaking game , now the story is short and sweet and has a nice feeling tone to it not much of it to be honest. The camera controlls are great controller works dandy and the only thing I can complain about are two little things. One the voice acting , there is none just text speach followed by a voice of that person. Well if you already made that person make a noise or say ""Hay"" followed by a few other voice commands why not just finish up the whole dam thing. I mean that game is shorter than the chat dialogs so there were some loss of effort that is clear to see. Now last the music , very well put in and done , but there is only one whole song set into this game. Either that or I cannot tell because they are more same sounding than nickleback. Seriously I wish this game had diffrent tone settings on music and it lasted more than 10 mins Its like hearing your favorite bands most played to songs over and over a few times.

Con un acabado gr√°fico muy bonito y colorido, unos personajes bastante curiosos y una buena banda sonora, el juego nos invita a recorrer junto a Lili, una estudiante de bot√°nica, la extra√±a isla de Geos, desentra√±ar sus misterios y ayudar a sus habitantes, los Constructos, frente a sus creadores, los Esp√≠ritus.

El juego es una aventura en tercera persona. En √©l, tomamos el control de una adolescente llamada Lili, la cual toma tierra con su bote en la isla de Geos. Lili es estudiante de bot√°nica, y ha venido a la isla a estudiar las extra√±as flores que crecen en ella. Pero cual es su sorpresa cuando, al llegar, se empieza a encontrar con unas criaturas de lo mas extra√±as, formadas por madera y piedra, que se hacen llamar Constructos. Al parecer, en la isla moran unos seres llamados Esp√≠ritus, los cuales crearon a los Constructos para hacerles las tareas mas pesadas. Lo malo es que los Esp√≠ritus tratan a los Constructos muy mal, y ah√≠ es donde Lili, sin comerlo ni beberlo, se ve encumbrada como la liberadora de los Constructos del yugo de sus creadores.

Para ello, el juego cuenta con 4 zonas diferenciadas en las hay muchos personajes por conocer, misiones por hacer y secretos que encontrar. A lo largo del juego, adem√°s, nos ir√°n apareciendo Esp√≠titus a los que hay que ir derrotando mediante pulso y habilidad.

No hay sangre en este juego, ni muertes, ni acci√≥n explosiva. ""Lili"" es un juego tranquilo y ameno, un cuento, en el que lo que cuenta es disfrutar de sus paisajes y de su banda sonora, y dejarse llevar. No es un Zelda, o un Tomb Raider. No espereis grandes puzzles, terribles secretos o temibles enemigos. ""Lili"" es un juego sencillo para evadirse un rato de los malos rollos del mundo. Y punto.

La unica pega que le puedo ver es que no est√© traducido al espa√±ol. Para darle mas duraci√≥n, han metido bastantes logros. Y dentro del juego hay varias cosas que hacer que llevar√°n su tiempo, como consegir vencer a todos los esp√≠tius con 3 estrellas, encontrar todos los cofres ocultos o, los mas pesados, recoger 1000 flores o romper 1000 vasijas.

Quizas su precio sea algo elevado para lo que puede ofrecer a los jugadores habituales de PC, ya que apenas presentar√° grandes retos salvo acabar la aventura y poco mas. Con una rebaja, lo recomiendo, sobre todo para gente a la que le guste las aventuras sin complicaciones, lo quieran para sus hijos, o quieran olvidarse de la violencia gratuita por un rato.

Y bueno...  Lili es adorable...  que le vamos a hacer.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You follow Lili on an expedition where she ends up on a misterious island ruled by an evil mayor. PRetty standard child fantasy fare.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Graphics are the best part of Lili Child of Geos. They're gorgeous cartoony graphics and make this a nice game to take some screenshots.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay is pretty easy though it's obviously meant to be a tap game, especially when you're on the back of boss creatures. You mostly explore and grab collectibles otherwise. The menus are awkward to use and the controls were clearly adapted at the last minute, making them clunky. 

[h1]Sound[/h1]
Nothing to write home about but the voice acting is kinda cute.

[h1]Other[/h1]
The game is packed with multiple geeky references which give the player a cheeky wink. We both know you'd rather be playing those other games. There is also no tutorial telling you how to play the game so hope you can find it out on your own.

You play Lili, of course, a young student who arrives on a thought-to-be deserted island in search of flowers.  Once there, you discover that a race of beings called Constructs are working as slaves for vicious little critters called Spirits.  Naturally, you'll battle the Spirits, free the Constructs, do a little soul-searching, and save the day.

The gameplay is charming, but fairly limited.  You'll walk around, talk to people, do fetch quests, and fight Spirits in what are essentially QTE mini-games.  You jump on their backs and pluck all of their flowers out, avoiding thorns and shedding bombs as you go.  Defeated Spirits merely run off in a huff; everything is very non-violent and kid appropriate.  There's also a gambling mini-game that is fun for a few spins.

Sadly, there isn't much story to tie it all together.  It's clear that the evil Mayor will be the Big Bad from the get-go, so not much mystery there.  Lili's only real drama is whether or not to abandon the Constructs to turn in her project on time, and I doubt anyone will be very confounded on which path to choose.  Lili will also exchange letters with her professor that hint at some deeper family trauma at play, but it's only brought up at the very end of the game and nothing much is said of it.  Exploring that a little further might have added some real heart to the game and made it feel a bit more substantial.

Of course, many of the game's shortcomings can be traced to its origins as a smartphone app, with an emphasis on sharp graphics and simplistic gameplay.  Make no mistake, the game is quite beautiful, but the transition from app to Steam product was less than ideal.  The game feels a bit unpolished all over, and the achievements are a total mess - some are bugged, others pop up erroneously, and many are tedious grinds which are completely inessential to clearing the game.  The game was perfectly playable on my end and didn't crash, but the whole thing felt rushed.

And yet, with all that said, I'll give the game a mild thumbs up.  It's nice to see a family appropriate game on Steam, especially with a female protagonist.  It looks great, has pleasant tunes, and the writing can be quite funny in places.  You can tell that the adult writers were slipping in a ton of gags to either amuse themselves or any parents nearby.  It all goes down easy and most people will get a few hours of fun out of it.  That said, I got the game for 85% off - I wouldn't pay anything close to the base price of $20 for it.

(Well, almost everything.)

But seriously, I'm not sure where to begin. The game is gorgeous, for starters. Don't be deterred by the fact that it was previously a mobile iOS game -- Lili: Child of Geos is a complete overhaul, and even playing on the lowest graphical setting I found myself just looking around in awe half the time. Everything about Lili's world is memorable, from the world design to the characters. There's a lot of wonderful dialogue and description text, and finding all of it feels like its own reward.

The gameplay is light, but clever. While exploring the world, you kick vases, pick flowers, and open chests, but more importantly, you chase down jerkface spirits so you can leap on their backs, yank out all their spirit flowers, and wear their masks in mockery. The whole thing is oddly relaxing and occasionally reminiscent of Fruit Ninja. But it was also the place that, for me, the controls fell down a bit, None of the control schemes available felt all that functional to me. On some spirits I'd effortlessly pick all the necessary flowers in a few seconds, but on others I found myself desperately grabbing at the same flower over and over, my clicks never connecting. I should also note that achievements seem buggy; I was occasionally awarded achievements I didn't actually earn.

But all in all, I adored the game world and the characters, and I really liked the innovative approach to dealing with enemies! Lili: Child of Geos oozes personality, and it's a game that I'm sure I'll keep coming back to for a good laugh.",1422601729,1423376505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The graphics are cartoony and totally my taste. The story itself is worth playing and has funny parts (So don't skip conversations).
This game would be better if it wasn't that easy to get coins. Bought Master Key which opens EVERY door in the game for a silly cheap price and all the key exploring fun was gone.
It isn't worth playing it a secound time. But that one time playing was totally fun.
Currently I'm having 3.8 hrs on this game. Probably going for the Achievements now.

Bad Points first tho: the actual Story is pretty short. After 4H of playing I have completed the main story and unlocked every Item, got 3 stars on every enemy and completed every single side-quest.

Now going on with the good points: I love the aesthetics; not too realistic with a little cartoony, handdrawn look to it. Some good athmospheric light effects as well as good shader technology. The map is really well designed, with love to every detail. Also the character models are always unique characters, with effort and creativity put into everyone (except the Spirits, they always look the same, just the Mask differs), while you gotta say that those squeaky voices got a littly annoying after a while. Also the main character, Lili, has a well thought-out character and a athmosphere fitting look. The gameplay mechanics are also something new and nice to experience aswell as easy to learn. I've got to mention the native controller support the developers have put into the game (It's often overlooked by indie studios) is also a good job and easy to work with. Aside from all this, even the dialogues are written incredibly well and are always fitting, sometimes funny, and very entertaining ( some spelling issues in items' descriptions :/ ).

Especially on sale, totally worth its money.

Before you go, always remember that there are TONS of video Game references or direct Links in the whole game. Try to find and understand them all!

[*]l'humour et la gaiet√©

It is a game that children and adults (channel your inner child adults!) can play and enjoy.
[u]Graphics[/u]: When the graphics are set on 'Fantastic', which is the highest value, the game is gorgeous. The view of the island itself is magnificent and the lighting in-game makes the entire game seem somehow enchanted and magical.
[u]Storyline[/u]: The storyline is pretty simplistic and one should not expect a complex and in-depth storyline from this game. The plot itself is that you are Lili, a botanist and student sent to the supposedly 'uninhabited' island of Geos to collect samples of flowers to bring back home for your research project. However, you find that the island is not empty and that there are creatures (constructs and spirits and many others) of a different variety. 
[u]Gameplay[/u]: As you read in the upper section that Lili is a botanist, you may assume that you will pick flowers throughout the game. Yes, you are correct! You will be picking countless of flowers, breaking vases, talking to goofy individuals, scaring birds, finding items, and fighting spirits (yes, you will pick the flowers off of their backs!). You should not expect a hack-and-slash style or a difficult puzzle from this game.
[u]Humor[/u]: This game is hilarious. If you actually take your time (like I did) and talk to everyone and read everything, it turns out that our heroine is a gamer! And there are Zelda and Super Mario references (and many more) throughout the game as well as things and topics that would be considered 'inappropriate' are slightly implied so that if your children are playing it, they will not understand. If you are playing it (an adult), you will laugh your butt off!

Overall, I truly enjoyed this game. No, it is not difficult but it is hilarious. It is a relatively short game (I would say approximately 3-5 hours if you don't take time to look at anything, read anything at all, explore, or do side quests), and the only reason I have 9 hours game-time is because I wanted to receive every single achievement (and I also kept going afk while in-game).

Les d√©cors sont idylliques et on a plaisir √† d√©couvrir l'√Æle, malheureusement je n'ai pas accroch√© autant que je l'aurai esp√©r√©. 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=373788118 Premi√®rement le jeu commence tr√®s abruptement, sans aucune cin√©matique pour se mettre dans l'ambiance alors qu'il y aurait eu de quoi en mettre plein les yeux d√®s le d√©part. Ensuite premi√®re difficult√© : les contr√¥les. La jouabilit√© n'est pas g√©niale car les touches ne sont pas reconfigurables et sont faites pour un clavier QWERTY. Le support manette n'est quant √† lui que partiel et il faudra tout de m√™me utiliser le clavier pour l'inventaire ou pour ouvrir le menu.

Pass√© ces probl√®mes de d√©part le manque de doublage nuit √† l'immersion qui est tout de m√™me importante dans un tel jeu, apr√®s je comprends que c'est un jeu ind√©pendant qui n'a pas forc√©ment les moyens de faire appel √† un prestataire externe pour r√©aliser les voix de son jeu.

Le sc√©nario est simple et lin√©aire : dans le r√¥le de Lili on s'aventure sur Geos afin de remplir un devoir de fin d'√©tudes sur les fleurs de l'√Æle. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=373786837 On rencontre alors des √™tres faits de bois appel√©s les ""Constructs"" qui ont √©t√© cr√©√©s par les Spirits afin de les servir. Compatissante √† leur cause, Lili va tenter de mettre un terme au r√®gne des Spirits en affrontant le puissant Maire avec l'aide de son entraineur. 

Au niveau du gameplay on passe beaucoup de temps √† ramasser des items et je me suis vite ennuy√©e parce que cela semblait √™tre le c≈ìur du jeu. Du coup on se balade et on ramasse des choses sans trop savoir pourquoi et on reste distant par rapport √† l'histoire et des personnages. On peut acheter des tenues ou trouver des chapeaux et des compagnons mais rien qui n'ai un int√©r√™t autre qu'esth√©tique. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=373788289 Je ne suis pas √† la recherche d'action √† tout prix mais un peu plus de qu√™tes et surtout des qu√™tes plus int√©ressantes aurait √©t√© un plus.

Les ""combats"" √† base de QTE sont assez simples et c'est l√† qu'est le probl√®me : tout au long du jeu on arrive √† vaincre les Spirits sans trop de difficult√© et √† la fin le Maire est extr√™mement dur √† battre ! Je dirai que c'est mal dos√© √† ce niveau l√†...

Aussi, le bouton qui sert √† tout est assez frustrant, combien de fois ai-je poursuivi un Spirit pour finalement ramasser une fleur ou parler √† un personnage au moment o√π j'allais l'attraper.

Pour r√©sumer c'est un jeu sympathique mais je m'attendais √† un univers plus riche et plus immersif, je suis un peu d√©√ßue mais j'ai tout de m√™me appr√©ci√© le jeu.

There is a bit of a Zelda-esque atmosphere which comes as no surprising seeing all the little Zelda references sprinkled throughout the game. It was refreshing to play a game that was not violent, yet still involved ""beating the bad guys."" So many of the characters you meet are adorable and hilarious, and have succeeded in getting laughs out of both of us. It is worth talking to all of them; they say some of the most ridiculous things. The gameplay centered around a very simple concept: pick flowers, though it was a pleasant surprise to find that it could be still be challenging sometimes. I would easily recommend this game to most of my friends.

Pros:
+ Fun, non-violent gameplay
+ Gorgeous visuals
+ World worth exploring (not overwhelming like big sandbox games)
+ NPCs worth interacting with
+ Nice soundtrack

Cons:
- The aforementioned tasteless jokes (why it is 8/10 and not 10/10. they were pretty gross.)
- Unexpected spike in difficulty between areas/levels.
- Does not clearly state its save mechanism (it's autosave, btw) and does not indicate what triggers a save
- Bit pricey for the length. I wouldn't pay more than ~$12.
- No replay value (one achievement needs ~half a 2nd playthrough but that's it.)

*There are a small handful of instances in which sexual harassment is normalized or made into a joke. Fortunately, they are few and far between, and most are easy enough to ignore and move past, but I can see a couple of the jokes being potentially triggering - especially since you would not see it coming from a game like this (we were very surprised ourselves). None of these jokes are a big piece of the game, but it's enough to make it not an 100% all-ages friendly game. To be more specific,

Esto √∫ltimo me lo he inventado, insensato.
Tambi√©n puedes personalizar el aspecto de Lilly, pero a esta chorrada no le dediqu√© mucho tiempo. M√°s bien, ninguno.
La trama central es que hay una serie de monstruos que van de ac√° para all√° correteando y que son ""los malos"" del juego. Tu deber consiste en capturarlos y arrancarles unas flores de su espalda, y poco a poco ir√°s liberando zonas del mapa.
Todo es muy infantil y on√≠rico, excepto las ganas de violencia extrema cada vez que aparece un habitante del mundo del juego con forma de buz√≥n de correo que lo √∫nico que hace es interrumpir lo que estoy haciendo.
El juego es bastante corto, pero para un cr√≠o que no se va a aclarar mucho le sobra, sobre todo si se va a poner a personalizar a Lilly y ayudar a todos los habitantes busc√°ndoles los objetos que necesitan. Adem√°s, cuando por fin acabas el juego, puedes explorar libremente el mundo.

I got it on sale for under $3 and I suggest everyone do the same.

Pros:

+ GFX are nice
+ The characters are really odd and interesting
+ Has a great charm and there are some cool game references like Zelda and Mega Man
+ Honestly, fun to play
+ The surroundings are really fun to look at
+ I could argue that it is the best casual game I have ever played

Cons:

- Too easy, not challenging at all, you can get a key to open all locked doors at the beginning of the game, the items are useless, I didn't even need to use them
- Moving between areas, the game kind of freezes for two seconds when opening red doors, annoying
- When using a controller, some times the right stick will drift to the left, it can be fixed just by moving the right stick, but I don't think this game was designed to support controllers at first
- Full price for this game is too much, I beat it in 6 hours and got 42/46 achievements, $20 is too much

It's worth picking up on sale, but not for the full price of $20. 

Pros:
- Looks great, especially considering it started on mobile. A lot of that probably comes down to the fact that most levels are cleverly designed to avoid needing to draw more than 20 feet in any direction, but the game does run on Unreal. 
- Usually clever writing. Not perfect by any means, but it's generally entertaining.
- Strong world design. The descriptions comparison to Tim Schafer's work is pretty accurate in the world and character design. 
- The main mini-game is fun. It involves trying to pick flowers off the head of a spirit as it runs around and sprouts bombs and thorns to make you miss. It's reasonably challenging to win the later rounds with a perfect rating, but you're going to breeze through it if just passing is enough for you. Mileage will vary heavily here. 
- Lots of hats. Every spirit (52) and most quests (something like 12?) will give you a hat. There are also at least two pets to find, but the costume changes are limited to palette swaps, unfortunately. 

Cons:
- Very limited graphics options. You get a few presets with no descriptions of what any of them actually do. I don't think many people are going to have trouble running the game, but Highest turns on an incredible level of depth of field. I'd have liked to be able to turn that off. 
- Short. I finished it in 3 hours. That was enough to defeat all 52 spirits (most with 3/3 stars), complete nearly all of the quests, and find around 60-70% of the collectibles. 
- Controls are a bit wonky. Particularly the camera. 

Notes:
- Achievement hunters beware! Lili has a ton of achievements and *most* are near enough to completable in a sane person's playthrough. Then there's ""Break 1,000 vases."" I only got to 120 despite making an effort to break any I came across. You could probably get an extra 100 or so by going out of your way to look for them, but the full 1K is going to take some serious grinding. 
- Trying to play it on a standard touchpad would be a nightmare. 
- The description compares this to Zelda, but the only similarities I can find are some of the humor, Wind Waker's art direction, and the fact that money is completely and utterly useless in both games.

The game has no combat involved. Instead, you encounter evil spirits to be purged by picking flowers from their backs. It's a mini game that was intended for tablets and phones, but still translates decently to mouse controls and is easy to pick up. Various challenges are thrown in when picking the flowers, like prickly thorns to avoid and timed bombs to fling off. It can be a bit repetitive though as it's the same minigame for each spirit.

M√ºnzen und Blumen sammeln, ""Skillpunkte"" (3 passive F√§higkeiten, die Punkte werden im Spielverlauf freigeschaltet),
ein paar optische Items zu Charakteranpassung, K√§mpfe gibt es auch nicht im eigentlichen Sinne. Eigentlich ein Spiel das in fast jeder Hinsicht nur das mindeste hervorbringt. 

Und doch macht das simple Spielprinzip irgendwie Spa√ü, die Grafik ist recht h√ºbsch, der Stil erinnert mich an Viva Pinata.
Es gibt einige lustige NPCs und das erkunden der Insel (4 Areale) macht Laune. Ein super Spiel zum abschalten, wenn man gerade keinen Kopf hat f√ºr anspruchsvolleres Material.

I well knew that the game was only a simple game, all it was about was picking up flowers (lol?) and quick time events fights. So I was prepared to a mediocre game with a good artistic style.

Well, it's much more than that. The style is in fact very pleasant, I would say very well designed levels. You get 5 different levels in which you can free roam (you can't jump so no platforming sessions). Every level is quite different from the other and very suggestive. Every level also comes with its own background music.

The 'fights' consist in getting close enough to the enemy, and triggering the QTE (with the mouse cursor, or with ABXY buttons of the 360 controller). It is a nice QTE, compared to the average QTE in other games. During the fight you also can choose whether to use or not some powers (flash bombs).

The Character can be upgraded and customized (although the outfits are different almost only in colors). The flower picking is not tedious, comes spontaneous while you walk around enjoying the scenery.

When I saw the achievements....picking up 1000 flowers....I thought it was crazy. But no, in fact in only a few hours I did everything in the game and it really was no hassle. I enjoyed every part of it. It is the exact game I was looking for: it is nice, fun enough, and not complicated at all. It is a perfect game for children, or for grownups that want to relax from all the other FPS and action games, and dedicate themselves to this relaxing game.

Specifically from a design aspect, I find the mechanics to be a fascinating way to have a non-combat oriented game that still proves to be challenging, interesting, and altogether very different.

The mechanics are pretty simple as far as a concept goes: you are a student botenist, and are collecting rare plants to study for a report, and thus go to an island. However, when you get there, trickster spirits get in your way and steal whatever flowers you have collected. To get them back, you must ride them like an unbroken bronco, plucking them while trying to hang on. All in all, very different, and definitely worth studying, especially if you have any interest in game design. Outside of this main gameplay trope, shall we say, there's a fair amount to explore in this world, with flowers showing up around every corner, plenty of people with well fleshed out personalities to talk with, and an interesting stat system to learn to make future, more difficult spirits more manageable.

Then there are the aesthetics. This game is absolutely gorgeous for the few resources it takes. The textures are well placed and the models are incredible. The animations are so carefully crafted, that it draws you into the magical island you have entered. I haven't found anything that feels out of place, or that jars me from the experience of the game, even with all of the collectable hats you can find for your main character.

Now the story is why I recommend this game with caution. Although it is fairly well written, it definitely is aimed towards a target audience that I am just not a part of. I believe this game to be designed with players younger than me in mind, older children into the preteen age. I feel like most children could get something out of this game, although I'm not completely sure how young too young would be for this particular title. However, being in my early 20s, this story simply doesn't compell me personally.

Now even with the somewhat childish atmosphere and story, I still found myself truly enjoying the game. It's not my favorite game, by a long shot, but for what it is, it does offer some decent entertainment for when I just want to relax and play a game that reminds me of the titles that got me into gaming almost 20 years ago.",1419194178,1419194178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's exploratory and challenging, just enough to keep you interested in what new, spiffy thing is waiting to be discovered.

Then you take a break to get a pop, and realize that the inhabitants of the game are only capable of eating each other. That the cute little artifacts you've been finding are remnants left by people who have died here and been trapped in slave-bodies, bereft of the memories of their former lives.

Initially, it struck me as not too good because it does suffer from invisible wall syndrome. However, I kept playing and got quite into it, the game is actually pretty good on the exploration and ""questing"" front, even if it doesn't have a massive map. I did find that the game was rather heavy on the ""collecting items"" front.

Music is very good, and the sound bites work well to enhance the text which makes up the dialogue as there are are no full-text voices. The dialogue in this game has lots of humour, and the story it tells is good.

The Graphics are very nice, cartooney not photorealistic. The design of the maps in the world are likewise very well done.

I did encounter a bug that prevented the in-game cursor from loading, but this was easily fixed by switching resolutions in-game. The game is listed as having full controller support, but you shouldn't be playing with a controller. It is simply not suited to this.

Overall, while it isn't the most amazing game out there, it does provide for a fun game that you can probably get through in an afternoon, if you have one free. I will say that if you're after a heavy RPG, don‚Äôt go for this.

The ""combat"" is very low stress and is legitmately fun. You wont find yourself cursing rampantly if you mess up (at least I didn't find myself doing that). The only thing this game needs is more... more levels, more travels. I'd love to see DLC's in the future, although I know it is a small dev team.

I thought I was getting a full ""Zelda""-like game with a female protagonist and a unique combat mechanism, but this was just ""Flower-Picking: The Game,"" with occasional optional fetch quests.

I'm not even sure what demographic this was meant for; the dialogues, humor, and videogame references are older-teenager appropriate, whereas the gameplay is simplified enough for an elementary student to master.  Likewise, The main character looks like she's 15 and acts like she's 12, but is supposed to be a graduate student, and has apparently played every old school videogame on the planet except for Zero Wing... even the other characters in the game couldn't place her age.

What I liked about this game:
- The visuals and character designs were interesting, creative, and well-crafted.  I really enjoyed the overall look and atmosphere of the game, and the attention to detail of the artists.
- The game's frequent references to other videogames and movies, the dark humor, and the sassy side comments.  It was worth it to keep talking to characters and to read all the Mayor's signs.
- The balanced learning curve.
- The ability to pick up wearable items like ridiculous masks, videogame hats, and flying pets.

What was okay:
- The core game mechanic of picking flowers off spirits' backs.  While there was an increase in difficulty as the game went on (the introduction of thorns and bombs, the movement patterns of the spirit, the need to score higher combos of non-thorn flowers), there was not enough variation for it to feel appreciably different after about the 8th enemy.  The only real distinguishing factor from that point on was how long of a combo you needed in order to win 3 stars; early enemies only need 8-12 flowers in a row, whereas the final boss takes a chain of 30-40 flowers.  As you can imagine, by the 52nd spirit this minigame had worn out its welcome.
- Sometimes you will be able to complete optional side quests instead of fighting, which fall into one of four categories: ""find all the hidden things,"" ""visit that place you just visited,"" ""fetch an item from the chest you just opened,"" or ""fight that spirit you just fought""... O.o
- Four Hand Monty's ""if you are short on cash and don't want to break vases"" bonus ball-and-cup minigame.
- The oversimplified inventory system that consists of three tiers of armor for each of your three stats, three one-use items that I rarely ever used, two kinds of currency, two levels of keys, a cheater's map, and a bottle that summons butterflies for no reason.  That's it, unless you count the treasure trophies that only exist for flavour.

What I didn't like:
- Being constantly interrupted by either Mailbox, or the Mayor, or the fish, with long blocks of dialogue that you can't really skip.  I'm all about witty banter and story progression, but considering you need to play through the game twice to get all the achievements, it would have been nice to be able to bypass the excessive chatter.
- The big mid-game ""choice.""  I played through the game a third time, just to see what would happen if I chose the alternate path, and it was totally not worth it.  I was expecting at least a cutscene with the Professor.
- The rainbow bird poo.  Seriously?  That needed to be a thing?
- The achievements.  Some of them made sense, like the ones for beating the spirits, but some of them were needlessly tedious such as the ""break 1000 vases"" or ""scare 500 birds."" Additionally, these achievements are not cumulative across multiple playthroughs, you must break all 1000 vases using the same save file.  
There is also one broken achievement for this game: ""unlock all doors.""  It seems there was a discrepancy between the PC version and other ports, with the PC release only having 22/28 unlockable doors programmed in.  Thus, the achievement cannot be unlocked without manually altering the game code (you can find instructions for this online, but I personally didn't want to risk irreparably damaging my game data just for 100% completion).  [Edit 12/19/14: The broken achievement has been removed from Steam, so you can now get 100% completion!]

Overall, I would give this game a 7/10.  I liked the setting and the humor, but the core gameplay and the achievements were tiresome and boring by the end.",1418036601,1419016889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Seeing this game in the Steam Store, the first thoughts to come to mind were ""This looks fantastic"" and ""Why haven't I heard of this before""? Unfortunately the answer was evident in about 10 minutes. This is a mobile port - a fantastic looking one that trumps most indie games made for the PC proper in terms of looks, but a mobile port nonetheless and that permeates the game to its core. 

This game is obviously a labour of love and it shows. But that it's also a mobile game utterly annihilates all of its positives - there's a ""but"" for each and every one.

‚Ä¢Every inch of the world looks fantastic, but you can't interact with it beyond walking around it.
‚Ä¢All of the levels are utterly distinct, but there's only four of them and they take 20 minutes to beat.
‚Ä¢The characters are well written and distinctly funny, but you never get more than half a dozen lines out of even the most prominent ones. 
‚Ä¢There's sidequests and optional content, but they're all threadbare.
‚Ä¢Design is solid all around, but assets are reused to a comical degree - I had trouble telling NPCs apart. 

Threadbare describes the game as a whole. Combat altering inventory items? Great idea. There's three of them and they're thrown at you, though. Stat increase system? Great idea. Shallow as a puddle, though. Climactic mid-sequence about abandoning previous life choices? Great idea. It consists of three and a half lines of dialogue either way and falls completely flat though. 

Worst case is the combat (or ""combat"", but there's enough high-octane explosives involved that I think you can safely ignore the whole nonviolent billing) - you perform the same unchanging minigame twenty or so times and then the game is over. Fifty-five if you're aiming for completionist. 

For a mobile game these are all more than excusable. Hell, I've no doubt that had I played this on a mobile device it would rank up there with the best; Dead Space iOS and Infinity Blade. But I didn't, and for a PC game, to put it lightly, it kicks it straight in the balls. Right in there. And it isn't the developers' fault. But that's just how it is. 

At it's best Lili: Child of Geos is an exercise in frustration at lost potential the likes of which I haven't felt since Crash Twinsanity.

Even though I wouldn't actually recommend this to anyone, maybe just buy it anyway. Support the developers. I want to see another game from them. Built from the ground up for PC this time.

You follow Lili on her quest to free the citizens of Geos from the Spirits by gathering items and collectibles. There's really no point in the game than to immerse yourself with the wonderful cartoon fantasy world while discovering hidden items and collecting flowers - white ones which you can get anywhere and red ones which you need to fight some spirits to get it.

I really enjoyed this game despite of the lack of gameplay and the linear story line. What makes this game so much fun is the great art style and the graphics, this runs smoothly on my 3 yr old gpu, and I can appreciate that.  There are collectable items in the game like hats, pets, and masks. It's a nice addition, but the dresses are just a change in color. It would've nice to see something different. 

The music is perfect for a game like this but sometimes it gets a little annoying, I would have liked it to be a little subtle while im exploring and want to hear more of those ambient sounds.

I can highly recommend this to someone bored of the usual games and just want to chill out and enjoy the fantasy world. But if your an average gamer who wants more gameplay and some serious satisfaction out of a game, this isn't for you. I'd say it's great for a collectible, but honestly not worth the price, since the game is too short and replay value is very low.

Graphics: 7 - I like the graphics of the game and the the world of Geos is beautiful. 

Gameplay: 4 - There isn't really anything to do here aside from collecting flowers to proceed with quests and maybe collecting  masks and hats.

Music: 7 - The music is above average and will keep you feeling like you are in a cartoon fantasy world, but it gets repetitive. I woud've enjoyed more if I was hearing a more soothing music and more ambient sounds.

Replayability: 3 - The game doesn't offer anything more after you've beaten it once, maybe just to pick up more flowers and vases for achievements, or maybe get those missable hats or masks.

Overall Impression: 7 - I still give it a 7 despite of all the negatives, there is a certain charm to this game the you can only experience once you start adventuring with Lili=)

I picked it up on a whim during the Autumn sale, sat down, and blasted through it in one sitting. 
I looked at it because of the visuals. For an indie game, it's beautiful. Stylistic without abandoning realism. Bright and colorful. Great lighting. The character models are also really good, and well animated for the most part. The NPCs do seem to have one or two looping animations that they run through, but there's a lot of different NPCs, each with their own thing going on, so you never spend too much time looking at the single animations.
There is a story in there. It's nothing fantastic, but it isn't horrible. Its a sort of basic hero story; you show up on this island for a school project, and are introduced to a class struggle between the spirits, who own the island. and the constructs, who were created to serve the spirits. It moves along pretty quick, and the ""big bad"" of sorts is pretty entertaining to deal with.
The gameplay is almost a QTE sort of thing. You run around the island, picking up collectables. Flowers, which can be traded for money, chests that have money and quest or cosmetic items, and vases that you kick open for money and achievement score. Then you come across spirits roaming the quarters, and jump on their back for the main gameplay, where you are shown flowers you have to pick. You pick the good flowers and avoid the bad flowers, and pick bombs to throw off as you progress. You can upgrade your Speed (movement, helps you keep up with the spirits), Grip (gives you more time to hang on to their backs), and Stealth (makes you harder for them to notice, allowing you to get closer to them before they see you and start running away). I upgraded Speed to max, and Grip about halfway, and never had much trouble. You also get scored on how well you did. Picking more bad flowers or letting bombs explode in your face take points away, and for every 3 star score you get, you get the spirit's mask to wear.
There are also quests to do for the constructs. Simple stuff, like find me an item (in a chest somewhere nearby), go take down a specific spirit, go find and talk to another construct. They give cosmetic items, hats mostly.
You get a lot of hats to choose from, mostly masks from the spirits, but a fair amount of regular hats or headwear.

TL;DR - It's fun, really short, and really pretty. I bought it for less than $5 and I feel really happy with it. I don't know if I'd agree with $20, but for $10 or less, its definitely something to pick up",1417624681,1417624681,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Despite this simplicity the game is fairly enjoyable because it comes in combination with a fairly enjoyable setting and atmosphere.

Maybe not at full price, but I would certainly recommend this game if you want to play around in a happy setting with surprisingly well polished graphics and lighting.

There is a bit of a plot here but ultimately the desire to return to the game isn't strong enough and the reply value is almost zero.

This brings me to the issue of, ""Should I recommend this game to others?"" 
That is really a very conditional thing because there is money involved. 

Had this been a F2P game then I would wholeheartedly recommend it due to the fact that, in short sessions, the game is really very enjoyable and is a pleasure to look at. The visuals and style of the game just scream quality from the rooftops and there is enough tongue-in-cheek humour here to put a smile on even the most cynical of faces. If you enjoy games you will come across such a large number of references to other titles it is almost wrong to call them Easter Eggs since the game is saturated with them rather than having them hidden away. The developers clearly love Legend of Zelda and other Nintendo games because they not only attempted to create an Nintendo-esque art style but they also added music to the game which is clearly inspired by games such as Wind Waker. They achieved that goal with such success that you could drop Mario or Link into the game world and they'd look perfectly at home.

Unfortunately when it comes to paying money for this and wanting value for money from your purchase, Child of Geos has very little to offer. It reminds me of something that would work well as a casual game for a rainy afternoon but nothing more, as such I wouldn't recommend this game unless it was on sale for maybe ¬£2-3 at most.

What the developers have created here is really something which deserves a sequel though, while they missed the mark on gameplay they have set a new benchmark for style and quality for the visuals, music and presentation for an indie game.

It's colorful and unique art style and character designs interested me enough to put it on my watchlist. Having had the chance to finally give the game a playthrough I can see it both met my expectations and also took them in a different direction. This isn't your typical RPG by a longshot. You won't really be level grinding or anything like that as there really is no battle mechanic. You play as a botanist and your typical task on the island is to pick flowers. The best flowers happen to grow on the backs of creatures known as spirits. Picking them off their backs as they try to shake you off takes the form of a mini-game. I hadn't known going in that the game was a revisioned port of an iOS game, but it by far feels like one. That isn't a bad thing however as this game is beautiful to look at and the 'battles' can get quite challenging when thorny flowers and bombs are thrown into the mix. The game is also quite charming with a very unique art style I greatly enjoyed.

I do have a few issues with the game however, the camera has a bit of a wabble motion to it that is noticeable which can't be turned off in the options. If you easily get motion sick, this may get to you at first as it almost did with me, but as you're moving around it becomes less noticable. The game is also dull in parts and repetitive. Especially at first but once the game gains momentum it becomes far more interesting. The game even has a fairly dark undertone which I enjoyed but doesn't ever drown out it's charming and humerous nature. The writing is a bit odd at times though with occasional typos oddly phrased sentences and punctuation errors that hardly ruin the gameplay. Dialog is easy to read and understand even for children, though item descriptions can use words a bit out of reach for younger players. The game also features an auto-save feature which can get annoying towards the end of the game when you're given two choices. I would have liked to have saved at that point manually to reload later and take the other path instead of having to play through again.

All in all, I enjoyed myself while I was playing and genuinely felt myself drawn into the world this game created. This game isn't for everyone and I wouldn't consider it an RPG as it's closer to a modern day point and click adventure. I'd recommend it to ages 10-15, especially to female audiences or Miyazaki anime fans as it has a similar world feel. It won't be a length sit. I finished the game in 5.5 hours, but it does have a branching path towards the end.",1417275102,1417275102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1][b]Full Review at [url=http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=124]GameDragons.Net[/url][/b][/h1]

[b]Presentation[/b]
Lili: Child of Geos tells the story of a young botanist, Lili, set on a quest to the supposedly uninhabited island of Geos as part of a school research project, but as the stories never tell the whole truth until you live them, you will soon find out that the island is actually inhabited by creatures called the Spirits and their creations meant to serve them, the Constructs. It won't be long before your arrival will alert the Spirits as your presence starts to influence the lives of the Constructs and make them question their existence as servants, so you will soon be caught up in the affairs of Geos‚Äô locals. 

As much of a premise for a serious plot there is, the game chooses tell its story in a satirical way, adding jokes and references to other games every now and then, some which fail to deliver, making the entire story feel irrelevant after you realize most quests are there to fill in the space without an actual outcome in the storyline. As a game that focuses on exploration and the landscape it creates with it, it was disappointing to see how limited that exploration really is; it was exciting to find new items, meet new Constructs and see where else their quests will take me, but after a few minutes you will soon realize that there are only around eight additional sidequests, most which take no longer than ten minutes to complete and as for everything you see in the distance, you will never actually get there.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
As for how the game plays, well it certainly is different from anything you have experienced before, as your main objective is to defeat Spirits by jumping onto their back and picking the flowers that spurt from their heads. This is where the game shows its true nature, as it was originally made for tablets and picking flowers by dragging them with your finger across the screen feels natural and easy, but doing the same thing with a mouse can be a little bit tricky. 

Using a controller makes the whole thing a little bit easier as you can select the flower you want to pull using the action button, but at the same time it creates another problem, as you can only select from a range of four flowers, mapped to their respective action button, so later on in the game when you'll have to deal with up to eight different flowers, weeds and bombs at the same time, the controller will prove to be more of a burden than a helpful tool. Outside the battle the game works much better, using the keyboard and mouse or the controller to move around, collect flowers, look around for treasures and meet Geos' finest, but then again for an open world experience, there is a really small number of things that you can do outside the main story, which isn't that long either and the first glance at Geos will soon be shattered by exploration limits and the lack of new things to keep you going for longer or distract you from your main objective.

[b]Graphics[/b]
Looking back at the iOS version of the game, it's clear that the visual upgrade worked out for the best and Lili: Child of Geos looks amazing on PC, but the real beauty when playing the game comes from the art style itself, taking you somewhere between what a gnome village would look like and combining it with a good Pixar movie. The landscapes are simply amazing and as for the characters, even if the Spirits look the same except for their masks, the Constructs each have a unique touch to help you recognize them whenever you see them around Geos. The bad part in all this is that you never get to explore everything that you actually see ahead of you and the five different locations of the island can be completed within minutes as there is nothing else to do besides the main objective and a few chests scattered around.

[b]Audio[/b]
The soundtrack complements the visual art style, probably not in the best way possible but its better with it there playing the background as you move on than without it. The worst part on the audio side is the absence of voice acting, which is understandable since most mobile titles lack such things, but as a PC port it's hard not to complain about how great the dialogue could've been voiced by the right actors, and on the same note it could've made some of those lame jokes funny just by using the right voice. The sound effects are okay, but since there is a limited number of items and objects that interact with the environment and your character, it will soon feel like a repetitive and monotone experience.

[b]Extras[/b]
It takes around four hours to finish Lili: Child of Geos, which isn't nearly enough to justify a 20‚Ç¨ price tag, and aside from that and a few achievements that you'll miss on your first playthrough there really is nothing else to keep you around, no matter how beautiful the island of Geos is.

[b]Verdict[/b]
Judging by the first look, Lili: Child of Geos is beautiful and unique, but in this case the first look is deceiving, as the game won't last more than a few hours and as for the time in which it actually is entertaining, that's probably less than 30 minutes, but if that time is enough for you and you're just looking for a great view, Lili: Child of Geos delivers flawlessly on that side.

When I came along to see this game on sale, I thought what would await me was a cheesy, but pretty RPG with puzzles to solve and battles to win, much like the advertised likeness to Zelda and Psychonauts. What greeted me instead was an almost childish flower-picking simulator with the most gorgeous artstyle I ever saw.

And I didn't mind.

I bought this game, like some other people, because of the screenshots, and the promise of reliving some of the charm of the games of my childhood. I'm not normally a person who cares much for graphical fidelity in games so long as the gameplay is fun, however in this case? Quite the opposite. Something about the graphics style just makes me innately happy whenever I look at it. It puts my mind to rest for a while, which as a person with depression and anxiety attacks is a bloody godsend. The entire game is very colorful, vivid and nicely stylized, with very fluent animation, adorable little details and an overall just... happy feeling to it. It's easily one of the best-looking games I've played in my life, and it does so not through polygon count, but clever, passionate stylization. Don't get me wrong, though, the models are still pretty high quality.

With the graphics out of the way, though, let's address gameplay. This is where I initially felt cheated by the storepage claiming such close resemblance to the Zelda and Psychonauts games. I imagined adventuring, clever puzzles and dangerous trials. What I got was ""Flower Picking - Collector's Edition"", with the 'Collector' being quite literal. This is a game about collecting things and smashing pots. Collect flowers. Collect money. Collect conversation. Collect Collectibles. Every so often you'll fight a spirit, where the term 'fighting' is used much in the same way the term 'Discussion' is used for having a 12-year-old squeak into their microphone online in your FPS of choice. The spirits run away from you, because apparently a 16 year-old hipster florist apprentice is more dangerous than a mystical, 7 feet tall nature spirit with magic powers. Once you've caught up to the spirits, the fighting is technically a long, randomized QTE. They grow flowers from their backs. Sometimes they're good flowers, sometimes they're bad flowers, sometimes they're bombs. A button hovers over them and the game wants you to press the button that hovers over the thing which won't harm you like a parent presenting three hot stove plates and a plushie to their three-year-old and telling them to think fast.
Occasionally the gameplay is broken up through quests you get from talking carpentry accidents that more often than not involve walking to a specific place or talking to a specific person. Sometimes you need to defeat a certain spirit, which you would probably do anyway sooner or later.

What makes the quests, and the game in general interesting are the conversations. Despite the childish flair of the game, the writing is actually enjoyable for the most part, offering some casual humor around every corner. The characters are all quirky enough, and while not exactly believable, are enjoyable to interact with and had me talking to them over and over again to see more conversational options. Whether that was because I actually enjoyed the quirkyness of it all or simply because there's not much else to do I'm not quite sure, but it's lead me to finishing the game and doing so with a smile, so whatever it was, it worked!
On account of the writing, however, and the general presentation, in this case of the main character, I'll have to give a bit of a cringe-warning:
The game likes its references. Which is all fine and dandy, many games do it, and to great effect, usually in the form of little trinkets hidden here or there, or a quest resembling the story of a classic. Lili has a slightly different approach to that in some points, ""slightly different"" meaning ""IN YOUR FACE"". The game enjoys repeating how much of a gamer the main protagonist is, and how much she knows about casual video game trivia to the point where it had me sit in my chair, squeeze my legs together and groan.
""Look at us!"", the game keeps saying, ""We're gamers just like you, haha! See? We played some video games!""
""Alright, that's cool!"", I replied with a smile and went on with my business.
""Oh hey, did we mention how much we love gaming? Hey, we're just like you! Gamer bro fist, haha!""
Alright, game, I get it. You guys made a video game, I kind of figured you'd probably have played one or two before.
""Hey look at how much we know about games! Man, games, am I right? We love games so much. We should hang out now because you play games, too!""

One last thing to consider before a purchase is the length of the game. I've completed the game with all sidequests in about 4 hours. It's not a terribly long game by any stretch of the imagination. You can beat it in a single afternoon if you're so inclined, and there's little reason to go back to it afterwards unless you just need a breather from grey reality and want to delve into a colorful, gorgeous fantasy island again.

All in all, however, it's a minor itch and completely ignorable. The game, while about as casual as a stroll through the park on a sunny spring day, was still enjoyable and while I would not recommend it for the full price, it's certainly worth a look on sale. Whether you're feeling down or just long for something lax to play while listening to a podcast or letting the day fade out, it's sure to put a smile on your face if you don't mind an experience that's more focussed on presentation than gameplay. It's an immensely impressive starting project for BitMonster and I'm looking forward to their next games already.

""Lilli: Child of Geos"" is an astoundingly charming indie game full of colour and character. The gameplay is addictive but can get a bit samey, but, thankfully doesn't overstay it's welcome. While the $20 price tag is a bit high for a 5 hour long game, it's well worth a shot when on sale if you are into casual, colourful experiences.

Now for the meat:

	Lilli is one charming title. There is so much colour in this game to help make the island of Geos feel alive, making each of the characters you meet another interesting addition to the game. Just starting off this review, if I have to say what this game's strong suit is, it is definitely the art direction it took with aesthetics, I couldn't ask for it any other way.
	The gameplay, while somewhat reminiscent of ""Zelda"" games, lacks any sort of true combat mechanic. Even the game remarks at one point, acknowledging the fact that you will not ""kill"" anything on this island, even the bad guys. The idea predmoninantly is based around the idea of exploring the town (divided into 4 seperate sections) on the island of Geos. While in each section of the town there are various tasks to be completed: from independant exploration to find treasures, flowers, and pots to smash; to completing quests the various towns people have - most of these ranging in a form of a fetch quest, disappointingly.
	The game also features RPG-esque stat building. These stat points are there to help aid you in the core mechanic of the game, which is finding, capturing, and defeating ""spirits"". This involves using the mouse to click on flowers and plants to pluck from the head of the spirit while trying to maintain your grip on said spirit by not plucking thorny plants or getting hit by...-bomb flowers-....
	This mechanic works well enough to do the job, but is certainly not the highlight in quality for this game. The mechanic itself tends to get a bit monotonous after a lengthy playthrough with this game, as well as the 3-star rating system that seems to be unclear as to how to obtain a rank. Often times I found a well executed ""plucking"" of a Spirit would only reward 2 stars, while other times I was fumbling over thorny plants and mis-clicking, I still got 3 stars.
	When it comes to the controls of this game, this is probably the worst part, sadly. There are NO REBINDABLE KEYS. while the game doesn't use a lot of keys to begin with, I had many frustration that the ""Interact"" and the ""mount Spirit"" function were mapped to the same key, leading often to me talking to an NPC, rather than mounting the spirit I was chasing. Additionally there is some of the ABSOLUTE WORST mouse acceleration in this game. Even set to the ""highest"" mouse sensitivity, the game seems to have ""camera smoothing"" which results in the games camera and character feeling very, very floaty. I figured perhaps a controller would feel more comfortable for this type of thing, but surprisingly it was even more uncomfortable for me to play with a controller than a mouse. This is something that I hope the Developer will fix in later patches. Unfortunately, if you gathered with the 3-star rating system, addictive game play, colourful graphics, and wonky controls: Yes, this game seems to be intended for mobile platforms, and I think is quite a blemish on this game to have to comprimise competent, and proper PC graphics and control settings to aid with the underpowered mobile devices.
	Before concluding I would like to mention a HUD bug this game seems to have, which is most apparent on 4:3 panels. This game does not feature proper word wrapping or font-size adjustments. Often text will bleed off of the on-screen button or prompt - this looks unattractive and very amatuerish. 
	Additionally I want to make 1 side note: While I am not a professor of law, I think this game borders dangerously close to infringing some copyright, with blatant use of Nintendo IP titles and names, additionally a music track in Mill Hill is dangerously close to a track in the Sims 3.
	
	Lilli, with it's blemishes aside, is still a fun and addicting game to play. While the price tag is hard to justify for it's 5 hour campaign, if you find it on sale, I can't recommend it enough that you play this game.

I heard this was pretty short so I held out for a good sale and finally picked it up for about $4. After almost 3 hours I'm maybe halfway through the game. I figure it should give me at least 5-6 hours of gameplay which is decent for that price but at full price you may want to hold off.

Anyway, about the game itself... The characters and the world are totes adorable. You'll find humorous writing, both light and even a little dark, video game references and great art direction. It's a good looking game with it's own style. 

It's not without flaws, though. The biggest one which may even make it difficult for some people to play this is the barfy mouse-look. I can't even call it mouse acceleration. It's way worse than that. The mouse-look lags way behind and then suddenly snaps into position. It's very awkward and even though I never get motion sickness playing games, this had my stomache rolling sometimes. 

Also, this game does not allow you set your game up via launcher or main menu. It dumps you into the game right away and you can fiddle with some minor graphics options once you get into it. The game did an adequate job of detecting my hardware and the game ran fine for me but for some others this may end up being a problem. Every game should allow you to configure your settings before rendering more than a menu just for safety's sake.

Another minor thing is the lack of voice acting. There are some voice clips, from Lili saying ""hi"" in 3 or 4 different ways to the other characters having their own little intros/outros to some grunts/barks during combat but aside from that none of the dialog is voiced which is weird since the voice acting that is there isn't bad. It would have been nice for a game this short to be fully voiced, at least the main characters.

Overall, though, it's a fun, cute little game involving smashing vases, stealing people's belongings out of thier homes, picking flowers and completing quests in good ol' RPG fashion. Pick it up on sale!",1414969350,1415069398,True,2,0,0.527585089206695557,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After playing through the first two areas (so far), I must say I am very pleasantly surprised! The art is very nice, as I expected, but the detail is far greater than I expected. Such a lovely atmosphere! The world they've created is one that I am thoroughly enjoying exploring. You can tell a lot of love went into this game just from looking around.

But enough about the wonderful art. If I had to classify this game I'd say it's a point-and-click with some (very limited) RPG elements and quick time events.

The game's story is... well, it's silly, but it's interesting enough. The humor is where it really shines. From conversations to item descriptions, this game has a lot of laughs packed in.

Gameplay is a bit rough. I feel confident in saying that this game was made with touch screens in mind, so the controls are a little clunky and the ""battles"" can be tricky--after all, you only have one mouse instead of a handfull of fingers. Still, you'll get used to it pretty fast. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I can usually get 3 stars (the max number) on my first try, and I am by no means a hardcore gamer. I've only played the first two areas, though, as I said, so it will presumably get harder. Still, I'm sure this will be a turn-off to some, so I feel the need to mention it.

No major glitches so far, just some camera twitchiness when you talk to people as it switches from ""world view"" to ""conversation view"", and once where I could read a sign through a wall.

Music is adequate. Nothing to write home about, but works well with the atmosphere and isn't irritating.

Sound effects are good, but the random dialogue bits (the game isn't fully voice acted, but sometimes people will say a few words of their text) are sometimes odd. Such as Lili saying ""Hello!"" when she's actually saying goodbye in her text... or just randomly in the middle of a conversation. What up with that, Lili?

You're going to play Lili (much surprise ^^), a girl, stranded on an island with strange creatures. You're going to explore the different locations of the island and try to free the creatures from the bad mayor.

The locations are divided into semi-large hubs, which you can explore, find collectibles, hidden chests and solve smaller quests. The locations have a broad variety and do look very different and have their own charme.

The graphics and artstyle are very beautiful in my opinion, which is a great strength of the game.

The overall gameplay is rather simple and casual though. There is not much ""puzzle solving"" involved, you rather run around the island, explore the locations and stumble upon secrets without a bigger challenge.

But even if the gameplay is quite simple, i had my fun with it and enjoyed playing it.
The main storyline is rather short, i guess, though you do have some collectibles and achievements which might keep you busy for a while.

I'd also recommend this game for a younger audience, as it's rather easy and casual and violent-free.

Lili: Child of Geos is decently ported iOS game about playing as a girl picking flowers....what am I doing with my life?!

[b]TL;DR: It is a fantastic looking game that is basically a collectathon without much challenge beyond hopping on the backs of enemies to pluck flowers from enemies trying to shake you off of themselves. It sounds silly, but probably worked well on mobile and worked fine as a PC mini game. Calling this game an RPG is a stretch -it's more like a platformer without platforming - adventuring and collecting really. I adore the world design and want to see more of it, and it's simplistic game style makes sense for being an original iOS game.[/b]

Lili caught my attention from a recent Groupees Bundle: The character is a unique female protaganist and the game looked like it had a nice Pixar-movie quality. I'm glad to say that at least visually and in terms of world building, it does have that quality. I've taken about 150 screenshots of this game, especially since I was captivated by the foilage, lighting, shading and texture effects. Sure, there are more graphically advanced games, but end result of the developers move to make the game look better on PC instead of being a simple port made the game a pleasure to look at and arguably one of the best looking games of the year.

The gameplay mostly boils down to exploring the island, collecting money from kicking pots and collecting white flowers, which are sold for money. The meat of the gameplay is near violently plucking flowers off the backs of Spirits in ""combat"" in order to get their red flowers for reearch at the school Lili is from. I like that the game has a simple story, but it is disappointing that in a game about flower picking, that there are only two types of flowers that matter in the overall world, excluding the green, coin, bomb, and thorns on spirits throught ""combat"". I use combat in quotes, because basically  Lili needs to steal the flowers off the back of the spirits haunting the living, wooden constructs by jumping onto their backs and plucking flowers that sprout from them while the spirits run around trying to shake her off. Thsi form of combat is really the only form of challenge in this game, which was fine for me since it's simplcity is what I was expecting. There is an RPG mechanic of increasing your grip, speed, and stealth, but considering how easy the game is, coupled with the easily obtainable items to augment these abilities (Not to mention that one guide highly recommended Speed and stealth, but I went with Grip and stealth with no problem), your progression will generally not matter unless you are just bad at the game.

While the gameplay is extremely simplistic, yet solid, the best part of the game to me is the overall game world. From the protaganist, to the cast of kinda-stupid but lovable NPCs, and the well design ""levels"". it made me interested in the world more so than the game. I'd be interested in seeing a sequel or a successor that incorporates the world into new gameplay, like a platformer or a Zack and Wiki style puzzler.

[b]Summary:[/b] I finished Lili in slightly over 4hrs and considering what little gameplay there was, I'm perfectly fine with that. More if spent time with the sidequests, though I didn't see a reason too since money or upgrades are only a problem in the earliest first half hour of play. There are plenty of achievements and all seem easy, though it would be a grind to complete them all. I have issues with the constant achievement popups, the lack of ability to change the resolution or remap keys (part of the game was cut off on my Ultra-wide monitor. I played it on a regular monitor, and it was fine. Then I went back to the UW on another play, and I didn't have the cutoff issue anymore), but despite that, I still enjoyed the game. It's shortness makes it an easy recommend for people with large backlogs, though the $20 price point is a bit too high for what is being offered.",1412124053,1412340805,True,2,0,0.542151153087615967,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Lili‚Äôs gameplay is similar to RPGs at core: you explore the area for treasures, talk to NPCs and fight enemies.

In regard of game‚Äôs length, completing the game will likely take you some 5 - 7 hours, depending on how through you are with exploring everything and completing achievements.

The Island of Geos is a small place, with only 4 areas to explore.

To the developers:
You created something new here. Work on that. Create a franchise. Ease of the throttle of side quests and add more to the storyline next time. This game is peaceful, but it could still have such a sense even if you added more strategy without exactly adding more challenge. Add more customization to the strategy. More than just outfits, but outfit pieces that contribute to a better stat system. Invest in voice actors, it makes a huge difference.

This game is for you. I love this game! It's so much fun and the graphics are enjoyable to look at and so colorful. The controls are great with a 360 controller. A vast improvement over the mobile version. This game also has a Nintendo connection. Which is a surprise. I won't spoil it. I highly recommend this game.

I played Lili as soon as it came out for iOS and in my review of the game then I gave it high marks. I give them again this time around.

The best part of Lili for me is that it is full of humor and I actually had a very powerful emotional response to part of the story. It's really that good. But let me pause to point out the one flaw I see in the game.

Unfortunately, punctuation is sloppy and visually stands out against such a flawless graphical backdrop. Admittedly, I'm a stickler for quality writing with careful, consistent use of punctuation and spelling as much as an engaging text. Sadly, this is seemingly the only unpolished bit of Lili. Also, while I appreciate the quirky descriptions and tongue-in-cheek collectibles, there is unexpected semi-questionable content for astute readers.

That being said, I love the feel of this game so get ready for more gushing. The graphics are stunning with beautiful art direction and an immersive environment. This is even truer in the Steam version. It's funny that it looks as I remember it but then when I checked screenshots from my iPhone playthrough, I realized what time and effort really went into this port. The graphics are redone and gorgeous on the big screen!

Lili is a great hero and it's nice to see a nonsexualized female lead. She can be taken seriously and is genuinely likeable. She is also fun to control both on iOS and Steam. I like the control options and found the use of the mouse to give a bit of precision to the main ""battle"" mechanic of the game. I use quotes because there really are no fights other than plucking plants from the backs of spirits and this unique twist is actually very engaging and serves as both a sort of mini game as well as a well tuned challenge in progression.

Finally, I really like the new listings of characters because at the end of the day, they are what made my first experience with Lili so memorable. I look forward to playing through the rest of this game once more and hope you pick it up as well.",1410231710,1410232087,True,1,0,0.500297188758850098,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It oversells to an almost grotesque degree, as other reviewers have already explained better than I could.  That being said, I devoured this game in its (short) enitirety, playing it every free second I could. It's friendly, fun, and entirely light-hearted in a way you seldom see in a video game of this high quality. Playing it is like putting life on easy mode and just smiling the hours away.  As corny as that sounds, it's true.  This game turned me into a happy little girl from beginning to end and I would do it all over again.

But alas, as pretty as this game is to look at, the main mechanics that hold the whole thing together are just not that fun. I don't need combat in every game; I don't need to kill, but the ""combat"" mechanics in this game (picking flowers) are not that fun and are extremely compartmentalized from the rest of the experience whilst also lacking any depth or nuance to speak of. The game would have been better having significant puzzle solving in the environments or even just making the combat a part of the interaction with the world instead of an activated sequence.

movement is limited; there are set paths you can take, and you can see some areas you would think you could venture into, but can't. it doesn't feel very open, i never really truly felt like i was exploring (which is funny, because sometimes lili describes herself as an explorer).

there's only one boss, at the very end of the game, but he handles exactly the same as every other enemy you've beaten in the game before. defeating him was a little anti-climactic, especially since he's only [spoiler]the mayor[/spoiler], and i expected some more powerful (both politically and in strength) enemies.

this game is full of memes and references. some of the enemy profiles will give you a good chortle, as well.

the way you need to defeat enemies is unique if you use a mouse and keyboard, but if you use a controller, all battles will solely be quick-time events. i liked how, with a mouse, you actually had to pull flowers out of the ground, but with the controller, you could just press A, and i found that significantly less fulfilling.

the story is mediocre.
there is no end-game.
you cannot max all skills (to my knowledge).
there are barely any guides for this game, so it's difficult to find help for anything not related to vanity items.

You play as Lili on an exceptionally child friendly island where you beat the baddies by plucking flowers from their heads, which temporarily ... well I'm not really sure, makes them go off in a huff? They are always available for a rematch if you want to. The island itself is beautiful, the gameplay is reasonable although it very much shows its phone/tablet based roots and the story is charming, although firmly aimed at a younger audience.

So what could possibly be wrong with it?
Well first up the price. It is a very short game with quite a hefty price tag. I got it as part of a bundle so I'm good, but in general I would not advise paying full price for this unless you really don't need... money.

Secondly it advertises itself as two things, one is an RPG. Whilst you have three stats that you can upgrade this doesn't make it an RPG in the sense that most people would understand. The other is the line that references ""Zelda, Broken Age, or Psychonauts"" all of which I love, but all of which have pretty much no bearing on this game unless it's something along the lines of ""if you ripped practically everything out of one of those games and then shortened it massively... then here's Lili!""

So yeah... it's a beautiful, short, kid friendly game with lovely visuals, a fun story, funny characters, decent gameplay... but it's overpriced and very misleadingly advertised.

Some of the achievements are also a bit hiccup-y with one refusing to trigger, some not counting/triggering correctly, and unfortunately the grindy ones are tied to a single savegame which is a shame because shifting that to a global variable would have made replaying a great option rather than just running round a completed game picking flowers and kicking vases...",1408880994,1408880994,True,1,0,0.500297188758850098,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Taking its former form as mobile games, Lili is notably short, prolly six hours or so. Ten if you intend to complete everything. No no, it's not a problem and sometimes I appreciate a short game. Then again, because there's a template of mobile game, you can immediately notice it. The gameplay revolves around fighting enemies with tap and drag combination mechanic - a pretty much suitable one for mobile. Not to mention the simplicity of the puzzles for game progression. Well, after all, this is aimed for casual game, so if you want more challenge forget it.

Moreso, there is no voice acting and so it's kinda annoying to see 'Hi' 'Hello' 'Hmpphh' being used all over the maps. This is for me a major negative score for Lili.

Story is... err... very forgettable.

The Developer took care and added gamepad support. Most of the times I'd use controller whenever a game supports it, but for Lili I'd rather go with KB/M - much quicker and precise that way. The control schema I used was WASD/MMORPG-like, and it was smooth enough for the whole time I spent here.

Still, for a buck I spent on it, I wouldn't complain. I got my money's worth (after all I've beaten the game, that's an... achievement by itself), and I'm sure you would also if you can find a bargain elsewhere. Not worth full price, however, because of reasons I wrote above.

Lili: Child of Geos is mostly a mobile game, at least that's the feeling i got from it. It is indeed an eye candy but for me that was the only impresive thing i noticed about it. You, as Lili entered an island full of wood robots who are teased/tortured by their creators who are some mask wearing statues thingys and you end up helping them (or not) be free.

Cons:
- areas are quite heavily walled (no you cannot enter busshes or fall of bridges);
- limited and clunky actions;
- easy and boring ""combat""mechanic;
- no actual voice acting only some voice sounds but not reading dialogue;
- story is kind of short and lame in my opinion(can beat it under 1 hour if you just do the story and nothing else);
- no replayability unless you want to 100% in which you need to replay everything you have already done (nothing new at ALL) just to max out one skill which you couldn''t do in the first run (for some god damn reason since you can max 2 of the 3 and 3/5 of the third skill.............);

Prior to this, I honestly believed a game just had to either have good gameplay or a good narrative to hold my interest. Lili: Child of Geos has neither of these things, but what it does have is an amazing sense of place and a beautiful aesthetic.

Gameplay wise, the game is mediocre. You largely wander around doing minor fetch quests while chasing ghosts. You can read other reviews for specifics on the gameplay, but what's important is to remember that this was originally an iOS game. Grabbing flowers off the ghosts while avoiding hazards is incredibly difficult and unintuitive with a mouse. It's not ""unfun"" but it's certainly not optimized for a keyboard-mouse style of input.

Narratively, the game is pretty average. I really enjoyed the characterization of Lili as a grad student, and some of the minor characters had a few amusing lines, but the actual story and characters are paper thin. If you're looking for a game with a story that leaves you wanting more or characters who you'll remember a week after you play it, this isn't the right place for you.

Aesthetically though, dear god, does this game have aesthetic power in spades. Just look through the screenshots and trailer to get an idea. The game is gorgeous and, on top of that, it has an art style that you can't really find anywhere else. Usually games that put all their attention into graphics go for a pure fantasy build, or something dark and gritty. This game pumps graphical power into childish whimsy and it pays off like crazy. You will never play another game with an atmosphere of innocence and fun like Lili imparts on its players.

Overall, I recommend this game to people who are specifically looking to enter a beautiful world unlike any other in gaming. I'm not sure it's quite worth the standard price, but it's well worth nabbing it on a sale if you can.

Anywho, Lili: Child of Geos is a good casual game.
The only three negatives things I have to say about it are:
1. No back story/intro. They just plop you onto an island with no information and you piece most of the story together throughout the game.
2. No voice acting. Great, story telling games do not need voice acting, however this is not one of those games and even though the story was pretty good, it would of really elevated it if the characters had voices.
3. No replay value. You are basically playing the same minigame over and over again. Sure you can get a better score, but that gets tedious. You do have a choice near the end of the game that I suppose can give you two different endings, but since the beginning to that point would be the same, I do not think it is worth it.

Die Story ist doch recht unspektakul√§r. Ein M√§dchen m√∂chte f√ºr die Schule Blumen von der Insel Geos haben und f√§hrt mit einen Boot hin.Gleich zu Anfang begegnen uns merkw√ºrdige Gestalten aus Holz,sie sind die Bewohner,sind meistens nett aber es gibt auch andere,wie der Mayor,der uns von der Insel treiben will.Sonst sammelt man Blumen,zerst√∂rt T√∂pfe mit n√ºtzigen Zeug drin oder Schatzkisten,die man auch mit Gl√ºck findet.Nat√ºrlich sind auch Quests erledigen,eine unserer Aufgaben.

Die Charakter sind,wie ich finde super gemacht,sehr herzlich und sch√∂n detailiert. Lili,unsere Charakterin ist sehr schlagfertig und wei√ü was sie will und das mit viel Hingabe.Au√üerdem gibt es die sogenannten Spirits,sie sind vergleichbar mit gro√üen Waldgeistern,die am Anfang unsere gesammelten Blumen stehlen,die wir uns aber zur√ºckholen.Spirits muss man im Laufe des Spiels immer wieder Blumen abnehmen.

Die Quest sind wie gesagt und Haupt-und Nebenquests eigenteilt,was eigentlich so gut wie immer so ist.Alle aktuellen Quest sieht man √ºbersichtlich im Men√º.F√ºr jeden abgeschlossene Nebenquest bekommt man eine rote Blume,die wir auch gerne nehmen,da sie f√ºr uns im Spiel sehr wichtig sind.

Die Steuerung ist,dank meines Gamepads sehr leicht und habe bis jetzt auch keine Probleme mit Laggs oder Abst√ºrzen gehabt.

Die Grafik ist so sch√∂n,die Insel ist wirklich gut gemacht und es macht echt Spa√ü einfach nur durch die Gegend zu laufen und sich alles anzusehen! 

Fazit: Sehr sch√∂nes RPG,meinetwegen kann ich stundenlang Blumen sammeln und mit den Leuten reden.Lasst euch nicht von der Spielzeit beeinflussen,im Sale sollte man auf jeden Fall zuschlagen.Spiele jetzt schon seit 3 Stunden und es scheint doch noch etwas weiter zu gehen.Klare Kaufempfehlung,f√ºr alle die ein sch√∂nes RPG suchen!",1408196874,1495748692,True,17,0,0.679265379905700684,0,False,False,False,False,,,

What features does Lili: Child of Geos provide in order to entertain the player? Of course, flowers collecting goes first, then we have talking with inhabitants of a tiny world (which, by the way, looks just wonderful), then goes pots smashing, chests smashing, taking away flowers from local antagonists. At last we have upgrades purchasing, performed in order to speed up and ease all aforesaid procedures, making them even more convenient in such a convenient game. Actually, that's all.

hope they improve more on interface, interaction & animation",1407603931,1407603931,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Lili - Child of Geos is an open world adventure with light RPG elements which seems mostly oriented to younger audience. You play part of Lili, quirky graduate who has landed on an island with intelligent humanoid trees and masked ""spirit"" creatures with the mission of picking up all the rare flowers for her graduation thesis. Problem is, the flowers grow only on spirit's back, so she has to chase them, jump on their back and pluck flowers while they run frantically away. But not to feel bad for the spirits, cause they're all kinda jerks to the tree people who are basically their slaves.
It has definitely got my recommendation. Firstly I'll tell what's good about it, then what problems does it have and lastly a conclusion. 
Pluses:
+Graphic. Hands down. They're not exagerating the marketing pitch, the graphic is very nice for such a small, tablet-ported title, nice particle and filter post-proc effects hold on even to AAA modern game standards, and framerate smoothness is commendable. I couldn't manage to lower it under 60FPS anywhere - on rare loading points, on great city panoramas, anywhere! The framerate stayed rock solid stable. 
+Characters. Tree-people are generally original, are interesting, have charm and personality, and are diverse. Just the way it should be in an imaginative adventure game. Lili is really quirky and charming heroine. A bit simplified characterisation and motivation, which again begs the conclusion this was intended for younger players, but one can see she was written with heart.
+Interesting areas. Areas are full of collectibles, small side quests (which usually give cosmetic colectibles) and secrets. It's fun to explore them. Again though, although one can wander around nicely exploring, the areas aren't huge, and can be completely scanned fairly quickly. The game isn't 10s of hours long, more like 4-8h (at the time of writing I had 1.7h registerd and, as I understand other reviews, I'm somewhere around the half mark. On the other hand, the areas are diverse and look lovely all in all.
+RPG elements. Although somewhat shallow (4 skill gagues with some 5 stages overall) skill acquiring is a nice touch. Other RPG staple, equippable items is just cosmetic, but is my hat collection is even this early vide and fun to collect. Could have been more deep and flashed out, but better to have it like that than not at all. 
+Gameplay. As said, exploring the world overall is fun, plucking ""minigames"" arecahotic when played with mouse, but not too hard with few skill adjustments and prizes are satisfactory. Overall it does it's job well enough, although, yet again is somewhat simple.
Now the minuses:
-INABILLITY TO CHANGE KEYBINDINGS! I'm a leftie, goshdarnit, and having no possible option to change movement keys to anything other than wasd bothers me alot (if this review were just for me, I'd put here two minuses, 'stead of one). Arrow keys are already used for camera movement (which I already do with the mouse), so they're in the code, I just need an option to change them with wasd, but none exists. Connected to that is 
-GUI. It seems shody ('seems', not 'is'). It gets the job done, but it's obvious this is a tablet port, the buttons are huge on FHD and some standard shortcuts and usability options don't exist here. Nothing game-breaking, but it could have been better. 
-Shortness. The game has potential, could have been something much greater, but in it's heart it's a tablet game with tablet shortness. People are reporting around 6h gameplay time. Shame.
-+Odd quirks. I... kinda can't describe in detail, but at the moments I'm experiencing strange tonal dissonances in the game. I can't put my finger for whom the game speciffically is. If it's for younger and/or casual audience, then why are there lots of standard gaming touches about modern computer games, and their respectable memes. And rest of the game is depicted like fairytale like fantasy setting. It's not entirely clear how this setting is connected to our world. Lili goes to magical university so 9/10 times I think I'm in fantasysetting, then suddenly the tone shifts to strange and disturbing. Not that I mind, disturbing fairytale has become regular trope in itself (and e.g. I love AM's Alice MR) but it kinda clashes awkwardly. The game doesn't want to commit fully to weirdness, but sprinkles it around in odd bits. It's not a problem, but sticks like a scrapwe on your keyboard you know you'll get used to eventually, but which distracts first 10 times you feel it...
-Prize. For such a short game 20‚Ç¨ is a bit much. I bought it within a bundle, so it's definitely worth it, but full prize is a bit too much. Just a bit, but still.

Conclusion: Interesting short casual experience with awesome graphic, great exploration and fun story. The game's not a masterpiece, but it doesn't try to be one. 
I recommend it without a doubt, IF it's on a discount.",1407509914,1407509914,True,1,0,0.500297188758850098,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Both games have similar styles in humor (everyone, from Constructs to Spirits to Ominous Fish, has something silly to say to/about you) and design, so if you enjoyed Psychonauts for that aspect (like I did), then you'll enjoy Lili.

The gameplay is also fun.  It's an rpg-esque exploration game, interspersed with an interesting little mini game involving ripping flowers out of the backs of malevolent spirits (never thought I'd say that before).  The scenery is gorgeous, definitely encouraging exploration just by being too darn beautiful to want to leave.  And the minigame was kind of addicting; I wanted to keep playing it and beating each of my high scores, yes, but I also wanted to keep playing it because it was fun.

My only gripe is that the game felt too short.  A couple more quarters to explore (and maybe a few more outfits to collect) would have scratched that itch.  But hey, maybe in the sequel, right?  ;-)",1407507487,1407507487,True,3,0,0.511474013328552246,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Lili: Child of Geos is an adventure game where you go around a gorgeous island collecting flowers for a school report.
The island is populated by Spirits and the wooden Constructs they've created to be their servants, you'll likely be doing something about that balance along the way since Spirits have the rarest flowers growing on their backs...

Yep, not a normal game this. There's no real combat, in lieu of that there's a minigame where you run after spirits (or take them by surprise using enviromental cover / invisibility potions), climb on their back and try to grab their flowers.
In defense the Spirit grows thorns and bombs. You have to press the buttons that are attached the flowers (more flowers) and to the bombs (less explosions in the face) whilst avoiding the buttons attached to thorns (because they're thorns).

It's not the deepest minigame ever, and you'll be playing it a lot, but there's a charm to it too, as there is to the entirety of the game.
There are 4 gorgeous areas in the game, a beachside town, a night-time town, a forest and... another town. They are decently sized, and filled with a variety of constructs to befriend and help out with little quests (~3-4 per area).
Among the way you'll be collecting flowers that grow around the area, smash pots to find gold and items useful for the mini-game, use keys (also found in jars or traded for flowers) to explore sealed off areas and find treasure chests containing a sizeable amount of gold and a Lore Item (collectible with a bit of backstory / reference).
That all sounds great, so what's the catch? The game is short, and you'll be doing just the things written above. An area can be cleared in ~20-40 minutes, clocking in the total game length at roughly 2 hours.
Other than that there are some technical hiccups, mostly related to achievements not triggering but I also got stuck a few times where the objective didn't tell me the correct next thing to do. Some of the older reviews actually mentioned problems so severe they had to restart to continue, this has since been patched out but it's still not the most flawless piece of code.
It was done by a team of five people though.

So, to summarize:
Pro:
[list][*]Gorgeous world and presentation
[*]Great protagonist
[*]Great secondary characters, both 'good' and 'evil'
[*]A plot that keeps you entertained[/list]

Cons:
[list][*]Short, like really short
[*]Technical hiccups
[*]Somewhat monotonous[/list]

All in all I'm super happy I picked up this game, and I look forward to what the developers will come out with next.

Controls are easy, just move around with arrow keys or wasd and use the mouse to click or interact with things. 

Story is very well picked aswell the characters roles and their personality. 

The main character is a girl, yes a good looking one tho. 

Everything else beside beating spirits to pluck their red flowers, kick vases and plucking white flowers. There are hats,pets  and outfits which are funny to wear. (note: you get a special outfit when you finished the game)

TIPS: Once you are able to buy things from the shop, buy the golden key and the treasure map and you are way to go. 

Of course you have to upgrade your items you wear too so you can walk faster and such. 

At least the game has one mini game which has a bug tho. If you are out of flowers and you get to the difficult select screen simply press escape and you play the game for free but you still get rewards if you won :P.


Just grab this game and have fun. Somehow this game keeps you hooked till you finished it.


The only downside of the game which isn't a real issue is the lack of voices of the characters. You might hear a giggle or someone saying hello or hi but thats it :(.

Last note: The game has replayability, because:
1: you need/want to get each spirit 3 stars (for achievements), 
2: upgrading the stealth skill instead of grip and speed only (achievement again :D), 
3: just for fun because the game has a nice story.

It's rather attractive and at times really humorous. There's a conscious, snarky kind of wit to it at times that I think is one of the major strengths in this game. It's very much aware of the type of game it is trying to be and I've always had a fondness for games that break the fourth wall so there's definitely no complaints from me about that. I love it. Give me more of it.

Lili? I actually really liked her as a main character. One of the main reasons I kept playing was to see what kind of sarcastic, funny little thing would come out of her mouth. The rest of the characters as well (and there are a lot of them that you can talk to) were great fun and I loved going around and talking to all of them. This is definitely a game that made me want to explore.

That being said...the actual premise of the game was pretty grating and got boring way too fast. Almost the entirety of the plot is made up of what is best described as a mini-game where you pick flowers off of villain characters. It's something that I can see working well on an iPhone game but as a computer game it is a little obnoxious. Even the side quests really amount to nothing more than open up a chest that is easily found and return the item in it to the person who mentioned it offhand.

The in-game menu can use some work too. Your quests/side-quests are listed in the most basic manner without really giving you information about it. And honestly, it's just...clunky and awkward looking.

Ich kann dieses Spiel zu diesem Preis leider nicht empfehlen, obwohl es eigentlich eine menge Potential hat.

PROs:

+ Sehr sch√∂ne Grafik/ Gutes Design (gerade f√ºr ein ehemaliges Mobile Spiel)
+ Interessantes Leveldesign
+ Obwohl es eigentlich nur ums einsammeln von Objekten geht, wird es nicht langweilig

CONs:

- Zu kurz! Und zu teuer!
- Die Welt ist viel zu Klein
- Einige Grafikfehler (Der √ºbergang von Hemd zu G√ºrtel beim Link Outfit)
- Eint√∂niges Design (Sammle drei rote Rosen)
- Beizeiten nerfige Steuerung (Man merkt das es urspr√ºnglich f√ºr Touchscreens designt wurde)

Fazit: Leider nicht zu empfehlen.

 F√ºr 20 ‚Ç¨ ist das Spiel zwar nicht allzu teuer, doch leider t√§uscht die nette Optik nur sehr begrenzt √ºber das eint√∂nige Missionsdesign hinweg. Das w√ºrde mir jetzt eigentlich f√ºr eine 6/10 reichen, aber daf√ºr ist das Spiel einfach zu kurz, ca. 4 Stunden hab ich gebraucht, und ich bin ziemlich lahm.

As someone who was looking for a change of pace from the average brown, explosion based gritty shooter, Lili: Child of Geos was an amazing pallet cleanser. A nice simple story set on a beautiful island with some really nice stand out characters and an easy yet enjoyable mechanic made for an enjoyable yet short experience that I would recommend to people looking for something a little different.

As mentioned above, the graphics in this game are superb, every area is crawling with life and every nook and cranny seems to have been paid a lot of attention. The character models as well are all unique and portray an enjoyable visual style that makes them feel much more alive as characters, even despite not being voiced. 

The dialogue of the game is light hearted and fun, even going so far as to almost break the fourth wall at times when mentioning some of the games obvious limitations. 

Sadly, the game isn't voice acted which feels like a slight let down. I feel it could of been the icing on the cake here but as mentioned the dialogue is interesting enough to read through. 

The actual second to second gameplay involves a lot of fetch quest like objectives and the whole game is very easy, you can complete it to 100% in about 4-6 hours but the gameplay isn't the draw here and sometimes the IOS roots of the game can be seen.  

Lili: Child of Geos is an experience more than a challenge, a nice vacation from the stressful and grim games that most of us play a lot and I loved it, here is hoping for a sequel!

This game is just like a modern Zelda. Except you can beat it in about 4 hours if you're a persistent person (like me).
Oh and it doesn't have actual boss fights, just quicktime-event-fights where you have to push the right buttons. (Controller recommended!)
But the game in general is just so beautiful and funny. Each character is unique and you'll start to love at least 3 of them pretty soon.

I enjoyed it much more the 2nd time, even though I thought it would be a chore to play through again. The characters were still amusing, the art and model work were still beautiful, even the 'fights' were more enjoyable than they were on the first playthrough. I have no idea why this would be, perhaps it's because I knew what not to expect from it 2nd time round. (I didn't really want to make my review any longer, but since my first impressions kind of sat on the fence, I thought it only fair to update it.)

[b]*edited as I feel my 'not so good  things' list was worded a bit more harshly than intended, also added to the good things list*[/b]

[b]Good Things:[/b]
+It's beautiful, no doubt about that.
+The character models are really well done.
+You can collect stuff. (Hats and pets and masks are usable.) (Lore items are useless they just go in to a collection page, but the descriptions can be fun to read.)
+Some of the dialogue is very humorous, and I have genuinely laughed out loud a few times, which I think is quite rare in most games. The humor feels very natural and not at all forced.
+some of the quests are well thought out and very enjoyable to do.
+most of the characters are quite memorable. I quite like the information fish.
+Haven't come across any bugs at all, it's as well polished as it looks. (UPDATE: achievement bugged for the locked doors)
+ Rematched 'fights' will spawn the opponent in the zone you're currently in.

[b]Not so good things:[/b]

-My number one in this list has to be the motion sickness.
There's currently 2 choices of camera movement ...
fps style is bad if you suffer from motion sickness.
mmo style is better but the camera still swings enough and there's a motion blur to the sides when you turn that may make you feel ill if you have this problem. Sometimes Lili runs into things you weren't expecting and the camera can stop in a nausea and dizziness inducing way, so if you're one of those people affected by this I'd keep in mind that this [b]may[/b] be a problem for you before buying it. For me this is ok to play in short bursts.

-you can buy 'new' outfits, but they're not new, they're just recolors of the original one, which given the attention to detail in the landscape and models made this a bit disappointing when I first came across the shop, although I do find it hard to imagine Lili wearing anything else.
Perhaps if there was another area of body customization like accessories (bangles, necklaces, leggings, face paint, belts, hair accessories etc) even the same outfit but a patterned shirt, logo on the shirt, butterfly on the shorts....anything, instead of just being recolored, and ideally, for me, these items would drop with a fairly low drop rate (instead of being bought) to make vase kicking and the associated achievement more fun.
There wouldn't be that much work involved in altering the mesh to turn the shorts in to a mini dress either, which I think would quite suit Lili. (edit: I see at the very end you unlock an outfit that is exactly this, which is a shame since it probably means we'll never see this mesh recolored or retextured since it's a ""special"" item.)
I'm a fan of loot and stuff to equip, what can I say :P

-""Fights"" are unique, but I don't enjoy them as much as I enjoy the quests, and since my play-time is limited due to the motion sickness, I've taken to ignoring them at this point (which isn't as game breaking as it sounds) and just doing the quests instead. I'll get them done eventually just for the achievements and the masks they drop (which are wearable) if you beat them with 3 stars.
I'd love to have the lore items be usuable as some kind of limited use tool in fights which would also make the collecting of those items and the fights themselves more entertaining.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I think the developers are still adding things to the game, so I'm going to go with recommend as there's still a chance of new things being added, and hopefully a 3rd camera option that's motion sickness friendly =D

For me, to be worth it's full asking price, it really needs more usable items and, given the lack of a real talent tree, some more variation in ways you can play to win the fights, like I said previously, I'd use the lore items to achieve this, giving them a purpose in the process.",1404661163,1406943650,True,7,0,0.611487090587615967,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You could easily burn through its content in a day but the majority of it sadly gets very repetitive very fast. At $20.00, it's a hard sell I'd argue.

You're dropped onto the island of Geos as Lili, a college student persuing a Vege-Magical degree, and become embroiled in a conflict between the island's ruling Spirits and their servant Constructs. Lili's pursuit is not entirely selfless (at first). She's here to study the flowers that dot the island, which most conveniently grow from the backs of the Spirits, forcing her to spend a majority of the game delicately plucking them from her enemies. 

As a central mechanic, the spirit combat is great and well realized. The chase to catch a spirit followed by the aforementioned flower picking is great fun, hampered only by the finicky controls thinking you want to stop and either pick flowers or smash jars when you're in hot pursuit. Lili's origins as a tablet game really show up here, as the plucking mechanic has you selecting a flower and dragging it away from a spirit to collect it.  It is fun perhaps the first handful of times, but given that there are over fifty spirits in the game to fight with little variety aside from the number of obstacles that crop up on a spirit, it does make the game's pacing drag if you are going for 100%. 

Geos has a lot of bright and colorful details to its world, and it is fun to just wander around the island and see what's in it as the Constructs go about their business. While not a fully realized world like in Deadly Premonition or Majora's Mask, where the characters all follow a set schedule, Geos nonetheless is a delight to get lost in for a few hours and take in the scenery.

It's also good to see Lili realized as a character; she has no love interest and she has no need of someone to come save her. As a plucky protagonist with ideas for what she wants to do with her life, Lili stands up for herself in a game that, while it has action, is at its core a non-violent experience, barring how you feel about picking flowers off the backs of monsters.

It's not a perfect game and suffers from having too many spirits to fight through, but for a quick delightful romp Lili's journey to Geos is one worth undertaking.",1404501845,1404501845,True,1,0,0.500297188758850098,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You play Lili, who visits an inhabited island to collect flowers for a school project. But she does not pick these flowers from the fields or gardens, she only picks the ones that grow along the streets and on the monsters.
Yes, this game features flower-picking based fighting. You chase a monster and then, during the actual fight, you pluck flowers off the monster. Maybe using the mouse makes it too easy, but I never lost one of these fights.
To be fair, this fighting model makes more sense on a touchscreen device. This is not as surprising since earlier editions of Lili: Child of Geos were published for mobile devices. And after all, it seems new and creative to me.

But the open world of Lili: Child of Geos offers a bit more than flower picking. You can explore, collect stuff, talk to people and solve sidequests which consist of exploring, collecting stuff and talking to people.
Lili: Child of Geos is rather short and small. It took me about three or four hours to do the main quests, all the side quests and get all the nonrespawning collectibles. 

On a more negative side, this game features no voice acting, only textboxes. 

So, was Lili: Child of Geos any fun for me? Yes, but not 20‚Ç¨ worth of fun, more like 10‚Ç¨.

It's not a shoddy port though; on the contrary, the graphics got a gigantic overhaul and it's very pretty to look at.

You are picking flowers, open chests for items (which have no value whatsoever aside from just collecting them) or kick pots for money (flowers can also be traded for money). Even the ""combat"" is a flower picking game. The money can be used for items that aid you in the game but it's so easy that it hardly matters at all. Quests are about going from A to B and back or finding something. That's about it. Even if you take your time in 4 to 6 hours you'll have found and seen about everything there is (that includes all side missions).

My other gripe is with the story / dialogue, which is inconsistent. Some of it is complete nonsense, and/or seems to not fit at all.

The mechanics are simple and easy to understand for gamers of most ages (granted those gamers can read), and the rest of the game is made to be a family friendly adventure. Combat and violence is replaced with a fun little mini-game (which feels awkward on the mouse at first, but you'll get used to it) where you chase enemy spirits across the island, hop onto their backs, and pluck Spirit Flowers off to weaken them while avoiding the thorns and bomb plants that grow there as well. After defeating a spirit you can earn a score and a rating measured in stars, if you earn 3 stars you'll also get a colored version of that spirits mask (there are also fifty unique spirits to encounter, so that means 50 unique masks to unlock). Outside of that minigame, the rest of the game sees you running or walking around the island of Geos, slowly unlocking new zones to explore freely and to find new spirits to defeat inside. The exploration of these zones remind me a little of The Wind Waker, as the island is bright, colorful, and actually very pretty (especially on the highest settings). Unlike Wind Waker though, there are no dungeons to explore (unfortunately) but there are a lot of fun little puzzles to undertake, quests to do for the wood-construct citizens of Geos, and every time you enter a zone, a whole batch of Spirit Flowers (the same kind that grow on the heads of Spirits) spawns in random places for you to collect. Unfortunately a few bugs appear where flowers will grow inside walls or under bridges or just places you can't reach, and there are the occasional clipping issues that block Lili off from small areas she should be able to access, or temporarily stick her into the environment (only happened once for me, but it took me five minutes of running in a circle to get her free), and the zones themselves really aren't too large. However you will find yourself scouring these zones over and over while hunting for spirits, treasure chests, and flowers and the zones are well designed and so different from each other they surprisingly don't get old after a few hours of playing, and with the flowers you find you can sell them for gold coins (used to buy outfits, upgrades, and powerups for taking on spirits), trade them for keys (one key will open any lock on the island, but is destroyed after each use) so you can loot or explore the various houses and shops on the island, or you can use the flowers to gamble with in a minigame I found quite easy (probably just because I have good eyes and reflexes) to try and earn even more gold coins.
      I bought the game on a whim because it was on sale and looked cute, and surprisingly it is now my favorite game of all time, simply because it is so fun, cute, and happy it always makes me feel good when I play, no matter how poopy I feel before loading it up. I've already finished the game (it is rather short unfortunately, but I've heard you can play it for about 40 hours before collecting every single hat, outfit, lore item, mask, pet, and completing every quest) but I want to keep playing it and try getting the game's other ending and explore the bird poop mechanic a little bit more. Yes, there is a bird poop mechanic where if you run too fast while scaring birds, the poor things will fly away and poop all over Lili, leaving rainbow colored droppings all over the girls face and clothes (this always makes me laugh because she always has a calm smile on her face throughout the game).
     So would I recommend this game? Yes, however the majority of Hardcore gamers probably wouldn't like the game for much more than the billions of references to Dark Souls, Oregon Trail, Mario, Zelda, Minecraft, Prometheus (yes, the movie), and much more. Children would probably love the colors and characters, but a lot of jokes and dialogue would probably be wasted on them. But if you're a total nerd who wants to play a peaceful game that'll just make you laugh and give you at least 3 to 5 hours of sheer happiness (that's the minimum time to beat the storyline), you'll probably love it as much as I do.",1403984092,1403984092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Even though the controls with the controller are neither configurable nor actually explained, it works well. Every key binding for the items are displayed for keyboard only which may lead to some item waste as you try and figure out which controller button does which. But control is tight and during the spirit fights the controller buttons are shown correctly.

There's no speech in the game, but that - for me - only added to the charm. I felt reminded a lot of the Wind Waker, one of my favourite games as a kid. The inspiration clearly came from that game.

Unfortunately, the game is awfully short. You only need 3-4 hours to collect everything and defeat every spirit. The items are not really necessary here - though I only played on normal. And even though the game is so short, the fights with the spirit get a tad repetative near the end. Defeating all 52 of them brings nothing to the game, and almost every fight is the same. And replay value is nigh zero, the story is linear and everything is collectible in the first run.

Colorful, cute, plenty of detail in the environments and (mostly) sharp textures. 

But gameplay wise you can tell it was designed with mobiles in mind, because there's a mini-game where you have to use the mouse to pluck flowers and the gameplay and story are rather shallow. 
The player has to find red flowers by chasing spirits and solve mini-quests ('quests' would be too big of a word, since they usually take a couple of minutes to complete), among other things (like plucking white flowers and opening treasure chests). That's all there is to it really. There isn't much to do, except for a couple of small sidequests.

You can also level up the character in several ways, but these character upgrades are mostly useless because I didn't seem to experience much of an improvement. Experienced gamers in general won't find the gameplay difficult anyway. There's no health bar, you can't die. The only thing that can happen is that you get thrown off the back of a spirit and even then you can try again without any problems. And there are also potions that you can use to speed up your character, make her invisible or that allow you to throw a bomb in order to stun enemies.

Lili Child Of Geos also isn't a long game. I was able to complete it in 2-3 hours. Which was more than enough because the gameplay becomes very repetitive after these couple of hours.

I still think the game is worth the money, if only for the beautiful graphics and for the first few areas. And who knows, maybe they can flesh things out for a possible sequel, make things a bit more interesting ? I'd like to see one, in any case.

For people that are really into collecting items, and exploring every nook and cranny of games, this would be a must have for you. Picking flowers can also be done by jumping on the back of spirits and plucking all their flowers of their heads, to find the rare red flowers.

FIrst of all this isn't a Zelda-type ARPG like you might think (I'm the first being guilty to buy everything for PC labeled Zelda-like) by looking around the reviews as all battles actually take place in a wonky mini-game meant for touch-screens. It has the feel of Zanzarah without the fairy battles.
It's casual play, short and riddled with some bugs especially the achievements. You only have a single save-slot. At 20 bucks it's overpriced, should be 10 butr devs need to feed their kids and all that.

You do run around, talk to strange people, do them quests, smash pots for items, pick flowers and get equipment still I'd file this as an action-adventure. At the core it's a collectathon.

It is a pretty game though with a cute protagonist and an addictive gameplay so yes recommended. It's also safe for kids. Just don't go in having high expectations and get it when it's on sale.

Pros:
- Visuals are gorgeous. It does not look at all like a mobile port and has some of the best visuals I've come across in an indie game.
- Fully 3D world that you can wander around in at your own pace.
- Nice atmosphere. The island is populated with lots of whimsical characters and the game oozes charm.
- Non-violent, suitable for children old enough to have a fair degree of reading comprehension but also accessible for adults. (I realize this may be a con for some who are looking for a more meaty sort of game)
- Unique. It's a bit different than pretty much everything else out there.

Cons:
- Not the greatest value considering the price to length ratio. I like short games but $20 for a few hours play feels a bit steep to me.
- Game play is rather repetitive. You do the same few things for the entire game, namely collect items and play the same sort of quicktime mini game in lieu of actual battles. This is somewhat forgivable given the very short length of the game however.
- The 4 zones are small and there's not much interaction with the environment.
- Story is rather thin and there is no intro; you just get plopped in.
- [strike]Only partial controller support. The developer states full controller support is in the works. At present you can run around the world, collect items, check your map and talk to npcs with the controller but going into menus and playing the mini game battles requires keyboard and mouse.[/strike]
- Full controller support has now been added. Sort of. They basically did a virtual mouse pointer that the left analog stick controls but it feels very shoehorned in as an afterthought rather than controls designed around a controller. Control directions in the UI still don't reference the controller when you are using it either.

Neutral:
- RPG elements are quite lite. That's not a con. The game is what it is, but calling the game an ""RPG hybrid"" while not technically incorrect, may give an inaccurate impression. There's some very minor leveling and skill progression but don't expect hitpoints, skill trees and such.
- No voice acting. The game is fine without it but I feel it would have added that extra bit to draw you in even more. Also it would allow for younger children to play. As non-violent games are somewhat rare, it seems especially suited for young children but the amount of reading creates a bit of an age barrier.
- Feels like a missed opportunity in some ways. The visuals and atmosphere are excellent and the game well done as is, but part of me feels like it could have been so much more with more variety and length.
- A couple of aspects still feel like a game created around touch input, namely the mini game where you pull flowers which is a major part of the game. Also the level up menus with the big wide buttons to hit and just the general sort of largeness of the UI. These do work just fine with a mouse though.
- The battle / mini games on the keyboard and mouse have a totally different feel than on the controller. The former has a more tactile almost Angry Birds type of feel with pulling while the latter feels more like DDR. I'm not sure which I like better. They're very different.

I enjoyed Lili for what it was, a unique, short, charming and visually stunning adventure game but part of me wished it to be more than it was, that it were much longer, the quests more complex, that Lili had companions, there were more choices etc. The game does end leaving future adventures for Lili a possibility so perhaps a sequel could be based around the PC platform from the beginning this time and more complex. It's a fun possibility to contemplate.

This isn't to say that Lili is incomplete. It's not, it's just a short and casual game. Sometimes it's nice to have those as a break or when you don't want to get into huge commitment with a new game. 

The $20 price point I feel is a bit high for the short length of the game but if this sort of game appeals to you I'd recommend it when it goes on a sale.",1399792403,1402856763,True,418,0,0.957112908363342285,8,True,False,False,False,,,

4/10

First of all i have to say: If you buy the game, you probably won't get what you've expected. The game itself is a charming little piece of entertainement, but after reading the steam-description i just expected something completly different. I would not say that it's an RPG ( but some might call it one); To me, it just doesnt look like an RPG, more like a game that's made to have some points an RPG needs while beeing a mix of puzzle, minigames and collecting stuff. For example: You get something like a ""Skilltree"" but it doesn't really matter where you put your points, since you won't get any new abilities. As I said, the game is okay, its colorful, it cheers you up when playing it, but it is not what steam promises you.

The game itself is, as i said, a mix between puzzling, running around, minigames and collecting stuff (a lot of stuff). If you're into that, you'll be just fine, but if you hate spending too much time running back and forth while collecting items that add absolutely nothing to the game, then you'd might regret buying this. 

The Graphics are pretty good, but I was told to have low standarts. The Characters are lovely designed and you can feel that the developers really cared about every single friend or foe you face throughout the game. However, the story is rather basic. I don't want to spoil anything, so just let me say this: The story feels like a weak version of another game (if you know what i mean.. you probably don't.) There's just not much depth in the story, you spend way too less time with the characters to really get into it. When I first saw the game i kind of expected a heavy story, so i was a little disappointed. But again, not every story has to be deep.

The gameplay is very repetitive, but this does not matter that much because the game is rather short. Just let me tell you, the ""quests"" you get sound all the same, you have 3 items you can use and every ""battle"" is exactly like the one you fought before. 

Overall Lili; Child of Geos is a game to play when you don't want to start a biiiig, looong game with a deep story. Its a game you choose to play when you have little time but still want to enjoy a good game. I personally give it a thumbs down because it is a fine little game, but nothing like you'd expect after reading the description.",1399758327,1399758368,False,135,0,0.601081371307373047,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Gameplay-wise [i]Lili: Child of Geos[/i] is a very short game. I'd estimate around three hours of casual play. If you're going for collectibles and a perfect ranking against all enemies you may add two or three extra hours of game time. It's not a very challenging game either if you play on easy or medium. During the game you will attempt to ""de-flower"" spirits walking about the game world. You do this by playing a sort of minigame where you drag and drop flowers and other items off a spirit's head. You can tell this game mechanic was designed for the use of a touchscreen, which isn't too strange as this is a PC remake of a mobile game, but the developers made it work fairly well with a mouse. Depending on your skill, you'll master this part of the game quickly. It does get progressively harder as the game goes on, but it never reaches a level that will really challenge you and have you retry beating a spirit more than a couple of times. I have yet to play the hardest difficulty setting though. There are three settings, of which I played the middle one.

Controls are a bit wonky. Camera control takes a bit getting used to. Mouse sensitivity have only four presets which is the part I found the most annoying about the game. Some weird collisions here and there. Otherwise well made. 

Would I recommend it? Yes, but try to find a bit of gameplay to watch before you decide whether or not to purchase [i]Lili: Child of Geos[/i]. It's a game best enjoyed if you go at it with a relaxed attitude. If you're up for exploration and fun in short bursts. It would be easier to recommend this game if it had been cheaper. I don't really think the price suits the length or content of the game. But all in all I'm having fun with it.",1399742735,1399742735,True,5,0,0.512477993965148926,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However something is not quite right on the island and you soon discover that the constructs (creatures created from wood) are slaves to their masters; the spirits and their Mayor.

You decide to unshackle the local natives from their forced labour by doing them favours in exchange for flowers and other rare items. The island is full of life, its characters witty and charming where I couldn't help but laugh at some of the dialogue that was exchanged.

Where its similarities between Zelda lie are based around the Islands and town hubs which you would find in a Zelda game.
Imagine taking those areas from Wind Waker and putting them on this island. The exchange of dialogue is something you would find straight out of a Zelda game. Don't expect voiced characters but instead small sound bites like ""Hi"", ""Bye"" and other gasps throughout the dialogue.
Don't expect to be crawling dungeons and having a boss fight. This is not where its comparison with Zelda lies.

There are lots of Easter eggs to discover throughout the Island in treasure chests that reference some classic Nintendo games. Another character will throw some Video game trivia at you, asking you to guess what game it is referencing. ""Praise the Sun"".

Hats can be found in treasure chests and by doing services for the locals. Masks can be unlocked by beating Spirits.

As a collectathon it has similarities to Banjo-Kazooie. Achievements are awarded for smashing pots, finding treasure and picking flowers.
Fighting in the game is composed of hopping on the back of a Spirit and attempting to pluck flowers from its back while they put obstacles in your way such as thorns and bombs.

There is currently only partial controller support, with the mouse really only needed for the Spirit fights and closing menus. I'm sure adding a button binding for B to close menus will soon come in an update. I am unsure how Battling the spirits with a controller will work though. Its interaction seems more suited to a mouse or tablet, although the developers have said in the forum they are working on full controller support.

Overall I would highly recommend the game if you grew up playing Nintendo games like Zelda, Banjo or Mario.

While there is no platforming involved, a mixture of all these games can be found in Lili: Child of Geos.
The graphics are just downright gorgeous and full of colour. The music sounds like something that belongs in a Zelda game. It's a casual adventure game with some very basic RPG elements that involve levelling up your Speed, Grip and Stealth.

I haven't played a game like this since the N64.",1399728698,1399728925,True,12,0,0.57165449857711792,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I've never had such a fun time collecting flowers and strange garbage from chests in a long time. Just don't go into this expecting Zelda-like combat or something similar to Banjo-Kazooie. You're simply plopped onto a charming little island that can simply be described as something out of a dream.

Here's a Quick Look video to see what the game is like, since it's hard to describe with words. But if that's not your thing, then just read my quick and concise review below.

http://youtu.be/E2t3cuWZZs8

I'll begin by describing the basic mechanics of this game. You play as girl named Lili who is an explorer, and she comes to the island to collect flowers for a report she's doing. You get these special flowers by finding spirits--basically human logs with masks--straddling onto their backs, and plucking white flowers that pop up on their backs until you reach the red one that you need. A fun little mini-game that's somewhat challenging if you're going for the best rank. The other things you'll be doing to progress the story are exploring the village, talking to the inhabitants, and generally exploring for neat things to collect.

But what makes this game so charming? The game's art style is truly breathtaking. It makes the game's main feature of exploring even more enjoyable when there's so many interesting things to see. I even enjoy scaring away birds and laughing at the rainbow turds they leave behind occasionally. Even talking to the local inhabitants is a joy. They have no qualms making fun of themselves and enjoy pointing it out to you. I found it very refreshing to actually WANT to talk to every NPC and find out what their story was. Not many games can pull something like that off.

Other neat features the game has is the ability to chose how you want to upgrade yourself. You can choose to upgrade your speed, grip, or stealth however you wish to suit the playstyle you enjoy. You can also purchase upgrades in a wide range without much restriction. Personally I chose to get a map and key early rather than items to help me fight spirits since I just like exploring more. But if none of that is your thing, you can also just unlock different color swaps for Lili to make her look even more adorable. The choice is yours.

However, this game does come with a few negative.
*I found a game-breaking bug early on. I had collected all of the flowers on the map before hitting up the trainer, who wanted me to collect 5 FRESH flowers. And since none were left, I couldn't progress the game. (I've found out another work-around for this is just quiting and loading your save again. However, I still think it's an issue if you have to do such a strange thing just to continue the game, so I'll leave this as a negative.)
*[strike]Because of the above, I also found out that there isn't multiple save slots. I had to delete my old game if I wanted to start fresh.[/strike]
*There isn't an voice acting besides the occasional ""Hi"" and what not. While it's not really a big deal for me, I'm sure some people might not like the fact a game with such interesting characters in it aren't voiced. It could've added a lot more to the experience if they found voice actors to bring more life into this already vivid and imaginative game.
*[strike]While you can use a controller to play this game, it hides the fact that you can use it. And unfortunately, you can't even use the controller to play certain parts of the game. Sometimes you have to use the mouse to click off the screen when you collect a new relic. Or when you mount a spirit, you have to switch to the mouse real fast to play the mini-game.[/strike]
*Some people may take issue with the price of the game since it's cheaper on the iOS. However, you're not getting the same experience as you will here, and you can always wait for a sale. But still, I'll list this as a negative just so people know.

But even with those few minor negatives--and I say minor because it was only the beginning of the game where I had to start over--I highly recommend anyone to pick up this game if they want a laid-back adventure with good humor. This game makes me feel like a little boy again. I was just curious about everything, and it's been a long time since any game has done this for me.",1399701140,1401096567,True,132,2,0.798676252365112305,4,True,False,False,False,,,

I just dropped the full asking price for this game only to then find out its 1/8th of the price on IOS. However, that is not my biggest problem... The game is simply not what you are likely expecting from reading the store page and looking at the videos and screenshots. Like they mention in the store, I was expecting a Zelda like experiance and that is simply not what you have here...

I feel the game is aimed towards 5 - 10 year old children and the mention of ""RPG"" while accurate by definition it is NOT what I think 95% of you guys out there class as ""RPG"". 

If you have children and you want to get them a simple game that you can play together then this would be perfect... However, if you are the ""typical 13-30"" year old bloke... There are likely games much cheaper that would give you more enjoyment. In short... Not the type of game the store page would leave you to believe. Would be great for young children, parents and people that enjoy their point and click/collection games.",1399698404,1399698454,False,64,0,0.488439798355102539,5,True,False,False,False,,,

As ports go, many developers do not do a high quality end result. But I have been surprised as it has clearly been reworked with higher texture packs, a new UI and more content.

There are 2 things that could do with some work. The mouse control feels laggy and takes some getting used to. The other thing is how often achievement popups occur. It feels far too frequent.

Over all I am enjoying Lili. It reminds me of Legend of Zelda and Banjo Kazooie.

Unsure if it is worth $20 but that is up to you to decide.
