I can't recomend this game as it is, while the controls and mechanics are good, the game is too repetitive due to lack of variety of stages, enemies and the lack of an end just makes it even more terribly obvious. There's a high score list but even if you're a high score chaser, you can find better games in which invest your time.

==Full Review Below==
[h1] Story:[/h1] 
space eyeballs attack your  space ship killing everybody because they crave for moustaches, now you have to kill them all before they kill you and take yours too.

[h1] Controls:[/h1] 
You can chose from using keyboard + mouse (move with the keyboard and aim with the mouse) or a controller (aim with the sticks). Both of them are very responsive with the keyboard being the ideal one imo. 

[h1] Gameplay:[/h1] 

[u]Game Layout:[/u]

The game consists of stages full of explosive tanks, chikens(why?), eyeball monsters and zombies where you have to find a switch to unlock a door, reach said door to get pickups and then go to the next stage. after 4 stages you fight a boss and go to a ""new area"", repeat this 4 times to fight the final boss. After beating it you start over again but with your equipment. There's no ending sequence or anything, you just start over again. 

[b] This at the start confused me since i thought i had just to clear some more stages to reach the ending. I didn't know this is just an endless cycle of beating the same stages and bosses over and over again rilling up score till you die.[/b] 

The stages while randomized are really repetitive in how they all have the same look: dark, with a tv filter on top with 0 ambient variation, everything looks like the same stage over and over again.

[u]Enemies:[/u]

You will find a small variety of eyeball enemies (around 7); 
>turret type
>air chasers type (2 types)
>spider jumping type
>spawning types who spawn chaser types (2 types)
>giant floating eyes
From which only 2 have 2 stronger palette swap version, there are also powered up version of the spider and chaser types with moustaches sticked on them making them sturdier.

There are also these sort of zombies which come in 3 varieties: 
>normal: slow
>toxic: using a radioactive suit, they explode into a lasting poison cloud after killed.
>gunner: they carry rifles that shoot 3 bullets at the same time.
All of them require just 1 hit to die and just stand there unless they notice you (then they either walk slowly or shoot)

There are 5 bosses fights each different from the other but still pretty basic of just dodge big attacks while shooting as fast as you can at them.

[u]Survivality: [/u]

You have only one life, once you die, your run ends and you have to start over again from 0.
You can either heal by using medikits, leveling up or using perks that allow you to heal in frenzy mode. Medikits activate automatically if you recieve letal damage, letting you survive attacks that would otherwise killed you.

[u]-Skills:[/u]

At the start of the game can pick from different types of moustaches for your character, each gives different pros and cons to playstyle, there are 4 in total (3 have to be unlocked) and each one levels up with every run providing bigger bonuses as they do.

There's a frenzy mode called stache power that you can active after killing a certain amount of enemies , this mode gives you infinite ammo for a period of time and can give you even more benefits if you pick up perks that buff it (infinite jump, full heal when activated, invicibility while it lasts, etc)

Perks are gotten after 5 level ups, you can pick one from 3 perks each time. each one either powers up your attack, speed, defense or buffs your stache time. the only exception is a perk that allows you to unlock crates without keys which is ideal if you want to get money to unlock bonuses for next runs. 

You can get extra perks via hats which are created with stache tokens in a randomized style giving you a max of 3 perks per hat.

[u]Weapons and pickups:[/u]

You will find a wide range of 18 weapons. they can be unlocked to being your run with them or picked up during the game. Some weapons are more useful than others (shotgun, wifi-gun are way better than most weapons except the deathray) since they can be exploited during stache power to clear half of the stage due to their wide range and potency.

[h1]Music:[/h1]  (subjective)

Nothing out of this world, while it's ok, you won't want to listen it outside of this game nor are they that memorable that you will remember them if you were to listen to them somewhere else. The music track is randomized at the start of each stage and it will stay with you till you use stache mode, then you will get a different one till you either go to another stage or use stache mode again. 

[h1] Replay value:[/h1] 

While the game is made to be played multiple times, once you realize this doesn't even have an end you don't really have an incentive to play it again. Your run will  be doing clearing the same stages and killing the same bosses over and over again... till you die. Your score is recorded and if high enough you're put on the top score list which isn't a big deal (got to top 6 just by clearing the game twice looking for a real ending that never came).",1498702118,1498702275,False,11,1,0.637022554874420166,1,False,True,True,False,,,

I must say, this is a very well built, fast paced game. It carrys the traits of Risk of Rain and Thing Thing. The goal is to pass through multiple stages, beat the boss, and do it again a few more times to beat the ""floor"". I want to say the maps are randomly generated, but i also think a few of the levels are built (meaning they are the same every time), such as the first level. You level up your 'Stache, buy new ones, each giving you a different ability, and use xp/money earned to buy new weapons and test your luck in a makeshift hat, machine, where you have the chance of getting better perks with each hat.

All in all, this is a vigorous, run-n-gun, bullet hell game that I would thoroughly look into getting. It gives off the classic flash-style feeling (Thing-Thing/Thing-Thing Arena), and is priced as such. I agree with the price.

Overall Grade: 85/100

-5pts for bugs (explosions heal perk does not work)
-5pts for repetitiveness - I will justify - the enemies (or from what ive seen) do not change. You face the same ones, which isnt a problem as there is a variety, but they all look a little similar. You will also find yourself dying from the same ones (the grey eyes that blend in to the background and explode on contact, their deployers, and 3-legged jumpers)
-5pts for boss/weapon dmg - justify - the giant bazooka of doom (forget the name at the moment) is an insta-kill on most bosses with 1 shot.

Overall, i recommend this game. There are a few bugs and quirks, but nothing game breaking, and nothing that will keep it too easy.

I love the short funny comments in the loading screens!

Now onto some of the cons.. There aren't many to name but here we go:
-There isn't really a storyline
-Very small almost unnoticeable performance issues (program became non responsive during loading a few times)
-The game has very good music. It is well produced. There just isn't enough music
-Some of the in-game text is hard to read
-More color, less black. Black is a filler color in games. It makes me feel like the developpers just didn't want to fill in the areas that are complete blackness
-Level designs are very repetitive

Now these are just small things that I have noticed. Overall, this game is very well done. There are even many finished games that people will find very little things.

[b]Discovery:[/b] Steam's ""Featured and Recommended"" tab on the storefront 
[b]Method of acquisition:[/b] Review Copy
[b]Reason for purchase:[/b] I like platformers and rogue-likes
[b]Completion:[/b] Beaten the final boss twice

[h1] [b]Overview[/b] [/h1]

Rogue Stache is a crazy and fun-filled rogue-like platformer. It's retro styled with a modern feel. This game follows the last manly man alive, after every other man was mutilated and de-moustached. From the opening cut-scene till the last boss, Rogue Stache will have you hooked with its insane bloody combat and huge collection of hats.

[h1][b] Components[/b] [/h1]

[b]Visuals[/b] - The general visual style of this game is retro 16 bit styled graphics (to my knowledge). It's fairly pretty for the most part. My favourite visual aspect of this game is the enemy design, particularly the bosses. They felt unique and really creative, making them more of a joy to battle against. However, the visual aspect falls a bit short on the level design, for each level seems simplistic and looks repetitive, and each stage is almost identical save for a different colour palette. The visual effects are pretty good, you'll see TONS of blood from shooting enemies, and the explosions and weapon projectiles are fairly good. All in all, Rogue Stache delivers solid, yet improveable graphics.

[b]Audio[/b] - The game has a few music tracks, but they sound really good and fit well. The sound effects are great and every attack or action is accompanied with a sound effect. The sound design is reminiscent of classic retro styled games and overall they've done a fairly good job.

[b]Gameplay[/b] - Rouge Stache is a rogue-like platformer, where each level requires pushing a button to open the exit door before proceeding to the next level. There's 4 stages, each with 5 levels, and a boss at the end of each stage. After beating all 4 bosses, you will fight the final boss. Firstly, the actual platforming feels responsive and well polished, so it delivers in that aspect. The shooting is spot on, and every gun has its use. One thing I didn't like was the fact that gun drop-rate was way too high, because on the first level alone I had every inventory slot filled and there was still more guns I couldn't pick up. The levels aren't procedurally generated, there's only a bunch of preset levels, however enemies, loot, the button and everything else is randomised. I found the game to get slightly repetitive due to a lack of unique levels. One awesome feature I really liked, and which greatly extended the longevity of the game, was the hat spin machine. Using tokens acquired through gameplay, you can spin the hat wheel machine to get a random hat with random positive attributes (such as extra inventory, extra jump, more health etc). It's really fun trying out different hats with their different abilities and they are really helpful. Overall, the gameplay of Rogue Stache is fairly mediocre but offers fun and unique gameplay elements.

[b]Story[/b] - After every other man has been mutilated and their moustaches taken, it is up to you to save mankind by eliminating all the enemies. There's not much of a story here but it gives you a bit of context, which is all that's really needed for this sort of game.

[b]Functionality[/b] - Generally, this game runs quite smoothly but in the midst of heavy action, especially using explosives against crowds of enemies, the game really starts to slow down. The optimisation could be improved slightly, but for the most part it runs well. I encountered no glitches or issues while playing. Overall, Rogue Stache is a well functioning game but suffers from minor performance hiccups.

[h1][b] Pros[/b] [/h1]
[list]
[*] Hats with random attributes
[*] Lots of enemies and lots of guns to shoot them with
[*] Very bloody
[*] Solid platforming and shooting mechanics
[/list]
[h1][b] Cons[/b] [/h1]
[list]
[*] Level design is fairly mundane and repetitive
[*] Very short game, only took me an hour before I was able to kill the final boss
[*] Performance issues
[*] Lack of unique levels
[/list]
[h1] [b]Conclusion[/b] [/h1]

In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun and hectic rogue-like platformer, then Rogue Stache may be the game for you.
I give this game a 5/10 - a well made platformer which is fun and unique, but lacking content

[h1] Bonus Early Access Review for the Developers [/h1]

While this game is in Early Access, I suggest that the performance issues are fixed. I also suggest adding more room variations, more guns and enemies, and more bosses. I also suggest that you add a hard mode, because I found the game fairly easy. And add a couple more music tracks too.",1489059281,1489059757,True,3,0,0.424543827772140503,0,False,True,True,False,,,

Onto the Review.

I don't normally do platformers as i am abhorrent at them. But this game...This GREAT game appeals to me in so many ways.
The guns, wow, the guns! From the simple lazer you start off with through to the Death Ray, they all operate differently and most have a kick on them.
The hats, they do not detract from the gameplay, they genuinely add tons to the game. Gotta collect them all!
Levelling up 'Staches...Legendary. Whoever thought of this has officially won 2017 in my book.

In short, Hate platformers normally. Streamed this, Loved this, please buy it, some of mah viewers did based on my reactions and ""the Stache""",1486367273,1486367273,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,True,False,,,
