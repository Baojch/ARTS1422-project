In a secret laboratory hidden away from the world, a team of scientists were conducting a top-secret experiment. They had spent countless hours pouring over research, perfecting their techniques, and manipulating the building blocks of life. Finally, after months of work, they had created something truly amazing.

With a flick of a switch and a flash of light, a creature like humanity came into being. It was a being unlike anything the world had ever seen before, with skin that shimmered like gold and eyes that glowed with an otherworldly light.

As the creature was brought out of its chamber and into the world for the first time, the scientists watched in amazement as it took its first steps. It was a being of incredible intelligence and strength, capable of feats that defied human explanation.

But the creature was not content to simply be a scientific experiment. It hungered for knowledge and understanding, seeking out new experiences and exploring the world around it. It was a being of infinite curiosity, constantly pushing the boundaries of what was possible.

As the creature grew and evolved, it began to develop emotions and a sense of self. It became clear that this was not simply a scientific experiment, but a being with its own desires and dreams.

Eventually, the creature came to understand that it was not alone in the world. It met other beings like itself, and together they explored the mysteries of the universe. They formed a community of creatures like humanity, each one unique and wondrous in its own way.

And though the scientists who had created it watched from afar, marveling at their creation, they realized that they had given birth to something truly special. A being unlike any other, capable of changing the world in ways they could not even imagine. And as the creature continued to grow and thrive, it brought with it a sense of wonder and magic that filled the world with new possibilities.",1681217117,1683074208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It is a game to enjoy for the story, the puzzles(some of which are BRUTAL but not impossible). It has an AWESOME journal / photo system; the game takes pics of every clue that is discovered that might be important so we, the player have it handy.   The story is explained as we progress through the journal too. Great back ground music; not intrusive but I felt it added another dimension to the game.

- No trading cards.

I played part 1 (Blackwater Asylum/The Witch's Prison) years ago when I first got into these games, and when I found out there was supposed to be a part 2, I waited another couple of years to be able to buy it. And I have to say it was just as good as the first game. So first, the good points:

Plotline:

Basically it picks up where the first part left off (so I'd recommend playing part 1 first, it's not entirely necessary but would make it much more enjoyable) and has the same sort of dark vibe. While not the most realistic storyline (not many of these games are remotely realistic anyway) it's not the silliest, you can play it without being very actively aware that it's a totally childish exercise. I mean fair enough, these games are usually for like 7 to 12 year olds apparently, they're pretty tame and a total guilty pleasure for grown-ass adults but at least this one doesn't feel like it's meant for little kids. Adequately dark for my liking, with a hint of silliness in parts.

General gameplay:

Unlike many of my games, this is not in fact a HOG. In fact- you'll see what I mean if you play- it quite blatantly pokes fun at HOG's with that little bit of silly humour you'll find in it occasionally. If you played the first one, you'll know this already. So, it plays a bit like a room escape adventure game- or a HOG without, well, the hidden objects, I guess. That makes it a bit less tedious and fun in my opinion, but it's a matter of taste. 

The game is a decent length, and doesn't seem too rushed, which is another bonus for me.

Graphics, sound and cutscenes:

Cutscenes are tasteful, although the graphics aren't the most realistic they do very little characters moving around- the cutscenes are in pictures as opposed to dramatized scenes- so it lacks that corny element that makes me so uncomfortable in some other games. On occasion characters move, but it's done well enough. The sounds are good, none of this overbearing background music distracting you while you play.

There are only a couple of slight niggles for me: primarily, the fact that it can be very difficult to find where you need to go at times and you don't get much help- that can make it challenging, or a bit frustrating depending on your mood. 

Another issue, that I should mention, was with my PC (I have no idea how it will function for other players) the first time I tried this game it glitched when it froze and my PC crashed, deleted an inventory item, and left me having to start over. The next time, nearer the end, bits of the screen went white and eventually all of the screen, and it had to be played in windowed mode to resolve that. I don't know if it's a bit glitchy in general or if my PC just isn't right for it, but generally my PC works fine with the vast majority of these games and this one was just a bit awkward, but still functioned for the most part. 

That aside, this game was really good fun, and I will most definitely be playing it again.

Normally I play entire point and click games without any help or walkthroughs...well rarely at least, but this game was something else. I felt I was absolutly more interested in the story of the game, than many of the puzzles. There was also alot to read, so I'll guess I kinda got impatient (for a really patient guy normally).

Because of the lack of achievements (I am happy for that this time), it was simpler to just push the hint button frequently or skip a puzzle, just to see the story....I tend to want to know how I solve a puzzle though, but a few of the minigames in this game I couldn't understand. So frustrating.

In the end. I like that there was a good story, many fun puzzles, and a few horror elements.

I'm gonna end it here with something weird. Whenever I started the game or alt tabbed, the game had to reload every single time. It didn't take a second, but almost half a minute each time, and that is really strange for a point and click game. The first game in this serie took only one second. I'll guess computer power doesn't mean a thing for this game.

Recommend buying these two ""Nightmare adventure"" games in a bundle. If I am not wrong there will come more games in this serie, so watch out that too.",1499577154,1499577277,True,7,0,0.62276005744934082,7,True,False,False,False,,,
