While this runs fine on my four year old machine, the one I had prior lagged like mad despite exceeding the minimum requirements.

The machines in this are not remotely realistic in their operation, yet this somehow feels more like a simulator than any of the other heavy equipment games on Steam. For instance, turning the excavator too sharply while rolling downhill at speed will rip off one or both track belts. One can also easily roll any of the vehicles if they try and climb or descend any hill on too steep of an angle. Dozing some dirt is very satisfying, as provided you don't try and load the blade too much in one go you can bite into and cut through most of the map hills pretty easily within ten minutes of playing. If you're looking at this solely as an achievement hunter, you can 100% the game in a little under three hours with a bit of trial and error on two of the eleven levels.

I do have one fairly major complaint, switching vehicles resets dirt piled around or in them. While not a bad thing in theory, this means you can't treat the stake bed truck as a dump truck and load it with dirt like I'd love to do - once you tab from the excavator to it the dirt just teleports underneath the truck and solidifies, usually trapping your rig partly in the ground.

I really like The Little Crane That Could, but if you're like me and enjoy stretching your money I strongly suggest waiting for a 50% off or greater discount. Once you complete the objective levels and achievements the sandbox mode gets stale fast and you won't rack up much time on this one before uninstalling.",1591066284,1591066284,True,6,0,0.566395819187164307,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a fun game, isn't easy, but you won't be pulling your hair out, or taking a hammer to your computer. Once you finish the levels, you can have some fun in the sandbox mode, which is exactly what it sounds like. You are in a box of sand, only unlike most games, you get to move the sand. You have an assortment of vehicles, which is a pickup truck, a flatbed with side guards, a crane on a flatbed, an excavator, and your dozer. They feature full control, which is rotation, elevation, bending, length, and your attachment (bucket or claw). With that, you can make just about whatever you want to in the dirt, such as tunnels and circuits for your pickup truck.

Shame about the control issue as I bought it thinking my 3 year old would love it as he is digger mad.

It is I guess a tablet game rather then PC for example the scenary looks like its in FOG and you cant see very far. In fact you can see it draw the scenary as you drive.

GTX 660 and an i3 but like I say the game really should not require this to run smoothly.

I will be honest it steam did refunds then I would be asking for one.",1430519633,1430519633,False,10,0,0.455002099275588989,10,True,False,False,False,,,

Sadly, this version (i.e the one included with the day one release) falls short. First impressions are weak indeed, with no keyboard control over the camera (and this being totally essential for even the first mission), and a highly limited soundset(simply put, the engine noise loop is too short and rather grating when it's the only sound in the world).

After connecting a 360 Pad to enjoy the controller support (which is indeed global, sufficent to select a level and navigate the limited options) things improved somewhat, the responsive controls very reminiscent of the mobile version. Also reminscent of the mobile version, however, is the very limited draw distance - keeping track of your surroundings when away from buildings is a bit of a challenge, though the authenticity of the minimap is welcome!

I'll curtail this review and give you some basic ups and downs.

UP:
Physics are pretty solid and the vehicles feel like the chunky toys they're modeled after.
Still has some of the charm from the small-screen editions.
Nice, relatively readable UI font (Think of the Wip3out font only you can actually read it).
Cross platform! Any game that runs on Linux is very welcome!

DOWN:
Very weak and limited sound set.
Limited fun without a controller.
Small selection of levels and no free-play option (nor is there a level editor).
No configuration except from the most basic and essential (The stick configuration bent my brain at first, Turning on left-stick steering really helped!)
360 pad is not really a precise enough controller. I would love to break out the twin joysticks and set the game up to use them, but alas this isn't a supported option.

In summary:
I feel like this is still a tech demo, and that it's swinging above it's station somewhat in price. Wait until it's 50% off and I'd say you've got a game that will provide a few hours of entertainment (with the sounds turned off and some music in the background), at least until you've beaten all the levels and had some fun plowing up the biggest clay-ball you can in the dozer.

I wish I could be more middling on my appraisal of the game, so take this to be an ""it's okay"" review, rather than an outright positive one.",1430162760,1430162760,True,34,7,0.720265090465545654,5,True,False,False,False,,,
