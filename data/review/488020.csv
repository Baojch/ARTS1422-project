주요 목표물(?)에 방어시설이 있어서 자신의 UFO가 격추되기 전에 위협요소들을 미리 제거하고 파괴를 시작해도 세계 10위권 안으로 들어갈수 있습니다.

뜬금없는 시작에 매우 불편한 조작, 감이 잡히지 않는 컷신들..... 
$15 급 게임이 이런 그래픽을 가진다는게 참으로 놀랍습니다. 한 3,000원 급이였다면 그나마 용납되었겠지만 이건 할인을 해도 할게 못됩니다.

You play as the operator of a giant UFO, fitted with various weapons and power ups. Some notable weapons: Drop tripod walkers (surface attack vehicles) into the play field, a black hole that sucks nearby buildings into it, and lock-on targeting blasters. Each planet you go against is basically the same (at least the first four have been) other than one or two unique defensive capabilities. There’s some strategy here, to obliterate the outer city blocks, but not take focus away from the city centers for too long, otherwise you’re doomed to fail against their defenses.

Graphics are fine, controls are straightforward, and it runs smooth and stable. I wouldn’t buy it for the full asking price, but am really happy to have it for the price I paid! Thumbs up!",1523919394,1523919394,True,4,0,0.584905624389648438,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Or just nuke the planet from outta space without getting their webbed feet wet. Anyway, it does what it says on the box you are attached to the bottom of the UFO like a bedbug to the underside of your mattress. You shoot buildings and the occasional jet flyby until you have destroyed the whole city. Much like a bedbug dropping shit on the dust mites below.

Get's a little monotonous after 5 minutes and probably best for kids who want to grow up and be a Hitler. Graphics are basic, gameplay is basic, everything is pretty basic but again it works and does what it says.

Price seems expensive I would probably expect to pay about five dollars for these type of VR games, probably wait till it turns up in a bundle which it surely will do.

Honestly, at this price, I can't recommend, it's just not a $15 game.",1521892506,1521892506,False,6,4,0.364207655191421509,0,False,True,False,False,,,

I do not know why.
Maybe i just love to play the bad guy :)

I think it is the gameplay that does it for me.
