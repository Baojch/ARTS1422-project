I just played the prologue, and man, the game is really cool. You can tell it's made with love. The music is simple but engaging, the story is interesting and the characters well written. Some solutions could have been done better, and I found a couple of bugs, but overall the game is EXCELLENT. I'm glad I bought it at full price. Also attached is a manual that explains the status and the four game elements (although it wouldn't have hurt to include the names of the elements in the diagram)
kudos to Red Skald who made this game!",1701295707,1701295707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

BUT it did made me care about all the characters, even when the switches and some of the deaths could have been made better more believable. 
This game doesn't completely succeed at everything it does, but it is full of cool ideas and great attempts at what it tried to do, so I did enjoy the few hours that I spent on playing trough it
I don't think everyone will like it, it starts a bit slow and all the parts of it could have been fleshed out more, it is still a solid and nice game that I can only recommend, and I am excited to see what else the dev will bring to the table in the future with such a cool game as beginning!",1610082467,1610082467,True,4,0,0.587063252925872803,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game is 10000% WORTH THE MONEY AND THE HOURS YOU SPEND ON IT! It was done with a  lot of love and a lot of patience, and it took the dev 3 YEARS to make it! the game has an amazing intro you can only do by spending hours on rpg maker 2003! The graphics are all well done and very beautiful, the characters are really well written, and the story is original and touching, i was brought to tears twice, no lie! haha, and my little 4 years old sis always asks me if she could fight the monsters whenever she sees me playing it XD
This is one unique RPG maker 2003 game, so if you like this kind of games, get this one!
And the developer of this game is also a very nice, helpful and supportive person and is very fun to talk with, support them by purchasing this amazing game, because like I said before it's worth the price!
The soundtrack is also very calming and quiet, I like that about it too, and omg Sakeh is bae <3
I am very happy with my purchase.
I hope red skald makes another game, I will definitely purchase again!",1521569258,1524066535,True,13,0,0.668886184692382813,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Right now I'm hunting down Coldbrand in the mushroom forest, which is leading me through a pretty enjoyable story. There's still plenty of the game I've yet to explore, which excites me. I should also mention that I've never really liked games like Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem or any games that I would think to be similar to this. But this game in particular has me drawn in. The soundtrack is like a never ending loop of ""Lavendar Town"" from Pokemon R/G/B. 

Likes:
- The music / ambience
- The Story and feeling like you contribute to the outcome
- The look and feel of the game environment

Dislikes:
- No sound control ( Can't lower the sound )
- No autosave (Blame modern gaming for my save preferences)

I'm really looking forward to completing this game.",1490709417,1490709771,True,13,1,0.689732551574707031,0,True,False,False,False,,,
