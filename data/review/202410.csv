A score attack-style combo system is combined with standard space arcade twin stick shooting to deliver a pretty fine indie arcade game. With plenty of levels to grind for secret exits and unique Challenge stages, this short game packs some solid replay value. Though the experience may be a bit too simplistic for hardcore players and there's some broken online support and graphics settings to deal with, this is altogether a decent casual arcade shooter.

[i]Scoregasm[/i] has about as minimal of a plot as you can get: aliens in ships with lasers and bullets menace Earth; you, lone hero, are the only one who can stop them. Engage enemies in your ship outfitted with a standard gun and a short-range AoE burst to defeat waves of enemies across over eighty levels. Kill enemies in quick succession to earn temporary bonus abilities, and maintain your combo until the end of the level to unlock alternate, harder stages to continue through the campaign. Or tackle each of the 40+ base stages to unlock their respective Challenge modes, some of which really mix up the experience!

This game isn't trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the twin stick space shooter genre. [i]Geometry Wars[/i] will stand out as particular inspiration for this title in both level design and attack patterns. Regardless, the fundamentals are solid: the ship controls responsively and enemy types and attacks are varied enough to keep the player engaged. While the campaign can be speedrun in as little as twenty minutes with a minimum length of fifteen levels, players will doubtlessly be drawn in for more as the mix of score attack gameplay and increased voluntary level difficulty will pose setbacks and encourage repeat play.

Hardcore veterans of the genre may want to avoid this title, as the combat system is fairly easy to exploit thanks to the AoE attack. While the attack is somewhat balanced by having a limited number of rechargeable uses, it is still potent enough to nullify most immediate threats that most levels will pose. Therefore the bare minimum of surviving each level is very straightforward; meeting and maintaining the score quota to unlock harder levels is where the game's standard challenge is at. Admittedly, there is a tactical element to this conceit lying beneath the surface: kill a level's finite spawn of enemies too quickly and you'll find combos harder to maintain, since enemies spawn unpredictably and bullets dissipated in the AoE count toward combos as well. But in terms of core gameplay, [i]Scoregasm[/i] is built for casual play.

There are also some technical issues to note. The game has an online leaderboard function that has been defunct for nearly a decade now. There are also some issues with the resolution scaling. The game runs in a default 800x600 window, though it can be maxed out at 1920x1080 and fullscreened. Still, increasing resolution seems to zoom in the level display, to the point where only 40% of the screen is visible at max resolution. While this would normally be a critical error, it doesn't affect the experience as much for this title: [i]Scoregasm[/i] is a lo-fi game that fits well into a small window. While the lack of the online leaderboard (which the developer promised to fix years ago...) is too bad, a decent core experience still remains.

[i]Scoregasm[/i] is a smooth, catchy little indie space shooter. With a relatively low price tag and a whole bunch of levels to unlock and dig through, this is ideally built for short, casual play sessions. You can largely ignore the innuendo in the title, as it doesn't apply to the gameplay or the story aside from weird...sounds that play to signify high combos. Some technical faults could impair your ability to play this with the best graphics, though fortunately it's not really a game where that matters much. Come for the space shootin', stay for the naughtiness (or the level hunting). [i]Scoregasm[/i] gets a B-.",1651387026,1651387026,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

[b][i]Scoregasm[/i][/b] has a simple premise: turn on auto-fire and move to whenever the enemy is not.

""So, the same as any other twin stick shooter?"" you might ask, and yes it controls like a simple twin stick shooter, but it demands positional awareness more than lots of other games I know in the genre. This is because Scoregasm doesn't always play in a nice rectangular grid where enemies just come at you, no sir.

Every level in Scoregasm takes place on its own arena with its own challenges (some have deadly lasers, some have moving hazards, some are concentric rings and demand you to stay clear of some rings...) This, to me is the greatest strength in the game: it has many, many arenas to fight in. Some are your run of the mill squares, some will lock you in a small jail and ask you to take out enemy counter-attacks.

A full run of Scoregasm then runs as such: you play a level and, depending on several factors, you open up one or more portals to new levels, with different levels of difficulty. You then choose how easy or hard you make your run: do you always go for the hardest one, or do you prefer to keep it simple? 

Any time you play a level you ""unlock"" it so you can jump straight ahead to it in a future run (albeit with 0 points), so you can retry a difficult arena without having to pass through all previous challenges, a nice practice-friendly options that more games should consider.

Lastly, there's little actual customization to the ship, but it's not needed. The upgrades on every level will slowly float towards you, so you just need to survive long enough for them to reach you. Just focus on being not where the enemies are. You can get a good blast out of this older game.",1603674906,1603674906,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I’m being 100% sincere - on a Steam storefront divided three ways between eastern European one-man development teams publishing purchased Unity assets as actual games so they can scam you into buying trading cards, massive corporations publishing multi-million dollar products at the detriment of their thousands of soon-to-be-laid-off employees so they can scam you into buying weapon skins, and the handful of independent creators actually trying to do something interesting, it’s good to see the occasional good old-fashioned lazy game.

[i]Scoregasm[/i]’s gimmick is that its structure branches out, allowing you to play its collection of very similar levels in just about any order you choose. The problem with this is that it’s missed the point of branching pathways in video games in the first place. RPGs did it to give you a stake in the story. [i]Super Mario Bros.[/i] did it to reward you for finding hidden areas. [i]Scoregasm[/i] just does it because, deep inside, the developers probably knew that they had to do [i]something[/i] different. It doesn’t make the game more fun or more interesting, it just makes it less likely that I’m going to try to decipher the mess of a user interface and more likely that I’m just going to uninstall it and never play it again.

That said, it’s fun in the same ways most twin-stick shooters are, which is in the ‘not at all’ way. There are a lot of bright colours, so if you’re into that, check it out! Otherwise, it’s the same droning, monotonous gameplay where you could almost fall asleep whilst circle-strafing around different-coloured spaceships.

Thanks in no small part to the seminal 1980s classics like Robotron and Asteroids, we now have more twin-stick shooters than we can swing a twin-stick at. The principle is the same as it's always been: kill tons of enemies and avoid bazillions of missiles. Screens are confined by boundaries so the action is tight and restricted and incredibly intense. Its main gimmick, like Waves, is a slightly overpowered special attack which kills anything within a small radius around your ship.  Each level lasts about 40-60 seconds. Most enemies have one hit-point but with power-ups aplenty the usual sight is to see a monumental stream of bullets issuing forth from your ship and swarms of enemies exploding into smithereens. 

[u] PRESENTATION & DESIGN [/u]
The start-screen doubles as the level-select screen so moving your ship to the right scrolls through and uncovers the map of levels. Be warned though, it's a badly designed mess with no explanation or description given as to how navigating through the game actually works. Sound is a mixed bag as well; pumping, trance-like tunes get you into the zone but while in the menus the peculiar soundtrack coughs and splutters like a badly distorted fart. Graphics are fine, comparing similarly to the game's closest competitor, Mutant Storm Reloaded. The progression system in Scoregasm is disorientating to say the least. You get a score at the end but this gets lost to a broken online connection. However the high-score, best combo score and rank (S, A, B, C, D, E and F) for each individual level, if beaten, are stored and can be viewed on the stats page afterwards. 

[u] CONCLUSION [/u]
Scoregasm still remains one of the most intense Asteroids-inspired / twin-stick shoot ‘em ups of all time. Clearing tricky levels by a split second through skill and dexterity is always greeted with satisfying relief. Although it may not have the polish and class of a Geometry Wars it gets a lot more things right than other games of this ilk such as Bullet Candy, Gran Vitreous or Death Ray Manta. On the other hand it would benefit from giving the player the option to play individual levels (like in Mutant Storm Reloaded). The alternative Challenge levels are also too ridiculously tough for casual players. Still, the sheer enjoyment gained from the main part of the game is immense and largely makes up for these minor quibbles.

The goal is to survive long enough, all while trying to get the best score, hence the name.  If you've gotten enough points, you can enter some Frenzy mode, where enemies go all out and further increase your score.  Depending on your performance, you unlock paths to new levels, categorized by difficulties.

The big twist in the controls is the Close Range Pulse Attack, an explosion that destroys enemy ships and bullets, which uses your energy bar that can only be replenished by letting it recharge or blasting away enough bullets, absorbing their energy.  This explosive attack is of utmost importance in your success, as it can get really tense when enemies start cornering you as you desperately try to manage your energy, and there's an heavy risk/reward factor, which helps boosting your score further.  It's a very fun mechanic.

There are 43 levels, all of which are set on 3 lanes, ranging from easy, normal, and hard.  Each of them has a Combo Medal to get and a Challenge with a specific objective, like leading an enemy mouse through a maze for cheese.  You can also unlock Expert Mode, where enemies leave an explosion of bullets upon death, making things much harder.  The game keeps your best scores for each levels, so part of the fun is trying to do even better in each one of those.  There's a massive amount of replay value.  An issue though is that the online leaderboards doesn't work anymore, and there's little sign that it'll ever come back, but I honestly paid little to no mind to it, and Holy Christ Challenge 2B is one of my worst experiences in my gaming life.

The presentation is stellar.  The use of bright colors, reflective surfaces, intricate patterns of flashy bullets (such as big waves-like motions), and a varied array of strange enemies like DNAs and happy faces, gives the game a great art style and an unique identity, it's fun to just look at the action going onscreen.  The electronic soundtrack also is fantastic, sporting a variety of styles; the main menu has this ominous feeling to it, and ""Tower Of One"" feels like shit's about to go down, but then ""The Revenge Theme"" has this much more upbeat vibe.

Quello che lo distingue dagli altri è il fatto che la nostra navicella può spostarsi solo in uno spazio molto ristretto, mentre i nemici (molto vari e originali) ci bersagliano con centinaia di proiettili e tendono a schiantarsi contro di noi al triplo della nostra velocità di movimento.
Una scelta interessante, ma non riuscitissima: nei livelli più avanzati il bullet hell diventa davvero impegnativo da evitare visto il pochissimo spazio di manovra, e spesso si muore senza aver neanche capito cosa ci ha colpiti e da dove. 

In nostro soccorso, oltre al normale sparo upgradabile coi soliti 2-3 potenziamenti diversi, viene una specie di attacco ad area ravvicinato che possiamo sfruttare per distruggere qualunque cosa ci stia col fiato sul collo, compresi i proiettili. Sfortunatamente però questo attacco ha un uso limitato, ma può essere sempre ricaricato distruggendo i nemici con lo sparo normale o aspettando un po' di tempo.
Alcuni livelli però sono praticamente impossibili da finire se si esaurisce tale attacco troppo presto, visto che presentano veri e propri muri di proiettili da poter evitare solo spammandolo finché non siamo in salvo… ma se lo si è usato troppo in un passaggio precedente, non c'è né il tempo né i nemici necessari per ricaricarlo, perciò possiamo benissimo salutare una delle nostre vite. 

Un'altra bella idea che aumenta la rigiocabilità è il fatto di presentare tre percorsi ben distinti (Normal, Hard, Insane), da poter intraprendere alla fine di ogni livello se viene raggiunto un certo numero di combo. In questo modo simil-StarFox 64 si potranno quindi affrontare una dozzina di livelli esclusivi per ogni difficoltà, con nemici inediti e boss specifici, compreso quello finale. Se si muore comunque non ci sono grandi svantaggi: tutti i livelli raggiunti sono selezionabili in ogni momento, permettendoci di ripartire da dove vogliamo con di nuovo tutte le vite.
Ogni livello presenta poi una Sfida particolare, alcune semplici e altre inconcepibili, giusto per aumentare la rigiocabilità e far guadagnare delle medaglie che non servono a niente.

La longevità in sé non è altissima, in un paio di orette si riescono a finire tutti e tre i percorsi, poi per chi vuole c'è la modalità Extreme che è praticamente identica ma con più proiettili, le già citate Sfide e svariati obiettivi tipo ""Finisci tutto da Insane senza morire mai"" e altre cose altrettanto ridicole che proprio anche no.

Its main selling points are a focus on huge scores, branching progression through the levels, and a focus on proximity bombs. Contrary to most games in the genre, in which such life-saving bombs should be spared for desperate situations, Scoregasm encourages the player to use them liberally as they help achieve higher scores and combos. Thid id probably the reason why Scoregasm is considred too easy by the most hardcore players.

The action is frantic enough to remain interesting and the controls (aside from the menus) are perfectly precise and responsive with the Xbox 360 controller. The music is good, provided you enjoy slightly outdated techno.

Technically, graphics are nothing too impressive, though perfectly serviceable, except in some rare levels where elements from the background can easily be confused with enemies.

The big problem with Scoregasm is the online scoreboard, which ceased to function just one year after the game's release and has never been restored, despite the developer's promises.

This game, while containing challenging levels, gives great mechanics to make the game just a challenging as it needs to be, but no more. 

For instance:
You have the ability to shoot out a shield multiple times which destroyes all ships and projectiles around you. You might ask, ""Why would I want that??"" This allows you to have so many things going on around you, ships, bullets, crazy spirograph(anyone remember that as a kid?) looking lazer death beams moving around a track of spikes, yet you are still able to function and shoot, and resort to that shield in a pinch. 

The game is not linear, it allows multiple tree type different level selection (provided you have unlocked the prior branch), and it allows you to select any of them, and on successful completion will unlock the following branch. 

All-in-all, I would recommend it at $5. I'm sure you can find it on sale, and then it's a steal, but if you like the Invaders/Galaga/Geometry Wars type of games, then I think you will enjoy this (you'll intend to play it for brief times, but then find yourself immersed in it :)).",1436171961,1436172029,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

But the gameplay is fast paced and action heavy, and it's really fun to play. I can't say that I found anything negative abou the game and for $5 it's not a bad price.

Die Level unterscheiden sich nicht nur nach der Anzahl der Gegner die auf euch einstürzen und die ihr vernichten müsst, sonder auch durch die verschiedenen Aufgaben die ihr in den kurzen, knackigen und motivierenden Spielabschnitten lösen müsst.
Sich von Level zu Level weiterzuarbeiten macht dadurch riesig Freude.
Und das ist auch der deutliche Unterschied der ""Scoregasm"" von anderen Twinshootern abhebt. Die Abwechslung!
Ihr feuert euch nicht durch das immer gleiche Areal mit immer gleichen Gegnern. Sondern durch verschiedene Level mit immer neuen Feinden. Das hebt die Motivation deutlich zum weiterzuspielen auch wenn`s schwer wird.
Also, kein Frust nur Lust.

Mit ""Score"" hat der Titel des Spiels viel gemeinsam, Mit ""Gasm"" auch.

Den Schwierigkeitsgrad könnt ihr selbst bestimmen, da sich nach beenden eines Levels verschiedene Wege öffnen.
Anfangs wählte ich die leichten Wege, später lechzte ich wegen des guten Punktesystems nach den Schweren.
Ich hatte nie das Gefühl dass dieser Shooter unschaffbar ist.  
Das Spiel ist fair und bietet für Anfänger wie auch für Profis genug Joystickspaß (X-Box Controller funktioniert super).

Die Grafik ist gut, der Sound ebenfalls. Der Spielablauf ist flüssig und unproblematisch.

One of the most fun shoot-'em-ups I've found on any platform. The fundamentals are rock solid, and their apparent simplicity will test you in surprisingly varied ways. Steam has a lot of shmups to offer, and you might wonder why to bother with this one... I'll try to spell it out below.

This game dispenses with novel mechanics and focuses on fun gameplay, level designs, and interesting challenges. It's got oldschool genes in it, but doesn't pigeonhole itself into being retro. It's neither horizontal nor vertical, but requires you to move and shoot omnidirectionally in every level. Horizontal scrollers tend to have a lot of environmental hazards, while verticals tend to have bullets flying everywhere... this has both!

Every level has unique situations to deal with, and even a veteran player will have to master them individually. Losing your powerups isn't the death sentence it can be in other shmups, because they aren't key to an easy victory - no screen-filling death lasers here to make you a sloppy pilot. There are enough powerups to mix things up, but they're random. It's a game of skill, not memorization.

Difficulty and pacing are outstanding. The curve is fair, practicing produces noticeable improvements every time, and when you accomplish something, you feel the glory. But it's also a game easily picked up and put down by the casual player. You're not stuck playing the same levels in the same order, and don't have to beat every previous level for another shot at one you've unlocked. Levels are like Starfox - 3 difficulty paths you can travel between as you meet requirements. All of this together makes a game well-suited for casuals, hardcore shmup fans, and anything in between. You'll always have something to work toward that isn't TOO far away.

Scoregasm is in my personal top 10 for shmups, and is my pick for best twin-stick game on the PC. Though made with the X360 controller in mind (I think), any Dual Shock works fantastically with it. If you like shoot-'em-ups, I can't imagine not liking this, unless you have some very specific preferences for your games.",1404269685,1404270227,True,2,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Ahh, Bullet Hell games, how much I love you... Or atleast love screaming at you. This game is more of a Bullet Hell Lite though, Still great fun but with none of the insane difficulty of a screen full of things really trying to kill you. 

Gameplay-wise, this game handles with all the grace and maneuverability of a twin-stick shooter... So, depending on how good you are at them great to middling. I always manage to lose my grip on one of the control sticks whenever I play, but I still manage to suvive somehow.

Graphically, the screen-shots speak for themselves. Bright, vibrant colours, varied enemies and stages, a third thing... I think this is one of the prettiest games that I own.

The music in this game matches the gameplay perfectly, so much so that I forget sometimes that the sound effects and the musical score are seperated.


I may be somewhat biased in this review, because I have always been a sucker for games like this, but I do fully recommend this game if you enjoy pretty colours with a laid-back feel... Well, as laid back as a Bullet Hell game can be.

Your not going to get 100s of hours of gameplay out of Scoregasm but it has enough levels and variety to keep you challenged for a while. There is quite a bit to unlock and explore.

Gorgeous graphics that pop out of the screen along, classic arcade style audio with some intense close quarter 'bullet hell' gameplay makes this a fun twin-stick shooter. If you can grab it at a good price its worth adding to the collection.
