My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1709587172,1709587172,True,4,0,0.555526673793792725,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

Unlike the sea of ""baby's first RPG Maker project"" releases that can be spotted from a mile away, Jade's Journey comes equipped with a just charming enough veneer of competence and professionalism that it's probably led a good many player to think--even as they struggled to find the will to carry on through yet another soulless dungeon--that it's actually a good-faith effort at a good commercial JRPG.

It isn't.

Jade's Journey's asset selection (map tiles especially) and competent (but very boring and player-unfriendly) mapping truly does about 90% of the heavy lifting for it. It's essentially a bare-minimum asset-flippy skeleton for a JRPG, the type that any competent user of RPG Maker could put together in a month. These things, needless to say, shouldn't be released to the public until they've got some semblance of an appealing hook--just one or two of things like fleshed-out characters, polished dialogue, ambitiously-directed scenes, balanced or varied or interesting or surprising encounters, unusual/fun skills or mechanics or locations or concepts, etc. would show that the game was made with passion instead of as a way to make a quick buck. 

Add to that the fact that there's essentially just 1 hour of content in here, painfully stretched to 3 or beyond via excruciatingly long (and narrow, to make it harder to avoid battles) dungeons that you have to walk all the way back through in a really gross display of playtime padding... and then you have to do it again with like 3 or 4 in a row near the end of the game. With poor, low-effort, comma-splice-obsessed writing and very little reason to ever stray from the main path, and only 2 different encounter types per dungeon (always containing 4 enemies which are faster than they need to be), Jade's Journey is the sloggiest of slogs.

Jade's Journey is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel JRPG ripoffs spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""

Basically, these guys didn't make a game, they filled out a couple of templates in a construction kit.

This is painfully generic and carries a completely awfully written, unoriginal fan fiction tier anime story about the protagonist being the ""chosen one"", and having to destroy evil blah blah blah.   There's kindergarten dropouts who could come up with richer plots for a game. 

Like all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options.  Resolution is locked and the game features 2D retro pixel art asset flips.  All of this makes this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development, and the poor quality of this game supports that. 

Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.  Leave this terrible fan fiction in the shovelware bundles where it belongs.",1654875241,1654875241,False,2,1,0.200650438666343689,0,False,False,False,False,,,

首先游戏的剧情设计并未达到预期的效果。故事背景虽然设定在一个充满奇幻元素的世界中，但剧情发展却显得单调乏味，缺乏足够的转折和高潮。角色间的对话也显得平淡无奇，缺乏深度和情感投入，使得玩家很难真正投入到游戏中去。

其次游戏的玩法机制也缺乏创新和挑战。虽然游戏包含了探索、解谜和战斗等元素，但这些元素的设计都显得相对简单和重复。谜题的设计缺乏创意和深度，玩家可以轻易找到答案，缺乏挑战性。战斗系统也显得单调乏味，缺乏足够的策略性和紧张感。

在画面和音效方面同样未能给人留下深刻印象。画面风格虽然清新可爱，但整体画质却显得粗糙，缺乏细节和质感。音效方面也显得平淡无奇，背景音乐和音效设计都未能为游戏氛围增添足够的色彩。

此外游戏的操作体验也存在一些问题。角色的移动和动作反应不够流畅，有时会出现卡顿或误操作的情况，影响了玩家的游戏体验。同时游戏的UI设计也不够直观易用，使得玩家在游戏过程中需要花费额外的时间去熟悉和理解各种操作。

最后游戏的整体流程也显得过于冗长和重复。一些任务和关卡的设计缺乏新意，玩家需要反复进行相似的操作和解谜，使得游戏过程变得乏味和枯燥。

综上所述，在剧情设计、玩法机制、画面音效、操作体验以及整体流程等方面都存在明显的不足。它未能为玩家带来一场有趣且充满挑战性的冒险解谜之旅，反而让人感到平淡无奇。如果你期待找到一款能够激发兴趣和想象力的冒险游戏，那么这款游戏可能并不是你的最佳选择。希望开发者能够在未来的更新中加强对游戏的改进和优化，为玩家带来更好的游戏体验。",1646040046,1711619465,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It is hardly a ground-breaking game - it uses only the most basic features of the genre, but there are no glaring problems with it either.

The premise of the game is that a young girl named Jade discovers she is the chosen one after her father is kidnapped and held for ransom by an evil sorceress. Jade and her party must obtain some orbs and give them up to the sorceress in exchange for his freedom. The story is entirely quest-based, and there is little dynamic between the characters.

You start out as a party of two, and build up to four by the halfway point. The game consists of a series of wilderness mazes filled with enemies. The mazes are not complicated. When you reach a fork in the road, one of them will be a short dead-end path with a treasure chest at the end. Enemies are visible and are moderately difficult to avoid, but presumably you need to fight a lot of them anyway to level up. It becomes an issue though, when you have to travel back the way you came, because enemies respawn whenever you leave the map.

Battles are tedious. Each wilderness area has exactly two kinds of enemy troops, and there is exactly one strategy that works best for all of them. Each area has a boss at the end, with a spot immediately before that replenishes all HP and MP. The boss takes a long time to defeat, but there isn't much strategy involved. 

Characters learn new skills by levelling up, but they all pretty much do the same thing. There are stores in the towns which sell items, and occasionally equipment. The same equipment can usually be found in the treasure chests of the wilderness though. If you fight every enemy you meet, you will have enough gold to buy many times more items than you will need in the entire game.

Overall, this game is very basic, and not very exciting.",1615646749,1615646749,True,2,0,0.533492803573608398,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Given how small the pool of feedback is and how mixed the feedback was when I bought the game, I figured I would give it a fair shot.  So I played it for the full 5 hours and completed it (100% achievements).  I really wanted to like it and I kept waiting to see what everyone found so charming about it.  If the combat had been simplified or shortened dramatically and a mini-map had been provided, a 5 hour trudge could have been a fun 1 hour journey.  However, the developer could not charge you for a 1 hour journey.

Pros: It's an indie game.  It's kinda cute.  It has a simple plot.

Cons: No volume controls at all.  I had to go to my volume mixer to mute the game.  I did not realize there was controller support until 2 hours in when I noticed the icon on the steam page in my library during a break.  There is not a mini map, compass or any other guide through the monster areas and I often wasted a great deal of time walking in the wrong direction.  The lack of any tutorial or explanation of controls was extremely frustrating.  I was very nervous hitting ""esc"" to see if it would pull up a menu or close the game (I had not figured out how to save yet).  

Final thoughts: I really wanted to like this game (hence the 5 hours and 100% completion).  I think I bought it on sale for less than a dollar.  However, I have played and enjoyed free flash games that were more complete in at least one aspect (game-play, combat, story, design).

La coppia ritornerà al villaggio, scoprendo che il padre di jade è stato rapito. Chi lo ha rapito, chiede come riscatto due sfere magiche che solo il prescelto può prendere. Quindi, lei parte insieme all'amico, alla ricerca di queste sfere. E qui, inizia e finisce tutto. La storia è tutta qui, con qualche sotto trama troppo nebulosa, che forse si scoprirà nel secondo capitolo. 

Il gioco invece ha buone idee ma realizzate contro voglia. 

Primo: i dungeon hanno un'unica strada, i pochi bivi che troverete vi portano certamente ad uno scrigno o al proseguò del labirinto, non potete sbagliarvi.

Secondo: Buona l'idea di far mostrare i nemici su schermo come nubi viola, nel caso vorreste evitarli. Peccato che ciò è rovinato da 2 fattori.
1) La protagonista non corre.
2) Le nubi invece corrono il doppio della protagonista. ^^;

Terzo: Altra buona idea, non ci sono combattimenti casuali nella mappa del mondo, solo nei livelli.

Quarto: Scarso equipaggiamento, solo un paio di negozi che vendono armi e armature in tutto il gioco. Il resto delle armature piu potenti lo trovate all'interno degli scrigni che si trovano nei pochi livelli in cui è composto il gioco.

Cinque: 640x480 nel 2016 ? ^^;

Sesto: I combattimenti normali non hanno tattiche, solo: attacco attacco attacco. Le uniche tattiche servono solo contro i boss, con la maga si paralizza il boss e con il resto del gruppo si va di mosse speciali. ^_^

Settimo: Una volta terminato non c'e modo di rigiocarlo magari ad un livello di difficoltà piu alto. 

Ottavo: Pochi livelli per i 4 euro di prezzo pieno. 1 o 2 euro poteva essere il suo prezzo giusto non di piu.  ^_^ Se proprio lo volete comprare. Fatelo scontato, magari a meno di 1 euro per entrambi i capitoli. ^_^",1532565859,1532565859,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Because this game is bad. I really wanted it to be not bad, because Warfare Studios usually puts out fairly high quality RPG Maker ganes, But, this game, Is. BAD, 

I mean, it's playable, but that's about the only thing it's got going for it. 

Complaint the First: The battles. They are annoying and repetitive. Also boring as heck. I am no stranger to The Grind, but when you are trying to avoid or run away from more battles than you are fighting, that is a sign there is something wrong. It gets a bit better later in the game when you get a few more abilities, but battles are still for the most part devoid of any suspense or need for strategy. The monster designs are uninspired and I find myself dreading each random encounter. I did find myself getting into it during a couple of the boss battles, but that's it. At least random encounters are visible on screen, so it is easy to avoid them. Onscreen monsters outside of battle are always a nice touch, and something I like in games. It was also interesting how some of them moved at different speeds, I guess. Still doesn't make up for the terrible battles.

Complaint the Second: Level Design
Every dungeon is literally the same dungeon - a straight line with occasional branches that lead to treasure. Even the general size and shape of the passageways are the same. The only difference is the tileset and the monsters you encounter. But it seriously just felt like I was playing the same level over and over. 

Complaint the Third: Writing
In an RPG, the most important thing is the story. I can forgive even the WORST gameplay if the story and writing is good, or if it has a sense of humor. You will find none of this here. Not only is the story about the most cliche ""Chosen One"" plot I have ever come across, it also boasts cardboard, inorganic dialogue that does not feel like real people are saying it. I cannot bring myself to give a crap about any of the characters or what happens next because of this clumsy, heavy handed attempt at writing a story. Now, even a terrible story would be forgivable if the game knew how to laugh at itself. But no. It takes itself SUPER SERIOUSLY the entire time, except for a couple ""jokes"", and I use that in the loosest sense, about how the main character's best friend is kind of an idiot. Note that aside from being impulsive in general, said best friend did nothing to proimpt those jokes so they just felt hackneyed and out of place. 

In summary, this game is bad. And this is coming from someone who regularly writes reviews that find redeeming qualities in some of the worst-rated games. This is coming from someone who will generally play anything that isn't rendered completely unplayable by bugs.  I was going to wait until I finished this game so I could give it a fair chance, especially since it's so short, but here I am, only about 1/2 to 2/3 of the way through and I can't take it anymore.  After the first hour, it took at least half a bottle of wine just to keep playing because honestly I can only tolerate this stuff if I'm tipsy. 

I hate myself for wasting this much time on it, and I hate myself even more knowing that I'm probably going to push myself to finish the dang thing within the next week or so in the vain hopes that it may suddenly get interesting in the second half. And I hate myself the most that I'm probably going to get the dang sequel at some point in the hopes that the second will be better than the first, because hey, Warfare Studios wouldn't put out TWO flops in a row, would they? 

But either way, this game is bad. I don't see how it only has positive reviews. This game isn't worth what it costs. This game isn't even worth the measly 40 megabytes it takes up on my hard drive.
