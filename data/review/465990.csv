- fantastic music - basically modern classical music with harp and violins. 

- detailed and gorgeous art with soft colours

- excellent, natural sounding voice acting with English subtitles

- smart and interesting puzzles, from point and click puzzles, hidden object games, to jigsaw puzzles where the puzzle pieces need to be rotated

- a bonus chapter to play, a short and fun ""making of"" video, and art wallpapers you can save to your computer desktop screen,

- you can also listen to different songs from the soundtrack at the end of the game

- funny end credits

- if you watch all the way to the end of the end credits without skipping cut scenes and dialogue, you get an achievement (not in steam, but in the game)

Overall, highly recommended! :)

The art is pretty and the HO scenes are interesting.  The story is no more linear than most such games, although the characters are rather forgettable.

Pros:
- nice visuals, reasonably good voice acting
- setting is varied and interesting
- puzzles are somewhat varied and have a few challenges
- plenty of HO scenes with different styles (word list, shape, etc.)
- customizable difficulty setting and fully interactive map
- collectibles are interesting to find without being frustrating

Note:  Watch out for the morphing objects *within* HO scenes (wish I'd known)

Cons:
- story is on the weak side; Eipix has done better
- the hint button is right beside the map, and the map button is small
- no Steam achievements (although the in-game achievements are fun to try for anyway)
- the bonus chapter was nicely drawn and provided more to do, but was only ""okay""

[b]Overall:[/b]  This is the first game of the series that is a HOPA; the earlier games appear to be older-style HO games.  The Crown of Solomon was fun to play, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the HOPA genre, especially if you like the ""protagonist in secret society"" setting.  The visuals were very nice, and the Extras menu lets you go back to find or do things you've missed. Get it on sale, but only get the bundle if you don't mind the three ""old school"" HO games.",1604917952,1604918130,True,11,0,0.683674097061157227,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Standard fare. Unfortunately for you, you just happened to get caught up in the chaos. Unfortunately for them… you actually do this kind of thing for a living (think Indiana Jones).

[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]

Game Visuals

I want to mention that the visuals for the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.

Game Audio

I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.

Gameplay

There are four different difficulty game modes to choose from: Rookie (Casual;) Field Agent (Advanced;) HELP Operative (Expert) and Custom.

The HELP box acts like a notebook. It keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.

There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly without having the need to constantly backtrack. It also indicates that there are a variety of tasks that can be completed at various locations within the game. The interactive map is not automatically given at the start of the game.

There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary.

There are some interactive items in the game. Some of the interactive items may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.

The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Find ""x"" amount; Picture Item; Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction. Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.

The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra features section as well.

There are two sets of collectibles in the game, photographs and crown, they are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.

There are morphing items in the game. But they are only found in the hidden object scenes only.

There are twenty-one different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.

Since this is a collector's edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it only can be accessed after the main story is completed.

Miscellaneous

There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Object Scenes; Bonus Puzzles; Wallpapers; Concept Art; Soundtrack; Game's Strategy guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.

Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.",1520828267,1600732339,True,9,0,0.627364873886108398,0,True,False,False,False,,,

das Spiel soeben beendet und bin noch ganz hingerissen davon!! Hier gibt es wirklich nichts zu bemängeln. Alles ganz großartig!
Die Grafik, wie immer bei EIPIX wunderschön, die Gesichter der handelnden Personen kommen uns wieder ein bißchen bekannt vor. Kein Wunder, es handelt sich wieder um digidalisierte EIPIX Mitarbeiter.
Ganz toll sind diesmal die WBs. Alle ineinander verschachtelt, viele MIniwimmels öffnen sich mittendrin. Wortsuchlisten, Silhouettensuche, usw. Richtig schön abwechslungsreich!
Die Minispiele sind liebevollst verpackt und manchmal ganz schön kniffelig!
Im Inventar haben wir immer wieder Dinge, die mit anderen zu kombinieren sind. Aber vorsicht, es ist nicht immer so, wie es scheint! Manchmal entstehen daraus völlig andere Dinge, als üblich.
Eine sehr nette Idee ist auch die H.E.L.P. Box. Dort können wir geschichtliche Tatsachen erfahren.
