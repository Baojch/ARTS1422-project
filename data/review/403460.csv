[spoiler]It can't be.[/spoiler]

The gameplay seems torn between fast-paced platforming and button-mashing combat. But the platforming is laughable, and the combat is... dreadful. You have two options: jump, or attack. That's it. The combos show up whenever they feel like, aren't remotely close to intuitive, and it's like you're expected to button mash for successes. I've been hit by fireballs seemingly because I did not convey enough of a desire to hit them until I decided carpal tunnel was an acceptable side effect to feeling like I had a choice in what my character did. 

Once I decided that I would exchange strategy for mindless button mashing, things got worse.

Because now, I didn't have to think at all about the game. This left too much cranial capacity to post-game analysis.

What I've found can be summed up as such:
[list]
    [*] The duality of mechanics--combat and vertical racing--reflect poor balance.
    [*] There is zero attempt at complex storytelling, but graphical impression of a visual novel--reflecting... I don't know, a half-assed storytelling attempt?
    [*] The poor implementation of core mechanics indicting game design intent
[/list]

Based on the... singular... other game published by Ground Shatter, I have to address my third point more severely:

If asked without bias or prejudice what game I thought GS was aiming for here, I would guess attempting the replication of the Super Smash Brothers franchise. here's why: The game isn't bad in premise, only execution. The idea that seems to be poorly expressed from the get-go is some combat-centric core gameplay... but there's also the vertical movement element. That vertical gameplay which, by the way, would balance the game only if the AI players managed to acknowledge the secondary victory mechanic. I beat all the single player campaigns by jumping upward. The only variance from moving upward as fast as I can was when I specifically fell for the overpowered boost one who is too low experiences just for being too low. I found myself ahead of every other competitor after taking advantage of this mechanic, which the game claimed to balance by taking away hitpoints and special meters. But!... the special meter is garbage. Special attacks and special jumps are worthless. Hitpoints are too bountiful. So... getting behind on vertical movement gives an advantage. This advantage is augmented by the fact that the game seems to favor those previously fallen players in a combat environment, so the path to victory involves falling and button mashing attack.

So... the campaign is beaten by denying the core gameplay mechanic, which the AI also ignores.

This isn't one of those ""maybe if it was free"" reviews--just don't waste your time.",1593049821,1628574250,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

The combat mechanics really don't have enough depth to them mainly because you only have 2 buttons that do something.   There are also a few mechanics with the platforming element of the game.    The platforming itself feels pretty decent.  It takes a little awhile to get used to what is a jumpable surface and what is not.  

 My biggest gripe I guess would be if you are playing a 4 player match, if 3 people are way on the bottom of the screen and you are at the top the field of vision for the top player does not feel fair because objects can hit you much easier and you do not see them coming.  I feel like this unfairly punishes the player who is in the dominant position trying to get to the roof first.   I had 1 game breaking bug where the screen look glitched out and the game would not end so I had to restart.  Also I had to restart several times because if I move my controller too much the game detects it as disconnected and whenever I reconnect the controller I am still unable to control my player.  The difference between this and other games for me is if that happens in a different game I can usually just replugin in the controller and continue playing whereas with this game it requires a restart.

I played through the storylines of the 4 characters, and for the most part the game doesn't do a goodjob making the characters interesting or making you care about their interactions before combat.  I know fighting games aren't really played for their storyline, but I just felt this game could have done a bit better on this.  Not too long in it starts to get boring and repetitive, but luckily the game only takes a few hours to beat.  The background scenes in the game were just ok.  I thought the Japan one looked the coolest, but really the stages feel too similar to each other.  The sound is pretty decent.  Its just a standard sounding 90s fighting game type music.  

Overall I would say this game is like a 4/10 maybe which isn't enough for me not to recommend it.  Don't pay full price but if you see it in some cheap bundle or something its fine.  I imagine most would get more fun out of using remote play or local co op with friends, but even then the amount of time you would enjoy this game wouldn't be too long.

The biggest problem I had with the game is that it gets boring pretty quickly. This is due to a lack of variety in the game especially with the combat. While the game has two combat buttons, both attacks appear to do pretty much the same things so there isn't a lot of variety in the combat. If the game had more variety in the combat I think the game could have been a lot better.

The platforming aspects of the game are not bad. The platforming controls work well for the most part. I liked the fact that you could jump higher off debris that was more vertical. The problem is that it feels like you need to either focus on jumping up the building or attacking the other players in any given round since it is too hard to do both. 

I had some fun with the game but after about a half hour I was getting tired it. If you are going to play the game I would highly recommend playing against other players instead of the computers since the computer AI is not always the greatest. 

If you generally like these type of games and have some friends you can invite over I think you can have some fun with SkyScrappers. If you find the game in a sale you could do a lot worse.

Note: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.

This game is great but I might just be the worst player ever. I really don't mind losing that much against most of the characters (especially not the mysterious Jessica) but there is something about that artistocrat smugness that really gets to me. I'll keep at it though, honing my skills until I become the ultimate SkyScrapper. And then Phileas... then I'll hunt you down. And I will kill you.

Seriously though, get a bunch of friends with controllers over and this is great competitive fun (even if you lose).",1444985658,1444985658,True,5,1,0.537757694721221924,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Your main objective is to eliminate your opponents (Friends or Bots) while running up a building's falling debris. Be it by meleeing them to death, or reaching the top of the building first.

You have two main controls: Jump and attack. However, there are a few things that mix things up to allow you to strategise. For example, while running on a bigger piece of debris, it will tilt more. The more vertically tilted the object is, you will launch high once you jump. You can also hold the jump button for when you land on tiny pieces of rubbel to get an extra bounce. Using your attack button, you can either directly hit opponents away, or knock small debris into them.
While you play, your special meter also charges up, which allows you to either do a special jump or attack by double tapping the corresponding button.

The game is most fun with friends, although you can also play a singleplayer campaign which has you going from country to country, fighting different opponents. Street Fighter style. There's also a bit of dialogue before each fight.

There isn't too much variety within content to keep you playing for long. You can choose different looking maps, and alter the height of the building, and there are only 4 characters to choose from, which all seem to play the same.

Overall, don't get it expecting tonnes of hours of gameplay, but it's still a fun and simple game to play a few rounds of whenever your friends come over!",1444926467,1444934963,True,14,2,0.573523283004760742,0,False,False,False,False,,,
