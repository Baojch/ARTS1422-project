I don't know how I feel about this VN to be honest. There were some aspects that I loved and some aspects that I hated and nothing in between. But overall it was really well-written with some great character work. It's also really nice how the plot didn't feel messy at all despite its scale.

I especially loved Yuna's personal journey of self acceptance, the Sasa/Umi plot (a great story about friendship and romance) and the Youka/Aki plot (just a nice wholesome romance that hits all the right spots for me). I also really like how every character that shows up is 3 dimensional, even Sachi and Megumi, who purely exist to tie the plot together and move things forward, were given some depth.

HOWEVER, the Kiri/Tsukuyo plot can literally burn in the depths of Hell for all I care. There's an inherent creepiness to student-teacher romantic relationships that shouldn't have been told in a positive light like in the VN. The Matsuri/Miyu plot would've been a great story about understanding and respecting your SO if it weren't for the fact that Matsuri straight up tries to rape Miyu and no one thinks it's a big deal.

Since this is an eroge I should probably talk about the sex scenes as well. I really liked the way the sex scene between Youka and Aki was written as it focuses on the emotions of the characters and the people involved were respectful of each other. The sex scenes between Megumi and Sachi, Yuna and Hina, Miki and Seina, and Umi and Sasa were pretty run-of-the-mill so I have no complaints. The sex scene between Matsuri and Miyu was way too Japanese-porn-like which diminishes the eroticism for me but that's just personal preference. 

I absolutely hated how the sex scene between Kiri and Tsukuyo was literally sexual coercion by Kiri. I assume it's another attempt to sort of ""balance out"" the inherent power imbalance between student-teacher romantic relationships alongside having Tsukuyo be physically small and not having her teach Kiri's class but it's still creepy and unnerving. First of all, two wrongs don't make a right. Second of all, Tsukuyo immediately assumes the dominant position, which reaffirms the power imbalance, as soon as they actually have sex.

Still, the stuff I hate about this VN weren't poorly written and were of the same quality writing-wise as everything else. Kiri, Tsukuyo, Matsuri and Miyu were all well-written characters with rich personalities and well-defined motives behind their actions, which is why I'm still giving this a high rating and ""recommending"" it.",1706089837,1706122943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

其实百合灵很早以前就听说过，那会儿我比较中意flowers，不喜欢百合灵这种看似比较简朴的画风，加上不是特别喜欢纯校园题材，觉得会比较无聊，一直没有想要去打这个游戏
近期开始集中推百合游戏，所以见缝插针地想着来玩一玩这个据说无扭曲内容的作品，然后就打到现在

百合灵是一部简约而不简单的作品，虽然确实是普通的校园生活，但是多对cp每一对都有不同的故事，而且还有诸如自我救赎、友情、责任、热情等等很青春的元素在里面，读起来很顺畅没有特别悬浮
我非常喜欢女主结奈，是一个非常理想的女友，做事很有条理有计划性，可以当领导可以打辅助，上得厅堂下得厨房，太完美了，所以对于给她配的cp有些微词，本来主线打完我已经和解了，打了外传又开始意难平了，为什么没有阿野线？？？

[h1]游戏简要介绍：[/h1]
在BG充盈的恋爱文字游戏市场，偶尔也会异军突起呢！《Kindred Spirits on the Roof》（屋檐上的百合灵，其中Kindred Spirits有网络用语真情的意思）就是这样一部由Liar-soft开发MangaGamer发行的百合向文字冒险游戏。作为很多adv玩家百合启蒙作的它虽然游戏目前steam不支持中文，但其独特的CG画面、简洁的UI风格、细腻的描写文本就算放在一众同题材百合作品中也很能打因而圈粉无数。幽灵百合开局、多段恋情描写，带有群像属性量大管饱的它究竟讲述了一段怎样的故事呢？一起来看看吧！

[h1]故事大致流程[/h1]
无所事事的直女高中生YUNA像往常一样在楼顶上吃饭还在无意间撞见穿着一黑一白两个女孩，本来这是一件稀松平常的事，然而对面女孩子的身体却逐渐变得透明。自己这是遇到鬼了？随着“啊！”的一声YUNA冲回了教室。不过诡异的是终究还是发生，教室的任何地方不断出现着血红的大字“教学楼屋顶再见！否则我将诅咒你！”
“所以说，你们真的是两个幽灵！”，放课后单刀赴会的YUNA逐渐了解一切。原来屋顶上的是一对幽灵百合恋人，因为种种原因而不能离世。而唯一的解决办法便是撮合这所名为“城女”的女子高中的LaLa们表达自己的心意来让幽灵获得关于第一次的“知识”。于是就这样，目标是创造“百合乐园”，由高中生YUNA为视角展开的一段段校园百合恋情就此开始！
[h3]评价：[/h3]
游戏共设计了十六位主要角色，算是带了一些群像属性。玩家将在一个类似于旁观者的视角默默帮助学院里的一众女孩。虽然作者的笔力显然不能胜任多对CP使得各个故事都是同样的套路大差不差，但是细腻的文本使得女孩的形象丰满，终于磕到自己喜欢的角色的时候还是挺兴奋的

[h1]翻译极其微妙：[/h1]
由于游戏目前不支持中文，只支持日语和英语，日语就不多说了，所以玩家还是需要一点英语基础的（建议翻译旁备）。而且作为一款“老气很秋”的日系ADV车轱辘话也不可避免，玩家在阅读的时候也学要一点耐心。再以下就来讲一讲游戏阅读的问题和个人体验
[h3]翻译问题：[/h3]
说实话咱们读着日语作品翻译的英文文本这又何尝不是一种NTR？以前在玩些英GAL的时候没有注意到，这下可总算理解了信息传递中的参差。个人先在这里断言，游戏的英翻并不是很好，因为它显然没有做到翻译的一个原则，就是尽量表达原文的同时尊重原文。游戏中有大量的语义修改的桥段，比如原文“我明白了”却翻译为“我同意你的提议”、“但是呢…”直接上个人理解……我真的服了，直接翻译成“I see”、“But umm…”不行嘛？类似的还有不少，我想这大概可能是为了方便读者理解，但是这个真的不需要……
[h3]阅读体验：[/h3]
如果你只是想看女孩子贴贴、说一些情话、故事的大致，游戏的旁白你大多都是可以跳过的。可能这样你会错过女孩子的一些心理描写，但是旁白生词相比于人物对话有非常多的，久读体验实在不太好。同时游戏的语言描写翻译也比较呃，认真严肃吧，完全看不到任何的口头语表达（有点微妙，也可能这是因为女子高中的设定吧）

[h1]其他方面提及[/h1]
CG：有点像老旧的粗线条简笔漫画，洒脱又不失细节非常好看。而且与大部分的adv角色的脸面模板不同，百合灵的美术在极简的同时突出了人物形象，不至于总是对着一样的脸型审美疲劳
UI：风格初见像是日本那边的手绘传单，很可爱，但说实话并不好用。其4：3的屏占比现在有点奇怪，适应就好
最后来说说Liar-soft这个公司（又称骗子社）吧，脱胎于1987年创立的游演体，创作了一些经典的百合游戏。而它给玩家最突出的印象其实是画风，不同于八月社、柚子社等其他会社一看就是同一把刷子，Liar-soft的画面风格根据剧本变动。比如ANIPLEX.EXE发行的《徒花异谭》，为了突出故事的荒诞感，就选用了一种类似于水彩的风格，再比如《堕落少女庭院》就完全是黑暗系了，还有《赫炎》中就是浓浓的赛博风！而适应本作百合校园恋爱的主题彩，《屋檐上百合灵》的画面就是比较清丽，恋爱感十足！
总结：不可多得的百合良作，百合厨千万不要错过的Top1！另外，其DLC是一些广播剧，可买可不买啦

It's probably not worth buying full price, as $35+$10 for the patch that makes it fully voice acted is a bit much. I bought it when the main game was half off, and the patch for the full $10. I definitely feel like I didn't waste a single cent, this is a well done vn.

I occasionally had some issues with booting it up, but it should work fine with default stuff.

Pros: 
A lot of content, I skipped many stories that I don't like and it still took me 20 hours to finish. 
Some of the stories are well written, it touches on topics like comphet and coming out, but never went deep enough to explore these issues seriously, but I guess it was pretty progressive by the Japanese standard in 2012. Overall, if you just want to see gay girls doing gay stuff without heavy drama and angst, it's probably the game for you.
Seina and Miki is the most memorable couple for me, shame they only have so little screen times compared to other boring couples. 
Despite having the generic high school setting, the ghosts and girls paring are interesting to say at least, Megumi and Sachi's relationship development is both the highlight and climax of the story.

Cons: 
Too many couples, not all of them are interesting, the track team drama is stupid especially. 
Yuna and Hina's relationship developed too fast and sudden, and feel forced by the end of the story.
Ano remains single
Too many useless dialogues and inner-monologue 
Some of the voices annoyed me
No real routes, all the choices are useless besides unlocking extra scenarios. 
Some of the characters' action is stupid and ridiculous, like I get it there's gay panic, but do you really have to run around in a campus building to avoid your crush? 
Repetitive music, pretty much 70% of the days use a single song, and it got old quickly.
Overall story is boring, it's hard to get into and many characters are hard to form attachment, I just couldn't care about so many characters. 
High school setting
You have to suffer through 60% of boring dialogues and useless information to see the well written parts, which are mostly close to the end.

All-girl cast.  Voice acting is perfect.  Music is amazing.  All the love stories are great and it's just the best game to start up on those chilly, lonely nights when you want to be by yourself with a cozy story.

Sad that I'm just about done with the game.  I actually finished the game itself (takes over 40 hours if you have the Full Chorus DLC and listen to the audio as you play), but I have to listen to all the audio drama DLCs (there's 6.5 hours of it, all subtitled in English) and I do have the follow-up manga to read.  If you start the audio drama DLCs through Steam, it will count towards your time played.  The Full Chorus DLC itself has a handful of short audio dramas, and sadly these are not accessable through the Steam launcher.  You'll have to dig those up manually.  But the other DLCs actually show up in the launcher and you can log time played with those.

Hopefully I'll come back to this game again soon and replay it from the beginning!  Love is all there is, and this game exemplifies that.  I will definitely be going through this again!  For what it's worth, I took screenshots left and right, and they are the wallpapers on my desktop and my phone, and also the background on my Steam profile (bought with points).  I hope this tells you something about how much I liked this game.

----------------

Some of the technical stuff:

- IMPORTANT! Turn the 'Planner Save Prompt' to 'ON'. It's the last setting on the bottom. This causes the game to pause at the end of each scene and gives you a chance to save the game before moving on to the next scene.  If this option is left at the default (not enabled), you will have to save at awkward points in the game - it won't let you save on the Planner page if you don't change this setting.  Save everytime a scene ends.  There's enough save spaces for this, and you will enjoy the game more if you can start it up everytime and have a clean position to continue.

- IMPORTANT! I'm using Windows 11, and for some reason, when I first boot up Steam on my PC and start this game by clicking the '> PLAY' button, it flickers to the 'X Stop' button, but before the game starts, it goes back to the '> Play' button.  If it does, the game will play, but it won't log the time you played.  You need to exit the game (just keep clicking your mouse until you hit the menu, then exit the game) and start it again. Next time you click the '> Play' button, it will not go back to the '> Play' button, and it will log your time.  Something to watch if you want to log your time correctly.

- Cloud saving doesn't work between Windows PC to Steam Deck.  So if you decide to play this game on both, you'll have to manually transfer your save files.

- The game isn't widescreen. It's in 4:3 aspect ratio.  Just wanted to mention it.

- You can't use the Steam Overlay with this game, so you can't take the usual screenshots in-game, or any of the other usual Steam conveniences you may be used to.  You can take screenshots with your videocard's keyboard shortcut, if that's enabled.

- If you buy the 'Full Chorus' DLC to add full voices to the game (which you should), slide the 'Music Volume' slider to about 33%.  The center of the circle indicator should be in line with the right edge of the 'Full Screen' button above it.  Some of the voices, especially Yuna's, will be hard to hear if you don't turn the music down this much.

- Once you finish the game the first time - and you don't need any guides or tips to do this, just follow your instincts and enjoy yourself - you'll be told you have new 'extra' scenes to play.  At this point, look up the Steam guide to unlocking all the extra scenes.  Very helpful, and you're not cheating.  Newer VNs typically have a story map, and this game didn't have one.  The guide will help you unlock the extra scenes.  Don't torture yourself.

- If you decide you want to buy all of the DLCs for this game like I did, wait for a sale and it'll cost you just under $50.00 US.  The Full Chorus DLC (which to me is mandatory) will add full voices to the dialogue in the game, and it should satisfy you. Getting all the other audio drama DLCs will add little voices here and there to the game, but not necessary.  You might not want to listen to all the audio dramas after playing the game.  Trust me, once you finish the game the first time, the extra scenes that get unlocked will totally exhaust you.  When you finally get the 'Congratulations you finished the whole game' screen, you will be totally satisfied.  You might not even want to go through the audio dramas.  But if you do, the other thing you might want to find outside of Steam is the follow-up manga, which you can find in a complete volume, that continues the story after the game.  I personally went this route.  Still have to do the audio dramas and the manga, which I have already acquired.  Once done, you can go to the Steam points shop and get yourself some nifty wallpapers and emoticons.

[u]Info[/u]
    • While there are choices in this game, they don’t actually change the story. Going through all choices to see different dialogue does unlock extra scenes though.
    • There are some scenes with partial nudity (anime tiddies).

[u]Praises[/u]
    • Numerous absolutely adorable scenes between queer girls. 
    • Lots of humorous moments.
    • Underneath all the cuteness and humor, there are serious topics and events.
    • A bit slow at first, the story does get more interesting the longer it goes on.
    • Yuna’s “ending” is worthwhile to see toward the end of the game.
    • Nice art and CGs.
    • Japanese cultural references. 

[u]Complaints[/u]
    • No Steam overlay, so no screenshots. 
    • Student/teacher relationship. The teacher is 25 and the student is 16 or 17. Even if the teacher looks as young as her students, that doesn’t change the power imbalance. It doesn’t change that the student is a [i]child[/i] and that the teacher is still very much an adult. Any ethical, responsible, and mentally healthy enough adult would have shut down anything of the sort.
    • The word “love” is thrown around way too loosely. This might be a translation thing though. I’m not really sure how Japanese language differentiates romantic “like” and “love.”
    • Sachi’s secret reveal was disappointing and underwhelming. I thought she was hiding something way more interesting.
    • Lack of racial diversity, but that’s typical for Japanese media. 
    • A few typos here and there.

       其优点在其他很多友友的评测中已经说得够多了，我这里说说我个人感觉到的游戏表现出的最大亮点——百合群体这一集体的大爱。

       游戏中的每一对百合情侣在性格设定上或许都不算新鲜，尤其看到结奈对比奈心动的时候，我一度有些反感，已经对女主的感情线不抱有任何兴趣。不过，接着玩下去之后才愈发发现，我不应该单独去看某一对情侣，或者代入某个角色的视角去感受两人的感情；而是，应该把视角拉高一些，同时去感受所有情侣（包括结奈）共同凝聚起来的独属于百合的大爱。
             （以下涉及剧透）
[spoiler]
 结奈在游戏前半段一直以百合骑士的身份、去撮合那些互有心意却不敢迈出第一步的女生，在这个过程中，我们作为玩家很自然地代入了结奈的旁观视角，不断帮助其他情侣，疯狂吃各种口味的糖。、
       
因为这段特殊的经历，结奈的改变是注定的，她理所当然地喜欢上了青梅，然后开始纠结究竟是爱情还是友情，这里的确太老套了。不过呢，在她纠结的时候，她以前帮助过的那些百合情侣们竟然都开始回过头来为她助攻了——这就是这游戏惊艳到我的地方。
       
尽管在ACG中百合的被接受程度很高，但任何作品都不可能打造一个绝对百合乌托邦的，或者说，作者也不会放过现实因素这种能够来点刀推动剧情感情的元素。本作也是浅浅探讨了一下同性恋想要走下去有多困难，而本作给出的一个答案（我认为的）便是百合的大爱。
       
游戏中的每对百合情侣的感情都很纯洁很闪耀，她们成为互相助攻的“战友”，以“百合战友”这样奇妙而真挚的友情一起面对困难，这不禁让我畅想，当她们未来面对一些不得不面对的更大的现实问题，是否也会这样携起手来共同面对呢？我相信是会的。
       
（二度剧透）
      
 在番外漫画（百度就有）的最后一幕中，两位百合灵依偎在榎树上，祝福着树下又一对成功走到一起的百合恋人，这个结局便将我上面提到的大爱抒写得淋漓尽致，玩游戏看到两位百合灵升天解脱我没哭，看到漫画最后她们依然在守护着这所校园里所有的百合情侣时，我真的抑制不住眼泪了。
       
所以啊，本作在“百合的大爱”这一立意上，就已经是我心中的NO.1了，更别提全程高糖和点到为止的清水涩涩。[/spoiler]

The character are all extremely charming in both their visual design and personalities - even those who start out looking like tropes quickly become real people with depth, and I got very invested in all of them. This is helped by the main narrative device which allows it to explore a variety of stories without any of them being cheapened by something like multiple routes.

The first 80% of the game were a pure delight. I cried a lot. The final stretch, while still solid, felt hampered to me by the fact that [spoiler]every sub-story needs to culminate in a Mandatory Sex Scene. For some of them it's a great emotional payoff. For others it feels extremely gratuitous. For a lot of them, the fact that the characters are clearly minors makes the whole thing very awkward and I think the same emotional beats could have been hit in a less graphic way. 

Like I'm not saying to hide away an important aspect of young love. Just that they're sixteen and I didn't need to see their nipples.

At any rate, the way the last moments of the game are spent rapid-firing through a bunch of sometimes gratuitous sex scenes really feels like a concession a different genre's expectations and kind of took me out of the experience. I think the game would have benefited from a less formulaic approach that paid more attention to the global pacing as well as each story's needs.[/spoiler]

With that being said, the main story ended up going to a very surprising and probably kind of controversial place, and I'll count the fact that it managed to keep me on board as a definite win.

All in all a great experience which I warmly recommend, and I really wish I could keep spending more time with these characters.",1674857794,1674858581,True,7,0,0.583833396434783936,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It hits me on a soul level because some of the situations mirror some of my own experiences of my high school days, and also includes a bit of the stigma, shame, and confusion of having feelings for someone of the same gender.

As opposed to playing a traditional romance VN, the main character isn't really the focus of the romance.  It's more about her classmates in varying relationships and how they struggle through them on the path to happiness.  I recommend also picking up the Full Chorus DLC to enable full voice acting for every line.  From memory, most of the important scenes are voiced, but the smaller interactions aren't.

Y con todas las escenas extras. Me llevo más tiempo del que pensé porque tiene más contenido del que me esperaba. Lo jugué con el DLC Full Chorus. El juego me gusto y lo recomiendo pero tiene algunas características que pueden no gustarle a todo el mundo. Are un resumen de sus apartados.

Historia/Personajes: La historia es interesante. Se desarrolla bien y se sigue con interés. Personalmente me parece bastante original. La idea de los espíritus y Yuna funcionando como cupido es de todo menos convencional, y da buen resultado. Los escritores del juego han logrado crear unos personajes que son estereotipos del manga/anime, pero se sienten frescos y tienen profundidad. El desarrollo de las diferentes parejas es muy bueno, no solamente tocando el tema del romance sino en como los personajes superan sus problemas personales a largo del juego. Me gusto especialmente la historia de Miki y Maki. Pero también tengo que decir que el juego tiene muchas escenas de texto redundante, donde una misma escena se ve desde la perspectiva de uno de los miembros de la pareja, que no aporta mucha cosa. Algo parecido pasa con las escenas extras del juego. Había algunas que me sacaron una sonrisa, pero otras me parecieron algo aburridas. Pese a esto creo que este apartado del juego es muy bueno. Ha llegado a conmoverme en algunos momentos.
Gráficos/Arte: Los dibujos de este juego son simples. Los retratos de los personajes tienen bastante variedad de expresiones y lucen bien pese a esto. Las escenas que se desbloquean durante el progreso del juego son quizá demasiado simples para mí. Por cierto, el juego tiene escenas de sexo, pero no es un juego porno. Son escenas bastante normales o “domesticas” si se quiere. Son relativamente realistas. Un aspecto mejorable es que el juego tiene poca resolución (720p más o menos).
Música/voces: Jugué la versión full chorus con las voces completas. Y debo decir que la calidad de los actores de voz es excelente. De lo mejor del juego. La música está bien y encaja muy bien con el ambiente relajado del juego.

En resumen me parece una muy buena novela visual. Uno de los clásicos de este pequeño genero. Pero jueguen de a poco, porque tiene mucho contenido y se pueden cansar rápido si lo quieren terminar de golpe.",1670876572,1670876572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

耐心被耗尽了。
一开始主角的视角中对他人的疏离对我可谓是无比的亲切，这就使我对随后的剧情抱有了非常高的期待。就算之后出现了治愈的内容，告诉我主角一开始的样子只是创伤之后才是那个样子，而随着剧情的推动她会得到治愈，变成常人中也是成功的模样，我也一点也没觉得不适，因为一开始我已经能够欣赏这个角色了。
当我用翻译器看英文的差评时无非就是音乐单调，和强制看完所有人的剧情才能推进这两点。

It was cheap and it was gay. It was one of the first steam games I bought. I have sunk 62 hours of my life into a visual novel that I have a love hate relationship with. On the one hand, some of the couples are really cute. On the other hand some of the other couple, while the game intro screen says otherwise, raise a few red flags for me. I didn't know much about this game going into it so you can imagine my surprise when I figured out the plot was for two ghosts to not only watch a bunch of people have sex but to also eventually have sex themselves using the skills they learned by watching others. This was my first and only visual novel. Yes, I can only play this game once or twice a year because of shame but at this point I have sunk so many hours into this game that I cannot justify to myself not 100% the game. So maybe I will update this review then. On my first playthrough of the base game without seeing the extras I chose Hina. I didn't know that my one true choice in the game would choose who the protagonist got with. I probably would have chose Ana since Yuna was kind of a big sister figure to Hina. I do like Hina better than Ana but I find it weird that Yuna took care of Hina like a little sibling before dating her and didn't really think of Hina as a possible girlfriend until after Hina confessed. I don't know. That is just how I felt. This game has left me in shambles. I completed a computer science degree in the time it took me to even get to the last scene in the game.

Second, yes, this game [i]does[/i] have explicit content, but those scenes are few and far between, and although they do tie into the main plot, they're presented more as a progression of the relationship rather than fanservice to get off to. They probably make up less than 5% of the game, at best. I bought it off a recommendation without knowing the game contained explicit content, and it lined up pretty well with my expectations for that kind of media (minus the initial shock of the premise).

Kindred Spirits on the Roof is probably my favorite piece of yuri media by far, and has a sense of depth and relationship-building you don’t really see in your common “fluff” girl-meets-girl -> confession -> smooth-sailing-lovey-dovey-relationship kind of yuri. It instead chooses to explore the twists and turns that happen during the course of a relationship, and the changes and growth that go along with them. This does mean you might end up reading hours of dialog before the relationships start becoming intimate enough for your liking, which might not work if you’re just looking for a quick yuri fix, but the emotional payoff of it all is definitely worth it. The characters are all well-written and everything’s done tastefully, so I’m sure you’ll love them all in time.

That being said, there are a few iffy parts that might put you off if you don’t have any experience with “anime”-ish plotlines. One of the couples is a student-teacher couple (initiated by the student), and some parts at the end might be considered a bit morally questionable, but honestly, if you’re looking at 18+ anime visual novels, you’re probably used to stuff on that level already. There are also a few “oh no I’m a girl but I’m into girls???” moments, but the game still treats those moments pretty seriously, so I’d say it’s well-handled for a 10-year-old Japanese VN.
 
The VN itself is completely linear (minus some dialog choices which do absolutely nothing but unlock the extra content), and is split into three sections listed on the in-game calendar: bears, cherries, and apples. “Bears” show the events of each day occurring from the perspective of Yuna, the protagonist, and the two “kindred spirits”, Sachi and Megumi. After playing through a number of “bear” events, you’ll unlock the respective “cherry” events for each day, which show those day’s events from the perspective of the couples in the story, and after playing through all those “cherry” events, you’ll unlock more “bear” events. This does mean you’ll have to go through all the events of any couples you don’t like to resume the main story, but I found that seeing how each girl reacts and changes across the course of the story made me love all of them, so it’s not much of an issue. The “apples” are extra content, which you unlock after selecting dialog choices and completing the main game (this means you’ll have to replay each day with dialog choices, press the skip button, and select the other option for each dialog choice). Although it’s “extra” content, it’s still substantial, taking me about ~10 hours with Full Chorus. The extra content only has a few scenes focusing on each couple, which might be disappointing for those just looking for the romance content, but as someone who adheres to the Ano School of Thought, it had some of my favorite scenes in the game, and is well worth playing through.

The game took me about 50 hours to complete with the Full Chorus DLC, I think (don’t remember too well, it’s been a while), but it’ll probably take much less if you’re just running through the base game. I highly recommend playing through with the DLC, although this might not be as important if you don’t know Japanese. It also gets you a couple hours of drama CDs and commentary from the VAs (I think?), which is also pretty nice.

If you're still on the fence, there's a bit more information on the game (and a demo) on the MangaGamer website, although it does have spoilers.

Anyways TL;DR: 11/10 game, buy Full Chorus, I love them all (but especially Hina), Aki x Youka is criminally underrated, and in the words of Kiri, ""I'm gay""",1664857137,1664858252,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

去年重头开始再玩一遍，感觉又不一样，我实在是太喜欢阳香了！！！她好可爱！！她简直是活成了我理想中的青春的样子，她完完全全实现了我青春期对恋爱的所有幻想……尤其是她在完全没有意识到对方是女生的情况下就决定献上爱的告白，实在是太戳我了！！恋爱可不就是这样吗？热烈的，毫无保留的，毫无顾忌的，全力的去爱……她给爱来唱AA爱的时候我是真的有被感动到，更别说那个家伙还直接亲上去了！！七年前的时候我也挺喜欢她俩的，只是还排不上最喜欢，但现在我可以说她俩算是我在屋上百合灵这个世界中最爱的cp了。阳香太可爱了！！元气满满的狗狗和看似禁欲老干部实则天生弯的风纪委员太好磕了！！！唯一有一点遗憾的，就是爱来的cv有点老成了，虽然比较符合人设，但少了点少女的气息，毕竟爱来也是喜欢吃冰淇淋喜欢甜食的小女生嘛……现在回想阳香初登场，一脸慌乱说自己恋爱了，回想起她和阳香在大树底下约好出去一起吃冰，回想起她俩在鼓楼嗯嗯啊啊，回想起爱来把阳香逼进厕所角落，我都会哇酷袜裤，各种dokidoki！！！实在是太爱她俩了！！
另外我比较喜欢的，就是比奈了，七年前只知道看御姐的我哪里知道奶狗的好……她好可爱啊！！比奈的声线太软了，加上吃货无口面瘫属性，和结奈又是青梅竹马，真的很难不喜欢，每次看到被投食的比奈，我的心情就特别的好！唯一有点遗憾的就是，比奈声线太软了，h的时候好容易出戏hhh。但是比奈田径部这个设定真的很可以，爱吃肉也超可爱！！使劲宠她！
三人组其实我也很喜欢她们这种友情，尤其是睡魔这个性格大智若愚，真的很难不爱呢！！沙沙清纯的样子反差萌赛高！
每个cp都很棒，都有很闪光的点，漫画我也看了，也很棒，这个ip应该是没有后续了，比较可惜，我实在是有点想接着这个校园背景看看后面的故事啊……总是意犹未尽……毕竟刚刚在一起就要结束了，糖感觉还没有吃够！！但是知道她们都好好的我就满足了。
虽然我玩的百合游戏不算多，看的百合漫画不算多，但是经典百合动画和轻百合动画还是看了不少，屋上百合灵算是我觉得最能够满足我热爱看少女细腻心思的爱好的一款游戏了，h也多是涩为主，非常的青涩，太尊了！上年纪了，不喜欢看大鱼大肉的h，也不喜欢看特别抓马特别戏剧化的情感线路，就喜欢看小姑娘那些细微的贴近日常的情情爱爱。
这部作品真的很经典了……我喜欢到哪怕b站有录播，曾经也有玩过h片段，我也想补票的程度……如果制作组有余力，能多出些漫画或者出续集就好了，虽然主线故事已经结束啦，两位百合灵也都成佛了，但还是很想看别的cp的日常故事……

游戏采用了日程表，日程表上有一些类似便签的东西，这些可以很好地让玩家想起来之前的剧情，减轻了玩家记忆的压力，再加上游戏轻快的节奏，完全不用担心几天没打开之后会忘记之前的剧情。

虽然故事发生在女校，但是剧情完全没有让人给人过于脱离现实的感觉，相反，我感觉游戏的剧情相当贴近我们的日常生活，这一点或许就是百合灵和Flowers给我带来不同的感受的根本原因，当然，两作我都很喜欢。艺术源于生活而又高于生活，本作切实地让我感受到了这一点。

[h1] 前言 [/h1]
本作是一款由Liar-soft开发，MangaGamer发行的百合向galgame，游戏故事发生在被称作“城女”的商科九星女子学校。在一个平常的一天，主人公远见结奈在天台吃便当，并决定尝一尝朋友给她的糖果，而突然被一黑一白两位学姐搭讪，而在一番对话后，发现两位学姐是在此学校没有毕业就去世的幽灵，因为都有着对女孩子特别喜欢的情感而存留了下来，而让两位幽灵学姐完成心愿才能让她们回归上天。于是可以跟两位幽灵学姐对话的结奈被学姐请求帮助她们，帮助学校里一对又一对的女孩子表达自己的心愿，成为百合恋人，游戏也就此展开了.....
[h1] 游戏体验 [/h1]
本作的日文版早在2012年就已经发售，因此可能一些角色的cg画风并不是很精细，反而是有一种粗糙的感觉，而各个女孩子也没有设计的特别漂亮，而是比较普通，不过正是因为如此设计，通过游戏接触的各个情侣真的能让人感受到百合的美好以及普通人的平凡，可谓是非常优秀了。配合上本作出众的音乐演出，游玩起来十分舒适流畅。并且游戏对各对女孩子的把控设计，情感细腻的设计上也做的十分优秀，跟随剧情读下来就是一种感觉——舒适，让人能感受到这里应该这样子，这里应该H，丝毫没有那种突兀的感觉，非常不错。
[h1] 游戏特色 [/h1]
本作最大的亮点也是与其他galgame不同的地方，本作加入了日程表，通过主视角结奈以及其他各cp视角共同组成游戏剧情，以同一事件不同视角的方式给我们展开，如此设计的优点就是可以让玩家可以从同一事件中感受到旁观者与当事人不同的情感体现，更能体会到人物的情感、故事、非常棒的设计。
[h1] 总结 [/h1]
较为可惜的是本作并没有官方中文，只能通过打补丁加入，不过总体而言本作对于百合向玩家十分友好，对各对cp的感情描写十分细腻，剧本演出十分优秀，加上舒适的音乐以及很棒的视角转换设定，本作是一款优秀的百合向视觉小说了。

I don't want to put too many spoilers here, so I'll keep it short.
Storywise Kindred Spirits on the Roof is just okay. There's a few choices here and there but they ultimately doesn't matter.
I wasn't a big fan of ghost-girlfriends and their storyline, but all other pairings were really good. 
There's something for everyone, even if you don't like particular character.

[b]Characters[/b]
Probably the best part of the game. Each character is different and have their own side-story. 
Extra stories (you'll unlock them after finishing main story) are amazing. It's great to see the story from different POV.
Voice-acting was on point and it makes the characters even better - each girl is different. Hearing them makes everything even more immersive.

[b]Visuals[/b]
High quality backgrounds, character sprites and CGs. I can't tell anything bad about it.

必须要说，时隔多年，当我已经逐渐忘记当年所看过的那些番剧的时候，屋顶上的百合灵的剧情反而愈发鲜活。我记得纱织漆黑的水手服以及寂寞的背影，记得惠在雨中与结奈对视，记得比奈为了结奈翻窗落下，记得阿野明明知晓却又尊重的在一旁守望，记得小牧为了学姐四处奔波，记得学姐鼓起勇气拒绝他人，记得太多太多……
作为一款galgame，屋上的百合灵比起将视线放在作为主角的结奈一个人身上，反而是更多的去描写了一个百合的群像故事，或者说，就是一个群像故事。这一点用现在的眼光来看，也很有意思，业界也很少会有这样的作品。虽然说有些剧情在逻辑上过于牵强，但是至少能做到自圆其说，人物行为逻辑没有问题，总体来说还是有很好的故事性的。虽然文笔上不如同样享有盛誉的flowers出众，但同样也有很好的体验。
美中不足的可能是，作为有选择的galgame，这游戏的选项居然半点用都没有……不过因为缺少资金而被砍掉那也确实没有办法。希望公司可以有朝一日，把欠我的阿野线给我吐出来……！！！！！

It has a cute premise, which is pretty clear on the tin: two untimely deceased girlfriends-nee-lovers who passed with unrequited affections recruit a taciturn student to help them fulfill their unresolved issues(in more ways than one).

The catch, well, they have no idea what being a girl-girl couple means, so that means the main character has to play cupid for them. And if she tries to refuse, one of the two threatens to HAUNT HER FOR ALL TIME.

That's part of my problem with the game. Despite the cute premise, it has some serious tonal whiplash when the ghosts(namely Megumi) try to threaten poor Yuna into helping them out. It feels more hostile than anything, and it left a sour taste in my mouth. Not to mention that some of the couples she help feel somewhat forced. There's a few ""true love"" couples, which are genuinely fun to interact with(namely the trio that has two friends who like each other but are afraid of breaking up their group friendship if they admit it), but there's just as many that are problematic(the teacher/student, which is wrong on many levels, and the story only glosses over it). It might have been nice if the game had the courage to say that some couples just might not work out. I get that the game's premise is a flowery “yuritopia” where nothing ever goes wrong, but the real world isn't always like that, and it would have been more interesting to see the writing tackle those potential issues. What if the teacher shoots down the student? What if they start dating and realize they don't have much in common? Or someone starts cheating on them? All unpleasant outcomes, but real possibilities that happen to actual couples.

These are more broad criticisms, though. Getting down to brass tacks, the characters are well-written, distinct, and fleshed out, and the localization does a fine job of handling their dialogue and personalities. It's the broad strokes of the story I have issues with. I enjoyed the fun couples, but had a tendency to become disinterested during the less interesting ones, but that's just me. I'm sure the game has a coupling for everyone, and they did a good job with fleshing the stories out, but that does little to rectify the problem when the couple itself has a shaky foundation, especially with how manipulative the ghosts can be. An ESPECIALLY problematic element occurs in the final chapter when they made a request of the main character which is wrong on so many levels, and it doesn't feel like she's given much of a choice. Sure, they consent it to it, but the entire scene has an undercurrent of unpleasantness, like they're being violated by these manipulative ghosts and have no real choice but to play along so they can get out of their lives.

It would have been great if Ano(the real best girl) could have just exorcised the two and saved everyone involved a lot of trouble, but then it would've been a pretty short game, no?

TL;DR – a well written and fleshed out VN, with fairly tasteful relationships, but a lot of problematic elements that might put people off, unless you can suspend a lot of disbelief in favor of yuritopia.",1640792402,1640792402,False,20,3,0.660146057605743408,5,False,False,False,False,,,

ในช่วงที่ผ่านมาตั้งแต่กลางปีผมอยากจะหาเกมแนวเนื้อเรื่องเพียวๆซักเกมเล่นเพราะพึ่งอินมากจากหลายเกมก่อนแต่ก็ไม่ค่อยเจอเลย(หรือหาไม่เจอ กำ) จนช่วงปลายตุลาในขณะที่เกมเข้าสู่ช่วง Halloween Sale ไอเราก็นั่งเลื่อนเกมดูไปเรื่อยๆว่าจะมีซักเกมเข้าตามั้ย จนกระทั่งเลื่อนมาเจอเกมนี้ เห้ย แนววิชวลโนเวลด้วย หน้าตาตัวละครน่าสนใจแถมยังเป็นแนวยูริอีกต่างหาก (เผอิญว่าชอบสายยูริ lol) แล้ววางขายตั้งแต่ 2016 อีก นี่กูไปอยู่ไหนมา ทุกอย่างที่เกมเป็นมันสำหรับกูทั้งนั้นทำไมไม่เคยเจอหรือไม่เคยเห็น แต่ราคาเห็นครั้งแรกก็อุ้ย ตอนมันไม่ลดนี่ 600 กว่าๆเลยอ่อ พอมันลดก็เหลือมา 300 กว่าๆ แสดงว่าเกมต้องมีอะไรดีแน่ถึงแอบแพงนิดๆ และพอได้ซื้อมาเล่น... เอาจริงๆ 600 ก็คุ้มหวะ

[h1]เนื้อเรื่องย่อ[/h1]
""โทมิ ยูนะ"" เด็กสาวม.ปลายธรรมดาคนนึงที่เป็นคนไม่ค่อยสุงสิงกับใคร ไม่ค่อยมีเพื่อนมากและมีนิสัยที่ตรงๆคนนึง เวลาอาหารเที่ยงของเธอก็จะชอบไปกินที่ม้านั่งบนดาดฟ้าคนเดียวเพื่อความสงบสุข วันนึงตามปกติที่เธอไปกิน จู่ๆก็ได้ยินเสียงและพบวิญญาณสองตน คือ ""ซาจิ"" เด็กสาวชั้นปี3 ที่ตายไปเมื่อ 80 ปีก่อนด้วยอุบัติเหตุที่โรงเรียนและ ""เมงุมิ"" เด็กสาวชั้นปี 1 ที่ตายไปเมื่อ 30 ปีก่อนด้วยโรคของเธอ ทั้งคู่บอกกับยูนะว่าเป็นวิญญาณที่ติดอยู่ที่โรงเรียนและทั้งคู่ก็รักกันในแบบแฟนหรือที่เรียกว่า ยูริ (ความสัมพันธ์แบบ ญ-ญ) และพวกเธอยังไม่สามารถหลุดพ้นได้เนื่องจากยังไม่มีประสบการณ์ด้านรักแบบตรงๆซักครั้ง ทั้งคู่เล็งเห็นว่าในโรงเรียนที่เธอคอยวนเวียนดูอยู่นั้น มีนักเรียนหลายคนที่มีความรู้สึกภายในใจที่เป็นความรักแบบยูริ แต่ยังไม่มีโอกาสหรือไม่กล้าพอที่จะสารภาพ ทั้งคู่เลยขอให้ยูนะ ผู้ที่เห็นและคุยกับทั้งคู่ได้ช่วยสานฝันของเด็กสาวเหล่านั้นให้สมหวังกับความรักทีก่อนที่จะไม่มีโอกาสและสร้างสถานที่ที่มีความรักในแบบที่ทั้งคู่เรียกว่า ""ยูริโทเปีย (Yuritopia)"" เกิดเป็นเรื่องวุ่นๆที่ทำให้ 3 หน่อต้องเผชิญสถานการณ์รูปแบบต่างๆ ที่ก็ต้องไปพบเจอในเกมและกันนะ..

[h1]คะแนน : 10/10[/h1]
เอาจริงๆนะ... ผมไม่รู้ว่ามีเกมวิชวลโนเวลเกมอื่นที่ดีกว่านี้มั้ยนะแต่สำหรับผม นี่คือหนึ่งในเกมวิชวลโนเวลที่ดีที่สุดเกมนึงเท่าที่เคยเล่นมา อันนี้กล้าโยนให้ 10 ไปเลยซึ่งเอาจริงๆจะหาจุดมาตัดได้มั้ยมันก็มีนะแต่ความรู้สึกผมมันบอกไว้แล้วว่า อย่าไปกดมันเลย ดีซะขนาดนี้เอาตามใจที่อยากให้ไปเลยดีกว่าก็นั่นแหละครับ 10 ไป...

[h1]ข้อดี: Story - เนื้อเรื่องมีความเป็นเส้นตรงสูง ไม่ได้มีจุดพลิกแพลงเยอะ มีปมและปัญหาในทุกๆคู่แม้กระทั่งอดีตของบางคนที่น่าสนใจ เล่าได้สนุกและเหยาะความหวานที่น่ารักจนแทบจะทุบคอมทิ้ง(ไม่ใช่และ)[/h1]
เนื้อเรื่องนั้นเป็นเส้นตรงสูง แต่ก็ไม่ใช่ข้อเสียมากสำหรับผม มีเหตุการณ์ต่างๆหลายอารมณ์ ไม่ได้มีจุดพลิกหรือการเล่นพลิกแพลงอะไร แต่ที่ผมชอบคือทุกคู่ล้วนมี ""ปัญหา"" ซึ่งก็มาในรูปแบบตามนิสัยของแต่ละคู่ที่ต้องเผชิญกัน เล่าได้สนุกมีช่วงโบ๊ะบ๊ะผสมช่วงซีเรียสและทุกคู่จะมีโมเม้นที่ทำให้อยู่ด้วยกันซึ่งบอกตามตรงว่าน่ารักแม่งทุกคนเลย เอาจริงๆกูยังเขินแทนเลย55 พอถึงตอนประเภททั้งคู่มีโมเม้นกันเมื่อไหร่นี่แหม่ โคตรดีย์ และทั้งเกมก็ยาวค่อนข้างมากด้วย ถ้าเล่นทั้งหมดแบบเก็บเนื้อเรื่องหลัก+รอง+ฉากพิเศษที่ต้องไปหาเองอีกทีคิดว่าคงไปได้ 22-23 ชม.เลยแบบเก็บครบทุกอย่างและถ้าไม่กดข้าม Text บ่อยๆด้วยนะ เพราะงั้นฟินกันถ้วนหน้า

[h1]งานพากย์: พากย์ดีทุกคน นี่มันงานพากย์ระดับอนิเมะเรื่องนึงได้เลยนะ โดยเฉพาะเวลาเข้าฉาก 18+...[/h1]
พอเห็นว่าเกมนี้ขนนักพากย์มาเพียบให้เสียงก็รอดูว่าจะเป็นยังไง โอโหว พากย์ดีชิปเป๋ง เสียงทุกคนคือเข้ากับหน้าตาและอารมณ์ในแต่ละซีนมาก โดยเฉพาะเวลาที่ฉากเข้าสู่ช่วง 18+ นั้น... อืมหืม สยิวกิ้วที่หูเป็นอย่างมาก เรียกว่าฟินไปไกลได้เลยมั้ง นี่นักพากย์เค้าเขินกันมั้ยเวลาต้องพากย์ฉากพวกนี้เนี่ย55 ถึงกระนั้นซีนแนวอารมณ์อื่นก็ทำออกมาได้ดีมากทุกคนจริงๆ ถึงจะไม่ได้พากย์ทั้งเกม (ต้องซื้อแบบ Full Chorus ถึงจะมีเสียงแม้กระทั้งเนื้อเรื่องย่อย) แต่พอเนื้อเรื่อเข้าสู่ช่วงสำคัญก็จะมีเสียงพากย์มาตลอดซึ่งทำให้เราอินกับเกมได้มากขึ้น ซึ่งนักพากย์เองก็ทำได้ดี ส่วนตัวไม่มีใครฟังแล้วขัดหูเลย  Spoil เกี่ยวกับนักพากย์เล็กน้อย: [spoiler]เล่นจนจบถึงได้รู้ว่าเค้าใช้นักพากย์ซ้ำหลายตัวละครเลย เค้าดัดเสียงกันเก่งมากเลยหรือหูกูแยกไม่ออก?? แต่พากย์เนียนจริงๆนะ55[/spoiler]

[h1]งานอาร์ต: น่ารักแม่งทุกคนแหละ ออกแบบได้เวิร์คมากรวมถึงภาพประกอบช่วงเนื้อเรื่องนี่มีแต่ภาพน่ารักๆทั้งนั้น[/h1]
อันนี้สนใจตั้งแต่เห็นปกเกมแล้ว และพอได้มาดูเองก็เรียกว่าน่ารักๆมากกับทุกคน ส่วนฉากหลังนี่ทีมงานก็ทำเองขึ้นมาโดยเฉพาะโรงเรียนก็สวยและมีหลายที่ที่ได้ไปซึ่งอาร์ตก็น่าจะเยอะเลย อีกอย่างที่ชอบมากคือ ภาพประกอบช่วงสำคัญของเนื้อเรื่อง ที่มีหลายภาพในแต่ละคู่และ ""แท็กโป๊เปลือย"" ที่เกมได้มานั้นก็ เรียกว่าไม่ได้โป๊จนเห็นหมดขนาดนั้น ส่วนใหญ่ที่เห็นก็แค่ส่วนช่วงบนเท่านั้น เพราะงั้นหายห่วงเรื่องเบื้องล่าง ไม่เถื่อนเกินไป แต่ทุกคู่นี่ภาพเด็ดดวงจริงๆนะ55

[h1]ตัวละคร: ชอบแทบทุกคนโดยเฉพาะตัวเอกอย่างยูนะ มีหลายสีหน้าโดยเฉพาะหน้าเขินกับยิ้มของหลายๆคนนี่ เยี่ยม![/h1]
ทุกคนมีการพัฒนาด้านการเติบโตแต่ที่เห็นได้ชัดที่สุดก็ตัวเอกของเราอย่าง ยูนะ แหละด้วยปมของเจ้าตัวทำให้ไม่ค่อยเปิดใจอะไรมาก สถานการณ์รอบๆตัวก็จะค่อยๆเปลี่ยนบุคลิกไปทีละนิด รวมถึงคู่อื่นๆด้วยที่บางคนนิสัยไม่เข้ากันสุดๆแต่ก็ยังสามารถรักกันได้ มีความต่างหรือเรื่องของการสารภาพหรือพยายามของแต่ละคนที่เรื่องก็ค่อยๆพาให้ทุกคนเข้าใจในด้านความรักของกันและกัน ซึ่งถือว่าดีมากๆที่เกมไม่ได้ทิ้งใครไปแต่จูงไปสู่ความรักในแบบที่แต่ละคนอยากเป็นกัน

[h1]เพลงประกอบ: เกมนี้มีเพลงประกอบฉากที่ค่อนข้างดี แถมยังมีเพลงเปิดกับเพลงปิดเป็นของตัวเองอีกต่างหาก[/h1]
อีกสิ่งหนึ่งที่เกมแนวนี้วิชวลโนเวลหลายตัวมีปัญหากันคือ เพลงประกอบ ที่บางอันไม่ค่อยเข้าพวกหรือทำนองไม่ค่อยซิงค์กับแนวเกม แต่เกมนี้ผมว่ากำลังดีไม่ได้น่ารำคาญ เปิดเพลงคลอเบาๆตอนอ่านนี่ก็ไม่เลวเลย แถมเกมยังมีเพลงเปิดกับเพลงปิดที่คนสร้างเค้าแต่งเองอีก เพลงเปิดนี่เพราะนะแต่ส่วนตัวชอบเพลงปิดมาก เพราะด้วยอารมณ์ที่รู้สึกจบกับเนื้อเรื่องแล้วพอเพลงนี้ขึ้นมาก็รู้สึกว่า อืม.. เราได้เล่นเกมเนื่อเรื่องดีๆอีกเกมนึงจบไปแล้ว (แต่บอกตามตรงว่าตอนเล่นเกมนี้ผมเปิดเพลงอื่นในยูทูปเอา55 คือเป็นนิสัยส่วนตัวที่ไม่ค่อยชอบฟังเพลงในเกมที่เล่นเท่าไหร่ ไม่ใช่ว่าเพลงประกอบไม่ดีนะและอีกอย่างที่อยากตบตัวเองมากคือตอนเพลงปิดมันขึ้นมา คอมมันกระตุกนิดๆเลยเผลอกดข้ามเพลงเพราะนึกว่าคอมค้างไอเวร เลยต้องไปเปิดหาในยูทูปแล้ว ไอห่า กูพลาดมาก)

[h1]ชอบเป็นพิเศษ: ตอนจบ...[/h1]
ไม่รู้สิ สำหรับผมตอนจบของเกมนี้แอบกระแทกใจอยู่เหมือนกัน คือมันไม่ขนาดทำให้ผมเศร้าหรือร้องไห้ ไม่มี แต่ที่ผมรู็สึกคือแบบ ใจหายหวะ แบบ เชี่ย...[spoiler]""ต้องจากกันแล้วเหรอวะ""[/spoiler] แล้วตอนนั้นเปิดเพลงเศร้าคลอไปด้วย อืมหืมมมม แม่มเอ๊ย อารมณ์มาเต็มกะสถานการณ์มาก ด้วยตอนสุดท้ายจะมีความยาวเยอะกว่าตอนอื่นๆเป็นพิเศษ เยอะมากด้วย คิดว่าถ้าอ่าน Text เกือบหมดไม่กดผ่านเร็วๆ น่าจะได้ 1 ชม.-1ชมครึ่งอยู่มั้ง ยาวจริงๆและก็เป็นตอนที่ผมให้ว่าเป็นตอนที่ดีที่สุดในเกม ประทับใจมาก

[h1]ข้อเสีย[/h1]
คือเอาจริงๆมีมั้ยมันมีอยู่แล้วและผมก็พอมองเห็นด้วยแต่ผมนั้นชอบมากๆก็เลยไม่ตัด แต่ถ้าคิดว่าเป็นข้อเสียก็น่าจะมี
-บางตัวละครมีนิสัยแปลกๆหรือสุดโต่งจนบางครั้งเวลาอ่านเราอาจจะรู้สึกหงุดหงิดหรือรำคาญบ้างเป็นบางครั้ง ซึ่งถ้าใครรำคาญมากอาจจะไม่ชอบตัวละครบางคนไปได้เลย
-บางตอนของเนื้อเรื่อง มีปัญหาที่แบบค่อนข้างใช้อารมณ์กันไปนิดและช่วงต้นเรื่องอาจจะปูเนือยๆไปบ้างเลยอาจจะรู้สึกไม่ค่อยชอบบ้างในบางช่วง แต่พวกนี้สำหรับผมไม่ได้เป็นปัญหาขนาดนั้น ยังอ่านสนุกอยู่เลยไม่ถึงขั้นเป็นข้อเสีย
-ถ้าคุณไม่เก่งอิ๊งก็อาจจะลำบากในการเข้าใจหน่อยเพราะศัพท์ในเกมหลายตัวก็เอาเรื่องอยู่ (ขนาดผมก็ยังแปลไม่ออกหลายอันเลยแต่จับใจความสถานการณ์ได้อยู่)

[h1]สรุป: ซื้อได้ก็ซื้อเถอะครับถึงจะพึ่งมาเห็นก็เถอะ นี่คือหนึ่งในเกมแนววิชวลโนเวลที่ดีที่สุดเกมนึงจริงๆ ตัวละครน่ารัก เนื้อเรื่องสนุกและโคตรฟิน ความเป็นยูริจัดเต็ม ฉาก18+ก็ไม่ได้เถื่อนขนาดนั้น เพลงดีและฉากจบที่ส่วนตัวกับผม...ยังแอบคิดถึงอยู่เรื่อยๆเลย[/h1]
คุณอาจจะคิดว่าตั้ง 639 บาทนี่มันแพงไปมั้ยสำหรับเกมแนวนี้แต่เชื่อเถอะ เค้าแพคทั้งเนื้อเรื่องกะงานพากย์ขนาดนี้ ผมว่าคุ้มค่าแน่นอนหรือถ้าห่วงกระเป๋าตังค์จริงๆก็รอตอนมันลดก็ได้ครับเหลือ 300 กว่าๆเหมือนตอนผมเผลอมาเจอเกมนี้ก็เลยได้ซื้อตอนมันลด โอโหว... คุ้มค่าจริงๆ นานๆทีจะเจอเกมแนวนี้แล้วถูกใจกับเนื้อเรื่องและตัวละครมาก รู้สึกคิดถูกที่ตัดสินใจซื้อมา ด้วยความที่เล่นแบบบางวันเว้นวันกว่าจะจบก็ใช้เวลาเป็นเดือนทำให้ผมค่อนข้างผูกพันธ์กันเป็นพิเศษแล้วพอมันถึงตอนจบจริงๆ ถึงจะแอบใจหายนิดๆแต่ก็ต้องก้าวข้ามผ่านไปเจอเกมอื่นๆต่อไป ถึงจะเจอช้าก็ตามแต่ก็นั่นแหละ รู้สึกดีใจที่ทุกคนลงเอยกันได้ดี [spoiler]ถึงแม้จะมีบางคนไม่ได้อยู่ดูจนถึงที่สุดก็ตามแต่อย่างน้อยทั้งคู่ก็จากไปด้วยกันพร้อมรอยยิ้ม[/spoiler] เห้อ...เอาจริงๆเวลาเจอเกมประทับใจมากๆส่วนใหญ่ลืมไม่ลงนี่สิ ฝังจำเข้าสมองไปแล้ว เป็นไปได้ก็อยากลบความทรงจำแล้วมาเจอเกมนี้แบบไม่รู้เรื่องอีกครั้งก็น่าจะดีเหมือนกัน... ขอบคุณที่อ่านนจบครับ^^",1639058107,1687025020,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ngl, I don't like reading, and I also have trouble at reading too, which would make me feel sleepy or maybe fall asleep easily. I suggest try to play and read this with your friends, it's easier to stay awake since you can also discuss and chat with them while reading it.

With the Full Chorus DLC, it's even more fun while listening to the great voice acting of the talented VAs too. And the OST, this game doesn't have much, but they're memorable for a lot moments despite most of it just a repeated soundtracks like in other games.

Overall, one of my favorite game of all time. I bought this because I know there're yuri 18+ scenes in here, but the story amazed me more than that. Sex is just temporary, pure love is eternal.

These kindred spirits are filled with a regret that prevents them from moving on to the next life and recruit Yuna to help fulfill their desires to finally become intimate with each other. In order to do so, Yuna must subtly steer various relationships into romance such that these two spirits can eventually observe them and learn how to become intimate with each other.

While there is a highly exaggerated and unrealistic innocence associated with virtually all of the characters in the story, it hardly diminishes the emotion evoked throughout. The story is told through a number of different perspectives with a fairly unique chapter structure. There is the main storyline where Yuna and the spirits are often discussing their next plan to help the next girl confess her love followed by the same scenes played out from other perspectives. The story is always told through the current character through their thoughts and dialog and I found it be an extremely effective and enjoyable way to experience the narrative. The story spans roughly six months and the calendar-style chapter select screens have dozens of automatic saves, and after the story is completed, dozens more open up providing short little snippets of extra context or perspective of previous scenes. 

The story does contain some adult scenes with mild nudity (nothing you wouldn't see on pay-cable) and while I'm normally a huge fan of sex scenes in visual novels, I actually found the ones here to be a bit unnecessary. They don't occur until very far into the story and since Kindred Spirits on the Roof is much more about the journey than the destination, I ended up finding the romance scenes to be a bit more awkward than sexy. Nevertheless, they certainly aren't distasteful or raunchy, but I didn't really find them very erotic either.

As a full priced visual novel, I do think it's a little skimpy in the CG scene department; there aren't a ton of them (maybe 60-70 + minor variations like an expression change) and the graphics, while nice, are certainly dated being only 800x600 and as there is no Steam overlay support, you need to manually create your own screenshots; which is almost always an annoyance.

And while I can't speak a lick of Japanese, I absolutely recommend the Full Chorus DLC, which provides complete voice over and really brings to life each of the characters. I did find it has one fairly significant problem however, and that is many of the voices are at a very low decibel level and many of them at quite a high decibel level such that playing at a single volume was simply impossible for me. This was true throughout most conversations; one character nearly inaudible with the other practically yelling. And without individual character volumes that you often find in other games, there wasn't much of a solution short of constantly changing my speaker volume.

I really enjoyed Kindred Spirits on the Roof and I highly recommend it to anybody with any sort of soft spot for tales of love but if you came here looking for hot girl-on-girl action, then I think you'll be disappointed.",1636258859,1650739194,True,6,0,0.570405721664428711,0,True,False,False,False,,,

说实在的，对于日式校园视觉小说现在的我是有些抵触心理的，因为太多假大空了，抱着轻松的心情看个乐子没啥问题，但作为正儿八经的情感线来看，总觉得特别空虚。但百合灵还是突破了我的预期，感情描写十分之细腻，有些心理活动令人少女心爆棚的同时还有些小感动、小怅然，部分角色所拥有的不好的经历真实感满满。那些生气时的憋闷吵闹，冲动时的不管不顾，提及未来的忍耐任性，三人行的担忧烦恼，为对方考虑而难以开口，承诺了却又忍不住的靠近，这些影子是学生时代或多或少平凡人都曾有过的经历，确实再日常不过却熟悉到每每令人感慨而怀念。
虽然在百合灵里我们是故事的旁观者，但我要说，这比太多太多担任第一视角的gal强到不知道哪里去了！我认为百合灵不仅仅是一款描述女孩子之间恋情、友情的百合游戏，她的剧情朴素、平静、甚至有些看起来颇为乏味，但她却能勾起你心中对校园生活的回忆、对人际交往的骇然、对美好事物的憧憬、以及永不凋零的对过去、未来无尽的展望。

3. 游戏偏向视觉小说，游戏选项不会过大影响剧情走向。在主线完成后可以游玩外传剧情，对故事和人物进行更加充分的了解。

Cute art, incredible voice acting (if you get Full Chorus), great story and very likable characters. I've honestly never played a yuri VN as good as this. What I liked especially was that the intimate scenes weren't rushed. You didn't get any until probably the second half of the game. They took their time to introduce the characters and build their relationship nicely before giving us any. It felt more realistic and it was satisfying to see them finally doing it. Besides that, they cover quite a few deep topics, like struggles being in a same sex relationship, overcoming trauma, and keeping friendships. There were also a few fun scenes and some really crazy ones, I really do enjoy them as well.

If you enjoy yuri, you will not regret getting this game.
Also, if you want the game to be fully voiced, I suggest getting the Full Chorus DLC. It's quite worth it.

I'd recommend it to anyone play, providing it's okay for them to see partial nudity. There's more than one story here, as you see the lives of multiple female characters as they interact with their daily lives, become closer, and even see stories intersect at times. The characters are all endearing, and it's nice to see how their relationships develop.

There are 18+ scenes, but unlike most visual novels with over-the-top 18+ scenes, with characters that're supposed to know nothing about the topic seem to initiate full-blown professional moves, this one is actually done with care and decency. Which is why, unlike how I normally dislike this sort of material when engaging with visual novels, I liked it here. It utilised these scenes and made them feel natural within the story, so you needn't worry about it 'going too far' or being distracting. So I'd say, if this sort of thing bothers you, it shouldn't be a problem here. Unless you were going into this visual novel for this type of thing, in which case you likely will be disappointed.

It's a fairly long visual novel, but I admit I'm not the fastest reader so it may not take you as long as my record displays. I found this one in particular to be engaging throughout, and I found myself feeling all sorts of emotions, from happiness, to sadness, and even occasionally anger. You will feel a lot playing through this.

I can't quite remember the music from this anymore since it's been a long time since I played it and thus cannot comment on it, though I do recall liking it. Aside from the visual novel itself, there's also drama CDs to listen to once you complete this, so if you're after more content - which doesn't cost much at all - then this would definitely be a good decision. There's also a short continuation manga following different characters, but I personally didn't enjoy this very much and wouldn't recommend it. Still, I thought I should bring it up for those that're desperate for more.

I'm probably forgetting to talk about some things but these are the things that I wanted to bring up, currently. I have played a fair number of visual novels and can't stress enough just how good this one is; how sweet and lovely it is to experience this one. Like I said initially, I recommend anyone to play this one, whether fans of visual novels or not - especially if you're fans, though. I hope you all enjoy experiencing this visual novel and take care.",1622637976,1622637976,True,11,0,0.661205410957336426,0,False,False,False,False,,,

百合树下你和我
百合乡里来百合
欢乐多又多[/h1]
[url= https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/2309404330613380376839] 全语音版百合灵汉化补丁 [/url]
《屋上的百合灵》是Liar-soft制作的成人校园百合恋爱群像AVG，讲述被过往纠缠着的少女结奈与两名百合灵的相遇后，忙碌奔波于为百合情侣秘密牵线，生活逐渐充实，朋友越来越多，属于自己的恋情也开始绽放的温馨故事。游戏以日程表的形式分章节叙事，推进主线后可自由选择支线顺序；多达七对CP的故事同时进行，鲜明的人物形象和各有看点的恋爱进展生动有趣。游戏画风柔和，UI设计出色，通关后另有番外剧情，全语音DLC让作品更具魅力。

[h1]前言[/h1]
Liar-soft，即骗子社，是驰名业界的良心会社，知名的作品有跑路前的星空流星担当剧本的《Forest》、《腐姬》、《SEVEN-BRIDGE》等；桜井光担当剧本的蒸汽朋克系列苍天、赫炎（和猫之日合作发行了中文版）、漆黑、白光、紫影、黄雷和小说为载体的灰烬，可惜绯星和无色咕咕咕了；20年和《ATRI -My Dear Moments-》一起由ANIPLEX发行的《徒花异谭》的剧本则是由海原望负责，风头完全被ATRI盖住了；最近的则是一人全役包圆企画原画剧本的七星電灯的《BETA-SIXDOUZE》……

由睦月たたら负责的本作完全属于百合向，虽然每一对情侣都只有一次H，成人向的CG也并不多，但恋情萌芽与进展到这一步的过程在日程表的日常剧情中描写十分细致，超神辅助远见结奈在百合灵的“诅咒威胁”下忙前忙后也令人感慨万分。

[h1]游戏演出[/h1]
本作标题画面会随机播放角色之一的台词，进入日程表中所有的主线、支线、番外都有着专属的可爱标识，CG则张贴在日程表一侧（可惜ED的CG没有贴上去）。主线以红蓝小熊贴纸区分，支线则以咬过的樱桃区分，番外则是苹果，洋溢着青春的气息，随着节奏欢快的音乐跃动。

游戏美术风格则给人青涩纯洁之感，选项完全不影响剧情发展，打开自动放映即可获得最佳游玩体验。同一CP的剧情会自动标记，无论是按时间顺序还是一对一对推进剧情都没问题。

[h1]剧情描写[/h1]
游戏中除了百合灵，还有6对CP，其中又有两对有着恪守朋友身份的第三人。百合灵纱织和惠是一切的源头，二人相爱却没有结合的知识，意外发现了能够接触的人类远见结奈，就此缠上了她，请求帮助学校中的情侣顺利恋爱，为了二人的百合乡里能够学习到H的知识而努力。因此，学妹与前辈、老师与学生、不良与风纪委员、部长与副部等情侣组合依次出现在了主角面前。此外，还有广播部三人的友谊怪圈，和主角身边的妹妹与挚友。百合灵之间谎言与沉默的爱恋，前辈分清怯懦与热心的区别，老师释然过去的介怀，主角放下内心的负担，又生出对亲情与爱情的迷惘……剧情对少女们的心理描写十分细腻。两盏电灯泡也都像结奈为其他情侣所做的那样支援着好友的恋情。日常剧情和番外剧情则更进一步地完善了各个角色的形象，喜爱百合的玩家一定不要忘记游玩番外！

[h1]结语[/h1]
本作作为百合作品十分优秀，糖分充足，是百合厨无法拒绝的一作，也是一般玩家入坑的上上之选，还有质量非常高的汉化，十分推荐！

The artwork is beautiful, it's extremely well written and the premise is really fun. It is a linear story with no branching plot lines, there are a few choices, but they won't change the ending. If that bothers you, maybe you won't enjoy it as much, but the writing is so good it more than makes up for it for me. It's able to juggle multiple plot points at the same time without being overwhelming.

One of the main problems I usually have with visual novels is the pacing. When people go from strangers to lovers in a matter of days it really takes me out of it, but this vn takes about six months. The relationships have time to build realistically, and the game's calendar system attaches each scene to a specific date, so you know exactly how much time has passed between each event, you can also go back and reread previous scenes whenever you want, which is really convenient. But what makes kindred spirits really unique, is that it gives you the scenes from the perspective of multiple different characters. It really helps you get into everyone's heads, and gives you a complete view of the situation.

The characters are all very fleshed out and likable. I highly recommend the ""full chorus"" dlc which includes all the voice acting. It will cost you a few extra bucks, but hearing all their voices adds so much character. (And it will help you pronounce their names.) Though it is only in Japanese, so be aware of that if you prefer dubs. The character writing is amazing. These girls actually look and act like real teenagers. All the things they struggle with are very believable for their age.

And yes before you ask there are uncensored sex scenes. But honestly, they're more intimate and romantic than outright sexy. Unlike most visual novels I've seen, the sex is actually used to develop the characters and bring them closer. If you removed all the actual sex and just kept the dialog, it would still be great. 

It's an easy 9 out of 10 for me. If you have any interest in yuri anime or visual novels you definitely can't miss out on this one.",1620346620,1620346620,True,24,0,0.736384570598602295,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This isn't my first time going through and it definitely won't be my last!

1.远见结奈，我的超人！
2.摇滚组太甜了，还有专属插曲，牌面！学园祭表白那里真的燃起来了,太感动了呜呜呜呜。真的想不到爱来原来是这么逗的人，双向暗恋赛高！（我是不是剧透了）
3.三人组也好甜，雨中相合伞告白甜炸了。三人之间的感情让我想到了志水老贼，而且我还要拉踩，这不写的比花冬好？（划掉）
4.觉得主角组突兀的可以多玩玩后续的附赠剧情，比奈的戏份几乎全在那里了。比奈真的是小天使啊，斯哈斯哈。但是结奈啊，炼铜还是不好的，桐也是，说你呢！
5.故事形式和人物塑造就不用再吹了吧，真的每个角色都有让人出乎意料的地方。一开始觉得小牧她们组虽然戏份挺多但是形象没立起来，结果到骑士那段就彻底颠覆了认识诶，声优辛苦了。
6.R18只有上半身，不够涩。不得不说其实也算的上是优点了，至少不突兀也不让人觉得不适，冲是没法冲，全程姨母笑就完了。听说还是steam上第一个不用打补丁就能原汁原味体验的R18，针不戳。
7.最后，怎么能没有阿野线？？？阿野！阿野！我的阿野呜呜呜呜呜呜。阿野阿野阿野阿野！我要阿野线啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊我天国的阿野线呜呜呜。
以上，大家晚安，下次见！下次见哦。

当初购买的理由，一是口碑不错，二是有mac版本。mac用户表示，有mac版本这点对日本厂商的视觉小说来说还挺宝贵的。与之对比，欧美人制作的VN普遍是跨平台的。
一遍看下来，感觉不错。视角和游戏系统有特色这个就不说了，另一大感触是这是少数我并不反感其H-scene的黄色游戏。作为对刺激的声音和画面并不感冒的玩家，生平玩过的大部分有18禁元素的游戏，我都是一路快进过H-scene的，并且时常觉得H-scene突兀，为了服务想撸的玩家而H，和游戏的其他部分不能自然结合（例子，key社早期游戏中的H，innocent grey早期游戏中的某些H，毫无准备忽然就脱光光开始搞了，那种感觉）。本作，完全不同，首先剧情的大框架让玩家有心理准备不会被突然雷到，然后整个过程是情到浓时自然而然的发展，表现的方式也不让人反感，没有porn的感觉！
还有一个优点就是主角是有血有肉的，不是工具人，这点和后宫作品中的白板猪脚区别很大。
然后剧情的氛围某种程度上和《终将成为你》类似，普通校园生活，全员人美心善的女学生，甜而不腻，好评！
唯一觉得可能值得商榷的地方，是师生恋。尽管本作中的师生恋是甜蜜的，我觉得师生恋的伦理问题大概还是不能回避的。",1616804644,1616952915,True,15,0,0.68136972188949585,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Вас ждут:
☑ повторяющиеся мысли в диалогах
☑ из раза в раз героини говорят одно и то же в разных местах сюжета
☑ повторение тех же диалогов, но другими словами
☑ одинаковые копирующие друг друга реплики встречаются в разных сценках игры  

Баги:
☐ Эта игра и есть баг
☐ Много, но они не мешают основному геймплею
☐ Игрушка старая, будьте благодарны, что она без трепыханий запускается на 10-ой винде
☐ Иногда попадаются
☐ Не баги, а фичи
☐ Всё продумано до мелочей
☑ Единственный баг этой визуальной новеллы — сюжет 

Что по механикам?
☐ Детективные механики 
(могли бы быть, они бы вписывались в сюжет, но нет)
☐ Классические для визуальных новелл решения с последствиями 
(в Kindred Spirits on the Roof решения ничего не значат)
☐ В этой игре можно делать хоть что-то кроме чтения 
(а ведь во многих визуальных новеллах есть выборы и разветвлённый сюжет, как в School Days, инвентарь как в The Pillars of Earth, мини-игры, как в Dream Daddy)

Темы и архетипы:
☐ Круговорот жизни
☐ Синтоизм
☑ Трогательная первая любовь
☐ Красота мелочей жизни
☐ История метафорична, и каждый может понять её по-своему
☑ Не ждите многого, никакой пищи для размышлений в этой игре нет, только милая неуверенная романтика

Графика:
☐ Сделано на коленке
☐ Пиксельная
☐ Плохо
☐ Среднячок
☑ Милая!💖
☐ Сделано на коленке очень талантливым школьником
☐ Шедевр

Данное произведение окунёт вас в бесконечное однообразие:
☑ Одинаковых сцен, которые приходится проходить по несколько раз от лица разных героинь
☑ Нудных диалогов про экзамены и почти религиозных повторов от каждой героини о том, как важно хорошо учиться, хотя это никак не коррелирует с сюжетом
☑ Одной-единственной песни, которая стоит на повторе в большинстве сцен этой игры (спасибо разработчи_цам за возможность отключить музыку)

说起《屋上的百合灵》，得先说说她的制作组：liar soft 社。这家制作公司，虽然名气一直不大，但可以说是业内少有的几个几乎不关注经济收益，只注重游戏本身创作的良心会社。早些年liar soft 会社被型月社挖走了不少人才，导致人员流失严重。我个人也是型月的头号粉丝，所以在这里很难做评价，只能说心情有些复杂。她们家的作品每一部都透着一股浓浓的文艺范儿，缺少社保内容，缺少明星向热点，总是致力于向读者讲好每一个爱情故事，为此甚至还创立了一个姊妹公司：rail soft社。

说起来让人有些哭笑不得，liar soft 会社惨淡经营了20多年，从来没有一部作品卖火过。非要说之前有什么名气较大的作品，大概只能算得上《腐姬》和《赫炎的印加诺克》了，虽然我知道你们很多小可爱也不知道《腐姬》与《赫炎》（小声哔哔）……近几年，liar soft 社听说倒是傍上了A社和MG这两个大佬，作品一如既往注重讲好故事，一如既往不想发社保，也一如既往卖的不火，不过确实在经费充足的背景下，作品的格调也得到进一步提升。而这一部《Kindred Spirits on the Roof（屋上的百合灵）》，便是大佬MG联合liar soft 社在Steam上发行的原作升级版。至于她们家这从来不卖肉的贞洁烈妇作风是怎么在20多年的风风雨雨中，坚持货到了今日还没倒闭……这或许是一个永远都解不开的谜团。

作为一款渗透着100%百合香气的浓郁百合风AVG，我早在多年前就硬啃着不通的日文，简单地通关过一遍。不过当时介于语言障碍，真的是各种云里雾里，虽然知道故事很精彩，登场人物非常多，但是真的没太玩明白。得益于多年之后的今日，这款游戏待着英文字幕登陆Steam，而且在很多大平台还能找到详尽的汉化补丁，我终于能把这颗沧海遗珠重新拾回，好好品味把玩一番，不得不赞叹：这款游戏真的太棒了。若我这这辈子只能玩一款百合游戏，那必须是《屋上的百合灵》！作为一个资深百合厨（LSP），这部作品无论是从剧情、CV、BGM、玩法、人设、画面等各个方面，都深深戳中了我的喜好。

实话实说，这款游戏无论从任何一个方面说，都是百合控们的终极福音，百合党们神作中的神作。游戏的画面虽然不是那种细腻到每一个细节的风格，但是线条和上色给人一种刚刚好的感觉，无论从哪个角度看，就是特别舒服。基于这点，每个人物给人感觉都看着很顺眼，出场的姑娘非常多，个个都很干净水灵。稍微有些遗憾的是，也许出于经费紧张，《屋上的百合灵》没能做到全程CV，但是所有的对白我都没法跳过，声音踩点很赞，彼此的交流入戏很深，让人不禁陷入到一种温柔的理想乡里，无法自拔。

相比于同样是百合巅峰作的另一款游戏《花吻》，我无意于在这踩一捧一，只是就特色简单做一下比较。《花吻》会更得老绅士们的心，见面没事就脱个衣服，推个倒，卖一波肉，发一轮福利。但是《屋上的百合灵》则更加关注各个人物之间的CP关系以及每段故事中人物们的心态细节变化。本作的心理捕捉处理得非常真实，虽然全作根本没有我们想要的那种画面，但是那并不阻碍我玩这款游戏时，在椅子上开心地扭成一条蛆。作为一款诠释女角色的游戏，其实本作的思维导向并不会很奇特，反而价值观和思维观非常辩证，值得人们深思。

比如说对于恋爱心理学的探讨，我们主流的认知都认为男女之事才是正常的恋爱。但是本作通过一对又一对CP之间各种小故事的细腻写照，不禁让人思考：百合也好，搅基也罢，只要是真心相爱的，又有什么关系呢？游戏中主角们遭遇的很多问题，亦或是身边很多人的鄙夷，恰好也是现实生活中我们遇到或者可能遇到的。通过深挖作品中人物的关系和心理走向，我们真的可以将故事中的她们，投射到现实中的我们。甚至可以说，作品中的很多故事，就想镜子一般曾经发生，或是正在发生于我自己的生活中。少女情怀总是春，当读着一句又一句少女们的心理独白，仿佛那种心声，已经不觉渗透给我们，这份沉浸感让人陶醉。

而这款游戏最值得称道，也是最有特色的地方，在于游戏中玩家的视角处理非常特别。看惯了恋爱中不是扮演甲就是扮演乙的我们，难得这一次扮演了一个第三者，一枚电灯泡。玩家在游戏中扮演的远见结奈，受到两位英灵的驱使，帮助一对对CP开始她们的爱情补完计划。伴随着每一个故事的完结，看遍了每一段爱情的结果，玩家似乎也在修造自己的一份了不起的功德。幽灵们无法彼此触摸，更不要说做羞羞的事情，但是对于对方都有着别样的执念。游戏中用这样特殊的形式，给玩家展示了脱离肉体之外那份真情的美好，虽然没有任何卖肉社保，但是剧情的高度和深度，却早已入臻化境。如果你喜欢纯爱，特别是喜欢百合，那么这款《屋上的百合灵》是你不可以错过的顶级神作。

Uma visual novel yuri aparentemente comum, onde você vai conseguir sua dose diária de meninas gays sendo felizes juntas e é isso. Eu pensava isso quando encontrei o jogo. Foi nuns tempos difíceis pra mim, onde eu mesma estava questionando frequentemente minha própria sexualidade e precisando muito me encontrar mais comigo mesma. Buscava em livros, séries, filmes e jogos por conteúdo LGBTQ+, especificamente lésbico, porque queria muito ter mais contato com essa realidade. Acabei então me deparando com esse jogo, Kindred Spirits on the Roof. 

Fiquei meio com o pé atrás quando encontrei. Muito conteúdo de anime/mangá sexualiza [b]muito[/b] o relacionamento entre garotas, se tornando uma coisa extremamente incômoda, inclusive quando se sabe que foi feito para homens verem e não outras garotas. Então tive medo de KSotR cair no mesmo problema e me render uma experiência no mínimo decepcionante. Mas como eu estava realmente procurando e querendo, dei uma chance no fim sem ter muitas esperanças.

Não vou dar detalhes aqui de como o jogo se passa, mas sim uma visão geral de como é. A história tem como protagonista a Toomi Yuna, que é uma estudante do segundo ano que, de repente num verão, vê duas fantasmas na laje da escola. Depois de uns altos e baixos, ela conversa com as duas e descobre que se tratam de um casal de garotas que morreram e não conseguiram seguir em frente, pois estão presas no mundo dos vivos pelos seus arrependimentos. Yuna descobre, então, que isso se dá por conta dos desejos que ambas possuem, que acabam as acorrentando ali, impedindo-as de descansar. 
É dessa forma que a Yuna acaba tomando o papel de uma espécie de ""cupido das lésbicas"" (nome dado carinhosamente por mim) e precisa ajudar garotas apaixonadas a se resolverem com as meninas que amam. 

Enfim, enquanto escrevo isso ainda não terminei o jogo (apesar de estar bem perto de acabar). Não consegui me segurar, então pode ser que eu tenha mais pra falar depois. Mas o que eu quero dizer com essa recomendação é que esse jogo tem a história lésbica mais sincera e realística que eu já li. Eu nunca tinha tido o prazer de poder ler algo que esquentasse tanto o meu coração e fizesse tanto sentido com os meus próprios sentimentos e questões. 

O jogo não só te joga lá pra ver questões banais e superficiais levando as personagens a interagirem e ficarem juntas. Mesmo nas partes mais bobinhas, o jogo explora profundamente a visão que as personagens têm sobre elas mesmas e a relação disso com a sexualidade delas [spoiler](tudo gay)[/spoiler]. O jogo na verdade traz questões sobre homossexualidade, sobre como é ser homossexual numa sociedade homofóbica, sobre como é querer viver a sua vida com alguém e ter tanto medo de como as outras pessoas vão reagir, de alguém acabar machucando a pessoa que você ama. Então, meu, esse jogo me levou a pensar muito sobre isso e a ver visões diferentes sobre as mesmas coisas. Foi uma experiência… meu, maravilhosa. O tempo todo eu tava perdida pensando em como o roteiro desse jogo é bem escrito. Tipo, mano, se não tiver sido uma mulher lésbica escrevendo eu não acredito em mais nada na minha vida, porque puta que pariu, pega muito sabe!

Então, enfim, eu recomendo enormemente qualquer garota lésbica (e as que não são lésbicas também, é claro) a jogar esse jogo. Mas assim, jogar e aproveitar todas as horas que ele fornece de roteiro bom, porque são muitas. Recomendo porque é bem feito, as meninas não são sexualizadas, os relacionamentos delas são bem aprofundados e desenvolvidos, [i]elas[/i] são aprofundadas e desenvolvidas (nada de personagens superficiais aqui) e, bom, traz felicidade no coração. Ah, mais importante ainda! É uma história lésbica com final feliz (finalmente, pois é!).

[b]PS[/b]: Para quem é sensível com conteúdo sexual esteja avisado que o jogo tem. Eu não diria que é [i]explícito[/i] (porque nas tecnicidades não é mesmo), mas ao mesmo tempo é: você vai ver e ouvir as coisas, mas as ilustrações dos momentos não mostram as genitálias das personagens, e as descrições são muito tranquilas também. Ainda assim tem sexo acontecendo. 
Resolvi avisar porque quando peguei o jogo não sabia que ia ter e sei que pra muita gente isso incomoda bastante. 
Mas esteja avisado também que em comparação ao tempo total de jogo o que se passa de sexo é bem, [i]bem[/i] pouco.

Eu sou 1 grande fã desse jogo. Em partes porque tenho um carinho enorme por ela, por ter sido umas das primeiras VN yuri que eu consumi na vida (muitos anos atrás) e que nossa, só faltei chorar quando ganhei o full chorus~. Ou seja, isso talvez afete muito meu julgamento!

O JOGO é isso mesmo que tá na sinopse, você, com a ajuda dessas fantasmas lésbicas ajuda outros casais wlw se formarem! E veja bem, isso pra mim já é genial (ou estranho) o suficiente para dar 1 chance!! 


[B]ATENÇÃO: esse jogo, as escolhas não afetam em nada. Tu libera uns extras fazendo escolhas diferentes, vê um diálogozinho diferente MAS não muda nada no geral. Não afeta o grande esquema das coisas. [/b]
Por ser caro, eu recomendo pegar 1 promoção! (eu peguei a promo que vinha com tudo e não me arrependo, pois os drama CD são bem legaizinhos)


Não consigo formular algo pra dizer além de Caras, esse jogo é genial, o ritmo dele é incrível. A evolução da Yuna que a gente vai acompanhando é incrível. Simplesmente, a bichinha eh TUDO. A história dela é interessante, realmente te deixa pensando ""meu deus, o que diabos rolou com você, amg?"" ou um ""DESEMBUCHA MINHA FILHA"" de qualquer forma, amo ela!
Meu personagem preferido é a Youka. A maior de todas, e a rota dela, toda a história dela e da Aki para mim são TUDO.

E bem, a rota que eu mENOS me importo é a da Tsukuyo pois ODEIO professor x aluno, se isso não existisse eu seria a mulher mais feliz do mundo.

As cenas de [i]aiaiuiui coisinhas gostosas[/i] acontecem né, eh claro MAS não são tantas. tem pra todo couple. Isso não conta como spoiler? Não né? Anyways.

É um jogo que tem uma história Bizarra com um desenvolvimento interessante, mas se você, assim como eu, não tinha tido tanto contato com esse tipo de conteúdo antes, pode causar um certo O QUE....! que ou vai te prender ainda mais ou vai te fazer querer distância total desse jogo! 
8 ou 80, afinal, NO FINAL DO DIA, É UM JOGO SOBRE FANTASMAS VOYEURS* E UMA MENINA ANIME TENDO QUE SER CUPIDO E APRENDENDO A LIDAR COM SUA PRÓPRIA EXISTÊNCIA!

Aiai, as personagens muito fofas, amo a Hina, parece 1 filhotinho de cachorro véi, she baby. 

(não realmente voyeurs, visto que a ideia que o jogo quer passar eh que elas tão observando unicamente para APRENDEREM algo e não por sentirem prazer ou coisa assim, mas isso parece meio ridiculo falando assim.)

Como sempre, disse tudo e não disse nada! Recomendo que jogar se curtem yuri e comédia e não se incomodem com algumas piadas datadas!

I guess I'd [i]sorta[/i] recommend it. Not really at the price. Get it on sale.
I'm mixed, I actually purchased this thinking illustrator Itou Hachi was involved in it, but she apparently just did the manga adaptation. Anyways,

I see a lot of reviews talking about how ""realistic"" the relationships progress in this game, but I really dont find this to be true. I think it might be realistic to..... overly moe slice of life tropes? But these play out and progress in such bombastic ways. The different relationships here are cute and fun in their own right, but really don't scratch the ""realism"" itch as well as something like Aoi Hana or Yuzumori San. Which, no, media does't have to be realistic to be enjoyable. Not everything has to be rooted in reality or straight faced. Schlocky-ness and overacting has its appeal and I don't tend to emphasize it, but I wouldn't be fooled by the prospect that there's some all girls school in japan where girls act like this and progress relationships in this way. It's over the top, it's kinda dumb, it's clearly unrealistic, but it's fun.

The general set up is pretty great as far as VNs go. Playing cupid for two ghosts who otherwise can't interact with those they look out for is a great start. The main character is blank slate enough to where it's not jarringly different from any projected player personality, but not so boring that she's emotionless and a chore to read the dialogue of. The characters have cute moments but are pretty one dimensional sometimes. There's a few characters that are guilty of being able to be described in a single sentence: their one or two quirks and their appearance.  A lot of anime media is guilty of this, but I think the appeal of Visual Novels is they kind of seek to remedy that.. Which this one finds difficult to do. The girl's interactions range from extremely mundane to........ well, less mundane more enjoyable none the less. The saving grace for what would otherwise be kinda stale interactions is the different perspectives you get to see in a non linear fashion. It's nice to see what people were thinking during certain past scenes, and to see their interpretations of events.

Voice acting is a mixed bag as well. You have a bunch of these over the top squeaky moe characters who just can't stop over acting placed alongside otherwise restrained and pleasant voice acting. Three of the characters have this sorta annoying ""s"" sound that keeps popping out and I can't tell if it's a lisp or just... bad mixing. Speaking of mixing...
THE MUSIC oughhhh.... I've had enough of these three basic school life tracks hahaha. They're not particularly good, not nearly ambient enough. They keep trying to throw in this pop rocky riff and chanting over everyday life dialogue and it's not only loud but just painfully unfitting. It's a 2 minute song loop that demands attention away from dialogue that already isn't that thrilling. It got on my nerves extremely fast...Maybe it wouldn't be so jarring if there were more tracks for these scenarios, but there arent. 

It's cute, it's got a charming setup, but its execution feels really rough around the edges. For 35 dollars (45 with DLC) I feel sorta let down, but I'm not disliking it or anything. It has overwhelmingly positive reviews but I'd be cautious.

I don't want to spoil so I keep it superficial.
You start from the perspective of the protagonist Yuna. While going through the main story you learn more about her and other characters.
Mainly after finishing the main story you get to look under the surface of all characters.
You can read other character's stories in which the characters themselves and their feelings are explained.

This novel in fact contains a student-teacher-romance and yeah, for a good reason it's forbidden in real life, but this is just a novel.
Plus the age gap is not that large and both are mature enough to know what they do.

[i]Kindred Spirits on the Roof[/i] started out pretty promisingly. The characters were cute without being overly saccharine, the setting seemed nice, and I couldn't wait to get back to the game whenever I closed it. I was fully prepared for this to become one of my favourite visual novels, despite not being a yuri fan per se. Unfortunately, this impression started dwindling not even a few hours in.

I think this game has a few issues, the main one being that they tried to fit too many couples in. Despite the main game's length (20+ hours with an average reading speed), you don't really get to know most of them and as a consequence, don't care for them. The game tries to tell you about them instead, with other characters saying ""ah, this girl is so and so"", but a lot of the time you don't really see it. For example, one of the girls is dubbed a ""demon guard"", but at no point was she shown being remotely mean to anyone.  Some of the characters that are introduced later seem very surface-level and tropey, and I just couldn't bring myself to feel invested in their story at all. Additionally, one of the couples is made up of a teacher and an underage student, and the game doesn't point out anything being wrong with it, it's treated as if it's a normal relationship. So... child molestation is okay, as long as it's lesbians?

Another problem directly contributing to the first one is too much filler. The game often goes into needless detail or stretches something that could have been done in a few (in-game) hours over several days. It would be lesser of an issue if it didn't take away from all the time that could have been spent on letting the reader get to know the characters more. By the time the main story ends, you barely know anything about most of the cast, and even though there is a good amount of extra scenes that supposedly could fix that, does it really matter at this point? Why would you read more about the characters the game didn't manage to make you care about in 20+ hours?

The game tries to be realistic - well, minus the ghosts - and take itself seriously, not brushing off lesbian relationships as ""just a phase"" and considering the real-world implications of being gay in Japan. So it's especially jarring to see many of the plot developments, such as many of the characters essentially falling in love at the first sight for no reason at all, or having so many lesbians in one school, despite the known fact that less than 5% of the world population is gay. As you can tell from the Steam store description, the main character herself is in the closet, but the pairing she gets is strange, to say the least. They have no chemistry whatsoever, and their relationship seems anything but romantic in nature even after they get together. They just don't fit together at all, it feels like their ""romance"" was haphazardly thrown together last minute and was pretty badly written as a result.

Overall, this game has the makings of a great yuri visual novel. The writing is pretty good, the sprites are pretty, and the music is pleasant albeit repetitive. It's just a pity that it was all so poorly managed that it fell apart not even halfway in. I went from absolutely loving it in the beginning to finishing it out of obligation.

I'm sorry to say it's the worst I ever played, and I really tried hard. Here is why :
- THE DAMN MUSIC. Oh god, the main 'cheerful' music is terrible, a 10 seconds loop that goes over and over, really cheap and annoying. This music pop out all the time and just simply doesn't fit the mood quite often. I ended up playing without music at all.
- Too much useless filler dialog. A bit of everyday chat is fine to give a realistic touch to the story and get to empathize more with the characters, but the balance is broken here. I'm patient and a good reader, but I just don't see the point of reading 5 minutes about cooking. I fast forwarded many scenes without reading, which never happened to me. I would say 2/3rd of the game are just filler to make it longer, but doesn't bring anything to the story.
- Characters are unrealistic, thus you won't easily empathize with any of the pairings, let aside identify yourself with any of the girls. One girl sleep through all day and speak like a sloth, another one is a teacher that looks like a 10 year old, etc. come on...
- Harem effect, where every damn girl is gay which is unrealistic too
- The gameplay makes the overall story impersonal and hard to connect emotionally with. Playing cupid with various couples just isn't my thing. There is at least one couple (for me all but one) that you won't have interest in / won't like and you will have to read hours about them.

You get to have a lot of time with each of the couples, all of which are profoundly memorable (seriously, even the couple that I thought was gonna be lame ended up being literally the best among a lineup of absolute 10/10 yuri romances), as well as follow a main story that features the drama of trying to get certain couples together, plus some fantastic development of the main character's feelings, all capped off with a bittersweet, highly emotional finale that wrecked me for weeks.

音乐、剧情、立绘、配音等等都非常优秀，吹爆啊，感觉玩起来根本停不下来。
可惜接触到的太晚了，碟以及其他周边什么的都很难收到了，有些遗憾。
游戏本身多多少少有些问题，但是瑕不掩瑜，这依然是一部很优秀的游戏，至少我这么觉得。
以日历的形式在推进主线的过程中多条线推进其他cp剧情，这模式我也很喜欢，蛮有意思的，
就是日历不太好点啊，有时候稍微偏一点就点不开，稍微有点麻烦。
游戏里cp有好几对但是每一对的故事都讲的很清楚，通过女主、两位百合灵以及当事人的不同角度将故事相当完整地呈现了出来。
每个人物都有着自己独特的性格，并没有让人觉得哪个人物的存在是多余的，每一对都有着独立的故事，却又互相联系在一起。
没有阿野线不少人都觉得遗憾，我也觉得有些可惜，不过感觉倒还好，因为在前面剧情的时候看到阿野说了那番话就觉得她俩看来是没戏了，不过看了半天其他cp的时候有想过女主cp会是谁呢，然后想到大概是不太可能出现个新人物，估摸着就是比奈或者阿野了。但是当时真的觉得按照一般游戏的发展邻家妹妹的可能性不大，没想到马上就被打脸，幼驯染赢了。不过小忠犬不是挺好吗，我还真没有觉得结奈跟比奈在一起有什么不好，结奈这样的温柔的妹子由比奈来守护不是也挺好吗，不过游戏里结奈的感情线跟其他几对比起来薄弱了很多啊，有些不够看，不管怎么说官方同人里还是有讲比奈的内心部分，也算是对游戏内容的一个补充了吧，也不算太遗憾。
阿野之前每次都在结奈需要帮助的时候助攻，我就觉得她是不是知道了什么，但是压什么也没说我就觉得可能是我想多了，没想到她居然真的是有意识的在帮忙。
音七跟阿野两个人都是看似随意实际内心非常细腻的人，真的都好温柔啊，没有cp有点可惜，有点能理解她俩cp文出现的原因了hhh。
说起来结奈是我的理想型，这么好的妹子要是能碰到怎么会不想娶回家呢？！羡慕了...比奈快过来跟我决斗（
结奈原来的经历真是让人心疼死了，这么温柔善良的人受到这种待遇真是不公平。看到她最后终于放下当初发生的事带来的影响，虽然欣慰于她终于克服了心理阴影再次前进，可还是觉得生气，凭什么那帮人这么说了还要结奈替她们着想，真有什么意见当面说啊，背地里说这种话还能是没有恶意？真不愿意只说出来我还能佩服一下，只敢背地里嚼舌根算什么东西。真这么不愿意直接拒绝自己来也行啊，还能逼着你不成，结奈不花时间不费精力的吗，一边享受帮助一边说人家坏话还要不要脸了。要是有人愿意这么帮我我感谢还来不及呢，没必要替素质这么差的人找借口。
小牧为美纪前辈差点把摄影部的人打了的时候我真的是想给她拍手叫好，如果当初结奈身边也有这么个人保护她就好了，她就一定不会是玩家刚见到的时候那个样子，虽然看起来很帅气，却是内心受到伤害所做出的自我保护。留校时候的结奈真帅气啊，果然优秀的人怎么都无法掩盖自身的光芒。
希望她们以后能过得更好，一直幸福下去。

~[i]Dalek[/i][/h1]

I'm writing eroge reviews now! Eroge are cool! … Only they're not. At least, in my opinion. And that's the funniest thing here. See, I had all reasons to dislike this game. Not only it can (and should) be considered as eroge, it's also one of those visual novels, in which there are no flags. Well, technically, there [i]are[/i] flags here, but those don't really matter (I'll return to it a bit later). In other words, on paper, this game is everything I dislike. And yet... here's a thumb up from me. Now here's the question - [i]what the heck?[/i] Well, let me explain.

First of all, I kinda dig the title. I mean, the original one, not the one they've made up for an English version. See, this game is all about gay girls. And the original title was [b]Okujō no Yurirei-san[/b] ([b]屋上の百合霊さん[/b]). Which means “[i]Lesbian ghosts from the roof[/i]”. Or “[i]Lesbighosts from the roof[/i]”. And I don't know, there's something really funny in the original title. Something catchy. And the story? It's exactly that. Lesbian ghosts. On the roof.

The game follows the [b]Toomi Yuna[/b], a schoolgirl who just met two ghosts who love each other but... can't pass on. The ghosts ask [b]Yuna[/b] to help them by helping some other young girls who love each other but have serious troubles admitting their feelings and desires. You can see where all this is going and, of course, you're correct. Only don't expect much gameplay. Because [b]Yuna[/b] here is more like a bystander. All she (and therefore – you) can do here is to watch. In other words – you click the left mouse button enough times – you win the game and see the best possible ending for everybody. No way to loose, no real reason for the second run. The choices are there, but first – there are only fifteen of them and second – the only reason for them to exist is to unlock some extra scenes that will become available after you'll finish the main story. In other words, choices are here, but at the same exact time... they're not.

Sounds pretty bad and, well, it is. Personally? I'll never consider this kind of visual novels to be a real deal. [i]But[/i]. This game comes with a set of really awesome characters. It's really, [i]really[/i] hard not to love the girls and seeing them opening to each other? It's a really heartwarming experience. This game is so cute that [b]Ryūgū Rena[/b] would totally want to take it home and characters are very believable. While artwork? It's absolutely brilliant. Not only it fits the atmosphere perfectly, it really makes the game to stand out. It helps the game to keep things cute but not too sugary. Perfect for a yuri game. [b]UI[/b] is also very comfortable and you can set up the game to fit your personal play style.

The most arguable thing here is the eroge element. Like I said at the beginning of this review, I'm not really a fan of eroge genre. And most of the time? This game doesn't feel like eroge. Like... [i]all[/i]. It's a surprisingly pure story about five (technically – six, but I don't want to spoil it to you) couples and their feelings. It's just that – [i]feelings[/i]. Nothing else. At the end of every story, though (the stories take place at the same exact time, but thanks to a very useful [b]UI[/b] you won't get confused), there'll be a sex scene for every couple. And personally? I can't say I liked that. Those kind of ruined the mood for me and after hours of a pure and innocent content having this kind of stuff is... arguable. Can't say those scenes are bad, though. Quite the opposite. Surprisingly, developers were able to keep even sex scenes pure. Believe it or not.

So, even though technically, [b]Okujō no Yurirei-san[/b] is just another eroge with no real choices, there's something very special about it. The game has a soul and even though it's eroge, there's a certain purity in it. As the result, it's totally worth checking even for people like me who usually don't like that kind of stuff. And if you'll like the characters, there's also quite a lot of drama [b]CD[/b]s for you to pick up. Fully translated to [b]English[/b] (subtitles).

Foi uma das primeiras com conteúdo adulto a ser admitida no Steam sem nenhum tipo de corte na época em que jogos do tipo eram restritos por aqui.

Mas apesar da classificação e de existirem sim algumas cenas com conteúdo sexual, elas não são explicitas e tem foco não no ato propriamente dito, mas sim no relacionamento entre os personagens e no sentimento que eles nutrem entre si.

A trama é realmente muito boa e se passa na Academia de Comércio para meninas de Kokonotsuboshi, onde estuda Toomi Yuna, uma garota solitária que costumava fazer suas refeições sozinha durante o intervalo da escola. 

Yuna não era do tipo que gosta de companhia e preferia não se envolver com ninguém. Assim, ela geralmente ia ao terraço, pois lá poderia comer tranquila e apreciar a paisagem sem ser perturbada.

Porém, em um dia normal como qualquer outro, ela foi surpreendida por duas garotas fantasmas, que lhe pediram um favor um tanto quanto inusitado, virando seu mundo de cabeça para baixo.

Yuna inicialmente reluta, mas acaba aceitando, pois acreditava que não teria como se livrar dos fantasmas se não as ajudasse. O problema é que a tarefa consistia em ajudar casais de garotas a criarem coragem de relevar os seus sentimentos umas para as outras.

Conforme a história progride, Yuna aprende mais sobre si mesma, conquista novos amigos e enfrenta muitas dificuldades, mas percebe que ao ajudar os fantasmas do telhado ela também acabou por espantar os seus “fantasmas” do passado.

O jogo progride dia após dia ao longo de alguns meses na escola. Há inclusive um calendário que funciona como um Hub de onde se pode ver cenas que já foram reveladas ou continuar com a campanha, além de transitar entre as diversas histórias paralelas.

Isso porque, depois de presenciar determinado acontecimento na linha principal com Yuna, você também poderá vê-lo da perspectiva de outros personagens envolvidos em quadros específicos de cada um.

Ocorre inclusive de você se encontrar com a própria Yuna na pele de outros personagens e daí você poderá escutar seus pensamentos em reação as respostas que você lhes deu como Yuna quando jogava na linha principal.

Obviamente, isso só é possível porque os personagens são complexos e com a personalidade muito bem construída. Seus desejos e pensamentos ficam claros ao passarmos pelo quadro específico e então tudo se encaixa na linha principal.

A este ponto, você já deve ter percebido, mas vale dizer que Kindred Spirits on the Roof não é um jogo erótico, e, aliás, a primeira cena mais quente só aparece depois de umas dez horas de quase trinta que o jogo tem.

O sexo não é sexo por si só, mas sim o ápice de um relacionamento que foi construído ao longo do semestre escolar, com alguns empurrõezinhos do jogador metido a cupido.

Quanto às escolhas feitas pelo jogador, elas apenas causam ligeiras alterações em algumas falas dos personagens, mas não tem o condão de alterar o curso da história, então não há resposta errada, nem melhor e não há como falhar a história. 

O desfecho é exatamente aquilo que se espera desde o início, mas isso não quer dizer que a trama é previsível. Muito pelo contrário, é cheia de surpresas e muitos dos casos reservam acontecimentos realmente emocionantes.

Em suma, Kindred Spirits on the Roof é uma impressionante Visual Novel, que explora de forma brilhante e delicada a temática do amor entre garotas. No final, o jogo só quer incentivar que as pessoas tenham a coragem necessária para revelar seus sentimentos, sejam eles convencionais ou não.

While they fit into their romance tropes, their respective side stories clarify intent. In many cases, these characters are more aware of the situation unfolding than the perspective you witness. 

Each pair is given ample time to explore their inner strife, but Yuna, the main character, is a master class of her own. It is easy forget between all the yuri-cupidery, that Yuna is her own character. That makes it more pleasant when her arc is completed, providing a satisfying conclusion.

The story requires suspension of reality. The ghosts are an acceptable aspect and fits rather cutely into the story. 
However, their motivation and how they intend to achieve it are dubious. Especially towards a vital point, character choices are a bit ridiculous but necessary for the plot to conclude. The romance plots are contrived, but are not groan-inducing.

I appreciate the consistency between the art of the sprites and the CGs. It is jarring in some VNs when CGs are clearly higher budget than the sprite art. That being said, the CGs are acceptable, if not just for functionality.

Kindred Spirits on the roof praises itself for being the first yuri-based visual novel on Steam that is completely uncensored. I'm sure that this is the reason most people bought this game, which is good, because while it totally caters to and fills all your yuri needs, this game provides you with a whole lot more.

The characters in the game are all hugely diversified. After you've discovered all of the girls and their respective love interest, helping them getting together, you really get attached to every single one of them.
Every character has their own traits, quirks and loveabale characteristics.
Every couple has really wholesome, loveable scenes, you get a lot of laughs from certain characters, some really valuable life lessons that you can apply to yourself irl, as well.

I don't wanna spoiler too much, but i can wholeheartedly say that if you are a fan of visual novels and you want a truely ""wholesome"" experience that is all about girl / girl romance, grab this game, it is totally worth it, it is not an all-out f-fest, it is ""wholesome"" (that is truely the best word for this game) experience with lots of loveable characters and loveable interactions between the couples.
And yes, there are some hardfelt moments and some moments that might make you shed a tear or two, so be prepared for some truely deep storylines.
I haven't completed the game entirely yet, but i think i'm about 75% done and i can definitely say: One of the best games i've ever played.

if you're interested, i'm currently let's playing the game on my channel. New episodes every friday, maybe you'd get a kick out of it in experiencing the ride together. (Shameless self-plug) ;)

I find the planner extremely cute, the spirits well drawn and I often let the game in background while replying to messages enjoying the music.

通关了，，，玩这个真的原地去世，太长了，我的长颈鹿之魂支撑着我。压力马斯内。意见有两个已经有大佬说过了我再啰嗦下。。整体剧情就是女主和幽灵帮助不同的女孩子在一起的很多剧情线，然后女主一条主线。但是说实话女主线剧情有点无趣，选项全是无关紧要的，如果可以我喜欢女主金毛cp（这次是幼驯染战胜天降呢），还有就是koba-youka校园祭那首表白歌旋律想听。
喜欢这游戏有这么几点
1.解释了常识里不合理的东西为合理，tsurugimine-kiri那句“我小时候起就喜欢可爱的女孩子了，好想抱住”。以及忘记谁说的那句“我喜欢的恰好是你，只是你恰好是女孩子”（wakarimashi）
2。感情很细腻，女主从以前一个人孤单到后面慢慢走出来以及接受表白，心理活动描述的很好（究竟什么是爱“loving someone，that feeling ，it's you and yous alone.我翻不好，你自己品）
3.cv超棒，难得的不怎么快进的gal（快进就看不懂也有原因www）画面真的少的不行，但是配音丝毫不逊色，aki（纪检委员）声音太攻了吧，有点出戏。所有cp里个人快进的比较多的是matsuri（没错马自立）和miya（田径组），当然基本剧情还是看完了，最喜欢的cp是最开始的maki和Aihara组（温柔学姐和高一学妹）哇学妹那段怒哄真的吓到我了，cv真的厉害，温柔学妹为了学姐隐忍真实情感（和侑是不是有点像，麻吉天使）。
最后是吐槽，明明是r18游戏吧，前期清水的一批，到1w页时候突然有奇怪剧情我才知道自己买的是r18啊靠（买的时候我真不知道是r18）。还有性教育都不普及的吗，基本kiss后就don't know what to do ？还有师生组kiri说出so you are a virgin?这话太生草了，（随后被tsukyo老师逆推了，可喜可贺可喜可贺）（今晚教你duang大人哦j）这游戏r18部分配音属实顶，建议全部听完。最后，有的画面实在太崩了（当然很多年前的游戏，这太难为他人了），最后幽灵组成佛离开的时候画面也不修一下，我都能给你修好(bushi),明明很悲伤的场景却哭不出来www。
话说好像有汉化补丁？？wtf？？我tm，我还拿小本本记下名字谁是谁。。可能很长时间不会玩gal了，总共24000页我也不知道怎么打完的，还有点成就感？二次元边缘人士表示希望steam上架更多搞姬gal呐。顺便一说玩的大部分时间没网，总游戏时长30h+吧（多线剧情嘛），太长了，，英语垃圾有点崩溃www。以上。",1586516262,1586516262,True,6,1,0.586206912994384766,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Not only is it a mess but most of the desperately needed characterisation is locked away in extra scenes you can only unlock AFTER completing the story.

It's not just the story and it's presentation that's at fault though; if you bought the full chorus DLC you'll be treated to perhaps the worst audio mixing I've ever seen! It's not unbearable but many characters speak at different volumes and across way too wide volume ranges. Combined with a music volume that NEEDS to be lowered in the options before you can play results in a decidedly unprofessional product. A sentiment only furthered by the mediocre unlooped music which will completely cut out leaving you in silence for more than a few seconds before blaring back in all of a sudden in a way that you probably couldn't make more distracting if you tried.

일본애니 특유의 오글오글한 대사, 단어가 굉장히 자연스럽게 의역된 느낌!
그러면서도 의도했던 느낌을 최대한 살렸다.

연출도 메뉴화면부터 엔딩까지 부족함을 찾기가 힘들었다.

스토리의 정교함, 섬세함을 플레이 내내 느낄 수 있었다. 
다른 스토리도 사랑스럽고 멋지지만,
[spoiler]특히 요우카/아키 스토리의 경우 캐릭터 설정, 말 하나 행동 하나 전부 고심한 흔적을 그대로 느낄 수 있었다.[/spoiler]

이것들이 없었다면 클라이막스 떄 캐릭터들이 그렇게 행동할 수 있었을까, 받아들였을 수 있었을까 생각이 든다.

이 게임은 감정 이입하며 플레이해도 괜찮고 잡지 읽듯이 해도 재미있고 설렌다.

무엇보다 캐릭터들이 전부전부 각자의 매력이 잘 묻어나온다. 버릴 캐릭터가 단 하나도 없는게 신기할 정도!
[strike]난 주인공이 젤 이쁘더라[/strike]

아직 어나더 스토리는 안봤지만, 메인, 서브, 어나더 스토리까지 볼 수 있다면 세일할 때는 전혀 아깝지 않다고 생각한다. 애틋함과 여러 종류의 감동은 덤으로!

一是游戏就这么结束了，多少有点不舍。
仅是打折时40块入的，价格并不是多么贵，不过抱着稍微试一试的心态和对骗子社的景仰，便买下了这部美妙的百合游戏。画面的风格已经可以说是完全对的上我的胃口，不华丽也不单调，卡在一个正好的位置，看起来很舒心。音乐的质量也挺不错，但在玩的时间稍微长一点后，发觉到音乐数量是不是太少了点？一段剧情看下来都被一首曲子洗脑半天。

就剧情而言，不带杂质也不带喂屎成分，也并非像一般萌豚百合的GAL一般仅凭着所谓的充满着“可愛さ”的女孩子的卿卿我我来博取女同爱好者的喜欢，起码我是这么认为的；
沙纱&羽美
美夕&茉莉
牧&美纪
阳香&爱来
小月代&桐
无论那一对的百合故事都是基于双方互相了解，并深刻认识对方，可以说是非常正经且又有趣的故事。
[spoiler]那个闪光大作战真是闪瞎眼 [/spoiler]
日历形式的故事推进方法既能在完成主线的时候也能同一时期完成支线，也省下了不停SKIP存档来来回回的麻烦。
虽然这部百合灵有着steam上唯一一部无删减r18游戏的说法，不过充其也就是个噱头，可能是这种程度已经到了不删也无所谓了么？（笑）最多也就是亲亲和摸摸，而且还很短。
整个故事在跟着变为好好先生的结奈送走两位幽灵之后基本就是尾声了，才发现到，“啊，原来已经结束了。”有着这么一种感觉，每次听结奈吧啦吧啦讲一大堆和料理相关的话题的都觉得非常有趣。
虽然把之后还有小苹果的事完全忘了，应该说根本不知道更恰当。


二是，为什么前期给个FLAG让我选插阿野还是比奈，为毛最后结局只有一个?
比奈这声线以及其和结奈的相貌差让我最初一度以为这是高中生姐姐和初中生妹妹在进行对话，一段马铃薯削出情，看到结奈对比奈开始动摇的时候可真把我快吓傻了。。
[spoiler] 为什么？なぜ？WHY？为什么不是阿野！? [/spoiler]
结合外传剧情，我对阿野的好感度甚至超过了之前一直很喜欢的结奈，但没有阿野支线也太过残忍了，各种意义上来说。
[spoiler] なんで、こんなにかわい子があるの！？ [/spoiler]
结果这也变成了这部游戏唯一的残念所在。
[spoiler] 实际在游戏初期，我甚至都不认为结奈会和阿野结上“恋爱”缘，或者说就算有可能也是比较小概率，考虑到游戏中好几个选项询问结奈（玩家）关于同性恋的认知和看法，玩的前期我都笃定结局可能是结奈通过撮合几对情侣改变了自己对同性恋的看法，并也开始与身边的人产生交集，也能够对自己身边的同性朋友们敞开心扉，并非一定是以和阿野恋爱为结局，但之后发现结局居然是和比奈恋爱的时候，我！? [/spoiler]

不过总的来说这也是一部挺好的百合游戏，基本上也是我接触的第一部百合向游戏，在这百合乡呆久了，感觉整个人都快被同化了，之前甚至有为“城女”这所女校里为什么一个男人都没有这种诡异的问题纳闷，第一次看到阳香还以为是个男的然后大惊失色，然后之后又被打脸。。。

这才是我喜欢的清水百合啊！

整体而言是一部较为轻松的百合Gal[strike]比Flowers 春强多了[/strike]。游戏采用了日历的组织形式，同时采用了多POV叙事视角，同一件事可以通过不同人的角度重新体验，还算有趣。剧情不弱智，不怎么媚宅，人物塑造优秀，算上主角一共7对情侣16人（包括两个无恋爱要素的姬友角色），每个人都有自己的个性丝毫不重复，直到现在我也能在脑海中回忆出每个人的特点。最喜欢的一组是摇滚组合，笨蛋与夹击妹抖的组合让我微妙地有一种在看睡觉的笨蛋的错觉，虽然喜爱摇滚的人反了过来，而且我觉得Live那段的演出实在是本篇演出之最了（毕竟这个gal基本没啥演出可言……）。第二喜欢的大概就是圣女与骑士组了，学妹爆发那里声优的演绎真是令人感动。

剧情：日常系百合加上少许的超自然设定（毕竟有幽灵），有些小幽默，不至于太无聊，也不至于出戏。在主角与屋顶的两位百合灵搭话之前，她们已经分别在这个学校呆了30和60年了，所以自然也会让故事带上些许的孤寂感。当幽灵们附身在主角上，用不属于自己的嘴品尝着60年未曾接触过的可乐的味道时，温馨中也有一丝的哀伤。不过故事整体还是比较轻松且积极的，比较适合被现实蹂躏后寻找桃源乡时使用。

画风：我挺喜欢这种画风的，虽然简单但是有着微妙的清新感，具体画风可以通过商店画面看到，各位见仁见智吧。

音乐：还行，就是基本只有几首来回播放，听多了有些疲劳，不过阳香的那个Live很有临场感，我吹爆。

系统：一般般吧，运行时间长了以后会有卡顿的bug，不过不太影响游戏进行。

HScene：没多大意思，不太建议为了这种内容购买。

对了，我对于没有阿野线表示强烈不满，和妹妹只是家人的关系，宅女阿野才是真爱啊！

还有，通关后记得每天的主线选项换着选一下，可以解锁新的附加剧情，附加剧情全部解锁完毕后会解锁通关纪念语音。

In a romance-based work of fiction, I'm primarily looking for depictions of somewhat realistic romantic relationships (starting at friendship and going up through steady dating) between women. I was pretty sure this game was going to be incompatible with those ideas.

I've been sort of afraid of picking up a game like this before - partially because I worried my Steam friends would silently judge me for this (they still will, but I've accepted this burden) and partially because I felt like there wasn't a real chance that I would enjoy it. One of the big issues for me is that I feel uncomfortable in romance games that are overburdened with player choice. While this is a positive feature for many, I don't really want to roleplay with myself being the protagonist of the relationships. I simply enjoy watching other characters experience relationships, so it makes me feel awkward when a game tries to force me into the position of controlling every little detail of the plot. Thankfully, Kindred Spirits on the Roof never made me feel this way (partially due to the fantastic and interesting protagonist, whose actions feel very independent from the player for the most part). The other big issue I often have with romance-based games is fanservice - panty shots, accidental boob grabs, etc. I find those types of antics to be inherently incompatible with my concept of romance. There is none of that at all in this game.

The biggest problem that a Yuri romance work (in any format) has to tackle is the level of seriousness or reality to put into the work. It's such an incredibly fine line to walk, partially because everyone has different tastes. Some people like there to be absolutely zero conflict of any kind - pure and fluffy relationships where everyone is always happy. Others actually want to see the brutal reality and struggle with social stigmas that a homosexual couple would have to endure in order to survive. Some others enjoy a normal level of relationship challenges, where conflicts center primarily around uncertain futures, misunderstandings, or other love interests.

I feel that Kindred Spirits on the Roof strikes exactly the right balance between these different levels of seriousness, at least for me. The societal issues with homosexual relationships are mentioned but are only a true hurdle for very few of the couples in the game. The other couples all have problems of varying levels of seriousness with a whole host of different reasons behind them. I believe the idea was to vary as many circumstances between the couples as possible in order to broaden the range of romantic experiences that the game can showcase. Some of the relationships are mutual love from the start of the game, and others are one-sided initially. One forms in a set of three friends, one forms around an after-school club, and one forms out of disciplinary action of all things. The variety of the characters also comes out in the character design; all of the characters are pretty different looking in terms of hair color, height, face structure, and clothing choices.

There's only a few real cons I can mention for the game, and none are something I consider a real issue. First, the level of naivete shown by the characters regarding sex is unbelievable (literally). These girls are in Japan's equivalent to high school (several of them in the final year of high school), so the idea that not a single couple in the game realizes how two girls can make love is pretty absurd, which can throw a reader out of the experience sometimes. I know that it's cute that they struggle to express their feelings as a result of their lack of understanding, but it did stick out to me here more than usual. Second, if constant plot twists are very important to you, you may not enjoy this game (there's lots of other VN options for that though). While there certainly are some surprises, they aren't earth-shattering ones, and most readers with a keen sense of deduction are probably going to guess pretty quickly who is going to end up with who and how most conflicts will be resolved. Last is not a con but a warning: there's sex scenes in this game. They feature partial nudity (i.e. breasts) and, at least with the 'Full Chorus' DLC (not sure without it), are fully voiced (i.e. expect lewd moaning). Also, the premise of the game has to do with the ghosts wanting to watch people have sex at school so they can figure out how to do it. I didn't personally mind any of this and knew what I was getting into because of the content warnings present on this Steam store page, though I'll mention that I thought the premise was really weird (see point #1 in this paragraph regarding believability) especially since the ghosts have had -30 years- to figure things out before this.

The weirdest thing about this game is that I have very specific tastes, and this game almost perfectly matches them. The game basically feels like it was made specifically for me. So, I guess if you are also me (or can emphasize with some of the preferences I've expressed in this review), then you will enjoy the game greatly too.",1576657930,1576657930,True,4,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,False,,,

我有个近乡情怯式的毛病，就是[strike]爱你在心口难开[/strike]越喜欢的游戏越不敢动笔，[spoiler]比如文档开了两年还没写完一半的Witness [/spoiler]，一怕这点诠才末学在精雕细琢的神作面前只够描述个皮毛，二怕带着粉丝滤镜吹捧过头，反而让玩家期待过高，三当然是逃不掉的剧透问题，尤其是像VN/AVG这样的叙事主导型游戏，些微的剧透都可能影响游戏体验，但往往它最触动人心的精华部分又很难在不剧透的前提下充分展现出来，实在是一个进退两难的问题。
所幸比起稍后要推的G篇的<红弦俱乐部>，L篇的<屋顶上的百合灵>受到剧透的影响并不太大，它是个即使知道了剧情也能看得津津有味的故事。

[h1]正文[/h1]
总的来说，我觉得这是一部很成熟的VN[spoiler]（并不是指R18）[/spoiler]，“成熟”是指制作组完全明白自己想要什么样的作品，对它的优势、风格、目标群体有明确定位和熟练把控。说写校园轻百合就真的是写最普通平凡的女子高中生生活，这些鸡毛蒜皮的琐事和少女情怀，正因为它普通才显得鲜活而生动。[b]它并未优秀到超群绝伦，但也绝不是千人一面，这是一种微妙的恰如其分的好。[/b]剧情、对白、音乐、立绘、配音，不会有任何一部分让你感觉到重心偏颇或喧宾夺主的不自然。
我想即使不是白河豚，也很容易被这种轻松、舒缓、甜蜜而和谐的氛围所带动，个人觉得它作为百合入门作来说再合适不过了。

[b]是的在正文之前我还有点[spoiler]废[/spoiler]话要说[/b]
因为说到LG主题就忍不住想讨论人类五大灵魂拷问之一：

[b]爱（在这里体现为同性之爱）是什么？[/b]

这当然是一个没有标准答案的问题，那问得再详细一点，爱是一种单一的纯粹的排他的情感吗？还是复合的混杂着无数干扰因素的情绪呢？
如果是单一的，那么刨除掉这些因素之后纯粹的爱还剩下什么？
如果是复合的，那么爱是 喜悦、骄傲、陪伴、迁就、占有欲？尊重、理解、情欲、习惯、责任心？怜悯、嫉妒、宽容、信任、满足感？
如果一个人说自己感受到“爱情”，他/她所真正感受到的是这些情绪的排列组合吗？
但亲人、朋友、搭档、同侪之间也同样存在这些感情，究竟哪些该被划分为友情，哪些又该被归因于爱呢？
尤其对于同性的亲朋好友之间，在这情绪的大杂烩里，所谓的“爱情”又占有多少分量？是否足以对彼此的关系做出改变？

当然，我问这些并不是准备说“在这个游戏里你可以找到答案”这样的鬼话，毕竟[b]这个故事的整体基调轻松甜蜜，所谓的思考、纠结、矛盾也无非都是些小打小闹[/b]，而且像这类“永恒的问题”也实在不是一两个故事可以解答得了的。
只是<百合灵>确实给玩家展示了一些典型：一见钟情的前后辈、顾虑重重的师生恋、有时无法互相理解的情侣、从亲人发展为恋人青梅竹马等等……没有插满tag的标准性格，没有五花八门的狗血剧情，每个人都是平凡人，都有缺点，会犯错、冲动、任性、失态，说些不过脑子的糊涂话，但每个人也在学习、成长、相互包容和磨合。
[quote=一条鱼。（此处的爱为泛指）]
（……）
好在那里，坏也在那里。你若要爱他，便要跨过那些错误去爱他。
这就是为什么爱很难。你得容忍对方和愚蠢，容忍对方的刻薄，指出对方的错，理解对方的辩白，指望对方因为爱你而去改正。
这就是为什么爱是一种非常高超的情感技能。它那么难，我们又不是出生就能学会。所以我们只能在爱的关系里学习去爱。很多人学会了，很多人学的磕磕绊绊，很多人在学的过程中犯了错，却还是不想放弃，所以你得连着错的那部分一并原谅。原谅自己的，也原谅对方的。
[/quote]

[h1]真正的正文[/h1]
在谈剧情之前先简单表扬一下美术，担任本作立绘的Peg（ぺぐ）老师作画清新细腻，线条干净，上色简单，人体基本不僵硬，特别适合校园美少女！（P站id=5020，顺便说一句她主页有不少官方糖）而且本作的人设相当细腻，无论是根据自身性格设计的每位角色独有站姿、在领口袖口和毛衣处稍有不同的夏服冬服运动服，还是为数不多但完全贴合剧本描述的特殊动作（比如拿着笔记本的美夕和她身后半侧着身子去看的茉莉），都能看出一种“平平无奇”下的用心。尤其是不少衣服甚至全篇只出场一两次但依然画得很认真（比如比奈的常规校服），以及如果仔细注意的话，阳香在校服衬衫里的T恤至少出现过五个不同花色，广播室三人组夏季合宿的常服T恤颜色是一直在轮换的（女孩子当然是要每天换衣服啦！）
更别说Peg老师完全把握住了西式制服的美！还借着两位幽灵的身份画了水手服！
[spoiler]嗷嗷嗷！赞美JK！[/spoiler]

咳咳，说回剧情，虽然有着“主角能看见幽灵”这样的灵异设定，但<百合灵>的整体剧情仍然十分【寻常】。开头已经说过，我说的寻常是夸奖，可以理解为“好清纯不做作”2333
除了霓虹特色的校园活动之外，本作嬉笑怒骂的日常高中生活描绘实在有很多能让人会心一笑产生共鸣的地方。
剧透↓[spoiler]
“学校里进狗啦！”
结奈的调虎离山计真是充满画面感；

-“为什么连远见同学也要追过来？！”
-“不要问我为什么，解释不清楚！” 
-“不要在学校里奔跑！”
鸡飞狗跳又莫名其妙的走廊追击战；

“如果我是昏睡病，沙纱是耍帅病，羽美你就是没朋友会死病”
谁都有那么一两个烦人又舍不得绝交的朋友吧（笑

“是谁把如此美好的小可爱生育出来的！是你吗！岳母大人！”
“如果不知道哪里的神跟我说‘这是我给你的礼物唷’的话，我就信奉你！绝对！”
哈哈哈哈哈哈是我的心声无误；

“老实说，那个时候很开心。但是，对于已经清醒过来的现在来说，只想把那段时期从人生中抹去。……啊啊，好想人生倒带。只要能遇见那个时候的我，我一定痛揍她一顿让她清醒过来啊！”
在中二时期写了很多关于占卜、死亡、魔法阵一类的非主流文学还起了黑历史玛丽苏名字的沙纱，可能是大部分少女梦的集合体了；

“要怎么做，才能无悔地说句‘太好了’呢？”[/spoiler]

特别害羞的、被稍微表扬一下或者把事情搞砸了就会满脸通红的阿野、虽然有点粗神经但意外地坚持自我的阳香、因为太在意外部评价而不懂得拒绝别人的相原前辈、只知道埋头努力却没能搞定团队关系的结奈、天台的传说、为了赌气的互相爆料、干坏事遇到老师的撒腿就跑、女生间流传的各种稀奇古怪的占卜祈愿法……表现手法上稍微做了点夸张，但事件本身太普通太常见也太真实了，这种鸡飞狗跳的鲜活魅力却唯有靠最普通最常见的无数零零散散的小事才能拼凑成型，这甚至是很多gal不屑于做的事，但往往就是这样，真实的寻常的东西才最打动人。

[h1]Girls’ Love 以下全程剧透 [/h1]
爱令人矛盾，令人勇往直前又瞻前顾后、全神贯注又心猿意马、善解人意又斤斤计较，令人变得奇怪、变得不安、变得不像自己，但不可否认，也会令人变得更好。
<百合灵>里的七对情侣各有特色，[strike]简直可以编一份《恋爱中的傻样·大全》[/strike]，有笨拙的小心翼翼的试探、有被回应后的不知所措、有胡思乱想的纠结和苦恼、也有自以为是的单方面闷气，各种恋爱中人的小毛病小脾气，以一种并不令人讨厌的、轻松愉悦的、美化过的形式展露出来。
[spoiler]
比如说交往五年的茉莉和美夕：
为了避免交往的事被父母知道而受到阻挠，善于思考规划的美夕约定彼此在外低调行事：[b] “走出家门，自己养活自己，活出让别人挑不出毛病的生活，在那一天来临之前，我们都只能算是孩子，从世间的眼光来看就是如此” [/b]，但大大咧咧茉莉却会因为长期没有亲密接触而产生不安感，忍不住在学校对美夕做点接吻以上的事，生气的时候还会拿相识的同性好友作例子说些“比起你还是她更好”的浑话。同样地，美夕也会因为茉莉太受欢迎而被嫉妒支配地说“是因为你总是不知不觉中做出让人误会的事”。
[b] “为什么只有我要这么努力地为各种事情担心呢？但这是很重要的事，经过认真考虑才做下的约定。……为什么只有我在为我们的以后认真打算？”
“我都知道，我理解，但你不能也理解一下我吗？” [/b]
吵架了等对方先服软结果不小心变成冷战——这可能是所有情侣都会经历的事，但游戏比现实更快乐的地方就在于，十几个章节之后双方一定能达成和解：
[b] “我们都想把自己的想法强加于对方，这样是不对的。……我想和美夕走得更远，一直一直走下去。” [/b]
还有，[strike]不以分手为目的的吵架只是在秀恩爱而已吧你们[/strike]

又比如说戏份最多的两对官配：
纱知X惠（百合灵）& 结奈X比奈（主角与她的小青梅）
惠这个角色塑造得很有灵性，天真可爱又自私任性，会因为无聊去扮演“厕所的花子”进行恶作剧，会自得其乐地鼓励来天台的阳香：[b] “虽然我的声音传达不出去，导致对话根本无法成型，但是无所谓啦，懂得享受单方面对话的乐趣，才是优秀的幽灵！” “你在说什么呢，告白这种事，稍微犯一点傻才叫刚刚好呢！可以毫不羞耻地做笨蛋才会做的事，是坠入爱河的人拥有的特权。” [/b]（即使这些话阳香都听不见），会死皮赖脸地在结奈的本子上用血画小兔子，也会为了自己和纱知姐的初体验而强人所难地催促结奈。想要什么东西的时候就会很任性地要求“我要这个！你给我去弄来！”，但你又能感觉到她其实并没有坏心，时不时也会对你关怀有加。
纱知与惠的爱情有点儿戏剧性，纱知生前是个阴沉内向的姑娘，八十年前死于一场意外，由于对没能说出口的暗恋念念不忘，最终成了一名地缚灵，从此开始模仿她所憧憬的那位开朗可靠的暗恋对象的为人处事和一言一行，养成了一副看似稳重优雅的性格，而惠呢本身体弱多病，因为见到了纱知的灵体对她一见钟情，不顾身体地勤来学校，最终导致病情恶化，死后由于对纱知的执念也成为了地缚灵。
这样的两位幽灵，在一起几十年如胶似漆，却各自在心底隐藏着不安，一个认为对方爱的只是自己的假面，不敢向她展现面具底下懦弱的自我，另一个则纠结对方是不是因为对自己的死心怀愧疚和怜悯才同意交往，实际上并未怀有等量的爱意。
但带着假象的爱就不是爱了吗？带着怜悯和同情的爱就是不是爱了吗？
[b] “因为喜欢你而说谎的我，因为喜欢我而沉默的你。虽然坦白了，我们的关系也没有变呢，怀着同样的感情而隐藏着的秘密，都已经传递给对方了吧。” [/b]

在故事的最后部分，结奈被告白的自我纠结阶段，纱知给出了她的最终答案：“同样是‘喜欢’，但每个人的概念都不一样，大家都是这样的。……（80年前）我没有像现在的结奈这么认真地考虑过，我回避了自己的心意。…………（对于结奈）我觉得很羡慕，因为你有从一开就去面对它的勇气。……我遇见结奈后，见过了各种各样的人，她们都怀着不同的心事，她们都很珍惜自己的这份感情，告白的人也好，被告白的人也好，都是这样的。都直率地面对了自己心中，喜欢对方的感情。我也一样。我喜欢惠，这份心意，只有我有。所以呢，结奈，我明白的，喜欢那个人的心情——所谓的恋爱呢，那是——只有自己才有的。……恋爱，是为了自己而生的哦。”

结奈呢，为六对情侣的恋情忙前忙后，却在自己的感情问题上陷入迷惘：
“我不知道。因为，我真的不知道。”
“我……是这么看待比奈的吗？至今，有对比奈动过心吗？还是被比奈告别之后，才产生了类似的感觉？……（从小一起长大）我的这份‘喜欢’和比奈对我的‘喜欢’是相称的吗……我的感觉，和比奈的感觉，有谁能证明不是错觉呢？”
……
“我在害怕，害怕着商量后从园生老师那里得到的回答。害怕也许她会说‘这不是错觉’，但同样也害怕着她说‘可能是误解’”
……
“因为一直在一起，喜欢也是当然的吧。但那说不定是作为妹妹、作为家人的喜欢，或者也说不定，是作为朋友的喜欢。”
“如果答应了之后发现我的喜欢和比奈的不一样，她也会难过的吧？还有我们的父母也是，比奈也是…会带来困扰的吧…”

“那么，把这些你所烦恼的事全部扔掉呢？父母的阻碍、外人的评价、对方的心情这些通通不去考虑之后的答案呢？我想比奈并不是一定要和你交往，只是在期待一个你心底的真实的答案。” 
直女阿野的这句话大概适用于故事里的所有告白，同性间的感情受到外部的负面影响不在少数，像这样的高中生间懵懂的爱慕真的能支撑她们走完人生吗？谁也不知道，但不管怎么说它至少会成为回忆里美好的璀璨的片段，对于故事中这些可爱的花季少女来说，也许即使是前途未卜的恋情，只要自己的心意被传达到、被认真考虑和答复了，就是无比幸运的事。

故事里的结奈在思索了一个月后告诉比奈：
[b] “我想要去回应那坦率又坚定的眼神。想要成为配得上你的自己。想要成为自信的、能和你这样走下去的自己。” [/b]
而故事外的我们则和结奈一起，看着最终达成心愿而往生的百合灵，也看着甜蜜恩爱的一对对年轻的百合恋人们：
“这是没有悲伤也没有难过的分别，这只是为她们启程的送别。”
“再见了，总有一天能再见的。”

[h1]前言[/h1]

《屋上的百合灵》是由Liar-soft开发，还是我们著名的黄油大厂MangaGamer发行，作品最早于2012年就面世了，本作是全语音支持的正式版。感谢[url=https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404330613380376839#_0/]白衣汉化组[/url]让我玩到了完美的汉化版，下面就来简单的说一说本作为什么会被称之为“百合神作”的原因吧。

[h1]剧情[/h1]

主人公——远见 结奈重复着一如既往独自的午后屋顶时光，享受着平静日常的她今日注定不会再平静下去，她在屋顶居然见到了[b]幽灵！[/b]——一对学园内的地缚灵，为什么说是一对呢，因为她们搞百合啊，没见过吧，百合幽灵简称——百合灵！结奈因为未知的原因所以能看到她们，两只可爱又呆萌的幽灵向结奈倾诉了愿望，她们希望结奈帮助她们实现和恋人之间的初体验这种事，那么这种事该如何解决呢，对于这种事都非常困惑的她们给出了办法，那就是帮助这座学园里有百合倾向的女生们促成好事。帮助她们并且排除障碍，促成一对对的百合情侣，主人公的作用就在这里了，而主人公自己深藏的心意能否在撮合别人的过程中表达出去呢？百合灵们又是否能完成愿望好好升天呢？学园里的互怀心事的姑娘们能否修成正果呢？让我们拭目以待吧。

这部作品是2012年的，真的是令我意想不到，我除了这部作品根本没听说过其他在剧情上相似的作品，一般都是描写主人公自己的恋爱，把主人公自己设定为最优先的目标，其余的一切都是衬托主角自己的故事，而这部作品是让你当一个“爱情丘比特”，让你享受帮助别人，撮合别人的快乐，没错，帮助他人确实非常快乐，尤其是这些性格鲜明又塑造饱满的一众妹子，看着她们之间的小剧场真的令我有种看到了活生生的她们在现实中进行磕磕绊绊的百合恋情，除了享受还是享受，当然其中带给我最多的还是感动。

我明白为什么一个大男孩喜欢百合作品了，只有女孩子之间的恋爱才是真的洗涤心灵啊！

[h1]画面&音乐[/h1]

本作可是有年头的老作品了，但在画面上的水准和现在普遍的gal相比也毫不逊色，为什么这么说，因为我个人觉得现在很多的视觉小说类型尤其是gal会着重的美化立绘和场景，但其他的一些东西往往都会“避重就轻”，现在的玩家普遍都挑立绘和画面，之后再挑剧本和其他一些东西，而本作不光画面、音乐、剧本等等合在一起就已经能打败一大票的新游戏了，往往你在体验本作的时候会感觉一切都很合适，很搭配，很自然，立绘和场景可能分辨率低，以你列文虎克的功力可能会看到瑕疵，但你也一定会发出感叹，这他娘的画面就该如此，多一分不多，少一分不少，经典老旧的东西就该要这样，它会令你就像听一首震撼心灵的曲子，余音绕梁三日不绝。

没错啊，光有精美的画面那也只是一层华美的空壳，苍白的剧本无力的角色塑造这些加在一起你能靠画面来吃一辈子吗？不能，而《屋上的百合灵》就能，就算这甜美可爱的画风赶不上时代，就算这欢快动听又悠扬缭绕的音乐在你听来也和周董念经一样的乏味，就算我们听了耳朵都差点怀孕的声优们也令你觉得不过如此，但《百合灵》的剧本一定会把你这对百合无感的糙汉子给改变成喜欢百合纯爱播撒百合种子的园丁。

啊没错，我已经入教了，就在体验过这部作品之后，百合真好啊（感叹）

[h1]总结[/h1]

有很多东西都没有说出来，因为主要还是要让你自己体验，你自己得出的感受才是真实的东西，我只能告诉你这部作品原价买也不亏，体验一次后还远远的没有体验完，值得细细品味再重复重复反复反复体验的作品，如果说这部作品不算神作那我也不知道什么样的作品该称之为神作了，至少，它确实在我心目中是神作。",1571341145,1571341310,True,3,0,0.551085889339447021,0,False,True,False,False,,,

[h1]Thoughts[/h1]
This was my first Yuri from MG aside from Sono Hanabira. Kindred spirit has a very Excellent Story and Characters where the writing and Drama is also over the top from what you could expect from Yuri Story. Though likewise it falls on the Sprite,OST, and engine that support it,
The downside i mentioned above was being an old release so it'll only support 800x600 resolution and it might lag abit with potato PC.
If you fine with it as then you're in for a good Vanilla Story with Drama, Character Progress, and Comedy? Heh.

Overall this is a must own for all Vanilla Yuri Fans, and if you could, go buy the physical as well as MG always has those in Stacks and you can get it from Jlist.",1571116857,1571141441,True,9,1,0.615938842296600342,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The art style is very much on the ""classic"" side. Looks hand drawn and not as saturated as
modern digital anime looks these days.
But that style totally works here.
Steam for some reason does not track my time, it seems. But should be around 40 hrs.
So it's rather long. But I never felt bored.
Had to force myself to stop each evening.

The voice acting is top notch.
But only like hmmm, 30% or so of this novel is actually voiced.
Most of it in the last third of the novel.
I don't understand why they decided to not voice over a lot of scenes, because those
didn't seem to be less important than others.
So I consider this a minus.

The story is very sweet. All of the characters are likable. Some more, some less though.
But in the end, I felt for every couple.

The lewd scenes are all pushed pretty far back towards the finale, which kinda makes sense here.
And you only get ""ecchi"" level of lewdness. The most you will see are nipples. But the primary areas are
tactically hidden under blankets or behind other body parts.
Well. I didn't watch this one for the sex scenes tbh.
The different story routes of the couples are just sweet and touching.
Every couple has it's own unique set of challenges to overcome.
And the last couple that appears can be surprising, if you don't watch the into scenes too closely.
(My suggestion: Don't!)

Another little complaint: Some of the small ""cherry"" scenes only offer redundant conversations from another persons perspective with virtually no additional info for the reader.
So those should have be cut. Luckily, you can skip those in one click if you want.
Oh, and don't just skip all of them. Because some of them actually have important scenes
and one lewd one is also hidden there...

So overall a more soft, more grounded VN.
(even when there is an unrealistic number of female couples. But yeah.)

Absolutely worth it and (if it matters to you), I think this one is 100% enjoyable by both genders.

[u][h1]Style[/h1][/u]
[u]Art[/u]
Simple but well designed characters that have their each distinctive look, something that's often overlooked but kinda important so they can be easily recognised. Art is well done and suits the theme.

[u]Eroge Content[/u]
Yep, no patch needed, its tastefully and appropriately done according to the story, nothing over the top, so if you're looking for pure fap material this might not be it.

[u][h1]Music and sound[/h1][/u]
Excellently done VA which goes with the above mentioned great character design, making the characters memorable and distinctive. Music was also well done, and the OST might be worth a look if you're a music fan.

[u][h1]Story[/h1][/u]
[u]Basics[/u]
A story about first loves and the ups and downs of friendship and highschool life. 

[u]Characters[/u]
The focus of this VN, the characters all have their own stories and lives, which interact and weave together to form unique stories of their own. Multiple couples, each with their own charms and issues, and they're also friends with their own adventures and stories. It's all really well put together, full credit to the writers. 

[u]Plot[/u]
Highschool life, discovering yourself, and discovering love and friendship. We're not breaking new ground here, but it's one of the best done examples of the genre. 

[u][h1]Gameplay[/h1][/u]
Everyone gets their own plots and subplots, because there are both couples and friendships, and it's all interestingly done and paced with a calendar type interface. Some hidden scenes to unlock as well. 

[u]Replayability[/u]
There are some hidden scenes, as well as multiple plots and couples, all with side stories, so a lot to explore here. 

[u][h1]Summary[/h1][/u]
The stories here are about yuri relationships, but even if you're straight, there's nothing alien about trying to figure out your feelings for that person you first fell hard for. Kindred Spirits explores yuri relationships, but beyond that it also looks at adorable friendships and first loves, as well as the trials of a highschool life well lived. Definitely one of the best done VNs out there, and worth a look even if you're not big on the yuri.",1566526365,1634266743,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are numerous reason to recommend ""Kindred spirits on the roof"".
1) The characters: multi-dimensional characters. It is very difficult to elaborate on this without spoilers. Each character is shown is more than one kind of situation and they all reveal more than one side of themselves. They also display varying amounts of growth. As for character development, not everyone gets the same amount of it, but maybe one or two get somewhat neglected. Overall however, no major issues.
2) The visuals: baring the facial features, the characters don't fit into standard anime-style tropes. No spiky hair in weird colours, no aquarium-sized eyes, no exaggerated body proportions.Some CGs lack a bit of depth and appear a little flat, but are still quite pleasant to look at, particularly the colours, but the characters and backgrounds as well.
3) The sound: It gets a little repetitive over time, which given the length of the game can diminish the enjoyment some, but the tunes are overall pleasant, so it's not something to go to war over. Also, it makes Youka's song stand out all the more.
4) The most important, the writing: The situations in which the characters find themselves vary between relaxing, sweet, lively, hectic, dramatic and sometimes even a bit dangerous (by the standards of a slice-of-life visual novel). The focus does remain on the relationship building though, as it's the core element of this game. Each relationship gets sufficient spotlight and they all get their time to develop. None of them feels particularly rushed or dragged out. The multiple POV approach might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's done pretty well. 

Closing note: If you like yuri, you'll love this visual novel. If not, this one might change your mind!

I think good attention and development were given to most of the couples, though I myself was biased to only two of them. I think the porn wasn't necessary. I appreciate the message of ""lesbian love is normal love, that includes up to sexual relations,"" but I feel like an implication and a fade to black would have sufficed just fine. Not to mention they were pretty drawn out and I got bored fast, especially when there's like three sex scenes in a row. Anime girl squealing slaughters my ears too, so that wasn't very pleasant.

The amount of extra scenes is a little crazy. I have to admit I didn't finish them. It's just too much, and at that point it doesn't feel like I'm working towards anything. The main story, though, was very good. I liked the calendar system a lot, and I enjoyed seeing the relationships develop through all the hurdles and setbacks. Makes me wish I could have a girlfriend. It's definitely the best yuri VN I've played, and one of the best yuri stories I've read/seen in general, and I can only hope that in the future we can get more of this quality.",1565995438,1565995438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

《Kindred Spirits on the Roof（屋上的百合灵）》是一款由Liar-soft开发，MangaGamer发行的校园恋爱百合系AVG游戏。游戏的场景发生在商科九星女子学园，主角远见结奈在午休时刻在学校的屋顶遇到了一对百合幽灵，得知她们是原来这座学校的学生，并且带有着强烈的念想，于是游戏也将以此作为契机，为了帮助这对百合幽灵，便开始了学校的百合乐园计划。

[h1] 游戏手绘般的画风显得极为贴切	[/h1]
虽然这款游戏已经老早发布了，但是画风在现在看来很贴切，虽然不是那么的华丽丽，但是这种以手绘向大家展示的形式却是很契合的，将百合的主题突出的淋漓精致，而且给玩家一种温暖舒心的视觉体验，每一个角色的立绘的设计也是尤为漂亮，可以说没有我不爱的，可见游戏的在制作时的美工甚是不错。

[h1] 游戏的CV对白很是出色	[/h1]
这款游戏的CV也是很强大的，主要体现在妹子之间的对白上面，声线十分的优美，听着听着感觉就要怀孕了一般，感染力十足，也正是由于声优们的尽情演出，也让剧情的表现力大大的提高，而且让我们在妹子间的话语之中更能感受到百合无限好的这一特质，所以这部游戏听对白可以说是很不错的享受，温柔的感觉将会将你缓缓围绕。

[h1] 对游戏的剧情一些看法	[/h1]
自从游戏开始了百合幻想乡计划，游戏将以远见结奈旁观者形象，开始帮助各种情侣结对，一旦成功，我们就可以看到那对情侣的百合故事。游戏比较注重于将妹子之间的相知，相遇，相爱的着整个过程的心理描写，所以我们就可以更好的体验到人物之间的内心的变化和感受，并且更加真切的感受到过程的栩栩如生。游戏的主题是百合，但是在现实之中百合却是不被广泛认同的，进而CP组们如果要达到开花结果的程度，那么必然各路的CP组都会遇到他们的难题，难题我认为并不是一种绊脚石，而是一块历练石，CP组们也会因为这些石头而变得更加的成熟，以至于能够更好的加深彼此之间的感情，也刚好说明了困难能够让人在磨砺中变得更成熟的道理。然后就得说一下游戏视角的巧妙性，主角仅仅只是作为一名旁观者从旁边暗中帮助CP们结为情侣，当我们用女主成功的完成任务之后，我们也会感受到一种无上的荣誉感，然后以CP的视角进行故事好像就是给予玩家成功之后的一种奖励一样，这样类似于做任务给奖励的形式我感觉十分符合大多数游戏的经典操作，这样也会极大的鼓励玩家继续进行下去，来开启更多的剧情。

[h1] 游戏的优点	[/h1]
+手绘风十足的人物画面设计
+游戏CV的温柔般对白
+游戏主角视角的绝妙性
+CP组们的细腻的心理描写

[h1] 游戏总评	[/h1]
总体来说，这款游戏还是很不错的，如果你对百合系列不感冒的话，不妨快来尝试一番。

It isn't my favorite genre, and this game doesn't exactly break that mold except for having supernatural elements involved, but I'd say it's the best one I've played. In terms of story, there's the main story and five subplots that all connect to the main. They're character driven, so if you don't like a certain character, you're probably not gonna love their story. Of the five subplots, I'd say one was great, two were good, and the other two were all right but kinda dragged down by one of the two partners involved. The main branch of Kindred Spirits is very good.

This visual novel is pretty kinetic. There's a few choices to make, but none of them affect the story outside a bit of dialogue here and there. The art is good, nothing amazing, but stylized as you'd expect for a yuri story (i.e., soft and rounded). All of the tracks in this are pretty catchy, and there's one song that only plays twice that is awesome (both for what it means in the story and the song itself). Parts of the game can seem repetitive since you go back to certain days to fill in the blanks by looking at the perspective of a different character.

Overall, if you're a fan of yuri, definitely get this game. It tells six stories all at once and does a great job at tying them together. If you can afford it, shell out the cash for the Full Chorus DLC as well. If you're not a fan of yuri but like romance stories, I'd say maybe buy this, but you'll probably only like the main story and a couple of the subplots. For those who don't like romance stories whatsoever, this visual novel is not for you. It's a wholesome story with a fun cast and good characters, definitely one of the best yuri games you'll get on Steam or anywhere else.",1560930965,1560930965,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What I loved the most is the charming characters, the different dynamics for each characters and how each had a different wat of dealing with their romantic feelings for one another. I especially loved the personal story and growth we see for Yuna (Or MC, respectively) as the story progresses.

The mechanics of this game is rather nice. It follows a journal system where we get a mark/sticker/icon for a date where something significant happens that follows the plot. The main story follows mainly Yuna's POV and sometimes her new ghost friends (Sachi and Megumi). Once we complete all ""main story"" plot points for a month we then get to see the POV of the other characters for that month afterwards, mostly from the respective couples focused on that month. It makes this game more engaging despite the story being linear. And while it does have choices those choices are only used to unlock more extra plot points after you complete the game.

As my introduction into the VN realm, Kindred Spirits on the Roof's ""calendar"" format wasn't that hard to jump into. Or... at least I didn't think it was. The pacing could be seen as a little chopping, considering that you often jump back a few days when subplots are opened. If I hadn't played for a while, sometimes I had to backtrack and skim the last interaction the pairing had as a refresher.

The only thing I have negative to say about Kindred Spirits is that it would often freeze on me. Not sure why. My computer was way over the minimum specs needed to play. But the game would freeze on me after, maybe, 30 minutes of game-play. I was able to find a round-about way to play it by opening it through the in-Stream game Properties menu, instead of the desktop icon that I usually use to launch my games. Not that big of a deal, though, it did affect my ""screen-time hours"". I've played this game for about 30+ hours, instead of the 6+ that it's suggesting.

Otherwise, I think that this is a really cute, fluffy wlw game. I bought it on sale, so the 40+ hours or whatever I've spent on it (not counting the extra scenes that were opened when I finished the game because I haven't gotten to those yet), is totally worth it. Some of the couples weren't really my cup of tea/thought were dull, so I pretty much skimmed over the dialogue of their scenes. But overall, the story plot was decent, engaging enough. 

Wasn't a fan of a few of the pairings, and because of my Western upbringing, there were a few moments that felt kinda yicky to me due because of the fetishizing of some of the characters due to their physical traits. SPOILERS: [spoiler]Kiri's fetishization of Tsukuyo's small and ""kawaii"" stature was cringe-worthy to me, to say the least. Don't get me wrong, I love me some smol and tol pairings. But, it felt like one of the biggest reasons Kiri was into Tsukuyu was because Tsukuyu was short and petite. And I don't really want to get into the way that Yuna and Hina got together. It felt borderline incest-ey because they'd been portrayed like sisters for the first half of the VN. Yuna felt like a motherly big sister, and Hina treated her like such. Made me cringe when I got to those parts.[/spoiler]

The fact that it has so many couples  was making me feel exhausted but I'm not gonna lie, I truly enjoyed all of the couples stories, it never ceased to amaze me how their relationship was developing. That adds +1.

I was also surprised by the fact it has voice acting but not through all the novel though. The thing that adds +1 to this point is that it has a DLC with more scenes and a full voice acting that I'm planning to get later.

I truly enjoyed the Kindred Spirits and some of their characters, as I said before having many couples was exhausting and some of them really tired me and I was just thinking ""I need to finish it to advance with the main story, what a pain"" but more couples extends the story and the outcomes where kind of unexpected to me that left me in awe.

I would say I give 9/10 since I needed to have a Hina perspective from all this. 

3 out of 5 points so I'll definetely play it the Full Chorus Version to unlock them all.

As a gay dude who likes anime, I often stray into yuri territory because yaoi is - almost always - absolutely repugnant garbage. This time, so is the yuri.
There is a really fantastic, gay, VN in here somewhere, with interesting, cute, and fleshed out characters. However, the couple whose entire dynamic seems to be relentless sexual assault and sexual-pressuring is exactly the reason why this sub-genre is viewed so negatively. What's more, the game seems to want to frame this routine assault as ""well both girls are wrong in their  own ways!"" when in reality one girl is being sexually assaulted bordering on partner-rape on one occasion, and the game seems totally fine with portraying this dynamic as a quirk of the characters.

Kindred Spirits on the Roof, also known as Okujou no Yurirei-san, is an excellently written, as well as translated, visual novel with great character development and a satisfying payoff in the ending, that I would personally highly recommend.

  First off, the story is pretty good. The base premise is fairly interesting and creates a whole slew of pretty hilarious and also lots of really sweet moments when reading, what with the protagonist, Toomi Yuna, being the 'yuri cupid' of the story. The drama that occurs between the characters is definitely one of the strong points of the VN, and the occasional friction between the cast members makes you really feel for them. Conflicts between the characters and their resolutions are all very reasonable, and god they are seriously well-written.

  The characters, their development, and their writing are for sure the best aspect of KSotR, at least in my opinion. Every single main couple has their own unique little chemistry going on, and the dialogue is super fun to read, not to mention fluffy. This being a fairly long visual novel, taking me over 40 hours to finish the main story and all the extra scenes, allows the characters to develop at a natural pace, and it's really nice to see the interactions between specific characters changing over time. As a high schooler myself, some these characters are also reaaaally relatable. Especially Futano Sasa.

  As for the art and sound, the artstyle for the VN fits perfectly, and the CGs look awesome. The illustrations in this VN are really good at expressing the characters' personalities, the character designs are great(ly cute), and the background art's nice as well, the BGs do a great job at setting the scene. Speaking of which, the music in Kindred Spirits also does a great job at setting the mood of the scene. The soundtrack only includes 15 different tracks, but that's not really a bad thing. They really grow on you, and they're one of the reasons why the slice of life type scenes in this game are so relaxing. The music is cute and fitting as well.

  TL;DR, the writing for the story and characters are really good. You get ultra-fluffy yuri romance and intense yuri drama, a lot of the dialogue is absolutely hilarious too, and really, every character has a ton of depth to them. The art is great and so is the music, and really, if you're a VN person or like yuri, I'd definitely recommend this game. Thanks for reading this review, by the way.

Long have I been wanting a detailed, imaginative yuri visual novel with multiple hours of playtime and a realistic take on romance between women. This is exactly that. As a queer girl, I find that games centered around lesbians and yuri often only focus on the sexual aspects, never accurately representing the emotional, loving parts of the relationship. While this game certainly delivers on some risqué scenes, it really takes your breath away with the cute and heartwarming encounters between characters; particularly of those between love interests.

First off, the soundtrack is really nice to listen to. I wouldn't call it mindblowingly amazing or anything, but the few songs that you do hear are really nice and fit the casual, relaxed tone of the game. There are a few sound effects too, which fit in well with the environment, although I thought some of them like the cicadas could be a bit too loud and distracting. The voice actors are amazing! I must commend all of these lovely ladies for putting their hearts and souls into their performances - no matter the situation, they seemed to nail their lines, and all of their voices were very unique and recognizable from each other. And don't even get me started on the artwork, absolutely stunning. It's not top of the line stuff to be sure, but I LOVE the simplicity of each CG and character sprite, while still being adorable and drawn with so much care. I'd fall in love with any of these girls, honestly lol.

There weren't too many bad things about this game. I would say that it is actually worth its normal price, as I got nearly 30 hours of playtime out of the game fully completed, and there is also extra content at the end (although I am the type of person to listen to every single voice line and read at a moderate pace, so take that as you will). Some scenes did seem a bit dragged on more than they needed to be, and [spoiler]it kind of annoyed me that these HIGH SCHOOL AGE girls seemed to know NOTHING about sex, and that the erotic scenes had them moaning like crazy over a freaking boob squeeze[/spoiler], but overall my complaints are few and far between. The characters were lovable, and their personalities were so different and brought out the best in each other. Their humor and quirks had me smirking and laughing many times throughout the game. One or two scenes even got me a bit teary-eyed. The worst thing about Kindred Spirits on the Roof was that it had to end, but I will keep the memories of it with me for a long time to come.

It shows a faithful text adventure plot as the structure of 'main story - side story - epilogue'. Because of this, the playtime is quite long. If you do not skip the voiced sections it will take about 30 ~ 40 hours until the ending, and then it will take about 50 hours until you finish. However, it is a little disappointing that only major events support voices. Nonetheless, their voices are good enough. This game offers a satisfying amount of story with voices and music to match. Everything is in harmony.

The game 'music' is great. It's good music that makes the game atmosphere feel pleasant. But the songs are few unfortunately compared to other text adventure games. The number of songs you have available in the gallery is fifteen excluding the hidden tracks. So even though it's not a lot of music, I'm sure you'll still be satisfied with the OST.

Game 'convenience' was better than I thought. In particular, the gallery has a fairly intuitive interface because it is right next to the story scene. However, it may be a little awkward that the save & load does not appear on the Planer screen. In other words, it is difficult for the player to identify the diverging point until the story has proceeded. And there are some pause problems in the game but it won't bother you too much. Because the story of this game is quite good, I think players can overcome it enough to reach the end of the game. The translation isn't bad at all but if you do understand Japanese, you will probably enjoy the game more.

The conclusion is that 'Kindred Spirits on the Roof' is a very suitable game for entering the genre of text adventures. I highly recommend it. It would be even better if we could continue to see these kinds of games in the future.

Игра является кинетической новеллой, где в итоге все линии сводятся в одну концовку. Сюжет игры разворачивается в очень классической атмосфере для многих аниме и визуальных новелл - старшей школе японского образца. В игре 16 героев, каждый из них обладает собственной уникальной личностью, следить за взаимодействием персонажей на протяжении игры всей игры - одно удовольствие, конечно же, если Вам, опять же, по вкусу жанр юри. Повествование интересно, но не не блещет мегаострыми поворотами, просто спокойная романтическая сюжетка между разными персонажами. Лично у меня на прохождение заняло около 46 часов в сумме, правда я не парился особо выходя из игры чтобы сбегать в туалет и все такое.

Рисовка на самом деле на любителя, напоминает больше какие-то аниме мультфильмы в стиле 90-х годов прошло века. Бывает намного красивее, все же мне нравятся более красочные новеллы с яркой рисовкой, огромными глазами, няшными неко-ушками или что-то вроде того, хотя это дело субъективное, но не суть - персонажи здесь проработаны и прорисованы неплохо, голоса озвучены, актеры сыграли хорошо, отлично передавая эмоции и атмосферу в нужный момент. 

Романтической составляющей и постельных сцен здесь тоже хватает, но тоже все банально на уровне - первый секс, ахи-вздохи, ""что же мы творим"", ""я не хочу, но не могу остановиться"", и все такое ;)

В заключение скажу, что новеллу я бы охарактеризовал как крепкий середнячок, с одной стороны здесь есть все - увлекательный сюжет, приятная рисовка, качественная озвучка, но как будто чего-то не хватает, до шедевра все же далеко. Да и ничего нового в жанр игра не привносит - старая добрая школьная ВН о романтике и любви. Это не плохо и не хорошо, это средне.",1540625857,1540633025,True,3,0,0.484350979328155518,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- des personnages super attachants et bien développés
- lesdits personnages ont des rapports les uns avec les autres, et pas seulement avec les membres de leur propre route

- une durée de vie hors-pair (25h pour moi, et je lis vite!)
- un système de jeu un peu différent qui fait qu'on peut voir les routes dans l'ordre qu'on veut, non chronologiquement
- un personnage principal qui a une vrai personalité

Les points faibles:
- La musique peut être très agaçante et/ou innappropriée pour certaines scènes
- jeu kinétique (les choix n'ont pas d'importance. C'est pas vraiment un point faible mais ça peut en déplaire à certains.)
- 2/3 routes commencent par un coup de foudre et certains (moi) peuvent ne pas aimer
- no spoiler mais Sachi a beaucoup de tension pour une révélation au final qui... euh... éxiste? Qui casse pas trois pattes à un canard.

[strike]Único problema dessa VN eh a resolução que nem dah pra mudar(e qd em fullscreen sobrepõe a tela de modo que nem Ctrl+Alt+Del adianta para mudar de janela) e a incompatibilidade da engine da VN com o Steam Achievements que ñ permitiu a VN ter nem conquistas(tanto que o Steam Overlay tb ñ funfa aqui),e qt a mim único problema que deu foi na ED que ñ rodou o video sendo que ele abre corretamente na pasta da VN e.e[/strike](atualizando aqui,a VN ganhou uma build nv que resolveu ao menos teh aonde vi o problema da fullscreen e dos videos de OP e ED porém os saves da build antiga ñ funfam nessa nv build e ñ irei voltar pra antiga msm inda ñ tendo a expansão Full Chorus,resumindo eu realmente terei que reler td assim que eu tiver ela)
Para análises de VNs irei colocar tópicos diferentes do que coloco nas análises de games ._.

[h1]Sinopse[/h1]
Td começa com Toomi Yuna que vivia isolada no terraço de um colégio feminino chamado Shouka Kokonotsuboshi Joshi Gakuen(aka Shirojo) e era assim teh que 2 espíritos intitulados como Yurireis(ou Kindred Spirits como ficou na adaptação da Mangagamer) vieram insistemente propor a ela ser cupido oculto de casais de garotas e assim formar a chamada Yuritopia,e a partir disso td começa a mudar drasticamente na vida dela ^^

[h1]Conjunto[/h1]
CGs lindas msm com a resolução travada nos 800x600,músicas lindas que grudam como chiclete na cabeça,história que ensina mt do universo yuri além de ser bem construída e sem pontas soltas,chars bem carismáticas e nenhuma desperta ranço algum que seja,orange scenes que apelam mais pro romance do que pro sexual e atuação de voz que infelizmente ñ tah presente em tdas situações da VN(algo que soh foi corrigido na expansão [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/995610/Kindred_Spirits_on_the_Roof_Full_Chorus]Full Chorus[/url],fazendo assim eu e mts que jah leram do jeito que está reler td de nv) TT_TT

[h1]Leitura[/h1]
Tem nd mt interativo visto que as decisões tomadas por Yuna-san afetam em nd o decorrer da VN porém nem dah pra afirmar que eh uma kinect novel,eu diria que tah mais pra uma VN pure love por ñ ter bad endings nem nd do tipo ._.
As cenas e momentos da VN são separadas em dias de abril teh novembro e podem ser lidas a qqer momento conforme o andamento da VN,e conforme vai-se lendo a VN o title screen acaba por ter leves alterações,eu pessoalmente curto td essa atenção inclusive em detalhes tão pequenos como esse ^^
E ñ tem como colocar cores diferentes para txts jah lidos assim como ocorreu com SHUFFLE!,Da Capo e outras VNs que a MG jah lançou ._.

[h1]Extras[/h1]
Após a história principal são desbloqueadas as Extra Scenes(tem tb as que são desbloqueadas selecionando tal decisão em certos dias) que complementam a história principal e 4 Drama CDs que por incrível que pareça a MG lançou td sem faltar nd(teh hj ela tah devendo mt coisa de SHUFFLE! e Da Capo) e com vídeos legendados em inglês para ter ao menos uma noção do que se eh falado neles jah que a maioria inclusive os americanos ñ sabem JP,esses Drama CDs se passam após a VN então pra quem curtiu bastante recomendo adquirir eles tb(inda preciso ouví-los então análise deles irei fazer assim que eu conseguir) ^^

And completing all of the extra scenes after the credits roll is essential in my mind.

An unexpectedly good VN with interesting, realistic characters who feel like real people, both in looks (human rather than photoshopped supermodels) and personality (you won't find anyone here who sits in a trope), and a story which, whilst not intense, is certainly sufficient to make you want to keep going.
The soundtrack, whilst (very) limited (~10 songs are used for the actual novel content), but there are two hidden gems among the music tracks (A A AI is way too catchy).

The art was beautiful, the song was catchy, and I loved the trailer. I expected it to be good, of course, but I never expected it to be as good as it actually is.

Kindred Spirits on the Roof follows Yuna, an extremely considerate girl who, due to some circumstances, started avoiding people. This changes completely, however, after she starts seeing two ghosts - or, as they prefer being called, kindred spirits - on the rooftop of her school. Since she's the only one capable of seeing them, they quickly ask for her help to pass on: They want her to help the girls in her school who love others girls to be able to confess their love and start a relationship! - A yuritopia. So, Yuna embarks on this not so easy task. 

This game is so good it's actually pretty hard to point out all good things in it. I mean, I can't just say ""everything"", can I? But, yes, it's pretty much that. There are plenty of characters and romance for you to see developing, and ALL the characters are completely unique. Their personalities and hobbies are different, and you feel like they are all real people. Something that really caught my attention was also that, besides seeing Yuna version of things, you also get the opportunity to see these other girls sides on things. This make such a big difference - and also make you fall in love with absolutely all of them. 

Kindred Spirits has only a few choices - which don't matter, they only unlock some secret scenes. What does it mean, then? That it is basically a kinectic visual novel. Now, this is something that might've put me off if I knew it before playing the game, but man, they do a kinectic visual novel WELL. Since the story is super interesting, you get caught in it fast, and the calendar let's you follow different girls in different days, in the order you want, which makes it feels like you're actually making choices and actively playing. I basically pay no mind that this is a kinectic visual novel. I don't even REALIZE it is. This is how great this game is. 

The romance is also the forte in the game. We have many couples and each of them have different chemistry, way to deal with things and all that. It feels very real to see their love blossoming. Of course, I have some couples that I love way more than others - how could I not? - but, in general, I pretty much love all of them. The game makes a good job on making some mysterious stuff for you to slowly find out during the storyline, which makes you crave for more and makes it hard to close the game. 

Simply put, Kindred Spirits is a really, really good game. Romance and light novel fans will love it, and everyone who likes a good story will too.",1531336546,1606769147,True,24,0,0.734887659549713135,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I will say that some plot threads felt tedious and unnecessary but the overall flow of the story was fine and perfectly enjoyable. The trepidations of the main character, Yuna, get a little annoying after a while but I understand why she would have the struggles that she does with her sexuality, it just gets a little repetitive. 

I have mixed feelings about the functionality of the 'planner' set up, which isn't something I've seen in other VNs. I like that you can easily rewatch scenes or jump around to specific characters that you're interested in but it is a bit annoying to be pulled back to the planner after each and every scene, kind of makes the overall experience feel kind of disjointed.

[b]Kindred Spirits on the Roof[/b] é uma [i]Visual Novel[/i] de enredo simples, mas que cumpre tudo que propõe e mais um pouco. A narrativa é conduzida de forma agradável, os textos não são pesados e a leitura flui bem. No começo parece uma historinha clichê, mas por meio da convivência da protagonista com personagens tão divergentes, é possível perceber que os temas presentes são tratados de forma madura e crível, dentro dos limites e personalidades de cada personagem envolvido. Não há ""furos"" relevantes e é possível dizer que há uma estabilidade elogiável e longe de ser monótona. Não apenas temos o ponto de vista da protagonista: durante cenas à parte, estamos lendo sob o olhar dos casais de meninas que estão sendo ajudados a encontrar seus sentimentos e verdades da vida. E se chegou aqui procurando cenas de sexo fetichizadas, sinto informar que deverá continuar procurando. O jogo trata a sexualidade de forma romântica e atrativa para quem queira apreciar uma leitura mais poética do ato. Por fim, pontuo positivamente essa abordagem mais lírica dos temas em combinação com a leveza da narrativa presente, tendo em vista a ambientação proposta. 

[h1]AMBIENTAÇÃO: VISUAL, DUBLAGEM E TRILHA SONORA[/h1]

O traço é simples, mas agradável aos olhos. Planos de fundo bem trabalhados nas [i]CGs[/i], sem contrastar com a qualidade das personagens expostas nas cenas. O visual individual de cada uma das meninas do jogo é único e parece ""casar"" bem com as personalidades apresentadas. As expressões emocionais de cada uma são um charme à parte. As vozes em si são agradáveis. Não entendo uma palavra de japonês, mas me parece que as dubladoras tiveram êxito na missão de passar emoção em seus respectivos papéis, levando em conta as cenas e as entonações empregadas. Embora a trilha sonora seja meio repetitiva, não desgosto. Muito pelo contrário: o jogo tem músicas excelentes, vale a pena adquirir a trilha sonora para escutar separadamente caso tenha oportunidade.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]

A história é linear, ou seja, as escolhas tem pouco ou nenhum impacto para o final. É uma experiência menos interativa do que o que se espera para uma [i]Visual Novel[/i] com cerca de 40 horas de duração. Não creio que seja um problema tão grande para o público consumidor de [i]Novels[/i] no geral, tendo em vista que uma leitura agradável é o mínimo que se espera de um jogo do gênero e, nesse ponto, como já comentado sobre o enredo, o jogo não deixa a desejar. Contextualizando um pouco, o jogo se passa respeitando um calendário pré-definido. As cenas serão lidas por ""dia"". Um ponto interessante acerca disso é que se pode escolher a ordem em que as cenas de casal serão lidas assim que se passa pela rota principal daquele mês. No geral, é uma experiência diferente do que estaríamos acostumados, mas longe de ser ruim.

[h1]CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS[/h1]

[b]Kindred Spirits on the Roof[/b] é uma leitura que vale muito a pena. É possível notar o cuidado e capricho com que o jogo foi produzido. O visual é bom e a trilha sonora e a dublagem completam um ambiente delicado e encantador. Pontuo positivamente a abordagem da temática [i]yuri[/i]: é uma história focada nos sentimentos das personagens acima das relações físicas.

总之，随着剧情的结束，从早上甚至可以说从几年前开始困扰我的问题也渐渐有了答案。我们此生大概需要在内心坚定着，坚定地相信着自己喜欢的心情，即使有过迷茫与挫折，甚至还有些许勇气不足。但如果能够好好传达自己的想法，一定会得到回应的吧。故事中的她们都得到了自己所渴望的结局，都拥有了那个可以称之为依靠称之为信念的可爱的恋人。这就是这个世界上最棒的事情了！所以，一直像yuna一样封闭的自己也该拿出些决心与勇气还有恒心去面对那个心中最独一无二最闪闪发光最棒的喜欢的人了啊。看着游戏中的她们的喜悦，和她曾经经历的一切也都在心头萦绕。果然还是最喜欢她了，如果这份心情能传达过去就好了。

所以，这款游戏最棒的地方，大概就是会伴随着她们同喜同忧，却在陪伴的同时寻找到了自己的勇气和对美好、对喜欢的人、对恋人最美好的憧憬和想要将这份心情好好传达出去的心情吧。
真的很高兴认识她们，很荣幸见证她们的故事。",1530509039,1530541667,True,2,2,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's no choices to be made, and it plays out more like an audio book or a voice-acted manga than a game.
That said, while I'm not usually a huge fan of kinetic novels, I absolutely love this one. While there are a few bits of it that I find questionable (such as the ethics of a teacher dating one of her students), the concept is cute and silly, wholesome, and high quality. It's a little bit pricy but it's quite long, and quite worth the money.
If you're snuggling on the couch with your girlfriend (presumably most of the people who bought this game are girls who like girls), it's fun to toss on a scene, watch it, and squeeze each other with glee as you watch the protagonist deny to herself how much she's loving uniting all these adorable lesbian couples. The only drawback is that the voice acting is all in Japanese, so if you don't understand it, you won't be able to follow what's going on while you're smooching, which is too bad because it's so romantic and sweet.
If all kinetic novels made my gay little heart glow with this much delight, along with my aching cheeks from smiling and my throat dry from all the squealing and ""awww!"" moments, I'd probably play them more.

That’s all what I see annoying in that game though. It is very good romance and an classic of yuri subgenre. Well done, showing up all the shapes of love. Each couple had different style, problems also taste for the love. This game was an incredible fun to discover at start with a little dull moments in middle and a real satisfying ending. If you like mild stories you will be at home. It kind of got me into relaxing mood, with a few moments worth waiting for on game calendar.

Voice actors did really good job. I don’t mind that only few special scenes were voiced it was enough for me to like every character of that game, which is pretty rare for me. Ahhh but Koba Youka!!! She is taking first place as an comedy king. I am jealous such a waifu rock’in material (no offense to Yuna with her apron). Megumi and Sachi had best voicing I feel. They really pulled up their sleeves doing ""certain” scenes.

Pros:
[list]
[*] This is a great story about an uber-mature girl, Yuna, helping two ""kindred spirits"" (girl ghosts in love with each other) to play yuri cupid at their school.  This story has a few minor choices included which do not affect the final outcome at all, but the overall story is told both from multiple points of view (various characters) and also non-linearly, jumping around from date to date as new content is progressively unlocked.  The game uses a calendar system so it's not confusing at all where you're at in the story.
[*] All the characters are unique and well-developed.
[*] Lots of content, easily 50+ hours.
[*] Good soundtrack that somehow doesn't get tiring to listen to even after 50+ hours.
[*] Lots of [i]Awwww![/i] moments.
[*] Oh and some adult moments too, though the game is PG-rated until [spoiler]the in-game month of August[/spoiler].
[*] Lots of Japanese culture references.  By the end of this story you should know your -san from your -chan and your senpai from your sensei.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Measly 800x600 resolution.  What year is this, 1995?  The artwork was still well-done though.
[*] Seriously, does everyone in Japan have a stuttering problem?  You'd think so from this VN.  Everyone seems to be easily surprised, unnerved, caught off-guard, or startled too.
[*] Ok not really a con per se, but I really didn't like Miyu & Matsuri [spoiler]for their clearly inappropriate treatment of Hina[/spoiler].  I guess not all the characters can be likable.
[*] Parts of this VN (maybe a quarter?) are voice-acted, but the majority of it is not.  While the parts selected to be voice-acted seemed like the parts that [i]should[/i] be if you're not going to do the whole thing, it would've been better if they had either done the whole thing, or nothing.  (Rumor has it there will be complete voice-acting in the future, so this point may go away.)

每一对角色都是不一样的感觉。
不过像部分差评（中英都有）所说的，剧情基本上都是日常片段。
所以对日常不感冒的玩家会觉得无聊。

Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a yuri visual novel. It is the best visual novel that I’ve ever read. If you’re into yuri or just looking for a good romantic visual novel, I highly recommend this game.

Full Review 
(Note: Spoilers and some of these points are my opinions)

Story- The story revolves around the game’s protagonist finding out about and meeting two female ghosts or kindred spirits in a relationship on the roof of Kokonotsuboshi Girls' Academy, an all girls school. The Kindred Spirits, seeing that they have finally been heard and acknowledged, ask the protagonist to help them become one in body because they don’t know how to do “it.” But, neither does the main protagonist know how to do it. So, to learn how to do it, the three of them attempt to get girls who have hidden feelings for other girls in their school together to make a “yuritopia” and observe them do it. This is the main gist of the story and this makes for a really interesting and creative plot in my opinion. I also love the pacing of the story, although a bit slow and repetitive at times. The story is really memorable and heartwarming, and I doubt that I will forget this story.

Characters- In my opinion, each of the characters are unique and it was really fun and enjoyable to see the changes in their person and in their relationship with other people.

Gameplay/Controls- It’s a visual novel so it’s just your standard press a button to advance the story. However, I really appreciate the ease of the controls and the variety of controls as well. It’s really easy to use the scroll wheel (down to progress, and up to replay text) and there are so many customizable options for a visual novel. You have an option to the change how transparent the text box is, remove the text box, skip to a certain point, replay voice acting for a certain line, and more. I also appreciate the use of a planner or calendar to advance to the next part of the story. Because of this planner, it is easy to review artworks or cg that you have already seen for a particular month. It also allows you to replay to certain points in the story with ease. You can also access the music and play different tracks in the planner.

Graphics and Art Style- The game has an unchangeable standard 800x600 resolution but personally, this issue doesn’t really bother me. The game still has beautiful art direction and the art is what attracted me to buy this game in the first place.

Music- There are a only a few songs that are played in the game but I don’t really mind that since the music in the game is very catchy and most of them are upbeat. I’d find myself playing the songs in my head or even saying or singing them. There are also other songs that fit the mood of the scenes in the game very well. Like I said earlier, you have the options to all of the the music played in the game in the planner.

Voice Acting- This game has good voice actors. Each of them suit their characters really well and I didn’t dislike any voice for each of the characters. Not all parts of the game are voice acted but I think there's no problem there.",1521859695,1521870333,True,4,0,0.52417302131652832,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There are a lot of pitfalls along the way, and after each section of the main storyline, the stories of the couples also get some attention. Finally, after the end of the main storyline (which includes the protagonist discovering her own love), there are a bunch of extra stories involving one of the characters (or more) that are unlocked based on the few choices you have made in the storyline (and perhaps it is best to go back and make sure you cover ALL the choices).

The couples are cute, and quite normal (no outrageous drama) and I think that's why I loved it. A lot of yuri themed media from Japan is full of discomfort and boundary crossing and crazy dramatic plotlines that just make me mad. I was craving some regular fluff.

All of the couples are unique and cute together in their own way, with a total of sixteen characters divided into seven couples and two supporting characters.

However, you should NOT use that as a reason to buy and play this game.

没有胃药，全是甜甜的糖，充满温暖的气氛，大家都有好的结局，都互相了解并且互相适合，是非常理想化的女高中生恋爱故事了。像二位百合灵被困在校园这块地方一样，也让身心被困在这个狭小却充实的的幻想里吧。[spoiler] 小月代那里说出那句“不能觉得自己很奇怪哦，慢慢地成长为大人然后慢慢地察觉到吧”的时候我看着屏幕哭了出来，我也说不清楚是为什么。虽然我看到这句话很感动，不过按照剧情来说这句话只是一句官话而已，最后两个人都认为这份感情不是错觉，那就不是错觉了。但是我觉得错觉才是现实。在困惑之中成长，等想明白怎么回事事情早就已经过去了，然后新的事情就会带来新的疑惑，这样的话永远都是一个不行的人吧。但是剧情里的大家都很快地抛弃杂念向喜欢的人传达了想法，只能觉得真不错啊真不错啊。[/spoiler]

遗憾的是配音不全，只有一些重要的情节里有配音，并且文本只有英文的；并且看别的盆友测评说阿野线是被删的，这显得比较诚意不足。（我也想要阿野线！还想要音七线啊啊啊啊啊！！！）bgm也有些单一。值得赞赏的是日历模式，读完每个月的主线以后可以随意点开这个月任意的情侣故事，读完情侣故事以后再进行下个月的主线，这让玩家可以有个清楚一点的条理。游戏内也有选项提供，不过都很次要，看来对剧情没有影响，只是增加一点点参与感吧。
感谢百合会的汉化，在蒸汽动力上找到了帖子下载的。不过打了汉化之后就不是从steam这里打开了，所以我显示的游戏时间是我另外挂的……
其实因为百合游戏相对来说很少，能找到看到有人推荐的看起来还行的就直接买来玩了。其实我买之前没有仔细了解，也不清楚原来这是什么开车里程碑啥的，所以出现h情节的时候我有一种仿佛吃完火锅又被人塞了很多甜点的感觉，就感觉还不错。不管是感情的描写还是h的描写都挺到位的（虽然娇喘配音还要按照字幕分开来放觉得迷之尬啊！），确实是女学生会产生的想法，并且还有一些让我觉得“啊原来是这样，也会这样想啊”的惊喜。[spoiler] 我也想知道女孩子之间是怎么h的[/spoiler]甚至还学到了什么[spoiler]原来不把手指伸进去也是可以的[/spoiler]，原来是这样，非常感谢了[strike] 但是有个屁用啊[/strike]

剧情中有很多对的情侣的故事，并且不错地塑造出了各自的萌点。主线通关以后还有许多额外的小故事，增加了非cp角色之间的互动和补充主线，在人物塑造上还是下了一点功夫的。角色的会产生情感的来由都能简洁有力地交代清楚。大家都能得到好的结局的原因大概是她们都有着一种，坦率地面对感情并且能够从容地表达出来的素质，令人赞叹。[spoiler]一名现实死宅的赞赏[/spoiler]想具体讲述对各个cp的感受未免会有大量剧透，并且对只是想看看这游戏好不好玩要不要买的盆友没有太大意义[spoiler] 实际上是懒得写吧！[/spoiler]如果是玩过的盆友欢迎扩个列和我叨一叨啊w 总之对喜欢百合故事的盆友来说还算是一个不容错过的游戏。

Soundtrack is competent, but its easily the least remarkable thing here. It works as a background for all the romantic mayhem constantly going on here.

Character cast is large, but for once almost everyone gets a decent slice of the story instead of being reduced to comedic window dressing the whole time.

Novel is also voiced very competently and you should have fun listening to the main characters going off with all sorts of puns and ""yuri conspiracy plots"" as they try to lead as many potential lovers together as they can. There's also 4 after story stories in voiced form available in Steam should you like to know how the characters fare after their school year.

Don't worry about the price tag either because there is a ton of content to this game. It took me 32 hours to finish (SPOILER:)  [spoiler]completely and get the ""Full Clear"" message, and even if you don't go for 100% completion the main story is still the large majority of those hours[/spoiler].

While I could leverage some criticism at the game, its flaws are few and easily excused and it's easy to see the game had a high level of effort, talent, and enthusiasm put into it. These folks really cared about what they were making and it shows. The writing is excellent, the voicework is top notch, the music is catchy, background and character art and UI design are all well done, and really the whole experience is a cut above most of this game's contemporaries.

Kindred Spirits has quickly become my favorite yuri visual novel game, and is really a contender for the most well put together visual novel that I have ever played to be honest. It's right up there with the best of them.

I think the most important thing that this game does ""right"" that so many others fail to understand the importance of is (SPOILER:)  [spoiler]everyone gets a happy ending. This is so important and so needed because, while more and more VNs these days feature same sex romantic couples, which is fantastic to see, it's still very uncommon for a game to have some/all lesbian content and have it all end up with happy endings. So commonly do you see ones with really messed up scenes or just depressing results to their romances and it makes it hard to even enjoy playing games like that. Not so with Kindred Spirits, and that's so very important. We need more games like this one that leave you feeling good. We need more movies and TV shows with happy endings for same sex couples too for that matter[/spoiler].

There was one part in the game that actually did bother me personally. It was maybe 6 or 8 hours in to the game so not very far, and the way that the events played out seemed to run contrary to the tone and precedent of the game up until that point. Words were said by one of the characters to another that I felt were not healthy or ""okay"" at all, and actually rather cruel. Specifically I am speaking of (SPOILER:) [spoiler]the start of Kiri and Tsukuyo-sensei's relationship when Kiri confesses and Tsukuyo-sensei dismissed Kiri's feelings, telling her they were just a ""misunderstanding"" and a phase that younger girls often go through[/spoiler]. Thankfully though, as the game progressed, this issue that I had with it was actually addressed as part of the story, much to my pleasant surprise, and handled well enough overall that I felt okay about it after that turning point. I was impressed that the staff and writers went so far as to examine a scenario like that, and just knowing that they took that on only added to my respect for the game that Kindred Spirits became.

Another thing worth noting is that this game does feature some adult content scenes without even requiring a separate uncensor patch file to be downloaded. I think that's good progress on Valve's part for finally allowing this kind of content on Steam directly without having to have workarounds like we've seen up till now.

If you're concerned about the adult content, I was really surprised and pleased to see it was very tastefully handled and innocent. A lot of 18+ content games don't really know how to show loving relationships or innocence very well, and I believe it takes a skilled writer to be able to pull off tenderness in a lovemaking scene. Kindred Spirits succeeds wonderfully at this. If you were worried about the content being too graphic or vulgar, you've got nothing to fear here. The relationships take time to build before the intimacy happens, (SPOILER:) [spoiler]and the game's story takes place over the course of 8 months[/spoiler], so if you're going into this game expecting things to move quickly you'll be disappointed. I don't mean that in a bad way though. The character development and pacing is great, and by the time the scenes of intimacy come about, you really feel like you know the characters and the intricacies of their relationships well.

I know that no matter how good it is, Kindred Spirits on the Roof will be considered a ""niche"" title, because for some reason a lot of us humans are still not comfortable with the idea of women loving women even when represented as an artform, and on top of that, many people aren't even comfortable enough with their own bodies or sexuality to be okay with seeing sexual content in the games that they play.

If you ask me, it's unfortunate really that as a culture we're more okay with depictions of shocking violence, pain, and distress, than we are with sexuality and feeling good, but I digress. Chances are good most folks who fall into these categories aren't sitting here reading this review in the first place.

If you are the kind of person who is open minded enough to not let the fact that this game contains some scenes of an intimate and loving sexual nature between two women bother you, and you enjoy visual novel games, Kindred Spirits on the Roof is one VN you will really be able to appreciate, and its heartwarming story and characters will stay with you for a good while, and leave you feeling glad that you took the chance on it.",1511584459,1511584459,True,5,0,0.601449251174926758,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[i] This is my favorite visual novel. [/i]

But to make this brief, I'll give you my pros and cons:

Pros:

[*] Art. Oh my god the art is beautiful. Cute and sweet and fits this story so well.

[*] Many different stories. If there is a couple you are 100% for, I can guarentee that another one will be just your cup of tea.

[*] Great writing. The stories are sweet and so full of love. Nothing feels that forced, and all of the relationships are very genuine.

[*] Sound design. The SFX and music fit the mood and are so pleasing. The music doesn't get annoying.

[*] Voice acting. The whole thing isn't voiced, just certain scenes. That way the scenes voice acted are so much more poignant that way.

[*] A REAL STORY. The attention to detail in this VN is just so amazing.

Cons:

[*] Not many choices. If you like choice heavy games, this might not be for you. The choices you do make unlock extra scenes from the girl's POV's later.

[*] Cultural differences. Some Western cultures have different customs and beliefs which could result in a bit of confusion. Ex. There is a romance between a student and a teacher. The female age of consent in Japan is 16, so both of them are within the age of consent. It makes 100% sense if that makes you uncomfortable, but you need to understand that before playing.

Es un juego yuri con varias parejas. La protagonista le es encomendada la misión por dos fantasmas, de ayudar a algunas chicas para que puedan emparejarse. 

Lo que me encanto de este juego es como se daban las relaciones, al principio comienza lento y se muestra un poco sobre la vida de las chicas y sus personalidades. Las relaciones se dan de manera natural, y poco a poco ves como avanzan, lo que hace disfrutar aun mas cuando suceden eventos importantes al punto de no querer despegarte del juego.  Te encariñas bastante con los personajes y también vez como se forman lasos de amistad entre ellas y como se apoyan entre amigas.  

Otro punto a favor es la forma en la que esta organizado el juego, es un calendario donde eliges el dia para jugar, con eso tienes presente de mejor manera las fechas y sabes cuando parar o continuar el juego, lo cual me parece bastante importante en una VN ya que puedes perder el hilo de la historia.  Calve recalcar que las elecciones libres  de los días, son las de las chicas a las que ayudas. 

Puntos en contra diria que le falta mas sountracks, las pocas canciones que tienen me gustan su opening y ending y la cancion sorpresa de la rockera son geniales. Pero aparte de esas son solo 12 sountracks que suenan mientras lees, nunca me molesto esto ya que disfrutaba de la historia y las canciones eran adecuadas pero si me hubiera gustado que hubiera tenido mas. 

Una vez de pasas el juego, te premian dando escenas extras de las personjes a través de todo el año y una vez terminas eso, sabes que aun hay mas con lo de los CD dramas, que claramente tendré que comprar. 

El juego me divirtió y me entretuvo bastante, también me hizo pensar cuando ocurrían problemas a través de la historia, por ejemplo la forma eficiente de hacer las cosas yuna y como ayudaba a los demás sin esperar nada a cambio o como los buenos consejos pueden solucionar muchos problemas. 

Calificación 10/10 completamente recomendada.  Es el mejor juego yuri que he jugado!!!

Kindred Spirit on the Roof is a Yuri VN Game that tells a story about achieving a romance relationship between girls from various perspective. It started when the protagonist, Yuna, discover the ""kindred spirits"" on the roof despite her lack of spiritual sense and then help them creating a yuritopia in her school by act as a yuri cupid for the other couples. This game also the first uncensored game on steam.

Pros :
+ Really good story
+ Heartwarming and cute
+ 7 couples to ships
+ Great character development and relationship
+ Great soundtrack and art
+ Some major events are fully voiced
+ Uncensored Beewbs (I swear I didn't play for this one)

Cons :
- Not really compatible with steam (No steam overlay, no achievement, can't screenshot, etc.)
- After 10-15 minutes of playing, the text become kinda lag, it doesn't disturb the game itself though, and after sometime It didn't bother me anymore (This issue can be solved by launching the exe directly from the game folder, but I want to save the playing hours)
- Fixed 800x600 resolution, but despite that, it didn't look weird when strectched to 16:9 resolution

Overall it's a really good game and I really enjoyed every second of it. Really recommended for yuri lover out there. I already cleared 100% of the game and now I'm starting to miss playing this game...

This allows players to get into the character's head as she tries to understand the intricacies and nuances of lesbian romance.

While the VN definitely delivers on feel-good high school yuri, it also reveals the difficulties it poses, especially in a conservative, collectivist society where presenting oneself as normal is paramount. It doesn't do so heavy-handedly, however, allowing the more intimate nature of the different stories to shine throug.

All in all, the different romances are quite engaging, and though some initially left me underwhelmed, I was rooting for all of them by the time the game drew to a close. With the vulnerabilities of first love compounded by what is frowned-upon, if not quite forbidden love, the story comes with emotional weight that can be surprising given its lighthearted mood.

Meu problema maior com Kindred Spirits é a falta de sinalização de que esta é uma kinect novel, tanto na sinopse quanto nos trailers, o que pode levar a alguém falsamente acreditar que trata-se de uma visual novel com um pouco mais de sensação de agência.

The art is nice and consistent throughout, the music is pleasant and I actually really like some of the songs, the story is nonsense at times but such is the nature of fiction so I think that the story actually culminates very well, and I really like some of the characters and the development of these characters throughout the story. It's a cute, yuri romance that I honestly feel could make a great anime. It has drama CDs and a spin-off manga, so why not?

Full disclosure; I am a fan of anime and I am a guy. A guilty pleasure of mine is Nekopara and I have Steins Gate for the Vita. I am a fan of visual novels because I watch a lot of anime that derives from them and I enjoy video games with a healthy amount of good narrative or visual novel-esque mechanics.

I heard about this game because I saw an article online about it being an ""uncensored"" visual novel on Steam. So I looked up some promotional images for the game and liked the art style. I'm no expert on visual novels, but I've seen images from visual novels where the art isn't consistent. This game has a very consistent manga-like art style that looks good against the game's backgrounds as well.

I went into the game thinking this would be another guilty pleasure like Nekopara but found that I was actually enjoying it for multiple reasons without the need of ""ecchi"" distractions. Right from the beginning the game grabs me with its openning song. I'm a sucker for some anime songs and there are a few songs with vocals in this game that I really enjoy. The lyrics are nice too and the vocalized songs are sung by one of the character's voice actors, which I think is nice. It's all a bit romantic in a shoujo-esque way, though I guess the game is yuri.

A major reason I was enjoying the game before the ecchi parts, and all-around regardless of anything ecchi; I really like the main protagonist. The protag's name is Toomi Yuna. She has a bit of a tomboy-ish, kuudere-ish vibe in that she is very self dependent and solemn with a ""cool"" or ""cold"" look to her character, which is why I found it adorable when she gets caught off guard occasionally and gets spooked or embarrassed, which shows that she is a complex character capable of feeling/showing natural emotions other than those typical of her apparant character. A fault that I hear about in many visual novels, or anime inspired by visual novels, or just anime in general is that the protagonist is unrelateable because they're a blank slate for you to imagine yourself in their shoes, or that the protag is just a terrible one-dimensional character whose involvement in the story boils down to plot for ""PLOT""; as in they have all sorts of plot armor, plot hole inducing nonsense to make them important, and for some reason everyone then likes them or rivals them for some reason or another, so they are justified in all the ""ecchi"" stuff they get coming their way. But no. Kindred Spirits is way different from that nonsense. Toomi Yuna is a good protagonist. She has her own character which is developed and interesting and is part of a story within the game which is sort of seperate yet ties into her involvement with the other characters. What I mean by separate is that she isn't the focus of the game's ecchi story lines. Her own development stems more from her overcoming her own personal problems to become a stronger character that others rely on. Basically in a bad harem anime the protag gets unexplained plot power so that everyone is drawn to them. But in Yuna's case she isn't a harem protagonist, she's just trying to help other girls fall in love. This is difficult for Yuna because of her personal problems making her a bit of an introvert. But at her core she is a good person so she wants to help people when she knows she can. So she gets out of her comfort zone to help people. This makes her analyze herself and others and she comes to terms with why she was introverted in the first place so that she overcomes her problems. Basically she becomes a better character worthy of being relied on, capable of helping others, and therefore a justified protagonist.

So the focus of the plot is that Yuna helps girls who are lesbian find love. These girls have their own personalities told through their own narrative which explains how they feel about things, mainly their love interests. All the couples have their own quirks to them and whether or not you like the couples probably depends on the type of characters you like to see in a romance. People love shipping but tend to hate couples that don't meet their personal preferences. So obviously there were couples that I liked more than others for various reasons; some were cuter, some were more fun, some made more sense. But I liked the way the characters' narratives explained who they were and how they felt as characters. Regardless of what makes sense in the real world, I feel like all the couples are justified, more or less, by the characters' backstories, inner feelings, and interactions.

So this is an adult game in that it depicts relationships in a sexual way and shows implicit sex scenes that are more explained through narrative and vocals than the art itself. They do show boobs, but by todays anime standards it's fairly innocent. Even though it shows sex, it's not oversexualized. Some, if not most, anime today tends to be oversexualized even when it's not adult. Anime also tends to portray risque relationships. This game only really has one risque relationship. The entire game is ""safe"" in a vanilla sense. That's probably one of the reasons it wasn't censored by Steam. But I enjoy the art in general. I also just enjoy the development of the characters in the story. The sex scenes were ""nice"" but they were more like icing on the cake of the couples, sort of like a justification to the ""ships"" or a culmination of the romances naturally leading to intamacy.

So obviously I didn't explain the story too well as to avoid major spoilers. I just want to add that the voice acting helps define the characters along with the art and the narrative. Not everything is voiced, but you can sort of imagine how a character might say something in their voice as you're reading. The game also presents you with ""choices"" but they're very superficial and don't affect more than a sentence in the next line of dialogue. There is only one route that you simply read through, but visual novels offer more than manga and books because they have art, music, vocals, etc. The ghosts or ""kindred spirits"" are sort of a reason for the plot and a source for everything nonsensical that keeps reminding you this game is leading towards an ecchi finish line, but I still think that the writing in the lesbian relationships is done fairly well and keeps the relationships realistic or even relateable in most cases. I'm a guy, but I like romance too, so I don't even consider this a guilty pleasure; it's just a good romance story to me. So in all honesty you probably wont like all the characters but I'd say you should play it for the ones you will. Again, regardless of all the yuri romances that the other characters present you with, my favorite character is the protagonist Toomi Yuna. I'd play a non-ecchi game starring her, or watch a spin-off anime about her cooking (because she  likes to cook). If you're not sure whether you'll like the characters, just go to the game's official website, it has the rough bios on the characters. But if you're an anime fan who likes a bit of ecchi, likes a bit of romance, and likes ""ships"", this is the game for you.",1507358960,1507359243,True,36,1,0.771927177906036377,2,True,False,False,False,,,

It's not surprising that Valve accepted the game in its current form, despite it being rated '18+' by the publishers.

one would expect an anime visual novel about lesbian ghosts shipping girls at a highschool wouldnt be as serious but a lot of it was how different relationships can be depending on the person, and the kinds of thoughts/feelings that are going through a persons head when it is happening. however, the twist being that there is a gentle push and assistance from two (nearly) omnipresent ghosts, so nearly anything could happen.
I got so attatched to all of the couples in this game and cheered them on the whole way through, and their individual stories nearly outshined the main character's.
The voice acting is excellent, the art is top notch, and the music, while it loops, never seems to get old and fits every situation it is put in pretty well.
I laughed at the shenanigans, I cried at the touching and sad moments of the game, and I almost completely forgot about the fact that this is an 18+ romance novel.
although the game is 18+, its not really focused on the sex. all of the sex scenes are so adorable and touching that you forget it technically qualifies as hentai, and just enjoy the fact that two girls have fallen in love and are showing their affection to eachother.
my point above is one of the many reasons why I say its very ""real"". the stress leading up to the confession, the worries about who is going to find out/maybe get mad, dealing with relationship issues/roadblocks, and most importantly, the trust and bond between two people is all covered in the game and written in extremely well.

[h1]TECHNICAL[/h1]
On a surface level, this visual novel is surprisingly well-constructed. The artwork is crisp and well-drawn (artist is peg and you can find more of their work [url=https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=5020]here![/url]), the score is pleasing to the ears and never feels worn out or tiring, and the sound direction is very solid. The dialogue text display is easy on the eyes by default (you can change the opacity of the dialogue text box). I would've chosen a slightly better font, but that's minor and entirely preferential. The voice actors chosen for this game (side note: not all the dialogue is voiced) are very skilled as is apparent by their work here. Not a single character felt like the VA behind them was mismatched, and a few of them absolutely shone out above the rest. The localization of the actual dialogue is also an extreme selling point. The folks at MangaGamer show genuine care for the product they are localizing for stateside release and it shows in the (verified!) high translation quality and stellar editing of the dialogue which helped give the visual novel life.

[h1]WRITING[/h1]
Once you get past the fact that the game revolves around a pair of lesbian ghosts, the visual novel is...surprisingly grounded in reality. The characters, for the most part, are realistic without being uninteresting (a few of the characters, specifically Koba Youka, I've grown to be very fond of and am astonished at how especially good their characterization was), and the interpersonal relationships are plausible without being lackluster. I haven't read the original Japanese text, so I can't verify if it was originally written as such or if it was the (high-grade) localization that makes it seem this way, but engaging with the dialogue in this visual novel was very rewarding throughout. This all being said, there was one relationship in particular that drew some mixed reception; the teacher-student relationship. In all honesty, it was somewhat awkward and felt a bit rushed, but it was nowhere close to a dealbreaker for me.

[h1]OVERALL[/h1]
I don't read many visual novels, but I do engage with plenty of yuri media. And Kindred Spirits on the Roof is one of the finest entries in both of those categories. Do I consider it worth the $34.99? Honestly, I don't know. It does seem to be a bit on the pricier side (especially since STEINS;GATE is the same price and that's longer and more comprehensive), so on the occasional chance that this visual novel goes on sale, please do get it.

I love how closely-acquainted the reader gets to feel with all of the girls through the eyes of Yuna, and I also love how more context and background is provided for characters (in the extras) in relationships that may have felt sudden or contrived in the main story.

There were only two things that really annoyed me:
1) The game slows down drastically every couple of minutes of gameplay--which I'm sure most reviews have already complained about. The solution for me was to save immediately and close the game before it froze completely.
2) Some of the voices for the girls were way too squeaky for my taste. This may not be as much of an issue for someone else, but I'll just put that out there. I got by by clicking and reading quickly, though I suppose it would have been easier to just mute.

Another thing, there IS a relationship that occurs between a student and a teacher if that sort of thing really squicks anyone out. However, the teacher is very considerate and never holds her status as an adult over the student to make her do sexual things.

我第一次玩是一三年的中旬。好像是六月?当时是在网上看到百合灵的立绘和背景图，一下子就被吸引了，呢时候的我还不适应当时流行的galgame画风，一下子就被这个游戏吸引了。百合灵是我第一部感兴趣，也是主动去玩的一部文字avg。
老实说第一次玩到这种类型的游戏的时候我挺新奇的，也没在意这个游戏的内容是百合。一开始登场的主角结奈和百合灵们发生的事情都是中规中矩，但到了要帮助圣苗的片段时，我一下子就泪目了。当我看到圣苗在美纪前辈的教室门口徘徊数周，只是为了给前辈递上自己的饱含真情的信时，我一下子就泪目了，当时我想，居然真的会有这样的事情，为圣苗那样的情感和坚持打动了。这之后结奈在百合灵的劝诱下伸出了援手，没有结奈，可能圣苗会永远错失向前辈表达谢意的机会吧。当时只有第一天汉化版，只有第一天的游戏内容被汉化了，而我也只能默默的等着完全汉化版，我想过要用机翻来推，但我还是想等到完全汉化再推，感觉这样能更好的体会到剧情。
呢时候我天天来贴吧暗中观察，等着那张汉化进度表，等待着汉化的发布。好像是十月的月底，我在贴吧置顶看到了汉化的发布。呢是我没想过的事情，我一度以为我可能玩不到的汉化，终于出炉了。玩过百合灵后，我虽然玩了君与彼女之恋，也玩了水仙和石头门，但我依旧惦记着百合灵的汉化，惦记着故事的后续，感谢汉化组的各位，没有你们，我也不会有机会能接触这款心目中无可替代的神作
圣苗与美纪是最早登场的cp。我一开始被打动的地方正是圣苗的真挚情感。这对的撮合非常特别，她们情感发展非常有地下党的味道。在远见结奈夫斯基的帮助下开拓据点，进行着只属于她们的地下行动。那间狭窄的杂物间，正是他们远离繁琐现实的避难所。学姐和学妹的性格差让她们的情感路途时有波折，这些波折如果没有结奈，可能一辈子也无法铺成平路。但在百合灵们的策划和结奈的协助下，这一切却又变成了感情的催化剂，使她们不再是朋友，而是心有灵犀的恋人(圣苗:谁敢说美纪前辈的坏话!就砸谁狗头汪!)。其实，我钟情于百合灵这个游戏的地方，不是立绘CG，更多的是游戏里对她们友情的塑造。
一二三三人组可以说是最让我有共鸣感的一组之一。我和羽美一样，小时候没有什么朋友，当我看到羽美的回忆杀的时候，我总会联系到自己可能和她无独有偶的经历。也因此我和羽美一样，格外珍惜着沙莎和音七这样的朋友们。羽美与沙莎在友情与爱情之间的纠结让我为她们着急的不得了，好在是音七在屋顶上推了她们一把，真是长吁一口气了。(要不是有音七你们可是要磨叽到毕业啊！)她们三人都有各自的闪光点，也有各自的缺点，但正是这些优缺点使她们聚在了一起，三个臭皮匠，顶个诸葛亮，说的就是她们三，仔细看看你的身边，是不是也有这样的人？阳香（Rita)唱的没错，ひとりが辛いからふたつの手をつないだ，ふたりじゃ寂しいから輪（わ）になって手をつないだ。一个人是艰辛的 于是两人牵起手，两个人是寂寞的 于是大家围成圈。（说到三个人，我为什么回想起春希，藤井冬弥，还有超时空要塞呢...还有星河战队1）
喜欢可爱的东西可不是桐的专利。教授古文的小月代可真的是相当惹人怜爱的呀(题外话，不知道有没有人想起2010年的秋之回忆7里的星月织姬?)，小月代浑身都是萌属性，外加还有贫血的毛病，让我有时回想起我那同样有着贫血的可爱朋友!在厕所里抱着头用理科脑烦恼的桐和为桐担心的月代，本可能永远无法走在一起，师生恋这样的禁忌，在结奈的暗中协助下已经不是事了，远见结奈夫斯基和她的情报小组成员榎木纱织，永谷惠及时发现了她们的烦恼!结奈夫斯基不畏艰险，在校园内围追堵截，惠为结奈提供UAV支援，侦查敌方动向，精确定位！在好同志(老练的兄弟会刺客)狛野比奈的协助（乱入）下，总算是将不老实的信使桐捉到了老师面前!在主角的撮合下，桐得到了和老师独处的机会，别小看结奈的功劳，正是因为结奈一行人，桐与月代才能明白对方的心意，才能有后续的闪光☆作战计划！教师与学生，本不应该结合的身份，却挡不住双方内心的对彼此的追求，某种程度来说，这一对在旁人看来可是相当的背德……但其实不，一点都不。还记得桐的话吗，即使小月代变成了老婆婆，她也依然会喜欢她。在此再次为真诚的为她们的真心献上祝福!
我想想……哦，体育组的二位。在op里就已经开始执子之手与子偕老的二位，在游戏时间线之前就已是情侣了的二位也非常富有真实感。真实剧情体验和贴近日常的剧本是我认为这个游戏有别于花吻这样的游戏的突出卖点。接吻魔茉莉和理性派的美夕可能是游戏里最有现实意义的一对，因此他们也可能是真正认真考虑过她们未来的一组cp吧。她们决定一同走向人生终点，但正因如此，才会有一同争抢比奈的闪光弹情节，才有双方从产生不信任的裂痕，到之后的相互理解与重归于好。就像一对老夫老妻一样，两个有点合不来老伴为了点小事儿拌拌嘴，看起来满城风雨可最后却总能奇迹般重归于好，如果只将之归咎到结奈的帮助的话，我认为是不够的，最重要的还是她们两人的日积月累的情感。稍微代入下的话，大家应该都不难理解二人的心境了吧(题外话：白色相簿看多了，茉莉的接吻魔属性就总会让我觉得“美夕:你为什么会这么熟练啊!”)
说到鬼门番爱来和摇滚妹阳香(注意哦，阳香的声优是Rita哦！不止是声优还是个真正的歌手也!唱过lb的op和ed哦!Liar社的好朋友！这次居然会配这样的游戏，吃惊!)本来是我觉得这部游戏里最脱线最不和实际的一组。你想，我一个喜欢摇滚的无产阶级（搞事）群众，怎么就喜欢上了这么一个遵纪守法基层干部呢?一个是迷迷糊糊的天然呆，另一个是性格古怪的鬼门番，我怎么想都不知道该怎么让这对在一起呐……然而事实却是，她们成了!在我印象里这对其实不如其他几组印象深刻，只知道爱来是个货真价实的女王，而阳香是个货真价实的摇滚呆!(还有呢个学园祭上演唱的届之……White……AA爱)。前段时间吧，在床上躺着发呆的时候忽然想起了这组cp，感觉很奇妙，想起自己和朋友们也不过是因为一些奇怪的契机而相识的时候，忽然就想起了阳香。可能这就是友情吧。阳香与爱来本来是毫无交集的两人，却阴差阳错的对上了眼，我和呢些朋友们……好像也差不多是这样的经历唉，可能我之前感觉奇怪的不是阳香，是我自己也说不定?简而言之，这组CP也有她们的有趣之处，之前误解了他们，真是对不起！
结奈和比奈作为官配其实挺好的，和阿野比起来，结奈比奈的组合一是有着幼驯染的先天情感在，又好像我们在某伏见老贼笔下见到的兄妹一样，结奈比奈的感情就是那种迷迷的感觉呀!(没有血缘关系的妹妹呀!)为什么大家会不喜欢比奈而喜欢站结野呢!要不是官方没钱做阿野的剧情!这个游戏就会是这样。“比奈:是我，是我先，明明都是我先来的……”“阿野:为什么会这样子呢 第一次有了喜欢的人，有了能做一辈子朋友的人……”，够了，结奈立绘里一只手插着腰的原因你们明白了吗!是胃疼啊!是站着说话胃会痛啊!结奈已经累了，已经不想再变成邪教了，你们关心过结奈吗！你们只关心过你们自己！
结奈的过去是使结奈变成现在这幅冷漠，不亲近的真正原因，曾经的结奈也曾开朗过，但现实中的打击却让结奈产生了心魔，游戏开篇孤独的站在屋顶上，倚着栏杆看着远处淡蓝色的山，在教室里只有阿野一个是真正的老相好。直到结奈在屋顶上遇到那对百合灵，结奈的一成不变的日常才得到了改变。结奈一开始是在惠的威逼利诱（和纱织近乎专业的传销）下帮助了一对又一对陷入窘境的少女们，帮助他们打开了自己的心结，完成他们的恋情。从一开始的极不情愿，到带点小傲娇的为了大家出谋划策(充当幕后黑手)，这之间自然的发生着心灵的转变不仅仅是结奈，玩家们也跟着结奈慢慢的发生改变。当结奈自己为情所困的时候，她帮助过的cp们一个个在她面前出现，结奈封冻的心，在一次次的帮助过程中解冻了。可能结奈也想不到，百合灵不仅掰弯了她，还掰断了过去的束缚。看起来是结奈推进了游戏的发展，其实百合灵们也很重要啊，在背后让结奈成了后宫王(结all)的潜力种子的，正是这两小心机呀!
关于阿野藤和音七这样的特殊人物，我想说，你们玩怪猎的时候加我一个好吗？关于这两人其实我有想写的东西，但是打了删删了打，感觉还是留到以后茅塞顿开了再写吧。
最喜欢的要放到最后说。百合灵组是我最喜欢的一组cp。她们的故事是最动人的，最浪漫的。为了心里默默憧憬的她，纱织用自己的死换回了那个她的生。几十年来为自己的思念所困，她化作了地缚灵，徘徊在校内，孤身一人，茕茕孑立。惠本是体弱多病的孩子，只因人群当中看见了那孤独的纱织，而不断的在校内寻找着她。她怎么会想到，呢不过是个为情而死的幽灵呢，惠不知道，也从未变过她的心，从她第一眼看见纱织以来，就一直拖着自己孱弱的身子，不断的追寻着纱织的身影。讽刺的是，惠在生命的最后一刻，仍一无所获，倒在冰冷的雨中，而化作地缚灵的她，却惊讶是发现自己苦苦寻找的人，就在她身旁。只有惠能看见纱织，只有纱织能和惠交谈。惠和纱织都因为无法实现自己的心愿而被束缚在这小小的校园里。表面两情相悦的纱织和惠，却互相隐藏着各自的不安，纱织一直模仿着她喜欢的人，惠一直担心纱织的爱不是真心。三十年来互相厮守，目送着呢些无法达成心愿的女孩子们带着遗憾离开学院。本应不变的春夏秋冬，却因结奈的出现而带来了转机。结奈给了她们实现心愿的机会，帮助了百合灵实现少女们的愿望，无私的借出了她和比奈的身体给百合灵。百合灵们升天时，我心里有一种说不出的感觉。没有太难受，也没有太忧郁。他们的升天是注定的，既然游戏一开始就给了这样的铺垫，我也只能接受这样的展开了。我一开始对他们没有什么感觉，但随着游戏的推进，我对百合灵组的二位越来越喜欢，尤其是纱织，我虽然是个博爱的人，什么样的角色都喜欢，但只有纱织我不能退让。最喜欢的角色。没有之一。她的好要多少我都能说多少，惠也是，这两位是货真价实的天造地设！这么一对即古典又现代，浪漫而超现实的CP，你说我该上哪找去！(再说个题外话吧！相信大家应该都知道圣母在上吧。来，跟我一起念!纱织(Sachi)!再来念!祥子(Sachiko)!)
之前在翻百合灵的SBEAM聊天版块的时候看到很多有趣的东西，比如百合灵的动画化请愿，还有拿MSG5和百合灵对比的（MSG5剧情没有做完，但是百合灵却是完整剧情！MSG5和百合灵迷之相似！Outer heaven=Yuritopia!Yuna=BIG BOSS!因此百合灵比MSG5高的不知道哪去了！），看到除了我之外，还有人热爱着这个游戏我还是很开心的。
这个游戏让我来打分我可能会打八分，但八分其实也算给高了。BGM对某些人来说可能会显得单调，而没有完全配音也劝退了相当的一部分人（我当时还在设置里找，我到底哪儿弄错了居然没有配音了？），好在全配音制作似乎在进行了，我也只能拭目以待呢时候的百合灵能再活跃了！（Liar社你这套玩法我好像在漆黑的夏尔诺斯上见过啊）记得当他登录steam的时候，大家只知道第一个引进的无修R18，但作为一个玩了一遍又一遍，安利了一次又一次的人来说简直不能忍，为了R18而玩这个游戏的人还是请去他处艹猫吧。
结尾了也不知道说些什么了，这是我第一次写测评，难免有许多不足，我希望有更多人喜欢这个游戏，并从中获得各自的乐趣，正所谓一万个人有一万个哈姆雷特。与其犹豫纠结是否游玩，不如立即尝试，自己尝试来的好。

It took me a quite a bit put into words what I love so much about this game, and I'm not going to be comprehensive here. Lets just be clear that this VN touched me deeply and I won't ever forget it. I'm going to just ramble about the things I love about it.

I love the painted art, both the character designs and backgrounds. There are so many great/cute CGs that are perfectly used throughout the game. Aika petting Youka on the head, Umi braiding Sasa's hair, the Kindred Spirits and Yuna drinking coke on the roof...many more. 

I love the frank way the story handles homosexuality, how it doesn't ignore the closeminded people who think this love is just a phase between 2 girlfriends, but it also completely debunks that silliness. Throughout the 30 hours of content, this story is all about legitimizing yuri romance as equal to any other kind of romance. It does this naturally too, through its characters and dialog. The sparse ""h-scenes"" also do a good job of supporting that, and they aren't explicit or too long. These scenes are used for character development rather than just titilation, and their inclusion is very important to the arc of each couple.

And I love those couples, Youka and Aki are my favorite... all of them are sweet and wonderful though. Throughout the game there's a real sense that these folks love each other from the way they talk and think, it's so heartwarming. The drama is smart and never overblown, and the resolution is always satisfying. Not just the romantic couples, the friend couples are a treat to listen to as well. Yuna and Ano have a wonderful discussion towards the end of the game that is pretty much exactly what I needed to hear in a game like this. Everything regarding the characters and dialog work perfectly.

There are some presentation problems, the music is good but there's too little of it. The art is unfortunately low res and sparse sound effects are sometimes very bad. Even with those misgivings and the rather high price point, this yuritopia is highly recommended. It is worth your money.

作为一款纯百合游戏，《百合灵》各种意味上都是纯粹的“百合”：从游戏中没有出现一个露脸的男性、学校是女子高中等等的背景设定，到每个主要CP都无男性涉及[spoiler]、H场景中没有用奇怪的道具（x）[/spoiler]等等。百合作品有取悦观者与不取悦观者之分，在游戏、动画漫画等领域都有出现；而《百合灵》可以让人感受到制作方想做一款纯粹的“女孩子与女孩子恋爱”的游戏。游戏选材于最普通的高中校园生活，故事中每个人的性格也和平凡的你我相似，恋爱的动机、恋爱时的犯傻与悸动也让人脸红心跳之余不禁回忆起自己的高中生活，与曾经的爱恋之人。（可惜没经历过合宿与校园祭QAQ）这平凡而充满快乐的校园生活，能或多或少勾起了玩家们心中的共鸣，并让人更加沉浸在这一段段质朴的恋情里。此外，游戏中的选项不影响主要剧情，每一对都是固定的且是好结局；对于这种设计的评价各人有各人的想法[spoiler]（比如本人就好想攻略阿野呜呜呜），[/spoiler]不过从“营造温馨平和的故事氛围”这一点而言，这种设计也不无道理，制作方应该也有自己的考量吧。

画风与剧情方面，Peg朴素而稳健的绘画风格也与这款游戏相配，让人感到舒适并投入更多精力于剧情上。游戏对人物的刻画十分细腻，每一个主要人物都有着独特的性格，每一对情侣也有着各不相同的恋爱故事。可能由于人物与CP太多的缘故，个人感觉一些对于被追求方的心理转变描写可以更细致一些[spoiler]，比如广播组的羽美、师生组的小园生。我自己觉得最“合理”的CP是最先出现的学姐学妹，也可能是个人私心很喜欢这对啦（[/spoiler]。然而对于一个群像描写、主要人物这么多且文本量巨大的一款游戏，这也算不得是缺点，算是自己的小小执念吧。

此外，《百合灵》的日历系统是一个亮点。游戏以每月为单位，玩家将先完成该月某几日女主角或百合灵为视角的剧情事件，再完成本月某几日出现的、与特定情侣相关并以情侣中其中一位为视角的剧情事件。日历界面同时也是存档点。这样的设计很利于玩家理清事件发生的先后顺序，且能很方便地回顾之前的某个剧情（不用去特意存档），十分爽快。日历系统也方便解锁完成一遍游戏后出现的附加剧情（与主线剧情中的选项相关）。

总体而言，《屋顶上的百合灵》是一款非常优秀的百合gal游戏：风格温馨可爱；剧情丰富细腻；百合度非常高。
++丰富温馨的剧情
+独特的日历叙事系统
适宜的音乐（虽然重复度略高了一点儿…

游戏相当的一本道且流程并不长，但是爱情小品的剧情却非常的有意思不会让人感到厌倦，作为群像剧，每对CP都有自己的特点，都会让人爱不释手，而且少有的没有胃痛情节，基本上都是发糖，却甜而不腻，却能从中感受到每位角色的幸福实在是非常的棒。
但是缺点也是有的的，立绘的变换太少，有时候能看见台词已经变换了好几种心情了，但是角色的立绘却还是没有什么变化。人物的角色塑造虽然合格且各有特色，但是缺乏深度。选项的选择无关紧要可以说变成了单纯的有声小说（其实大部分时候没声）。当然最重要的一点就是对于感情描写太浅尝即止了，流于表面没有对于人物心理变化进行深刻的描写。当然现在这样已经很有意思了。对了，还缺乏阿野线和音七线，阿野实在感觉太路人，完全被剧情拿来当一个好用的人物，只有要用的时候才出现。而对于三人组线，我还以为是《无名的星群》一样的发展，结果音七竟然真的只是友情体现，说实话我觉得这样还要维持三人朋友关系实在是很奇怪啊，虽然剧情里面解释的还是蛮合理的.......

It's pretty much a kinectic novel (and nothing in the game's description informs players about it), which means, that if you expect some meaningful choices and branching paths, forget it. You don't have an impact on the plot (you can just unlock some extra scenes), you just read the story from various characters perspective and see how their relationships grow. 

I enjoyed it for the first two hours or so - probably because of unique protagonist, which is the best part of the game for me. She's relatable, normal girl, that isn't overly emotional and cutesy, which is often an issue with visual novels from Asian countries. Sadly, most of other characters were just annoying. To be fair, with such large main cast, it's hard to not find someone you dislike, but when you find so many of those girls to be either cliche, boring or non-sympathetic, you don't really care about their stories. With actual ""visual novels"", you can find some enjoyment in impacting the story. Here, though, there's nothing to enjoy.

[b]To sum it up[/b]: if you enjoy yuri kinectic novels, you may like it. Writing is fine, although often wonders into ""completely ridiculous"" territory, premise is silly and relationship between characters are rather sudden and very unrealistic. Still, there are many different characters and you probably will find someone relatable or interesting.

The planer system works pretty well. You can work your way through the planer on a day by day base or follow the routes to the next chapter (=month).

Decisions you make don't change the story but unlock extra scenes, that you can view after completing the main story once. Which is not the best solution, because the extra scenes start from the beginning, showing conflicts and thoughts, that already worked out, by the time, you can watch them.

Description:
Kokonotsuboshi Girls' Academy of Commerce, a school built on the site of an old castle, nicknamed ""Shirojo."" One day, the timid Toomi Yuna, who had been living a quiet life at this school, suddenly met two ghosts on the roof during lunch:

Enoki Sachi, who died in an accident before the war, and Nagatani Megumi, who died of illness 30 years ago. The two ""kindred spirits"" died with unrequited feelings in their hearts, met, and fell in love. They ardently wish to experience their ""first time"" together before their eternal rest.

...But they don't know how.

The two who are bound to the site of the school enlist Yuna to help them create more ""yuri"" couples at the school so that they can glean some sexual insight from observing them, and to assist the girls struggling with their hidden feelings.


Overall Thoughts: I enjoyed the ride for what it was. Kindred Spirits was hard for me to get into at first. I say the first 3 hrs are a pain to get through, but afterwards the story is enjoyable as it branches out over the next few months in the VN. The use of the planner makes the game easier to get through imo as its a pacer of sorts. Enjoyed the couples and glad they didn't pair up all the characters.  Good Yuri VN for the price. Drama CDs there if you end up loving one of the pairing and need more afterstory.

Pros: Length to price is good.
Good number of extras after the story is finished.
Best girl ends of Single as she is best girl.
R18+ Scenes added-in
Love the Planner

Cons: Lack of music tracks made me mute the game after 5 - 7 hrs in.
MC background event could have been deeper and more issues for the game length.
Presonally I didn't care for the main pairing.

If you plan on playing Kindred Spirits on the Roof, I wholeheartedly recommend the DLC that adds full voice acting to the game. That said, Kindred Spirits is a Yuri visual novel that has you playing cupid to 5 female couples struggling to get their feelings across to one another. It is a rather linear game, but it does give you some freedom in choosing which couple's story you want to read first after completing the main story for each month. The chapters are broken down into days on a calandar and make it for some nice light reading if you don't have much time to play. It's very easy to put down and pick up again, which I appreciate given my work schedule. 

I really love the characters in this game. Out of all the couples in this game, I only disliked one, which in my opinion is quite the accomplishment of the writing team. Each couple is unique and has thier own challenges. I think the clearcut winner is the pairing of Ariu Aki and Koba Youka. A A Ai's lyrics made me cry, it was so awesome and romantic. While the OST does have one AMAZING track, I still think the OST is not very good. For a game this long I think the main 10 tracks are just too repetitive. 

Also worth mentioning, the game does have H Scenes towards the end, but they aren't that long and no genitals are shown. It's very tasteful and showcases the appeal of sweet yuri romances. So if you are in it for the sex, I think you will be disappointed.

De la pure romance en veux-tu qu'en voilà  ! C'est pas cucul et en plus c'est drôle. Une VN rafraîchissante en somme.

Points positifs :
- Musiques, chaque couple a sa petite variante sonore si vous tendez bien l'oreille ;)
- Doublage partiel très agréable
- Graphismes, c'est beau, c'est agréable pour les yeux
- Des histoires touchantes (même si clichet faut avouer)
- Des persos tout aussi touchants et attachants
- De l'humour

Points négatifs :
- Kinetic (choix sans influence réelle sur le déroulement de l'histoire), j'aurais aimé avoir de vrais choix avec de vraies conséquences
- Un perso qui me plait beaucoup même si on la voit pas tant que ça et qui n'a pas sa romance dans le jeu, mais bon y a du subtext avec un autre perso (pas de nom pour pas de spoil)
- Vive les clichets (sans que ça soit vraiment gênant)
- Le prix plus de 30€ pour une vingtaine d'heures de jeu (MAIS vu le niveau graphique, le son et en fait le contenu globale et le temps qu'ils ont du passer à faire cette VN, je crois qu'on peut dire que ça les vaut bien).

1. Глупые, глупые-глупые-глупые диалоги.
2. Вещи, которые повторяют по 2-3 раза в одном разговоре, и хочется сказать, ""Да остановите эту пластинку, я уже поняла!""
3. Повторяющаяся, приедающаяся музыка.
4. Сюжет, сквозь дыры которого пройдет, как минимум, Солнце, если не Бетельгейзе. Такие они большие. При событиях, прописанных на таком уровне, можно было бы с тем же успехом просто сразу уложить всех в кровать, .
5. Ну и само собой, все вышеуказанное не имело бы никакого значения, если бы мне понравился хотя бы кто-то из 8 героинь, которых я успела увидеть. Но нет, все они раздражают меня не меньше, чем их диалоги.

Озвучка ничего, но из-за дурацкого сюжета и текстов хочется быстрее все прокликать - а озвучка в этом только мешает.
Тексты/мысли/общение/события, которые я в свои школьные годы прописала бы на том же уровне (если не лучше). Возможно, будь мне лет 14-18, эта VN мне бы зашла. Но сейчас она не вызывает у меня ничего, кроме утомленных вздохов.

Если бы я купила ее за 1-2 доллара, то промолчала бы и забила, чего только за доллар не купишь. Но за 14, и то со скидкой? Вот это? Srsly, за что?

Дальше спойлеры, они же замеченные мной (за 2 часа!!!!) сюжетные дыры, которые мне вспомнились.
1. Кто при крике ""Ой, в школе собака!"" выбежит на всех парах из класса на нее смотреть? Если бы я с друзьями сидела делала уроки/болтала/читала, мне было бы класть на каких-то собак в школе. Даже если бы я жила в Японии и собак видела мало - но блин, не НАСТОЛЬКО же мало?! Вот на ""пожар"", думаю, побежала бы, да.
2. Откуда она со 100% точностью узнала, за какой партой сидит ее любовь, если боялась за ней долго наблюдать, чтобы ее не застали?
3. Как она ожидала эту любовь ""минимум пол-часа"" (сказано в первом эпизоде), если боялась, что эта самая любовь ее под дверями застанет, и сбегала, пару минут подождав (сказано позже)?
4. Как познакомились духи на крыше, откуда у них сожаления, как они друг в друга влюбились, если вроде бы умерли с разницей в 50 лет? (это минимальная придирка, возможно, плохо объяснили/я чего-то не поняла)
5. Почему учительница, послав девушку отнести коробку, провожала ее до кладовки, а возле кладовки сказала ""Это не та кладовка"", и отправила к другой, не объяснив, где находится нужная? Что в голове у этой учительницы? Опилки?

It was only after doing all that the game worked without any problems.

I don't even think you have to be a fan of yuri to enjoy this game. The relationships presented for the most part feel fleshed out and reasonable, so I don't really think its just ""yuri for yuri's sake.""

If you buy this game (and, really, you should), you'll find the most tasteful, well-baked, meaningful scenes in the entire Yuri genre out of any visual novel available on Steam.

Consider, for the moment, the sex scenes. I've seen a lot of sex scenes (really, admittedly, I have), and, in general, I get into a scene and feel very comfortable being there, observing what's going on. These scenes are different, because they made me a little uncomfortable, but in a very good way. They make you feel guilty for intruding, which is something I don't think I've experienced before in a piece of media with NSFW content. It's impossible to get to those (pretty rare) scenes while also thinking of them as ""cheap."" They're not cheap, and, honestly, when you get to them, your heart and mind are more prone to explosive reactions than whatever's in your pants.

That's all because of the really well-executed buildup, where, for hours, you get to see these diverse and human characters build relationships with each other, going from strangers to acquaintances to friends to lovers, over a reasonable and realistic span of time. The calendar system in this game contributes to this wonderfully: by knowing when during the year each and every scene takes place, your mind quietly fills in the gaps between interaction with all the mundane stuff that you know has to happen at some point, unlike in other VNs where (presumably) the protagonist(s) is living a normal life until all of a sudden *boom* stuff just happens and *keeps* happening for some length of time over which the story takes place.

Not in Kindred Spirits. You are sat down back in your chair and told to -- if you'll allow me to paraphrase -- ""sit down, shut the fuck up, and settle down for the long haul. These things -- they take time.""

Likewise the atmosphere, visuals, soundtrack, and extra content are all fantastic. Would you ever have thought that a yuri DRAMA CD would ever be on anyone's localization plans? Well, they are with Kindred Spirits. When you're done with the game, you have plenty of extra material to go take a look at if the game really tickled your fancy.

The only regrettable thing is the lack of complete voice acting, but it's nothing deal-breaking. Voice acting is present for when it absolutely needs to be. When Hina says ""Yuna-nee,"" it just makes me smile.

EDIT: Full voice acting is now available. Consider this a mastapiece.",1479968558,1548046662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

+精彩的剧情

+以百合情感的发展为主线，而不是上来就直奔床去
+独特的日历模式，可以通过其他人的视角来体验发生过的事
+固定的cp，没有贵乱（大概）
+人物的言行比较贴近现实

缺点：
-非全语音，只有重要场景才有
-选项基本没有太多影响
-单一故事线路（如果你喜欢多路线类的gal的话）

Yuri absolutely everywhere in this school from the teachers, to students, to the ghosts.

The story of this visual novel is [strike]fairly ordinary[/strike] pretty damn insane. At first you're playing through thinking ""Huh, this is just a school story where you play yuri matchmaker"". [b]Wrong.[/b] The reasoning behind the characters doing this is pretty strange and when you get towards the end you end up wondering ""Is she really agreeing to do this?! Who thought up this story, what were they on and where can I get some?"". And then, as you expect from a yuri visual novel everything turns out just fine no matter how screwed things seemed to be. There is a reason for the ""psychological horror"" tag being there; I don't agree with it being there but some people might be scared by some of the initial ghost stuff.

The characters are standard tropes. You have the hardworking-but-actually-quite-emotionally-frail character. The younger, stupidly cute childhood best friend. The sleepy one. The energetic one. The antisocial one and so on and so forth. However, as is typical of a good visual novel, they actually make decent use of these tropes. The story written around them is fantastic and makes it work.

The artwork is not that great. It isn't bad, but it isn't great. But it is uncensored, so there is that. What makes up for it is the great soundtrack (all apart from the intro that will deafen you the first time you listen to it because you are unprepared and have the volume up slightly too high). Quite a lot of electric guitar and I love it, which I honestly wasn't expecting from a VN of this subject matter. The music is only slow when it needs to be so you don't end up struggling to continue through what is supposed to be an intense scene because the music sucked. The OST for this is fantastic and I will sing its praises.

Long version:
This is a superb collection of interwoven love stories. Each one is a yuri (lesbian) relationship--in fact, there are no male characters in the story at all. Most of the couples follow classic archetypes, but the actual execution is pretty unique for each. All the characters are extremely lovable, and the dynamics of their respective relationships and the challenges they face are well thought-out and seem very plausible (to me, anyway).

The best part about the way this novel is structured is that, as you get to know each of the characters, you also learn how they touch each others' lives. This makes the world feel more real, and gives a good sense of the larger school community of which these women are a part.

Graphics are pretty normal for a visual novel (that is to say good). There's not enough variety in the music IMO, but the music that is there is also quite good. The ""planner"" interface is different, but I found it quite effective once I got used to it. I always turn voices off when I read visual novels, so I can't comment on the quality of the voice acting.

It has a number of love scenes with nudity, so that can be a reason for some people to avoid it. Then the quantity of such scenes is relatively low and they do not appear until several hours in, so it's not for people who just want porn either. Furthermore, the majority of the main cast are lesbians, so people who have a problem with homosexuality would have a problem with this title. There isn't much of an engaging central plot or gameplay elements, so it also is not for people who need such things to enjoy a visual novel.
All that said, Kindred Spirits on the Roof is an upbeat yuri romance visual novel with a character-driven story that is very highly recommended to everyone who is interested in such things.

What makes Kindred Spirits on the Roof feel so praiseworthy is the quality of its character writing. The main cast is relatively large and yet every character was relatable in some way and felt very believable. These characters have a good amount of depth and many undergo an appreciable amount of growth over the course of the story. The writing also does a fantastic job of conveying emotions. While not everyone will have the same experiences as those portrayed in this visual novel, the emotions that result from them are universal and this story presents them in a way that anyone can easily empathize with.

Unlike most other romance visual novels which feature one protagonist with multiple potential love interests and routes, Kindred Spirits on the Roof instead presents a single story with multiple couples. This allows the reader to view all the different sorts of relationships portrayed within the visual novel without having to read through it multiple times. At certain points in the story, the main storyline will stop and the reader will be presented with a few different scenes to select that focus on the various couples from the point of view of one of the characters involved. The main storyline will not resume until all scenes for each couple are viewed. There are dialogue choices to make, but the story is ultimately linear and the choices only impact the dialogue immediately following the decision while all choices must be viewed to unlock every extra scene after the main story is cleared.

As far as overall presentation, Kindred Spirits on the Roof has a respectable level of quality. Each character has a decent number of sprites and even multiple outfits. There are also over 50 event images and the art looks pretty good overall. The soundtrack consists of 11 background tracks, an opening, an ending, and one insert song as well as instrumental versions of the opening, ending, and insert song. The quantity is not particularly impressive, but there are enough tracks to convey all the emotions needed and they are put to good use. I personally enjoyed listening to each track. Translated lyrics for the songs that have them can be found in the music player accessed from the scene selection screen. In addition to the main story and couple scenes, there are over 70 extra scenes that become available after completion and provide even more content. My time on Steam is a bit off since I had a habit of leaving the program open so I could listen to the music as I took care of chores and such, but I feel confident in saying I spent over 40 hours with this title.

Kindred Spirits on the Roof is among my favorite visual novels and the best I have read on Steam. There are some aspects that would turn some people off from it, but for everyone else it is a title that I very highly recommend.",1471692927,1480656645,True,7,0,0.594073295593261719,2,True,False,False,False,,,

If the visual novel worked differently, I would probably recommend with much less hesitation, but because of how it works, not only am I instead giving it this negative review, but I may not even finish it (or at least not after a break) because I ended up just flat out getting fed up with it. 

If that sounds strange, as I'm sure it does, then read on. 

[b]The Basics[/b]

Truth be told, the writing in Kindred Spirits on the Roof isn't all that bad. The art, while not exactly incredible, is actually quite charming, and the characters are all look distinct from each other while still not having designs too outlandish or stereotypical. 

The story is about a girl who comes to find she can see two ghosts who have fallen in love and who want to help other girls find love at their school. The girl comes to assist their quest, and slowly but surely helps a handful of couples get together and stay together over the course of the story, eventually finding love herself along the way.

It's light hearted, and those without much experience with how these types of stories are written or how homosexuality is viewed in Japan might experience some culture shock when reading some of the dialogue, but the game is overall pleasant in tone and develops all of its characters fairly and in a decent enough manner. 

On the negative side, the soundtrack only seems to have a little over half a dozen or so songs (it feels like half that for the first few hours), and it reuses this same pair of peppy tracks in scenes where they really don't belong over and over again. The tracks that start to appear later in the game during more emotionally driven scenes are much more enjoyable and immersive, but that same pair of peppy songs always come in no matter what.

Looking at these things, the game probably doesn't sound too bad, right?

Well, if it was just this, I would be giving the thumbs up rather than thumbs down right here.

[b]How Kindred Spirits ""Works"" and Why It's A Problem[/b]

When you go into a visual novel, usually you expect to progress through the story from scene to scene, occasionally making choices along the way. If that sounds about right, as it so happens, there are actually exceptions to this that incorporate different types of gameplay or ways of moving from scenes: Kindred Spirits is in the latter category.

In Kindred Spirits, the player progresses by viewing scenes through a planner. First, they'll view scenes about the main story of the protagonist and two ghosts who want to help the students of the school they're haunting find love, and then progress in the main story is halted so that scenes from the perspective of the other characters can open up on your planner on the relevant days.

At first, this seems like a cool and novel system. You open up your planner, which serves as the game's menu, and not only look at any scene you've already seen, but progress through the story with a sense of time alongside you! As you start helping more and more couples, you'll have more and more scenes to go through between each portion of the main story, all taking place on different days, some taking place on the same days, which can really make your planner feel full and...

And that is where one of the big problems with this system starts.

I appreciate the system the game offers. The idea is interesting, and letting players see different perspectives this way could work, in theory.

But to me, it presented a big problem. As I see it, the problem could be taken in one of two ways: It makes problems for players who are either more interested in the main story and would like to keep following that, but it also makes it even worse for players don't care for whatever flavor of the day couple(s) the game insists you need to focus on before you can return to the protagonist. 

Because you [i]can't[/i] proceed with the main storyline or even with [i]other couples[/i] further down the road until you see the scenes the novel wants you to see in more or less the order it wants you to see them. In a normal visual novel, this sort of thing is usually handled in a few ways: multiple routes, unlockable [i]optional[/i] side scenes, or just being flat out kinetic.

By Kindred Spirits giving players the planner, it makes them feel like they have a level of control that the game doesn't actually give them. I would almost say the planner not only seems to only exist to give players the [i]illusion[/i] of having input in the story, but I might even go as far as to say that it takes control away. 

There were too many times where I found myself not enjoying the game because the game yanked me back into the planner and told me I needed to stop reading the story I might have been enjoying or invested in and go back and see what other characters were doing during this same period of time. The narrative had me jumping all over the game's different times, going back and forth from the end of the week to the start of it to earlier that month from various unrelated perspectives, and it created an experience that felt disjointed on more than one occasion. 

This could all have been avoided if there were an option to let me come back to these scenes at my leisure, or just not get to see them if I progressed past the points they were relevant. Presenting and writing them in a way where I didn't have to keep jumping back and forth to the planner would have worked out, but as it is, it feels like the author wasn't able to make scenes that flowed together as well, and so they needed to create a system that could circumvent them having to have every scene naturally move into the next. The fact that many scenes include recaps far more lengthy than necessary of what's going on in that character's life only adds to this issue. 

Putting the scenes into entirely separate routes would have even worked better. It might have meant players wouldn't get the whole story in one sitting, but you would get fuller, more fleshed out experiences as opposed to the slapdash back and forths you may not even want to read about that you have here.

Despite all of this, the fact is that [b]this isn't a problem if you can get invested in every scene of every couple[/b]. It isn't. But that also hinges on [i]also[/i] not wanting to see something that comes [i]after[/i] something that's included in ""every scene of every couple."" 

If that were the case with me, I would not be writing this in a negative light. Yet on more than one occasion, the game left the main story on a cliffhanger so that it could open up up to ten scenes for me to go through, some of which might be mundane, inconsequential, or ones that the main character was present for, meaning you don't actually get all that much from seeing the other side to begin with. It wastes your time doing that. 

You may finish a scene and be ready to go on to the next, then find rather than another scene of the main story, you have to play as the other girls for a while. And that may be it for you. There is no rhyme or reason to it - sometimes you get many scenes of the main story before the break to see the other girls, sometimes only a few. 

That may not be a problem for you, or it may be even worse for you than it was me, so with this in mind, here's my last thought on the matter:

Incredibly sincere and heartfelt, chock-full of infectious emotion that you simply can't help but feel as you read on. Simply a pleasure to read every single scene - from the amusements of daily life, to heart-thumping romance, anticipation, tense moments of drama and anger. Art is perfect for what it is: not overly cute (or ""moe""), not overly serious, just some pleasantly designed characters that are easy to look at. The background music and theme song contribute to the game's atmosphere and are assigned to scenes appropriately. 

It's the writing that makes this novel so good, though. The novel was fantastically tasteful, even for such a sexually-charged premise. In fact, the focus on building friendships/relationships provided so much characterization for every character that you feel like you know them as intimately as a close friend would - a rarity in yuri works. Even the erotic scenes contributed a lot to building the characters, which I enjoyed so much more than the very well-written and well-drawn scenes themselves.

I have no idea how liberal the interpretation is from the original, but I honestly don't care. Liar-soft and the MangaGamer translators have done a stellar job writing a very well-made yuri story that, although far from novel or original, can speak to your heart and make it feel a whirlwind of emotion.

Absolutely worth every penny if you are a fan of the yuri genre. Thank you so, so much for this experience.

Notes:

I've completed the game and have replayed it multiple times. Nowadays I launch it outside of Steam once in a while and replay a couple scenes and sequences - and no, it's not the H-scenes!

I usually open Kindred Spirits outside of Steam and have many more hours than indicated on here.

There is one problem with playing this on Steam, where the game can slow down massively after around 20-30 minutes of gameplay.

But despite my misgivings regarding potential fanservice and to-the-point meet-'n'-flick that all of the news sites seemed to expect of Steam's first uncensored game of ""frank depictions of sex"", this visual novel turned out to tackle issues related to struggling romance, including but not limited to struggling with sexuality, age gaps, and the idea of valuing other close relationships against romance, not to mention a social and fairly deep discussion on what it means to feel love. It is superbly well written and, at times, poignantly heartfelt; some of the dialogue comes off as awkward in a realistic way, in the scope of anime and manga, but it rarely ever feels cheesy. None of the referenced (meaning named and drawn) characters are cookie-cutter personalities; no obvious tsundere, dandere, yandere, whatever. Rather, they are all multifaceted, organic creations, and the underlying theme regarding the main character almost perfectly fits an Uncle Iroh quote: [spoiler]""Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.""[/spoiler] I surprised myself by becoming very emotionally involved with the characters and their stories, and ended up reading through this VN twice consecutively, and plan to listen to the drama CDs (by which I mean read the subtitles) when #4 is subbed and when they go on sale. Honestly, the explicit scenes are definitely not the end goal; they're nice to have and certainly demonstrate the different levels of experience, clumsiness, and passion between the different couples, but ultimately I found myself wanting to know more about the relationships themselves. There are uplifting and embarassing moments, heated and heartbreaking moments, funny and eye-rolling moments.

The technical side is also very charming and fitting with the theme of high school romance. Only the more important scenes are voiced, which is a feature I tend to like since it gives an enhanced sense of emotion and climax to certain story arcs. Each main story arc has a number of side story arcs focusing on the individual couples intersecting it. In this case, the planner approach is a stroke of genius. My one complaint on this end would probably be the difficulty in attaining the extra scenes, which are unlocked after completing the game and through selecting different choices throughout the game (the choices are very minor and only affect these extra scenes and some immediate dialogue; the story itself is linear). The music, though somewhat limited in choice and looped a little poorly, is tasteful for the different emotional stings throughout the game, from simple and melancholic to upbeat and driving. My two personal favorites are ""Together"", played during pivotal scenes in each relationship, with its melody seeming to display a collapse of willpower and the sort of heartthrob one gets from a perfect relationship, and ""My Territory"", which is a somewhat cheeky tune without any particularly distinct mood that plays a lot during important character-building scenes involving the main character at home.

In short, [i]Kindred Spirits on the Roof[/i] is a well-written game that deals with relationships, longing, and the sort of struggles that arise because of each character's unique dealings and personal hurdles. It's a little expensive at $35, but I believe it to be well worth the price.

My personal relationship ranking: [spoiler]Yuna x Hina > Sasa x Umi > Sachi x Megumi > Seina x Miki > Tsukuyo x Kiri > Youka x Aki > Matsuri x Miyu[/spoiler]. Although, I have to say, it's pretty hard choosing.

Edit: I write this at the end of my third time through the main story. Right now, I think my personal relationship ranking has changed to: [spoiler]Yuna > Seina > Megumi > Aki > Sasa > Kiri > Miyu[/spoiler], but it's still damn hard choosing an order.

Edit 2: My, oh, my, the extras. I've played through the story three times now, but it's currently 2 in the morning because I've spent the last ten or so hours(!) playing through all of the extra scenes. In my previous two playthroughs, I thought I played them all, but apparently that was not the case. The extra scenes add multiple layers of depth to every character, and they tie the entirety of the story back together in satisfying and emotional ways, sometimes heartwarming, and sometimes heartbreaking.

That being said, this was the first time I encountered the 30-minute freezing glitch/bug. It certainly is annoying, but I did not seek a fix. I imagine you could uninstall and reinstall the files to try to fix it, but it's not something that bothered me that much.",1468463266,1472364333,True,5,1,0.5625,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Now steam is filled with openly stated pornogames and this title is no longer some hardcore sweaty lesbian sex visual novel to be boasted about hardcore sweaty lesbian sex contents. Well in fact there isn't a whole truckload of hardcore sex contents.

This game has no real branches - supposedly caused by the lack of funds for new branches. Choices you have to make are only related to the unlock of side stories. A good thing about those options is you don't have to start a new game to pick an alternative branch, you can just replay the story of that day and Ctrl it all through.
Illustrations have their own specific style which is absolutely not the mainstream watery eyed 5-head danseimuke moe style. It's way better than that IMO.

tl;dr - Anyone in the yuri shipping industry should invest. Good waifus.

Right, so anyway, to keep this review short and sweet this VN is good.
The main story focuses on our protagonist, Yuna, who is spurred into action as an undercover matchmaker by two gay ghost girls to subtly meddle in the love affairs of gay girls in her all girl's high school. So the premise is fairly simple, but with solid writing and letting us see events from the different girls' perspectives (who have different personalities and are all fairly likeable) makes for an immersive, at times emotional, story. Of course, when combining several romantic stories some might appear more solid than the rest, but which one you like is for you to decide. 

Being a visual novel the gameplay is not too interesting. You will be given choices here and there, but the story is linear and the only impact is some slightly changed dialogue and [spoiler] unlocking hidden scenes after completion [/spoiler].

""As for the music, it's okay."" 10/10 - [insert-gaming-site-here]
No seriously, it's just ok. Some catchy tunes, but overall ok.

The artwork is fairly good. The character designs are cute and varied and fit the characters pretty well. Some of the sprites can be amusing at times. The backgrounds, though, are rather generic with a few exceptions. The CGs used for the ""intimate"" scenes are rather tame, but I really don't think they are meant as fap material either way. Strangely enough I would say they are cute, emotional and intimate first and foremost. As something to be remembered fondly. That being said, the CGs can sometimes appear to be somewhat, eh, weird when portraying characters from certain angles. I noticed one CG in particular, but overall it's fairly solid.

You will probably want to buy this one for the story and while it has a simple premise the execution is well done. I got a little hooked, or emotionally invested so to say, and continued through the night. Then I got a bright idea, and turned off the in-game music for a piano cover of Celine Dion's you-know-which-song during the climactic last scenes. And tried not to cry. But cried alot. Sleep deprivation and exhaustion can do miracles sometimes.

These are the things most people will say if they didn't enjoy it.

I have to say that it's an AMAZING VN. As a fun of yuri stuff, this is a grate game. I will say that the game is a but high in price and this might be a actually thing that I dislike.

(edited after actualy finishing the game)

This game is really good. It got touching story, nice visuals and fine music.

Protagonist is second year student Yuna in all girls high school. One day Yuna gains ability to see two ghosts girls (Kindred Spirits) on the roof of school building. Those two rope Yuna into helping girls in love, express theyr feelings and archive hapines together.

Game is ""played"" by selecting scenes from calendar and leting them play out. Each month you first play out all scenes of main story (usualy staring Yuna and ""kindred spirits"") and then you get to explore events of same month from point of view of other characters. Unfortunetly you have to go thru all scenes for the month to be able to advance into next, unfortunetly because i didnt really care for some of the characters and i would happily skip theyr scenes.

Voice acting is quite good but only about 1/5 of scenes are actualy voiced. To be honest, VN with that kind of price tag i would expect to be fully voiced so this was kind of disapointment. Proper voice acting really changes mood of the scenes so not having them all voiced is unfortunate.

Anyway kudos to Mangagamer.com for bringing this game to Steam uncensored

[[ Kindred Spirits on the Roof/Okujou no Yurirei-san ]]

synopsis and stuff : https://vndb.org/v8508

this VN isn't fully voiced, probably around 40%

the story revolves around a girl named Toomi Yuna who was being asked by 2 lesbian ghost to be a yuri cupid
giving girls a little push to confess their love, helping them if they're having trouble with their relationship, secretly ofc

the whole overall story is not really that special, it's just a typical romance story, but with girls x girls.
it's yuri and basically, it's much much sweeter than straight romance imo. That's what gotten me into this VN
i cherishes yuri as a pure love, even if they had sex, it's a pure love sex.

for the art, well, it's not that great it's a standard VN art, quite polished, and the character design is pretty good
no comment for the music because i basically enjoy everything that i like to hear

all in all, it's a pretty good VN if you're searching for diabetes and kidney failures. If you're reading the VN just for the lesbian sex, you're gonna be disappointed though, there isn't much sex scene in here. If you want to read lesbian VN for the sex, just read SonoHana series instead.
oh and they never show vaginas in this VN

overall rating : 8/10
yuri is sweet, no?",1465024908,1465024908,True,4,0,0.475928515195846558,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Because of that, when I read about “Kindred Spirits on the Roof” (KSotR) being available on Steam, and about it being an 18+ VN, I was very hesitant and I was not sure if I should buy it or not. I thought it was only for the fan service, once all the screenshots I have seen of KSotR were 18+ scenes.

However, curiosity was stronger, so I decided on buying the game. First, because the plot seemed very interesting – with a bit of supernatural touch – and the most important factor: even being a VN, we do not have paths to follow or anything else: there are not lots of choices to make during the main route (MR) and anything we choose leads us to a common ending.

From the very beginning, the beautiful soundtrack captivated me, even the ambience sounds, and I the care LiarSoft had while developing this VN caught my attention: all the characters have their own consciousness and their actor voices match their personality very well.

I do not know if I should thank MangaGamer or LiarSoft or both for the vocabulary used in this game, but I have not read any profanity words during the MR AND in the sex scenes. About the sex scenes, I knew they were in this game – but they are soft and connected to the MR plot. I mean, there is not anything like “Hey, I like you, let’s have sex!” and all I could see was how strongly and deeply every character’s feelings for another one grew and how it ended in their first time (having sex, of course).

The point is, sex is not the focus of this VN, and it is only the consequence of the plot – and I was very surprised because of it. We have the girls’ act narrated so that all we can read is a beautiful poetry about their first time.

Above all, what impressed me the most was how focused on social aspects the game is. I mean, there are questions like “Do you think homosexuality is okay?” and “If I started dating a girl, how would society see us?”, what made me reflect about our own social values and everything – we can not deny that homosexuality is still a taboo in many countries.

I could not recommend this enough, I swear. 

See, the thing with visual novels on Steam is that they're either lacking in story, lacking in emotional pull (for me, at least), or they're het (again, that's a problem with me, others may vary). So, as it stands, it's kinda difficult to find a good yuri VN on here.

Kindred Spirits on the Roof exceeded my expectations. I swear on my own life, this is one of the best VNs I've ever plread. It has characters that you can connect with, who all have their own emotions and worries and traits. I felt myself get attached to each and every one of them, all in a different way. The romance is believable, shockingly enough for a VN, and the more intimate moments don't really feel forced. Quick note: If you're looking for ""Oh girl-on-girl is hot"" then I suggest you look elsewhere, because there are far better smut VNs for you to play in that case (I recommend Sono Hanabira for that).

I cried, I laughed, I smiled, I felt my face flush, I experienced more with this VN than I have...in a long while. Truly, one of the best I've played, and I am shocked to say that this surpasses Katawa Shoujo in my list of best VNs. This simply...hit me in a different way.

Now, that doesn't mean this VN is perfect. The music can be slightly annoying I suppose, but it didn't bother me all that much. Also, you might feel like the story repeats itself sometimes, since you go back through to see the couples outside of the main branch with Toomi.

Overall, I cannot recommend this enough, even at the price that it stands. 35 USD seems like a bit for a VN, but for quality...I feel quite confident in saying you won't find much better here on Steam.

Also, okonomiyaki is delicious, and I have this game to thank for sharing that with me.",1463313080,1463322219,True,12,0,0.602371275424957275,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So, a simple announcement: This game does not have ""steamy lesbian sex"", as many people think. Nor is it a fluff “doki-doki magical girl” fest. At least not entirely. So if you want this game for either of those reasons, think twice. 

Kindred Spirits, as a VL is really really nice. It's not a life changing game sure enough, but its filled with a good representation of ""Girls Love"" problems in a academic life style. I find the game long enough to expose and develop the whole story of the main characters and the different couples, and short enough you can play for a good amount of time without getting bored. (I know, it says I have about 5 hrs., but that’s because I had to run it outside steam. More on that later.)

KS has a solid and heart-warming story with interesting characters that develop nicely as the game goes on. No character ever becomes blurred in the sidelines, and they all have enough screen time and importance to be worthy of development. The game exposes several scenarios, each represented by a different girl, and by a different couple. Other than the 2 ghosts, the game is very faithful to (what I can imagine) realistic problems someone in that situation can have, without going too much on fantastic territory. Even the ghosts have problems that (if so the case"") ghosts could have. Then again, I´m not a girl who fell in love with another girl, so...

All in all,  Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a medium-sized game with good exposure, heart-warming and hilarious situations, down to the ground thinking and reactions and interesting characters. If I had to say something bad, it would be that two certain situations are a bit to abrupt for certain characters. [spoiler] The sex scenes come way too fast and way too hard, making one or two characters feel a bit out of character. Then again, that's what happen when you get horny. Boys and Girls alike. [/spoiler] Other than that, It´s a game that I fully recommend to anyone that wants to get started on Visual Novels, likes Yuri and has some spare time.

PROS:
-Interesting Characters
-Realistic plot
-Cute situations
-More Fluff than Sex
-When in Sex, well represented
-Complete and filling story
-A lot of in-depth to the characters.

CONS:
-Characters can be OOC at times
-Flat interface
-Steam version crashes the game every 15 mins or so. (To stop this, run the game outside of steam.)

Das Spiel nimmt sich Zeit, die einzelnen genauso liebenswerten wie abwechslungsreichen Charaktere langsam aufzubauen und beschäftigt sich eingehend mit ihnen. Dementsprechend lang ist zwar die Einleitung, die sich über ein paar Stunden hinzieht, aber es lohnt sich, diese Phase durchzuhalten. Nach über 40 Spielstunden war ich dann tatsächlich traurig, dass es schon aus war.

Es als Sexspiel zu bezeichnen ist aus meiner Sicht falsch. Derartige Szenen kommen im späteren Spielverlauf zwar vor (schließlich geht es um mehrere Liebesgeschichten), allerdings sind diese in der Art der Darstellung recht harmlos. Der Focus des Spiels liegt vielmehr auf dem Erzählen einer erinnerungswürdigen Geschichte.

Zum besseren Verständnis ist es empfehlenswert, sich vorab mit der Bedeutung der japanischen Anreden chan, san, senpai, sensei und sama vertraut zu machen. Hierbei sollte auch noch erwähnt werden, dass im Japanischen zuerst der Familienname und dann der ""Vorname"" genannt wird. Bei Toomi Yuna ist also Yuna der Vorname.

Zusammengefasst habe ich jede Minute des Spiels genossen und empfehle es jedem , der sich für romantische (mit einer Prise Dramatik verfeinerte) Komödien erwärmen kann.

The shortest review I can possibly give would be one word: Masterpiece. However, I feel that such a short, generic review would not do this beautiful story justice. I also feel that it would be irresponsible of me to give spoilers to the plot, as it is best experienced for yourself as you play through the game, so instead, I will try to take the middle road between brevity and gushing over this wonderfully touching story.

For starters, if you are looking at this game simply because it is a yuri visual novel and you're expecting to get some good wank material out of it, you may want to move along. Yes, there are several sex scenes in the game. However, they are NOT written to entice or excite the reader. Rather, they are written realistically, in the perspective of the couples experiencing their first times together. They are not pornographic, but wonderfully, touchingly emotional. 

The same can be said for the yuri romances throughout the game. They are not played up and fetishized, but are instead written in a sweet, pure way, genuinely fleshing out the feelings that the characters have for each other in a realistic way, as well as bringing up the worries of living in a traditional society that would see something wrong with them for feeling the way that they do. 

All the characters are written fantastically, each having their own unique personalities, even if some of them do fall into some old character tropes from anime. There's the always sleepy (but surprisingly perceptive) Miyama Nena, the cuteness-obsessed Tsurigimine Kiri, and the air-headed, rock obsessed Koba Youka, to name just a few. While some of the characters seemed a little flat to me the first time they were introduced, the game does a fantastic job of fleshing them all out.

On top of the excellent writing, the soundtrack and cg are also top-notch. I did get a little annoyed with the fact that the music in the game doesn't loop, even though the majority of the music seems to be made in a way that it could loop. Instead of looping or stopping, it just fades out, then starts again from the beginning. However, this is a minor complaint, particularly when compared to the quality of the music itself. The cg for the characters and scenes is also fantastic, drawn very smoothly, but with just the slightest hint of sketchiness to the lines, giving it a sort of innocent feel that fits in with the overall tone of the game.

Pros:
+yuri themed
+heart warming romance
+decent soundtrack
+good character designs
+good setting
+Steams first (I believe) 18+ game/VN

Cons:
-the art isn't great
-it isn't fully voiced, only during certain moments
-some of the characters romances are boring

What I really like about this VN is that its a yuri. I'm a sucker for a good yuri VN so I'm really glad that this got picked up by mangagamer, and that I can get it on steam. Probably my favorite part about Kindred Spirits is the main romance, which is between Yuna and Hina. I like Yuna as a protagonist for a couple reasons. Firstly its her design, its nothing amazing or unique but I'm really attached to her appearance. Next its her general character/personality. At the beginning she explained how she wasn't terribly social and always ate lunch on the roof, which I can completely sympathize with. She changes as the story progresses but she's still likeable.

The music is pretty nice as well, nothing amazing but there are a few pieces that stick out for me.

Another thing that I didn't realize I liked until I finished the main route was the system you play the events with. Its like a calender the days have events. Its pretty nice so that if you want to replay certain scenes you won't have to go through a wall of text to get to it or have 20 different saves.

The demerits are there, but aren't enough to make me dislike the game. The biggest is that it isn't fully voiced, its only voiced when there's a CG or during special events. Its not a terrible thing but it helps with the mood when certain scenes are voiced. Another issue is just personal interest, about half the characters and their romances are boring to me. Its not a big deal but I skim over their events more often than not.

Another kind of big issue is that its mostly a kinetic VN. There are choices but they don't impact the story at all, and the protagonist only ends up with one girl. It would have been great if you could hook up with the other characters too, especially since the protag becomes friends with them and I can see how a romance would blossom.

*Ahem* Okay now that's out of the way time for the review.

Yuri VN's, not really my thing. Don't get me wrong, Yuri's good, heck I love Yuri. I don't want to brag but I only needed to rest for an hour every time the girls kissed in Sakura Trick. Anyway, usually Yuri VN's are kinda too straight forward. I've seen many Yuri NV's in my time and I gotta say, it goes like this:

- Talking
- Kissing
- Y U R I S E X
- The end

Kindred Spirits on the Roof isn't like this (To all who are dissapointed that it isn't like this, shame on you, and me.) The characters are lovable, memorable and down right sweet and you'll have to rest for a whole day just to get your blood sugar in normal levels. The art feels kinda 'home'-ish, if that's a correct adjective to use for art. It certainly is good don't get me wrong.

The characters are well made, specially the main character. Usually when you see a girl in a VN you think ""I want to see that girl nekkid doing hot lesbian action with another girl"" (Is it just me? Really? Fuck you guys.) But the MC of Kindred Spirits left me with the feeling of ""I want to be friends with this kind of person."" But the latter still applies, that's why we have the MC's friend Ano. Ano is a Best.

Now for the negatives.

The only negative I honestly could find right now (Since I haven't finished the game yet) is the music. Again, don't get me wrong the music is good, makes me want to jump around and frolic in the fields of Japan with my lesbian friends, but god damn the LOOPING is just damn horrible. You play the VN then the jumpy uppity music plays, and you're so happy, the characters are happy, the gods of Yuri are happy, then the music comes to an end and you think ""Oh shit is it gonna be serious? Shit is this shit gonna hit the fan?? Don't ya fucking pull a CLANNAD on me ya fucking bastards!"" Then the Music plays again and everyone is happy again.

All and all it's pretty gud. Well worth the money I spent for the game and the tissues.

That said, as a yuri kinetic novel, it is nearly flawless.
The characters look like stereotypes at first glance, but are actually quite developed and act rather believably. There is enough variety for anyone to find characters to their liking and while I liked some characters a lot more than the rest, I did not hate any of them. Even the teacher/student pairing, made all the weirder because the teacher looks like she is 10, did not grate on me like I tought it would, mostly because every character has her time to shine and her own quirks.
More than anything, I felt like this game perfectly captured the nature of teen drama as I remember it. How even the most insignificant of exchanges can be misunderstood and blown out of proportion, not because anyone is mean, but simply because everyone expects others to just understand ""obvious"" stuff via pure empathy.
That said, in my teens, things did not resolve so systematically well for everyone... but here the happy endings go a long way to compensate for the sad moments (the whole premise is about ghosts of long dead high school girls who never experienced love in their short lives and  want to so that they can move on... yeah, want some fries with your angst?).
As for the sex scenes, they are more erotic than pornographic and mostly well built up into each couple's narratives. I think they could be easily ignored by players who don't like that kind of stuff.",1460070198,1460070198,True,7,0,0.602242171764373779,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The characters are all endearing although 3 of them I didn't much like until the end but with a cast of about 16 or so characters 3 isn't that bad.  For a VN of this nature they also avoid using tropes to limit characters.  I mean the tropes exist but not one character I found to be limited by them.  The romances were fairly believable as well.  They showed some of the bad but didn't rely on soap opera style exagerations to show it.  Also the couples run the gamut from serious and dramatic problems to just gut busting comedy at times, but none of it feels forced.  Two of the couples in particular I always look forward to because they are funny but it was the kind of funny I've seen in real relationships.  A must read even if girl's love isn't your cup of tea.

Being a complete noob to Visual Novels, I had expected something that would keep me entertained for 10, maybe 15 hours -- but as you, dear reader, can see above, this game has kept me occupied far beyond what I had dared to assume.

In my opinion, the charm of this game lies in the attention to detail that went into fleshing out all its quirky characters. Some of them may fall into well-known cliches, but they do so in a manner that is endearing rather than grating, and thanks to the way their personalities interact with one another, all of them are deeper than just a collection of shallow categories.

I also really like the art style of this game, for the soft colors and realistic proportions are a nice change from the ubercute semi-chibis you see in other VNs, and together with the game's setting and the characters' inexperience in matters of love, it weaves a realistic environment where it becomes easy to feel with and root for those poor girls who are understandably overwhelmed by these blooming feelings.

Kindred Spirits is NOT a ""porn game"", and whilst this may come as a disappointment to some, I'd say it is actually one of its greatest strengths. ""Fan""service such as pantyshots or ridiculously exaggerated breasts are thankfully absent here. Make no mistake: in spite of its spicy yuri scenes (tasteful nudity, in the words of the developer), this is ultimately a game about emotions, and you may find yourself laughing or crying with the characters as the story progresses. The writer as well as the translator deserve appreciation for what they have crafted here, and it seems to show in how popular the game has already become -- so much so that it seems to develop into its own franchise, already with 4 Drama CDs soon to be released on Steam.

It took me a little bit to get used to the calendar you use to select and play/unlock the game's scenes, but I've quickly discovered its value in how it makes it easier to assume the role of different characters experiencing the same scene. I'm not one of those players who hunt down every single ""route"" they unlock with different choices (I play through a story once, and that's my headcanon), but even so I was amazed by the sheer amount of content. Even after the main story is over, there's a ton of ""extra"" scenes that provide additional insight into the side characters, answering questions that may have been left unanswered so far.

PROs:
+ *very* likeable characters with realistic teenage worries
+ amazing artwork (including the chibis!)
+ (mostly) superb voice acting, in particular for some of the more emotional scenes
+ lots of content (extra scenes, song lyrics)
+ DEM FEELS (slice-of-life, slapstick, romantic comedy, drama)

CONs:
- few choices (I'd almost classify KSotR as a ""Kinetic Novel"", though this did not detract from it being crazy fun)
- not consistently voiced (a few additional scenes may have benefited from voiceovers)

[edit] the 2nd CON is now half-resolved, as the release of Full Chorus greatly expands the amount of voiced content. it costs a few bucks extra, but I would deem this upgrade a worthy investment. [/edit]

YouTuber Nixxi is hosting an incredibly funny LetsPlay here, though I greatly recommend only watching it after actually having played the game yourself so that you benefit from fully developed attachments to the characters that are being made fun of: https://www.youtube.com/user/VnixxiR/videos

-Heard about this game from an article about it being uncensored. I hope Steam allows more of this in the future, regardless of the genders or sex included. 
-Shockingly, lesbian pairings and girl on girl stuff really isn't my ""thing"", and while the price made me almost reconsider, I jumped in and played it, and only just now reached the ending.
-Don't watch that intro if you don't want spoilers!
Pros-
1. Very good story in visual format, great artwork and settings
2. Well-developed characters, a majority of them being more than one-dimensional and fleshed-out (Phrasing, Boom!)
3. Different perspectives, sometimes with surprising results!
4. Emotionally heavy, but not in a burdensome way
5. Light humor, heavy on the drama, sad when it needs to be, and nothing really unrealistic actually ('cept GHOSTS)
6. Music fits really well with the situations, especialy with the tone of the scenes
7. And featuring unsusual amounts of Japanese cuisine!
Cons-
1. Some perspective scenes are really repetitive, both with dialog and music
2. Some pairings are just going to be more interesting than others
3. You are given dialog choices, but quickly find that they don't have a lot of impact (even if you totally guess correctly)
    ...Yet you need to replay those to choose the other option for unlocks later, D'oh!
4. Weird pacing, not only with certain parts of the plot but with the events as they play out on the calander.

At first, the game might start out a little slow but that's only because it's fleshing out the characters and introductions. Once I got through that small bump, I honestly loved every second of the game.

The protagonist is easily likeable even from the getgo (it doesn't take long before you utterly love her, really) and the girls that are introduced afterwards are all rather unique in their own way and easy to become fond of. Their relationships went in ways I didn't expect but definitely had me grinning as they developed. Nothing about it feels rushed or awkwardly forced. It all seems really genuine even with the realism they seem to add to it (a crush that starts out entirely one sided, age difference, etc.).

In terms of content, it definitely has quite a lot in my opinion. Even after you finish the ""main"" story line, side stories are unlocked that show the other girl's feelings and their perspective. It's also important to point out that while Yuna (the protag) has a large role in aiding the start of their relationships, you also see how these girls come together from their own perspectives. With the side stories, you see what the other person was thinking at the time and how they were feeling, so in a way you get to see both sides. That was utterly amazing, honestly.

As for the nudity, none of it feels perverted or done in the purpose of trying to get more views/customers. They arrive to that point naturally in their relationship, and not every couple goes as far as some. Even then, everything feels warm and loving. These scenes were made to show their feelings for each other, rather than to just draw naked girls, which is a definite bonus.

If I was asked to describe 'Kindred Spirits on the Roof' in terms of my anime experiences, I would have to say that it reminds me of a cross between "" Kuttsukiboshi"" and ""Sakura Trick"" mixed in with a cross between ""Maria Sama ga Miteru"" and ""Strawberry Panic"".  
 
The two ghosts - or 'Kindred Spirits' as they prefer to be called, may as well have been drawn from the likeness of Sachiko and Yumi. Not to mention, Matsuri and Miyu - the track and field sempai - look an awful lot like Sei and Yōko. This led me to believe that the design choice may not have been entirely unintentional. Considering how big a part ""Maria Sama ga Miteru"" has had in the Yuri/Shoujo ai genre it doesn't really surprise me. In fact, it almost felt as if the game was paying homage to these roots, expanding on them and going into an area that was not possible 10 years ago.  
 
I very rarely play a game through more than once – feeling as if once I've done the main story there are too many other games out there to try so no need to do all the ""side stuff"". Kindred Spirits on the Roof however is a visual novel that made me want to not only experience all the ""side stuff"", but made me want to re-experience it again and again - in the same manner as one would re-read parts of a favourite  book or rewatch parts of a movie that left an impression.  
 
As flaws are part of any review, I do feel obligated to touch upon them. Although, in my opinion, the main flaw here is simply the lack of voice acting. While all the main scenes have voice acting – it would've been great to see it in the side stories as well. The voice acting in this game is so exceptional that it's truly a shame that there's not more of it.  
 
In conclusion, if you're looking for an experience that will put a smile to your face and make you feel good about life, love and the human race in general – then look no further. Kindred Spirts on the Roof will do just that – and more. In my 100 + hours with the game I got the 'full clear' icon with all the extras unlocked – yet I'm still keeping it in my favourites so that I can come back to it whenever I need a 'pick-me-up'.",1458996185,1458996534,True,3,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For some context: I read a lot of visual novels, and I regret that. There's not really any other way to put it. I like the medium in theory, but the vast majority of what you can find is just bad. Pacing in particular is a problem, followed up by tendency to throw in reprehensible content.

Kindred Spirits is novel right off the bat because something actually happens in the first hour. While it's not immune to pacing problems, Kindred Spirits' plot moves along fairly regularly, aided by the device of the planner breaking the story into discrete chunks. Another thing that stops Kindred Spirits from feeling like it's stalling out is the fact that it follows a handful of couples, so someone's story is always advancing meaningfully whatever you're reading.

The couples are what is going to make it for you if you like the game. The characters are all unique and fairly well written, and the game for the most part does a really good job of differentiating the characters' internal monologues when there's a scene from their perspective. Yuna is an interesting character and one who I feel a lot of kinship with, but seeing the antics of the various couples as they fall in love and strive to start a relationship is bulk of the draw.

Well, I guess there's one other potential draw. The elephant in the room.

According to one of the translators, sexual scenes are only roughly 6% of the script. Having read all of it, I'm surprised it's even that high- and if sex scenes are 6% of the script, then things like ""nngh"" and ""ahn"" have to be at least 3%. I'm not a huge fan of sex scenes in these kind of games to begin with, but if you're going to have them Kindred Spirits' ones are fairly good. They do a decent job of making the people actually seem like teenagers who have no idea how to bone, and the CGs never get more explicit than a few anime tiddies. Unless you're incredibly morally offended by euphemistic reference to heavy petting you'll probably be fine- it's not like people are breaking out the dildos for a 50 page orgy.

One complaint you can level (aside from the pacing and editing, which, while WAY above VN standard, is still a little long sometimes)  is the ""extra scenes"". Once you finish the main story, you're only about half way done. Various scenes pop up all over the planner, and the main way they're unlocked is making choices in the main game. This is sort of a hassle, so I'd recommend just going back and choosing the other option every time you see a choice to get it out of the way early. The extra scenes are nice, but they're where the game threatens to outstay its welcome. Personally I was charmed enough to enjoy it right up until the final extra scene, but I suspect a lot of people will be done about halfway through the extras.

Also, the game makes you think it might have alternate routes, but that's a lie, choices only affect the extra scenes. Which is a shame, but there's nothing wrong with there being one story you want to tell.

In summary, Kindred Spirits is a cute little game that's a lot of fun. It lasted me about a month and I enjoyed my time with it.",1458675381,1458675388,True,32,1,0.750545859336853027,0,True,False,False,False,,,

However for the most part I really love it. The couples are a bit hit and miss but they're clealry designed try and tick as many boxes as possible and theres a couple for everyone I think. The game looks and sounds good, though its resolution options (or total lack therof) are a bit annoying and I came across a reoccurring bug where the game wold freeze after about an hour playtime, though I suspect this is more a harware problem and not the real probelm i have with this game.

The problem is that what you want, doesnt matter in this game. This game is about as linear as it gets and any choices you make are at best completely pointless and at worst simply there to give you the illusion you're participating. Now heres the real kicker. The game has a romance involving the player character, which you get to influence in absolulely no way whatsoever. A fact i learned after i made a choice the i thought loigically, would almost certianly cause a different outcome and it having apparenly no effec and never being brought up again.

Honestly finding out that I had no agency in this world was shocking. The game's own presentation and genre had made me think that, of course being able to pick who the protagonist ended up with, that was a given. Instead the game had presented me with a choice that caused me to anticipate that I would get to pick a romance and given me idea who i would get to pick between and I in my enthusiam latched onto it. But I latched onto the wrong character, the one who though i prefered i suddenly wasnt allowed to romance. I was never supposed to romace them but I thought I would be able to and as it seemed more and more like I really wasnt ever going to get to romace the character I had over the course of ten hours set my heart on the more I resented the other character for not being her. 

Now you may be thinking. ""That's a bit entitled surely? If the developers want to tell a paticular story they're allowed to."" Which I agree with wholeheartedly. But it brings me to my second problem with this aspect of the game, which is that I find this romace to be uncharacterisically uncompelling, In fact I find the inital premise behind the romance slightly offputting being about as close to incest as you can get without it actually being incest and its not like this is a par of the game that can be skipped or skimmed over as its the main storyline.",1457668514,1457668514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

A couple of things to note first off. I think the price-tag is still a bit steep, and I'd highly recommend watching this like a hawk for sales if you're truly interested in experiencing it. The demo will give you about the first 2 hours of story and introduce all of the characters. You can even carry over your save state from the demo since they're all held in simple files.

The other issue I've run into was performance. There's nothing about this VN that should cause stutters or lag, but I found consistently that I'd get about 20 minutes into a session and suddenly text speed would halve and the minimal on-screen movement of sprites would diminish even further than that. This problem might be localized, and it's ultimately a minor gripe, but I figured I'd give the heads up.

That said, I do highly recommend checking this out, especially if you're a fan of romance in any way. There's a lot to get into and there's a surprising amount to digest. The base game covers about 21 hours and the extra content delivers as many or more scenes in a smaller format for 5 hours.

Not a single moment is wasted driving the narrative. There are multiple points of comedy (Ano is an absolute trip), there are chances to cry, and there are points of pure catharsis. This novel is a bit unique in that sex drives the narrative, yet is never solely the focus. It would be unfair to say the erotic scenes don't serve their own purpose in character development, but they are simply moments where everything comes to a head.

I think the thing that impressed me the most in this is how organic the development of the main character is. I won't tell much, but it's very clear from the beginning that Yuna is not living entirely as herself. Her story perhaps more than any of the others is worth being read and appreciated.

Really, the thing that will make you enjoy this game is the sheer realism behind it in spite of its crazy, spirit-driven premise. A wide range of situations reach all of the characters, from the couple that have been in love for years but have had to hide it, to a new, entirely taboo affair between a teacher and student, to a 2 out of 3 couple that overthinks absolutely everything.

If it were any use, I'd write paragraphs on paragraphs about the merits of each individual character, and that's really where the biggest strength of Kindred Spirits on the Roof lies.

Although the basic premise of the game revolves around sex, the story focuses on friendship and romance and overcoming life's challenges.  The actual sexual content is almost incidental, although I would still recommend for adults only.

While the game is expensive, it is also quite lengthy for a single route with bonus content, between 30 and 40 hours.  Normally I like to read for just a few hours at a time, to let a story marinate and let me immerse in its setting and characters and situations.  Although each scenario is relatively short, there's always something happening or something to look forward to or some reason to read just one more!  After the main route is completed the game opens up bonus scenarios equal to a small fandisk, which is good because no fandisks were made so this is all there is.  I wish there had been more of Hina's ""wawawa"" moments, but what there is is very good.

The music is suitably cute with a decent variety of tracks.  Early on they got repetitive, and the way they faded out then got loud again when they looped to the beginning was kinda distracting.  Days later though I will sometimes hear them sneak into my consciousness at relevant times.

The characters are central to the experience, and everything about them is spot-on: their basic design, art, poses, expressions, outfits, actions, and voices are all perfectly suited to them.  Sure some of them are a little stereotypical or tropic, but the story at least gives reasons for them to be the way they are.  The characters share moments that are cute, sweet, touching, and occasionally surprisingly hilarious, all while staying in character.  I couldn't help but cheer for all of them.

Two characters deserve special mention:  Hina is the most adorable ever, and Yuna's voice actress nailed it with a sweet-sounding voice I could listen to forever.

When it's all over, you're left with an ending theme by Rita that will keep me nostalgic for a long time to come.

Seriously that's what the internet is for so don't waste your money.

I fully expected something like that from this game, just another excuse to ogle at fictional girls. To my surprise it was not like that at all, at least in the time I've played it thus far. No gravity breaking tities, no brain-less bimbos smutting up the place, no (well, almost no) hyper exagerated archtypes. It's almost as if Kindred Spirits wouldn't be a typical anime *gasp*

Joking aside there is an interesting story here to enjoy, unless you don't like visual novels then see the above note, and the characters I feel are well written so that everyone actually becomes a character and not a one note prop to move the story. Best of all this is an actual game with choices. I don't know how the choices affect the later story, but it does give some agency to the audience which I think too many types of these games forget. The story is told different angles so I also didn't feel stuck with the main character through the whole ride. A nice thing also is that I don't think the game makes blanket statements about homosexuality, there are characters who question such pairings, maybe not enough to be more realistic but enough that the audience knows this isn't a completely common thing.

The one problem I have with the game is the voice acting. I am one of those anime fans who prefers anime subbed rather than dubbed which this game is, so if you have a problem with japanese voice acting that is something to note. My problem comes from the voices they chose for some of the characters. Everyone has a VA to them so that's nice, but some of them sound like kids in elementary or middle school. That's my thoughts though.

It's a nice game with a good story and more character than a stereotype anime. If you enjoy these things then this might be up your alley.

The R18 stuff is not much, with 1-2 CG per pairing with nothing much going on, along with conveniently placed stuff to cover the private part. You can see nipples, but that's about it. So again, don't buy this if you're looking for the R18 content

If you're not just looking for that, then maybe wait for a sale or something. The price is a bit daunting indeed, but for me personally, i did not regret buying at launching discount, at all.

Gameplay:
Nothing much, it's just your usual VN. The kicker here is that everything is already predetermined, so no matter what choice you make, the ending is still the same. The choice however would unlock more extra stuff for you to see after the main game complete, which makes the playtime more than worth it. Unlike usual VN where you go in a straight line, this VN enables you to go parallel, meaning there's one main story, and several side story that you happens at the same time in the timeline. So you'll be playing as several characters, seeing it from their own perspective, which makes the depth of the story really hits home. Of course, this can leads to several moment where some story ended up on some not-so-likeable note and you need to wait for the story to progress to see the continuation. So far it's not a problem to me, but it's definitely not something i'm used to.

Story:
If you're buying this not for the story, then you missed out a hell lot. The story here is well written and nicely paced, and with the unique cast of pairings, well maybe not so unique, but some is, you can't help but like most of the cast. This is not your perfect utopia where everything went smoothly, which means every character have their own conflict to deal with, adding more realism to the story. This game is one of the few games that actually managed to make myself cry, despite being a R18 yuri VN. Overall, i cannot reccomend the story enough. Definitely a must buy if you enjoy School Romance and Yuri genre.

Oh and the supernatural part do comes in and out of the story, but in the end it doesn't really affects the realism.

Graphics:
Your standard VN style CG and sprites. Can't really comment much on this part, but if you like what you see in the screenshots, you won't have any trouble liking the art-style. The R18 CG is pretty well done though, i must admit. Definitely more detailed than the screenshots provided.

Sound:
The VA is great. Every voice fits with the character, and the acting quality is really good. You won't be disappointed with the VA quality. What you might be disappointed with might be with the amount of voiced lines. [b]NOT ALL LINES ARE VOICED[/b]. All the main point of the story is voiced however, so in the end it's not much of a problem. The R18 section is voiced, so yeah.

The soundtrack is nice and all, but there's nothing more to it. It fits the mood well, but i won't go as far as to reccomend it. The OST isn't so bad either, but yeah, just decent. One of the insert song was quite good however, which i would reccomend listening to it.


TL;DR:
You like good storytelling? You like yuri? Buy it, it's worth the money. Don't buy it if you're in it for the R18 stuff.

First off: should you buy the game?
You should definitely play the trial version, and then you will truely understand which direction this VN goes.
Honestly, I have to agree with some people; it's a very niche genre - perhaps never will see another game like this.
Liar Soft, please give us a sequel.

It's a great game overall, with minor setbacks:
Decent Story: Story overall keeps me reading. Some side stories, that I felt, could have been elaborated a little more. 

Decent soundtrack: After going through the story, I'm hoping they make the soundtrack easy for puchase on Steam.

Decent artwork: The creators did a great job on making the scenes feel natural, and the characters are what I like to describe as modern - this VN could probably become an anime/OVA of some sort, and not like some old ecchi from the early 2000s.
[spoiler]They also did a decent job of making the characters look great in the softcore scenes, if you catch my drift (lol). [/spoiler]

Decent performance - When the game is running, but you swtich windows, the game may slow down, and you will see text slow down as it rolls across the screen. The game has worked fine for me, and I don't often see this issue. though other readers may say otherwise.

But really, this game is great.
Yuritopia- I mean, Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a mainly kinetic visual novel (meaning that choices, if any, have almost no effect on the outcome of the story) in which Toomi Yuna, a 2nd year highschooler encounters a ghostly couple on the roof of her school. She quickly becomes their (slightly unwilling) accomplise in bringing other girls in her school together.
In order of best to worst from my experience:
Art: 10/10
I havent seen a game of any kind in so long where the artist actually took the effort to make different costumes and colors for a whole variety of situations. In particular, I love the style <3. It really helps to bring to mind the feeling of a girl in love.
Music: 9/10
The track isn't very large, but what is there is well made and pleasant to listen to without being too overwhelming or distracting. Only problem I really had was that the tracks didn't loop at all.
Story: 8/10
The premise of the plot is actually...kind of orginal? It definitely wasn't something I'd seen before. Of course, in execution, the story became a little more mundane, but it was still enticing to read from beginning to end, and I loved the ending.
Characters 7/10
Most of the characters are well developed, but they tend towards fairly typical archetypes common in japanese culture, so if you're used to that, you might get bored of their antics quickly.

As for stuff that can't easily be graded:
+ Game length: for me, I cleared the main story in about 20 hours, but there's more for you to do afterwards, and I estimate about atleast another 5-8 hours of gameplay is left. Not bad at all.
- UI: While the UI is not cluttered, It is instead compact and fairly complicated for a VN, including far more visual buttons than is common. On that note, the options is fairly cluttered, even if everything is labeled.

All in all, I think the game is almost worth its full price, which is not something I'd say about most VN's, especially on steam. Even at 10% off, I think this game is worth buying.

그런 아쉬움을 달래줄 농도 진한 백합게임이 드디어 스팀에 진출했네요.

""자신들이 유령이 아니라 유리영이라고 주장하는 골때리는 유령들을 만난 주인공은, 이들이 레즈커플들의 섹스신을 염탐하는 것을 도와주게 되었습니다.""
이렇듯 게임 플롯은 섹스신 염탐인데 정작 그 섹스신이 앙꼬없는 찐빵같은 맛이라는게 함정.
물론 섹스신이 앙꼬들어간 찐빵이었으면 스팀에 들어오지도 못했겠지만요. 



스토리 9/10
본편-사이드스토리-후일담의 구조로서 충실한 텍스트 어드벤처 플롯을 보이고 있습니다. 덕분에 플레이타임은 상당히 긴 편입니다. 보이스 구간을 스킵하지 않으며 진행하면 엔딩까지 30~40시간정도 걸리고, 후일담까지 하면 대략 50시간정도 걸리겠군요. 다만 그 보이스가 풀보이스가 아니라는 아쉬움이 있습니다. 주요 이벤트만 보이스가 나와요.
이벤트 진척도나 개방율이 표시가 안돼서 100% 달성을 했는지를 확인하는게 힘들군요. 분기점 시스템마저 있어서 선택에 따라 스토리 개방도 달라지고... 다만 스토리 개방이 어렵진 않아서 이 게임에 적용된 시스템은 신선하다고 봅니다.
플로우차트가 일직선이 아니라는 점도 괜찮게 평가합니다. 다만 플래너에서 클릭하기 전까지는 그 스토리가 누구의 스토리인지 알 수가 없다는게 단점이군요. 단순히 본편(인형)-사이드스토리(체리)-후일담(사과) 의 아이콘으로만 표시하기보다, 각 캐릭터에 맞는 컬러링을 부여해서 좀 더 보기쉽게 해주면 좋았을 것 같군요.

게임 시스템 6/10
게임편의성은 상당히 높습니다만, 플로우차트... 여기서는 Planer라고 나오는 화면에서 세이브로드가 나타나지 않는 것이 단점. 
직접 스토리를 눌러서 진행하기 전까지는 어디에서 분기점이 나오는지 알 수가 없다는 것도 단점.
게임 시스템적으로 플래시 기반 게임이라 랙이 쩝니다. 일본게임들이 근본적으로 피시게임을 잘 못만드는 경향이 있긴 합니다만, 그래도 텍스트어드벤처 전용엔진이나 렌파이 정도면 봐줄만 하게 만드는 편인데 이건 플래시기반이라 얄짤없이 랙겜이군요.
영어 번역 상태는... 음... 좋게말해줘도 좋다고 볼 수는 없습니다. 일본어를 어느정도 아는 영어플레이어를 대상으로 번역한 모양인지, 일본어에 익숙하지 않고 영어만 되는 사람들은 재미가 반감될 것 같습니다. 게임 제목부터가 우리나라만 돼도 유령-유리영의 말장난이 가능한데 영어로는 이 말장난을 할 수가 없으니 원래의 의미가 살아나질 않고 있고.

음악 7/10
게임 음악은 상당히 좋습니다. 게임 분위기를 잘 띄워주는 좋은 곡들입니다. 하지만 그 수가 좀 단점이네요. 이 '음악의 수'은 다른 텍스트어드벤처와 비교해서 평가했습니다. 게임 자체가 음악을 적게 가지고 있는건 아닙니다. 갤러리 상에서 15개의 숫자면 적은건 아니라고 볼 수는 있습니다.(히든트랙이 있어서 실제로는 16개입니다.) 그렇다고 많은것도 아니고, 그나마도 두개는 보컬/논보컬 버전.
화자가 변경될때마다 뜨는 아이캣치의 음악이 뜬금없습니다. 아이캣치는 차라리 무음으로 했으면 좋았을듯.

기타 7/10
갤러리가 스토리 바로 옆에 붙어나와서 상당히 직관적입니다. 대부분 갤러리메뉴가 따로 있어서 게임을 하고나서 보면 이 씬이 어디서 나온거드라? 하고 어리둥절 하게 되는 경우가 많은데, 이 게임은 갤러리가 바로 스토리 옆에 붙어있어서 그 경향이 덜합니다. 다만, 그로인해 갤러리 페이지가 쓸데없이 많아졌다는 단점은 있군요.
갤러리가 단순히 CG갤러리인 것도 약간은 단점... 입니다만 플래시 기반 겜이라 이벤트 갤러리로 했으면 랙 장난 아니긴 했을듯 ;;

총평 (9+6+7+7 / 4) = 7.5 / 10
만약 소프트한 백합게임을 좋아하는 분이라면 8~9점까지도 줄 만한 게임입니다. 그리고 이 말은 에로스적 레즈게임을 좋아하는 분이라면 6~7점 선이라는 말이겠지요.
애초에 게임 플롯부터가 섹스씬을 보자는게 주 목적인 게임에서 섹스씬이 심심하니 말 다했다고 보긴 합니다만 ;;

커플이 
1. 1학년 신입생 - 3학년 상급생
2. 2학년 동갑내기
3. 3학년 동갑내기
4. 문제아 - 선도위원
5. 나이차이 나는 소꿉친구
이렇게 구성되어있습니다. 의외로 친척간(혹은 가족간) 커플이 없군요. 일본 백합의 정석이나 마찬가지인 친인척 커플이 없는건 좀 의아합니다만, 덕분에 스팀에 들어올 수 있지 않았나 합니다. 뭐, 그 비슷한게 5번커플이긴 합니다만...

상당히 잠재력을 가진 게임이라고 생각됩니다. 시리즈화 된다면 말이죠.
시리즈화 된다면 차후엔 플래시가 아니라 텍스트 어드벤처 전용 엔진으로 제작됐으면 좋겠네요.

While this is an eroge, like most those types of scenes are at the end of the game, and are overwhelmed by the vast majority of content that goes into telling the story of each couple growing together. Add in some great slice-of-life moments that make you laugh, smile, and empathize. It's that type of game. I think I could recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys sweet slice-of-life stories, manga, etc.

For me, this is one of the very few Yuri Visual Novels, and was a must-buy from what I heard. And I have no regrets- it is definitely worth the price-tag as well. Most will scoff at it, but this is very long for a Visual Novel- you have the main story scenes, the side-story scenes(marked by cherries on the planner), and then you also get access to post-main-story scenes which are represented by apples in the planner and are unlocked by making different choices in the main story. I did not expect to get character interaction between certain characters(namely those outside couples), but the apple extra stories have become some of my favorites since those characters that may have not gotten much love in the main and side stories shine here. This Visual Novel is huge, simply put. In terms of time, I have put in roughly 27 hours so far and have not finished all the extra scenes yet.

No......not at all.

Granted, #yuritopia is definitely an apt, one-word description for this VN, but....well....it's too substantial. Of course, Liar-soft knows their target audience quite well, so it is ultimately, uh, quite scandalous. So, it is obviously not nearly as philosophical as Utena or as strict as Hourou Musuko or as dramatic as Maria-sama. It's not that deep. But, it's not as fluffy as Yuruyuri or Love Live either. If I had to place it, I suppose it's spiritually not far off from Aoi Hana or maybe, Sasameki Koto? 

I think Yurirei is smarter than both of those though.

To begin with, Yuna is neither ditzy nor particularly shy. Her mature, reliable personality is the freshest possible gasp of autumn air as a female protagonist. Her quiet confidence is intoxicating, her mannerisms are delightful, and I identify with the way she thinks immensely. She does have some of the cold and withdrawn characteristics that I see more often in male protagonists, such as the famous Tomoya Okazaki, but she is about twice as caring, 10 times smarter, and 100 times as responsible as that guy. Hina is also amazing, even more so as seen through Yuna's eyes. Her blunt cuteness is not some ____dere gimmick, but the main pillar of her personality, and she is, in many ways, just as responsible and intelligent as Yuna herself. 

In fact, in general, these writers seem to revel in introducing certain tropes, then annihilating them. In a low quality story, Aki would really just be an uptight prude that gets ""broken in"" by Youka. Then, their relationship would have no meaning beyond 'opposites attract.' Seina would just be a shy freshman. Tsukuyo would really be an incompetent teacher. Nena would just be a dumb girl that falls asleep all the time. In most stories of this type, I tend to think to myself, ""How are these people so thick and clueless?"" In Yurirei, I am just as likely to think, ""Oh, I didn't realize she'd already thought about it that much."" or ""Whoa, that was quite perceptive.""  

Ah, I fear I may have already spoiled too much. For maximum enjoyment, please go in blind now. 

*ahem*

The focus is on characterization, not panties; this is a story of romance, not sex: the uncertain confession, the embarassed atmosphere, the soft touch on the arm, tension, suspense, and ectasy. Their relationships develop in a way that feels natural, despite the manipulation by Yuna and our resident ghosts. Couples respect each others' boundaries, and they care deeply for each other. They plan their future together. They talk about how their parents or society might perceive them. Unnecessary fanservice is minimal, and even when kinky stuff finally starts happening, the art doesn't zoom in on their boobs, but does a great job of showing their expressions and body language; it is all rather sensual, and, imo, in very very good taste. 

Hence, in case you haven't figured it out yet, if you're buying this just to, uh, yuri your yuri, you're probably going to be extremely disappointed. 

However, if you're a true yuri lover like me (hehe), you will fall in love with this......as I have.",1456055494,1456058078,True,33,2,0.717464745044708252,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The storyline is developed slowly and logically; you can see the characters forming bonds over time very clearly. The characters themselves are very likable and the effort that went into creating them is immense. I enjoyed every second I poured into this game.

For those who are looking for choice-based games, I'm afraid this one won't really serve your needs. There is ultimately only one ending and the choices, however rare as it is, does not influence any of the relationships' outcomes nor the ending itself. However, making the correct combinations of choices will unlock 'extra scenes' after you complete the main story, giving an insight to the characters in short snippets of background events.

First of all, I have played the Japanese version a few years back. The game is fantastic. Probably one of the best takes in VN form on the yuri genre. It's light hearted, often funny and very touching towards the end, ""healing"", and characters are very cute. The things you may criticize in this game are mostly attributable to the development budget. That said, I can't comment on the translation. I assume it will be fine enough. The original text is plain and simple and I assume it remains as readable translated.

Liar soft is one of the VN companies with a more indie feel. It makes very unique and fun games, though not necessarily with the highest production value. You can say it occupies a niche spot in an already niche market.

Often times this is reflected in the fact that there is limited voice acting. That just means mostly the writer was more ambitious than the budget allowed in terms of full voice acting. I would also point out that although the consensus is fully voiced acted VNs are the way to go, partial voice acting allows writing of longer monologues, which some may enjoy. 

Now I was really surprised this game got released on Steam uncensored. The price is high but it's what you would expect for a limited audience release. If you buy this game it may encourage them to make bigger budget works with western release in schedule. When the volume is higher obviously that allows for different pricing schemes.

The stories intervine perfectly and the characters interact naturally with each other. One is able look into each character's head and maybe that's why they are all very likeable, everyone has their own reasonable concerns and worries. In terms of writing and length this may very well be the best visual novel I have read so far in a genre I am quite fond of but end up being disappointed very often.

Sadly the audiovisuals are not on par with the writing and those which other VNs present, I don't mind the mild and pure depiction of what made it unsuitable for all-ages, it's quite fitting actually and just shortly going back to the writing: Those scenes are actually quite meaningful unlike in some many other works.

It's obvious why the audio could be better, way better, while the Voice Actresses are all very good as one might expect, the times there is actually voice acting is very limited.

About the visuals, while not bad at all, it'S just that in comparison the drawing appears crude and the number of sprites is low. I can't really argue about the prior but still I personally prefer it smoother.

Woth mentioning and up to each self to decide is whether they really want a story with real choices and different endings because the choices here are swallow and there is only one ending for all. I really do not mind at all though obviusly it would had been an interesting read if it was possible to end up with other character.

Certainly there is also the point regarding the price but that's again not up to me to decide, all I can is inform you about the fact that I took like 20... or maybe even 30? hours reading it (and like 20h idling, napping or doing something else while Steam was counting an alt-tab'd game) so it seems like a fair value proposition to me at least, as long as it is enjoyable that is and indeed this was the case for me.",1455890558,1455890558,True,2,0,0.450851321220397949,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Sorry it's a little long,,

Pros:
- Very very cute art! A good variety of sprites, expressions, and CGs.
- Catchy and effective OST, with an included “music room” to listen to all the tracks.
- Each character is distinct, has their own background, thoughts, motives, goals, personality, and problems/flaws that are all very relatable, or easy to sympathize with.
- The couples’ stories were all really compelling, and each and every one felt like it had something to offer.
- Some common yuri tropes are addressed and consulted, exposed for their flaws, or given a very human, realistic spin to them.
- While it was nothing mind-blowing, the story was always engaging in some way, and EXTREMELY emotionally investing. I cannot stress enough how invested this game gets you into its interesting and compelling cast of characters, and all their relationships with each other, romantic or otherwise. I cried and burst out laughing and smiled and was on the edge of my seat and relieved and every other emotional a game could make you feel. (well, except for afraid maybe, haha)
- SO. MUCH. EXTRA. CONTENT. AFTER THE MAIN STORY. Hours worth of extra scenes are unlocked based on what choices you pick in the game, so make sure to save at every choice so you can easily unlock them all!
- The sex scenes were all incredibly tender and sweet, with beautiful art in CGs, and none of them felt gross or overly fanservice-y. (though the lack of Super Explicit Content might be a negative for some people)

Cons/stuff to keep in mind:
- Not all the scenes have voice acting. Only major story events, couple events, and scenes that have CGs include voice acting.
- I’m not a fan of a good handful of the voices. Too many of them are shrill and high-pitched, which can be pretty annoying, especially with the characters who are also loud and cheerful on top of that. (I recently found out this might because a LOT of the voice actors are reused for multiple characters)
- Almost ALL the characters have obnoxiously high-pitched and squeaky voice acting during sex scenes.Doesn't ruin it, but it IS off-putting for me.
- The background music doesn't loop; it fades out and then restarts, which can break immersion for some people.
- No agency, and therefore no routes. The main character, Yuna, is entirely her own character, with her own goals and wishes and feelings. So, you can’t change the outcome of situations or the story. YOU the player don’t really have a say, and are only along for the ride. I know that tons of people will be disappointed to know that there are no routes and no agency on their part.
- There’s a couple that’s a teacher and a student. Their relationship lacks the manipulation and toxic power-imbalance that plagues teacher-student sort of relationships, and so I personally was able to find enjoyment in their story, but I know that others might not, so I’m putting this out there now. (note: it is possible to speed through their scenes and arc by selecting the ""Skip unread text"" option in the options menu and then using the skip button)
- Unlocking all the extras can be kind of confusing. Not too hard, but a bit of a pain
- Some of the sex scenes felt out of nowhere, or like they weren't properly lead up to
- The sex scenes are also WAY TOO SHORT. Could've used some more detail in the text and, like… fumbling and exploring and learning.
- Some of the dialogue in the sex scenes was so over-the-top or weirdly put that it was unintentionally funny
- And finally, there's a glitch that me and a friend of mine have, though I haven't heard of anyone else dealing with this yet. About every 15-20 minutes, the game will dramatically slow down and stop progressing, and nothing but closing will fix it. I found a way to slowly save the game and then close from the menu, but it's a bit irritating to pull off. Didn't bother me too bad, but I know it'd be a huge pain for some people. Hopefully this glitch is extremely uncommon.

And finally, some tips:

- SAVE AT EVERY CHOICE. You will need to go back to them to unlock all the extras, and they are WORTH IT.
- NEVER. FORCE CLOSE. THE. GAME. EVER. It'll insist that you haven't completed scenes that you have, and make you redo them just to move on in the story, every time you force close. Always close from the menu.
- If you live with other people, wear headphones. Trust me.

Final thoughts? This game was an absolutely joy to play, especially for its great cast of characters and compelling stories. Absolutely worth the price and more, for me, and I hope others will enjoy the game as much as I did!

All in all, this game has been so much fun (I'd have preferred an all ages version instead but hey whatever, beggars cant be choosers).

Before I start with the good though I thought it might be easier to list the problems with it, because sadly its not perfect.
1. The Voice Acting (VA) - For the most part the casting was spot on, the majority of characters fit well with their VA's however there were at least two cases were the VA's were horribly miss cast. They absolutely don't fit their respective characters. One especially more glaring than the other, and if you've watched as many anime and played as many VN as I have this can be  quite a major sore point.

2. R+18 bits - Considering the premise it had to be done, otherwise the kindred spirits (or yuri-re as they want to be called) wouldn't be able to pass on. That said I believe that the game has massive potential to be a all ages love story that transcends gender boundaries. Simple and sweet. So I genuinely believe its R+18 portions actually hold it back.

And with that over lets move on to the pros.

Story - It's simple, it really is, there is no great drama, no dark mystery, no epic adventure, no grand revenge quest, nothing of that sort. But it works well for pieces like this. As an avid player of visual novels (VN) I've seen quite a myriad genres so, sometimes a nice fun and simple story like this is really just the best. 9/10

Art - As with the story its fairly simple but well drawn, the art is crisp and nice, the character design was well thought out, each character having their own distincts faces and quirks. It's nothing impressive but theres nothing to complain about either. 8/10

Music/BGM - Same with the story it is failry simple, however they fit the mood of each respective story arc really well. Nothing on the level of Two Steps from Hell but then again this isn't that type of game. 8/10

Characters - Easily the best part of the game, I love the characters, ALL of THEM, they've all got their own personalities and quirks as well as distinct visual differences. Can't say much about them without bringing in spoilers but the attention to detail to each one is very pleasing espeically since they have a large cast of characters. And the character design is also well done, each individual is distinct from the other. This is actually impressive as even some highly praised VN's out there fall victim to their characters essentially being hair or skin color swapped versions of each other. 10/10

Gameplay - The format this VN uses is actually quite uniqe and refreshing and it also gets rid of the annoying repetitve nature of most other VN's when your chasing diffrent character arcs. It however means that replayability will sadly be non-existent save for reminesence. So it remains to be seen wether this is a good or bad idea. 8/10

Enjoyment - I love Yuri VN's and its a damn shame more aren't in the english market. This was a nice change of pace however so it comes highly recomended. 10/10

Overall - The Pros heavily , HEAVILY, outwiegh the cons so... 8.83/10

TL;DR: I highly recommend this game to anyone who isn't averse to the genre (VN's or Yuri).

If you're just curious and think that the price is too high(it isn't, the price is very average for a standard medium-long VN, but people who don't usually buy them are still not used to this), then wait until the price drops a little and get it ASAP.

Why am I saying this? Because the story and the characters are all very endearing, and it doesn't feel like you're reading something boring and dull, mostly thanks to characters that aren't your average cookie cutter archetypes, and this also reflects on their relationships.

我galgame玩过一些，但是百合作品除了这个只玩过花吻系列。
这个游戏号称是18禁无删减登录steam，但是其实其中的那些画面属于比较唯美的那种，裸露的不多，足以让人血脉喷张但是xx不起来，实用性不高，真要xx不如去e绅士或者玩花吻系列，虽然我个人不太喜欢花吻那种没事来一发的感觉。
游戏剧情很清水，沉重的压抑的内容比较少，有一种淡淡的感觉，蛮有生活感，跟游戏软软的立绘画风以及调皮欢快的BGM很搭。是一款非常棒的轻松向百合galgame。

      特别值得一提的是这款游戏的模式设定成了日记或者说按时间排列的方式，把一整段剧情以一个个小故事的形式排列在一起，这是和大多数同类游戏不同的地方。当然还有一个地方也值得一说，那就是这款游戏的选择项并不会影响游戏的结局，游戏的结局是固定的。选择项只会影响最后100%通关的CG收集，多的 就不说了，以免剧透。

Kindred Spirits on the Roof - неплохая новеллка с простеньким сюжетом, интересной манерой повествования и годной главной героиней.
Пускай где-то и навели шуму про 18+ анкат и прочее - тут это не играет особой роли, разве что придаёт момент завершённости каждой паре.

Читается интересно, ибо с местной манерой повествование наблюдение за событиями приобретает немного больший смысл, чем просто ""слежка"". Сюжет, правда, чисто линейный и местный выбор лишь меняет пару диалогов да бывает открывает экстра сценарий по прохождению игры, однако каждый сюжетный день всегда можно переиграть и выбрать другой вариант ответа.

Если вы очень в вещи аля девичья любовь и прочие штуки - стоит взять. Тут в этом плане всё жутко милотно и отлично подано.
Если вам просто хочется почитать более-менее интересноты ради убить время - тоже можно взять.

Шутки про гомофобов в сторону.

Лично мне не понравилось лишь типичные анимешные оверхайпнутые стоны в время постельных сцен, ну да это типично. Сами сцены весьма забавны и проходят аля ""первый опыт"" или ""я нифига не понимаю, что я делаю, но я делаю"".
Также незалупленая музыка. Даа, это немного раздражает. И каждая мелодия вместо того, чтобы крутиться на заднике когда надо, затихает, а потом начинается заного.
Ну и ещё одна пара всё же не шибко интересна мне была.

По сути 8/10, если стараться быть объективным с моим небольшим опытом в плане ВН и моему большому интересу к юри-подобным вещам.

画面：作为visual novel，精致的立绘,各式各样或纯情或风骚或坚强或傲娇的美丽妹子（汉子）一直是最大的卖点，多少宅男宅女为了自己喜欢的角色的一个cg就能耗费一个晚上，在无尽的想象中挥洒着自己的青春与体力。而百合灵的画面在如今已发展的相当成熟的galgame里并不算出众，也许是作为一款百合向作品，百合灵的画面清新有余但总给人一种有些简陋的感觉，尤其在人物细节上，我认为还有很大提升空间。

音效：作为一款售价打折后仍高达85元的作品，我认为百合灵的音效做的可以说很糟糕，乐曲单调不说，很多时候连基本的烘托氛围的效果都没有起到，过场衔接效果有时也很不到位，我知道制作人很喜欢主题曲以及听妹子啦啦啦，但也请考虑玩家的游戏体验。。。

操作：不多说了，galgame你懂得

剧情：虽然开场有些老套，但剧情往后发展渐入佳境，人物设定一开始感觉有些失败但后来感觉也饱满了起来，[spoiler]总的来说就是一对幽灵百合帮助女校妹子们恋爱的故事[/spoiler]，总之一句话，有百合还不够吗？

总的来说，我认为百合灵的画面有待提高，音效也对不起它85的价格以及高达800m+的容量。喜欢这种题材的朋友建议等更大幅度的折扣入手。一直喜欢百合，一方面感觉很唯美，另外一方面百合相对来说少了一些荷尔蒙与性激素的相对纯真的感情也十分引人。也希望制作人能够再接再厉，继续推出优良的作品，展现出百合的唯美真挚。虽然本作我认为还存在种种不足，但我还是给出好评，毕竟百合无限好，虽然生不了。",1455637400,1455637587,True,12,0,0.5974387526512146,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Was the wait worth it?

Hell yes.

As another reviewer has mentioned, this story does have a very porny premise.  Two ghosts rope MC into playing yuri cupid for various couples in the school so that the ghosts can spy on them and learn how to make love to each other, as girls—yes, this is morally questionable no matter how you word it—but despite this, the story is not centered around sex at all.  Really.  It took me around 12 hours to reach the first nsfw scene, and all the way up those 12 hours, the story focuses on developing relationships, emotional connections, friendship.  Rather than sex being the focal point of the game, it feels very much like a beautiful culmination to everything that couple has experienced together up to that point—from the confessions, to the trials and tribulations of trying get their love reciprocated, their sense of stability after ironing out misunderstandings.

Also, while the whole “b-but we’re both girls!” may seem excessive at some points, homosexuality in Japan is still very much condemned.  But that’s one of the most refreshing things about this game: not only does the story touch upon real issues like social stigma and family expectations, but it also doesn’t write off the girl/girl romances as just a phase, like so many other works in yuri genre do.  One couple in particular discusses and plans their future together in the face of a homophobic society, and that really resonated with me.

As someone who has also tried out the Sono Hanabira series, which oversexualizes girls (and even glosses over the fact that one of them is a huge age gap student/teacher lol), I am very happy that this game doesn’t treat homosexuality as a joke or something just to fetishize.  I really felt like the story was reaching out to girls in similar situations, living in fear of condemnation yet still brave enough to face their feelings and look forward to a brighter future.

Setting aside my accolades for the story, the voice acting, art, and music are also superb.  The nsfw scenes are very tasteful, and despite the fact that the OST is about 12/13 tracks, the songs are catchy enough that I never felt bothered by it.

I saw this mentioned the week or so leading up to the game by a few people and I decided to give it a try since they had a demo avaliable. I'm extremely glad I did because this ended up being one of the best visual novels I've read, with wonderful characters and an emotinal plot. Though the game is rated 18+ and does contain sex scenes it's quite tame overall, and really doesn't even factor in until around halfway through the game. I was also surprised how the game tackles the subject of relationships, it doesn't pretend that they happen overnight or without some stumbling blocks. I mean the story is still pretty fluffly overall (it's about lesbian ghosts that wanna spread the lesbian around a school, c'mon) but I still think it took the romances realistically for the most part.

-A great main character, Yuna was delightful throughout. Almost all of the characters (barring one or two minor examples) are well written
-Emotionally engaging story, I'll admit I teared up quite a few times
-Satisfying ending
-Extra scenes that open up once you complete the main story
-OST is good, even if there are only about 12 tracks.
-Game takes relationships surprisingly seriously.

Cons:
-Some of the couples are just not as interesting as others, and the game makes you follow every side story
-Title is kinda weird. I read why it's that way but it's still weird.
-There ain't much porn if that's what you're here for.

Nit-Picks:
-I wish there had been just a bit more drama. I love the story but half the time the main character is just sitting around waiting for stuff to happen
-While the extra scenes after the main story were a nice touch, they were kind of pointless overall, to be blunt. While it did flesh out the relationships between some characters a bit more, they didn't do much for me. I'd have much preferred it if they'd given each of the couples a ""one month later"" epilogue or something
-Some of those songs in the OST, while good, might get annoying once they play for the 50th time
-I wish the game was longer. Though this should probably be a pro, I think this is one of the best compliments you can give a game. I wish there was a sequel, anime, something,
-By the way, if these ghosts wanted to see girls doing it, they DO have the internet. Feels like they could've solved this problem in 10 minutes. (I know not really, but still)

Overall the game was a delight to play, and I hope more similar games come soon. I don't usually replay visual novels, but I get the feeling I'm probably going to replay this one in the upcoming weeks. If I was giving this game a rating I'd say it's a 9/10",1455507609,1455600009,True,74,3,0.799415111541748047,1,True,False,False,False,,,

After playing, A Kiss for Petals - Remembering You, I really needed a new Yuri/Shoujo-Ai game to play and this filled that slot perfectly.

This is also the first uncensored visual novel on steam; however, the story does not center itself around this concept, but on the interesting interactions between the characters themseles. The scenes themselves are actually quite tastefull and fit with the game's character driven storyline.

Kindred Spirits on the roof is an innovative and refreshing take on the visual novel genre; therefore, I would recomend anyone buying this game to both be preprared for and understand what type of game it actually is.

You play as a slightly anti-social girl who, while eating alone on the roof, discovers two ghosts and is then draged into playing match-maker for a variety of different yuri couples.

The purpose of the game is to create a Yuritopia!

What else do you need to know about it to XD

As of this moment, I have completely cleared Kindred Spirits on the Roof XD

The only real problem that I had with the game was the fact that steam overlay does not work and therefore I could not take recordings or screenshots; however, despite this the game was so good that I ended up losing a few days sleep.

Despite having only one ending, the game has a massive amount of extra content after the initial storyline ends. Extra content is garnered by choosing different dialogue options when they are presented towards you; however, as previously mentioned, the game only has one ending so your choices do not actually affect the main game.

On the subject of characters, I was actually quite suprised by quite a few characters in this game as well as how my opinions on them shifted later on. There were about two or three characters I just did not connect with, but there were also quite a few a characters that I initialy disliked who ended up being some of my favorites. I actually wish that a few of these characters had gotten a bit more time spent on them, but there is always the possibility of a sequel....maybe.

The art style was about mid-range for me, but it was a lot better than I was expecting and actually complimented the game's other elements quite well.

The ending, which I will not spoil, brought everything to a close quite well.

Overall this was quite a great game and I would deffinitly recommend it to those who enjoy yuri and/or visual novels.",1455475202,1456715433,True,4,0,0.531703650951385498,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In other words, I've already read it. Niche titles like this need all the support they can get after all, so if this VN even slightly interests you, I'd say go for it. (Guess I'm already showing my bias huh?)

 屋上の百合霊さん, officially translated to Kindred Spirits on the Roof, is a Visual Novel about love. Girls love, to be more precise. The protagonist of our story is Toomi Yuna, a student of Kokonotsuboshi Girls Academy of Commerce. The plot sets in motion when she encounters the ghost of two since long deceased girls who happened to fall in love with each other in the afterlife. These girls wish to experience their ”first time” together, only problem is, they're just not sure exactly how to do it. Which is why they request for our protagonist to create a ”Yuritopia” at the school, by helping girls struggling with their feelings. For those not so versed in weeb vocab: They're basically asking her to make the school into a lesbian paradise.

 And that's more or less it. I realize it sounds kinda dumb when I put it like that, but stick with me! What I described in the above paragraph might sound like some generic setup for some kind of porno or whatever, but be aware, this VN is not quite that. With the western VN market being such that it is, it's inevitable that it would at a glance be grouped with the likes of Nekopara or Sakura Beach etc. But I repeat, this is not the case. Kindred Spirits is not aimed at your usual western VN or Eroge demographic. If anything, Kindred Spirit panders more to the female readers than the male ones. The exclusion of the male gaze being one such contributing factor. Yes, there are sex-scenes, but then again, their focus and implementation relies more on the romantic aspects than the sexual ones. Not that I'm implying that men are inherently more sexual than women or vice versa. My point is merely this: the sex scenes are there not so you can get your rocks off, but as a means to bookend the relationship you helped come to bloom. To put it in another way: it is more beautiful than sexy, and cute rather than titillating. This is something that I feel needs to be brought to light, if just to ever so slightly elevate some of the prejudice plaguing this VN (or genre as a whole). And this is not to say that there is anything wrong with enjoying those kind of works, but merely to showcase how this game is different. 

 Bottom line is that this VN is not offensive. It takes a concept that could easily make 100 times the profit by being a straight up Nukige, or self-insert Eroge, and instead makes something endearing and romantic out of it. That is at least commendable, if nothing else.

 But enough of that. Is the story itself any good? Is there any gameplay? Well, the story itself is nothing complicated at all (which you could probably infer from the synopsis alone), but nor does it try to be. It is simply a story about love. It just so happens to be between girls this time. It is both cute, charming and funny as hell at times. It is a straightforward love story, without much depth, twists or deeper meaning. If you're feeling up for some HNNNG's then this is the story for you.

 The gameplay is not much to speak of to be honest, since the story is mostly linear. You won't have any bad endings or failed routes. Which also means that you won't alter the story overly much with your inputs, but rather reading a story. There's no fail state, game over, or dead ends, only love～. There are a couple of extra scenes and dialogue, but that's about it. The game time is somewhere between 10-30 hours. It is in other words, a relatively short to medium long-ish length VN depending on your reading speed. What I have seen of the translation so far is that it is not only up to par, but actually very good and genuine. It goes without saying that this is as good as it gets as an English reader.

TL;DR: If you are looking for a romance heavy Visual Novel without having to self-insert as a faceless protagonist to sex up some underage girls, this is probably as good as it gets. If you don't mind, or even prefer GL over vanilla,  then this is no doubt as good as it gets no matter your other preferences. If you're looking for porn/fanservice, or something to get your rocks off, you should probably look elsewhere. The same goes for those wanting a dark, mature or deep story of any kind. What you're paying for is a cute, well-written and funny love story that I urge you not to miss.

 Anyways, those are my poorly written, hastily put together thoughts on this particular VN. Check it out I'd say. It's good. Ignore the usual prejudices, but at the same time, know what it is you're paying for when you buy it. I might come back to edit the review if it would prove necessary, but I'll get to that when I get to that.

Spoiler-tags are used liberally, and I'm not going to bring any big spoilers into the review whatsoever--I want you to experience the game on your own!

[h1]The demo is free from MangaGamer, and is roughly 2 hours in length.[/h1]
Really, just try it.

[h1]This isn't a nukige.[/h1]
Nukige being defined as a game where the plot only exists as a vehicle for sex. If you're looking for graphic content, this is probably not the game for you.
Spoiler includes the length of time before reaching the first 'erotic' scene:[spoiler]15 hours[/spoiler]

[h1]The game has partial Voice-Acting[/h1]
How partial? Well... about a fifth. From my estimation (not looking at raw files, but simply from my experience playing the game...) it seems to be somewhere around five to six hours of voice acting. That's more than any single season of anime will have, anyway. All of the funniest, most exciting, or most painful moments are acted--it is a slight disappointment that it all isn't, but, they made sure they got the most out of the performances, and they are well-done.

[h1]This game has a full SoundTrack.[/h1]
They're somewhat modest about mentioning it, but there are over a dozen tracks, not including the opening and ending. Their usage and application in each and every scene are great and help reinforce the writing and bring it to it's fullest emotional potential. Some of the tracks you WILL connect to emotionally by the end.

[h1]The game has roughly 25 hours of content.[/h1]
There's more details about this throughout my review, but, putting it here as well. After getting the 100% completion, I had spent 26 hours myself.

[h1]This is mostly a kinetic novel.[/h1]
There are some choices to be made, and some alternate scenes and dialogues to be had, but you're mostly along for the ride. There is some non-linear experience, and plenty of perspective changes, but the story is pretty much set. There might be an alternate ending--I don't know yet though, and its definitely something you should experience for yourself! Gameplay is mostly just taking the story at your own pace, and choosing what parts you want to see first.




I played the demo before playing this game--it's available from the developer's website and is roughly 2 hours in length (at least, for my reading/emotional engagement speed)

I played the game immediately upon release from the developer's website, some many hours before the official Steam release. I slept around 4 hours after making it through a decent bit, and then finished it. I imported my save into the Steam version by simply copy+pasting the save directory.

I spent 19 hours playing through the main scenario after speeding through the identical demo scenes, leaving me with a 21 hour playtime. After completing the main scenario, extra scenes were interspersed throughout--a large amount, actually. I would estimate at roughly a quarter of the main scenario in length--you're getting closer to [u][b]30 hours than 20 with this game[/b][/u], at my speed. 

EDIT2: I finished all of the extra scenarios. They are VERY numerous (78 in all!) and well written and fill in every gap. It took me an additional 5 hours to read them all, so that raises my time spent to 26 hours before full clearing the game. And even if the main scenario is over, the extra scenes are VERY much worth your time.


!!NOTE!! This review is a work in progress. This concludes my fact-based guide. I will be updating this review with my full thoughts on the game shortly. It'll be pretty long, so I'm writing a TL;DR (even though you can't read it yet...)

TL;DR: This game is an amazing piece of media, of fiction, of art. Of love, of what love is, and the hardships that come with love... well-written characters that are engaging, genuinely funny jokes and seamless localization.

If you're a fan, you'll be pleased to know that popular voice actors from the Steampunk series return to fill out the cast. Sakurai Hikaru (also of Gakkou Gurashi, Fate/Prototype fame) returns as an assistant writer and Kawashima Rino (from Dies irae and Shikkoku no Sharnoth) voices the protagonist, Toomi Yuna.

Colorful characters - all fulfilling certain yuri tropes - are present, as well as a bubbly OST and mostly on-point translation. You'll find little bits of ""Westernization"" here and there, but nothing that'll really disrupt the dialogue. Decently long... and watch out for mood whiplash!

There's the issue of a high price point, but maybe you'll be willing to forgive that for the sake of R-18 nudity.

Go far away from here. However, if you are indeed a lonely manchild, you might want to check this one out. It's got nice visuals, and pretty good music. It's also about helping lesbians hook up. There's really no more depth to it than that. I'm not going to lie to you and write some review about how the story is miles beyond the teenage wet dreams you'd find on a fan fiction website. This is a game just like how Fifty Shades of Grey deserved to be  a New York Times best seller, but even that found its market in sad middle-aged mothers. Basically, just know your taste in games and you won't disappointed when you do/don't decide to purchase this game.
