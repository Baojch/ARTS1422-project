Вы управляете ""кораблём"" и должны зачищать комнаты, чтобы получить награды
Помимо здоровья, есть различные модификации - повышают скорость стрельбы, дают атакам возможности рикошета или пронзания, дают кораблю щиты, меняют вид атак на лазер, либо позволяют стрелять 2+ снарядами одновременно, а то и вовсе дают снарядам самонаведение, есть же и модификации, которые создают дополнительных помощников
И комбинировать модификации можно любым удобным образом
Ограничивает игрока только возможность носить лишь 3 модификации, а если хочется больше, то найдя специальную панель можно освободить 1 слот, сделав модификацию постоянной

С каждым уровнем будет появляться всё больше комнат и врагов, и в конце игрока ожидает финальный босс...
Вот только прохождение игры не является концом, ведь это только откроет первый игровой модификатор
Модификаторы делают игру более случайной и сложной (один просто повышает скорость игры, другой снижает максимальное здоровье корабля, другой снижает вероятность появления лечилок, а какой-то даёт шанс, что в зачищенной комнате вновь появится волна противников...)
Опять же все модификаторы можно активировать одновременно, и это повысит как сложность, так и очки, получаемые во время прохождения (увы, сейчас не эпоха ""highscore"", но для некоторых игроков это может стать вызовом или же просто забавным весельем в компании)

Otra cosa que me gustaría recalcar es que como las maquinas y mejoras aparecen al azar por lo que eso obliga a improvisar un poco y fuerza a probar diferentes combinaciones dependiendo de lo que le juego te arroje y tratar de obtener y mejorar las piezas que combinen mejor.

Me gustaría que se pudiera seleccionar que los enemigos estuvieran marcados de otro color para facilitar no chocar con ellos, pero en general me gusto bastante para un rato, aunque dudo probar dificultades mayores.

Each game tends to be pretty short. Maybe 20 minutes to get through the whole thing. For me the fun is seeing what upgrade paths I can take and what the different weapons do maxed out and what combinations of weapons do what. 

Rockets provide explosive damage areas, lasers give instant attacks while rockets + lasers combine both. Nanobots create swarms of little dots randomly when you kill things that then go on to attack other enemies. 

Other upgrades include multi-shot, homing shot, shields, damage, piercing (allows bullets to travel through enemies and damage all enemies in path). Upgrading to multi-shot, homing, and damage will slow your weapon's fire rate but thankfully there are fire rate upgrades to be found and upgraded to balance this out.

Thank you for the kind review, glad you're having fun and like the game! 

As for the bug, are you by chance playing on a keyboard? If so, you are experiencing a hardware phenomena known as ""ghosting"", in which multiple key presses will cancel each other out and not register on your machine. This can be remedied by purchasing an ""anti-ghosting"" keyboard or by using a controller such as an Xbox or Playstation controller if you have one. 

If you aren't on a keyboard, then after tens of thousands of collective player hours you are the first to experience this bug! The odds seem likely the issue is with your setup somewhere. Again, likely the keyboard/controller or perhaps some additional software on your system. I hope this helps fix your issue!

- Alex (Optical Override)"

Я так и не смог пройти все модификаторы на первой странице... И часы наигранные реальны, хотя обычно я сплю на клаве. Тут нечего описывать особо, в такое нужно играть самому.

There's exactly one thing that isn't particularly clear in the game (Nanobots). [b]One.[/b] Everything else you'll just about figure out within 4 seconds of having it or getting shot at by it. The classic ""one enemy does one thing"" holds here, and there aren't any ""go run around shooting every wall"" type of obscure hidden things.

It's pretty short and gets repetitive, but it's definitely worth the asking price. Tight controls, escalating gameplay, and just enough variety of gear to make you think a little about what you take and when - but only a little. Soundtrack is pretty solid, worth a buy imo... if it was here.
EDIT: It's on Bandcamp, 7 bucks but the tracks are trimmed to perfectly loop out of the gate. Looping them yourself isn't exactly super hard normally, but one less step is one less step.


TL:DR (Really?) - A quick-play twin stick that doesn't overstay its welcome. Use KB for nostalgia. If the game ignoring mouse bothers you that much, wait for a sale or buy a controller.

If what you see in the trailers looks like something you would enjoy, buy it. If it doesn't, don't (or wait for a sale). There aren't any big secrets.",1618637613,1618771523,True,2,0,0.546827793121337891,0,True,False,False,False,,,

If you're looking to increase the game's difficulty there's a few options available.

You can also unlock and enable Hell Mode which again increases the difficulty significantly. If the difficulty is still not enough, you can combine all 12 Modifiers with Hell Mode... which I don't advise but I'll leave that up to you.

20 HRS L8R: Yeah, it gets much harder. The upgrades are versatile and extremely random, but the game play doesn't vary too much.

My favorite has to be the multi-shot and the homing upgrade, since you need to sacrifice one of your max HP to equip it. 

The general gameplay of shooting and moving feels very smooth. I quite like the cover that is in nearly every room you go into. Certain upgrades work cleverly with the walls by being able to hit behind cover with the rocket shot or shooting at the cover to angle your shots with the ricochet upgrade. 

This is an arcade style game, so one of the main draws is to get a high score, which appeals to me a lot. The in-game high score list is even shown in an arcade cabinet fashion which ties it all together. 

You can unlock modifiers to add to the game and increase your score once you beat it the first time, and once you unlock 5 modifiers you unlock hell mode. Hell mode ramps up the difficuluty significantly, enemies move much faster, have different attack patterns, and bullets move faster as well.

On the surface, Null Vector is a simple dual-stick shooter, but dig a little deeper and there's so much more. The gameplay is smooth and very well balanced, the retro soundtrack and visuals make for an exciting experience, and the unforgiving enemy AI is just difficult enough to give you a challenge without making the game impossible. And with all the crazy modifiers, as well as Hell Mode, you are sure to have a good challenge no matter your skill level. 

During a battle, you are focused solely on survival and defeating the enemies, but between rooms, there is a lot of strategy that goes into how you build up your ship. Since all the rooms, ship parts, and the machines that appear to help you are procedurally generated, you can never be sure what your final setup is going to be like. This encourages different styles of play, even within a game session. Finding the right balance between offensive and defensive power is key, and changing your strategy as you find new parts during a run is sometimes a necessity. 

Local co-op is also available, but it's not just about a second player with a second ship. Player 2 supports player 1 as a special helper bot, which can't be permanently killed but must respawn if hit only once. There are certain abilities and items that only player 2 can use, and it makes for a very interesting and fun co-op experience.

Blast through hordes with Multi-Shot and Piercing, bring death around corners with Laser and Ricochet, spray AoE with Rocket and Fire Rate, or team up on your foes with all kinds of Bot minions. Learn to make good use of the machines scattered around the level, consider to what extent you can spend your crystals and take every option you have into account. Soon enough you'll be carefully counting how many spare HP cubes are scattered around the level in order to exchange some of your current life for more money, which you'll use to upgrade a part, solder another one, and be able to equip that new one you found. 
While it may seem repetitive at a glance, if you don't explore all the options it gives you, I can say with confidence that it absolutely isn't. There's quite a bit of depth thanks to the great amount of combinations, strategies and ways of playing, and where it lacks in more enemy and zone variety, it makes up with the varied ways to face those enemies and obstacles. It may not have hundreds of hours of replayability, but it has dozens, considering the additional difficulty modifiers and ""Hell Mode"" you unlock as you play.
The music is quite wonderful, moreso if you're a fan of the new-retro or retrowave genre. The sound effects are clear, simple and serviceable, and none of them is unpleasant to the ears. The graphics are charming: simple but elegant, and reminiscent of the old vector-based games. The only drawback is that it can get a little messy when you combine the many many projectiles, effects and visuals that can potentially be happening at once depending on a lot of circumstances. Still, that only happens rarely, and most of the time the minimalistic artstyle makes visibility good even in chaotic moments that would be much harder to follow on other similar games. 
The game is really well polished and balanced: the dev has been very mindful of these aspects since it launched in Early Access, and I can say confidently that, unlike many other titles, this release version actually feels finished and well made. 
All in all, if it piques your interest and you're a fan of either roguelikes, top-down shooters, or the general arcade-ish vibe it has, pick it up and give it a try. I was lucky enough to get it for free while it was given away on its Early Access period, but I'd pay the 4,99€ it's priced at without a shadow of a doubt.",1528125786,1528125786,True,2,0,0,0,False,True,False,False,,,

OCENA: POZYTYWNA
Gra jest malutka lecz zapewnia nieco więcej zabawy niż mogłoby się wydawać. Poziom trudności jest dosyć zbalansowany choć w późniejszych poziomach pojawiają się trochę mocniejsi przeciwnicy, którzy dążą do kolizji z nami i to oni będą największym wyzwaniem. Gra w sam raz na kilka dni rozgrywki.

[list][h1]+++ PLUSY +++[/h1]
[*]Wciągająca rozgrywka.
[*]Grafika retro przypominająca pierwsze gry.
[*]Wpadająca w ucho ścieżka dźwiękowa.[/list]


[list][h1]— MINUSY —[/h1]
[*]„Fabryki” da się użyć niechcący klikając odpowiedni przycisk nim pojawi się jej opis.
[*]Z czasem gra się znudzi.[/list]


[h1]=== WSTĘP ===[/h1]
Null vector to zręcznościówka wzorowana na starych automatach czy też po prostu grach starego typu gdy rozgrywka była przedstawiona w postaci trójwymiarowego środowiska „3D Polyline”. Tak i tu widzimy wszystko zbudowane z lini oraz figur geometrycznych. Całość prezentuje się dosyć ciekawie. Gra została stworzona przez jedną osobę.


[h1]=== OPRAWA GRAFICZNA I DŹWIĘKOWA ===[/h1]
Gra to środowisko trójwymiarowe jednak oparte o technologię 3D Polyline gdzie widzimy jedynie zarysy obiektów w postaci linii składających się na ich kontury (+czasami wypełnione kolorami powierzchnie). Daje to ciekawy efekt przypominający swoim wyglądem pierwsze produkcje. Rozgrywka na żywo nie oddaje wyglądu gry ze zrzutów ekranu.

Dźwiękowo też w porządku. Naszym akcjom towarzyszą piskliwe odgłosy strzelania i wybuchów pojazdów przeciwników zaś w tle przygrywa nastrojowa muzyka.


[h1]=== ROZGRYWKA ===[/h1]
Gra zabiera nas do rozgrywki znanej z automatów, które stały dawno temu w salonach gier i które przyciągały rzeszę dzieciaków kradnąc ich kieszonowe… Swoim wyglądem przypomina produkcje wektorowe rodem z komputerów 8-bit. Nie dysponowały one odpowiednią mocą obliczeniową by nałożyć tekstury tak więc prezentowały trójwymiarowe środowisko w postaci figur geometryczych wypełnionych kolorem lub też gradientem… lub też po prostu samą siatkę (wireframe). Wbrew przeświadczeniom było to czytelne i pozwalało graczowi na pierwsze doświadczenia w pojmowaniu głębi środowiska gry.

Jak to wygląda? Siadamy do wnętrza pojazdu, który ma za zadanie eksterminować kolejne levele pełne przeciwników. Możemy nim poruszać się w lewo prawo w górę i dół i rzecz jasna możemy strzelać celem eliminacji napotkanych wrogów. Wraz z przeszukiwaniem kolejnych pomieszczeń odnaleźć możemy broń czy też ulepszenia, które możemy zainstalować w naszym pojeździe. Prócz tego odnajdujemy czasami także punkty życia czy też kryształy pełniąca walutę gry. W większości przypadków po wyeliminowaniu przeciwników w danym pomieszczeniu pojawia się mały niby-sklepik który może mieć różne funkcje takie jak zakup kolejnych modułów, ulepszenia już posiadanych czy też funkcję ich usuwania. prócz tego może także dawać możliwość zakupu punktów życia, kryształów bądź też pozwalać na wymianę jednych na drugie.

Same pomieszczenia mogą być ślepą odnogą bądź też prowadzić do kolejnych. Ich układ widać po przyzwaniu ekranu mapy (klawisz „M”). W jednym z nich znajdziesz zielony podest prowadzący na następny poziom (których jest 6). Nie trzeba zwiedzać wszystkich pomieszczeń na danym levelu, który by móc go opuścić aczkolwiek wskazane jest wszystko przeszperać ponieważ możemy odnaleźć ciekawe rzeczy w postaci ulepszeń czy też pozyskać więcej punktów zdrowia lub kryształów.


[h1]=== POMIESZCZENIA ===[/h1]
Połączenia pomiędzy pomieszczeniami przedstawione są w postaci podestów umiejscowionych na środku długości ścianki. Te w których jeszcze nas nie było mają przeważnie oznaczenie w postaci cyfry czy też różnych symboli. Cyfra oznacza ilość fal przeciwników do pokonania zaś symbole specjalne przeznaczenie pokoju. I tak „T” oznacza pomieszczenie w którym znajdziemy rzeczy do pozyskania, „B” mini bossa do pokonania, „C” salę zadań. Jakie mogą być zlecone nam zadania? Różne, np. przetrwaj atak 11 przeciwników bądź zbierz 7 przedmiotów, utrzymaj pola (na planszy pojawia się zielony obszar w którym musimy przebywać wystarczająco długo) itp.
Mini Boss to inna śpiewka. Jest to nieco mocniejszy przeciwnik więc musisz być przygotowany do cięższego starcia. Ten dla przykładu prócz samego strzelania może mieć utrudnienie – co jakiś czas większość planszy przyjmuje kolor czerwony na który spadają dodatkowe pociski – jeśli na nich pozostaniesz odniesiesz obrażenia.

Trzeba też pamiętać, iż jeśli wejdziemy do pomieszczenia z przeciwnikami to nie opuścimy go dopóki wszystkich nie wyeliminujemy. Liczba przed wejściem do pokoju oznacza ilość fal, które musimy pokonać. Po eliminacji jednej grupy z chwilą usunięcia ostatniego z wrogów pojawi się ich kolejna grupa do zniszczenia. Proces ich respawnu trwa około sekundy-dwóch więc pasowałoby oddalić się z tego miejsca byśmy nie pojawili się w środku zgrupowania agresorów.


[h1]=== PRZECIWNICY ===[/h1]
Naprzeciw nam staną różne typy przeciwników. Oczywiście im wyższy poziom tym trudniejszych należy się spodziewać – będą szybsi, wytrzymalsi i dysponować będą innym rodzajem uzbrojenia. Z czasem poznasz ich po wyglądzie (dany ich typ posiada stałe umiejętności i rodzaj używanej broni). Zdarzają się także przeciwnicy, którzy będą chcieć nas staranować i to właśnie oni będą stanowić dla nas największe wyzwanie w późniejszej części gry. Szczególnie dlatego, że będą wyjątkowo szybcy, zwrotni i będą posiadać mocną konstrukcję by móc ubić ich nim do nas dotrą. Tu już trzeba będzie się nieco napocić by zniszczyć ich nim w nas uderzą.


[h1]=== TAKTYKA WALKI ===[/h1]
Większość pomieszczeń posiada przeszkody za którymi można się schować. Trzeba jednak uważać gdy pojawia się nowa fala wrogów ponieważ zawsze istnieje ryzyko, iż nieopodal zrespawnuje się przeciwnik, który przemieści się właśnie w naszym kierunku. Miejsca w rogach ekranu przy przeszkodach nie ma za wiele a jednym strzałem go raczej nie wyeliminujemy.

Шутер выполнен довольно в простеньком стиле. Естественно, если ты делаешь игру в очень простом стиле её обязательно нужно приписывать к жанру олдскул, хотя эта игра ему немного не соответствует. Нам предстоит управлять геометрической фигурой ввиде треугольника, отстреливаться от врагов и решать очень простенькие задачки. Эта фигура что-то вроде корабля, который мы можем по ходу игры усиливать различными модулями и улучшать оружие. Игра случайным образом генерирует несколько комнат на уровне и предлагает вам найти в одной из них выход на следующий сектор. Всего у вас по умолчанию 4 единицы энергии, но есть возможность в некоторых комнатах осуществлять покупки в специальных автоматах. Можно купить разного рода усиления, ботов помощников и энергию.

Уровни довольно разнообразные, при входе в комнату она блокируется до тех пор пока не будут выполнены условия. Они могут быть разные, начиная от банальных – убить всех противников, и заканчивая сложными, к примеру, простоять на платформе определённое количество времени, враги при этом постоянно воскрешаются. В некоторых комнатах без усилений очень сложно, иногда так много врагов что трудно осмыслить происходящее на экране. Через 30 минут игры кажется всё совершенно однотипным, теряется интерес к игре. 

Игра хардкорная, но совсем не весёлая и не интересная. Цена на неё сильно завышена. Есть куда более интересные представители данного жанра с приятной графикой и доступной ценой.

At the cost of less than a Whopper value meal, one should not expect a Ruth’s Chris steak. Accordingly, approach Null Vector similar expectations in scale. If its purpose is to appeal to those who hold nostalgia in high regard, then I would consider this retro shooter a positive outcome.

However I do believe that Null Vector is still missing one thing to make the transition to that of a 80s genre arcade game! And that would be the continue or credits option that allowed for one to play more. While that is just my two cents or take on this game, I would totally suggest you get out there and try this one no matter your age as it will take you back to a time when games had no bells or whistles, just great challenges.

- Not an enjoyable two player experience
- Disparity in trailer graphics vs. actual graphics

Overall: 2/5; needs improvement.

I am not a picky gamer. I genuinely could enjoy a poorly drawn flash game as long as you make the instructions clear. However, that is exactly what Null Vector fails to do. Despite its beautiful, 80's retro art and music it fails to deliver clear instructions and gameplay information. There's no details about the items themselves (all I know is that the weapon is a ""rocket"" or this item is ""piercing."" Okay...what does piercing do? How effective is the rocket?) nor is there information about what gameplay concepts mean like {C} or {T}. A lot of my gameplay with my friend was just guessing. We ran around hoping to figure it out- that maybe there was a module to explain it all. Alas, there was not.

Two player also made no sense. Why did it only have ONE health bar, which related to player one? Where's player two's hp? From me and my friend's understanding, player two had one HP and respawned while player one didn't get a chance to. It makes player two's role almost irrelevant...he can die as many times as he wants while I just have to stay alive. Not only that, there was no menu/HUD for him either. He just aimlessly picked up items when he could. He didn't know what was in his loadout, he just picked up whatever. It ruined the gaming experience because player two had little to no interaction with the gameplay, while I did all the work. It felt like working on a middle school group project all over again. Player one was that one kid who did all the work while player two sometimes glued the papers to the poster board.

Additionally, there's a huge disparity in how the graphics look VS. the trailer/images. On the trailer, the lines are crisp. However, in game, the lines are glowing and blurred. It might just be because I was on the highest settings. But shouldn't the highest settings reflect the trailer? While the colors were great along with the art, the colors did not go well with the glowing. It led to me having eye strain, headaches, and incredible irritation with the game. The colors weren't distinct enough to differentiate between player two and some enemy units!

Overall, I was disappointed by this game. While I am thankful for the developer providing this game, it really did not live up to my standards. I hope for improvements--I'll be following this game.

There is just so much good stuff happening here!

( I got an early press-release copy of the full release version, so my review will reflect this ) 

The graphical style is simplistic, and effective. VHS style aesthetics, mixed with retro 80's arcade cabinet feel.
 You even start the game with a literal arcade cabinet that you can even navigate while it's zooming in, neat little touch ;) 

The style is one thing, how is the gameplay though?

You have your dual stick shooter setup here, think Binding of Isaac crossed with Monolith, and you're on the right track.

You get upgrades for you ship - 3 slots that you can use , upgrade the level of the upgrades  - and even "" weld"" them to your ship permanetly, to free up a slot.
There are also terminals in the levels ( shown on maps as white ) That do various things, including "" crushing"" your upgrades to get items back, such as crystals and hp .

Other mahcines let you exchange crystals for Hp, and vice versa ( same machine ) 
Others let you weld upgrades to your ship to free up slots, and then there's some that are roulette wheels that reward you, or shock you and - 1 HP from your ship.
( there are more mahcine types than that, some are even hidden ) 

Your given a map, ( which you can look at any time )  and each room on it has exits that either have a number, or a letter on them.

the numbers represent how many waves of enemies you'll be fighting in that room, 2 means 2 waves, 1means 1 wave, etc.

The letters are [ c ] for "" challenge "" , these room have you doing various things like - surviving an onslaught of enemies, holding a point on the room for a certian time ( the point moves ) clearing a certain amount of enemies, collect orbs, it varies as you go on- pretty engaging, actually - it didn't break up the flow of the game, it adds a nice spice to it , and the room give you rewards - so you'll want to give em a go.

There are [ T ] rooms, those give you two upgrades to choose from to add to your ship - no enemies or tricks.

and  ( B )  rooms - where you fight a boss battle, and those can be pretty tricky given a small room size, and bullet hell combined with damaging floor panels !

The upgrades are what made me keep playing, mixing and matching them.

You get weapon types like a lasar, a rocket, piercing shots, ricochet shots - and you can combine these all!

The rest are things like, homing shots - lowers you attack spped rate, and hp - but automatically goes for enemies, even around corners!

rate of fire is one, you can level all of these upgrades, too! and then add more of the same name if you want :33

i played mostly on "" hell "" mode - i found the standard difficulty a bit too easy for me.
Hell is just what you would think, they throw different enemies at you, they fire faster, move quicker- make you deader faster.
The room layouts are less forgiving, just an overall good dose of difficulty.

And if that's not enough... there's modifiers which make thingsEVEN harder. ( 3 pages of em, to be exact) 

not a single one is beneficial to the gameplay, they are all negative - and meant to introduce more challenge for pros.

i usually use "" surprise party  which makes enemies sometimes spawn in a room you've previously cleared. I liked that a lot.


There is also a score aspct to this game, but it seems the leaderbaords are local only ( at least for now, or perhaps because im in the release verison, i'm not sure - i'll edit this later if i confirm it to be online leaderboards )

Easy to learn, you'll be done with the tutorial and on your way to enjoy the game in seconds. This is a game that doesn't waste your time.

The gameplay will quickly remind you of games like Asteroids and Smash TV, with some Isaac added for good measure. You can mix and match upgrades to tweak your attack style and create different builds. Rapid fire multi bullets that bounce everywhere, Piercing explody lasers or Homing rockets of doom? You decide.

The enemies you meet all have very different and clear patterns you have to compose with. Target prioritization and careful positioning will save your life. It's important to note that clearing out a room without taking any HP damage will be rewarded by the game.

Rooms will also often contain a machine which offers some sort of trade or risk/reward kinda deal. Those give you some good opportunities to invest and manage your resources or just flirt with Lady Luck if you wish to.

Once you complete your first run, the game gives you a difficulty modifier (for increased scoring potential!), which can be used to unlock another modifier, which can be used to unlock another, etc. And once you got them all, you will unlock Hell mode. This is where things get serious, with all enemies gaining new attacks and the game in general doing its best to kill you.

Special mention for the music, which I really enjoyed. Strangely nostalgic, it was epic without being overwhelming.

Almost forgot, but there's local coop too. Didn't try it yet, so more on that later.

Null Vector is a rogue-lite game that has been inspired by The Binding of Isaac and arcade classics. However, it stands on its own as a great game with its own unique ideas.

[h1]Sound[/h1]

The overall sound design is incredible, matching the aesthetics perfectly. The music used throughout the game is great and the sound effects never seemed out of place or poorly made.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

The graphics are simple, but this is fine as it fits with the style the developer was going for. After playing for a while, you can easily recognise all the enemies, pickups and upgrade machines. Everything has a square marked on the floor underneath it, which is very useful for enemies that can hover and bullets that arc.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay is very fast paced, with bullets flying all over the screen in the later levels. The levels are split into a series of randomly generated rooms that are each clearly labelled with how many waves there will be, or whether it is a boss or upgrade room. I found this was very useful when choosing how to navigate each level.  As for example, I would know to avoid a room with 3 waves in it if I was injured. The upgrades you find are paramount to a successful run as you will get damage upgrades, shields and weapons to make you more powerful. I found it a lot of fun darting through all of the enemy bullets, knowing that if I died, it was back to the start again. 

However, after a couple of tries I found that the standard mode seemed a bit too easy. After getting used to the controls, enemies and upgrades, I found myself blazing through all six levels and the final boss with not much difficulty. The modifiers do make a difference though, especially the one that [spoiler]removes the shield pickup from the game[/spoiler]. ‘Hell mode’ also seems a much harder challenge and I found myself struggling a lot more in that mode. 

[h1]Replay Value[/h1]

There is quite a lot of replay value here as there are various modifiers to unlock as well as the ‘Hell mode’. The modifiers affect various gameplay elements to make it harder but give you a higher score at the end. The Hell mode gives all of the enemies more attacks that are harder to dodge. 

[h1]Options[/h1]

I have tried the game with both types of control and a controller is recommended, but the game is still playable using a mouse and keyboard. Keys appear to be rebindable using the input panel that opens before the game starts.  However, when I changed some keys to check this, the default controls were still being used. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

For such a low price, Null Vector is a very well-polished game that very much deserves a place in your library. However, the apparent lack of rebindable keys and the game feeling too easy takes a couple of points away from a perfect score. It is still a good game though and is a great accomplishment for a one-man development team.

[u]Внимание: обзор пишется пока игра в раннем доступе, и все нижеизложенное, актуально на дату публикации.[/u]

По пунктам, игра выглядит так:
[list]
    [*]У нас есть 7 уровней (7-ой с боссом), с n-м количеством рандомно генерируемых комнат, в которых нам надо победить врагов, найти апгрейды (урон (damage), пробивание (piercing) и ракетный бот (rocket bot), самые полезные), и получить максимальный счет.

    [*]Бои в игре хардкорные, динамичные и веселые. Несмотря на рекомендацию игры с геймпадом, на клавиатуре управление вполне отзывчивое.

    [*]Есть модификаторы, открывающиеся при определенных условиях. Они усложняют игру, но увеличивают очки.

    [*]При наличии геймпада можно играть вдвоем с другом, что увеличивает уровень кайфа от игры.

    [*]Графика неоновая, минималистичная, но приятная. Музыка в целом приличная.

    [*]Из бесполезного: в игре есть автоматы которые за кристаллы удаляют апгрейды. Смысла в этом мало, ибо апгрейды можно тупо выбросить. По идее от этого тратиться здоровье, но его можно подобрать, а вот кристаллы нужны всегда. Радар, за кристаллы показывающий где есть автоматы, тоже малополезен, лучше бы он выход показывал, ибо пока будем его искать, найдем и почти все автоматы. Очки в игре есть, а глобального рейтинга нет, это печаль.

    [*]Из минусов - босс всегда один и тот же, хотелось бы большего разнообразия. То же и с уровнями, через час они уже надоедают.
[/list]

Как итог: довольно хороший рогалик на 20-30 минут прохождения. Открыть все модификаторы, и пройти игру раз 5, вполне можно часа за 1.5-2. Любителям жанра, сыграть можно.

-Slightly challenging and pretty quick to finish, not offering all that much in terms of content but it has a great replay value to it in my experience
-The small rogue-lite elements such as upgrades and power-ups add a nice little touch to the game
-It's free

Cons:
-Slightly rage inducing at times due to my own error (and the obvious keyboard-mouse combo I used to play it)

Overall this is a solid little game, definitely worth your time

It's like Asteroids got a makeover and it's so boring. You basically move around in a room shooting stuff. There is a number on each room telling you how many waves you must survive to get out. E.g. 3 = 3 waves of enemies. The enemies are odd shapes that will shoot at you with different abilities like exploding bombs or teleporting attacks but it's all about move around and dodging them while attacking.

Gameplay-wise, this is a controller game. You move your triangle with the left controller stick and aim-shoot with the right controller stick. Kill all enemies to complete a zone. You have lives and if you get hit an enemy, you lose a life. If you lose all your lives, it's game over. You can collect crystals and trade them in to heal any damage you receive and vice versa. You can also use the crystals to buy ships parts, upgrade ship parts, permanently weld them to the ship, find secret locations, etc.

Conclusion, skip this game. It's like Asteroids in a room with the ability to move and shoot. Sure there are walls and different enemies but the core of the game is moving around and avoiding objects.

There are a couple of fringe retro ""features"" that could be improved or trimmed without upsetting the 80s motif IMO.

1. the cryptic/impartial description of the ships' status. I want to know exactly what ship parts I already have, Why not just give this basic information?
2. a description of items would be nice. What do nanobots do, for example? Retro games generally had instruction manuals, as this doesn't it should pick up the shortfall with a little description (granted this is redundant for most items thus far).
3. the points system is obsolete. Noone has cared about points in games for the last 30+ years, if they ever did, and its not clear even how points are gained. The game should be more clear about user performance, giving the user a clearer idea of what they can improve. I know that contradicts the arcade motif, but in my opinion in recreations of older products,  one should ideally extract only whats good, and be mindful of sensible modern improvements. This may make for a marginally less authentic product, but a higher quality one.

Finally, this feels like a game targetting a hardcore audience, but isn't really that difficult. I hadn't even mastered the controls (I was constantly getting my wires crossed between moving the ship and shooting, and mostly only kept to 4 directions instead of 8), and still beat the game quite comfortably, just by upgrading the right way (basically stacking up attacks and slaughtering everything on screen).

Obviously game length is not a current strong point, though with permadeath there is an inherent soft limit.

Finally controller support is a must.",1514127799,1514128396,True,3,0,0.539848387241363525,0,False,False,True,False,,,

""What if the contestant from Smash TV hijacked the ship from Asteroids and crashed it into an retro arcade game that stole some of the excess neon from Farcry Blood Dragon?""

That's pretty much Null Vector in a nutshell. A very much retro-styled twinstick shooter in which your ship and weapon can be upgraded with various stacking power-ups. Like in many retro games, the task you're given is simple: survive six randomly generated floors and, if you get far enough, fight against the boss at the end. Or go down in a blaze of glory.

Even in its relatively barebones and early access state (which, at the moment is currently at the crazy price of nothing!), Null Vector does precisely what the blurb on the Steam store page says it does; give you a rogue-lite experience that, reminiscent of the arcades, lends itself quite nicely to being one of those ""pick up and play"" experiences that you can play in short bursts without having to tax yourself. 

Other than dodging bullets (and the enemies firing them!), there isn't too much focus needed. And, sometimes, that's what you want in a gaming experience. Don't feel up to shaving down your lap times in a sim-racer or countering the opposing team's strategies in an FPS? That's what twinsticks are for. Blast little polygonal enemies into bits: The Game.

Sure, right now, I've got a shade over two hours of accumulated game time but, in those a hundred and twenty-odd minutes, I must've chalked up a dozen attempts and only managed to kill the boss once. If you make it that far, it really doesn't take that long to get to the end; a really condensed and fun experience, if that's what you're into.

For the sake of the dreaded game comparisons, if you combine the aesthetics of the retro-arcade-favorite Tempest with a Geometry Wars that’s taken some time off its steroids, you get Null Vector. 

Late 80’s-inspired visuals and rock synth create the atmospheric vibe of a day at the arcade clad with tucked-in shirts, rimmed glasses and sweaty determination. In Null Vector, you traverse procedurally generated, grid-layered rooms fighting off opposing geometries. 

While gliding across these random battles, the triangular protagonist can apply various, yet limited upgrades to its ship – often coming across wielding stations that permanently attach these improvements, allocating space for newer items.

At face value, the game’s fast-paced, reactive environment makes for a re-playable title; dying just short of completing a floor when you’ve completely upgraded your ship fuels motivation to beat the game in one fell swoop. 

However, this is also part of a larger problem: the game is too damn short now. Other than its difficulty, there’s a lacking incentive to replay the game once you’ve beaten it. 

Though, this shortcoming shouldn’t be rapped on too much; what is clearly a F2P title has much room to grow and expand its level.

With a visual style reminiscent of Tron and gameplay similar to Asteroids, it definitely succeeds. When you first enter Null Vector's world, you will be welcomed with an arcade machine, reminding you that it's all a game. But when you begin playing, you get absorbed by your desire to succeed.

The mechanics of Null Vector are finely tuned to allow tight control over the player-character, leaving each consecutive defeat at the fault of the player alone. But unlike other rogue-likes, you can return to your point of death quickly as you get better with each run. Eventually you find yourself cruising through rooms with little-to-no damage each time, and then become faced with an even bigger challenge.

The boss really ties everything together. The first time you encounter it, you will likely die. The second time, you will die again. This addendum forces you to think about every hit you take and every item you grab. Are you being efficient enough? Will you have enough potential to defeat the boss?

Null Vector is a free retro-style action game in which you have to destroy all of the enemy ships to advance to the next levels. Sounds simple right? Wrong. Null Vector is harder than you might think (or else I suck more than I'll admit) and you may find it a bit challenging to clear the room you're in (even though the first room is super easy).

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]I love the [b]exploration[/b] in this game. Simple, yet effective, after each room you will often have multiple paths to follow. There is more than one room type and multiple ways to get to the next room you need to go to in order to advance.
[*][b]Variety of enemies[/b] is something this game does really well. Between the guys shooting at you, the diamonds that bounce around, until destroyed when they explode into multiple projectiles, the squares that shoot mines, the drills that try to ram you, and even more types you'll find you have a lot to handle.
[*]There is a lot of [b]customization options[/b] for your ship and it really lets you choose the upgrades you want. I won't fully go into how this works, so you can see it for yourself, but you start off with three ship part slots and will come across parts as you play. These are random so counterbalnced to the power of customization you get is the fact that you have to make do with what you get. I myself do not like, for example, ricochet or laser as much as the helper bots, shield, or damage/fire rate boosts, but when ricochet or laser are the only choices you have you have to pick one. This also forces you to adapt to the particular situation. This system is more complex then what I've described but, like I say, I'll let you see for yourself.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]I dunno..., the fact that I can't buy the sountrack I guess...?
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I could have mabye listed other things in the pros but I think what I wrote will suffice. The game has really cool 80's design. The levels are well laid out. It's simple but the postion of the obstacles will chance the room significatly. Since this game is free and so well designed, there is no reason not to pick it up. Also, as it is (currently) in early access I assume we can except some imporvements (not that I can imagine what could be improved anyhow).",1506186286,1506186286,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

The ability to combine weapon properties is a huge draw, and what makes me willing to run through the small set of randomized levels over and over. Some of the properties have some odd balancing choices - damage and homing slow your fire rate, which makes sense, yet nabbing multishot and fire rate can enable you to spray the entire game field with fire, annihilating things quickly - assuming you're fortunate enough to get that combination. Considering the game is FREE, it's worth checking out, and I'm definitely going to buy it when it becomes an option. Even more, the developer is updating the game - the most recent patch added a bunch of important features & more content, so it seems likely that this will be the game that scratches my ""i'll just play one more quick game, before I go to bed"" itch for the foreseeable future.",1506055542,1506055542,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I found Null Vector on the early access portion of Steam and of course I'm going to download it -- it's also free.

I just really like the actual look to it (and the soundtrack is banging). 

Basically the gameplay loop that I've found so far delving into this is very Binding of Isaac/Zelda like where you're advancing through a dungeon via windows but each door has a variable on it (say like 1,2,3 or {T}) the numbers represent how many waves their are and the {T} is the store.

As you progress you'll find stations where you can weld an item that you pickup (example more damage, lazers, etc.) which allows another upgrade (you max at 3 but can exceed it with this mechanic)

I haven't ran into an actual boss yet, but it gets hard. Like bullet hell hard. It's like this blend of a roguelike and bullet hell that I really adore and plan to play more of and have seen like 0 coverage on this game.

NO MICROTRANSACTIONS
Hitboxes feel great and when you land a hit,it's extremely satisfying
many,many weapon/upgrade combos
enemies all feel and react differently
randomly generated rooms
currency system implimented with almost like binding of isaac risk/reward rooms

cons:
crystals(currency)are hard to find you usually only get 1-2 per level
after a while the enemies start recycling
Though there are many weapon combos,there are only a few weapons from what ive seen
