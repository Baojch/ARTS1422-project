Seltsame Rezensionen... Das Spiel ist in Ordnung

Man liest direkt auf der 1. Seite der Rezensionen diverse Meldungen, die ich so nicht bestätigen kann:

1. Das Spiel ist verbuggt! Komisch, gefunden habe ich keine... Es gab keinerlei Abstürze und der einzige ""Bug"" sind diverse Gegenstände, in die man hineinlaufen kann und dadurch kurz Graphikglitches hat (z.B. Kisten)
2. Das Spiel hat kein Speichersystem! Komisch, ich bin mehrere Male gestorben und wurde sofort wieder an einen (sehr nahen) Autosave-Point geladen. Ich hatte nie einen ""Spielverlust"" von mehr als max. 1 Minute. Außerdem sieht man sehr häufig die ""Feder"" als Zeichen des Autosaves. 

Ich selbst habe nur ein Ärgernis, das ich dem Spiel ankreide:

Direkt nach dem Start, du bist vielleicht 10 Minuten im Spiel, geht es nicht mehr weiter. Egal was du machst, du findest keine Wege / Gegenstände mehr. Nach 5-10 Minuten Rumgerenne habe ich hier frustriert den Guide aufgemacht (danke dafür) und die Lösung gefunden: [spoiler]Man muss die Wachen ""beklauen"", also von hinten anschleichen. Schade nur, dass das nie erklärt wird...[/spoiler]
Bis auf diesen Stolperstein ist das Spiel aber 100% lösbar. Klar, hier und da hakt es mal kurz, aber wirkliche Kopfnüsse sind nicht dabei. 

Ansonsten bleibt nicht viel zu sagen. Warum trotzdem ""nur"" 5 von 10 und damit gerade so ""Daumen hoch""?

- Das Spiel ist verdammt kurz
- Die Graphik ist bescheiden. Nicht schlimm für ein kleines Projekt, das auch knapp ein Jahrzehnt alt ist, aber meh...
- Die ganze Story wirkt eher blass, anders als ein paar andere SpielerInnen habe ich keine große ""Atmosphäre"" beim Spielen verspürt.

Fazit: Ein Satz, den ich hier mehrmals gelesen habe, fasst das Spiel gut zusammen: Es ist nichts Besonderes, einfach Durchschnitt. Kein Grund für die tiefrote Abwertung. Sollte man sich das Spiel kaufen? Lieber nicht. Bietet das Spiel Adventure-Freunden einen Reiz? Kommt auf den Sichtwinkel und die Toleranzschwelle an. Hätte ich mir das Spiel gekauft? Hell no! Ist es zu schlimm, um es zu spielen, falls es qua Bundle oder gratis in dein Inventar wandert? Ich denke nicht...",1680627678,1680627678,True,2,0,0.534777045249938965,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Leider Crashed das Game bei mir sobald ich in die Kapelle/Kirche möchte. Allgemein hatte ich auch den Eindruck, das sehr viel nicht so funktioniert wie es sollte (hing im Stein fest etc.)
Derzeit ist das spiel einfach NICHT spielbar!

I ended up just leaving the game alone and playing again days or weeks later and it worked. 

This game is not good but it also doesn't cost that much. Currently without sale it costs $2.99 USD and I think that is a fair price, you are not paying for a master piece and to be honest I enjoyed it enough for that price. The transforming into a werewolf was cool, being able to kill the guards and other people also cool but you don't have to and there are different endings depending on what you do.

From my experience of having to learn how to loot with control and going behind guards . Was a serious pain. Since, this game lacks tutorials and relies on the lunar puzzle approach on gaming . Even, in I (inventory ) / options you don't see all the controls you can do. 

 This game uses I as inventory , M for maps , shift to run, control to crouch, wasd for walking , and left mouse click for interactions . Once, you get use to that. (Unless your on a xbox / ps / nintendo controller . Best of luck trying to figure out what does what . )

 Guise of the wolf is kinda like a early gamecube game. Where polys and textures are small. If you're expecting a game like fnaf or games that sell for $5 with a small team running unity or more commonly unreal engine . This game uses a different engine from what I can tell . 

For the most part once, you understand the controls . You can easily speed run through this game . Sure not all objects have hit detections and the werewolf chase momments are iffy . This game oddly has charm in a weird way .

  Is it worth $3 ? Well what do you expect for a old short game ? The price feels right and it's not much . For a simple game this could be so much worse. An I do hope the devs someday attempt a remake to address and fix issues in this game . Otherwise , for $3 this is so much better than the shovelwere on Nintendo switch eshop . 

 Would I recommend this game to kids or people who don't play logic puzzles . That really depends if you wan't to experience a game that feels like a 2004 game . Not that it's a bad thing. But, it feels like a time capsole in more than, 1 way .

 With a 16 gb crucible ram card this game plays at 100-120 fps usually . If your worried about, visuals and graphics . Try playing that game with reshade and texture packs to help make the game look newer if you want stuff like ray tracing . 

 In my time spent playing this game. Yes there was issues, yes I was angry. But, when I got past those hiccups . I found myself having fun . I wouldn't say this game is bad . I did beat half the game already . So, if the devs just updated the voice acting and polished the textures some. Heck yeah this game should be $6 if it ever got fixed where it needs it the most .",1642128683,1642135217,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes the realization is considerably janky, but it does have it's charm, not to mention that it reeks of retarded 90s adventure game mechanics in a semi-nostalgic way. You know back when you had to click all over the place to find the seemingly unimportant crap at the randomest of places that which turned out to be essential for story progression, or when the gameplay designer had envisioned a puzzle which he considered to be a genius concept, opposed to the rest of the planet's population who couldn't figure out a solution for said puzzle even if their lives depended on it. This one has it all, freshly sparkled with some janky werewolf transformation based gameplay mechanics as well just to top it all off. 

I enjoyed myself in the 2.7 hours it took for me to finish the adventure.

Just to get this straight: The game is not exactly g o o d, HOWEWER I've played much MUCH worse games than this. Shameless Unity asset flip games with no background music whatsoever whose achievements were glitched or in other cases games that simply refused to run at all, that would just randomly hard crash themselves (then next-gen console ports of them nonetheless) in every instance at the exact same point of the game, irreversibly halting their progression for the rest of time.

Okay, let's get this out of the way first. Everyone I have ever seen talking about or playing the game has encountered several bugs, glitches or crashes. I have no idea what happened, but I have been able to play the entirety of the game without any of it! It never crashed on me and I did not encounter a single bug.

[h1]The Room of video games[/h1]
When choosing between recommending this game or not recommending this game, one has to choose what qualifies as a recommendation. If we're looking at artistic talent, gameplay mechanics, story and a good engine with solid graphics- this ain't it. However, this game is in the territory that it's so bad, it's good again- and I thoroughly ""enjoyed"" my time with it.

The graphics are nostalgic, but at the same time completely butchered. The voice acting is on par with The Room as is the writing in this game. The music was dreadful, yet set the tone pretty well. The quote ""Good evening me lord- Helps to have a map"" has deserved the same status as ""I did not hit her, I did not- oh hi Mark"" which is a beautiful thing.

[h1]Making it unnecessarily long[/h1]
Another thing both Guise of the Wolf and The Room have in common is that it's 75% filler. This game will make you walk the same few rooms over and over again until you can navigate around them blindfolded.
It will release fetch-type quests, making you go through the entirety of the map- often more than once as well because the game refuses to give any hints about its vague quests.

Here's a good example, spoilered:
[spoiler]In the end, the game requires you to put the amulet the princess gives you (without ever telling anything about it) on a statue. It never tells you this, hints at this and the quest log simply states ""I need to find the king"" (I can't remember their names). Without looking at a let's play directly, chances are you'll never find out about this on your own and remain stuck- get frustrated and never finish it. It's the same when having to fetch Wolf's blood and Feathers- they're hidden incredibly well on random spots- so you can't logic your way to these items.[/spoiler]

There's a good and a bad ending. I apparently got the bad ending and I have no idea what I should do to get the good ending. And frankly, I don't care. Finishing the game is a feat on its own and I'm happy I played it.

The animation that played at the end of the bad ending was also very on par with being like The Room in terms of quality and hilarity.

[h1]So, should you play it?[/h1]
Yes. Yes, you should. It's not expensive, it's fun and it's something completely different from what you're used to. Don't expect good things and don't expect competency. Just expect to have a time.",1630853424,1630853424,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Some tips to save yourself- Make sure you grab the Axe in the starting area or you'll have to restart the game. Press M to find your map (it's there). You can pickpocket guards by crouching with Ctrl and clicking. Your game saves anytime you see the feather in the corner. And definitely use the steam walkthrough if you get lost.

However, that said- The game does have a certain charm and appeal. The story, while a bit bare boned, is intriguing and some of the mechanics are actually rather fun.

Was erwartet man für unter 10€ ? 
Ich persönlich finde das Spiel für den Preis in Ordnung, manche Rätsel sind zu leicht, manche zu schwer, aber irgendwie wollte ich immer weiter Spielen.

Auf eine ganz merkwürdige weiße hat es das Spiel geschafft mich aber trotzdem zum Spielen zu bewegen. 
Mein Fazit: Wer es mag - freut euch. Wer ein AAA Titel will, kauf dir was anderes. 
Für Die Entwickler noch einen Rat, bitte achtet das nächste mal darauf das eure Spieler auch nachvollziehen können, wenn sie einer Wache etwas stehlen sollen. 
Die Karte ist für mich übrigens völlig nutzlos. 
Vielleicht könntet ihr dem Spieler auch etwas mehr Bewegungsfreiheiten zugestehen, manchmal verzweifelte ich an einer Kleinigkeit, weil ich im Eifer des Gefechtes an etwas vorbei gerannt bin.
Die Grundidee vom Spiel finde ich sehr gut.

Despite having the appearance of a horror game, it's closer to a puzzle game, or maybe a first person point and click adventure.

Well I know this game is mainly negative based on the reviews but this is honestly one of the better Werewolf games that I know that is out there.

Later on, I was tasked with finding the various ingredients for the ""Wolfsbane"" potion. I found all but one which I had to look up where it was after 20 mins of looking around the castle.

Presumably I had missed some optional items that would've given me another choice but at that point I was unwilling to restart and see what the other was.

No slowdowns, no crashes. Initial lockups on loading screen that appear to be related to using Windows 10, but I was able to fix (see end of the review).

I was surprised to find I'm actually enjoying this game, given its harsh reviews, It's far from perfect, but it's also far from being a bad game at the current price point of $2.99. I'd probably be annoyed if I were expecting a AAA title and paid $50 for it, but it's fun despite a number of polish issues.

There was a major controversy surrounding this game and its developer's fight with a prominent Youtube reviewer in 2014. I have no dog in that fight, and it's not a consideration in my review.

The game:

 - It has a good fictional premise: you're an alchemist hired to help stop a mysterious beast that has been attacking people in and near a castle, during the Middle Ages.
 - The artwork is great, sort of a combination of cell-shading and 3D. It looks fairly primitive, but there is something about the style that tickles my fancy. I especially enjoyed the courtyard with falling snow.
 - The music is evocative.
 - It's fully voiced. The writing is generally good, with some obvious weak bits. The same goes for the voice acting.
 - It does a good job keeping the plot moving.

The game isn't without its problems:

 - It tries to install an unnecessary component (Ogg Vorbis) when you launch. I decline every time,
 - Running in Windows 10 requires setting Windows 7 + Administrator compatibility modes on the game's executable file, or it freezes on the load screen.
 - The game only supports auto-saves, done every time your journal updates. This means lost progress if you want to quit before hitting a new save point.
 - You can't view the keybinds within the game.
 - Advancing requires reading the manual, because it describes a couple of controls / features you are unlikely to figure out on your own, and they are necessary to understand or you'll get stuck VERY early. However, the manual spoils a couple of surprises that I think are better left to experiencing in-game. You can read my as-non-spoiler-as-possible hints instead:[spoiler](1) You'll need to use the pickpocketing ability early, which requires crouching (CTRL) and using the interact / hand icon while behind your target. (2) To get past the area where you turn into a wolf the first time, you'll need to use your wolf abilities (run and swipe) on more than one target.[/spoiler]
 - Some of the things you must do are fictionally illogical, such as [spoiler] the early requirement to pickpocket guards.[/spoiler]
 - Similarly illogical are the chests scattered about that you can (must?) pick.
 - The map is useless, as it's just 2D sprites and doesn't show your position.
 - NPC models and animations are pretty crude, though they get the job done.
 - Puzzles are super simple, not much above walking simulator level (might be a positive depending on your preferences).

Most of the above are technical / polish issues that could be patched, though it seems unlikely they will be at this point. The underlying game is fundamentally sound, and an enjoyable experience with a little patience for its rough bits.

FIXING THE LOADING SCREEN FREEZE ON WINDOWS 10:

Setting Windows 7 and Administrator mode on the two game executables fixed it for me:

- RIGHT-click on Guise of the Wolf in in your list of games, and select PROPERTIES.
- Select the LOCAL FILES tab, then BROWSE LOCAL FILES
- Open the GAME folder
- Set the two Guise of the Wolf files to Windows 7 and Run as Administrator compatibility mode:

- RIGHT click and select PROPERTIES
- Select the COMPATIBILITY tab.
- Check the box to run in COMPATIBILITY MODE, and set it to Windows 7.
- Check the box to RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR.

TLDR: Between the bugs, the performance issues, the general lack of good ease of use with the interface and mechanics, and the clunky way to activate and complete the action segments, the narrative and tone of the game is brought down significantly to the point where it is a chore to play. Otherwise the general premise of collecting ingredients, brewing potions, dealing with medieval politics and using the moonlight to your avantage to think outside the box as far as navigating the environment were all good ideas but the execution just fails

Note: First time I played the optimization was too poor and I had to abandon play part way through. The second time around I forgot the axe and spent 30 minutes wondering why I could not progress. I ended up settling for watching a speedrun and calling it a day.

You wake up in the middle of a wintery forest area and start to look for your carriage driver. You eventually venture into the abandon castle to find out you’ve been bitten. As it turns out the Lord of the castle called upon you to create a cure for this curse that plagues the castle.
The story is so so. It slowly draws you in and will put many to sleep at the same time. It gives little to no character development and still leaves holes in the story even at the end. For a ‘horror’ based game there is very little horror to the story seeing as it’s either laughably bad or easily defeated. They did take some unique turns in making a monster story, like making potions and cures. But it ends slightly cliché, even with two different endings. Don’t get me wrong the endings are nicely done, but you’ve probably seen them before.
The graphics are terribly dated, but that’s nothing new with Indy games. Even with dated graphics many have found a way to make them artistic looking or add some different qualities to enhance their limitations. One good example is Papers, Please. It’s a very stressful take on living in a 3rd world country as a boarder security guard. The graphs are utter crap. However shading and simple design help bring the game to a very dreary vivid world. With Guise Of The Wolf it very much reminds me of Theif 2, except it lacks most things. In many areas where a shadow would be cast on someone it shows them in regular lighting. Also many of the characters appear to be BRIGHTER then the surrounding area for some reason. Then when I’d load the game again it would do a 180 and show the complete opposite of what I stated above. Another thing that stand out is that many of the characters have very very limited movement. The guards of the castle seem to have 3, a women you meet in the kitchen seems to only have 2, and the main bad guy only has 4. Now sure it would be different if they were 2d, but this is a 3d world that would probably be a few more hours of coding to be a little lusher and it drains away from the submersion aspect of video games all together. To a certain extent the graphics set back the experience all together.
The controls are wonky to say the least. They start out smooth, but it seems there are too many unfinished parts of the game. So despite how many times you smash down a button it becomes more and more difficult to wiggle out of a glitch in a piece of scenery. Many times I found myself falling through the world or I would get stuck on invisible pieces of something that would render all the controls moot. Other times I would hit a button to perform a action and it just didn’t work. Like say if I wanted to take something. It wouldn’t grasp a clearly graspable object, but when I hit the same button seconds later it would pick up that same object.
In the end this was just a bad game. It was a good attempt for a indy developer. However due to the graphics and story it would have probably been higher rated if it was released years ago and put more time into it. With dated PlayStation 1 like graphics and bland story I can’t recommend it, but can’t say you shouldn’t avoid it either. Although I will say the things that they did well, like some of the voice acting, doesn’t do enough to redeem it completely. However for the more ADD ridden gamer they’ll find themselves bored and frustrated. So if you can get it for cheap buy it. It’s worth a few hours if your really bored. Unfortunately in the end it’s easily forgettable and a mildly regrettable experience.

Pourtant, il n'en est rien, ce jeu est en réalité un énorme gachis, sur tous les tableaux.

Aujourd'hui, il est assez "" aisé "" de rendre un jeu agréable à l'oeil. Inutile de vouloir faire un jeu hyper-réaliste, un rendu en comic animé (comme The Walking Dead), à la pastelle (comme Life is Strange) ou low-cost (comme Call of Juarez : Gunslinger) peut facilement suffire ! Et on a la désagréable impression que pendant le jeu entier, les développeurs ont eux-mêmes hésité sur la marche à suivre concernant les graphismes... On en vient à avoir un jeu tout simplement moche (et mal optimisé, tant qu'à faire).

Concernant le gameplay, le jeu n'est pas en reste. Il y a des phases de plate-forme, d'enquête, d'énigme (à la Amnesia), d'action (en tant que loup-garou) et de fuite (tel le Nemesis dans Resident Evil 3). Et là encore, le jeu s'en sort mal. Si les phases de recherche/enquête ont le mérite d'être assez bonnes, il n'en est rien pour les autres. A aucun moment le loup-garou qui vous poursuit ne fait peur, et les phases d'action et de plate-forme sont les plus ennuyantes qu'il m'a été permis de tester dans ma vie...

Et là où ça fait mal, c'est concernant le mythe du loup-garou. Les incohérences sont légions, à commencer par le reflet de votre personnage qui n'apparaît pas dans les miroirs. Sans être un expert, cette caractéristique est réservée aux vampires ! On appréciera au moins le fait d'avoir la possibilité de lire plusieurs livres sur les lycanthropes (le background tient la route de ce côté-là).

Le jeu a néanmoins plusieurs côtés positifs, sinon je ne m'acharnerai pas à avoir la totalité des succès. L'ambiance est plutôt convaincante, aidée par une bande-son de qualité. Le château est comme un personnage à part entière, et les amateurs de loup-garou pourraient y trouver leur compte ! Mais le jeu possède beaucoup trop de défauts pour qu'on puisse en profiter à sa juste mesure. Le prix a le mérite d'être honnête, au moins !

The twist becomes that you are stricken with lycanthropy and after dabbling in some potions, you unlock the ability to control yourself as a werewolf. Its a game that has charm enough to be playable despite being ripe with imperfections such as stiff animations, clipping through background objects, poor voice acting and seeing through the seems of objects just to name a few.

The bulk of the game, you're in a snowy castle that does a good job of detailing the look and making it convincing as a real place that someone could live in. There's a kitchen, a dungeon, a main hall, a courtyard and so on. The dungeon has bear traps set for the werewolf, so always look at the brown floor to see the rust colored traps. Stepping on one or any kind of death will restart you at the last frequent checkpoint.

There are a few characters to interact with. Some with instructions and other are there just to flesh out an area. They are voice acted and as wooden as the acting is, I'd rather hear it than read it. That's one of the game's issues, hearing the text. Even with the sound cranked up in the settings, the speech from person to person is inconsistent. Some are soft while others are clear.

You'll encounter the werewolf a few times where your only choice is to run. There are levers to pull that will spare your life when a gate comes crashing down to separate you. For a budget game, the werewolf's animation is serviceable, but its basic. Every animation is basic in the game, but at least the characters have moving mouths. Almost nothing else moves though. No one blinks, but they seem to breathe by slowly bobbing at the knees.

When you become a werewolf, you have the ability to dash and destroy objects like twenty stone statues or barricades. You can even maul citizens to death. To transform at key moments, simply stand in the moonlight for long enough until your character drops to the ground and his arms get longer, grow claws and hair. Its a basic system that lets you get to the next area. Your time as a werewolf is limited, the moon on your screen will time how much time you have left. Its a good mechanic.

The game is linear, but you'll still have to search around a bit to discover things like ingredients for a potion or a lever to open a door. You can even see your current objective in the inventory, but its never that far away. Its good if you take a long hiatus from the game.

The controls feel like a lot of other games, mouse to look, keys or controller to move. You have buttons and keys to interact, run, a pathetic jump, map, inventory and cancel. Its a game that is self explanatory that keeps you on point and task. It quarantines you in an area until you figure out how to progress. If you try to proceed without doing what you need to, the game will prevent you from leaving.

You'll need to look in your inventory, select them and find something to use them with such as giving an apple to a prisoner that could kill for an apple rather than saying, ""Could I bother you for some food? You see no one has fed me in quite a while, in fact you are the first person I've seen in maybe a day."" You'll need an item that breaks down weak doors and drop ingredients in a cauldron to make a potion.

The puzzles are never anything that cryptic and solving one will lead you to the next area in fact the game will often tell you what needs to be done and you figure out how to do it. There are switch puzzles, places where you'll need to mix a potion using a list. Just follow the instructions. You can even pick the locks on a treasure chest by clicking four switches to make four tumblers shift into position. Its a fluff mini game, but its still engaging at the same time.

As simple as these tasks are, there is a moment early on in the game where you need to realize that you're supposed to pick pocket a guard for the key. This is so cryptic and soon into the game that it can turn people away from the game forever. A different guard comically tells you no one is allowed to pass, but he'll let you pass for two hundred gold. Now go loot the castle. What? That's like having a bank tell you, sorry you don't have enough for an account, but if you rob us, you'd have enough.

I have to say the cell shading makes the game stand out in a good way. There are so many games without it, that just look awful. Its better to have something that looks unique and better than cheap. The torches and light affects do a lot to enhance the visuals as well, but upon closer inspection you can see faults with the art style. The black lines are drawn as objects rather than on the textures themselves. So if you put your nose up to something like a book or a bar, you can see black lines floating. One specific giant crack in the wall is just in front of the wall, so if you move, the crack will shift position on the wall. Its nothing game breaking, but its still noticeable.

Guise of the Wolf has a lot of noticeable faults. Walking through bushes and chests. When you click on something in the menu or your inventory, you need to move your mouse cursor off it in order to click it a second time. The fireplaces look tiny compared to the beds. Rather than pushing a door, its the handle you need to interact with, even if there is no handle. The alter in the church is up to your chin, as are some of the tables. Some barrels you can only click on their lower half from far away and last, it just looks funny seeing your hand as a cursor on a character's body parts.

Its two biggest sins are the cryptic pick pocket leads to frustration and its production values fall short. With better animation, the game would excel to its audience, but it still needs some hint that you can pick pocket. These are both things that could be fixed, along with the visual issues and the menu. There is a good game under all of this that people can still enjoy.

While I like the game its tough to recommend with all the hate it gets. I can overlook its faults, because they're all visual and it still manages to interesting to me. The problem is that a few years after the game's release and these minor issues never went away.",1444485412,1444485433,False,28,2,0.722192943096160889,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Your main goal is to cure yourself and stop the werewolf who gave you the bite in the first place. Along the way, you learn to control the transformation, to the point only direct moonlight can make you turn. 

I'll rate the game overall in 5 categories: 

Replayability: 4/10 
If you want to get all of the achivements you need a minimum of 2 playthroughs to get all of them (because there's 2 endings).

Graphics: 6/10 
Standard graphics, seems like a cartoon set in 2005, but it doesn't impede the experience.

Story: 7/10
Again, if you're into midevil/alchemy, you'll find this interesting to say the least. 

Voice acting: 3/10
It helps to have a map.

遊戲預告片似乎是想塑造出狼人隨時都有可能在進行探索時衝出來襲擊玩家的緊張感，但當筆者實際玩過本作後發現，狼人確實會在某些特定場合因應劇情需求出現追逐玩家，不過牠就像是一隻被車輾過雙腳造成行動不便的流浪狗，為什麼會特別提到狼人像是行動不便的流浪狗？因為玩家只要慢慢走就能躲過狼人的獵殺，沒有人會被這種時速不到一公里的可笑東西嚇到！當玩家躲過一次又一次毫無挑戰性的追逐戰後，似乎是因為遊戲Bug導致的奇特現象，任何曾經使用鑰匙解鎖的房門會再一次鎖上，就連被主角幻化而成的狼人所殺死的NPC，更換場景就會使他們再次重生。


筆者當然不會推薦這款遊戲給任何人，因為這麼做等同犯法，《Guise of the Wolf》是一款沒有經過內部測試就直接對外販售的遊戲，最常見的遊戲錯誤諸如物件穿透、人物卡死、時空回逤、讀取失敗等全都應有盡有，除此之外開啟遊戲時還有不小機率在開頭畫面死當，系統會強迫玩家重新啟動電腦才能解決這項問題。筆者不懂是甚麼原因讓這款電子垃圾能夠通過Steam綠光審查發行上市，這款無聊又失敗的遊戲根本不該被當作是商品販售，不過也多虧這款遊戲能順利上市，筆者終於找到比暮光之城還難以讓人下嚥的作品了。",1436429195,1436530878,False,19,4,0.675776004791259766,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Sanotaan että idea ei ole tuomittu alusta asti, mutta toteutus on pelissä sen verran heikko, että ei tämän pelaamisesta varsinaisesti nauti.

Tarina kertoo alkemistista joka saapuu linnaan jossa riehuu ihmissusi. Tarkoitus olisi hankkiutua siitä eroon. Ikävä kyllä peto puri miestä matkalla linnaan ja siksi mies muuttuu ajoittain itsekin ihmissudeksi.

Pelin grafiikka on ihan hienoa ja ideakin on hyvä. Mutta se mihin kaikki kaatuu on se miten peli on toteutettu. Itse en ole juuri grafiikan perään sillä huonollakin grafiikalla voidaan saada hyvä peli, mutta heikko toteutus kaataa tämän pelin. Hyvin usein pelihahmo pysähtyy liikkuessaan näkymättömään kynneksyyn josta pääsee eteenpäin hyppäämällä. Tämän lisäksi hyvin monissa kohdissa peliä löytyy bugeja ja selviä virheitä.

Pääosa pelaamista on aarteenetsintää jossa ravataan pitkin linnaa ja etsitään aineksia erilaisiin rohtoihin ja eliksiireihin. Tämä on itsessään hieman ärsyttävää koska aineet voivat olla lähes missä vain ja vaikka alue ei iso olekaan, niin kyllä tämä touhu alkaa ärsyttämään. Se voisi antaa anteeksi jos pelattavuus toimisi mutta kömpelö ohjattavuus jossa maailman grafiikkabugit ja ties mitkä ohjelmointivirheet tekevät pelaamisesta melkoista piinaa.

LYHYESTI
Guise of the Wolf on peli jolla oli hyvä idea mutta kun peliä alettiin toteuttaa niin siinä kohtaa iski joko laiskuus tai taitamattomuus sillä pelissä toteutus enemmän tai vähemmän kaikessa.


+ Idea on hyvä

- Toteutus ontuu enemmän tai vähemmän kaikessa

-bad level design and quests,unless you follow a walkthrough you're gonna be stuck several times,you probably missed an item in a corner somewhere,good luck finding it

All parts of a puzzle met together, and I realized Filch was the first alchemist the comer here he created a damnation by order of the count. After it I rose against Artemis having refused to create 1 more potion.

Entering a conference hall I see the count Artemis he tells about all ominous acts... About my God Isabel! She was that werewolf who chased me on the lock, about there is no Isabel... You will pay the count!!! I do the decisive course. Isabel refuses to take a potion, suggesting to recover most.

[b]Es ist ein kleines, verschrobenes RPG ohne den Anspruch auf das ganz große Kino, sondern unterhält seine Zielgruppe bestens: Rollenspieler, Old-School Spieler, die Fünfe auch mal gerade sein lassen können.
Mehr ist es dann auch nicht! [/b]

+ eigenwillige Atmosphäre, die aber bestens funktioniert
+ eigenwilliges/einfaches Gameplay, was ein 80er/90er Rollenspieler locker nehmen wird.
+ interessante/erreichbare Erfolge und Sammelkarten
+ es ist ein einfaches, unkompliziertes Spiel! Weiß nicht, was die Leute am Anfang treiben, dass sie es nicht in die Burg schaffen. 

+/- die Atmosphäre, bzw. Grafik/Soundkulisse sollte man vorher auf YT prüfen. 
Die ist wirklich Geschmacksache.
+/- Bugs und Clippingfehler. Ja, die Steine. Ja, die Bäume. Ja, der Sound der Brücke. 
Ich fand es zum Schmunzeln.
+/- Gameplay teilweise wie aus der Urzeit, z.B. Diebstahl, Inventory, Kämpfe, keine Karte. 
Aber es passt halt irgendwie gut dazu.

[b]- Preis. 5euro sind einfach zu teuer. Alles unter 2Euro ist ok. Unter 1Euro ist es dann für die Zielgruppe ein Pflichtkauf.[/b]

Truly, this is a remarkable breakthrough in the gaming industry. The studio behind this masterpiece have made their entrance into the gaming world and it looks like they'll be sticking around. My sense of smell actually feels heightened and I can feel the tingling hairs on my nipples as they grow tenfold. Can you smell what the ROCK is cookin? I smell a sequel, do you? But I digress, reviewing time baby. 

The game throws away unconventional and worthless things like clipping. You, the player of masterpieces, will have nearly infinite freedom. No longer will we be limited to roads and paths, this is the FUTURE. The first rock you encounter will have something special cookin' inside of it, so make sure you go in there and look! You won't want to leave-and can't! 

Next, we do away with voice acting. These NPC's do not know what acting is! They are alive! Each one of them feels like a dear friend and every person you encounter shares a special memory with you. When they are harmed you can truly feel their anguish and pain. Don't even get me started on the wolf. It's just like Jakob from Twilight. Hell, I even named him Jakob. He is unmatched in his CGI cutscenes, nearly ruining every other game character with the sheer awesomeness of an ability called existence. The dialogue is very open and you even have the option to say things in different orders. Sometimes, I forget it's a game and howl into the night. Say farewell to your life because this game truly absorbs you into its dark atmosphere. I won't spoil the plot. I can't even fully comprehend it. Its complexity cannot be adequately appreciated until I complete a novel version for all to read. I've already written 9,001 pages and I've barely touched 12% of the whole plot.

You see my friends, you MAKE the plot. The creators took a gamble and allowed YOU, the player of masterpieces, to create your own story. It leaves many plotholes on purpose for your imagination to fill in, making the replay value infinity. 

Beware, once you start this game you may contract a disease known as ""Large Dong"". I'll let the details be a surprise, but know that you won't want it to be cured. Keep napkins closeby as the female lead is a true Goddess. Her beautiful voice echoes forever in your mind and you'll spend the vast majority of the game not actually playing but searching for this divine Amazonian. She watches over the player giving advice and health/love potions from time to time. You'll fall in love with her soothing voice quickly, so be sure to listen to her. 

Make sure you check the map often. It really helps, the guards told me so and they've seen everything. Everything! Good luck sneaking by them. Additionally, they're incredibly handsome. If you find that you cannot contain your primitive lust I must warn you to be extremely careful when patting them down. The one named Jesom specifically likes his left ear stroked gently. Try it, you'll get a extra 15 gold. 

Play on, friends. This game is the greatest buy of my life, and I bought twelve ladyboys for a night.

[td]
Guise Of The Wolfは狼のように野生の勘を発揮しなければクリア出来ないゲームである.
一歩間違えると詰むアイテム配置、終盤の高難易度なパズルなど一筋縄では行かないだろう.
ジャンルがADVなので難易度を甘く見てしまうかも知れないが
高難易度なのでガイドなしのプレイはお勧め出来ない.

[h1]プラスポイント[/h1]
[u][b]●狼時の疾走感[/b][/u]
狼時に城内や雪山を駆け抜けるのは意外にも軽快で面白い.
狼時にドアを開けられないなどの不満点はあるが疾走感の方が勝る.

[h1]マイナスポイント[/h1]
[u][b]●理不尽なアイテム配置[/b][/u]
取り逃したら城から二度と出てこられなくなる斧、番兵から盗み取れる通貨など
普通にやっていてはまず見つからないアイテムが多すぎる.

このゲームの場合、[u][b]大量の樽の中に一つだけキーアイテムが入っていたりする事も
普通にあるので[/b][/u]全てのマップを隅々まで見て回る必要がある.

[u][b]●高難易度のパズル[/b][/u]
パズル要素は宝箱の開錠と終盤の神経衰弱の二つがあり
高難易度のパズルは神経衰弱になる.
これは4×５の神経衰弱を一回もミスをせずに揃えるという物だが簡単な事ではない.
余程記憶力に自信があるなら良いが、メモしながら地道に潰していった方が早く終わる.
[spoiler]時間がない、出来ないという人はクリア時のSSを撮ったので[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354384362] そちら [/url]を参照[/spoiler]

[td]総評[/td]
[td]
そのキーアイテムの入手難度から非常に単調で忍耐力を問われるゲームだが
移動が速い上に、マップ数が少ないので、苦行好きのある一定層には簡単に感じるだろう.
全くお勧め出来るゲームではないが、実績とカードが付いているので
投げられたり、バンドル入りしていたらやっても良いかもしれない.

Should i tell about the combat and stealth mechanics?... no they are not worth mentioning because not existend.

It's a shame because the concept is interesting, the atmosphere and lighting are good and i liked the music but you can't enjoy it with all the issues.

My only observations on this game have been said a million times before, buggy, terrible looking,  voice actin' is pretty bad, etc. Now I always laughed whenever I saw how deep the rabbit hole went in reference to these qualities, but I'm fairly sure not everyone will see it that way. 


Well, okay, it's soundtrack isn't.... Terrible. 


Point is, unless it's on sale, I wouldn't get it. Even when it's on sale, I would only get it if you're the kind of dude who likes laughing at bad game design. I guess you'll also get access to it's not so terrible music in the music player, and you can get some trading cards as well... So, um, yay? 


Maybe send it as a joke gift? I dunno.


Of course, this is all my opinion. Cross reference mine with others and see if it's a game for you, but it's certainly not on my reccomendations list (Even if I did enjoy it to some extent).

Sebbene la grafica stile ""cartoon 3D"" possa essere anche adatta ad un'avventura grafica, le collisioni con gli oggetti è trascurata (si passa attraverso alberi ed alcuni oggetti con la possibilità di rimanere incastrati).
La risoluzione non statica, ed alternando tra schermo intero e modalità finestra si presentano glitch grafici.
Le interazioni con i personaggi sono pressochè inesistenti, e si limiteranno a ripetere 3 frasi a ripetizione (nel caso delle guardie: ""Cosa pensi di fare?"", ""Avere una mappa aiuta"" ""Buonasera mylord"") o a dialoghi preimpostati.
La modalità ""stealth"" è ridicola, e si imposta semplicemente accovacciandosi premendo il tasto ""Ctrl"", mentre lo scassinare i forzieri non è una sfida impegnativa, e si potrà scassinare davanti alle guardie, sottraendo monete e restando impuniti.
Se una guardia vi vede trasformati in forma mannara, vi attaccherà, ma non appena la trasformazione scadrà e tornerete all'aspetto umano, proprio davanti agli occhi, smetterà di attaccarvi, tornando a ripetervi le solite tre frasi.
Le animazioni dei modelli 3D sono orribili, meccaniche ed innaturali, con spesso lo spawn dei personaggi prima della loro entrata in scena ed in luoghi che fisicamente sono incoerenti.
La stessa struttura del castello è irrealistica, con stanze e corridoi inutili anche per il castello più ""fantasy"" mai esistito.
La mappa non mostra la posizione in alcune stanze, ma soprattutto è il simbolo della irrazionalità ed illogicità della stessa trama di tutto il gioco. Perchè avere una mappa ""dettagliata"" se si è ""sopravvissuti"" ad un incidente? Perchè la stessa guardia ti impedisce di uscire dal castello, ma ti propone pure di andare a rubare liberamente nel castello stesso per esser pagato per lasciarti passare fuori? C'è molto altro, ed i dialoghi stessi sono, a tratti, di una ignoranza tale da rimanere senza parole.

Il concept del gioco è di per sè interessante, ma non vale il prezzo del gioco nemmeno in offerta.

СЮЖЕТ: в игре нам предлагается побываать в качестве алхимика, волей судьбы занесенного в замок графа в результате нападения на карету главного героя оборотня. Нам предстоит разобраться в истинных причинах случившегося и разгодать загадку появления мистического существа, остановившись в замке графа.
ИГРОВОЙ ПРОЦЕСС: бродим по замку и его подземельям, решаем немногочисленные головоломки, выполняем сюжетные задания (побочных квестов нет, если не считать получение достижений), превращаемся в оборотня, прячемся от оборотня, убиваем стражников или убегаем от них. Как и положено алхимику, ищем ингридиенты, создаем зелья. 
ПЛЮСЫ: звуковое сопровождение и графическое оформление некоторых частей замка, разные варианты концовки, возможность побывать оборотнем.
МИНУСЫ: небольшая продолжительность, линейность основной части сюжета, слишком простая и прослеживаемая сюжетная линия.

- Bugs everywhere
- See the positive commentary above. The reason why it's hilarious, is that it's sad you can't see or do much in your implemented map. Even though you are in the Dungeon or just in the Count Hall, you can't see your position in the map where you are going or standing.
- Voice actors in general
- The graphics could've been better
- No hints when and how pickpocketing the guards, bad tutorial at all
- Sound bug when being the werewolf
- The werewolf you encounter is really boring
- Boring lockpick mechanism

Tourner en rond alors que vous êtes devant une entrée, sans savoir qu'il s'agit d'une entrée est particulièrement frustrant, ou savoir qu'il faut se mettre accroupi derrière un garde pour... euh... lui voler quelque chose... Les sauts sont aussi particulièrement traîtres, et j'ai parfois refait certains sauts près d'une dizaine de fois, alors que cela n'aurait pas dû être si difficile. 
C'est, je pense, les éléments qui m'ont le plus frustré. C'est dommage, car j'ai apprécié les idées de base (cachées bien au fond derrière) derrière ce jeu, et le gameplay et le game-design seuls ont suffi à rendre mon bilan négatif.

And it has a lot of bugs. Surfaces arent fitting, the ""cell shade effect"" is a bad joke like the whole game etc.

The only reason why its not a big problem is the facth this game is so miserable you wont want to play it anyway.

I walked around on the first map 15 minutes cuz the game is so shockingly bad I forgot myself there. After that I left it run in the background to get the cards out of it so any game time beyond that was only for the cards.

I got this rubbish from a bundle thats why I can write about it without anger but it doesnt worth 1 cent. If u get a key for free give it to somebody u hate.

This is the best game I will ever play.  People owe it to themselves to load up GotW, and I'm a little disappointed Steam/Valve haven't bought it on behalf of every single Steam user.  The game has amazing graphics, fluid animation, wonderful mechanics, the best sound effects money can buy (the 'walking on wood' sound was so good I felt I was walking on water) and an atmospheric, chilling soundtrack.

I play this game every day.  Sometimes I pretend I'm actually the main character in person, skulking around the dark, moody castle (my bathroom), whilst other times I pretend to be Isabella and hide from everybody else, no matter how often they get upset and beg me to come out.

Here's my take on the in-game characters:

Laszlo's sadly dead from the start but that very discovery will make you tear up and suck you into the detailed plot.  Even dead characters here put other games' in the shade.

Filch Hoodwink has the misfortune of looking like a creepy child molester and having a name that people often mistake for 'Filth', which doesn't help matters.  It's a shame, really, as all he wants to do is eat juicy, juicy apples.  I've never met anybody that immediately wants to hold a conversation about them, but this man is positively apple obsessed and brings the subject up several times in the game.  He loves seeds too and will hand them out to anybody and everybody at parties.

Isabella, friendly soul, insists she'll be nearby and yet shows up a total of three times in the adventure (one of which involves being rescued at the end), for a combined screen time of probably a minute.  Curiously, despite the brief encounter(s) she seems to hint of a possible romance between the pair of you; Filch clearly doesn't do much for her and, frankly, who can blame her?

Artemis was born with a permanent Roger Moore-esque raised eyebrow which, I'm sure, led to a great deal of ridicule as a child (but fruitful experiences when he was old enough to discover women).  He has the deepest, villianiest voice I've ever heard which must be annoying when attempting to hide villainy motives.  In any case, I hope his sore throat clears up soon; I recommend Wrigley's 'Lockets' which have a lovely, gooey, honey centre.

The guards are all very helpful and uniform (which guards should be!), greeting you cheerfully and pointing you towards your map.  If I found a real guard like this I would want to shake his hand quite firmly for a minimum of no less than five seconds, or until he asked me to stop.

Kitchen Wench™.  Unknown motive(s); one suspects cooking food.  Prone to panic.  Prone to face collapsing when killed to death.

I refuse to comment on the wolf itself as overexposure will diminish its quite dramatic entrance.  All I can say is this: once you see it, you will never forget.  Isn't that what we all strive for in life?  I know I do.

I'd like to address some laughable 'negative' points I've come across, both here on Steam and elsewhere:

Stealth.  The stealth system is actually nuanced and in-depth.  Each guard has their weapon on display at all times and an unsuccessful pat down of their bottoms will result in a major tongue-lashing.  I can't explain the sheer euphoria I felt when I managed to steal a key to a dungeon; something I can only claim to have done a handful of times before in real life.  The fact this genre-busting mechanic isn't documented anywhere within the game is entirely the point; you have to get into your character and into the mindset.  Don't be lazy; explore, probe, discover, learn.  Fondle.

Now, I'm puzzled by the negativity in regards to the black outlines.  They are perfect.  They are us.  They accurately convey the darkness we all have in our souls which is, presumably, why Filch 'Filth' Hoodwink is completely encased in blackness at one point.  To remove these outlines is to remove a part of ourselves.  Even the scenery needs these lines; nature can be unforgiving and cruel.

Another gripe seems to be in regards to objects, and the fact many can be walked through.  All I can say is this: if you were trying to hide from a werewolf, I think you'd be thankful you could hide inside a large rock or tree!

Overall, you must buy this game.  This is not a request and it makes me weep to know there are genuine, decent people out there deprived of this experience.",1395945663,1395945663,True,187,62,0.499509871006011963,42,False,False,False,False,,,

Not Stephenie Meyer's shape-shifting pet poodles, or the wolf anthros that plaster Furaffinity, Tumblr and DeviantART; the horror werewolves that made the werewolf the legendary creature it is today. And I'm sure you are too! But I just can't help but feel that this is a cash-in on one of horror's most venerated creatures.

When I first started Identity of the Canine, it was good enough for an indie game. The atmosphere of some serious faecal matter was about to happen was great and the controls were intuitive enough that I didn't need to reference the controls at all. Then it came to an abrupt halt when I was rudly told at the front gate that I had to look for some special item. Scrounging around the countryside (if it can be called that) of naked trees with a ridiculous cartoony outline for about 45 minutes, I finally found an axe in the least probable area one would expect to find it: Lodged on the opposite area of the map where the logging cabin was! Suffice it to say that it was one of the most jarring treasure-hunts for the most basic item that shattered the suspension of disbelief. But a voice in my head said, ""Be nice. It is their first game. They at least took your advice to take out the irrelevant jump-scares.""

I was starting to wonder why I listened to that voice in the first place until I saw the highlight of the gaming year so far - a poorly voiced Russian princess (who oddly has a Spanish name and British-American accent) with a shocking taste in clothing and historical accuracy, and a comical outline that gave her the hint of a five o' clock shadow. After I finally stopped laughing if only to save my underpants, I began laughing at the dialogue structure. It's so clichèd with the genre and roles of the characters that I had to step out for five minutes to calm down. It's not totally asinine, though. There is a nichè choice structure that at least changed the next piece of dialogue, but for the sake of the chair and linen - I muted the sound. The magic-man behind bars was a similar story, though his voice acting was at least a cut above the rest. The Count wasn't much better than either, and his lines screamed of his role in the story. Probably the most organic lines came from the guard to the front door, and that was just plain flat. But I calmly reminded myself that Shape of the Lupine was still an indie game.

I know I said the controls were tight and intuitive enough that I didn't need to look up the controls again, but the gameplay itself was like the graphics - patchy, glitchy and unforgiving at best, and nightmarish cluster-bomb on common sense's front doorstep at worst. Getting chased by the hairy attack dog was a nice shot of adrenaline through the game, but its appearances give you no option to escape or hide other than the linear chase prescribed by the developers. One chase even has you charging TOWARD the werewolf when there are no less than three good hiding spots to wait for the hulking mastiff to pass on. And no less than five times did I think, ""Hang on. There are windows around with moonlight coming through, and I have an axe which smashes through baricades. Why can't I fight the poodle?"" I discovered the answer after being savaged for the umpteenth time: because it's not using your brain. I know that the protagonist is a brainiac in his own little lunch-box, but we, the cruel angels of fate, are not. By this point, I was thoroughly outraged I spent $15 on a game worth about $7 for its cheap laughs and wacky graphics. But brace yourself for a shock, because there are some things that did go right. Just enough to bump its worth up to a possible $8.50.

The fact that you can turn into a werewolf, if only for two minutes and in set checkpoints of moonlight, is really what gives a credible note to the game. It was a nice little feature but it sucks in that the only combat takes place in wolf form. Even then, it's you - the unstoppable pet bulldog of The Hulk - against a scared guardsman just following orders. Horror games like Outlast and Amnesia have little, if any, combat, but it's done well! You can run, you can stun, you can hide, you can be savaged and wait for the beasties to pass on post-mortem - not follow blind instructions to the letter by running down a hall and pressing the ""I Won the Race"" button. Taking a chunk out of the guards was oddly satisfying in its own demented way, but I soon felt guilty after killing the most human and realistic characters in the game.

I still think it was a damn shame that you couldn't take a chunk out of the characters that mattered to the wearily predictable plot. You have so many stereotypes packed into each character that you can judge their role just by looking at them - the cursed love interest (if you hadn't worked that out within the first ten minutes, you were probably too busy staring at her incredibly well-endowed bosum), the bad guy with a name, the deus ex chamberpot, the bored guard, the scared castle hand, the self-insert know-it-all-but-can't-remember-a-thing protagonist, the.... Oh wait, that's the list. They're so riddled with nits and bullet-holes that it's hard to sympathise with any of the characters. Hard at best and frustratingly difficult at worst, but it is possible. I did find myself at one point going, ""Awww.... Poor Filch."" Though it still doesn't excuse the fact that he only shows up once in a while to say a few lines, give you a book and reveal his backstory, only to leave you hanging for the puzzles. The princess is about as useless as you would expect as anything other than the protagonist's love-interest McGuffin, and the Count's plan was sure to backfire from stage one. I'm sure it sounded great to the drunk, semi-literate peasant farmer who the Count discussed the plans with, but he could have at least planned it with someone along the lines of Caesar or Alexander to get the kinks out

For those cheaky strumpets that skipped right to the bottom: A good game this is not. Good and Likeness of the Wild Tundra Dog just don't mix. Not bad for what it's worth, but just not good! By all means, get it in a sale or for the cheap laughs or if only for the fact it has werewolves in it, but not for something serious.",1392709544,1392718513,False,85,0,0.746459305286407471,6,True,False,False,False,,,

I found myself intrigued about this game being about werewolves. But the story really fell flat on it's face. There is no real substance or engagement in the very brief storytelling. After being given a screen telling you the controls; you're unceremoniously plopped in a field with no clear objective what to do. That theme continued throughout the game.

For being a puzzle based game; the puzzles themselves are easy and short. Having to navigate from objective to objective is numbly frustrating. I found myself consulting the community guides just to find out where to go next, as the game will not tell you. The game itself is very short, easily beaten in one sitting after you understand your objectives. The only real challenge, as I said, is figuring out where to go next on your own with no hints.

There are no game settings. You get one setting and that's it. My XBOX controller half worked in the beginning. But, glitch after glitch, I gave up and went back to the keyboard and mouse. And even that didn't fully work. I didn't experience any game-breaking bugs. But, the glitches and sub-par programming will annoy you.

Boring story (surprise, surprise), useless inventory model, stupid Key-Door mechanics which requires the same action (inventory - use key - on door) to be performed several times through the game on the very same door, FPS limited to WASD+LMB and instakill (guards are more stupid than doors), long loading time for such small locations like a guest room (wtf guys, reminds me ""Bloodlines"" when it was just shipped).

There should have at least been a cutscene introduction on par with the ending cutscene of the game. (don't get me started on the quality of the ending cutscene, but at least a cutscene to explain what is going on is nessesary!!!)

With no true direction (or clue) to where to find your current target objective (due to a lack in informative begining), you might decide to follow the blood trail to a horse.  Thats it for the clues beyond that. You are then greeted with the option to head for the gates, only to be told that you are missing something.  now with no sense of injury or purpose, you then are left to wander the cold wilderness in an attempt to find the corpse of a character that is literally meaningless to the plot due to no introduction or other such information.

You are then greeted with yet another way the game decides to illustrate story.  By walking up to the gate, it immediately warps you to a bed chamber and a talk to a literal stick of a human being.  The characters that ARE present in the game, are emotionless and look like they are incredibly dated (probably inspired by 2001 time period character models) HELL THATS BEING GENEROUS!

Regardless, the options are bland, they don't have any apparant meaning for either selection of choice, and the voices seem remarkably quiet and uninspired.  And this is constant through the game, when you actually do get choices for dialogue.

The game play is dated, adventure games have come along way since this rustic example of old school room escape games.  (even in those games, the items you used to solve the puzzles disappeared out of your inventory.)  Instead, the items you collect kinda serve to guide you as a gauge for how much longer you have to suffer through the game.

The tutorial consists of a help file that opens from the options, or in the start of the game.  And even that tutorial does not actually explain some of the mechanics of the game (LIKE THE STEALING MECHANIC!)  Its ambiguous, and not intuitive.  There should have been a small, subtle example of each mechanic as the game introduces them to you, but it never does explain anything in the game.  It doesn't even have a story that really truely explains what exactly is going on.

The story is there, but its vague, and rarely seen.  The journal entry literally gives a hint as to your next direction, and that is your only motivation to do much of anything.  Its rediculous.

The stealth mechanics are terrible.  There are two spaces in the game where you are actually supposed to hide from the crappy looking werewolf.  TWO.  And one of the doesn't work.  Those two specific instances don't even really add to the tense atmosphere that was supposed to be there.  one of them was out right  broken, and I ended up solving the area, by grabbing the cog, and dying only to appear back at the ladder with the cog in my inventory.  The stealing in the game is effortless and in general unessesary outside of two times due to the lack of need for anymore than 200 gold pieces.  You only need to steal a minimum of 3 times.  And when you do need to steal, there is no indicator as to where and who you need to steal from.  Good luck guessing on a first playthrough.

There is no sneaking in the game.  There is no descernable combat in the game.  There are very small amounts of platforming, and the puzzles are actually few and far in between.  Its mostly collection oriented situations.  ""Man I would like an apple."" - go get apple- ""Thanks, here is a key to the door to continue the game."" - rinse and repeat.

The music, is good.  The music is actually well done, and probably the only thing worth-while in this game. After this dev team is disolved I hope that the music artist will get a job somewhere else.

The end cutscene in the game looks and runs like a damn story board.  The art is half assed because it looks genuinely un finished.  If you ever watch a story boarding session for disney or something, you will see how this cutscene runs.  Its insulting.

I paraphrased alot of what the issues are with the game.  And if you realy want to see how bad it is, then check out my youtube channel for the whole playthrough of the game. In closing, the game is not worth a penny, its clearly an early alpha build at best.  I spent some of my time trying to figure out how to unlock myself from the terrain I clipped through, or figuring out how to get back into the level after moving through it.  Bad game is bad, and this one is just terrible.  Not worth the time, not worth the money, and a disappointing addition to the ever small selection of werewolf titles.

Devs, you asked me to play the demo for you, and you got my hopes up, and you got me excited.  I jumped in to green light this game, I spoke highly of it for you people.  And then you do me this.  I am sorry for sounding brutal, but I am honest.  You mislead anyone that believes your description of the game.  Half of the description for the game in the steam advertisement section, is either pulling for strings in an effort to sell the game to folks, or outright lying.  This game is terrible, and I am not happy that I jumped and spent money on this title.  Anyone that bought it, needs to go and demand steam refund the purchase.

If you are one of the two people (at the time of this review) who gave this game a thumbs up (despite the 4/10 from one of you), you should come chat with me so I can show you some actual good games to play to put this game into some perspective.  That or I would be lead to believe that you were paid to give your shallow praises for the game.

Bad show devs... bad show.  I want my money back.  I would suggest you either take this game off the steam roster, or drop the price to free to play.  This is (at the time of this review) a 15 dollar purchase.

Объективных достоинств мало, тем более, что их хватит ненадолго. Любителей классического готического сеттинга может впечатлить начало: венгерский замок 17-ого века, истории про оборотней, красивый снегопад во внутреннем дворе. Одним словом -  интригует (обманчиво). Здесь раскрывается, пожалуй, главный и, возможно, единственный удавшийся аспект в игре: за счет бедных технологий, начало показывает весьма атмосферную визуализацию. Музыка тоже - простая, но атмосферная.

Такое вступление временно отводит глаза геймера от кривого геймплея, устаревшей лет на 10 графики, кучи багов (застревания в ступеньках и пр.), даже от бреда, который творится в дневнике главного героя и персонажей с плоскими предсказуемыми речами. Интерефейс ужасный. Если честно, здесь плохо практически все. Мир трещит по швам.

Понятно, что разработчик скорее всего практически в одиночестве кроптел над проектом и не мог создать наполненный и интересный игровой мир. Но когда  реализация, казалось бы неплохой идеи, настолько убога, что играть после полутора часов хождений по ""глухим"" и скучным локациям уже надоедает, стоит задуматься над смыслом релиза игры как платного дистрибутива. Слово ""Инди"" как жанровая принадлежность нагло льстит этой игре и просто добавляет ей покупателей, ведь на самом деле никакой независимой идеи она не несет - игра является бедным и неинтересным квестом с кучей нереализованных возможностей.

Rating: Poor

This game was a bit of a disappointment. When a game implements a certain style and feel it should be done right and with lots of details. This game fails to achieve just that and fails to deliver. It just feels not done and rushed, and those things keep it from being an enjoyable game. A few examples:

It starts with the resolution itself, some weird low-res 1000 x 800, not widescreen but not 4:3 either. The graphics are cell-shaded but done very generic and it looks just bad. The effects for water, fire and particles are dx6 or something. 

The sound is also not very good and sound rather cheap. The voices are rather cheesy and lipsinc is not in sync (understatement).  Music is ok but gets annoying quickly.

When you move it feels like you are very small because you are a bit close to the ground. You interact with things when your dot changes to a hand. That's about it what you can do. 

The story is a bit weird; you wake up outside a castle, run around a bit and faint again, wake up and look at a pre-2000 character model that asks you questions and it feels like they know a lot about you although they just found you outside the gate. Pretty weird.

The story path is very linear, just look up things and use then to pass a gate. That's about it. Plenty of better games around and I suggest  you stay away from this 'game'.",1390600305,1424002132,False,1259,4,0.80328446626663208,2,False,False,False,False,,,
