O estilo visual e artístico é muito bom, assim como os efeitos sonoros. Algumas trilhas da OST são bem marcantes também, enquanto outras nem tanto. A trama apresenta vários personagens que você pode escolher pra jogar a campanha principal, cada um com uma história inicialmente diferente, e que se cruzam da metade pro final do jogo.

Apesar de ter um início lento, cada fase tem uma ideia central, com mecânicas características que ajudam a dar uma variada na gameplay. Nem sempre é uma ideia boa, mas eu gosto bastante desse aspecto no jogo, e isso engrena de vez da metade pro fim. As lutas contra chefes (não todas) podem ser bem empolgantes também, sendo bem satisfatório aprender os padrões de ataque. Outro ponto positivo é o fato de que, apesar de se inspirar em Sonic, as fases não se resumem a apenas acelerar de um modo que eu mal consigo ver detalhes das fases e dos inimigos, isso é um ponto extremamente positivo pra mim.

O principal problema que eu tive com o jogo foi a duração das fases. Todas exageradamente longas, cada uma levando em torno de uns 20 minutos de duração, se você for uma pessoa como eu que gosta de procurar por segredos e explorar bem. As cutscenes do jogo podem ser bem maçantes e com um humor que eu particularmente não gosto muito. Além disso, o tutorial o jogo dá uma impressão de que há vários recursos para utilizar no combate, mas, pelo menos na personagem que eu joguei (Milla), só precisei de um único ataque para todos os inimigos durante o jogo todo. Todos os outros eram bem descartáveis e não tão úteis.

Um bom jogo de plataforma 2D, uma evolução significativa em relação ao primeiro, mas longe de ser perfeito. Ainda assim, recomendo para aqueles períodos de intervalo entre um jogo grande e outro. E se acabar curtindo muito, há bastante conteúdo, com histórias separadas para cada personagem, e uma certa variação na gameplay.",1710293572,1710294014,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Sequels are never easy, even more so when the original is so beloved. Balancing the things that made the original great with innovations that make a sequel stand out is a difficult act, and not one every studio can succeed at. When done poorly, players just get more of the same, or in the worst cases, a whole that is lesser than the sum of its parts. When done well, players get a fresh experience that iterates on the original's successes while avoiding its flaws.

Freedom Planet, a love-letter to the 16-bit era, was one such beloved title, and the developers had their work cut out for them. With such a fantastic first entry, the sequel would need to do so much more, while still keeping the spirit of the original intact. A seven-year development period followed, and at long last, the game was released. But how did it do? Was it a fantastic follow-up to the original, or does it fall short--

Of course it's good. It's really good. It's so good. It's one of the best 2D platformers, period. We can cut the theatrics now.

Almost everything the first game did, the second game does just as well, if not better. The artwork is more detailed and thematic, and the visual effects are fantastic. The gameplay is refined far beyond the first game, giving the characters a new array of well-balanced abilities that give them versatility without making them more powerful. Every character is fun to play. Nearly every stage flows immaculately, even on a first play. The mechanics are beautifully balanced, allowing for a surprising degree of player expression without any blatantly overpowered options. The sound effects are great, and the voice acting is as well. The music is thematic and fits the setting perfectly. The story, probably the most contentious part of both games, has a great degree of depth and thought put into it, and it avoids the tonal and pacing issues of the first game's.

The game has been out for two years or so now, but I bought it a little bit later. I just got around to writing a review because I couldn't find the right words to accurately express how good this game is. Even this barely scratches the surface of how I feel. There's so much to it, I couldn't possibly cover it all.

Are you on the fence if you should buy this game? Here's a quick guide:
* [b]Did you enjoy the first Freedom Planet?[/b] This game is everything you could ever want in a sequel and more. You should buy FP2.
* [b]Did you not enjoy the first Freedom Planet?[/b] FP2 improves the weak aspects of FP1 while improving the strong ones. You should buy FP2.
* [b]Have you not played Freedom Planet?[/b] FP2 is a great game, even on its own. You should buy FP2.
* [b]Do you enjoy the games of a certain blue-quilled mascot?[/b] FP2 isn't the same, but it's similar, and it's very good. You should buy FP2.
* [b]Do you enjoy 2D platformers at all?[/b] FP2 is a good 2D platformer. You should buy FP2.
* [b]Do you hate fun?[/b] FP2 might change your mind. You should buy FP2.
* [b]Do you hate Steam and/or PC gaming?[/b] The console releases are coming up very soon! You should buy FP2.
* [b]Are you not represented by this list?[/b] Now you are. Also, you should buy FP2.

Also, there's a free sample version of the first stage, so try that out! The full game is even better.

The music, especially, is something really special.

Right now i'm at my second playthrough, and its still as fun as the first one. Having 4 very distinct playable characters makes the replayability really good too.
The difficulty is also very well balanced. The system itself is pretty creative, you can equip and unequip items to change your level of difficulty on the overworld map, when you feel like it.

The only negative things I can say about this game is that:
1- *SOME* cutscenes are, I think, a bit cringe or too long for nothing

The levels are all so much fun and enjoyable to get through, there wasn't a single one that I though was bad. The spritework in each of them is gorgeous, every song in every level is so insanely good and the level design is so well made. Seriously, there was one level in particular that was absolutely massive and had quite a lot of puzzles, and it took 28 minutes for me to beat it, and yet it didn't feel like it took that long at all, I was actually surprised when I looked at the timer and saw the time, I was having so much fun I didn't see it pass.

The bosses are all so great and enjoyable to fight now, especially with the addition of the guard/dodge in this game. This one move completely erased all of the problems I had with a portion of the bosses from FP1. Now when I get hit by an attack I think ""Damn it, I should have dodged that"" instead of ""There was no possible way I could've avoided that, bullshit"". I also absolutely LOVE how, when you're defeated in a fight, you can use a stock to choose to either go back to the last checkpoint with full health to try the fight again from the start or you can revive yourself immediately with a tiny amount of health and resume the fight. This completely eliminates any kind of possible frustration that there could've been from nearly defeating a boss, but then getting hit at the last second and having to do it all over again, as it allows the player to have control over that and have him choose what would be the best play. I've never seen a game do that before and it's such an incredibly INGENIUS idea. 

The story is just SO much better than the first one. It's so engaging and interesting, you're just constantly at the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next and you just never know. The characters are all so well written and awesome, and the voice acting is so well done.

I could go on and on about how fucking fantastic this game, it's seriously a masterpiece, and I'll remember it as one of the best I have ever played.

......good one. 

The story is not sexual at all, even if some fans might wish it was. As a non-furry this game gets my seal approval for it's great chiptune soundtrack, insane amount of quality and variety in levels, enemies and bosses. There is some jank when levels zoom out as they get pixelated from not having different levels of detail, you can tell that because they didn't want to waste money so the scope of the game could be massive for a 12 hour Sonic-like game. One more praise I'll also give it is I didn't expect a Sonic-clone to have some bosses that feel like that could have come from more souls-like centric games. 

You can also play as any of the 4 cast of characters, so replay value if you care. But getting to play as a dragon that's main attack is using her hair is just too badass. I hope to see a sequel, as I'm now a fan and hopefully not a.....

 It's incredibly fun to play, all the characters feel different and the level design compliments them very well. I enjoyed the story, and the way it sets up some levels makes them far more enjoyable and memorable. The various hubs you can visit in Adventure Mode are great to hangout in and the npcs really make the world feel lived in. The world map is cute and also really helps all of Avalice feel connected. The music is absolutely amazing and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the levels. There's also so many fun side modes like sparring with other characters, boss rematches, and various challenges. 

[u] [h3] Some specific things I liked [/h3] [/u]

Some items like the ""Life Oscillation"" one are pretty cool and fun to use. 

Dragon Valley is a fantastic starting stage, the level flows well and the art and music are phenomenal!

[spoiler] Globe Opera really feels like it's going to be the final part of the game and does an amazing job of tricking you into thinking that, despite all the evidence that it's not the final part. [/spoiler]

The Floating Island Map has especially wonderful art and music, I could sit on that screen for hours! (to be honest most of the world map makes me feel like that, but the Floating Island map is probably my favorite)

[spoiler] Tidal Gate's placement in the story could not be better. After the high-stakes and stress of the prior stages, Tidal Gate is a beautiful stage that feels open and gives you a breather. The music for Tidal Gate is also fun and energetic, further helping lessen the tension from the previous stages. (having Parusa and the Floating Island in the background really sparks the urge to explore them too!) [/spoiler]

The in-stage character dialogue is charming and makes each stage it's in feel like an active part of the story.

[spoiler] The gallery is really cool and the reward for rebuilding all the exhibits is awesome! [/spoiler]

[spoiler] The secret final level is great and it's central mechanic really stands out! It's boss is also amazing with a great callback to Brevon in both the fight and its music. [/spoiler]

[u] [h3] Some specific things I didn't like as much [/h3] [/u]

The ranking system is neat, but it could definitely use some changes to allow defeating enemies and collecting crystals to contribute to getting a high rank, as opposed to just using the brave stones and ignoring everything.

I'm pretty sure the way you earn the time capsules was a result of running out of dev time, but it's still unfortunate they're only obtainable in the Battlesphere.

Incredibly minor thing but I wish you could toggle whether the Battlesphere boss rematches would use the Battlesphere tiles and background or their original tiles and backgrounds. Some of the boss fights just don't look as cool and clash a bit with the Battlesphere tiles. 

[u] [h3] Final thoughts [/h3] [/u]
There's so much I like about this game that I didn't mention here, I don't think a single review does it justice! If you're on the fence about this game, give it a try! I couldn't recommend it enough! (it also has a demo if you just want to try that!) Also GalaxyTrail is still fixing bugs and adding stuff which is awesome!

Ignore my playtime, almost all of my playtime was when I had no internet. I have finished the game as Lilac and Carol.

I think for how closely I followed the development of this game, for how much of an absolute fucking reply guy I was in Sabrina DiDuro's and GalaxyTrail's tweets just expressing how hype I was for this game, I have done a disservice for not writing a review sooner.

Let me start by saying, I do not consider either of these games 'Sonic' games, and their identity should not be likened to Sonic. They are wholly different experiences that only ultimately share the very baseline DNA of 'Going Fucking Hard' with the blue blur. With that said, Freedom Planet 1 was, for many years of my life, what i considered 'The Best Sonic Game'--if Sonic made a game exactly like Freedom Planet, just with a sonic skin and sonic-themed movesets, it would probably still not be as fun as Freedom Planet. I've played Freedom Planet 1 so many fucking times, at this point, it's probably more than I've ever played Cave Story.

Freedom Planet 2 is [i] so insanely superior to the first game that i don't even know where to begin. [/i] After completing Lilac's story, I said, holy fuck, I feel like I got my money's worth and a half. I can't bang out a run of FP2 in one day like I can FP1, but that's more than okay to me. The game is immaculate. If you played Freedom Planet 1 and you thought to yourself, damn, this can't get better, well, TOO BAD, MORON, because [b] apparently it can. [/b] The combat feels better, the characters have all received a massive glow up that makes them so much more fun to play that after playing this game, I don't think I *can* go back to Freedom Planet 1. 

Much like Freedom Planet 1, the crown jewel of this game is Lilac. With new moves that interact with her dash, the ability to uppercut out of a jump, and her cyclone no longer taking any meter, it's like Freedom Planet 1 was you playing the game with fucking training wheels. Carol and Milla are both very fun to play in this game, way better than they were in the first game. Had Lilac stayed the same as she was in FP1, I would not be able to pick a favorite. However, for all the improvements made to Carol and Milla, Lilac matched those in spades. If I had one complaint with this game, it's that Lilac is *too fun.* She makes me not want to play as the other characters, because even though they ARE fun, Lilac is so well designed I start to feel like everything in the platformer genre was just the buildup to Sash ""Lilac Freedom Planet 2"" Lilac.

One other complaint I would say I have, unfortunately, I don't think Neera is very fun at all. The power character type is interesting, but I don't feel like she does anything particularly useful with it and she doesn't make fighting feel any more satisfying than it does with Carol, and neither of them are as fun as Lilac. Even so, at her worst, she is still inherently fun to move around with like the others.

The soundtrack to FP2 is, much like the first game, an absolute fucking banger. Just amazing all around. Like, if I had to make any criticisms, it's that Merga's motif isn't quite as good as Brevon's. The storytelling in this game is also far better than it was in FP1, managing to stick a lot closer to the tone I think they intended. There are still a few moments, jokes mainly, that I don't think landed, but at the end of the day I think the game does a much better job, though I do think while Merga is a great villain, she does somewhat live in the shadow of Brevon and how perfect he was.

My only other complaint regarding the story of this game is something I hope can be adressed in Freedom Planet 3, provided it happens. There will be some story spoilers for the ending of Lilac's story ahead, so just, you know, read at your own risk.

The ending clarifying and establishing Lilac and Carol's relationship as a romantic one is something I'm sort of conflicted about. In my head, when I think about it, I like this relationship. It makes sense. They're cute together. However, unfortunately, this is only really something that extends into my head. Part of the plot of FP2 is based on Carol going off on her own and getting into trouble, and Lilac and Carol having these repeated disagreements that put strain on their relationship. This makes sense and I think is a good hardship that the two overcoming helps them understand their feelings for each other better, but my real issue comes in the fact that we unfortunately only see them disagree and fight. There are so few scenes in Freedom Planet 1 or 2 where the two of them are shown to be friends, to know each other well and get along in a way that isn't specifically a team rally declaring that they can do anything. Off the top of my head, I can only think of the scene where they're watching the movie in the first game, and even then, part of that is based on Milla, and more serves to establish Milla as a friend of Carol and Lilac, but not actually doing much in terms of the friendship between Carol and Lilac specifically. To be clear, I don't say this because I want to pick apart the writing of this game, I just want the relationship between the two protagonists to be as good as possible because I love these games. I hope for the future of the series, we can see more interactions of the two of them just being... friends. Lovers too, of course, but I think first and foremost friends.",1701466945,1701467035,True,6,1,0.532283961772918701,1,False,False,False,True,,,

The personality changes are nonsensical to the point where they just don't feel like the same characters anymore, and the soundtrack is nowhere near as good as the first game. The ONLY improvement is the look of the stages (Not the stage layouts) and even then not all of them.

Even the level design feels off and wrong.

I think the biggest thing for me is that the game feels like its trying to make combat the major focus and its not what i came to the first one for. It doesn't feel in depth enough for it and i feel takes away from the platforming terribly.

Though there is one thing I miss and that comes mostly from the story. Don't get me wrong, the story is good, better even, but it is does lack what I would call ""unapologetic confidence"". An unfiltered desire to impress, to show something beyond cool without even considering second guessing yourself. Something that was in every SEGA in the Dreamcast era. Some might call it ""camp"", but most would call it ""cringe"", so I am most likely in the minority.

Gameplay; A nice improvement across the board. Overall I found myself less energy starved, which would sometimes break the sense of flow because I had to wait around for my energy to refill. They brought carefully though out solution to the problem of 1 and 2 is a much better game because of it:
[list]
  [*]Lilac: She barely changed, but what they added to her I can't live without now. No being able to cancel Dragon Boast was an obvious flaw which they fixed gracefully with Boost Breaker. An awesome offensive tool to boot.
  [*]Carol: She is now fun to play as without her bike! And it won't break either! Wild kick has been replaced with a bladed disk (or her bike if she has it) and, while I sorta miss Wild Kick, it it a great offence tool that now double as a movement tool. Not to mention a cool way to go on and out of her bike. She desperately needed a movement tool, and they gave her the most fitting one.
  [*]Milla: A complete overall from 1 and she is very fun to control now. Her cube still fill her offensive, defensive and movement needs, but does it so in a more frantic way. She can pack a punch now and she can summon her cube instantly now. She is now harder and more fun to master and on par with the others. All that without sacrificing what made her unique.
  [*]Neera: The newcomer. She is the simplest one of the cast. Fun to control and the easiest to build up speed with and her running attack. She is supposed to be the power character, but I found her attack to be a bit awkward to land. Still a fun character to play as that convoy personality in her moveset just like the others.

SPOİLER ALERT !!!



Hikayeye gelirsek kötü adamı fazla beğendiğimi söyleyemem, Merga konusunda hayal kırıklığına uğradığım:Ben onu acımasız ve başarılı birisi olarak bekliyordum, gel gör ki oyunda magister'ın bize ""en büyük korkumuz"" diye hitap ettiği bu kötü karakterin oyunun sonlarında bakunawa ile ay'ı patlatmaya kalkışmak ve shang tu sarayını ele geçirmek dışında ""aslında sarayı ele geçiren askal lol"" başarılı bir olayı yoktu.
Mesela ilk oyundaki Lord Brevon amacına ulaşmak adına bütün Shuigang krallığını öldürüp bütün krallıkları birbirine düşürürek gezegenin enerji kaynağını çalmayı başarmıştı, aynı zamanda kendisi ana karakterimizi işkenceyle neredeyse öldürüyordu.
ayrıca ilk oyundaki olaylardan 3 yıl sonra halk'ın ilk oyundaki Lord Brevon'ın büyük istilasını yalanlaması zırvalıktan başka bir şey değil,dediğim gibi bu adam bütün krallıkları birbirine düşürüp bütün gezegen'in enerji kaynağını çalmayı başarmış birisiydi.

Onun dışında karakterler ve dialogları fena değildi fakat Merga'nın çıktığı sahneler dışında oyunun ilk oyundaki ciddiliğin yanına bile yaklaşamadığını fark ettim.

The rest of the game is good, but the combat sucks so, so bad. There's a reason Street Fighter doesn't have Sonic ice physics. Adding a dedicated parry button makes things a bit better, but the parry button does absolutely jack when enemy attacks have so few startup frames or run for several seconds dealing damage every frame. You read something wrong and you can take half bar off of a single attack.

Combat works in Sonic because your character is mostly hurtbox, and enemies mostly aren't, so the slippy slidey physics don't feel too punishing. Here, it's reversed. The hurtboxes on your attacks are tiny, and enemies are mostly hurtbox most of the time, so trying to hit a foe feels like sticking your hand into a tumble dryer full of syringes.

Some characters have a slightly better kit for combat, but they take the joy out of platforming. You can also use equipment---but you'd better not use it too early, because it decreases the rate at which you earn the currency needed to buy equipment.

I really wanted to like this, but I did not.

However, you might.

Freedom Planet 2 is in every way an improvement on its predecessor. It's a little more smooth. A little more interesting. A little more comfortable in its own skin.

The voice acting is still really solid, and the plot's a little more engaging---though it's still Sonic OC stuff, so if that bothered you the first time around, it'll bother you here as well. The's art's stellar, and there's some great, extremely articulated sprites. There's even a world map, although the game locks you into episodes so it's not quite free roam.

If the first game clicked with you, you'll have a fantastic time here. I know there's folks for which the combat feels natural and interesting---you might be one of those.

I'd recommend trying the first game first, especially since this one doesn't recap much plot, and I hope it does well enough that we get a third game for me to try and also bounce off the controls of.

Edit: Found a combination of equipment that works for me, and this makes the difficulty level feel far more normal. You have to progress enough to get the equipment, so the first half of the game ends up being weirdly harder than the second half, but getting pinballed around into seven million hurtboxes feels less bad when you have literally any iframes. There's still some odd choices for stages (really, really slow puzzle levels that drag on for 15--20 minutes), but less risk of getting walled by a boss at the end of one, and the stages that do feel good feel really good. There's some extremely clever level and boss design that was getting obfuscated by the high difficulty. This review is still a thumbs up, but now a much less cautious one. It's not like FP1, where even on easy fights were absolutely brutal.

2nd Edit: Absolutely not. Good god that's seven phases on the final boss and it turns into a tohou at the end. Slippy slidey butter physics feel miserable against something that's playing like an MVC tournament Zero. It's more interesting and beatable than the boss of FP1, but I'm not gonna grind it.

Considering FP1 was originally a Sonic fan game, and then comparing it to FP2, it's a straight 5:1 improvement on a galactic scale. Everything is leaps and bounds better: story, pacing, character gameplay, level design, enemies, graphics, art diversity, world expansion, and voice acting. There is no singular element that wasn't massively overhauled to improvement while fitting with their new designs.

Gameplay:
All characters--sans Lilac, I think--got overhauls to their gameplay kit to make them unique, but also much more fun and capable to play. Each character has various methods of attacking, and they all have different mobility options.

While Lilac plays largely the same, she gained the Guard function like all of the characters, but hers comes with a character-specific dash attached to it.

Carol got a *massive* gameplay improvement overall, primarily to her motorcycle functionality. She is also wildly faster than the first game, so she no longer feels miserable to play off of her bike. I actually played most of the game off of it, and didn't practice with it, and I never felt like she was 'slow' because of. I enjoyed her playthrough a lot.

There's a big emphasis on speedrunning this game, as well as multiple difficulties, and further ways to challenge yourself or make it easier. If you are not into this game's difficulty, you can set it to easy and use items and potions to make it even more accessible. You will NOT miss any story if you decide to do this; nothing is locked behind Hard Mode, etc.

Milla has also received gameplay improvements, though I didn't play her in the first game. She has a shield, multiple ranged options, a float, but is relatively slow on the baseline mobility. This isn't actually an issue, and she is actually capable of beating stage times faster than Lilac when you use the various techniques available in her kit to maintain speed. I'm not finished with her playthrough, yet.

Neera is the new character, and her gameplay was actually quite enjoyable. She has the simplest method of acceleration, and an incredible horizontal mobility available to her. While her combat kit has more of a 'stand your ground' feel to it, she has some interesting tools that can help her out in situations. Like the other characters, she has variances in her kit that make her better or worse than others, depending on the situation/boss.

Story:
All cutscenes, and including in-between stage dialogue, are fully voice acted. The voice acting has improved a lot since FP1 for each character returning. There is some incredibly emotional deliveries by several characters, showcasing their range and skill. The story itself is quite expansive, namely building the world, and continuing from the first game with a lot of cohesion. The writing of the dialogue is strong to every character's personality and presentation, and no one feels ""dumb"" or out of place in how they respond to situations. This is used to be both comical, and serious, at times. Each character has special interactions with other characters in their own playthroughs, and additional cutscenes the others won't see. For example, Lilac has more/special interactions with Merga, while Carol has additional ones with Corazon. Due to some timing of how missions play out in the sequence in each story, characters will have perspectives from different cutscenes in different places, even. They really put a lot of effort into fleshing this out, and it shows. As for the totality of the story, it's not bad. Some might find it generic, but it's very polished otherwise.

The addition of Neera was a surprise, but welcome design. She is actually a great character, and I think they did a fantastic job with her inclusion.

Level Design:
Some of the new levels are fantastic, both visually, and gameplay-wise. Some kind of drag, and how you feel about that will be subjective. I don't enjoy Shade Armory or Ancestral Forge that much, but Lunar Cannon is an absolute visual masterpiece and experience, and Weapons Core is incredibly sad in relation to the story. No level was absolutely painful to play, and due to the differences in the characters, they will each have varying levels of difficulty/ease in each one. I like this differentiation between the characters' kits actually making them unique to play.

Art:
You can just look at a screenshot comparison if you want to see how big a contrast is. FP2 has solidified new designs for every character, and they are fantastically detailed, with the sprite work going so far as conveying their emotions in tandem with the voice acting super well. The levels are pretty, and distinct, and the game never feels like it has a visual clutter to it. The bosses are also sporting fantastic designs, along with the visual effects. Truly one of my all-time favorite sprite-centric games.

Music:
This soundtrack is amaz~zing. Absolute bangers on it. Even the opening menu is fantastic, though I think Lightning Tower or the final two boss tracks might be my favorites. Seriously, give it a listen.

FINAL WORD:
If you are into action-platformers or any kind, I cannot recommend this game enough. Recommending FP1 is... hard, though the story is extremely relevant to this game. Whether you want to get the first is up to you, but I absolutely think this is worth a play. It spent a long time in development, but what we got is a masterpiece of a sequel through and through.

I'm curious about the inspirations to this game, as Lilac plays most like Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures (2), though each character sort of functions like they have a similar charge system for their strongest abilities. Sometimes I also feel like Gunstar Heroes was an inspiration. And, of course, Sonic was the original inspiration.",1699296994,1703440356,True,3,0,0.518678188323974609,1,True,False,False,True,,,

The gamefeel is on point balancing fast speeds with robust combat mechanics. Even though you zip through levels at breakneck paces, the camera readjusts itself for every occasion and there’s even an option to make it more or less adaptable to your speed. The presentation is delightful with bright, beautiful pixel art and excellent sound design with great music, too.

I think the reason why FP2 isn’t more celebrated is because it’s a surprisingly dedicated experience. All the characters have robust movesets that get some taking used to, even if the basic control scheme is simple and intuitive. Despite the overt Sonic inspirations, the game is very fight focused– taking a lot of verbs from character action games (including a very necessary guard mechanic). Many levels are sprawling– a number of them clocking over ten minutes if you do a lot of exploring– and almost [i]ALL[/i] of them feature a boss fight at the end. The challenge level ramps up quickly. The first time I played this game, I saw a lot of game overs.

Those aren’t [i]flaws[/i], but I think most people would be caught off-guard by the amount of Give A Damn the player has to bring to Freedom Planet 2. There’s an easy mode, and I haven’t tried it, but I think even if it makes getting to credits less of a trial, it’s probably an inelegant solution in which the ferocity of the game will still ebb on players. This game will take most 10 to 15 hours and by the end– partially in thanks of the game’s intense final act– the players will have had their fill.

But I guess what I’m saying is: Freedom Planet 2 is a [i]feast[/i]. It’s A Lot but what’s there is very good and will be an irreplaceable platforming experience for some players, myself included. Tackling this casually– it’s probably a good time but not something exemplary. I hope this game finds an audience with those that would really cherish, though, because it’s something truly special.",1695307175,1695307323,True,10,0,0.599833011627197266,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's basically just more Freedom Planet, everything cranked up a notch, as any good sequel should strive to do.

It's a big, BIG game. Almost 30 full stages with a smattering of towns, boss stages and optional challenges. I reached a point where I assumed it was the end of the game and didn't realize I wasn't even halfway done! The levels are huge and the pixel art is gorgeous to look at, all the levels have their own quirks and gimmicks, like one being entirely progressed vertically, one having you collect keys to proceed, yes there's even a water level but don't worry because it's not a slog like a lot of other games, there's a lot of boosters and the ability to swim to keep this sort of level from slowing things down.

There's a few stages that are purely just long boss encounters, and the side-scrolling horizontal shooter stage makes a return here too. There are some arena gauntlet style challenges unlocked as you progress that have you do things like navigate a maze, defeat waves of enemies in a particularly cumbersome arena and basically show a mastery of the mechanics introduced in all the levels you've finished so far.

Currency earned can be spent on items you can equip that either help or hinder your progress. The more hindrance you have, the higher your completion rank will be on the stage results and the more currency you earn. So for example, you could equip an item that gives you only 1 life, but doing so would give you more rewards at the end, which is a neat idea. There's also a museum you can spend currency in to unlock dioramas of all the bosses in the game, it doesn't serve any functional purpose other than being just something else you can work to collect. Some equippable items can only be found in hidden areas in stages, the stages with items unfound are marked which is helpful so you know what you're missing from where. The last collectible worth mentioning are the vinyl records which unlock music tracks.

And on the subject of music, the soundtrack in this game slaps hard.

Easily one of the best 2D platformers ever made, you won't regret picking it up if those sorts of games are your thing.

The issues I do have are quite nitpicky and I fully acknowledge it's just me being a whiner and don't much detract from the overall enjoyment, but the three things I personally felt didn't work...

1) The story. At best it's a serviceable way of tying all the stages together, but it's just not that interesting as a story and there's too much of it. As someone who is very susceptible to emotional storytelling and grows attached to endearing characters, I felt absolutely nothing here. It's not that it's a small part of the game, either. A lot of time and effort goes into the cutscenes which just makes it all the more grating because I see what they're trying to do and falling flat. Also, ""classic mode"" for playing without cutscenes is only unlocked after beating the game.
Edit: Thinking about it more, it's probably less to do with the actual story being bad and just the way it's presented. It's way too dialogue-heavy and would have worked better with a show-don't-tell approach, because it's not an overly complicated plot once you trim the fat and cut the threads that don't lead anywhere.

2) The main characters. I'm not big on their designs even in the first game, but even less so for their redesigns. What makes this worse is that pretty much every new NPC added in this game looks far better than all the returning characters. I imagine the idea was to try and distance the series from Sonic games by making the characters taller and without the big heads, which worked great for all these original characters designed from the ground up with this new style in mind, but makes the original characters stand out in a bad way.

3) Lilac gameplay. This is more of a me-problem I guess, but I really dislike her cyclone ability. It's a double-jump that makes her spin like a tornado and cause damage as she goes and I have three gripes here. One, the tornado will keep spinning for a short while after landing on ground and if you try to jump before the spin animation stops, you only jump at around half the height as usual. Two, the constant voice sample when using a skill that you'll be using most of the time becomes annoying and there's no option to turn it off without disabling all voices in the game entirely. Three, it also seems to be the strongest attack you have and I spent a good portion of my first playthrough assuming that the super attack and melee combos would be the biggest damage dealers on bosses when I should have just been spamming double-jump.",1693833952,1700918339,True,7,0,0.597087681293487549,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Neera is a good addition to the playable cast being more combat-oriented than the other characters, the returning characters have new moves and are more fun to play as (especially Milla), the new Guard mechanic is a lot of fun to play with once you get the hang of it, and there's a huge new set of varied levels. The new graphics look great - if the first game felt like a long-lost Genesis game, the sequel feels like a long-lost Saturn game. The music doesn't have as many catchy melodies as the first game's soundtrack but it's still very good.

There's also a new item system where you can buy and equip items before a level, but I mostly didn't bother with it because almost all of the items are to make the game easier in various ways and I felt the standard difficulty was reasonable. There are a small handful of items that increase the difficulty but also give a bonus to your ranking at the end of the stage.

My biggest complaint is that Classic Mode isn't available from the start like it was in FP1. I didn't like the first game's story/writing at all, and I gave the sequel a chance but I didn't like this one's story/writing at all either.

It's got pretty sprites, lots of levels that don't overstay their welcome, and good replayability.

And the parry mechanic in this game is really good and fun to use, major points for that mechanic alone.

Also, it comes with decent item loadouts, which I liked.

The only few things that I prefer in FP1 over FP2 are the following:

[h1]1 - The Music: [/h1]
The OST in this game is still great and lively, it's just that FP1 does that better imo, some of the soundtracks feel like they're messing something to make 'em pop.

Overall, great music, Nalao Lake is probably my favorite.

[h1]2 - The Main Villain, Merga: [/h1]
I personally think the story is structured better than in the first one, but at the same time FP1 has the better main villain, [b]Lord Brevon[/b].

Honestly, Lord Brevon is one of my favorite indie villains, smuggy and violent. The (in)famous torture scene in FP1 is what made me love him. You might call me an edgy for it, I don't mind, I feel like game stories should bring out the violence in villains, I mean he's a villain, of course he would be violent, it's makes the fiction a bit more real, but not too real imo.

Merga in the other hand just didn't hit the mark for me, I don't really hate her or even dislike her, she's just not as exciting as Brevon, not even close.
Good villain introduction, and a cool ass ship she got, but spoiler alert in the true ending, it made her lamer for me personally.
Not bad, but it isn't Brevon.

This game has 4 playable character, 3 of them are fun to play, but the character that I was interested in the most to try, Neera Li, came as a bit of a disappointment.
She's the ""hardest"" to play yes, I usually love playing the challenging characters, but she's really not that fun to play, I could get into details why, but I'll just she's doesn't feel as rewarding as playing the other 3 characters.

I was a bit hesitant on picking this game up at first, but one 100% run through the game later, and I can safely say this game is simply a god-tier 2D Platformer. The artstyle, music, writing, characters, controls, level design, and everything in between all fit neatly together to make an amazing ride from start to end. All 4 characters feel so fun and different to play that it honestly makes repeat playthroughs worth it and super enjoyable (It's also cool seeing your specific character's POV in the story). As with most Sonic games, there's nothing like mastering a stage and being able to breeze past obstacles at light speeds. All the stages feel like playgrounds all with different toys to mess with.

Feels like the first game, which I love, although SOMEHOW with all the bugs the first game had like if the system was ported. The bugs aren't bad though, they won't usually ruin anything. They're more-so the FUN type of bugs.

I genuinely think FP1 and FP2's boss design is some of the best boss design I've seen in a game, well... this and Pizza Tower. I wish more bosses in games allowed you to absolutely floor them if you exploit every nook and cranny of the boss or if you have the know-how to attack the boss and dodge simultaneously.

The new parry system is fun too once you get it down, it allows you to get through stuff way faster with a little bit of timing or to even attack bosses faster, it has it's limits so you have to understand those before you REALLY get into doing that stuff. I think this is probably one of the main reasons this game feels different despite the old movement system and gameplay based off FP1. 

I also like the new implementation of the full charge attacks, they feel really good to use here unlike FP1. In FP1 they felt kind of unsatisfying to use for the power VS how long they took to charge.


The movement is really fun like REALLY fun.  I genuinely didn't expect Neera to actually feel different but she feels great to play movement and combat-wise.  

The stages in this game look actually insanely beautiful, no seriously, there's pixel art backgrounds with several parallax layers which make the stages look MASSIVE! Most of the stages feel very distinct and have unique themes that make them stand out.

There's also a bunch of talk-able NPCs with dialog for several points in the game. Several lobby areas where you can buy really fun modifiers that boost how many crystals you get.

The music is really good! Definetely sounds distinct from FP1 and it feels more intense in most cases.

Story's pretty good, I don't have much area to judge in there since I don't know much about story writing also because I haven't finished the story.

It's really fun and despite being long as heck, doesn't bore me like most games by the later stages. I'd genuinely put this as my GOTY.",1688500886,1688500886,True,5,0,0.525606453418731689,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Its an average one at best. Even though the game looks very good and has an alright story behind it. 

Its a 2D high speed platformer similar to sonic, but with fighting mechanics added into it. Now this is a really great idea and the boss fights can be fun, but GalaxyTrail messed up on one important thing. The Guard/Parry move. It has this weird delay to it where you have to press it before the projectile or attack hits you, not when its about it hit you. Your character will gain some I-frames and negate the attack entirely. It doesnt really help either when you are being attacked by multiple enemies or projectiles. I dont understand why they dropped the ball on this and they should look at other games on how parry is done right. Guard is useful in some situations but useless in most others. You might as well dodge by jumping over the projectile and not worry about guarding at all.

Another issue is the level design. A lot of the level layouts can be confusing and very chaotic. There are also these mini puzzles that can be confusing or difficult to navigate. There were some levels that were done right and those being the ones with very long roads and few enemies in between. None of that jump puzzle BS either.

The story is an okay one, but it kind of has a disappointing ending with a cliffhanger and it calls for another sequel to be made. [Spoiler] What the heck happened to Merga after the whole Bakunawa gets destroyed? Lilac said she was going to search for her but we dont even get a cut scene for it. [/Spoiler] Is this included in the secret ending?  Fuck that, Im not playing through the whole game again to try and get it. Its been a frustrating experience for me already. [Spoiler] Also I dont like how the other villians just got a slap on the wrist for treason. Like come on! Put them in jail for awhile! [/Spoiler]

Anyways, Freedom Planet 2 is mostly a frustrating experience. With its chaotic level design, cheap boss fights, and a broken guard move that is almost pointless. I wouldnt give this game a full recommendation. 

Hopefully the next sequel they will learn from their mistakes by making a functional guard move, and overall improve on the level designs and bosses so it can be called a fair challenge.",1686602284,1686602344,False,5,4,0.419150829315185547,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Já adianto que o game é awesome, muito bonito e bem gostoso de jogar.

De upgrades na gameplay, agora você pode se defender! (adeus dano barato!)

Aqui você pode zerar o game com uma de 4 personagem, cada uma tendo suas habilidades e divergências no plot (com seus plots próprios, mas totalmente ligados ao principal, e as fases são todas as mesmas).
Falando individualmente delas:
A Lilac tá igual ao primeiro, bem eficaz, mas com troques novos como o Boost Cancel e aquele dash pra frente depois da defesa.
A Carol está totalmente diferente, tendo muitos mais ataques e artifícios que a fazem ser super versátil, de encontro a sua versão do primeiro game em que você é bem vulnerável (tendo só os chutes em sequência como defesa). Esses artifícios incluem um chute aéreo que te mantém no ar, uma voadora que te ajuda a pegar muita velocidade e o disco que te faz grudar no inimigo.
A Milla tá bem diferentona também, bem adaptada a uma gameplay mais frenética, tendo um foco bem maior em seus cubos em vez de ataques físicos. Além de refletir, ela ainda atira cubinhos e solta o laser de forma bem mais rápida.
A Neera é a nova e pra mim é a mais legal. Dá muito dano, porém é meio complicado de se jogar com ela por conta de sua precisão com os ataques, é bem fácil de acabar ultrapassando o inimigo ao atacá-lo, mas ao pegar o jeito... todo mundo some. A habilidade Focus faz com que ela aumente muito sua velocidade de ataque e, se estiver dentro do consumo da barrinha, pode largar uma magia no final (você pode manter a barrinha ao atingir inimigos também!)

A dificuldade do jogo é bem interessante, bem customizável, não há ""easy"", ""normal"" e ""hard"", as opções apenas já predefinem um set de itens (sejam pedras que te dão vantagens ou Brave Stones, que dão desvantagens) e configurações que você pode modificar por conta em qualquer momento do game. Quanto ao game em si, ela é justa quando a fase não sobrecarrega de inimigos na tela.

Quanto ao plot, fiquei satisfeito, explorando a lore de Avalice e de sua ""época colonial"", porém neste mundo não houve independência. 
O plot da Lilac é sobre ela descobrindo sobre o passado sombrio de sua espécie, dando até mesmo uma revelação sobre seu próprio passado. 
O plot da Carol é com sua irmã, que está com a vilã, sendo vista como inimiga por suas companheiras e tendo que lidar com essa divergência. Gosto de suas interações.
O plot da Milla dá mais detalhes sobre seu passado, só o momento em que ela fica com medo de suas amigas a verem como um monstro por também ser de outro planeta (contando com seu propósito de combate) que ficou meio bobinho demais, mas vai que a intenção era justamente que ela estivesse sendo boba e apenas precisava que alguém deixasse isso claro (quem nunca :v). A propósito, ela de fato tem pais ou ela é uma bio-arma completamente artificial?
O plot da Neera é com ela se tornando um pouco mais tolerante a resoluções mais tranquilas das situações ao invés de ser radical. Achei o mais fraco, mas eu gostei bastante da personagem e suas interações.
A vilã é bacana, ela intimida e é bem forte, porém ainda prefiro o Brevon pois, por conta do plot, você perde o medo dela e começa a ter dó, já o Brevon é intimidador do início ao fim (""I would like to see you try"" é mil vezes melhor que as 48 frases que ela solta no começo da boss fight.). Apesar disso, a lore dela é bacana e compensa essa desvantagem (que pode ser meramente frescura minha :v)

Os personagens novos são bem legais, a Corazon deixa a campanha da Carol bem interessante, o Aaa fornece momentos cômicos, o Capitão Kalaw é bem divertido e o Askal é... bem, sua motivação e perda de controle da situação é interessante, mas ele e sua relação com a Neera ficaram obscuros demais (ou eu que dei uma de tonto e não percebi nada, dando a impressão de que foi bem superficial).
Serpentine... bem, ele virou uma piada. Por um lado isso é bom pois agora ele tem uma personalidade mais visível, por outro lado perdeu qualquer intimidação que ele poderia provocar, mas no fim eu mentiria se dissesse que ele não me divertiu.
Spade... ficou bem legal! Seus sprites além de o deixarem super carismático visualmente, sua personalidade convencida casou super bem com os mesmos.

As fases são divertidas, sendo até mesmo bacaninhas de se explorar (mesmo sendo jogo de correr). No máximo a Inverso Dynamo e aquelas fases da treta entre o Serpentine e o Aaa que são um saco, dá pra tomar muito dano barato.

A trilha sonora é bacana, gosto bastante dos temas de Parusa, minhas favoritas são a da Gravity Bubble, Ancient Forge e a da Adventure Square.

De defeitos, só uns bugs aqui e ali (como o escudo da Milla deixando passar projéteis, mas aconteceu só em duas boss fights específicas) e a Brave Stone do timer não ser bem balanceada nas rematches da Battlesphere, 1 minuto pra todos os chefões (desisti de uns 3), mas as 5 fases lunares da Merga você tem 3 minutos (sobram uns 2min30). 

Falando na Battlesphere, achei ela fraca, você joga suas fases mais por obrigação de zerar o game de verdade, pelo dever em vez da diversão. Talvez se houvessem objetivos mais definidos e recompensas bem mais interessantes.

Falando nisso de ""zerar de verdade"", talvez seria bem mais divertido ter que encontrar as Time Capsules nas fases (talvez resolvendo um puzzlezinho fácil no processo) em vez de todas menos uma ficarem na Battlesphere, e a única que você de fato tem que encontrar fica super exposto.

Mas bem, essas foram minhas impressões após ter platinado o game, valeu a pena o tempo investido. 
Obrigado, Galaxy Trail, pela experiência!

With all that time, it had big expectations from me to live up to, and fortunately it came out pretty good. It's clear if you played the first game that with the sequel they wanted to set themselves apart a bit more from the spiky blue guy who runs fast, redesigning the characters and adding a little more focus to the combat. Fans of Sonic games or the first Freedom Planet should absolutely give this one a go... There's even a free demo!

In general, the entire scale of the game compared to the last one is much larger as one would expect. While the levels are shorter, being comprised of stage rather than 2 parts separated by a miniboss, there are a lot more of them. There's an additional playable character bringing the total to 4. There's an area you can freely revisit that has a bunch of short challenges and a few minigames to partake in. There's even a secret ending!

Every character's mobility has been improves since the last game as well, so navigating the stages can be a little easier, and there's an ingenious option to zoom the camera out when you're speeding around! And there's a new guard feature, so incoming unavoidable attacks can still be dodged with some good timing.

It's hard to comment on the game's difficulty, as it's tied to optional items you can equip/remove when selecting a stage. I found it to be pretty fair overall, though without the items I believe it's a little too easy, and using those items increase your rewards at the end of a stage, so they're worth using if you care about ranks or 100%ing the game.

Possibly the most welcome improvement of all: The voice volume slider. No longer do you have to subject yourself to the sometimes grating voice acting this game offers, though you'll miss out on one NPC voiced by Chris Sabat if you do.

I've been burned many many many many times by sequels that fail to live up to name of its predecessor, losing the charm that made the original so interesting/fun, and I am very happy to say that this game does not fall among them. While the first game existed mainly as an homage to the classic Sonic games, this game strikes further out from this material without leaving behind much of what was so good about its source, and I have to say I think it turned out pretty well. It certainly doesn't skimp on the length of the story as well, as there were several points where I was expecting the game to be drawing towards a satisfactory conclusion before having a whole new area open up with more levels. Upon writing this, I have only beaten the game twice in 30 hours (Lilac and Neera) without going excessively for collectibles or for speedrunning, so I think it's a pretty fair assessment of the games length. Speaking of the story, its quality hasn't changed much from its predecessor, so if the story/voice-acting of the original really turned you off of it, then I'm sure that this game will do much of the same. The voices are of noticeably better quality, but there are still a good few lines here-and-there that I feel had some odd-directions behind it. Regardless, I would overwhelmingly say that this game is worth playing, even without having completed the original, and I feel so sad about the fact that this game doesn't seem to be as big or popular as it deserves to be.

This is a sequel in the classic sense, better playing, better sounding, more variety, better looking, and better acted. It still plays like a lost Saturn title, consisting of fast platforming with the occasional puzzle box, the original started life as a Sonic fangame and anyone familiar with the classic Sonics or Sonic Mania will feel quite at home here. The story is competent and fully voice acted in story sections along with a lot of incidental animations for characters that are well-timed, it's telling I didn't find myself skipping any of the dialogue.

One major change from the original is the presence of items to make the game easier or harder, but as these reduce your rewards I tended not to use them. You might find them interesting or necessary and you can grind for them as levels are repeatable, with hidden items and soundtrack discs acting as incentive to do so.

This game is not easy and a few key bosses took me around ten or so attempts to take down, thankfully it doesn't have the huge difficulty ramp at the end like the original's eye-watering final boss, but you will feel the escalation as the game continues. The guard/parry mechanic gets not one but two tutorials which should hint at how critical it is to progress, later fights feel like something from Platinum and I mean that as high praise.

The Freedom Planet games are often compared to classic Sonic the Hedgehog games, and for good reason. However, the similarities go beyond surface details (such as the lanky furry cast, the robotic enemies, and the Genesis/Saturn look and sound). The best trait Freedom Planet 2 shares with classic Sonic is that each character, even when playing through the same levels, has a unique set of tools for traversing said levels that playing with each character is a new experience.

The spritework is very good in this game. It has an appealing style that is consistent throughout, level themes are varied and creative, and the cast of characters and bosses are colorful and charming. The soundtrack is, like the last game, very good, with plenty of high-energy songs to keep you moving fast. The controls are tight and responsive, and the level design complements the intended high-speed pace of the game while leaving plenty of room for secrets to find. The game also has a ranking system for players who want to challenge themselves as well as an item equipment system that can make levels easier for players who need it or more difficult to up the rewards for players able to handle the extra challenge.

The one point of contention for this game may be the story/voice acting. I personally like it, and if you liked the story in Freedom Planet 1, you should like this one as well. However, it is over-the-top, hammy, and loud, so I can see some people not liking it as much. Also, Classic mode, which would let players go through the levels without cutscenes, is unlocked in this game rather than being available from the start. Still, every cutscene is skippable, so if the story really isn't for you, it's not hard to skip it.",1683932084,1683932084,True,1,0,0.503659665584564209,0,True,False,False,True,,,

O FP1 para mim foi Master Piece talvez não seja um jogo Indie que me marcou tanto como o primeiro, trilha sonora, fases, progressão, o chefão e os sub chefes, história. Um game incrível e reclamando a todos meus amigos. 

Mas no segundo eu tive momentos que estava jogando por jogar, pelo respeito que tinha pelo primeiro.

Vou dizer os pontos que não me agradou nessa continuação.

Progressão das fases: No primeiro game você tinha os Stages que dividia as zonas e tinha uma pequena varição entre elas. Neste as fazes são únicas, então eles usaram uma maneira de deixar as fases com a mesmo tempo que se tinha no FP1 de forma inteira. Pra evitar como aconteceu com Sonic 2 do mega drive por exemplo, as fazes são enormes normalmente você demora 10 minutos passar. Não consegui ver isso como lado possitivo, acabei passando no modo gotta Go fast. Não consegui pegar apego nenhum as fases sempre senti que fossem desnecessáriamente longas. Mas ao passar senti ao mesmo tempo curta. 

Sistema de vida: achei complicado, não entendi direito. A única coisa que entendi foi que morrendo ou não sempre tinha alguma vida disponível então ignorei tudo sobre as vidas. Kkkkkkk o sistema antigo era mais funcional e simples

Boss: muitos deles achei genéricos, mas alguns como a irmã da Carol, serpentine e o novo askal foram muito legais. Mas o novo sistema de Boss com barra de vida não achei legal. O que acontece é no sistema de Boss sem a barra como no primeiro você não sabe o último hit do Boss com isso você não se arrisca muito tenta esquivar mais e agir com mais cuidado. E que o Boss nesse sistema tem menos vida porém como você não sabe ao certo o quanto de dano você tudo acontece na hora certa. Mas nesse sistema senti que os bosses tinham uma barra de vida desnecessáriamente longa, mas o tinham justamente para contornar o efeito de mostrar a barra de vida do Boss. 

Câmera. Algo que tenho certeza que irão corrigir se não já o fizeram. Mas na versão que joguei passei momentos de raiva com ela, isso causado pelo auto zoom. Tipo eu até que curti a ideia de início e funciona, mas tinha as vezes que queria zoom na tela e não ia, porque é automático e você não tem controle manual (pelo menos na versão que joguei) de zoom ou não. Você tem a opção de desligar, porém fica com a câmera zoom estatico. Porém se jogar assim você terá problemas já que as fazes tem parte que foi feita para jogar com a câmera longe e outras com a camera perto. E esse problema cria algo que no primeiro não tinha porque no primeiro ele foi feito somente para uma câmera e pronto e acabou. Esse problema pode ser contornado se colocar uma função de controle da câmera pelo jogador in game. 

Elementos de RPG no game. É acho que foi o ponto que a maioria do pessoal curtiu nesse novo game. Mas eu destestei, óbvio tem o modo clássico mais o problema não é isso. No primeiro eu joguei o moto história e curti muito o enredo e tudo mais. Porém esse elemento do game ele quebrava o clima que a história tentava te prender e entrar no menu, passear na cidade e falar algo com alguém para começar a fase. É realmente bem chato pra min. Realmente preferia a pegada do primeiro que era cena de história e cai na fase, história e cai na fase.  Te dava uma tensão, me colocava no clima para lutar contra os bosses. 

Infelizmente não curti essa continuação. Se você vir me perguntar oque eu acho sobre o primeiro Freedom planet vou animado te dizer compra é um dos melhores jogos de plataforma que joguei na minha vida tudo nele é lindo e ótimo e bem feito tudo! 

Mas no segundo infelizmente não posso esconder minha frustração de não amar tanto ele como amei o primeiro. Houve mudanças de mais, erros que não me agradaram.

Es por eso que tenía miedo de que el juego hubiera pasado desapercibido por ser una mala secuela o algo del estilo.
Por suerte, no podía estar más equivocado. Es un juego excelente y una perfecta continuación del primer juego, además de establecer elementos que caractericen a la saga.

豊富なギミック・町や山岳地帯、海といったバリエーション豊かなステージ・4人のプレイアブルキャラクターによるゲーム性の変化・美麗なドット絵、そしてスピード感…本作は開発が発表されてから発売するまで非常に長い期間があったのですが、この完成度なら納得です。

また、本作からは『ガード』というアクションが追加されました。ダッシュしながら行うことが可能なため、敵の弾とかを無理矢理すり抜けていくことも可能です。どちらかというと『回避』に近い地味なアクションですが、非常に使い勝手がよく良いシステム追加であると思います。

惜しむらくは、どのボスも当たり判定の小ささの割に動き回るせいでなかなか上手く攻撃しにくいこと。また、日本語対応していないため、ステージ中で発生する会話とかを読むことに苦労すること。その2点だけは気になるところですが、それでも本作はオススメできる完成度です。",1679896732,1679896813,True,4,0,0.534261107444763184,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This game is a great example take one step forward and two steps back.

The art style is fantastic, Tysontan did a wonderful job with the designs and aesthetic, the problem comes in when the designs are put in motion they can feel really awkward at times, which if they're even given motion in some cases, making them feel too rigid in some scenes, not only that, there are multiple graphical problems that occurred from some things moving too slowly, and the absolute abundance of paper doll bosses that were used.

The gameplay was really smooth and worked well, even adding some depth to the formula that was there, the issue was that the stages were not very well thought out and didn't have any flow to them what do ever, which lead to enemies being placed in blind spots and not enough visual range while playing, this lead to even some environmental blind spots while moving at high speeds, not to mention some of the enemies felt either forced or they were placed in a spot a speed traps to hit the player, which leads me to bosses being absolute damage sponges and have either literally no attacks that were a threat or being so loaded with attacks with barely any attack patterns to speak of working randomly with the intent to just pummel the player into the ground, this notion isn't made any better with the fact of the inclusion of augments to make you stronger, as well giving a retry that puts you at a check point which also includes boss fight phases that costs some crystals that can be earned from this punching bag, which implies they knew people were going to have problems.

The sound design and music is great, at first, as time goes on some of the sounds start to layer in weird, the voice acting volume is way too high for default and some of the mixing feels weird, not only that, while I do like the music in this game, the later stages music did not reflect that I heard in the beginning leaving a quality gap between them.

The last thing that was the last nail in the coffin for me was the story which was so horrible back loaded and ham fisted it felt completely out of place and could've used far better execution entirely to get the point across, which it ended up feeling completely preachy.

While I understand game creation is not an easy task I wonder what actually went on during the duration of development, as this game feels heavily front loaded, and that it needed a year or two more time to thoroughly cook, I did not enjoy this game in the slightest.",1679008796,1679008796,False,3,2,0.42198595404624939,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Combina la base de la formula 2D de Sonic con sus propios toques innovadores y mezcla de generos. La verdad que tiene todo muy bien hecho y pensado.

La animación y el pixel art es muy bueno, todos los escenarios se sienten lo suficientemente distintos pero todo parece al mismo tiempo pertenecer al mismo mundo. La escena de Bakunawa saliendo del oceano hacia la luna es genial, y me sorprendió mucho que el juego tenga ese nivel de animación.

Los personajes me gustaron mucho, cada uno tiene su personalidad bien definida y son muy entretenidos de ver interactuando. En cuanto a jugabilidad cada uno tiene su propio set de habilidades, pero son mas definidas que en el Sonic. En Sonic 3 como ejemplo, tails vuela, sonic va mas rapido y knuckles puede planear y escalar, y hasta ahi. Aquí cada personaje tiene su set de ataques y mecanicas especiales que los hacen muy unicos. Hasta ahora solo he jugado con Carol y Neera Li y me gustan mucho, se sienten muy distintas de jugar tambíen y los niveles se sienten muy diferentes jugando con cada personaje.

El juego me resultó desafiante con Carol, pero no imposible. Luego probé a Neera Li, y me resulto muy dificil. Sentía que todos sus ataques eran demasiado debiles para el riesgo en que la ponen. Los jefes pequeños tambien me costaron mucho al principio porque eran muy rapidos, pero una vez que te aprendes los patrones de ataque ya está. Un consejo: Las pociones de Milla no son consumibles, son permanentes, asi que a menos que quieran maximizar la cantidad de cristales que ganan en cada nivel, recomiendo siempre llevar al 5 alguna poción, yo cometí el error de creer que eran consumibles y entonces no las compraba con Neera Li, siento que me hubieran hecho el juego mucho mas sencillo.

La banda sonora es increiblemente buena, todos los temas son pegajosos y memorables, quiza no la primera partida pero la segunda de seguro que si, me recuerdan a los temas de mi juego favorito, hasta creí que era el mismo compositor pero resulta que no, simplemente es muy buena música.

Tuve solo dos problemas con el juego, en un momento se me bugeo y no me mostro una escena dandome a saber que debía hacer a continuación, y tuve que mirar una walkthrough.

劇情層面保留了前作主線全語音的優良傳統之外，妥善的情境分配讓每個角色有更多表現的機會，包括關卡途中都會發現角色對話會因主角色呈現差異，很有群像劇的感覺。

有玩過體驗版4個角色，前作比較嚴格的技能設計在這代有了不少改善，容錯率變高之外也更利於操作，可以做到很靈活的移動方式。
通關方式維持2關一組的關卡組合，關卡間主題差異巨大，體驗相當好，加上每階段不再是綁在一起，可以中間回去調整裝備，加快了重複挑戰的效率。",1678308766,1678308766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

There are some issues I have with the game, but they are so small and insignificant that they're not even worth talking about. Now that's something to be proud of! This little review can't do this masterpiece proper justice, so please just go play it yourself. Give them your money, you won't regret it, but I will try to give you a mini-review of sorts (well, at least mini in comparison). This game is the perfect sequel, and a perfect evolution of an already established formula. It's mind-blowing just how good this game is, no joke. This beautiful title is way too underrated.

Wow. Just, wow. This game is absolutely fantastic! The first game was already pretty great, but this is just such a big improvement in every way. The graphics, art-style, sprite-work, gameplay, story, music, and voice acting are all great and better than before, and all of the additional features, such as hub worlds, a world map, updated movesets, a ranking system, a parry button, more collectables, a fourth playable character, an enhanced classic mode, a revive system, assist options and more just make this game feel very fleshed out. The difficulty is also more balanced and fair, and has a unique system that involves these new items called ""Brave Stones"", as well as other items and potions. It's also lovely that each character plays quite differently from each other, and gets some unique cutscenes, which helps make each playthrough feel fresh and varied. The boss battles are so intricately designed and perfectly challenging. Every single level in this game is fun and unique, and there's literally no bad parts. The story is delightful and engaging, and the characters all have strong personalities.

One thing I like about this series is that it feels like it has a good balance between upbeat and dark. It's not afraid to get mature and serious, but it's also often lighthearted and humorous. While to some this may seem to cause minor tonal issues, I personally believe that it never pushes it too far in either direction, and I enjoy this style. Like the first game, it's not just a Sonic-clone, and stands out as it's own thing, and in fact, it stands out even more this time. This series could blossom into something truly beautiful and unique, and honestly, if the Sonic series died tomorrow, this would be the perfect replacement (although I wouldn't actually want that to happen!). Despite this, the game still takes some inspiration from the Sonic series, among other sources. The main difference between Sonic and Freedom Planet is the heavy focus on combat in the latter. Plus, there's two main references to Sonic that I found. First of all, there's this one scene were they all say ""long time no see"", which made me chuckle (if you know, you know), and secondly, there are two NPCs named Sunny and Amelia, who are cute little hedgehogs who resemble Sonic and Amy, and make references to Sonic in their dialogue. I love these nods to this series' original inspiration.

Many things carry on from the first game, but pretty much every single thing was improved, even the things that didn't require improvement. There is just so much passion, care and polish oozing out of every crevice in this game. Playing this game feels like a warm embrace, it just feels so comforting and soothing, and it makes my heart sing. It's infinitely charming! It has a high level of replayablility too. And they're still updating the game and removing bugs, which is unnecessary yet much appreciated. Also, the soundtrack is absolutely one of the best I've ever heard! A big round of applause from me to every composer, but special shout-outs to Woofle, she knows what's up. This game in general is one of the best games I've ever played. I love how much this game respects, references and is connected to its predecessor, despite surpassing it so greatly. I just really love this dang game! Seriously though, this has become an easy contender for my favourite game of all time, if it isn't already, and it's absolutely amazing. I never expected to find a game I loved more than any Sonic game, but here we are. I'm pumped for the console release, will happily buy this game multiple more times. It's not a perfect game, but with just how much I have enjoyed it, I'd gladly give it a 9.5/10 score. 

One last thing that I want to mention is that I appreciate how the achievements (known as badges in-game) are set up for both games. At first, I looked at the achievement  list and it felt like an insurmountable task for me to accomplish, but here I am with only 6 achievements left, and I've never felt like any of them were too hard. Plus, I feel confident that I can get the last ones. A test of skill and patience for sure, but none of them crossed the line of being a big pain, and I am very happy about that. And by the looks of the first game, it appears that it will be a similar story, so I'm going to try and get the achievements in that one too. The achievements only made the game better and were quite fun to collect, and encouraged me to appreciate the game to the fullest. That's pretty cool, in my opinion. I also love the GalaxyTrail Exhibit in the gallery, that's a really nice addition.

Thank you very much, Sabrina DiDuro and everyone else at GalaxyTrail, for creating such a magical and amazing experience (twice), and I can't wait to see where this series goes in the future. This stuff is so good that I feel like I'm not paying you enough! Even if the next game costed $100, I'd still buy it in a heartbeat. Also, take as much time as you need if you plan on making another sequel, even if it takes another 7 years or more. Even if I'm married and have kids by the time it releases, I'd still drop everything to play the game on launch. Whatever you guys choose do with this series, know that you have my full support. Even if the series ended here, it's one that I'd never forget. I know that I've been gushing a lot, but I can't help it.

I was very impressed by how much this series has grown. While it did take seven years to make the second game; it is better to make sure the game is ready for launch instead of rushing the game and having it be bad.

Who knows? Maybe Freedom Planet will rival Sonic in the far future.

Very well done GalaxyTrail. I only ask that you make use the full scope of this franchises potential, please do not let that go to waste as Sonic has done with some of his games.

Returning to Avalice hasn't felt any better. [b]THIS[/b] is how you do a proper video game sequel. The world built by the first game has returned, yet feels completely brand new. The environments are more lively, there is more depth and detail in every nook and cranny which is super fun to search for every hidden detail. The characters have evolved nicely, while they maintained their original traits this game expands upon their existing attributes and makes them even more lovable.

No disappointments, no missed potential, just a perfect grand slam of an experience from front to back that validated that years of desperate thirsting? Not everyone has, but Freedom Planet 2 was exactly that for me. I admit, I was not exactly the most patient person. Especially in the early years, I look back on some of my desperate pleading for the game to come out as kinda cringe, letting my hype get in the way of wanting Galaxy Trail to have all the time they needed to deliver in spades. But as I kept seeing previews, I not only realized that I needed to calm down and be patient, but that I was in for a delicious treat. And boy, was I right.

Freedom Planet 2 exemplifies the idea of what exactly a follow-up can do to truly succeed. Not just copy and paste the original with some fresh paint, not unnecessarily changing everything for the sake of ""being different"", and certainly not the modern, cynical AAA experience of a minimum-viable skinnerbox with a fancy cosmetic storefront. This is a [b]SEQUEL[/b]. It takes what made the first game great, compounded on those strengths, trimmed away the fattier issues, made logical improvements across the board, and did everything it could to validate its existence as a follow-up.

Gameplay is pretty familiar to those who played the original, but improvements are immediately noticeable. Every character's moveset feels fantastic with very little jank or redundancy. The camera's auto-zoom feels fantastic during high-speed sections. The new guard mechanic feels like something that was always meant to be there. The level designs feel just that much more distinct and tightened up. The social spaces in Adventure Mode feel so much better for the game's story than just having Adventure Mode only be a bunch of cutscenes like the first game. Brave Stones and Potions are a brilliant alternative to a conventional difficulty system. It's polished to a mirror sheen, and it's so fantastic to just sit back and enjoy thoroughly.

Another particular strength I have to point out is the art direction. The first game had an interesting art style, but sometimes felt just a little close to the Sonic fan game it started life as, particularly in regards to character design. Not only does Freedom Planet 2 heavily redesign most of its cast to great success, but proportions and details in the character designs truly make them feel as original as they could be. Additionally, with the work that went into the game's social spaces for Adventure Mode, as well as the genuinely fantastic-looking environments for the levels, Avalice feels fully realized as a setting. It's not just a vague mental map of where places could be, wondering how the level environments diegetically fit into the world. Everything fits together and looks organic. Shang Tu's beautiful ivory city among the water, Shang Mu's neon urban sprawl, Shuigang's humble snow-capped village look, Parusa's beautiful tropics... They all come together to make the levels you run through feel just that bit alive.

The story of Freedom Planet 1 was something I struggled with early in. It obviously wasn't the primary thing you were there for, but it often struggled to hold my attention. And in two specific cases, felt like sudden, polarizing tonal shifts that came out of nowhere. While I eventually embraced it for what it was, Adventure Mode was something I never really felt compelled to touch again after doing my first run with each character. Freedom Planet 2, though? Significant improvement. Not only does a vast majority of the voice acting feel much better with less of a Saturday morning cartoon vibe to it, with many actors ([i]particularly Morgan Berry and Edwyn Tiong[/i]) being able to fully carry an emotional moment, but there's just significantly better flow to story scenes, better lines for the script across the board, better charm and charisma for a lot of the cast... Better everything! Rather than impatiently waiting for a cutscene to end, I was always thoroughly engaged in seeing what was happening next. Going to the social spaces in Adventure Mode and talking to all the characters I could find was a treat I always relished. And with each new playthrough, I was excited to see the few character-exclusive scenes and moments that I didn't get to see from Lilac's perspective on my initial run. Just such an improvement.

I could keep going, especially on things like the music. Amazing soundtrack, by the way, grab a copy on Bandcamp! But I think my point is thoroughly made. I waited six and a half years to finally play this game. Not only did it come out in time to basically be a belated birthday present to myself, but it completely validated every year, every month, week, day I waited to find out just when I could finally play the sequel to my favourite indie game of all time. Having played it pretty extensively now, and getting VERY close to reaching 100% completion, I know that the sequel succeeds the original as my favourite indie of all time.

Play it. Right now. I'm serious. Open your wallet, pull out your credit card, and throw your money at the faces of Sabrina DiDuro and her team at GalaxyTrail.

소닉 매니아, 오리진에서도 느끼지 못한 희열을 저는 프리덤 플래닛에서 느끼네요.
1편도 상당히 만족스러웠지만 소닉의 팬 메이드 게임 같은 느낌을 지우지 못했는데

이번 2는 정말 정성들여서 만들었는지 진심으로 하나에서 열까지 플레이 하면서 발전했다 라는 느낌을 전체적으로 받았습니다. 무엇보다 캐릭터 도트가 너무 귀엽고 전작보다 스토리 음성 볼륨과 NPC 라인들도 생겨 '영어'만 된다면 세계관을 더 상세히 그리고 스토리를 보다 감명깊게 볼 수 있을 것 같아요.
아쉽게도 저는 캐릭터 대사 외에 NPC들의 대사의 독해는 어렵더라구요.

캐릭터는 전작에 비해 하나 더 추가되었고 기존 캐릭터들의 액션은 비슷하나 회피 기능이 추가되어 더 스타일리쉬한 플레이가 가능하게되었습니다.
그리고 밀리아란 캐릭터(1에서는 슈퍼마리오 2의 플레이 스타일 캐릭터)의 느낌이 완전히 바뀌어 이제는 더 이상 느린 플레이가 아닌 밀리아로도 빠른 플레이가 가능하네요.

밀리아 팬으로서 너무 좋았습니다.
음악도 전체적으로 발전했습니다! 1때도 음악은 좋았는데 그 느낌 그대로 2편도 완성도를 올렸네요.

다만 스테이지를 진행할 수록 난이도와 스테이지가...좀 악랄합니다.
물론 다크소울 정도는 아니지만 1편에 비하면 직선 적인 진행 방식만으로 해결이 안되게 만들어놔버려서 좀 개인적으로는 아이러니했네요.(게임에서 길찾기 쥐약이라서..)

前作がMD風のソニックライクなアクションゲームなら、今作はSS風のようなグレードアップを果たしまさに理想の続編…だったんですが、デモの段階で不安だった新要素のガードアクション(ガードとありますが、要は緊急回避で昔のスマブラの空中緊急回避ばりに連打できます)前提の作りになりすぎてしまっている印象です。
これにより前作のようなボスの激しい攻撃の隙を見切って張り付いて殴っていく作りではなく、相変わらずボスは硬いままなのに決まった攻撃ターン以外はあまり攻撃できず、移動だけでは回避困難な弾幕をひたすらガードですり抜ける作りになってしまった為正直非常にダレるし、個人的に2Dプラットフォーマーのこの手の緊急回避が大嫌いなのも相まって後半でウンザリしてしまいました。
(前作で言う所のスカイバタリオンのボスをさらに攻撃当てにくくした物が大量に増えた印象)

ガードそのものは「攻撃していない時なら自動でガード発動」などのアシスト機能もあるんですが、そもそものこの作りが楽しくないので解決にはなってないです。そもそも緊急回避目的ならドラゴンブースト、ワイルドキックなどのゲージ技が既に存在していた為、さらにローリスクな行動を追加しなくても良かったし、あっても本当に救済位置で良かったと思います。咄嗟の回避手段としてではなくほぼ必須要素にされているので…。

また、ステージの「スイッチを全部押さないと進めない」とか「正しくギミックを操作しないと戻される」みたいな、ソニックライクとしては面倒なギミックも増えてしまっていて、前作のようなガンガン走ってナンボという作りが薄れてしまっているようにも感じました。デモの1面は散々プレイして最高に面白かったんですが…。

デザイン面とかBGMは本当に理想の続編だったんですが、残念ながら自分的には凄くNot for meなゲームになってしまった感じです。前作が好み過ぎたからそう感じてるだけで、純粋にソニックライクな2Dプラットフォーマーとしては非常に高品質だと思いますし、上で言ってる事が気にならないなら問題なく楽しめると思います。",1675466476,1675467256,False,0,0,0.490196079015731812,0,False,False,False,True,,,

Freedom Planet 2 is probably my favourite platformer i've played in the last few years. Being a mix of speed and action with the occasional precise sections, the game reminds me a lot of S3&K with a dash of Shantae, which is a great mix if you ask me.

To start this off; the first thing I always look for in a game: music. 
It's great. All of it. Go listen to the soundtrack if you haven't, you wont regret it.

The levels are all designed well with multiple routes through most of them.

The 4 characters all control near perfectly. every issue I had with the control in the first game is gone (Milla is fun to play and wildkick is gone)

boss fights are all very fun both the first time and the 5th. they're simple and can be cheesed but are fun no less, and the music is great. (Vs. Corazon my beloved)

The story is engaging with a near perfect length. if you want more, each character experiences it from their own point of view and are all fairly different. It's essentially 4 for the price of 1.
Merga is a great villain, and her motive is understandable and hell, even justified.
the twist supporting antagonists were all great. (and one of them is Vegetable which is an automatic +1(5?) from me)

As for the side content, it's there but not needed which in my opinion, is exactly how side content should be made. and the extra boss and ending for completing the battlesphere is a great incentive to complete it.

[b][PROS][/b]

 - 10/10 sprite work. A major improvement from the first game. 
 
 - Gameplay is vastly improved. (Another one...) Featuring an ability to dodge enemies attacks which came very useful.

 - Voice acting is done more better in comparison to the melodramatic acting from the first. (Jesus Christ...)

 - Story is also better! (Fuck me..) Merga, in my opinion, is more interesting than Lord Brevon. (That, and also Merga looks more badass.)

 - Tyson Tan did an excellent work of revitalising the characters of Freedom Planet. They've look better than ever. (No offence to the creator of Lilac, Carol, and Milla, but fuck, his art is cool.)

[b][CONS][/b]

 - The game ends.

 - Barely any easter eggs. (Like the unique save file icons from the first)

 - Stages are a tad too long. Some of them feel like chores like that cave level where you have to find keys to open a door.
 
 - Would have to probably wait for another addition until the heat-death of the universe.

Sash Lilac is as enjoyable a hero as always, looking out for those she cares for instead of her own needs.
Carol Tea with her improved move set and motorcycle game play, being as hilarious as ever.
Milla Basset with her familiar shield and phantom cube, now improved to spawn instantly and float alongside her instead of being held.
and Neera Li, while busted in terms of platforming, being the powerhouse with her vast set of moves and speed.
And let's not forget our star villain: Merga, who goes up and beyond to achieve her goal, only to end up failing, or realizing her mistake before facing the secret boss if you get all the Time Capsules.

Now, here we are. I've beaten the game for the first time, and I have to say, the wait was worth it--and then some.

Freedom Planet 2 is something that I like in a sequel: one that is bigger and better than what came before it. The game took everything from the first game--from gameplay, to story, to bosses, to outright spectacle--and gave them a massive upgrade that is welcome to see.

The world of Avalice is expanded upon with a brand new country. A fourth playable character joins the three from the first game. The story is bigger as it is darker. Nearly everyone from the first game returns, alongside some new faces. New revelations shake up what we know about our favorite characters, and set up what's to come in the franchise's future. There is a LOT that I enjoy about this game.

As for who I began the game with, I chose Carol as my first character. She was my favorite character in the first game, due to her tomboyish charm, hilarious personality, adorable appearance, cool ride, and the fact that she's a cat (I am admittedly a cat person myself). And yep--Freedom Planet 2 made me love her even more. Her comedic charm is put on full display during her story, and the ending of Avian Museum reminded me why I love her in the first place.

That being said, the fact that I played as Carol first instead of Lilac may not have been the intended path, in hindsight. Some story elements were clearly meant to be shown if you were playing as Lilac as your first character; because of that, some twists either don't have that wham to it or just come out of left-field unless you were playing as Lilac. Of course, this could be chalked up to my love for Carol; if I played as Lilac first, then these hidden plot points could have that same gravitas they were meant to have.

But even with that in mind, it was still worth it playing as Carol and enjoying her hilarious antics. And as of this writing, I am indeed playing as Lilac, meaning that I'll see the plot twists the way they were meant to be shown soon enough.

Regardless, Freedom Planet 2 is a game that makes the eight years of waiting worth it. And I want to tell GalaxyTrail, and in particular Sabrina DiDuro, something. You stated your intentions to make Freedom Planet a franchise with the release of this game. And I think--I hope--I bet you've succeeded. As long as people want to see the further adventures of Lilac and her friends, the Freedom Planet series should never end.

I encourage you to create countless more games in this wonderful series, each one even bigger than the last in all facets. And it make take years for the next game to come out (I hope not), but remember: we've waited 8 years for Freedom Planet 2 (6 for me), so we're used to it.

Which is to say, here's to Freedom Planet 3. Here's to more adventures in Avalice and beyond. Here's to the future of this incredible series: Freedom Planet!

According the composer who got DMed a similar question, They had little to no clue where the music was going to be where. this leads to the music just not fitting the scenario. eg, the boss themes. although they are bops, they don't sound like boss themes. a later stage in the game uses the ""snowfields"" motif from the first game, which to me doesn't fit the stage. the graphics, are stunning. Seriously, Tyson Tan did a incredible job on the sprite work. The story telling is a vast inprovement compared to the first game, no more is there inconsistent mic quality and random changes between ""cooties"" and electric torture. it's told superbly and I still think Jason Lord takes the cake with his performance.

This game is huge and is a must to have game in your library. Once you got to like Sonic games or Freedom Planet 1, you'll be happy playing this one.

What are the best features to mention? Well, there's plenty:

- Absolutely nice graphics despite it being pixelated and butterlight PC specs is just enough for this.

- Really rich story and layers of gameplays with missions to select during our adventure.

- Really challenging stages with tons of items to use in order to form specific playstyles.

- Characters has ""types"" to organize of what are the best abilities they have but non of them are lacking in speed if used the right way just as usual.

- Major Zhao and his golden moments. Just never gets old. (+5 RATING)

- The return of Spade! Holy Jesus we see a badass character in new colours! What a time to be alive!

- Literally everyone's kit and playstyle has been changed a little bit since FP1 plus we have Neera which is a big one.

- Battle and Training arena being implemented in the game, where I can fight other characters.

- Towns with great environs and cool citizens.

- When the main heroines are there to fight for you alongside your chosen character in the story is a satisfaction matter. I love every second of it just like how I loved to see it in the first game.

There's a lot other wholesome elements to mention ahead about the game, so this review will be edited later as I get in-depth experience of the game entirely.

I was and am a huge fan of the first game. I remember getting it on the Wii U back in 2015 and enjoying the hell out of it. Now we have a sequel and how does it far against the first? 

Well, there are certainly differences. The combat has had some tweaks, mainly with the addition of a dodge/parry. I think this does make the fighting overall easier, but more fluid and engaging.

The Characters have also gotten some tweaks to their combat and how they traverse the stage. Lilac pretty much follows the same concept as the first game. Carol is still Carol, but instead of the move where she does a flurry of kicks, she now has a circular-bladed weapon that she throws, and can also jump too, giving her more movement options. I can't comment on Milla however, because I didn't play her through the first game. 

The visuals and art style have also gotten a huge upgrade, and I feel it helps to distinguish it more from Sonic games and gives it more of its own unique identity. It also makes the world feel so grand when traveling through the stages and looking off into the beautiful landscape. It's obvious a lot of love and hard work went into the pixel art and they truly did a great job. 

The story wasn't of much importance to me in the first game, and truthfully I vaguely remember what happened. What I do remember from the first game though was how corny a lot of the cut scenes were. In FP2 I feel like the story has improved simply from the fact that there weren't any cheesy lines that made me want to skip the scenes. In fact, there were a few moments that legit gave me a good laugh. Overall, I enjoyed the story well enough, and it was engaging enough to make me want to keep playing. 

Now one thing I did want to mention, is that the game feels really grand, almost too grand. I meant in terms of size. These levels are long with many different paths you can take. As a completionist, it can be rather daunting going through trying to find all the collectibles. There is so much to explore in each stage and can be easy to overlook a little nook or cranny where the item is hiding. This is one downside for me, but after playing through all the stages, I realized it wasn't as bad as I though, but still an annoyance, at least in regards to finding the collectibles. 

Overall I love Freedom Planet 2. It has fun, exciting and challenging gameplay with lovable characters (minus Neera) and a beautiful world. I think most people who enjoyed the first one will enjoy FP2.

A lot of what I enjoyed about the first game is brought back here. The story takes place 3 years later and focuses on a new threat named Merga, the last of the Water Dragons who wants to destroy Avalice and wipe out the Earth Dragons. It's a much deeper story, one that focuses on political intrigue and social prejudices throughout the 3 Kingdoms of Avalice and its many species. There's also more backstory given to the characters, such as Lilac being the other remaining Water Dragon, and her origins with the Red Scarves. Carol has a sister, Corazon, who's working with Merga, and her main conflict is convincing Cory to defeat Merga instead. Milla's backstory is further elaborated, revealing who and where her parents are, but I won't give it away here. Neera Li joins Team Lilac, and is shown to have a hard time trusting people as she's constantly being betrayed; she has a black-and-white view of the world, calling everyone either an ally or an enemy; her loyalty to Shang Tu is sometimes taken to the extreme; but over the course of the game, Lilac and Milla help her to open up and have faith in their group. And, of course, the writing once again balances out with plenty of charming character interactions, which is the main source of comedy again.

However, this game's plot falls into the same trap as the first game: some of the cutscenes still go on WAY too long and slow the pacing down; the only way they're sped up here is that dialogue plays out automatically, moving from one line to the next, unlike the first game where you had to keep pushing one button after every textbox. 

There are also instances where the game diverges from the main plot, and has the player go through 3 episodes in any order they want; the episodes have their own subplots that do connect to the main plot, but still make it go on longer than necessary.

Otherwise, it's a great continuation of the plot that fleshes out Avalice and sets the stakes for the next game.

I should also bring attention to the presentation. The pixel art is more detailed and expressive than the first game, leading to a wider range of emotions and more fluent movements from each character. The environments have a bigger color scheme, which makes many of the stages look gorgeous! And they take it a step further by making some objects 3D polygonal models that are well integrated into the 2D setting.

The audio is a slight downgrade, but only slightly. The music has a few REALLY good tracks, but it's not as memorable or energized as the first game. The voice actors are just slightly less convincing than they were in the first game, and the sound mixing has the same issue, where the music can sometimes be louder than the dialogue; but they still give good performances that sell the characters pretty well.

As for the gameplay, there's a LOT of improvement.

Lilac can use her double jump without draining her blue meter and go straight into a dragon boost without waiting for the meter to fill back up. THANK YOU. She's easily the fastest character in the game, at the cost of having weaker attacks than the rest of the characters, something I found more noticeable during boss fights.

Carol still has her motorbike which can ride up walls, but she also has the Jump Disc, a projectile to throw at enemies and even magnetize to them for a few seconds, dealing more damage; the Disc also lets her teleport, making it easier to jump across large gaps or travel up to high ledges.

Milla's shield can now block almost anything; in fact, it can bounce most projectiles back at enemies, causing them to take damage, which is useful defense AND offense. She can also summon her big green gelatin blocks a lot faster, which she can either fire as a laser, like before, or she can shoot out tiny green bullets until the cube is depleted. And of course, she still has her floating ability, which is still fun to use.

Neera is the powerhouse character, who can freeze enemies for a short time, and use her ""Focus"" ability to make her attacks faster and stronger. If you feel she moves too slow, you can speed her up by mashing the attack button, which forms an ice trail underneath her to slide across the ground like she's ice skating; this can make her sometimes move faster than Lilac!

But beyond individual differences, each character has basic moves and abilities that they all share.

They can all perform basic melee attacks, which vary in damage, status effects, and targeting based on which direction you tilt the control stick. 

As for defenses, the items in this game act similar to the elemental shields from Sonic 3 & Knuckles; letting you breath underwater, protecting you from fire or electricity, magnetizing collectibles towards you, or just providing basic protection like the shields from Sonic 1 and 2. And each character has a guard maneuver, which blocks enemy attacks and prevents you from taking too much damage, which is essential for the boss fights. 

Speaking of which, the bosses all have visible health bars, which also determines when the player reaches the next phase of the fight.

And, I should mention that, as a game inspired by 2D Sonic, the high-speed platforming is expanded. If Freedom Planet was a combination of Sonic Advance 1 and 2, Freedom Planet 2 is closer to Sonic Advance 2; once again, acceleration goes from zero to sixty, and they've introduced boost rings and grind rails, both of which keep your character ZOOMING across terrain. It's still the best thing about the gameplay!

But then there are the downsides of the gameplay; for one thing, the main campaign is TWICE as long as the first and ends up overstaying its welcome again. In fact, some stages here go on for 20 to 30 minutes at a time! Never mind Sonic, that's way too long for ANY 2D platformer. I've already mentioned the episodic structure that makes the campaign go on longer, but there's also exploration in between stages. The world maps are one thing, and they mark your next destination with red exclamation points; but then they have you going through HUBWORLDS in a 2D game! You have to go talk to certain characters in this or that building to watch the next cutscene, you have side missions to complete by talking to townsfolk, and there's NPC's in each area, some of whom offer their own perspectives on the events of the main plot. It's not terrible, but it still comes off as padding.

Finally, on top of all this, Freedom Planet 2 has a true ending that you unlock by finding 13 time capsules! You do this by finding one in a HUBWORLD (the top of the tall building in the beach area), and then the other 12 are rewarded to you for completing Battlesphere Challenges. To give this game SOME credit, they made it super easy to find and collect these time capsules, just like collecting Chaos Emeralds in a Sonic game. It's better than other games where you go FAR out of your way to complete cryptic nonsense you'd only know about by using a guide. Here, it's just a small diversion that adds a little more time to your playthrough and involves the same content as regular stages. In that regard, the game is fair, but it still adds more extra steps to a campaign that's already bloated with content. I only went after the true ending with Lilac, because I just wanted to finish the game with the other characters and move on. I will say that the true ending has one more stage, and a cool final boss that gets me excited for Team Lilac's next adventure!

Freedom Planet 2 makes improvements to the first game, and it's still a fun 2D platformer that took me for a WILD ride. Whether you're a Sonic fan, or you've played the first Freedom Planet, or both in my case, you owe it to yourself to play this game. But make sure you have enough free time and enough patience, because it's also a much heftier time sink, and you may be worn out by the end.",1672790369,1672790369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

7 years in development well spent, and they DELIVERED! 
First off, this game's gameplay improves massively over the first game, which was already fairly good on its own. This? This is just the perfect 2D speed platformer. It's so good it basically puts every 2D Sonic game to SHAME.

It's gonna take you a little while playing around with the controls to understand how to make the most out of the mechanics in this game, so please do not get discouraged early, there is a very rewarding learning curve as you progress through the game. Not to mention that many of the stages are meant to be replayed, either to lower the time, or find new secrets. 
Your first run of a stage might take you, idk 7~10 minutes for most. 
Then once you get acquainted with the mechanics, you'll see that time be cut in half if not even more. 

All 4 playable characters have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they all perform about the same once you've picked up some practice. Often you'll find yourself going to different parts of the stages with different characters. 

The story? TLDR: It's a story about colonialism with a tragic character. Not spoiling much else, but do go out of your way to collect the time capsules, they hold some VERY juicy information regarding the lore. 
Another thing of note is that each character has specific cutscenes throughout the story, so I highly recommend playing through it with all 4, or at the very least with Lilac and Carol, since those two hold the most specific cutscenes of all the 4 characters. 

The 2D sprites in this game are BEAUTIFUL. The main 4 characters are extremely expressive, the side characters have pretty good variety, the NPCs are honestly really cute, I love how bats look in this game. I know that the lead dev's favorite animal is a bat, so no wonder why they look awesome. The stages are wildly varied, with many details hidden in the background, as well as other attention to detail elements that you'd only noticed if you stopped to look. 

THE VOICE ACTING, OH BROTHER THE VOICE ACTING. 
General Serpentine's VA is awesome, love hearing him. 
Both Neera and Merga have crazy good emotional performances, love them both. 
Milla's voice fits her character way too well, and a massive improvement over the first game. 
Same for Carol. 
Glad to hear Lilac again. 

Despite all the sadness in the game, there is also a lot of hilarious stuff, a lot of which you'll find in those character specific cutscenes I mentioned earlier. 

BUY THE GAME, IT'S STUPID GOOD! I 100% it and speedran the game with all 4 characters, managing to beat it under 2 hours with each. Short and sweet. 
Your first run will definitely take WAY longer however.

Still haven't finished the game with all the characters, but with the time I spend on it, I think I can say about the game from my first experience.

Freedom Planet 2 made a outstanding step from the first game: in gameplay, story-telling, soundtrack and art-style. 
In my first time playing it I really got a tough time navigating through the stages and fighting the bosses(I died a lot), got a few infuriating moments, fortunately it wasn't lasted so long, took me almost the entire day to finish the game. I had fun? Mhm! I had a lot of fun!

After replaying it, things get easier to manage even with other characters, which I consider to be my real experience with this Indie game that started as a Sonic Fangame, I'm very glad they decided to change the plans, because if wasn't because of this change, I wouldn't never be able to meet such a amazing platformer game and the community built by this game and developers.

The long story though; I find it tough to actually call this game amazing. The game itself does get very bombastic in ways a Treasure game would go... But I can't help but think something is missing from the adrenaline as weird as it sounds?

I'll start talking on gameplay, this game has 4 playable characters being Lilac, Carol and Milla returning from the first and Neera who was also that first game but was an NPC/Boss in that game.
- Lilac practically plays the same as her first game rendition with her dragon boost being able to fire her in 6 directions at a burst of speed with a ton of QoL touches that have her game play feel more smooth. 
- Carol is a brawler/ninja hybrid character who takes after a ton of similar play styles, though definitely find a refresh in this game with some new moves and abilities
- Milla has been overhauled to have her kit more geared towards combat instead of her weird puzzle platformer move set. She actually feels like a proper character in this game compared to the first.
- Neera is more focused on heavy hitting combat, more so than Carol in the sense that all of her kit revolves around hitting things. She's probably the most awkward to get a hold on since stages are so big in this game with not many focusing on mini-boss/boss encounters.
The variety in character does make it so there's a lot of variety in terms of approaching the game and what characters you may find enjoyable or feel fall flat. I'd still say Lilac is the main poster girl of the game though with Carol being a fun alternative, Milla being a little more tricky but fitting and Neera... Well I'll give it to her that she's relatively straight forward and not awkward to where she's a detriment.

To bring attention to stages, a lot of them are pretty great in terms of set pieces and building up to bosses. This is where the Treasure comparison really steps in with bosses being more present within some stages before actually fighting them. It really sets a bombastic tone in which stuff is happening within the levels not always just being still pieces. Though there are later stages where enemies and obstacles can become more crazy than they probably should be. 
Now the game does have a ""guard"" mechanic that's more or less a sort of lenient parry but I don't think it's a mechanics that's fleshed out to the degree it should be. There are moments where the parry window do save me only to find that I'm still within an attack and take the hit anyway in some sections. I'd imagine if you're going to high ranks or stages this would be infuriating to deal with but just going from point A to B it's more slightly annoying than anything. I'd probably have some kind of invincible dash instead of a parry but that's probably due to what kind of games I play (I know Lilac has a dash like that but you have to hold down the button and I find that awkward).

I probably should've mentioned story earlier but this is definitely more of a game where they want to sell you on the game play rather than the story. Not to dog on it of course as it's a pretty dense story and a lot of stuff happens that follows up the first game and does impact the characters. A water dragon named Merga has reawakened and is aiming to ressurect a warship called Bakunawa to eliminate the planet the characters live on and each character has their own perspective with their own stories.
The story was a weak point of the first game for being INCREDIBLY melodramatic and going on longer than the actual stages of the game which thankfully this game tones the length down IMMENSELY. I would say overall this games story is much better... BUT there's still a sore point in the sense it still seems pretty melodramatic. This isn't helped by the fact most of the voice acting in the game is nearly as amateur as the first game. Granted a fair lot of the voice actors have done several voice roles before and do sound fine in this game, not gonna list VA names but I'll just say the player characters are awkward to listen to when they need to be stern or upset in cut scenes. I'd probably say Merga doesn't sound right when she's screaming also, the voice and the sprite are pretty separate from each other in this case. Everyone else is mostly fine though whoever came up with Aaa, who gimmick is that they're prone to screaming should be slapped on the wrist and I'm going easy saying that.

Graphically the game is pretty great with a ton of lovely stage designs, though with how compared Freedom Planet in general is to Sonic it should be noted that the character design is leaning more into more furry and animalistic traits than anything resembling a toon design, though there are still elements of that for some characters and that's not to say it's all devoid of toon-ish designs. I think it's pretty apparent they're going for something more typical of anime and manga which does still have those exaggerations. I say this because there are hub worlds which have NPCs populate them and there is a LOT of variation between them. Though bringing up the hub worlds, some are definitely less pretty than others with a lot of them seemingly using assets that the levels don't use(?) especially noticeable with some elements of them not behaving as they would in the other levels.

Sound wise it's pretty good, though I WILL say I do think the soundtrack is a bit of a mark down. There's definitely good beats still present here and there but I'd struggle to say that many of the tracks really assist the tone or bombastic nature of the levels or events. Crazy to say since Woofle does return for various tracks but I'd struggle to say some of her stuff here is truly strong? Granted there are four other people working on the soundtrack also with some of the people seemingly new to composition so I'd chalk it up to a lot of new talents trying to find footing here.

Overall whilst I might've been more harsh for a positive review, I still think this is a game worth checking out. If you loved the first game then you'll probably love this game even more. If you liked the first one but had issues then this game is still worth it though it does still fall short in a few places the first did. If you didn't like the first game then I doubt this will change your mind.

I like it enough to where I'll probably protest the third game that releases in 2040 to give Lilac a rival character in the form of some scarlet tiger which somehow encourages her to not be so melodramatic, Carol going through something that mimics her VA's carer path (lightly anyway) and Milla maybe losing braincells as she creates some things. Also make Spade playable you cowards.",1671249085,1671250315,True,1,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Like the first this is a very 'Sonic-esque' game with the focus shifted more toward combat and platforming than speed. The gameplay is much tighter and more rewarding this time around and with 4 very distinct characters to use it's also very replayable. Big recommend.

Pros:
- Very customizable difficulty. There are items and potions that will grant buffs and drawbacks and these will decrease/ increase your score respectively. 
- Vibrant, enjoyable setting. The first game felt a bit bland to me, but the setting feels much more engaging this time around. The antagonists in particular. 
- I feel I need to give a special shoutout to the absurd number of unique NPCs running around. A lot of the designs are great and fill out the world a lot. 

My only complaints with Freedom Planet 2 are carryovers from the first. Specifically:
- Some levels have a tendency to drag on. Granted there aren't 'zones' like in Sonic games where a level is divided into 2/3 smaller sections, but there were many gimmick filled levels here where even the par time was over ten minutes. And because the levels are so sprawling it can be bit daunting to form a pathway in your mind. 
- The melodrama gets to be a bit much even for me. A lot of the story is solid and enjoyable there are a few moments that maybe reach too far and made me cringe.",1671125864,1671125864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

While it's a decent enough platformer in its own right, it's a whole host of little things that come together to make the game an absolute slog to get through.

Firstly, the game is long. I mean long! One playthrough of the game with one character, not going out of my way to find all the secrets and so forth, took 12 hours. There are FOUR playable characters. By comparison, for Sonic Mania I've done a complete playthrough with every character (Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Sonic with Ray and Mighty) 100% all collectables and achievements and that's taken just under 20 hours total.

This wouldn't be such an issue if the game did anything truly interesting, but it doesn't. If you're a fan of platforming games - particularly Sonic - everything the game throws at you, you've seen before. That in and of itself isn't a bad thing, but the levels are way too long. The average level takes about 10min to complete. They would have benefited a great deal from being shorter and snappier. I also felt that I could never quite see enough of the stage area at any one time. If an off-screen enemy is able to shoot at you that's not good game design IMO. Worse still is that some of these are total filler. One in particular sees you having to collect several keys in order to rise a bridge to get to another area. If this level had been left out it would have made absolutely no difference. There are several levels like this.

The enemies are all very spongy, even the most basic needing at least two hits, which is not great for a fast paced game like this. The further on you go the more spongy they become. And the bosses are absolutely ridiculous! Some fights end up being more like a bullet hell game and, again, they are spongy as a soaked matrass! The final boss has six phases - count 'em - SIX! It's ludicrous! Add to this that several bosses you have to fight more than once and it truly becomes a chore.

While the story of the first game had a kind of cheesy Saturday-morning-cartoon charm, here it is dragged out so long that it just becomes boring and tedious. I almost never skip cutscenes in games, story is one of the things I really enjoy, but it didn't take long for me to start skipping them here. It's just not interesting.

There are items in the game to buy and use, but I found myself basically ignoring them. Partly because they didn't seem to make any discernible difference to the gameplay, but also because the game is so restrictive over what you can use it's just not worth the bother.

""Tedious"" is probably the best word I can use to describe Freedom Planet 2. It's like the devs took every single idea they had and crammed it into the game, resulting in a bloated, tiresome mess. If they had reeled things back a bit, ditched the extraneous levels and boss encounters and generally tightened things up this could have been so much better.

Apart from the four playable characters and the items mentioned above, there are also heaps of collectables and a ""Classic Mode"" to entice you back to replay the game. However, after the absolute slog of getting through just ONE character's story, I can't see myself returning to this at all.",1671060149,1671060149,False,4,1,0.483718574047088623,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Freedom Planet 2 is the sequel to Freedom Planet 1, and tried to take steps to differentiate itself from being game in the similar style to Sonic the Hedgehog, which it'll naturally be compared to. As a 2D, pixel art, side scrolling platformer. 

Freedom Planet 2 was released on September 13th, 2022 across Windows, Linux, Switch, Playstation, and Xbox. With the Dev and Publisher being GalaxyTrail. It's quite the substantial development since Freedom Planet 1, which was largely a single person accomplishment growing into a fairly size-able indie team. Especially since the first game was a Kickstarter Project and the sequel was entirely funded by that success. 

-=-=- Art -=-=-
The Art, and Character Design has taken a significant change of pace due to the inclusion of Tyson Tan, who did fan art of the various characters after the first game and was brought on to design the characters for the sequel. As a result, the design of the game has taken a notable change from the previous game's design limitations.

Lilac has had a huge overhaul in terms of her design, while the rest of the cast has remained largely the same. With some small changes here and there to accentuate their various quirks. 

-=-=-Gameplay-=-=-
Gameplay and Story is broken into a four character narrative with points where the story breaks off and the characters perform individual tasks related to their individual goals while beginning and ending at the same point. 

Each Character does play differently enough from each other, but I felt like Lilac, whose the series protagonist (and the frontliner, in Purple) at times feels like this game was designed around the other characters rather than her. 

Lilac (Purple Dragon) is defined as a ""Speed"" character, Carol (Green Cat) a ""Brawler"", Milla (A Dog that I keep thinking is a Rabbit) as an ""Explorer"" and Neera (Panda) with ""Power.""

Each Character has their own quirks, Lilac is quite mobile, Carol is designed more around the combat changes since the first game, Milla is geared towards exploring environments, and Neera is a hybrid of the three with her own unique quirks. 

Freedom Planet 2 has a much stronger emphasis on combat this time round, and I don't know how I feel about it. Each boss encounter involves breaking through a bosses defenses before hitting the boss again to remove a hit point. 

I NEVER figured out how to use the Guard  or Parry mechanic. There is nothing that explains how that works beyond a bit of tutorial text (without demonstration.) 

This makes boss fights potentially drag on quite a bit. As you get used to the nature of how the fight goes, and then you have to make sure to capitalize on opportunities as they come.

I didn't mind it, but I can see where people can get frustrated by it. So be aware. Beyond that, there was at least three bosses of note that felt like unnecessary difficulty spikes. 

As a change from the first game, there's a continue mechanic that involves spending the crystal currency you pick up during a given level to revive yourself either on the spot (with significantly less health) or at a check point for full health. I'd rather respawn at the point where I died then replay through a cutscene (even if you can skip it) to restart a fight. This felt like a feature that wasn't really thought out. 

Most levels consist of moving right, with the occasional left segment while trying to get to checkpoints. The levels are large and varied with some unique element to break them up. I found some of the ideas behind these levels to be rather enjoyable and they broke up what I expected from a 2D sidescroller. 

The levels can stretch into being rather long. These are not short 5 minute romps. Some can get upwards to 10-12 minutes from my experience. While they are rather large, I didn't have too many instances where I didn't know where to go or what to do. 

There is equipment this time round and it took a bit for me to get used to it. 

There are various potions that you can buy from Milla during the game that allot a small bonus to your game-play, such as increasing run speed, jump height, damage, defense, etc. They don't really explain how this mechanic works, so I had to figure out that you need to go to the bottle icon, then move over to the particular potion I wanted to add, then press ""up"" to add it to the bottle. This feels like an oversight.

There are also equipment you can find in chests, but these are rather well hidden. So I can't really comment on them as I found one that made the aforementioned Defense/Parry Mechanic worthless and nothing else. 

I beat the game as Lilac and started two alternative runs as Milla and Neera. Both of whom start out with the same starting mission and have the same cutscenes, but from different perspectives: which is a nice touch. 

There are moments where Carol and Milla leave the team, so I'm interested to see if those come with wholly unique levels. 

-=-=-Story-=-=-
There are two modes available, the intended ""Adventure"" mode which includes moving around an isometric map and checking in on non-combat and zones.

There is also a Classic Mode which skips the plot and goes from area to area with the non-combat areas linked together into one large (growing) shop to make various purchases. 

You do not need to have played the First Game to enjoy the sequel. As I didn't. I had watched a play-through of the First Game, but hadn't had the opportunity to pick it up. You will miss out on some context, some jokes, and references to the first game, but I don't feel it's totally necessary. 

Following from the Steam Page: The story consists of Merga, a Water Dragon freeing herself from a prison and her ambitions for the world at large. With the four aforementioned heroines getting wrapped up in trying to stop her from her goals. 

Freedom Planet 2 expands on the world around the three Kingdoms from the first game and continues from where it left off.

I can't really talk about the story without spoiling it, and I enjoyed my time with it. I didn't feel my time was wasted. 

-=-=-Final Thoughts-=-=-
I completed the game, as Lilac, at about 8 hours and started two separate runs as Milla and Neera. While there was initial interest in continuing to see how the other characters go through the plot, I don't know if I'll actually play through the game (at least right now anyway) with the others. 

If you're looking for a 2D Sidescroller that is evocative of (2D) Sonic, while trying to become it's own thing: then I'd recommend Freedom Planet 2. There's some growing pains, but the sequel builds on the original and is one of those cases where the second game IS better than the original.",1670401939,1670401939,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I have been eyeing this game for some time when i first learned of this game being made.  i saw the character previews, saw the adventure mode, saw the new character and just overall, excited for what adventure i would be going on after the first game that set things in motion, Freedom Planet, searing good memories into my brain with all that it had to offer.

With that said, OMG YES BUY THIS GAME, THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND CHARACTERS ARE STILL THE SAME IF NOT BETTER, THE MUSIC IS SO DAMN GOOD, IM STILL BOPPING MY HEAD TO THIS SOUNDTRACK.  THE STORY IS SO GOOD TOO AND NEVER AM I IN A DULL MOMENT WITH THIS GAME, I ONLY COMPLETED THE GAME WITH ONE THE CHARACTERS AND IM ALREADY WANTING TO COMPLETE IT WITH THEM ALL

But i do recommend you play the first game first because this game does have story elements that are connected to that one so do yourself a service and play that one before this one.  At the end of the day, you are getting yourself a great game and i can say that without hesitation-",1670172719,1670172719,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

A huge disappointment compared to the first game making a large amount of fundamental mistakes no platformer designer should make.

Let's start with graphics. Are they pretty and detailed? Yes. Do they go together? No. There is zero visual hierarchy between ground, enemies and platforms for 90% of the game, it actually hurts eyes when playing.
The Krita guy is on the team providing designs that didn't translate into pixel art at all. A giant mech is cool when it actually moves like a giant mech and not 2 jpegs. First game at least constructed it's enemies from more parts, this one uses so few most bosses look baffling, especially the green bird aka lancer, or parts of giant mech during transormation that literally look like they are tposing.

One would think that's already pretty bad - but there is more, and this time relating to gameplay. This game relies on BLOCKING for avoiding damage. A sonic style platformer on BLOCKING. Bosses feel right out of contra/mega man except you have neither precision nor range to deal with them in a fun way. So you mostly block till they are near you and then use your strongest attack. You never have an opportunity to use any other attacks, so they are kinda overall useless.

There is also awful screen crunch. You either play zoomed in and can't see anything cause it's always off-screen but still agroed and actively attacking, or camera zooms out massacring the pixel art cause i don't have 4k monitor, but at least it's playable that way.

Levels are overreliant on gimmicks and puzzles and most damage is pretty much unavoidable and they take 10-20 minutes on top of that. There is also  no singposting in terms of directions, and those levels want you to backtrack quite often.

The game wants you to play 4 times to get the full story for every character, but doesn't offer any new content besides their movesets, all of which feel awkward in context of level design and especially bosses. If you play only one character - you get the main plot, but every other character looks like unlikeable asshole because you see their actions but not motives. Did i mention one campaign is 20 hours long? Yeah.

I really loved the first game and was sure this one wouldn't disappoint, and it did in ways i couldn't even imagine, because 1st game's artstyle and levels seemed to be expertly designed, and even more annoying elements like having to manually charge dragon dash removed pretty early on.",1670154364,1670154364,False,5,3,0.446264445781707764,1,True,False,False,True,,,

New Entry: Fast Opportunity.

When the first game came out, we all have this proportionate expectation of the product coming out good or bad. While it isn't too good, it also wasn't that bad. This game is a huge step up from what they've put into, with simple controls (mostly) and high momentum potential. There can still be a few bugs, but it doesn't stop players who play this game casually, competitively or for completion.

Each character has their own unique dialogue in certain scenarios, including their own combat style. Much like the first, each scene is replicated in true action; by any means it isn't a still picture. Their personalities and purposes are deeply noticeable, but they hit hard (in a good way) in the heart and mind. The flow of the writing and levels, no matter which order it is chosen, makes sense and doesn't force you to go from a low difficulty to a higher one. The landscape is polished to visually appeal each level, map and hub. I certainly got stuck on the eye candy no doubt about it. If Avalice was a real place, well we wouldn't necessarily survive would we? Then again, those four aren't going to stop fighting chaos.

I would highly recommend this game to people who crave adrenaline, action and quirky characters.

Incredible follow-up to the original [i]Freedom Planet[/i] that improves upon it immensely. To list out the ways:

[list][*]The core ""what if [i]Sonic[/i], [i]Rocket Knight Adventures[/i] and [i]Mega Man X4[/i] got mixed in a blender"" conceit remains - you still run around ramps like the blue hedgehog and his buddies did on the Genesis while attacking with punches and kicks that don't feel dissimilar from swinging the Z-Saber around, which works better than it sounds owing to the lack of contact damage (enemies must be actively attacking or otherwise obviously spiky to hurt you). However, the returning non-Lilac characters have been heavily reworked such that they aren't so obviously worse than her this time around. Milla, in particular, went from a very technical character with slow-charging and clumsy attacks to a very versatile ranged character with multiple attack options always available. Carol's motorcycle is no longer made of toilet paper, and newcomer Neera can be a heavy damage-dealer if you practice a bit with her.
[*]The dodge mechanic adds so much to the gameplay flow that returning to the first game after playing this, I keep trying to dodge attacks and lamenting the move's absence. The timing is generous enough that even somebody as bad at parrying in a [i]Souls[/i] game like myself can make it work fairly regularly, and it's much more versatile than it first appears - as noted at the top of the review, I've seen speedruns of the volcano stage where the runner repeatedly lands in a large lava pool but takes no damage because the dodge is active just long enough to tank the hit and let them jump back out of it - a concept that is patently ridiculous in all the right ways.
[*]The relic and potion systems add some nice variety to the mix. Some can take the edge off a really tough boss fight if you're struggling, while the Brave Stones can bring out serious challenges like one-hit KOs or forcing time limits if you wish to get any crystal payout for clearing the stage. Some even have some fun synergies - one achievement specifically relies on the interplay between [spoiler]the relic that turns all crystals into health petals and the relic that turns all health petals into crystals, resulting in both turning into red crystals that add to your crystal count while slightly healing you[/spoiler].
[*]Lives actually mean something now; losing all of them will incur a penalty to your in-game spending money for the potions/music vinyls and decimate your ranking, instead of toothlessly letting you continue from the last checkpoint without penalty as the first game did. (If you're completely out of in-game cash, you can beat up a punching bag until you've earned the necessary fee, effectively paying in time instead. If this sounds like pay-to-win, don't fret - there is no premium currency in this game.)
[*]The boss battles remain the furious Treasure-inspired clashes they were in the first game, but are now even larger and intricate, and are considerably more plentiful. They're almost entirely joys to fight, which is good, because the game later pulls an id Software and makes some of them normal stage enemies.
[*]The graphics are considerably more detailed, fluid and well-drawn than the first time around. The nearly seven-year development period clearly paid off here, as well as the bump in vertical resolution from 240 to 360.
[*]The music is incredible. I think I may still be more partial to the soundtrack of the first game, but the stage themes have some serious jams in there - Zao Land, Shade Armory, Globe Opera 1 & 2, Zulon Jungle, Magma Starscape, Inversion Dynamo, all bangers.
[*]The plot of the first game was pretty clumsily delivered, all told, but this one manages to stick the landing without bombarding you with 12-15 minute plot dumps this time around. Maybe a low bar, but when it tackles heavy subject matter (colonialism, in this case), it doesn't come off nearly as tonally dissonant as the first game did with its infamous torture scene. Also, it has Christopher Sabat as not-Vegeta, so that kicks ass. (It should be noted, though, that as of writing, Classic Mode is locked behind beating the game once as any character; those who don't care for the plot will find themselves hitting ""Skip Scene"" a lot that first time through.)[/list]

However, if you are new to the Freedom Planet series, welcome! Enjoy this fast-paced platformer with great art design that may or may not have actual fursonas on display for everyone to see! If you want to play the first Freedom Planet game to catch up on plot, go right ahead and DON'T unspoiler the next section. That is just to get people caught up so that they don't have to play the first one, if they don't want to. I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU PLAY THE FIRST ONE FOR THE SOUNDTRACK HOWEVER. PLEASE PLAY FREEDOM PLANET 1. HOLY DOG, THAT GAME SLAPS.

If you don't want to play Freedom Planet 1, then the plot of Freedom Planet 1 is that [spoiler] a warlord crash landed on T h e  F r e e d o m P l a n e t - Avalice, then proceeded to fuck some shit up among three major cities, tortured two children, and got defeated in a way that the Kingdom Stone, a master emerald that was powering a city, got shattered and gave its energy to the whole planet. I explicitly mention the torture part because it's what piqued my interest in the series. You may judge me for that, but please realize extremely quickly that I am a total degenerate. [/spoiler]


This game plays like a combo of Shantae and Sonic. If you are a fan of those games, you'll love this game. Speedy platforming with large levels, player has a health bar and enemies that don't get taken down in a single hit. Although the levels are large, I never really felt myself getting fatigued or tired from playing in them. Edit: These stages are LONG. In a good way; you'll 100% be feeling like you got your money's worth.

Even though I've only played this game as Sash Lilac (and I'm not even finished), I can go ahead and say with great confidence that this game also is ""a banger"". While it doesn't have as many quirks as the first game (animated bloopers [?], goofy little things with menus, and overall feeling like a godlike fan game that JUST got by into getting released) as well as the soundtrack missing a certain energy*, I still think this game is very much worth every cent. Edit: I'm on my doge playthrough, Milia has the best sound design, but not too much story deviations so far. Feels like I'm playing the same game but as a different character. I feel that playing Neera will be the same. Kinda of a let down, but Milia and Neera are cool as fuck and the stages are pretty nice so I don't mind it.


* alot of the soundtrack in this game is missing... something and so feels alot of hit-or-miss than the first one. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it's less bass and beats? Maybe it's slower paced? Maybe it's the instrumentation? Maybe a little of all 3?)

게임 아직 중반도 안갔지만 평가 적는 이유는 단순히 어워드 때문에(...)...

제작자가 소닉의 그늘에서 벗어나고 독자적 게임을 만들려고 노력했다고 하는데 반은 성공했다고 생각합니다. 단순하지만 다체로운 액션, 지역마다 집어넣기 위해 고심한 각종 기믹들,  각 개성을 가진 캐릭터들 전부 마음에 듭니다. 반은 어쩔 수 없는 부분인데 속도감 있는 횡스크롤 플레이 게임이 근본 토대이기 때문에 해보면 여전히 소닉과 비슷한 느낌이 드는 건 어쩔 수 없습니다.

올해 해본 횡스크롤 도트 액션중에 닌자 거북이도 재미있었긴 했지만 그냥 별 생각 없이 존에서 내달리며 난장판을 만드는 느낌은 프리덤 플레닛이 최고라 이쪽에 손을 들어주고싶네요. 뭐가 우월하다라기보단 그냥 취향에 따라 갈리는 요소로 닌자거북이도 상당히 재미있게 했었습니다.

최근에 맥북을 구입했는데 맥에서 안돌아가는건 좀 아쉽긴 하네요. 패드만 연결되면 어디서든 즐길 수 있는 최고의 게임이라 생각하는데 말이죠.

If you haven't, I still think you'll love this.

The original was a brilliant throwback to Sonic and Gunstar Heroes, and this neatly distills the formula into an even better experience. The characters are all charming and play very unique and distinct from each other, so playing the game from one to another feels like an entirely different experience. The storyline is simple but entertaining, and if you don't care about that, there's a Classic Mode that just gives you the gameplay. It even has a few branching paths and a ""secret"" ending you can get under certain conditions. And for FP1 fans, you'll be happy to know the story pacing is much better here: you'll never be stuck in cutscenes for [i]too[/i] long before it's back to gameplay.

On a technical level, the levels are technically brilliant. (Eh? Ehhhh? Oh never mind...) They're huge with numerous pathways, and taking the time to explore can yield some nice bonuses, though nothing is stopping you from trying to speed through them. They're also a visual treat with excellent pixel art and gorgeous backgrounds. And just about every single one has some unique gimmick or mechanic that shows up just for that level and then may never come back again... no surprise to fans of FP1, which similarly featured unique one-and-done level mechanics: a testament to the love and dedication that went into the game at a fundamental level. And of course, each level is capped off with a highly unique boss battle.

It also helps that the controls are responsive and very easy to get the hang of, so if you're getting in trouble, it's not because the game is cheap, it's because you screwed up.

A big change to the game is the new Items and Potions that let you customize and modify your experience. Some of them can make the game easier, while others are designed to make it much harder. More health, more lives, more speed? Not a problem. You'd rather play the game as a one-hit KO? Also not a problem!

In terms of criticism, I don't have much, but here goes:
-The music is still great, but I don't think it has quite as many earworms as FP1. None of it is ever annoying or uninspired, but I don't find myself humming it quite like I did the first game. And that's the meanest thing I can say about an OST that is still stellar.
-The game is also significantly harder than FP1, which might be a plus for some folks. Admittedly, that's partly because the game really expects you to get good and use the new Guard mechanic and the Items and Potions, but, on the other hand, those aspects aren't taught as well as they could be either, even in the optional tutorial.

Those minor gripes aside, this game is well worth your time and money. If you're a fan of retro throwbacks or just excellent gameplay in general, I highly recommend this one. Hopefully we get a Freedom Planet 3 within the next decade!",1669421232,1669421232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

And now after waiting almost 7 years, listening to the Alpha OST religiously, seeing awesome fan art and watching the community grow, Freedom Planet 2 is finally here. 

And it's bigger and better than before!

The gameplay is greatly expanded upon with the characters feeling a lot more versatile thanks to some new moves such as Lilac's Boost Breaker, Carol's Jump Disc and Milla's Cube Blaster. And the new playable character, Neera can be very satisfying once you get the hang of her powerhouse-like playstyle. 
The addition of a dodge button, the various hub worlds, the ability to revive yourself at the cost of a stock Smash-Bros style and ways to customise your play experience with the Potions, Brave Stones and various other difficulty options are very welcome.
And the stages are still as fun, creative and action packed as ever, with big shout outs to Airship Sigwada, Globe Opera and Tidal Gate to name a few.

One of my only real gripes with the first game as fun the story was, there were things that the game either forget to tell about or weren't properly explained such as the character's backstories. Not only does this game ""mostly"" address them, but greatly expands on the lore and world-building with it's more in-depth story and characters. There are a lot of fun and heartfelt moments along with some interesting themes,  twists and stuff left open for a potential sequel.

Story is interesting and good to see it focus on threat that comes from  the Avalice itself and gives us reason to learn more of the history of the world while trying to stop it and fact characters stories have more separate branches while seemgly not making any exclusive locations to accomodate these is nice touch, also true ending might be oen of the strongest emotional moments i expirianced in games for a long while but it's a secret for reason so no spoilers

Movement is really feeling good and rewards keeping up the speed, but also gives a lot of room for choosing different paths, even if it might seem like there is a lot of automation actually a lot of elements still demand active imput to keep working, but downside to it is there isn't as much to seek for on stages as in previous game, which helps with making stages be more streamlined and allowe better speedrun tactics but lostbit of a charm of previous games slightly labirynthian stage desing, also addition of rail gringing is fun, adds a lot of spectacle and dynamic sections but fact that to change direction of it we need to disconnect from the rail makes it feel unfinished, and seem to be actively makign some platformign sectiosn relying on rails feel bit awkward to pull off without skipping rail grinding entierly 

Combat again feels very well weaved into speedster platforming, with quite decent amount of new options to  work with, entire new guard mechanis (which honetly feels more like a doge but it's a nitpick on naming) giving even more invisiframes to use when trying to avoid taking damage, definetly comes in handy, especially that for side activities like restorign the gallery, or buing items to get ""Treassure hunter"" achievment secondary currency, cores, are pretty much neccessary and they only drop after defeating enemies (some types of enemies don't drop them but haven't seen a stage without any core dropping ones mixed in), also change that really huert me in my playtrough was redusing amount of health we get back while using extra life (now named stock), in previous game it was half the health by default, now it's like one point and can be brought back to 3 with potions but still feels like harsh change, especially that alternative of coming back with full health but on checkpoint can often mean loss of a lot of progress

New item system feels like really fun way to manually adjust dificulty  of the game to your own preferences, feel like there could still be more room for different bravestone modifiers to play around with challenging effects but current set already gives plenty of options

The overworld map system is really nice, having to watch the big scale overview of locations we explore, seeing some changes happening to map as we progress the story, also some clever ways to to spice up traversing across certain natural barriers, one  nitpick is that 2 specific trasnsitions (from Parusa to Sky Bridge and from Sky Bridge to Paraise Prime) are bit lengthy, put back to back and considering i had to do them a lot wehn getting all vinyls and items for achievemnts they started getting on my nerves

Over all fun game for fans of speedster platformers, still think might be better entry point for people new to the genre than 1st game with item system, but story does have a lot of plot points that are explained well enough but might feel exagerated without expiriancing story of 1st game",1669265133,1669265133,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Sanik was advertised like gotta go fast. But when it finally came out people instead got a slow and tedious generic platformer with a lot of dying, slow moving platforms and even going left. No matter what it tries, the franchise still can’t deliver on their promise (if we don’t count the endless runners for smartphones). Even the best sanik games allow to go fast only to the peak sportsmen who memorized the layouts and are younger than mid 20s when the human brain stops developing and starts rotting into alzheimer. The general public has to stumble and fail and go slow across the stupid platforms.

Freedom Planet was on the the right path of fixing sanik. The game made the levels almost play themselves on normal difficulties and offered a ton of HP. They still weren’t perfect choose your own roller-coasters, but you could go fast. To add more gameplay to the game it has tough bosses. On the normal difficulty you still can face-roll through all the levels yet be stuck on a boss-fight for an hour. The challenge was pleasant and offered a good contrast. Only a couple of bosses were drawn-out fights of attrition.

Having a platformer about meaningful speed is what sanik imagined. But it never achieved it, and the popularity of infinite runners proves that people want that.

Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment.

People expect sequels to improve upon the game, to keep the good parts and fix the bad parts. Even the Assassin’s Creed‘s sequel somehow became a playable game compared to the first one. I waited 7 years for this game. But rather than improving upon the first game it went far in other direction. It’s not sanik-1-bad but it is very bad. Instead if making the sequel tighter they decided to make it phatter with unnecessary clutter.

You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! 

The entire level-design is unnecessary clutter. Instead of doubling down and making levels longer and even more streamlined, it made them into the giant buggy repetitive directionless convoluted slog of sanik labyrinth. There is a ton of dumb platforming and stupid no-brain puzzles. You don’t go fast to the right, you wander around in samey-looking rooms made of the same elements and hit the dumb walls all the time. There is a lot of precise platforming and waiting for the platforms to appear or move nearer.

There’s a terrible mandatory scroll-shooter section, and your weapons are garbage while the enemies are giving you bullet hell. And everything is filled with unnecessary clutter, it’s impossible to read the screen behind all those stupid explosions and to see your hitbox in relation to dangerous bullets.

When you get to play as a giant robot, instead of being the coolest part of the game like in Enclave or Psychonauts, it’s the worst part of the game. The robot can’t kill anything, the tiny enemies are not even damaged by it. It can’t traverse the level specifically made for it, it doesn’t fit anywhere and you have to get lucky to squeeze it through the narrow ways you are actually supposed to go through. It controls like an absolute arse.
But well, all controls in the game are fiddly and unresponsive. Even if you get the result you wanted, you still achieve it not through synergy with the game’s systems, but by unsure suggestions and leeway.

The levels are filled to the brim with stupid suckerpunch enemies and traps. Whose idea it was to add scam foes that kite you no matter the speed you are running at? They are always out of your reach but tie their damage output to your position. The game is dispensing unavoidable damage unless you slow down to a crawl. And not only you have to do that to avoid damage but to deal it too. All the enemies instead of dying from one hit are severe damage sponges. Even the first enemy in the game in the tutorial takes several hits on normal. That is if you can even hit it. And unlike sanik you don’t deal damage while jumping. You receive it. All of this is killing the pacing, who thought that adding a ton of combat into sanik can improve it? What is this, Freedom Unleashed?

All of the combat is unnecessary clutter. Your boost deals barely any damage and it is hard to aim. It’s more of a traversal power than a combat ability, despite granting invincibility. The spin doesn’t drain the meter anymore but its attack is very weak too, and also it’s hard to hit anything with it. Well it’s hard to hit anything with anything because all the enemies have annoying hitboxes. Yet they all are made of lava and easily deal damage to your giant hitbox without even touching it. The stupid block button (because a sanik game needed a stupid block button) repositions you back into damage. And well stunlocks for 50% damage is a common occurrence.

Most of the bosses in the first game were an enjoyable challenge. You can clearly see what you have to do and you are doing it. But this time the bosses are spazzing boring damage-soakers that are often turn the game into a bullet hell. A lot of them outright run away off-screen so you can’t even reach them while they pour death from above. They are plain not fun, starting with the first one, their patterns are primitive and there is no agency. But they have absolute tons of HP and just soak damage for an hour. The final boss is cancer. You have to beat her three times before you get a checkpoint while she fills the screen with unpredictable damage. Good luck fighting a one-armed bandit with dogshit controls, dogshit hitboxes, dogshit jumps and dogshit combat. The house always wins.

And all of that is enveloped with a terrible unnecessary clatter overworld map. Like, okay, you want to allow people to replay the levels and you’ve added asinine grind for money and materials. You’ve added shops selling the collectibles and garbage skills that are mostly useless. But why the absolute hell the navigation on the map is so bad? Why the hell it is multiscreen and with terrible node positions instead of unambiguous orthogonal roads between them? Why it wastes so much time on walking? Why it locks you away from the shops and earlier levels during the mid-game? Why the hell you are offered to chose one of the three levels all the time, if you play all three anyway? If there’s an overworld why lock that choice instead of offering branching paths? If there’s an overworld why is there no character selection screen? Why do you have to create a separate profile and be stuck with your choice? And yes there is no pause button on the map screen it still blasts music on focus loss.

The adventures of Lavaboy and Sharkgirl in 3-D

The story is unnecessary clutter. The first game featured teenedgy trash barely comprehensible convoluted story with terrible fandub voice acting. And it all is fitting and the characters are kinda endearing.

But this time we have to suffer through barely comprehensible convoluted story with terrible fandub voice acting that thinks it’s Zookeeper’s Schindler visiting John Raabe in Nanking. It’s second-hand embarrassing baby hitler dindunaffin. It’s a boring and self-serious garbage with more holes than a black hole. [url=https://milkandhate.wordpress.com/2022/11/24/freedom-planet-2/]The part about the story where she screams ""freedomin' time"" didn't fit here due to characters limit[/url]

I wanted to love this game, i went out of my way to purchase it by any means necessary once i saw that it was finally released. But before the 30% completion i realized that this is just mentally draining and embarassing, that i hate it and never want to see it again. And that’s before my life has turned into constant existential dread with me hoping for any game to be at least just a little bit not terrible so it can give me a small respite. I had to force myself to finish it, a level per several days.

Freedom Planet 1 happens to be the first game I remember buying on Steam within launch week, and I had fun exploring the levels, listening to the soundtracks, trying out the different characters.

Fast forward to 2022 and we now have Freedom Planet 2, and the developers definitely have much more work invested here. More levels (more than double the size of the first game), more soundtracks, a longer storyline, more characters, more pixels! The stages also all have something setting themselves apart from each other, each stage has its own theme / gimmick. They even threw in extra stuff like the museum and battlesphere which are decent additions.

This 2nd game seems to have taken at least 8 years to release, and that's already with some ideas scaled back or left out, so that they could release what we have today. The plus side is, the devs are quick to try and fix/patch most bugs.

If a 3rd game is planned, count me in as one of those excited for it.

The first game was already stellar, but with the hype that built up over the game's development cycle, the new eager fans (myself included) who got caught up in the wave from the console ports of the first game, and a highly passionate team with high ambitions, how did this sequel fare? I'll cut to the chase: it did [i]amazingly well.[/i]

Picking up three years after the end of the previous game, although Brevon's been long gone since his invasion of Avalice, a lasting peace has been difficult, what with a recent string of mysterious attacks. As such, Lilac, Carol, and Milla, our heroines, are summoned by the Royal Magister of Shang Tu to help investigate the matter and figure out what exactly is going on, with Lieutenant Neera Li accompanying them on their mission. What starts out as some seemingly disconnected incidents, however, lead back to a phantom from Avalice's past, one who has spent the past three years plotting her revenge...

Summary aside, this game's story is absolutely stellar, helped by there being an actual writing team this time. The main cast's gotten older and wiser, the new characters, heroic and antagonistic alike, are incredibly written, making their arcs and character dynamics very compelling, and had me appreciate those I already did [strike]Milla[/strike] even more than before. What also helps is the strong VA work by everybody on the cast, be it the returning faces such as Dawn M. Bennett (Lilac), Edwyn Tiong (The Magister), and Alejandro Saab (Zao), or the new additions to the cast, such as Christopher Sabat (Askal), Morgan Berry (Merga), and Lindsay Jones (Corazon). Even better, the voice acting quality is consistent by virtue of Christopher Sabat allowing the cast to record in his studio, Okratron 5000. I admit, my earlier summary of the story is only scratching the surface, but given how it's so impactful in its writing and handles really well heavy subjects in its back half,[spoiler]especially that of colonialism and its related subjects,[/spoiler]I do hope you forgive me for not elaborating much more on that matter. Trust me, it's well worth it.

On the gameplay side, the returning playable cast feel amazing in motion, having picked up new tools that extend their already solid moveset (Lilac's Boost Breaker and Blink Dash), address their old moveset's key shortcomings (Carol's new melee options, Jump Disc, and bike reworks), or both (Milla's revamped Phantom Cube gameplay and her new melee attacks). Neera, an NPC and boss turned playable, also feels quite solid in motion, being lacking in a solid airgame but compensating with a strong combat-oriented movepool that can melt bosses when used right. This great feel, supplanted with the incredibly versatile new guard technique, works in tandem amazing well with the stage design, covering all kinds of fun challenges, from the pipe networks in Sherlin Park to the amusement park feel that is Zaoland. The strong stage design is complimented with some incredible bosses that are tough, but all manageable and satisfying to defeat, even if some of them, during endgame especially, ask players to have a strong understanding of all their tools to overcome them.

The sound design is as strong as ever, with the stage themes covering all kinds of great moods that match their stages, the map themes suiting the overall feel of their areas, and the new hub areas having great songs to accompany their more downtime-oriented design. Leila Wilson (otherwise known as Woofle) and Falk Au Yeong have created some incredible compositions that help make the game incredibly memorable.

Visually...it's sprite art. Need I say any more? The art shift away from the chibi style to a more proportioned design, beyond acting as a great look at how the cast's matured, also manages to make them look just as adorable as they were before, or even moreso [strike]Milla[/strike] with all the great animation that game has to compliment its sprites. On top of that, the various locations, stages, maps, and hubs alike, are incredibly beautiful and make them an even bigger joy to run through. Just be mindful of some latergame stages, the shaders they use for their 3D elements isn't exactly the nicest on older systems, although it's nothing unplayable.

Overall, this game is an indie masterpiece that has had so much love put into it, I could go on and on about what I enjoyed, [i]and this is only scratching the surface.[/i] I wholeheartedly recommend this game to fans of the first game, Treasure fans, Sonic fans, or just anyone in general looking for a really good indie platformer.

As músicas me marcam, os chefes são difíceis se for ficar muito ousado. As fazes não são entediantes, sempre tem algo pra você fazer seja procurar os discos ou upgrade ou apenas aproveitar o cenário e a pixel art muito belas.
Tem cidades onde você pode ir e conversar com as pessoas, cada um com sua personalidade única e desing furry bem fofinho que o artista faz, assim você não sente que o mundo é só ""vai lá e bate nos caras maus""
Você pode tirar fotos no meio do seu jogo, e fazer poses! pegar momentos engraçados com isso é maravilhoso, tipo um míssel vindo na sua direção e você consegue pegar perfeitamente o momento que ele esta colado na face do personagem.
As músicas como do primeiro jogo são expetaculares, combinam perfeitamente com cada cada fase englobando seu estilo. Fase de máquinas? Uma música mais intrustrial e eletrônica! Fase num parque? Uma música bem divertida e energizada como a própria fase que chove inimigos.

Sem contar a trilha sonora de cada personagem que tem.
Muitas conquistas! Uma vilã foda, um mapa onde você pode escolher ir pra onde você quiser, Rank's, treinamento que pela primeira vez em um jogo foi a primeira coisa que fui fazer e eu tomei um pau.
Se eu não passar 100 horas nesse jogo, eu provavelmente terei morrido de alguma coisa, porque puta que pariu

[h2] Mediocre Early Game [/h2]
Many of the games early stages are relatively weak. ([b]If you're looking to use steam's refund period as a trial, make sure to select ""Robot Rampage"" when you have the option[b], this will get you to the good stages earlier) Not terrible, but not great either. (Avian Museum, Airship Sigwada, Zao Land, and Shenlin Park) There are some pretty rough issues distinguishing the background from the foreground, and unmemorable music and bosses. There's also some pretty rough camera issues, where you need to maintain a high speed to see what's ahead of you, even in some enclosed boss fights. I didn't hate it, but it certainly left a weak first impression compared to it's predecessor. None of this is helped by long, insignificant cutscenes and constantly throwing you into hub areas.

[h2] Great Midgame, Excellent Endgame [/h2]
Thankfully, though, the game gets much better about a third of the way in (*if you follow the recommended stage order, some can be done out of order) Bosses get good, then great, most of the soundtrack is amazing, and it's clear what is actually a solid object (thank god.) There are triggers that zoom the camera out when you need to see what's around you - these were notably missing in the levels I mentioned above.

By the final stretch of my first playthrough, I was thoroughly in love. Once the game picked up, it never let me down. The last few stages were some of the best.

This is a very long game though, at least for what it is. There 24 lengthy stages and an average playthrough lasts a little under 10 hours. Don't try to do it all in one go or you [i]will[/i] get burnt out before the end. It also supports framerates well above 60, which is sadly rare for 2D games.

[h2] Technical Issues [/h2]
I played the game about two months after launch, and only experienced a two major gameplay issues, both of which are now fixed. At launch, it was seemingly pretty buggy, but now seems rock solid.

There is one major issue though, the game doesn't scale properly to resolutions above 1080p, leading to a slightly blurry image. The game's pixel art is lovely, and look better with sharper pixels. I use the app [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/]Lossless Scaling[/url] set to nearest neighbor for my 1440p monitor. It works great, but you really shouldn't need a piece of paid external software for your game to look right. This is being looked into, but as of writing there's doesn't seem to be a fix in the works.",1668787220,1668787220,True,0,0,0.486725687980651855,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Freedom Planet 2 comes with EXCELLENT world building, acting, levels, bosses, difficulty, writing, and it comes packaged with the same old charm. One thing I was really worried about going from FP1 to FP2 is I wouldn't like the designs present here as much as I did before. However in-game they felt right at home, and really enhanced and highlighted exactly how dull the designs were prior.

The animations were excellent, the pixel art this time around got such a beautiful boost, no longer looking muddy at times, and generally looking like a place I would love to live in. I would love to go Parusa with it's wonderful lush tropical landscape or Shang Tu, with it's gorgeous locals and bright blue cities.

Something else I realy loved was the episodic format. Whether it's the Battlesphere or uncovering what is the cause of the mysterious snow, or even just trying to stop Sky Pirates from invading the Museum, it is a pure delight to go through everything each area has to offer.

There was an excellent replay value where damn near every section of the story had something new to discover from another characters view, and I can't wait to play this game over and over.

But I'm giving a negative review because of one big problem. And it's a warning to potential buyers: Of all the games I played in my life, this is the only one that gave me motion sickness and almost made me puke.
Some levels when they are really cluttered visually, and when you are going really fast can make you sick. The Battlesphere and the Lava / volcano levels later in the game are prime examples.

And the boss that came after the lava levels had a background animation that was going so fast, not only was it distracting, it also gave me motion sickness and I just had to quit the game.

If you had experience with motion sickness while playing games, don't buy this game and instead check out the first game. As for the others who didn't experience any, be careful.

I also feel it's necessary to point out that this game has really impressive visuals and set pieces for a 2d platformer. The soundtrack is also host to many bangers.

Freedom Planet might have started out as a love letter to Sonic, but it improves on and surpasses it in almost every way. The tight gameplay, the flow of the levels, the incredible bosses, the lovely art, and the 10/10 soundtrack easily make this one of my games of the year. If there's any part of you that likes 2D action games, you owe it to yourself to play this.

By and large Freedom Planet 2 is very reminiscent of the first game, though you don't have to have played FP1 to enjoy it. It's a bigger, slicker, tighter, and better paced experience than the original, hitting all of the same highs while offering more than twice as much game this time around. 

The gameplay has seen numerous small improvements like the addition of one or two extra moves for each character, along with a parry button that really helps take some of the boss fights to the next level. It's amazing to maintain your speed and momentum mid-fight by parrying your way through an attack rather than having to slow down and carefully dodge.

The storytelling, as well, is probably the most notably improved area compared to the prequel. The FP games are bubbly and enthusiastic, but they do read like Sonic fanfiction at times. This is part of their charm for me, but regardless of whether the cheesy blend of silly humour and high drama works for you, it's delivered in a far more digestible manner this time around. FP1 suffered from trying to cram a world full of political factions, side characters, and interplanetary war into a linear action game, with cutscenes sometimes just as long as the levels they followed. FP2 carries all of this over, but with more stages and hub areas full of optional dialogue to dilute the cutscenes, resulting in much better pacing overall. The script also feels tighter, with the humour hitting the mark more often and the world building feeling natural rather than bloated.

The addition of a fourth playable character and a bunch of optional challenges also helps to flesh out the playtime. If you want hours and hours of Freedom Planet, this game has it for you. This does lead into my one criticism of the game, though; while I'd say the overall quality of the experience is easily on par with FP1, it feels a bit more stretched. I found the gimmicky stages to be more conspicuous in FP2, and some of them felt like misfires. While it does modulate the pacing to intersperse fast actiony levels with slower puzzley and exploration-based ones, the action stages are universally better suited to the game's mechanics. I found the dedicated boss stages a lot more enjoyable than the ones that had me backtracking in multiple directions or hunting down keys to progress. I wouldn't have minded if the game had fewer, but more tightly designed levels.

I could gush for a long time about how awesome some of the boss fights are, how many bangers the soundtrack has, or how the game pulls off a finale that's both similar and different enough from FP1 to stand toe-to-toe with it, but it's easier to just say that this game is incredible. Galaxy Trail have succeeded in putting out a fantastic sequel to Freedom Planet that I hope garners all the recognition it deserves some day.

On the gameplay side of things, each character handles well and can take advantage of weaving their way through the multiple pathways of each stage in their own unique fashion. Some characters are better suited fr specific purposes however: Lilac is great for speed and would generally be considered the easy mode, whereas Neera is a boss killer whom lacks mobility in comparison to the other heroins. Speaking of bosses, they're all a treat to fight, having well telegraphed attack patterns and make good use of the games' new dodge mechanic, but some less experienced players may have trouble with the insane speeds of later ones. To compensate for players of all skill levels, the settings menu has a plethora of accessibility options including free revives, auto guarding, reducing the cost of continues and increasing the sensitivity of the screen zoom out, among others. In addition to these options, if they weren't enough the game itself includes a shop system, accessed from vendors in hubs. As a side note these hubs all have their own atmosphere and incredibly charming NPCs that add to the feeling of this world being alive. Most of them have unique dialogue linking to different story events, some dialogue being character specific. Anyways, the shop system acts as a way for players to spend their currency rewarded by exploring stages on a multitude of items that either assist players, or hinder them in exchange for a higher rank and crystal bonus at the end of stages. If you want to be an absolute powerhouse then you can equip yourself with a full attack potion if you really want to, but if you want to go for those elusive rainbow S ranks, try using on hit KO and get through a stage without being damaged at all. Thankfully the ranking system has no in game effects outside of achievements and a higher bonus, so going after high ranks isn't necessary if it's not comfortable. Freedom planet 2 takes you on a tour of Avalice, with stunning visuals, amazing level design, a banging soundtrack, endearing characters, a smooth difficulty curve and bosses with so much spectacle. it's one of the most fun and well crafted experiences I've had in a video game and if you couldn't already tell, I love it to death.

  When Freedom Planet 1 came out in 2014, it quickly became my Game of the Year, and in 2015, a sequel was announced, but I never expected for it to come out seven fucking years later, after I had accumulated over 57 hours of playtime in the first title at the time of this writing, now, seven years is a long time, but was the wait worth it? Spoilers, it was, just look at my playtime for FP2, but now I'll tell you why this sequel works so well.

Graphics

  No joke, this is the best-looking 2D indie game I've ever seen. FP2 genuinely reminded me of Castlevania Symphony of the Night when it came to background detail and sheer amount of animation frames for anything, from the main characters to enemies and citizens you can talk to, every single level looks drop-dead gorgeous and even the most non-important NPC looks great and have way more frames of animation than they needed, but the artists went above and beyond anyway.

  The first game already had a solid presentation, but the sequel improves on it even further, there are even some 3D models this time around, which made the SOTN parallels stronger, and just like in that game, they don't look out of place because they were used for things that would've been difficult if not outright impossible to pull off in traditional 2D, and if they could, wouldn't have nearly as much impact.

  FP1 already looked like a Saturn game, but FP2 looks even more like one with the combination of richly-detailed 2D sprites and backgrounds with 3D models. However, my one and only complaint about the visuals would be the completely static water in Paradise Prime, considering how perfect this game looks, a small lake that doesn't animate in any way sticks out like a sore thumb.

Sound

  Woofle returns as this game's composer, and just like with the first game, she absolutely nailed the soundtrack, with catchier songs and now there are way more of them, you know it's going to be good when even the songs that play in the World Map are absolute bangers. I'm not a musician, so I have no way of describing what makes this soundtrack so good, you just have to take my word for it.

  The sound effects are just as good, if not even better than in the first title, no complaints there, they're still very distinct and I would never mistake where they came from if I heard them outside of this game.

Story

  Now here's a surprise, the story in Freedom Planet 1 was a very contentious topic and I have good news for everyone, the second game has improved the narrative quite a bit, with dark themes but without any overly indulgent scenes like the infamous electrical torture scene in FP1.

  It shows restraint, and I really like how playing as different characters led to different dialogue in some cutscenes, the first game already had that, but with the much lengthier campaign and more exclusive scenes, it makes playing as all four characters more worth it this time around.

  The voice acting has also recieved a noticeable improvement, dialogue was recorded in a professional studio so no longer there are differences in audio quality, returning actors improved their performances even more compared to the first title and the new actors have very solid delivery.

The only mixed bag for me about the story would be the villain, while her motivations are much more understandable compared to Brevon in FP1, in my opinion she is nowhere near as charismatic, Brevon was a bastard but he was OUR bastard, while Merga didn't really win me over. Towards the end of the game she also makes a questionable decision, especially considering her culture, but I won't go into spoilers.

Gameplay

  The high-speed action platformer formula returns in this sequel, with even more improvements, some subtle, others not so much. Starting with the obvious enhancements, characters control and feel even more responsive, the screen sometimes zooms out to give you a better field of view (and you can adjust it in the options menu!), a world map has been implemented, hub levels are a thing and now there is a dodge button, which gives you invincibility frames when you press it.

  Not gonna lie, when I started playing this game, I almost never used the dodge, but as the levels became more intense and more stray projectiles started flying over the screen, I was constantly pressing that button, and the same thing happened with the bosses.

  Level design became bigger and bolder, and for the most part, it works wonderfully, I can safely say that 95% of the levels in this game are a blast to play, and even the worst stages in the game are nowhere near as painful as, say, the worst levels in the Mega Man X series, if you're familiar with those. If not, then rest assured, you ain't gonna die a million times and spend an ungodly amount of time trying to get past them. Rule of thumb is, if the level you're in ain't called Inversion Dynamo, you're good. The other weak levels are just jank.

  If 95% doesn't sound like a good enough percentage for you, let me put this into perspective: It took me over 10 (probably closer to 20) playthroughs for me to achieve my current playtime in Freedom Planet 1. In Freedom Planet 2, I got 49 hours on it (at the time of this writing, of course) after only four. This is a MUCH longer game, with a lot more content waiting to be seen by the player. Granted, I played on Adventure Mode, which has cutscenes, but even then, there are way more levels in this game and some of them can be very long - I don't have a problem with long levels as long as they're interesting and checkpoints are well-placed, and the long bois in Freedom Planet 2 pass that test with flying colours.

  Aside from the regular levels, Freedom Planet 2 also added Hub levels, which have no enemies and it's just you, vibing and talking to NPCs (there are a LOT of them, too), and ocasionally, playing a minigame or just admiring the scenery.

  No longer used just for extra lives, crystals can also be exchanged for gold gems, which are used to buy various items, many of which helpful in nature, such as giving you a Damage Over Time effect when you hit an enemy (particularly helpful for bosses) or giving you an extra life petal, while others increase the game's difficulty in various ways and give you access to higher rankings (without those items, the best rank you can get in a level is A).

  The biggest addition in terms of side content, however, is the Battlesphere, which might sound familiar to anyone that played the Ratchet & Clank games, it's an arena with various challenges, boss rematches and a baseball minigame, and as the game goes on, more of those first two unlock, and in fact, beating all challenges is mandatory to obtain the best ending, but it's not the most difficult ""good ending"" to get I've seen in a game.

  Speaking of difficulty, Freedom Planet 1 was a challenging game, and while the sequel might be easier in some aspects, it can be more difficult in others, such as boss fights, in my opinion some of these tough boys 'n gals can be harder than even the last boss of the first game, but at the same time, these fights are QUICK, if they last over two minutes, either the boss has a big health bar or something's going horribly wrong. You die fast, but so do your enemies, and that's exactly the kind of boss fight I prefer in games.

Conclusion

  I spent two hours writing this review just to try to convince more people to buy Freedom Planet 2, especially that coward Woolie, and the only way I have of finishing up here is, just try it - There's a demo and if you want to see more of the game, within the 2-hour refund period you can get a good glimpse of what it has to offer, especially if you skip cutscenes. Freedom Planet 1 is no longer my favourite indie game of all time because its sequel is now finally out.

Much like its predecessor, Freedom Planet 2 is a side-scrolling, platforming adventure along the same vein as classic Sonic the Hedgehog games.  But Freedom Planet 2 has improved upon the original in almost every way, having grown from its Sonic-inspired roots into something more distinctive and unique.  Freedom Planet 2 feels much more fleshed out with a lot more story, which is just what I was craving most from the original; I wanted to learn more about these characters and this universe, and Freedom Planet 2 scratched that itch; though having played through all four characters' campaigns with the ""true ending,"" questions around the history of Avalice remain,  which I hope to see answered in future Freedom Planet games, DLC, or other media.  Even if you haven't played the original (which you absolutely should), Freedom Planet 2 is well worth a playthrough.  


The full review:
Much like the original Freedom Planet, this is a side-scrolling platformer featuring four playable heroines, each one with their own style and characteristics.  Your first play through will be in Adventure Mode, which in my opinion is the best way to experience the game, because one thing FP2 does way better than the original is story.

Cutscenes and dialogue flow better than they did in the original, with quality voice acting and funny moments throughout.  Many of these scenes are the same regardless of which character you play, but some are exclusive to each character, so to get the full story you'll have to play through as all four characters, but in my opinion that is just part of the fun!

Gameplay is pretty simialr to FP1, except now we have more fine-tuned controls and returning characters have had their move-sets reworked. The biggest feature is the introduction of Guarding, allowing you to completely evade damage if well timed.  Traversing levels and battling bosses feels much more fluid and is super satisfying. 

The art style has been greatly improved upon from the FP1 style, and the levels themselves sport unique themes and charm, complete with amazing background music, much like the levels of FP1 did.  While FP2 dropped the collectible Cards of FP1, there are still secrets to be found within the levels, primarily Vinyls to unlock music and a few Brave Stones.

Speaking of which, Brave Stones and Potions are a new feature added to enhance the gameplay.  Throughout your adventure you will collect Gems and Orbs, both of which can be exchanged into Gold Gems. Gold Gems are rarely found within levels too.  You can mix and match Potions to give yourself different buffs, such as increasing attack damage or making your attacks heal you a little bit.  Brave Stones can also offer buffs, but many act as difficulty multipliers, and you are rewarded with extra Gems for completing levels with detrimental Brave Stones equipped. I love this system because it allows players to tailor the difficultly to their liking, and gives them options if they find themselves struggling at a particular area.

Additionally, if you're the completionist type, there's a Gallery in Adventure Mode that you can donate resources to in order to complete exhibits.  They're neat to look at, but in my opinion the main treat here is that you get access to a special gallery upon completing all the exhibits.  This special gallery shows off some behind-the-scenes stuff from the development of FP2, including early concept art and scrapped assets, so if you're into that kind of stuff, completing the Gallery is a worthwhile endeavor!

As a final point, I've noticed some comments about issues playing the game (crashes, softlocks, etc.) so if you experienced problems before, I'd recommend giving the game another try.  The Developers have already released several updates to fix bugs and even add a few new features; it's obvious to me that this game was a labor of love for them and that they want this to be the best experience it can be after all this time since FP1. :)

All in all, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with Freedom Planet 2.  At the time of my writing this, I've completed all four characters' stories in Adventure Mode and unlocked all but two secret achievements.

Both games feel like a cross between 2d Sonic and Megaman Zero to me, with the focus on mobility and ability to speedrun levels combined with a health bar and focus on melee combat: especially against bosses.

The biggest change is the dodge button, which puts your character into an invulnerable state briefly, lasting a bit longer if something that would have hit them is blocked, while preventing them from attacking for the duration with a brief but potentially punishing cooldown. This can let you take down bosses aggressively with good timing.

Each character moves and fights differently, with an expansion on the movesets of Freedom Planet and good use of a quickly refilling Energy meter tied to signature moves.

For instance, Carol the Wildcat is the only one that can roll and do Megaman X style wall kicks, with three unique attack options in the air. Her signature move is the Jump Disk, which she throws in a direction of your choosing for decent damage, and can jump to it for roll damage and invincibility frames for a time, comboing into her aerial moves.

Neera the Frost Night, on the other hand, has a double jump, lunge combo, down attack, slower hits with a bit more reach, a focus state where she attacks faster, and what I'd call spells that use a full energy meter each and come in big vertical attack, freeze/ damage horizontal projectile, or a down attack that makes ice traps she can consume to bounce off of.

The stages and bosses are (mostly) the same for different characters with, but they all have some exclusive scenes and information to their point of view for extra variety.

The story fits the old mix of a lighthearted base with big stakes and darker moments overshadowing it, and being able to talk to NPCs in hubs really fleshes out the world.

If you liked the first one buying this is a no brainer: if you haven't tried it I'd recommend starting with the first for context, though I think this is the superior game.",1666836386,1666836386,True,1,0,0.50437319278717041,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I have waited a long time for this game and i can definitely say that it was worth the wait. Freedom Planet 1 was pretty much my favorite game of all time and they managed to make something that i love even more and i'm very thankful for every hour that was spend with making this game!!

The Levels are incredibly creative and every single one of them has something special that makes it stand out. The Leveldesign is also absolutely amazing, really intuitive and fluid. The controls are just as fluid and it's just fun to move the Character around. The Bosses are also really creative and can be a great challenge, once you've learned them you can whack them easily and that's really fun! So yea, everything about the Gameplay is perfection! 

The pixel art is probably the most beautiful pixel art that i have ever seen, espacially the Hub Worlds are so pretty. Same goes for the Character and Enemy desings, really detailed and you can tell that there was put a lot of love and care into designing everything. 

The music is just as great as in the first one, pretty much every song is a banger. Only complaint is that it often sounds a little too soft, i prefer the powerful songs with guitars in it and there was a little less of that in this game then i would have liked but it's still amazing. The music also often captures the feelings of the Characters really well in specific situations. 

Now to the Story. I already loved the story in the first game but they have gone wild with the Story in this one. I loved watching every single Cutcene and Learning about the lore. It's often really dramatic but also has a lot of jokes, sometimes it can also get really dark and i just love it regardless of what is happening right now, it always has my interest. The Hubworlds also have a bunch of NPC's that have a lot to say so yea, you can learn a lot about the world and their Characters and i love everything about it. 

The Game also has so much optional content that you can really spend lots of hours with completing it and every second of that was amazing for me. 

Now to some of the bad stuff, which isn't much. So the only thing about the Story that bothered me is that it kind of ends with a teaser for more of the story and it took 8 years for this game to come out, so i want to know more about the Story and how it will continue but there i will have to wait a lot of years until anything will be continued. I like the ending but i just want more of the story xD 

The other thing that is bothering me (mostly for the first days that the game was out) is the lack if polish. I encountered a lot of bugs and softlocks and i didn't expected so many bugs after the game was being worked on for so long, but they are fixing it faster than i can look so that isn't a problem anymore. 

So yea, the game is just amazing, amazing AND amazing. I want to thank Sabrina DiDuro and everyone at Galaxytrail for making this masterpiece of a game. I'm incredibly thankful for your hard work, thank you. I can't stop gushing about it, buy it, play it and fall in love with it.

And then imagine it got a sequel, that's even better. You don't have to imagine it.

No but, like, for real, FP2 is on basically every front, just... better Freedom Planet. The characters feel better to control and are a lot more balanced while also feeling much different from each other - Lilac's still my go-to, and generally the easiest, but even Carol and Milla feel really good in their own ways, and Neera... well, she struggles a little, but, she's not unfun to play either since the game's core movement mechanics are just, really good, and she has her moments. My biggest gripe is... her focus ability is just, useless and actively obtrusive to using her other special moves, and tying it to her guard makes it impossible not to use it... it's not great. Oh speaking of which. The guard in this game is SO GOOD. But the game never tutorializes it! It's practically essential to fighting bosses and even platforming through stages at times, but the very extensive tutorial stages all leave it out for no good reason! Use the guard more. It's worth it.

The stages. There are even more of them than before. Blew my mind when I got to what felt like an endgame sequence only to discover I was only halfway done and there was so much more left. Every stage has its own gimmicks, whether they be platforming mechanics, structure, or remixes of previous elements into something new. And they each have so much personality as a result - I feel stages trend ever so slightly shorter than in the first game (for the most part) but all leave their mark even stronger because of it, and just on the basis of how good movement feels in general, they're almost all fun to play.

The bosses, I feel like one thing the game learned was to throw in more ""duel"" type bosses than the first game had, since they tend to be the most interesting and challenging, and, yeah, all of those types of bosses rule, but the giant robots are of solid variety and generally exciting to fight as well, though there are a few exceptions - hello, giant clam of tedium - and I feel like the primary reason bosses overall feel better in this game is simply due to combat as a whole feeling better, but like... it's good stuff.

The story is... so, so much better. Merga is an actually compelling villain with complex motives and actual emotional stakes... like, Brevon is cool as a ""love to hate"" type of villain but... the game has Serpentine for that, if you really want that type of villain, and a whole gang of co-villains backing up Merga for just, all sorts of chaos. Top that off with improved character interactions and better voice acting (Merga's VA in particular just does an incredible job) as well as a story that both does well to flesh out the lore of the world and tell an engaging tale in its own right with an obvious real-world parallel... it's a bit optimistic in its outlook, sure, but I think it works given the style and target demographic of a game like this. Also, no torture scene this time. That's pretty important.

If I do have any criticisms with the story, it's that... Neera's role is questionable. She kinda feels there just to be there. She doesn't drive any portion of the plot, has almost no unique character scenes (besides two alternate scenes with one character where... they ultimately play out the same as other characters' and don't really add a ton). And on the flipside... on the whole, this is clearly Lilac's story, and the others are just along for the ride, which is obvious when you consider who each main characters' foil is - Carol, Milla, and Neera each get co-villain foils while Lilac's is Merga herself, and only she gets some of the most key story scenes that /really/ drive home the emotional stakes. I guess there's nothing that could be done about that, but, it's at least noticeable.

I'm not really a fan of the lives system in this game - it encourages exploration within the levels, I guess, but you're only really gonna do that once, to look for each stages' collectibles, and then after that it's not really worth the effort to gather 250 gems just for an extra stock. The lives in the first game were... meaningless, basically, but I think that was for the better, because lives systems just suck and, considering gems already have their uses outside of gaining lives, it really feels like a mechanic that could've been easily removed without hurting the game in any way. Just, like... limit the # of low-health revivals you're allowed and, boom, lives no longer need to exist.

I also just think the true final stage sucks and... doesn't have any purpose, either, really. The stage is an annoying stealth level, the boss is dramatically less interesting or fun than the normal final boss, and storywise it just serves to throw an extra wrench by way of an uninteresting antagonist character. Plus, the means to unlock it (by doing battlesphere challenges) is... fine, but again feels weirdly mismatched to what that actually unlocks, and, annoyingly, there's no way to view the last four time capsules before beating the game, which kinda makes the scene prefacing the final level come out of nowhere since a good bit of context is missing. I dunno, this entire last arc just feels mishandled.

I do feel the actual difficulty of the time trial times in this game is much easier & achievements on the whole not as hard, but given the amount of extra time it takes just to clear the game (my hasty third and fourth playthroughs both clocked 6.5 hours) I think this was a change for the better, in the end - kept frustration at bay.

Oh, and, presentation-wise, the game looks and sounds gorgeous, but that's like... obvious. Of course it does. It's Freedom Planet.

Obvious I'm not without my nitpicks, but the fact that I played this game for 45 hours and enjoyed the vast majority of them despite going through the story four times speaks to the quality of the game as a whole - there's so much to do, and it's all so good. I barely even touched on the training dojo, the arena battles, the story hubs chock full of NPCs to speak with, the charm and potion systems, the ranking system - which, admittedly, is not super fleshed out or interesting, but whatever, it works.

All the levels make you feel like you're going really fast and doing really cool an unique actions all throughout the levels. The Level variety is incredible so many familiar gimmicks and a lot of new ones as well, and none of them bog down the level. All throughout you're just blazing through the stages even while doing puzzles everything has this seamless and effortless feel to the gameplay. The difficulty is really well done never brutally hard, but in the perfect sweet spot that you'll lose all your lives, but still get a chance to clear the part you're stuck on.

There's four playable characters so lots of replayability as well as time attack and a bunch of side things to do.

Soundtrack is awesome. Story is fine. Characters are fun. VA took a step up. Pixel graphics are cool and varied throughout the whole journey. There is a lot that is improved over the first game. Some changes are subjective, but it is nice that FP1 and 2 are pretty different games compared to each other.

Game is being updated with bug fixes, graphics and new quality of life features as well and I hope that trend keeps on going. Thanks for all the effort put into the game.

From charterer control, adjustments, level design, art and everything else. (But maybe except the story) 

The four different playable characters you play as have their own unique set of powers that vastly different from one another. Depending on who you play as, it may change the way you play the stage and how you interact with foes and bosses along the way. It creates great replay value and experimentation in each play-trough you do. From Lilac ability to speed trough the stage, or Milla's exploration and ranged kit. (My personal favorite is the newcomer, Neera. With her double jump and power moves, you can defeat foes and move around quickly if you know the stage well.)

The stages in this game are wonderful design from art, to level layout. Each level having their own set of gimmicks as well to keep the pacing consistently fresh every time. Whenever it's climbing up an tower needed power throughout or a gauntlet of challenge rooms of tricks. The levels in this game are awesome! This also applies to the hub worlds throughout the game. Each having their own neat details and lore of that part of the world. You can also buy items from these hub worlds to help you out in the main adventure if things get tough.

The story of this game is the only thing I kinda don't like about it. Compared to the first game, it doesn't have the same impact, from story beats, to the characters , it's watered down. It still has it's moments in the middle and all, but most of the time it remains flat and never evolves the new heights. ( If that made sense) Though I do very like the additions of the new side characters and the expanded world building. They are fun, cool to the world, and bounce of the main ones very well. If you want to see more of the same characters you like in the first one, you will probably like the story just okay. 

Overall, if you are looking for a platformer with plenty of  speed and awesome level design, and or liked the first game, this one is for you in my opinion. It has beautiful art design, music that suits the mood of each moment, and plenty of replay value as well. Outside the main game and unique playable characters, there's also a side challenge gauntlet mode that I have not played yet, but will get to.

I beat this game as 1 character Ash Kencorp's panda girl. I thought she looked cute and cool. Little did I know that I picked hardest one to control. It felt really awkward trying to fight enemies with her. Bosses were even harder. Till I turned on auto guard, it helped a lot. It is my personal weak side, I neglect block/parry button  harder then any black dad neglecting his kids or responsibilites. Well as I said auto-guard made it comfortable enough to play till the end. 

 What else. About exploration. To me it felt like game tries  to make opposite saides of a magnet to stay together. All because this game wanted to be Sonic 3 but also wanted for you to explore. And it would work for me if I still was a 10yo kid high on corn syrup. But as I got older I noticed I liked more and more to look at scenery and trying to visit every corner of a stage. Hard to do in game like this, well as Neera it is quite hard.  And that stage near the end where you get teleported here and there via telepot beams and arrows. Hated it.

 Combat. Sucked mostly. Hard to avoid being hit. Had to wait till energy bar refill to throw 1 ice lasso. Extra hard when game wanted be Sonic but also wanted to have more than basic combat system. Felt very awkward wanted to shoot my ice spear, nope not shooting... ah now it is shooting. Wanted to hit an enemy but the tip of my spear decided that hit box will appear just behind a monster. In the end I felt discomfort every time I needed to choose either to ignore and run or stay and fight. But combat moves looks cool. But once again I only played as one character, who wasn't playable in the first game and I didn't play first game. 

 Story. Okay nothing special, didn't make me tingle but was not cringy. Maybe a little cringe, every time I had listen to Carol the green cat I cringed. And that time I had to witness Lilac's ""teen angst"". Neera felt to me edgy and angsty but only very slightly. If I had to desribe the plot I say 90's saturday morning cartoon with 2017 sjw soy sauce on top of it.

 Did i liked the game? Yes. Graphics are good, though i had a bit of a problem with some levels trying to figure out which platform is solid and which is a part of the background. Quite a common problem with indie platformers. Voce acting was good. I know I said Carol sounded cringy but I still liked it and she's cute, I love cat's ears and big eyes. Should you play? Yeah of course.  I'll probably play through it one more time just to feel the diffirence.

Two last thing. Some stages are way to bloody long. Whoever thought designed boss areas that don't zoom out and 80% time you have no idea what boss is doing and instead get bombarded bya barrage of warning signs that are often counter productive and not helping. I wish your vision becomes a boss arena that doesn't zoom out.

UPDATE. Beat the game with Carol. She is more suited for level exploration and boss fights appart from Final boss. I'm very angry at the final boss (Merga not weapon core).

UPDATE Milla fucking sucks.
UPDATE Milla sucks but she's cute. And Lilac is not an instant win easy mode.",1666466503,1669186157,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,True,,,

The characters, backgrounds, and music are all visually stunning and it was great to have the chance to see the creative thought process of the team's character design.

It still has the feel of old 2D sonic but now this game really took what made the first FP so special and cranked its uniqueness all the way.

On the whole it feels more balanced than the previous one, so no more having to stockpile extra lives for an endgame meat grinder. However, there's a lot more boss fights with multiple phases/enemies that can prove frustrating. There's also a new system of held items and potions that can be confusing at first, but useful for boosting your characters or providing different, additional challenges. It's completely optional too, so you can just play how you like.
The soundtrack is as great as ever, sprites are detailed and well animated and backgrounds beautifully rendered, and the voice work is lively (admittedly some of it's pretty cringe but by now that comes with the territory.

Ok now that I’ve got your attention, please enjoy this wonderful game. I was a big fan of the first game and remember back when this one was announced. It’s been 6 years since then. I bought this game the moment it went live on Steam and after all this time I can say it was worth the wait. This game is an improvement on the original in every possible way. I’ve already beaten it twice as 2 different characters and plan to finish the other two stories soon. 

 Pretty much every quality of life aspect has been improved. The gameplay is still simple to learn and fun. Characters have new moves which make the game even more fast paced and fun (Milla can attack while moving and from a distance now!) You can revive if you’re just about to kill a boss but then die. Potions and items can give your character attributes to make the game easier (or harder). Every character feels unique. There’s even sub games! For a cheap indie game you will get more than what you pay for. This game isn’t super short like a lot of indie games tend to be so it is a worthwhile investment that’ll take you more than one sitting to beat (especially if you go for the true ending and beat the game as every character).

Even outside of gameplay this game is wonderful. Every NPC is unique and the art is beautiful which allows the world to feel truly alive. The music is amazing. The story is fun and clears up some questions left unanswered with the first game. The animations are smooth and pretty and you can tell every pixel of this game was crafted with love. 
The only real cons I can think of are that some levels might drag on (ha) a bit too long - some on my first try took me more than a half hour on normal mode. The final boss has 6 (!!) phases and that’s not even including the optional secret true final boss after. I was exhausted by the end of it. The devs really didn’t need to make it 6 entire phases.

It's the best indie game of all time!

This is a game where you control four anthropomorphic animals who have to fight off the robots, criminals, and invaders of Avalice by beating the crap out of them. It's basically a character action game similar in vain to Sonic the Hedgehog and Gunstar Heroes. The game is divided up into levels where players are tasked with fighting off enemies in close off encounters and then players are then ranked at the end of the level based off their performance. How ever unlike most speedrun action games where you play as a blue hedgehog fighting against robots by jumping into them, Freedom Planet 2 task the player to fight robots in combat by using a bunch of unique special moves. Lilac can speed boost and a spin attack, Carol can do claw attacks and rides a motorcycle, Milla can create cubes and use a shield burst, and Neera uses a spear and make some ice attacks. Unlike the first game where it's just a speed platformer, the sequel itself have put into more into that, like hub worlds, shops, and even battlesphere challenges. Not only that, but this game also added in some collectibles and secrets where you can find in the game like brave stones, power ups, music vinyls, and tons of other items which I don't want to spoil. The game takes the speed combat pushes it to it's absolute limits and creates some of the most unique gameplay mechanics to a video game I've ever seen, and while I can't spoil everything about this game in order to entice everyone to play it, it's best just to discover all of this stuff while you're playing the game yourself. I mean it's one thing to watch a let's play of Freedom Planet 2, but it's a completely different experience while you're controlling the game in motion. Now let's not to say that the gameplay is the only great thing about this game because the story and the cutscenes are really amazing. Even if you're playing the game on the lowest difficulty setting and fumbling your way through the combat system, you'll still be able to enjoy the colorful cast of characters and all the crazy set pieces. The entire game is heavily inspired by Dragon Ball Z and Sonic Adventure, it's like this crazy saturday morning cartoon where the stakes constantly scale up to borderline ridiculous scenarios. The boss fights are these mecha animal creatures where you need to fight a week point to fight off the boss itself, and the game just constantly one-ups itself until it escalates into one of the most over-the-top mind-blowing hype as hell endings to a video game I've ever seen. And you're just sitting there watching the end credits feeling incredibly happy, and exhausted like getting screwed. Still for the majority of players who will most likely put the game down once they've reached to the end credits, it's still a completely fantastic game that anyone can enjoy, and I highly recommend it to everyone. It's one of the greatest indie games I have ever played! In conclusion, Freedom Planet 2 was the best indie game on Steam, it's easily the best game of the year, and possibly most likely the greatest game ever made of all time!",1665936387,1665936387,True,6,0,0.525606453418731689,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Even just dashing around in the tutorial level is a lot of fun since the controls are so spot on! While it would have been nice with a native Linux build, the game runs great in Proton Experimental.

The only issue I had was the frame rate of the final stages. I play using an iGPU on a rather old machine (Ivy Bridge, fourth generation i5). The game ran perfectly up until the final stages where it dropped to just a couple of frames per second. Changing the graphics form 1080p to 360p for these parts brought the frame rate back to more-than-playable levels. This probably had something to do with the combination of my old GPU and Proton, but it might be worth keeping in mind if you use an older machine as well.

I found everything about this game to be top-notch. The gameplay, the artwork, the music, and the way the story brings everything together.

  来说说这个游戏的游玩感想吧，和1代一样在ost真的很棒，这些音乐，真的很带感很带感，极力推荐这种音乐用在跑酷游戏中。你可能觉得2代音乐没1代有压迫感，因为2代打的也不是1代那种绝对的大恶人，也是很有代入感的BGM。
音乐：9/10分
  剧情上虽然没有1代那种绝望那种对付真正的坏人BOSS了，因为2代对付的BOSS并非全是坏人，甚至最终BOSS也不是坏人  ，剧情比1代稍微复杂些，4个角色可供使用，对话以及cg比1代更丰富多样，如果是有汉化就好了，可以让CN玩家更能快速融入游戏的魅力（剧情故事情感）中。当然这个不排除制作组没钱了，请翻译还是很难的........
剧情：8/10分
  新的设定，增加了自由一点儿的机制，例如你可以随意自主选择去任何地图场景，在解锁前，甚至可以提前准备好打下一关的药物，1代没有这个设定，只有1关1关闯那样按着顺序，就像小时候玩的街机游戏那样只能一条固定的路走，休息点还是挺多的，这也是村庄那种歇息机制以及整备。
玩法：8/10分
  流程跟1代相比，2代也就稍微长了，也不是长很多，增加了很多路人NPC，这些NPC也不是那种随随便便设计出来的外貌，都是特好看的动物们，也是都有名字的，至少这方面上是很用心也挺辛苦的，NPC如果做的都一个样的话那也很省力，这一代NPC都是独立的样子并非应付的做，玩一下就知道了。
流程和新元素：9/10分
好像也没什么了，还有的就是画风上，和1代不一样的是，2代画师是钛山，他的作品机械化非常棒，是我喜欢的类型，画师的画风真的敲可爱，以及角色可以在各种场景里摆pose照相（截图）的娱乐设计，[spoiler]还有在博物馆解锁所有的BOSS组件可以进入角色设计长廊房间（gallery's door），稍微肝一下就好，进去后里面有各种NPC的名字也会介绍，还有没用上的设定以及模型（看样子应该是）[/spoiler]

It just that it's not as good as the first one.

For the rest of its, the enemies in this game are less memorable than the first one and the level design is still as chaotic as ever.

There is to me, only 2 or 3 real good level in the whole game and after all of the others level, you will get through it with the exact same tactics.

Just dashing forward and upward and going as fast as you can. I even have the feeling sometime to cheat over it but no, it's how the game ask you to play.

So 90% of the level, you will dash everywhere and skip the level design and platform part to just be focus to land somewhere safe, then guessing where you must go, and then dashing there and you repeat the same process all over again.

This is too repetitive and only few level of the game actually force you to not play that way, and guess what ? They are actually the best levels of the whole game !

The bosses overall are fun but mostly too easy or sometime too confuse on what to do but overall, it's the best part of the game.

I can't say I didn't enjoyed it, but I felt a let down playing it and I think the game is way way overhyped and over estimate.
It truly doesn't deserve the ""extremenly positive"" review.

FANTASTIC!!  Most games have a very, very difficult time being on par with their predecessor. NOT FP2! This game smashes almost all expectations! Let's go through it --
STORY - 12/10  Holy Sh... Hoooollyyyy HellsBells! They HAMMERED this one out of the park! Lilac's story? Daaaammnnn. Absolutely stunningly done. And when you unlock her secret level? Thats where the bonus marks come in. You Will NOT Regret It!  ALL FOUR Stories, while much more related to each other than FP1, Do a fantastic job expanding on each character; Poor Neela has a hell of a hard go but at the end earns her place.  Each of the four Story arcs had me stunned.
Graphics - 10/10  They pulled off stuff with the medium that no way in hell even a Saturn could do. The love and lavish they poured into this is very clear. Perfection!
Audio - 8.5/10 For the most part, the music is glorious.  Sound effects are clear, VA is Dead On. Level tracks are GORGEOUS!  My only real complaint is the boss battle tracks - some are remixes, but most with maybe two exceptions - thankfully the final bosses - tend to fall rather flat, IMHO. The boss battle tracks could of hit harder; but thats subjective. The explosions also need a bass boost, but again, extremely minor.
Gameplay - 8.5/10 NOW THAT IVE DONE ALL FOUR ARCS - Lilac's combat capabilities are only slightly improved over the original. At times, it doesnt feel improved at all. I even went and did a boss rush back to back vs FP1, and while her charge attack DOES charge faster, it still feels damn slow, especially for someone thats supposed to be fast. If you are a dedicated old school Rocket Knight Adventures fan, Lilac is still going to be frustrating to play, but a bit of a slight improvement from FP1.   Carol's attack, once you master it? MUCH better than it initially seems. A step up.  Milla? Holy shit she got buffed!  Neela? She IS the hardest to get the hang of, but once you do, she's a solid fighter; and im pretty sure they buffed her guarding. Im certain it wasnt working in the previous patch; now it works just as well as the rest of the crew.
ALL IN ALL? ABSOLUTELY WORTH EVERY PENNY.  Quite frankly My complaints are more subjective, most certainly not game breaking.  Most people wont notice the issues with Lilac, and all the gals gameplay is master-able. Hopefully, after the team rests for a bit, they go for a Trilogy.  They did drop the hints that a trilogy is on the table. GO FOR IT GALAXY QUEST! This game is worth DOUBLE what they are charging for it! Im dead serious; I virtually never say something like this, but this time? They absolutely EARNED it. 

BRAVO! This game is a MASTERPIECE!  Not only is it a Masterpiece? IT absolutely SHATTERS all expectations.",1665301032,1666508493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Stages are faster and more varied. Characters are more refined and a new character that's fun and fits the gameplay well. Combat is smoother, with a new guard ability adding more depth at the same time. A lovely artstyle overhaul, and the music is honestly even better than the already great OST of FP1.

The story is much better. Merga is a more interesting and deep villain than Brevon, and has reasons for her actions instead of just a crashed ship (even if misplaced). The writing is more mature and the tone is more consistent than FP1. Humor is aplenty and personally lands much better.

Replayability is extremely high. Each Character is different enough from each other to feel fun in their own ways. Stages now have rankings, encouraging you to play fast and play well. There are hubs where you can soak in lore and details of the world of Avalice. You can buy items in these hubs to customize your gameplay experience (like starting with a certain barrier, or a potion that fine-tunes your character), or make it harder with brave stones for a better rank and more crystals (or masochism).

I've beaten FP1 many times and has always been a great experience. I see myself beating FP2 much, much more. And I will love every second of it.

Freedom Planet 2 is the best game I've played this year and I could easily give it a 10/10

Could end the review with that, but if you're thinking I'm joking or something or you're not convinced, well sit down, relax and let me explain why this game is so important to me:

INTRODUCTION:
Let's start with this: there is just no compareson with the first Freedom Planet, yes it's still a good game, but the sequel just overshadowed it completly in every feature. I need to remind you that the firts game was after all a solid Sonic fan game that gained his own identity and you can't deny that. This formula of taking inspirations from bigger franchises or creating spiritual sucsessors of our favourite games when the original creators are not willing to, as been used now more than ever to preserve good game design and artistic freedom and (when done well) can create true masterpieces and fix the hissues of the original proprietys.
What FP2 did was cleaning up the dust from it's firts game and rebuild a totally new and original experience, detatching itself from the Sonic series wile still mantaining what made the game so good in the first place and did so much more.

GAMEPLAY:
The gameplay is fast, clean and fun! Every stage has it's own mechanics and all the 4 playable characters can provide new game experiences and the replay value is at his core!
First thing they did was cleaning up the annoying parts of the firts game. The movement for Lilac for example feels much more fun, now the spin attack does not cost power so you can use it in combo with the charge attack and the collectibles are no longer like... 10 per level?! But just 1 or 2, because the devs understand that in a game where you need to go fast, the SLOW exploration can feel lame at some point. But don't get me wrong you still have a lot to collect in other fun ways.
The first game was linear, a simple experience, this game have an overworld map, towns, NPCs, minigames, challenge modes and FINALLY a ranching sistem so you can have fun getting rank S for every stage in game. There are also items to equip, but I rarely use them cuz they take a way a bit of the final reward, but you can equip an hourglass to race against time and hearn extra cash for finishing the level before the timer runs out, super fun to play.

STORY:
Will be short to avoid spoilers, the first game got an average story that tryed to get cool at the end, but was nothing more than... the power of friendship against evil alien dude, that was good for a game like that, but the sequel got REAL!!
You got world bulding, drama, relationships, betrayal, fun shenes, very sad shenes and jsut something that will make you feel so fulfilled at the end of it, plus a secret ending if you can get it (it's worth it).

ART:
Yeah the art in the first game was good, but a bit silly and I wasn't really convinced about any character that wasn't Lilac or Carol and yeah was still too similar to Sonic...
This game owever changed the art completly and it's one of the amin reason why it feels so original. Every character EVEN THE NPC are fully animated and every stage filled with detail. Really nailed it this tme!

MUSIC:
The music is just great, not much to say about it, not an expert in music, but it fit the stages very well soooo yeah!

DUBBING:
Now the cherry on the top, the first game was already dubbed and that was impressive for an indie game like that, but with this? GOD! It is so well done! Every characters they played at was perfectly delivered expecially Lilac, Merga and Cordelia.
I can say in some shenes I was at the edge of crying for that and you guys get all my respect for it.

IN CONCLUSION:
FP2 is how you make a good sequel, and I mean sequel! Not like we call it XXXXX 2 and then is a prequel or some kind of AU or whatever, I mean sequel sequel and all game devs big and small should take example. Can't wait for FP3, IF there's gonna be one (I hope so).

wait... I should add some cons as well or people will think I'm just being a fanboy... OK

CONS:

It took 8 years to develop, and it shows.

FP2 is a speedy platformer with diverging paths and lots to explore. It draws heavily on influence from both Sonic and Megaman in pretty much all aspects. Combat is snappy--you never spend too long on a single enemy in the field--with just a pinch of depth that makes conquering boss fights feel rewarding. The stages are beautiful, with powerups and secrets to find. Difficulty in this game is easily modulated with helpful and hurtful items, so you can find that perfect balance of a playthrough or mess with fun, wacky combinations.

The story itself is pretty middle of the road, which is fine. FP2, like it's predecessor, is dedicated to easy-breezy saturday morning cartoon vibes, and the story beats fit perfectly in line with that. The tone gives way for some moments of drama and tension which I personally appreciated.

Like with FP1, the thing this game excels the most with is its visual story telling. There's a ton of dialogue to be had in FP2, but I found myself most engaged in the story and stakes in many of the later stages where GalaxyTrails' spark for visuals comes to life. There is a lot of care poured into each stage that tells its own story, so much that playing in classic mode with barebones story still contains the same sense of motion and tension.

Levels are very funny to play, much better designed, and each one of them has some unique quirk to it, most of the bosses are memorable, music - absolutely gorgeous, although I miss the two-level stages with music variations from the first game a bit. New art style is also a definite winner!

Lilac is not the easiest to play character anymore, Carol and Milla in this game are totally bonkers - especially Milla, who easily decimates some of the bosses you can have problems with another characters. Neera is a bit boring though, she also doesn't have much of unique story elements other characters have. The story itself is a bit more lighthearted compared to the first game.

I really recommend it, and it was a fun time for at least 75% of my playtime.
Some pros and cons:

PROS:
- Amazing OST filled with catchy and groovy songs. It might not be as consistently strong as the first game's but it's nearly there. Ancestral Forge's BGM is incredible.
- Lilac, Carol and Milla play better than in the previous game, especially Carol (she's actually fun now).
- A LOT of very different levels, each with its unique gimmick.
- The story is definitely better in many regards. The true ending was pretty satisfying. Overall the story feels less like a saturday morning cartoon and more serious (except for the whole Battlesphere arc).
- I'm on the minority here but I greatly prefer this game's villain compared to the previous. On a regular playthrough you might miss why she's interesting, but getting the required items for the true end gives you a lot of backstory on her.


CONS:
- The endgame takes a nosedive in quality and the challenge feels really cheap in a few levels, especially with the gimmick of the final proper level (Lunar Cannon) and the extra level (Weapon's Core). Both the final and extra bosses have way too many forms (well, in the case of the extra boss, you have to get it's health under 50% at least twice before you actually get a chance to beat it.) The devs definitely didn't have any restraint here, for the worse.
- Playing as Neera is a miserable time, both if you want to go fast or battle. She has some strong moves, except that they're so hard to hit fast targets with that it balances out, but her speed is flat out horrible compared to all other characters.
- I feel the difficulty of the bosses is programmed around the ability to shield\dodge\parry attacks, but this mechanic is very hard to master, and sometimes feels like it doesn't mesh with the rest of the game.
- The time capsules really shouldn't have been rewards for the Battlesphere challenges. It doesn't compute why they're there instead of scattered throughout Parusa or even the whole game.


While I had more to say about the negatives, I'd say this game is extremely good overall and still recommend it. I just hope my criticisms are taken to heart by the devs. I wouldn't mind seeing balance patches to iron out the issues with the final levels and bosses and maybe even buffing Neera to be on par with the rest of the girls.",1665093358,1665093358,True,2,0,0.503659665584564209,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Añaden muchísimas más cosas, ya no es una sucesión de niveles que al superar uno vas directamente al siguiente, te ofrece mayor libertad con un hubworld que se expande a medida que avanzas por los niveles. Han introducido la posibilidad de equipar items a tu personaje para darle ventajas. Los jefes son bastante retantes. De momento estoy jugando con Lilac y supongo que la historia variará dependiendo del personaje que seleccione como ocurría con el primer Freedom Planet.

I loved freedom planet 1, and I beat it on the hardest difficulty on every character simply because it was really fun, and I have always enjoyed a good platforming challenge. The OST was incredible and the story even pulled me in a little bit (I was interested in the larger world they lived in.) However, it did have some frustrating moments, and I never did find every star card. But I did always remember my time in the game fondly.
After freedom planet 2 was announced, I was excited. And that excitement was burning for years, as I figured the development might take a while. But after the demo drop, I became discouraged as months of waiting became a year. And another. And another...I began to lose hope, to worry the project was secretly abandoned and nobody wanted to say anything, as other games released (Petal Crash in particular) in the interim. It got to the point where I just...stopped checking.
Last month, my passion reignited with a burning vengeance as I found out that not only had development continued, IT RELEASED! I was beyond ecstatic, but I had to wait for the funds to get the game. I thought 25 was a hefty price tag, but I was willing to give it a shot. I set aside a weekend, got the game, and I dived in.
I was blown away. The story, the world, the new controls, the characters, the sprite work, the levels, the OST, everything hit me like a truck. I started my play on the hard setting, and I was blown away by how even that worked, and the menus assist settings to help newer platformer players get into it! (I love settings that help new players enjoy the genre, as I enjoy seeing new players succeed and get better!)
I'm going to be honest, I have never had a game make me feel like a kid again before, and I don't know if I ever will, but this is a thank you to the devs for allowing me to relive those kid-like feelings of wonder and amazement, and even accomplishment at achieving victory. Even the final boss theme hit me different. It made the fight intense and sad at the same time, gave me the feeling of ""this is IT, all or nothing"" as I fought my hardest, using every trick I'd been taught to win.
A satisfying ending to a seven year wait, this most definitely was.

My list of Pros:
-Difficulty customization is unique, and I think it's a great addition to the game. You can choose the way you want to S rank a level if that's your goal, or you can choose the best items to achieve your victory, or even to help you beat a level faster than ever before.
-Level Designs are great. I never really felt like I had to slow down too much in a level. There were a couple puzzle segments that upset me a bit, but since I'm biased against most puzzles, I will abstain from judging that as a negative.
-Boss Designs are incredible. All of the bosses felt unique to fight, and all had their own patterns of movement and attack, No boss really felt too frustrating for me, save one, It's mostly because the boss is frequently off-screen and that makes it hard to tell where the boss is. I had to use particles to guess the buss location and hope I aimed right. If the camera in that fight zoomed out a little bit to accommodate the boss's size, I think that would easily fix my negative view of that particular fight.
-Lots of levels! There are an incredible number of stages, and thus content, in the game. I have put in about 20 hours on Lilac's story alone, and there are four versions, one for each character and their particular journey in the world.
-The Sprites are very fun! I enjoyed the large variety of characters and sprites, and if I recall correctly, almost all were unique sprites, giving each character their own life and appearance! In addition, the stages are GORGEOUS. they look incredible, and the backgrounds are no different. Everything just feels and looks so good, I was never bored by the appearance of a level!
-The story is good. They actually explain a lot more of the world's lore, and dive into the history of their planet. I had been curious about this since the first game, and I finally got some of what I wanted. Excellent execution and very good characters (especially the voice acting improvement! Great job!) help make the world come to life.
-The OST is bangin'. I love almost all the music in this game, there was never a time where I wanted to mute the music. Sometimes I boot the game just to play some of the OST collectibles in the jukebox because they are so good. A certain boss theme really does it for me and hits me in the emotions.

The Cons
-There are still some bugs in the game. I've been thrown out of the level in a few maps and either got soft locked or just...arbitrarily cleared the stage by hitting some unseen flag. I'm unsure if this is an intentional ""recovery"" feature (no matter how good your programming and testing might be, someone is still gonna find somewhere to break your game! Hello, speedrunning community!) but it was a tad confusing/frustrating when it happened.
-Some hitboxes are not obvious that they are hitboxes until you've died a few times to it. One particular attack that got on my nerves with this was an attack with a dagger that had shockwave clouds around it. Little did I know, not only did the line the dagger traveled hit you, but the cloud shockwaves would hit you too! (cost me my rainbow s rank a couple times and believe me, I was heated)
-Some spawn checkpoints are a tad far, from bosses enough to be annoying, but not enough to constitute a game design sin. As someone who likes to go fast when I get good at something, having that delay every time I go to fight them was definitely something I found zero fun in.
-some items are able to be selected even though they do nothing for you in that stage. I think the items should have a clear warning if you can't use them in the stage, or be locked. (Final stage Timer Badge is one I can think of immediately)

TL'DR
Game's really good, got a couple minor gripes but nothing too major, definitely worth your time for players of all skill levels. And I think the overall quality justifies your money expenditure, as well.

Now this is merely my personal opinion, so anyone can disagree with me as they wish, but i personally think the first fight with Serpentine Phase 2 is not balanced properly, first off, his double slash attack you can not block it completely impossible you ALWAYS get hit on the follow up attack 100% of the time, 2 his projectiles he spams during phase 2, i honestly can't count how many times ive been fully in the clear where the projectiles do not reach you, and i still get clipped even when the space between the projectile and my character is half the width of my finger.

Now onto Final Boss Merga, oh boy this one is a doozy and probably the biggest grievance.

To put it lightly, she is completely BS and unfair, especially with her Final phase after you take out all her moon forms her attacks are far too fast, Far too frequent, every projectile she does has multiple hit frames so guarding isn't even useful, you literally have to run away avoid her like a plague, and using anything you have that can deal damage and give you an iframe in the process. 

Her fight literally forces you to play like a complete coward, which is a complete contrast too the first game, the first game you actually have to engage with the boss, rather than disengage with the boss.

A boss that forces cowardly play to have a chance, is a poorly designed boss, and that sums up my opinions with Merga, she needs to be reworked entirely she is not an enjoyable fight, not because she actually hard, shes not fun because she was intentionally designed to enforce Cowardice during the fight, that is not how you want you final big bad to be remembered as.

And this is why i would rather fight Brevon in the first game on highest difficulty despite the fact he basically 1 shot kills you with multiple attacks, but he has a rhythm too his fight and if i died it was because i didn't time my attacks or iframes correctly and died as a result.

With Merga you can have perfect timing for all of your dodges but you ALWAYS take damage.

Is the game entirely combat-focused ? The answer is: No.

This is definitely one of those games where fast running stays important, just like in the original Freedom Planet.

Nevertheless, it is NOT a hard game to beat imo, well, merga maybe a little bit yes, the first times. 

Only thing that changed is there is indeed a lot of combat at the end of the game. This may be different from freedom planet 1, and certain parts of sonic games that people are used to.

The replayability is definitely high, and you will have some very fond memories of your entire journey you made once you're finished.

O fator dificuldade em relação ao FP1 quintuplicou, e isso não é uma coisa ruim, é ótimo ter um desafio! Jogo extremamente divertido, personagens com play style diferentes, e aqui temos além da Lilac, Carol e Milla, Neera, e todas são extremamente divertidas de se jogar com o clássico slogan ""fácil de aprender, difícil de masterizar"", uma excelente mecânica inserida foi o botão de ""guard"", que se você pegar o timming certo do ataque, e é possível dar um ""parry"" evitando dano (na minha opinião é algo extremamente satisfatório kkkk) a Lilac tem basicamente os mesmos ataque de antes, mas ela pode cancelar o dragon boost no meio e criar uma estrela de energia, além disso ela tem o blink dash junto do ""guard"", a Carol tem quase os mesmos ataques e graças a Deus melhoraram o especial dela, que ao invés de ser o chatíssimo wild kick agora é um disco que ela joga e se joga junto dele se segurar o especial apertado (muito melhor), Carol sendo a mais forte nos combos agora é muito mais divertida de se jogar do que no primeiro, a Milla teve grandes mudaças e a playstyle dela pode ser bem rápido e não pecisa ser tão lento como no primeiro, Milla ja era legal agora melhorou ainda mais, a Neera entre as 4 tem a gameplay mais lenta de todas, não sou grande fã do playstyle da Neera já que a movimentação dela é meio precária, mas ela tem foco em saber administrar timming, combos e improvisar na hora certa. Infelizmente as vidas agora não fazem nenhum sentido, você naturalmente começa com 2 e vão sendo acumuladas só para a fase que está jogando.

Bugs? pisca que chega um novo patch corrigindo-os.Nota: 10/10História: A história se passa 3 anos depois do FP1, e é muito melhor do que a do primeiro. Eles pegaram e consertaram muitas das partes que tinha furos e colocaram uma baita lore top no FP2 e mais a própria história do jogo com acontecimentos, revelações, personagens novos e antigos aparecendo, uma história realmente emocionante e mais complexa, ficou impecável... Bom quase, tem uma parte do jogo que a história fica péssima e perde total sentido, mas se não fosse por isso daria 10, se quiser saber qual parte, um spoiler aí ---> [spoiler] é o final verdadeiro, não faz sentido nenhum [/spoiler] fico com dó mas...Nota: 8/10Trilha sonora: AAA Woofle (principal produtora das músicas) não decepciona, pega a qualidade da do primeiro e multiplica por 2, é cada bomba de OST com várias referências ao FP1 são muito cativante, harmônicas e ambientadas que trazem alma pra cada parte, seja estágio, luta, conquista, personagem, cutscene, é bão aaaaaa é bão de mais!Nota:10/10Personagens: HA! Personagens? Mais uma vez FP traz os antigos personagens com aquele carisma que só quem jogou o primeiro sabe, personagens únicos e memoráveis, muito mais do que apenas ""furries"" todos tem seus próprios objetivos, motivos, desejos, ambições e moralidade. O triozinho da alegria (Lilac, Milla e Carol) com aquela energia contagiante que anima qualquer um! Os antigos personagens são ótimos, uns mudaram, outros nem tanto. A maioria dos novos personagens são muito bem escritos, inseridos no contexto certo e alguns bem memoráveis, a Corazon (ou Cory pros chegados) é uma ótima personagem por exemplo (acho legal ela não surgiu só pra encher linguiça na história, já que teria uma citação no FP1 mas infelizmente não teve). mini spoiler: [spoiler] Senti um pouco da falta do Torque, ele é um bom personagem [/spoiler].Nota: 9999 goldNota final: 10/10 (foi mal mas é a verdade, bglh é bão mesmo)Vale a pena comprar sem promoção? Sim, vale e muito.FP2 pra mim foi um sonho realizado!

It's a pure joy to play, evolving the gameplay and stepping up the level design present in its action platforming inspirations, like Sonic, and continues taking only the best parts from FP1. It's fresh, fast and fun!

The graphics are more detailed and prettier than FP1, and are impressive in motion with how well-animated every single one is. The sound and music quality is AAA.
Overworld map design is SMB3-like and therefore great. It's great how city hubs were implemented, and the NPCs therin were all funny, witty or both.
Story mission being available in almost any order does wonders for replayability, and was a genius addition. Story pacing, along with tonal consistency, was an improvemnt over FP1, and the optional lore collectibles were a nice side quest.
The difficulty curve is very finely tuned in the second half. The bosses stage bosses becoming cuphead-levels of hard near the end made me very nostalgic for the first game.

(Don't know if the devs've said for how long these updates currently being released twice a week will continue for. But I hope they eventually include fixes for some some nit-picky details like:[list]
[*]adding running/talking and attacking/talking sprites for the cutscenes,
[*]multiple character portraits for the file select like in FP1,
[*]handlebars often getting misaligned visually to the characters when lifted up and down...[/list]
Remains to be seen, but at this pace they'll surely be done polishing this up before the summer 2023 console ports.)

За это время интерес успевал и угасать, так и заново загораться. Мне даже было пофиг первую неделю после её релиза, но стоило запустить на выходных и понеслась. 

Первое что бросается в глаза – это новые дизайны наших трех персонажей. После событий первой игры прошло три года, наши героини подросли и повзрослели, особенно выделяется Милла – из плаксы она стала самостоятельной супергероиней). Tyson Tan очень постарался, теперь главных героинь можно с уверенностью называть вайфу. В основной ростер присоединилась Ниира Ли, четвертый играбельный персонаж, новый редизайн пошел больше всего ей на пользу.

По сюжету нашим девочкам будет противостоять новая злодейка водяная дракониха Мерга с личными мотивами - [spoiler] отомстить земляным драконам за истребление её вида и потерю близкого человека [/spoiler]. Концовка на выбранном персонаже зависит от всех собранных капсул времени, в которых можно узнать побольше о прошлом нашей злодейки, их 13. Видно заметный рост, от военного диктатора до мстительницы с плазма-резаком. Был приятно удивлен, что вернется часть старых злодеев. Сюжетные повороты бывают очень предсказуемые, но это не портит игру, а под конец я начал ловить вайбы сониковских сюжеток. В зависимости от выбранной героини, будут встречаться уникальные ролики, больше всего разнообразия получила Кэрол - [spoiler] в середине игры она отделяется от нашей группы [/spoiler]. Эх, а вот какой-нибудь Спэйд и Принц Дэйл(который, теперь в этой части король) стали максимально вторичными персонажами и учавствуют мало в сюжете, даже мелкий мэр Зао имеет больше экранного времени, хотя более комедийный. А ведь когда-то Спэйд планировался играбельным персонажем… да и его редизайн выглядит неудачно – белая панда в белых штанах, это что, сатира…

Геймплейно игра выросла, девочки получили новые фишки для себя, у каждой на отдельную кнопку появилось парирование атак, оно активно используется в игровом процессе на каждой героине.

Лайлак – наша дракониха научилась делать апперкот в воздухе, а циклон теперь не требует полоску и можно спокойно после него делать буст в любом направлении. Изначально казалось, что её понерфили – дамажил по старинке “всасываясь бустом” в босса и урон был небольшой. С мной сыграло злую шутку обучение, ведь в нем не была показана новая фишка и мой первый ран был без нее. Новая отмена буста позволяет сэкономить полоску и раздамажить сильнее босса, оставляя в нем заряд-звездочку. Имеет дополнительный дэш на кнопку парирования.

Кэрол – котейка освоила новые приемчики, такие как вертухан с коротким подлетом (можно совершать два подряд, где второй будет еще короче) и комбинацию с ногами заменили на метательный диск в любом направлении. Второй очень удобный для перемещения, так и для нападения – на место брошенного диска можно спиндешуться как Соник – эффект схож с бустом Лайлак. Если найти мотоцикл на уровне, больше он не потеряется от получения урона – его можно удобно складывать и раскладывать, сочетая диск и кнопку парирования. С мотоциклом можно развивать скорость выше чем у Лайлак и атаковать когтями.

Милла – собакин получила самую глобальную переделку. Она осталось медленным персонажем, но это не мешает ей с новой системой дальнего боя. Освоила рукопашный бой и свои зеленые желехи, причем движения похожи на танцы Чун-ли из стрит файтера. Научилась стрелять в любом направлении, а полет на ушах стал умилительным зрелищем. Щиток отбивающий вражеские снаряды остался и применим теперь в воздухе. Создается большой кубик теперь на кнопку парирования – используется по старинке для усиленного выстрела или для обычных, на уровне можно найти усилок сразу с тремя кубами. Какие-же у неё красивые и смешные анимации, все сделано с душой.

Ниира Ли – суровая панда-брюнетка) Новый персонаж показалась самой сложной, из-за ее медленных атак и бафа на урон. Желательно Баф применять, когда босс открыт для атак, а активируется он на кнопку парирования если полная шкала. Спешл запускает диск, который заморозит врага – можно использовать как платформу, но на гигантских противниках эффекта заморозки не будет, некоторые боссы ей подвержены, но это сможет сработать во вред, например, в спарринге против генерала Гонга. Полоска копится медленней, чем у остальных персов, для пополнения нужно использовать верхнюю атаку. У Нииры есть выстрелы с копья (стоя и сидя), медленная атака с замахом вниз и оба приема ускоряются под бафом, что тоже нужно учитывать. В наличии двойной прыжок и при активации бафа полоска тоже начинает тратиться, на верхний и нижний прием тоже есть два спешала, которые тратят ману. Нижний разбрасывает “Мины”, на которые можно запрыгнуть и сочетается с двойным прыжком, а верхний пускает волну. Ну и дополнительные атаки с меделенным дэшем в воздухе есть, против летающих роботов. Панда требует знаний игры и начинать на ней будет сложно, не видитесь на её красивый дизайн) Но, если её освоить, она способна выдавать самый высокий урон, проблема в том, что Лайлак гораздо легче с её отменой буста в звездочку.

За прохождение уровней теперь начисляется ранг от С до S. В получении рангов или упрощении игры может помочь новая система модификаторов. Можно ставить до двух, на упрощение или усложнение, за второе дают больше кристаллов. Теперь камешки есть куда потратить, на возрождение у чекпоинта при потери всех жизней или на обмен золотых кристаллов. Они нужны в магазинах, можно покупать упрощалки или снадобья. Вторым можно немного улучшить персонажа и тоже упростить себе игру: поднять урон, увеличить дальность прыжка и т. д. Предметы на усложнение также нужно искать на самих уровнях.

Сиквел стал глобальнее оригинала, уровней и боссов больше. Уникальных лвлов как в прошлой части для персонажей тут нет, но и без этого контента хватает. Есть колизей с испытаниями и возможностью рефайта с боссами, даже пару уникальных для арены завезли. Реиграбельность за счет уникальных роликов и геймплея на 4 персонажах высокая, всех подогнали под уровни, нет таких проблем как в оригинале, что все сделано под Лайлак. Есть схожие элементы с sonic advance 2, такие как рельсы и ускоряющие кольца. OST стал более сдержанным, но местами попадаются шикарные треки, например на последних уровнях в космосе. Уровней разраб наклепал от души, мои любимый Inversion Dynamo.

Продолжение оказалось таким же качественным как и оригинал, даже выше. Личность, отвечающая за обе игры очень экстравагантная (и походу очень любит птиц, судя по количеству боссов) , поэтому играя в продолжение чувствуется глоток свежего воздуха и новый “сониковский” экспиренс.",1664792104,1683137364,True,10,0,0.562026321887969971,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Во-первых, матерь божья, обнимаю TysonTan-a и других художников за такой обалденный пиксельный дизайн. Не понимаю, почему на странице в Steam-e показывают какие-то рандомные углы, едва-ли отражающие те красоты которые игрок встретит на хабах и уровнях. Нет, я не прошу выкладывать спойлерные моменты, но покажите незнакомым игрокам чуть больше разнообразия, чем первые три уровня. А-то складывается ощущение, что это очередной GreenHill.

Во-вторых, боёвка стала динамичнее и легче. Появился блок, железная воля, дополнительные сильные атаки, эффекты от зелий и предметы с уникальными способностями. С таким набором и возможностью выбрать сложность, я не понимаю, как кто-то может жаловаться на то, что он не может пройти игру. (исключая баги, о которых все писали в первые дни выхода игры)

Боссов в игре много, и не все из них являются шариками, теперь в ассортименте есть детализированные призмы. :D 
Много паттернов атак перекочевало из первой части, и не скажу, что в новых я заметил сильное разнообразие, но и на том спасибо, инноваций я не требую.

С музыкой не всё-так однозначно. Первая часть серии пестрила яркими композициями под совершенно разные антуражи. Эти треки мне запомнились за счёт интересных последовательностей нот которые я могу расслышать ЧЁТКО. Нет, я не говорю, что половина треков в игре являются кашей, но в плейлист я себе такое не добавлю. Как на зло, лучшие треки чаще всего слышны на мировой карте и хабах.

Четвёртый момент с сюжетом и конфликтом. Как так вышло, что подручному злодея первой части серии прописали мотивацию и харизму лучше, чем главному злодею во второй? Диалоги в целом, стали по приятнее, и персонажи перестали постоянно вопить о всякой рандомной бытовой херне. Спасибо и за то, что на этот раз без вступительного урока по [i]минералогии[/i].

なんですけど、ボス戦だけは少し辛かったです。

[h1]ハイスピードアクションが色々強化[/h1]
絵が前作と比較にならないくらい綺麗です。フルHDで表示させてもドットサイズが等倍で画面が崩れません。4人の操作キャラクターはモーションが滑らかでしかも撮影機能付き。好きなだけドット絵を鑑賞できます。
ステージは長すぎず短すぎずちょうどいい感じ。「気合が入ったステージは最初の方だけ」なんてことはなく、最後までみっちり詰め込まれています。走るルートは1周では把握しきれないくらい分岐が多数。ステージに隠されたアイテムを探すために色々なルートを試したりショートカットできたりで探索の甲斐があります。初見でも大体道なりに沿って進めばゴールに辿り着けますし、ステージに特色ある仕掛けが満載で画面の移り変わりを見るだけでも楽しめます。
画面外からの攻撃は警告表示で位置を知らせてくれることや、頻繁に自動チェックポイントが入ってくれること、各種アシスト設定が可能で走りやすさにも気を使われています。

成長した主人公たちの姿はより凛々しく可愛くなりました。相変わらずスタンピーくんを大事にしているMillaとか見ると心が温かくなります。マップ制になって街を散策できるのですが、住人の種類が多くておっきいのもちっさいのももうみんな癒されます。
敵味方が入り乱れる怒涛のストーリーも目が離せません。ステージクリアするたびにフルボイスでキャラクターの掛け合いがあるのも前作通り。あとは台詞の自動送りが任意で選べればよかったです。

[h1]ボスに慣れるまでは辛め[/h1]
進めるうえでネックになったのがボス戦でした。図体は大きいのにやたらと当たり判定が小さく、しかも空中を高速で移動しまくります。ひたすらジャンプしてなんとか攻撃をヒットさせるの繰り返しで時間がかかりました。ステージを駆け抜けるのと比較するとボス戦は爽快感に欠ける、というか若干ストレスも感じるくらいでした。各ステージのラストは大抵ボスが待ち構えていますし。ついでに言うと一部のザコ敵にも硬い・当てにくいという傾向が見られます。
ボスの行動パターンは一定の繰り返しでほぼ決まっている辺りは温情です。行動順を覚え、いつどの攻撃を入れれば効率よく削れるかがわかれば戦いにくさも変わってくるかと。「ガード」で被弾を無効化する、アイテムを適切に装着するのも忘れずに。

動作については今更言うべきではないかもしれません。発売直後は数々の動作不良に見舞われましたが、開発者の迅速な修正対応により解決しつつあります。もしかしたらボス戦にも今後バランス調整が入る可能性も。
キーコンフィグは今のところ攻撃、ジャンプといったキャラクターの動作に関する部分だけなので、決定やキャンセルも個別に設定できればありがたいです。

[h1]まとめ[/h1]
前作の流れを汲みつつ、新キャラクターやアクションを追加して走りやすくなり画面は高品質化。しかもぬるぬる動くドット絵で。続編として期待以上でした。ステージは数が多くて仕掛けもあれこれ、ボスは戦いづらさはあるけどこれも沢山います。そのせいか個人的にちょっとカロリーというか気力というか、消耗していっぺんには進めにくい感じはありました。これはその分濃密であることの裏付けとも言えるのかな。
キャラクターの外見が優れているだけではなく、ステージを駆けるアクションの中身もやり込みたくなる。そんな素敵さが溢れています。",1664701454,1664886090,True,11,0,0.564752399921417236,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's a massive improvement to the first game.

The controls feel slightly better the first game. Not only that but you have a guard button now. And it fits extremely well with the game. At times, it feels like a fighting game but suited well with platforming, as the guard button do another action, like air dashing for the cool purple dragon. It also makes the boss fights feel even more epic and badass, cuz you can kick their ass hard if you learn the guard.

Levels are also amazing. More has been done to separate one level from another. Each has even more distinct features and gimmicks to toy around with. Levels are also paced much better. Each level is shorter than the first game but it's a good thing here as there are more levels.

The boss fights were fantastic in the first game and they are just as fantastic here. The added guard button and improved controls make the boss fights a spectacle to behold. The game also feels more fair to newcomers with certain mechanics that can caters to your play style. 

Music is just as good as the first game. Top notch. Feels the mood perfectly. Certain songs carry leitmotifs from the first game. Can listen to it anytime!

The graphics are awesome as hell. Sprites moves beautifully and graceful. The background are some of the best scenery porn I have seen. Characters are really expressive too.

The story is the biggest improvement over the first game. The story feels more complex. Some characters develop over the course of the game. Character interactions and story moments can be fun, goofy or serious when needed. The world building is also surprisingly great.

There are hub worlds in this game. It makes the game's world feel alive. NPC's are great as well. They are harmless at worst and lively at best. They fit well.

It's also just written and voice acted far better, making the story easier to get invested in with less distractions like Carol's bathroom mic from the first game.

However, here's mainly why I'm writing this - I do recommend maybe holding off for a little bit because the game has been getting a LOT of patches lately, some of which are pretty major fixes like controller issues, save file corruption and music loop points. Playing the game at launch for me felt pretty good for the most part and I didn't have any real problems aside from weird controller binding problems (which were fixed!)

I'll update my review later on when I finish playing the game as all four characters.

[h2]Overall quality of the Game[/h2]

Very Satisfactory this game is absolutely worth your time!

[h2]Technical Quality of the Game[/h2]

Very Satisfied, it runs well even with Proton emulation under an obscure Linux Distribution.
There have been FPS issues in the first Freedom Planet during certain scenes like when the bosses exploded or during certain boss fights, i am happy to Report that there are no noticeable FPS issues this time!

My hardware:

CPU: four core, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4670
Graphicscard: GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
RAM: 16 GB DDR3
OS: Arch linux (proton was used to run the game)

[h2]Music and Graphics[/h2]

Same or even better then FP1, the Music is very nicely done and reminds me of games like jazz jackrabbit.

[h2]Gameplay and Difficulty[/h2]

You can choose between four different characters, each of them has different abilities and play styles.

I also like to mention the way difficulty is managed in this game, because the player has a lot of options to tailor their gaming experience. You can either be the super hardcore player by actively sabotaging your health and lives with certain items to create an especially hard challenge for yourself, or you can also craft or buy certain items to make it easier on yourself. There is also a timer for each level and high scores which makes the game interesting for completionists and speed runners.

Even the original FP1 lacks the experience that pulled off as complete a package as this game manages.

If you have a nostalgia or even a retro-fascination for the cool-factor stylings of Gunstar Heroes or Astal or even something more world-building focused like Klonoa or Symphony of the Night, Freedom Planet 2 puts the vibes of the era together in ways I've never seen before: Fun, fast-paced gameplay with extremely interesting gimmicks and environments, all wrapped up in a fun story that actually manages to feel poignant and inspiring in a way so few games manage.

Bosses take a bit of time to learn and 2 doesn't pull its punches - especially where the achievements are concerned - but that only helps take me back to an era that games seem to think they evolved out of, when really they just shifted away from something fun to something else equally fun.

In Freedom Planet 2, it's very hard to play the game without running into soft-locks, buggy collision, and other oddities that make the game feel somewhere between unpolished and lazy. A buggy mess in its current state, but hopefully with time this issue will be remedied.

Do not buy this game if your device cannot run it at a stable 60FPS. Because this game does not use a fixed high-precision physics timestep, if your game lags... you can clip through walls, teleporters, slopes, enemies, projectiles, you-name-it. And it's not just you that can clip through things, so can vital stage gimmicks like large falling objects that break blocks to reveal the way forwards, which causes a soft-lock. There are sections of the game where you have to kill all the enemies in an arena to progress, however if any of them clip out-of-bounds then you will be stuck and have to restart from the beginning.

There are several stages that have outright enemy spam. Some stages go on for far too long (Ancestral Forge, I'm looking at you), or just feel unpolished. A lot of the stages have incredibly stretched or squashed tiles all over the place; and very bland or repetitive tiling. The stages in FP1 always had a lot of variation, and were split into distinct segments which usually had slightly varying themes to keep the levels feeling fresh, and I feel that Freedom Planet 2 did not manage to do the same. A lot of stages are so samey that I can't even tell where I am up to even though I've played the stage. On a related note, since the camera can zoom out in this game the stages seem to have been designed to be [i]much[/i] bigger in visual scale, but they tend to just feel like they've got lots of vacant areas with not much going on instead.

The game uses a ""better"" version of the life system, but ultimately just feels punishing compared to Freedom Planet 1, where lives didn't matter (except at the end of Fortune Night). This system can be turned off, but I wish I could just rack up lives like in Freedom Planet 1 or Super Mario Bros. 3 (with a cap, of course) and then use them to revive when I need to.

Seemingly in order to compensate for not designing the game's enemies and projectiles to be reasonably avoidable, there's a new ""guard"" system which is very similar to Sonic 3's instashield, except that you can use it on the ground. However, the mechanic doesn't serve its function very well. There seems to be a delay when guarding, and you can't guard after just being hit. Additionally, guarding doesn't last long enough for you to make it out of harm's way the majority of the time and it doesn't neutralise or destroy projectiles you've guarded from, which leads large projectiles to just hit you anyway because you can't move normally while guarding.

Freedom Planet 1 didn't have an overly deep story, but personally I found it serviceable enough. For the sequel, the world of Avalice obviously needed to be expanded a lot, and there's a lot of interesting political themes in this game. However, I feel that ultimately the main conflict of the game is quite contrived. The game attempts to humanise its main villain by [spoiler]giving them a cute gay romance backstory, but the character also refers to themself as the embodiment of violence which makes it pretty hard to empathise with them[/spoiler].

Lastly, I'd like to mention this game's absolute strongest point: Freedom Planet 2 has some seriously kick-ass artwork. Some of its stages are outright gorgeous, and the poor stage composition shouldn't take away from the fact that the game's artwork is very visually appealing and varied. Some of the backgrounds struggle to stand-out a little, but I feel that that is not a huge issue.

I called it ""doing Sonic better than Sonic does Sonic"". It was an outstanding game and this is a disappointing sequel.

I'll start with the good stuff, graphics and game play. It feels really good to play, really snappy and fluid. And the pixel art is extremely detailed and looks like a huge amount of time, effort and love went into it. I'm particularly a fan of the sprite of one of the bosses which is a huge rabbit mech, which is just really impressive. In general the bosses are a highlight of this game.

I want to say however that the game play suffers because of the actual level design. It's extremely unintuitive and confusing. There's too many puzzles. In the majority of levels I would be zooming around before realising either i'm going in circles somehow, or there's a sealed door or something else that just stops me dead. And I have no idea where i'm going or what to do. Honestly in this kind of game, that is a running, action spectacle, there shouldn't ever be a single moment where I'm trying to figure out what i'm supposed to be doing. To put things in perspective, Sonic levels average 3-6 minutes each. Want to know the longest time I spent in a level here? 63'25''13. Yes, over an hour. For just one of the 24 levels. This was due to it being an extremely unintuitive and complex puzzle heavy level. It was open in design and featured underwater sections and water level changing mechanics. Yes, 2D water temple mechanics. It should be obvious but it never, ever is. The levels are overly long, averaging over ten minutes, without being broken into two acts.

Next, the music is bad. Pretty much every track from the first game was a banger. The music here is generic and doesn't fit the energetic nature of the game or the tone of some of the things in it. I can imagine in my head several of the bangers in the first game like i'm listening to them right now. I don't remember a single track from this sequel. With the exception of one or two remixes taken from the first game. So you know, another composers work. Garbage.

The story even in the first game was divisive. But most wanted the option to skip it, which they added. it was called classic mode and just threw you into action packed level after level, with only the context of what happens in the stages. Bizarrely, this was completely removed in this sequel, which forces many many cut scenes on you and throws you into completely pointless hub worlds filled with NPC's. I watched the cut scenes during the first half of the game and it drifted between feeling aimless, boring or making pretty poor attempts at humour. Writing humour is difficult and so many things intended to be funny came off as irritating or cringe. Specifically there's a few whole characters who are intentionally obnoxious and annoying. They aren't minor characters either, they appear many many many times as bosses and in cut scenes with their catchphrases and shrieking laughter. I also don't want to sit down in a Sonic game with NPCs and study the games lore in a library (actual moment in the game). I get it, you made your expansive rich lore, but I don't care, I just want to play the game and I don't think many people do care about the war between the ancient war between the dragons and the snake mechanoids or whatever.

I encouraged Freedom Planet 1 to branch out from its inspirations, because i truly believed it was better than them. Turns out a lot of people said that to them because they really did. They expanded the scope of absolutely everything. Everything is bigger, richer, more populated, more believable, more beautiful... More bloated. It lost it's way somewhere. I am imagining the devs of this game like a Game Master from DnD or another tabletop. Just writing and filling this game with so many ideas, passion and love. Some things work, most things don't, and there's a lot of it. And somewhere in the process the fundamentals of this kind of action game were lost.

What would i suggest is this. Bring down the scope. It doesn't need to be bigger to be better. Shorter levels, or at least split it up into acts again. Every level should be linear. Splitting paths are fine, dead ends and a million puzzles aren't. If you must dedicate huge resources to your lore, characters, hub worlds, cut scenes, voice acting, make it optional. Or just don't and tell the story through game play, like your genesis inspirations manage. Less is more.",1664527870,1664528189,False,22,1,0.567722678184509277,0,True,False,False,True,,,

One problem is that it's way too complicated.  For my money, at least, a Sonic game should be simple: you jump through enemies to kill them, you avoid obstacles, and you run to the right.  This game has four characters, with combos, direction-sensitive inputs, special moves, a dodge mechanic, and gear: it's half-way to being a medroidvania.  I'm fine with metroidvanias, but I don't think the combination works.

This game also commits some of the cardinal sins of boss battles -- again, at least for my money.  Some boss battles have multiple phases; if you die, you have to start over from the first phase; and some of them have long cutscenes with dialog before the fight, and that's where you pick up every time.  At least they're skippable, thank god.

I also kind of hate some of the characters -- they're pretty much just stock characters, and they're not particularly likable or interesting takes on those tired archetypes.  And the writing is pretty insipid.  And I get it, it's a videogame, not the theatre, but still.  I think they're trying to be genre-aware and ""meta,"" and I kind of think how absolutely conventional and cliched they're being is supposed to be part of the joke, but I don't think it comes off.  (Call me a pretentious prick if you want.)

I particularly loathe Carol the Wildcat.  She very much reminds me of the kind of friend who's still breaking plates and pouring syrup on the table even though he's 25 now, not 5, and it's not being a ""free spirit"" or ""wacky"" anymore, now it's just being an impulsive, selfish asshole.  I kind of like Neera Li, because her reaction to the rest of the cast is like my reaction to the rest of the cast: she finds them frustrating and wants to shoot them.

Maybe kind of inevitable, but kind of like any game where you've got different characters with multiple moves and special mechanics, I feel like the character balance might not be great.  In particular, I think Neera really suffers because she can't move during her Sniper Drive.  There are couple of bosses that move around a lot, that Carol seems to be able to just kind of cling to their face and slash, but Neera really struggles to keep up with and hit.

Из минусов разве что:
- Разделение игровых персонажей по сохранениям, с внедрением карты уровней можно было дать возможность выбирать каждую героиню по мере сюжета.
- Попытались раскрыть лор, круто, но почему не до конца.
- Обучение в сюжетке за Лайлак может сильно затруднить прохождение, так как не рассказывает об Boost Breaker, а боссы на него сильно опираются.
- Есть всё же парочка идиотских уровней, к примеру Nalao Lake.

Lovable heroines: Check
Bangin' soundtrack: Check
Tight controls and fast paced platforming: Check 
Brutal boss encounters that will keep you on your toes: Check
Cheesy dialogue: Check 

It's a Freedom Planet game. 

The core mechanics of the original are improved and expanded upon and the heroines have been re-balanced giving Milla and Carol the same satisfying feeling to play as Lilac (who in the first was arguably the best kitted character by a long-shot) while retaining the unique play-style between all 4 playable characters. Neera's kit, unfortunately, I feel plays a little too stiffly for the high-speed action. 

For the platformer expert the boss encounters, so far, have been easier than in Freedom Planet 1 but it's definitely balanced out by the fact that the difference between a death and a game over is no longer mere formality. On expert mode a game over will leave you with the choice of either restarting the stage from the beginning or buying your way back to your most recent checkpoint with a not unsubstantial sum of your hard-earned crystals. 

There are items that can be obtained that can offer nominal improvements to your characters (or even add additional challenge in exchange for a higher bonus at the end of the level) but for the purist it is far from a mandatory part of the game and empty item slots give you a nominal increase to your end of level bonus so the item system is definitely balanced with the purists (who would probably rather ignore the item system) in mind- even to the point that two key bonus challenge items are automatically equipped at the start of an expert play-through. 

My two biggest complaints would be that Neera just doesn't feel anywhere near as satisfying to play as one of the original trio and on some of the longer boss fights the boss music will stop dead for a couple of seconds before restarting instead of looping smoothly. 

I will update the review later if the experience falls off, otherwise just assume that the entire game is rated:

Starting in Graphics, They look vivid and with better quality, some of the scenary shows more details comparing to the original. The Characters designs shows improvements and now they look grown up, after 3 years they should and the world has change a lot during that time too.

Story, oh boy, one of the weak parts of the original game due to pacing going light and dark too much and it was too long, well here I see a better pacing where the beginning is more light hearted until the main villain arrives where the story goes serious, I know about the comic relief moments but for me it is fine to just stop for a bit and shows that the characters even if they are focus, they still can have a laugh at times.

Music, For me both games have great soundtracks, I prefer to enjoy both and that is. each game have bangers so it is up your taste.

Finally Level Design, Some say maps are long and well it feels like that in some ocasions but when you learn them, the don´t fell like that, I know Ancestral Forge and Clockwork Arboretum are the longest ones but after my second run, I already know what to do so I was going fast as possible on them.

Freedom Planet 2 does what a sequel needs to do, improve from the original while adding new stuffs, I know the game was buggy after lunch(as every game) but in the end I got fun and enjoy it.

I was in the middle of high school when the first trailer dropped out of nowhere, and here I am now, graduated and finally getting a chance to play the sequel to one of my favorite games.

And in almost every way, it absolutely lives up to those expectations. First off, the game is BEAUTIFUL. The sprite-work was already fantastic in the first game, but Galaxytrail went above and beyond to make sure every inch of this game is dripping in color and detailed animation. It's absolute eyecandy and I can't get enough.

The gameplay is just as fast and as thrilling as before, with huge, incredibly complex stages full of unique enemies, unique set pieces, and plenty of personality that make each of them super memorable. There were a couple stages where I ended up getting lost and spending a few minutes backtracking to try to figure out what my objective was, but those moments are rare and I'm sure those stages will become less confusing on multiple playthroughs. And while the boss fights in the first Freedom Planet are hard to top, I'd say that a few bosses in this game end up doing just that, with fast-paced, frantic fights that are extremely thrilling and challenging.

The story is overall very good. Things feel quite a lot cheerier and goofier than certain moments in the first game, and while I personally missed those darker moments, I still appreciated the charming, fun-loving writing with a lot of strong humor. The heroes are all just as likable and as memorable as before, with a few of them getting some serious glow-ups. I always thought that Milla and Neera were both written just fine in the previous game, but this sequel's interpretation of them make them so much more interesting and enjoyable. And while I don't think that Merga, this game's primary antagonist, quite lives up to the awesomely evil Lord Brevon from the previous game, she still has enough impact on the story as well as enough of a cool factor to make her a strong, memorable villain.

The only strict downgrade I'd have to mention is the soundtrack. The previous game's soundtrack is honestly one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time. It was packed to the brim with banger after banger, and it made the stages and the boss fights so much more exciting. And while this game's soundtrack certainly isn't bad, I also can't say it quite lives up. There were a few moments I was wondering why I wasn't feeling as pumped up as similar moments from the last game, and everytime I realized that it was because the music wasn't quite doing for me. Don't get me wrong, the music is still excellent and there are absolutely a few standout tracks, I just can't say it's all a homerun like the first game's.

I can't recommend this game enough. The negatives I experienced are nothing more than minor bugs and nitpicks, and the experience was WAY more than worth the 25 buck pricetag. GalaxyTrail deserves your money. Kindly fork it over and play this game.",1664297366,1664297485,True,1,0,0.50113379955291748,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The seven-year wait was *mostly* worth it, because the game is higher-quality than the first in multiple ways. The script-writing is vastly improved, and there's a ton of content and inventive environmental mechanics, at least for a so-called ""Sonic clone."" Tyson Tan's character designs breathe some new life into it visually, too.

The levels are all more or less designed to be accessible for each of the characters, so there's no more character-specific level alterations or weird side-stages that would make some of the playable characters feel like they’re an afterthought. However, this unified level design also means that some of the visceral speed and action present in the first game was lost in translation, which starts to lower the all-important drama-factor that made the first FP so memorable. Actually, the dramatization is lower in the cut scenes, too (torture scene from the first game, anyone? Dail's father being beheaded in the first two minutes?). The main villain is also, I would say, a lot less threatening than Brevon for a whole host of reasons I won't spoil—despite the stakes still theoretically being high.

I was also sometimes confused as to what on earth I was fighting in a given stage. It's obvious that not everything is some Brevon-aligned remnant rampaging mindlessly around, but if it isn't that... then what is it? Why do some of these early stages have enemies at all? All it would take is a quick, simple explanation as to why we have to fight things in order to trigger a sense of urgency in the player (Shenlin Park and Phoenix Highway come to mind).

Emotional gravity and plot aside, all of the levels now have more of a ""puzzle-platformer"" feel to them, as do some of the bosses. Point-dodging with an actual button is a thing in this game (unlike the first one), but it's obviously not something you can mash fast enough to dodge every attack on the harder fights. Neera and Carol really only have dodging as an option to defend themselves consistently; Lilac's invincibility frames with the dragon-boost make it just a tad OP since it also allows you to deal damage and go flying in a direction on top of the invincibility. Milla's shield is really good for protection if you get better at reflexively using it, and several bosses can have projectiles reflected to deal damage against them (also OP). Carol can technically use her wheel-toss jump to go invincible for a couple of frames, but just try doing that consistently and not getting hit by something anyway—half the time, you’re better off throwing it for some ranged damage and not jumping to its location at all.

Sometimes, certain characters struggle on specific boss fights because their character-specific mechanics just can't keep up as well as others’ do. People might find Neera to be a challenge in particular—no shield like Milla, and no ultra-fast close-range attacks like Lilac and Carol. Neera can use her focus-state to start hitting faster, but it drains her special meter, disallowing use of ""frost arts."" It's unfortunately also bound to the same button as ""dodge,"" meaning you'll accidentally trigger the focus state while just trying to survive instead of using it for burst windows. As of this writing, I'm apparently part of only 3% of players that've beaten the game as Neera (which I did without items/potions all the way through), and I'm interested to see how much that percentage increases over time. 

Overall, the playability of the whole roster is much better than the first game, but there are still some snags and balance issues. Actually, I liked having a more challenging character to play, but some other people may not. If in doubt, just play Lilac (speed and beatdown), or secondarily, Milla (ranged attacks, shield, jumping really high).

One of the cooler features is the item system. Items modify how you run levels—they can either be used to make the levels easier in various ways, or they can be used to make the levels harder in order to get achievements and amped-up currency rewards. Since this game series (much like Sonic) is one that people enjoy replaying to keep refining their personal bests and exploring levels, the addition of optional modifiers to your runs is a really good inclusion to stretch the content even further.

The soundtrack is also good, once again. I'd say it's ranked just slightly lower than the first, but there are some really good tracks here. In particular, listen to: Shenlin Park, Globe Opera 1, Adventure Square, Ancestral Forge, Magma Starscape and Bakunawa Rush.

FP2 doesn’t quite reach the visceral and explosive heights of the first one, but it’s still a really good game with attractive retro-graphics, lots of unique levels and enjoyable combat. Just watch out for that final fight if you're playing it on hard with Neera...

Overall score: 4/5

That said, much of the first game's signature consistency, intensity, and precision feels somewhat lost in the exchange, with levels and bosses sometimes falling flat, and the otherwise superb pixel artwork appearing somewhat mangled by the dynamic camera.

There's also the questionable decision to lock the story-free Classic mode away, but thankfully the writing, voice work, tone, and overall pacing have been significantly improved from the original (and you can still skip any and all cutscenes if you prefer).  More problematic is the non-linear progression of levels, which results in a scattershot difficulty curve that squanders one of the core strengths of Freedom Planet.  Conversely, improvements to Carol and Milla's movesets, as well as the addition of newcomer Nerra, ensure each campaign is as much a delight to traverse as Lilac's. 

Despite a lukewarm opening act, Freedom Planet 2 at last provides a definitively superior experience over the first game, although which one you'll prefer likely comes down to what drew you to the series in the first place.  If it was the Sonic-like traversal and platforming, as well as the callous difficulty curve, then you'll probably gravitate back to the original.  If it was the Gunstar Heroes-esque combat, stage variety, and cathartic boss fights, then the sequel achieves the fullest aspirations of that gameplay loop.

First of all, it's impossible not to be impressed by the amount of real content in this game. The game could feasibly take someone 10 hours to finish on a first playthrough and I expect most will be over 8 hours at least. For an indie 2D platformer with a breakneck pace that's a lot of level. The level design is more ambitious than the first game with long, complex, multi-route levels. There are many gimmicks and almost all levels have a good sense of individual identity both visually and in terms of gameplay.

This scope is impressive but it's clear that the developers had ambitions beyond reason, leading to both a lengthy development period and a really hit-and-miss quality to the levels and boss fights. Some levels, like the Ancestral Forge and Nalao Lake, are really bad, but there are also some great stages— Lightning Tower is my favourite, mixing in some very light puzzle elements with hazards that are activated as you turn on power, and generally a more calculated level design with a good sense of progress as you climb.

Sadly, most of the levels are at least a little chaotic, as there are enemies and stage hazards that seem unavoidable given the speed of the game. In one stage, there is a crushing block hazard that drops so fast that you actually can't avoid it if you're stood still, which you may be if you boosted forward and bopped off the wall where it comes down. Enemies are almost entirely not worth dealing with, as many of them have untelegraphed attacks and a tonne of HP, but you will still take plenty of damage from enemies that attack as you run past. The added guard mechanic seems useless but thankfully wasn't required for Lilac, whose dash has about a billion i-frames and does good damage.

In general, the difference between FP1 and 2 is that the former feels more restrained, with level design that guides you forward, whereas FP2 regularly makes it difficult to tell which way you're meant to be going. And unlike FP1, the core gameplay isn't quite as engaging, since besides some good platforming and gimmicks you're mostly just ignoring the enemies and taking random hits. It lacks that sense of connection. Doesn't help that when you do attack an enemy, there is no feeling of impact (unlike the player character who gets stunned by hits). The effect of this is that the game is quite exhausting to play at times and it took me a while to finish.

And those bad boss fights... man. The fights against really large bosses are usually fine, mid-sized bosses are mixed and the player-character-sized bosses are almost all complete dogshit. Why? Well, smaller foes are typically either off-screen, or close enough to instantly cause harm to you. Also, many of their attacks turn their bodies into instant hurtboxes, and often aren't well telegraphed. Some are less bad than others, but the absolute worst is [spoiler]Askal[/spoiler], who does half-screen jumps into ground-slams, and spends half his time surrounded by little projectiles. Also a dashing punch that comes from offscreen that you have to anticipate every time he stops slamming, because there is no other cue.

The writing for the first game was much maligned and if anything this sequel doubles down, but I can't bring myself to hate it. I love that the furry freaks behind these games put their all into making their fantasy about anthropomorphic cats & dogs, colonialism and historical revisionism come to life... sincerely, it's kind of wholesome. In terms of quality it's like some kid's TV show. Whatever. The lowest point is probably Captain Kalaw. He seems as if the writer played the Ratchet and Clank remake and though Captain Klark was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo frickin funny. To be fair, that only jumps out to me because the writing is otherwise much less bad than that game. I also saw a reviewer compare it to YIIK which seems like a wildly unfair assessment. This is fine for small kids but also tedious to sit through for us because we are adults and we like to consume dense things rather than liquid slurry.

I know that this review comes across as negative, and that's largely because I can't help but compare it negatively to the previous game. It's really not all that bad though, just hit-and-miss. Some levels are fun and suffer less from the general design issues. There were points where I'd sit down to play the game, go through two 8-minute levels and be completely checked out afterwards. Other times I'd get hooked on a really good level or set of levels and find myself playing for a good while.

For a quick summary, if FP1 is an 8.5/10 than FP2 is like... a 6.5 or 7.",1664213461,1664213461,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

跟1代一樣 (1代也是大推)，特別推薦給喜歡Sonic / 洛克人 的玩家，得到的遊戲體驗可能在這之上，單純喜歡動作遊戲的玩家也是十分推薦。

官網有Demo免費下載試玩，想玩的朋友可以去試一下手感(?) 但不論新手還是Action game老手，一律都推薦先用Lilac通關。

畫面:
比起1代有不少的改變及改良，主角Lilac感覺改變最大，能否接受很看個人(我自己OK)
而遊戲的流暢度還是保留該系列的特色，玩起來還是可以有1代的速度感。

音樂:
很優秀，不少關卡的BGM 我自己十分喜歡，但也有覺得不完美的地方，總覺得不少boss戰BGM 魄力不足(我自己只有1~2首印象比較深)，之前1代boss 戰的BGM 好像比較有緊張感/激昂。

Speed run / RTA:
其實也十分推薦會玩RTA的玩家，本身此遊戲給玩家有一個感覺就是設計上是為speed run而設，目前發售後只是2週左右，已經有人在研究個別關卡的speed run 路線(Lilac用2分16 跑完關卡""Airship Sigwada"")，各種巫術/ skip boss / 強行空衝跳躍等等，但能否爽快地一口氣跑完全場(?) 則可能還要再觀望。

I love the story, the extra flare of the animations, the fast paced gameplay, the oodles of secrets to find, and characters, both old and new, who whisk our heroes into another heartpounding, exciting journey.

Fiquei fã instantâneo desse jogo, de como ele é tudo que eu sempre quis num Sonic 2D: ele é focado na velocidade, mas também consegue ter exploração, tem um combate legal, tem uma história surpreendentemente boa, tem um fator replay absurdo, tem level design fenomenal, chefões complexos e desafiadores, enfim. Assim que eu terminei eles anunciaram que estavam fazendo um segundo jogo, e o hype foi instantâneo também. Era pra ele ter sido lançado em 2017... 2018... depois adiado pra 2021... e agora finalmente lançou. E a espera valeu MUITO a pena.

É uma evolução em todos os quesitos, além de ser gigantesco. O primeiro acho que tinha umas ~10 fases, esse tem umas ~25, fora as coisas extras pra explorar. Eu terminei a campanha da Lilac, mas além das 3 personagens do original (Lilac, Carol e Milla) agora existe mais uma campanha com a Neera. O gameplay ficou muito mais fluído que o primeiro, e o moveset foi melhorado também: agora tem como cancelar o dragon boost no ar e ele vai gerar uma explosão que dá dano nos inimigos por um tempo, e o shield, que antes era um assist e agora é uma habilidade pra se defender de ataques no estilo parry. Além disso, algumas melhorias na movimentação deixou tudo muito mais dinâmico (a que eu mais gostei foi poder cancelar o ciclone com o boost, por exemplo).
O level design continua excelente, e a diversidade das fases está ainda melhor. Tem muito mais set-pieces também, que pra mim é um ponto forte em plataformers. A música continua boa como o primeiro, porém achei que alguns sons do primeiro tem um charme que esse infelizmente não pegou bem. Muito efeito sonoro é reciclado do primeiro, lógico, mas tem alguns do primeiro que eu gostava demais e não veio pro segundo :(. O hud/mapa principal é uma adição legal e dá um dinamismo pra jogatina também. Agora tem um sistema de itens que podem ser adquiridos com alguns NPCs ou com a Milla, que na verdade são modificadores que pode deixar o jogo mais fácil ou mais difícil. Dá pra ignorar completamente esse sistema, mas ainda assim é uma adição legal. Por conta do mapa, ficou mais fácil explorar e refazer as fases também.

Agora em questão de história... Apesar de eu ter gostado, e de ter muitos pontos positivos e ser mais bem escrito em comparação, eu ainda prefiro a do primeiro jogo. A vilã desse é muito mais complexa que o Brendon e isso é excelente, os acontecimentos são memoráveis e o pacing é ótimo, mas ainda assim acho a história do primeiro com um charme a mais. Tem acontecimentos igualmente marcantes nos dois, porém o do primeiro é mais impactante na minha opinião. O que não tira mérito nenhum da história deste segundo, aliás. Inclusive acho que eles conseguiram fazer algo realmente muito interessante e expandir o próprio mundo de Avalice sem apelar pra (talvez spoiler se você tem expectativas em relação a história do 1, mas é spoiler leve)[spoiler]um segundo vilão vindo de outro planeta, por exemplo, ou ""reciclar"" o Brendon[/spoiler]. Foi um bom direcionamento e enriqueceu o universo e os personagens atuais.

Na dificuldade vi alguns falando que está mais difícil que o primeiro, e eu na verdade achei o contrário. Alguns chefões tem uma curva alta de dificuldade meio inexplicável mas, como sempre, é só questão de aprender o padrão. O gameplay mais fluído ajuda muito também. Os que achei mais difíceis em si foram as lutas mano-a-mano em si, pq os chefões robôs/gigantes, por exemplo, achei todos bem tranquilos. Porém não espere um jogo fácil, assim como o primeiro, esse é um plataformer mais desafiador. Além disso, o sistema de vidas foi descartado, e agora toda vez que você morre tem a opção de continuar exatamente de onde está (porém com ao HP totalmente reduzido) ou voltar no último checkpoint (como se fosse perder uma vida igual no primeiro). Continuar de onde parou é limitado porém, como se fossem vidas. Mas assim que perder todas, a única coisa é que vc vai voltar do último checkpoint.

Em resumo, Freedom Planet 2 é um sucessor excelente e eu não poderia estar mais feliz com o resultado. Superou minhas expectativas e recomendo fortemente pra quem gosta de plataformer fast-paced. Espero ver mais jogos desse estúdio e continuar me surpreendendo positivamente.",1664151007,1664151007,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The more I play, the more I like it. 

Is the dialogue cringe at times? Sure. 
(Update: Got further into the game. This dialogue and story writing is amazing!)
Are some of the bosses jank or weird sometimes? Yes.

But despite its flaws, I see so many major improvements over the first game. (A game which, by the way, I've finished at a 100% on the Nintendo Switch)

The writing, the gameplay, and even the music are all better than they have ever been... and I love it. I'm so immensely surprised by it.

At the time I write this review I'll have around 9 hours, but believe me when I say that it might go up to 40 or more when I'm done finishing this game at a 100%. Having a blast with it, even if the battlesphere's a bit wack.

Heavily recommended if you like platforming games in general.

Update #1: After exactly 17 hours, I have 100%'d the game with Carol (except for the museum, still gotta repair that). And my opinion of the game's... not changed much! It's still really good, I loved a lot of aspects of it. Some of the hub songs don't loop, and a lot of the voices sound quieter than others, but I'm sure they're working on fixing them, so I didn't mind that too much.

Story-wise though, damn. I actually got engaged with it at the end, was pretty fun.

---

Update #2: I have 100%'d the game, having obtained every badge/achievement available, which also means having cleared all characters, obtained all S Ranks, Items and Vinyls.

Gonna miss this game. It's been a ride. 

Sadly, after your second playthrough, the story begins to lose some of its charm however.

While I did heavily appreciate the added cutscenes for Milla and Neera, they really felt shoehorned into the early conversations, ending up with some of their dialogues just straight up being ignored (mostly in Milla's case).

But again, the added cutscenes made up for it quite well. I didn't think Neera would even have one at first! Ended up pleasantly surprised about that.

Overall... I still heavily recommend the game! It's great! And the soundtrack's great too!

Gonna be waiting for Freedom Planet 3, if that ever becomes a thing.

Once that day comes, I will buy it on day one, and play it through and through as well.

However, I slowly fell off of the series over time, since I began to kinda see the cracks in the game. When FP2's release date was confirmed, I can't really say I was excited, but I did want to see how it came along. When it finally came out, I bought it, but to me, it felt like it was more out of obligation. Eventually I played it, and, well...

My philosophy is that if you go in with no expectations, even the mediocre games are enjoyable. Despite having no expectations, FP2 was the biggest surprise hit of the year for me. So far, I've only cleared Lilac's story, but I went for all the Time Capsules too, and it's been a really fun ride.

Here's what I'd consider the biggest pros:
- Selectable story arcs. I like how you can not only set your own path through the story, but play with the difficulty in a way that still keeps every story beat intact.
- The original game's levels felt like they dragged on a lot. However, this one's levels lean a bit more into the speed-based gameplay, likely a result of Christian Whitehead's assistance on programming and level design. A typical level in this can take 6 minutes to complete, which works perfectly for stages that combine a Sonic stage's two acts into one.
- The voice acting is very much improved. In FP1, a good amount of the VAs were relatively new to the scene, or had come from the Internet. Dawn M. Bennett was a particular example, having no experience prior. However, in FP2, a lot more professional VAs were cast, and the VAs from the original game have hit the big time, having gotten a lot of training and more roles under their belt.
- The story feels a bit more... direct now? The first game's story had a number of things that just felt unnecessary, and didn't do much other than show characters' personalities. This one still gives them plenty of character, but shows it more in how they react to situations in the story, and there's less that could be considered unnecessary. Even the Battlesphere episode, which seems a bit disconnected at first, turns out to be important to the story as it introduces Captain Kalaw.
- All the characters feel far better to play as. Carol's Jump Disc is a brilliant way to give her a new ability on the level of Lilac's boost, Milla's combat has been heavily reworked while still keeping her primary gimmick, and Neera is great for the players who want to focus more on combat. Lilac has been changed the least, but the boost cancel ability is incredibly satisfying to pull off against a boss.
- The items are fun to mess with, allowing you to create your own gameplay experience. While I haven't played around with them much, there's a lot of potential combinations I've seen.
- Unlocking the extra final stage involves just playing through a set of short levels that play like the normal game. While things like Sonic's Special Stages can be a fun change of pace, they can sometimes be infuriating if you're not good at them. This method ensures that as long as you can play the main game well enough, you can unlock the extra final stage.
- I enjoyed the extra final stage's aesthetic. That's all I'll say because of spoilers.


While the game is fun, there are also some other things I want to point out. While they aren't necessarily bad, some may see them as such.

- Some bosses, particularly in the late game, have too much HP, and can be hard for those who want to just play something Sonic-like.
- The ranking system relies entirely on the crystal bonus percentage you get at the end of a stage. If you want to get a high rank, you need to use items to get a high bonus, instead of just going for a high crystal score.
- The storyline feels like a lot was taken from Sonic Adventure 2. While this necessarily isn't a bad thing, it still comes across as somewhat unoriginal.
- In a later level, a boss enemy appears as a normal enemy. However, its HP remains the same. If I were designing a game like this, I'd reduce the HP quite a bit. That's what makes it work in games like Space Invaders Infinity Gene: bosses appearing as normal enemies have less HP so that shooting them down makes you feel strong.
- It can be easy to not realize the Time Capsules exist on your first run. I definitely wasn't aware myself. I'd probably add a post-credits scene showing the museum in Parusa where you can find the only non-Battlesphere one.
- The museum side quest is fun, but it can be hard to get all the cores you need to complete the exhibits.
- The game ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, and we don't know if it's going to be resolved or not. This is kind of unfortunate, especially after seven years of development.
- One of my friends mentioned this, but I don't see it as much of an issue: the game's visual identity was made to set it apart from Sonic, but the levels and story still feel very Sonic-esque.

All in all, I firmly believe the positives outweigh the negatives. No matter what, no matter how hard a boss was or how much trouble an enemy gave me, I kept going because it was an enjoyable time, far better than I thought it would be. Seven years of development may have killed my interest originally, but it's clear that instead of sitting and doing nothing the whole time, Sabrina spent a lot of time making the game fun and enjoyable.",1664146221,1664146221,True,5,0,0.520055055618286133,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Pros:
+ 4 playable characters
+ good level design (i would say it beats FP1)
+ 38 boss fights (mixed i would say half better than FP1 and half worse)
+ a lot of stages (themes are very well)
+ story is very well  i prefer the character interactions and comedy in this one more but i prefer Brevon as villian a lot more which makes the story more interesting and not like a circus joke how Merga kind of are
+ Battlesphere challenges are fun and i say a neat idea also every single boss can be played there too
+ soundtrack to be honest is alright too but if would compare it with FP1 then it dont look so good but on its own its alright (Menu Theme, Shade Armory, Zao Land and Globe Opera 2 are still reallly good examples for worthy FP music)
+ art style is really the best thing about the game (very detailed pixels)
+ World map is alright i like it also the Gallery room is a nice idea
+ Mini game playable ""Fish Frog"" some training challenges and 1vs1 against the FP crew
+ 2 bosses only for battlesphere which shows how much effort but into the game
+ voice acting is a big improvment compared to FP1 and very well on its own too

Cons:
- what a wonder no Time Attack mode that really suprised me the same with your highest crystal score isnt here anymore too
- Merga and Weapons Core are the only stages i dont like and they are the last two and the main reason are those little swords they are way to fast (BUT NOT FOR LILAC I THINK THIS TWO BOSSES ARE MORE DESIGNED EXCLUSIV FOR HERE BECAUSE THE OTHER ONES ARE TO SLOW FOR BOTH)
- Neera is a little boring to play as also her movement fighting mechanics arent the best (Torque from FP1 even was a lot more fun than Neera in this game)
- the final boss Merga is kind of a little boring compared to Brevon (brevon had unique 3 fights, space ship, robot and himself without much projectile crap and Merga on the other side did almost only projectile stuff and dont had some unique in there)
- boss theme soundtracks are not memorable to be suprised they dont have this engergy from the first one they are way to soft (the final stages also are to soft for an finale atleast for me)

It had a good, compelling story, interesting world-building, fluid controls, excellent soundtrack and decent characters all around (albeit not perfect in this regard). What's most impressive about this game was that it was a passion project, made by a few fans from their homes, and still turned out as well as it did.

Freedom Planet 2, which came out a full seven years later, proves that this new world of Avalice (the planet that Freedom Planet's series takes place on) can pull its weight, and then some. Everything that was present in Freedom Planet 1 has been taken and elevated to a new standard of quality:
- The combat and controls are polished to a sliver sheen, with each character now having even more setting them apart than its predecessor allowed. Special mention goes to the new Guard feature, which allows you to precisely defend against and defeat tougher, more powerful opponents than what came in the previous game. This game does not pull its punches: you WILL learn how to fight, and fight well. Good thing this game's combat flows like a river of pure water and is a joy to figure out.
- The level layouts show the series' homage to Sonic the most, being multi-layered and easily speedrunnable for those that have mastered the quick, responsive controls.
- True to the generational shift, Freedom Planet 2 now emulates the 32-bit style found on the old Playstation systems, but still shows a serious upgrade to Galaxy Trail's budget and skills as developers and presents a wonderful charm to the world it depicts.
- With Freedom Planet 1 laying the groundwork for its world-building, this game can now take the runway and fly high, telling compelling stories while digging deep into the world's lore--shaking up a few things along the way.
- The next most notable upgrade comes from the characterizations and voice acting: everyone has improved from their record-from-home days with a bona-fide voice recording studio, courtesy of one Christopher Sabat (and yes, he too voices a prominent character in the game; bonus!). The characters truly have a chance to grow into their own as the story explores each of their backstories and personalities more.
- Somehow, the soundtrack is even better than its predecessors' was. As of writing this, there is no immediate means to purchase it; this review waits (im)patiently for its release, so he can buy it post-haste.

Overall, this game is absolutely solid and is a must-play for any Sonic fans, or any platformer fans out there. (And I recommend playing the first game so you can get a good idea of what to expect.)

The furry/sonic fandom is strange and terrifying. Wariness of any title featuring anthropomorphic animals doing sidescrolling is wisdom.

With that out of the way, the game is fantastic. After playing the original Freedom Planet this was at the top of my wishlist, and the game hasn’t disappointed in the least. Gameplay is top notch and each of the four characters is worthy of a full playthrough. The game also does a good job of balancing the tone for the kind of game it is. The game goes from funny/derpy moments most of the time to discussing genocide, but somehow manages to stick the landing. The story was consistently fun, and the serious bits felt dramatic/heartfelt. A lot of it doesn’t quite make sense if you examine it critically, but if you don’t think too hard on it and you’ll have a fun time. 

A few other game highlights, some already mentioned above:

• Really nice sprite work with a lot of love to characterization. Unnecessary touches like special animations when your characters talk to smaller animals abound

• Great music throughout. In other reviews you will see people note boss themes hit harder in the first game (and I agree), but the music is still awesome. If Magma Starscape doesn’t get your blood pumping, you might be clinically dead

• Good challenge baseline with options for both those seeking mastery and those who are bad at videogames

• One of the characters is voice acted by the guy who does Piccolo

It is just a really fun game and worthy of the “Overwhelming Positive” status you will see once it hits 500 reviews.

On the downside, your steam recommendations will have suggestions like Fur Affinity 4: Beasts in Heat for a while after you buy this. Ignore those suggestions for a few days and eventually your queue will go back to normal. Probably. Hopefully.

Imma be as fair as possible here, because while i really like the game and it feel like the pros significantly outweigh the cons, expect some of the cons to be some real stinkers or just flatout be disappointments. This is largely based off my run of Lilac's story, which i poured 18hrs into the game. Maybe this will change later on in the other runs, we'll see. There were some weird decisions i've seen for this game Just to list a few: Only Neera is a new playable character (who was available in the demo..), few demo updates, no Patreon for better support, No DLC plans, and Classic mode is post-game. We'll actually begin with the weakest aspect of the game.

Story:
It's not nonexistent, just has some amateur writing. It's not bad to where i regret playing & beating the game, but it's sorta obvious that the writer lacks writing experience and deficient in exposure to stories of sustenance. Even character bias occurs. So the beginning feels a bit off even, because they're saying Merga was encased in a crystal prison underwater. Later on you find out that this was due to the Kingdom Stone, which provides tons of power but they didnt establish that it can even do anything. I believe the Earth dragons got use out of it like this due to their tech, but it would've really helped if we were shown that, which brings me to a big fundamental point both games suffer from. The writing sin of ""Tell, Dont Show"" and the game is a repeat offender of this. It's disappointing in a way too, cuz they had YEARS to make this game, but couldn't show us even half of what's going on in the story? When this happens, there's an even bigger chance that ppl can easily miss something. So this much is bad because it easily turned into massive missed opportunities. Back to the story, they find out later a piloted mechaniliod gorilla destroyed their treehouse. It was offscreen and i forgot this even happened. If they SHOWED it, probably would've re-enforced my memory, but feels like even they forgot this later on. They also didnt show when the hell Milla became a scientist AND when she got herself a lab. Even weirder that she had no interest in this in the first game so that was pulled out of the aether (yet she, a fan-favorite & main character, still has 0 character development??). The girls find out that the attacks were behind Carol's sister (not mentioned in the first game), & a screaming monkey boy, who were aiding the main villain of the story: Merga. While she was the most imposing thing in the game, and was able to be on a similar threat level as Brevon, her M.O. could've been better. Basically i kept waiting for her M.O to be more explained cuz i kept thinking ""Ok, i get why you're mad, but you're hung up on past bs"". She was really hardheaded about it all too. Like how is it that you're not willing to negotiate with people who've had 0 interaction with you? It could be racism and revenge for how she was literally engineered to be the ideal war machine, but even then she's shown to be very smart. Cerebral enough to be the mastermind of this major plan that involved the help of others, gathering needed components to operate a big azz, planet-destroying, dragon spacecraft. Given her backstory, she should've stopped what she was doing long ago. Sorta odd that we dont know if this whole plan or it's process took 3 years or a few months, but she can get alot done in a day, even within an hour. 
Anyways, without going through this beat by beat, once Merga is brought into the swing of things, you, the player, are safe with the thought of ""Ok we gotta beat down Merga"". ""Now is the story comprehensive?"" Well what saps the quality out of it is the lack of character development across the board, big stakes but little impact since SPOILER...NO ONE DIES. How do you have a really dangerous villain if everything's virtually the dam same from start to finish? Then you dont even do it well...CUZ THE STORY IS INCONCLUSIVE!! Do these guys know how unsatisfying that is? ALSO how're you gonna give us Serpentine...BUT ZERO FOR BREVON? DONUT! Then the girls were stupid for trusting him & not have someone like Neera constantly shadowing over him (the same girl that's THE skeptic one of her own group). Lemme just go into positives before I just end up dumping negatives. The ideas for the locales are there, and really fleshes out the world you're playing. Trying to prevent a volcano erupting, flying thru a planet-destroying 3D ship, traversing sky islands that have a beach-esque setting. Merga provides good M.Os for her subjects, be it money, fame or tech. She was also almost even Successful with her plan. Had she fired her laser a quarter closer, that moon would've been gone. I might've missed a detail on why she fired it at the moon, but i think she wanted to test it, which makes sense. They also give you lore dumps in the form of time capsules and a library section...Which yeah, would've been soooooo helpful for the frist game, cuz no one knew what to expect when picking the game up, so some actual establishments can occur, and an obvious way to go about that is with flashbacks. If there's a reason why they couldnt, i wouldnt know. 
To wrap this off...If telling instead of showing....If it isnt the story lacking closure....The lack of info on Lilac's parents....Or even Brevon's absense...Why is it that when you get all the time capsules...This Earth dragon girl is hosting most of them...And she has a RELATIONSHIP with MERGA?....AND IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE?!! This opens up a can of worms on it's own, but the biggest thing about this is that it's biased AF towards since she's also Magister's daughter, is in hiding....BUT the devs dont even commit to this??? Unheard of. Merga never mentions her, even tho she considers her as ""one of the good ones"" among her race, she sees her an afterthought or she flatout hates her relationship with her. If she really is in love with her...Uh...You wouldnt destroy the race of the one you're in love with. Also i thought she wanted revenge for her race. Is her love repressed or did she actually forget about her? Oh well, IT'S UNEXPLORED :D! Then Merga's helpers get off with months of community service.....FOR AIDING WORLD DESTRUCTION?? This major aspect of the game, which it even tries to focus on alot, just falls short in the grand scheme of things, to where it makes DBZ's story look good. The pacing is a bit fast too and leaves little air to breathe and process what's said. Since things didnt really conclude, even with the ""true ending"" (counter-intuitive much?), this leaves us with sequel material. Im not giving the next game's story my time unless im part of the writing staff. This was just so bumpy, especially for a game like this.

Gameplay:
Now then...Coming off of the muddiness and the filth that was plaguing the story, we have the strongest part of the game by leaps and bounds: The gameplay itself. Even if i still have some gripes here, everyone and their mama looked forward to the gameplay. We have a layered equipment system, with a potion system & two bonuses you can give yourself either oriented to crystals or something to just get you ahead. The Elemental Burst can really shave off some health and you can even heal when hits land. They even allow you to control a big mech bunny boss in the challenges. It's sick. I have better platforming with everyone else compared to Lilac but she's still worth mastering. Only things I hate are a few enemies, bosses, and stages. The game gives alot of opportunities to spend and gain currency this time. Thankfully the devs are constantly updating the game. The hidden stage can screw right off tho.

Music:
I feel like the previous game's OST is better, at least as far as instrumentation. This game still has some bangers that I cant wait to get back to. Still keeping some chinese tunes to the tracks.",1664125424,1665347817,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Gotta say that once you kinda know the layout of the levels and bosses, it gets a little better. But for a newcomer it's still confusing. Milla is obviously (again) the best original character, however it didn't save this game from my negative review :) Altough - maybe take it on discount?

As quite a fan of the first game, I was sort of looking forward to this one. While the game does deliver somewhat of an experience not different from the first game, it's overall less effective for various reasons.

First game featured small handful of levels with interesting biomes where each boss felt unique and thought through (some more than others, but still). This one offers you a s**tload of levels and about 40 bosses, where majority of them feel like a joke. Most of them only have three attacks and their animation is very static, it's clear devs love did not quite pour into these sprites. Same can be said about levels - they, unfortunately, follow same formula of the first game, which was already annoying, but they went bigger with this one, levels are larger and collectibles harder to find. There are also 40 of them, which makes biome specificity easier to overlook. They did have some interesting ideas, sure, but I found most of them annoying anyway and thats mostly due to inability to have the game zoomed out permanently, or at least, when you pick up speed. Its always just a blunt background and bunch of platforms. During the entire game not a one moment would come when I would think ""damn, now the background really blends well with the foreground"". It always seems like the background is there just so there isn't pitch black or something.

Introducing hub mechanics to game was totally unneccesary and cities where you would buy items as well as items themselves samewise. I literally finished half of the game using no items, because I didn't know it was there (i knew there were potions, but I was saving them for when they will be needed - turns out they act as items, you can use them indefinitelly once you buy them - who knew...?).

Photomode - wow, I mean... WOW. It must be first sidescrolling game where I've seen this feature. Saddest thing is that there is a visible amount of time that went into developing this... why? Why? It's not like this is a Horizon or God of War. The game doesn't look very good really, why would you put such thing in there?

Ok so now that I estabilished what game did wrong, lets talk about the good part. Animations of main characters. I liked how they expanded upon sprites for all main characters and also I appretiated slightly more detailed models with introduced shadows and such. New guard blocking system was definitelly a missing feature in the first game, so nice job here. Bosses also look less like gunstar heroes/sonic bosses, but they paid heavy price for having detailed but overall static models.

I have yet to finish game for other characters apart from Lilac, for which I unlocked everything that was unlockable in terms of collectibles and achievements including par times challenges and S rank in every level. I might change my mind, but right now - 7 years long work of a group of people seem like a lot for a result like this. Even if it was made by a single person over this span of time, I would still consider it a poor result. Other than that, fine addition to first game, except the first game was just better in terms of mechanics and redundant complexicity.",1664117231,1665486959,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

-The movement is immaculate, it flows insanely well, using most movement options allows you to glide and slide, keeping the momentum you've earned, redirecting and adding to it

-The level design has a beautiful, seemless flow, and they've solved the frustrations of 2d sonic games by making the game based on health rather than the danger being falling in frustrating random pits.  

-The combat system allows for creative combinations of moves depending on the situation, and all of them keep your movement flowing and feeling natural.  The combat feels built into the game, rather than tacked on, and works well with the boss section after every stage

While in the first game you would choose between Lilac and Carol (with Milla being a bonus character unlocked later on), here you have the option of the first three character plus Neera, one of the antagonists turned hero in this one.
Not only that but the moveset for all characters were overhauled and added to, giving you way more tools to glide, fight and explore the stages, both at your own pace and on breakneck speedrunning speeds.
The game plays really fluid and i had no problems at all on that department, the game does ask focus of the player and don't hold your hand at all in any way, if you don't up your own game, you gonna have trouble, even more so on bosses where they can very well drain your entire life bar in seconds if you don't focus.
There are some hiccups here and there but they in no way get in front of the fun so i would give it a 9/10.

Stage wise the game has more or less 30 stages i think, it's not a giant game, but it gives you enough content to deal with to not feel short, and that is not adding in the the campaigns of all 4 characters, since they all play different enough that you will have different problems to solve with each one. While i just finished the game i really want to get on the other characters to play through all the stages again from their perspectives, 10/10.

Music is a blast just like the first one, even more so in some places, it's as close to perfection as i think a human made work can be, props to the musicians and sound design guys, they did one hell of a job here! 10/10!

graphics are also amazing, everything is conveyed really well and danger is really easy to spot. Though the danger sign for projectiles outside of the screen does feel like a place holder and breaks alway from the game overall aesthetic, hope they fix that. 8/10.

Now, story... that's where i think this game kinda fails, HARD.
first, from a gameplay perspective, forcing people to play the game in story mode first before giving them the option to play classic mode (a mode more akin to old games where you just go from stage to stage without cutscenes or anything) is a step back from FP1, it reeks of writers throwing a hissy fit at the though that someone might not care about their work, and forcing them to it as an act of rebelion.
Now, if the story was at least on par with the first game, where it was not good, but did things interestingly enough, i think it would be ok to suffer through it once, but holy shit FP2 story drops the ball way too many times to be passable.
The main villain is a walking cliché of rebel without a cause and the writers trying to much at making you want to like her, most actions of Merga in the game comes off as a child throwing a tantrum, and basically boils down to ""bad people did bad things so i will destroy the world, even tho the bad people don't even exist anymore"".
Then you have the plot points that only serve to futher themselves instead of fleshing up the world, and to be honest, just feels like the writers are spending way too much time on twitter.
At no point in the first or second game we see any sign of slavery, yet somehow the story talk about it as if it was the most important part of the entire history of the world, the first game makes no distinction between dragon races, but now they have to because they need to push the story forward.
In the first game we had a completely ruthless warlord that would get things done and had no time for bullshit, here we have a child-like snowflake taking her problems on the rest of the world because it hurt her feefees.
And again, the story would have zero importance... IF they didn't held classic mode hostage so people would be forced to play through it.
Galaxy Trail dropped the ball HARD here, there are some funny conversations and cool secondary characters in it, so it's not all lost, but still a 4/10.

So yeah, gameplay, amazing, sound/music, amazing, graphics also amazing, if you can suffer through the garbage story, go for it, i hope they just give us the option to start on classic mode from the get go.
all in all, i will still give the game a 8/10, would be a 9/10 if it didn't had any story/if you're playing through classic mode.",1664087516,1664087516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Here are some basic problems:
1: The game is too darn long in the levels. Honestly, they should have split every level into two sections for ease of play. This is made worse by lazy level design in some cases. Not only did they reuse certain story moments involving villains from FP2, such as them appearing on the screens to alert their minions late game, but also various other bits. While there is definitely a ton of heart to it, the problem is that the former game also did these reused moments and their mechanics much better.

2: The OST. Too many reused tracks, which normally is not a problem because I like listening to remakes of classic tracks in a series as everyone knows how many Sega has reused. However, what crosses the line is that a couple tracks seem plagiarized. The latter of these was an issue that even showed up in the demo way back, and clearly they did not care to fix it.

3: Despite the gameplay generally being improved, they messed up by making the new dodge button mandatory. The fact is, the first game had issues because only Lilac was ever worth playing as, mostly because the others were a pain to play as. This was because Lilac was the only character who got enough iFrames out of her moves, specifically her dash attack, while the cat spent too much on their kick and the dog had less health and only that shield. In FP2, they added dodges, which grant you a blink of invulnerability to characters. Why is this bad? Because they also made it 100% necessary to use due to how certain boss fights work. What this means is that you have to dodge, and you have to learn to be good at it, despite it breaking the fun of the momentum in gameplay. If they just toned down some of the more insane boss attacks, then I could have gotten through without it, and honestly I hate this new mechanic as, again, it breaks the fun of the momentum and flow of a highly kinetic platformer game.

4: The story....
Here are the nitty gritty story sucking problems with as mild spoilers as I can:
Okay, so let's talk about the first Freedom Planet game. Why? Because believe me, this is very relevant, and retroactively I must give FP1 a bad review because of what was in FP2.... So, in FP1, there were two characters intended to be playable that were cut; Spade and Torque, of those, Spade has a very important story that was clearly cut in FP1, and I know this because I have played FP2 and there is tons of backstory relevant to the character that would have really been important to him in 2. So, why the cut of this promised character? Well, I personally theorize the main dev of these games suffers from extreme selfhatred, which would not be an issue except that he/she clearly has other related issues often associated with selfhatred and suicide which I will not address here because IRL drama, which normally would not be relevant except it impacts writing and game variety. I wish them well, but honestly they are clearly psychologically unhealthy and I fear them projecting is partially responsible for the bad writing in FP2. In the case of variety, both cut characters from FP1 were male, and in the case of FP2..... 

....yeah, there is another case of ""lipstick lesbian couple"" afoot in this game. It's just bad. It is not simply that it is cliche, but in all honestly, it's a bad cliche when done bad. This type of crap writing is why Dragon Prince season 3 was so bad, although admittedly that case was much worse than this one, until you get to the ""relevant history of racism"" subplot, because of course this game pulls that dumpster of a plot point out. The fact is, this alone does not make a bad story, but the way it is told is terrible. I enjoyed the way Star Versus the Forces of Evil handled this story concept, even if that cartoon was flawed about it, but FP2 fumbles the ball down the stairs and it hits every step on the way down to the ground floor. Of course, explaining this requires spoiling things, so I won't, but let's just say ""and nothing of value was learned and everyone got off scot free because hate crimes from generations ago that nobody in the current day was involved with"" sorta bullcrap happens. It's trite hacky writing. ""Character X burnt a whole forest down after the kidnap scenario, and yep because some of my ancestors were bad, your war crimes are nothing so you get a couple months of community service"". I was the guy calling bullcrap when Orochimaru survived he end of Naruto and did not get blown up for his Doctor Mengele level evil, so seriously don't handwave this stuff with ""oh, but they meant well when they did evil, so it does not count""; trust me, when you kidnap people who have no involvement with the situation, it ain't meaning well, and this happened in FP2. You could have skipped this awful story, but the casual mode is unlocked after the game ends.

Funny little detail about the ""Battlesphere"" area of the game. The things you unlock in that arena, at first I thought they were going to be neat accessories like those you find in shops. NOPE. They are the items that unlock the holorecords to the dang backstory involving the lesbian couple. Because, OF COURSE THEY GODDAMNED ARE! Imagine saying ""yeah, work hard for that unlock"", only to unlock a heaping pile of crap. At least the turd quest from Breath of the Wild was not trying to pander towards me.

This is supposed to be a game about a goddamned purple dragon speeding around and fighting robots; what the heck is wrong with you people?! Just let it be that, or make the writing not bad cliches of current day writing! I can read preachy writing and not have a problem, even if I disagree with it, if the writing does not suck, case in point all of my favorite RPGs which are filled to the brim with Japanese environmental messages and really oddball treatises on religious views both local and foreign to me; those RPGs actually conveyed these issues well, but FP2's writing is weak and seems only to suit the fetishes of the people who made it. Heck, I have even loved games with LGB characters and couple in them, including Undertale, which was amazing, and the reason that game's lesbian couple is not hated is because it meshes well with the absurd nature of that story, which also included a Tsundere Airplane, but also did not break the flow of the game. 

Also, just FYI, there are many people who would have not purchased this product if they knew the entire game's story was going to hinge and center around one lesbian couple in it. Like it or not, people have beliefs on that issue, and they also like to make sure their kids don't buy things that have that content either. I will argue that this is not a deception by omission, as the game pretends to be child friendly, but engages in both pandering and terrible story writing that makes it all about people paying for crimes based on their racial ancestry and not whether they were involved in it.",1664078728,1702157680,False,10,0,0.41233450174331665,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Meanwhile, the awesome team at GalaxyTrail was cooking the second game of this young franchise. And after years of waiting (like, the game was announced in 2015), September 13, 2022 rolled around and the floodgates opened. Ladies and gentlemen - Freedom Planet 2.

And...with the nearly 11 hours (by the time I write this) invested and the Lilac story finished (complete with all time capsules. Trust me, you want to collect them!), I came to my conclusion rather quickly. FP2 is not just a sequel, no, it feels like an entire revival of the series. While the first game was more on the lines of a 2D quick paced Sonic like game, FP2 feels unique. There is right now no other indie game with that feeling. There's so much you can do - you can do challenges, you can just talk to NPCs, unlock neat Easter Eggs, on top of the core gameplay that remained mostly the same. And yet, it feels refined. You can fight the way you want, you can cyclone into enemies (which no longer uses energy), you can dragon boost into them - or just combine these to deal massive amounts of damage. And that is just Lilac's gameplay, as you can also play with series staples Carol and Milla, as well as the fourth playable character, Neera.

Story wise...oh boy. I don't want to spoiler anything, but Merga and the Bakunawa situation were perfectly set up and after the story is done, you are satisfied. There are even some questions you may have from FP1 that are answered in FP2. If you would force me to choose between FP1 and FP2's story, it'd be latter anytime. And Merga is a fantastic and understandable villain. But that, explore for yourselves. Even the length is perfect - with Lilac, I took around 9 hours to finish the game. If you want to go for all characters, expect around 35+ hours. Not even counting the challenges.

Ultimately, Freedom Planet 2 takes what made FP1 so cool and does it much better. I don't regret my Day One buy at all, as for me personally, this is the one of the best indie games that ever graced this platform. Absolute recommendation if you are a fan of 2D high speed adventures in the vein of the older Sonic games. And fans of the first game can get this one without doubt. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.

Freedom Planet 3, whenever it comes out, will also be a Day One buy. Because if I learned one thing with Freedom Planet 1 and 2, it's that GalaxyTrail know their stuff.",1664062751,1677534191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

 There is plenty of replayability, again more than any other games in the genre.

Fun levels, rich and colorful pixelart AND a great story!

But on a longer note, this is one of the best fast-pacing, action 2D games your money can buy. You have over 20 great levels. Some are fast-pasted, few are puzzle-oriented and they are greatly made. After that, you can spend your time to master these levels and get an S-rank if you dare, especially when it all compliments the four characters' abilities, Lilac, Carol, Milla and the new playable character, Neera Li. They all got their own stories to unfold on this adventure, (I do recommend playing as Lilac on your first playthrough just for the sake of the story).

You can also tell that GalaxyTrail got the experience on their belt when making this sequel. The pixelart for starters is amazing! So much so, you might get your eyes glued on it 0.0. Not just the levels, but even a handful of hub worlds you can explore. They are pretty distinctive too, depending on their themes and culture. You even get a whole lot of NPCs to talk to. Some have funny quirks, some are even making references you might or might not get. The whole world is just inspiring to see.

And then the story. I won't do a spoiler, but I will say it's consistently told and got a tone that is more balanced out. You got some villains that you gotta stop or else we are all doomed and all that jazz, but you might like them too just for their characteristics, and all this will also impact the characters you play as and the ones they are allies with. Still, gotta play the game for yourself to know what it's all about.

Sonic was honestly always held back by its desire to keep things simple, and a bit of level design and screen size, sonic mania showed what really good level design and even a slightly bigger screen can do for the game.  Freedom Planet 2's addition of a screen that can zoom out really highlights how nice more information is in these games, though it's unfortunate that the pixel count doesn't increase as the game zooms out, as it makes some sprites look a little wonkier, but it's not too bad.  The addition of attacks, guards and some special abilities makes their characters feel unique and increases the things a character can do, at the exchange of having to use more than one or two buttons.  

Playing as Lilac, you can use her Dragon Boost ability to speed up from a standstill, like sonic's spindash, but since it's assigned to a single button, seperate from the jump button, rather than a combination of down and the jump button you can use this ability much quicker, in addition in being able to do it while still in movement, even using it in the air and angling to fly through the air.  It results in a more flexible move, which will make obstacles easier to by pass, but,the move itself is insanely fun to use.  The invincibility on the move does have the potential to make it kinda OP, but the short cool down and direction lock on it is usually enough to keep you from spamming it and just never dying.

The other 3 characters all offer their own unique play styles, though I haven't played much of them.  A big portion of this review is coming from my experience with the previous game, and finding this game to be a big upgrade to what they did previously.

but for a more detailed review-
(at the time of the review, I only have completed lilac's story, plan to do the others soon)
First up, negatives. Weird start but its short so who cares-
The only true thing that id say could use a look outside of the odd glitch or two is specifically the world map. Now I like the idea of the map, making the world flow better and giving you a break in between stages and cutscenes. However later on, once I want to practice stages to get better the walking can get tedious. A quick solution would be a fast travel option through the details menu, where you could select a stage to automatically start.

Now onto the things that I dont exactly feel strongly about:
Story-
 all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, but honestly, Im no writer so I feel a  bit unqualified to give a detailed critique here

Music-
 Now part of this is the hype I had going into the game and honestly, I think the music will grow on me over time. But as of writing, I feel the first game had a slight edge in the soundtrack department

And now the positives-
Level Design-
 Holy mother of something this is good level design. Each level sticks out in a way, and none of the level mechanics are quite what I'd call ""gimmicks"" as they are fleshed out enough within the level to make it feel right. As well, the level design quite encourages exploration, which is always fun in these 2d games that give you great movement options. The amount of goodies scattered around is insane and I love searching each nook and cranny of a level and getting rewarded for it.

Physics-
 Now most of the time its not worth mentioning, but since the game focuses on speed, it is worth mentioning that the momentum feels great, but still feels very controllable. As well, gaining speed is easy to do, but keeping top speed is difficult, and the physics play into this with how everything just feels. Just feels right, yknow?

Combat-
 Now the first game has some issues with combat imo, with some enemies just feeling far too bulky, especially in the endgame. It didnt help that bosses did not have health bars so it was totally up to you to track it. Now with healthbars for bosses and enemies feeling less tanky (or your attacks dealing more, idk it has the same effect in the end), combat feels satisfying enough to learn and try to get better at, especially since bosses are almost always vulnerable to attacks meaning you can really shred them if you know how to. And finally some attacks have utility during platforming which always helps things feel cohesive.

NPC dialogue- 
the game made me spit out my drink laughing. Don't know if that means my humor is just bad or if the dialogue is good but I frankly do not care. 

Art-
Every single sprite is super detailed and looks great. Special shoutouts to the bosses being made of multiple stitched together parts by how it looks, letting the bosses feel alive, and letting them do expressive movements with them.

If you liked the first game, you will probably like the second game is all I have to finish this review",1663980204,1663980204,True,1,0,0.515177071094512939,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I can safely say it was worth the wait.

In a nutshell, everything that the first game did really well, the sequel does even better. Gameplay and level design is even more interesting and fast-paced, the characters feel even better to play as (though I've only completed the game as Lilac but, whatever), the story is more in-depth and the art style looks even nicer. Presentation-wise, if Sonic Mania felt like a long lost Sonic game on the Saturn, this game basically feels like a hidden gem platformer on the same system, to put it the best I can. There's a lot more detail in the pixel art between the character sprites, environments and backgrounds in a way that still stays true to the first game's general art style. I will say that I didn't quite like Lilac's redesign at first, but it's definitely grown on me.

The plot is also a lot more in-depth than the first game. FP1 was pretty good for what it needed to do, but it didn't really go very far with things like character development or lore, in which this game... well, it does a lot more of. Not going to spoil it for those who haven't played it, but it adds a lot of worldbuilding, lore and history to Avalice with events that unfold in a way that helps the characters feel more fleshed out. On top of that I feel like this game does a better job of incentivizing playing through the game multiple times with the different characters - which I already touched upon but with how some characters go in and out of the story it does make me want to replay the game to see how those events unfold (on top of seeing if there were any levels I might have missed by just playing as Lilac). Plus it also feels a lot better paced in which the first did have an issue of overly long cutscenes that... really didn't do much to further the story (to the point where some of the original cutscenes were trimmed in an update lol).

Gameplay-wise, there's a lot that Freedom Planet 2 does to build off and add depth to what the first game brought. The new potion and upgrade system is one thing which, while optional, does add a level of personalization to each person's playthrough and may offer extra assistance to those who need it or even offer extra challenge with some items that you can receive that limit your abilities, life or revivals - which also come with the benefit of extra bonus. That last point brings me to another thing - this game also adds a rank system similar to what the Sonic series has since Sonic Adventure 2, which further incentivizes repeat playthroughs to get the best rank in each level. Plus the lives/continue system isn't meaningless like it was in the first game - you are given continues but they come at a penalty of the amount of crystal shards you've collected, and when you die you're also given the option to continue right where you left off but with only 1 life petal, or continue from a checkpoint with a full life bar. You are given difficult options to choose from in the game's assist settings though in case you have trouble with the game.

The game's also much longer than the first - containing 24 levels and according to HowLongToBeat clocks in at around 10 hours for a normal playthrough (albeit my first playthrough as Lilac clocked in at almost 12) compared to 4.5 hours for the first game - more than double the length. And if you think the amount of levels might diminish the quality of each individual one, you'd be wrong. Each level feels extremely well designed around the smooth, fast-paced controls, and each of them stand out with their themes, gimmicks, tempo and challenge. The game further builds off the Sonic-y level design from the first game combined with some added depth to the combat system, and overall creative, fun levels that reward replayability through the game's rank system and general mastery of the game's mechanics and controls, plus a few alternate pathways here and there.

The only real negative I can think of is that I did experience a few bugs here and there - a couple of which that did require me to restart from the last checkpoint. First one was during the first Serpentine boss in which during the 'falling' section after the first phase I ended up somewhere offscreen and got stuck somewhere I couldn't recover my character from, and the second one I clipped into the floor when falling down after being blown upwards by a giant fan thing. Nothing too big of a deal, but did cause some slight annoyance. I guess also that some of the later levels went on for a bit too long but considering how much I enjoyed playing through the game it really didn't become much of an issue lol.

Truth be told this game might be my Game of the Year so far, and depending on how Sonic Frontiers turns out, may even hold onto that title. I pretty much had a good time throughout it - never really feeling tired or burned out - and I can definitely recommend it especially if you liked the first game.",1663979870,1663979870,True,7,0,0.570139229297637939,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I remember when I first played the original Freedom Planet way back in late 2015. I was bored one day on the weekend after school, and decided to give it a try. I was absolutely blown away, and loved every aspect of it! Even after dozens of game overs, I beat the entire game in one day! Something I can only do for very few games. Somehow, Freedom Planet spoke to me in a way that no other game at the time did. But things were about to get even more exciting! very soon after beating it, something big dropped on Youtube. The trailer for this very game: Freedom Planet 2!
This was the most excited I had ever been for an upcoming release EVER! Years passed, I grew up, went through phases, started jobs, ended jobs, survived a dreadful pandemic, started questioning my gender, but through that entire time, I never forgot about Freedom Planet 2.  

Eventually, in September of 2022, it finally released, and I was HYPED! I bought it ASAP, on itch.io for ten extra dollars! But you know how hype works. It gives us impossibly high standards, and inevitably leads to disappointment...
...At least for games that aren't Freedom Planet 2! Seriously! This is easily the shining example of how to do a sequel right! Every aspect about Freedom Planet 1 has been improved! The music, for instance, is much more diverse! I'll admit that it needed time to grow on me, but this is one absolutely phenomenal OST! Leilani Wilson (AKA 'Woofle') did an amazing job here, and you should check out her Bandcamp albums, and her Novel series 'Elancia Chronicles' (The protagonist from that series also has a fun little cameo appearance in FP2)
The voice acting here is also incredible! FP1 had some great acting that brought the cast of characters to life brilliantly, but this sequel saw a BIG improvement to the quality! Being recorded at Christopher Sabat's  (Voice of Kazuma Kuwabara from Yu Yu Hakusho, Vegeta from Dragonball, and probably a whole host of other anime tough-guys) Studio, the voice work is a whole lot more professional. Every line is delivered so perfectly, which is elevated by the more complex, mature story! The first game had the classic story of a rag-tag band of heroes uniting the nations to repel an evil alien warlord. Simple, but it's delivery was very ambitious and passionate! You can really see how much GalaxyTrail have grown since then, as Freedom Planet 2's story is much more mature and well realized! The antagonist of the game: Merga is a much more complex, and tragic character than Lord Brevon. The game has a much better balance between dramatic and light-hearted moments, a more fleshed-out cast of characters, more mature themes, and loads of lore delivered through the game's several hub-worlds. 
The art of FP2 is also simply magnificent! The resolution is very high for an indie pixel-art platformer, and they used this extra screen size to incredible effect, having vastly more detailed sprites than it's predecessor, while also being super expressive, fluid, and easily readable in the heat of the action! Big shout out to Tyson Tan who volunteered an incredible amount of work to give this game it's beautiful art-style!
And now the gameplay: 
Yeah, it's also a massive improvement! Every playable character has a much more balanced, and powerful arsenal of abilities, while all still having their own strengths and weaknesses. Milla and Carol especially have seen a drastic improvement to their move-sets! Carol now has a proper ranged attack, which doubles as a great & super satisfying movement option, while Milla's Phantom cubes are now spawned instantly, and she's also picked up some new Kung-Fu tricks! The newcomer to the game's playable cast: Neera Li is also an excellent addition, sacrificing easy movement abilities for rawr strength, and a wide variety of ways to bust your enemies up good! The levels have also seen an astonishing improvement in Quality, Quantity and Diversity! From the journey through Dragon valley, to the daring raid on Airship Sigwada, to the visceral carnage of Zulon Jungle & Naolo Lake, and the dark, ominous depths of Ancestral Forge. There is something here for everybody!
My favourite addition to the game is it's Hub worlds. Each one is packed full of so many unique, and colourful characters, who all have so much personality, and really bring the world of Avalice alive! Some of the game's best humour and lore comes from these NPCs! 

In conclusion, Freedom Planet 2 is an absolutely incredible hidden gem of a game that gets nowhere near as much discussion as it should, and you should definetely not miss it! I'm just as in love with this game that I'm playing as a proud 24 year-old lady as I was with the first game as an awkward 16 year old boy. This has to be one of the most ambitious, and beautifully executed games I have ever seen! No wonder it's among my all-time favourites. And I certainly don't expect any other games to surpass it any time soon (Unless GalaxyTrail blesses us with another sequel, that is...). Thank you Sabrina DiDuro, and your incredibly talented team for bringing this incredible game to life! Your games have made a huge impact on my life, and spoken to me in a special way that no other has! (By the way, Sabrina is now a V-tuber named 'Spacey Batotelli'. Be sure to drop in to her streams and say Hi). 

TL:DR
Freedom Planet 2 surpasses the first game in just about every aspect. It has loads of incredible content, and is sincerely one of the best platformers ever made! You can feel the development team's love and passion all throughout this game! Buy it! Play it! Love it! Now!",1663979410,1699784597,True,1,0,0.462962955236434937,0,False,False,False,True,,,

As much as I love the Freedom Planet universe, and with as far as I've gotten with the second game, I have a few problems to point out first.

The gameplay is alright. Doesn't change much than the first game, at least for Lilac and Milla. Having played the demo recently, Neera and Carol feel alright as well. Every character is enjoyable on their own. Only thing is, is that I just can't get through the game while forgetting to guard. I'm glad Auto-Guard is an option though... But I can never get used to doing it manually.

The problem mainly lies in the fact that the game no longer feels... fluid in it's progression. [SPOILERS AHEAD.]



The first game was simple: Get through a stage, get a few cutscenes showing the transition between one stage to the other, then progress.
Here... We have a lot to do to get from one stage to the other. The map feels disorienting, and it's annoying that you have to go by feet to a certain spot to advance the story. The world doesn't feel very organic this way.
[spoiler] Take Prince Dail's hallway to his throne... I am aware there is a shortcut to him underground, but it's neatly hidden, and I found it accidentally after speaking with him. [/spoiler]
Either way, the map and hub system doesn't stick to me well.

And if it isn't the map, the episode system is pretty slow. When I got to the first episode selection, I was somewhat fine with it. I get that all of them link back to each of [spoiler] Merga's peeps [/spoiler] but... when I got through it all up to the second episode selection... It quickly drove me away. I just don't like it. I know I'm gonna have to finish the game by forcing through all 3 of them though...

Aside from all this, this game is still very solid. The level design is very good, not as good as FP1, but still decent. Music bangs (but hits a bit less than FP1). Art direction is chef's kiss. I just wish they kept some ideas from the first game like the text font and textbox. It looked way nicer back then.

I guess I'm too much of a nostalgic person but FP1 stays my favorite of the two up to this day. I have yet to finish the game but, so far, this is my opinion.

So if you want to buy this game, go ahead. Playing the first game is essential to understanding this game's plot though. So get that controller workin!",1663966242,1663966242,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,False,True,False,True,,,

Saturday Morning Cartoon Writing. Topped off with a Killer Soundtrack.[/h1]

I'm prefixing this with the fact that I WILL be getting into Spoilers, nothing heavy like outright revealing something at the very end of the game, but I will be discussing parts of the story.

To start off with a generally good note.
The gameplay isn't terrible. There's some glitches, which definitely pulls me out of the experience if the glitches in question get intrusive.
But otherwise, aside from some general gripes I have with the gameplay, mostly with the overly robust combat options paired with momentum that feels slippery on occasion, I say the game plays alright.
Not great, not exactly good, but far from bad, and definitely not the worst it could be.
[b]EDIT[/b]: I believe some of the bugs I experienced could be fixed by now, I hope so anyways, I can't bring myself to play this game again.

Now, onto the big piece of this that caused me to really dislike this game.
The story.

Between the touchy subject matter it gets its hands on, and the characters it has at its disposal, the big story beats end up being horrendously cheesy, what with a reveal with Askal, and a story beat between Lilac Neera and Milla.
Askal's reveal as a villain was something I heard making the rounds literal years before release, which is just lovely considering it's an actual story beat that's meant to have impact.
As for the scene between three of the four main characters, I get a character being angry, really, I do, but does that scene have to have what's essentially a gun pointed at one of the characters?

And now, for the real part with the story that I personally feel is too much.
The Time Capsules, and the lore contained within.
Granted you care to try the Battlesphere, which is a side mode I believe you're encouraged to play, you get all but one of the Capsules for finishing select challenges.
Don't bother looking for them anywhere else say for the hub world of Parusa, because all of them are shoved off into Battlesphere Challenges as I mentioned.
They end up detailing what happened in the past, specifically with Princess Cordelia.
As great as this would be, if it was handled correctly, I feel like them ham-fisting in Colonialism, and dealing with the aftermath both of that, actual species genocide, the uprising from those affected by it, and what reads to me as racial tension masked through different species was handled very poorly, to the point that it comes off as Tone Deaf, or worse, Insensitive.

There is some genuinely nice things in the story, as well as things that made me feel a bit bad, for a good reason, like some lore reveals for a character and such.
The reveal for Milla's backstory, and Cory reasoning with Carol are two examples.
But the lore included in the Time Capsules, and the lore included after collecting all of them just ends up being like Cheetos, Dangerously Cheesy.

To cap that section off, I believe Creative Freedom is a thing, but Creative Freedom and Proper Execution need to go hand-and-hand to create a story that's both cohesive, and create a story that handles topics as sensitive as race relations in a way that ends up being respectful.

As for the other good thing with this game.
The soundtrack.
Now don't get me wrong here either, some tracks in here aren't exactly perfect, and some I won't see myself listening to regularly, if at all outside of the select times they appear in the game.
But the game's soundtrack, as a collective whole, is genuinely really, REALLY good.
By no means is the soundtrack enough to save the game's reputation for me, but the soundtrack itself takes the game from a tolerable experience, to one that I ended up enjoying on a few occasions, specifically with Robot Graveyard, Shade Armory, and Airship Sigwada.
The only thing of note that I have to mention, at all, is the fact that the soundtrack leaked actual years before the game properly released, which ended up making the game's soundtrack, for me, feel a tiny, tiny bit repetitive in some select points, (Specifically with the end-game level themes, and Magma Starscape.)
There's also the disappointment that some of the tracks that got distributed didn't change in the final, or got cut as a whole. Some of these tracks sounding genuinely good.
[b]EDIT[/b]: As ironic as this is, what with the soundtrack not being purchasable at the time of writing this, it's one of the few things tied to this game that I can actually come back to, as some select tracks are genuinely good. Ones to note are Cory's Theme, Shenlin Park, Ancestral Forge, and the removed track JC101A, as they're ones I keep coming back to.

Overall.
4/10, 5.5/10 for the soundtrack quality alone.
The gameplay is alright, passable at its worst and actual fun in some rare scenarios, the story and its subject matter are written and handled very poorly where it matters, and the soundtrack is a shining jewel that lifts the game up even if only slightly.

[hr][/hr]

For all that I disliked, there is a lot that I did enjoy.
The game feels [b]great[/b] to control and play; everything just feels so right when you do things, and it is fun to run around and attack and smash enemies. It is fun! But then a nasty bug might show up and ruin your day, getting you stuck in a wall and now you have to restart to the last checkpoint.
This game looks beautiful and has some absolutely brimming art. The scenery is pretty, characters and enemies alike are well-animated, and the ""segmented"" bosses are very impressive (major shoutout to Lemon Bread there especially) - everyone on the team did a great job on the project. However, there are moments - especially in the Shuigang hub - where things just look unfinished. NPCs missing shading, heavy sprite clash between the pixel art of Sabrina and Pixy versus TysonTan's binary art scenery, and some off-model art (Lilac's ""shocked"" portrait being the biggest offender). This game was in development for 7 years, and it's jarring as a result.
There is a lot of creativity brimming with each stage; every level looks and feels unique from one another. Some of my favorite levels were the ones where you had to slow down and either engage or do some puzzle work. Shade Armory and Lightning Tower are two notable highlights in the pool of stages I really enjoyed - more of those levels, please! Unfortunately, the better stages come later in the game with some of the downright weakest stages coming closer to the start of things. If you're willing to get through the less interesting levels (and deal with the story, more on that later) then you'll probably have fun with some of the more intense stages.

Alright. Now into the things I downright disliked.

Levels overstay their welcome. I think everyone who has gotten to Ancestral Forge knows about it taking 20 minutes or more to complete... But other levels in the game take upwards of 8 minutes, at which point you start to wonder when it's going to end. Sonic games had their levels split into 2 acts to break up the stages, and notably in later entries, allow the 2nd act to throw new things at you instead of continuing to be the same level for 10 minutes. People complained about Battle Glacier for this reason but it seems that stage length is being doubled down on here.

The writing is not good at all. The story's premise seems serviceable at first... Dragon warrior from the past that was sealed away is now free, and is out for the Magister's blood because of something that happened long ago... But then you get to the dialogue. Maybe it's because I just finished Xenoblade 3, but the dialogue gave me immense whiplash. Like, I'd compare some of this game's writing to the original ""Golden Alpaca"" scene from YIIK - going from absolutely serious to trying to shove in humor where there really, really ought to not be any. Characters ironically don't feel like themselves at moments. Simply put, it is not easy to get through.
The worst part of it all is that you cannot skip the story; you are forced to play through the Story Mode on your first playthrough, which seems like a complete backstep from FP1 allowing you to play Classic Mode from the start. Weirder still, you can skip the cutscenes... But can't cycle through text? I read far faster than I listen, and even in games where the text is being spoken to me, eventually I just want to read it. It's really annoying and it makes the dialogue issue worse when you aren't able to skip through the parts that dampen the experience without sacrificing the entire cutscene in return.

And the music... What happened here? Freedom Planet 1's OST is absolutely wonderful on the ears with music that gets your blood pumping and ready to roll - Sky Battalion, Thermal Base, Major Boss Theme... There is almost no bad music in the entirety of FP1.
I cannot remember a single song outside of Globe Opera 1 in this game. The music here is just not memorable in the slightest - I genuinely have tried to remember other tracks and I just cannot, only bits and pieces. The music in FP2 is not strong and I do not know if it's a mixing issue or the composing being weak. I know Woofle can do some amazing work, not even including FP1 but also her arrangements for Bunny Must Die! were strong as well. But then you get to tracks like ""Boss (Mega)"" that are just... not good.

But of course, I am just a dragon on the internet. Your opinion is your own, and mine is my own - just because I did not enjoy the game does not mean you will not. Again, this game does [i]not[/i] do everything wrong, and I will reiterate that this game is an argument for Steam adding an ""in the middle"" ranking for games. It is not so awful that I hate it, but it is not a game I would recommend.
If you're curious... Well, Steam has a 2-hour refund policy for a reason. Try it out. Maybe we'll get Spade DLC this time for real and it'll change my point of view.

This game.... is so freaking good it [i]is borderline unreal.[/i] It took 7 years to make, and it shows in just about every aspect of the game. Every. Single. Aspect. Sometimes, such a long dev cycle is a death sentence for a project, and this is THE POLAR OPPOSITE of the case here. I have 11 hours in and I'm not even 2/3 of the way through the first campaign, and have only done a few sidequests and battlesphere missions. THAT is how much content we have here. We have collectibles, a minigame zone in the battlesphere, the achievments.... $25 is a freaking steal for how much there is to do here.

I have not tried the new character Neera as of writing, but the three other characters are an absolute delight, not just in fun gameplay and mechanics, and character design, but in POLISH. The game feels as snappy and fluid as something like Rayman Legends.  While the game is fully its own thing, I've noticed several other elements that feel born from criticisms of the same sonic series it's inspired by as well as a bunch of other things. Too many reused levels? Each level is vibrantly crafted to a T and visually distinct; the pixel art feeling less like pixel art and more like the effort Studio MDHR put into Cuphead. Can't see where you're going when you go fast? The screen has an adjustable zoom. ""Souls"" -like difficulty getting jack.d off to no end? The Game has a casual mode to get you adjusted, as well as a slew of items and settings to truly make your play experience your own, with really the only penalty being fewer rewards at the end of a stage. Story too long, inconsistent and not engaging? The game is much more well-paced, with a MUCH stronger narrative which was confirmed to be inspired by Zootopia and Black Panther. In other words, it explores some darker themes but does not have something like the torture scene from the first game. Some Dialogue still feels off, but that is a nitpick. Even the hub worlds are small, compact, and [i]right to the point[/i].

Even if you are not a fan of 2D action platformers, I'm willing to bet you know someone who does, and I'll say it once I'll say it again - This game is a worthy inclusion to your library. To list negatives, sometimes the difficulty does not feel balanced, and the aforementioned dialogue feeling off, but really, THAT'S IT. 

There is no other way to say it. To Miss Diduro, the Galaxytrail team, and contributors like Christian Whitehead, Chris Sabat, and anyone else not mentioned, your game absolutely ROCKS.

2편까지 무려 7년을 기다렸다
발매 초기라 그런지 버그가 조금 보이지만 업데이트로 조금씩 패치해가는중..
게임성은 두말할 것 없고 영혼을 갈아넣은듯한 도트 그래픽과 BGM, 스토리 또한 좋았다 
보스 패턴 하나하나까지 공들인 흔적이 보인다.
기다림이 아깝지 않았다.

다만 결국 끝끝내 기간안에 못 맞췄는지 보스로 나왔을 예정으로 보이는 스페이드는 갤러리에 전시되는 것으로 마무리된듯 싶어 아쉬움이 남는다

At first, I thought Freedom Planet 1 was the better game, however, with more experience with this game, that was clearly wrong.  The only things I can say are better in the original are the level-to-level gameplay rather than a small hubworld, even though it doesn't really hurt the game, and theme song, which in my opinion is still better than this game's theme, but that is subjective.  In terms of story, this game takes what the first game did and amplifies it by adding more character drama, more intensity to the character interactions, and genuinely helping to make the villain more connected to the main characters, something that Brevon lacked.  In terms of gameplay, nothing bad to say, takes everything the original did and amplifies it ten fold.  The Sonic influence is still very much present in this game, even down to adding grinding as a mechanic, and I am truthfully a huge fan of this aspect of the game.  Sonic is my favorite franchise of all time, and to see those who understand the reasons why the classic 90s Sonic games' levels worked so well and apply them with a unique and fresh touch that not even Sonic Mania has.  Well Sonic Mania suffers from originality issues in terms of level themes, this game does not, which is awesome to see.  Bosses in this game are fun as well, retaining that classic sense of timing and waiting for an opening.  Music is fantastic, no complaints there.  Overall, this game takes everything that was fantastic about the first game and amplifies it.  The first game used to be my favorite indie game of all time, ever since I first played it 7 years ago, but now I am happy to say this game lived up to all of my expectations and is now my favorite indie game of all time.  I have huge nostalgia for this franchise and I really do hope GalaxyTrail continues with another sequel.  This game is not just a fantastic treat for Sonic fans, but fans of classic platformers as well.  Classic platformers in the vain of Sonic and Mario are my favorite genre and this game knocks it out of the park in that category.

First playthrough took about 9 hours, but I redid a few levels, finished the Battlesphere mode and just generally screwed around a bit. If you're just gunning it the entire time I would say a decent player would finish in 5-6 hours. I'll probably come back and rewrite this after I finish a playthrough with all 4 characters to see what's in store. You can also get a lot of replay value redoing levels to improve your time or get a better ranking if you're into that. Stages are typically under 10 minutes, so you can run through them multiple times pretty fast.

So yeah, if you're a fan of action-platformers, or if you're not and just looking for a good game to try out, definitely worth your time.",1663817724,1663821523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Now, eight years later, here's the sequel... and not only does it out-Sonic Sonic again, I'd go so far as to say it out-Treasures Treasure. This is hands down one of the most impressive platformers I've played in years. It looks and sounds gorgeous, it plays like a dream, its story is wonderfully deep, its mechanics are brilliant, its boss fights are spectacular, and its setpieces keep getting more and more hype, topping themselves with every new level.

This game is a huge work of passion and you can feel the effort coming from every little detail, to the gorgeous sprite work, the remarkably expansive level design and the great story told through the games main adventure mode.

I did definitely get my face beat in by several of the bosses on my first playthrough, and each time I got better- only to get floored by another tougher key boss fight later on in the game (before improving again), which if anything is a sign of a good difficulty curve considering I was constantly improving. But if the difficulty every gets too much at a particular point, there are good assist options in the menus such as infinite revivals (the ability to get up for free after losing a life) and more. To make sure you don't get stuck and unable to continue if platformers aren't your usual game genre.

Carol was played first
Milla second
Neera Li Third 
Lilac 4th

Will challenge the rest of the 17 achievements left (mostly speedruns and collectathons.) in which I will update this review.

At the time I would say this.

Its a decent game but it feels a little cut around the edges for some parts of the game especially art materials revealed in the past 7 years since the Freedom Planet 1 release (July 21st 2014). *A photo of Lilac's gang + Spade/Dail alongside Carozon Tea on a airship. Probably just for promotional sake to stir hype. Sadly the same event doesn't happen in the game.  

Majority of the music is solid for the most part but it does not leave much of an impact as the first game. Sadly only 7 stages has leitmotifs from the first game. While the Soundtrack is indeed weaker then the first game, it makes up for it with nearly 17 more songs of the song-list (FP1:72 tracks / FP2-89 tracks) from the first game which is quite nice.

Story Mode of Carol Tea is quite endearing but it leaves more to be desired with interactions to her and her sister. Only a few instances are just her meeting her sister and her sister just jets with a warning. I feel Corazon could've been made to be a more integral part of the game itself. But it be how it be I suppose. Not much of her past is revealed. Only references of her previous occupation before teaming with Lilac.

Milla the Hound while her past is mysterious since the first game being adopted to Carol and Lilacs' care, it comes to light in this game. Which I believe is to be the most impactful of all 4 Plots within Freedom Planet 2.

Story mode for Neera Li left more to be desired, hardly put nothing is revealed about her past, mostly a soldier through and through being quite focused and tempermental.

Lilac story basically gives more depth to what Lilacs' motives are especially with her kind. But it falls a bit short somewhat as it just makes her more of a worry-wort instead of the determined and focused character from the first game. Though it is questionable of the *Past* of Lilac of how she became to be considering how the ages are. 

The new antagonist while the initial reveal shows them to be capable, gets a bit lamp-shaded being behind the scenes for majority of the game until 3/4ths of the way through the campaign. Brevon from the first game had more of a existent threat than she was as he was making loud moves between the three kingdoms of Shang Tu, Shang Mu and Shuigang. Not until the reveal of the antagonist of the second game to the cast did it felt that the world was coming undone.

Strengths

4 different styles of play

A expansive world map that expands around world-building of planet Avalice.

Bigger soundtrack

Some characters backstory is revealed but not fully.

Weakness

Classic Mode locked after first completion of Adventure Mode which can be a bit of a slow-going but I'd feel after first playthrough Classic Mode would be a must to play for a streamlined exp. without the padding inbetween stages.

Soundtrack is less memorable than the first game with some tracks placed in, however there are quite a few bangers within the game.  

Game feels a bit straightforward this time around which is quite weird. After you play through the stages first time around or so, you start to feel that the stages are quite easy to memorize and quite very so you can breeze through them quickly as possible. (Even one of the achievements is to beat the game in under 4 hours time from total time of the stages.) Still, longer than the first game which *CAN* be completed in under a hour or two if focused.

Story seems a bit cut out. Some moments seems to be omitted out to make the game much more flow through. I prefer the first game story overall to be straight blunt with you. But personal preferences aside. Its serviceable somewhat.

You will notice that the further you get into the game, the more enemy spam placement there will be. In most cases they are merely hindrances that you can ignore (however upon defeating some enemies you get Energy Cores in which you can redeem for Gold Gems to unlock items/potions to enrich gameplay.)

Serpentine isn't a jobber anymore? Maybe? Maybe not? You decide.

The new characters (outside of Carol sister) are questionable at best for their purpose and being in the game. They feel out of place and out of sorts compared to the other cast. At least talking to some of the NPCs is quite nice for the first romp through the game however on subsequent playthroughs I just wanted to blitz through the game to complete it. Would be nice to implement some additional effects from chatting with the NPCs such as quests and what-nots. Mayhaps for future implementations there would be a reward to enhance the game with more content? Who knows.

For under $22 its a good game to get. $25+ unless it has further updates and DLC included within would be more appetizing. I feel the game is lacking quite a bit. Need more story implementations for the characters.

But I recommend it if Spark 3 being 3D isn't good for you. Then the old 2D-platforming Razzle Dazzle would be perfect for you.


*Update*
70 Hours upon completion and I got my time in the game 100% with every achievement managed to unlock.

My entire playthrough can be watched here. 13 Videos chronicled for the game. Mistakes were made, improvements were done, and shortcuts were taken. Regardless I had fun. Here's hoping you do the same if you purchase this title for its full amount that it is worth.

This is mostly a first impressions review, so I might change my recomendation depending on how I feel after finishing the game, if I even finish it.

First the good:
- The pixel art is gorgeous. Truly outstanding work and a huge improvement compared to the previous game. And the low-poly 3D models used are great as well.
- The music is equally good, really each track really fits the stage.
- The voice acting is miles better than the first game.
- Boss fights are really fun! The combat really works for that, except the guard timing being a bit too easy, but that's not a big deal.

But now here's the bad:
- The writing is still as bad as the fist game. It's like an early 90's Saturday morning cartoon, and not of the good ones. Wouldn't be a big deal if you could just play Classic mode from the start, but you have to do the story first.
- The platforming is... ok. I probably would have liked it more if this game came out shortly after the first one, but after playing Sonic Mania and even more recently playing Curse Crackers, the platforming isn't nearly as satisfying as those two other fast-paced platformers, or even the first Freedom Planet. It's hard to explain, but it doesn't really feel like any part of the stage really flows naturally into the next.
- While the combat really works for the bosses, I can't say the same about the levels. 99.9% of the time it's better to just ignore enemies instead of attacking them, and engaging them with melee attacks is just asking to get damaged since you can get stunlocked by their attacks but they barely flinch at yours. That stuff is not a problem during bosses, where you're in a confined arena and you can carefully dodge and learn the patters to know when to attack, but when you're speeding through a stage the enemies are nothing more than annoying stage hazards.
- Considering the speeds you go and how the levels are designed, the game is too zoomed in by default and even with the warning signs it's not uncommon to just run or fall into enemies before you have the time to react.

In short, it's decent, but not a worthy successor for the first game, I'd suggest to play that instead if you haven't.

But if you really want to play this game, I'd suggest editing your save file to play Classic mode from the start. I'm playing like that mostly because I just want to see all the bosses the game has to offer since so far it's the one part I found consistently fun.",1663774149,1663774149,False,7,0,0.483009070158004761,0,True,False,False,True,,,

[h1] Сложность [/h1] [hr][/hr]
Вы можете смело ставить хард, т.к. фактически это ни на что влияет, кроме прохождения самого первого уровня. Сложность в игре из разряда ""я сам себе придумываю проблемы и героически с ними борюсь"" и зависит от выбранных модификаторов, которые можно найти на уровнях или купить у торговцев за «золотые кристаллы» (их тоже можно найти в сундуках на уровнях или конвертировать у торговцев за синие кристаллы или металлолом) т.е. вы сами себе можете как облегчить жизнь, увеличить скорость, высоту прыжка, накрутить урон, превратить все кристаллы на уровне в лепестки с жизнями и так далее в том-же духе. Так наоборот - усложнить, сделать так что бы по вам проходил двойной урон, отключить блок, поставить тайм-лимит, отключить конты или превратить все капсулы с айтемами в бомбы.
[h1] Недочёты [/h1] [hr][/hr]
Да в игре встречаются мелкие баги, типа неверно отображающихся кнопок геймпада, так же персонаж пару раз застревал/проваливался в текстурах, но это так мелочи и они не сильно мешают прохождению.
А вот некий импутлаг мешает, причём случается так когда ты к примеру нажимаешь ""вправо/влево"" или ""блок"" и персонаж реагирует не сразу, а только со второго нажатия, не смотря на то что этот недочёт проявляется не так часто, зато в самый неподходящий момент, как говориться: «редко, но очень метко». Недаром разработчики в темпе выпустили патч улучшающий совместимость с игровыми контроллерами.

The story itself will build on a lot of the same characters you've seen before and introduce new ones who are equally intriguing and have a lot of personality. It answers a few questions while still keeping and introducing more.
And there's an emphasis on either plunging the levels' depths to get the most possible out of your run or going as fast as you can, to reach the end and to beat the bosses quickly. And hoo boy, they have a LOT of boss fights in this one, there's at least one per stage and the toughest encounters have their own stages so you won't have to worry about getting sent too far back for dying too much.

If it's the only few critiques I can give it's that changing the lives into ""stocks"" and not providing much opportunity to gain more outside of crystals, potions, and items can put a lot of pressure on the player to avoid restarting the stage once encountering the boss. There is an easy mode, but if that's for new players then they'll have to treat this game as a self-contained adventure rather than a continuation in the world of the previous one.
Speaking of the story, for as much as I like the foreshadowing and buildup to the reveal of Merga's plans, I do admit she feels like she gets left on the backburner of the first act a bit long.
But these aren't to any detriment of the game itself. If you want the challenge, it's there for you and it's welcomed with open arms.

All in all, 11/10 this is a Must-Buy for those that enjoy 2D Sonic and Freedom Planet 1 or other skill and speed-based platformer games as well as people who enjoy the art and style of many genesis classics, fantasy and space sci fi mixed together, and pretty pixel art.",1663734607,1663734607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

E mo' cos'è, vi chiederete?

Beh, molto semplice:
Freedom Planet 2 è il sequel di Freedom Planet, e segue le avventure di Lilac, Carol e Milla, più Neera, tre anni dopo gli eventi del primo gioco.
Da dove cominciare?

[h1] Quattro personaggi? Non male per iniziare il punto del Gameplay [/h1]
Il gameplay è simile al primo Freedom Planet, ma con cambiamenti.
In primis, il gioco ad alcuni punti chiederà quale punto della storia scegliere (e completate tutte e tre, si continua).
Secondo, sono i personaggi:

[b] Sash Lilac [/b]

Il gameplay di Lilac non è cambiato molto. Tuttavia, il dragon boost è cancellabile, il che apre nuove opportunità per combattere i nemici (ed anche per fare qualche manovre).

[b] Carol Tea [/b]

Carol ha ricevuto diversi cambiamenti. In primis, al posto del Wild Kick, ora Carol possiede un Jump Disc, che gli permette di andare in punti dove non ci sono muri. Il Jump Disc inoltre permetterà a Carol di conservare la sua motocicletta, così da poterla sfoderare in certe situazione dove è necessario.

[b] Milla Basset [/b]

Rispetto alle altre due eroine, Milla ha ricevuto cambiamenti utili. Non più si dovrà caricare per un Phantom Cube: ora Milla è capace di attacchi corpo a corpo, e sparare proiettili se si ha un phantom cube (che appare premendo il tasto per il ""Guard""). Inoltre, Milla ha ora due punti vita in più rispetto al gioco originale. 

[b] Neera Li [/b]

Ebbene sì: il miniboss del primo gioco è diventato un personaggio giocabile. Neera è leggermente più lenta rispetto al trio, ma fa danni abbastanza forti, e possiede un doppio salto. Oltre a ciò, difendersi permette a Neera di entrare in uno stato di Focus, il che aumenta la velocità dei suoi attacchi.

Tutti e quattro i personaggi di gioco possiedono inoltre la possibilità di alzare la guardia, in modo da poter parare, riflettere o schivare gli attacchi nemici (Milla genererà anche un Phantom Cube, Neera entrerà in stato di Focus, e Lilac farà un dash corto se la schivata ha successo)

[h1] Grafica e soundtrack di gioco... Tutto qui [/h1]

La grafica del gioco è migliorata un sacco, rispetto al primo Freedom Planet. Più dettagli e scenari migliorati. Inoltre la soundtrack del gioco è molto buona.

[h1] Momento Spoileroso [/h1]

Rispetto al primo gioco, gli eventi di questo gioco cambiano leggermente a seconda del personaggio scelto. Tuttavia, in sintesi, e qui spoiler pesanti:
[spoiler] Merga, il cattivo del gioco, vuole vendicare il genocidio che gli earth dragon hanno causato contro i water dragon; Aaa, Askal, Corazon Tea e Captain Kalaw lavorano per conto di Merga, per un motivo diverso tra loro (Aaa vuole amici, Askal vuole aiutare Merga per rimediare ai crimini commessi dagli earth dragon, Corazon vuole che Merga risparmi la vita di Carol, e Captain Kalaw vuole essere un vero eroe); Serpentine vuole che Milla tradisca i suoi amici, in quanto essa proviene dallo stesso pianeta di Brevon; e si scopre che Magister è un'earth dragon. [/spoiler]

[h1] Note Dolenti [/h1]

Il gioco ha qualche bug e glitch, e gli sviluppatori sono al corrente di ciò. Tuttavia, un fattore pesante, è il fatto che la modalità classica non è disponibile, fino a che non si completa la modalità avventura. Per molti non è un problema, ma per il resto che preferisce non sorbirsi la storia, è abbastanza significante.

[h1] è tempo di stampare la conclusione [/h1]

In conclusione: Freedom Planet 2 è un buon gioco. Abbastanza solido, ma buono comunque. Consiglio anche il primo gioco, per capire meglio alcuni punti.",1663728577,1688425341,True,2,0,0.539170503616333008,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The amount of interaction with the story telling in this game feels very accomplishing to read through in the tidbits of character interaction in the hubs, and world environment props (like books).

This really takes the concept of the original game and ramps it up by a hundred times. With a good mixture of stages ranging from fast-paced ones to more a bit puzzle oriented. The combat also feels more fluid and satisfying compared to the first game, and the Guarding and Revive mechanics are much welcomed additions. The fact that you can change the item loadouts before every stage, and thus alter the difficulty level also makes things more flexible.

The visuals on this game are so beautiful, and there's so many attention of details I like (it's so nice that the game also has a Photo Mode for capturing those moments). That's some of the best looking pixel art I've seen for a while.
The soundtrack is so kickass, that it might even rival the original Freedom Planet at a times. The fans of the original game should recognize some of the familiar beats on some of the tracks. ;)

The Adventure Mode on this game feels much better than on the original game. The pacing has been improved vastly, and it definitely helps that there are Hub areas now, which the original Freedom Planet lacked due of the engine used for it being... not so good.
The Classic Mode is still there (which is unlocked by clearing the game for the first time), but for me it kinda feels more negligible than in the first FP, due of how much improved the Adventure Mode is in this game. But it's still there in case you wanna speedrun through the game or something.

The story feels more serious this time, given that there's been more than one writer this time around. The voice acting also sounds more clearer, although I did notice certain voice clips being more lower in volume, but other than that it's pretty good.
It was also nice to see that the charm from the first game carried over to this, and that there's been certain scenes which just made me smile - and even laugh sometimes. XD

This game also has been pretty stable (for me at least) since Day One. There are some minor bugs, but they don't hamper the whole experience much, and I'm pretty sure they'll be fixed over time - this game already received several patches in just one week.

Overall, this game is a real blast to play - the better sequel I could've ever asked for. Definitely worth the long wait, and just happened to become one of my all-time favorites.

If you'd like to play some fast-paced action platform goodness, then I'll definitely recommend this with a heartbeat. (As long as you don't have a furro phobia or something. XP)

I played through as Lilac, and the gameplay felt very familiar with improvements. Particularly, the added guard button and the ability to cancel Dragon Boost into an explosion just made my favorite character feel even better.

The soundtrack is again [b]full of fantastic music[/b], but unfortunately the boss tunes don't hit anywhere near as good as in the first game. They're either not as exciting or memorable, or they just don't manage to stand out amidst the noise of combat.

+Lot more stuff to do, such as the Battlesphere and purchasing items.

And a downgrade in others. Allow me to elaborate:
-A lot of the game makes callbacks to the first game, Freedom Planet 1. It's not detrimental to gameplay at all, but noticeable from even a casual glance during cutscenes and dialogue.
-Difficulty spikes, the level where you [spoiler]first encounter Serpentine in this game[/spoiler] being a particularly bad offender. The enemies take ludicrous amounts of damage on Normal. The game is practically screaming at you to use the new parry/dodge system when this isn't normally the kind of game that has that and its predecessor didn't.
-The levels are longer. That's subjective, but some levels were simply wayyyyy too long. Cripes, one took me upwards of 20 minutes because I just kept getting lost!
-The items you can buy are uninteresting for the most part. Playing as Milla, the life-steal item is practically useless because her hardest hitting attacks are ranged or non-physical.
-The characters are fun, but often are written pretty wonkily. There's also a distinct disconnect between how some characters are described (*cough*Astal*cough*) and how they actually act. The character dialogue is fun but can sometimes fall flat. Milla's dialogue is the biggest offender. I get she's a young girl, but she is older now. She doesn't have to speak like a five-year old all the time now. And now you're saying she's some kind of science genius? Please. I approve her character growth but this dialogue is just way too childish.
-There's a hub now and that's great, but 99% of the NPCs don't offer much of value other than odd chatter. One may call it world building, but there should be some mechanics built in somewhere. Such as side quests or something. There's shops yeah, but you put a ""quick shop"" option up there to skip walking to the shopkeeper. Also kind of hard to tell who the shopkeepers even are.

-Distinct lack of character growth over the course of this game.

-The Story itself and how the characters act. Wow. Ok, that's really subjective, but let me explain. This game does a lot good in terms of story. Heck it doesn't even commit the cardinal sin of ""gameplay and story are segregated"". Seriously I absolutely LOVE how Freedom Planet 2 merges story and gameplay. Other characters helping you out in cutscenes? There's a good chance they show up in levels [spoiler] and some boss fights.[/spoiler] All the playable characters have aged several years and are a lot tougher, represented by expanded move pools compared to the first game. All that is awesome. 

This is the biggest critique I have of the game--plot holes and the characters sometimes act or talk like complete morons, and the general disconnect between the background fluff and what happens in game. Massive spoilers ahead. 

[spoiler] One of the earliest examples is Askal's betrayal. First impressions are key, and this guy acts aloof and kind of  a jerk to the player character when you first meet him. You can spar with him and optionally talk to him inside the tavern for some more fluff and it's still more aloof small talk. Askal joins you for one mission and a boss fight (where he doesn't really help, go figure) and then *gasp* he betrays the party! Oh no he was working for the villain this whole time! It's a shocking act of treachery.

Except....not really. Not been given much of a reason to care about Askal. Going by purely story-required material, he acts dismissive of the player character and distant and that's it. Neera Li speaks of Askal like he was everyone's FRIEND and a trusted ally but we're never shown that that was ever the case. We worked with him very sporadically and somehow he's our friend? Sorry, not buying it. When encountered as a boss later at the volcano and defeated, Askal accuses the playable character as being the ""bad guys"". Mind you, we are at the volcano TO STOP IT FROM ERUPTING AND DESTROYING A MAJOR CITY AND SAVE THE PEOPLE INSIDE IT. Very not bad-guy thing to do. Naturally, the person you are playing as never points this out. Milla sure didn't.

 That Askal is ok with blowing the moon up with Bakugawa until we beat the snot out of him makes it worse. To me, Askal was never a good guy or a good man torn between what he thinks is right and what is right. Waste of a character. And as for Corazon.....

And that's just one of the complaints I have about how the game is written. Don't even get me started on the whole Earth Dragon vs. Water Dragon thing. Make no mistake, I'm genuinely hype for the sequel hook.[/spoiler]

Sorry that got lengthy but felt it had to be said. Overall this game is great and a definite must for anyone who played the first game or wants to play a hearty side-scrolling platformer action game. And at its current price? A steal. An absolute steal. Bless GalaxyTrail for being so generous. I mean it.

The graphics look like a polished Sega Saturn game and to me it looks timeless and the boss fights just like the first game were pure adrenaline rush and make you learn their patterns  My flaws with the game would only have to be the later levels being a bit too long taking about 10-15 minutes to complete.

As an enthusiastic fan of platformers, given my gaming career began with Sonic 1, I have played many from various different subgenres in my time - all of the Sonics, more technical/precision based ones like The End is Nigh and Wings of Vi, and then I found a little game named Freedom Planet many years ago... and fell in love.

The first Freedom Planet was easily one of, if not the best platformer I've played. Out of so many. I adored that game, and couldn't wait for a sequel. Now, after many years, avidly looking for news of it, it finally emerged.

Is it a worthy sequel?

I would say that while Freedom Planet 1 felt like a new team finding its feet, Freedom Planet 2 is handled with a lot more confidence - storytelling is more streamlined and well-paced, with no very long cutscenes breaking the pacing, while simultaneously telling a surprisingly good story. It feels much wider in scale than the previous game, and makes you think of aspects to the world of Avalice that are not solely related to the current conflict (in comparison, in the first game, everything was against Brevon).

The music, unfortunately, I must say is not as good as the first - there are some standout tracks (first Dragon Valley is incredible), but overall I'd say they feel a bit more generic than before. The power of the first game was that each stage had separate music tracks, where the first part would establish some musical theme and the second would develop it - things like Aqua Tunnel, Relic Maze, and Jade Creek from the first game were incredibly beautiful and exciting tracks, and I still listen to them on a regular basis.

The game's level structure in the second one no longer has ""split acts"", and thus the music mostly remains constant throughout - still good to listen to, but I feel that levels generally don't have a distinct theme to them.

Gameplay-wise, it's like a smoother and more varied version of the first game. I've only played as Lilac so far, but the change they made to her Cyclone means she's considerably smoother to play. There was no level that frustrated me or that I felt was unfair, and all of the bosses felt good (even if there are some significant difficulty spikes, but only on really climactic bosses, so I thought this was fine - the first game also had big spikes on key bosses, and I think it elevates the moment). I've seen some people complain about the boss design, but I thought they were all fine on Lilac - the true final boss required me to exploit the invincibility of her Dragon Dash, but again - this is a design feature, and in the previous game using it was also baked into my strategy.

Overall, if you have any interest in platformers whatsoever, you should buy this game without a shadow of a doubt. It's a more mature story, with very likeable characters and fantastic platforming gameplay. The second-to-last boss (as in, non-True ending boss) may be one of the best fights I've seen in a platformer, period.

Tbh, I kind of have a love and hate relationship with this game, I think its a good game and definitely an improvement over FP1 but I changed my opinion drastically and I think FP games for the most part are good but have baffling flaws in terms of difficulty that doesn't come just from skill issues but technical and design issues. Resulting in a far more frustrating experience that demands way too much from you and throw crap at you like its no tomorrow, so for these reasons I can hardly recommend this game for those either unfamiliar with fp1 or simply can't get past the difficulty curve.


That was a similar case with me whose experience initially was, awful to say at least.
But I did play it more and more and that drastically improved.
Games usually become better with the second playthrough, games like megaman and bass are the ones that I usually thought were either meh or awful but with the second and then third playthrough, you get adjust to their design so its fine for the most part for you the experienced player, but for new comers to the game itself it would be a far more unpleasent experience despite having the accessability options which should not be used to cover up poor design choices.

The returning characters each got a rework to their moveset, for the better. Lilac only got minor additions, but Carol and Milla got substantial reworks which make them much more fun (Milla is a lot more aggressive, Carol has a more interesting special attack which also provides more moevment).

There's more bosses this time, and more variety to the bosses (lots of 1-on-1 duels with other human-sized characters, in addition to the giant robots with obvious weakpoints).

And hey, if that's not up your alley it's easy and quick enough to go straight to your objective and skip cutscenes if you're really itching to just scoot on through. Rather enjoying the fleshed-out world map as well; since the geography of Avalice was really only suggested in snippets in the first game (from what I remember, at least) it's nice to now see where everything is in relation to each other. And the music, not surprisingly, is wonderful. If the OST is released like the first game I'll be all over it!

aliás, NÃO tive problemas distinguindo o cenário do level que eu tô, então bjs!! e também não entendi como tem gente reclamando de níveis grandes sendo que no primeiro jogo lá pro final tinha fase que demorava 20min lolololol, (e MUITO MAIS se vc se perdesse nelas) mas ok! quanto a se perder nas fases... não sei se é um problema de verdade já que as poucas vezes que me perdi eu conseguia voltar pro caminho original em uns 30~40s, e depois quando fui nos níveis dnv pra tirar S não sofri com esse problema (sim eu falo sobre o fator replay depois)

a música do jogo é muito boa e é cheia de referências de músicas do primeiro jogo e acho k eles implementam elas de um jeito bom (e q faz sentido: um remix de sky batallion toca no mapa de shang tu e no primeiro jogo sky batallion é a fase q te leva pra shang tu, o tema do brevon toca de leve no level com um lixão cheio dos robôs dele, um pedaço do tema da thermal base toca em outra fase relacionada ao brevon etc)-- enfim assim como no primeiro jogo a música é boa.. não passam exatamente a MESMA vibe mas osh, não eh pq é diferente q é ruim -_-

quanto ao combate até agora só joguei com a Milla e não consigo ver motivo pra tentar usar o vortex dela, mas de resto ok
o jogo não é necessariamente fácil então não esperem sair rulando tirando nota alta na primeira jogatina (digo mais nos níveis finais)

vi gente reclamando de ter q ver a história do jogo antes de jogar o modo clássico tbm mas sobre isso não sei exatamente oq dizer..

o jogo tem QUATRO personagens, oq significa q ele espera q vc jogue ele mais de uma vez, tipo, umas 3... e isso eu assumo que COM A ESPERANÇA de q vc leve oq vc aprendeu da ultima gameplay pra próxima

I was 17, and hyped out of my mind, as I adored the first game.

I am 24 now, and so very glad this game lived up to the hype. An absolutely massive amount of stages, each different and distinct from the last. Tough as nails boss fights that made me tear my hair out in the best way. Better controls and combat. Banger music. Absolutely *gorgeous* pixel art, like goddamn. Really clever callbacks to the first game that show the impacts it had; without indulging in Sonic's brand of ""hey, remember this old game? Be nostalgic!"" I've only played as Lilac but am so excited to jump back in and do the rest of the girls' campaigns.

The story is a big step up from the first game too. I appreciate how it balances tone better, and how the presentation and voice acting is much improved. Galaxy Trail could've just lightened up on the plot, or made it just goofy and silly, but no. They kept it genuine and sincere, no fear of people screaming about the story being ""cringe"" for daring to actually tell a story that tries in a mascot platformer. Hell, in order to get the true ending you literally have to collect a bunch of lore time capsules. You can tell the story and hub worlds had a massive influence on the game, and I think you're robbing yourself of the full experience if you don't give the plot a chance at least once.

Also the villain is, I shit you not, basically lesbian water dragon Shadow The Hedgehog, which kinda rules.

Combat is engaging, although I don't feel very comfortable with the new dodge move it feels very strange for a platformer but it's something that doesn't feel mandatory at least.
The returning characters all have expanded plots which feels great though the game very visibly has a problem with juggling so many new antagonists. Askal and Kalaw especially. But Serpentine is great, Syntax is great, Merga is great and all the returning characters feel wonderful to play along with the new character Neera Li.

※ 스포일러가 될만한 사항은 가능한 배제하고 작성하였읍니다



장점

1. 전작에 비해 약 3배 이상 늘어난 컨텐츠
> 단순히 스테이지 갯수만 따져도 약 30개 정도로 전작에 비해 월등히 많아졌다
> 진행도에 따라 지금까지 격파한 보스의 구조, 디자인, 세부사항을 보면서 시각적 즐거움을 감상할 수 있는 박물관
> 특수 미션, 보스 재대결, 야구 미니게임 등 다양한 어트랙션을 경험해 볼 수 있는 스타디움
> 단순히 스테이지만 주파하던 전작에 비해서 즐길거리의 폭이 넓어졌다

2. 고전 2D 플랫포머를 기반으로 한 스테이지 기믹
> 소닉 더 헤지혹 시리즈에서 대표적으로 볼 수 있는 루프 기믹부터 클래식 소닉 팬이라면 '아, 이거!' 할만한 요소가 엄청 많다
> 또한, 소닉 더 헤지혹에서 볼 수 있었던 기믹 말고도 고전 2D 플랫포머라면 충분히 나올만한 요소는 알차게, 스테이지마다 테마에 알맞게 적재적소에 배치해 놓은 것이 보인다
> 그 악명 높은 '원통' 같은건 안 나오니 안심하세요

3. 수려한 도트 그래픽, UI와 그에 맞는 환상적인 BGM
> 배경, 플랫폼, 월드맵의 그래픽이 따로 놀지 않을 정도로 통일되어 있으면서 스테이지마다 고유의 분위기를 잘 살렸다
> 전작의 UI는 다소 난잡한 모습이었으나 이걸 완전히 갈아엎고 정말 깔끔하고, 중요한 사항은 명확하게 디자인 했다
> 개개인마다 평가는 다르겠지만 어느 하나 모날 정도로 수준 낮은 BGM은 없었던 것 같다



단점

1. 엔딩을 보기까지 거쳐야 할 난관이 많음
> 노멀 모드로 플레이 했으나 수십 번 재시도를 해야할 정도로 보스전이 어렵다
> 짜증나고, '무서울' 정도로 어렵다

2. 지원하는 언어가 영어만 존재
> 스토리의 범위가 넓어짐에 따라 한국인 입장에서는 어렵고 난해한 문장이 많아 스토리를 제대로 이해하기 힘들 수도 있다
> 추후 업데이트를 통해 지원 언어가 넓어졌으면 하는 바램이 있다

3. 전작에 비해 민감해진 피격 판정, 일부 스테이지의 구조가 복잡해 짜증을 유발할 수도 있음
> 플레이어블 캐릭터가 2등신에서 3등신으로 커짐에 따라 피격이 인정되는 범위가 넓어졌다
> 스테이지 중에서 물량 공세와 함께 일직선이 아닌 광활한 장소에서 길을 헤매게 되는 스테이지가 있어 애를 먹은 기억이 있다

4. 자잘한 버그
> 루프 기믹에서 캐릭터의 행동이 멈춰진다거나, 스테이지 클리어 후 맵의 경계를 벗어나 사망하게 되는 구간 등의 버그가 있다
> 심하게는 특정 인물과 대화했을 때 어떤 선택지를 고르면 게임 진행이 되지 않아 재시작해야 하는 버그도 겪었다



알아두면 유용한 사항

1. 포션은 소모품으로 착각하기 쉽지만 그렇지 않고, 포션마다 위 아래 키로 최대 5칸까지 넣을 분량을 조절할 수 있다
> 본인은 이 시스템을 모르고 있다가 진 최종보스를 클리어 하기 직전에 알게 되었다

2. S 랭크를 쉽게 받고자 한다면 No Revival(부활 없음) + Time Limit(시간 제한) 아이템을 장착하자
> 어떤 아이템 없이, 단 한 번이라도 대미지를 입게 되면 S 랭크를 달성할 수 없다
> 적당히 피해를 감수하며 빠르게, S 랭크로 클리어 하고 싶으면 위 조합을 사용하자
> No Revival(부활 없음) 대신 One Hit KO(일격 사망) 아이템을 넣는다면 S 랭크가 무지갯빛이 된다

The controls are tight, with an interesting and diverse move-set for each of the four playable characters. Thoughtful level design makes for a varied gameplay experience that never loses its lustre - and with the sheer size of this game, that is quite an achievement. The difficulty curve is a little smoother this time around, simply owing to that increased scope - later levels present a suitable challenge. At two junctions, the player is provided with multiple branching pathways to choose between, determining which levels they will tackle next. While all paths must be explored in time, this does help provide a visible structure to the game; meanwhile, the inclusion of an arena area with a wide selection of challenges ensures that the player is not bound to a single path of progression for most of the game's runtime. While many of the game's (over thirty!) boss encounters refuse to pull their punches, I never found myself stuck on any one boss for too long - echoing the first game, they remain a real highlight of 'Freedom Planet 2', providing a number of jaw-dropping moments of paired spectacle and peril.

The story has the same cosy nineties Saturday morning kids' TV vibe that the first game nailed, complete with the shockingly dark elements that characterised many examples of that genre. The hub areas are a sensible choice to help dispense with the long cut-scenes of the first game - here, players can more easily choose how much of the story they engage with. Some of these hub areas feel underutilised - while some offer secrets and mini-games, others are little more than vehicles for dialogue. The voice acting is, on the whole, enjoyable to listen to - it is clear that the cast are having a lot of fun with their roles. The dialogue is somewhat uneven, occasionally lapsing into clunky pop-culture references that suggest a lack of confidence in the franchise's own charms - at its best, however, it by turns warmly humorous, engagingly dramatic, and genuinely affecting. It is a pity that the tension only really starts to build towards the end of the first half of the game - the story might have benefited from a few more early hooks.

This is a beautiful game - it is often tempting to pause just to admire the backdrop of a stage, or to appreciate the fluidity of characters' idle animations. While all character sprites receive a greater level of detail this time around, some have changed significantly - Lilac in particular has received a notable makeover, and while others have debated the relative merits of her old and new sprites, I did not find that such changes distracted from gameplay. Perhaps the most impressive graphical assets belong to the game's bosses, each of which is intricately created out of sets of moving parts that are fittingly displayed in a gallery in one of the hub areas. Sound design greatly enhances the game's aesthetic pleasures - well-chosen crashes, splashes, buzzes and booms help make each level feel more concrete. The soundtrack is huge and wide-ranging, although its forays between disparate musical genres never lose it its coherence. You'll encounter several remixes of tracks from the first game, each of which manages to innovate and build upon its parent track; meanwhile, there is a lot to like among the wholly new musical content - I look forward to listening to the soundtrack a decent amount in the coming weeks.

Overall, 'Freedom Planet 2' stands as an impressive achievement, a sequel that outshines its rightly celebrated predecessor. While occasionally frustrating, it is perpetually enjoyable, with strong replay value and deft game design that leaves it practically unmatched among high-speed platformers.",1663509473,1663509473,True,5,0,0.516472995281219482,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Only major complaints I have is that the physics are still kind of jank, best way I can describe it is unnecessarily sticky and could benefit from a bigger focus on momentum, but what we have isn't bad, shame the rail sections ain't faster though.
Bosses aswell have some camera issues I find, they're fun but some of them could really benefit from having the camera zoomed out way more.

Besides that, it is just a joy to go as fast as possible, finding new ways to cut off seconds and get better and better at mastering each stage, it's exactly why I loved the original and why I loved this game.

Really hoping we get DLC or a third entry.

I'm a huge fan of the original Freedom Planet, I might not have a ton of hours logged into it on Steam, but on Switch I've played it more. I truly believe this was worth the wait, granted the wait was agonizing, I can't remember the last time I waited almost 10 years for a game and walked away satisfied after playing it. It is clear that there was effort here to make Freedom Planet something other than a Sonic homage; in fact I learned the hard way that you shouldn't be rushing through these stages, take your time and explore. 

What I truly think gives this game replay value is the stage gimmicks, I say gimmicks in the best way possible since most levels bring some platforming twist to the table, I won't spoil them, but it is satisfying to memorize a level layout and flawlessly reach the end of the stage. Lives are contained to their level and acquiring an extra life isn't as easy like the first game, lives only exist so you can chase those perfect rankings.

In the original game if you timed your dragon boost, you could cheese the game; I'm happy to say those moments aren't in this game as much, bosses screen filling attack patterns punishes reckless play. I know I might be made fun of for saying this, I find some of these bosses harder than Hollow Knight's Galaxy Trail really went above and beyond with the challenging boss fights. 

If there are some negatives I can list, I'm adjusting to navigating the map, I would have preferred a linear point A to point B like the original; but then you wouldn't see these amazing hub worlds that are do detailed I end up hanging out in them anyways( preference I guess). I find healing items a little unnecessary, I believe you should fail to master the game; I welcome the items that handicap the player for extra bonus points. 

Lastly the pixel work is breathtaking, I would say the 8 year development cycle has paid off. I've been tired of indie pixel games for a long time, I can make an exception in this case since this might be the best sprite work I've seen in a side scroller; it really shows the jump from the original game which used multimedia fusion and this game uses Unity. What really impresses me more than character animations are the background HD sprites, it truly feels like Avalice is a living breathing world. 

I'm currently on my default Lilac run, I'm itching to get to Milla since she is my favorite character and it looks like she's received the most improvements as a fighter.

I would highly recommend this game, it is currently in my game of the year list alongside Bayonetta 3.",1663472442,1663472609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Freedom Planet 2 es la secuela del primer Freedom Planet, para aquellos que no la conocen, es un plataformero que combina velocidad y beat em up. Puedes manejar a tres protagonistas mujeres que tienen diferentes habilidades (Lilac, Carol y Milla) más un nuevo agregado para esta secuela que sería Neera, que a su vez también varian los niveles que vas jugando con ellas y el modo historia también. Esta secuela ofrece una historia más larga que la anterior con recorridos que te harán jugar los niveles varias veces. También tienes la posibilidad de comprar ítems para darle una mejor performance a tu jugada. Además de una galería bastante extensa para completar que te hará rejugarlo varias veces. Tiene gráficos en pixel art estilo retro, con animaciones bastante fluidas, diseños del artista Tyson Tan (también promotor del software de pintura libre Krita) y una actuación de voces bastante buena. En mi opinión personal siento que la música me gustó más en el anterior, y algunos enemigos son bastante adorables cuando se suponen que deberían ser intimidantes (nota Tyson Tan es uno de mis artistas favoritos asi que no lo culpo por esto, solo mi perspectiva personal en la estética), al conectar el joystick se juega bien, pero requiere un poco configurarlo porque el menú pausa lo manejo desde el teclado y el botón saltar está hacia un costado en vez de ser el botón de abajo, pero es totalmente configurable y solo una preferencia mía. Otra desventaja que tiene es que de momentos no está disponible en español, pero supongo que pagar traductores ahora mismo alargaría los costos del juego. Déjalo en pantalla completa porque a modo ventana tiene un glitch donde cambia de tamaño seguido. En resumen es una digna secuela del anterior que vale la pena seas fan o no del título.

Pros
Alright Music(I like some tracks)
Alright controls
The writing can be funny...occasionally 
It's pretty long(which is good if you somehow like the level design)

Cons:
-Story is nothing to write home about, and the characters are pretty annoying most of the time. Apparently if you want to play the classic mode(which skips all the cutscenes and hub world crap) you have to beat the game first...soo
-While the game is LONG for a platformer, it is BLOATED. The vast vast majority of the levels are all tedious slogs with set pieces and ideas that seem like they should be in one of the Klonoa gba games instead of a sonic inspired action plat. Like there's one stage where you move fish keys around to altars that cause various effects (changing gravity, raising water level, cooling lava). It's like I could imagine it being fine in Klonoa GBA since that game has small sectioned rooms (and better control...), but in these huge nothing burger snail maze type levels you just get lost. No clue why the devs made levels with no flow in a SONIC INSPIRED game.
-Bosses are...not great, there's a block button now which is nice but the boss design and the combat is just not satisfying. You could write a whole essay on why the camera is wack in some fights or why the combat is unsatisfying or why the boss movesets are weak and then make comparisons to other action plat boss fights like say Mega Man's but i'm not in the mood for that

As someone who not only enjoyed the first Freedom Planet game, but also gave it a [b] 10/10 [/b] and considered it one of the BEST 2D Platforming games EVER, I was ""beyond hyped"" going into Freedom Planet 2 and had such high expectations for this sequel to be as good (if not BETTER) than the first game, but unfortunately, it truly saddens me to say that this sequel, in my opinion, is [b] inferior [/b] compared to the first game in almost every way possible. The following points lists my main issues with this sequel:

[b] 1) New re-designs are NOT good: [/b] This is especially true for [b] Lilac [/b] who had such a GREAT design in first Freedom Planet (she truly looked like a character from the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" universe), but in this sequel her re-design looks [b] so generic/weird [/b] and uninspiring whatsoever. What's worse is that another character, [b] Spade, [/b] who was my FAVORITE character in the first game both for his design and his ""Shadow the Hedgehog-like"" edgy personality, was COMPLETELY RUINED in this sequel with an AWFUL new re-design AND attitude that made him SO BORING that I lost all the love I had for him from the first game (I'm truly baffled by the developer's decision to change/ruin the cool personality that Spade had in the first game rather than building upon it).

[b] 2) General art direction in this game NOT as good: [/b] Much like the 1st point, the graphical look of this game as a whole is not as good as the original game which had WAY BETTER-LOOKING stages/backgrounds than this game. As a result, the stages looked (and felt) bland and weren't as memorable to me as the stages from the first game (the ""16-bit"" look of the first game was magnificent IMO).

[b] 3) Zone Music: [/b] With maybe 2-3 music exceptions, the zones music in this game as a whole weren't memorable at all and most of them were ""all over the place"" in terms of how they play and none of them felt ""catchy"" at all. In fact, some of the remixes (e.g. Dragon Valley) were COMPLETELY RUINED in this game and nowhere near as good as they were in the first game.

[b] 4) Boss Music: [/b] THIS point right here is, by far, the [b] most disappointing [/b] part of this game for me personally. You see, I'm someone who always looks forward to boss battles not just for the fight itself but also the BOSS MUSIC that makes those moments so INTENSE/EPIC/MEMORABLE. And so, whereas the first Freedom Planet game which had EPIC boss music that [b] popped-up, [/b] were [b] very fast-paced/intense [/b] and gave you a sense of [b] hype/excitement [/b] as they play (""Prince Dail's"" boss theme from the first game was in my ""Top 15 all time favorite boss themes"" too), the majority of the boss themes in Freedom Planet 2 however sounded [b] very subtle/soft/low-key, dead and did NOT give those hype/excitement/sense of threat vibes [/b] that you would expect in a boss battle and sounded more like ""regular zone themes"" than anything else. I am still beyond shocked at how the developer ""okay-ed"" these GARBAGE boss themes/remixes that were absolutely NOTHING in comparison to the AWESOME boss themes from the first game. (My rating for the boss themes alone in this sequel is [b] 0/10 [/b], sorry to say)

[b] 5) Longer stages + No in-stage map: [/b] While having longer stages (compared to the 1st game) may sound like a good thing at first, the stages in this sequel are SO LONG that it feels [b] tedious to go back to again, [/b] especially if you want to achieve a better stage completion rating or find hidden chests that you missed. It's even worse that there isn't an ""in-stage map"" and thus trying to find hidden chests in stages that take [b] +15 minutes [/b] to complete is just HORRENDOUS and very de-motivating to do honestly.

[b] 6) No accumulated lives: [/b] While I never got a ""Game Over"" in this game, the fact that the lives counter RESITS every stage to ""2 lives"" and does NOT accumulate like in the first game felt like an unnecessary [b] punishment [/b] to the player and many times I felt [b] pressured to play very safe/defensive (especially against bosses) [/b] so that I don't get a Game Over. I really think this was a BAD DECISION on the developer's side and feel that this should have been kept as a ""Hard difficulty-only"" feature (I played on ""Normal"" difficulty for the record). Additionally, I did NOT use those ""helping items"" that you can equip before entering a stage because it felt like a ""cheap"" way to make the level easier and I didn't want to feel ""forced"" to use them just because of this ""always 2 lives starting"" system. (And no, I never used that ""instant revive"" option when you die because that too felt like a ""cheap"" way to finish a level and so I always preferred to restart from the ""last checkpoint"" instead)

[b] 7) Hub zones are annoying: [/b] Unlike the first game (which DIRECTLY took you to where you are supposed to go next), the so called ""Hub"" zones in this game felt like a CHORE to explore to progress the story. I didn't care about the characters there who provided USELESS text and the shops in there were also useless because I had no intention of using any of those items in-stage.

[b] 8) Not knowing where to go next: [/b] There were many instances where I honestly did NOT know where to go next in order to progress the story. For example, after beating ""Merga"" the first time, not only did that battle end very awkwardly (i.e. without any subsequent cutscene to explain post-battle events), but also the game did NOT tell me where I'm supposed to go to next and there wasn't even an ""!"" mark to highlight the place where I was supposed to go to next. Needless to say, I much prefer the ""directly taken to the next area"" approach the first game had than this game's ""hub approach"" IMO.

[b] 9) Merging Guard + Dash buttons: [/b] Many times I ended-up taking unnecessary damage (especially against bosses) because the ""regular guard"" and ""dash"" buttons were merged, which led to many instances where my character ""dashed into an enemy/projectile"" even though I did NOT intend for them to perform a ""dash"" command. The solution to this is to simply [b] split the regular guard button and dash button into separate buttons [/b] through a future patch and that should significantly help in reducing unintended character inputs.

[b] 10) Main villain was boring: [/b] Initially, when I saw the animated short video for this sequel when it was announced, I had high hopes for the main villain of this game, but sadly I was so underwhelmed by the main villain who was very uninspiring, all talk and nowhere near as VICIOUS/MENACING as the AWESOME [b] ""Lord Brevon"" [/b] from the first game. I couldn't take the main villain seriously and was bored every time she appeared throughout this game (even the final boss battle was ""meh"" at best IMO).

[h1] Final Ratings: [/h1]

[b] Freedom Planet 1: [/b] A [b] 10/10 masterpiece [/b] that was a blast to play and had awesome character designs/personalities, story, stages, visuals and ESPECIALLY boss battles/music, all of which should've been preserved going into the sequel.

[b] Freedom Planet 2: [/b] A [b] 6/10 underwhelming game [/b] that opted to ""try something new"" rather than build upon the strengths it had established from its predecessor and thus resulting in a sequel that fell short in almost all comparable areas and was nowhere near as memorable (or worth re-playing) as the first game in the franchise.

P.S: When the development for the inevitable [b] Freedom Planet 3 [/b] begins, I hope the developer goes back to their roots and takes inspiration from the [b] original Freedom Planet [/b] in making the next entry in franchise and focuses on what made the 1st Freedom Planet game so awesome while developing the next game, in particular the [b] INTENSE/FAST-PACE BOSS MUSIC [/b] that made the boss fights in the first game (especially the [b] Prince Dail fights) [/b] so epic/memorable.",1663437100,1663520479,False,8,1,0.426488250494003296,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Yes I know its a negative review but that will be explained later.

Freedom Planet 2 was a game I was waiting to play for several years after I played and enjoyed the hell out of Freedom Planet. While I enjoyed this game, I feel like it completely failed to live up to its predecessor's legacy. 

Pros:
-The platforming is really good. The momentum, speed and physics are very fun and it feels/plays similar to the original game which is great. I was very glad it was like this for this game.
-The updated sprites look really good, lots of characters got huge visual upgrades and the backgrounds within the game look great.
-The hub worlds which I thought would be pretty bad addition to this game, were surprisingly nice to have. They felt like needed breaks in-between the story and game play.
-Character interactions were great, there was a lot of comedy that got me laughing (especially mayor zao, phenomenal job on his part).

Cons:
This is going to be a long one, I really wish I had less complaints with these games
-Combat. I didn't like how this game wanted to become more of an action platformer. In the original, bosses took damage when you hit their weakpoint. In this game you have to hit the weakpoint multiple times just to remove one bar of health (I beat the game with lilac so it might be easier with other characters). I think adding hp bars to the bosses was dumb as it felt more annoying to deal with bosses compared to its predecessor. It also makes me feel as if I'm playing a megaman zero or megaman x game instead of something like sonic. I understand why they did it as they wanted to move the series away from being a sonic clone, but I believe they perfected it in the original. 
-Backgrounds. While I do love the backgrounds, it really makes it hard to tell what I can and cannot jump on and this has lead me to die several times within the game.
-Sprites. The only sprite change that I didn't like was Lilac's. I was always a fan of her original design, other than that everyone else's sprites are very good.
-Story. While I don't think the story is too bad or too good, there definitely felt like various moments were shoehorned in to add more of a dramatic tone shift. That mixed with the limited sprites for the characters made some of those moments feel awkward or failed to get my attention.
-Guarding. Guarding is super awkward to the point where I don't know if I'm actually guarding properly or it just doesn't work because I still end up taking damage.
-Level design. While some of the levels in the design are really fun to play through, a lot of levels later on feel really poorly designed. The puzzle levels were obviously very annoying because they're puzzles. There were times where I would get hit by projectiles that were off screen or I was completely unable to dodge an enemies attack at all because I was simply unable to see them. The inclusion of guard is only because they couldn't properly design levels without you taking a shitload of damage. I don't understand why the level design ended up this way because they did a great job with levels in the first game.
-Music. There were a few songs in this game that were pretty good, but for the most part it is all super forgettable. The first game had some of the best tracks I've heard in a video game and when compared to this its just very sad to see.
-Spoiler [spoiler] Getting the true ending. Finding the first memory/log was really cool and I thought finding the other would be that way. Nope just do like 13 levels of the battlesphere and you're done. It just didn't make sense to me at all. Why not try hiding them in the hub world or maybe hide some in the stages. This was just handled poorly. Also, many of the battlesphere levels were very tedious as they felt like the same thing being done over and over again with minute changes or they had broken mechanics that made me unable to progress unless i restarted.  [/spoiler]
- Another spoiler [spoiler] The whole final level against syntax was also pretty poorly designed. I don't know why the game didn't show you the amount of lives you had or the timer which just confused me. The search light mechanic was also dumb because it guaranteed that if this was your first time in the level you would die. Hiding should have at least lowered the security alarm for syntax but it didn't and I have no idea why [/spoiler]
-Glitches. I had gotten ""softlocked"" on 3 separate occasions during this game and they were all when I had gotten pretty far into a stage. It felt annoying that I had to keep restarting/reloading to a prior checkpoint because I was ""too fast"" for the game.

Overall, I really wanted this game to be just as great as the original. When I played that first demo, I definitely knew something was up with this game and I tempered my expectations. While I've only done a run of one character, that being lilac, I do plan on playing as the rest of them and seeing how their respective playthroughs work. This is a good game and I don't hate it, but in good faith I cannot recommend this to someone who's played and loved freedom planet.",1663432107,1663432444,False,29,0,0.665081441402435303,3,True,False,False,True,,,

Озвучка выросла в качестве, английский я знаю так себе но мне не составила труда понять лор второй части, даже на их блогах в Твиттер сильно хвалили игру, яркий пример голос Лайлака Dawn M. Bennett
Боссы в серии FP были один из ключевых фичей, но в этой части они стали красочные и местами даже сложные, [spoiler] всего за игру вы их встретите 29-30 штук, смотря на какую концовку в играете, на обычную или на истинную[/spoiler]

Battelsphere режим который заставит застрять на несколько часов с битвами боссов и хом ранов [spoiler] В основном вы там застрянете из-за временных капсул, для получение истинной концовки[/spoiler]
Графон стал красочнее, что вы итоге и затянуло в этот мир.

Yep! That’s Freedom Planet: The Second: Electric Boogaloo baby. First game is still to this day an incredible benchmark of quality for 2D action platformers and straight out of the gate I can say that most of the good qualities you could attribute to that game, apply to the sequel 1:1. 

Sequel retained it's identity as a high-speed joyride: mixing gameplay mechanics from multiple sources (mostly Sonic, Mega Man X and Gunstar Heroes), that are delivered with excellent feeling controls, creative gimmicks and stages, jaw-dropping setpieces and multiple characters to choose from with vastly different playstyles.

Freedom Planet 2 never ever drops down from a set baseline of quality at any given moment and despite few minor flaws or disappointments (in comparison to the first game), it maintains a package of speed and solid quality that could go through military grade blast doors.

Improvements over the first game include a higher fidelity graphics which exchange Genesis charm of the first game for the gorgeous details and colors of Hi-Bit aesthetics, which is awe inducing in multiple places. All playable girls each got themselves major or minor changes to streamline their gameplay plus new 4th hero joins the fray with difficult but definitely unique playstyle.

Game also addresses most of the common complaints from the first game. Bosses are still tough as nails, but this time not only I didn’t encounter any mishaps with missing telegraphs or unfair moves, but also a new item system was put in place that helps you modulate the amount of pain you can induce on yourself. This system is incredibly flexible and shall you look for either smooth sailing or ultra-nightmare experience, you can set up those pretty easily.

Story is also a good improvement over the first game, especially when it comes to pacing. There are no longer 20 minute cutscenes between levels. Odd tone shifts are gone as well. Plot still isn’t noticeably unique and themes lack subtlety, but great character interactions never left and it is a joy to hear and see. Highlight goes to some minor villains that do often steal the show because how entertaining they are. It’s just a little shame that the main antagonist isn’t as memorable this time around. She is not Lord Brevon unfortunately and she doesn’t have the impact on narrative and gameplay his shenanigans brought.

I also need to bring up, that while there are absolutely truckton amount of levels, those are a little less dense and evolving this time around. I do miss the two act structure of the first game quite a bit. I believe this was made to keep the game’s scope in check (which you can also see by some enemy recycling mid-game).

However as I say that, the individual levels themselves are designed with no major flaws and they are still as fun, creative, fast, unique, colorful and expertly designed as in the first game. Again, nothing goes here below that baseline.

The only thing that sadly could be considered below that aformentioned baseline is the OST. It's a big shame, since first game was all bangers all the time and it's a big part of first game's charm. FP2 delivers a lot of great stage themes and character motifs but boss themes mostly lack that excitement pill that elevated the first game. I wouldn’t be honest to myself if I didn’t mention this small disappointment.

But that’s the end of downers. Most of other users mention the 7 year wait for the game and if it was worth it or not. I’m biased here – I’m a fan of a first game and of course I could weigh in on this question. However, I do consider this a bad metric to actually answer what does Steam ask you. [i]Do you recommend this game?[/i] - to a random Joe that might stumble over this game an wonder if it’s worth their hard earned cash.

To those people I will first say, Have a nice day! And secondly… It is a bit expensive, but Freedom Planet 2 seriously blows away all the competition out of the water with sheer amount of quality content that will occupy you for hours on end. First playthrough took me 9 hours which is double of the first game! With ONE character and NO side objectives! We are talking about Hollow Knight levels of measuring contest and everybody knows how that game was severely underpriced at launch.

Freedom Planet 2 deliver top-of-the-line 2D action gameplay nowhere to be seen on the market, despite few flaws here and there. I’m still fresh of finishing the game. I might change my stance on few things later, but at the end of the day, like its predecessor, it’s a top tier gem waiting to be discovered and cherished by you and your friends.

Пока что я прошел игру только за Лайлак, потому буду судить с точки зрения только ее геймплея, но что я увидел меня крайне... озадачило:
С одной стороны имеется действительно неплохой левелдизайн с кучей развилок, а с другой очень часто сталкиваешься с проблемой, что ты не можешь просто бежать и уклоняться за СКОРОСТНОГО персонажа, тебе нужно сбрасывать скорость, а защита, которая могла бы быть неплохим дополнением, местами превращается в обязательное условие для прохождения.
Имеется возможность какой то прокачки и покупки зелий и итемов, но в то же время штраф очками за их использование (что особенно забавно, если учесть, что никакого штрафа за активацию различной помощи из настроек нет)
Обилие боссов, но многие из них не то, что плохо сделаны, а сделаны невероятно жирными, больно бьющими имеющими УЖАСНУЮ арену и просто раздражающе душными.
Система жизней так же довольно странная, если в первой части ты копил жизни на протяжении всей игры, что позволяло тебе их накопить перед сложным боссом (привет Брейвон и мои потерянные 30+ жизней на нем при первой встрече), здесь же тебе дают по умолчанию их 3 и еще где то одну-две можно заработать за сбор очков, потерял все жизни - покупай за 500 кристаллов продолжение или начинай сначала (что выглядит просто издевательски на водном уровне, который я и так проходил минут 30, после чего еще и встретился с худшим боссом игры, который сочетал все проблемы прошлого абзаца).
Сюжет очень сильно расширяет лор, но в тоже время не имеет никакой глубины за собой и мне было намного менее интереснее за ним наблюдать, чем было в первой части.
Хаб позволяет поговорить с фоновыми персонажами (что на самом деле мне к третьему разу уже надоело), но довольно сильно сбивает темп и скорее мешает, а классик мод недосупен при первом прохождении.
Музыка неплоха, но кроме темы главгада особо не запомнился ни один трек, по сравнению с первой явно слабее.
Стилистика потеряла часть своей приятной атмосферы, став более детализированной, но это уже скорее моя вкусовщина, а вот странности с камерой, когда автозум приходится выкручивать на максимум что бы просто иметь возможность видеть и драться с боссом это действительно странно, иначе он прыгает за камерой.
Как итог, игра мне в целом понравилась, иначе бы я ее не прошел даже, но, к сожалению, намного меньше чем первую часть. Скорее всего я пройду ее за остальных персонажей и заброшу, в то время как к первой я все еще буду возвращаться временами.",1663424223,1663424330,True,4,0,0.553279638290405273,2,True,False,False,True,,,

Well you can stop wondering, cause Freedom Planet 2 is what that timeline looks like. Bigger, better, faster, stronger, everything about it screams ""Extra.""

The most immediate and striking improvement you'll notice is the pixel art. It is [b][i]ludicrously[/i][/b] detailed. On everything, from playable characters and stages down to each individual NPC and bossfight. You jaw will drop the first time you fight one of the larger bosses. Then it will keep going through the floor when you realize there's 39(!) of them. You'll also notice that almost everything has a unique track on the OST - each level, hub area, and subsection of the map has a unique, certified-GalaxyTrail-quality musical piece attached to it.

On the gameplay side of things, the addition of items and the guard button makes for combat that's easy to get into (just like the original) but satisfying to master for the game's later, more complex fights. And you'll have plenty of time to master it as well, on the whopping 24(!) levels that you'll be traversing. Their count does not diminish their quality - each one is tightly designed, with different tempo and memorable gimmicks to make them stand out. It also does not diminish the storytelling. Quite the opposite - the new episodic chapter approach makes it so the plot advances at a brisk pace, whilst also finding plenty of time to develop each character's personal stakes.

Throw in high replayability in the form of 4 playable characters, the ability to talk to over 100 NPCs (who all have unique sprites!), tons of extra challenges, and an effin' museum for the spritework, and you get a dizzyingly rich package for the asking price. The only possible flaw that I can think of is how that sheer size makes for less cohesive narration: The episodic format means that the player characters get a lot of air time, but the main conflict and villain do not. This can often leave you feeling like the story is... unfocused, that certain levels are unrelated side-quests at best, even though they are still mandatory. Other than that, though?

It's clear that a lot of passion and time went into a dream game but the developer was never told what ideas might be working and what would have been better to cut.

The template is the same as the first game. It's a heavily Sonic platforming game with some light combat elements. The core Sonic platforming is the strongest part and though the physics aren't quite as well tuned that's probably more of a consequence of more moving environment parts and it never broke in any significant way. There's a huge variety of levels with unique stage mechanics: one of my favourites being a giant bat that shoots you off a baseball miles across the stage. The main issue is everything else.

There are some stages that have more of a puzzle element, collecting machine parts or keys etc and sometimes these are interesting diversions and other times tedious chores. My main contention is the bosses which are memorable artistically and often conceptually but just aren't fun to play. It's like you are playing Megaman Zero bosses but without the deliberate and tight movement akin to that series (point stolen from Stu Gipp). It doesn't help that boss stages are often so large the enemy moves offscreen, potentially throwing 
attacks at the same time. I think I enjoyed only one or two bosses throughout my entire playthrough.

I should also touch on the story. It's very much bunk but unlike the first game which has a classic mode to skip through it, this one makes you play through the whole story first. I'm assuming you get classic mode after finishing the story. There is no option to fast forward the dialogue so you if the voices are driving you nuts, or you just read the text as quick as I do your options are either sit through or skip. I honestly don't think this games has a subtle enough touch to be talking about species genocide: maybe don't have the antagonist sporting Dr. Wily skull mechs as a minimum??

I've played about 7 hours of the game with one character, Lilac. In terms of content that's impressive because there's still three other characters with unique gimmiks. This would be great if I wasn't dreading taking those characters through the aforementioned aggravating parts. I didn't enjoy taking Lilac through the mecha piece hunt, getting dogpilled with enemies and walls/ground of spikes; why would I enjoy it with Milla?

There's some other issues to briefly touch on. The music is good but I don't think it's a cut on the original game. The pixel art is very detailed with wonderful animations but the background art can often be so cluttered that it's hard to tell what's foreground or not. 

It feels like GalaxyTrail is equally committed to undercutting it's great ideas as it to passionately crafting an engaging game. I really don't want to mark this down because it has so many fun ideas and level mechanics so I would say pick this up on sale.",1663422125,1664147156,False,13,0,0.536322712898254395,1,True,False,False,True,,,

I am updating it now to show that I have finished it on at least one character. I will say this: It isn't a perfect game, but the passion OOZES out of it. It plays incredibly smoothly and really pushes the player to get good. It does well to recapture the feel of the SNES and SEGA Genesis days, and some of their difficulty. I played it on the hardest difficulty to start with, and it was a painful journey, but it was worthwhile, as it really helped me improve my play. The Normal difficulty will be accessible to people starting the game off or just picking up the genre. The bosses are far more lenient without Hard Mode's doubled damage.

The Character designs are even better than they were in the first one, and it really feels like the voice-actors not only enjoyed voicing the characters but had genuine passion for the project. I can only really remark on playstyles I'm proficient with, and I have to say that I am bad at Lilac and Milla, though players good with them in the previous game will have an easy time using them in this one. Carol is a titanic step up from what she was in Freedom Planet 1. Her DPS is much higher, and her gameplay is more streamlined and intuitive. I cannot speak for fans of Carol with the Motorcycle, as I barely used it. To me, it feels and plays worse than without the Motorcycle, but I grew up playing Megaman X and Zero. Since Carol reminds me so much of Zero (Zero series on GBA) in gameplay, I really meshed well with it and it felt amazing to play as. Her kit is excellent, and, once an opening is found, she can eviscerate Boss' health bars with stunning ease. She really plays like a cat.

Neera is more sluggish, but she is a precision powerhouse. She is less agile but still quick, more relying on careful positioning than merely blasting through a stage with invincibility (though she is still capable in that regard). Players that like being close to enemies will like her, especially once they really get good with her slower attacks and utilizing her ""Focus"" self-buff.

The Guard System can be thought of as more of a Street Fighter Parry with massively lenient timing. It is required for some Boss fights, and makes some stages much easier, and it is very easy to use (I'm bad at parrying in Street Fighter but I got pretty good with it in this game. It's not hard).

The stage design is imperfect but pretty smooth for the most part. There were times where I got lost and questioned which way I was supposed to go, but a little exploration and a lot of going this way and that sorted it out. The terrain is a little frustrating in some places, as surfaces meant to be walked up vertically will throw the character at a sharp angle if a jump is done while running on the wall. Since some terrain behaves in such a way in Boss fights, it makes them unnecessarily difficult, and makes the losses inflicted by them feel unfair. That said, It's all very smooth barring that one hiccup and it will not stop me from recommending the game because it can be played around with even the barest amount of experience. Some enemy placement is annoying, though. On-screening an enemy and then feeling like there is no time to react as one takes damage from something one couldn't have possibly seen feels bad, though, again, it's not game-breaking and these instances don't occur often. The warning markers are a bit large, and, at one time, prevented me from seeing something I was supposed to be avoiding. Not perfect, but still able to be played around and still tons of fun.

The story is actually pretty decent for what this game is. The team respected the characters. They expanded on them and leaned into their personalities pretty hard. Carol was already my favorite, and, as a Carol fan, I was exceedingly well-pleased. I'd heard the same for Milla. I'm sure Lilac and Neera's characters are just as well-represented. As a bonus, Neera is actually likable in this game. Hints are dropped of developments in the other parts of the stories, so it really encourages the player to play through with all characters.

Merga is a villain that was done well with the narrative and ""show, don't tell"" techniques used. She was done far better than Brevon, but still, somehow, lacks his innate menace. That said, I really have very few complaints, if any, about the direction the story took. This is how a sequel should be done.

The music is excellent, by the way. Maybe not as punchy as some of the first Freedom Planet's tracks in some spots but definitely, DEFINITELY amazing. This OST is a whole lot better than the first Freedom Planet's. I only found a few of the themes not hitting as hard, and that was rare. I also was concentrating on tough boss patterns and trying not to die so I will have time now to appreciate the OST more since I'm not trying to survive something that will delete my health bar.

Games like this don't come along too often. Makers rarely have this kind of passion anymore and they rarely execute it even half as well. This is a sequel done right. This is what the Triple A industry can't seem to get right, and yet this little team of developers with gobs of passion and a fraction of the budget did amazingly well. This game is worth every penny and I am glad I could support it.",1663417990,1686020923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The level design often gets confusing and doesn't convey well where you're supposed to head next contrary to the first game.
A lot of times the levels are littered with enemies and traps, which make it impossible to not take a hit. You can also see the developers acknowledge this will happen by adding health petals close to those spots so the player can compensate for the hits taken. This is not good level design.
The level design after a few stages feels flat out lazy and re-using gimmicks and enemies from older stages while the layouts get even more confusing, and the stages drag themselves to 10+ minutes each.
I'd rather have less stages that feel unique, shorter and fun than a lot of stages that feel like padding and filler.

The pixel art and animations are cute but the background gets overly detailed at times making hard to distinguish the characters from the backdrop elements.

I don't know why they changed Lilac's model so much from the first game, especially when all other characters only got slight updates, she looks weird to me now, like if she's wearing a wig. Lilac's appearance was already established with FP1 and all the other indie projects the character is in, so what gives?

Not fan of the bosses in the first game and seems they are even worse here.
Bosses have very erratic patterns, spam the screen with projectiles, barely announce their actions and often jump offscreen making the battle a chore.
I know there's a guard mechanic, but it's very finnicky and often results in you getting hit anyway, perhaps if they added a freeze-frame or a parry/counter mechanic then the guarding would make more sense.

For the music, I don't know what happened here. The first game had some really nice themes, especially boss battle ones. Minus a few tracks, this soundtrack feels too ""soft"" and afraid to push the bar. Very disappointed with the music.
The voice acting is better than the first game, but the cutscenes that they are used in are not very entertaining. Sometimes the voice clip quality sounds lower and more muffled for some reason.

There needs to be a fix for the gamepad. Perhaps add some profiles for it to support DPAD as well etc. I had to wrestle around with fixing the controls when I first launched the game. Not a good experience, especially when the icons do not really reflect the controller buttons.

Finally I got a few collision bugs, especially stuck when moving through loops or jump-through platforms. There's some instances where the collision area of some objects is larger than it should be and the character looks like they are standing on thin air. The game softlocked as well when I tried to pick the ""Food"" option in the inn at the palace area. I encountered a few audio glitches as well where a lot of sound effects were playing at the same time really loud. And in the final stages with the light on/off system the game lagged a lot and experienced graphical glitches (Had to restart the stage a couple times for them to be fixed).

The game might scratch the ""classic Sonic platformer"" itch for a little bit, but I wouldn't recommend this game over the first one, that's for sure.",1663415376,1663416339,False,36,0,0.65111243724822998,4,True,False,False,True,,,

[*] The level design has been turned up to 11. There's so much variety in level-specific mechanics. 
[*] Engaging story, supported by high-quality performances. I particularly loved Lilac's voice. This comes from someone who only played 1 on Classic mode. 
[*] Movement and combat is as great as before. The new thing here is the guard move, which serves to enhance the game's flow, by letting you i-frame through a lot of obstacles. 
[*] ~10 hours for one playthrough, which is far more than what most Sonic games offers. I haven't touched the other characters yet, but there seems to be more content / story hidden in these other paths, as well as true ending path. 
[*] The visual presentation is fantastic. Backgrounds look incredible, and animations are smoother than before. 
[*] The bosses are all well designed and fun, and none felt annoying / gimmicky to fight.

Cons:
[list]
[*] World map is confusing to move through, since it's split into separate areas. 
[*] Hub levels felt a little hollow (just some NPCs and shops). 
[*] Some pacing issues in the 2nd act. Story just kinda stops for a while, and the levels seemed to have a higher focus on puzzles than speed. 
[*] The non-stop bosses were exhausting. I think they should have reserved bosses for the end of each ""episode"", as I got tired of fighting them in every single level.

- Generally improved combat, as well as a new Dodge/dash function. It works pretty well. I am now going to go back to the first game and try pressing the nonexistent dodge button in vain.
- And a bunch more.

I'd say the difficulty of bosses are overall a bit harder than the first game's (minus pre-nerf steroido Brevon of FP1), but the ability to dodge-dash makes bosses more tight. Most bosses are fought in the middle or end of a stage, but every now and then it pulls a Klonoa 2, and puts a boss only stage on the map, which is neat, more games like that should do this, at least at times. Speaking of Klonoa 2, just like FP1, some levels do indeed drag on for quite a bit, which I'm fine with, but some people like their bite sized levels. Good old Klonoa 2/Freedom Planet level syndrome.

In the hub levels, there's tons of charming characters to talk to for lots of optional dialogue. Soooo many npcs.

[spoiler] Lilibeth's abs are ROCK HARD, I wanna SKATE ON THOSE ABSOLUTELY DENSE BOAR ABS OOOOOOOOOOH! [/spoiler] 

Some of the characters are designed by Tyson Tan, which I somewhat know from DA eons ago, his artstyle is cool and all, but sometimes its ""Hyper cute"", whereas I prefer the more consistent artstyle of the first game (Although, I'd say the artstyle of this game is generally better, and certainly more detailed). Whenever I saw something that looked overly Tyson-Tan-y, it kind of took me out of it (both in a good and bad way). Especially that one mech fight. I'm like ""Oh no, it's The Tyson Tan Mech"" weirdly enough, it's the boss I had the most trouble with, needed like 2-3 continues, didn't think I needed even 1 continue for every other boss. I feel kinda funny now for getting my ass handed to me by something so cute.


[spoiler] Snake: I didn't think you'd be so... cute. [/spoiler] 

Speaking of lives, you can't horde them like you could in the first game, but on the flip side, you always start with a few every level (can be increased with a potion effect), as well as having the choice of using a life to start from last checkpoint with full health, or start off exactly where you died, but with low hp (hp recovery can also be increased with a potion effect).

How the potions work is that they are passive, you do not actively drink them. There are 5 slots to put whatever potion effect you want, you could have 1 charge of 5 different effects, or 2/3 charges of 2 different effects, or 5 charges with 1 effect, if you want to focus on your favored effect. Makes me feel like a Witcher mixing these potion charges into the bottle. Milla is a Witcher confirmed.

You can buy potions/accessories/music from various shops in various towns, by spending either gems, as found in the first game, or enemy cores, dropped by most enemies, or gold pieces, which can be bought with gems/cores, and sometimes found in chests. Several accessories can also be found in chests, but most of them make the game harder in exchange for a bigger gem bonus (reminds me of Supergiant difficulty gimmicks)

The music is superb as usual, the levels are fairly similar to FP1's in structure, you have your normal/action stages, puzzle stages, some key item hunty stages, and sometimes a mix of the above. As well as a few SCHMUP stages, just like the first game. That one mech schut stage was pretty ridiculous/chaotic and kind of glitchy. Loved it.

The voiceacting is as good as the first's, there's a good lot more of it, and the main villain is likeable and sympathetic [spoiler] and very hot [/spoiler]. Unlike the first game's villain which was just SCUMSCUMSCUM that you love to hate. I like me a good hateable villain (Brevon), but I usually prefer the more likeable ones that you can sympathize with.

There's also some neat twists in the story. Such as the Magister revealing his face

This game should set the standard for all other games in its devotion to just [u]letting players have fun[/u] in whatever ways they want to.

There is an insane amount of quality and polish to the game, even on day 1 of release. It is obviously a labor of love and that is felt through the way its design meets players at whatever level they want to engage with it. Do you just like platforming? Here's ~30 stages for you to run through with unique set pieces like low gravity, air bubbles, boosters, darkness, etc. Quick-reflex combat? Got tons of that with a huge variety of bosses. Story? Dive in or just skip it if you want. Achievements and challenge modes? Go wild. Favor different play styles? There's 4 unique characters you can be. Find the game too easy or difficult? There's assist options and items which augment the difficulty. Speedrunning? Plenty of in-game timers and record trackers available. 

It's just.... overwhelming. There's [i]so much[/i] here. There's a museum of collectibles to fill up. There's a photo mode that I don't know who asked for but it's in here! There's hidden collectibles that unlock multiple endings. There's a jukebox. There's dozens of unique fully animated NPCs with distinct character. Basically every single thing from the previous game has been refined and improved to make gameplay more fun and dynamic: cancelable dragon boosts, instant Milla cubes, a guard / instashield button, a broader moveset in general like Lilac's up-slash, Carol's Jump Disc and bike stashing... and also she's actually fun to play as now ( :-P ). Neera adds yet another playstyle to the mix. Bosses do that thing I love where they're actually involved in the course of the whole level and not just showing up out of nowhere at the end. For the most part their fights are fun (maybe just a bit pattern-heavy) but there are a few stinkers (pretty much any water-based boss...) Those are balanced out by the few that had really unique mechanics or were just eye-popping WOWZA the whole way through.

There's a lot more I can say about specific things but I want to keep this somewhat brief. Freedom Planet 2 is an easy Game of the Year 2022 for me, and if you ask me in a few months I will probably agree it is one of the finest games I have played in my life.",1663383505,1663383505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The game absolutely blew me away on multiple occasions. The levels are many but are fun, unique, and varied. Combat mechanics are refined, so many bosses and yet they're all unique and fun to fight. 

There were so many times where I truly felt like ""now I can see why this game took so long!"" I really think GalaxyTrail went above and beyond with this game!

My biggest gripe would have to be the last two levels. Just like FP1, the last couple of levels feel unfairly difficult. It throws so many enemies your way and traps (like spikes on grind rails while you're going super fast so barely any time to avoid them). These levels did have unique mechanics just like the rest of the game which is very impressive considering the high level count in this game but yeah I think the last two could've been a bit more polished.

There were also a few levels where I couldn't figure out how to progress for some time due to unclear objective/path so I think that could've been made a bit more clear.

The story won't blow your socks off but as someone who isn't crazily obsessed with finding the best writing ever in video games (like so many gamers tend to be...) I very much enjoyed it. Lots of high stakes and emotional moments. The dialogue is heavily refined from the first game and there are lots of really neat reveals about the characters we know and love from the first game. 

The music was, as usual, really good but unfortunately nothing really stuck out to me as much as FP1's soundtrack. Still the composer did an excellent job.

I hear lots of people have ran into bugs and personally I haven't experienced anything too bad or annoying. I did have trouble setting up my PS3 controller using the Playstation button icons. Lots of the buttons displayed in the game did not match what I pressed on my controller. However, setting the icons back to the default ""numbers"" made everything a non-issue. I think its worth bringing up to people reading this that, for now as of writing this review on 9/16/2022, you shouldn't bother trying to change icons. Just stick to the numbers!

All in all, I think the game was very much worth the wait. Definitely one of my favorite 2D platformers of all time now. I replayed FP1 many times because it's just really fun to play but now I don't think I ever see myself going back to it and instead probably going to replay this game a whole bunch from now on!

I played the original Freedom Planet, and waited 7 long years for Freedom Planet 2. 

I appreciate the transition from linear classic story progression to branching adventure quests that meet back together into a main path after completion, while exploring various maps with town hubs in between...There are also plenty of items that you can alter gameplay with as you unlock more shops, whether to aid you or to make the game much more challenging which is sometimes required to get the highest ranks.

Boss battles are notably memorable and numerous as well in Freedom Planet 2. Many bosses follow a changing pattern, however the boss 'characters' that you can battle are surprisingly responsive and certainly provide that spike in difficulty when a change of pace is needed. Not only that, you can fight the bosses again later after a certain amount of progression.

All four main characters are unique and dynamic from everything I've tested. The only things I can say I find lacking, is that I want more playable characters if there aren't any or some kind of online or local PVP character fighting arena...

Regardless, the swath of gameplay additions and improvements to Freedom Planet 2 enrich the experience enough as is. The upgrade in graphics certainly has done wonders in the sprites and artwork too.

[hr][/hr]
El juego no se basa solo en velocidad, en algunas fases toca explorar, saber por dónde ir y también hay que pelear contra los enemigos. Este no es como el juego del famoso erizo azul, aquí los enemigos aguantan un par de golpes, así que ya puedes atacarles con garras, armas o lo que use tu personaje. Arrollarlos también sirve (y es muy satisfactorio). De hecho, el juego se parece más a los juegos de TREASURE (como Gunstar Heroes o Alien Soldier) que a los del erizo azul, y esto se nota mucho más en las batallas contra los jefes, que son auténticas batallas y no saltar rodando encima de los robots de un científico.
[hr][/hr]
Para cada fase tienes dos vidas, da igual cómo acabases la fase anterior, siempre empiezas con dos vidas y cada 250 cristales te dan una extra. Esto influye en la puntuación, pero también influye cuando te derrotan, ya que tienes la opción de volver al último punto de control o de revivir al momento con muy poca vida (se pueden usar objetos para revivir con más vida). Ideal para cuando un jefe te derrota cuando le queda solo un golpe.
[hr][/hr]
Tienes cuatro personajes a elegir, cada uno con sus habilidades y movimientos propios. No es lo mismo jugar una fase con uno o con otro:
  - Lilac es la más rápida y puede impulsarse en cualquier dirección, incluso desde el aire.
  - Carol utiliza un yoyó para impulsarse al estilo ninja, puede usar unas plataformas especiales para moverse, puede escalar paredes como Megaman X y tiene una moto que desafía las leyes de la física.
  - Milla utiliza sus poderes psíquicos para protegerse, atacar e incluso impulsarse. También es super adorable.
  - Neera tiene una lanza y problemas controlando su ira. También controla el hielo.
[hr][/hr]
El juego tiene una historia que no te esperas, la historia de la anterior entrega estaba bastante bien ya que ofrecía más de lo que esperarías en una historia para un plataformas. No obstante esta secuela va más allá, continúa la historia y no deja de darte sorpresas. También puedes investigar el trasfondo del universo del juego, y es bastante rico.
[hr][/hr]
Los personajes no jugables también son super carismáticos y los principales están doblados, dándoles mucha personalidad.
[hr][/hr]
Puedes personalizar tu estilo de juego con objetos y pociones. Renuncias a bonus de puntuación pero desarrollas tu estilo de juego, a menos que sean objetos que suban la dificultad.

Si tu primera partida te puede durar alrededor de diez horas con un solo personaje, te puedes hacer a la idea de lo que te puede durar con los cuatro. Tómatelo con calma.

Not quite sadly. It's still quite good but there are some issues that sadly soured my experience with the game especially nearing the end and prevented it from being great to me.

Well let's start with some of the good:
- The story is quite good, the comedic scenes made me laugh sometimes (otherwise atleast grin) but the serious parts were more earned than the first game
- The presentation of the game is quite good, the artstyle is unique and really colorful
- The game has loads of fun gimmicks that kept each level fresh
- The hubworlds were a welcome addition which made the world of Avalice feel more alive
- The game has a big cast of main characters and more minor characters

Now for the bad:
- I like the new artstyle but it made it really hard to see what was in the foreground and in the background in some levels. Causing me to get stuck, not understand where I could land or even die
- I ran into quite some bugs that usually were to my disadvantage (once it helped me beat a boss though) - though with all the patches coming out this should get better with time
- The music clearly does not loop, which is very noticeable in some levels
- Most of the hubworlds were fun but I wish there were some more things to do
- Some parts of the story felt ""off"" to me (one choice seemed to lessen the impact of the main villain to me)
- Some levels were kinda annoying to beat (the puzzle based levels mostly)

Back to some great stuff to finish this review:
- That title screen is just amazing, when a game opens up like that you know if will be good
- The game is very well balanced each boss encounter felt like a threat but not straight up impossible (Playing as Lilac)
- 80% of the levels were very fun to play and had loads of very cool features
- The game has tons of moments where the WOW factor really was present (elevating it the best 2D platformer game you can find gameplay wise)
- I like the episode format, gives more choice and personality to the world
- There are loads of nice little references for long time fans, which felt very earned after replaying the first game
- There are loads of fun levels making the game really worth the asking price (heck it may even be too cheap for what you are getting)

If I would give this game a grade... I would give it around 7.5/10

But, not only did Freedom Planet 2 live up to the first game, it surpassed it in every conceivable way. No, it went even beyond that.
The genuine surprise and joy of playing Freedom Planet 2 doesn't come from saying ""Wow! This is like if Treasure made a Sonic game"" it comes from the realization that this game is BETTER than that hypothetical game! Every element comes at you with the energy of what had to be the happiest game makers on the planet. There's ALWAYS something new coming at you, and with the quality of the art, music, level design, enemies, and game feel, you'll be surprised to know the amount of content this game has. 

Freedom Planet to just about triples the amount of content from the first game, and that's not counting the fact that there's 1 more character, and 2 more adventure campaign stories than last time. This could have easily been a $40.00 price tag, but at it's current price, it's more than a steal.

This game puts FREEDOM in Freedom Planet. The movement options and level design go together so well, you'll find yourself in a constant loop of speed, exploration, discovery, and combat ALL AT THE SAME TIME!

Im being serious!

Cleared the game first time as Milla.
Anyways, the worst parts of the game in my opinion is still the camera not zooming out enough normally. I know what that does to the sprites, but I feel like the game could have had the camera out a little more without the sprites going nuts. I feel like I get hit by offscreen bullets and enemies very often.

Some levels are just so big I cant wrap my head around memorizing them. Some parts feel the same in the same level, making it difficult to properly have the levels be recognizable and have a signature. Well, its great in the art department. But the largeness really make them slightly hard to put in mind. The water levels are actually pretty damn good I must say.

The story is also much better. I cringed a lot in the first one, but this time I can forgive it because its actually not too linear of a story.

I feel as if the music is not as memorable but that could be me.

The art is absolutely great tho! Cute animations! Awesome characters! Even just random npcs look pretty fleshed out. Its great!

Pretty lengthy story mode. As you can see, I beat the game in about... 8-9 hours. Is this normal? Was I slow? Regardless, I hope to try beating the game several times as the different characters. Carol was my favourite in the first and from what I tried shes still incredibly good.

best advice is to start off on beginner difficulty if you want to have a fun experience for your first playthrough.

Cute/likable characters, fun levels, fantastic music (like the first game), did i mention a WHOLE lot of charm and cuteness, and the most satisfying momentum I've ever had the pleasure of playing with.

 I want to start first with the levels, because the levels in this game are UNMATCHED with how creative and fun each one is. For example one of my personal favorite stages is lightning tower cause the whole gimmick is its COMPLETELY vertical which doesn't sound fun at first but combined with the games excellent flow and the wonderful level design it ends up playing like a dream, and ancestral forge is super fun as well because it has very neat puzzle gimmicks and it pulls it off in a PLATFORMER its not what you would expect to be fun but it just clicks and that flow that i mentioned earlier is still present here too.  despite there being around 30 levels. 30 is kinda an exaggeration because there is some boss levels (6 or 5 i think) which take up some of the level slots but there is still alot of content to chew through if you just want to flow through the game YET it still takes me just under 2 hours to finish the game even with experience and some knowledge relating to skips and whatnot.

 Now to continue i want to talk about the main cast and how they feel to play as, starting with the main gal herself LILAC. Lilac retains all of her moveset  from the 1st game and gains 2 new abilites which includes: Dragon boost, upward and downward air attacks, and her crouch attacks. But also now has the ability to cancel her dragon boost called the boost breaker to create a area/cloud that does ALOT of damage when you use it on bosses its also really nice you dont have to go through the whole duration of the boost if you use it at the wrong time or bump a wall. But for my own take i personally think her move set is  a bit too weighty and sluggish to use in this game despite it being nearly exactly the same compared to her FP1 counterpart, but i think the reason why i feel this way is cause the levels expanded to compensate for the faster and floater gameplay and sadly Lilacs move set just doesn't cut it for me. doesn't mean i hate it though it still gets a solid 3rd place when compared to the others.

 Next we got Carol....... CAROLS MOVESET IS BATSHIT INSANE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS HER JUMP DISK AND HER UPWARD AND DOWNWARD ATTACKS ARE SO BUSTED, SHE IS BY FAR THE BEST AND MOST FUN CHARACTER TO PLAY OUT OF THE CAST. FOR EXAMPLE HER WALL JUMPS TRIVIALIZE LIGHTNING TOWER AND ANCESTRAL FORGE ITS SO NUTS... ahem sorry i was a little carried away but you get my point I easily give Carol the gold motor bike and 1st place as my favorite character to play, and shes always my pick when returning to the game to play some levels or to just have fun with the story and shes the most funny tbh. 

NEXT we have Milla. Im just gonna say this now im not sure if i like her unique style of fighting or dislike it sometimes it can feel finicky to use but its still faster than Lilacs moveset so ill take less traditional fighting and movement style over Lilacs. But hey her move set (and health) now is leagues better than the 1st game where it was nightmare to play any level but aqua tunnel or relic maze. Which is why im giving Milla the 2nd place spot for the me having fun tier list.

 Lastly Neera. I know shes a newcomer but overall her moves arent bad per say but she feels the most restrictive to play as i think a lot of that has to with the fact even though she has a built in double jump she practically has NO way of gaining vertical height. She has everything else though like great attack potential and how fast she can go on horizontal paths is breath taking but its the fact she has no vertical and something i failed to mention but i will now is she has to get super close to targets in order to deal damage with some exceptions being her ice shoot attack (Sniper Drive), and the upward special attack (Tundra Ray). Even with those few rare attacks its not enough to make her that fun to play, she just kinda feels awkward which sucks to say cause she has CRAZY potential, imagine her with carols wall jumps.

Well thats about it i know i didn't talk about some things in this review but i wanted to get the REALLY important thoughts and feelings out on this review TL;DR Level design is good (Lightning Tower) Ancestral Forge) and Carol is my favorite Milla is 2nd Lilac is 3rd and Neera needs to be improved.

And got both endings with Carol just today, since I got most of the stuff with her. This is a complete update on my rating now that I've flipped the game completely so I will just put it with a sentence, Pros and Cons.

So visuals are great, music may be mostly remixes of the first game (very subtle Sonic vibes on some stages, but I still like the soundtrack regardless. There are still some bangers here; The volcanic caves (Boss is that whale on a ball) being my most favorite stage/ song track. Gameplay is ok, started off terrible when the game first launched but the current patches have helped alot. I don't know what it is about this game, but Lilac is kind of Un-Lilackable. That part with the mouse bomb.... omg


PROS

Graphics/visuals - The graphics have improved very much from the first one and separates clearly from FP1. 9/10

Music - As stated earlier, songs are mostly remixes from the first game, but I say those remixes were still great to hear in the game. 10/10

Gameplay - Pretty decent gameplay 5/10 (will be explained in Cons for low rating)

Boss fights (some) - Some boss fights were kind creative and I enjoyed the creativity/ 6/10

Hub/town interactions - pretty cool on the first gameplay, something new to the whole thing, I guess. 4/10

Carol Tea - I only used Carol to get everything: Game startoff, Battlesphere, flipping game twice (normal and true route) hey, Team Carol all the way. 10/10.


CONS

Bugs/glitches - I understand the team poured their heart and soul into this sequel and I thank you guys from the bottom of my heart, but for a game that was pushed back for 7 years, I truly expected to see very little to no glitches/bugs in the game. Before my re-edit of this post I mentioned that it killed the game for me: it still does. Patches are being done, but not completely in the right spots. I honestly before the patch could not clear Mach Madness because of some bug that didn't allow the enemies to respond during the waves. This part alone has made me dub this the Cyberpunk of 2D scrollers and I'm giving this section a 2/10.

Gameplay - The cons of gameplay was the launch day; inputs were so weird on ps4 controller ( 1,2,3, etc.) it was awful, Changing the controls to how I wanted the buttons (Jump, action,special, etc) mapped in a certain way somehow mapped right to up and left to down. I haven't been complaining about guard since I always used assist, but from the beta before the game ever came out it's really out of place for this type of platform game. It was more fluent in FP1 1/10

Level Design - Most of the levels had decent design, but some of them, the Bakunawa stage with the warps was probably the worst. The catchy song could not save the design even if it tried. 2/10

Hub/town - After Flipping game with one character, it gets very tedious and boring to keep talking to these people. I think it would've been cool characters with lightbulbs gave side missions to reward player with time capsules, instead of shoving them all in battle sphere. 1/10

Battlesphere - As mentioned above, I hated how all the time capsules were shoved into battlesphere, its like all the development went solely into the battlesphere, which is probably why it took 7 years to kind of complete the game. So Cordelia just spent all her time leaving messages in the battlesphere for anyone to find?? That's what it felt like to me. 2/10

Time capsules (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!) - I'm really mixed about this... I think it would've been better to have side missions with NPCs with light bulbs to get the other time capsules. On top of that, The log entries themselves felt pointless; True ending still felt pretty empty, as there are still some questions that are left unanswered within this game's lore. I've seen some other reviews, they say it's optional. It's not, its mandatory LGBT. I have nothing against it, but all of year 2022 Hollywood has been shoving it down my throat in their movies, even game companies. It has gotten to the point that I am just tired of seeing it... I have to give this part a 1/10


VERDICT

Now This is not a bad game, I would recommend it after a few more patches, because the best review is your own. The reason It still has a downvote for me is because of all the cons I mentioned; They just urked me to Avalice Kingom come... I really didn't want to downvote this game, honest. But it's just so many flaws that's not balanced out well.

（后面开了游戏内的无限续关，因为太难了，最终关我甚至续了9次币）

给出的评价是推荐买，人物都画得很好（不只是主角和几个主要配角，还包括NPC），其次是比起一代，本作多了相当多的剧情展开，除了战斗场景，还有不少的和平场景供探索和浏览，而不只是像一代那样单纯走过场动画，同时，每个场景都画得相当精良，可以看得出本作是非常用心的作品，得益于上述三点，这个游戏能够非常充分地展现FP2的世界观。

从关卡设计上来看，本作总体关卡长度比1代长了不少，还多了很多以前都没有尝试过的新元素，本作最值得说的就是解谜（同时也是最让人头疼的），例如某关要在水中反复调整水位，不断插拔钥匙，还要对付难缠的敌人，这可以说是令人感觉十分新颖，也可以说是非常头疼，因为以前从没有这样的玩法设计，也不需要一边打一边解谜，如果你不喜欢，后面几关势必会让你十分头疼，因为或多或少包含了一些解谜元素，而如果你喜欢，你肯定会感觉十分有趣，毕竟有不少关卡是要边打边解谜的。
另外，本作还加了一些新的关卡类型，例如竞技场（没怎么打过）还有训练场，训练场让你能够与不同的角色进行对抗，这是1代所没有的玩法，竞技场没咋玩过，不太确定是什么样的。

除了上述的关卡设计，本作还在玩法上多了一个很大的不同，加了一个无敌护盾，这是你无伤通过某些关卡的重要打法，有的弹幕十分密集，如果不借助护盾，要想无伤会非常困难，而护盾则降低了通过的难度，但是护盾也不意味着无敌，因为护盾是瞬时释放，极短持续时间和一定的CD。Carol的大招方式也有所修改（相对于FP1），体验上肯定是与1代完全不一样的了。

如果你确实十分喜欢这个游戏而又担心自己能否玩通关，那么你可以放心了，因为本作修改了一些设定，例如生命条耗尽后可以选择从检查点满血复活或者原地丝血复活，释放无敌护盾的设定，额外加了4个辅助设定，其中就有最重要的，无限原地复活，即便是手残党（比如我）也是绝对可以通关的。

总的来说，是一个质量上乘的作品，值得票价。",1663301140,1664361031,True,4,1,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Vamos lá Freedom Planet 2, um dos jogos mais esperados por mim e cara embora tenha demorado muito valeu a pena, bom nesta analise vou seguir os seguintes tópicos que são: Gráficos, Chefes, Personagens e a Dificuldade 

-Começando pelos Gráficos 

Os Gráficos estão muito bonitos se o primeiro já tinha uma pixel art bonita, então nesta sequência estão melhores ainda.

-Dificuldade 

Cara eu te falo mesmo no normal o jogo está bem desafiante e no momento que estou publicando está analise, ainda não joguei no expert, mas uma coisa e certa no normal o jogo já esta desafiante mesmo.

-Personagens 

Os personagens estão muito bons e queria detalhar uma coisa a dublagem do jogo está muito boa, dá pra sentir a emoção nas palavras de cada personagem e a nova vilã e muito boa também e além do mais os personagens ao decorrer do jogo amadurecem e muito.

-Chefes 

Olha os chefes estão bem desafiadores, tive dificuldade com muitos no normal, inclusive o chefe final foi um dos mais dificeis ou então o mais dificil tive que usar muitos cristais do jogo para conseguir zerar.

Olha pra mim o jogo vale o seu preço e a nota que eu dou é 10/10 realmente um jogo muito bom, e sim roda nessa sua batata computadorizada, kkkkk

前作で侵略者から世界を救ったドラゴン族のライラック達が、新たな脅威に立ち向かいます。
アクションの爽快さはそのままにボリュームアップしており、
マップはより広大に、ステージギミックは更に種類豊かになりました。
フルボイスで軽快に掛け合うキャラクター達も健在です。

[h1]■前作からの変更点[/h1]
・前作の中ボスだった「ニーラ」がプレイアブルキャラに追加されました。
・前作の面クリア型からワールドマップからの面セレクト型へと変更され、
　マップ数が大幅に増加しています。（12マップ→約30マップ）
・様々な効果を持つサポートアイテムがステージ開始時に設定できるようになり、
　残機がある限りその場での復活が可能になったため、やや難易度が下がっています。
・キャラが若干小さくなり画面全体が見やすくなりました。
　またオートズーム機能や、画面外の敵へのアラートが実装され、
　前作の不満点だった「早すぎて画面外の敵や障害物に当たる」といった事が減りました。
・新アクションとしてガードが出来るようになりました。

And more Planet. And more good.

It's good.

Go play it.

EDIT: I have fully completed Freedom Planet 2, so here's some more in-depth opinions.
The game is very fun, and the story is a wonderful improvement over the last game. It's also an improvement over the last one in basically every relevant fashion. But it's not perfect, and my criticisms mainly come in the form of two areas.

1. The S rank system. The way the HUD presents it is confusing, as it makes it appear that collecting gems is actually important for getting them when it's exclusively about that multiplier. In addition, the entire challenge is completely ruined by three bravestones - Expensive Stocks, No Revives, and No Stocks, as getting the S ranks requires not dying with two brave stones equipped (or not taking damage with one brave stone/no items equipped, but that's far more difficult as-is), and these brave stones quite literally only punish you for dying rather than actually making the run more difficult. I would suggest a rebalancing of the multiplier bonus you get from the various bravestones to make the others more appealing to use.

2. Neera. Lilac is fun to play and a surprising powerhouse, Carol is my favourite to play as and feels even better than FP1, and Milla remains an amazing character locked behind needing good skill to access, but Neera feels lacking in comparison. Her mobility options are poor as they require utilising enemies and the floor to make use of, making most of them completely unattractive to use, Focus conflicts with the intended purpose of Guard, forcing you to choose between avoiding damage or conserving your Energy for where you need it, and in actual combat her attacks are close range and precise but don't deal quite enough damage to make up for that finicky precision, despite being labelled as the brawler character.

That being said, this game is still absolutely amazing, and the 8 years of development have most definitely been worth it!",1663249175,1664976347,True,80,26,0.822013556957244873,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Controls are solid and responsive, level design is quite good (with a few notable exceptions having weird stage flow in my opinion), the dialogue and overall humor genuinely made me laugh quite often (Carol's Battlesphere commercial cutscene is amazing), and the sprite work is beautiful. 

During my play time thus far, a few bugs have occurred, like checkpoints placing you in the floor (most egregious during a HARD spoiler level at the end of the game), dying on grabbables incurring a soft lock and some strange collision detection that may or may not also put you in the floor temporarily depending on how it feels on that moment.

My only genuine gripes thus far are related to Lilac's Blink Dash, which feels kind of sticky and unresponsive sometimes, not always activating when I press input and losing most of my momentum out of it, and the lack of a way to view seen cutscenes again. I recognize that it's totally possible this may be a me issue, so take these with a grain of salt.

Overall, I genuinely recommend this long awaited sequel to Freedom Planet, and the series as a whole. I truly hope many more will find it and have as much fun with these games as I have.

The way you create speed and carry momentum in this game is so satisfying with your attacks generally having some sort of movement property.

Legitimately some of the best movement mechanics and physics I've ever experienced in a platformer.

There's 4 characters with their own skills that completely change how you play the game. 
Lilac can pull a Rocket Knight and shoot in any of 8 directions with Dragon Boost and she has a double jump that has a slight hover with Cyclone. 
Carol has a variety of martial arts with a Wild claw for extra damage, wall jump like Mega Man X she can roll to damage enemies and gain speed, can get  a motorcycle to change her moveset entirely where she can backflip, boost and such. 
Neera has a wand to shoot ice projectiles from, she can cover enemies with ice and bounce off of them or shatter them and even skates at top speed.
Milla can build up murder cubes to either spam light attacks or shoot a big shot. She can flutter her limbs for a Yoshi style jump.

All characters also have basic attacks and this is my BIGGEST TIP when playing either Freedom Planet 1 or 2:
When attacking if you hit up or down will give you different attacks- and different attacks in the air. They're very, VERY useful and most people I've seen play ignore them and these are some of the more damaging attacks.

Lilac's up+attack is an uppercut that not only goes a bit higher than her jump, it does far more damage than her cyclone attack- and you can go right into a down+attack that is a stomp that also does a lot of damage.

Neera's attacks in the air are vital to her gaining speed, you can really, really make her go super fast and stay in the air a long while.  Carol's down attack is great for her gaining speed and her disc will help you get around the map or double team an enemy since you can attack while it's doing damage on it's own. 

I haven't played Mila but I know her changes are pretty big vs her in the first game. She can be more aggressive with more attacks for one and I think has more HP than she did previously. 



So the characters themselves have a ton to offer in terms of variety and replayabilty. 
The game itself (So far I'm only 4.6 hours in) is crazy just how much they packed in. Huge levels with tons of routes and spots for characters to use their skills to get around with. 
The game has much improved writing and  voice work over the first. That's not to knock what the VAs did in 1, I felt a lot of it was their equipment being so different - which isn't the case here. I wish I could explain that better, just know if you thought the story and dialog was a bit lacking in 1- 2 is does it all so much better. 


The game also has items to help or hinder your gameplay.
Hindering items are there to 1- challenge yourself and 2- get your bonus up for a higher rank. 
Potions & positive items will lower your bonus and your rank.
So if you have a item with a negative that boosts your bonus by 75% and you fill a potion to a full 5 you lose 25%. Tie that in with a no-hit bonus and you too can get the fancy rainbow S-Rank.

Or you can ignore all that because ranks don't really effect anything from what I can tell. 

The game feels, so good to play. I can tell I'm going to put a lot of time into this one over the years. 

The one gripe I think someone could leverage against the game is you have to play through the adventure mode once before unlocking classic mode. Classic mode being you just get the stages. But seeing how much work they put into this and how good it is? It's worth it. 


This is a heck of a game, they really upped everything in this, the art design and visuals are a big leap over the first game, the stages aren't cut into parts anymore and it's just one large stage with SO many routes to go through. They leave it up to you to explore or blitz through. 
The music is, so, good. 


Performance: 
What I really like is the game can run at over 60fps, I don't know all the numbers off hand but I know it can do over 144hz. 
Other good news the game can run on a potato, my laptop sporting a 5 year old i5 and a HD620 runs the game at 1080p/60fps just fine. 

Just make sure you have a good set of speakers, the music is worth it. 

Edit: 
The bugs I had in the review have been addressed & I beat the game as Lilac (I'm aware there's a 'true ending' but haven't done that. 

I think Freedom Planet 1 had better bosses & boss music  & FP2 has a level I'd equate to Sonic CD's Wacky Work Bench in terms of ""Really bad level design"" as it has teleporter walls that send you all over in a disorienting way. But that is just one bad level out of a ton of them and as a whole FP2 is a really great game with a lot of fun levels, great music & fun levels (except the 1). 
Tons of replayability and I'm sure in a few months I'll have a bunch of hours racked up & will be revisiting this like Sonic 3 & Knuckles since I first got that.",1663226321,1664268877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The center conflict deals with heavy themes like genocide, cultural erasure, and the ethics of warfare without coming off as cheesy or edgy while greatly expanding the mythos, lore, and fleshing out the culture and identify of Avalice. Merga comes across as a cunning yet broken person with actual motivations for what she does rather than simply being the evil big bad. Despite the serious tone, the game features a lot of funny jokes and witty comedy that never breaks pace and helps to round out the mood in between drama. Each playable character gets unique dialogue and cutscenes throughout their own playthroughs that frames a narrative for their struggles and motivations. Voice acting is thoroughly improved in both delivery and consistency; everyone sounds fantastic without a single instance of wince or cringe and cutscenes don’t overstay their welcome. This includes the previous VA’s and professional talent like Christopher Sabat of Dragon Ball fame. A plethora of new and returning characters help to add personality and charm to cutscenes. Every criticism of the first game’s story was taken to heart here and for repeat playthrough the story can be skipped with classic mode. 

Like it’s predecessor, the game offers a mix of highspeed platforming, exploration, and combat across 24 levels and 4 playable characters each with their own unique movesets. Movement feels more fluid and easier to keep due to a reworking of the skill meter and abilities that allow for greater vertical height. A new dodge button allows skilled users to avoid damage and parry damage back if timed right. Lilac remains speed oriented with her dragon boost now cancelable, Carol can climb walls and use a throwing disc while her bike doesn’t break apart, Milla has a normal health bar and can quickly summon alchemy cubes, and newcomer Nera is slower but uses frost arts and focus to freeze enemies and unleash powerful attacks. This gives each character their own utility and playstyle which gives each playthrough a fresh but familiar challenge. Stage design feels better adjusted to player momentum, physics, and abilities which gives each level a more polished feeling. Unique environments, platforming gimmicks, treasure boxes and boss encounters make for a lengthy campaign with enduring replay value. Once unlocked, the battle sphere allows for unique challenges and boss rematches, which help unlock a special ending and secret stage. 

Bosses remain a key focus of the game, with most stages having at least one encounter and some stages being entirely devoted to boss fights. Unlike the first game, these are more strategic in nature with better attack patterning and a greater focus on movement. This results in many fights acting less as slug fests and more like combat puzzles. These are still very challenging encounters with later bosses offering exceedingly difficult fights. For several fights this does equate to chasing down the boss to damage it and overall, I feel encounters are weaker compared to the first game. This is especially true for the final encounter against Merga, which lacks the fast-paced frenzy of Lord Brevon’s showdown. It should be noted that boss encounters are still a fun challenge, just different from how the first game offered them. The block button helps to make encounters feel fair. 

In Adventure mode, levels are accessed across an expanding tile map that also includes hubs housing shops and interactable NPCs. They feature new dialogue after clearing certain stages and help to make the world feel more interconnected and alive. Shops are connected to the new item  and ranking systems; trinkets found in stages or bought at shops can either ease difficulty or increase the challenge. Examples include items that can increase player health or kill the player upon taking damage. Aid will reduce the gem payout after clearing a level while challenging items increase the payout and award a higher rank upon completion. Rank is defined from C to S rank, which is determined by items, the number of deaths and continues used, and damage taken. Potions affect gameplay statuses like shield points given or player speed without affecting score. This system allows for more robust playing options for casual and competitive play. Upon beating the game, a Museum opens that allows players to spend gems on models of bosses fought and trivia on the game’s development. Progression is more linear in Classic mode, with a basic level select and universal store option between levels. Lives reset each stage, with continues bought using gems after lives are used up. A new reviving system lets players restart after dying with only a sliver of their health left to clean up mistakes in a pinch. Difficulty options allow for the rules to be customized, like adjusting how many gems are used to revive or turning off these options entirely. 

The game features gorgeously detailed pixel art reminiscent of the Sega Saturn with a lot of rich colors and highly animated sprites and occasional polygonal elements. Character sprites in particular are much more vibrant and expressive with a lot of personality. This is seen in the game’s photo mode, in which any paused frame can be turned into a photo with unique poses available. Levels and hubs feature rich backgrounds which blend Asian and Filipino architecture and science fiction. Some sprite scaling can become blurry when the stage scrolls out, which adds to the retro charm but can be distracting and should be optional. With a greater focus on melody and atmosphere, the soundtrack offers a less high octane score compared to the first game. This will be disappointing for those that enjoyed the first game’s OST, but this is largely down to preference. The game’s score is still impressive with over 90 original compositions that offer a rich sound. My only criticism would be that many boss themes lack the same intensity found in the first game but overall, the soundtrack is phenomenal with many call backs and leitmotifs to the previous game. Personal favorites include Shade Armory, Ancestral Forge, Lilac’s theme, and the boss themes for Magma Starscape and Clockwork Arboretum. 

At launch, the game featured few bugs and an overall astounding level of polish. Updates for the game have been constant, with continued tweaks and bug fixes. A few recommendations I have would be for additional rank and par times to be present when selecting a stage, for classic mode to be unlocked by default rather than rewarded for beating adventure mode, and for greater item customization. A late game use for gems and currency would be appreciated as well. DLC offering more playable characters and levels would be a godsend.

After nearly 7 years in development, Freedom Planet 2 acts as a near perfect sequel by expanding what worked and improving what didn’t in the first game. This title matures the franchise into its own unique identity that surpasses it’s own inspirations to become one of the best side scrolling platformers of all time. This game raises the bar for indie works and leaves high expectations for a potential Freedom Planet 3. Easily 9/10, please buy this game and support the developers.

That's a lot of content, considering the other  character routes that await me someday! For now, though, I'm content after playing my heart out over two days.

Probably my only nitpick is that the action gets a little too chaotic when there's a ton of regular peons in your way, but everything else was fabulous.

While having the time to do game development responsibly and fill out features is good, this also costs a lot of money and can lead to things like game engine changes, a lack of direction clarity from leadership, or just a game coming out far after it's relevant star has shone.

I am overjoyed to say that Freedom Planet 2 is a game that was worth that long gestation period. 7 years of passion has lead to a game that by and large smooths over it's original's roughest points, fleshes out it's world, and comes out as a speedy platformer with excellent pacing as a first-time playthrough with plenty of reason to revisit the game thanks to the combination of it's various difficulty modifying item loadouts, levels that adopt the multi-tiered and routed style designs of it's inspirations, and the 4 different characters to take through what is a dense indie title.

I am very glad Freedom Planet 2 didn't shy away from narrative beats after the harsh criticism that the first game became bogged down in it's melodrama and overly long cutscenes. They still are here for Freedom Planet 2, and the much more brisk 'classic' mode is locked behind first-time game completion. However, I think that Freedom Planet 2 thrives in it's adventure mode now, with a narrative that is far less uneven than the first Freedom Planet, and one masterfully broken up between delivering lines through radio banter, having hub areas to fill out lore and character interactions that would have been a cutscene in the previous game, and keeping things brief save for the climaxes of Freedom Planet 2's 3 act structure. although so far I've only experienced Sash Lilac's path, I'm even more endeared to the characters here then I was in the original game, and I'm excited to delve into the other three girls' paths through the game, hoping that the likes of Milla and Neera get as much fleshing out as Lilac does here, given how... personal of a story this suddenly becomes to her. Also, it should be noted that there's clearly much more emphasis put into the quality of voice work, with much of the FP1 cast reprising their roles and feeling much more comfortable in them. Andi Sina in particular sounds much more comfortable in her role as Carol Tea and less like she's recording from a bathroom. Also, I need to give a special shout-out to Merga for being... so much better of a villain than Lord Brevon. while the intergalactic warmonger did his job and provided that fun gutteral growl, Merga is a tragic figure who provides some much needed pathos to the journey and also has some amazing moments of her own.

Freedom Planet 2's gameplay does much of what it's predicessor did; channeling the energy of Treasure co. ltd's seminal works in the 90's into a shell that is much more Sonic the Hedgehog like. I would say that Sonic Mania is a game that has since stolen some of Freedom Planet 2's thunder if not for the fact that Sonic Mania director Christian Whitehead contributed level design to FP2. The cast all has wildly different ways of traversing the multi-tiered, winding levels and dealing with the frantic but fair blasts of bullets, blades, bees, and bombs that tend to fill the screen in spectacular fashion, with Lilac being a speedster with a Rocket Knight Adventures inspired Dragon Boost to really get her going and offer her tons of invincibility while moving fast. Carol is a swift combatant with wall jumps and an acrobatic disc she can throw and teleport to and a motorcycle she can ride, while Milla shoots telekinetic projectiles and cubes that she can use to propel herself and flutter about like Yoshi, while (playable) newcomer Neera muscles her way through enemies and freezes them to use as platforms and the like.

I'm also happy to say that presentation-wise, Freedom Planet 2 feels SO much more cohesive, with chinese artist Tyson Tan's art style giving Avalice the glue that the original game was missing. seeing the variety in NPCs and the way Tyson's redesigns of the cast came together was a big joy, and I popped so hard seeing the likes of the director's dog (Sammi Diduro) working at the museum, or characters who are clearly fursonas or mascots of various devs throughout the adventure (Verse for example, is the composer's fursona, or Libbie being a mascot Tyson Tan designed to be... I think Huion's mascot?) 

There's so many cool and very... 90's sorts of graphical pops... things like line scrolling to create the illusion of 3D with the many, MANY layers of parallax, the zoom in and out of the camera as needed, the stage that clearly is meant to be a Super-scaler that made me think of afterburner... there's so much smooth pixel art animation and explosions and cool VFX going on at any given time and it's SO stimulating, but never overwhelming.

Of course, Audio is pitch-perfect too, with SO many numerous bangers or songs that use lietmotifs from Fredom Planet 1 to flavor them. I remember being super impressed with one of the levels in the Suigang arc having a bit of the Lord Brevon theme weved into the harmony of the piece JUST as I was getting to a part of the level that had remains of the invaders from the original Freedom Planet coming back. ALong with the frightened tone of Dawn Benett's delivery upon seeing it struck such a powerful chord of... what fighting a war like that must do to a hero seeing their nightmare come back.

Freedom Planet 2 has so much love and care put into it. it's why I felt it nesessary to put out this review and implore you all; PLEASE Play this game. yes, it came out a bit hot and maybe needs a couple of minor bugs fixed, but FP2 has SO much dang content and awesomeness in it.

Freedom Planet 1 is a game that is near and dear to my heart, so I'm going to be reviewing this primarily as a comparison to the first game. I've played 5 stages with Carol and tested out all the other characters within the tutorial and first level.

[b]Visuals:[/b] 👎 
The artstyle is very distinct from the first game. I can't really say that I appreciate it after playing the FP1 so much and associating all the characters and whatnot with the old artstyle. It doesn't feel like a natural progression for the series's artstyle in the same way that something like 2D Sonic games have evolved. I do think all of the new assets look great in a vacuum, but the first game's artstyle was so striking that this feels like a downgrade. It doesn't help that the higher pixel count sprites end up making the game blend in with other indie games going for a similar look. I get the impression that whoever made the decision on the new artstyle wanted to distance themselves from the Sonic and Megaman X inspired artstyle of the first game. I feel like it's kind of too late to do that though.

[b]Music:[/b] 👎 
The music is very much a mixed bag. Some of the songs sound really great like the new Dragon Valley remix and Shade Armory. Other songs though are either unmemorable or feel unfinished. The boss themes I heard in particular were quite a disappointment. Even with the songs that I like though they don't really have the same appeal as the FP1 OST. They end up feeling overly busy and not as cleanly mixed as the songs from the first game. It seems like some of the songs from the beta/alpha have remained unchanged in the final game as well like Bakunawa 3, which is still just a 46 second loop. The end result of all of this is that the music quality feels very inconsistent throughout the game. [i]Especially[/i] compared to FP1, which I felt maintained a very consistent level of quality throughout its OST.

[b]Mechanics:[/b] 👎
For the most part the entire cast controls really well. There's just a few mechanics that I personally disagree with. The game has a guard button. This was something that was in the demo I played a few years back and I hoped it was a placeholder mechanic but I'm sad to see that it's still here. I'm not a fan of ""press button to negate damage"" mechanics as I find them to be unengaging and promote a passive playstyle. And that's exactly what they do in this game. The timing for the block is [i]very lenient[/i] (despite NPCs dialogue's attempts to convince you otherwise). You can pretty much just stand in one spot and keep negating damage as long as your timing is half decent. I wouldn't have an issue with this so much if I could just ignore it like the bullet time in Katana ZERO, but it is ingrained into the game and so you will need to use it. FP1 did not have a block button (unless you were Milla, but that's a different kind of block), so all bosses were designed for you to avoid damage by moving out of the way or using invincibility frames. Not the case here. Boss design in this game is far more loose and cheap as a result of the guard mechanic existing. Pretty easy to design bosses that you can call fair when you give the player a get out of jail free button. I could harp on this mechanic for another paragraph, but I'll just say that I don't find it very interesting or engaging and leave it at that.

[b]Level Design:[/b] 👎
The levels don't feel as tight as the ones from FP1 from what I played, and you can feel it from the very outset of the game. They feel kind of empty and bloated sometimes, and convoluted and mazelike some other times. I think there was another review on here that echoed a similar sentiment. I do think the level design picks up after the first 3 levels, but I never really felt like it got as good as the first game's levels. The end level bosses also were pretty underwhelming from what I played. Apart from the boss of the 5th stage they all felt more like minibosses from the first game. Speaking of which this game doesn't have those. The structure from the first game of Act 1 --> Minor Boss --> Act 2 --> Major Boss is gone. You just have level and then boss here, and the bosses are generally just random big robot, while the bosses and minibosses from the first game often had a story reason for existing. Overall levels are shorter and more bite sized in this game, but they have a lot of empty space and glorified hallways.

[b]Camera:[/b] 👎
I like the idea of FP2's camera as a proof of concept. FP1 had a single viewframe for the whole game that never zoomed in or out. It could be kind of claustrophobic in a few places, but I didn't find myself minding it too much. FP2 attempts to fix this issue by implementing a camera that zooms out depending on how fast you're going, allowing you to see more of what's ahead. You can adjust how far the camera zooms out in the settings or turn off the feature completely. The downside of this is that it makes those pretty hi-pixel sprites look like total garbage, and you often can't hardly tell what something even is supposed to be because the pixels are so crunched when it's zoomed out. I really don't think it's a good idea to put control over the camera in the player's hands in a game like this. A better solution would have been to handcraft the camera according to the level design: zoom in during the slow and complicated sections and zoom out during the high speed sections where the player is expected to go fast. Instead what they've done is implemented is a clunky system that tries to automate the hard work of proper level and camera design away and fails at it.

[b]Polish:[/b] 👎
It's quite buggy. Within the first two hours I found more bad geometry that I was getting stuck on than in the entirety of FP1. There was also someone complaining about the controller glyphs, and yeah those are screwed up as of writing this. Game feels rushed despite taking so long to come out, and honestly that's what I was expecting. I'm not going to say it's Duke Nukem Forever levels of bad or anything but it feels like it's within that territory.

[b]Voice Acting:[/b] 👍
From what I played it seems like they got almost all of the original cast from FP1 back to work on this project. There are some replacements like Gong and Syntax, all of the major VAs still seem to be there. The VAs for the new characters sound good as well. I really liked the amateur VA cast from the first game and I'm very happy they've returned to work for this project. I think they do a pretty good job in their delivery for the most part. However I can't really say that the spritework always does the voiceovers justice. The original game had that problem from time to time as well, but I feel like it's exacerbated here because of the more zoomed out camera in most scenes. This segues into my next complaint which is...

[b]Presentation:[/b] 👎👎👎
The presentation in this game is a wreck when you compare it to FP1, and I think it mainly is due to the overambition of FP2. There are text only dialogue boxes now, which weren't a thing in the first game. In FP1 whenever a character opened their mouth you got voice acting, and they were able to pull that off because of the smaller scope. In FP1 you would go through a level and get a cutscene. Rinse and repeat until the credits. Here you also have towns segments (that feel completely pointless) and have NPCs to talk to. When major characters show up as NPCs to talk to they don't get voice acting either. You don't always get a cutscene after each level like in the first game, and some levels seem to have no place within the story of the game either (Tiger Falls is just a level you go through to get to another city). I can't make myself expect less when the first game set the bar for my expectations.

Would you look at that, I’m out of space. Can’t fit anymore. No conclusion segment, sorry. I’m going to try and refund this.

Still intend to play the other characters. I also played a ton of the first game and considered it one of my favorite 2D platformers ever. If you haven't played the original then this may not be quite as good a review for you, but if you're at all a fan of fast, action focused 2D platformers and don't mind a challenge then definitely go for it.

Pros:
-Music slaps as expected
-Movesets of characters are expanded from the original, Carol's shuriken is very fun to use
-Love love LOVE the level aesthetics and variety, every level feels super distinct and always challenges you in new ways, and some just look amazing
-New interactivity with NPCs and world map is minor but helps make the game feel more grand
-Nice ways to customize your difficulty and character using handicaps or potion buffs
-Sprite work during story conversations are more expressive, and general dialogue is more enjoyable

Cons:
-The story did its job but I failed to get too invested in it. This may be due to the character I chose (Lilac seemed to be more integral than Carol). The main antagonist's motivation was more relatable than the OG game's Brevon, but from Carol's perspective she's very one note
-Main gameplay critique: your character's volatile moveset and the more intense levels backfire on the game a bit in that it makes the game very hectic. It's very easy to lose your bearings and struggle to find the exit to a level segment for a bit, or miss items like hidden collectibles or life flowers that you'll need to keep yourself alive.
-Limited view around your character can make some bosses annoying to keep track of. One boss in particular I found myself waiting until they entered my view because pouncing around the arena looking for them would put me at risk of taking a hit.
-This game is surprisingly difficult on Normal, partly for the reasons listed above. I would definitely recommend either playing on the easier mode or allowing yourself whatever buff items you can find on your first playthrough. The lives system is more strict this time as well so you may find yourself replaying some sections fairly often.

Great game so far. Worth the wait. My only problem so far is the button display issue. It shows the PlayStation icons just fine, but it displays 1,2,3,4 for Xbox and Nintendo. Not to mention, the icon says to press the right d-pad button to talk to NPCs when I have to press up instead.

Another issue is with menu navigation. Since I'm using an Xbox controller, I've mapped Lilac's standard attack to the X button and her Dragon Boost to B. Unfortunately, since these buttons are swapped at default, resulting in pressing X instead of B to go back in the menus. Other games have button mapping options for menu navigating, so there's potential to patch it. Not a large issue but not a nitpick either.

In the end, the wait was worth it! The characters and the world are charming and the controls are buttery smooth. Love the Full Metal Alchemist reference in it too.

It's a great game, it really is. Gameplay is improved over the original, the accessibility options are great for people like me who forget to dodge and keep dying, music is very old-school 90s SEGA, and all the playable characters are fun to control... 

But in regards to the story, specifically near the end... I have a very personal gripe... 

They shoehorned some identity politics into the story (No, not talking about the playable characters all being girls. That doesn't bother me and has never bothered me about this series). And what's sad is that the story up until the very end was good... and then... they just... throw a curveball in regards to something we REALLY DID NOT NEED TO KNOW about the main villain.

I wouldn't be harsh about this normally, but I've been bullied by those exact kind of people, even to the point of breaking down mentally. Ever since that started with me a few years ago, I've not really been cool with a character all of the sudden and out of the blue just... ""coming out"", especially the way the main villain was after unlocking the true ending.

Again, the game is good. I'm not taking that away from the team who made it. However, because of IRL things revolving around identity politics, that one detail near the end soured the story for me. Unlike a series like Sonic, Freedom Planet is very story-heavy. You can't play the game classically untli you beat the story.

The game oozes polish, love and care all the way through. Gameplay has gone through a number of improvements to suit the chaos and better define itself as a mixture between high speed platforming and breakneck combat. Boss battles are as exciting as ever, and the levels are tons of fun to go through. Even the story mode, despite actually being longer than in the first game, is far better paced and is better at respecting the player's patience, on top of just generally having better written dialogue and dynamics. The voice acting I don't think was ever bad but it's definitely at its absolute best here.

This time around in the art department, Tyson Tan lends his distinctive art style and designwork to Freedom Planet's cast and world, and there's never been a better fit- it's clear they want to use his work to help define the visual identity of the series. Overall, Freedom Planet 2 just reeks of ""we figured it out"" energy across the board- this is a good thing. The first game was an excellent experience that felt 80% there - but this game feels like it has properly realized how to establish its identity as something truly unique and remarkable in its own right. Everything feels more purposeful, planned, and adds up to one of the most fulfilling gaming experiences I've played in a minute.

To say I'm addicted is an understatement. For anyone worried about a lack of content, don't be. This is 20+ full-fledged levels, each with their own themes and ideas they used to the fullest. Four playable characters all with their own distinct gameplay identities and feels - Sonic/Knuckles/Tails scenario this is not - the way you approach combat, speed, and platforming with each character is completely different. Items that allow you to customize your character's stats or play the levels with a tighter challenge. A ""Battlesphere"" mode which not only lets you rematch individual bosses but contains new arena challenges and obstacles courses for you to beat your records on. A sparring mode that lets you fight other characters in 1v1s or smash targets within a time limit. There's just so much here and it's all very well-thought out and meaty.

I can see some not liking the ""cringe"" story like with the first game (read: they're boring people and just hate a fun time) or the long, highly involved levels, but everything comes together for me in a way that feels remarkably solid, refined, and entertaining. It's just a blast and I invite anyone who loves action platformers to give it a try. But please, I implore you, don't go into it treating it like it's Sonic, and don't play it like it's Sonic. Because it's an entirely different beast - some things in common, but it must be tamed anew.

それぞれアクションや戦闘スタイルが異なり、ステージや幕間での会話、展開が変化したりキャラ固有のイベントが描写されたりと４人分のフリーダムプラネットを楽しめる。
気になったキャラから順にクリアしていくもよし、４キャラ並行して進め全視点から物語を楽しむもよし。

[b][i]LILAC[/i](DRAGON)[/b]
おさげで周囲を攻撃しつつ空に舞い上がったり、指定した方向に無敵状態で突進できる。正統派主人公。ストーリー上重要な情報を含む固有シーンが多い。
[b][i]CAROL[/i](WILDCAT)[/b]
壁を蹴って登れる。攻撃速度が速い。バイクに乗ったり、手裏剣(?)を投げたりバイクも投げたりする。自由奔放で表情豊か。固有シーンが最も多い。[strike]推し[/strike]
[b][i]MILLA[/i](HOUND)[/b]
一定時間耳をパタパタさせ空を飛べる。緑色のエネルギーを喚び出し敵に撃ち込んだり、盾にして飛来物を跳ね返す。ステージクリア時にキャンキャン鳴く。

氷技を扱い、ダブルジャンプが可能。クールビューティ然としているがわりと気が短い。[i]CAROL[/i]からの呼び名は『おっかないお姉さん』。とある登場人物の意外な一面が見られる。

[i]LILAC[/i]の突進は再入力で別の技に派生しその場に持続的な攻撃エリアを残す、[i]NEERA[/i]が氷技のひとつで生成する氷柱は[i]MILLA[/i]のように飛来物を跳ね返し、踏み台にすると高く跳びあがれる等、基礎チュートリアルでは説明されないテクニックが多々存在するためメニュー画面のGuideを読んだりプレイを通してキャラ知識を深めるとルートのショートカットや各ボスに適した立ち回りが可能になり攻略の助けになる。

多種多様なボス戦は歯ごたえのある設計。初見ではしばしば圧倒されるものの、繰り返し挑戦しパターンを把握、それに合わせた戦い方を構築していくことで次第に動きが洗練されていく。手強いボスのアクションを見切りスムーズに倒せるようになった際の爽快感も本作の大きな魅力。

クリアランク、ランタイムがステージ毎に記録されるため、一度クリアした後もより高いランク、クリアタイムの短縮を目指してやり込みを楽しめる。最高ランクは色違いのS(ボーナス100%以上のハンデ装備でノーミスクリア)。

基本モードがマップ型となったことで今までは舞台装置の域を出なかった都市や国などを実際に訪れ、そこに住む人物たちと交流できるようになった。クセのある性格だったり、可愛い仕草をしたり、特徴的な口調だったりと皆個性的。
セリフは感情に応じ文字が震える、跳ねる、大きくなる、色がつく等の表現が成され、より豊かな人物像の描写に繋がっている。

just beat Lilac's story and hoo boy is it a ride. i'll have to beat the other character's stories to see where they diverge, but for the most part all of them stick together as a party.

that said, if you hated FP1's level design, you will loathe FP2's design. not my problem, however, i actually love the fuck out of this since it's more than ""hold right to reach the finish"" and offers rewards for more than just simply ""reaching the end of the level as fast as possible"" and while i did do that with Lilac, i'm definetly going to take my time with the rest of the cast that isn't her. there's so many secrets i have yet to collect so that'll be a while.

did get softlocked on one boss but that was during Day 1 and it was easy to just restart the fight without closing the game. kudos for making a solid game that has some (even if unintentional) anti-softlock measures.

the art and music is absolutely amazing. 10/10 would gawk at a boss and drool at how they look again. Lilac handles pretty good but definetly will take time to actually master. will edit later when i have beaten the game with the others.",1663178122,1663178122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It was colorful, amazing soundtrack, had the pixel graphics I missed a lot and had a great personality to it. Sure, the dialogue oftentimes got a little cringe, but it was an indie game. Fast forward to now and in the sequel they improved upon pretty much everything. The dialogue still tastes the same as the previous game which may throw some people off, but it's cute if you try to embrace it. 

The graphics are bloody amazing. Some levels have like four levels of background scrolling and it looks incredible in action. There are sooooo many little animations and details. The water even has animations when you interact with it. I know how difficult it is to make pixel art and animating, so the fact they managed to cram so much of it in here is amazing, and with FOUR playable characters that are nothing alike. Even the music, just as the first game, remains catchy as heck. 

So yeah, definitely get this if 2d games are your thing, the levels are much bigger and more elaborate than the first game's, and overall amount of content and polishing is exactly what you'd want from a proper sequel.

Highly recommended buy to fans of action platformers.

Compared to the sequel it has a ton of new features, modes and content. There are many challenges and the achievements are really fun to complete. The engine is different from the original and thus more robust and stable, I had only very minor technical issues with setting my controller and nearly getting stuck in an area but these are easy fixes and to be expected from a project of this size on release day. I had no major technical or gameplay related issues otherwise which is a lot more than you can say from some AAA titles.

There is a ton of character variety and replayability, tons of music that all sounds great. The artwork is beatiful and if it interests you there's many cutscenes and hubworlds with NPC's that are almost entirely voice acted. If that's not your thing it can be skipped more or less in its entirety.

I'm singing the game's praises here because it's really just that good and I think there's something here to enjoy for everyone as long as they enjoy platformers at least. The game also has a very good difficulty curve but if you find it too hard there are items you can use and game settings you can enable.

If I had to give it a score I'd give it a 9/10 so far. It's engaging, challenging and just plain fun. Definitely a must-buy from me.

EDIT: I have now finished the game and it definitely changed character in the end-game. The quality of the level design fell sharply after the first 2/3rds of the levels and even with 7 years of work the later levels feel like they are padded and they lose their sense of direction in a few places. The first game had much better end game both in design and story and the last boss left me feeling quite unfulfilled. The game as a whole is still a definite recommend from me and there are plenty of great parts to enjoy in the mix but I'd probably drop my score to a 7/10.",1663164734,1663626938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I'd absolutely reccommend it, and the story actually had me on the edge of my seat in some moments, which is a far cry from the basic story of the first game. There were a couple weird bugs at launch, primarily in regards to how fast the game updated at framerates higher than 60, but those have all been ironed out by now (Nobody needs to fight launch day Turbo Askal)

You don't even really need to play the first game to play this one. While it certainly helps, the game's story stands out on its own enough and the first game's story wasn't really that memorable anyways.

On the other hand, I couldn't appreciate the red stages quite as much. They felt like shallow and repetitive boss fights that require the player to wait too long for an opportunity to attack rather than give their best. Even more if you're playing on Expert and looking for an S rank as Lilac, whose move set isn't as compelling as other character's. What's worse is a part of the game has quite the streak of red stages and cutscenes that would be a pain to watch were it not for the quality voice acting.

|Not the only game that's like this... but I'm absolutely unable to identify the cause.

Scratch all of the above (Windows 10 did a small oof, or maybe just my computer), I've since gone through and S ranked almost every mission, the only exceptions being the true final boss and its re-fight.

I've never had a game get my adrenaline going so hard that I had to step away twice on the same level, really brought out my warrior's spirit.

I can describe the gameplay best as a mix of Sonic, Rocket Knight/Sparkster, and Gunstar Heroes, but improves on all of them significantly. The movement and combat is fluid, and unlike Sonic where you take damage on enemy contact (which slows the pace to a crawl if you're trying to avoid damage) enemies have to land various telegraphed attacks, giving you an opportunity to dodge, parry, or attack, making it feel a lot faster paced/less stop-and-go.

The other bug i'd like to address is the performance drop in levels that are affected by lightning, basically levels that have ""darkness"" in them make the game run with less fps for me.

But early impressions of this game haven't been great for me. The new pixel art is incredibly gorgeous and detailed... Unfortunately to the point where it's actually hard to see what's going on while playing. I've noticed far more bugs in the first 3 stages than I have in the entirety of the first Freedom Planet, frequently clipping through terrain and objects, weird audio quality drops in VO, and on the very first boss somehow triggering a bug that made me invulnerable after I was supposed to die. Most of these can be fixed with a patch, though the cognitive overload of the pixel art may be difficult to patch. The thing that I think can't be patched though? I'm just overall having way less fun with this game than I did with FP1. The level design and combat just *feels* off to me. Combat doesn't connect and have that same crunch that it had in FP1. The levels feel far more convoluted and frustrating to navigate than the first game; I find myself getting lost far more frequently than FP1. As a once or twice thing I'd say that's more on me, but this was a constant struggle for me in the first 3 levels I played.

[h1] 풍부하고 재밌는 스토리. 전작의 문제점도 다수 개선되었다. [/h1]

[h1] 퍼리 팬덤이면 사라. 「모든 로망」이 들어있다.  [/h1]
[h1] 그야말로 ""퍼-리덤 플래닛"" [/h1] 



전작인 프리덤 플래닛 1 이후 7~8년(?)정도가  개발에 소요된 후속작.

가속의 메커니즘은 전작과 똑같되, 좀더 유연하게 이동방향을 바꿔 가속을 잃지 않도록 다양한 바리에이션이 추가되었다. (특히 캐롤 특수기 활용이 굉장히 유연함.)

어느정도 게임 이해도가 있으면 엄청난 가속을 게임 내내 유지할 수 있고,  처음해보는 유저도 가속을 느낄 수 있는 구간이 다수 존재한다.

보스전도 적당히 타격하기 어려우면서, 광역패턴이 있어 방어기를 적절히 섞어 써야하는데, 이것대로 나름 재미가 쏠쏠하다.

초회차 플레이시, 몇몇 보스가 너무 과하게 어렵다 느낄 수 있으나, 모두 파훼법은 있으니 천천히 해보길 바란다.

이번작 보스전은 실력이 고이면 고일수록 재밌다. 배틀스피어에서도 보스전 따로 연습 플레이 가능하니 참고하길바란다.


그래픽은 전작에서 대폭 개선되었고, krita의 마스코트 아티스트인 tyson tan좌도 참여해서 아름답고 수상한 캐릭터들이 매력적이다. 

기본적으로 픽셀그래픽도 상급으로 꽤 디테일하면서도 수려하고 밋밋하지 않게 색감을 잘 주었다.

보스 디자인은 주로 적당히 뽕차는 동물- 메카닉 느낌이니  취향에 잘 맞을 수 있다.

보스들의 액션도 벽타기, 레일타기 등 연출적으로 다양하니 보는 맛이 더 즐겁다.

심지어는 너무나도 쌈마이한 3단 합체변신 동물롸벗까지 나오는데, 디듀로는 진짜 신이다..

각 맵 디자인도 비주얼 면이나, 각종 다양한 기믹이 있어서 지루한 틈이 없다.

맵의 볼륨도 대략 20개정도 넘어간다. (거의 30개에 육박한다.)



음향적인 부분도 전작에서 담당했던 woofle이 한 것으로 알고 보증은 확실한 듯. 

전작 음향이 빵빵 불려주는 요란스런 일렉트로 느낌이었다면, 이번에는 테마에 맞춰 좀 더 리드미컬하게 맞춘 느낌인데, 다소 밋밋하게 들릴 수 있으나  충분히 좋다.

개인적으로는 닌텐도 게임 음향 느낌 들었었음.



스토리는 전작에서 부족했던 컷씬, 서사를 다량 추가했는데, 전작에서 넣지 못해 부족했던 캐릭터성이 대폭 보충되어 개꿀잼이다.

겉멋충, 빡대가리 듀오, 변신로봇 로망충 별의별 놈들이 다나와서 그야말로 세상은 요지경.

플레이어블에 진지충 캐릭이 있긴한데, 별의별 웃긴 캐릭터가 다 나와서 오히려 케미가 또 좋다.

더빙은 전작과 마찬가지로 마을맵 상호작용을 제외하고는 전부 풀더빙인데, 3년후 배경일지라도 전작의 앳된  보이스액팅으로 전개되니 이부분은 호불호가 갈릴 수 있다. 

개인적으론 아이들 우당탕탕 대소동 느낌에 세상은 요지경 스토리가 잘 맞는 느낌이라 호였음.

※박물관 맵에서 개발자 말에 따르면 본래 스페이드도 플레이어블 예정이었던 듯 한데, 
   '또' 스케줄을 맞추다보니 취소된듯 해서 아쉽다. 박물관에 모션 데이터가 있으니 참고.




개인적으로 특히 맘에 드는 부분은 전작에서 제기된 문제점들이 개선된점.

부족한 튜토리얼, 아쉬운 그래픽과 보스디자인, 스토리가 본게임 템포를 막는 점을 개선한 점이다.

튜토리얼은 본편 시작전 선택해서 직접 조작해볼 수 있고, 

스토리는 본편이 끝난 이후, 혹은 스토리 진입 전 허브에서 짧게 더빙과 함께 틀어준다. 

인게임 상에서도 건볼트의 라이브 노벨의 느낌처럼 틀어주는데, 여러 게임을 잘 참고했다.




[strike] 단점은 아직 출시된지 하루된 게임이라 그런지, 최적화가 부족한 모습이 보인다. 캐릭터가 많은 허브에서는 프레임 드랍이 간헐적으로 자주 느껴진다. [/strike]
※최적화 문제가 개선되었는지, 이제 허브 맵에서 렉 안걸림.




플레이타임은  순수 게임시간 3시간 30분,   스토리 포함 총 게임시간 10시간이 걸렸는데.

이는 내(숙련자) 기준이고, 초심자면 순수 게임시간 5~6시간 혹은 그 이상이 걸릴 수 있다.

서로 완전히 다른 특징의 캐릭터도 4명인 점을 감안하면,,

모두 플레이 할 경우 순수게임 시간은 20시간 이상 소요될 수 있다.





소닉, 건볼트, 록맨류 게임 팬, 스피드런을 매우 좋아하는 사람이라면 초갓겜이니 강력 추천.

최상급 조작감과 물리엔진의 가속&관성에, 재밌는 스토리, 아름다운 픽셀그래픽, 리드미컬한 음향에, 풀더빙 + 고봉밥 분량까지. 

30000원 안부른 현재값도 엄청난 혜자다.   솔직히 30000원 주고 사도 안아까움. 

수년동안 농땡이 친게 아니라 정말 마음을 담아서 개발한게 느껴지는 게임.

클래식 소닉의 명맥이 거의 끊기고,  록맨류의 정신적 후속작도 거의 나사 하나 빠진 개떡으로

나오는 현시점에서 정말 어떻게 이렇게 나온건가 싶을정도의 소닉류 명작 게임이다.

괜히 클래식 소닉 개발자들이 보고 배워가야할 게임이라고 말하는게 아니다.
(클래식 소닉은 이미 소닉 매니아에서 거의 끝났다고 본다만 말이다..)





[h2] +)가속 메커니즘 정보 추가  +  장비 및 아이템 설명 [/h2]

공통 - 전작에서 점프하면서 완만한 벽모서리 닿으면 천장 붙기 + 이동 가능했는데, 
           일부 지형 한정으로 막힌듯합니다.

캐롤 - 1. 이동 中 점프 다운킥 연속 사용시, 가속 있습니다. 
               (이 덕분인지 전작보다 바이크 의존도가 많이 낮아서 좋습니다.)
          2. 이동 中 점프 업킥 연속 사용시, 호버링 같이 떠서 좀 더 공중에 있을 수 있습니다.
          3. 가속에 공격속도가 비례합니다.  기본딜 약한대신, 딜레이가 짧아 방어사용이 매우 유연합니다.


라일락 - 1. 전작 대비 큰 변화 없음.  
              (내리막 경사면에서 점프 다운킥시, 있던 최대 가속이 너프된 감이 다소 있습니다.)
                 ※Tip.   점프+(↓+점프[사이클론]) 쓰고,  직후 다운킥 하면 내리막 최대 가속이 좀 더 쉬워집니다.
              2. 특수기 취소 직후, 스페이스바를 누르고 있으면 바로 방어대쉬 가능함 
                   (모자란 거리를 채워줘서 드래곤부스트 의존도를 다소 줄여주는 감이 있습니다.)
                   (특수기 취소시, 생기는 잔상에 있는 딜을 보스전에 자주 이용하도록 합시다.)
              3. 점프+다운킥 中 공격키 연타시, 좀 더 연타 딜링 가능합니다. 올려치기를 함께 사용합시다.


밀라 - 1. 전작과 대비해 큰 변화는 없음. 
              (아래 대각선으로 슈퍼실드버스트를 쏘아 반동가속을 했던 전작과 약간 다릅니다.)
              (수평방향, 내리막일시 위방향, 점프필요시 아래방향으로 유연한 가속이 가능합니다.)  
              (수평방향 반동 가속시, 점프가 너무 낮거나 너무 빨리쓰면 가속이 안되고 위로 붕뜹니다. 약간 높이 있게 뜁시다.)
              (전작과 마찬가지로, 평지면 밀라가 최대가속 도달이 가장 빠릅니다.)
           2. 니라와 같이 공격중, 유연한 방어사용이 어렵습니다. 실드를 자주 사용합시다.
           3. 제자리에서 근접공격 연타 + 방어 직후 슈퍼실드 버스트를 통한 딜링도 가능합니다.
 

니라 - 1. 스페이스바 특수기 + 점프 2단공격시, 가속이 가능합니다.  (그 외 가속법 없음....)
               (캐릭터 자체가 파워형 캐릭터인 영향이 큰 듯 합니다.)
           2. 스페이스바 특수기 사용 中 게이지가 조금이라도 남은 경우, 
                ↑ +C,   ↓ +C ,   C 특수기 사용 가능합니다.
                 스페이스바 특수기 中 적 공격시, 게이지가 조금 회복됩니다.
                가속 뽕 전부 뽑은 다음 ,  ↑ +C로 모자란 점프력 보충 가능합니다.
                 C를 잘 이용하면 어려운 퍼즐구간에서의 꼼수가 가능합니다.
                 C는 일부 소형 보스 또한 얼릴 수 있습니다만,  보스에 따라 지속시간이 짧습니다.
                  ↓ +C는 주로 딜링보다는 점프력 부족 구간에서 쓰입니다.
           3. 기본공격 후딜이 매우 깁니다!!!!  캐롤, 라일락과 달리, 유연한 방어 사용 불가능함.
                기본 딜이 쌔지만, 정확한 딜링 타이밍을 노리는 플레이가 요구됩니다.
           4. 점프+올려치기 타격 시, 공중에 더 오래 있을 수 있으며, 추가 타격 가능합니다.
                공중 보스, 공중 몹 잡을 때 사용합시다. 공중전에서 내려찍기 효율이 안좋습니다.


+)아이템 관련
 1. 포션 - 소모품 아닙니다!!!! 이름만 포션이고 영구 사용 가능한 장비입니다!!! 꼭 사세요!!! 
                포션 최대 5가지를 조합해 캐릭터 기본 능력치 펌핑이 가능합니다.
                조합 사용 가능한 장비인 점에서 나름대로의 재미있는 스피드런 빌드가 가능합니다
                꽤 신선하고 재밌는 게임 시스템임.

 2. 장비 - 주로 플레이 편의성 개선에 집중되어 있습니다. 
                체력UP, 초반 특수 아이템 제공(바이크 등),  기본 5원소 쉴드 제공  등등.
                그 외
                캐릭터별 갖는 원소속성으로 도트데미지를 주는 element burst
                방어시, 공격을 돕는 클론을 소환하는 shadow guard

 3. 쉴드 -  의외로 전작에 있었던 무적효과의  레인보우 쉴드가  있습니다.
                 단, 상점에서 레인보우 참을 사서 착용해야  랜덤... 으로 등장합니다.
                 아쉽게도 쉴드 발동할 때 나오는 jingle sound 가 없습니다...",1663111557,1665330923,True,16,0,0.653796076774597168,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It mixes in stage elements from Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles, and even some aesthetic from Sonic Adventure 2 even though it's not a 3d game. The combat mechanics also have a modern feel to them where stage bosses feel like stage bosses, and it can take a little bit of effort to get the patterns & mechanics down. It's not as brutal as something like Hollow Knight, but brings that same vibe that has graced a lot of the platformer & metroidvania genres in modern time that makes the battling a part of the game. This makes a lot of sense from a design perspective considering that there is more emphasis on non-Lilac game play.

This game was a solid buy out of the gate, and it remains that way as they have continued to drop patches to fix bugs and tweak based on feedback every day since the release. 

-------------- Original Review -----------------

Freedom Planet returns for a 2nd entry finally after many long years. It still holds the same charm as the first game with a bunch of new features, a new character, and new levels. The game's medium difficulty feels right, and for players who struggle there are assist options available such as auto-guard to not exclude anyone. This makes this both an incredible throwback to the era of 2D Sidescrollers, but also an easy title to jump into, or even have children play if you set up the accessibility options for them. 

I did have a bit of an issue getting used to the default control scheme, since it feels like it's from the Playstation 1/2 era, but the good news is there are options for changing bindings if you're really frustrated as well! Worked out of the box with a PS4 controller directly connected.

Additionally it seems like there may be some bugs that haven't been fully worked out - I killed the boss on the second stage & got the achievement for killing it with dragon boost, however the stage didn't end, and it was then further immune with no health bar. After letting myself die and go back to the checkpoint, killing it the second time worked without issue, and hasn't impact any other level so far.

Overall, this is a solid buy and I'm glad I bought it at release, it was worth the wait!",1663107888,1663457730,True,3,0,0.523912131786346436,0,True,False,False,True,,,

+ The game plays great, solid 60 fps even with browser and discord open (God knows how a pixelart game can lag your laptop but this one isn't)
+ The gameplay is nice, I really like this ""combat x beat them up"" feeling. The replay value is also a fresh step, since the first game, the battlesphere and challenges are fun, I really apreciate that.
+ The game is controlling great, the guard button is a big improvement.
+ The art. The art is bless to the eyes, the art direction is perfect (East asian culture enjoyers like me will surely enjoy it) The chara design is on point, all the NPCs and characters are charming.
+ Kudos to the music too.
+ The story seems interesting and easy to follow, for now I can't really say much, as I'm still far away in the game.

My only complains for now are:
- I have hard time understanding the voices, espicially Neera's. Her voice seems a bit muted compared to the others.
- You have to complete Adventure mode to unblock Classic mode wich is a downside.

So... Is this game worth? Yes, yes and yes.

And so far, it has far far FAR exceeded my expectations, it's so much more than I had hoped and improves upon the previous game's mechanics and flow so much more!

I absolutely love the new load-out/item system which either lets you makes things easier, harder or just gives you a unique kind of challenge for each level. For my first run through each level, I always go item-less and then when I try to beat it again I try it with the items to make it more interesting. That already adds so much to the replay-ability. 

Love the hidden unlockables and the sweet to talk to NPCs all around. So far it's been great and I hope to keep playing and finish the game with each character!

Freedom Planet 2 это пример очень качественного сиквела, который расширяет и углубляет как геймплей оригинала, так и сюжет (лор) в целом. Боевка приобрела несколько новых фишек, добавлены элементы ""прокачки"" которые помогут в прохождении или наоборот, дадут немного хардкора, давая в награду прибавку кристалов в конце уровня. Сюжет в традициях оригинала, только с большим количеством действующих лиц. Озвучка персонажей стала гораздо качественней по сравнению с первой частью, из-за чего она ещё больше доставляет. Имеются небольшие баги, но они не критичны + немного поломано отображение кнопок геймпада, например - кнопка ""вверх"" показывается как ""влево"" и т.д.
Если вы фанат первой части - уже должны иметь у себя в библиотеке.
Если вы не играли в первую часть - советую пройти первую и приступать к этой.

Freedom Planet 2 is familiar, yet adds so many new things that are expanding on its predecessor's ideas and contribute to cement the series as one of the best Sonic-inspired games out there.

Coming from FP1, the controls are refined, more responsive and as fast paced as ever. The levels are huge, sometimes intricate, and most often than not clever in their designs and gimmicks.  

The true show stealer though is the world of Avalice itself, that can now be visited extensively through a Mario-like overworld map with hubs sprayed up here and there, filled with NPCs commenting on the plot and the state of the world, providing the titular Freedom Planet a depth that the original game could only scratch.

- The sprite for the ""inactive state"" of the spinning enemies in the first proper stage is a bit messed up at 240 FPS. 
- In the [spoiler] Corazon fights [/spoiler] you can stand on the upper edges of the arena and avoid getting hit.
- [spoiler] Cannons [/spoiler] are bugging quite a bit for me. I get stuck in walls often, to the point where I had to abandon a [spoiler] challenge in the Battle Sphere [/spoiler]. Gonna wait til that's fixed to finish it.
- At high refresh rates you often times don't bounce off the wall after dragonboosting against it but slide up the wall vertically (I tested it. It happens at 240 FPS but not at 60)

[b] Some things I'd wish for: [/b]
- I play on a 240hz monitor with Vsync on, cuz it feels much much smoother and better than the 60 FPS u get when Vsync is turned off. Would love to see some option to manually lock the FPS to certain values without having to enable Vsync at the same time (maybe at least 60, 120, 144, 240). [b] [EDIT: has been added!

The gameplay was so much more faster and energetic this time, at least that's the case with Lilac because I mainly played as her so far. Got a lot of Sonic Rush vibes which is a massive plus because I LOVE those games! The story was actually really entertaining and dramatic, which is great because admittedly the plot in the first game was one of it's weaker elements. The music and sound-design ARE SO GOOD, I plan to buy the OST in the future if it wasn't released already, because I often found myself turning down the sfx and voices to listen to it. Really reminds me of Jet Set Radio (and a lot of Hideki Naganuma's work in general).

Freedom Planet at one time divided Sonic fans into two camps. The first saw a solid game with their own style, the others turned on the morons and started yelling about plagiarism and parasitism on Sonic ... which, in fact, has long gone to shit. However, Freedom Planet has received the recognition and love it deserves, building up a fan base that is finally looking forward to the sequel.

[b]Plot[/b]

The story starts three years after the first game. The grown up and prettier heroines are attacked by unknown robots that destroy their house. Forced to cooperate with the royal nobility, they investigate a series of incidents involving the same robots, which slowly but surely leads to key events.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Compared to the first game, the combat system has been noticeably upgraded here, adding a defensive move, as well as lowering the limitation for old abilities, allowing the use of much more advanced attack combinations.
The levels here are divided into two types:

1) Combat - where we have to run through vast locations, making our way through their unique opponents in order to defeat the big bosses at the end.

2) Urban - the most beautiful residential settlements with many characters who are ready not only to talk, but also to trade.

In addition to the standard levels, there are also secondary activities, such as an arena with various modes, among which I especially liked a kind of PvP analogue that allows me to push the protagonists head-on.

[b]Graphic arts[/b]

Stunning sixteen-bit visuals have been pumped to perfection here, giving out not only magnificent detailed cities with civilians, but also combat levels, each of which lives according to its own laws, always remaining in motion.

[b]Soundtrack[/b]

The musical accompaniment of Freedom Planet immediately wanted to add its own playlist and the sequel took its well-deserved place in it. The soundtrack not only harmoniously combines with peaceful towns and dynamic levels, but also literally caresses the ear from the first seconds, and the sound effects are my respect.

[b]Results[/b]

Freedom Planet 2 perfectly demonstrates to us those rare cases when the sequel not only does not lose the dignity of the original, but also multiplies them many times over, making literally everything better. This is a true creation of people who love their work and their project, and this same love does not let go even after a complete passage, as it was with the first Freedom Planet.",1663090835,1663090835,True,21,0,0.618661642074584961,0,True,False,False,True,,,

expect a few bugs occasionally, like losing speed on a weird slope or getting soft locked in some rare cases on some stages, but nothing that could ruin your experience as a whole. i’ve enjoyed all my time spent playing this game, even while playing through the story as each character just for 100%ing (i wouldn’t mind some extra achievements though, perhaps for some lesser known challenges like [spoiler]rainbow S ranks[/spoiler]).

This game not only means a lot to me and some of my friends, but I would be certain enough to say it is even a contestant to my favourite game of all time. So of course, to express al the love I feel for this game, I shall prioritize my negative criticism first!
Wait-

- Some sounds are, like, LOUD, REALLY FREAKING LOUD, LIKE HOLY F**K, more specifically some bosses’ screams but also with stuff like several bombs exploding together, I could lower the volume, sure, but then the game would be too quiet for most of the time.
- Music does not loop in some areas. This is a more major gripe, it can kill the mood in some areas, I feel. Sometimes it is not too bad, but there are many areas (usually Lobbies) were music just stopped for no reason and it made me have a poker face for a couple of seconds.
- The items. Oh, dear… The items. Like, I find cool that you can “choose your own difficulty”, but why does hard mode have to be linked to two items? It kinda ruined experimentation for my first play-through because I wanted to play it in hard mode right off the bat. I honestly wouldn’t be complaining about this if the taking double damage and no revives mechanics were separated from the item system, or if we had 2 negative item slots separate from positive item slots.
- The potions. Great addition to the game, except I didn’t get to use them until late game because I seriously thought that those were 1-use only. I am unsure if there’s some kind of explanation somewhere in the game about how potions work, but I would have appreciated if I got told from the start about this system.
- Vsync is on by default. According to my Bible this is a sin.

Okay so now for the praises.
*Holy Cungadero is this game good*. This is a huge glow up from the first Freedom Planet: the playable characters have a much more unique and diverse moveset than before, there’s a lot of lore and story  to enjoy that explains a lot about this game world’s culture and past, music is fantastic (just like the first game), and even the main antagonist has a much deeper personality. And oh boy, don’t get me freaking started about the artstyle and pixel art… First of all, the entire game’s sprites has “Tyson Tan” written all over them (not literally), and when I got told that this guy was helping in the art department of this FP2, I knew it was gonna look good, but even then, it surpassed my expectations, making my jaw drop a couple of times. What the art and graphics department of Galaxy Trail has achieved is pure freaking magic, I tell you, hahahaha.

I could keep praising each individual part of this game, and every single thing I loved about this journey, but I think I already wrote a long enough review.

Pour Freedom Planet ce serait une insulte de le réduire en tant que bon Sonic like, dés le début on sent qu'on est pas sur le même niveau que le 1, je n'ai joué que Lilac pour l'instant mais je suis déjà convaincu dés le début, le fun est bien présent, c'est beau, c'est drôle et la bande son est géniale comme pour le 1er.
Le jeu à 4 persos jouable avec un mode histoire pour chacun d'entre eux,
Un mode gallery sous forme de Hub en 2D qu'on peut explorer,
Une world map interactive ou on peut explorer certains lieu et parler avec PNJ,
C'est bien plus qu'un simple Sonic like.
Foncez c'est juste un excellent jeu.

Si vous êtes toujours pas convaincu regardez cet extrait d'un niveau avec Lilac, si vous aimez Sonic, vous ne pourrez pas résister.
