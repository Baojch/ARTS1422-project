It is worth the money listed though its obviously better when on sale, though it is perfectly fine to skimp out on the Fields Expansion if you're a little tight on money, it doesn't add much. I would also recommend you play this while listening to a podcast, gameplay is simple enough to listen without getting too distracted. What you see is what you get and if what you see doesn't interest you, you are perfectly entitled to skip this entirely, you aren’t missing out on anything life changing. That's all you really need to know.

Well, If you do want to read more of this, I have some more to say about it, Starting with some personal experience! I found out about this game allll the way back in 2014-2015 from watching Lathland’s let’s play on it. I REALLY liked what I saw and ended up directly downloading it to my computer from the website (I didn't really know about Steam at the time.) so I actually have many more hours in it than what my steam number indicates, actually, come to think about it. It might be one of my earliest PC games if not the first PC game I had outside of Spore. So it has something of a special place in my heart, not crazy about it, but it was an important step for me.

When my mom first saw it, she described it as “overly complicated Asteroids (the game).” and that's not too different from what it actually is. The gameplay loop is fly around, shoot the enemies, gather resources then build ships and start all over. The game gives you literally nothing out of that, no tertiary gameplay loops, no story, nothing deep. There are others that might demark it for having nothing interesting, for having no stand out elements that makes it fantastic. But I dont think Reassembly is striving for that, it is well put together, runs well too, and has addicting gameplay it isn't super ambitious and that allows it to dig deeper on what it already brings to the table. The fights are quick and fun with all the different weapons each faction has. And the ship building has a lot of subtlety that isn't immediately obvious, not an extreme amount of subtlety, but enough where I learn one new building tip everytime I pick up the game again. 

Compared to another top down spaceship battle game, Starsector: where you're constantly thinking about your vents, your fleet composition and the cost of running your fleet, how much you can field, what you can sell for money. In reassembly: you just have to worry about power and you rarely have to think too hard about it outside of where to put it safely, and you can just make more ships from resources and sell resources for money. Oh and your fleet costs nothing to maintain and can be as large as you want it. In simpler terms, reassembly is a much more casual game than Starsector. But that doesn't make one better than the other, I love both for each their different strengths. Sometimes I want to Hussle in outer space. Sometimes i want to blast through outer space

In conclusion: reassembly isn't something ill be shouting from the mountaintops for, it is something il play 2-3 times a year and enjoy thoroughly not a experience that's super valuable but a fun  thing to play while listening to a podcast.
And remember one thing, other players will always make prettier ships than you!

AI方面：像是基础的寻路/攻击/采集等AI行为可以加强，目前的AI确实有点呆板，或者可以设计一个简单的AI编辑器，让玩家自定义AI行为模板应用于不同类型的单位。

设计方面：增加武器的种类，增加一些可以研究的科技加成，目前游戏中单一文明组件的深度和广度都略显不足，希望可以设计更多的组件，或者可以打捞敌人的残骸作为临时组件，甚至可以设计商店购买组件，提高中后期的游戏趣味。可以让玩家自己设计空间站，玩家完成初期的建设后，可以设定生产计划，自动生产单位，作为可控制的下属单位。

玩法方面：区分无人机和下属单位以及盟友单位，无人机（组件有限，体型较小）根据设定的固定策略行动（例如：守护维修/巡逻索敌/采集等）；下属单位根据AI模板行动，必要时可以进入指挥模式进行RTS操控；盟友单位自由行动，玩家可发送特定信号请求援助。

内容方面：地图可以再大点，可以建设传送门进行远距离的移动；不同文明的势力范围可以在初期划分好，越接近文明中心敌人密度越大强度越高，还可以设计一些特殊的巨无霸战舰作为BOSS，通过更加强力的武器和更多的舰队区分不同的难度，甚至可以用不同等级的文明划分难度，平衡性可以根据 强度-数量-势力范围 做不同文明的平衡。

总而言之这是一款不错的游戏，与[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/465000/Event_Horizon/]《黑洞表面》[/url]相得益彰吧，相比之下《重组》更加自由可以让玩家的创意得到充分发挥，而《黑洞表面》则更注重游戏手感和攻击方式的多样性。能以简单的形式来体验太空的浪漫，就是此类游戏的乐趣所在。

Reassembly is an Open World, SciFi Space Shooter Roguelite where you build your own space ship, then drive around blasting other ships apart! Fun!

[h1]Combat Focused Space Voxel Carnage![/h1]
In Reassembly, combat is the clear focus.
Yes, the map is random, made with procedural generation, so you never know exactly what will be in any given point, but gearing up and blasting apart enemy ships is the real meat here.

Much of the map seems to be in an asteroid field, and these asteroids have collision, so try not to slam into them, but remember: these asteroids have collision, so they act as very durable cover to help fight the swarms of enemy ships.
This is future tech stuff, so you auto heal very quickly after crashing into asteroids, reassembling the ship rapidly, still, be careful, as taking damage makes it that much easier for a passing baddie to punch a hole in your hull!
Watch your hole space hero!

The Weapons feel good and different in Reassembly, often very different: think setting up arrays of plasma projectors to lay down creeping curtains of fire, or the Protein Beam firing off a narrow, concentrated beam of death in a narrow band, powerful, but tough to keep on target!
There are drone launchers, heat seeking missiles, point defense guns, short range, but continuously firing lasers, tractor beams, fast, but short range auto cannons; all have their place.
The big, boom boom boom of the plasma cannons is so fun!
Blasting ships apart here feels so good!

The weapons here in Reassembly drain energy to shoot, so you don’t have to track down ammo for missiles for each shot, like in FTL, letting you focus on the space combat, and not having to worry about space logistics!

Remember: you can only stuff so much onto your ship, so specialize it to accomplish the tasks you want, or don’t, and go more general purpose, but the more you put on your ship, the slower, less responsive, and larger and easier to hit it will be.

[h1]Progression Here Feels Good:[/h1]
You earn C (credits) by exploring and trading R; some kind of space resources.
You can upgrade your known schematics using c.
The amassed C is the meta progression, kept in between deaths, and used to unlock new blueprints for parts for your ship.

The ship builder here is Excellent.
You can build whatever you want on your ship for no cost nearly instantly; you just need enough build P (points?) on the ship.
When you die you respawn, but you lose all your on board R, not your C; fair.

Controller Support is present, as is good old mouse and keyboard.
I found Reassembly felt much better and more responsive with mouse and keyboard, so that is what I used in the above video.

Anyway, Reassembly is an Open World, Sci-Fi Space Shooter Roguelite where you build your own space ship, then drive around blasting other ships apart! It’s so good!

射击的手感、光粒子特效极其舒适，对我来说，扫射爆炸的效果比3A大作还要爽。
没有严重的死亡惩罚，舰船受损可自动重生，让游玩没有太大压力，玩家可以尽情遨游宇宙
飞船设计交互简单容易上手，可以让玩家尽情挥洒想象力
丰富多样的飞船武器部件，可以打造出多样的战斗流派
可以生产小船组成舰队，圆玩家的航母梦

缺点：
沙盒探索的内容匮乏，地图没有什么令人期待的东西，限制了游戏质量的深度和高度
交互是千篇一律的射、吸资源、拿资源点回基地升级买武器。参考其他宇宙开放世界的设计，有很多可以挖掘完善的点
没有剧情，游戏玩法搭配RPG叙事元素，除了造船，久了会空虚
没有联机，太可惜了，简直是为联机打造的游戏模式。
舰队根本跟不上主舰，一旦整个舰队高速移动，很快子舰都掉队，再也不会跟上来。需要回头在茫茫地图里一个个找到，花费点数重新雇用。极其痛苦

bug：
子舰队读档后消失，地图和指示显示舰队，但实际赶到却没有
左右方向失灵，需要反方向按一下，才能左右转弯



总结：
喜欢太空题材，喜欢造飞船的，买了绝不会后悔，物有所值，打折时就是超值。
若能提高制作水平，发扬优点，改善缺点，或许能成为泰拉瑞亚《Terraria》、环世界《rimworld》那样等级的作品，但是作者已经弃坑了，真是可惜啊。

TOP FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️ Building your ultimate spaceship.
⭐️ Harvesting resources.
⭐️ Destroying other spaceships.

THE UNIQUES:
💎 The realism when building your spaceship.
💎 The AI behaviour is spot on. 

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼 Building.
💼 Sandbox.
💼 2D.

PROS:
+ So many building elements, if you have a creative mind, you can build anything.
+ AI makes attacking and harvesting so much fun.
+ Graphics aren't great but it still has a beautiful atmosphere.

CONS:
- It's pretty easy once you've mastered the building side.

VERDICT:
This game is pretty darn good.... but only for a select few, you need to know how to build, without this, you'll feel clueless and probably won't enjoy this game. Luckily there's custom built spaceships for the players who aren't interested in the building aspect. With that said, you're literally killing the biggest purpose of this game, sure the attacking and harvesting is fun and the AI are smart enough to make your gameplay fun but you really need the building to get the most joy out of this.

Total Score = 71/100.

GAMEPLAY:
Players build their ships out of various geometric pieces, including hull, armor, thrusters, weapons, shield projectors, and various other functional components. Each component gives a unique attribute or ability to the ship. Reassembly's creative, modular ship building has been compared to playing with Lego.

The in-game world is a single large open ""galaxy"", populated with rival factions. Players progress through the game by collecting resources, building a fleet, capturing territory, and activating damaged space stations.

Ship construction works similarly where you have a bunch of blocks that fit together and can add weapons, thruster, and shield blocks that are functional and increase firepower, manoeuvrability, and defence respectively. But it's also way better because a) you upgrade to unlock blocks and don't have to find them (they add to the cost of building the ship), b) you don't have to fight others while you're building your ship, c) you can rebuild your ship with generic resources and don't start from scratch each time you get hit, and d) you've got a bunch of different blueprints, so you don't have to abandon a design to try something new.

Captain Forever is one of those games where you can have fun but it tends to be fleeting. Reassembly lets you capture that fun and play around with it more and tweak it. It's exactly what I've been looking for.

Add to that the factions and conquest goal, as well as other game modes that I haven't really looked at yet, and this is a great game.

The only downsides are that it's one of those games where the hours just disappear and next thing you know the sun has risen, but it also looks like it might get repetitive and I'm not sure what the engame is like.

- Das Reisen durchs Wurmloch bringt nichts außer einer neuen zu erobernden Galaxie, es gibt keinen echten Fortschritt

Why I recommend this-
It's fun! I can spend hours just lego-ing things together. Then I see how it works. Then I see my monstrosity fail. And its back to the drawing board. I found this game because it was similar to Captain Forever.

The game is beautiful. The visuals, as simple as they are are pleasing to look at. The music, when I turn it on is very chill. The controls are simple and easy to learn.

私以外からも沢山の報告があったので再現性も高いようです

このゲームは基本的に敵が全然強くないのでパーツやお金が集まってくるとすぐにヌルゲーになります
こちらは8000コストまでの艦を出せてしかも艦隊を無限に連れて歩けるのですが相手の艦はせいぜい単艦の1000～3000コスト程度の艦しかいません
しかも組み方もそんなに強くないので序盤からずっと無双状態が続きます

しかし本来はエージェントというほかのプレイヤーが送り込んできた刺客が現れるのでゲームに刺激が出るようですがそれが一切出ません
ゲームを再起動しようがリセットしようが必ずこのバグは起こります

これがどのくらいひどい事なのかというとダークソウルからすべてのボスが消えて雑魚敵しかいなくなったぐらいゲームが劣化します

极其高的自由度，十分丰富的游戏方式以及大量的可选种族（7种可选）让这个游戏变得十分耐玩。
同时，玩家可以通过向虫洞内投放自己的复制品来入侵其他玩家的游戏，当然，这个过程是随机而且不可控的，这点很遗憾。
更为遗憾的是国内目前玩家不多(因为没有汉化)，也组织不起来来场舰船大赛什么的（游戏内自带的模拟战可以实现大量舰船以1对1的模式进行擂台赛）。
游戏在前期积累时期有些浪费时间，同时后期装备研究完了规模也到8000了会觉得没意思，当然，这时候对舰船的设计或许就是玩点了，或者玩家可以换一个种族再来一遍从小船到大船的过程（击败其他可选种族空间站 工业舰可以解锁）。
7个可选种族都各具特色，玩法完全不一样，也就是说最次玩家也可以体验七遍不同的游戏方式。
虽然各个种族稍微有些不太平衡，但是玩家独特的设计可以挽回一些劣势（红色那个种族就算了吧...）。
最后，其他玩家想试试自己舰船设计的可以来找我，可以把自己的舰船设计存档给我，也可以向我要我的设计图，我一直期待着能够凑上足够的参赛者来一次国内的舰船大赛。",1698800737,1698800737,True,8,0,0.558688700199127197,0,True,False,False,True,,,

To master and max out every faction will take a little bit of work, if that's what you're going for, as sometimes there's a knack to the shipbuilding mechanics (or, for a couple factions, one 'meta' part) but with a bit of patience you'll probably get all of the factions finished, or at least most of them. I definitely liked a couple less than the rest myeslf, and going back to the first ships I designed gave me a good laugh in retrospect, as there is definitely 'some' though that needs to go into craft design. Put simply: there are good and bad ways to create ships, so there will be better and worse designs. Some builds might come more easily than others, and some races may take longer for you to crack them, but once you figure out a trick  or two for each faction it didn't seem too hard to me and was more about enjoying the ride and building up a functional fleet. Do you want a small number of large craft, or a large number of small craft, or something in between the two? I probably spent more than half my time playing this game building, re-building, and then tweaking my ships. 

Only negative point I'd like to make is that it seems the sector exit portals no longer work, so you're not able to upload your craft to the cloud or 'restart' sectors with the same factions - with that in mind, you might want to start with a very small sector to get the hang of the game, and then re-start on a very large map with plenty of agents, because you'll never be able to re-start your sector.",1698189549,1698189549,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

It's one of those games you enjoy but it's painfully so much worse than it should be. Its balance is basically non-existent and it would be so much cooler if you could orchestrate larger scale tactical warfare rather than being limited to fighting enemies in your immediate vicinity with a small group of craft.

The fact that the player is a specific craft rather than being in command of their faction was possibly the worst decision that could have been made for this game, as it could have been so much more. RTS gameplay with this kind of stuff would be incredible. The geometry is also a pain - if you want to build anything interesting with most block pallets expect to find that you have bits that just can't connect absolutely everywhere, leading to fatal weaknesses in your craft - some kind of flexible part that was less cost efficient to fix this would have made building cool stuff that was also functional much less of an absolute nightmare. There are also occasional physics bugs which can launch you long distances.

All that being said, I have enjoyed the game. I did have to use mods that increased the maximum zoom (default is tiny), modded and reworked factions, maximum craft size (to compete with these new threats) etc.

The music is smooth, serene and gets a kind of arcade action vibe when in combat.  Its a bit confusing at first, but with the very to the point and quick tutorial its always easy to jump back into and get that old feeling back within ten minutes.  The game takes place in a galaxy which you can customize a bit each time you start with different sliders, you'll start out as a small but capable ship in one of the many factions who all have their own ship parts ranging from nukes to powerful sword like short rang laser weapons.  Some factions are even focused on growing the games plant resource that ALL the factions use, which may sound overpowered but what they have in resource generation they lack in firepower. 
   
  You can probably get a good 5-10 hrs of game play in before you'll get bored and start a new faction with all new parts, weapons, shields and strategies.  With factories you can create fleets and even build space stations  (which is done by building a ship without thrusters).  This is a solid game that honestly is worth at least 20$ in my opinion as I have over 265 Hrs logged.  The only downsides I think id point out are the lack of campaign (which to me doesn't matter) and that when you start producing a ton of ships (100+) the game can slow down to a crawl.

The game is relatively good for what it is the combat is good albeit simple the building whilst jank at times is decent
The only real downside to this game is that it has no end game objective outside of reaching a wormhole or destroying all the agents on the map and when you reach a wormhole there's not much to it ouside of regenerating the world and sending an agent to another player If the devs really wanted to fix this game i'd change the station spawning mechanics and have a single wormhole at the center of the galaxy (or multiple around the center) with a boss guarding the wormhole/wormholes i'd also change the wormhole sequence with a little animation and then it regenerates the world with new tougher enemies but you get to start as a different faction and the end boss is your previous ship/ships Agents would still spawn randomly across the galaxy but they would spawn inbetween the core and the outer ring where you start.

I finished the game in under 8hours and considering that the game costs 15dollars, that's a steep value proposition.

You're really just repeating what you did in your 1st playthrough, but with a few new module pieces. But, overall I can still recommend the game to anyone who likes these 'Spaceship Constructor' ARPG games because it gave me 8hours of enjoyment, although I usually want to get more than 1dollar per hour out of a game, but I'll let it slide this time... so yeah, it's a good game, not fantastic, but certainly something that I can recommend. It hasn't received an update in over 300days, so development is likely dead, which sucks because there's certainly ways that the game could be improved still, and another issue is that the game is for sale in russia, but you just have to consider those two things when thinking about supporting this developer.

Still, what I can guess from my playtime and when I purchased the game, I was eight and really into commanding a fleet of spaceships and building a massive ship capital ship. I distinctly remember naming a ship the S.S. Chornobyl because of how explosive it tended to be; it was my capital ship, and from my hours played and a vast amount of achievements for this game which are eighteen achievements out of twenty-four, so not that many compared to to other games I own but still cool. When I played the game last, which was relatively recent, the magic that the game held was all but gone. I uninstalled most of the mods I had and tried to play through it again as the starting faction, but when I realized I had unlocked everything, there was no real point in playing that faction when so many others were available didn't feel right. Then I played through the basic tutorial for another fifty-six minutes and got off. That same day I also looked through the comments and reviews and noticed the developers last updated the game quite some time ago, and I mean a long time. But this doesn't bother me. Sure, it's sad, and it sucks that they didn't update it when people enjoyed it, but I moved on. I grew up, but I respect that some people still want to play it; that's fine, but its lack of updates doesn't bother me. It had its heyday in 2015, and it's not worth your precious credits anymore, but thankfully for many, this game most likely sparked their love of games that have similar mechanics or allow for an equal amount of creativity. I feel this game put a tiny seed in my brain that blossomed and made me enjoy playing a game like No Man's Sky™ so much, but sadly, my ability to build good-looking vehicles in most games is completely gone. But I recommend this game for gamers ages 6-10, and I think it perfectly fits that age range. It is so simple, yet from what I can understand from my playtime, it's entertaining for people of that age range. Although if you are older than that and still play this game, that is fine. However, I believe this game helps sprout creativity in little ones as it did for me, and as games become all the more commonplace as a leisure activity, it's a good idea to research what games are suitable for young minds and I think this one is great for that purpose. It also helped me form my obsession with space and my love for sci-fi. Sure, it's a pretty basic place to start, and there are probably better games for ages 6-10, but at least it's something!

[h1]BUGS[/h1]
1.- Si tienes el STEAM que se inicia al iniciar la PC, cierra el steam y posteriormente activa el juego. Si no lo haces el juego aparecerá como si no hubieras iniciado session a pesar que el STEAM este activo.

2.- Si tienes a tu flota y eres la nave principal, Cierra el juego de la siguiente manera.
Guardar y salir/ SALIR (cierre del juego), Por que sino aparecerás sin tu flota y como si hubieras muerto y vuelto a renacer en alguna estación cercana, en la cual tendrás que volver acumular dinero (conocido como ""C"") o material (conocido como ""P"") para rehacer tu flota en la cual podría tomarte tiempo según la cantidad de naves en tu flota anteriormente.

 В итоге всё это формирует довольно простой в понимании геймплей, в котором может разобраться каждый, и не нагружающий мозг с расслабляющей космическо-электронной музыкой, где вам нужно собирать корабль из блоков как конструктор.

 Вы можете играть и за другие фракции - у каждой из них есть свои особенности и недостатки например: фракция Землян (Терранов), у них универсальный ассортимент комплектующих корабля.
 У Фермеров ну они могут выращивать растения которые вырабатывают ресурсы для новых кораблей но это компенсируется слабыми двигателями ну и так далее.

 В этой игре всё ограничивается вашей фантазией: вы можете стать адмиралом космического флота, стать кораблём фабрикой других кораблей, вести мирную фермерскую жизни за фермеров ну и так далее.

I call it 'little' because its sparse linear graphics and general simplicity make it feel like it should be called that.

In Reassembly, you build ships out of blocky components, subject to specific in-game constraints. You then set sail and gather resources, upgrading to more powerful components, creating better ships, and commanding a fleet of your own design as you scour the map eliminating the enemies in their different colours. That's basically the whole idea, but the variety afforded by the customisation is fantastic. Your fleet is your own, and plays the way you want. 

There are different civilisations with different technologies. There's a sandbox mode for even more creative freedom. But the core of the game is this building and flying, and it's satisying on its own. It's also a game with quite a relaxing pace and style.

You get the idea. You will spend 95% of your time building your ship/s, but testing it and seeing the AI in action is always rewarding. Don't expect a good campaign, that's not where (most) of the fun is at. The real deal is trying to build the most badass ship that can beat them all when doing your tests and exploring, and then go to the Discord server where the real challenge begins. People there are very welcome to newcomers. Jokes and humor is always present, and they host seasonal tournaments (which I just attended one and got to the semi-finals). People there still struggle and are still learning with their ships designs despite being veterans. It's been a long while since I had this much fun from a videogame.

In short, a spaceship building game that let's you explore your own strategies and creativity. Everything wrapped in with neat soundtracks that will immerse you into the building and exploring mood.

シューティングは苦手。

（＋）：チュートリアルがある。タスクとして表示され、未実施のものは画面にでる。
（＋）：勢力が多い。それぞれの勢力で使える部品が異なり、1勢力でもかなり多彩な船が作れるが、飽きたらっほかの勢力で更に造船が楽しめる。
（＋）：造船ポイント集めが楽。ポイントで大きめの船を作るのもいいし、あんロックされた兵器を解除するのもよしで、飽きがこない。
（＋）：勢力MODが豊富。
（＋）：造船が簡単、かなり直感的に作れるし、ウインドウズみたいにコピーはｃ、とかわかりやすい。
（＋）：艦隊を比較的かんたんに作れる。自機が船を作ってその船がまた船を作ってと設定次第で、自分ことみの兵種艦隊が作れる。
（＋）：テスト戦闘ができる。自分が作った船をオートバトルで他勢力の船と戦闘させることができる
（＋）：同系統の部品でも必ずしも上位互換ではない。重量やスペースが異なるので、下位の部品でも使い道は必ずある。
（＋）：作った船の保存・呼び出し（インポート、エクスポート）が楽、しかし、デスクトップ直保存だったりするので、専用のフォルダを作ったほうがいい。
（△）：コマンドが多くてアクション等が苦手な人は少しきつい、しかしチュートリアルでプレイすることになる。
（△）；基本的には1勢力の部品しか使えない。MODを使えば全勢力可能。
（ー）：造船の画面で、選択しないと全重量がわからない。武器の全エネルギー量がわからない。
（ー）：武器の性能（消費E、射程、発射間隔）はかかれているが、武器単体でのテストはできないので、テスト戦闘や実際に装備して使わないといけない＝自分の思った通りの武器なのか、造船画面を閉じなきゃいけない。
（ー）：艦隊を作る場合、自分に資源容量がないと造船ができないので、自機を比較的多くしないとやりにくい。自機は小型艦とかにはしにくい。

造船部分は楽にやれて、艦隊を組んでの戦闘は画面が色々な光が飛び交い綺麗です。無理に戦闘することもないのでアクションが苦手な人でも楽しめる。造船中は重量とスラスターとエネルギー量を考えなきゃいけないのでそこそこ頭が疲れます。",1673242672,1673261511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

宇宙船を設計するので小難しいことをやらなきゃいけないと思ってて、約５年程ウィッシュリストに入ったままだったReassembly。
実際宇宙船の設計は全く難しいことは無くて、船体のコアと動力源と姿勢制御スラスターの配置、他に兵装を外殻（ボディ）でくるむだけ、本当に図形の組み合わせだけでオリジナルの宇宙船、いや戦艦がデザインできる。

最初は自機が脆弱でしんどいけど、次第に操作に慣れ、資源をこつこつ回収しつつ、強力な装備をアンロックして、どんどん自機を強力にしていく。
その過程で面白いのは、最初のうちは「やばい逃げよう」と思ってた相手が、そのうち十分に対抗できるようになり、いつしかこっちから獲物を求めて徘徊するという、どっちが侵略者か分かったもんじゃない展開になっていく。

当初、艦隊というものは艦隊リストの上の４枠だけで４隻編成しかできないものだと思ってた。
そんなことは無い。
マシンのスペックさえあれば、１００隻以上の規模の大艦隊を編成して画面を埋め尽くすほどの凄まじい大軍で敵対する勢力の拠点を襲撃して、ぺんぺん草のひとつも生えないどころか天体の地表自体を消滅させるほどの攻撃も可能。
※ただし、「マシンのスペックさえあれば」と言及したとおり、私は１５０隻前後規模の艦隊で宇宙旅行をしていたが、壮絶な戦闘風景になると俄然処理落ちする。

自機以外の機体を操作する必要はなく、自機の移動に応じて艦隊は随伴し生産能力を持つ艦艇は勝手に味方を増やしていったりする。
敵対勢力に対して、大艦隊で四方八方から攻撃が飛び交う様は正にスペースオペラ、銀河英雄なんとかっぽい。

２Ｄグラフィックで慣性飛行をしながら、彩豊かなパーティクルをちりばめた大宇宙を縦横無尽に駆け巡りたい人用ゲーム。

▼以下、残念ポイント
①ワームホールが通行できない
リリースから年月が経ってからこのゲームで遊び始めたため、現状はワームホールから別宇宙に行こうとするとサーバ接続エラーが出て、次の世界の開拓ができない・・・これが自分にとっては致命的だった。
サーバ接続エラーになるだけで、どうやら自艦隊情報だけはサーバに記録されているため、よく分からない。

②最初の勢力の使いやすさが異常
ひととおり初期に与えられる勢力で宇宙を散策し終えたら、別の勢力でプレイすることも可能になるが、これら別勢力の設計機体がクセが強すぎて、初期勢力ほどの爽快感が期待できない。

③ひとつの宇宙を荒らしつくすと・・・
本当にやることがなくなる。
延々稀少勢力になった別勢力の発生を見つけては、まるで蚊をつぶすように掃討するだけ。

Конечно же бамбер из рассеивателей по 10
Тесты показали что не хватает скорости... а нахуй огнестрел, все равно ни я ни автоматический огонь не попадает, педаль в пол ни шагу назад, размазать крыс по бамперу!
Тест пройден
Какую сделать следующую модель?
Наверно увеличить скорость и бамбер!

The develper has announced he's aware of this but has given no ETA on a fix. And in his own words, nor does he prioritize it because he's just had a baby and has more important things to do. Except he's still happily taking your money for a partially working game. Steam should not be selling it.

I used to have ideas after playing flash games in my youth that are similar in design to this. What if this were just bigger and better? Like a dream this game answered that question. It would be awesome and it turned out according to my playtime this is something I needed. Its a simple, laid-back experience that manages to be extremely satisfying and addicting. The game is exactly as advertised. So, if you didn't like what you read then you might as well move on, but if you needed some convincing or reassurance I will help.

+ Simplicity. The premises are simple and brilliantly executed. You start as a small ship in your faction. You need resources known simply as R. So, you get them by either picking some up from farms or destroying anything that isn't on your team. Your ship is built out of blocks that are interconnected after returning your R to a station you can redesign your ship using cash. During combat pieces that are disconnected will fall away, but don't worry intact pieces can be tractored back in and reconnected. Destroyed pieces regenerate. Bring R to your fellow stations and buy upgrades. Rinse and repeat till you conquer the whole map and become stronger and stronger. You should note that the enemy is doing the same thing.
+ Reassembly. As I explained previously ships regenerate missing pieces and can tractor in unused intact pieces that are lying around in the depths of space. After redesigning your ship will disassemble and regrow or recall those pieces forming the new ship. Dying allies can save your life as their intact pieces rapidly repair you. There is something elegant and immersive about these mechanics that makes being in this universe that much more enjoyable.
+ Designer. All ships are based on the core. If the core takes enough damage, you die dropping what R you were holding. Thus, you build around the idea that everything can be reassembled as long as the core survives. The interconnectivity of the pieces actually presents a lot of variety and strategies in the techniques you will use in your designs. Placements need to be actually considered because even though the game is 2D the game simulates mass accurately and exploding pieces can trigger dangerous chain reactions. Its pretty detailed and leaves plenty of room to show off some style as well.
+ Combat/Controls. A swappable set of control schemes are available for mouse aim. The main one is mouse aim rotation and wasd moves you relative to your mouse. Second is mouse rotation, but wasd is based on absolute screen directions. Third is for heavy ships that you want to aim freely with because rotation is bound to qe and wasd is relative to the ship. Combat is generally pretty simple left mouse controls guns, right mouse controls missiles and drones (can be customized). Shoot to destroy the targets core. It is incredibly satisfying chewing through enemy ships and even fighting with stronger ones that test your designs capabilities or fleeing from those who are stronger. The whole combat loop is just perfectly smooth.
+ Factions. Factions offer unique strategies in both building and combat. Some are specialized to certain things making things a little more interesting for other play throughs. Though not all are equal. Some factions are definitively weaker, but there is challenge and excitement in playing them as well.
+ Fleets. Once you get into a game enough to have some cash. You can recruit or even spawn fleet members that will follow you everywhere. This is simply implemented, but many factions can get powerful synergies from combining different designs or you can just use them as fodder in your conquest.
+ Agents. Around your little galaxy there are wormholes. You can interact with them and send your current fleet into either a new galaxy or upload your fleet to other players galaxies. Yes, periodically enemy player designed fleets will come out of wormholes and attack everyone they come across. These ships/fleets can often be more difficult to deal with. A nice fun way of introducing other players stuff to a single player game.
+ Mods. Mods are directly integrated as an actual part of the game. Starting in the form of new custom factions to play. New ideas are also implemented. The all-important shader mod has to get a mention because it makes everything gorgeous (""Splinters Graphics Overhaul""). In the end we get a fantastic custom experience. Even enabling brutally difficult challenging factions if you want.
+ Performance. Will run on any device smoothly except when you come across the dreaded plant faction. Then all of our computers are futile. There is a hard engine limit that is reached at extreme amounts of projectiles/missiles/ships. Better computers will make it higher, but ultimately nothing can be done about it.

- Single player. The game doesn't need it, but it would have been great to have some kind of real multiplayer.

Its always nice to have a little game like to rely on when you want to just have simple fun. Being usable on all systems is nice bonus. For me it functions as a Zen game. Its engaging enough to keep your attention, but its never too much to cause any stress. I love it and maybe you will too.",1656786804,1656787031,True,1,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False,False,,,

最初は3つ程度しか勢力が選べないが交戦することでアンロックされ最大７つの勢力から選んでゲームを始めることができる。
勢力によって特色があるがやることは同じで資源を集めて味方の基地（生産設備のある艦）に献上しポイントをもらいそれで船体上限を強化したりブロックをアンロックするだけ、損傷した味方基地（青い◇）に接弦し復旧させてもポイントが入るので慣れたら序盤に低コスト超高機動機体で基地巡りするのが効率が良いと感じる。
CPUはもらった資源を使い機体を生産し近寄ってきた敵を迎撃し資源を入手して・・・を繰り返し大きくなっていく。

最初の３つ以外の勢力は使えるブロックが少ない為似たり寄ったりの艦になりがち、なのである程度満足する艦が完成したら次のデータに進んで気に入ったデータで本攻略、が飽きが無くて済む。

注目ポイントは僚艦を引き連れて艦隊行動がとることができる上にそれらをオリジナル設計に書き換えることが可能、なので自分を最大クラスの戦艦、適当な艦を捕まえて僚艦に巡洋艦12隻、駆逐艦28隻を引き連れて銀河で大暴れすることもできる。
また、生産設備のあるCPUの生産先も自由に個別に設定可能、手間はかかるがスタート地点周辺は戦艦、宇宙外縁部は前線なので急造艦のみ・・・と言ったRPも可能。
また、それらのデータを用いて模擬戦が可能、大艦巨砲主義VSドローン機動艦隊等の面白い戦いも見られる（ただし個別操作は不能）

比較的精度の高い日本語訳がなされているのもとてもポイントが高く多少の誤訳・わかりにくい点も気にならない程（ランゲージファイルはとても分かりやすい形式なので気になる方は簡単に修正できます。）

気になる点としてはAIは時間制限常駐型のドローンを常時展開できなかったり連続照射型の固定レーザーをピンポイントでしか運用しなかったり想定していた運用思想を裏切ることがある点（AIが数種類しかない）
逆を言えばそれ以外改善点が見当たらない程とてもシンプルで完成度の高いゲームである。

某鋼〇の咆哮が好きな方は是非プレイして欲しいゲームです。

より強力な宇宙船を作って更に大量の資源を集めて…といった感じでどこまでも出来るのですが、
特に宇宙船構築の要素が良くて、ブロック一つずつ単位で自由に組み立て出来るので火力特化や機動性特化など自分の好みに弄れます。
拘って造るとあっという間に時間が無くなる要因ですね。
さらに作り直す前の設計も無駄にならず、低コストで生産できる機体として残しておき自分の艦隊に組み込むことも出来ます。
そんな感じで数を揃えた艦隊の圧倒的な物量で押しつぶす、という戦い方も出来るので攻略は難しく考える必要はなく気軽に楽しめます。
また、使用できるブロックの違いから特徴のあるグループ（Faction）に分けられており、それぞれで全く違う楽しみ方が出来てよく考えられています。
サンドボックスモードやModも豊富なので長く楽しめるゲームです。

The building mechanics are interesting because the block designs are juuuust mismatched enough that you can't connect a block to every adjacent block. This forces you to make decisions and get creative with your builds, because blocks can only regrow from adjacent blocks.

After owning Reassembly for a number of years, I thought I'd finally get around to making a review on it (as Steam keeps insisting I do). For the TL;DR, suffice it to say, this is one of the most peaceful, beautiful single-player experiences one can face on Steam. Artful, stunning, and tranquil amidst the void, Reassembly is one of the most serenely enveloping games I have ever owned.

Now, if you want to read further...

The game is intrinsically simple. A player chooses from one of several factions (unlockable by defeating especially large ships) and is then thrown into a two-dimensional, vector-drawn universe of polygons, angles, and mesmerizingly pulsating lights. Just the look of the game is a signature of brilliance; for its ships are inherently unique and yet stunning to view in action, its particle effects are statisfying every time they fire, and though the environment has its own special solace when one is alone, the world truly comes alive with motion and the bee-like movement of galactic civilization once one enters an area with other ships. The presentation isn't nearly done, however. The game's UI is reminiscent almost of Asteroids, with simple and elegant markers denoting everything you need between the resource you collect, the research points you have to spend, and your location in the universe. Menus are sleek and simplistic, button clicks are satisfying and well-designed, and the ship builder (which I shall return to later) is remarkably intuitive.

Now; for the sounds. Yes, oh, yes, the sounds deserve a paragraph all of their own. Reassembly's music is an anxiety-melting symphony of synths and echoing noises, reminiscent perhaps of Minecraft or Celeste in sound design. The OST is something you hardly notice, yet that is entirely its purpose - drawing you in subconsciously with the plucking of electronic strings and the sigh of electronic voices among its geometric world. Sound effects in the game are muffled, giving it a serene 'underwater' feeling and selling its setting in space while keeping them from being jarring or otherwise startling even when they do fire off at their most abrupt. Thrusters make an almost symphonic hum as they fly, whereas weapons are percussion pulses of plasma and softly-grinding drones of lasers and the vibrant 'thrum' of flying missiles among a bassline of firework-like explosions. 

Now that I've rattled on about sound for as long as I reasonably can, it's time to delve into mechanics. In Reassembly, you collect points, simply called 'P', by destroying other ships, exploring the universe, investigating strange objects, and harvesting naturally generating plants as they die. From there, you can either feed it to factory-bearing ships for research points to unlock new blocks and devices (called 'R'), or if you have a factory yourself, you can use it to build your own fleet! And that's it. No; I'm serious. That's all this game needs to be as engaging as it is. Due to the sheer variety of the faction starcraft and fighting agents and the challenge of staying alive in a hostile universe, this single gameplay cycle is utterly absorbing and engaging for hours on end. Plus, it feeds the best part of the game, the ship designer!

Now, when most people think ship designer, they think of something like Space Engineers or Airships: Conquer the Skies. A grid (or, if we are so bold, even a VOXEL grid) of square modules and pipes and systems interlocking and interlacing at right angles (or other slightly more interesting angles if one is willing to spend countless hours fiddling with joints, rotors, and bugs). In Reassembly, that norm is thrown right out the window. All parts, all modules, all of EVERYTHING, is set on a dynamic, geometric system of interconnecting nodes which can fit literally anywhere one pleases! Not only does this serve as an exemplar in creative shaping and arrangement, but it also means that players practically have the capability of developing any ship they please (within 2D)! While the game has no dedicated rotating joints, it certainly doesn't need them - as it would otherwise the beautifully and elegantly utilitarian nature of its design. 

In short, Reassembly is not a game for those who want goals. Rather, it is a game for those who want to spend some hours sitting back, absorbing themselves in content and the fireworks of galactic war as ship modules shatter from ship modules, angles snap to angles, and the stars fall under their grasp through trial, error, and the safe knowledge that there is no requirement but patience and a willingness to let the need for some final objective go. 

There are few games I would dream of calling a work of art. Reassembly is a game that I declare not merely an artwork; but a masterclass of design.

In my first run, I encountered circular Agent ships made entirely out of armour spikes, with some thrusters near the centre to make them spin. These spikes have so much HP and regenerate so fast that killing these ships, (especially with them spreading damage around as they spin) is basically impossible. They also one-shot anything they collide with, regardless of how much armour and shields it has. They just cut straight through any ship like it wasn't even there to begin with. The only vanilla weapon that works against these beyblade abominations is lag. You need to make a fleet of ships with so many drone launchers (and some torpedoes for damage) that the game lags to a standstill so you can damage the spinners, and even then they will still try to run when some of the outer spikes are gone. If one does escape it regenerates almost immediately. Suffice it to say that killing just one is a tedious process taking several minutes and the existence of an entire fleet almost completely ruined the game for me. 

I've no doubt that half the people would quit the game entirely after encountering these low skill, low effort, stupidly OP designs that exploit a single block type. This needs to be fixed.",1628001827,1628042963,False,0,1,0.432441353797912598,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Building ships and applying some real life armour principles (spaced armour, SLAT, etc.) is pretty fun, and you'll get to experiment a lot.

You'll have a lot of fun building anything from practical ships to completely absurd designs just for the hell of it.

I regret not having done this sooner.

Reassembly is a game which is pretty basic and does not require you to understand complex mechanics if you just want to play the game.
You are given shapes; you assemble yourself multiple ships and blow everything else up.

However Reassembly is one of those games in which vanilla isn’t everything, the normal playable factions are more like the tutorial level, the game becomes more challenging by the appearence of agents (Player-created factions).
You can even add your own agents or factions to the world generator, so you can go and try beating and succeeding your past self if you start a new save.

Each faction is different, in shapes, in playstyle, even in AI behavior resulting with the game becoming very replayable and the amount of possible play-throughs becomes pretty much endless as soon you take a look inside the workshop and spot the amount of ways to spice up the gameplay.
And even if you are still not satisfied, the love the developer put into this game becomes even more visible when you start reading through the documents he left for the community to make your own mod.

Concerning the music, while playing my brain was in shock, due to sudden realization.
I am normally the type of guy to turn the music off and runs his own playlist in the background, but the music of Reassembly (especially from the fields expansion) felt so in-place with the overall atmosphere of the game, even if I thought it was enough, I couldn't turn the music off.

However, the game is not perfect, there are small and annoying bugs you may encounter:

-Some ships forget what they look like whole or completely vanish.
-You sometimes encounter invulnerable ships which take no damage till they are rammed in an asteroid or take damage by driving into one
-Sometimes a part of the game becomes a black screen.
Quitting and reopening the game helps though.
-The game can crash sometimes, is normally no big deal unless you were in edit mode.
I recommend saving on a regular basis and making a copies of your ship (So you can still go back, since you would lose your undo-steps), depending on the complexity of the design of the ship you edit/build.
-Collision can mess up sometimes with ships suddenly clipping inside each other and sometimes can get [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2549911949]the enemy[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2549912238]YOU[/url] inside an asteroid.

Overall the game is magnificent and I recommend to people who:

-like building games
-like puzzles, because the editors of some factions feel like one (especially the red faction if you try to build artistically-pleasing)
-wish to have themselves as teammates and enemy
-like blowing things up or explosions in general
-often have the fantasy of throwing things including your foes, your allies, your fleet, yourself, a rock or everything just stated into a sun
-like the small moments (They are almost guaranteed to exist.)

I also recommend to keep the rotation (r key) on keyboard settings, adding a spinal weapon or weapon with slow projectiles and no homing for your mouse-controls which turns this game into a factory of satisfaction, as long you go for greedy shots and hit.

Ive been playing it quite alot. my only complaints are, since it actually is a good game that means you want more of it lol. need more blocks, maybe straight up wing parts and such. beyond that my real complaints are
-The thrusters are terrible. you get your ship set, add a single additional gun and it seems like you need 40 more thrusters. the bigger thrusters are out of portion with the mass. they create more weight then they thrust making your ship even less mobile. I ended up downloading thrusters with 500 thrust and no mass. even with the zero mass I constantly need more, that being said the lowest thrust should be 500-1000.
-the copy and past functions need improvement. It just seems to kinda break when you are changing up larger ships. pieces end up zig zag, out of place, what you selected wasn't what was copied, but for medium to smaller ships it works flawlessly.
-I dont know what it is, small meteores? ship parts from destroyed vessels? either way everytime I try to travel at full speed my ship seems to just fall apart and get destroyed by running into stuff I cannot see. I kept thinking it was just my bad driving because the creator did good at making this game, but when I respawn and return I cannot determine what killed my ship, sometimes I get spawn trapped.
-there's no speed control. its complete nintendo driving, you just add more thrusters for more speed and less for less. the issue with that is sometimes I'm going straight to an objective on the other side of the world, I just want to get there, while other times I'm looking for stuff to destroy, I can't go fast otherwise Ill zip right past them.

が、ゲームの肝となるエージェントが現在スポーンしない致命的な問題がある。
エージェントとは他プレイヤーがワームホールからアップロードした艦隊のことで、
他プレイヤーと擬似的な戦闘を行える素晴らしい機能だが色々試した所成功したので以下に記述する。
2021/6/30時点

-------
以下にコマンドを使用する箇所があるが、コンソールを使用して手入力する命令文のこと。
コンソールはタイトル画面・ゲーム中のどこからでも呼び出せる。
コンソールを呼び出すショートカットキーはタイトルメニューのコントローラーから確認。
-------

[コマンド:agentでダウンロードする]
  agentコマンドはサーバーからエージェントをダウンロードするコマンドだが実行するとクラッシュするので今は使えない。

[エージェントを手動で追加する]
  agentコマンドはクラッシュするので手動でエージェントを追加する必要がある。
  https://reassemblywiki.com/basic-gameplay/agents/
  ページ内の[Choosing Your Agents]にあるパスを探してそこに[agents]フォルダを作成し、
  その中に艦隊ファイル(xxxx.lua.gz)をコピーするとエージェントとして配置される。
  艦隊ファイルは自分の艦隊をエクスポートしたものでも良いし、
  他プレイヤーがワームホールに送り出したものでも良い。
  その場合は以下URLからダウンロードが可能。
  自分がワームホールに送り出したものもアップロードされるので名前で検索すれば表示される。
  https://www.anisopteragames.com/sync/latest.html

[エージェントの数を変更]
  マップ構築時に設定したエージェント数が反映されず、内部的な初期数の[8]のままになってしまうので手動で変更する。
    cvar kAgentCount エージェント数
  変更後の確認
    cvar kAgentCount
    数量指定なしで実行すると設定値が出力される。
    なお、一度設定すると再起動後も反映されたままだった。

Some super smart dude also decided to put in an auto-zoom in and out feature and you guessed it NO option to turn it off. 

Then you get to the fields expansion which just adds small circular fields in the galaxy system you start in (there are options to keep them from being in your game). There are 2 fields a super slow motion field and then the problem one, a field that introduces a strong gravitational pull around what looks like a dwarf star and if you get deep into the field with a small ship its impossible to escape the field and if you hit the star in the middle its instant kill. The real problem here is that stations or with some factions the moving spawn point ships will be stuck in the Dwarf star field so youre stuck in the loop of death and can never escape the field.

This is one where you find out if you want to be an engineer or not.  The game is relatively simple in concept, but can get very in depth with designs, to the point where you spend a couple hours creating the perfect snub-fighter only to scrap half of it because it doesn't fit with the rest of your faction's theme.

You can play in a creative way, using out-of-the-box weaponry and ideas to destroy enemy ships (such as using tractor beams to ram into an enemy) or you can simply brute force through anyway (such as attaching infinite plasma cannons to your borg cube).

[b] What I Liked [/b]

So many games have come out like this where you build out your own ship in almost any way you want.  This one actually does that and feels like you can be a bit more free form than other games I have played.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Not much that I recall.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I got my fill.  These games don't tend to satisfy me long, but I do consider it to be a good game.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

Reassembly is a relatively simple game about taking basic shapes, putting guns on those shapes, and then playing spaceships.  The control scheme will always be a point of contention as the game tries to mitigate your hilarious engine placement, consider a controller.  

The game is generous with the amount of space you have for creativity, and often if you do a little finagling you can make most things fit. Anything from small fighters to gargantuan battle cruisers are craftable and the shape options mean you can make it look like almost anything you like.  Check the community hub, your favorite spaceship is more likely to be there than not, and if it isn't, you can go ahead an fix that.

The game itself puts you in a space (the size of your choosing) and encourages you to build a fleet... or just be a huge lone battleship, your call... and go blow up other fleets, claiming space stations and purging the galaxy of all spaceships that are not your spaceships.  

It's a little hard to hit some of the smaller faster ships, but that's why you have beam weapons and tracking missiles.  There's a solution to your problem and there is no perfect ship. 

Although some of the more Kite-y frigates are a little frustrating to deal with.

В ванильной версии контента не очень много, но огромное количество модов позволит невероятно разнообразить мир новыми расами, врагами, союзниками, деталями и объектами окружения.

Длинно: фишка игры - создание кораблей. Деталей много и у каждой фракции есть уникальные, потому выбор стороны определяет геймплей. И возможных вариации космического судна тут очень много: быстрое с короткими, но мощными буровыми лучами, чтобы прорубать врагов насквозь; Непробиваемые дредноуты, поддерживаемые малым флотом; Корабли с дальнобойными пушками, чтобы бить противников с безопасного расстояния. Ну или вообще гигантскую укреплённую циркулярную пилу, чтобы стирать всех в пыль. Но делать военную технику совсем необязательно, можно позабавиться постройкой космических ферм (местные растения при цветении дают ресурсы для постройки кораблей и обмена на валюту для открытия деталей и найма союзников), станций и корабей-стен, представляющих собой большие куски корпуса для ограждения важных мест. 

Окружение, по большей части, активируется только в месте присутствия игрока, там ранее бездействующие фракции начинают друг с другом воевать, но за пределы своей территории выходят не слишком часто, что жалко. Единственным исключением являются появляющиеся время от времени флоты других игроков (управляемые ботами), что будут неудержимо двигаться в вашу сторону и не остановятся вплоть до уничтожения главаря.

Визуальная часть минималистичная, но основные мощности канпуктера будут уходить на вычисление физических процессов. Картинка в сочетании с музыкой производит умиротворяющее впечатление, благодаря чему бывает приятно позалипать в Reassembly ради атмосферы, ненапряжно занимаясь медитативным захватом пространства и вычищением его от конкурентов, ну или просто любованием пейзажей и поиском редких фракций.

Моды игре необходимы, они просто делают её лучше в каждом аспекте. Рекомендую установить ""ExtraReassembly"" после освоения ванильных фракций. Мод добавит не только новые расы, но и дополнит уже имеющиеся.

Reassembly is a building-focused space combat ""massively single-player"" game, where you select a faction, spawn a galaxy, and are free to go about that sandbox as you please. Don't be fooled, this isn't an in-depth space sim like Freelancer or anything in that vein. If you're expecting negotiations, diplomacy, relations, or anything in that vein, you will be disappointed. 

Abandon reason, know only war. If they aren't flying your colors, they are hostile. Exterminate the opposition and be the last one standing.

But Reassembly isn't a game about that. It's a game about building the coolest damn spaceship of them all and mashing them together and watching the fireworks. The building mechanics are slick and intuitive. I didn't think I would enjoy it, seeing as how I have a single brain cell to spare, but soon enough I found myself spending hours and hours making dumb ship designs to throw into Tournament mode (what if I built a ship with only torpedoes? Answer: you get frustrated because it can't aim, and then forget how frustrating it is when it lands a salvo and chews through a battleship like a hot knife through butter.)

There are some who say there isn't a whole lot to the game, and my response to that is it's really a game where you make your own fun. I wish there was a multiplayer element, among some other things - as fun as it is fighting your friends' Agents in Tournament is, it's very clunky. I've had a lot more fun building up fleets with differing capabilities and watching them clash in Tournament mode, but maybe you'll have more fun building an unstoppable juggernaut and plowing a path of destruction through a galaxy.

It's an outstanding game, and one I heavily recommend. Seriously, give it a try. The gameplay is slick, the soundtrack is soothing, and the visuals are fantastic. Other people have written much more eloquent and detailed reviews than I have, so I'll just leave you with this.

If you want to watch warships broadside each other with plasma cannons while hundreds of missiles race out and dive into flashing screens of laser point-defense, this is the game for you.

...

Also, there's a fuck-ton of mods in the workshop that add on every kind of faction you could ever want. So if you want to see something but it's not in the base seven factions, well, give that a try.

The game is essentially based on the ""Reassembly"" mechanic, hence the name. Ships are designed by connecting hull shapes and prefabs to each other, and the blueprint is then assembled by each of these pieces materializing one at a time in 'chains'. When a ship suffers damage, the lost pieces begin to reassemble in a similar way.

Stations also exist, which are designed like ships but lacking thrusters. These remain stationed in the sectors in which they are built and use ship-delivered resources to continually produce new ships using factories. Some of these ships can include factories themselves, which generally means that the rate at which ships are created increases exponentially.

If you are piloting a ship with at least one factory, nearby ships that do not have factories will transfer their resources to you for your own use. You can also choose to transfer resources to them for use by their factories. You may then decide which of your ships you wish to produce, and begin doing so at your own will. The ships that are produced will remain under your command, although you can dismiss them at any time or recruit other nearby ships using a credit-like currency if you do not wish to produce them yourself.

The units you command will continuously accompany you but in the meantime also perform duties that they are designated to fulfill, which is decided based on their physical designs. Essentially, a ship designed for combat will always remain near you, whereas a ship equipped with cargo containers will collect nearby resources and transfer them to you or to other ships or stations with factories, unless they have a factory of their own in which case they will also produce their own ships.

It is possible to command fleets up to about 60 ships in size, and in my experience this also has no performance drawbacks at all. This means you can lead massive swarms of fighting ships into combat, which is especially enjoyable to watch when attacking agents (naturally occurring, similarly large hostile fleets built by other players).

Despite the reassembly mechanic, poorly equipped ships can easily be destroyed in combat. You will generally need to retreat from any hostile zones in order to fully recover from damage. I've found that it's effective to produce large fleets of unshielded, relatively small fighters, and command them in a larger, shielded ship while remaining in the back line.

If you decide to do this, I would also recommend using the 'Engage my Target' fleet order, ensuring to find a new target after the previous one is destroyed by your fleet. This order causes all units you command to aggressively pursue and attack your targeted enemy, much more so than the 'Fire at Will' order in which they will instead hold their position near you and simply fire on nearby enemies. The downside to this is that they will obviously only engage your target, but somehow this usually doesn't seem to be much of a problem (at least with very large fleets) as long as you continue acquiring targets. The 'Disengage' order can also be used during a retreat.

Overall, it's definitely an interesting game and one I would recommend you purchase (perhaps on a sale if you mind the price tag). The only slightly aggravating thing I've come across in the game is enemy ships that have 8-10 large thrusters in each direction, giving them superb acceleration and the ability to even evade ships with afterburners. This can be frustrating as you have limited attack options when getting close to them is nearly impossible. To be fair though these are player designs and can't really be 'moderated', if this were to be considered a real issue.",1612234089,1617200083,True,5,0,0.560485601425170898,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unlock (P) the ability to add more functional blocks.
Immediate access to build max size ships.
Each race has unique tech specialties.
There is no friendly fire/damage.
The AI is okay but not very advanced.
There is no complex galactic simulation.
Ships grow from one tiny block produced at a factory block.
There is a very simple mercenary fleet mechanic, only for you.
You can save and load your ships and entire fleet schematics.

Можно играть часами, не замечая как летит время, но увы лишь до того момента пока ты не откроешь все фракции и не протестируешь свои космические корабли на арене. Очень жаль но у данной игры нету мультиплеера, из-за этого после продолжительной игры в одиночку потихоньку становится скучно и теряется смысл игры. Огромным плюсом является возможность полностью кастомизировать свой космический корабль (можно менять от цвета до деталий вашего космического корабля). Детали корабля зависят от фракции, у разных фракций разные оружия (Что вполне логично и очень правильно). У игрока при создании нового мира есть возможность выбрать размеры карты и насколько много ""Агентов"" будут бороздить по просторам вашего мира. Насколько я понял за все время провождение в игре это то что ""Агенты"" это корабли других игроков, но управляет ими искусственный интеллект (С помощью этого можно хоть как-то посмотреть на что равняться или просто подсмотреть как другие люди строят свои космические корабли. Еще одиним весомым плюсом является мастерская в Steam по данной игре, откуда вы можете скачать различные модификации или создать их самому.

Don't be fooled by the apparent visual simplicity of this game.  Years after my purchase I still find myself coming back to this game occasionally, largely because of its excellent music design and smooth gameplay loop.  

In this rogue-lite asteroid-like sandbox shooter, you start off with a pretty complete-looking ship that you can fly around and encounter different alien races that have their own divergent ship design philosophies.  As you merrily blow them up, you'll accumulate upgrade points that let you tack on some extra thrusters and laser emitters.  Very early on in the game, you'll realize you can no longer keep tacking on weapons blisters and need to delete your ship and build it back up from scratch.  This is where the fun happens.  

The ships you design  through your upgrade points can be saved to the cloud and spawned as enemies in other peoples' games, which is how it gets its ""massively single-player"" status.  It's an interesting alternative to PvP, uploading your best ship designs to appear as enemies for other players.  Assembling new spaceships is really fun and engaging and I was able to play and build new ships easily with my standard gamepad.  

The game includes a wide variety of unlockable alien races to play as which is a huge part of this game's replayability.  They did a really good job at making asymmetrical playstyles - aliens that have totally different approaches to combat and resource farming that you can fight against and eventually play as.  

There's this magical combination of textureless graphics with smooth atmospheric background music and arcade style gameplay layered over building/resource management and combat that makes Reassembly a unique gaming experience that is worth checking out.

完全日本語化されているが、チュートリアルは不親切。最低限レベルの量しかない。

その結果、左右に曲がることが開始一番の難題になった。
スラスターの方向と出力と排気？する空間が必要なこと。機体の向きだけでなく照準の位置が操作基準になること。設計画面にある小さな赤い三角が正面を示していることなどを理解するまで１時間近く試行錯誤を繰り返した。
出力の必要数がよくわからず、戦闘や接触でスラスターが簡単に壊れてしまうことも混乱に拍車をかけた。挙句の果ての２時間後、ヒントにＲキーで移動方法の設定を変えられる事実を突きつけられた。キーボードで回転にすると個人的な直感に沿った移動方法に変わった。

スラスターごてごての初期艦は操作と設計を含めてハードルが高い。そのあとでセーブした設計や艦隊データが、デスクトップに出力されたことには面を食らった。一度フォルダを作ってから、ゲーム中のインポートで選択すればそこに変えられたので安心はできた。

それを乗り切ればあとは淡々とした展開が続く。同じ色をした味方以外はすべて敵であり、他のプレイヤーが設計したものをゲームが取り込んだランダム艦隊（エージェントと呼ばれる）が彷徨っている。それ以外にも赤い勢力のマザーシップに何度もバラバラにされ、似た色の青系統の敵の強力な攻撃に半身を幾度となく粉砕されるなど、強い敵もそこらを泳いでいる。

すべての宇宙船は自動修復され、兵装などが失われたとしても時間がたてば回復する。コアを破壊しなければ止められない。撃破されても近くのステーションからすぐリスポンする。

ワームホールをくぐれば宇宙の広さからエージェントの数まで再設定できることも含めて、別の意味でゲーム感覚の世界だ。ＤＬＣの追加だと思われる重力井戸や低速ゾーンは正直なところ面倒なだけだった。

資源を送り、資金を集め、装備の解禁と改造を繰り返すものの、ストーリーもなく、通信もないため、時間も成果も進展もよくわからない。物質転換すら成し遂げた彼らが、何を求めて争うのだろうか。Ｒが取れる植物風の何かを狙っているのかもしれない。

宇宙の中心ほど敵が強くなるとのことで、それを目指すのが一応の目標だろう。実績に書いてあることも一通りの目標になるかもしれない。modも複数あり、ワークショップから使用できる。装備の上限突破や艦船種類の増加などなど多数あり、刺激を増やせる。

いつ飽きるかわからないタイプであり、いつまたやりたくなるかもわからないゲームだ。ライブラリの友といえる。
釣り堀に糸を垂らす感覚が、このゲームに感じるものと似ているのではないだろうか。",1594211794,1594212996,True,10,1,0.60161978006362915,0,True,False,False,False,,,

C'est joli, y'a plusieurs races différentes proposant des combinaisons de blocs et d'armes diverses, on crée ses premiers modèles, puis sa flotte et on la teste contre la galaxie entière mais aussi contre les vaisseaux créés par les autres joueurs. 
En effet, à chaque fois qu'on passe dans un trou de ver on peut soit choisir de se transférer dans une nouvelle galaxie, soit choisir d'uploader sa flotte pour qu'elle soit générée dans le monde des autres joueurs.

Le top du must pour moi c'est encore le mode qui permet de faire des simulations. Après avoir peaufiné chaque flotte de chaque race en ayant donné naissance aux vaisseaux les plus impressionnants et/ou efficaces que je pouvais concevoir, j'ai passé des heures en tant que spectateur à laisser l'IA faire s'affronter le tout dans des tournois pouvant durer une bonne demi heure, à faire des statistiques sur quelle flotte gagne le plus souvent contre x flotte, à faire des ralentis pour ne rien rater du moment ou tel vaisseau gigantesque se faisait scier en deux par un autre vaisseau cracheur de piliers plasmatiques.

De l'Or, certes, mais il aurait quand même gagné à ne pas sortir de l'Early Access aussi si vite. Aucune idée des raisons qui ont généré ca mais ca reste un fait qui doit être mentionné, malheureusement certaines races sont un peu en dessous des autres (voir énormément, bonjour la race des abeilles) ou manquent un peu de blocs, et sont donc déséquilibrées, de plus l'IA aurait gagné à être polie à certains niveaux, et j'aurais aimé que les comportements personnalisables de celle ci soient un peu plus variés voir simplement fonctionnels pour certains.

De plus on voit que les développeurs avait de grandes idées au départ, l'univers aurait du être plus vivant et je suppose qu'on était sensé pouvoir faire plus de choses que simplement se battre.

Heureusement, en l'état, simplement créer et se battre reste largement assez satisfaisant et donne une durée de vie déjà bien assez longue pour qu'il soit deux fois recommandable.

If you like games that come with bugs and crash at a moments notice losing you hours of progress then this is the game for you. If you can get past constant crashes and play the game you will notice that your ships AI is about as smart as a plank of rotting wood. It is an unfinished buggy cash grab of a game from a developer who doesn't care to finish making this a usable product.

Once you get past the host of problems in game you may then discover the game has a small mostly inactive user base on Discord crowned by some toxic players. I am not sure which is worse. The state of the game and its severe unplayability or the toxic users in its official Discord.

All in all its been five years since this game was released and it is still broken. For a while the developer was active but what updates the game did get made the bugs stand out more and still haven't been fixed. If anything the games AI now performs even more poorly than it did before it got ""updates"". If you want to spend money I highly recommend that you make a purchase on a worthwhile game that isn't broken like this one.

Buy this game and be prepared for:
Constant crashes.
Poorly programmed AI.
Mostly dead modding community.
Toxic players.
Uninspiring game play (game can be finished in a few hours then rinse and repeat).

拆船到时候注意走位，不要把同一个地方对着对面，容易让人家一路拆到核心然后jj
同理，打的时候瞄准一个地方拆，尽快拆掉核心
捏船的时候注意尽量把核心往里放，各个方向推力都有有（尤其注意倒车，不然等你卡石头里就知道了（别问我为什么知道的）），注意电量配置（你知道算了半天发电和武器费电然后打的时候被护盾吃空的痛苦吗嘤嘤嘤T-T）
还有护盾放在装甲里面一般来说甲包盾效果比盾包甲好
另外虫洞和舰队可以前期嫖钱，毕竟一个1000c呢


接下来各种族特性

首先人族各种方面比较均衡，前期建议玩小船质子剑突刺流，后期可以点各种远程炮，玩法多样
着重说一下人族有个近乎bug一般的邪教--风车鱼雷
捏个大风车然后在旋转方向上堆鱼雷，然后绑定到自动射击
一般4000p就你就可以体会到了（奸笑）（ai：游戏体验极差）

红族是我第二个解锁的，然后。。。
这tm是给人玩的？？？
还有红族捏船是真的。。。一言难尽。。。

叮当。。。没什么好说的，碎星炮就完事了

农民。。。前期点太阳能板就完事了（不过你要做好心理准备，ai没有蓝图就早你的船（奸笑x2）

水晶船硬的一批，堆炮就完事了
（但是捏船跟小红一样一言难尽（小声bb））

蜂群。。。莽就完事了（虽然我甲薄盾脆但是如果我在你把我拆了之前先把你拆了就没事（暴论（但是好像蛮有道理的亚子）））

哨兵。。。莽就完事了！！！
完全放弃点防炮（小炮两秒1发）（另外我是拿小导弹当点防用的滑稽）
没有盾，但是甲厚的反人类，更别说装甲钉简直毫无人性。。。
（话说之前装甲钉小号3p大号0p。。。我：？？？搓爆（滑稽））
哨兵两大邪教：风车近战流+无限核弹流
然后现在核弹4800多一个。。。之前2000多。。。淦
反正我改了移除p上限23333333333

最后说一下塞推进器的小技巧

I would recommend it at its full price. The gameplay is pretty simple and can get pretty repetitive as the progression loop is pretty much the same across all factions including mod factions. The progression loop being kill ships, get R, turn to R into P, spend P on making ship bigger repeat. 

There's also not a  whole lot of strategy involved in this game it's more about having more gun than your enemy and at some point your ship is going to be so powerful that literally nothing can touch you. Even once you start building a fleet of your own you're not going to start pulling off tactical moves or anything like that you just point at a target and all your little dudes will move into range and start firing thoughtlessly until it explodes. Honestly I found fleet building to be a bit tedious and not as fun as just creating one really big over powered ship that can knock out fleets by itself.

Over all it's a fun little time waster with some visually pretty nice looking battles and a satisfying if not overly simple progression system revolving around customizing your ship.

Впрочем, на большее можете не рассчитывать, т.к., на данный момент, геймплей весьма простой и однообразный. Состоит он из того, что мы, в роли космического корабля, летаем по карте, постреливая в многочисленных и не очень компьютерных засранцев. Среди них есть хрупкие засранцы, мелкие телепортирующиеся засранцы, засранцы с самонаводящимися ядерными торпедами, несчадно сжирающие фпс сорняковидные засранцы и еще какие-то, о которых я забыл. В целом это все. И на ""убить пару часов в неделю"" этого вполне достаточно.
Итак, плюсы:
1) Воркшоп. Да, да. тонны пользовательских модификаций это один из ключевых плюсов этой игры. Без него не было бы наиграно этих чертовых 185 часов. 5-10 максимум. Работы там выкладываются разной степени имбалансности и кривизны, НО, многие авторы действительно стараются и добавляют к геймплею свои уникальные механики.
2) Аудио-визуальная составляющая. Представленная тут векторная графика вполне симпатично выглядит. Лазеры светят, ракеты бахают, все это сопровождается хорошим звуком и музыкой. Придраться не к чему.
3) Удобный и интуитивно понятный редактор кораблей. Не хватает только отзеркаливания при строительстве (может, это я криворукий и не заметил, где оно включается). Если вы любите заморачиваться с такими штуками, сдешний редактор кораблей украдет у вас ооочень много часов. Плюс к тому, тут даже с физикой и правильным размещением двигателей заморочились.
Теперь к минусам:
1) Однообразный и скучный геймплей. Да, пока идет ваша прогрессия, этого можно не заметить. Но, стоит вам открыть все блоки и достигнуть максимума по их ""вместимости"", как игра быстро превратится в ""летай по карте и очищай ее от всех, кого встретишь, для того, что бы... а хрен его знает зачем. Можешь еще в червоточину залезть, опять же, хрен его знает зачем. Сюжета нет, цели нет. Песочница, как она есть.
2) Дисбаланс. Может, разработчиками все так и задумывалось, но, если одна раса/фракция может загибать всех в самые экзотические позы, то другая может только дохнуть от каждого чиха. Видимо, так должна выглядеть градация сложности... но, лично для меня, это какое-то очень странное представление. Когда твой кор разваливается в труху от чего угодно, а способного наносить хоть какой-то урон (или обладающего собственными особенностями) оружия нет совсем, то это уже не хардкор, а самый настоящий дисбаланс. Да, я сейчас о красных засранцах, которые были для меня ""кормом"" при игре за любую другую фракцию. А рядом с ними местные некроны летают на кораблях-гробницах и х****чат ядерными торпедами целые астероиды. Все это компенсируется установкой модов из воркшопа, где флоты звездных разрушителей пытаются толпой запинать линкор класса ""Император, от залпа орудий которого испаряется все живое и построенное, в радиусе полторы тысячи километров... так что, все нормально...

Итог: своих денег игра стоит. Если вам нужно чем-то себя занять в свободное время, если любите собирать из блоков всевозможную летающую фигню, если любите космическую тематику и песочницы - берите, не пожалеете.

[u]Full Review Below[/u]

Reassembly is probably one of my favorite indie releases. The premise is simple: build your own ship, then squadron, then fleet. Then take the fight across the galaxy. 

The meat of the game play is in building your own ships. If you're the kind of player who loves full creative freedom, and the simple loop of building something from scratch -> seeing how it does -> revising, then you will absolutely love this game. If you'd rather just figure out one thing and then go shoot things, you'll probably get bored relatively quickly. 

That being said, the ""shooting things"" play style is very well supported in the early game, because you gather resources from destroyed enemies and can use them to unlock new bricks. This changes once you're out of things to unlock, as their is no longer the rewarding gameplay loop that comes with unlocking things. 

On the presentation side of things, the graphics are gorgeous and the soundtrack is rich and moody, making it an easy game to get lost in while you experiment with different options and different builds. The first play through impression that this game leaves is [b]magical[/b]. You'll be discovering new types of ships and civs pretty consistently for a while, many with their own tricks and challenges that you'll need to adapt to. 

Eventually you'll discover everything the game has to offer, and you'll be left with optimizing your fleet, designing mother ships and stations, and attaining dominance. If you get bored of one civ, you can always play as one of the others. Each one has its own style and weapons, complete with different shipbuilding styles due to the differing tile sets. 

When you get bored of what the base game has to offer, then there's an incredibly lively Workshop scene ready to add myriad new choices. I played for about 30 hours before even considering adding Workshop content. 

To top it all off, the developer recently became active again and added a fascinating expansion that explores gravity wells, as well as tightening up the core game. Even if you don't like the new gravity ""terrain"" features, the expansion is worthwhile for the new soundtrack alone, imo.",1578251687,1578251687,True,8,0,0.621584832668304443,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[code]build boat. shoot.

:)[/code]
so i thought i might as well write something useful
ok so. 

 As a person that almost plays exclusively space games and building games, this is my favorite game. By alot. Beautiful effects, a [i][b]perfect[/b][/i] soundtrack, and a building system that lets you make anything you want (but if you want something structurally sound, you'll have to do math xD). The combat and gameplay is fun and satisfying to watch and I love the way ships can slowly fall into pieces/get cut in half/explode into a million pieces. Not only is there infinite freedom in the base game, but the game is incredibly easy to mod as well. If you want to test your skill in min-maxing monstrous mobile machines, there are many active community-hosted tournaments as well. Most of the hours post-campaign (likely ""won"" after 30-40 hours) will either be modding or competing in tourneys.

However, its not without imperfections. First off, updates are very rare: the developer has his hands full with his half-grown human that he had in 2019. There is no tutorial for the sandbox, many of the controls, and many of the cooler features. There are bugs that, while workaround-able, new players will not know what is causing them or how to fix them (also some that no one knows what/why/or how they're there. The game is haunted man...). The ai sometimes decides it will do nothing and engages at strange ranges (mostly observed in tournament mode, campaign ai is fine) and also has trouble using some of the newer features. Lastly, as said before, the campaign part of the game is relatively short.

 Now, does this make this game unenjoyable? Absolutely not. Any thing the game may be missing, the community can supply. Someone (identity unknown) has stepped up and is acting as a temporary developer to squash some of the bugs the game has in an upcoming update (all hail Bugnonimous). If you need help, there are dozens of guides on steam and the internet, and if you still can' find what you need, the community [url=https://discord.gg/8fCjt3J]Discord Server[/url] is friendly and helpful. And regarding the short campaign, most of the endgame is building for tournaments and modding. Heck, I'm making a mod at a snail's pace because I'm having too much fun playing with what I've made!

 So TLDR. If you're an engineer looking to make the best [2d] spaceship you can; if you're a competitor, a creator and artist with an unhealthy obsession with spaceships; if you want to blow chunks off battle-carriers with bombardment from cruisers while your buddy's crowd around and boo at your crappy boating...

На первый взгляд, Reaseembly - простенький, ничем не выделяющийся космический сандбокс, но, запустив игру, ты понимаешь, что эта игра все же не так проста.  
Она мгновенно затягивает, и очень долго не отпускает тебя.
Потратил пару-тройку часов на постройку нового корабля? Пффф.... Сынок, некоторые тратят по нескольку десятку часов на постройку только одного крейсера. 
Здесь ты получаешь удовольствие от всего. От замечательного саундтрека, от процесса строительства своего корабля / кораблей союзников / станций, от уничтожения всего и вся, или же спокойного выращивания здешней флоры.

Сама по себе игра не скудна на контент, но если же она начала вам постепенно приедаться или вам просто захотелось чего-то нового - на сцену выходит мастерская. 
За все время для этой игры было создано огромное количество контента, что то добавляет в новые рассы, что-то расширяет генерацию мира, что-то оптимизирует игру или добавляет полезные фишки.

2. Schwerer Einstieg meiner Meinung.

3. Viele Teile passen nicht zusammen!!!

4. Die Steuerung ist im Bereich ""Hilfe"" nicht die selbe die sie schlussendlich bei mir ist...

5. Die Musik ist ja nicht schlecht.... meiner Meinung nach macht sie einem auf Dauer etwas Depressiv... könnte aber auch nur an mir liegen...lol

6. Gegner sind durch eine Waffe plötzlich mal sehr schwach oder OP...

7. Ich würde mir etwas mehr Vielfalt der normalen Rüstungs- Bauteile wünschen(oder etwas mehr Details, jedoch ist das

What is so great about it?

- The concept of the engineering design process is the core idea of the game. 
You build and control a ship, you quickly find out it's bad, and you improve it until it is both unbeatable and unbearable, and it is the greatest feeling in the world. 

- Then you realize that tournaments exist, and you are introduced to a whole new way of designing ships. Your ships are so powerful now that (vanilla) campaign mode is simply too easy. However, you will find out that your ships are far from up to par in the tournament scene, and you must improve to be competitive. And, of course, you do. You improve a lot. you can no longer design ships that you can play well; you must now design ships the questionable Reassembly AI can play well. You participate in tournaments to find out who is the best at coming up with interesting new strategies, who is the best at actually executing those strategies, who is, well, the best. And you have loads of fun along the way. i mean, you could also find a way to make your ship glitch out of the tournament arena, making everyone die inside, but that's a topic for a future discussion.

- Or you go along a different path (or both, idk), delving deep into the (larger) modding community, filled with absolutely breathtakingly beautiful ships and fantastically interesting factions with weapons significantly more impressive and wonderful than anything in the vanilla game. You can make simple mods with relatively little hassle, or you can work hard and come out with an absolute masterpiece of a faction. There's more than just new factions, however. There is much more that I am not qualified to explain. This significantly increases the limited replayability of the vanilla campaign.

- oh and also: it looks pretty cool, I guess, but vanilla the look of the game is (imo) easily improved with graphics mod.


Bad things (clearly biased; I did say this is my favorite video game of all time):

- possibly not executed perfectly?

- Campaign easy and simple once you learn competitive ship design

- little vanilla faction balance, but that's easy to fix with Reassembly Remastered

One more thing: 

Reassembly has introduced me to the concept of engineering (without me even knowing it) with this incredibly simple but incredibly nuanced video game. The game was one of the factors that drew me into designing and making actual physical things. I became deeply involved in my FIRST Robotics Competition team and learned various CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CAM (Computer Aided Machining) programs like Solidworks, Fusion 360, and Camworks because this little spaceship building game introduced me to the wonders and infinite satisfaction that are endemic to engineering and making things. In Reassembly, I asked the question: where do I put my thrusters so my ship will behave correctly? Now, in FRC, I ask: Where do put my collector so the driver can place more game pieces? It is truly incredible how much this fun little game has taught me about the extreme funness (Idk, the word does has a meaning) that comes with making things, and for that, I am infinitely grateful.",1566775271,1566775291,True,37,0,0.797041773796081543,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ok, now I know I'm bad at making reviews but...

I was always obsessed with LEGOs during my childhood, always wanting to build more and build bigger, but physical LEGOs can be expensive. Not an issue here!

Reassembly's building mechanics are also notably different than that of other machine building games, unlocked blocks can be used as much as you want, there is no manufacturing process, as ships will simply regrow, regenerate or [u][i]Reassemble[/i][/u], although you still need resources to spawn allied ships, and resources mechanics are simple, only one type of resource.
More importantly, Reassembly's blocks are not limited to a grid! I guess this is very difficult to implement properly, to a 2D game maybe not so much, but 3D? I guess not.

There are 7 playable factions, and each one of them feels unique, all have their own blocks, some have equivalent blocks, but most don't, base game player factions feel very balanced in terms of stats, but AI isn't, AI handles spinal (fixed) weapons pretty terribly, seen in faction 4 (Thinkrell) and even worse in 12 (Bee), there isn't much that can be done about it, but AI does feel very refined everywhere else.

My favorite aspect of Reassembly is the Ship Core, every ship needs one central command module that acts as the heart of the ship, and if destroyed, the ship will also be destroyed, so you have to protect it well, not like Robocrap where you need to destroy 75% of the enemy robot instead of a command module.

Only frustration I had so far is AI spinal weapons on faction 4 and 12, and Conquer the Galaxy achievement, where you pretty much have to kill every single enemy in the galaxy, though recently, it is possible to select galaxy scale and omit factions, so it's kind of cheesable now.

Oh, there's community mods, some will add way more content than the base game, do check out the workshop will ya?

Overall, being able to build a ship that is designed to fight feels very satisfying, not like Machinecraft's paper ships, being able to build a massive warship that can kill everything in sight is like a dream come true, a feature that real life LEGOs don't have.",1562323421,1562323421,True,6,0,0.587436497211456299,0,True,False,False,False,,,

В этой игре, за простой механикой захвата галактики, путём геноцида и распространения кораблей своей фракции, скрывается геймплей, который может затянуть на долго, несмотря на очень простой внешний вид.
Основной аспект игры — сборка корабля из составных частей и дальнейшие его доработки и улучшения, от сюда и название игры. Интерес так же подогревает прокачка новых частей, орудий для корабля и возможность открывать новые фракции, совершенно друг на друга не похожие (в каждой фракции есть определённый набор частей для корабля, которые предстоит изучить, после чего можно будет их использовать при сборке).


Плюсы:
+Возможность сборки корабля с нуля
+Разнообразная прокачка
+Несколько уникальных фракций
+Большой арсенал, среди которого, помимо всевозможных пушек, лазеров (как курсовых, так и поворотных), можно найти разные ракеты, мины, дроны и многое другое. А что выдумывают разработчики модов, иногда и вообразить сложно.
+Неплохой саундтрек
+ И самый жирный плюс это поддержка воркшопа, в котором много энтузиастов делают моды с новыми интересными фракциями, что может растянуть геймплей настолько, пока вам не надоест начинать игру за новую фракцию с начала.

Минусы:

-Очень простая векторная графика(но из-за большого количества эффектов смотрится неплохо и глаза не режет)
-Редкие обновления(по сути новый контент в игру приносят только мододелы)

While sandbox-style of games may not fit and or belong to everyone, to people who do enjoy taking the time to build (And fly), this game is amazing. 
The game by itself is good, as you can either play the slow expansion way as your faction's control grows, or you can play the agent-hunter and wormhole way, racking up credits at break-light speeds. All the factions themselves have their own uniqueness. As playing every faction the same way will never work.

The Terrans (The starting faction) are a basic race that introduce you to the game with basic missiles, drones, basic point defense, basic lasers, and basic projectile weapons. The Terrans also do have unique weapons, such as the plasma mortar (One of the few weapons that explodes into shards), charge lasers, and dumb-fire rockets and torpedoes. The Terran hulls are quite strong, as combined with their shields, can survive extremely well provided you design your ship decently. 

The Farmers are a long ranged race, that can have specialized brawler ships. Their basic hull is...... well, not weak (Reds...), but nothing compared to Terran and Sentinel hull. Though their half-block armor block that can grow plants (The best armor-per-space block) can make any ship much more survivable. Their short ranged weapons are quite weak (Besides their lasers which are decent), and should be reserved for point defense, with the exception of their short ranged AOE weapons which can easily annihilate even the biggest of ships with ease. Though their long ranged weapons and missiles are, without a doubt, some of their greatest weapons. Along side their shields, they are one of the best ranged race in the game, well, long ranged brawler.

Ah, the Reds. While this race is absolutely brutal to beginners (Yes, I understood your pain), they can be one of the most powerful race in the game. A well-built Red ship can be extremely powerful against ships with no AOE or decent firepower. Their hull...... eh, can we even call it hull? It's more like connecting pieces to your guns and ship systems. Though having the hull be there to protect you is very important. Red ships are focused on short ranged DPS battles. As most Red ships, with their Tempests guns, will utterly burst down any armored-low damage ships. Their lasers are also good with their damage, though they lack range. Their drones are utterly terrible, due to their drones not having a turret compared to the Bee Laser Drone. Though their Nano Repair Drone is very useful to help the Red already quick regenerating hull regenerate even quicker (Along with their Tempest spam).

The Tinkrells. The most utterly broken faction in the game. If you wanted to snipe, and one shot a enemy agent or station from over 5000+ range away, Tinkrells are for you. Their modular spinal cannon can potentially be one of the most powerful weapons in the game. As you can increase the max range, the damage, fire rate, and even velocity with certain modules. Their point defense lasers are also absurdly good in mass, being able to stop utter swarms of missiles and drones (Though their small point defense laser sometimes gets out ranged by drones). Combining this with shields, they have decent survivability. Though their only weak point is the insane need for generators, and their weak hull. Though the Tinkrell are a swarming faction, as they, along with the Farmers, are the only race that can produce their own R. 

The Crystalline. If Reds had missiles and usable hull. The Crystalline are either known for their insane missile spam, second only to the Farmers, or their brute strength, arguably better or on par with Sentinels. You should never underestimate their main weapons. Though they do have a weakness against fast missiles and drones as their point defense is a little on the lacking side. The Crystalline are probably one of the best brawlers in the game, and the second best missile spam race.

The Bees. The race of shields and deadly spinal lasers. The Bees have some of the best thrusters, able to zoom by areas in a blink of an eye. Their shields are also quite good, with good size and health. The Bees have two drones, a defense drone meant to immobilize smaller ships, and two large variants of a laser drone that do extremely good damage. The only problem is the cost of the drones. Though their point defense is quite good, the actual damage against ships is actually terrible. Their main damage dealing method is charging at enemies with their spinal lasers (Which deal a STUPID, yes a STUPID amount of damage). Though the range is the biggest downfall of the spinal lasers, forcing you to close in. Their natural buildings also produce R, but at a rate that isn't useful in normal gameplay.

The Sentinels. Without a doubt one of the most powerful races in the game. Ever wanted to play a race where you stayed in the middle of a entire warzone and came out fine? Well, the Sentinels armor will not let you down. 1000 health in a 1x1 square for 1 P is insanely good. Even if you don't want to spend P, their second level hull is still very good. Their armored spike also gives them the infamous melee spinner (Or as we call them, the Bade Blade of Death). Though their weapons are usable, both the turrets struggle with shields. Their spinal mounted laser though is meant to help burst down shields, and damage key systems before the shields come back up. Or you could just overpower their shields with enough guns...
The Sentinels also have two 'super weapons'. Both cost a arm and a leg to buy, and a limb to use on your ship, but they are both extremely powerful. The Obliterator is as if you took their spinal laser, put it on a turret, and gave it the power to punch through shields, and at times snipe command modules. The...... well, Nuke is a absolute pain to any unshielded ship (And frankly, all ships that don't have the biggest Farmer shield, the best Tinkrell shield, and the Terran Station Shield).  One shoting Prometheus's from the Crystalline is always fun, though being sniped by agent's nuke isn't so much.


The natural spawning factions aren't much of a threat (Except maybe some Tinkrell ships, the Crystalline, and Sentinel), though the agent fleets may, at times, be extremely difficult. Sentinel spinner fleets and Tinkrell fleets especially. Though fighting them and beating them after a long fight feels extremely good, especially when fighting ships that look and preform well. 

And being a sandbox, you can either go with a box with a massive arsenal of guns and shields, or be creative in fleet designing. Either way is fine with me......



Though, lastly, if you buy this game, enjoy being Reassembled!",1559973674,1559973674,True,13,0,0.645475506782531738,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Throw some shapes on a grid to make a ship, add guns.   Blow up orange guys who die with a single missile.  You just run around and spam missiles at everything, which most of the time they don't track good enough to actually land a hit, except on the slow orange guys.   The rest of the guns never have the range because all the enemies kite you.  So in my opinion the missile is the only way to go.  Maybe a tough laser in case something wants to randomly bump into you.   That means there is really only 2 weapons in the game.

Eventually, you run around until you find a wormhole.   You enter it, only to realize you just don't have the desire to clear another map.

10 hours of game time and that is giving it too much time.   Half of those hours were just testing my new ship design in the battle simulator.   I have no desire to load it again.

I love the music, I love the ship building, I love the atmosphere, and I love the different factions. But obviously this is a review and I can't just say things like that. So how about I expand on what I just said:
 
The music is great. It really captures the essence and atmosphere of the game, and it really fits the theme. It captures the emptiness of space with some of it's songs, but space isn't just empty. It's serene, silent, and it feels like everything slows down when you're experiencing it. Even when this is not the case as you're fighting cybernetic bee people, or very angry plants, or special agents that wreak a path of destruction through the whole galaxy, it'll make you feel at peace. It all sounds similar, using similar themes, instruments and motifs, but every track is different, and very recognizable once you play the game enough. Overall, the music in this game is pretty fresh, and a few songs will definitely get stuck in your head.

Next, the ship building. Building your ship is an integral part of the gameplay, maybe even the core of the game, as you obviously need a ship to traverse the vast and chaotic galaxy you're set in.  Ship building is fun, and pretty easy to use. I say easy to use, and not easy, because you definitely need a good bit of skill to create a ship good enough to not explode in. Whether you have this skill naturally, like a lot of people do, or have to learn it and get better at it, like I did, it's definitely pretty difficult to build effectively. But that has nothing to do with the editor: It has a ton of hotkeys to make things easier, and it even has a tutorial to show you how to use them.  The different blocks are readily available to you, (after unlocking them, of course; they can't all be free, can they?) And you can easily rough out the general shape of your ship in no time. Although I do have to say something: Since the blocks are in a grid, they don't always connect the way you want. Of course, the blocks aren't just squares, there's triangles and beams and trapezoids and hexagons and different kinds of triangles and beams, and this means that not all of the building blocks play nice with each other, visually. They may function fine, but they might not connect the way you want, and it's frustrated me many times. Symmetry is pretty difficult if you're dumb like me, especially since there's no mirror mode. There is a mirror button, and a copy and paste, so you could easily just build one half of your ship then paste it over, but usually I don't think about that and my ship ends up looking fine mostly, but with a few little odd measurements that I can never really fix unless I spend like 30 minutes tinkering. But if you're smart, unlike me, I'm sure you'll be able to build your ship smooth, with little to no problems.

The atmosphere in this game is pretty great. It's a two dimensional game, but it's still very immersive if you let it be. As previously stated, the music is a large part of this games general feel. It represents the emptiness of space, but still with danger and discovery.  There are large portions of the map that are just [i] empty.[/i] You can zoom through them at maximum speed and have nothing but darkness, the only light coming from your ship for moments. But all other parts of the map are filled with life; Not only the many various factions vying for control over territory, but with plants; nearly all of the asteroids are covered with plant life, shooting seeds and actively repopulating. One faction even actively exploits these plants; they produce the resource they need to build their own ships, and so they farm them; one of their weapons is simply a seed shooter, their ships have special blocks to grow plants on and transfer R directly to their storage. Large swathes of the galaxy are empty, as you'd expect them to be, but the rest of it is almost like a living being, there's always activity; nothing is ever still: ships are moving, plants are growing, life and death. Your own ship, part of one of the factions, is simply trying to stay alive.

There are many different factions in the game, all with their own niches. Different strengths, different weaknesses, some even entirely different playstyles. There isn't much lore in the game, so I like to make my own, decide what their culture and society would be like. All of the factions are so different, and they all have different themes. For example, the Reds. All of their ships are fast shooting, regrow the fastest out of all the factions, have MANY small ships, and take the most damage. To me, this reminds me of something insectoid; Maybe they're giant insects, with some kind of warrior caste society, where the military controls everything. Or the Bees. Their faction is heavily bee inspired, with black and yellow buildings, lots and lots of drones, and large hive like buildings on asteroids. Again, insectoid, right? But they also use a very large amount of lasers, so maybe cybernetic? 
You can build your own narratives about all of these unique factions and what they might be like outside of the game.


Anyway, that's enough of me being dumb and embarrassing myself by saying things like that. Reassembly is a great game, and I definitely went very overboard with some of my descriptions, but I truly love this game and hopefully I always will. (Google the OST to listen to the music!)

[b]- [u]Песочный песок[/u][/b] В игре нет никакой сути, развлекать надо самому себя;
[b]- [u]Постройка корабля[/u][/b] Если вы используете квадратные детали, то это ещё ничего, но а в ином случае ига сама решает как что подсоединять, и под каким углом, так что строить большие корабли из не квадратных то ещё испытание, да ещё и зеркальное отражение не работает. Кстати, не у всех фракций есть квадратные детали;
[b]- [u]Извращенский импорт[/u][/b] Чтобы использовать дизайн вашего текущего корабля для флота, надо сначала экспортировать дизайн на рабочий стол как файл (или ещё куда), а потом импортировать;
[b]- [u]Фракции[/u][/b] Фракции отличаются деталями, вот только если у одних фракций есть некий выбор, то у других деталей меньше минимума, при это без каких-либо бонусов;
[b]- [u]Захват территорий[/u][/b] Очень странная система, у вас в пустом секторе может быть штук 20 больших кораблей, и несколько станций, но сектор не считается захваченным, а если враг прилетает в какой-то пустой сектор мельчайшим кораблём, то сектор его. Также учитывая что ИИ корабли вашей фракции крутятся на месте, и не помогают захватывать территории, то захват всех территорий на большой карте может растянуться на очень большое время;
[b]- [u]Бои[/u][/b] Первое время в боях с кораблями можно найти какой-то геймплей, дальше же вы можете уничтожить даже самый большой корабль с 1 выстрела. ИИ врагов тупо сидит в секторах, лишь только случайно покидая их, так что на карте ничего не происходит;
[b]- [u]Агенты больше не появляются[/u][/b]  Агенты это случайные ИИ корабли других игроков, бой с которыми приносил не только неплохие ресурсы, но и необходим для прохождения ""обучения"", и получения ачивок.

You get a palette of ship parts consisting of weapons, armor, propulsion, and other unique abilities and quirks specific to each faction. There are 7 playable factions in the game and each one has their own playstyle. However this is a sandbox game without much of a storyline behind it. Your only goal in the game is to conquer the galaxy however way you see fit. If you have a hard time finding reasons to play games or get bored easily this might not be the game for you. If you like to build or have a unique imagination -all the while blowing things up with your pew pew lazers- then you will enjoy many hours from this game.

This game languished on my install list for a year before I finally launched it two nights ago.  Since then I have played 15 hours.  The entire weekend.  

Big pluses:
[list]
	[*] [b] Ship design UI is good.  Very good. [/b]  The controls and visual feedback for this part of the game are nearly flawless, and by ""nearly"" I mean, ""rarely new parts will snap to a place I dislike and I have to dismantle a wing piece to get things to fit properly"". 
	[*] Ship flight control is very simple but manages to inform your ship design process very naturally: I went from merely clicking things together to having opinions about things like ""proper placement of boosters and afterburners"" very quickly just from flying around.  Player weapon targeting controls and auto-targeting AI (should you use it for a particular weapon) are pretty good too. 
	[*] AI unit flying and weapon targeting seem very good in dogfights, adaptive even.  
	[*] Faction ship variety seems pretty decent; I have so far unlocked the ""red"" faction and was pleased to see a big difference in both visual design and general function of components.
	-I longed for more parts to unlock for the starting ""Terran"" faction, so look forward to seeing even more bizarre options when I unlock more factions
[/list]
I really enjoy the gameplay and was pleased to see that dev is still alive for this title.  Some additional features that seem very needed are:
[list]
	[*][b] Allow the tutorial to be disabled!!! [/b]  At least after first activation.
	-The quests for developing a fleet could be separated, as some may enjoy the milestone tracking for each game.
	[*][b] Increase the lower end of hitbox size for station resource turn-ins! [/b]
	-Currently, some resource stations (basically, any ship with a spawn node) are difficult to interact due to small size, presumably due to scaling with the size of parent ship body.
	[*][b] Add an in-game database of self-made builds, viewable from the main menu and independent of any save file! [/b]
	-I want to iterate over the course of my gameplay in a fashion more graceful than saving-and-restoring lua files
	-It would also be handy to allow players to see all ship plans currently being used by their faction during a game.
[/list]
I enjoyed this game so much that I found myself wanting even deeper gameplay.  Some suggestions to that end:
[list]
	[*] [b] Allow play as a faction that only spawns exactly what player wants [/b], allowing:
	-Precise placement of new static ships/space stations
	-Complete control over creation of new spawners
	-Easy control of existing spawners and their spawn pools--I don't always [b] WANT [/b] my new ship design to become the fleet mainstay
	-The above options would add a heavier real-time strategy element to the existing fun of designing and shooting.  Note that things already turn this direction once you start building your own fleet, but allowing this from the start this would give more ownership of your faction!
	[*] [b] Give options for more control over fleet resourcing [/b] if the player wants (in the vein of spawn control point above):
	-Add UI overview of all resources currently owned by fleet ships
	-Add some sort of resourcing AI that can be attached to ships designed for the express purpose of gathering (a slight variation on existing behavior of smaller AI ships)

[h1]Преамбула[/h1]

Сделал большой корабль, наспавнил огромный флот, летал по галактике, всех нагибал, и уже было подумал что игра не затянет больше чем на пару часиков, т.к. всё однообразно и достойных противников даже нет... Как тут мне в голову пришла гениальная мысль - полететь и посмотреть, а что же там в центре вселенной. Залетел я, значит, в сектора, где царствуют растения... Ну, думаю, растения - тоже мне враги. Стоило мне только к ним приблизиться, как весь мой флот превратился в космическую пыль примерно за две минуты. Не, ну это однозначно 10 из 10, одуванчики меня ещё не унижали! :D
Благо на обломках своего корабля успел смыться. Тогда я начал подозревать что в этой игре не всё так просто...

[h1]Плюсы[/h1]

И, да, я оказался прав.

1) В игре действительно достаточно контента, тем более что на днях вышел DLC, к которому я ещё не успел добраться, но судя по его описанию - это мастхэв. Вы можете перемещать свой флот через червоточины в бесконечное количество процедурно генерируемых (насколько я понял) галактик, то есть это уже элементы песочницы, которая может затянуть не на один десяток часов. Добавьте к этому ещё то, что космос действительно выглядит живым, NPC очень много и они взаимодействуют между собой, независимо от действий игрока.

2) Artifical Intelligence (AI). Он тут есть. *trollface* И, объективно, он даже неплох! Игра не надоедает однообразным поведением противников. Они очень вариативно себя ведут, например, если видят что у них численное преимущество - начнут давить количеством, и наоборот, если Ваш флот гораздо сильнее - они будут аккуратно кайтить или просто убегать.
Кроме того, поведение ботов очень сильно зависит от их фракции. Тут работает принцип как в старкрафте - красные/жёлтые фракции более склонны агрессивно рашить большим количеством юнитов, синие/чёрные/розовые являют собой фракции, которые упоролись в технологии, а зелёные (фермеры) выращивают растения! *lol*

3) Графика. Нет-нет, я не упоролся, не спешите меня закидывать тапками. Графика в игре выполнена в своём уникальном стиле, и это однозначный плюс. Да, безусловно, графон не претендует на фотореалистичность, но камон, этот стиль игре идеально подходит, к тому же выглядит он вполне симпатично.

4) Конструктор кораблей и физика поведения. Тут комментировать особо не буду - Вам просто нужно это попробовать, ведь именно за проектированием кораблей Вы будете проводить львиную часть игрового времени. И это ни разу не надоедает (по крайней мере, лично мне). Плюс заставило припомнить школьные основы физики и геометрии, за что спасибо. )

5) Система развития игрока и исследования галактики. Всё довольно логично, интересно и затягивает с первых минут игры. В целом - твёрдый плюсик.

[h1]Минусы[/h1]

Все мы знаем, что игр без минусов не бывает. И этот маленький Masterpiece - не исключение.

1) Достаточно мелких багов, которые хоть и не ломают игру, но в целом мешают. Из того что поймал я - после открытия некоторых частей усиленной брони за фракцию с ядеркой (забыл как называется), во время проектировки кораблей, детальки не хотели зеркально отражаться. Лечится перезапуском игры.
Ещё кораблики которые производятся на фабрике, иногда застряют в корпусе вашего корабля каким-то магическим образом. В остальном - ничего критичного пока не заметил.

2) Всё же не хватает какой-то сюжетной линии. Я понимаю, что нужно либо делать хорошо, либо не делать вообще (что собс-но и выбрали разрабы в случае с сюжетом). Но энивей, какие-то намёки на сюжет не помешали бы, и могли бы увеличить играбельность проекта ещё на сколько-то там часов.

3) В такой игрушке мультиплеер - должен быть обязательно. Я, когда её покупал, не обратил внимания что его нет, думал что это само собой разумеющееся в игре с весёлым мочиловом, но его здесь нет от слова совсем. Ждём, в любом случае должны добавить, ведь это чуть ли не самое интересное в играх.
UPD: В игре есть слабенький намёк на имитацию мультиплеера - по галактике странствуют флоты, построенные другими реальными игроками, но под управлением AI. Они называются Агентами, и поверьте, порой бывают действительно очень достойные противники, которые на своём пути сносят все союзные станции, заставляя вас в очередной раз орать ""ДА КАААААК?"".

[h1]Заключение[/h1]

Если вам не принципиально наличие мультиплеера в игре (по крайней мере пока что), и нравится что-то создавать/исследовать + романтика космоса/космических кораблей, то этот продукт однозначно стоит попробовать. Минусы хоть и есть, но они перекрываются плюсами с лихвой, так что вердикт - РЕКОМЕНДУЮ К ПОКУПКЕ.

Спасибо за внимание, скиньте лайк чтобы я понял, что не зря писал этот текст. Удачи! :)

[h1]Preamble[/h1]

I've made a big ship, spawned a huge fleet, flew around the galaxy, conquering everyone, and already thought that the game would not suck me in for more than a couple of hours, because everything is monotonous and there are no opponents that will kick my ass... But then I come up with a brilliant idea - to fly and see what is there in the center of the universe? I flew in the sectors where plants reign... Brah, thought I, plants? Rly?. As soon as I got close to them, my entire fleet turned into cosmic dust in about two minutes. Well, this is definitely 10 out of 10, dandelions have not humiliated me ever before! :D
Well at least managed to escape... Then I began to suspect that this game is not so simple as I thought...

[h1]Pros[/h1]

And yes, I was right.

1) There is really enough content in the game, especially as the DLC came out, which I had not yet reached, but judging by its description, this is musthave. You can move your fleet through the wormholes into an infinite number of procedurally generated (as I understood) galaxies.This is basically sandbox style, what means that it can take more than a dozen hours. Add to this the fact that the cosmos really looks alive, the NPCs are very numerous and they interact with each other, regardless of the player’s actions.

2) Artifical Intelligence (AI). It is here. *trollface* And, objectively, it is even not such bad! The game does not bother monotonous behavior of opponents. They behave very differently, for example, if they see that they have a numerical advantage - they will begin to push by quantity, and vice versa, if your fleet is much stronger - they will gently kite or just run away.
In addition, the behavior of bots depending of their faction. Here works principle of StarCraft - the red/yellow fractions are more inclined to aggressively crush with a large number of units, the blue/black/pink ones are the fractions that cling to technology, and the green ones (farmers) are growing plants! *lol*

3) Graphics. No, no, I am not getting cranky, do not hurry to throw slippers at me. The graphics in the game made in its own unique style, and this is a definite plus. Yes, of course, graphics does not pretend to be photorealistic, but come on, such style perfectly fits to this game, besides it looks quite nice.

4) Ship Design and Physics Behavior. You will spend half of the game time, constructing your fleet. Personally, I'm sick of it. Plus, I was forced to remember the school fundamentals of physics and geometry, for which thanks. )

5) Player development system and galaxy research. Everything is quite logical, interesting and excites from the first minutes of the gameplay. In general - a solid ""A"" grade.

Cons:
- It is definitely a indie title, very unpolished in some area.
- Controls are very wonky, unresponsive at certain times.
- Unbalanced/broken units uploaded by other players to ruin a map clear. (See summary)
- Your fleet will randomly dissapear when traveling emptier parts of the map.

Summary:
I really wanted to like this game, but the fact that it's a indie titles shines through. My main annoyance is that it wants you to explore but if you try to explore at anything but a snails pace you end up losing more than half your fleet, making you feel like  a necromancer in diablo 2 jumping between teleports, randomly losing your minions. Also, people like to upload broken/unkillable agents that make it so that you can't kill them, and they teleport directly to your units. (I ran into a invincible saw blade agent that would teleport into the middle of my units when i left its area.) So it makes the game unenjoyable when trying to clear a map. It's a good weekend game if you can get it for 5$ and look past the above annoyances.

到了一定的数量之后，我的随从和空间站就不再造新的飞船了。即使仓库的原料已经满了也不会造新飞船。

视野不能自由移动，只能以你的船为中心，结果就是如果你要观察前线的战况并指挥你的部队，就必须亲自移动到前线沐浴敌人的炮火。一旦你死了，你所有的部队就会解散！！！！重新招募他们就又要花钱！作者你和玩家有多大仇才要设计成这样？？？？？
队友会抢我的资源！！抢我的资源！！抢我的资源！！抢走了它又不造船！！！抢走了它又不造船！！！抢走了它又不造船！！！
有一个种族有核弹，一发秒一切！！！一旦你的船爆了，你的整个舰队就会全部解散！！全部解散！！全部解散！！一发回到解放前！！！一发回到解放前！！！一发回到解放前！！！再加上视角不能自由移动，你只有跑到战线最前面才能看到战况并且指挥！！！！这真是个灾难！！！！！！！！

如果看作RTS游戏，操作方式实在是反人类，平衡性完全没有，没有侦察要素，AI智商也很捉急，连基本的寻路都没有，被石头挡住了不知道绕路，硬往石头上怼，直到把自己怼爆了。

Each piece of your ship that you add has mass, and you need to balance that mass with boosters, weapons, shields, generators and everything else. Sure you can build a super bulky tank, but unless you throw tons of boosters on there you're going to be slow as mollases. If your ship is light enough you can even move it around via the recoil from your weapons.

There's multiple different races each with their own weapons and quirks. Some have really fast boosters, others have nukes or multiple types of shields. Some of the races feel a bit unfinished and have rather limited options, but they're all unique nontheless.

If you want the short version of what I have to say, then I [u]absolutely[/u] reccomend this game for anyone who likes either building things or modding games.

If you want the more in-depth version of what was just said, then continue reading.

[h1]What is Reassembly?[/h1]

Reassembly is, in my opinion, best viewed as a modding and creative sandbox. You have a few vanilla/base game factions to pick from to introduce you to the mechanics of the game, and to the campaign mode where your objective is total conquest of the map. There is also the steam workshop which is home to many user-made mods of varying quality and age.

[h1]Base Game / Vanilla Gameplay[/h1]

Vanilla campaign mode can, unfortunately, begin to grow stale after a while once you've obtained all of the factions. However, that isn't saying there is [i]nothing[/i] to do beyond that, however. You can begin to refine your ship designs in the direction of either form or function, and if you join [url=https://discord.gg/BM4eeqS]the Reassembly Discord Server[/url], you'll find other professional ship builders to confer with, as well as the occasional tournament to participate in if you enjoy competitive building.

[h1]Modding, and Why You Should Learn to Mod Reassembly[/h1]

I'll put it simply: [b]Reassembly has one of the easiest-to-learn, hard-to-master modding APIs of any game I've come across.[/b]

If you indeed have interest in picking up reassembly modding, there are many guides on the subject and while most of them are a bit dated by this point, a lot of the basic rules still apply. Recently modding has gotten even better with things such as custom cannon barrel size/amount being added, as well as support for custom backgrounds. There are planty of mods to [strike]steal from[/strike] [i]take inspiration from[/i] on the workshop, some of excellent quality, some not so much. If you put the time in to truly master modding, you will be capable of some truly amazing things that put the vanilla factions to shame. [i]This[/i] is probably the biggest reason I would reccomend Reassembly to someone for. Seriously, at least [i]try[/i] it, and if you aren't impressed, it isn't the end of the world as there is also plenty of mods you can simply subscribe to on the workshop and mess around with.

[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]

Overall, I think Reassembly is a hidden gem. It's [b]$15[/b] (without any discounts) for near-endless amounts of gameplay and creative opportunities. Even without the modding aspect of the game, there's at least a solid 50 hours of gameplay in store with the vanilla factions alone. If you are even [i]remotely[/i] interested in top-down space games, ship-building sandboxes, or modding, then you should by all means pick up Reassembly.",1544934217,1544934217,True,6,0,0.58311915397644043,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Upgrading and building ships is straightforward. Conquering a galaxy is quite fun. There are mods that add alternative starting factions (or even completely change everything).

Cons: 
Zero story whatsoever. You're a ship with an allied faction and a galaxy full of enemies. That's the story.
If you build a fleet, your wingships don't generally work very well. They target what you target, and that's about it. You can release them and they will go about their business, but mostly idel. Useful for holding territory though.

Pros: Good gameplay. You can play at the level of anywhere from a single ship farming resources to slowly build up your faction all the way to a massive dreadnought leaving a trail of destruction wherever you go. You can build a fleet and spread them throughout the galaxy to claim turf. If you like customizing ships, it's very easy to snap together blocks and build a wide variety of ships. You can drop the schematics for these into allied stations (or stations that you build, even), and they will automatically build them as soon as they get enough resources to do so.

It's a great sandbox game with a small community building new factions for players to play.

Collect resources, defend bases, kill enemies. Explore the map to uncover more areas which contain deactivated bases for one to reactivate, as well as more enemies (quantity and type). There seem to be several enemy factions, which one can unlock for play as one progresses through the game. Ships are thoroughly modularised, and as one progresses through the game, one can earn currency which can then be used to purchase more or different modules - related to increasing efficiency in resource collection, defense, and attack.

It seems as if one of the draws is to eventually create the perfect space fighter, with modules up the wazoo. One has the choice of creating monstrosities of random pieces all over the place, or making something beautiful and pragmatic. I think there is a mechanic to uptake enemy faction modules but I have not progressed far enough to encounter this feature.

The graphics are very basic but it is very serviceable to the type of game. So to are the sound effects. No complaints from me.

I usually play much slower-paced games, so I currently find this game to be a bit more frenetic than what I am used to, but it definitely provides that action if that's what one is after. I drifted into a heavily patrolled enemy area and was immediately beset by 3 different warring factions and... well... died very quickly. It's definitely an exciting experience.

It's interesting, fun, challenging and intriguing at first and worth buying if you're fine with having a couple of hours worth of fun and possibly not much more. There's a point where there's no more functionality to discover and then it's all up to how much you like the game mechanics, which is mostly flying around and shooting, which can be plenty satisfying on it's own.

One big drawback for me is the fleet you can build. It's rather expensive (your ship collects, say, ""matter"" which can be either traded into fleet or permanent coins, used for upgrades or your own ship potential) especially since:
a) it can be decimated almost instasntly in some events
b) it can get lost if it can't keep up

Which for me sort of defeats the purpose of building fleet, especially later in the game, and that's sad cause leading fleet is fun. Other than that some small improvements for the ship builder would be nice, but it's very good and fun to use anyways.",1542334862,1542334862,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Each faction at the purchase of this game is unique in how they function, some factions are easier then others because of this. But over comming the difficulty of combat using your on inqenuity to not only claim sectors of space but to duke it out with the big boy AI in this game feels good.

Its especially fun to import your own fleet... so you can fight your meta of that faction while playing the faction you orgnially designed your ships to fight. Fun shit. (steam workshop is open for this game.. So i belive you can just dump some one uploaded fleet for some more interesting fights). It also super fun to fly thru former frontlines and see the floating debris. Trying to navigate a fragile and super fast fighter thru graveyards of dead ships and crashing into the hulls of dead capital ships you killed hours ago is really... cathartic.

You start out weak and have to grow in power by fighting even weaker enemy ships;
You die, rush in to try to get your resources back, then die again until you maybe get that stuff back
You see all the cool parts you can put in your ship and dream of making the prettiest and most well though-out ship and fleet;
You die some more;
You make your ship more powerful, using that super cool strategy you made up;
You go out to test your super cool strategy against enemies and die;
You get more parts and continue upgrading your ship;
As you keep dieing and adapting your ships you realize there's no one strategy that can make sure you always win, so you make the ships to your heart's desire;
You attach a factory block to your ship and get crazy power hunger and try to create the biggest fleet ever;
It's harder than it looks and they all die;
You die too by the way;
OH GOD AN AGENT IS COMING FOR ME;
The agent (super strong player-made fleet) slowly but surely makes their way to you;
They wreck literally all the opposition in the way, leavng behind a path of doom;
You run from them while trying to get stronger, and eventually think you're strong enough;
You aren't;
You die to the agent many times as you insist you can beat them after 10 tries;
OH GOD THERE'S 3 MORE;
The agents eventually converge to a single point right next to one of your stations and fail to destroy each other;
You somehow beat one of them;
Die 413 times to the others;
Beat them as well;
Fragments of agents, your once glorious fleet and some killer plants are scattered all over the place;
A random ship comes out of nowhere and wrecks you;
There are no winners in war, only losers.

Also, there's a lot of grinding and fighting gigantic bee/ plant cities that swarm you with bullets, as your fleet fails to do anything remotely logic.
There's a lot of death and grind, so it can get kinda frustrating. However, designing and adapting your ships is pretty fun, and seeing your crazy strategies work out against the OP agents is quite rewarding. So, overall, the game is just cool. Not the most fun game, but simply cool.
Also ,the developers actually listen to the players and fix the bugs, so that's nice.
And there's a Steam Workshop filled with varied mods.

I thoroughly enjoyed every second I played of this game, both vanilla and modded, and consider it to be one of the better games I have played on Steam. The ship customization is robust and freeform, the combat and movement systems are intuitive and well made, and every faction felt entirely different to every other faction you could play, allowing for virtually infinite numbers of experiences.

However, the game did lose it's spark after a while for me; without a true reason to come back to the game, a compelling story or an evil you must overcome, it seemed to be built purely to have fun whenever you got bored and not call you back for more every time you finished playing.

On the whole, I would argue it is worth the purchase, but if you do not have the commitment to play a game that doesn't call you back for any reason other than ""I want to play it,"" don't feel bad for giving this game a safe pass.",1539544160,1539544160,True,3,0,0.50432276725769043,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You build spaceships out of 2D geometric shapes. Balance energy generation, thruster power and placement, total hull strength and shape, and weaponry. You have a limited total point limit (P) to work with. Increase P with C. Earn C by selling R to friendly stations, or by exploring. Get R from harvesting plants or killing enemy ships and stations.

The game plays out much more like a petri dish of evolving life in an ecosystem, except you're the one doing most of the evolving. If I had to suggest two things, it would be that there be more permanent landmarks of sorts (planets, or notable points worth fighting over) and that factions would expand, grow, and shrink on their own, even when the player isn't present. A native option to disable Agents would be nice too, although there's a mod for that.

There's also a lot of neat custom faction mods, featuring bizarre block palettes and more powerful enemy fleets to face off against. It's at least worth the asking price, really.

Pros: 
It looks pretty. There are many factions to play as. Each faction has their own modules for the well-built ship designer. There are thousands of new blocks, and hundreds of new factions, you can play as (and against) by installing workshop mods. You can develop a fleet, including ships that build other ships which then build other ships. There is a decent variety of weapons (beams, missiles, projectiles, etc). Early-game exploration is very easy to get into, and the tutorial while not perfect is very, very good. Keybind options also allow you to set any weapon to 'autofire' (fires automatically against all enemy ships) or 'point defense' (as autofire, but also targets missiles). So, the controls are a lot less fiddly than you'd expect, given the customization options. Multiple control schemes are supported, too, so whether you want to use the mouse or not, the game has you covered.

Cons: 
There is not as much depth as you'd think there would be. Many of the ship modules are just resized versions of each other.  Technically each faction has its own series of reactor modules, but aside from some different numbers, they're functionally the same. At a certain point you will have a ship that has enough shields and focused DPS to take on any other ship in the game, at which point... there is suddenly very little left to do. Workshop mods can add more content, yes, but they're not remotely balanced, and as a result while there may be more content there probably won't be a lot more challenge. The AI is prone to using your ship designs, which can lead to out-of-control ship self-multiciplication if you're creating a ship entirely devoted to factory production rather than combat. Speaking of which, it is trivial to bypass the entire game's progression system by simply adding more and more resource-producing modules to your ship (which create resources out of thin air) and sitting next to a station so they're all instantly traded for currency, which you then use to purchase permanent upgrades. Within 30 minutes of doing this, you can unlock everything available to your faction, without ever fighting any other ship. This is the sort of thing I mean when I say the game has some balance issues.

Overall: 
This is a visually pretty, easy-to-pick-up, and surprisingly fun spaceship combat/design game. It isn't the deepest such game, and it certainly isn't the most strategic, but what you do get is accessible and fun. You won't play it for a very long time, but for the time you do play it, you'll probably enjoy it.",1537256667,1537256698,True,24,1,0.730597734451293945,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:
-  Like a better version of Spores first level. 
-  Like an endless version of S.P.A.Z.
-  Craft your own ships and reassemble it to anything you can come up with.
-  Make biological ships that look like cells (probably something what intelligent beings would build anyway.)
-  I really like the customization involved, i'd like to see more weapon and ship colour choices though.
-  Design deployable fleets. (Kinda like drones)
-  Properly good weapons and 2D visuals.

Cons:
-  Some of the player made 'Agent' fleets are insane, which require farmed resource to beat, I don't think you can gather them quick enough.
-  Not much assistance from the player capturable bases. (It'd be nice to have a mini instant fleet, or some missions.)
-  Biological / spherical ship designs with high shielding and one type of directed / aimed weapon are likely to win overall. 
-  More explanation about how the mass and thrust ratio aters ship handling would be nice.
      - Ideally I want to know how to counteract mass heavy gun arrarys to still be fast in space. 
      - Obviously I could add more thrusters, but where, and why in that location?
-  Colours are typically 2D(retro), but does your head in a bit, too neon.

Being able to build your own ship completely from scratch using tons of different blocks is always fun. This works especially well this the game comes with mod support.

The cons... 
As most people have complained controlling your ship is incredibly difficult. Especially once you start building your own ship or thruster start getting blown off. 

The game has a steep learning curve. You are given a few base blueprints but almost immediately will be adding to these bases which you're absolutely going to mess up. I guess a lot of the fun is learning what works anyway?

The blocks don't always fit together. It's important in ship design to try to keep your ship compact and as connected as possible. Unfortunately, block shapes often make this impossible. You'll be fighting with angles and tiny gaps frequently unless you stick to square blocks which limits your functionality.

Agents are a pro and a con. They're better than you, and you'll find this out quickly. They're designed by people with the same max ship size as you, but with a far better understanding of ship design, alongside a quickly regenerating fleet. It's a challenge but often frustrating.

It's fascinating with the simple graphics that gets combined into such weird things as the game progresses. 

You harvest ""space flowers"" and trade up. Your ship is entirely of your own design limited only by the current max threshold, but that will rise when you get more experience. At one point you can make bad ass battleships that can produce other ships, of your choosing.  Suddenly you swing along not-so-empty space with a whole armada of minions helping you.

After the ship designing, the best feature of the game is the regeneration. Say you dive into an enemy nest and after a while you realize that this will not work, then you escape and the ship will slowly regenerate as if nothing happened.

And the music is awesome. It really captures the feeling of being alone in the big black space, and it also captures the feeling of ""things are heating up, I better watch out"" and so on.

The amazing thing is it's simplicity. R is the only resource, P is the only limit on ship size, and C is your only upgrade/tech point. Collect R (either find it or kill enemies and steal it from them), carry R back to base to get C, then spend C to increase P and unlock modules. Then rebuild your ship as desired. Perfect. Oh, and all ships in the game heal themselves slowly over time which keeps it action-oriented (at least when you're not trying to improve your ship design). 

There's actually a little more to it than that, such as the ability to command fleets of ships and use a factory module on your ship to build more ships, but even without that it's fun as hell. After 7 hours I haven't even gotten into that part yet and I'm already amazed.

The graphics are very minimalist vector style but still kind of flashy with all the particle effects. No complaints there. And the music is good too.

So don't buy this expecting a detailed economic simulation with space trading, a storyline, technological realism, or any of that stuff.

自由度较高的造船小游戏,可以带领舰队在沙盘大地图上四处战斗.

缺点:
1. 游戏内容有点少

2. 游戏平衡性不足,不说那些太强和太弱的势力. 这游戏的无人机发射器就是摆设,几乎没有输出,导弹飞得比船还慢,让某些依靠无人机或导弹攻击的势力难度增加.

3. 游戏没有稳定的资源再生系统,除了有电板/能自己生产资源的势力外. 其它势力的资源获取都十分困难. 植物生长的陨石/植物本身可被完全破坏,有些植物的生长循环过程太短,无法铺开植物生长,导致后期整个地图的资源量都十分稀少.

4. 舰队飞船脱离玩家一定范围就被判定丢失,这对巨大舰队玩家十分不友好. 并且飞船ai本身也有问题,会被陨石等各种障碍物卡住导致丢失. 在游戏后期,一艘3000p的飞船丢失,对于资源紧缺并且地图上资源荒芜的势力来说是个非常大的损失.

5. 游戏经常出现的诡异的碰撞体积bug. 例如飞船莫名奇妙的被弹开几个屏幕距离. 植物生长在飞船外壳上时,退出再载入游戏,那些植物就会浮空并且依然判定为生长在船上,由于浮空植物带来的飞船体积增加判定,会给船带来很大的阻力. 一些飞船在再生船体的时候会与其它飞船的船体重叠卡住,导致两艘船移动困难. 更换飞船图纸时,会被自身拆开的零件瞬间挤爆飞船核心.
(建议游戏在飞船判定为卡住时暂时关闭碰撞体积让飞船回到正常位置上)

6. 游戏经常经常崩溃,每次游戏崩溃再进入时就相当于旗舰被打爆一次,下属舰船与资源都没了. 猜测与游戏优化有关,此bug导致我无法完成那个占领100%地图的成就. 地图探索地区越多,整个地图单位越多,越容易崩溃. 现在已经没有耐心继续游戏.

7. 飞船ai很蠢,会撞墙卡住导致丢失,还会一头撞死在陨石上,另外两艘船之间有陨石障碍时飞船很少会绕开飞行,而是两艘船隔着陨石疯狂攻击石头.",1529838184,1577702749,False,111,23,0.80615764856338501,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ok, I have scene a LOT of reviews for this game saying that it not worth getting. And I have to say, I kinda see where they are coming from. There are parts of this game that are kinda boring, the flying/shooting in this game isn't spectacular, and it's kinda buggy (sometimes the bugs are funny though). However, I can most if not all of this games faults becuase of its greatest strength:

The ship building system. OH MY GOSH is it good. You know how this game's building mechanics are frequently compared to legos? Well, let me tell you, that's accurate. The building mechanic are so good, it single-handedly upgrades this from a compitent but generic shootemup with pretty but equally generic graphics to one of the most fun games I have ever played.

Ok, I can't really do this game justice telling you how good it is. So let me tell you my experience with my first faction:

So, early on, I had a tiny, weak ship, as you alwias start with. I go about the game as normal for a while. Maybe an hour in, I come accross a huge station by another faction. WAY too big for me to handle by myself. But I didn't. There were a lot of AI ships in my faction nearby. And we were all teaming up on this big huge station. None of us capable of handelling it ourselves, but together, we beat it. It really made like I was a part of something bigger, like I was fighting for the greater good of my faction.

Fast foward a bit. I now have a huge ship, with a massive fleet fallowing me. I'm no longer a part of something bigger. I'm not longer fighting for the greater good of my faction. I AM the greater good of my faction. I have risen through the ranks and now I am leading my faction towards greatness.

I can't garantee that you will have an experince as good as mine. But if it's even half as good as mine, you are going to love this game. I have played as eight factions (all seven of the vinella factions and one modded faction) and as of writting I am making my own modded faction, and I'm still not bored of this game.",1527829893,1527829893,True,17,0,0.627982139587402344,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Минусы:
Ограничение в P (Можно построить корабль максимум в 12500P, я с модом строю до 92000) (После обновления мод перестал работать, но я нашел замену Reassembly Overhaul (No Music) нужно его скачать и поставить первым в списке модов!!!)
Странные фризы при [strike]большом[/strike]  количестве кораблей даже на хорошем пк (Очень большом количестве кораблей, еще это зависит от маштаба камеры, чем больше корабль тем больше маштаб)

You start with a small ship and head out into a galaxy filled with varied but distinct factions. Destroyed enemies and space plants that die off naturally both drop ""R""esources.

It won't be long before you get into real meat of the game - the ship desginer! With familiar features like drag-selecting blocks, duplicating, mirroring, and so on, it's very easy and satisfying to use. Blocks snap together at points on their edges, just like Lego. Each faction has its own palette of blocks and technologies that can somewhat limit the range of designs you can build, but there are loads of mods that offer expanded palettes and even entirely new factions with their own custom block shapes.

Eventually you'll add a factory block to your ship and start creating a self-replicating doom fleet - but watch out for ""Agents"", the game's system of asynchronous multiplayer! They are groups of ships designed by other players around the world and uploaded to the Reassembly servers via wormholes. Each new game you play includes some of these player fleets for extra Fun (tm). You never now how lethal they will be until you meet them, so be sure to prepare a capable fleet first...

With a sublime chill soundtrack and crisp vector graphics, the hours will fly by while you Reassemble your way toward taking over the entire galaxy. It's also a plus that the game runs smoothly on pretty much any PC or laptop from the last decade.

But vague, incomplete comparisons aside, Reassembly is a game where the player selects a faction and is dropped into a 2D galaxy sandbox where here is no particular win condition. Dropping into the game, the game states that ships similarly-colored to the player ship and — apart from some tutorials to teach the player how to do stuff — just turns the player loose.

[h1]Early Game[/h1]
Some immediate goals the game may give to the player is to reactivate the faction's stations. What defines a station in this game is simply a ship without thrusters and they usually have ship factories. The initial situation seems to be that the player faction was pushed back by some galactic enemies, as there are destroyed factories in enemy space that need reactivated. Station reactiviation itself is easy, the player needs only to hover next to the station for about 5 seconds. The trick, however, is clearing the area of hostiles, which is hard early on with the small starter ship.

[h1]Mid Game[/h1]
Eventually new components can be purchased as well as higher ""build caps"" so the player can build bigger ships to make themselves more combat effective. This is around the time agents might wander into the player faction's territory. Agents are ships that another player built and sent through a wormhole that ended up in the player's game. These ships are AI controlled, but they're typically pretty overpowered and are sometimes built in some stupid ""meta"" fashion without any kind of aesthetically pleasing elements. They're hard to kill, but it's doable. If they're too hard, I'd recommend just slapping a bunch of missiles on a ship and bombarding them from afar.

[h1]Late Game[/h1]
Later in the game, the player probably has a massive dreadnaught that can stand up to pretty much anything. With everything unlocked, though, it gives thet player more options for ship design experimentation. Most if not all of the agents spread around the galaxy have probably been dealt with at this point. This is pretty much where the only thing left to do is galactic conquest, creative experimentation, exploration, or just starting a new save with another faction.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
There's not much to say about the combat - it's just great. It's crisp, the weapons feel good, and the combat feels physics-based because of the way ships break apart when their core is destroyed. (Which is very satisfying to watch. I'll make an [url=https://imgur.com/a/KjoE9]Imgur album[/url] of moments like that)

[h1]A Living World[/h1]
The AI in this game is actually cool. Enemy ships might attack the player on sight if the player seems vulnerable or just run away if the player has a massive dreadnaught as mentioned in the Late Game section. Stations in this game build ships, those ships go out and gather this thing called ""R,"" (something that grows on asteroids) bring it back to the station, and that station can use the gathered R to build more ships.

Unfortunately, the AI doesn't seem smart enough to form up and attack other factions, as I have witnessed them just hanging out around their station, but it's still cool how the AI has something to keep themselves busy instead of just wandering aimlessly. It's not as if factions never collide in this game, they just don't seem to ever coordinate attacks.

[h1]Factions[/h1]
As mentioned, this game has multiple factions. [url=http://reassembly.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Playable_Factions]The playable[/url] factions are Terran, Farmer, Tinkrells, Bees, Crystallitet, Sentinel, and Red; Terran being the default faction. What I didn't mention is how stylized and inspired each faction is. They're not just recolors of the default faction, each faction has their own aesthetic, build patterns, ship parts, naming conventions, etc. This allows the player to project an ideology onto said factions. The Red faction gives off a galactic tyrant vibe, so I kill them on sight, the Farmer faction has a pretty peaceful-looking aesthetic, so I generally avoid them, and the other factions seem to give off something in between, so I sort of just treat them as neutral.

There are other factions, but the playable factions seem to make up the bulk of the game. Factions are unlocked by destroying the largest ship (The flagship, basically) of said faction. I'm not sure where the game positions these flagships, as I've only ever encountered them by accident. They're not [b]that[/b] big, but they are the largest ships in their respective faction. I remember the Crystallites in particular had some pretty big ships, indimidatingly so. I actually had to spend some time drilling into their flagship with torpedos (Very powerful weapons) to bring it down.

[h1]What Happens Next?[/h1]
In the time I've put into the game, about 40 hours were spent on the default faction. I wasn't focusing on galactic conquest, but such a task would be pretty tedious and I was mostly just messing around with a beautiful and unstoppable ship I created. After a while, I created a new save with the Tinkrells faction and they are [b]very[/b] different from the Terrans. Terran ships are more about having a wide array of weapons to choose from, weapons expected of human ships, and Tinkrell ships are more about weapon amplification. Through stackable muzzle attachments that amplify damage, fire-rate, range, and projectile velocity, the player can experiment to create multiple different flavors of plasma cannon, which is what serves as the base of all of this faction's projectile weaponry.

Another playstyle the player can engage in is never actualy designing a ship. That's right, this game actually supports a playstyle that involves never having to design a ship. Going into command mode, (Default: 2) the player can target allied ships. While mousing over an allied ship, the player can then bring up their ship design storage (Default: 3) which will then populate the target ship design into the main window, name and all, where the player can then drag it into the design storage area. [url=https://i.imgur.com/L2BiPvl.png]Here's[/url] a screenshot of what I mean. All of those entries are copied from my faction's default ships that I've seen flying around. I've even been copying station designs.

[h1]Building a Fleet[/h1]
This is a good time to get into how fleet building works. Fleet AI is very basic. You can only tell them — and I mean all of them at once, order groups aren't a thing — to Disengage, Engage Your Target, and Fire At Will. It's basic, but not in a bad way - it does what it needs to do.

New ships are built be having a factory attached to the player's ship with enough room to spit out the core of the ship that's being built. Once the core has been spit out, the ship will build itself and be the player's minion. They even give the R they collect to the player, which is mega cool. This is also how new factories are built, which is a critical part of holding territory. If there isn't a factory churning out new ships, the sector isn't going to hold.

[h1]Playstyles[/h1]
Why is the ""Building a Fleet"" section below the ""What Happens Next?"" section? Because I got through my entire playthrough without focusing on building ships and factories. I just wandered the galaxy in an unstoppable doom dreadnaught designed to near-perfection. I only started focusing on building ships and factories on my new save.

So this is a game that's more or less about designing cool ships, and it allows for a playstyle where the player copies designs from already-existing ships instead of making custom ones. This game is a good example of how a sandbox is done.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
This game is good for creative people, same goes for a lot of other games I praise. Go play Captain Forever, which is a free browser game that's similar to Reassembly. If you liked playing that game, you can probably justify dropping $15 on this game.

While simplistic, the game offers amazing gameplay and a good deal of replayability in the form of both default factions as well as modded factions. Each faction brings something different to the table. Some are combat oriented, other factions focus on defense, and some even focus on things like farming or cranking out hives.

鋼鉄の咆哮2の代わりとなるゲームを探しているときに偶然見つけて購入。宇宙植物や倒した敵艦から資源を回収しつつ宇宙船のP(容量)に頭を悩ませてスラスター、シールド武装などのパーツをくっつけて自分だけの宇宙船を建造しましょう。完成した船で他の勢力や非同期マルチによる他プレイヤーの作った船エージェントと戦いながらマップ全体を自分の勢力に変えていくのが今のところの目的でしょうか。

最初は基本的なパーツしかなく、最弱なレッドの小型艦にも苦戦するかもしれません。せっかく作った船がプラントイズのとげの飽和攻撃で宇宙ゴミに変えられるかもしれません。
でも落ち込む必要はありませんしやられても持っていたR（資源）を失うだけです。近くに自軍のステーションがあれば何度でも復活できます。
最初は自軍ステーションで資源を換金してP（容量）を上げならがより強力なパーツを買って自分の船を強化していきましょう。やがて自分で最高戦艦が作れたと思ったら巻き返しのときです。
でも、忘れてはいけないことがあります。どんな強力な船でも単艦では敵に数で圧倒されててしまうことがあるかもしれません。そのときはこちらも従属艦をかき集めて対抗しましょう。多数の艦隊で敵を圧倒するのもひとつの楽しみ方です。うっとおしいプラントイズも強力な戦艦や数に物を言わせた量産型戦闘艇だろうと従属艦の力があればゴミ掃除同然に排除できるでしょう。

ブロックの形に制限はあるものの、発想しだいで様々な船が作れます。双胴戦艦、大型爆撃機やウサギ型ロケットなども作れます。あなただけの最強の船でマップを制覇しましょう！",1521889012,1521889012,True,7,0,0.625292301177978516,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Once with old mods, so i removed them, then once with only 1 new mod, so I removed that and uninstalled the game, reinstalled it, it crashed 5 minutes after starting with no mods.

PS : Si votre vaisseau est difficile à contrôler c'est qu'il est mal conçu... Il faut adapter la quantité de boosters au poids du vaisseau et essayer de garder le centre de gravité au milieu du vaisseau (la petite flèche rouge au centre du vaisseau quand vous êtes en mode construction). 
Parfois je préfère décaler le centre de gravité vers l'arrière pour tourner plus vite ou au contraire vers l'avant pour être plus stable en ligne droite, cela dépend de mon choix d'armes... Merci de m'avoir lu.

Bad:

With enjoyable combat and clear goals, you don't get bored of playing. The music is stunning. It definitly has a learning curve, ecpecaly with the ship editor.

But, with a decent pc it is fine. I have an i5 with a 1060 3gb, and 8 gbs of ram, and it runs flawlessly. Gameplay wise, it is extreamly fun, for the first 50 to 70 hours, but then exploring and minor ship upgrades begin to feel repetitive. That's were the classes come in. By destorying an enemy ship over 1000 p, you can play as it. This allows for nigh on infinite gameplay, and is well done. Each class has somthing defined and special about it that makes it feel like a new and fresh experiance. The only thing is, you may find is that the grind will get very intence later on.

Some weapons or parts might cost over 20000 of the games currency, but it is ok that it does, because it adds much more staying power for the game, because you will feel motivated to play it more. I have played over 8 full days of this game (Over around a month), and my only real complaint would be the lack of classes like borg being vanilla playable, or classes like 15, who you don't even see! Also, there is a screensaver mode for some reason, and its beutiful, but not implemented or usable for some reason. 

Pros: 
Many hours of entertainment
Well made
Cheap
Controller support
Beautiful
Gives you that happy feeling
Trigger happy

Cons:
Not quite done in a few small senses

The graphics could have been done on an Amiga 500 with its very good vector graphics capabilities and would fit there very good too (-> retro style). The 'what nice thing could I change next on ship (s)' works very well and keep you playing for hours.

The other side of the medal unfortunately is that the game runs good only on windows with the recommended hardware settings (but there I had no crashes and strange behaviour yet). It seems that the game was tested only on better graphics cards and perhaps nvidia only? My laptop AMD card does not work that good. On linux I get no visuals at all.

The controls work good but still need some fine tuning: menu flows, showing the state of used controls.

Perhaps it should have been marked as early access game so far even if there is hardware out there were it works flawlessly. It is still beta in my opinion.

You quickly get the mod and find a lot of cool factions you want to try out most of the have their unique playstyle and some are just remoddels of the standard factions. 

This game is not for every person. It's a sandbox filled with asteroids and enemy battleships. Most of your time will actually be found in the creator designing spacecrafts that can survive anything.

The game's entirely battle oriented, no trading, diplomacy or anything that would make you want to go somewhere. Instead just let the bosses (which are underwhelming if you have 100+ ships) come to you.

Also note that development seems to have stopped. Whatever community's left seems to be because of the workshop support, which is always a plus.

EVERY time you play is  completely different.

Overall I HIGHLY recommend this game, even if just as a pastime. Might not necessarily seem fun to some of you but blink and hours have passed.



Only a few things I'd recommend for the devs to...tweak:

1) Don't make space so bland!! Where are all the nebula and black holes and planets and stars and all the beauty that makes space sooooooo interesting and [welcoming?]!! Even if just in the background it would be great to see something other than darkness.

2) Make drones mean something!! When only effective when ALL YOUR POINTS are thrown into drone launchers, there's no room for being able to combine them with other weapons. Except as a distraction they're practically useless.

3) Why not add some of the most popular mod factions into the game itself? (Disclosures included of course).

It's a pretty simple game, where you build spaceships, blow up other spaceships for currency that you then use to build a bigger, better space ship. You start out as a tiny fighter, but by the end you will be controlling a 100-ship strong fleet to take over other galaxies.

 Since every ship, station and asteroid is made out of different shaped parts, each individual part has it's own health and can be destroyed. Because of this, when building your own ship there is a ton of strategy involved as you can't just slap parts together and hope that it works. There are hull parts, which are just basic blocks to use as armour or to get the right look on your ship, Thrusters, which you need to have all around your ship so that you can turn, reverse, brake etc and weapon/utility parts which can be something from a homing missile launcher to a shield generator to protect your ship. Each part requires uses up a certain amount of power and you can increase your total power by upgrading it. 

When you destroy an enemy, explore a new area of the map or re-claim a damaged station you get some of the games currency. You use said currency to do one of three things: Unlock new parts, which allows you to put an infinite number of said part on your ship as long as you don't go over your power limit, Hire ships to follow you around and join your fleet, or increase your power limit. You can also get 'resources' from a destroyed ship or a few other things which you can turn into currency by going to a station and trading with it, or spend to build a ship if you have a factory attached.  

There are multiple factions that are all randomly placed in the 100 x 100 or so grid map, which loops around if you go of one side. The factions do vary, and if you destroy a ship worth 1,000 currency from a faction you will unlock them to play as in a new game, instead of the default Terran faction. Factions will expand by them self, destroying ships of your faction and others to build more ships and stations for them self. Most of them will attack you on sight, but there is one faction that is passive and just harvests resources, making them a good early-game target to grow stronger fast. When you design a ship, your own faction will also build said ship every now and again so you can end up with a huge fleet of just your ships if you want.

There isn't really any end to reassembly, but there is a sort-of end goal to try and achieve. Conquer the galaxy. If you can explore every grid of the map, and wipe out every other faction from it, you will get an achievement and the game is essentially over. There are wormholes, however, that bring you to a brand-new galaxy so you can start all over but with a huge ship and a fleet that you brought with you. If you do this, your ship and fleet will appear in another players world as an AI controlled boss type of thing.

All in all, reassembly is a great game that can last for a very, very long time, especially if your into modding or just installing mods, and is a ton of fun no matter how many hours you've played for.",1505871933,1524808845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Where to start...
Reassembly throws you into a hostile universe, riddled with factions that care only about your destruction.
When starting, there is a very gradual, and intuitive learning curve, with just enough complexity to keep you coming back for more. Even after unlocking all factions, and playing with a few which are community created, I still find this game highly replayable. Reason? Space domination of course!

There still seem to be a few balancing issues with several of the factions, but this game is damn well polished.

- Very high replay value. With an endless combination of building possibilities, Reassembly rivals some of the more well known indie games. With multiple universes/galaxies to explore, and constantly discovering new player created enemies. I have to give this game a 9/10 for replayability alone

- Very nice points system (R, C, P). The system seems designed to make you feel very powerful, and like you are accomplishing a lot when playing. However it does not make you feel over powered (except some player created factions). Player factions aside this game makes you feel like you are getting your moneys worth. 10/10

- Excellent use of propulsion/collision, and super cool, almost retro feeling graphics make Reassembly feel very polished. 9/10

- Amazing ecosystems. Reassembly has one of the most organic ecosystems I have ever encountered. From enemies repopulating, to the way a single space plant can launch a seed, stick to another asteroid, and begin growing to produce more seeds and plants, alone, makes this game worth it's price point. ShUT UP AND TAkE MY MUNNY! 10/10

- Music. I don't even know how to explain this one - The soundtrack to Reassembly is one of the absolute best soundtracks you could ever hope for in a space game. It really makes you feel at home in the game, and is extremely well done. Whoever created the music for Reassembly deserves a raise of epic proportions! I would have to say that the soundtrack drew me in more than anything. Usually when playing a game, I like to mute the music volume, and play my own tunes, but with this, I just like to turn the music volume up! Bravo to the Maestro! 10/10

Overall I have to say that I have fully enjoyed the experience bestowed upon me by Reassembly. If you're thinking about getting this game, I absolutely recommend jumping the fence, and going for it! I hope to see updates to this game in the future, but as of right now, the game is amazing as it stands.

Overall score for this game:
9.7/10

Great game, and very cool creations by the community. You will enjoy this game, if your thing is ship building, and quasi space exploration.

ブロックを組み合わせてオリジナルの宇宙船を作って楽しむゲームだ。通常モードでは複数の陣営が争う宇宙を舞台に、敵陣営と戦いながら拠点を占領し勢力を拡大していく。
このゲームでは、船殻と兵器、スラスター、その他のブロックをつなぎ合わせて自由に宇宙船をデザインすることができる。宇宙船の核となるコマンドモジュールを破壊されると撃沈なので、コマンドモジュールを守るように攻撃力と防御力、機動力のバランスを考えてデザインする必要がある。ブロックには接合部位があるので、ブロック同士ができるだけ接合できるようにもする必要がある。序盤では使えるブロックが少ないので楽しさがいまいち分からないのかもしれないが、アップグレードしていくうちに面白くなってくる。意外にデザインに個性をつけることが可能だ。
作った宇宙船のデータはセーブデータとは別にエクスポートでき、他のデータをインポートして宇宙船のデータを取り込むこともできる。

[操作]
特徴的なのはスラスター操作で移動することだ。スラスターをWASDや方向キーで稼働し続ければ加速していき、方向キーを押さなければ減速する。急減速したいときには反対側のスラスターを稼働させるといった具合だ。方向キーに特定のスラスターが割り当てられるようなラジコン操作や、単に画面の上下左右方向に移動する操作など3タイプの操作から好みの操作を選択することができる。
攻撃については、マウスの左右ボタンのどちらにどの兵器を割り当てるか選択できるようになっている。

[艦隊]
自分で作った宇宙船またはインポートした宇宙船で艦隊を編成することができる。プレイヤーの宇宙船にファクトリーがあり艦隊編成の設定がされていれば、エネルギーを消費して艦隊に設定した宇宙船を同行させることができる。また、味方陣営の宇宙船をクレジットで雇ったり、売却してリリースすることもできる。
戦闘時にはプレイヤーの攻撃した敵を同行艦が集中攻撃し、プレイヤーが特に何もしなければ自動で各敵を攻撃する。この辺はRTSのような感じだ。

[ワームホール]
ワームホールでできることはマップ再生成と宇宙船データのアップロードだ。
アップロードされたデータは公式サイト( http://www.anisopteragames.com/sync/latest.html )から見ることができ、他のプレイヤーのマップに敵として登場する。

シンプルながらも個性的なデザインができる奥深さと、ストラテジー要素のある宇宙マップでの戦闘、そしてなんといっても他のプレイヤーの艦隊と戦えることが良い。
他のプレイヤ―の艦隊は、強さを追求したようなものや見た目重視なもの、大量にミサイルをばら撒いて動き回るものなど、それぞれに個性や設計思想が感じられることがあり面白い。宇宙マップでの探索と戦闘は、デザインした宇宙船の性能を確認できることや若干のストラテジー要素による面白さがある。メインである宇宙船のデザインの部分がしっかりと作られて、デザインした宇宙船をテストできる舞台が用意されていることが大きい。たまに細かいBugに遭遇することはあるが、それでもついついプレイしてしまう。

Bem foi ai que o jogo me pegou.

Prós:

-Jogo Viciante
-Varias Facções
-Muitos Mods
-Modo de criação de naves é fantástico

Contras:

-Gráfico nada chamativo( todos sabemos que não precisamos de gráficos para sermos felizes, mais isso conta)
-Primeiros momentos podem ser estressantes irritantes e confusos ( continue jogando que você vai adorar assim que entender)
-limite de poder da nave (já foi explicado o porque desse limite em alguns post's aqui na steam, porem acredito que todo que limite é ruim.)

Conclusão:

acredito que esse jogo é mais uma perola da Steam, mostra que não precisamos de gráficos super realistas para ter um jogo interessante e divertido, se você busca algo para te entreter e te dar aquele gostinho de ter achamo uma joia no meio de resíduos sólidos esse jogo é para você, caso você seja um aficionado por gráfico, ou não goste de jogos indies, acredito que você deva ficar longe desse jogo, caso contrario seja bem vindo e espero que minha frota te encontre.

Reassembly conforms to a style of a top-down spaceship shooter. Controlling your own manufactured ship, your ""goal"" (though indirectly implied) is to dominate every sector on the map by removing the inhabitants that subside in said sectors. Attempting to dominate every sector can be met with an implication of meeting that inevitable doom ship that you don't have a chance against.

//-[I][b]Factions[/b][/i]
There are 17 total factions in the game, but only 7, by default, are playable. Each faction is unique in their own ways, particularly design, weapon versatility, and how well they fend for themselves. Most notable feature they carry is what they specialize in, a faction might hold the title of being the most balanced faction, while others hold the title of owning the most powerful weapon arsenal, but at the cost of lower defenses. It all comes down to the preference of the player.

//-[i][b]Agents[/b][/i]
Agents hold a synonymous definition of player-made ships. They occur when a player travels through a wormhole, in which they have the decision to stay or leave to a newly birthed location. Upon leaving their current world, their fleet (along with their ship designs) are uploaded and randomly placed through other player's worlds. In the form of a large fleet, Agents are forces to be reckoned with as their design holds true to a lethal mind of a human player: ship design ingenuity. [spoiler]Okay, the last part is an exaggeration, but they typically have better designed ships than NPC's[/spoiler]

//-[i][b]Progression[/b][/i]
There's not really much to hold when on the topic of progression for this game. It's made simply through three easy mechanics.
1) Killing enemies to gain [b]resources[/b]
2) Return resources to a ship/station with a factory installed, so you can trade resources for [b]currency[/b].
3) Purchase ship parts to your liking.
It's simple, but obliterating ships for resources is fun anyway.

//-[i][b]Steam Workshop Support[/b][/i]
Unfortunately the game doesn't hold a tremendous amount of following to really accommodate for the Steam Workshop. The game can be modded to a certain extent by bringing in new factions, a modified world (either bigger or more content placed), graphical enhancers, etc.
Though initially excited for the idea of bringing in new factions built by players, it can only go so far. If you're playing with a custom faction, attempting to enter a wormhole will prompt you with an error message exclaiming that you don't have a fleet, or that your fleet couldn't be uploaded to the server because your custom faction isn't officially in the game. It is where I realized that I've met the limitations of the Steam Workshop Support and with a frown expression, I leave it to that (from the time of this review, the game has been presumably left alone and will no longer receive developer updates [Last update given was November 10, 2016]).

But hey, what's not to love about this game. It's like revisiting your old childhood memories when you played with your Legos. It's fun putting your ideas into reality (in the form of a videogame). Stepping on a Lego is just like meeting that gigantic enemy ship, add in a swarm of missiles, a few lasers, and a deathray. It's all fun in the end, right?

I uninstalled the razer synapse software (the only razer software) and the game started working.

While this may not be the best long term solution, I have changed my review back to a YES because:


The game is a blast. 

I die a lot, its actually challenging, I like that.

How you design your ship makes a difference, it is immersive.

这一款超冷门的太空射击小游戏 
本体目前(2017/7/8)只有118MB 但是游戏性顶级 画面做到这个程度已经非常棒了
如果无人深空能像这个小游戏一样 那就不会人喷

[h1]为何耐玩[/h1] 
玩家的平均游戏时间很多都在100 甚至200小时以上 
原因就是这款游戏你可以全权设计你的飞船 
各种种族飞船 在有限的条件下 用各种模块组合 
成千上万的设计（只限制于你的想象力） 每个种族模块还不一样...用来搜集资源 激活空间站 和 带着你设计的舰队向地图深处进发（如果无人深空是这样的 那游戏性早就爆表了）
并且你在单人游戏的时候 也会碰到其他玩家设计的飞船 甚至在太空中都不会遇到一样设计的飞船 因为各种模块的原因 最多是同种族

[h1]设计方面[/h1]
1.你可以 以小博大 用速度规避子弹 然后火力覆盖在大型敌人的动力上面 围剿           
2.你可以设计一艘头超硬的锤头舰以高动力 直接撞击敌舰 
3.你也可以设计超迷你的迷你舰 电脑会自动帮你控制 
你的舰队有5个格子 可以放入5艘飞船 主力舰 迷你舰 长射程 运输舰 等等各种你设计的飞船 
各司其职

[h1]友情提示[/h1]
1.正面动力与反面动力同样重要 不然你的飞船完全不好转向 控制性非常差 
给AI打爆部分推进器的时候 你的飞船甚至可能无限旋转.... 直到重建完毕 
躲避一段时间可以自动恢复（重建模块）

2.你可能看到视频里面很多弹幕 像小蜜蜂一样 有些是子弹 有些是自动自导的飞弹 有的甚至是AI的迷你舰队 所以你建飞船的时候一定要给防御机制的炮台留位置 否则群战的时候非常吃亏 

3.这个游戏的每个不同种族之间都是敌对的 有些地方完全是混战 浑水摸鱼 很有意思
4.激活空间站的地方是交火最密集的地方 运输舰要避开一些
5.设计飞船时的操作：鼠标双击模块 用来对称反转 如果你不懂我在说什么 等你用三角模块的时候就明白了
6.设计飞船时候 你可以看到中间有个红三角 那是飞船的重心位置 方便你判断推力的适合位置",1499244957,1499481928,True,4,0,0.564056932926177979,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I guess, in the end I probably will. At this moment I have played 33 hours of Reassembly. And I'm likely to play many more. 'Cause the game is lots of fun. 

If you're reading this you most likely know it's about building spaceships. Unlocking new parts by exploring and harvesting the universe. Upgrading your old ship or building a new one from scratch. Recruiting allies to join your fleet. Fighting huge battles against alien races. Ships will regenerate as long as their command module is not destroyed. There are many different factions to play (you'll have to unlock them though). The game runs smoothly (only one crash so far), the building is simple but with enough depth to be interesting. Plus: it's modable! Again, lots of fun.

However, at this point I'm getting increasingly frustrated. Every single game I started ended after a couple of hours (at the most) because of what I believe to be a flaw in the game's design. At one point in every single game my ship bumped into a floating piece of spacestation debris without me noticing immediately that the (piece of) spacestation was in the proces of regenerating. And within seconds my ship was ""overgrown"" with spacestation, unable to manouvre or shake and wiggle itself loose. At that point I usually (rage)quit the game just to start again the next day because the gameplay is still fun. But add to that a bug (?) that is semi-gamebreaking: After the first time it seems I cannot use wormholes anymore (these take you to new maps). All I get is an error notification. This could have something to do with the mods I'm currently using (didn't test that yet) but anyhow it's getting increasingly annoying.

So yeah, great game if you like designing and building spaceships to fight huge battles with. But I would advise to take a look at yourself first: do you think your frustration-tolerance is up to the standard required? If so, by all means, buy this game, 'cause in the end it's lots of fun.",1499175106,1499175106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-La terea predominante del juego es la construcción de naves y flotas, es donde vas a pasar las horas.
-Tu flota, y posiblemente un gran número de armas de tu nave, son controladas por la IA; tu las diseñas y las diriges por el mapa.
-Se van desbloqueando piezas y el tamaño máximo de tu nave.
-Se puede luchar contra la IA controlando naves que han creado otros jugadores.
-Puedes poner a luchar a tus propias flotas entre ellas (torneos).

Pros:
-Gran variedad para construir. Cada facción tiene sus componentes, sus estilos de pelea, y su estética propia.
-La construcción es un reto. Cada pieza tiene unos anclajes que tienen que encajar a la perfección para unirse. Al principio puede desesperar, pero enseguida encuentras patrones de construcción según la facción.
-Me ha parecido bien optimizado.

Contras:
-No existe el multijugador directo, solo luchas contra los diseños que han subido otras personas. Esta es, quizá, la gran pega que se le puede poner al juego.
-El desbloqueo de piezas y del tamaño de tu nave es demasiado rápido para mi gusto, aunque en cada partida con cada facción hay que desbloquearlo todo.
-La dificultad de la pelea es demasiado baja para mi gusto, enseguida puedes ir arrasando por el mapa. Debería poder aumentarse. En lategame solo queda jugar contra algún ""agente"" y testar tus flotas entre ellas.

***
Yo primero lo probé pirata, y con lo que me gustó, y con el aliciente de poder enfrentarme a diseños de otras personas y subir los míos, decidí comprarlo.
14 euros lo considero un precio muy justo. Si lo pilláis en rebajas como he hecho yo, no lo dudéis.

A highly stylized space game that's half ship design building and half arcade-style gunning, with no messy plot or other details to get in your way other than 'grow, kill, expand'. 

The best part, for me at least, is the ability to see your ship grow from a piddly fighter that needs to run and gun against all but the smallest of enemies to a capital ship bristling with weapons. You can also be the commander of a fleet which is...well, uh, not that good TBH. The AI is fair, but depending on your skill with ships the others will lag behind your inevitable beast of a main ship and have a tendency to get themselves caught in you or pieces of terrain. Still, it's not too damning and there's nothing like a full on war between your ships and two-three other factions to show why the game is amazing!

Other cons to note: the Spiky Plants and Bees with MESS YOUR FPS UP if you piss them off, so don't.

This has become my new addiction in gaming.

The concept of this game is simple: 

1. Build your spaceship using guns, armor, and various other parts depending on your play preference.
2. Pilot your spaceship in real time on a 2d plane against A.I. faction ships.
3. Kill other ships and collect what is essentially their XP orbs.
4. Turn in XP for money.
5. Increase your build capacity and unlock guns and blocks with your money.
6. Improve on your ship or make an entirely new one to add to your growing roster of ships for your current faction and watch the A.I. build your new creations to use against your enemies!

It is so satisfying to see your own ship builds being made and used by your own faction in just the ways you intended.

Make a farming ship to cultivate plants for resource orbs.
Create a ship designed with massive cargo holds solely to collect resource orbs to turn in for massive profits.
Create a ship with the ability to heal other ships using beams and drones.
Focus on shields and beams to burst your opponent down from close up.
Make high armored missle-clad monsters to take out your enemies from a distance.
Cover your ship in drone launchers and swarm your enemies with mosquitos!

You can do all of this and so much more, your imagination is really the limit.

The modding scene with this game is surprizingly great and the community is very welcoming and also surprizingly large.

Hopefully, this game gets much more attention.  It certainly flew under the radar for me but once I picked it up I was easily hooked without intending to be.

Collect resources, buy new parts, design your ship to it's full potential, take over new territory, unlock new factions, and the process repeats itself. 

But each time you play there are new challenges and new ways to play, offered by the seven diverse factions included in the game, and the thousands of workshop mods and contributions. The graphics are incredible and really bring the best out of a 2D game, offering vibrant and extensively customisable colour schemes. Arguably the game's best feature, however, is the stunning ship design platform that far out-plays any other vehicle design I've ever seen in a game, allowing you to place, rotate, and resize each individual block of each individual ship that you build. The way you build your ships determine how well they will do in the diversity of space, having to tough out aggressive forests of spiky plants, angered factions, explosive rocks and swarms of teleporting drones.

If you are particularly happy with a fleet you have created, you can pitch them up against your steam friends' fleets in heated Tournament mode, or even export them and send them to the workshop for anyone to try out. 

The soundtrack is also very nice, fitting nicely in the background of the game. Whether you are battling a fleet of crystalline ships or spending time tweaking your mothership's design, the music creates a simple yet entertaining space themed aesthetic to suit the game perfectly. (plus you can buy it separatley as DLC; if it's DLC worthy then it's gotta be good m79)

Despite the single-player gem of a game this is, many people including me have been asking for a multiplayer mode for a L O N G  time, so if you are thinking that this is a space-themed MMO, you've come to the wrong place. There also haven't been many major updates of the game for a while, so I think the devs are happy with the game for now; don't expect any major new content being released. 

If you want to see some gameplay, I recomend a youtuber called Deluks Gaming, he does very good Let's Plays that teach you the basics of the game (plus many tournament videos) and can give you a feel for it and whether it's a good game for you or not.

The game I think does take a while to get hold of, despite that you can never lose and there are infinite save files for you, and I think it attracts a particular audience, which is why it isn't a lot more popular than it currently is. Hopefully this has been helpful, I really can't stress how good the game is; take advantage of the sales and get it while it's cheaper ;)

It's really cool because you start out with these little ships that you can keep upgrading and building up. As you fly around the galaxy blowing shit up you can use the raw materials you collect to upgrade your ship.

Eventually you can get a factory on your ship and you can use raw materials to build more ships until you have a massive armada that will rain terror (or in my case, missiles) down on all who oppose you!

Then there are wormholes so you can go to other galaxies and do the same thing.

Then, after playing it like 8 solid hours I discovered that there are other factions to unlock which have totally different modules and weapons for the ships!

Sure, you don't get to go around discovering planets amd whatnot, but it sure is fun building a fleet with the factory on your ship and taking over the other factions' nodes in the galaxy. Another thing that is great is the ability to build and customize your own ships.

This game is great if you enjoy topdown shooters and its a nice little gem that can keep you entertained for a few hours.

That being said: optomization...this game needs it. With how the game goes, it's not hard to create a massive fleet and find yourself in a huge space-battle where everything begins to lag out and freeze up. Once most of the ships have been dealt with it begins to smooth out, but I would love to see a space-battle between two huge fleets where everything runs smooth.

I should clarify, that I just figured I would try this game out last night, since it's been sitting in my library for ahwile. It was almost everything that I hoped it would be:



The Pro's


Awesome space battles, intuitive, fun, chaotic and beatifully designed

Easy ship editor, that is only mildly frustrating to use at times

Interesting factions, and well thought out gameplay

Massive universe: really captures the space adventure feel

Cool faction system



Con's

No goals or mission objectives. For some this is not a con, and I can appreciate this style of pure sandbox gameplay where the goal is to get a bigger ship to destroy bigger enemies, so you can get a bigger ship. However, I usually like my games to have some sort of goal to work towards, otherwise after awhile I lose interest.

There are Bosses, but I haven't had a ""fight for my life"" or a ""holy Sh** that ship is huge! retreat"" moment

Ship builder could use some refinement, nothing major, but it can be frustrating

While the world is vast, the terrain isn't very varried. 



I started playing around 8:00PM yesterday and binged straight through the night. I went to bed for a few hours around 6am, then woke up and went straight back to it. It felt really great to have that ""addicted"" feeling in a game, I haven't experienced that in ahwile. That being said, In that 9-13 hours, I feel like I have experienced most of what the game has to offer. There are other factions to explore and unlock (I think I unlocked 4 or 5 during time played so far) but after ahwile without a purpose and when you've built your big bad mothership, you start to wonder what to do next. 

Some people were complaining about the grindy nature of the game, and actually I felt that was done quite well. I felt the grind relaxing, and I was always eager to find new enemies, get more resources, and upgrade my ship. I would love to see some DLC that add's proper bosses, Missions, new terrains, new factions, some sort of primitive economy, trading, selling, bounty hunting, different way's to mine, some sort of story line, or anything that adds more of a reason for me to actually *want* a bigger ship. As it stands it is fun to create a bigger fleet just for the fun of it, but the pressure of a more well defined enemy, or additional base mechanics could add a whole new level to gameplay. I really think this game had the potential to be the next terraria, in that the gameplay is a blast, and it's also a unique experience. It's old so I am not hoping for updates, but would gladly pay for some DLC or a sequel.


I think 15 dollars is a bit pricey, considering that after this binge I will likely not pick the game up again, but I just paid 13.75 to go to the movies the other day for 1.5 hours of so/sso entertainment. 15.00 for 9-13 hours of solid entertainment is a good value in my book. 

If the dev's are out there, for the love of god make a sequel. Consider adding some sort of endgame, and you'd have a real winner.",1492218659,1492218659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

What is there is pretty good but also gets dull rather rapidly. I particulary like the graphical style with the intense colors and the kind of 80s computer games like presentation. The designs of the enemy ships are also very cool. From space-bees to space-plants, the factions both playable and unplayable have unique and cool designs. The game shines when you stumble into big conflicts between multiple factions. Its all pretty blood-dragon-hotline-miami-esque if that makes sense :D Or if you are as ancient as me it might remind you of standing in an actual arcade. Only presentationwise though. The scale of the universe and amount of stuff going on on screen is pretty huge.

The ship building is very enjoyable and a lot deeper than I initialy thought. From gunships to carriers to ""ramming-devices"", there are a lot of feasable designs you can go with. Different factions will also have different equipment.

My two problems with the game are that, for one, while you can test your ship against other ships directly from the build menue, the battle is automated for some reason. This just seems odd. Also the game picks random ships that have a comparable cost to yours. Since I'm not into multiplayer I would preferre it if you could just fight one on one battles agains the AI with a ship of your choosing (Like fight your old ship with your new ship)
While the former is more a nice to have, the end game is where the real problem is. You ""can"" conquer the universe in this which at first glance seems to be the endgoal of the game. The idea being that you can create stations that in turn can create more ships. In practice this means that you just dump out at least one station in every sector and then move on. There is not really any strategy involved in it. Nor is it interesting. Personally I just discovered the universe and then got bored. It would have been cool if the ""empire building"" was a lot more fleshed out than it actually is. It seems to be just tagged on and is ultimately boring. Maybe if you're a 100% completion guy that still appeals to you, for me personally the game ended after I discovered everything once. It has been a while since I played but I believe the game is already complete. While it has mod support, I don't imagin core game mechanics are something that is exposed and changeable by mods. It is therefor likely that the basebuilding aspect of the game can be considered final. This is a real shame. In my opinion the game could be interessting for manytimes as long if that would have been done a little better.
At any rate for the price you can expect 20-30 Hours of cool exploration and unlocking higher and higher ship classes. Then it ends anticlimacticly when you discover that you could conquer the universe now but it would also be pretty dull.
Still if the game seems at all interessting to you from the trailers you should get it. Its uniquely pretty and pretty unique.",1490480303,1490480303,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

It's simple to learn (although the controls are not intuitive at first, give it time), and it can be as mindless or as strategic as you want to make it. The building aspect is a simple point and click system with the ability to copy large portions, mirror them, and place on the opposite side of your ship. Space battles are just good oldfashioned blow-crap-up fun. Getting destroyed by a difficult faction or fleet just gives you motivation to improve your ship building skills and battle strategies. And the music... Absolutely immersive, and is a decent jam while blowing ships into smitherines. I highly recommend the DLC soundtrack. i cant imagine playing the game without it now that I look back. The only negative I can see to this game is the fact that it does tend to go into a lag fest when you enter a bee infested or thorn infested territory. In those situations, the lag is manageable (it feels a bit like slow mo, so get ready to fight those battles reaaally slow). Otherwise, avoid those territories and that problem never occurs.

When I'm not sure what to do, I launch Reassembly and play for a perfectly undetermined amount of time.

Reassembly is the perfect relaxation game. The music is both calm and upbeat, making the transitions between travelling, gathering and fighting almost seemless. Vector graphics also help to the surreal feel, and they allow the game to run very smoothly on most computers (as long as you keep away from the damn spiky plants, spamming projectiles until your computer fries). Fighting is also a spam-festival, but somehow keeps your game running good (and there is never FPS drop: only a physical simulation slowdown), and it is just exciting enough to be fun without making you hyper-active like playing Quake on accelerated speed after injection of pure Montain Dew essence. Death happens a lot, but isn't too punishing most of the time, and you usually tell yourself ""oh, well"" and keep going. Building is complex enough to make you activate a few brain cells without frying them, and permissive enough to allow for some beautifully shaped motherships,or if you are like me, spamming of pulse lasers to make an one-shot cube. Speaking of absurd powerful weapons, The tech system (a.k.a factions, unlocking weapons and upgrading your ship) is diverse and smooth enough to keep you going for quite some time. 

My personnal recommandation is to spam the same mid or end-tier weapon to make your gunships, except for the tinkrel (purple guys) able to make their own weapons: here just make a fat-ass death-pouring valve, it's hilarious. And of course never forget the anti-missile cannons.

My personnal favourite faction is the Red, because the lack of shields (hardest faction, by the way) forces you in making a swarm of well-designed ships, usually quite cheap and fast to produce. Unless you try to attack a ridiculous player-made gunship, few fleets can compete with a 100 ships army.

The only complain I have is the lack of true multiplayer: you can see other player-made fleets in your world (agents), but that's it.

The moment your given control of your ship in this game a terse tutorial quickly shows you the controls and basic mechanics. Then it tells you to kill everyone who is colored differently from you, that's racism. Or is it spacism? Since it's in outer space... I think... for all I know it feels like your a bunch of bacteria fighting for control of someone's stomach. Either way, Reassembly delivers an enjoyably modular destruction sim where you are the only person in your entire race who has something very special, initiative.


TL;DR
+++ Mods
+++ Shooting pieces off of ships
++ Ship Building (Way better than any other I've seen out there IMO)
++ Pretty visuals
+ GENOCIDE!!! (pretending your Alexander the Great!)
- Genocide (knowing your actually like Hitler)
- AI isn't great (especially if you have followers)
- Vanilla game has a total point-cap of 8000 (there is mods that ""fix"" this)
-- Taking territory can become grindy
--- Lack of reward for taking territory


GAMEPLAY

The game plays like a twin-stick shooter in that the default controls have you aim and shoot with the mouse and control your thrusters with WASD. The controls have several different configurations and can be rebinded if desired. I've found the default controls to be sufficient.

The game starts you off by choosing one of the several factions (more if you have mods) and plops you in some friendly territory equipped with the outer-space (or inner-gastric, I don't know) equivalent of a dingy. You then must use your meager might to collect purple floaty-things called ""resources"" (creative huh?) to trade in at friendly factories for ""credits"" (again, the innovation!). The resources usually grow near plants attached to asteroids/food-globs found throughout the galaxy/stomach. You can also get resources by killing black/white/red/yellow/etc colored ships. You will then use the credits you get from trading (aka, going near any friendly factory) to purchase new parts and a higher point-cap (lets you add more pieces) for your ship.

About half of your time spent in Reassembly will be in the ship designer. It's quite easy to use once you get the hang of it. Everything you would expect to need for a ship is present here (as long as you've unlocked the right parts). You build around your core (the part that you should be protecting) with pieces ranging from armor, to point-defence, to generators, to drone-launchers. What is it with games nowadays and drones? Well, just like real life drones these ones break really easily. Unlike real life drones you can keep spamming them out and overwhelm your enemies.

One of the problems with the game is that the ship builder only lets you upgrade you point-cap to 8000. This prevents you from building those giant ships shaped like various things. However, don't fret, there are more than a couple mods that rectify this horrendous hindrance to holocaustic, wholesale, hellenistic, Hitlerism.

Another thing this game gets wrong is that it presents you with a daunting task of occupying every sector of the galaxy/gut with your color. This requires exterminating every single thing that isn't your color. Some would say this exceeds Mount and Blade: Warband levels of grindy conquering. Plus there are wormholes ({sarcastically} wormholes, riiiiggghhhht) scattered through the galaxy/gastric that urge you to go to a different world entirely (or upload the designs you've built).

Despite these flaws, the game excels in letting you shoot everything and watch it break. It is immensely satisfying to watch an enemy capitalship get it's primary weapons turned offline as you separate them from the main body with a giant cutting laser, or any other of the MANY weapons to be found both in the vanilla game and mods.


Story

Once upon a time...
life evolved/someone swallowed
into many races/some bacteria
that fought for control
of the galaxy/of the abdomen
I'm just kidding, there is no story past what you imagine.


Graphics

The graphics in this game are highly modifiable and can be absolutely beautifully (I'm talking like, epileptic levels of lights, shaders, blooms, etc.) or look like a flash game for those of you using potatoes. But hey, that's still fun. I myself played at potato level for several months after a hard drive failure {shudder}.


Conclusion

All in all, this game is definitely worth your time. I bought it at full price, but you could wait for a sale (not that I've ever seen one for this). Even if you just have 15 minutes, Reassembly can satisfy that modular ship shooting itch with it's varied factions, massive possibilities and amazing ship builder.

游戏模式是一种类似于征服的模式 玩家会在地图的一角出生 收集资源升级 与AI势力对抗 占领全图或者是穿越虫洞开新图
游戏可玩种族有8种(不算创意工坊) 除人类外其余7种需要击杀对应种族超过1000P的飞船才能解锁 除此之外还有好几种AI专属种族
每种种族都有自己的特点 甚至科技树都完全不一样(游牧者竟然还能在飞船上种草卧槽)
总而言之 游戏性真的很强 不过也需要一定的设计基础 否则你就是给AI送资源的

另外不得不提的是游戏有""入侵""系统
每张地图上都会随机挑选十支左右由其他玩家捏的舰队生成在在地图上
实力完全和AI不是一个级别！ 而且随着你的占领区的推进会主动上门找茬！！
而且如果这支舰队是有装建造模块的话 还会建立空间站 和你抢领土！

Nah. After 63 hours, sure, I've gotten my money's worth, but sadly all spent in each race, and sadly, I no longer am even vaguely interested in it.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, it's just... not one I can say is a great one. Whether this be due to the Dev's apparent abandonment of this game, I can say this for sure.

If you wanna play for 20 hours in an interesting title, then pickit up, but if you want something to play for a LONG time, longer than 63 hours, then don't pick this up.

I Still play Quake 1, 2, Doom's every pre-3 version, Creeper Worlds 1-3, Master of Orion 2, and Diablo 1 and 2.

Those games are older than this by anywhere between 1 year and 2 decades.

You can buy all of them too.

If you want modular ships, then go for it, otherwise... Ehhh. It's fun, but it has limitations, such as the whole universe and world not being constantly active, leading you to go to every place to clear it out yourself, rather than do it Sim Ant style, and build a fleet so powerful, that your allies jsut take everything over through sheer attrition.
Other limitations include:
- A VERY limited Tournament system, only allowing one fleet to engage another person's single fleet. Not one fleet from one save, or faction. One fleet PERIOD. Also you can't manually control ships either in PvP combat, so that's extremely lame.
- No Co-op, which this game could badly use on the ""Conquer everything"" achievement, which requires you to have a ship in every quadrant, which.... good luck, there's over 2000 of the things and hte map only updates in proximity of another player, let alone triggers and moves normally. Going fast enough can make it painfully obvious, which is possible to do without any mods btw.
- The 8000 Ship size limit is fine, but when you're grinding up to that point (which IS a grind with some factions, with others, it's just plain tedious in every way) the imagination tends to run wild with about a dozen or more ideas that aren't possible without using mods.
- Agents (user-submitted fleets controlled by AI only) sometimes don't spawn correctly and you gotta regen your world to get them to spawn correctly. This doesn't stop Agents from killing stations though, since, if Agents fought any of MY stations, none of them would survive, especially with my terran faction that abuses missiles (Hint: Lasers eventually do nothing)
- Some weapons are just straight-up overpowered if spammed, whilst other weapons are jsut pretty much useless. Case and Point: Photon Lances, Missiles and Drones are 3 overpowered-when-spammed weapons. Everything literally pales in comparison. Missiles can overpowerd and overwhelm literally everything.
- Railguns are useless for the most part, which is sad because Railguns are 50 times more powerful than any lasers, missiles (save for nukes) or fighter/bomber in any amounts irl. Hint: Because Railguns are literally matter shot at the speed of light, or atleast faster than the speed of sound, which is still deadly on that level.
- AI doesn't redesign ships to counter your powerful warships, as a result, you can eventually design ships that nothing has an answer for, at which point the game's no longer challenging, which wears out the fun pretty quickly after a point. Case and Point: Terran Ships literally made up of a couple of shield generators, and literally a hundred missile launchers.
- You can't stop the game from Auto-pausing without pausing, then unpausing as you immediately tab out. Reason why you'd want to do this: You may have a ship that revolves around puking out space stations for the purpose of just flooding the universe with stations that can also slowly puke out ships on it's own.

一开始，你只是个人族的小型战舰，随着资源的积累，自己的战舰慢慢扩大升级并能击溃其他种族时就开始更有意思起来。

有的种族注重火力，有的注重装甲，有的注重近战攻击（没错，有近战攻击！不过是拿自己的部分撞击来造成伤害）
资源的收集也有许多方式；你可以当一名“矿工”，也可以当一名战士去击毁敌人来掠夺资源，同时你还可以激活失效的空间站，甚至虫洞来获取资源（2单位的资源在空间站旁边可以获取1单位的金钱）
（当你到达虫洞会有两个选项；1.是留下来2.是去穿越 选择留下来会给予1000金钱的奖励 不过值得一提的是：mod里的船只不能选择留下 一个世界只有几个虫洞，全部选择留下来可能会导致没法开新地图，我的10000P的大船的存档就因为没有虫洞穿越而变得无聊了）

It then uses a physics engine to move it about, so you need to balance the vessel well and provide enough sufficiently powered trusters in all directions to be able to move and turn.

Weapon firing can be set to autotarget, so in effect you just move slowly around while your cannons destroy anything nearby so you can pick up loot that is needed for upgrades and unlocking new building blocks. Enemies will fire back and destroy your ship block by block, but after a while the blocks auto-generate.

You can also build AI controlled ships, based on your own designs. Those ships can in turn build other ships, so you can dominate the galaxy quite soon. Then it is time to enter a black hole for a fresh universe, where you can start over from your current technology level.
 
A challenge with this game is that controlling your ship is cumbersome. Even if you design it well, it will still handle sluggish, and I found myself getting stuck in space debris a lot. So, if you approach the game as an action game, it will be very irritating. Approach it more like a strategy game, and it makes more sense though.

Another issue with the game, is it has quite limited scope. Once you unlock all upgrades, there is simply not much to do. You will have no use for the money you collect, and you just aimlessly float around to repeat what you did before over and over. Would be nice with some variation, and perhaps some quests. This makes the game a rather short experience.

I'll briefly outline the pros and cons of this game:
Pros: 
.virtually endless universes
.you can fight against other people's creations
.endless possibilities for ship creation: any shape, size, weaponry and thrusters can be put almost anywhere
.it has a great soundtrack but some people may find it repetitive 
.multiple factions (groups of ships) with different weapons, ways of playing and fighting and different abilities
.it is extremely satisfying when you know that you've destroyed another player's fleet with your own creation that you built from scratch
.you can control fleets, wreak havoc on all the other ships and easily take over a whole universe if you put the time and effort in
.easy, addictive and enjoyable once you get the hang of the controls and the build section
.if you can't be bothered building a ship, you can import one and then add to it (on the build menu, go to import>Steam(wherever your steam folder is, go to that place first, mine is on my desktop so i would go import>desktop>steam)>steamapps>common>reassembly>extra_ships or ships depending of faction and then choose a ship)
Cons:
.it's $15
.difficult to get the hang of
.no real storyline but some people will like that
.it is time consuming to build a really good ship from scratch
.you will die quite a lot even if you are extremely careful

Overall i would say that it is a game worth getting if you are into exploring, sandbox, creating stuff, blowing other stuff up or destroying it, collecting, upgrading and controlling a fleet of 81 ships at once. Although it takes a bit to get used to (for me it was 30 mins), it is very enjoyable and worth getting when on sale.

Once you get the hang of it (and unlocked the pieces you need), building a ship may take time but is a breeze. You can Copy/Paste (old Ctrl-X-C-V) an entire ship, a bunch of pieces or put pieces one at a time... For example, to make a circular ship (think Borg Sphere), I made 1/4 of the ship, then Copy/Paste and snap the 3 other parts together to make the sphere shell of the ship. Next step was to put weapons, shields Generators and such, then try your new creation in space...
Of course, how you can build and what you can put depend on the faction you selected. Some factions has no square hull or no shield module, for example...


Once in the battlefield, you'll notice that all ships are definitely not created equals and you need to adapt your 'piloting' accordingly: 
- Like most game of this type, you have to keep a balance (or not) between Firepower, Armor, Speed and Mass of the ship...
- Your pilot square is not only the thing that keep your ship together and mean death if it is destroyed, but also affect the center of gravity of your ship... That means that for a ship of the same shape, you will drive it differently if you put the pilot capsule at the front, center or rear of the ship... Negligeable if you build a small fighter, but more obvious if you build a 'Star Destroyer' kind of ship... And putting it too close to the extremity means the enemy need to punch less shield/armor to hit it... Life if full of compromises...
- And perhaps what surprise me (in a good way) the most is the feeling that you're not alone. Your part of a faction against other factions. Of course, you have a major infuence on your faction progress (you unlock new parts with your hard earned Credits, your faction will spawn and use ship you created, etc...) but when you pass next to an space port, you may see a new ship spawning and going for enemies and/or ressources alone (piloted by the AI, of course...).
- You can fly solo or order others ships of your faction to follow you, giving you the feeling of commanding a small armada. Of course, AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed, but it is competent enough to follow you and attack your target, giving you an numerical advantage against powerful enemies... Just don't expect they'll use asteroids for cover or retreat in time when in trouble. 


Add to that mods from Steam Workshop, and you have plenty to see and do...

Now to my serious review.
I played over 31.2 hours and I have discovered lots of cool things about it, like uploading your fleet so it will become a agent and attack other Player's worlds when they either start a new world or go to another. Another cool thing I witnessed is that the Ship Costumization is so simple and you can costumize it 100%, Block Limits is the part I don't like about ship costumization, you cannot create extremely huge ships because of this. Another one is that your enemies will continue to grow, everytime you remove parts or add in new parts to your ship, your enemies will know this and evolve there ships to something stronger, even that one Red Faction you thought was extremely weak but later they evolved and can pack a punch to any other faction. The one thing I really hate about Reassembly is your allies. You're allies won't do anything. They just waste there time, sitting around in there bases, patrolling it and not attacking or exploring other sectors of the map, which I strongely hate. Not only that, the enemy AI also seems to suffer this as well, with this, you feel like you're the only one in the whole map exploring while others are just sitting and spending there rest of there time in there bases, flying aimlessly and then wait until getting recruited. Now that I finished gathering up all the things I know and loved and possbily strongely hate about, I made a list.
Pros
Ship Costumization: Extremely good, giving you 99% freedom creating your own ships, but where brick limits come in, stopping you from creating a massive ship or even a gigantic station. 
The AI: The AI can be smart but extremely stupid at times. The only thing the AI actually knows about is attacking there enemies, gathering resources and heading back to there bases for ressupply in order to create more ships, and the new ships go on and on with gathering resources, bringing it back and create new ships, this is a endless cycle. I was hoping for them to attack your sectors or attack other sectors and spawn stations there, at most of the time in my opinion, I think there very dumb.
Graphics: The Graphics are nice, when you shoot, the laser particles, missiles and drone particles show very well, even the particales thrusters make, are extremely nice, though there are a few mods on the Workshop to make it better, but at vanilla-balanced they look a little nice, looks epic when a couple of ships fight each other but that's rarely the case because the AI.
The Map: The map is extremely huge, big enough for you to explore, may take up to five months to explore the whole map. The map has a bunch of living inhabitants, including your allies. The Map also haves asteriods, plants, spikey plants and other special factions that might find and destroy you. I'd say the map is epic and suitable for a exploration game.
Updates: This game rarely gets updated, and may never get updated again by the developers. Updates are extremely rare for this game, and you may or may not have seen ""Reassembly updating"" or anything like that. Don't buy this game if you don't like very inactive Developers or like this game in it's current state.
From what I know for the ending of this review, I'd say I recommend this. To those who like the game in it's current state with extremely inactive developers.",1483894335,1483894335,True,0,0,0.463320463895797729,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Тут можно строить корабли так, как тебе хочется. Применяй фантазию.
Каждая фракция сбалансирована под разные стили игры, но если очень постараться, то можно сделать такую херню,
что никто ничего не поймет.
Некоторые фракции конечно сильнее или слабее других, но все же у них свои приемущества или недостатки.
Фракция фермеров довольно слабая, но они могут выращивать растения и получать ресурсы из них.
Стражи нереально сильны, но у них малое разнообразие вооружения, и за них не интересно играть.

А еще моды. ДАААА. Я так рад что разработчики добавили workshop. не надо искать моды самому в интернете.
Люди делают свои собственные фракции, сами их балансируют, делают к ним корабли. Ты их качаешь и играешь за них.

В игре есть чревоточины, с помощью которых можно пересоздать мир или выгрузить свой флот на сервер.
Так же в твоем мире будут летать флоты других людей, управляемые ИИ. Убивая их ты получаешь поинты.

В игре так же можно устраивать турниры между твоими кораблями или кораблями друзей.

В целом, игра приятна глазу (на максималках по крайней мере), геймплей удобен, конструктор интуитивно понятен.

Игра стоит своих денег денег.

自分で設計した船で艦隊を作って宇宙を蹂躙していたら、
あっという間に30時間プレイしていました。

集めたリソースを基地でお金に換え、自分の強化代を支払っている間は、
パーツ使用上限が解放され、新しい武器を手に入れる度に
新しい船を組むのが楽しくて熱中しました。
私は、設計画面で選択できるテスト戦闘で、ＡＩの操作する自分が設計したばかりの船と、
「同じ程度の強さ」の敵勢力の船が戦っているのを眺めて、
その結果を元に更に改良を施す試行錯誤の過程が一番楽しかったです。

また、艦隊戦は、パーツごとに当たり判定があるため、
正面の装甲が速射砲によってガリガリ削られたり、
一瞬尻を見せたところにミサイルが炸裂し、後部の推進装置が爆散し機動力が奪われたり、
中央のコア目掛けて照射され続けたレーザー兵器によって、船体が縦に両断されたり、
といった様は、シンプルなデザインなのに妙な生々しさがあり見応えがありました。

ただ、全てのパーツを開放し、一隻一隻自分でデザインを考えた""最強艦隊""を編成しても、
それ以上やりがいのある目標が見出せなかったのは残念です。
一番の問題は、このゲームの「陣取り合戦」的要素があまりにも弱いことです。
デフォルトの敵勢力の船は弱すぎて倒しがいがなく。
周囲を敵勢力に染められた自分の基地を""救出""することや、
敵勢力に攻め込むことで得られるメリットがあまりにもないため、
地図に自分の基地が一つしかなくても、地図の半分を自分の勢力で染めても殆どプレイに変化がありません。

陣取り合戦の要素とは別で、宇宙を徘徊するＡＩが操る他のプレイヤーが作成した艦隊と戦うのは、
歯ごたえがあり楽しいですが、上限まで強化した後では、倒した先に何もないためすぐに飽きてしまいました。

以上の理由から、今は飽きを感じていますが、
気付いたら30時間プレイするほど、船の設計と自分の強化に熱中した事実は変わりありませんし、
他にも使用できる船のパーツが全く異なる種族が何種類も「ニューゲーム」を待っていることを考えれば、
また日を置いて、別の種族で一からスタートしたいと思います。

「艦隊を組んで戦う」という要素はかなり弱いと言わざるを得ませんが、

If there were a multi-player arena where players could go against other players in a duel or FFA, then it would be perfect.

First of all, it captures the the ship-building and physics of Astro Battle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Battle), but... better.  More parts, more customization, and factions with different techs that support different playstyles.  It's more forgiving to newbs too - each individual thruster doesn't need to be keyed for steering - the computer takes care of that.  But Astro Battle was only PVP, and you couldn't play it when nobody else was online.

But it also captures the mayhem of a giant 2D dogfight the way Hellfighter did (http://www.dracova.com/hellfighter/).  Both Astro Battle & Hellfighter were fun, but neither lived up to its potential.  I think they're both abandoned now, but I still have the memories.  This gives you an AI to fight with lots of ships, but lets you customize yours and potentially every one in your fleet.  Best of both worlds.

And you can artistically design your ships, colors, space stations to shape the world.  In that regard, it reminds me a lot of Spore from EA games, only this is is combat-oriented.  Spore was incredibly fun in the early stages, but lost out when you got to the galaxy stage - the single fleet that capped out at half  a dozen was the only thing making the economy go, and the galaxy quickly became too big for your little fleet.  In Reassembly, every ship has an independent captain and the ""economy"" works for each individual.  You don't need to babysit your empire, so it's not tedious - and there's no cap to the fleet you can have, so battles are FUN.

And there is a decent AI to play against.  Not as good as PvP in some ways, but better in other ways.  The AI lets you test your own designs against - your own designs, for example.  And you can fight the AI-controlled blueprints that were designed from other players.  It's almost as good as facing off with other players.  There is a tournament mode that lets you upload different ships/fleets and then watch the magic.

And finally, there is a neat little environment where space vegetation and debris from other ships can be collected as resources to build other ships from factories, and you can get a fleet that can maintain itself and increase it's numbers based on strategic settlements and/or battle victories.

The different factions make for diverse opponents, and once you defeat a battleship from another faction, they become playable if you want to play as another race.  And the biggest challenges are fleets from successful players - or the AI playing with custom ships designed by players, anyway.

Everything about the interface is user-friendly, but not cumbersome.  The designers did it right - including lots of shortcuts in the ship designer to make building big things easier.  You can tell they are perfectionists.  But they also made it mod-friendly in case you have a different version of perfection.  I can't say enough good things about it.",1483158882,1483216988,True,2,0,0.541243970394134521,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Depending on how you choose to play, it can be a bullet hell shooter, a top-down sandbox survival, or  a space fairing cross between Terraria and an RTS. The mercifully laissez faire ship customization means that it only takes a matter of hours to get to a point where you can build your ideal spacecraft, shred a section of the star system, jump through a worm hole, and scrap your initial design to take on new, more powerful enemies.

The ship building is really addicting. It's awesome how you have to balance your thrusters, weapons, modules and how it looks. It seems incredibly balanced. Except for the fact that the guns are ridicolously strong. But since this game supports workshop, and I see other players having around the 100-1000 hours played area, I'm sure you can probably fix most stuff you don't like with a mod. I would probably pay the full price it's asking for this game (I paid 50%).

20 Hours played: Well, the ship building is still as addicting as when I first started playing this game. It's so cool to kinda understand ship design stuff when designing your own ships. For instance, you realise your front is very vulnerable and you add more armor to the front of the ship. But since you want to keep the total mass down, and you realise you don't need all that armor in the back of the ship, you get an old school design where the back is your weakness. And all the games where you have to take something down and the game tells you to shoot it's back for more damage suddenly makes sense.
   Another example is maneuverability vs armor vs damage. You want your ship to have massive amounts of armor, and you want a ton of guns on your ship. But you dont have any space for thrusters. So your ship can't move. You take away some guns and make room for thrusters, but you have too few and too small thrusters to move your big ship. You take away even more guns to an ""acceptable"" point, and you put in more thrusters, but your ship still moves super  sluggish. You redesign the whole ship and make sure you worry about how it moves at all times. But the bigger your ship becomes, the harder it is to find enough spots to fit your thrusters. Makes you understand why big ships are always portrayed as super slow moving. Amazingly fun tinkering in any case!",1482854554,1483012501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[ Long, old review ]
Reassembly is a lovely game.

It's pleasing simplicity makes it easy to play with. It's not oppressively realistic like some other space titles, and is focused on giving you a fun spaceship architect fantasy.

Modding also allows you to craft and tailor the difficulty of the game to your liking and alter the game's default palettes to include entirely different blocks and systems.

The world, in and of itself is thoroughly beautiful, and immersive in just how simple and clean it is to look at.
The plants live, breathe, and spread on their own.
The ships and factions have their territory, and fight to defend themselves. 
But are not psychopathically aggressive, and display a degree of awareness.
They are individual battleship captains on a quest to expand their empire.

And you.
Are the mad person with a little ship and big hopes, who is gonna stop them.
With seven total playable factions, ( and many more from mods )
Each with their own palette, and weapon systems.
Reassembly offers a serious value proposition in terms of time, replay ability, and sheer relaxation.

Mould your faction into what you want it to be.
Conquer the galaxy.

Then, do it all over again with a fresh set of ships.
Or, live semi-peacefully with the farmers. Building a vast ecosystem of your ships.",1482673503,1669138521,True,21,0,0.707739889621734619,0,True,False,False,False,,,

instead, you now want your ship to survive.
This can be done with 1 of 7 factions
1 Terran : Starter faction, very balanced but with powerful shielding and good armor
2 Farmer : A pretty weak faction but it has plants making it able to just swarm you, or you raid them for it.
3 Red : The Hardmode, you want a challenge, then this faction is for you. It's armor is VERY weak but also gets repaired VERY quickly.
4 Tinkrell : 1 of the better factions, these got frontal modular cannons. Want a fast shooting, high damage, high velocity armageddon weapon which eats your entire energy reserve in a second? Yup, this one has it.
5 Crystalline : A very basic faction having weapons which grow, very big armor and some missiles for the mix. I like them, a lot.
6 Bees : Yes, bees. You got bees, be happy now as these bees are gonna sting you to death with Quadro Doombeams doing the most damage in close range you can dream of, and they got cities, and they are very explosive.
7 Sentinel : My favourite faction personally, they got very good ramming armour, they got some good weapons like the Annihilator, well their only weapon really with the frontal charge beam, but, here's the good part : Nukes, yes glorious nukes. AoE Emperors of damage, trouble with that big ship or that clustered fleet? Do a nuke and BAM they're just gone.

Now there's an 8000P limit, fine by me. But you can also go 1 step further and download a no P limit mod, which enables you to build 100.000p titants if you also have the no credits for more p mod.

If you get this game, I would highly recommend these Youtubers as they got some glorious playthroughs of each faction :

Reassembly is probably one of the most unique games I've played. Essentially, it's a top-down RTS-ish shooter game, where you get to build your ship from the ground up. This means unlimited possibilities in your playstyle, but each individual part you build can be destroyed. This means that when building you have to take into consideration the armor and placement of features on your ship. 

There is also a massive faction system in the game, and your whole goal is to make sure that yours prospers. This might seem tricky, but you can build and hire allies to help you out in securing more sectors of the universe. Eventually, your goal is to either take over the entire universe, or go through one of the wormholes at the center, travelling you to another universe. You can also upload your fleet that you assemble for other players to battle. The fleet you upload will appear as an ""Agent"" fleet in someone else's universe. Agents are player uploaded fleets, and there are 8 per universe, so it isn't as easy to take over the universe as it first appears.

One of the most interesting and subtle features is that you are [i]evolving[/i] the faction that you choose. All of the ships/stations/etc. that you create can be rebuilt by all of your allies. This doesn't seem like a very big deal, but later in the game it is. After a while of playing in the same universe, I noticed that I, singlehandedly, evolved my allegience of farmers into the most powerful fighting force in the universe. This means that you can alter the playstyle of your faction into something completely different then how they started.

Something else to note is that this game is incredibly modder friendly. I had never [i] actually [/i] modded a game before I bought Reassembly. All I knew how to do was install mods that I downloaded online. However, I found that Reassembly's files were incredibly easy to navigate, and I could tell exactly what I was looking for when I saw it. All I had to do was open some files in Notepad or Notepad++, and just look around for the things I wanted changed. Again, the files are really self-explanitory.

I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes top-down shooters and building games. I give it a 9/10

Some minor frustrations for me;

- you can make fleets yes, thats awsome, but they dangle behind you 99% of the time, and i keep loosing ships if i move to fast (seems like a los thing?), i gave up on the whole fleet thing cause they offer little to no help, and you keep losing ships without fighting.

在这款游戏中，你身在一个由简单几何图形构成的宇宙里，你会选择一个种族，驾驶着一艘飞船，在这平面宇宙中自由的行进
其中，你的飞船，和你见到的其他飞船，都是使用一块块零件搭建制作出来的，这些零件有船体积木，武器，辅助零件，护盾等等，而不同的种族，除了它们的外观颜色会不同之外，还有可用零件的差异
有的拥有能一击制胜的超巨型激光炮，有的集火发射能把你打成筛子的高频火箭炮，有十分坚硬的船体，而有的掌握加速修复的工具

只要零件在可用“p”数范围内，你就可以自由随意的搭建你的飞船，而根据所用的零件，你就可以决定出这艘飞船的飞行速度、操控性、战斗力、防御能力等性能参数了[spoiler]还有外貌协会[/spoiler]，光这一点，就能为游戏带来十足的趣味

利用 建造工厂 这一零部件，可以让你支付储存在飞船上的R点来生产预设好样式的飞船，你可以使它们跟随你，打造出一支星河舰队

而在这个宇宙中，你可以收复空间站，和其他和种族作战，穿越虫洞这些


比较有趣的，虽然本游戏它的确是一款单人游戏，但是在游戏中，当你进入虫洞时，无论是选择留在当前宇宙还是跳跃到另一个虫洞--相当于开始二周目，你的飞船会保留，你的飞船和你所设计的其他飞船都会被联网上传，地图上有一些红色箭头，靠近时，你就能遇到别的玩家所设计的飞船的，被程序控制着，如果你打败了它，就会掉落丰富的奖励，鼠标对准那艘飞船，你还可以看到设计者的名字，同理，别的玩家，说不定也会在游戏中恰好遇到你的飞船，只要你经过了上传

其实。。上面所提到的，大概就是这款游戏的所有内容了
刚开始玩的时候，是很好玩
当玩了一段时间之后，所有零件都解锁，p点升级到最高，能打遍宇宙无敌手之后，乐趣就会大幅度减少
也就是说，缺乏能支撑起后期游玩的耐久度

假如有续作，不妨去尝试加入：
+每个种族的故事背景，剧情模式，关卡编辑器
+基于指挥模式下扩展的，派系、联盟、阵营等
+零件丰富度的进一步扩展，以便搭建出功能性上各有不同的飞船
+多人游戏可用，pve，pvp均可
+更有趣的宇宙
+交易系统

Спустя наверно 3 лет игры в ванильную часть игры, а после созданием модов около 2 лет для этой игры, можно сказать одно - игра своих денег не стоит, но вот торрент эдишен вполне не плох. Игра относительно в заброшенном состоянии и новые механики или что-то ещё не вводятся игру уже долго, не говоря о багах, что не фиксятся с начало первых версий. Мда.

[b] Баги [/b]

Как я сказал, баги ещё со времен первый версии и как Артур их не исправлял, так и не исправил. Все возможные застревания и хреновая генерация, а так же ломаные крепления у блоков. И это малая часть того, что виднеется не вооруженным глазом, а если начать копаться или создавать моды, их наберется на целую тележку. 
Благо анонимный игрок англо сообщества пытается фиксить весь этот мусор.

[b] Генерируемый Мир [/b] 

Генерируемый мир неплох, он всегда чем-то населен, ты увидишь новых врагов или новые растения, по мере блужданию по космосу, обломки кораблей. Если вы купили длс то мир станет ещё более оживленным, есть одно маленькое [u]Но[/u] мир живой только вокруг вас, то есть там где вы были раньше ничего не произойдет. Да и там где будете тоже, время движется только вокруг вас, наверно главная причина игры, мир не живет сам.

[b] Музыка [/b] 

Ничего не скажу. Над музыкой постарались, это радует. Peaks постарался так же над музыкой из дополнения.

[b] Модинг [/b] 

Вот ради чего можно купить игру и только ради этого. Моды здесь разнообразные и говорить о них можно долго, иногда мелькает такое чувство, что они сделаны лучше чем игра. Именно они и могут затянуть на очень долгие часы, а если ещё и самому начать кодить, ооо - тогда это гуд.

[h1] Игра на один вечер [/h1]
Стоит ли брать игру решать вам, но единственное скажу - если вы возьмете игру, вы просрете деньги. Этой игры вам хватит на неделю, мб даже меньше и потом вы про неё даже не вспомните. Это если вы не хотите разбираться в модинге и создавать свои ""шедевры"" или строить миллионы кораблей, то игры вам хватит не на долго.

Mit den verschiedenen Fraktionen und Waffensystemen, die man sich schnell freischalten kann, ist Abwechslung stets gegeben.

Eines der bemerkenswertesten Features, wie ich finde, ist der kreativitätsstrotzende Schiffsdesigner, welcher quasi endlos viele  Anpassungs- und Designmöglichkeiten bietet und der eigenen Vorstellungskraft kaum grenzen setzt.

Als kleiner Kritikpunkt sei an der Stelle erwähnt, dass das kombinieren all dieser vielen verschiedenen Teile manchmal trotzdem dazu führt, dass es manchmal - vor allem bei größeren Schiffsprojekten - etwas knifflig ist, ein Schiff so zu entwickeln, dass alle Kontaktpunkte wieder zusammen führen - was einem perfektionisten schon mal leicht in verzweiflung stürzen kann - aber solange alle Teile miteinander verbunden sind, fliegt es trotzdem genauso gut.

Der Bereich, in dem man sich bewegen kann, ist simpel gehalten, was jetzt für ein Spiel dieser Art jetzt aber kein Manko darstellt.

Es wird einem auch neben dem normalen Spielmodus (ich erobere alle Stationen oder hüpfe wie es mich freut in das nächste Wurmloch auf die nächste zufällig generierte Karte) die möglichkeit Geboten, eigene - oder von Freunden generierte Schiffsdesigns - in einer Arena gegenüber zus tellen - dies kann als Einzel-Schiffskampf sowie als Flottenverband getan werden - was viel Raum für Experimente und Petrischalen-Faszination bereitstellt.

Den uneingeschränkten Sandbox-Schiffsdesigner, in dem es meines wissens nach keine spielbezogenen Einschränkungen auf Bauteile oder Punktemenge gibt, habe ich mir noch nicht angesehen, ist aber sicher für all jene eine interessante Spielwiese, die einfach noch ein bisschen mehr von allem haben wollen.

Mir hat dieses Spiel viele Stunden freude bereitet, weil ich gerne an Designs tüftel und versuche, meine alten Konstruktionen zu übertreffen - daher kann ich das allen Leuten empfehlen, die die Tiefe eines Spieles nicht in einer Story oder in einem sehr messbaren, langfristigen Fortschritt sehen, sondern in der Liebe zum Experimentieren und zum verwirklichen der eigenen Vorstellungen und Ideen, in einem kleinen Weltraumaquarium voller kleinerer, aber auch größerer Herausforderungen suchen.",1480188211,1480188211,True,2,0,0.514563083648681641,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Nachdem ich Reassembly sehr ausführlich gespielt habe, möchte ich auch eine Review verfassen. 

Meiner Menung nach ist Reassembly ein gutes Spiel, dass besonders Leute anspricht, die als Kind gerne Lego-Raumschiffe gebaut haben.

Pro

- minimalistischer aber sehr individueller Grafikstil
- guter atmosphärischer Sound
- stimmige Spielwelt und angemessener Spielumfang
- sehr leicht zu bedienender Schiffseditor
- Turniermodus gegen Schiffdesigns anderer Spieler
- fleißige Modding-Community
- regelmäßiger Support durch den Entwickler

Contra

- Teils dümmlich agierende KI
- gelegentliche Bugs

Selbst nach 300 Stunden feile ich weiter gerne an meiner Flotte und teste die einzelnen Schiffe dann ingame. Durch die umfangreichen Moddingmöglichkeiten, die selbst ohne Programmierkenntnisse kinderleicht umsetzbar sind, kann ich mir selbst weitere Inhalte schaffen oder auf die Kreationen anderer Spieler im Workshop  zurückgreifen.

Als Spieler taucht man anfangs mit seinem winzigen Schiffchen in dem zweidimensionalen Universum auf, und muss schon bald erfahren, dass es in diesem Teich noch viel größere Fische gibt. Da hilft nur eins: Wachstum. Und mit seinen endlosen Bauoptionen und den verschiedenen Fraktionen, die sich freischalten lassen, liegt hier wohl die größte Stärke des Spiels.
Die Kreativität kann sich frei entfalten, ein solider Schiffs-Designen erlaubt es, sowohl schöne als auch effiziente Raumfahrzeuge und -stationen zu erschaffen.
Die Gegner, denen man während des Spiels begegnet, sind interessant gestaltet, zudem enthält jedes Universum mehrere ""Agenten""-Flotten, die von anderen Spielern hochgeladen wurden. Zwischen den spielbaren und nicht-spielbaren Fraktionen, auf die man trifft, ist durch Farbcodes, Form und Verhalten gut zu unterscheiden. Zudem bringen sie spezifische Bauteile mit sich, die es ihnen erlauben verschiedene Rollen im universalen ""Ökosystem"" auszufüllen. Ein möglicher Kritikpunkt wäre die KI, die beispielsweise Schiffe, Freund oder Feind,  schon mal an einem Asteroiden zerschellen lässt und Waffen oft komplett falsch einsetzt.
Aus persönlicher Erfahrung kann gesagt werden, dass das Spiel meist flüssig läuft, und nur zu ruckeln anfängt, wenn sich der Bildschirm mit Geschossen füllt oder zu viel KI sich auf sehr kleinem Raum tummelt (besonders eine Fraktion agressiver Pflanzen bringt den Computer zum schwitzen).
Letztendlich ist Reassembly auch sehr Mod-Freundlich und zudem ist es oft interessant, sich mit Anderen über Bautricks und die Stärken/Schwächen der jeweiligen Fraktionen auszutauschen.
Insgesammt ist Reassembly also ein sehr interessantes Spiel mit sowohl ruhigen als auch hektischen Momenten (je nach Spielstil kann beispielsweise Ackerbau oder Jagd betrieben werden), das vor allem Baubegeisterte anspricht.",1480010344,1511457681,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Comprei assim que apareceu na steam, por realmente gostar desse estilo de jogo. Fiquei tempos construindo naves de todos os estilos possiveis, algumas que deram certo e outras nem tanto.
Esse é um jogo que merece mais atençao e eu recomendo sim. Se preferir algo mais detalhado vc pode ver aqui alguns pontos positivos e negativos na minha opniao :


PROS:

+Trilha Sonora - As musicas do jogo se encaixam bem com o ambiente de jogo, sao bem daora e dificilmente vc enjoaria delas, a nao ser que nao goste desse tipo de musica msm. 

+Construtor de Naves - Um dos pontos mais fortes do jogo. Tem varias funções aqui de copiar e colar partes das naves que facilita bastante. É simples e funciona bem. Provavelmente vc vai passar maior parte do seu tempo aqui.

+Sistema de Facçao - Uma variedade de facçoes pra desbloquear, cada uma com partes de nave diferente pra se utilizar que tornam cada facção unica.

+Combate - Muitas armas presentes no jogo, há momentos em que varias naves de facçoes diferentes se encontrarao no mapa, e rola uma rave basicamente, com todo tipo de arma disparando.

+Economia - Nesse game pra tudo voce vai precisar de Resources (R). Esse R cresce como plantas que se espalham nos asteroides. Voce pode coletar R das plantas ou pegar das naves destruidas.

+Mods – Com o workshop da steam, e possivel encontrar mods de naves ate mesmo de star wars, assim como mods que mudam o efeito grafico do jogo, outros utilitarios tambem, que tiram o limite de pontos que se pode usar na construçao de uma nave, entre outros.


CONS:

-Controles – Na verdade isso so é meio chato pra algumas facçoes apenas, parece que ou as naves tao pesadas demais ou elas sao tao leves que disparam com tudo e voce bate e explode em um asteroide, talvez eu é que seja noobzao mesmo.

-EndGame – Bom assim como todo jogo que voce completa, no final nao tem muito oque fazer quando voce toma controle dos territorios.

Building spaceships, even when they are complete failures (not that I know about that ;) ) is fun and very relaxing.

I felt this game was deserving it.

Imagine creating an ant colony in space, but having the ability to customize 100% of everything about your swarm,  this game feels like that.

It is the first game I play where I feel like i'm actually not the God of my army or colony, but part of something that is bigger, growing stronger.

The physics is beautifully crafted, and even though the graphics are simple, the gazzilions of things on your screen at the same time makes an art of itself, no need for texture, the world is texturing itself with polygons and quads, no intervention required...


The World is just big, like f..ing huge, and if that wasn't enough, there are wormholes getting you to yet another universe to conquer...
Plenty of races to conquer and find, only your imagination can stop you from advancing further...

The crafting for building ship, station, is very simple, yet extremely detailed, working with mass vs speed vs physix is realy cool, and gives your brain an opportunity to try things, 


It is the best game I have found myself grounded to my chair for 6 hours in a row ( 9h pm till 3h am ), in a realy big while, this game just did it.

Gratz to the dev, a very original and addictive game, 

Hope to see a Multiplayer friendly version sometime soon, maybe with some persistent server ( like a game of 30 days etc )

Serious enough that this game's development cannot be said to be complete. There are game-breaking performance issues, game-breaking UI bugs, and the AI wasn't finished being programmed.

[h1]Problems[/h1]

1. Laggy. I don't have a power gaming rig, but neither should I need one for a game like this. My computer has a decent processor and subpar graphics card, but the amount of lag is unreasonable. The big problem with this is that the way the physics engine has been programmed, the game physics slow down when the GPU can't keep up. Consequently, I often find myself unable to determine whether I'm flying at slow speed or experiencing physics lag. This often makes me crash into things and makes flight uncontrollable in general because I can't determine my actual in-game speed.
This is an unneccessary issue, as it's possible to program a physics engine with a fixed timestep that only draws frames as the graphics card can keep up. So there's no excuse for physics lag, really, even if the user has a subpar graphics card. It's just poorly programmed.
I'm quite sure the issue is with the video card not keeping up, since I have a pretty good CPU.

2. Bug: You can change the mouse-bindings on your ship to control what is activated by the left, middle and right clicks. However, if I go into the menu to change this binding then exit, it NEVER sticks. It doesn't save the change. I've been able to work around this a couple of times, I think by alterring something in the physical construction of my ship which 'tricks' the game into recognizing that some change needs to be saved.

3. Bug: There's no point having a child ship spawn order option if the game doesn't pay attention to it. You can set four ships to spawn from your own, and the order in which it will happen. The first one to spawn for me was number 4, then number 1. So there's no discernible order here.

4. Controls: I can't gel with twinstick shooters, so I opted for the keyboard and mouse. The game seems to be designed around this anyhow. You control your ship using the WASD keys, but the W key doesn't make you go up. Nope. It makes you fly forward with respect to the current direction your reticle (mouse) is from your ship. I find this counterintuitive, but perhaps there's a good game design reason for this.
Also, it's impossible to shoot in a direction other than the one where you're ship is facing (or currently turning to face). Why? The turrets are capable of pivoting, and if for example set to ""Point Defense"", will automatically shoot at enemies no matter which direction you're facing.

5. AI:
I find there to be way too many ships around stations owned by the player faction. It wouldn't matter, except that they crash into you. A lot. They don't seem to have any desire to avoid crashing at all.
For some reason, laser/beam/idunno weapons set to ""Point Defense"" will not shoot down enemy rockets, even if they have nothing else to do. Why? I can shoot them down manually with these weapons, so the capability is there. It's just unfinished AI.

6. Limited Ship Building parts:
From what I can tell, there's no 'structural integrity' component to designing ships. Parts don't experience torque or rip off or anything like that; I think the way it works is that each part is rigidly attached to every other part, until it takes sufficient damage to disappear and disconnect anything that was connected to it. That's fine. 
The problem is that sometimes you want to connect an important part (say the ship's shield) to multiple other parts of the ship so that there isn't just one link in the chain that needs to be broken for it to fall off of your ship. You can sometimes do this, but often there are times when parts are *almost* snapping together but there's a teeny bit of space between them. This comes about from the developer not paying enough attention to the geometry of the parts provided to ensure that this will happen less frequently. An easy way to solve this would be to put in a sort of 'strut' part that can have variable length and just serves to connect two bits of the ship. But nope, that's not in the game either.

Ed è una figata totale. Punto.

Oh, volete di più?
In generale, è un gioco molto molto ben fatto. Ogni fazione ha uno stile di gioco diverso (sebbene i Sentinel siano stupidamente OP e i Red siano praticamente impossibili da giocare), ed è molto divertente esplorare ogni lato di ogni fazione.

L'universo sembra davvero vivo. Le altre fazioni combattono tra di loro e i confini del loro territorio cambiano continuamente.

C'è un bel po' di strategia per quanto riguarda la costruzione di una nave, altrettanta per la costituzione di una flotta, e ancora di più per l'organizzazione della propria fazione.
Personalmente, adoro restare nel territorio della mia fazione e organizzare le stazioni e le diverse navi, in modo da espandere il territorio della fazione. 

La grafica è unica ed estremamente carina. Non stufa e dà al gioco personalità.

Reassembly è uno di quei giochi (Minecraft, Starbound...) dove se finisci per annoiarti, puoi scegliere tra MIGLIAIA di mod per rendere il gioco più longevo.
Le mie personali preferite sono Reassembler e Infraspatia. Se vi annoiate del gioco, non lasciatelo a marcire nel computer senza fare niente, date un'occhiata alle mod. Vi divertirete tantissimo! :D

Ci sono principalmente due pecche in fatto di gameplay: una volta raggiunta la massima grandezza per la nave, e si ha costruito una flotta decente non c'è più sfida. Tutti i nemici si diassemblano completamente ed è quasi impossibile morire. Per questo, però, ci sono gli agenti: flotte costruite da altri giocatori, che arrivano fino alla massima grandezza e spesso richiedono strategia per essere battuti. Se gli agenti in una galassia sono finiti, si può sempre passare alla prossima con un wormhole.

L'altra pecca è che ci vuole una certa quantità di tempo ad arrivare alla massima grandezza. Diventa frustrante dopo molto poco dover fare tutto da capo con ogni fazione. Per questo, però, ci sono varie mod. Potenziamenti gratis, soldi infiniti...

Insomma, potete fare quel che volete. Anche se il gioco non vi piace, c'è sempre una mod per risolvere ogni problema.

Consigliatissimo, anche se secondo me non vale il prezzo completo. Vi consiglio di prenderlo ai saldi.

Very easy to get into but plenty of depth the more you play. Everything is so polished and well done that you can really tell the developers put a lot of time and love into getting things just right. The only issue with the game at all I have seen, and it is unfortunately a kind of big one, is that when you form a fleet of ships to follow you they really don't follow you all that great sometimes. I have had over 100 ships with me then just by flying ahead straight to explore for a bit that number dropped down to 55. You can go back and get most of them added back to your fleet but that really shouldn't be a problem at all. I'm hoping they add the ability for your follower ships to simply warp jump back to you if they get too far away at some point soon to fix this, or something.

Upgrading your ""P"" so you can build bigger and better ships or add on to what you have is pretty fun and addictive, and producing your own fleet of ships you designed, including ones that can build other ships too to make a self replicating army, is great. 
Once you are at the point where you are flying a giant mothership armed to the teeth and can dominate the galaxy, you can always go to a new galaxy or start over playing as one of the many other very different and fun creatively designed factions you've unlocked. 

Other player designed ships invade your galaxy, which makes sure you always see something new and often challenging. I can see a ton of hours going into this game for just about anyone.

My favorite mod removes the P limit and allows you to build ships easily 30 times over the normal limit. Combine that with the Tinkerell and you get weapons akin to the Deathstar with engines. With a simple FWOOM it pierces through asteroids and obliterates a station sectors over.

Reassembly has an immense amount of replay-ability and customization available. Each faction you can control has a unique play style and strategy to it, which makes it really fun to jump around from one type to another. Building a big agent-level ship and blasting everything to bits in one shot will not always work (though sometimes it does) - sometimes you need to spawn a swarm of one hundred smaller, probe-launching ships to take down your foes while you kite from a distance.

The game takes in other players creations (like Spore, but better, because your changes actually mean something here) and fills your space with varied and changing enemies. If you've conquered one sector, it doesn't mean that the next will work out the same way.

I haven't made any of my own personally, but I have downloaded some factions made by other players, which just expands all that much more on how much you can see and do in this game.

I'm not done yet with the game, and I probably won't be for some time to come. I've at least got to get the final achievements first. ;)

I almost forgot one of my favorite parts: The soundtrack is AMAZING. I could just idle for hours listening to it.

各銃座や砲座、ジェネレーターやミサイル、スラスターなんかもくっつける
それをポイント内に収めて完成！
超簡単
最大ポイントは自軍ステーションを開放したり敵精力の船を倒したり、集めた資源をステーションに渡してお金を稼ぎ、お金を使って増やす
色んな追加装備を買う事も出来る
船体パーツはポイントを要しないのでくっつけ放題でつければつけるほど丈夫になるけど、いっぱいくっつけると重くなって動かすのに沢山の推力が要る様になる
慣性も大きくなる

そんなこんなで現在のベストな船をバシバシ作りベシベシ改良しよう
やってるとベストな船体パーツの組み合わせや、スラスターの設置場所、ベストな武器と設置場所が段々分かってくるけど、そんなんばっか考えてると豆腐かレンガかブロックか、みたいなダサさになりがちなので、やっぱカッコいい形を重視したほうがやる気が違うと思われる
私は油断するとすぐカメムシみたいな形になっていく

勢力は何気に8つくらいあった気がする←使えるの７つで敵専用が１つ
敵戦力の大型艦を撃沈すれば他勢力も使えるようになる
勢力ごとに使えるパーツ、パーツの性能なんかが違う
特に船体パーツになる図形の違いによって勢力ごとの船の外観に違いが現れるようになってるのは面白い
最初から使えるテラン、多分地球の船は正方形、長方形、直角三角形に二等辺三角形なんかがあるのでかなり自由にデザイン出来、クリスタラインは菱形と三角でちょっと癖があったり（でも意外と思った形に組みやすい）、ファーマーは四角が多くて角ばったデザインになりやすく、ティンクレルは二等辺三角ばっかで角が合わないので超組みづらい、とかある
装備も装甲が硬い分シールドがなく武装が少ないとか、軽く早い分脆いとかいろいろ
テランは初期勢力なだけあってとってもバランスいいし使いやすい
テキトーに作ってもちゃんと飛ぶし普通に強い
ファーマーもやたらパーツ多くて面白いけど、農民なだけあってぶっちゃけびっみょーに弱い
でも宇宙植物育ててのんきに過ごせるし実弾装備充実の脳筋武装でカッコイイ
ティンクレルはめっちゃデリケートで武装は少なくて超特殊でクセ凄くて尖りまくりでビンビン
機体のデザインと操作が強さに直結するからテクニカルなのが好きな人は堪らない
センチネルはゴリゴリしててティンクレルとは真逆
ゴリゴリ当ててゴリゴリ敵をすり潰して核弾頭どーんでめっちゃ強いけど武装少ないから飽きる系
レッドは、うん、Mな人にはいいんじゃないでしょうか
マップ中央に構えてるクリスタラインはやたら構造体の強度が高いのが特徴だけど武装が超少なくつまんないので何とか楽しさを見つけ出して下さい

初めはスタートしたらミニマップで青く表示されてる壊されたステーションに行って開放して回りつつお金稼ぐといいよ
稼いだら船体ポイントの上限上げつつ装備を増やして船をむくむく大きくしていく
そのうち船に工場を付けられる様になり、工場があると仲間の船を生産できるようになる
資源を集めて仲間の船をバンバン作っていくと大船団になり、そう簡単に負けなくなる
自分の船が強くなったら生産する船の改良もして行こう

あ、これ大事なんだけど、このゲームバグがあって数字キー１で船のデザインに入れるんだけど、そこから武装のバインドに行ってもバインドを記録できない
武装のバインドは直接Bキーでバインド画面に入ろう

ゲームは本当に綺麗で、なんというか顕微鏡で微生物の動きを観察してる、みたいな感じがしてくる
でも大多数の艦隊戦になるとなかなかに大迫力
単純なゲームなので宇宙船をペコペコ作って楽しめる人じゃないとすぐ飽きるかもしれない

You play as a member of a faction and each of the seven factions have their own unique play style because they all have different ship blocks! This game is crazy addictive.

Note: I put cons and improvements because I think the cons are covered in mods and the improvements seem very possible to update in vanilla or put in DLC. These also don't greatly impact the gameplay. It's worth every penny, buy it!

Pros:
-Beautiful colors and light animations.
-A good amount of variety.
-The ability to map reset through wormholes allowing extended play.
-OR export your current fleet into somebody else's map through wormholes!
-The ability to export ship designs.
-Pit your ships against others in tournaments! (browse through the workshop for those fun times)

Cons:
-There aren't many weapon choices per faction, unless you're faction 4.
-The block limitation is annoying. Why can't I make a huge, intricate ship?
-More polygons for building, please!
-The AI of my fellow comrades is sometimes very disappointing, especially when they pilot a ship that I created.

Improvements:
-There needs to be a friendly way to implement mods through a modloader.
-Great ship editor. There could be a fill/brush tool and a more dynamic selection method to be near perfect.
When I say dynamic selection I mean selecting a group of blocks with a freeform selection, instead of the clunky box method.
-More anchor points on the polygons in the ship editor.
-You could easily add a story and missions. Annihilating other factions is fun and all, but I want a purpose. This game could easily have lore.",1472414124,1474254075,True,12,0,0.665991902351379395,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You destroy enemy ships for resources, which you can then turn over to your faction for money to upgrade your ship size or unlock new equipment. If you find enemies that are too tough for you, you can still earn money by exploring and rebooting dead derelict stations or fighting weaker enemies. Wormholes allow you to reload the world and start fresh, and your fleet that you have designed gets uploaded to spawn in the worlds of other players. Whenever you start a world, fleets that other players have made will spawn as agents at the wormholes and start heading towards you slowly. This offers a challenge for late game players.

Par où commencer...
Les graphismes sont agréables et les effets particulièrement immersifs, voir jouissif lors des combats.
La 2D apporte efficacité et donne ici un gameplay simplement top : on peut créer et personnaliser son vaisseau de A à Z, le système d'amélioration et de déblocage de matériel (armements et autres systèmes) est idéalement réalisé (ayant joué à un jeu similaire où la mécanique était assez obscure en comparaison). Il faut mêler technique, imagination et aussi limite de « puissance » (P) du vaisseau, que je trouve assez basse (8000 points maxi à atteindre) mais suffisante pour rester en adéquation avec la plupart des ennemis rencontrés.
Les commandes en vol ou même lors de la partie construction du vaisseau sont bien pensées dans leur fonctionnement (raccourcis clavier, actions avec la souris) et personnalisable.
Pour le côté action, il y a de quoi voyager et conquérir, sans compter les « univers parallèles » accessibles grâce à une connexion Internet. La diversité des ennemis est surprenante et dépasse ce que j'avais pu voir jusqu'alors. Vous trouverez aussi la possibilité de créer à l'aide de l'usine une flotte de vaisseaux à vos ordres.
S'il y a point « négatif » à citer, et il est dérisoire, ce serait ça : certaines armes ont un effet de recul lors des tirs, qui peut être une composante certainement pas négligeable lors de tirs avec une batterie de ces armes. Personnellement surpris qu'il existe un recul sur une arme à énergie.

I definitely encourage people to check it out, though. It's pretty cool, for what it is. Like all the ""professional"" reviews discuss, this game harkens back to legos and all the nostalgic dreams attached thereon.

It has an interesting style of gameplay, and you can build your own ships. These ships ""evolve"" while you play, and you can unlock factions. There are a few quests, but mostly in the form of completing tutorial objectives. I enjoy seeing other players fleets (agents). 

But then I completed one faction 100%, unlocking all factions along the way. Made an 8k P ship, a few stations, and a few additions to my fleet. I completed another faction 100% in a little under two hours. And now I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. If you are efficient and play the game (the way it wants you to play), any eagle-eyed player would see there are game breaking ships that can be built in just about every faction.

Personally, I feel the game has little content and replay value. While, exciting at first, it just drops off. Stops. Turns stale and boring. 

Pros:

-Good gameplay and shooter physics
-Great graphics made better by Splinter's Mod
-Seven Factions with different parts and playstyles
-Lots of variety, but only when you face off againt agent fleets

Cons:

-Once you figure out the game, you can max your faction fleet in about two hours (getting to 8K P and constructing your fleet).
-No real endgame beside tournaments/sandbox
-Too easy (at 8k P and your wits, you'll decimate everything)
-Too repetetive, even changing factions
-Not enough blocks
-Small Workshop selection of Mods (mostly factions)
-Game Breaking Ships (See forums for threads or the guides on this)
-Agent fleets can troll players making it not hard, but annoying (ships with 99% missiles or drones for example)
-Not enough real variety
-No real bugs, but there are some issues (getting stuck in quick regenerating stations, thrusters on ships not activating).

The game just left a bad taste in my mouth. It's a cool idea, but it doesn't really feel complete. There isn't enough to  keep me coming back. There was so much potential, and it's wasted. Maybe there will be a #2.

Its simple, and doesn't have much in it - but its just so beautifully executed that I have a hard time criticizing it. The first thing you'll notice is just how damn good it looks. The simple style mixed with the flashy bright particle effects make every ship look fantastic, even if your not a skilled builder. Basically, you start as a faction with a little plot of territory in the galaxy, and must build ships with increasing size and power, collect resources, conquer and annihlate opposing factions, and eventually control the whole galaxy. 
You manage your faction in a simple screen that essentially says ""what ships should we build?."" Not every ship you construct will be your own, you'll find yourself making everything from Carriers to Gatherers to Melee brawlers, all supporting your faction on a galactic scale, not just following you around.
Pros
-Visuals: Just look at them. They're mesmorizing...
-Simplicity: This may not be for everyone, dont expect complexity and depth. Though this DOES NOT MEAN ITS NOT SKILL BASED, more on that later. The simple building system allows you to make pretty ships that are functional in minutes, and make enormous detailed bohemoths in about 20 minutes. Its just so easy to do,  you dont even have to be creative, really. (That is not saying there isn't lots of room for creativty.) 
-Skill: Outside of building, you've got to know how to pilot your ship. ou can die fairly easy and lose control of your entire fleet, so you've got to be careful. You can play just bumrushing everything, but you'll die a lot. I recommend lots of mobility, even in ships that wouldn't ordinarily need it. I cant count the amount of times I failed to remember to make good thruster systems and ended up with a floaty brick.
-Faction Growing: By far the games greatest strong point. Over time, as you see A.I. ships you created flying about and taking territory for you, it gives you a nice feeling of progression. You can even costomize what the stations you capture will look like. I found myself building unarmed civilian vessels and giant mining ships just so that our territory would seem lived in. I build a cheap but huge metropolis that I spammed all over my land so that it looked like there were cities. 
This stuff is not entirely nonefunctional. I found that building mini mining ships that gathered all the R (resource) they could, letting all my stations spam them out, then just recruit them all so they'd give me more R then it costed C (credits) to hire them. I would then sell the R for C and make a fortune.
-The organic galaxy: Unlike most games, the galaxy is all in one map. Its not particularly big, you can fly across it in five to ten minutes with a fast ship. (Though you likely wont make it, the amount of enemies flying around and waring with eachother will kind of get in the way.) However, I think the map is better off small. You see, if it were big like actual space, it'd be empty. This map is anything empty. In fact, its a bit of a cluster****, and thats a good thing. The map is one giant asteroid field, inhabited by countless factions all fighting for territory. Whilst exploring, you will frequently find crashed and destroyed ships, stations, etc. And there will always be plenty of ships to fight. Once you get bigger, most of them wont be two much of a threat. But every now and then, a giant mothership will pop out of nowehere and blow you to pieces.
Ships dont just spawn when you get close, they all came from somewhere. And you can, if you blow enough of them up, completely genocide them. The factions will all be trying to do this to eachother (though they likely wont ever succeed due to the sheer amount of eachother) and you will constantly stumble across epic space battles and land grabs. Indeed, the whole galaxy is a warzone, and a chaotic one at that. There will sometimes be so much going on screen all you can see are particle effects( despite this and my fairly low end PC, the games runs like butter) Being able to zoom in and out greatly adds to the games scale as well. Oh yeah.. And also, SPACE PLANTS! SPAAACE PLAAANTS!
-Soundtrack: The fantastic ambient space music fits the game perfectly, with its Psychill electronic style making for a very relaxing genocide war.
-Tournements: I had a fun time with two friends, just playing the game locally during a get together, in which we all build ships of the same P limit and made them fight in the tounrement. Making your ships fight eachother is addictive enough without it being a competition between friends, so I recommend checking it out.
-Gameplay: It plays a lot like the old arcade space shooters, just far smoother and a bit more physicsy (eiiy? Eee?) This works really well with the open world aspect, making it a joy to play. Works really well as both a timewaster and a longer effort. There are a number of ways to play Reassembly, you can spend all your time making perfectly crafted fleets and sending them through wormholes to fight other players, or you can just make one ship and be a lone wolf, building your ship to perfection over time. Me? I prefer to play it on a large scale, assembling fleets and building military strength.
-Agent System: One of the better semi-online systems I've seen. Basically, you can upload your best fleets into wormholes, and they will appear in other players worlds to wreak havoc. Its kind of like Dark Souls's world invasion thing, but you dont control the fleets you send out. They are A.I. cotrolled. Agents appear as little red triangles, and vary in strength. (depending on the P (ship size) of the fleet the player sends out). If you destroy their flagship, the fleet breaks up and stops building new ships. They will spread out, raiding your stations, but will eventually all die.
This is a fantastic way for players to show off their creations. Although you will inevitably see a few giant blocks full of guns, most of the designs I've seen have been quite good looking.
Cons
-Lack of weapon variety: Weapons are a crucial part of the game. Sadly, most weapons are just generic projectile weapons, with some doing more damage then others. To be fair, there are lasers, drones, missiles, AoEs, but every faction seems to have most of those. The faction variation is more in their visual style and armour then their actual difference in combat. There are some more interesting weapons, such as the Proton Sword, the Borg Drones (Yes, Borg), and it seems as though every faction has at least one special gun, I would like to see more weapon types in the future. Stuff like wave guns, tracking lasers, force guns to blow enemies away from you, etc. 
-Can get repetitive: Make sure to play this game in successive bursts. Playing for hours and days at a time will get boring fast, its better picked up and played for a few hours every now and then. 
Procons?
-Balance issues: I dont really know about this one, its undeniable some factions are better then others (Red sucks, Crystalline are gud) but I wouldn't really call it a bad thing. Its more of a progression system, as the tougher factions are usually closer to the centre of the map. Make of this what you may.
Overall - worth a buy. One of the best games I've seen come off Steam, and an excellent example of what Indie Devs can do!

You start with a predefined ship. Explore, gather resource, destroy enemies, build/upgrade your ship, then repeat the whole process until you conquer the space, perfect your ship as far as your idea can go.

IMHO, this is where it determines Love/Hate opinions. If you like the concept, you will love the game as it has been executed very well, but for those that turns off by this kind of gameplay, it is a skip for Reassembly.

[h1]Control & Combat[/h1]
One of the two main core element. It has very common control for the genre, which can be floaty, weird, need some get used to.

The combat is rather simple from the looks, but actually there are some depth behind that plain looking combat. Weapon positions, projectile ranges, projectile speeds, special attributes, timing, and elae play the major role in the combat.

These come down to the second core element ...

[h1]Ship Editor & Management[/h1]
Simple, easy to use, but powerful ship editor. It's snap'n build style, so it is easy to understand, and to get into. You can turn you ship into anything limited to your imagination, and ... system limitation, not the all you can build.

Each part you put into your design has its purpose, and different in stat. They will affect how your ship fly, either for exploration or combat. I haven't gone much deeper into this, but it is trials and errors until perfection, imo.

You can have AI-squadmates too, which is positively nice, but a little annoyance at times.

Here comes the twist, you can fly into other players creation during your gameplay. They are AIs with custom ships, which can be ranged from wackiest ship that annoy you to hell, or the flying box of death.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
It is a good game for this genre at this price. Recommended !",1467265766,1467265796,True,17,0,0.654254794120788574,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Like many space games of this type, you start out with almost nothing, a tiny ship with very little firepower that is going to die against most other ships it encounters, but that's ok, because you aren't alone. Scattered around near you are bases and ships of your own faction that you can, with a bit of strategic thinking, use to your advantage to defeat even large enemies. Just be careful not to drag anything TOO powerful over to one of your bases.

You can earn money by gathering resources and selling them. These can be obtained from harvesting space 'plants' that can produce resources in various ways, or from destroyed vessels. This money can then be spent on parts that can be added to your ship, and that's where the real fun begins.

The ship editor is, simply put, brilliant. You can drag and drop parts onto your ship to create a vast array of different craft, and once a craft is designed, your own faction stations will ALSO build those ships (alongside the standard designs), so you will see your own vessels and stations being used as part of the overall design of the map.

Physics apply, it might seem like a good idea to build a small ship with an enormous cannon on it (or a large ship with several), until you find yourself being thrown backwards every time you shoot, the positioning of things like thrusters will affect the manouverability of your ship etc, which means you actually have to think about the design of your vessel, and yet somehow the whole thing feels simple to use and doesn't over-complicate itself. Each faction is unique and requires a different approach to vessel design and gameplay, so you can either choose a faction that suits your style, or attempt the challenge of one that requires you to leave your gaming comfort-zone.

The music works incredibly well with the game, and takes me instantly back to the late '90's with groups such as 'Future Sound of London', and that works incredibly well with the visual themes.

Even the issues I CAN think of are largely based around things like Mods that use vast quantities of things like drones or missiles, causing the game to AI-lag or possibly even crash, or the fact that, in factions that have resource-generation modules such as Solar Panels, you can build an enormous ship filled with these modules and your factions A.I will become obsessed with them, pumping them out seemingly in preference to fighting-vessels.

In summary, this is a 4x game stripped down to its core, and it works brilliantly. Very much worth the investment.",1467258974,1467258974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Yes I enjoy the entirety of the game.
It's very unique and very enjoyable.
But still I give it a negative rating.
Reason: This game is over a year old. It has mod support and a good healthy community. YET it crashes so often it is frustrating. There is no pattern to the crashes, the game isnt intensive in anyway. Nothing beats the frustration of spending a good 30mins on a ship only to the game crash on you. Or even worse, finally kill that stupid enemy that spawned in and destroyed most of your economy, only to have the game crash and have to do it all over again.

What I got for a 15 dollar game was something amazing. You start with only one faction which you then are to use to take out at least one capital ship of another faction to unlock it. You start out tiny. As you explore and grow, learning lessons and tricks, dropping starbases and capital ships across the universe- and other universes for that matter, you will find yourself just looking to find something new. The thing is, every new discovery just sets the stage for the next new find. Different factions play radically differently, some with powerful custom built cannons, to another with few weapons, but a severe penchant for ramming- and the equipment to make it hurt when they do. 

Perhaps the most striking thing of this game, to me, is the amount of thought that has gone into it. Want to build a starbase? Build a design including a factory but no thrusters. A monster capital ship which can build more of itself? No problem, include plenty of storage. Almost everything can be resized. Changing sizes increases mass, storage(if applicable) and armor, which means you’ll need more thrust to maneuver. You can not only build other ships, but build ships which can build other ships. Then tell them what you want them to build.  

All and all great fun.

I was COMPLETELY WRONG. 

Reassembly is much deeper than you'd suspect, offering many hours of gameplay due to its well-executed procedural generation, plenty of weapons and a dozen factions. Although the game lets you roam free immediately after the short but very good tutorial (it teaches you all the basics while still letting you free to do as you please, and you'll have to learn the rest by playing), there is more than enough to do. You can build a sizeable fleet, design perfect ships, take over all space stations, wipe a faction off the map, destroy asteroid fortresses, take down strong fleets created by other players, or warp to an entire new map with your fleet.

Combine the simple, yet deep and very addictive gameplay with the amazing, trance electro music and the colourful, pleasing graphics, and you've got a great game for a great price.

The ship creation is extremely fun and you can spend hours at a time in it trying to make a perfect ship, though there are  few blocks that just don't seem to fit in due to being just the wrong size or shape, the presented challenge of working around this sometimes makes it even more fun working out a good combination between makeing the ship look good and makeing it work well(and not have weak points that one shot will disconnect half you're ship).

The other part of the game, focusing of flying and fighting is also a huge amount of fun, you can really feel the weight of the larger ships and it is always fun to kill a tiny ship with a shot the same size as it. The only limiting factor in this part of the game is the fleet of ships you can build and make, as they seem to lack a bit in the way of AI and commands you can give them, and they tend to just fly around in circles, get in the way, or get lost behind you and leave the fleet because they are too far away.

Just because Reassembly lacks a third dimension, it doesn't skimp on content. Design your own ships to wage war on the rest of a barren voidspace filled with factions wanting to ruin your day.

Vast variety of gameplay styles, from the passive Farmers to the rush-them-first-and-ask-later Bees.

You can also pit your creations against others, or even your Steam friends', using tournament mode.

'Agent' fleets you fight are actually from other players after uploading them through wormholes.

Massive modding options from a good community. Choices range from hardcore mode factions to easy overpowered ones. Various quality of life mods too.

The main difference is, Reassembly does this is a very unique and different way. You have full control of what you ship, or station, will look like, except for the manditory command module. You can use a variety of parts for all of the playable factions and many modded factions. You can build a fleet to your specifications and can use it to conquer the entire universe that was generated for your faction to reside in. Each faction has its own special parts with their own specifications aswell as their own types of weaponry. 

(Note: These numbers I am using are not based on faction id's in the Sandbox.) 
WARNING: SOME PEOPLE MAY CONSIDER THIS NEXT PART AS A HUGE SPOILER. DO NOT READ IF KNOWING THIS INFORMATION SPOILS THE GAME FOR YOU. [spoiler] Faction 1 ""The Terrans: The starting faction, it is very well balanced and generally simple to use. Faction 2 ""The Farmers"": Largest variety in parts, this faction tends to behave neutrally, but can be very deadly later on. This faction is known for its seed planter. Faction 3 ""The Reds"": This faction has the weakest hull armor. They do however, have the most parts on their ships, due to their blocks not being able to scale. This faction also tends to have the most weapons on their ships, and very good point defense. Faction 4 ""The Tinkrell"": This faction has customizable weaponry, making them have the ability to obtain the most powerful weapons in the game. Faction 5 ""The Crystalline ships"": This faction has very strong hull armor and some of the most powerful plasma cannons in the game. Faction 6 ""The bees"": This faction has very powerful lasers, and the most powerful thrusters in the game. Faction 7 ""The Sentinels"": This faction is well know for its nukes and obliterator burst lasers, a certain type of part can even used for melee damage. [/spoiler]

Pros:
-Massive level of creativity able to be put into your playthrough.
-Many ways to play.
-Variety of factions to play as.
-Many ships to fight.
-Very active workshop.
-Great community and fan base.

Cons:
-Their is a P limit based on the command module, amount of thrusters, and amount of weapons the ship has.
-Their is a block limit based on the amount of blocks your ship has.

The fact that you can both upload your designs to appear in other players' universes and encounter theirs as roaming and often deadly 'agents' along with the game's 7 inherent playable factions (there are some non-playable ones as well) plus workshop support make this game a lot of fun.

You start with a simple small ship but you can unlock both more systems to build with and larger ships via combat and resource gathering and can unlock the other factions via battle so you can try their unique playstyles in future games. The best part of the game's factions is that while they all have some similiarities, they are quite diverse and not simply reskins of each other.  Playing the starting Terran faction is quite different from the Reds which are different from the Sentinels and so on.

You eventually get to build ships from your ship and can keep them with you or release them and they'll defend areas as your control expands. Your AI allies will even build copies of your ship and you can use the interface to affect their production queues.

You also have a lot of control options and can even set how your weapons are keyed so you can fire every weapon via the LMB or put even big cumbersome weapons on point defense duty if you like. There's a lot to love here.

-它能让我永远停不下来
-你可以设计自己的飞船，然后和其他部落的飞船或者舰队干架
-你还可以上传自己的舰队，希望自己的舰队可以打遍天下无敌手（实际上。。。）

不过可惜的是

-最大只能有8000的点数去造飞船，这让我最初想造个大核战舰的想法变得更难了，不过即使你到了8000也不一定就是绝对不会输了。(另外可以通过mod添加点数上限，所以我还是造出来了)

If you liked SPAZ or Starsector, you’ll LOVE this game!

For a game made by one guy, heck, even compared to other indie games with teams of developers, Reassembly ranks up with there with my favorites. Reassembly can be compared to Space Pirates and Zombies and Starsector, 2 other top-down space exploration/combat games; however, Reassembly has them both beat in customizability, unscripted expansion/development of the player faction, and ambience. The gameplay is easy to get into and gets as complex as your creativity can make it, yet still retains simplicity which makes it easy and fun to sit there creating a large complex spaceship tailored to your desires. As you expand and grow your faction, your AI will begin building ships you design for them and in order to expand more you could employ many ways to take over sectors of the galaxy. From bringing a fleet of ships to having a carrier with masses of drones or even piloting a singular dreadnought to carve through enemy territory, or even coming up with your own tactics as you can create any kind of ship you want block by block (even copy pasting big chunks of ships to create modular designs) the designs are limitless!

As for quantity of content, the base factions are interesting but when they get bland the developer made Reassembly open source allowing anyone to easily create their own factions or even universe altering mods and upload them for anyone to download and play from the Steam Workshop. The community, while small, is one of the nicest and most dedicated I’ve seen, and you’ll definitely never run out of quality new factions to download and try out or play against. This includes mods that change the entire galaxy to a star wars themed galactic war to mods that create a 2 faction war between humans and zombies in space, to... well just check the Workshop and you’ll see all the amazing stuff going on!

这款游戏无时无刻的向你展示重组这个概念。
当你开着系统默认的种族飞船，你遇到了第一个空间站，然后你拿到了游戏中的一桶金时，你已经可以开始重组你的飞船了。

[h1]游戏性：[/h1]
  我很喜欢这款游戏的一个原因就是，这款游戏拥有着极其简单而又好玩的游戏规则，就是占空间站-打敌人-获取资源-到空间站换钱-重组飞船，整一个游戏就是围绕着这一个流程不断地循环，但是因为你需要用钱来解锁更多的模块和运用方块的上限，所以刷刷刷地过程并不会觉得无聊，每一次的重组，都可以清晰地感受到自己变强了。关于DIY飞船，整个游戏拥有36中模块可以供你选择，你可以做成近战机动性高的光剑船，也可以做出吊风筝的导弹船，想做出什么样的船，全看你的选择。玩到后期的时候，更是可以设计自己的小弟，带领着大批小弟，和敌方的舰队对抗。

[h1]画面[/h1]
  画面简单不失酷炫，用着非常明显的颜色对比，和各种武器的特效，来给玩家造成视觉上的冲击!

[h1]BGM[/h1]
  整个原声异常带感~里面的歌曲既可以给你带来宇宙那种寂寞空灵的感觉，又可以让你热血沸腾的电音曲。总之我是入了21块钱的原声。。。。。。。

[h1]缺点：[/h1]
  玩家可以通过虫洞前往其他玩家的世界，但这仅仅是前往世界而已，你并不能和其他玩家进行在线的PVP。在DIY的过程中，对于方块的限制很多，例如你不能摆在两个方块的中间，限制了玩家对于飞船外形的创造。在你玩了3-4个小时后，你的飞船基本已经是无敌的存在了，缺少玩家之间的对抗，让游戏后期的内容较为无聊。有人表示游戏在同屏飞船量过多的时候，会比较卡顿，本人970M没感觉啦(～￣▽￣)～*

[h1]总结：[/h1]
  小小的容量却拥有着极大的内涵，总体来说适合那种特别喜欢远星行号的玩家，也同样适合喜欢骑砍那种带着小弟冲冲冲占占占的人！其他的玩家则是可以在打折的时候买买买哦~
+高自由度的DIY
+带感的BGM
+炫酷简洁的画面
-非常迷的联机
-DIY对于方块的位置限制较多，逼死强迫症系列
-后期内容较为无聊

然而我从来都不自由。又有谁生来就是自由的呢？我很孤独，所以只能在这自己的世界里寻找象征的含义，后来我才了解到，我自己的世界在真正广阔的世界里是十分稚拙粗糙的。在世界的一个角落，现在的我感到无所适从。

一点心得
人类前期导弹起家，可以迅速的在红族那里捞上第一桶金。
AI农民族不会经营，整个就一提款机，希望后续版本可以改善。
看到水晶族（紫色）的时候如果你还是以导弹为主力 ，给你个建议
快跑啊傻孩子
四五千容量，可以立足于宇宙的时候可以加装工厂，前期的话，只有推进器和核心的导弹小船，无人机小船，激光小船，地雷小船可以选择几样，结合护盾和一个小电池，效果也是非常得不错。
建议使用自带的两个模版进行改造，弓手和飞镖（自行命名，领会精神）
后期还是面包状多功能的小船比较实用。
遇到有害植物海站远一点，加装几个辐射散布的炮去提款，心疼小船的别进，电脑不好的别进
哦对了，电脑不好的别进
还有，电脑不好的别进
农民族，前期不要给自己按上一万个太阳能板
不是说这个装置有什么问题
问题是这个种族没什么蓝图，空间站生出来的小船全是你的复制体
当你发现你被一亿个太阳能孙行者和行者孙包围的时候就只能删档重开了
那么分享一下我的开局
闲逛赚钱，攒出播种装置和拖拉机，然后找一个石头比较多的区域播种收获交易
攒出工厂
造一个被草方块包围的小船，和容量高一点，有拖拉机且引擎功率大的另一种小船
就可以手动制造一个种植园
播种收获交易
把自己变大一点装满播种机和推进器和拖拉机
播种收获交易
现在你是宇宙第一农场主，手上的美金让你分外后悔以前曾经是个人类
装备全解锁，容量全解锁，后面的还用我教你么，你玩还是我玩啦？
然后是侦查兵族还是什么族让我给忘了，跑得贼快的绿色族群
设计方向基本是打一枪（一梭子）换一个地方
后期可以买下伤害超级感人的核武器
我设计了一种前端是装甲和撞角，后方是核武器的小船
已上传至虫洞，怀揣着设计者最纯洁最恶意的期望，希望能多祸害几个萌新
水晶族，装甲硬的跟开了挂一样，炮也不错，只不过游戏默认的浮夸设计给了你们一种可以艰难的打下的错觉。

1.Саундтрек. Без него игра становится не тем. Как по мне, он отлично подходит к тематике игры.

2.Мотивация. Играя в эту игру, ты каждый раз видишь те корабли, которые больше тебя и сильнее, и они тебя постоянно убивают. Это мотивирует тебя часами сидеть в редакторе корабля и строить его так, что-бы он был непобедим. Но это очень сложно.

3.Агенты. Это те корабли, которые были созданы другими игроками и ты можешь найти их, и устроить  эпические баталии(нет, т.к. обычно тебе попадается какой-нибудь огромный корабль с не менее огомным флотом, который тебя разносит за пару секунд.), и эта идея мне очень нравится.

4.Сама тема космоса. Не знаю, как вы, но я обожаю космос и все, что связанно с ним.

5. Разнообразие игровых рас(фракций). По мере прохождения игры, ты открываешь новые расы и у каждой из них свое оружие, блоки и из-за этого ты хочешь поиграть за каждую из них.

6. Имеется workshop, а это плюс куча контента от других игроков.

7. Редактор карт. Я хоть им и не умею пользоваться, но для креативных игроков это большой плюс.

Из минусов,я думаю, это отсутствие мультиплеера. Но я очень надеюсь, что его добавят, а то очень уж хочется поиграть в эту прекрасную игру со своими друзьями.))",1457971492,1457971492,True,5,0,0.519841313362121582,1,True,False,False,False,,,

The best part, obviously, is building your own ships and experimenting with designs.  As you gather resources you can purchase better parts.  Each of the factions have a unique theme and require different strategies to design. The ship building interface is very intuitive and easy to use, which is a big plus.  

It's a nice, chill single player game but I think overall it lacks depth, which I will describe below.
There's really no need for specialization against any particular foe. With such flexibility in ship design I was hoping this game could push this concept more.  Once you have a decent ship it works against all factions almost universally. You can fiddle with designs for a while, but in the end, more expensive parts will make you better.  With many factions it's quickest to destroy enemy ships for resources, so that becomes your sole focus.  Once you max out your ship, basically nothing stands in your way.  Unless you tried to get all the Steam achievements, like I did, there's not much of an end game to keep you playing.  I spent most of my time on this game grinding out achievements. 

In conclusion, it was fun but lack of depth put me on the fence on this one.  After getting all of the achievements, I feel like I tapped out all of my reasons to keep playing.   I would have liked to see the ship building aspect developed further.  I'm leaning on the fence to recommend this game, but it was still fun for the time being.

This game is that sandbox you played in as a kid. While most people were playing GI Joes and army men, you were pretending that firetruck was a star destroyer. That Tonka truck was a Carrier. This game is that sandbox, and that Carrier is real.

Anything in your mind can be made in this game. Do you want to build unrealistic space gods that spin at 2000mph while sneezing death? Do it. Maybe you want to build a true to design Star Destroyer, or the BattleStar Galactica? I've seen CIS Control ships, the Serenity, a Borg fleet, and a literal pirate ship with tiny whale escorts. If the blocks fit, you can build it. And the blocks always fit(not).

As for actual mechanics, this game starts you out as a tiny little fighter. You destroy enemy ships, reactivate defunct friendly stations and gather resources. These resources allow you to upgrade your ship, until one day you too can build a battlecruiser the size of a small moon. You can also produce your own fleet, which can in turn produce its own fleet or follow you into combat or both. There are tons of ways to play the game, and little things you will find that feels like your own little trick.

TL;DR: This game is too much fun. You will get addicted. You will stop playing, and then come back and splurge another 50 hours on it after you think you forgot about it.

1. Ships can be made insanely fast, too fast for most weapons to even have a chance of hitting.
2. All turrets have the ability to turn 360 degrees, making ship design as simple as slapping as many guns into an armored ball.
3. Engines can be inside your ship, meaning there is no way to damage them without first destroying the components around them.
I love how the building works, but I feel like there's still a lot of balancing that needs to be done, since the meta just dictates blobbing up as many guns as you can fit with either:
a. shittons of armor (which is entirely free most of the time, so you could make a massive armored box at the very beginning)
b. shittons of engines, making you pretty much impossible to hit with anything but lasers (although the speed is best put into use by the AI controlled ships, since they can instantly dodge out of the way of almost any attack)

I love this game, but I hope it gets the things I mentioned.

All you do is build a ship out of 2D shapes, shoot other ships, and try not to get blown up, all while making your blocky ship bigger and better. And yet, the game manages to do for me what even big-production space titles like Elite: Dangerous couldn't: absorb me in an expansive, living universe that I got hours of fun out of. It's easy to jump into, there's unlimited creative potential in making your ships, the destruction effects are satisfying, and you never run out of things to shoot, because the only thing there really is to do is expand your territory by destroying enemy ships, of which there are in (sometimes frustrating) abundance.
The ""passive mulitplayer"" mechanic is enjoyable, because while you can't very well taunt over the wreckage of destroyed player ships hoping to give your enemy some quality killcam footage, you can still feel smug knowing you just trashed the MVP of someone else's universe without expecting them to come back for revenge. 
The game world in its geometric minimalism is surprisingly atmospheric, almost organic, and this feeling is certainly helped by the Brian Eno-esque music. There's no real plot that ties the 6 factions together as far as I know, but I feel like any kind of story would weigh down the smooth simplicity of the gameplay.

You build an incredibly customizable ship, an equally customizable fleet, in fact you can get a good list of ships and stations done and switch universes so that only your stuff is out there; or go back and order all the existing stations to change to your designs, telling stations to become warships and vice versa.

A 2D top-down shooter not unlike space invaders or asteroids in the sense that you fly around and shoot stuff. Reassembly takes it to a whole new level, allowing you complete customization of your ship. You can connect various parts, which snap together at points like legos, to create whatever your mind can come up with. At the beginning of a playthrough, your ships will be small and fairly weak, but as you advance you will be able to fly massive frigates followed by your very own custom fleet.

One of my favorite parts of ship creation is the physics of thruster placement. Where you put your thrusters actually matters a lot; your ship won't be able to turn very well if you only place them on the back. This also lets you build some funny creations such as ships that travel by spinning. It also means that if you are having trouble progressing, you can completely change the feel of your vehicle by moving or adding a thruster.

Creation aside, the game revolves around the aquisition of currency (called ""C"") and resource (called ""R""). You get both of these basically by blowing up your enemies, the other ship factions. You use your C to buy upgrades and new parts for your fleet, allowing you to take on bigger enemies. If you manage to conquer your whole galaxy, no big deal, the game allows you to jump into a wormhole to enter a new galaxy with your fleet. You can also unlock new factions to play as; all of them utilize different base shapes for their ships, meaning you can create entirely new ideas playing one faction that you couldn't with another.

If you feel like you've peaked, you can upload your fleet, sending it to other players' games as a powerful opponent called an Agent. This is a really great part of the game, it keeps things challenging and fresh.

Overall, I put this game in the same circle as Spore. You create cool things and share it with others. The game is fun to look at, very colorful, and it has an awesome soundtrack. If you like building things, if you like space, or you like shooting the hell out of ships, just go buy Reassembly.",1454394124,1454394394,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have to say, I really like this game. There are somethings that could be done, like more content.There is just a lot of things in certian faction where as others, they're really empty. I spent my first session on this game, and completed it within 12hours(hit the cap and conqured the map (once) and got allraces). That's one sitting. (on weekend) I really wish some more things were added to it, mods filled the rest but it's just grinding and doing the same things over again. I built a fleet to the size of 700+ ships. NOTHING STANDS IN YOUR WAY. I'm talking cheap small ships though, like 42-45p. The 8000P Cap is dis-tasteful. Although I got a mod to increase the maxium amount of P. It feels dead. There is nothing striving me forward. Usually, when I play games were you reach an extent of 'stability' in a game, I would decide to expand and make things more efficient, bigger, better than they're suppose to be in the first place. (like an ever growing population) This game is diffrent. You have to Build a ship, and get stations, and farm resources. That aside, I really loved this game with building, customizing, there is alot of freedom to it that I enjoy. One things I found a very easy way to exploit was to just put all my weapons on Point Defense. No need for me too actually use my guns myself. Another thing I hated was the weapons, there wasn't any speacialization or limitations with what I could stick on my ship as long as it could fit with the P limitation it was fine. I am happy with the factions we have, I don't think neccesarily we need more. A storyline would be nice, I just go around shooting everything instead of expanding with friendlies, making alliances, trading, capital ships. I wish this game was a lot more than it is now. One more thing I like to add is the AI, the AI doesn't know how to do anything. All my weapons carve straight to their core after they decide to 'rush' me.

First off, factions seems to be kind pointless, because with over 50 hours, i didn't not once experienced that another faction acted as whole, in other words, a faction and all it ships just stand around completely idle doing nothing, never trying to take down station or conquer another faction unless they're within their detection range. making the game such a pushover as the enemy faction ai never challenge you, Also your own faction seems to have no AI of its own, when you're busy conquering the universe not once did a have a allied fleet come and help me unless i paid them or was in same area, unless you fly straight into the enemy fleets, which also as far as i know are completely idle if the player is not within its detection range or sector area

Second off why doesn't enemy ships evolve as time goes on? Once you have a max P ship at 8k or even 6-7k, you might as well just start another game because at that point the enemy is powerless against you, hell i even installed the mod that does so there is at all times like 40 agents on the map, and i download all the highest rate/sub modded boss fleets, even so once i hit that 6-8k P nobody can touch me...

-Множество разных миров, в которые можно попасть ""через кротовые норы""!
-Большой выбор орудий и разные фракции со своими оружиями и сложностю

So here I am.

A 2D top down space shooter whilst accurate, is a poor description for this game as there is much more to it than that.  The graphics although basic are perfect for the game.  The sound is also well chosen.

You start in a pre-designed ship but as time goes on you can add to the design or just create a new one from scratch.  There are a decent variety of weapons and other modules to choose from, like rockets, missiles, torpedoes, mines, lasers, projectile based weapons and crazier ones.  Your ships can also house a factory to build other ships on the fly, which in turn can have a factory and can build.  With a bit of time you can have a fleet of AI controlled ships following you around until you dismiss them to do their own thing, and they do.  AI ships not under your control will continue to gather resources and contribute to your factions efforts.  Time to colonise and control the galaxy!

The map is large, and the factions varied, although I am now starting to get slightly bored of the existing factions, but there are many more in the Steam Workshop.

My only criticisms of the game are as follows; Agents, which are player made ships that spawn into the game and severely ruin your day, are often too good and numerous when they first appear.  You could ignore them until stronger, however once you give them a foothold in the galaxy they are really hard to remove.  In addition, you reach the endgame of progression in terms of unlocking blocks and maximum ship size too soon, normally after a couple of hours.

All being told, an excellent buy.

I love space, spaceships, and I love games where there's something that lets my creativity run wild. Glad I found this gem!

This is a game where you control a single ship of faction you choose at the beginning of the game. You can customize it however you want it with the pieces the faction provides. Each faction is unique in a way and none are the same. You fly around, you shoot enemies, gather resources, unlock new modules, grow in power, build up your ship to become an unstoppable destroyer, unlock other factions to play as, and so on.

Of course you don't need to fly alone, you can build up your fleet, or hire pilots from your faction to join you and fly with it. You'll soon be able to conquer the entire galaxy. Also, the galaxy has a fair amount of 'agents', which are fleets that were made by other players. Most of the ones I've seen so far were pretty formidable so if you see a red arrow, you should run until you really feel confident you'll break their ships with ease. Oh, and if you're done playing in that one galaxy you started in? Use a wormhole to fly to another one! This will also upload your current fleet, and chances are, someone, somewhere, on planet Earth, will be soon encountering your very own fleet on their computer. And he'll probably have trouble destroying you.

What's truly beatiful about this game is how simple it looks, and how complex it actually is. You could actually consider this game some sort of art. You start in a tiny sector, and you can see pretty early on how dynamic the world is. The AI harvests the minerals, grows in size, expands, it gets better with you, and so on. For example, I once built a single ship that could build stations. I manufactured it from my flagship, kicked it from the fleet so it could be independent, and guess what. Soon enough, when I came back, there were like, 15 stations there, and a whole lot of tiny little fighter ships scuttling around. It was an awesome sight. To be honest, the game kinda looks more organic than scientific. It's like actual organisms battling against each other. Sort of.

Well, either way, if you like space, spaceships, and space battles, if you like being creative, if you like shooting stuff up, if you like seeing your ship grow from a super fast tickling drone to a slow, massive hulking beast of absolute annihilation, if you like sending your enemies to oblivion, then chances are you're going to appreciate this game.

The editor is a snap to do just about whatever you want to do. For example, you can copy your ship and stick the new one on the front of your original ship in less than 5 seconds if you're even halfway decent at using the keybindings. Another good thing is that you can change reassembly from a miminalistic game to a Tron-esque visual style, allowing you to run Reassembly on an old or new computer and use whatever RAM you have. And if you're STILL not convinced, it has mods, adding new factions with surprisingly well-written lore and enormous assortments of weapondry. Some even add entirely new block shapes (sounds unimpressive, but just try to build a functional spaceship out of pentagons) . Then there's the challenge faction mods, with oddly shaped blocks, low energy generation, and an array of other problems to deal with. Overall, Reassembly gets a 19/20. If you're on the fence about it, buy it on sale for the price of three chocolate bars. However, it's worth noting that it hasn't been updated in two years, and is probably not going to be updated again. Also, player fleets are hilariously broken, easily wiping out anything if built decently (read: with enough thrusters to move and a gun that isn't short-ranged) since they're either cheap enough to build an army, or powerful enough that only 3 or so annilate everything. And so far there aren't any  mods that buff enemies enough for them to stand up to fleets, though at that point fleets would be mandatory. Melee damage (only with blocks that boost it) is also quite powerful, but balanced somewhat in that having enough maneuverability to counter melee blocks' mass is difficult. There also isn't a good endgame, as by the time you've built up your ship to the default 8000P (ship power, used for adding functional blocks to your ship) you're usually strong enough to blast through almost every faction alone. And then only one more ship turns the middle sectors from challenging to simple, especially if you specialise it. Despite this, it's still a fantastic game, but about 40% of that is the excellent mods.

You enjoy building custom ships and pitting them in tournaments against other custom ships in AI vs AI matchups, much like Gratuitous Space Battles, but with far more detailed shipbuilding (and less ""gratutious price gouging""). To me, this is where the value of the game is at and where the vast majority of my invested time has gone.

So if you get the game, I suggest you play with it for an hour or two, ""Test"" your designs against other ships and then google for ""Reassembly forums"" and find the online community and therefore the tournaments. That will take you down an amusing road that you can indeed spend 100+ hours on, as I have. I really enjoy designing and testing ships.

People who should probably not buy this game:
Anyone looking for a long lasting, interesting single player experience that does not involve building ships for tournaments. While this game does have a roguelike(?) portion to it, and I suppose some people may get dozens of hours of enjoyment out of it, there's really not much to it. You fly around and ""conquer the galaxy"" but the mechanics of doing this basically involves flying around and shooting everything in your custom ship, which IS entertaining for a few hours, as you grow and tweak the design, but I felt that part got old fast. It's just not very interesting. Maybe if the galaxy had more actual strategy to it or an overarching metagame... I mostly just play as a faction enough to unlock all the parts and then go design ships for possible tournament play because the galactic battles seem so droll.

Still, I can't NOT recommend it considering I've put over 100 hours into a game that I think I pay $9 for. This game probably won't knock your socks off but it's neat and interesting and not a bad way to spend a few bucks if your interests are at all like mine.

Düsen muss man vorne anbauen um das schiff nach hinten fliegen zu lassen.

[h1]Actual Review (12/10/15):[/h1]
I've always had a soft spot for the build-your-own-spaceship genre. I enjoyed Captain Forever, Battleships Forever, Gimbal,  as well as Stardrive 2. I have no idea how I didn't find out about it until now. 

I think Reassembly takes the great construction and space combat elements of all those games and puts it in one solid package. I was surprised to see it run smoothly during heavy action (unlike Stardrive), In its category, the decent amount of gameplay depth and accessibility help make this one a top tier 2D-space-builder-shooter. Sure there's some things that need fixing (such as the tutorial checklist showing up every time a new game is started) but even so I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",1449794860,1493904508,True,28,17,0.672017157077789307,0,True,False,False,False,,,

И так в цикле, пока все не вымрут. Простейший пример процедурной генерации событий.
Так вот, если программиста вовремя не остановить, он скажет, что жизнь в клетке - это на самом деле наличие там кораблей, и если все корабли одной фракции, то эта клетка принадлежит такой фракции...

From adding whole factions, unique plant regions, or changing the base game variables, there are a variety of mods to choose from. 

As an occasional modder for the game, I can testify that the options presented in modding are quite limitless. Many of the existing prototype concepts from the modding community simply cannot be compared to the vanilla content.

To describe in a congruent and un over enthusiastic method the utter pleasure this game has given me, in the short time I have owned it, is a task that could seem impossible, considering the choices /decisions I made in regards to the approach to articulating my point of view, of which there is more than one, of course this is all about the subject of sharing the opinion that arises from the experiences obtained by the direct consequence of deciding to spend the time, and at the time allowing for the time necessary to seal from possibility to reality the chance of owning this potentially entertaining game. 

Well... I am sure we are ALL glad that so has happened

I appreciate your enthusiasm!!! Thank you

Here is a list of what you get for your hard earned money, a list for all those that hate tricky sentences  that are not actually in english but give the impression that they are so ....

YOU get your very own game developer... an eccentric young talented and apparently stubborn enough to create a game where the clean coding approach has lead it to being the most optimized solution possible allowing millions and trillions of things to happen at once inside your computer and then you can see the calculated outcomes on the big thing with a side made of glass that shines when used properly. Please feed your programmer regularly

YOU get a game with lots of colours that you can change as well, these colours come in different shapes that can be changed as well but not as much as the colours ... those can be changed lots more than the shapes can, please be cautious with your colours...be very cautious with your shapes those you are NOT allowed to mess around with. Disclaimer these features do NOT work if your monitor is Black and White, also you can do anything with your shapes just don't do so in a messy fashion unless you wish to do so deliberately in which case you should be fine 

YOU get access to all sources of knowledge that up until now have been unseen by the academic eye and you will learn to master navigating the many choices you make, this is very important cause when you want to make a noticeable mark in a tournament you may do so by designing a cool ship that looks better than the others thus winning the Sweet generous award, it's crazy stuff! please consult your local foot therapist and take in small amounts !!

YOU can finally find a good use for your mouse, and start not to use it! As the developer does not really trust your inexperienced eye to hand coordination he has made a game that you watch! You might as well give your mouse eyes and allow it to watch the game with you, the days of bashing that poor mouse is over. Disclaimer there is a mode where you use the mouse. There are many modes, but I wanted the poor mouse to have his/her moment too... 

YOU are still reading this review, and I adore you for doing so, I am lonely, Perhaps I should learn to communicate my feelings better, my resume is looking great but people seem to get confused? Oh well, this game is great and has some great communities of gamers and you tubers that organize events constantly for you to have fun and meet new people, among them is myself, and lots of other people that can write good

YOU can get a really trippy soundtrack
and don't forget to look both ways before you cross or just follow a friend that is already crossing.

The basic building blocks are two-dimensional shapes (guns, hull blocks, engines, and so on,) which are a joy to connect and shape into fighters, freighters, capital ships and stations. As the player becomes more experienced, new shapes unlock, leading to some truly impressive creations. What's more, the fleets that other players have made are imported onto the map as 'Agents', meaning that, in addition to the various types of standard enemies, the player has to go up against the creations of fellow players - controlled by the AI, but built by humans. Some of the are quite brilliant.

Unlocking the most expensive pieces can be a grind, and the game doesn't tutorialise nearly as well as it should (there is a fair bit of advice online), but after many hours I still find plenty to keep me busy.

(Nachtrag vom 05. August 2021: immernoch großartig :) )

### Worum geht es? ###
Das Spielprinzip ist einfach erklärt. Raumschiffe bauen, Raum erobern, Ressourcen einsammeln, größere Raumschiffe bauen. So weit so gut, einfache Sache. Der Trick bei der Sache ist: Für den Bau seines Raumschiffs benötige man Ressourcen, die im Raum auftauchen bzw. die auch bei der Zerstörung von Schiffen anderer Fraktionen anfallen. Größere Raumschiffe verbrauchen mehr Ressourcen. Aber: viele kleine Raumschiffe können ein großes Raumschiff überwältigen. Also ein kleineres, wendigeres Raumschiff bauen? Ausprobieren, denn es kostet nichts. Und: bei Beschädigung wachsen die kaputten Bauteile einfach nach.

### Flotte! ###
Ab einer bestimmten Größe ist es möglich, im Spielerschiff eine Schiffswerft zu bauen und selbst Schiffe zu spawnen. Den ultimativen Status hat man erreicht, wenn man Schiffe spawnen kann, die selbst wieder Schiffe spawnen können. So folgen einem die eigenen Kinder durch den Raum, sammeln Ressourcen und bekommen selbst Kinder. Die Flotte wächst selbstständig.

### Wurmlöcher ###
Das absolute Highlight ist jedoch, dass genau diese selbstreproduzierenden Flotten (also quasi ein lebendiger Schwarm) eines anderen Spielers(!) durch eine Wurmloch kommen können um Deiner Flotte Konkurrenz zu machen. Natürlich steuert da kein Spieler aktiv eines der Schiffe, aber die Schiffstypen der Flotte sind alle im Editor den anderen Spielers entstanden. So spielen weltweit Flotten gegeneinander, deren Erschaffer nicht mal selbst online sein müssen.

### Fazit ###
Das Spiel ist für Daddelfreunde mit Kreativität gedacht, die immer etwas zu optimieren haben. Sehr empfehlenswert.",1446062395,1628167762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I helped back it in it's early alpha days, giving its kickstarter my $30 donation. I liked the look of it. Sandboxish, procedural generation, top-down arcade feel. I played the very early alpha version and was entertained for a few hours. I soon lost interest, and the game became stale to me.

Since then I've come back to the game again and again. It's one of those games you'll get pumped about and think about all day only to come home from work and play it till you drop. It's enjoyment for me comes in short bursts.

Recently I've made a discovery. The game does not play itself. People complain about how tedious it is to capture systems and hold them. They say something along the lines of ""Once you capture it there is no point. Your ships don't spawn there and you get no resources."" Now listen here, that is where you are wrong.

You can build space stations that bristle with defenses and hold their own agains enemy capital ships. Alternatively, that space station can be covered in solar arrays to slowly farm you resources. Recently one of my favorite things to do is populate enemy territory with little ""Outpost"" stations via a factory on one of my ships. I then spend time fighting on the front line with my fleet to push the enemy out. This game is all about how you play it.

In summary, Reassembly is a great game. It's hard to find anything else out there even close to it (I think of S.P.A.Z. as the only other game that resembles it, another great by the way).

Es ist jeden Euro wert! Man startet mit den Terranern, kann im Verlauf aber noch mehr Rassen freispielen - die sich in Waffen und ""Hüllen""-Teilen unterscheiden. Dann spawnt man und sieht zu erstmal zu überleben. 

Man nimmt Stationen ein und verdient damit seine ersten Credits, die man in ""Masse""-Upgrades oder in die Freischaltung von Waffen/Supports stecken kann. Die masse sagt aus, wie viele Teile ich im Editor in mein Schiff stecken kann. 

Wenn man erst mal die Obergrenze von 8 000 Masse geschafft und alle Waffen freigeschaltet hat, dann kann man sich so richtig austoben. Im Editor ein mächtiges Schiff erstellt und dann noch ein paar Jäger, Bomber und Fregatten - die man mit Hangar sogar selbst spawnen kann.

 Ab und an fühlt man sich übermächtig, allerdings sind die Agenten (rote Pfeile auf der Karte) nicht zu unterschätzen. Das sind Kreationen von anderen Spielern, die zum Teil echt fies sind.

Different factions offer different tools and weapons, as well as entire ship-structuring features.
The open-ended gameplay means that once you've got a ship that works, you can make other ships that make more ships. build stations to protect areas of space you have cleared and hunt down other players' designs that are loaded into your world throguh wormholes (and allow you to send your ships off as AI enemies to terrorise other players in their games)

Yes, designing the ships is fun, and testing them is fun, and the big battles are fun. However, the fun runs out quickly and there are UI issues which pretty much kill any real possibility of sinking a significant amount of time into the game due to the repetition and frustration involved.

The User Interface has a very ""Early Access"" feel to it. At one point after purchasing I came back to the Steam store page expecting to see an Early Access tag that I had overlooked.

At first, UI clunkiness seemed like a small problem. I liked the game. I was having fun gathering resources, turning them in, and using the cash flow to buy new techs and to make my ships bigger. Eventually I unlocked the factory, and my ships were large enough to use it. At this phase of the game you think ""Cool, now I can make fleets of ships and kick even more ass!""

And you can, but putting a fleet together and keeping it up and running through numerous battles is just such a fucking chore. It feels like work.

It would be so much better if you could configure the way your factory makes ships. Here's how it works:  you move up to 4 ship designs into boxes at the top of the fleet screen. These designs will be built by your ship's factory when you press 'F' in-game.

The issue is that pressing 'F' builds the first ship in the queue, then the second, and so on, repeating in order and there's no way to change this. For example, you can't set up four keybindings for the 4 designs.

Occasionally you can win a few big battles without changing your production queue, but more often than not you find yourself going back to the fleet screen over and over again to rearrange your build order. This is my primary complaint about the game. I might have reccommended this game and played it for months if I weren't forced to return to the awful fleet screen hundreds upon hundreds of times, simply because the developer only gave us one terrible way to build support ships.

This problem is only amplified if you decide you want to design and build some space stations. Building stations seems to be the only way to hold new areas you've moved into. If you move to an area of the map and clear out all the bad guys it will change to your faction's color, but the only way it will stay your color when you leave is if there is a station left behind which can spawn AI ships to patrol the area. So, basically, building stations is important if you want to conquer the map.

The problem is, there are good and bad places to create a station. The 4-ship repeating production queue gives you no easy way to be careful about your space station placement. If you want to be strategic, you have no choice but to go to the stinking, godforsaken fleet screen and drop a space station design into your production queue each time you find a good site where you want to lay down a new station. You'll have to make sure you drop it in the right place in the queue or it won't be next. After you've built the station and set up ITS production queue, you will have to return to your OWN production queue, delete the station, and replace it with another design.

In an area with a ton of drones? Fleet screen. Found enemy agents with large ships? Fleet screen. Is one particular type of your support ships taking heavy losses? Fleet screen. Hey, this is a great spot for a station. Fleet Screen.

So, the UI is bad. I should probably change gears: There's simply not much to do in this game once you've optimized all of your designs and you've assembled a nice fleet of ships. Once you can build full-sized ships, you will steamroll anything and everything with no surprises and no challenges to keep your interest. I was intrigued by all the talk of a huge, dynamic galaxy to conquer but the reality is that the endgame is just one-sided, imbalanced action and little else. 

The map is terrible. It's hideous. It's a super-chunky grid with different colors to represent factions. The result is very ugly, and gets more and more atrocious the more you explore. You can't zoom or scroll the map, and you can't change or hide the overlays. The minimap in-game is just as bad. It's hard to see useful information, and you can make it either small or smaller.

There are other issues as well. The AI is not that great. This is really an issue when you spawn 10 support ships and pray to god that they don't cause a pileup and all get left behind in an asteroid field. This will happen even with small ships that are the most maneuverable craft in the game. Yes, your fleet that you saved up resources to build can easily get left behind on a high speed trip because they are truly terrible at avoiding stationary objects.

Also, ships get stuck together all the time while they are ""rebuilding"" themselves after taking damage, or right after they spawn from your factory on your main ship. It's laughable, as the two ships are merged and the AI ship is using all of its thrusters trying to go somewhere making it impossible to go where you are trying to go.

So all-in-all this feels like a half-finished Early Access title with potential. Unfortunately it's a finished game.

Summary: Game feels half-completed. Good ship designing, good action, VERY BAD  interface, nothing rewarding to do after unlocking all the parts and build points.",1442249908,1450492934,False,50,4,0.578366637229919434,5,True,False,False,False,,,

I'm not the typical target audience for such a game and thus those who are will proabably not find this review helpful. I also know I'm in the minority on this game. Reassembly has a 94% approval rating. I'm in that 6%.

Given that approval rating it means that it is the player and not the game. It's probably done well but it is simply not my style of game. I find the controls confusing, the objectives unclear or poorly explained and I have no Earthly idea what is going on. If there is a deeper game here than running around and firing a weapon at targets that move too quickly to be hit, I haven't found it and the game isn't inspiring enough to make me want to look for it. 

Come again, Blackadar? What does that mean? Ok, simply put I can't tell what's going on. I see blobs and shapes on screen. It has an art style that just doesn't register with me. I feel like I'm looking at a Jackson Pollock painting in hyper-motion. While I like Jackson Pollock, I don't exactly understand what I'm looking at when I look at that art. I don't understand what I'm looking at when I look at the screen on Reassembly. Now when I combine that with things moving so quickly on screent that I can't hit them, my gameplay options kind of narrow quickly.

Actually, they narrow into one thing - uninstall and go find a game I can play. Like Peggle. Or Uno. (it's a joke people, check my profile!)

I guess my ability to effectively control a twin-stick shooter in an abstract art style game is nonexistent.

Dies ist meine erste Review:
Ich bin mittlerweile bei rund 80 Spielstunden angelangt. Das Spiel hat einen ganz eigenen Spielstil und eine ganz eigene Atmospähre. Es macht mir sehr viel Spass meiner ""Fraktion"" beim wachsen zuzuschauen und zu sehen wie sie sich von anfangs kleinen schiffen zu großen Kreuzern weiterentwickelt. Ich verbringe die meiste Zeit im Schiffseditor meiner Lieblingsfraktion und tüftle an neuen waffen und hüllen kombinationen rum. Der Vielfalt sein Schiff zu gestalten ist kaum eine grenze gesetzt. Mittlerweile habe ich alle Fraktionen angetestet und auf das Maximum an Punkten gebracht, aber noch nicht jede Waffe der jeweiligen Fraktion freigesschaltet. Im Tournament Modus lasse ich nun öfters meine eigenen Schiffe der unterschiedlichen Fraktionen gegeneinander antreten um zu sehen wie man sich auskontern könnte und wie sich die KI verhält. Im Tournament modus werden beide Parteien von dem Computer gesteuert. Mit dem letzten Update kam hinzu das man anstatt einzelner Schiffe nun ganze Flotten gegeneinander antreten lassen kann. 

Für mich hat dieses Spiel einen sehr hohen Wiederspielwert und lässt sich auch nach der Arbeit ganz locker noch spielen und sorgt für regelrechte Entspannung. Es gäbe noch genügend zu berichten über zB den Workshop und den Spielablauf im Einzelspieler, aber für meine erste Review sollte das ausreichen.

Wer einen leidenschaftlichen Reassambly Spieler auf YT zuschauen möchte sollte sich mal den Kanal ""Deluks Gaming"" anschauen.

If you enjoy ship builder games this game has a decent amount of options to do so. However, if you like in depth ship builders, Reassembly isn't a complex ship building simulator.

Essentially the game amounts to getting resources, selling resources, and building bigger ships. There is an ""Agent"" mechanic which spawns other player made groups into your galaxy. Many of these squadrons will crush you until you can get to the very end game. These squadrons are really the only threat when you're powerful enough, so you either can leave them on and be demolished repeatedly until the end game, or turn them off and have a very boring end game.

It doesn't take long to get to the end game, and it's easy to run out of stuff to do. The best way to fight is to stack on piles of armor (it has no point value, so you can have as much as you'd like depending on how slow you don't mind your ship to be) and piling on a ton of a single effective weapon (most races have one or two weapons that are extremely effective, and a pile of flavor weapons which are functional against the standard ships, but not overly so against agents).

I enjoy the fact that you can have your own little posse follow you around by putting a factory on your ship. You can even put factories on the ships you make so that they can make their own ships. This seems to need a bit more polish though as this doesn't seem to happen as much as it should. 

Also every ""faction"" including yours doesn't really do much other than sit around and shoot the breeze. It would be nice if they were more active. There are agents that can hunt you down and are very powerful, though. So that can add some suspense.

Pros:
+++ Editing EVERY part of your ship (Weapons, Armor, everything);

++ Nice gameplay;
++ Almost never crashes;
+ Graphics are nice, colors too;
+ Nice sounds.

Cons:

- Music, I got annoyed and turned off. (Maybe adding more songs?)

Even now, after I know it's a space game, it still has that organic look.

This is a great game. It runs very well on an older laptop, and when things get too intense with the graphics, the program simply steps down speed rather than crashes. The design interface for the ship editor is very well done and you can zoom in and out. It has a lot of things you can use, but just enough so you do not get overwhelmed from too much inventory to choose from.

Piloting your ships is a little tricky, since it involves the cursor and the keyboard and even then you have settings to choose from. My best analogy of piloting a ship in Reassembly is like riding a horse, where you use rein to control the speed and steer your steed.

The conquer the universe mode is pretty straightforward and you got lots of time to build up resource. The tutorial helps you get things rolling though I was hoping for more, like for example what exactly am I scooping off these asteroids? To date, I've never been wiped off the map for being too slow. If you beat an agent, you unlock a faction to play.

THe sandbox mode? Okay, that's the first real negative on this game. I'm old enough to have played games that involved you using complex commands in a text editor  to create the scenerio before the game began, so let me tell you I've never seen a sandbox mode that involved command language since the 1980s. This would have been acceptable for the 1980s but this is the 21st century, and most computer users are not programmers. They would expect an Activision-esque style of interface where you select number of players, difficulty level, type of victory scenerio and so on. AFter seeing a dazzling UI, asking the user to create a sandbox match using command line languages gives this game a unfinished look. It's not a deal breaker. I got more than my money's worth out of it, but I would have loved to see what the sandbox mode was like.

My verdict? Worth it, lot of replayability value and you will have hours of fun designing things and watching them go blooey. Just skip the sandbox mode.",1441172416,1441172579,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You might describe it as a mish-mash of SPAZ, Spore, and some other top-down space shooters, but the similarity ends there.  The procedurally generated 'galaxy' is full of varied enemies and dangers, and if you run out of baddies, you can dive into a wormhole for a fresh world.  Wormholes have another use, more on that below.

The main draw of the game though is the ability to build your own ships.  The ship editor is easy to learn, and has enough geometric shapes to allow you to produce anything you want.  The playable factions have different available hull and weapon choices, making each one it's own playstyle.  There is a progression curve, you must spend money earned in the world to unlock new weapons and increase the power cap limiting how much goes on your ship.  It doesn't take too long to max it out though, allowing for huge many-beweaponed designs.  You can also build space stations, it's as simple as building something with no thrusters and at least one factory.

Once you have some custom ships you like, hit up a wormhole.  Instead of following it to a new world, you can choose to upload a copy of your fleet roster while staying in your own world.  This uploaded fleet will then start randomly appearing in other players worlds.  These are called Agent fleets, and fighting other people's creations that appear in your world can be challenging and exciting.  I've encountered ships that were nearly unbeatable, forcing me to change my ships and tactics in order to prevail.

You needn't fly solo in your world either, you can equip a factory block and spend resources you collect to spawn AI controlled ships from your collection.  I'm not sure if there's a limit to how many ships you can have at once, I've gotten up to about 15 or so, plus a hundred or so drones if I'm in my Galactica carrier.  Tearing around space with a dozen ships blasting anything you target is super effective.

A caveat to mention is that there isn't any actual multiplayer, which would be great if it were possible, I can see why it would be difficult with all the physics objects that can occur.  Maybe a sequel could pull it off.  Also there are situations that cause the game to slow down significantly, particularly in Spikey Plant sectors once they start firing projectiles all over the place.

Many games out there let you build things, which is fine, but this is one of the few that lets you use and enjoy the fruits of your labor in actual gameplay.  The vector-style graphics are used to good effect and really get my nostalgia going.  I've only owned the game a couple weeks and have dumped almost 50 hours into it.  It's got good music too.

Вы когда-нибудь задавались вопросом, каким деpьмом люди занимаются в этой жизни? Вот я, к примеру, нет. Для меня это стало решающим фактором для покупки этой ШЕДЕВРАЛЬНОЙ игры. Reassembly плевать на всё: её не интересует как тебя зовут, сколько тебе лет, и чем ты вообще по жизни маешься - Просто летай по космосу, и строй долбаные корабли! Any questions?

Что же, это одна из причин, по которой я купил эту игру. Редактор прост, глубок и уникален как квадрат Малевича - меньше графона, больше двадэшности. Можно еще обдалбаться чем-нибудь, но это уже совсем другая история.

i am a strategy/survival/creative game lover. I like games like minecraft, terraria.  I personally don't like fps or space shooter games which looks like this one.

I pick this game to try couse it was offering that u can create your own space ships.  I saw that not only you create your own vessel but you create an echosystem actually. In this game everything acts like living beings they grow, they sperad and claim territories. You are the lader of the echosystem. You design how your faction will do acually by altering the designs. Game AI uses your designs if you have suitable one for a stuation.  If you don't, they have their own designs. Your resource also a space plant which is growing spreading around like your faction.

You start with a pre-designed faction with its own unique blocks and weapons. Simply you gather resources and grow to be better, stronger and dominate a huge map which is infinite like with its wormholes. You design your own ships with limited blocks at start and vary them by researching more which gives you like infinite combinations. Game also helps you with this by its pre designed ships.

i strongly reccomend this game if you define yourself like me

You collect food called R(esource) and trade it for C(redits) to unlock new ship parts and raise your point allowance to stick more guns and thrusters to your ships body.

Damage taken is reflected on your ships, parts are removed and will regrow fairly quickly. Half your thrusters missing on one side of your ship? Have fun trying to escape without smacking right into the next obstacle. If you command block is destroyed you respawn at the nearest factory station or ship, while losing all R. No big deal, chances are you randomly crash you ship into the next asteroid at least a couple of times.

You expand territory for you faction by activating space stations and feeding them resources. Once you unlock the factory block you can start building your own fleet with your own designs, and even pop out your own stations. Massively fun for a bit but it's really a one trick pony. 

The good
[*]Controls are good, even though you can build clunky ships.
[*]Ship Designs are fun and designing your own fleets is quite neat.
[*]Lots of ship designs from user generated content, also workshop support now.
[*]The Organic world with it feeding and growing cycle is sweet, even if only rudimentary.
[*]Offer  at least 6-7 hours of [u]good[/u] fun. More if you enjoy the editor, optimizing fleets and trying out the different races. I doubt we see much more support from the dev that adds more replyability, but you never know.


The bad
[*]Controller support isn't complete, feels like 80% is there and the rest just never got done.
[*]Tutorial is a joke, it just checks for input and a couple of conditions, I accidently skipped almost half of it in the first 3 seconds. At the very list it needs to disable other inputs and walk you though it step by step.
[*]Simple block ship designs tend to do better than fancy. Wrong incentive.
[*]Editor has a snap function for connecting parts, nice but it only works 50% of the time making it almost useless.
[*]Some ship design are rather clunky and the AI does a good job of smashing into every solid body, Funny the first two times but it does get old really fast after that.
[*]Low replayability, the simulation aspect of the world isn't really complex enough to allow for new situations to arise.

对于新人的建议！
人族的能力很平均！你可以理解为没人操作就中下的战斗力，有人就是高端战力！（尼玛！这不废话么！）
前期可以导弹风筝流！出生点旁边一般不会出现高端战力的种族，
一般是放牧者、叮当和红族（选这个弱鸡的种族的话就是地狱模式！），
红族是导弹流的ATM，
AI操作下的放牧者放就是ATM，因为不会种地O(∩_∩)O~
叮当这个是个大炮种族！与其友斗就行！（站桩打叮当等于自杀！<(￣︶￣)↗）
基本是这些都对你没啥危险的时候你应该早碰到过水晶、蜂群、病毒植物（在这个是无尽的导弹海洋里！这个应该记忆深刻！）
水晶装甲非常硬！但还是有药可救的，人族与其硬钢那是厕所里点灯！打这个种族最好是脉冲激光！别用导弹！那没什么用，运气好一波就秒，没事别去这个种族瞎逛！没有舰队你是玩不起无双的==、
蜂群速度犹如魅影，拥有全游戏最强大的推进器和最强大的近战DPS！人族装甲在这个种族面前，不说不堪一击嘛，那也是相当脆的。所以和这个种族打最好的办法就是保持距离！然后全舰开火！在其跑到你面前的时候至少打掉武器！
病毒植物种族是不可选种族！扩展非常快！只有光束和导弹武器，外带一个卖萌？的刺！在这个区域行走是考验你电脑显卡的时候了！也是就显卡不好别去了==、因为进去就是铺天盖地的导弹海啊！
苍蝇是不可选种族！会瞬移！对人族危险为零点一！因为他们只有很小的船几个组件！至于为啥是点一，那是一场美丽的意外！我在穿过其种族领地的时候，看他们对我开火，完全不痛不痒，但是烦啊对吧！于是就开火想清理了，结果这一开火就引火上身了，他居然瞬移到我核心这个来了个自杀袭击T^T.....
基本都说完了，再说两个特别种族！一个可选，一个不可选，
可选的是哨兵族！这个种族异常奇葩！种族科技树不晓得是咋的！非常极端！拥有全游戏最强大的激光炮台！拥有全游戏最强大的导弹！不对！那个叫核弹==、拥有全游戏最坚硬的装甲！拥有全游戏最弱小的推进器！（呵呵...）人族打法多种多样，不过都必须保证，你有足够强的防空火力！必要时用主炮防空！随时保持距离！保持机动！最好是达到你最远射程边缘！慢慢磨（最稳妥的打法）。原因经常是你在用高速小飞机探索地图的时候，一道光束闪过，然后你就回去重组了==、要么就是看见个大号的导弹（核弹），当你发现的时候来不及转向，来不及加速！防空火力不足！然后就放烟花了！你回去重组==、不外乎这两种死法。对了，人族固定器是可以固定住导弹的哦！
不可选的是选手族！这个种族是全游戏最扯淡的种族！除了种族特性武器外！该有的武器都有！在游戏你你看见设计很好看，或者设计很奇葩，而且颜色很显眼的就这个种族了！这个种族战斗力不定！有时候比你初始飞船还小的船经常秒你千P的。总之小心就行！

Then you'll get to spawn, spawners following you and getting that fleet bigger and bigger.
The reassembly mecanics also adds a great gameplay element. You'll often try to escape ennemy fire so you reassemble before blowing up.
I love the score too, it's the kind of music I don't feel like muting it.

The interface is counterintuitive at times, but it's almost top notch. There are some glitches and some elements are obscure, for instance, assigning ships to spawners and the mecanic of it all.

You begin with a rather small spacecraft and start your journey mining resources.
As you collect resources and trade them for money wich will be used to upgade you ship's power or add new pieces for your ship, you will explore a beautiful enviorement and face other factions throughout space.
At a certain point you will be able to build your own ships and spawn them yourself
*THIS IS WHERE IT GETS ADDICTIVE FOR ME*
As you soon will discover, the ships you built and spawned will follow you and defend you, even collect resources for you. 
You will have your own armada of ships and they are all fully costumizable! Like in, you build them from scratch till you and only you are satisfied with its looks.

So basicly whats good about the game:
-customize your own fleet.
-Nice environment
-Have your own armada
-game controls ( I play with keyboard and mouse)
-Grafix ( if you're into this kind of old school 2-d spacebattle-thingies)

Some things did bother me:
-No multiplayer (-You do have a sort of multiplayer as in sending your fleet to a friend (separate file) wich he can import in game and have an AI fight with. And there is a thing called agents wich are playermade ships who spawn in your map to haunt you.)
-No control over spawned ships. In command mode you can sell or buy allied ships but you cannot control them as in sending them in a direction, generally the spawned ships will follow you and defend you at their best ( wich is up to you on how you build them ;) )

I just bought this game today but I've already had my share of experiences. The tutorial was a bit meh but after I got to the point where I could start exploring, the world opened up to me.

The mind wanders just you yourself wander, trying to infer whatever you can about this colorful, geometric universe. 

The combat is good and the physics behind movement take a bit of getting used to. This game isn't as much about that, though. It's all about building your perfect modular ship. Currently I am rocking a missile dreadnaught, though it has a few weaknesses. There is no *best* kind of ship in the game.

I would highly reccomend this game, and would urge anyone to buy it even if it's not on sale.

I don't usually write reviews, so please excuse the brevity, and rest assured that I do not flippantly say this:

[b]I wholeheartedly recommend this game.[/b]


[h1]Slightly longer version[/h1]
I got this game during a Humble Bundle sale (still ongoing, as of 2015-08-17), which was the first time I had ever heard about it. So, basically, I installed this game out of idle curiosity. The following are my impressions from playing it for a couple of hours. If you want to know more about what this game actually IS, I recommend reading some other reviews, or watching a video or two.

[b]Pro:[/b] It is really fun. Fly, shoot, collect resources, build, shoot some more, re-build from scratch, collect more resources, fly and shoot even more. For me, this game fills a gap I did not know I needed filled, somewhere between StarBound/Terraria (for the block-like, 2D assembly of things) and Space Engineers (for finding yourself trying to build something you couldn't even imagine when you started playing), but actually nothing like either.

[b]Pro:[/b] Pretty clever take on what you might call ""asynchronous multiplayer"" -- while playing, you can upload your current ship (or fleet) at wormholes, which then turn up in other player's games (controlled by the AI). Conversely, so called ""Agents"" lead incursions into your game, using ship designs made by other players. Personally, I enjoy imagining that my creations might be a challenge to someone else... Well, I can dream, at least :D

[b]Con:[/b] The UI is a bit rough around the edges; prepare for fixed-width font tutorials and rather simple UI elements. But really, it does not detract much from the fun -- you more or less don't notice after some time.

[b]YMMV:[/b] If you do not enjoy building stuff and trying the same things in different ways, this game might not hold your interest for long. However, if you DO enjoy building and trying out things, definitely give this game a try.",1439845664,1439845664,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,False,False,False,False,,,

At first I was a little skeptical over the price, but I'd say I got plenty of enjoyment and my money's worth. I very, very reccomend this game.

This is one of those ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" games. At least for the first few hours. There is so much variety in just the starting faction's arsenal that you'll spend plenty of time exploring your strengths and weaknesses. Then, over time you'll create the perfect vessel, one that is a Jack of All Trades or a Master in a specific area. But it doesn't stop there. You can build a factory on your ship, and then spawn other ships you've made to help you fight. (Assuming you've got the resources) Then, those ships can have factories too.

Another great feature is how both friend and foe alike will utilize battlefield debries to improve their armor or weapons.

 I like to play as a huge mother ship that is good at crowd control and sniping. So I make my ship's factory produce micro vessles I made, that pack a lot of fire power and speed at a cheap price. I even made a version that has it's own shields. They only cost about 300 RP, which means I can crank them out like nothing. I actually felt a sense of pride when  I saw them descend upon the Bee faction and absolutely wrecked them. They would gang up, six to one, and blast them to pieces. Hell, I had so many of these drones that they'd just crash into their ships at insane speads, cleaving off parts. I was prouder still, when I saw my lil guys loot their victim's shield module and use it. So they had the yellow shields of their enemies and my blue shields. :') Papa is proud.

I don't say this game is bad, but at the same time it does not have the ammount of content for a price above 5 bucks, or rather even less.

Yes, the the enemies act like they are in an ecosystem, and it works brilliantly. It feels brilliant. But your units usually act like... meh... and in that context you... with your unbalanced defenceless ships... Against those brilliant, sometimes upfront indestructable, like the battle wagon... you are slowly but steadily climbing through every part of the galaxy, untill dominating everything in it. Maybe it's just me, but the game does not make me want to evolve, it just makes me try to put as much guns as possible and ram the flagships untill the enemy is gone. With that in mind, prety much every chalenge can be completed in this way.

Seeing cool ships with super damaging front horns, slicing meteors like they are made from cheese, really upsets me. I want that too, but when i try armored blocks, they usually just fall appart while i turn near a rock.

Controls are unsatisfying. i died a ton of times from my ship pressing against a wall and trying to turn, crushing through all of the ship and destroying the core. There should be a version of ""x"" that golds ship from turning aswell, if you dont have static turrets.

Is it just me or are the other factions just broken? Bee's weapons are kinda too uncontrollable. Other, start of the game is impossible at all. Farmer really needs a nerf with all the solar pannels, because i just modded my ship  and idled just untill i had 8000p, and the farmer's aurocannons are really kinda useless, Even tons of them still break my heart. then they fire. most useless showerhead ever.

Koupil jsem to v rámci Humble Bundle balčíku za 10 americkejch vočí a prakticky nic od toho neočekával. Prej ""stavěcí 2D střílečka"", no to bude zase píčovina řekl jsem si. ""Ale snad to bude alespoň něco jako Asteroidy..."" hra, kterou mnozí z vás už ani neznají, kde trojúhelník střílel mínusy po asteroidech který na něj nalítávaly a drtil je na menší a menší, až je vaporizoval zcela.

Tak tohle přesně Reassembly (RA) NENÍ. :D Je to gameska, ve které začínáš jako pilot čehosi, co by se dalo nazvat dvěma trojúhelníky s motorama, spojenýma kokpitem. No - start je zajímavej, protože netušíš která bije a tak s tou malou tragédií lítáš a střílíš a sbíráš nějaký Céčka a Rka a přijdeš si jak na konci osumdesátek. ;)

Jenže pak pochopíš - aha, ono se tady dá přidělat tohle a tamto... A tady ještě tohle... A najednou zjistíš, že si celou tu loď se kterou můžeš lítat můžeš postavit NAPROSTO svobodně, pouze podle zákonů fyziky, dá-li se o něčem takovým ve 2D mluvit. 

Zkrátka pokud budeš mít loď velikosti našeho měsíce a na tom přidělanou vrtuli na šlapací pohon, tak se zhruba asi tak přibližně o nic za miliardu let. :) Všechno něco stojí, máš stavební limit (který si můžeš upgradovat a zvedat) a je to vlastně 2D Kerbal Space Program - akorát s tím rozdílem, že tady jsou zbraně. 

Hodně zbraní.

Né zase bůhví jak moc, aby se v tom člověk ztrácel, ale tak akorát, abys měl nad čím špekulovat, jak protivníky nejlépe hladit, hladit až vyhladit. Stavební a pokus-omylní faktor této hry je obrovská zábava, ale není to úplně samoúčelné.

Pamatuješ na Homeworld nebo na Sins of a Solar Empire? Na mocný stanice, obrovský flotily lodí, od malejch mrdek až po megafalusy, který na orbitu planety vyvolají věčné zatmění slunce, malá místní zemětřesení a kalhoty-hnojící efekt u místních domorodců? 
Tak to tady, ve vektorové grafice je taky. Bitvy tady umí být tak šílené, že se mi to na monitoru honí jako kdybych koukal mikroskopem na litr sloního ejakulátu, FPS mi (v režimu bez omezovače) spadnou ze 680 FPS na pouhých 200 FPS, grafika řekne ""kuš"", odplivne si a pokřižuje se. 

Takovéhle bitvy samozřejmě nezažiješ naštěstí hned ze startu, hra na tebe jde pomalu, i když... VŽDYCKY když už si myslíš, že jsi mistr Galaxie a že tě nic nepřekvapí, protože máš flotilu 70 lodí a masakr mateřskou loď, tak přijde nějakej blbec kterej to neví a rozseká tě. A všechny co máš s sebou a všechny co jsou vám podobný.

V praxi to vypadá tak, že nepřátelé se přizpůsobují tvým lodím a taktice a tím pádem totéž musíš dělat ty. Někdy se stačí přizpůsobit taktikou, někdy je potřeba ""refitovat"" lodě, ale pokaždý je zábava vymýšlet, jak na to. :)

Závěrem bych to shrnul tak, že tahle na první pohled primitivní vektorovka má vysoce zábavnej faktor a je to jedna z těch her, kde na grafice hratelnost a zábava ani nestojí, ani nepadá. :)",1439562723,1439562723,True,11,8,0.679863870143890381,0,False,False,False,False,,,

There are quite a few unique factions to unlock and build with that are all pretty fun to play as with their own special weapon types and building blocks. 

Although I full heartedly reccommend this game I think it's important point out some gripes.

End Game Is kinda boring
-Reassembly is one of those games where you become so powerful that there simply isn't strong enough competition to personally test your work of art against. There are some fleets you can battle that can be difficult but often times they can be really easy.

Faction Economy and territyory system isn't fleshed out
-Gaining and losing territory seems very ambiguous and pointless beyond %100 conquering the map, which is tedious and time consuming. There doesn't seem to be any benefit of having territory. You're supposed to give resources to ship building factories that will then go out and gain territory, but this is kind of un-engaging past bringing the materials in. 
-There aren't really any ""capital"" territories that faction forces are strongest at. Having these would bring in some depth to the world, adding difficulty and strategy to your campaign. Attack the capital of a faction and cripple it's economy so it can't reinforce other territories as easily. Some factions have cargo ships that don't really do anything but get killed by you for some free money. Giving them something to do that has benifits would be amazing for this game.

Beyond anything I've mentioned the game is a great time! If you're even slightly considering picking this up, do it! Especially if it's on sale.",1438830995,1438831089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's based around the concept of being able to both design and pilot a ship to conquer the galaxy with (perhaps with the help of your homegrown fleet). There are tons of options/possibilities, and that's incredibly exciting.

TL;DR-Amazing game, would be the best game ever created if it weren't for the disgusting pile of bugs/glitches.

There are a lot of reasons I would recommend this game despite the issues I'll comment on farther down.
-When you get hit somewhere your health bar doesn't drop, you lose that part of your ship. Your thrusters got blown off and your only weapon faces forward? Sucks.
-Every faction truly plays differently. It's not a game of ""What weapons am I gonna rambo with this time?"" It's more like ""These are my options, now what am I going to do with them?""
-The physics are great and really consider a lot of important factors such as center of mass and thruster location.
-The music is astounding. Gives a nice space-y feel and also compliments the actual gameplay quite well.
-Buildup from small to large ships doesn't feel grind-y and boring. It's just a different phase of the game, where instead of taking on giant death machines you go around activating stations and collecting resources from easier sources.
-Ships made by other players spawn in your world, so you get a lot of variety.
-The graphics are great. Frankly, I'm sick of repeated textures and copied/pasted environments. The basis on particles makes each game experience unique both visually and in regards to gameplay.


However, this game feels like it never left alpha/beta phase. There are insane numbers of holes in regards to instructions/development. A minor example (that still bugs me quite a bit) is part tool-tipping. Many have descriptions while even more have no real explanation whatsoever.  The number of typos is also embarrassing.
The number of general options is also a joke. Why do I have to turn autozoom off every time I start the game? And why do I have to deal with that stupid tutorial every time I start a new file? There's no skip option! And don't even get me started on those quests that never go away (why should I have to minimize the HUD just to sweep the pathetic tutorial under the rug?)

The biggest issue has got to be the bugs, though. So. Many. Bugs.
-The game crashes frequently during ship construction or even just flying around. Or sometimes it will freeze for 2 or 3 minutes just 'cause.
-Sometimes I catch allied ships desperately trying to kill themselves on asteroids. I mean, just slamming into them and then keeping thrusters full speed ahead until they finally explode.
-Sometimes the above happens to me and gives me no control over it. Even if I'm holding ""X"" to stop the freaking ship.
-Lag lag lag. I know this is a particle-based game, but come on. Going through Spiky Plant territory means sending the game into slow motion (about 1/2 time, maybe slower).
-Weird glitches regarding exploring. Sometimes my territory goes from my ownership to ""unexplored"" or no-ownership unexpectedly. Even if I'm sitting in the middle of that territory with a few stations and a fleet of 50 ships. There are other similar glitches, such as arrows pointing to stations that don't exist.
-Lots of glitchiness surrounding drones/missiles. Particularly during ship construction. Sometimes the parts just do really weird things like spawn a missile inside of the ship, which leads to all kinds of glitchiness. I once had a ship I was working on explode into a few pieces IN THE EDITOR because of a stray missile.

There are a few non-bug-related issues with the game IMO, but those are actually pretty minor. Compared to the bug issues, I often forget they're even issues at all.
I could go on and on about all the glitches in this game. It's insane and needs to be addressed more immediately. I love this game for the ideas/concepts and gameplay. It's really fun and has a lot of awesome mechanics. The brilliance and creativity that went into making this work of art are just enough to overlook the pile of crap that is the coding/attention-to-detail.",1438295161,1438295226,True,37,3,0.780183017253875732,2,True,False,False,False,,,

I LOVE these types of games. Build ship, gather resources, build bigger ship, smash enemies. That part of this game is fun. However, it's a broken PoS. Half the things don't work properly.

List of broken stuff:
-Drones fly off without reason into space and die.
-Missle targeting flys around in circles for no reason.
-Auto-target turrets don't auto-target 75% of the time. They sit there idling.
-Auto-fire doesn't auto-fire when enemies are nearby 75% of the time. They sit there idling (noticing a pattern here?).
-Ship re-building randomly doesn't work. Once, I was half-dead, went to allied territory and went to take a leak. Then I made a sandwich. Came back 5 minutes later and I still wasn't rebuilt. I had to exit and re-enter the game.
-Sheilds randomly malfunction . No, there was not an EMP, the sheilds simply didn't want to turn on so I had to go kill myself to get them to work again (even though dying in this game isn't much of a consequence, it's still annoying!).
-Thrusters on the side of the ship do jack-all. No matter what angle I put them at, strafing is a hundred times slower than going backward and forward. I put LITERALLY 10 times more thrusters on the sides of the ship than on the back of the ship, and no change. Barely any strafing at all. A thruster on the side of the ship does 1/100th the power of a thruster on the back/forward of the ship simply for the fact that it's on the side. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or if it's designed to be like that, either way, it's really damn annoying.
-Half the time, the ship I'm currently flying either wants to go forward, or turn. Never both at the same time, but one or the other, exclusively.
-Entering or exiting a menu resets the volume of the music to MAXIMUM. I play with my speakers pretty high up and turn most of the in-game volume down. This usually isn't a problem except in this game. Every time I go into the menu to change my ship, my fleet's ships, check the map, or pause the game, the volume for the music cranks all the way up to 100% for about a second, deafening me. This is more of a personal problem, but it's just another glitch that shows the game released too soon.
-Every third game, my base spawns in the middle of god damned no where. No enemies within a hundred miles. Just dead, deep space between me and them. At the beginning of the game, you're especially weak, so you rely on your allies to help significantly, but it's impossible in these games, so the best advice I have is to just remake it. Another annoyance.
-Every few minutes more I play this game I find another glitch/bug/thing I don't like.

Positives:
-Music is awesome. It gets my blood pumping at times and at others it makes me sit back and relax to the joys of the graphics.
-Looks awesome. The graphics of this game are amazing. Beautifully done.
-Ship building is simple, yet deceptively complex. You can't simply stick a massive shield on one side of the ship and have it work properly. You need to counter-balance it with another shield, or something with similar mass. Center of gravity of the ship actually matters and you can easily build a ship by accident that can only fly in circles. I love that!
-Individual part destruction. When a part gets hit, you lose it, simple as that. If you lose your left aft engines, then guess what, you're flying in circles 'till it regenerates buddy. 
-Individual part regeneration. After a short period (dependant on the part), it regenerates, free of cost, without having to go back to a station to repair and refuel.
-Unlock a part and you can use it as many times as you like.
-Free ship re-design. Re-design your ship over and over and over aaaaaand oooooooveeeeeeer again all you want, it's free. You're gonna need those remakes to create a good one. You don't even have to enter a spaceport and whatnot.

Graphics are simplistic yet easy to get around, nothing overly high  1800x1800 pixel sprite sheets like most other games out right now so performance shouldn't be an issue at all and viewing the game is easy.
Ontop of that it holds a good engine so even when there's spam everywhere the game will run smoothly.
Reassembly also inspires creativity, even if you aren't creative and bad at making things look good, the game still  assists you, and if you can make good looking machines the game makes them look even better out of the editor.
Gameplay is something not many use but regardless even if you get 5+ capitol mega ships you will still find something which will scare you and hunt you down followed by killing you.
However the best part by far in my opinion is the fact what you make, is whatever ships you make and add to your fleet design, will be randomly spawning and recreated which always gets me hyped when I see my own creations in use.

I could (and probably already have) spend hours just designing and testing out different ships. I've played it for hours and there are a number of things I really like, but I'm going to focus on the areas that need improvement for this review:

My biggest complaint is the lack of end-game goals. Once you reach the upper limits of ship size and amass a big fleet, there's pretty much nothing that can stand in your way and the game becomes trivial. At that point, even if there wa s a win condition, there's no real reason to keep playing.

One of the other areas I'd like to see improvement in is the various factions. The first faction, Terran, has a lot of different technology to play with, but most other factions only have a few different weapon types, etc. This made playing the factions I'd unlocked less fun than I had hoped.

Finally, the ship AI leaves a bit to be desired, specifically their ability (or lack thereof) to navigate around obstacles. For a game set in space, the world is densely populated, and I've frequently had issues with AI ships getting stuck behind asteroids or accidentally getting latched onto other ships (the more irregularly shaped ones). Even trying to turn your own ship around in similar situations can be difficult with the default control scheme (mouse rotates ship).",1437751169,1437751169,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[h1]The Spacetacular Spaceventure.[/h1]

Reassembly is all about space and freedom of it. There are seven factions available, each with their own unique playstyle. You can peacefully grow plants and extract energy from solar panels, or you can set up your own fleet of doom and plunder the galaxy. You can take things down with precise lasers, continuous beams, play a pew-pew-em-up with plasma cannons and if that doesn't help - spam them with missiles until they die. For those who desire exotic methods of space annihilation, make your own sawblade of death. Choices are limitless.

[h1]Right [strike]in[/strike] from the childhood.[/h1]

There are just three resources in this game: R(esource), C(urrency) and P(ower), each made to limit or unbind your possibilities. The cycle seems to be simple - R is traded for C, C is spent on P, and P is how many hardware you can put into your ship to earn yourself more R. But it's harder than it sounds. You don't just buy hulls, glue cannons on them and go gunning things down. You build your own ship piece by piece, and that's where LEGO nostalgia hits. Space, energy and Power efficiency is what makes it hard and beautiful. You can put tons of armor and guns on your ship, but thrusters just won't carry such mass. You can be tanky and quick, but with little to no offense available. You can put powerful guns and quickly execute hit-and-run tactics, but two shots will annihilate your little scrap piece of death.

[h1]Spiky plants.[/h1]

You'll find out soon enough.

[h1]Dark spirit fleet has invaded.[/h1]

So, you've made your bulky space cannon of extreme vengeful execution of space heretics and conquered the whole galaxy. And that's it? No, of course not. There are wormholes and agents.

Wormholes is what gives Reassembly infiniteness. When you approach a wormhole you're offered to either pass through to a newly generated galaxy, or to send your current fleet to other worlds in form of agents.

Agents are what slows you down. They are well-equipped fleets made by other players, and they are extremely hard to defeat. There are usually 6-8 fleets on the galaxy map, and they're moving towards you. Slowly. But when they reach you, they start plundering your stations and ships. Until they are defeated, they'll find you and destroy you. But the reward for killing them is worth the trouble.

[h1]Boooooring![/h1]

Well then, recently there had been added Steam Workshop support. Test out all the new player ships and factions, unleash their power on others or get wrecked by their overpoweredness. I'd say that the choice is yours, but you don't really have any choice. The galaxy's cruel.

1.make more factions function correctly.
2.make the red faction's blocks fit more nicely/give a little more budging room. I often find myself building mouths and finding that they just won't close, and I spend hours trying to work around that.

Your space ship is made of parts. Just like legos. And they fight other ships the devs made or other players made. Thruster position and mass are a big part of how the ships work. Lots of 'armor' means more mass which means thrusters will not be as effective. And WHERE the thrusters are placed are so important too!

-Player made fleets appear in your game
-Ability to upload your ship/fleet to the cloud so they can appear in other players' games
-Good graphics
-Newtonian physics, it's like you're actually flying in zero gravity
-Interesting AI differences in factions, some npc ships will actually salvage parts from downed enemies and use them to upgrade their own ship.
-A sandbox mode where you can simulate battles, take control of ships you spawn, and write scripts. Great for testing your custom factions and ships.

Cons/Suggestions to devs:
-The ship editor lacks a symmetry mode, which would make ship building a bit more streamlined
-When you run into stuff, you take damage. I feel like there should be an option to disable this for new players, however this feature grants the ability to create ships that ram when in combat, which is always fun as hell.
-There needs to be a better way to quickly check how damaged your ship is. Perhaps a bar on the hud that shows what percentage of your ship is damaged. Sometimes the screen gets so busy you can't see how much of your ship is left and when it would be a good idea to turn tail and flee if things get too hairy.
-Sometimes it's hard to travel quickly from one place to another because you can't see far enough in front of your ship to see obstacles like asteroids and stations. Space high ways or warp gates would be an excellent addition to the game.
-There is currently no way to tell how much of your shields are left. A way to monitor that would be very convenient.
-The sandbox mode lacks a tutorial on how to use the command line.
-An interesting addition would be factions that have more than just 2 colors in their color scheme. I sometimes feel limited when attempting to create more flashy and appealing ships. Maybe the ability to paint your ship or add decals would work.
-There are no planets. Holy shit it would be awesome to blow up a planet.

I bought this game during a sale but after playing it I can say that, for me at least, I would have been happy to pay full price.

It's got a great atmosphere, the galaxy really feels alive, with plants shooting their spores from one asteroid to another, all the different factions doing their business, battles raging, quiet stretches of space littered with the remains of destroyed ships, asteroid fields and wormholes.

It also has a sandbox mode (with command line and all), and a tournament mode, where you can organize battling championships.

Slightly dissapointed with some unlockable factions, and the UI isn't great (no way to save individual ship weapon bindings?), but I don't regret buying the game at all, it was (and still is, to be honest) a blast.

But this is one of those gems that I can't leave alone for longer than a week or so, it's a masterpiece.

The idea? Make a ship, blow up other ships, farm resources, make an army, use the aforementioned army to destroy other ships and make your faction inevitably powerful and build super destroyers, for the sake of entertainment.

But it's so much more than that, it has beautiful graphics (even on lower settings), doesn't destroy your framerate, allows free building of pretty much whatever you want, in terms of ships / stations, the only part of this game that I feel is lacking is in both the modding and sandbox areas.

Once you have enough resources, you can design your very own ships to the fullest degree as they are no mandatory templates or spaceship hulls to work off of.

Focus is on design and some very arcade style combat.

NOTE: I haven't played past the first 'race' - and the playstyle of other races are different - but in a limited sense.

In theory you could do economy building, but you only control one ship (effectively) so actually building a economy to produce masses of ships appears a distant dream.

Complaints about the balance are justified.  Ships designed by other players will inhabit your world, and they run the gammut from harmless to ... very challenging.

I'm continuously annoyed by 3 things.

1 - Economic development is unmanageable, and resource farms are often eradicated by combat.  It's not merely a re-seed problem - you can actually destroy asteroids - the 'ground' on which you plant farms.  Only one faction can effectively generate farms. Humans can push asteroids around and then hope that seeds spawn before the plants / asteroids are destroyed by combat.

2 - The blocks aren't quite standardized.  The slight differences in size and connection point locations are amazingly frustrating.  75% of my ship design time is spent trying to find a way of connecting blocks that are off by a few pixels.
As a bonus sometimes the order in which you assemble the exact same shape can allow or disallow a connection.

3 - Progression is very shallow.  You can spend your 'money' on: 
- new weapons / modules (but nothing outside your faction and there is no 'tree' or research time, just a list of items and prices).
- AI ships (like one of your faction's ships?, you could make one or just buy it)
- Size limit increases. (your personal ship is 'free')

'Size limit' is the only thing that prevents you from making collossal ships at the start.  Modules and Weapons (but not hull) have a complexity cost, and your complexity limit starts at 300.  You simply spend 'money' to buy a larger limit, and 2000 appears to be a good target for a good combat design.

You also have resources which are used to produce new ships.  You can trade resources for 'money' by dropping them off at a station.

Overall: 
 If you want a sandbox for designing blaster ships, this game isn't bad.
 Advanced stuff isn't possible due to the AI and mechanics. (AI can swarm - but you can't)

Reassembly is easy to understand, rough to master, with multiple different ship construction strategies that may or may not work, whether alone or together.
Your objective is to collect resources to upgrade and build your ship(s), eventually providing your ship with a factory block that can spawn a fleet for you. Enemies are generated off of other players' designs, copied through the use of wormholes, keeping you however from ever encountering real players, just AI versions of their fleets.

Pros:
-No frame drops, I've rarely been lowered in video quality throughout my time playing
-Expansive maps, plenty of sectors generated swiftly with new stations to capture and factions to fight
-Comfortable building interface, with useful tools like mirror and copy and paste to make everything much faster to build, putting you in the fight sooner, plus a lot of weapons and tools to make specialized ships like drone swarm spawners, rocket carronades, snipers, etc.
-Nice artstyle. Very minimalistic, but it is still nonetheless fun to watch your ships ""reassemble"" as the new parts are traced and come to life in the middle of a battle
-No loading screens. Literally none.
-Test feature, which pits your newly made ship against another of the same value to test its strength in a real battle, before you try and fly a space dumpster into a battle and waste time

Cons:
-Slightly repetitive soundtrack. Good music, but it seems to loop a lot. Maybe I'm just playing too much :P
-Instructions and controls must be looked up a couple times to learn how to do everything (ie Toggle hud, commision fleet ships, set child cycles for your fleet's ships, etc)
-My biggest problem: Ship control. Most games like this have the WASD keys stay in a locked position of North, West, South, East. This game, however, orients control around your crosshair, meaning you have to constantly check which way your shape is facing and reorient yourself to fly properly. Very hard to get used to.

All in all, I'm giving it a 8/10. Fantastic game, and I highly recommend it, I would just like to see some new features implemented and that movement control thing given a second option.

Things I want to See Implemented:
-Co-op multiplayer. Allow a friend to join you in your faction and grow alongside you. Perhaps a combining force of an intelligent gunship and bot spawning mother-ship, I thought this would make a fantastic duo.
-New music
-New weapons and hull parts/utillity pieces, some ideas are:
     > Repair drone. Accelerates rebuild speed.
     > Cloaking system
     > Repulsion/Attraction blocks, for pulling in enemies into short range weapons or pushing them away from a long range ship
     > Kamikazee drones. Name says it all
     > Barrier construction. Some kind of attachment that uses resources to build walls for defense, or maybe even dispense some kind of acid or magma to ward off pursuers.
     > Parasite drone. A drone that embeds into the core of a ship and changes its faction, rebuilding it and putting it in your fleet, maybe even copying the schematic into your inventory

This is a beautifull game that makes you rage when the other factions kill you brutally and joy when you destroy their cities to death.
Ok now to the true review.
CONTENT:
This game is full of content:from giga weapons to strange asteroids that explode on contact,every faction has its own weapons and parts that makes you feel you are playing a different game when you switch faction.
The map is HUGE and every time different with tons of biomes.
GRAPHICS:
The game graphics are extremely simple but beautifull at the same time,they are very clean and outlined with lit colors.
CHALLENGE:
You'll start with a small weak ship and you are going to build your way up to a powerfull mother ship with hundreds of drones...
at least if the other factions don't destroy you first:every faction is hostile,no one will help you except some ships and some stations that are from the same faction as you.
So the game is very hard at the start but in the end it's easy as eating a piece of cake.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
While in combat the ai is formidable,3 ships can kill you in no time dodging all of your hits,into  the travel factor they often crash in to asteroids.
Multiplayer:WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.















I'VE WARNED YOU.





















Ok now i can talk.
The multiplayer factor  is divided into two parts:wormholes and tournament mode.
Wormholes:
While exploring your world you could find worholes ,with them you can do two things:send your fleet in the world of another player(it's random),the sent fleet will spawn as an ""agent"" that whill destroy the players stations,or you can travel physically in to another world that is different from the one that you were in.
Tournament:
In tournament mode you can challenge other players in a fight between fleets(you can select the ones that you have built in single player).

The simplistic parts that you get to design your ship with is all you need to create the coolest looking space-ships this side of the galaxy. It's not as simple as ""plug the device on and go"", you need to build your ship CORRECTLY or it won't maneuver through space! Don't have enough retro-thrusters? You better hope you can back off the enemy fast enough by turning (and not dying from losing your back end). Didn't think you needed thrusters to turn? Guess you're going in one direction infinitely. It's a constant failure zone, and I just LOVE IT!

It's a very grindy game, so if you don't like grinding, I would certainly stay away. And the sandbox mode isn't very intuitive either. I tried to build something in the constructor (in the sandbox mode), and I didn't even get things to build with. Don't get fooled with sandbox mode, it isn't a free build-any-ship-for-free mode @.@ If you don't mind grinding as you play different factions (have to unlock them), then you'll find HOURS upon HOURS trying new designs and seeing if they stack up with the best.

[b] 24 hours of Gameplay later: [/b] This game is even better!  Again the game is grindy, but the different factions (without mods) force you to build your ships in different patterns. Have a good design for faction 1 (Terrans)? You're not using it on Faction 4 because there are no long-triangle blocks! The only downside with ship-building, is when you test your ship against others' you need to fight these really cheap min-maxed ships that do nothing but fly backwards when your ship catches up with every default ship in the game; actually it's the CPU attacking the other ships, but it's still cheap tactics that win.

Also, the sandbox mode isn't as convoluted as I first thought. I can create any ship I want with the right commands, and even see the default ship palettes for each faction. Unfortunately this isn't explained very well and you need a tutorial outside of the game to understand which commands do what (and that Faction 1 is actually Faction 8 for example). You can still build any ship you want in your save game, but the sandbox is very misleading (not much of a sandbox :/ More of a programmer's blank sheet of paper).

Design your own ships.  The part shapes are just occasionally odd enough that getting things to line up becomes part of the fun.

Test designs by letting them autopilot versus random other designs.  Center of gravity and healing rate are important.  Some ships are practically a huge gun with a seat and thrusters strapped onto it!

I spent hours not even playing - just designing a ship and watching it play against other designs in the test phase.

Once you are happy with a design (or just want to shoot something yourself) go in and harvest resources where the bad guys are, which also allows building up a fleet to team up against opponents.  Building a fleet is pretty cool - although they are something like a herd of cows...  not too smart and they get stuck in the weeds sometimes.  Playing the fleet dynamics is a whole game by itself!

The flight is very space-like where you have to oppose thrust to slow down, which makes it feel very swimmy (I think why they say welcome to the tide-pool).  In that regard it feels a little like Spore's bacterial stage, only flying takes much more concentration.

Replay value is sky-high, as optimizing ship designs at all size allowances allows starting over and trying new ideas.

Also, the game feels very different than other games because you have complete control how your ship handles (although once it's damaged and your engines have fallen off it will handle very differently until it heals again over several seconds, relatively fast).  Trying to control a damaged ship reminds me of Robocraft, though this game is much more twitchy.

If I had to pick a favorite game so far in 2015, this might be it.  The gameplay is straightforward.  There are always more things to want to try out, which takes time to get there and try them.

What there is to do:
-Build ships from scratch
-Fly ships in open 2D space
-explore procedurally generated content (As with all games that rely on procedurally generated content, the wow factor goes away pretty fast. Thankfully, this isn't what the game relies on to stay fun)
-Unlock new ship pieces and build better ships out of the scrap of your defeated foes.
-Build a factory and begin constructing a fleet
- Battle fleets made by other players at hotly contested wormholes (There is no multiplayer, but the AI is VERY good and it pilots the fleets that players themselves upload. It priotizes the fleets made by steam friends)
-Enter the wormhole to upload your fleet
-share ship.lua files with friends and pit them in 1v1 battle in tournament mode to see who can make the best ship.

That's this game, but better.

Of all the space, building, sandbox, and customizable games I've played, this one is way up in my top favorites. For those who love to be creative, this game is a must-get.

PROS:
+ Full customization of ships and stations, shape by shape. This is a huge plus for those who love to build things from the ground-up.
+ Ship building is very well structured and stable. Rarely are there frustrating moments where blocks don't do what I want.
+ Semi-open world (the world loops, but you can travel to new maps too.)
+ Nice graphics & well-built. Nothing too fancy, but still fitting. This game isn't too demanding in general, in terms of hardware.
+ Easy to get the hang of. It doesn't take too long to figure things out.
+ Forgiving gameplay. If you die, you lose all your resources that you were carrying, but if you're nearby enough, you might be able to rush back to pick it up.
 CONS:
- Frustrating at times. There will be times when you have those ""BS"" moments, and indeed, it gets rather annoying sometimes.
- Trial-by-fire learning curve. I advise against going to the center of the map until you're at max build limit...
- Full customization. For those who aren't able to commit to building your entire ship, there are only a few pre-made ships available at the start.

Reassembly is a top down 2D action spaceship building/ combat game. Sadly thats all it is though. This does not mean the game doesnt have some fun in it! You can encounter other players ships and send your fleet out for others to find. You will fly through space collecting resources and fighting other ships. It reminds me alot of first stage of SPORE. Ships out and about everywhere, collecting to power up.... Then some behemoth comes along and kills everyone. 

Pros-
- Easy to use builder. Doesnt take long to build ships.
- Decent combat. Sometimes the AI is wonky but all in all good.
- Huge areas to explore. Though after a couple times it feels the same.
- Neat factions each with their own strengths, except 3. Faction 3 is wet tissue paper hanging on toothpicks. Dont hit a rock too hard or bye bye ship.
- Good ship physics. How you build your ship completely affects the way it moves. Only complaint here is the seemingly never ending drift.
- General fun gathering. If you like the first stage of the game SPORE you will enjoy this.

Cons-
- Ship building is somewhat limited. You cant make really huge ships. This is limited by the max 8000P also once they reach a certain size the ether have no speed or no guns.
- Combat is decent but thats all there is to the game. Collect, size up, fight.
- Agents. I love the fact I find other peoples ships, I dont love that sometimes I run into massive fleet 10 mins in that destroys me so hard space rips a new black hole!!
- Some factions are unbalanced. Faction 3 is so soft on the hull that most my deaths came from hitting something too hard. I know it says hard mode but come on now tissue paper is not hull material. Faction 1 and 2 have the most building options. 4 can become really strong really fast. Like cut ships in half kinda strong. After playing all the factions I find 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 left me feeling let down. They didnt have as much to work with as 1 and 2 or were just 1 trick gimmick factions.
-Not all factions are playable. While you can mod to make them so, they are incomplete. I would love to see the borg like faction become playable or the plant type.
-Nothing but combat. I already mentioned this but it really is the biggest issue. Litterally all you do is collect, size up, fight, repeat. The game needs something.

This game is basically Space engineers on Steroids.

The ships are completely buildable and you have a large selection of guns to choose from and use (or abuse) on your ship. The map is randomly generated and people are able to upload there fleet of destroyers to your world in the form of agents. These agents are few in number and provide a challenge when you have made your ship so overpowered to the point where you raze other small ships. You can also hire and build allies, and there isn't much of a penalty for death.

[b]Why do I like Reassembly so much?[/b]
The base campaign is pretty simple and easy to complete. Where have all these hours come from with a tiny indie game?

Basically Reassembly is an engine that allows you to create what you want.

[b]Is the campaign too easy?[/b] - Make it harder by adding your own ships, more agents, or mods.
[b]Tired of the main faction?[/b] - There's six other factions to try out and each has it's own challenges. 
[b]Tired of the vanilla factions?[/b] - There's about 1,000 other factions people have made in the workshop.
[b]Still not happy with how things play?[/b] - Make your own mod and have it play the way you like.
[b]Wish there was more interaction with other player's design?[/b] - Try participating in tournament events, which we do a few times each year.
[b]Tired of building flat 2D ships with a set structure?[/b] - The game allows you to 'stack' blocks to create new design challenges.
[b]Still not done with that?[/b] - Take stuff you previously made and find ways to make it way better now that you know more building tricks.

^ This is how you get 2,500 hours out of a $15 indie game I bought 10 years ago.
10 years from now, I'll probably still be messing with Reassembly as long as I can find a computer to run it on. ... And you know what? The graphics will still be fine because it's all vectors.

Cheers  :D

Most of the gameplay comes from designing your ship and seeing how it fares in combat, but the combat is doesn't have strategic depth other than ramming or kiting.  Your design slowly moves away from what you'd call an actual spaceship and more towards a geometric shape with internal engines.  A basic square filled with as many weapons and shields as possible is simply better than trying to create anything that's actually interesting.  Ship combat, therefore, devolves into a blob of shields mounted on a square careening through space and slamming into other blobs of shields in an orgy of lasers and missiles.  It looks nice, but carefully designing a ship isn't worth the effort.

The design system is simple and easy to understand, but in practice it just falls flat.

The ""living world"" is also not really what you'd expect.  Capturing territory across the galaxy becomes an exercise in Exterminatus from Warhammer 40,000.  You bring as many ships as possible and cleanse every single enemy ship from an area of the map, which then switches colour to your faction.  That's it.  You don't get any resources, your own ships don't start to spawn there, not even a message appears on screen.  A part of the map changes colour, and you move on to the next area.  Eventually this devolves into chasing one tiny little gnat of a ship that can't even hurt you across your territory because it keeps reclaiming tiles.  It's tedious.

Don't get me wrong, I liked this game, but it is very shallow and the replayability just isn't there.",1432186910,1432186910,False,333,15,0.739983499050140381,14,True,False,False,False,,,

How do you beat this next boss? How do you navigate past this obstacle? In the past, the solution usually had a few different answers, but today the answers offered really do seem endless. Reassembly demostrates this by placing you in a gigantic galactic sandbox. You will start as the little fish, and work your way into becoming a devastating war-machine. Do you prefer anti-matter cannons, or a nice simple plasma beam? Maybe you will swarm the enemies with missiles and drones. Maybe even all of the above! Eventually you will also get the opportunity to design and produce your own fleet with a factory attachment. Each ship can be given a “child order” in which they will spawn their own new ships as long as they too have a factory attached. A war-machine and a loving mother? Oh the duality of man… Er, woman… Err… Spaceship. This isn’t going well. Anyways, let’s take a closer look at Reassembly.

Upon killing an enemy ship you will start to gain “R” or resources, which can then be traded in for “C” (currency). The currency is then used to buy new parts that can be used in any new ship design, this means you will probably redesign your ships fairly regularly to keep up with the latest, greatest weapons in attempts to conquer bigger threats. Your mothership has a “P” limit, I assume P is for power, which can be upgraded with the currency. The power limit of any ship designs constructed will translate to the resource cost once you eventually unlock the factory. While the basics can take a while to master due to the needlessly abbreviated names, eventually your mother-ship will be ready to take on anything. You will scoot around repairing damaged stations, which are actually destroyed by your enemies in real time! There are 7 factions, which means 6 different races to destroy! While you might enjoy feeding on their little guys, stay on your guard because there is almost always a bigger fish. Then again, it might be worth the risk because destroying one of the gigantic capital ships among their allied swarm is extremely thrilling!

Maintaining control of an entire galaxy is tough work though, and opposing factions aren’t the only ones out to ruin your rampage. Agent fleets, which are created and uploaded by other users (via wormholes) will relentlessly hunt down and destroy your spawning stations. When you finally find your way back to try and repair it, prepare for one hell of a fight. Flight and weapons are wonderfully dynamic, both in combat and out. Navigating an asteroid field takes a lot of foresight, unless you just have a set of lasers mounted to burn through anything that gets in your way. Some weapons are able to follow your cursor, while others are mounted firmly to the ship. Finding the best combination for your race, fleet, and strategy is absolutely imperative. Each of the seven races offers a completely unique set of parts for their ships so even after you’ve cleaned up the galaxy as one team, there is still tons of incentive to go back and try the others. The AI is pretty intelligent as well. You won’t see a drone ship (yours or the enemy’s) rush into the fray, and even the combat fighters know when it’s time to retreat.

There is very little criticism I’m able to find for Reassembly. It does lack a story, and the level generation seems completely random which doesn’t lead to much strategy regarding which colored enemies to go after until later in the game when territories have more or less been established. Overall, I found Reassembly to be an endlessly replayable treat, with a learning curve much higher than one would perceive at first glance. There are so many little touches that put this game over the top, such as the ship building battle simulator, in which you can test your newly constructed ship against enemies of around the same cost. This helps immensely with knowing how the AI will handle the many ships you spawn for it. Paired with the amazing construction, and as many galaxies as there are wormholes to crawl through (read: ENDLESS) this game is a fantastic indie gem that has truly blessed my library. Big thanks to Anisoptera Games and Indie Voyage for the review copy, this game is a jump away from absolute perfection. Fantastic work!

I would never have imagined someone making something like this or me going apeshit over it and yet here it is; At it's core just a handful of basic ideas, geometric building blocks, and one giant helping of awesome-sauce slathered on top to drown the whole thing in.

Here's what to expect:

1. A Procedurally generated space sandbox so the game is literally new every time you start a new game.
2. A palette of glowing geometric blocks with which to build your epic spaceship/station heart out.
3. Your own fleet lovingly mouse-crafted by you from one of 7 factions unlockable by playing the game and dominating your enemies.
4. 100s of stock ships from the 12 (or 13?) distinct in-game factions populating your space-box (that's ""space sandbox"" for those of you catching up).
5. One of my own ships showing up in your space-box bent on dominating your universe via the ""Wormhole"" system that allows AI controlled versions of other Reassembly player's ships to appear as ""Agents"" and lay down some good ol' fashioned obliteration on your ass.
6. Out of control radiant geometric space-plants growing on  nearby asteroid fields that SEEM to not pose a serious threat compared to the other guys with plasma-cannons and burst-lasers but just wait....just wait...
7. Moddable factions (currently in beta) where you, yes YOU! can create your own block palette, ships, and other faction goodies to inject into your game or upload to the Steam Workshop and let others play with your wonderful (or evil...) creations.
8. An awesome in-game soundtrack by recording artist Peaks.
9. Hours to fly by as you have an amazing time playing one of the greatest games there ever was or is or will be in this dimension or the other infinity of them. Seriously, buy this game.

1. True synchronous multiplayer....sorry folks, this doesn't seem to be a thing in Reassembly but who knows about the future? *wink wink Arthur wink wink*

       It always surprises me when developers are able to boil the concept of 'fun' down to such a simple, gratifying level. And that is exactly what you get with this game; an intuitive fleet building experience where the fun doesn't stop when you hit the building menues. 
       I'd argue it starts there. Though admittedly half or so of my game-time was spent afk (as with most games I play), I have spent roughly 20 hours building ships, and maybe 5 actually cruising around. The 'tournament' style mode you can throw any ship you've been building into is incredibly rewarding, and oddly relaxing. Sitting back and watching the Dreadnaught you've spent an hour on go ripping through other people's lovingly crafted creations is a great system that both allows you to test out your ship against a variety of other players' designs, and serves as eye candy to the nth degree.
   
       The game has a concept of 'agent' fleets, in which a fleet designed by other players invades your world. There is a peculiar feeling I get from this game that stems from this idea, and not even necessarily when I'm playing it. The fact that some poor player will at some point accidentaly have a run in with my fine tuned, massive killing machines gives me a sadistic pleasure that I would say is almost entirely unique to this game.

A gem of a game for people of all ages, and now that it has modding support added, who knows what can come out of this game.

[*] La musique, vraiment dans le thème (ma chériiiiiiiiiie) et entrainante ! 

[*] Les graphismes:  somptueux, on ne peut pas rêver mieux pour ce genre de jeux. Lorsque le jeu peine à afficher les 300 vaisseaux, 4000 missiles et 2000 drones sur l'écran, il baisse la vitesse du jeu sans jamais sacrifier le framerate: un gros point agréable!

[*] Les factions : on les pense similaires mais elles ont toutes des points forts et des points faibles. Du générateur de bouclier taille XL en passant par le Missile nucléaire jusqu'aux épées laser devastatrices à courte portée...

[*] La personnalisation : même si certains prérequis demeurent (les propulseurs doivent être répartis uniformément dans chaque direction pour avoir un vaisseau assez mobile), à vous de créer le vaisseau qui vous semble le plus efficace et le plus resistant. On passe d'abord aux vaisseaux cubiques pour aller vers des formes plus variées, souvent optimisées pour le combat selon nos préférences.

[*]La possibilité de tester vos vaisseaux en 1v1, l'IA du jeu s'en occupe mais étant bien developpée parfois on est scotché quant aux resultats. Ce n'est pas le plus gros qui l'emporte (pas tout le temps) !
[/list]
 [b]Points négatifs : [/b]
[list]

[*] Certaines factions rencontrées en jeu ne sont pas (encore?) jouables... C'est dommage on aimerait bien essayer!

[*] Le multijoueur n'existe pas encore (ou pas trouvé..). Pour l'instant, votre flotte est sauvegardée sur les serveurs et vous rencontrez aléatoirement dans votre galaxie la flotte d'un autre mais toujours contrôlée par l'ordinateur...

[*] L'équilibrage entre les factions est à mon goût encore à travailler... Surtout la faction rouge-orangée qui malgré un arsenal dévastateur n'a aucun moyen de protection et croyez moi, même les plus gros vaisseaux sont facilement détruits...

Ich habe jetzt 30 Stunden gespielt und das Gefühl die Anzahl der Möglichkeiten noch nicht annähernd ausgeschöpft zu haben.
Es ist auch möglich eigene Schiffe ,die man konstruiert hat, in seiner Flotte mitzuführen um noch mehr Feuerkraft zu haben.
Die Stationen, die man eingenommen hat bauen auch neue Schiffe, die auch Spielerdesigns sein können, was dazu führt, dass sich die Welt sehr lebendig anfühlt. Die Flotten anderer Spieler, die oft schwer zu besiegen sind können allerdings auch problematisch sein, falls es nicht gelingt ihnen zu entkommen solang man noch nicht stark genug ist sie zu zerstören. Das passiert aber nicht häufig und die Spielerflotten sind später im Spiel eine wilkommene Ablenkung wenn man sonst herümfliegen und alles zerstören könnte. (Das macht aber auch wirklich Spass)

I have to say that one thing that really impressed me is how optimized this game really is.

Mais bon, c'est beau machin machin, mais qu'en est-il du gameplay ?

Reassembly est un jeu où l'on contrôle son vaisseau spatial. Ce vaisseau est modiafiable et améliorable grâce à des pièces d'armes, de propulsion et j'en passe. Et toutes ces pièces sont différentes en fonction des factions qui s'élévent au nombre de 7. Car une des forces de Reassembly réside dans la personnalisation.

Votre but va être à la fois de controler un espace plus grand sur la carte et d'avoir un meilleur vaisseau au fur et mesure du jeu. Il faudra donc jongler entre vous et votre faction.
Reassembly s'avère surprenant dans l'intensité de certaines batailles spatiales et dans la physique du jeu. Reassembly dispose d'une physique superbe ce qui oblige a faire des modifications necessaires sur le vaisseau (Ex: si vous n'avez pas de système de propulsion sur les cotés de votre navire, il ne pourra qu'aller en ligne droite). Cala peut paraître comme un détail mais vous comprendrez en y jouant.

Un petit coup de gueule : le jeu n'est qu'en anglais (pour l'instant !) ce qui rend le tutoriel assez complexe au début, mais les mécaniques s'assimilent au fil du jeu.

J'avais acheté Reassembly sur un gros coup de tête, et bien je ne suis pas déçu et si vous hésitez, n'hésitez plus et foncez. Le jeu est sorti il y a deux mois, il y a eu une MàJ en Mars et il y en a une de prévu en Avril. Autant dire que le jeu s'avère TRES prometteur.

Amusez vous bien !

Customizable Spaceships,
Maybe look at guides.[/i]

   Reassembly is an interesting 2D sandboxy game where, simply put, you make spaceships out of varying sets of shapes and modules in an attempt to devour all other living things in the galaxy and unleash an age of your own reign. Or you could just get the second playable faction and make giant solar panel stations. Doing that also works.
   Anyway, I would suggest playing Reassembly if you like to create pretty things, functional things, or just spacey things in general. I personally like it for the large amount of customization which can be expanded even further with (apparently) easy modding that I have yet to dip my toes into.
   One of the few downsides I can think of is the fact that the various ""factions"" are limited to specific sets of blocks instead of it being all blocks at once, but that kind of makes it more balanced, otherwise you would end up having giant solar panel stations with nuke all over them.

As an added note about the last line of that haiku, I would suggest reading through some guides if you're having trouble at first. Unless it's just really not your cup of tea, it will probably get fun eventually.

Spent hours, no days building and optimizing spaceship designs. This is a designer's game.

Pros:
-The controls are flexable so you can fly however you want, a very welcome feature in these top down 2D games.
-The attention to detail in physics is incredible, e.g. if your ship has no off-axis thrusters, it turns really slowly.
-Open ended - no one strategy to dominate. You can go for speed, armor, shields, range, or build cost. Or you can just be a farmer or a gatherer.
-Multiple races - just when you think you've optimized a ship series for a particular race, you can play a different race with different abilities and different parts!
-Really pretty
-Self-building ships: the trouble with other building games (e.g. StarMade) is that you always have to rebuild your ship after a battle. In this game you don't worry about that, although there are design strategies for having your ship regenerate faster.
-Good combat AI, so you're not frustrated with the AI pilots being idiotic which breaks many other games.
-Ability to customize the build sequence of allied ships and stations

Would like to see:
Fleet vs fleet battles with the asynchronous mulitplayer! There are ways to do this with the sandbox but it's not very accessible.
Better (maybe customizable) combat AI: e.g. turning the ship to hide damaged armor or shields from enemy fire while it regenerates, or maybe being able to specify a preferred range of engagement.
Better non-combat AI: Having AI ships being more exploratory would be nice, otherwise they exhaust their local resources and just end up sitting around.

They will probably start by dogfighting their plastic creations, but sooner or later they will be taking turns to throw each spaceship into the other. This is the game of those models.

Reassembly's ship creation is simple but pretty intricate in its outcome - you strap 2D weapons, components, inert hull pieces and engines to your command module until you're happy with the result. Ships can be any size, shape, scale (ships can be worth 50 points or 8000), tactical role and degree of effectiveness. You could build the Serenity, a Star Destroyer, a butterfly, a cartoon house with drone launchers in the windows, a space station shaped like Dover Castle or even a sniper rifle with a spinal death weapon for the barrel and a point defence laser for the trigger.

At any time during the customisation you can press the 'test' button, and the AI will fly the ship against available stock designs in a 1v1 arena battle. You can also use the tournament game mode to watch battles between selected designs from any of your save files, any of your friends' save files and any .lua files someone has shared elsewhere on the internet. The devs run occasional open tournaments for ship designs, as do some youtubers.

Single player is utterly devoid of story, it's basically a sandbox galaxy in which various mutually hostile factions hold territory. Kill things and provide R (the production resource) to your factory ships to gain C (research resource). Use C to increase your ship's build limit and unlock new components to play with, or to hire friendly ships to follow you around. Install a factory on your ship to be able to spend R on your custom escort ships, which you can release for more C. Conquer and comsume the galaxy, find a wormhole, travel to the next galaxy and start over. The visuals are pretty nice, the opposing factions are diverse and the fact that your escort ships are ones you yourself have designed makes the campaign feel more exclusive and personal in a 4X-ey sort fo way.

The 7 playable factions generally handle differently, which adds some replayability. Some factions have diamond or rhombus hull pieces, changing their look and design priorities. there's a faction with really cheap shield generators and sniper cannons that can spawn resource-generating space-plants, there's a faction with cheap high-damage weapons and deadly beam drones but very little effective armour, there's a faction whose only direct weapon is a spinal plasma launcher you build by stacking modular components on top of each other. There's one faction that gets nuke launchers and melee spikes.

On the downside though, some of the factions get their playstyle from a lack of versatlity and a poor choice of components. It's pretty demoralising to look at a new faction's full array of hardware and think 'is this it?' Tournaments can be dominated by Faction 4 (the modular plasma cannon one) and by 'spinny ships' (that exploit the AI's ability to lead targets, making them impossible to hit), the music is good but can be intrusive and gets repetitive after the first dozen hours or so. The campaign has almost no ships bigger than 3000P, meaning a player with the cap of 8000P gets to stomp everything with little effort or interesting events. They are small complaints but they do add up sometimes.

To finish, I'll say that Rassembly holds its players' attention not with a scripted or even emergent narrative, or with a great challenge, but with the promise of having something to tinker with. Working out the strengths of each weapon or design, using those extra 200P to give your flagship a little more punch, and reverse-engineering a design you saw on youtube that one time, are what contributes to an addictive and engaging experience that's well worth the £11 it asks for.",1428323649,1428323649,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Experimentation is required to figure what does what. Also combat ends like a flash in pan. Either you or your enemy will usually over power one another and it will end rather quickly. Not to mention the computers pin-point accuracy that simply a human couldn't replicate due to the camera. Leaving all your best laid designs to ruin. Graphically and musically Reassembly hits the mark. With a space themed soundtrack that is enjoyable to listen to and vibrant colors that fill out the galaxy.

Basically you start as a small ship being part of a faction. You go around collecting resources and fighting enemy ships, bringing the resources back to your base or to motherships to be rewarded C (the ""money"" currency in the game). C is used to upgrade the max points you can spend on your ship, meaning you can create bigger ships with better guns and upgrades. C is also used to buy new weapons and things like shields you can put on your ships. You can recruit other ships also with C but it's a stupid thing to do since you won't really earn any C if you spend it on getting allies.
So you go around the galaxy, restoring your faction's stations and earning C and resources by doing so, destroying ships and their stations to enlarge your territory, but the enemy factions do the same thing to you. They destroy your stations and your hive ships and as you are expanding your territory in one direction, it's easy to lose your grip in another part of the galaxy meaning you have to upgrade all the ships in your faction as you unlock more total points to spend on ships, otherwise they will be too fragile when the enemies attack your base. You personally customize all the ships in your faction any way you want to, mixing functionality with design or just going flat out functionality with ugly ships.
After a while when you've earned a ton of C, upgrading the total points you can spend on ships, you start to build hive ships which can create new ships. You get to choose 4 ships that you can create but you can replace those ships whenever you want to without replacing the already built ships, meaning you can build 4 ships of a certain type then switch them out and build the next 4 while keeping the ones you already built so you can basically have a whole fleet of all the ships in your faction. This is when the game becomes fun for me because now, you're basically free to do whatever you want to. You started as a drone for your faction and now you have become a moving station, building ships from the resources you and the ships you produced gather for you, growing your fleet larger and larger all the time being able to take on more difficult enemy factions. Or you could just stay as a fighter ship if you're into that, collecting resources for your faction and letting it expand on its own.",1428237974,1428237974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

From a few simple polygons, you clump it together slowly, piece by piece, and learn what YOU enjoy, and find to work, and improve off it. Not only that, but this game can conform to the way you wish to play easily, so there is NEVER any one, right way to play. 

Wish to go in hard and heavy, with a giant, bulk-head cruiser? Go ahead, and charge at enemies with a hailstorm of laser beams. Or stay it safe, and strafe your enemies and snipe from afar with powerful missles and energy shots to obliterate the enemy. It is entirely put into the hand of the creator: You.

It sucked me in completely for a couple of weeks. I'd look up at the clock and think omg it's been 6 hours! I'd go to work the next day on 5 hours sleep. It stirred my gamer blood! The ship building freedom is top notch. You build any kind of ship you want particle by particle and there are lots of smart, handy features in the ship building editor to save time. You can hold down the mouse and drag it across an area to select multiple components or you can just double click one piece and everything attached to it will be selected. 

A quick ship building tip is to just build one side of the ship, say a wing, select all the pieces then hit c to copy. Move the cursor to a blank part of the screen and hit v to paste, then hit m to mirror (to invert the selection). Now you can just attach that perfectly mirrored section onto the opposite side of the ship if you need symmetry like for wings.
Symmetry is also important in placing your thrusters. You are in space so your ship isn't going to stop moving unless it crashes into something...or you put thrusters pointed in the opposite direction to the direction you're traveling in so you can break!
Also each different playable faction has some unique pieces to build with. Sometimes the minor differences aren't obvious, like where pieces don't have as much mass as other factions or they have slightly higher armor, but when you stack all those pieces together into a ship then the net values really make a difference in speed, toughness, or resource carrying capacity. You'll want to look at the stats on the ship pieces closely if you're into ship building.
If you're not into ship building there are premade ships available with each faction that you can use and just modify to your taste.

The game is beautiful to look at and very organic. To me it looks more like the world under a microscope filled with living, evolving organisms than it does a space frontier. Much like organisms, the ships actually create children. You can set a creation queue for yourself once you have a factory as part of your design. But you can also go into command mode by hitting tab and click on an allied vessel that has a factory and drag child designs into their queue so you begin to shape the future of your factions expansion without actually managing the execution. Just hit tab again to go back into pilot mode and go on your way. The allied ship you just programmed will now create what you set for it via the AI. 

Once you've got your perfect fleet together you can find then fly into a wormhole. You will be given an option to follow it or stay. If you stay a parallel version of your fleet will upload to infect another player's galaxy through one of their wormholes while you remain where you're at with your original fleet. I just really wish there was some way of knowing how successful these invasions were, like a scoring system players could access to get some sense of how good your designs were.

The tournament mode doesn't pit you against other players. It just lets you test your own ships against your own designs and a small selection of premade designs. I would love to see a true tournament mode where you download player agents and test your ship against theirs with scoring. The game lacks true player interaction in real time but atleast we can see other player's creations as they come into our own galaxy as enemy agents controlled by the AI.

Unfortunately I do think there is a balance issue that needs to be addressed with faction 4. You will eventually find certain enemy agents that are typically oblong, travel at high speed, and shoot enormously long particle rays at you at range even from off of the screen! That's faction 4. They almost made me rage quit because they really get too many advantages, but I perservered and went back to the design editor. Their weakness is maneuverability. Their big bad weapon of choice is not turreted so the whole ship has to turn to target you with the death ray. This is not a huge disadvantage because their ships are inordinately fast but if you build a ship that can quickly side step their line of fire and either swarm them or ram them so that they can't turn into you then you can take them down...if you can catch them. Trapping them against asteroids is a typical ploy. Really though, no other faction gives nearly so much trouble...

The only other criticism I have is lag. No it's not really just a hardware issue. I play many other games where it's not an issue. The devs themselves have stated that they've worked really hard on the optimization but the fact is there comes a point where there are so many collisions going on in the galaxy that it can be taxing. I have an i5-4670, 8G ram, nvidia GTX 780 so my hardware is good. But I like faction 2 whose strength is cultivating resources and building up a fleet really quickly. Once I push out a bunch of ships that then create their own AI controlled child ships, the game has alot to track. The devs said to go into options and lower the physics updates per second value so I'll try tweaking that more. But it kind of makes me want to put the game aside now and come back later, maybe playing a different faction and not use a swarming strategy. If you get lag you can also follow a wormhole to a fresh universe, but that too can start to get repetitive.

The fresh content is really about fighting other player designs as enemy agents enter your galaxy. I hope the devs continue to work on the lag issue (maybe instancing parts of the playing field to lower the amount of AI activity needed as the game progresses). I'd also like to see them expand on player interaction by scoring invasions, and maybe add some simple tiered goals with rewards for flipping sections of your galaxy to your faction. I think those things would add alot to the game's longevity for me. Regardless, this is a really creative game. I love looking at it and playing it.

This is one of my favorite 2D games at the moment and WHY I SAY THAT YOU MAY ASK? Let me start with the basics: Reassembly is an action oriented spaceship building game. Created by Anisoptera Games, an independent studio based in Los Angeles. Mainly inspirited in Lego and insect behavior in a world where everything is modular.

Reassembly

You start to build your very own ship piece by piece (ships are assigned a specific value based on their size) and most of the factions will cap out at 8,000P. Obviously it will take some time to get there ;). There are 7 factions in this universe and all of them play and work differently (insectoid, angley, squarish, plantlike or cristal like are some examples). One faction prioritizes high damage while other will get armor mostly. All of them have specific tactics and this will impact in their weapon choices.

You can also unlock most of the factions by killing large and valuable ships aligned to them. Once you destroy an specific amount (or, in other words, you make that faction lose an specific amount of value), you unlock that faction to play with.

Combat

Wield a wide variety of projectile and beam weapons, missiles, rockets and torpedoes, drones, and more against your enemies. Defend yourself with shields, armor, point defense systems, and pure maneuverability. The combat is a mix of skill, tactics, and preparation – an expertly piloted fighter can take down an enemy fleet, but having a well balanced arsenal helps. I can’t explain this better.

Art & environment

Maps are beautiful and the music flows with it. Procedural generated open living worlds where each faction fight for survival and evolution travelling though wormholes. There are usually a lot of “agents” (player fleets) spawning in the universe defending the sectors and spaceships, in Command mode you can pay them to join your fleet and seek you places to emerge. You need to conquer specifics zones to make spaceships emerge or grow your bases. But be careful, the big enemy fleet is looking these places to destroy them. Scavenge for resources, investigate disturbances, self repair, reproduce and take your fleet to the next stage.

Artificial Intelligence

AI is incredible. When you have a decent fleet of spaceships including your motherfucking leadership… YOU WILL DIE… A LOT. AI ships can retreat if overwhelmed because they know how to measure the incoming attack. You need to plan how to attack and how to approach the battle and maybe take advantage of impromptu battles between rival factions to recover objectives, or run away after your opponent calls in reinforcements. In screen there can be around 150 ships in crossfire (it will run smoothly and at a decent framerate if you have nice hardware, otherwise you will be laggy).

You can only target 1 enemy at time with you entire fleet and that is a questionable design choice. A small system to target different ships would be nice in Command mode. The overall gameplay is very nice. Sometimes maneuvering big ships can be frustrating in places with a high amount of ships and planets, but is not that bad. We have three control types: Keyboard Only, Mouse and Keyboard, and Gamepad. This is very nice and completely user configurable, from colors to buttons, keys, even control schemes.

And well, we can’t have it all… No true multiplayer mode(can’t fight other players in real-time) the AI takes over other people’s ship designs and places them in your worlds. Obviously, you need to upload your fleet when you go through a wormhole. Last time a tried that Steam completely crashed, so some additional work towards multiplayer would be appreciated.

Every ship drags out and drifts so much that thrusters are really only to propel and fling you in one direction while you wait to crash into something constantly. Simply put, the inertia is very poor.

Game feels heavily like an early-access (ie bad) than something that is classified as complete and released.

You bascially throw together some ship with thrusters and weapons on it and fly around and shoot stuff. The end. Every ship looks the same (a chunk of material together with random projectiles coming out of it)

Me recordó vagamente a la fase inicial del SPORE, en el estado de célula. Vas recolectando recursos o destruyendo otras facciones para ir evolucionando tu civilización y mejorando tu flota de naves. Al igual que en spore tus diseños además de usarlos tu, también los usa la IA, cosa que me gusta.

La forma de construir es muy intuitiva y fácil para cualquiera, la variedad de las partes y armas es buena y permite mucho juego. El mapa es amplio y la IA enemiga es habilidosa.

La sección de construcción tiene un aliciente, y es un test de tu nave mientras la fabricas en la que son dos IA, una con tu nave y otra con rivales de presupuesto similar luchan al mejor de 3 y así ver donde flojea tu diseño.

Lo mejor de este juego es que tus diseños se comparten como enemigos a otra gente. Existen unos agentes (diseños compartidos por otros jugadores) que suelen ser flotas dificiles que invaden tu galaxia, una delicia.

La cantidad ingente de elementos en movimiento en pantalla sin notar bajar el rendimiento es muy buena, esta muy bien optimizado, al igual que las fisicas, en definitiva es un juego viciante muy recomendable!!

Scroll past for basics

[spoiler]I have been playing this game a lot recently, and I love it.  I'm usually a little worried when I look at an alpha stage game because I have a few that I have bought in the past and never play, not because it was necessarily a bad game, or that the devs were bad, but because I have a very short attention span, and a lot of games.  The games that I tend to focus on are ones like reassembly, because you can take it as seriously as you want and the gameplay is ongoing, as in, you can go through wormholes and either upload the fleet you have currently in your saved ship designs chart, or you can actually 'go through' the wormhole and end up in an entirely different universe.  This is actually the part that I like most about the game, the first time I ran into a wormhole I decided to see what it did, after I went through my computer crashed and it deleted my whole save, which made me kinda sad, mainly because I thought my fleet just leaft me wouldn't come back, but ever since it has worked great.

Other than it crashing that one time, this game is spectacular, you are provided with 8 factions to play as(I think there are 8 playable one's anyway), and each faction has loads of powerful weapons and methods of defense.  The game makes it feel as though you are actually the commander of a whole race(being able to change the production of any factory weilding ship or station), and a power limit that allows you to construct massive ships bristling with weaponry.  The graphics are 2D, but that seriously doesn't matter, the visual effects are stunning, and the sound effects are also top-notch.  The ship crafting system is just like they promise, you can build anything you want, given you have ingenuity and know how shapes work.  The soundtrack is surprisingly good for galactic domination, and has a very spacy, electronicy feel.  The A.I. is pretty smart, not human smart, but it will use it's advantages against you, especially agent ships, cuz remember, they could be made by me, or you, or anybody.  With all that other stuff in mind, I have a pretty nice computer and a really old and outdated monitor, so i run most games on ultra, except crysis, or that type of stuff.  Most of the time this game runs fine, but if i have a big fleet, and im fighting a huge battle with hundreds of ships, it gets quite laggy until everything is dead.[/spoiler]

The basic facts are as follows:
Pros:
- Gameplay is fast paced and fun
- Makes you feel like the king of a space empire
- Ship-building system is perfect
- Graphics yo
- Sounds great
- [spoiler]Agents add tremendous difficulty[/spoiler]
- it's quality shit, buy it

Cons:

Możemy w Reassembly zbudować pancernik, stację wydobywczą, latającą fabrykę produkującą podążające za nami statki albo statek-snajpera. Nie ma ograniczeń - sami decydujemy, co gdzie i jak stawiamy w Reassembly. Jedyne, co może nas w Reassembly ograniczać to punkty limitujące ilość klocków jakie możemy wstawić - je możemy zwiększyć niszcząc przeciwników, robiąc misje i zdobywając surowce.

Synopsis: 

You fly ships and blow things up, exploring new sectors and conquering the universe. You collect resources.  You upgrade your blueprints and your ""power level"" to build bigger, better ships. 

Eventually you can build ""factories"" on your ships, which allow your ships to produce even more ships. These ships become part of your ""fleet"", allowing you to get into bigger, better fights.

Upgrades are permanent. Possibilities are almost endless.



What I love:
1) Few restrictions are imposed on designs. Making ships is a blast. Learn the shortcuts.

2) Factions and weapons vary well. Each has strengths and flaws. There is no magic bullet.

3) The learning curve to designing ships is rewarding. You will quickly discover what doesn't work.

4) Making mistakes is okay. Your flagship is basically free. You can recover from losses easily.

5) Fights are exciting, managing your fleet is addictive. This game is fun for me.

6) The objectives aren't super important. My goal is to conquer the universe.


Cons, which I hope to explain away:

1) The music became repetitive. I replaced it with my own, no big deal.

2) The building interface is tricky at first. Learn the shortcuts.

3) Controlling ships is tricky at first. Don't neglect propulsion in all directions.

4) Rarely, I will get ""stuck"" on things on collision. It may be a bug, but I try not to hit things.

5) [Related] an ""impending collision indicator"" would be awesome. Seriously.

6) I feel like dismantling ships you don't want for money/scrap should be a thing you can do.

7) I hate tutorial popups. 
Give me a help window to explain the controls in full, I'll refer to it as needed.
Don't interrupt me while I'm destroying the universe. 
This problem is a minor annoyance at the beginning of a new campaign.

Did I menion one of the 7 playable races is using bloody penrose tiles? What the... just wow!

I think there is space for more user content awesomeness like player designed races (from the tiles already available) that would increase the already huge replay value to unseen levels, but you could call that a greed as the game is great already as is. And imagine downloading new races (tile sets) from workshop... yeah, greed... hmm...

This is a very special game and I deeply thank the dev for creating this masterpiece!

 * ships are damaged piece by piece
 * ships [b]reassemble[/b] themselves piece by piece
 * ships with factories can spawn other ships (with factories...)
 * maneuverability is decided by the placement of engines ([b]finally[/b])
 * 7 playable races are unique and many strategies and designs are available
 * you can test your ships against other ships and even against each other across save files
 * galaxy feels alive, almost like Spore

Modifying your ship is a pleasure, the editor is clean and inuitive, and the block point snapping is extremely helpful.

It really helps you see how your changes affect your matchup against different style ships before taking it out into your world. 

The only downside is that since this game is all about making really awesome ships, you are left wanting a ton more blocks to expand your options.

+Свободное редактирование корабля.Есть ограничение на максимальное количество блоков и ограничение в цене блоков.
Но если немного похимичить в конфигах игры,ограничения можно серьёзно сдвинуть.
+Несколько фракций на выбор.В игре 15 фракций(судя по конфигам),но не все они доступны(можно через конфиги,лол)
+Огромный мир,постоянные схватки.
+Агенты(корабли или формации других игроков(не онлайн,ими управляет ИИ))
+Червоточины.Через них можно попасть в мир незнакомого вам игрока.
Правда есть и минусы.
-Доступны не все фракции(Да,в конфигах можно их включить,но зачастую они не играбельны)
-Мало типов блоков.Из этого следует следующий минус.
-Нет моддинга.(UPD 28.07.15 Теперь есть моддинг,но он ограничен(мало типов блоков в игре,соответственно-какие типы добавил разраб,те и редактируешь) Непонятно как обновлять свои моды,в английском я не силён)

It looks like a RTS, but plays like a 2D action game. It gives you the feeling of an ant in an anthill, fighting against the minions of other swarms. But also you grow and evolve and start to get your own swarm, that follows you.
All in all, beside being a space shooter, it really has some organic feeling. It also could be on the bottom of the ocean. Or maybe small microorganisms.

Your ship is made of different shaped geometric objects. Hull parts, interior and weapons. Zoomed out, they give surprisingly good looking shapes. After you design your first ship, you are thrown in a crazy living 2D world, where everything tries to kill you, that has a different color than you. This isnt always user friendly. Flying too early too far out of your territory you face enemys, that are 10 times the size of you. While you explore, you unlock commando points, that give you new weapons or upgrading your ship to be able to use more parts to be bigger. Also your surroundings generate ressources. Everyone is gathering them. If you kill an enemy, he will drop his ressources, if you die, they will also loot you. You can turn in those ressources on allied bases to get more commando points, also that station will generate new allied ships. That way, every faction on the map is constantly growing at attacking the borders of the other faction.
As the game continues, you will find more and more ressources, unlock new weapons, until you are that big, that you stop selling your ressources but generating your own minions, that follow you. If they are big enough and have a factory, they also will be able to gather ressources and build ships. 
If you are bored with your universe, you take your fleet and go to a new one (reset the game, like a new game+).

Every enemy faction has unique weapons, buildings, ships and tactics. Some of them can be really annoying, most of them are playable, after you once defeated them.

While working perfectly (I only had one massive crash), the game has a lot of flaws that bug me:
- there is no real war: The world only moves around you. If you arent present, the areas arent loaded. That way, you only have the illusion of a living world, but the only acting thing is you.
- enemy AI is korean like, allied AI is on drugs: Having some maxed out follower ships, then seeing them flying into an enemy fleet like idiots and dying like idiots makes you question the game. Seeing the enemy flying player designed ships better than the player is capable of, makes you rage a lot. It is no fun fighting the AI. They will dash forward, attack you and retreat like cowards, when you fire back. That way, a lot of small ships are capable of slowly poking you to death. If you manage to hit them, they will run away, like on crack, never giving you the chance of actually destroy and loot them. Some ships, even split in half and totally destroyed managed to escape me with 1 or 2 remaining thrusters and the commando bridge. A strong AI is cool and challenging. A perfect AI, that plays safe and never do mistakes is frustrating. A lot! Its not about them being OP, its about them always fleeing a fight.
- Charging my lazerz: directed beam weapons > everything. You can defeat 90% of the map by using massive amounts of the charge beam laser. Then put it on point defence. Then laugh like an idiot watching those skirmishing ships flying towards you to do their stupid hit and run, seeing them exploding because your point defence automatically targets and destroy them. Your other weapons will be massive amounts of plasma cannon to melt down everything that cant move away, or, if you like it with more precision, gaus rifles to shoot those poor bastards without them even knowing from where you hit them.
- After reaching max size, the game is over. There is nothing to do. Even the big ships, that chased you in the beginning, are small fishes now. I even managed to cut one of them in half with a single salve of gaus shots. Since you have the lasers, you dont have to care about the small ones ether. Simply ignore them. They will come in weapon range, then explode.
- If you are bad at designing and crafting games, just dont.

Graphically the game has style, though it is somewhat hard to tell from the screenshots that I have seen.  I personally like the vector graphic look and reminds me of Asteroids which I played the heck out of in my younger years.  The game is a bit hard to get into and I am sure I am going to have to watch a number of vidoes to understand all the concepts but it is easy enough to play with and pick up enough to enjoy.

Graphics, Sound, Story, Controls, Gameplay. I will end this review with my honest opinion after just about 30 hours in game.


Graphics:

The Graphics for this game are simple. And that is what this game's charm is riding on. 2D. It is simple, but because of this, this game has a very good feel to it. Like games of yesteryear. The game, with it's simple graphics. also has much diversity in the way it presents said graphics. From lightly colored tints, to bright shades. With the geometric shapes, the games has as much variety as you give it. And if you allow yourself to become immersed, the game will provide the rest.

Sound: 

The sound in this game was surprisingly not what I was expecting. I was expecting simple, ""Pyew Pyew ZZST"" sounds for the weapons, and the classic ""Rocket Burn"" sound for the engines. No, Certain weapons all have a different sound. And the further you are from the source of the sound, the softer the sound will be. Zoom out fully, and the sound is just a whisper. Zoom in fully and you get the full range of sound. Do not expect huge Orchestral themes with this game. It keeps it simple, and does a great job at it. 

Story:

Story? Simple. You own part of a Galaxy, and you conquer other sections. How, and when you do this. That is for you to decide. Not much else to it. Simply put. Your story is your ship. It is what you make it to be.

Controls:

Control are simple. Mouse cursor to aim. Or, if you like, Hit the ""R"" button to change controls. Personally, I go for the Mouse to aim, and W, S forward and back, A and D to turn. Gives it a more of an old school vibe to it. Makes the game feel more fluid on my end. 

Gameplay:

Gameplay. Oh so simple. Anything shoots you, shoot back. You died? Well then. Try out a new build. In my honest experience, going for pure SP from the very start, helps. Once you reach Max (8000) then you can have some fun. I went for a build similar to current day Naval ships. And let me tell you. If you build to win, using your own creative imagination. You will have some deadly ships. And When you get to build huge huge ships, you become a force even to  other players ships. And, like many others have said, there is no multiplayer in this game. Instead, you get to have other players ships, ported to your game. And, depending on how good they are. You get to feel their wrath. 

Now, for my Impression of this game. I have to put it in a few simple words. A breathe of fresh air. Why? I encourage you to see how many good, space sandbox games are out there, that have a flow to it. Yet do not take endless hours to fully experience what this game has to offer. Yet the deeper you dive into this game, the more layers of strategy it takes to overcome. Though that is not to say the game will endlessly become more challenging. It is, as I have said, as you imagine it to be. And that, folks, is where this game has it's core. Some, like me, will find this game charming. And others, will of course, be left feeling a bit empty inside. That is entirely okay.

What is it?

Reassembly is a ship building game. Your goal is to design the most effective warship and conquer the sector. Of course, you're not alone here. There are factions that control territory in the sector. You belong to one faction and most others are hostile, although there are a couple neutral factions.

Gamplay consists of designing your vessel using preset parts. In the beginning of the game, you'll most likely spend your time gathering rescources that are generated by the local fauna and bringing it back to your factions stations. You will exchange the rescources for credits that allow you to purchase new ship parts and also alow you to build a bigger ship. Later, you'll likely build a warship capable of using the resources you collect to build your own fleet and wreak havoc on the opposing factions.

Your faction will grow and expand out into the sector and become stronger and you design ships to be put into your fleet. Once your done with one sector, you can enter a wormhole and enter a whole new sector.

Pros:

-The ship building system is simple and easy to use. Putting together a ship is as simple as a drag and drop experience. 

-The graphics look amazing. Despite being simple polygon graphics, they really are captivating. The light show that a large battle creates is quite a sight to see.

-You have choice about what you will do. You can choose to be anything form a simple harvester to a fearsome dreadnaught.

-Competition within your own faction. As you bring back rescources, your station builds ships. These ships then go out in search of rescources. This will force you farther and farther from the safety of your station. I find that interesting.

Cons:

-Despite what the devs may say, there kind of is one way to build a good ship. The armor plating pieces do not count towards the size of your ship. The best way to build a good battleship is to slap on as much armor as you can.

-There is no interaction with the factions. There are no quests, no diplomacy, and no alliances. The only path to victory is conquest.

-Grinding. In order to build a large ship, you will have to harvest a lot of rescources. If you don't build a big ship, you will always dies. Put two and two together.

Really, this game boils down to trying to build the most powerful ship. That's enjoyable, and the exploration (at least before you've seen everything there is to see) can  be quite interesting. I doubt that I'll play this game far into the future, or that (in this current state) it will remain a big thing for long. However, it is still a good game and I've definitely enjoyed playing it.

The game is a simple and fun top-down space shooter with the ability to design and fly your own space ships, and even design an entire fleet with ships ranging from small shuttles and fighters to large destroyers and frigates.

There are several different races (some of which you can't play) that unlock while playing (and destroying stations from a race you haven't unlocked before), each with their own technological pro's and con's, but they are all (reasonably) evenly matched, and where one race falls short in say shield technology, it makes up for armor or speed.

The universe is generated in sectors each controlled by the majority of whatever ships are in that sector, so it can at times be hard to claim a sector completely when there is just 1 little core still floating about. The universe is limited in size, but thats alright since flying over one edge of the map puts you at the opposite side without a teleport or cheap backend trick. Watch out for pirate fleets though; These are, from what I gather, uploaded by other players and are randomly selected, which means that in one universe you may find ships you won't encounter in the next. This uploading is done through anomalies called wormholes that allow you to upload your fleet (designs) or fly to another universe. The latter will generate a new universe for you while you keep your resources, credits and ships.

The only downside I experienced so far is not being able to destroy core blocks from certain stations. Usually this happens after a few hours of playing and may be memory related, but other than that it plays like a dream. The thing about player created content worries me a bit though, but we'll see how well balanced the game is over time.

The designer did a good job making the exact configuration of your ship very mechanically relevant.  You can spend hours thinking about where to place your thrusters, armor, turrets, ect.

The progression isnt bad either- there are 12 factions, each with many parts to unlock.  Its hard to describe how different it feels going from a faction that lets you make things out of squares to a faction that forces you to use rhombuses instead.

Fighting player made fleets is also pretty awesome.

The minigame of ""Can you make a ship for X points that beast everyone elses ship that they spent X points on"" is actually really interesting and deep as well.

Besonders wer als Kind gerne mit Lego Raumschiffe gebastelt hat, der wird hierbei schon leicht in Nostalgie schwelgen, denn genau so fühlt sich der Raumschiffbau hier an: alle Teile haben bestimmte Verbindungspunkte und nur an diesen lassen sich andere Teile anstecken.

Die Teile-Vielfalt ist ganz ok, nicht überragend aber auch nicht zu klein, aber da es noch ""Early Access"" ist wird sich da sicher noch was tun.
Aber: fast alle Waffen spielen sich auch unterschiedlich: Railgun, Plasma-Kanone, Raketn, Minen oder Torpedos, alles ist dabei und alles hat seine Daseinsberechtigung.

Raumschiff-Teile lassen sich hierbei grob in 4 Kategorien teilen: Hülle (quasi die Panzerung des Raumschiffes), Waffen, Antrieb und Gagets(z.B. Schilde, Generatoren...) aus denen mann dann nach belieben eigene Raumschiffe bauen kann.

Alle Teile (außer Hülle) haben eine gewissen Wert an ""P"", quasi das maximal Level dass das Schiff erreichen kann.
Dann beginnt auch schon die Sandbox und man versucht neue Teile freizuschalten und den ""P-Wert"" zu Upgraden so das man dann zum Schluss auf den maximal-Wert von 8000p kommt.
Hinzu kommt dass alle Teile eine gewisse Masse haben, die dann den Schwerpunkt des Schiffes bestimmt.

Die Steuerung ist je nach Schwerpunkt und gesamt-Gewicht von sehr schnell bis ultra träge, sehr unterschiedlich aber wenn man sich erst mal an das akutelle Schiff gewöhnt hat macht es extrem viel Spaß gegen immer größere und immer mehr Gegner anzutreten und sein Schiff immer weiter zu verbessern.

Ein weiterer Aspekt sind die ""Wormlöcher"" die ich auch nach ca.10h Spielzeit noch nicht so ganz verstanden habe: es gibt dort nämlich 2 Möglichkeiten: 1. man fligt durch das Wormloch und gelangt in ein neues Universum oder 2. man schickt quais einen KI-Klon seiner Flotte hindurch, der dann in einem Universum eines anderen Spielers als Feind auftaucht, zumindest sollte es so sein.
Diese Mechanik wirkt etwas Dark Souls inspiriert ist aber immer noch eine gute Idee, schade nur dass man nicht selbst/ aktiv ein Universum eines Anderen attakieren kann...


Alles in allem lohnt der Kauf von Reassembly sich schon, aber für Leute die eine ultra komplexe 2-D Raumsimulatione mit Schiffsbau haben wollen, ist es doch eher ungeeignet ;)

This is one of those special games that I will take the time out of my day to write a few words about.

First: off I love how there are three different control schemes for the game, you don't realize how important this is untill you try all three. It is exceedingly useful because not all ships will work with one control set up. 

Second: it's an interesting idea to have the universe populated with other players ships. It makes the game fresh. There are some problems with this system, for instance if you make a really weak ship and it is put into someone else's game it's pointless, but for the most part it's good. 

Third: the building system, now this system has some major problems, mainly because I have not used it enough to completely understand the logic behind it. I will try to explain the good things it does and the problems it has. It functions like the builder in banjo and kazooie nuts and bolts the difference is it's two dimensional and you have a keyboard and mouse so it isn't frustrating to manipulate It for the most part its balanced, I think it would help if the basic blocks had a cost, for instance I made a cube with the faction you start with and though it's slow it is almost unbeatable because it has so much armor. This could be fixed if the basic parts had a low cost, maybe raise the cap to 10k and make the prices on the other parts higher so it evens out. The biggest problem with the building system is the blocks have to be exactly aligned for them to snap together, basically imagine legos but the pegs are the sizes of needles and you are making giant ships. This ends up with blocks that are a few pixels off of being perfect, this bugs me to death, it's probably the biggest problem with this game. 

Fourth: The plant faction is too op, it is too easy to make a swarm of ships and to overrun any opponent you may have. 

Fifth: Another amazing thing this game does well is the different factions have different base blocks, for instance there is a faction that is focused on triangles, this forces you to build intelligently.

There are many more things in this game that are worth a mention but if you made it to this point I will sum up my opinion on this game with, a resounding recommendation. All though it has it's problems the game as a whole is fun and for 15$ there is almost no reason not to buy it, I have played almost thirty hours of it at the point of writing this reviews, thats fifty cents and hour I have bought triple a games that are less enjoyable than this( looking at you tomb raider, Shadow of mordor, farcry 4, and many others).

Silliness aside, I play a lot of computer games and love this one.  I rarely write reviews, that's how much I enjoy this game.  So let me help you decide since you're still reading because you're too lazy to watch a video clip of it on youtube (j/k, i read reviews of games before I buy too).  Do you like:
- sci fi games?  (Starcraft, EVE Online, Alpha Centauri)
- building characters in RPGs, building empires in 4X games, or creating custom units?  (think Armored Core, Alpha Centauri's unit editor, etc.)
- 2D arcade shooters, or people who like shooting things in general?

This game has elements of all of those.  Has a fun difficulty to it too, learning the mechanics, and being caught offguard by something new because you fight other people's spaceships in space sometimes, lol.  Testing your shapceships in automated AI duels against other player's spaceships is entertaining too, like watching a tournament in eSports.  Very entertaining game, excellent graphics, awesome soundtrack.  Music is the kind of rare video game music that you can listen to for hours and still enjoy.

The core mechanic of the game, building your ship is both rewarding and a time sink. When building the largest ship in my fleet, i spent 40min before i was satisfied with the end result. But when i was satisfied, i was very satisfied. I glowed with pride as i flew my behemoth through space.
The fun doesn't stop there. The ship is made up of lots of different parts, as you can see from the imagery. At first you would be forgiven for assuming that this is simply a method of allowing design flexibility. While this holds true, it opens up an interesting mechanic. You see, every part of the ship is a separate entity. A finished ship is less a single unit, and more a collection of blocks stuck together. In practice this means that slapping hull plating to your ship doesn't simply increase health, but creates an armored point wherever you placed it. Weapons have less health, so placing them in your ship created areas of vulnerability. If you gun is destroyed, you cant fire. If your jets are destroyed you cant move. This means that the layout of your ship is as important as what you put in.
Equally, your jet engines work as individual units, rather than just giving your ship '+movement speed'. So, if you don't have any jets placed at an angle, you cant turn. If you have no jets on your sides, you cant strafe. No jets facing forwards means you cant reverse. In this same vein, the more boosters you have, the faster you move.
All these points turn ship building into a sort of puzzle game. Though one in which the answer is what your preferred gameplay style is.

2) Combat.

While general space exploration is a big part of the game, combat is the fly in the soup of game mechanics here. (Not in a bad way, as everyone will want one). Combat is simple as it is deep. At its heart, you pick your target, align guns, and fire till dead. But on a deeper level there's alot which goes into combat. Every ship has a 'core'. This is your command bridge, your heart. When this goes, you die. Until it goes, you will regenerate parts slowly. So when approaching an enemy you look for the quickest way to take out this heart. With the variety of ships on offer, this never gets old.

3) Pacing.

The game is fantastically paced. Tutorials are done on the fly, so you learn by playing. At the start, you have a small ship. You gain resources by exploring, with small dogfights along the way. You use these resources to improve, and eventually you have a medium ship. Now you start fighting abit more and getting a better income from doing so, whilst supplementing you income with exploration. Then you get a big ship. Now exploration becomes the back seat. Combat is your bread and butter. You fight and fight. After abit, you enter the forth stage of progression. You may have dabbled, but until now you've been focused of improving yourself. Now you build a fleet. Soon your at the heart of a 30 ship strong armada, and fights take on a whole new focus.

The fantastic thing about this formula of progression is with the unlocks. There are alot of races (8?). You start with only 1. To unlock others you must locate and destroy a ship worth 1000 points (you start with around 300 and grow to 8000 so i found i was doing this around the second / third stage). Each race has some unique items and generally some sort of separate theme to its shared items. This allows great re-playability.

---------------------------

So, the review summery. This is a great game. Part Space exploration, part space combat, part lego. I'd advise this to alot of people, as there is something for everybody. In particular i'd point people to it who enjoy games with creation elements, such as Spore. If creation isnt your thing, but you like space combat sims, i would still advise this game. The races come with pre-made ships, and the game has the ability to export ships as code. So you can always trawl forums to locate ships.

The idea is not new: design a spaceship, battle other spaceships, mine resources in order to buy ship upgrades, repeat.  But this game stands out for a few reasons.

First is the realism of ship design.  You assemble your ship out of a stock of components in a editor reminiscent of Microsoft Visio (but better; MSFT ought to hire this guy).  In most games like this, you might, say, upgrade to Engine IV, which makes you move at speed 8.  In Reassembly, your ship's behavior is instead calculated as a consequence of your design.  Speed, for example, is a result of your thrust and mass, but in addition, maneuverability is a result of where you put your thrusters, how they're angled, your ship's center of gravity (which is indicated in the ship editor), etc.  If your ship doesn't handle the way you like, it's your fault, and you can easily fix it.

Second is the AI behavior.  All ships seek resources which grow on space rocks.  Lots of small ships hover around these rocks harvesting what they can find; a few medium-size ships prowl around the perimeter hunting the small ships; and occasionally capital ships arrive and destroy everyone.  It feels rather like an ecology simulator, with minnows nibbling at coral reefs, big fish eating the minnows, and so on.  Since the universe is dynamically generated, I assume this 'ecology sim' behavior isn't hard-coded, but is emergent behavior of the ship AI.  Anyway, it makes you feel that you're inhabiting a living world.

It's beautiful, too, with a minimal color palette standing out against stark black space.  Hundreds of ships can be onscreen at a time without the game apparently breaking a sweat (thanks Reassembly developer, for actually caring about performance).  And the trance-y music complements the minimalist esthetic nicely.

The building of ships and their possibilities is almost limitless ""almost"". The way you gather resources isn't exactly boring at all, I was worried that it would be a slow game that takes loads of time to build up to better tiers. But no, there is some time needed for gathering resources but more than half of my time I put into this game consists of me making up ideas of ship designs and models of ship from great sci-fi games and movies. 

This game has tactics that gurantee victory like other games allowing this much building freedom. One obvious one is weapon spam,  which does get nerve recking, especially since the game allows other built fleets to attack you. Which is an awesome element though, it really keeps you on the edge of your seat which makes there be no dull moment at all during gameplay. Although don't be worried about this as a huge issue,, one way to counter it is by making a bigger fleet or have bigger guns than you enemy. ( thats one that i have started using)

Overall great game, worth the money i payed, and WARNING GETS EXTREMELY ADDICTING!

(They're both freeware so go try them if you're interested in this.) It takes the concepts of both, and throws in a bit of Starsector (namely the fleet mechanics) for good measure to make a game I've poured hours into already. (As of writing, I've played it for 10.8 hours. I bought it yesterday.)

While some have also compared it to Gimbal, I'd say only at the very start. The comparison starts losing ground once you get the bigger ships.

Where this stands out is the.. well, game. BF and CF are both fun for a short play, but don't have many backing gameplay mechanics. Reassembly gives you economies, waring fations, fleet control and quite a bit of variety (Though I'd like to see mod support in the future for even more pieces/factions). Each faction also plays differently in various ways, for example, one can plant and grow their own resources, but seem to be lacking in firepower, another has literal nukes, but no shields, and so on, it forces a change in tactics when it comes to ship design that keeps things fresh. With all that in mind, it's still a sandbox, outside of the tutorial, what you do is purely up to you with zero guidance, I personally like that, some might not.

It should also be noted it seems to run superbly. I have a fairly powerful machine, but any game with 1000s of ships/particles will slow it down some. This doesn't, I've had fleets of hundreds of ships facing off against each other, and it has stayed at a stable 60fps.

Pros:
~ Easy to learn controls and UI
~ Game mechanics/speed is more or less controlled by the player
~ Different factions with different building materials offer a different feel.
~ Custom colors, I hate when you have to look a certain way.
~ So many different ways to build your fleet! I felt like a kid again watching my legos come alive haha.

Things I wanted to mention that aren't so positive:
~ Ive noticed some of the stations don't build themselves after capturing the node. They sit idle until I edit them, after I edit they will grow and start to function.
~ I mentioned the feeling of skating on ice. even with well placed thrusters its still hard to control your ship.
~ In ine point of the tutorial the game asks you to build a ship with a ship with a factory and then have that ship produce another to complete the cycle to grow your fleet. I love this idea but after you've made the first one spawn they dont really expand they all kinda stay in the same spot :*( I gave them thrusters to move! go kill stuff! Anyways.

There are some creative powerful ships out there but they are few and far between.  In specific i am almost constantly up against an agent called the lasercube, and its fucking boring as hell because i essentially have to break out a long range super fast sniping ship and kite it to death or make a clone of it, produce several of them and just out laser cube the laser cube.  This is also annoying.  Of course some faction arent even able to snipe things.  The faction that is orange red yellow has such weak hulls that the laser cube destroys them on sight, and with no long range weapons, and no shields the ROY (red yellow orange) faction is weak as balls against the others.  Its really annoying when my fleet of 7 or more 4000 cost ROY ships just get blown to shit by an agent looking at them the wrong way.

As it stands I would say buy it if you enjoy playing with legos a lot, and if legos weren't one of your favorite toys then this isn't for you as of right now.

Оказалось, что у каждой фракции своя ветка технологий и за каждую фракцию стиль и тактика игры разительно отличаются.
  В целом если по пунктам:
+ Весьма большой случайно генерируемый мир
+ Отсутствие ограничений при строительстве корабля
+ Разнообразные не похожие друг на друга фракции
+ Приятная графика
+ Живой мир, в нём постоянно что-то происходит. 
+ Красивые спецэффекты. Как разваливаются подбитые корабли, мне наверное не надоест смотреть никогда.
+ Полностью разрушаемый мир

First off, basically everything about this game is something to love, the graphics are really simple but work so damn well, the framerate NEVER drops below 60, the sound and music are also simplistic but lovely and the gameplay is some really incredibly fun stuff!

At the start, the game throws a ton of mechanics at you. Once you either get a friend to explain it to you or re-read all texts a few times, you'll get what the different terms mean, get used to them and be able to work with them.

While I imagined the gameplay to get repetitive at some time, it actually stayed incredibly fresh and fun for all this time. You keep getting new ideas on what to do, new things to try out, you can keep expanding and if all's boring, just start a new game in a different faction, changing up the gameplay a TON.

The other thing is: you NEED a good upload speed to play this game, because once you close it, it has to sync about 20MB of data (the world and ships) to the Steam Cloud, stopping you from playing other games during that time, and is just plain annoying. The even worse bit is that DISABLING Steam Cloud syncing seems to erase all ships you've created (it at least happened for me, not sure if that's exactly the cause), so you gotta deal with it somehow...

[h1] Pros [/h1]
[list]
  [*] Your ship is constantly rebuilding itself - leading to great gameplay moments like sniping enemy cores, narrow escapes, on-the-fly hull redesign, etc...
  [*] Instead of being a solo ship, you are part of a faction. You gain acess to new tech and bigger ships by advancing your faction's power which does a great job of making you feel integrated into the game world.
  [*] Each faction is very diverse, with its own unique attributes and building elements. These constraints help shipbuilding to stay fresh and encourage experimentation.
  [*] Fantastic ship editor makes it fun and easy to make your designs real.
  [*] Good tutorial to get you started with the core mechanics.
  [*] Community content - at any time you can approach a wormhole and upload your fleet. These fleets can then spawn in other players' games. What makes this awesome is that you don't just encounter single ships from these fleets, but whole communities with multiple ship styles from the same user.
  [*] A sense of progression. I typically lose interest in sandbox builders where you have to collect resources to use in crafting. Reassembly uses point-based ship construction, so you don't have to collect resources to build your ship - just to expand your point cap. This gives you concrete goals to work towards over time, while again providing constraints to motivate continual re-design of your fleet.

Die Grafik ist stimmig und das Entwerfen von immer neuen Schiffen macht unglaublich viel Spaß. Ich ertappte mich dabei 5 Std am Stück zu spielen, ohne an die Zeit zu denken. Und das will was heißen.

Es läuft stabil und die immer neu generierten Welten haben einen hohen Wiederspielwert. 

Das Prinzip ist eindeutig Mikrobiologischem Leben entnommen und zeigt wie einfach im Grunde Leben und Evolution ist.
Man kann sogar behaupten, dass es im Grunde eine philosophische Frage aufwirft, nämlich...wer desingt eigentlich neue Raumschiffe...ähhhh...Lebensformen. ;)

Remember SubSpace? Need I say more? I do? Okay.

As others have said, this game is extremely addictive. In a good way. The ship editor in itself is hours of lego-style building fun, but add to that a really immersive single-player world with player-made ships and you have a game that is both simple and compelling at the same time. 

Definitely worth the money, tons of replayability. Summarizing my experience as follows:

Pros:
- Great physics / destructable levels, and combat is super fun.
- Awesome soundtrack.
- World is huge but not infinite. That's a good thing for a space game.
- Building ships is surprisingly fun. I'm not usually the type to want to buy a game then spend hours in an editor customizing things. The editor is very featureful and forgiving (undo, redo, copy paste), unlike many other in-game editors out there.
- Sending your ship into a wormhole uploads your fleet into the ether so they can be run in other player games as the bad guys, Spore-style! In other words, tons of player-made content.
- If you get sick of your world, fly into a wormhole and explore a parallel dimension instead.

Cons:
- Controls are a little quirky, especially on gamepads. Don't use a gamepad. Occasionally you'll find yourself slamming into an asteroid and getting completely stuck because the ""fly backwards"" key gets completely rotated and you and up flying into the asteroid and flailing around until you're killed by a passing enemy.
- Ship editor is missing a MANUAL test flight option to get a sense of the maneuverability of the ship you spent an hour making. 
- Ship editor is missing important info about total mass / total thrust / total energy created which could help to approximate the above stuff. Only total resource capacity is listed-- everything else you have to calculate yourself.
- NO MULTIPLAYER! The player-made content is fun in SP, but a game like this just begs for multiplayer.
- Once you've maxed out points, Actual gameplay is 1-dimensional. Mostly consists of flying around and shooting everything you see-- or if you're like me and setup auto-fire, it's just flying around and letting the ship shoot everything for you. You can explore to find new bases, but that doesn't really give you anything.

On the last two points, I wonder if I'm just misunderstanding some of the game dynamics, but it seems like unlocking bases is just there to occupy your time. I also don't really know if you can ever wipe out another faction. It would be great if:

- You could watch bases expand over time, including size and number of ships, so you actually have more allies flying around. Ditto for enemies that go unchecked.
- You could actually attack enemy bases and eventually wipe out factions. It would be awesome if each faction actually had a stronghold base you have to kill in order to wipe out an enemy.
- There were new factions added over time, including to existing regions. Maybe I haven't played for long enough, but it seems like the same factions just exist in perpetuity.

There it is. Lots of cons because the pros seem obvious to me. It's damn fun! It could be even better if the above things were addressed.",1424652498,1424652498,True,3,0,0.514469325542449951,3,True,False,False,False,,,

Ever played a game and wished you could tweak your ship?  Well now you can.
Any type of ship imaginable is buildable: Carriers that launch leigons of drone fighters; Battleships with heavy cannons and a myriad of point defense lasers; Missile Cruisers with racks upon racks of guided missiles; Destroyers with cannons, lasers, beam weapons, and torpedo launchers; Fighters with rapid-fire plasma guns, lasers, and rockets.  Weapons can be bound to control groups and can be set to fire in grouped bursts or in a continuous chain.

The game starts you out with a well-made tutorial.  It provides guidance on learning the game and getting your fleet up and running (yes, you can build ships that can build more ships), without being intrusive or pushy.  All of this building requires competing for and collecting the resources that grow on nearby asteroids.  These raw resources can then be used to construct additional ships or exchanged at one of the friendly stations you've activated for credits to fund research and fleet upgrades.

The physics in this game are fantastic.  Fire a heavy cannon, and your ship recoils.  Hit something or blow something up, and chunks fly off and blow apart.  The field of wreckage that remains after an epic battle is part of what makes this game so satisfying.

The graphics are beautiful.  Colors and effects are vibrant. (Just go look at the screenshots!)

The music is suitable and soothing, but not particularly noteworthy, but the sound effects from firing weapons are right on point.

There are still a few bugs.  The game never seems to remember my control settings, and the game sometimes has trouble starting (restarting the launcher seems to work for the latter).

This is just an incredible game, I bought it and started playing at around 8PM, Next thing you know, I take a second glance at the clock and it's 5AM.

There are 7 factions, they all play and work differently, One faction is the high damage, high armour faction, but all but one of their weapons cannot do damage to shields. Another faction has incredibly low armour/health, but has the highest damaging weapons. You unlock the other factions by killing large valuable ships of that faction, once you kill a certain amount, or a certain value of ship, You unlock that faction to play as.

Ships are assigned value based on their size, So for instance, if your build cap is 500P, and you build a ship up to say, 460P, your ship is worth 460P. Most factions will cap out at 8,000P, and it will take some time to get there.

Inside each map, There are usually around 8-10 ""Agents"" Agents being player fleets spawning in your world, They can range from being total garbage, to an impossible force. Each time you go through a Wormhole, the way you change maps, It will spawn your current fleet setup randomly in other players worlds. 

The gameplay is very nice, It plays like a twin stick shooter and it works. The game itself is very well optimized, even after spawning around 150 large ships it still ran smoothly and at a decent framerate. The graphics are nice and stylized.

I really have nothing negative to say about this game, It's just amazing.

There are elements of building, space combat, and rts (in a somewhat abstract way). The game allows great creativity in shipbuilding style and combat philosphy. 

I find this game to be great fun. You can start with a pre-built ship, or make your own right away. The game includes an AI driven tester that will pit your design against other designs so that you can tweak and perfect your ship before flying it. I prefer to fly around and earn some credits first for upgrades. The goal is simple - expand your territory, earn credits, use credits to upgrade the power level of ship you are permitted to fly, unlock upgrades and build better ships.

The game learns from how you play and from facing your ships. Eventually you will face ships made by other players. Also you will unlock other factions that you can play which have different ship components. The replay value is immense as no playthrough will ever be identical to another. 

The graphics are clean and simple, not ultra-detailed, with nice effects, slightly retro and modern at the same time.  The game includes excellent controller support for in-game play, but for ship creation you have to use mouse and keyboard. I think controller support for the building phase of the game would probably be awkward and difficult to implement, so I don't blame the devs...

You choose one of many playable factions, each unique in the parts and weapons available to them.  Using said parts, you create a 2D spaceship and begin to pioneer your faction to victory.

Things to note:
-This game has no story.  It is purely driven by you making a story yourself, or simply wanting to conquer the generated world.

-All movement in the game is physics based, and your ships are only as good as you build them.  This means there is something similar to a puzzle/strategy aspect of the game when building your ships.  If this is unappealing, I would be hesitant to recommend this game to you.
    A possible solution to this problem is the implementation of the Steam Workshop.  This allows people to upload entire factions/fleets for you to use, but in my opinion you are mission out on half if not more of the game if you aren't building things.

-Replay value is arguable, and very dependant on the player.  If you are someone who likes experimenting with strategies, or challenging yourself by say, limiting your options by a personal rule, then you will most likely find it easy to sink hours into Reassembly.

    In closing, I will simply say that Reassembly is a very rewarding game for those who enjoy top-down shooters, side scrollers, and creating functional and even beautiful things.  If you find it difficult to find personal motivation with a game, maybe double check other games on your wishlist before buying.

Installed it and played it trying to keep making the better ship only to lose track of time 4 hours later. This is a great time killer. Graphics are unique, gameplay is solid, though can be repetitive at times with gathering resources.

I do hope they plan on adding ship sharing perhaps via steam workshop. Currently the only wait to see other peoples ships are to hunt down “agents” which are usually player made ships most of the time. I’m still grasping the game within the first 4 hours if me losing track of time.  Hopefully in the future, we have the ability of a more diverse fleet command system, and more parts. All in all, great game for $15 full price. 

EDIT: I should note that after putting more time into the game, I have found that you can download player fleets by just going to the Reassembly Homepage and looking at the sync list. Its as easy as just downloading and importing fleets. Check it out: http://www.anisopteragames.com/sync/latest.html

On another note, I only played as the first faction. Upon unlocking more factions, you have unique parts and weapons used by that faction. So there is quite a variety with the 6 or 7 different factions available right now. Definitely hard to break away from this, as I'm constantly facing player made fleets and always trying to enhance my fleet to defeat that fleet.

The ability to make your own ship one block at a time and perfect it and then see other stations and ships spawn your design is a beautiful site.

I bought it, even though $30 is quite a steep price for a game of this size, but for the most part it was worth it. Ever since I bought it the Dev has been active in updating the game and has made some major improvements on the ai and visuals as a whole. I think one of the latest updates that gave the ships and stations a glow based on their color added even more to the game's beauty. I love the idea of being able to design my own ships and take over the galaxy. Not to mention getting to see other people's creations (and getting to blow them to ****ing pieces). 

But this game does start to get old after a certain point. At the moment there are 7 factions, and I've been able to get to the endgame of just about each one of them, but after you do that.... there's nothing really to do. You conquer one galaxy, move on to the next, and do the same exact thing, and the hardest ships sadly are always the same, (the blue and pinkish purple ones) which are located in the middle, which sadly never changes. Faction balancing is also a problem right now. The red faction atm is completly useless and almost impossible to get anywhere. The blocks it has are far weaker than any other faction (other than its weapons, which do pack a punch) and its ships get completely destroyed almost instantly when you're in the starting stage with the faction. Even when you start creating bigger ships with them they get crushed by other factions who have far better blocks. That brings me to my next point, the lack of options when it comes to blocks for some factions. For example, a faction like the green race (the 2nd option in the menu) has 47 different blocks, whereas some of the others will only have a little over 20 (and are very limited when it comes to weapon variance). 

Another thing that should have been in this game but is not is multiplayer. Sure there's going to be tournaments where you can pit your ships against other ships, but only with the ai using your ship instead of you... If I created a ship to my liking, I want to use that ship to my liking in a pvp environment. Sadly the Dev said that this is probably not going to happen beacuse he'd have to take the game apart to implement a multiplayer function. So if you're going into this game thinking that that's going to be an option. It's most likely not going to happen.

Overall, this game is very fun and I would definatley reccomend buying it, but wait until after it comes out this coming thursday (the 19th) because it's going to be going down to $15 I believe. The creativity in this game is nearly endless, and many good times can be had, but unfortunetly you won't beable to do this with friends in the same galaxy and once you do conquer that galaxy, it's going to get repetetive.

Short Review:

+ Beautiful graphics
+ Good gameplay
+ Awesome features
+ Randomly Generated World
+ Wormhole feature to make a new world for replayability
+Amazing ship building feature

-Saves can be deleted from bugs that I've encountered (3 TIMES ALREADY)
-Performance issues on Yellow Plant Faction, even with beefy PC's

Long Version: Reassembly is a vector-graphics game with a great original topic. This game can be very addicting. The one thing i do encounter in this game is the repititive gameplay. Eventually, you will get maximum Power to upgrade your ship until you cant upgrade it anymore, creating a big, strong ship/fleet. When you go to this part, you will see it is easy to pick off the small and huge ships in the center, even if they swarm you, you would just easily kill all of them off. I do recommend to the Dev(s) to create bigger ships or even create it so that the bigger P you have, the bigger the enemy ships get. Sort of like ""evolution"" (idk lol). This suggestion would take time, but will be worth it.

     I have played this game for hours and it is extremely fun to play. I get more excited for updates in the game rather than updates for others (except Running With RIfles), even if they are just bugfixes.

Completing objectives like capturing points and killing enemies awards you with upgrade points that you can use to buy more weapons and systems for your ships. You can start from the ground up to customize your ship, which gives you the freedom to make a spectacularly crappy ship or the ship of awesome, all governed by how many upgrade points you put into ship total size. It's so fun, and I constantly go back and tweak ships when I unlock new techs. 

The price is higher than an indie game, and that's a bit of a negative, but there is plenty of value in the ship customization. There are different ship races to unlock, so there is a bit of replay value. The ship races differ dramatically, so it feels different evey time you start fresh with a new race.

Creativity in ship building is the shining point of this game, and I'm glad I bought it.

Summary: This game is still in beta. It also has some of the most immersive aesthetics and mechanics of any game I've ever played. I have learned to approach it with the caution of a recovering drug addict in a pharmacy-- if I click the icon I can expect to lose at least several hours of my time, if not portions of my health, dreams, and/or general human function.

Criticisms: The only reasons I would hesitate to recommend it to my friends in its current state are 1) the effective lack of directed multiplayer, 2) the comparative ease once you start building capital ships, and 3) the lack of polish/balance across some of the playable factions.

1) I found in my playtime that some of what I enjoyed most in the game was the ship design testing process, where at any point you can place your design in the hands of an AI and have it fight best-of-three battles against up to five different AI controlled ships of similar power levels. I would love to have the ability to put my designs up against the designs of my friends and other players, whether one-on-one, faction vs faction, or in larger skirmishes or king of the hill matches.

2) Speaking of the king, once I completed a 8000P juggernaut and spent some time retooling my fleet even the center factions posed little threat (provided I didn't park in a plant faction death cluster or otherwise act a fool). As well, there was no longer any real use for the upgrade currency one you've maxed out the P limit and purchased all the weapon tiles. I haven't tried to achieve complete dominion of the entire game map yet, but the endgame isn't presently as enjoyable as the 20-30 hours I spent reaching it with the first faction (which is a pretty happy problem, granted).

3) As for the factions, the first one has tiles complete with descriptions giving you an idea of each tile's use, as well as some flavor text. The other factions (more recently added to the playable roster) are a bit of a mixed bag, and often require playtesting in order to determine what certain tiles do, or why two similar appearing tiles may have very different power costs. I'm sure this will improve as the game nears release.


Conclusion: This is an excellent indie space sim that melds the fun parts of designing ships with elements of RTS and simple asteroids-style gameplay.

This beautiful diamond amongst rock, is literally the perfect game for those who possess creativity, and love to simply immerse themselves into a game that rewards for said effort contributed unto it.

I have played Hundreds upon Hundreds of rpg's, sandbox's, adventure and action gerne etc.  
This Masterpiece took the elements from many of the games I held dear, and assimilated them all into a free spirited sandbox rpg with not just replayability, but literally the best customization and diversity i've ever seen in an rpg/sandbox.

This game is simple. In said simplicity, there is an elaborate but gradual growth of complexity. The complex part of this game is the factor that you, as a player, control. This factor is your ship! Along with the other ships in your fleet. The more complex and functional you make your ship, the more beautiful it/they may become without you even realizing it.

Having made over a hundred ships, I can vouch for the ship creation system, as it is somewhat pleasing to invest ten minutes to have an exquisite and awe'ing ship emerge :)

It's worth the money.

The combination of certain creative and radical mechanics with an existing game format makes for something much greater and more enjoyable in Reassembly.  The mechanics of the game when you are flying your spaceship remind me of asteroids, but the game is a lot deeper than that.  Reassembly is a top-down space shooter combined with a very open design mode where players create spaceships out of connectable pieces.  It also features reproducing spaceships :)

In the video posted here on Steam, the creator of the game mentions something about creating things of function and beauty.  In reassembly, both function and beauty are valuable end-goals for player creations.  No one likes an ugly ship.  However, since ships reproduce, it is important that the ships are viable.  If you want a ship to turn well and quickly, you have think out where to place the engines so that they rotate the ship.  If you want to protect the core, you may have to surround it with armor.  Design in the game becomes a very interesting process as the original concepts behind a design merge with the necessary requirements for survivability to generate successful ships, or perhaps I should say, successful offspring.",1421701220,1421701220,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Heck, there aren't even any textures, but i must say, Reassembly has quickly become one of my favorite steam games of all time.

The main focus of the game is collecting resources from space plants (which seem to grow on anything that isn't constantly flying at full speed) and ships that belong to enemy factions. These resources can then be sold to friendly stations, who will not only give you credits, but also use the collected resources to build friendly ships, who in turn also collect resources to continue the cycle. Other than the initial ships in the world when you start the game, every ship, turret, and station must be spawned in from a factory (which is attached to another ship, turret, or station) when said factory has enough resources to build. All ships, plants, and debris are persistantly exsistant in the world, even when you leave the area. I cannot express in words how tantalizing the very idea of such a vast yet simple cycle is. Fortunantly, I CAN say (and with absolute certainty) that you MUST buy this game!

Your aim in this game was to swim around in the ocean and eat any of the fish small enough to fit in your mouth and then hall ass away from fishes that were large enough to eat you in one go.

That is a game i feel thay Reassembly can quite easily be compared to. You start off with a small array of 'stock' ships, provided by the dev team to get you started. These are your small fish. As the game provides you with tutorial messages and objectives you will fail at killing a couple of ships as you get used to the aiming and flying mechanics and you will find that if the ship is smaller than yours... It blows up. The moment you see a ship that consists of a number of blocks higher than yours. Run. Or more likely get blown up and respawn. 

But as you kill the little ships and gather your resource, convert it into C and then purchase upgrades or convert it into P. Your ship begins to grow. You test out designs but eventually you realise as long as you make it big and fast and cover it in as many guns you can hide beneath shields... You're doing the a good job. Your ship begins to get larger... You can kill larger ships... Your ship gets larger still. You begin ignoring the smaller craft you once relied on for resources as they are just a minor neusance to you. You feel like a God amongst the stars. Then a Scythe ship one shots you and you start farming those little guys again just to boost your ego back up.

Edit: Wow, in 2014 I sucked apparently. My opinion now is the complete opposite. I am always able to make ships that cannot be defeated. I have made ships so powerful, that I have taken on 23 ship agents at max level, and destroyed all their ships with only one of mine. My ships are so armed, that I don't worry about cramped areas cause I shoot a path through them, completely destroying all debris in the way. 
This game allows you to run tests on the ships you create. The tests involve putting your ship up against a number of different opponents, individually that is. But some opponents have multiple ships, so it is your one ships against multiples at a time. 
There are player made ships throughout the game, as the agents and as other factions. The tests also include player made ships, so there is a lot of diversity. As well as a chance to see what design other people use. 

I'm just going to put this out there, I have created quite a few ships that have never been defeated, and if you ever have to face them, I'm sorry.",1420066733,1574974826,True,18,5,0.627185940742492676,0,True,False,False,False,,,

To give you an understanding of the game, you start as a small prebuild ship which over time with enough resources, you can make your own or even just start making your own right away. 

At the start i spent 2 hours building ships and watching the testing battles, rather than actually playing the core game which isn't even done yet. In short this game is great even in Early Access, and unless you play it for your self you will have a hard time seeing if you like this game. But i will say even as fun and addicting as this game is, there are some things not finished and even small down sides. For instance, the gameplay its self is very simple on its own, but is completly over shadowed by the rest of the game which is great.

Honestly i hope people buy this game to try it out as it may not appeal to everyone, but it is in no right a bad game, and i hope for the best that this game will be fantastic and live up to the developers and the communities expectations.

Crack. Heroin. Nicotine. Alchohol. Reassembly. What do these things have in common? They're all highly addictive. With that being said, Reassembly deffinately has it's faults, but if their's something that interests you about this game, then it's probly worth checking out.

Long Version:

    Reassembly is a 2d, top down, vector graphic space shooter that lets you build your own fleet to conquer the galaxy with. You start out the game with a few premade ships to select from, a faction that looks just like you, and a galaxy full of things that want to kill you. Your objectives are to capture space stations, gather raw resources, turn them into your faction for credits, use those credits to research new parts and upgrade the power of your ship. The further into the galaxy you go, the harder it gets. Whilst exterminating all life that isn't allied to you from the galaxy, you use the very easy to use ship builder to customize or build from scratch both your ship, and your allied ships. (They either automatically spawn based on designs from your inventory, or are spawned by you from a factory ship.) When designing a ship, you can also elect to 'test' your ship in a series of 1v1 ai controlled deathmatches, exactly like the anisoptera contests.

Then there's the asynchronus multiplayer, this game's greatest feature, and biggest pitfall. Essentially, ships that other players have designed will be found strewn throughout the galaxy, in their own factions. Typically, these factions are far stronger than any of the vanilla factions you will encounter, however, that's not true of all of them. For example, one user created a troll ship in the sandbox mode, which allows ship designs that aren't legal in the normal game mode. Only now, here's that ship in _my_ normal game mode. I have a problem with that. Further compounding this problem, are the contest ships. Those ships are purpose built to fall into a specific category of ship, and dominate anything with the same power level or below. Sounds about right, doesn't it? I mean, isn't that the whole point of the contest, and ship design in general? The problem is, you're playing a game that isn't a 1v1 deathmatch. You need storage tanks for your raw resources, factories to spawn your death fleet, and just in general use components that take up space that could be used for more killing devices, or maneuverability. For example, one ship I came across was designed to ram into you, shove a ton of armor between you and his control module, while having 6 plasma cannons on these fragile little arms. The idea being, there's no way for you to chew through his armor before those untouched cannons melt your entire ship. This works great in those ai controlled deathmatches, however it's completely useless in the main game. I'd like to see all sandbox ships blocked from the main game, as well as a user set flag in the designer for ""competition mode"" or some such, where any ships that have that flag aren't used for the main game.

    I've come across few other issues, like occasionally getting stuck in other objects when changing your ship (solved with a relog) and minor bugs.

    An early access game, and my complaints are fairly minor in nature? Why are you still reading? Go forth and buy immediately! ;)",1418953178,1418953178,True,35,9,0.726354241371154785,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Normally I speak of a game's good, bad and ugly qualities, in hopes of bringing excitement for the games perks, and light to its flaws.

I can give this game no higher praise but to say this: I can find no faults in it. The game is brilliantly executed, if perhaps still limited, but then I haven't beaten the game yet. The exploration draws you in in a way that I was utterly surprised by. Since the first day of exploring this title, I have been eager to resume it, to stretch my ship building talents, to bring vengeance to the evil red bastards who always seem to be one step ahead.

The music is nothing short of masterful. Most of the time I tire of the music and mute it in favor of my normal playlists, but the soundtrack is so beautifully atmospheric that there is no need. 

Now let's speak of the elephant in the room, a two headed monstrosity. The first head is the game's graphics. From it's trailer, you have accurately seen the game's aesthetics, and they are indeed simple. Then, you have the $40 price tag, a cost very near a AAA title. I showed this game to a roommate who immediately got sucked in, but when he saw the price, said, ""Well, maybe I'll get it if it goes on sale.""

Take a look at this game's reviews thus far. It scarcely has more than 30, but EVERY SINGLE ONE of them is positive. I have never seen a 100% approval rating on steam. I take from this two things: For those with the means, you WILL enjoy this title. I guarantee it. Two: It is beyond what most people would reasonably expect to pay.

For a delivery system that has no manufacturing, little overhead, and still in early access, $40 seems steep. It is my opinion that if that price were to get cut in half, its sales would SKYROCKET, by much more than double.

The price will lower to $10 - $15 on FEBRUARY.

My advice is to wait for the price drop.

but if price isn't an issue for you its definitely worth picking up NOW.

Price aside the game is pretty awesome and its totally what you'd expect or have hopes for. The amount of blocks and the gorgeous art style doesn't disappoint. 

The factions are very very unique from each other and each faction has different kinds of blocks/weapons/ship parts.This game is what Ive been hoping for! Its not overly complicated and and has about 6 or 7 factions at its current build.

It has a random/procedural generated galaxy and has an endless amount of galaxies via wormholes! ( wormholes are the means of travel into other new galaxies ) 

You can upload your fleet/ships and other players would see your ships invading their galaxy! Awesome right?!

For example: Id see a cool ship and if i hover my cursor over it I would be able to see the name of the player who made it and the name of of his ship!

Overall this game is very addicting and would even be more so when more parts are added in the future!

Id score this game a solid:

8.5-9/10 at its current build and could easily be a 10/10 with the more upcoming updates!

I hope this helped! Hurry up and invade my galaxy! I would love to destroy those puny ships of yours!

Denn man kann seine Flotten bauen wie man lustig ist und ist nicht an irgendwelche vorgefertigten Schiffshüllen gebunden, die dann nur mit Equipment bestückt werden. 

Man entwirft alles selber und hat dafür Punkte zur Verfügung, ähnlich wie bei Spore. Für Credits kann man die Punktezahl erhöhen und neue Teile freischalten. Insgesamt gibt es 3 verschiedene Ressourcen, die da wären: R (man kann es überall sammeln) C (bekommt man für aktivierte Stationen und abgeliefertes R) P (sind die Punkte die man zum Bauen für die Schiffe braucht, welche man für C eintauscht)

Die Stationen denen man die R Ressource bringt, werden ihre eigene Flotte aufbauen und ihre eigenständige Konflikte gegen den Feind führen, sofern welche in der Nähe sind. Mit der [Tab] Taste kann man für C auch Schiffe anheuern die einem dann folgen, dazu muss man sie einfach anklicken und dann wieder [TAB] zum abbrechen drücken. Besser ist aber selber eine Fabrik am Schiff einzubauen und eigene Schiffe zu erzeugen. Das kostet dann nur R.

Nicht jede Verbündete Station benötigt R, also fliegt einfach zu einer anderen, wenn sie nicht wollen, haben sie wohl genug. Am besten fliegt man zu Stationen nahe der Grenze zum Feind.

Leider ist das Spiel komplett auf Englisch, aber es erklärt sich fast von selbst. Wenn man beim Bauen eines Schiffs Schwierigkeiten hat, kann man sich die nötigen Tasten mit deren Erklärung einblenden lassen.

Alle Schiffe die man erstellt hat, werden von der Verbündeten KI nachgebaut und benutzt, sofern sie die benötigten Mittel hat.

It is so easy to get lost in Reassembly. I continually tweak, change, upgrade, rehash, redesign, and customize my ships. Its facinating to watch your own creation evolve as you gain access to more and more powerful weapons. Such a joy.
The world is vast in scope, colorful, busy, living and beautiful. The ""grind"" in this game is fun because you get to build, test and tweak your ship exactly the waty you want too.

There are three different ways to control the ship which can take some getting use too, but they all work very well. The art choice is stellar, and beautiful.

Reassembly is kind of the game that takes one and only one thing and does it very very well. In this case it's crazy custom ship skirmishes.
Target of the game is pretty simple - conquer the whole map. And all you have to accomplish that is you own ship, some raw resources and a couple of supporting space stations.
You have to farm (literally, they grow on space plants) resources, fight enemies, build your fleet and slowly proceed to the center of the map. That's a game in a nutshell. But, I want to stress this once more, the game does this one thing very VERY good.
Add here a nice async multiplayer - all players can share their ship builds online, and those shared ships will appear in other players' games. Which is pretty awesome if ask me.
But is it enough? Well, that's for you to decide. If you ask me - it definitely is.
Oh, and don't forget the amazing soundtrack!

It doesn't take long for you to realize that you are not alone, and, in fact, you have a whole faction that shares your own desire for expansion in the untamed universe. Unlike many in this loose genre, you fight side by side with your AI friends from beginning to end. 

Make no mistake, this is, at it's core, a block building game, where you build your spaceship, and can build fleets of custom ships to fight with you or just let them loose to go it on thier own. Where they will build more ships of thier own and fight the good fight for the faction gathering resources and growing your empire just like yourself. In many ways, when I play this I feel like just another small, but important, peice of a larger hive doing my part. Although I would like to think that I might contribute a little more than my AI companions, I hope. 

In Reassembly, you will explore, expland, exploit, and exterminate. Yes, this is, in fact, a 4X game, hidden underneath a very well crafted version of a top down space shooter.

You start on the edge of the galaxy where it's relatively safe, as you explore towards the center the enemies become bigger and way more powerful.

There are wormholes you can fly into. These will either take you to a fresh galaxy or send an AI controlled copy of your ship to other player's galaxies. My goal is not only to take over my own galaxy but be the bane of other galaxies as well :)

And boy is it a gem. The kind where it will suck you in for hours if you're not careful. As it is now in its beta phase, some new features are now part of the game. Most notably asynchronous Multiplayer.

This does not mean players will directly fight other players. Rather, it is still single player in that retrospect. What you do fight, are the ships that other players have spent countless hours, or a few seconds throwing together, in a big mashup found dotted about in the ecosystem.

You will find many different tactics and build strategies are required to best some of the more difficult enemies, and ultimately, your goal will be universal annihilation!! MWAHAHA!! Or at least that's my goal.

You can either wander aimlessly, killing everything you see, avoiding everything you see, copying everything, building everything, or just plain sit there while you watch hordes of allied AI ships, drones, and missiles beat the crap out of your foes in shiny balls of explosions!

There is a relatively small but lively community found on this game's forums, where the Developer himself, Arthur, runs and frequents.

One more thing! Every few weeks, there are design contests held where players can create ships to blow each other up in a big tournament! Further excitement is based solely on player discrecion.

Update! I forgot to mention some stuff

There are currently over 500 different parts, the player has direct access to about 40 of them. (the others are parts from other factions, of which there are 15)

You can fly around and kill things, design ships, and collect resources. There isn't much of a story mode, but there is a sandbox where you can spawn any faction and build with every part. (requires a basic level of coding knowledge)

The ai is incredibly smart. There are ai competitions every few weeks where players build ships to a certain danger level, then submit them to different classes, where they fight to the death round robin style, and the best 16 are pitted in a single elimination bracket for all to see.
From these tournaments, the developer (Arthur) works on tweaking the ai so that it can better fend for itself during battles, leading to more aggressive enemies.
The current system of ai smarts has to do with profile tags that are randomly assigned to each ai, some will get a ""bad aim"" tag, others might have ""Reckless"" or ""runs away"", and any combination of tags will eventually result in harder enemies. The hardest so far is one that has tags ""smart fire, reckless, dodges, chases""

Updates are between daily and monthly, it really depends on what's being changed. They are usually just a few megabytes, the game itself is only 160 mb.

The game runs very well in huge fights. Even with 1k ai (missiles, ships, drones) flying everywhere, there is hardly a noticeable tax on performance. (60 fps is average)

The balance is relatively good. The learning curve is not too steep, and starting newbies will be challenged to survive. and you will die, even if you try to play defensively, it's bound to happen.",1416948635,1417047300,True,76,5,0.798789143562316895,3,False,False,True,False,,,
