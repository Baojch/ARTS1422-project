The main goal is to fight very tight budget by completing contracts. These contracts requires you to use several programable tools to manufacture some more or less complex shape. Main challenge is to find a way to limit waste as much as possible otherwise you'll go bancrupt pretty fast. Also you don't have money to buy a lot of tools so you must think about which machines you have idle and which contract requires less investment.

Since it is an early access version there is quite small selection of contracts and tools, but I beleive there will be more tools acording to screenshots. Also there is no tutorial or such so figuring out how to do stuff is another part of challenge.

Die Idee hinter dem Spiel mag ja nicht schlecht sein. Die Umsetzung ist jedoch eine Katastrophe. Auch wenn das Spiel noch im Early Access ist, ist der Preis mit 20€ mehr als übertrieben hoch. Selbst bei 5€ müsste man noch überlegen, ob es gerechtfertig wäre.

Was sofort auffällt ist, es war einscheinend zu viel Arbeit das Icon und den Titel der Anwendung passend zum Siel zu ändern. Inhaltlich kaum Content, kein Tutorial und viele Bugs. 

Update: Das letzte Update erschien vor über einem Jahr (10. März 2016). Das Spiel scheint bereits im Early-Access-Status gescheitert zu sein.",1452708664,1501116232,False,4,0,0.581749081611633301,1,True,False,True,False,,,

If you happened to stumble on this game - avoid; Completely abandoned, littlle to no replay value, multiple crucial bugs; Shame; it had potential. Updated to note more recent reviews were made using one of free keys given on steam forums.

Update - June 11th 2016:
Unfortunatelly I cannot reccomend this game; While definatelly pleasant it gives the feel of being extremely far from being finished; While indeed many features were added to add to the industrialized feel and gameplay, once you [quite quickly] make sure your contracts are working it starts giving no true joy as there is no viable reason to optimiise; additionally - there's a machine that is akin to magic wand; easy to use and extremely powerful, with very low cost in comparison to usability; with some schemes being nearly [if not completely] impossible or unviable to produce without that tool game becomes reduced to 'how to use that specific machine'.

While I had high hopes this game would still be worked upon, I'm afraid it is not the case; Developer's activity on forums ceased shortly after question about roadmap; Maybe, just maybe it will be developed further; but honestly - I can't really say it's probable.


Previous reviews:

This game looks like it has a ton of potential, and is quickly improving; While I cannot reccomend this game just yet, both of updates since creation of this review adressed major problems. For time being pricing might be a little too high for what you can get [most of price is basically paid for promise of future content], yet this game's genre is quite niche. If you like games like this - feel free to get it, though don't get your hopes too high just yet.

In hindsight though - given the rate of change in this game - this deffinatelly has a ton of chances to get reccomendable very soon.

Below you can see the review I made before any updates for this game at the day of release.

==PREVIOUS VERSION OF REVIEW [first release]==
ok, while this game has a ton of potential - it's not yet ready for any release anytime soon; let's be honesst - construction system is raw; production lines leave a ton to be desired, most items initially produced are barely visible on production line; 
You can only identify wether or not stuff is working by extreme zoom, and ONLY if you have 'transport lines' that are not part of any module especially annoying with stuff like dropzone->exitzone pairing used with some basic contracts;
Also - production steps are very limited when it comes to production itself; I am wondering wether more machines are sheduled as for now - I am starting to worry about this games' future.
Added information:
I honestly DID try to make one turning slope but - line creation controls are extremely ineffective; they tend to overwirite whatever you have already set up; some machines do not care where input is, despite having quite easily identifiable 'production area' [part with 'lines'] - other machines do not always seem to have well identified operational method [saw comes to mind - 3 'line points' - which is input, which is output, which is both?]
stuff that is supposed to move stuff around also cuts it if moved to far; no reverse setting for machine that seems to have 2 pistons [one up and one ddown].
Additional problem - in windows 10 it tends to crash whenever you accept new contract; For more fun - only contracts tend to be saved via the crash automatically. 
Item track laying is at level that makes it barely usable. Case in point - Transport Tycoon [original one] despite having annoying [at times] track laying did not have as big problems when making very short range [1 block] curves that this one has; Making 3 or 4 curves in 4 blocks near another is almost impossible without using tools other than simple 'make route part' mainly because of lack of option of making half-routes. Did I mention this game's tracks ten to be bi-directional? in essence - items can go either way via them? I learned it in surprising way by not necesarily intentional messup of pushing item through wall of rotation system, that later fed that item [after rotating it] back through what was intended as input to this machine, straight to messed up transport line that originally pushed it through machine in question, repeating this cycle ad infinitum. Of course when I later pushed item directly though machine's wall [!] it worked - just as I listed - going ad infinitum.
Only when I pushed item through correct input [cursing midway due to deleting this machine twice due to how transport routes work] it worked as intended. I must admit I did ragequit at that point and decided to write this review without checking how exactly saw works, then again - I did not have trust in this games' engine for it to work as intended in the first place.

In short:
This is EXTREMELY early access; There's very little number of Early Access titles in so raw state. Problematic may be also the store page which focuses this pre-purchase towards music and sounds, that in my opionion - are least important problem of this game for now.
If you have trust in this developer - be my guest - try it; I am afraid I'll have to move to refound page, and check this game in few months, maybe it will be made much more user and player friendly and hopefully - polished at least a little.

For the record - I am big fan of production line/assembly line games, and I can't say I'm enjoying having to write this review, but I hope I'll save some factory fans some time with it.

UPDATE 1 : within a day of this review first update came fixing quite a few of these issues; while I did not see some changes that could help, it's a very good sign; let's see what happens next.

TL;DR - Not yet, wait a bit; it's changing for good.",1451737548,1516300034,False,20,0,0.720963776111602783,5,False,True,True,False,,,
