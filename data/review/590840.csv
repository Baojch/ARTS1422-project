The game is you play as a monster and eat people, and avoiding the military that tries to kill you, so you are  just trying to survive the longest and the best way to survive is by eating people to gain points to upgrade your monster some monster upgrades are short to max out and some are longer to max out.

The story is simple: a monster escapes an ancient barrier and now it is eating people and causing terror and the military is trying to destroy you the story is short but it has some funny moments within the cutscenes of the story.

The game has 3 game modes: arcade, story, and target practice, the arcade is just trying to see how long you can survive for and get a high score, the story is a campaign but short, and target practice is a game mode where you just practice your throwing/shooting skills.

When playing the game it can start out as slow but once you start to eat people that’s when things begin to go south, first wave policemen start shooting you and then the choppas, tanks, and other police force would appear as you progress further to the game, that is why the upgrade is there so you can last longer.

The game also comes with an additional 3 more monsters after you beat the story one monster is a lizard that can use its tongue to eat and launch objects, another a bird that can fly and finally a large snake. What makes each of these monster special is their advantages they have to change the play of the game like the lizard monster able to use its tongue to reach people to eat and able to shoot objects which make destroying choppas easier and the bird monster is best used for avoiding the military because it can fly  but the real game changer is when you unlock their special ability which can make destroying the military force a lot easier, it is fun and satisfying  using their special ability.

To be honest this game is best for a short play

But if you are a fan of giant monsters like me I recommend playing this game.
