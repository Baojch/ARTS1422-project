What a pile of dog-dookie this game is. This game seems half-ars*d and unfinished, and it doesn't seem to have anything that would compel you to play it for any longer than first couple of levels before you begin to start yawning.

Well, let's start with the good:

Pros
  - Starts up.
  - Uninstall works.

Cons
  - I had the Viveport version before and it was in Chinese only. Had to uninstall both and reinstall steam version to get English.
  - Boring combat, consisting of holding your melee weapon in the air and waiting for enemies to collide with it to take damage.
  - Combat has no feedback whatsoever. You feel disconnected from the ""action"" (or lack thereof) all the time.
  - (see above) sword/staff/wandplay feels like waving feather dusters at ethereal enemies.
  - Ranged combat (sorceress/wizard/scantily-clad bimbo only?) works whenever it wants to, and there are no means of aiming.
  - No sound, other than the ""plong"" menu sound effect. Yes, really. No sound whatsoever from enemies or combat.
  - Collecting loot is more difficult than defeating enemies.
  - Uninspired, generic enemies that don't do much other than waddle to you to get killed.
  - Movement and view direction control seems to work when it wants to. You never know which way you are facing after a teleport.
  - Weapons are pointing out in a ridiculous angle, instead feeling like a sword hilt they are pointing 45 degrees backwards which destroys any immersion there might ever have been (unlikely).

Looting stuff after defeating the boss sounds straightforward, but in reality it is so much worse.
You summon a large chest and throw the stuff enemies drop into it, and they should appear in your arsenal in the ""base"" after you exit the level.

Sounds neat, right? Quite simple?

No. Far from it. The problem is that the chest is deathly afraid to be touched by anything and as soon as you take anything even near it it decides to bounce into sky and fly all over the arena. If you unsummon it and resummon it, the lid will be clipping inside the chest, causing it to float in midair. Which makes tha already fickle thing even more scared of your loot. Trying to throw the items (which is impossible because items just practically drop straight down from your hand) into it makes either the chest or the loot fly 100 meters up in the air and land some time later on the other side of the arena.

This game is currently broken, and I would not recommend this to anyone. Ever. Not even if it was 99% off. Stay away from this garbage rip-off.

Its more about the loot and levelling than combat.
Enemy designs are pretty nice and there appears to be a large variety of spells and weapons.

It's got a relaxed pace and not so intense which is sometimes nice in VR.  
They need to fix the item box bug though.  It's almost game breaking not being able to reliably drop loot in the item box.  it does work if you keep at it, but sometimes It's so annoying that I just leave all my loot behind :(

EDIT: It appears that the game is now marked as an EA title. When this review was written the game did not show the Early Access indicator.

Well, one good thing I can say about this game is that the devs are great at making trailers... That's about as much praise as I can give this game. 

The combat is boring. The enemies are mindless and pose no threat even on ""Hard."" Spawns are too slow and you're frequently left standing around waiting for something to show up. That's saying nothing about the fact that you can just teleport into enemies or let them walk into your unmoving sword to kill them.

It's worse than a game that allows waggle, you just stand there! No waggle required!

The game is buggy. It's NOT an early access. The game is fully released but it still  has game breaking bugs like teleporting off the platform and getting stuck in the world with no way to exit the mission or reset yourself.

Mission progression does not advance if completing the mission on Hard instead of normal.

The UI interface continually resets, displaying incorrect information on your ""HUD' making you think you've made certain selections that you haven't. IE you play the wizard and finish a mission, you come back to your home base, your hands are now the paladins hands but you're still classified as a Wizard and can not interact with paladin UI elements or weapons.

The game lacks any polish. To the point that I feel it was a blatant cash grab. Sitting at a price tag of $16.99 I would have expected much more.

I'd love to talk about the audio, but there really wasn't any.

This game will be a rare refund. Usually I'd rather support the industry even if a game is not the greatest but this game was so unenjoyable and felt so half assed I can't help but feel like it was just a cash grab. That, I don't want to support.

I could go on but in short I will say: You probably don't want to buy this game.",1491421560,1491566556,False,18,1,0.723044753074645996,7,True,False,True,False,,,

I could understand this game being like it is if it was early access, but since it's not there's no reason for all the shortcomings.

Pros:
-Good graphics
-A decent attempt at classes/roles

Cons:
-Game is utterly boring (I killed every non-boss enemy by simply teleporting to them... didn't even have to swing my sword)
-Normal difficulty should be renamed extremely easy.  I never dropped below ~90% HP, and the arena was LITTERED with healing items.
-Poor weaponization.  The first new weapons that you get from boss kills are worse than the weapons that you start the game with... SMH
-Terrible hitboxes.  This may not be an issue for the spellcaster class, but for the melee class the mob hitboxes are nowhere near the actual mobs.
-No Locomotion.  Yet another VR game with only teleport movement.",1491375119,1491375119,False,20,0,0.716368556022644043,3,True,False,False,False,,,
