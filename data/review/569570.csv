       时间有限，关于后面要解锁游玩的章节就暂时不发表感想了。关于游戏战斗机制，我希望给以后可能入坑的朋友一点点小建议“使用力量去解决问题，还是用包容与理解去解决问题，决定权在自己手上。”你可以把他当做一个打怪升级变强的游戏来游玩，使用剑去守护这个世界。也可以让角色去击晕魔物或者兽人等等去避免冲突。我觉得这是这个游戏最大最大的优点之一，也是很温柔富有正能量的地方，初中时期的我游玩这个游戏还尚未有这个击晕避免战斗的机制，直到最近我上了大学在steam重新购买游玩这款游戏后才发现的新机制。这或许是挖掘NATE的潜在力量的新途径哦（小声，我可没有剧透）。
       我希望能让技能触发机制有更舒适的体验，判定条的速度有时候过快让我好几个回合都无法防御成功令我非常困扰（特指遇到小蝙蝠，最讨厌小蝙蝠了），我觉得在一些技能上对判定失败的惩罚可以稍微小一点，比如判定失败导致防御可能失败，而不是完全就没有防御到（比如NATE都拿起大盾牌去守护同伴了，这么大一面盾牌挡在身前总要能挡住攻击吧）然后就是提升判定成功的奖励，比如完美格挡，或者是TLOB的防护盾除了提供防御力以外，还提供了可以吸收一定伤害的保护罩（这样或许也比较符合漫画中的设定，而不是单纯的提升了防御力）。
       最后，我希望新的章节尽快做完，我已经有点点迫不及待了！也希望作者还有他的团队成员生活愉快，，，啊！对了！我超级想要游戏的周边，但是当时我还没有意识到游戏在steam搞活动，T恤，NATE公仔，我都没能拿到，真的很可惜很可惜！别看我游戏只玩了20小时多，算上我初中高中无限重玩的第一章，我或许已经玩了很多很多个小时了！所以希望以后也能有周边活动，我还想继续冲击娃娃公仔和T恤衫，最后穿着他们度过我人生中最幸福宝贵大学的四年！（And the last part of Evaluation wants to be seen by the game developers.：）   ）",1561899904,1561899904,True,2,0,0.525101780891418457,0,True,False,False,False,,,

As for the gameplay itself, it mostly consists of getting around via point and click interfaces where you click on a door/vent to get to another room, you click on toolboxes to get an item, you click on enemies to fight them, and sometimes you get to make a choice. 

Thats the whole game, which wouldnt be so bad if you could get the dialogue more than once for each thing there was something to say anything about, in case you missed something, or if thelayout and things you could interact with were set up in more of a puzzlesolving kind of way rather than beng so straight forward. 

The biggest problem with the gameplay though is how the battles were so boring and samey (ESPECIALLY when you take the pacifist route).

Light Apprentice - The Comic Book RPG, что это такое? Наверное только не шутер от первого лица. Поиграв, вы осознаете, что перед вами не просто красиво иллюстрированный комикс с анимационными вставками. Перед вами и визуальная новелла, и игровая книга, и стратегия, и ролевая игра, и классическая головоломка в стиле point-and-click. Самое смешное,это не сюжет, а сам факт того, что все эти жанры не мешают друг другу, создавая действительно уникальную и интересную игру. 

В игре есть три уровня сложности и всё они так или иначе изменят игровой процесс. Например легкий режим напрочь уберет все сражения, давая игроку по полной мере проникнуться сюжетом. Средний даст возможность участвовать в пошаговых баталиях ограниченное количество раз. А вот сложный режим, это настоящее испытание, без боя пройти не получиться и каждый путь будет лежать через стратегические пошаговые бои. Вы подумаете: ""А зачем мне это? Красивая игра, хочется просто насладиться сюжетом."". А не тут то было. Видите ли, развитие сюжета, формирование персонажей, дружба или вражда с теми или иными существами, за частую будет проходить посредством вашего личного выбора. Драться или обойти. Спасти или убежать. Пройти здесь или найти другой путь. Всё будет зависеть от вас. В какой-то степени легкий режим заберет у вас возможность в той или иной степени влиять на сюжет. Разве вы этого хотите? Вы человек рожденный побеждать и вы хотите проверить свои силы, и тут у вас будет такая возможность.

Пошаговые бои встречаются довольно часто, но именно здесь они уникальны. Каждая атака, каждая способность или примененный элемент требует вашей реакции, да-да, именно реакции. Дело в том, что помимо выбора героя, его способности и направления атаки, непосредственно во время её исполнения, вам предстоит то вовремя нажать кнопку в сужающемся круге, то быстро нажимать левую кнопку мишки и это только самое элементарное, обвод фигур мышью, зачистка экрана курсором от летающих элементов и многое другое будут ждать вас в весьма разнообразных боях с огромным обилием различных врагов. 
Со временем персонажи будут улучшаться, игра то и дело будет переходить в режим point-and-click, где вам придется решать головоломки, например, на поиск предметов или обходного пути. Искать тайники, в которых будет лежать новое вооружение или полезные снадобья. Экипируйте каждого члена отряда и двигайтесь по замечательной истории, которая будет развиваться от ваших решений и действий. 

По сюжету, ученик Нейт, просыпается спустя 300 лет сна в мире, в котором бушует война. Окружающая среда планеты повреждена и в скором времени будет уничтожена. И только у Нейта и еще четырех учеников есть ключ к восстановлению баланса и спасению мира.
Игра отлично подойдет любителям всех перечисленных в статье жанров, так как каждый из них отлично вписывается в игровой процесс и играет свою весомую роль. Человек, который плохо знаком с данными жанрами, также сможет насладиться игрой, так как выбрав легкий режим, перед ним будет забавный, отлично нарисованный комикс с интересным и затягивающим сюжетом.

Light Apprentice is a game that mixes multiple genres together. Most notably are RPG’s, Adventure Games and Visual Novels. The game’s story plays out like a comic book with various panels showing various scenes. Battles also take place within the boxes of the comic book, as does the exploration phase.

The story follows a young man from the past named Nate and a blueling called Tlob as they journey across a barren wasteland of a planet to save the environment and the people that live there. The story is very environmentalist friendly and it talks about various issues that impact our own planet today. It also covers themes like slavery, greed and imperialism.

Even though the story covers these rather serious topics, it does so in a way that makes it enjoyable yet poignant. It doesn’t feel forced and the characters are great as well. The story in this volume is 4 chapters long and I imagine that there will be much more story to this game in the future.

The gameplay portion of the game is split into two different areas. The first area focuses on exploration and plays like a point and click adventure game. In this mode you can interact with the world, activate switches, open doors and chests, and attack enemies.

The second portion of the game is combat. Combat in Light Apprentice plays somewhat like Costume Quest mixed with some Final Fantasy (Classic FF). You have the option to attack, defend, use items or use skills. Skills are unlocked whenever you need to make an important choice in the story and each requires a specific amount of spirit to use. Spirit is obtained when you hit an enemy or when an enemy hits you. The max spirit you can have at any time is 10. The stronger the skill, the more spirit you’ll need to use it. You’re also limited to 3 potions during a battle and they don’t replenish automatically so if you use one you’ll need to manually add a new one.

If you happen to die in battle the game gives you the option to replay the battle until you defeat it.

I’ll also mention that the game can be pretty buggy at times. Most notably in the first and fourth chapter. There are random slowdowns in both which affects playability.

Overall, Light Apprentice has been an enjoyable adventure. Like a few other games that I’ve reviewed, the game touches upon real world issues. It’s done really well and in a pretty lighthearted way. The story is entertaining but poignant and I felt it was done really well. The slowdowns that I encountered were a bit of a pain (Especially in chapter 4) but most of the game played well for me. I definitely recommend the game but it might be wise to wait for a couple patches to fix these issues first.

I've actually never played a game quite like this, it's a mix of turn-based RPG, Comic Book (Virtual Novel?), and a Point and Click adventure. The way the game plays is very interesting and you even unlock specific skills based on the choices you make during the story.

I found the story to be quite interesting and the comic panel style of the game along with the gorgeous art helped show the story of the game to you in a really easy to understand way.

The combat was good and also challenging at times but could feel a bit sluggish after a while.

One thing I wasn't very fond of was how the game saves. There are certain points in the story where it will save but you never really know when they will happen so you never know for sure if you quit how much you will have to repeat.

I'm currently over halfway through the game. From the feel of things, there's probably 9 - 10 hours of gameplay in all with the main story and a set of quests to play as well. The quests are outside of the main story but do affect your story characters in terms of gaining exp and items.

I would definitely recommend this game, however, this is also available for free on Android and iOS. It's so unique that anyone who enjoys a good story and RPG should check it out. The way the game is designed actually plays decent on PC but I imagine it would be slightly better on mobile just because of how it works and how all the mini-games are touch based (or mouse click & drag based).",1510670189,1666879293,True,9,0,0.577867805957794189,0,False,True,False,False,,,

The planet is going to be destroyed if nothing is done! And you later discovered there are 4 other light apprentices like Nate who can save the planet.

unfortunately, the bug support is extremly poor. (see updates)
Many people have complaint about it but no dev is taking care of it since last update (May). The devs seem to have abandoned the game altogether. A shame really. This game could become a franchise, but with that attention to bug reports, I don't think they are gonna get the respect from the gaming community.

update11.15.2017: 
the dev has been very supportive since my review and they have released several fixes since then. 
It seems that for now all the issues have been resolved. Dev has been very open to discuss the game's issues and he released the last fix yesterday after I submited a new bug report.
I'll update again when I finish the game :)
At this stage I can recomend the game.
Can't wait to see what you have in store for the next volume iggy :D

update 13.10.2017:
My save file in lv 4 is still bugged (no habilities and lower level characters). it's impossible to beat the game with this bug cuz you are just terribly underleveled for the battles in chapter 5. Thus, I deleted it and started all over again.
New bug found in the new playthough. Can't go further than the 3 chapter in the conversation with the toads. Another save file killer bug. Can't progress further into the game.

Its presentation is creative and very strong thematically, switching seamlessly between 1D story segments and 3D scenes where you can explore the world around you, solve puzzles, and battle.[/h1]

https://youtu.be/OViKIreIRjs

This is an Early Access Report, meaning that it will be revised after the game leaves Early Access.

[h1]What it Offers Now[/h1]

[b]Adhesion to a presentation style.[/b] Even the 3D world is connected by boxes, much like a comic strip. When you’re exploring, the camera slides between panels the way one’s eye would when reading. So cool.

[b]Four playable chapters and a story about an adventure that is not only engaging, but touching. [/b]It’s your typical save the world situation, but the story is well written nonetheless. The presentation style really helps in delivering the significance of the events that occur. Combat scenes, reflections of the past, and  exchanges between characters are all presented in still images over which the text appears and then the next panel is presented when you click.

A party of young adventurer who you’ll grow fond of over the course of their journey. 

[b]Turn-based combat with a twist.[/b] There are mini games associated with every skill and spell and a timing ring when you attack or defend. This makes it so that 

[b]A morality system that is swayed one way or another by how you handle combat situations.[/b] You can kill every monster in sight or you can stun them and make a run for it, leaving them unscathed. You could even do a combination of the two—the decision is yours.

[b]Light RPG elements.[/b] Your character levels up and gains stats. You have no control over distribution, unfortunately. You also find equipment in chests, which can be equipped to your characters. Only the weapons are character-specific.

[b]Puzzles to solve. [/b]These come up in the normal course of play and range from finding items from a list to circumventing obstacles in order to progress. Much of the time, the answer to these puzzles can be found by exploring the surrounding area.

[b]A great soundtrack.[/b] It's seriously catchy and oftentimes I'll recognize the base tune even though it's been sped up, slowed down, or changed in pitch to suit the scene it accompanies. I really, really like it.

[h1]What it Promises[/h1]

Improvements based on player feedback. As such, here's my list of suggestions:

[list][*] More skills. I love the minigames and I'd like to see more of them.
[*] Crafting. Just finding equipment and equipping it isn’t satisfying. They’re few and far in between and they don’t seem to have much effect. 
[*] Balancing. Most combat results in defending until the enemy stunned and then either attacking or forgiving them because the enemies hit harder than you can until you unlock Mia. If there was a quicker way to handle enemies or do more damage (because even the spells and special skills don’t pack much of a punch).
[*] A way to replay chapters. You have to start a new file in order to do so and, since you can learn different skills by choosing different dialogue options, it would be useful if you could restart whenever.
[*] Quest improvements. The chibi main characters is a nice start, but it would be nice if quests weren’t just a series of battles. This is an opportunity to add in more mini games and possible objectives like “find this” or “make it to here.” 
[*] Sound effects. This is minor, but the weird, hollow knock that results when you click an enemy to start a battle leaves much to be desired. Even a small clip from the battle theme (think Pokemon) would be an improvement. [/list]

.Closing Thoughts.

As is, Light Apprentice is a fun, polished experience that offers a little something to spice up your turned-based combat. The game’s comic book presentation is strong, both as really cool aesthetic as well as a storytelling device and the story itself is one that is well worth reading.

If you’re looking for a story with plenty of heart and a cast of likeable characters, you’re in for a treat. While the game is very linear, it makes up for it by including decisions that change the skills your characters can learn.

If you’re looking for a lighter RPG experience where you can focus on the story, this is a solid title to pick up.

[b]Genre:[/b] Turn-based RPG Adventure
[b]Difficulty:[/b] Medium-Hard

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]Rating:[/b]7/10
The main game consists of two modes, adventure mode and battle mode.
Adventure mode is a point-and-click mode, where you move around interacting with different objects and characters.
Battle Mode is a turn-based combat mode, where the player will select which potion, spell, ability or attack to use on the enemy. 

The battles in Battle Mode can be won in two different ways. 
The pacifist way, where you will drain their stamina and thereby stunning them. Once all enemies are stunned at the same time the battle can be won peacefully. 
The aggressive way, where you will drain their health and thereby killing them. Once all enemies are killed the battle is won.

Each attack, spell and ability has it own unique mini-game and success in the mini-game determines the degree of success (or failure) the attack, spell or ability has. This is where the games origins can be seen the most, as this game was ported from mobile to PC and the mini-games shows this. This is not a mad thing, the game has full mouse integration and the only issue you may encounter is timing and precision. 

The few puzzles there is in Adventure Mode is fairly straight forward.

[h1]Narrative[/h1]
[b]Rating:[/b]8/10
The Narrative is presented in cut-scenes in the form of animated comic book pages.
The player is presented with multiple choices along their journey which influences how the story turns up in the story and which abilities different characters learns.
The story is brilliantly written. it will make you laugh and cry and everything in between.

[h1]Visual Presentation[/h1]
[b]Rating:[/b]8/10
As previously mentioned cut-scenes are shown in the form of animated comic book pages. The adventure mode and combat mode is pre-rendered 2.5D with bright colors in a cartoon style.

[h1]Audio Presentation[/h1]
[b]Rating:[/b]7/10
The music is most fitting for the game. The music in cut-scenes drives the emotion and the music in combat mode has your adrenaline pumping. The sound effects are top quality and very fitting for the game.

[h1]Final Score[/h1]
[b]Rating:[/b]7.5/10
If you are looking a great take on classic RPG adventure games with an amazing story, adorable graphics, relatable characters and lovely music, this is the game for you.

因为剧情都是漫画的形式所以体验剧情的途中就和看漫画一样非常的有趣。可爱的人物设计和救世英雄的题材也很吸引我。
在提出了问题之后，官方在很短时间内就修复了了药水方面的问题以及添加难度选择，这样让想要体验剧情的玩家就轻松了很多。
在回合战中，使用技能是通过各种小游戏来增加的趣味性，像第二章才有的说服技能，说服成功后减低敌人的防御，当遇到高hp的敌人就能轻松获胜。
第三章还没开始玩，似乎目前只有四章，总之，非常的期待后面的剧情发展，以及可以的话希望能有中文版。 
I managed to enter chapter 3 since the latest update and finally I can officially brag about this fantastic game!
The story of this game is told in a comic-book like way, which really gives me a lot of fun. The adorable characters and the heroic theme are also very attractive to me.
After I had commented last time with the problems I encountered in the game, the developer responded in a surprisingly quick way with fixing the potion issue and adding selectable difficulty levels. That is really helpful for the players who are eager to know about the story.
In the battle mode, skills are used through mini-games, which is really interesting. For example, the negotiating skill since chapter 2, it is really useful for the challenging enemies because it can lower their defense. 
I haven't started chapter 3 yet, and the whole game now seems to only contain 4 chapters. I very much look forward to the story in the future chapters. And, I do hope there can be a Chinese version (not a google translate one) in the future, if it's possible.

献给我人生中的第一个差评以及评测区的第一个差评。
首先，就整体而言我非常的推荐这款游戏。
这款游戏的即时按键战斗以及绘本漫画风格的剧情过场是吸引我购买的主要原因，更何况还有可爱的人设。
然后问题就来了，在战斗中迷宫里得到的药品数量非常的少，然后一旦使用之后就再也没有了，这都没有什么，结果第二章剧情里和队友分开行动，好吧，没有了奶妈还没有药那就只能重打了，什么你说他是自动存档的？而且没法选择关卡重新玩？好气哦！！！
所以现在我就很气，非常，等改掉了这个问题我再决定把评价改过来 : )
This is my first negative review since I signed in Steam, and the very first negative review ever in my whole life.

First thing first. I would like to recommend this game as a whole.

Its quick time gameplay and comic book art style attracted me, along with its lovely characters.

And then comes its fatal problem: in the dungeon you can only get a tiny amount of potions, and there's no way to replenish if you run out of them. What's worse, you have to go on separate missions with your team mates, that is, you'll have no access to a character with healing skills. No nurse, no HP potions, and you die. Game over. And you have to play again - and here comes the real problem: you can't save the game manually, your can't choose from the chapters to begin with. You'll have to start from the very beginning. All over. Again.

This title (at the time of writing) still has a degree of things that need patching: small bug fixes, control elements and occasional graphics glitches which can - if unprepared - detract from the overall experience.

However.

This game oozes creativity, genuinely-likeable characters (Tlob the Blueling holds a special place in my heart) - and a story which does keep pace rather nicely, the gaming equivalent of a real page-turner, where your choices really do feel like they have significant impact. I played this game through solidly from beginning to end because I genuinely wanted to keep going, which is something that happens less and less often, I am finding, sadly!

[i]Light Apprentice[/i] is a roleplaying game with a story told in a comic book style. It’s a fun game with likeable characters fighting to try and save the world. An important feature is that of choices as what you do during the game affects your play style and story. I enjoy games where “choices matter” and in this RPG they can literally affect which skills you can and cannot use in battle which helps shape your characters and gameplay styles. While the game premiered on mobile devices, I played the Steam release on my computer. My review is based on the Early Access build, and -at the time of publication- only volume one is available to play. I’ll update this when the game changes.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story starts of with a young girl named Tlob, who is a mage and healer, looking for the Light Apprentice who happens to be our main character Nate. Nate has been in suspended animation for three hundred years and the world he awakens to is not what he remembers. War and pollution have ruined the once beautiful planet and Nate vows to set things right with Tlob’s help, doing so means finding the other Apprentices. The story is a bit heavy handed with its environmental message and the moral system of “choices matter” pressures the player to not be a jerk.

As of this moment, there is only one volume of the story available to play, the game promises three in total. This first story arc mainly serves to introduce us to the characters and the world around them. Besides Nate and Tlob there is also Mya, the Fire Apprentice, and K-Ken who half human and half monster. While we get some flashbacks for Nate, this volume doesn’t have much in the way of character development aside from showing us their basic personalities. For me, the story started off slow but built up as things progressed leaving me wanting more.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The first thing players will notice about this game is there are two modes. The story mode which feels like a comic book, and the adventure mode where you wander around and fight bad guys. On the computer, I played with my mouse since I didn’t feel the need to use a controller, but it’s an option, and a nice option to have. Battles are turn-based, however, and to perform attacks or skills or even defend you have to pay attention to the screen because of quick time mini games. You’ll either love them or hate them, I was personally alright with them but they became tedious. It seemed very gimmicky and tacked on; it probably made more sense on mobile. 

As mentioned before it takes a “choices matter” approach. During the story mode this can be choosing to take a certain side in a conflict to figuring out what is the best way for Mya to make money in town. It isn’t always expressed which chose is the best or even what might happen. Taking the side of a corrupt politician or a race of creatures who have been slaves sounds easy, figuring out if Nate or Tlob should talk to frog people not so much. Your choices affect how the story flows and also certain ones unlock certain skills. Choices also matter in battle, you can fight aggressively or passively which means defending and then “forgiving” the enemy. This was my biggest issue. I found the battles to often be unbalanced to the point where I had no choice but to defend just to survive. There are no random encounters so grinding isn’t easy and your stats are directly affected by the gear your character wears which you can’t purchase, only find. By the end of the first volume I had a very unbalanced team and couldn’t even bother to use skills often because I needed the energy for healing just to keep people alive.

[h1]Graphics/Audio[/h1]
The story itself is mainly told through a comic book presentation with panels and dialogue. The artwork is colorful and inviting, perfect for gamers of all ages. The adventure mode and battles have a more 3D feel to them and all of the animation in the game is pretty smooth. Monster design is a bit repetitive but this isn’t a huge issue at all. The game has no voice acting in it but does have a wonderful soundtrack that fits the aesthetics very well. I honestly have nothing negative to say at all in terms of graphics and audio, for a game originally on mobile devices it ports beautifully to the PC.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Lovely graphics and music. 
+ Comic book-style storytelling method really works well.
+ Choices truly matter and help shape the game you play.
+ Story is well written and a tale of caution and hope.
+ Characters are enjoyable to follow on their adventure.

[h1]Cons[/h1]

- I found the battles to be frustrating and sometimes limiting in how I could play.
- No Steam trading cards or achievements at the moment.
- Currently the price does not match the amount of content the game offers.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
[i]Light Apprentice[/i] shows a lot of promise. It has what all good RPGs need, a solid story with interesting characters. Whatever issues I have with the gameplay weren’t enough to stop me from completing volume one because I wanted to see where the story went. It’s a fresh take on the role playing game, giving players more control over how their experience plays out. As it’s still Early Access there may be some glitches, but I didn’t find any game-breaking ones. While I do feel the price is a bit steep for the game in its current state, I feel the completed version will be worth it in the end.

[b] • Beautiful Art [/b] (art style is simple and manga-like, art is colorful, and sometimes big or minimalistic, despite the simplistic chibi-like art, you can describe emotion on the faces and gestures of the main characters, even when it's in a still-image)

 

[b] • Gameplay is fun, addictive and Rpg-like [/b] (it's simple and only requires the mouse or one controler, few buttons, descriptive tutorial, and diferent ""minigame events"" for diferent skills) 



[b] • Point and Click and Visual Novel style game [/b] (it's also a point'n'click game, click in the enviroment to read characters toughts, get itens or go to another level, and you can also compare it as a Visual Novel, follow story and make choices to change it as you play)



[b] • It's a comic book in game form! [/b] (The game acts as a comic-book with every scene as a ""panel"", also the game allows you to go back and check previous scenes just like a comic book)



[b] • Writing is simple and fun [/b] (it has a nice and entrailing story, sometimes simple, sometimes dark, sometimes funny, sometimes sad)



[b] • Perfect Checkpoint locations [/b] (it auto-saves before important events) 



[b] • The ""Choice"" feature [/b] (in this game you have some ""moral choices"" sometimes in cutscenes like ""kill"" or ""forgive"", and mostly in-battle where you can choose to attack an enemy and kill it, or you can defend and weaken the enemy, prompting to have a ""Forgive enemy"" choice)

My previous complaints were that the way the inventory system works can potentially leave you in a spot that makes it impossible to progress.  In short, whenever you use an item in your inventory that item is gone forever, even if you exit the game and reload.  As it turns out, there is a way to acquire more healing potions and other items necessary to progress, though the way you do so, while allows you to avoid getting stuck forever, brings with it a whole host of lesser problems.  Basically, there's a ""Quest Mode"" in the main menu, which you can hop on over to at any time and fight a series of enemies which allows you to grind for XP and healing items.  The obvious problem with this is that it basically forces the player to exit the main game and grind the items necessary to continue.  And while I have nothing against grind, so long as it's optional and the player is allowed to do it at their own volition, it is never a good idea to force the player into doing it.  Because while there are people out there who find the exercise fun (I being among them) there's a whole host of others who will find it very tedious and very tiring very fast.  To a lesser annoyance, this mechanic also forces you to exit the main game mode and play what basically amounts to a side activity before you can continue, which breaks the flow of the game somewhat.  The annoyance is lessened in this instance since the loading screen are few and brief, and you'll be back in the main meat of the game relatively quick, but it's still there, and I still can't help but feel this whole problem could be avoided simply by allowing items to respawn after you die in combat, or reload your game.

Now this has been a lot of negativity so far, but I put it up front because these were serious problems which prevented me from enjoying the game as fully as I'd like to, and the last thing I want to do is give the impression that this game is not worth your time, because it absolutely is.

The combat mechanics are very well executed, similar to other turn-based games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Stick of Truth.  And like all good turn based RPG's you'll start off being able to get through by bashing your way through brute force, but sooner or later you will have to adopt a strategy to go along with muscle, and you'll need to think through each of your actions in order to succeed.  It starts off simple enough but quickly becomes more complex and difficult as more characters are introduced and new combat mechanics are thrown in.  Turn based strategy nerds will find themselves right at home here, and there's also a nice learning curb for newcomers as well.

What sets this game apart from its contemporaries, however, is the unique art style and overall aesthetic of game and story.  It literally feels like you're playing a comic book, which may sound like a concept which has been done before, but not like this.  Infamous was done in a comic book style, but it didn't feel like you were playing a comic book.  TellTale games are done in comic book styles, but they don't feel like you're playing a comic book.  This, from beginning to end, feels like you're literally playing a comic book.  From the cartoony art style of the characters to the how the whole story is told using speech bubbles and pop-up text, to how every cutscene and even gameplay sections are transitioned using comic book panels, every detail has been fine tuned to give off this vibe colorful comic book goodness.  The developer really should be applauded for how much thought went into every detail to make the game feel this way.

Story wise, Light Apprentice is your basic fantasy affair, though with some slight alterations to make things a little more interesting.  You play as Nate, a boy who's been trapped in time for a few hundred years, and is suddenly awakened in order to save the world with his mystical power granted to him by the earth.  Yes, I'd be lying if I said I didn't see the avatar similarities as well.  But where avatar was sort of Disneyfied in its storytelling Light Apprentice is a little darker, allowing you to choose whether to kill or spare your opponents and even decide on some other moral choices throughout the plot.  These moral choices spice up the story, though they're not really as complex as we've seen in other games like The Walking Dead, nor are they played around with like they were in Undertale.  It's a good addition to the game, but not as well implemented as it could be.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game, especially if you're one for a good story and unique style this is a definite buy for you, and I look forward to what the developer has in store for this game as well as their future endeavors.",1489891612,1489990094,True,11,0,0.608523726463317871,4,True,False,True,False,,1489921763.0,"Hi!

Derfor følte jeg også at det var oplagt at tage et kig på Amazu Media’s nye spil som er et historie drevet rollespil fortalt gennem en tegne serie.

Førstehånds indtryk af spillet kan findes her:
https://youtu.be/5O9pVHLlA14

Light Apprentice finder sted på en post-apokalyptisk planet, der har skulle være beskyttet af flere Lærlinge. Lærlinge er uddannet i magi og kamp - men de er på mystiskvis forsvundet. Den eneste undtagelse er spillets hovedperson Nate (Light Apprentice). Han vågner op dybt under jorden, hvor han møder en magiker ved navn TLOB. Sammen sætter de to sig for at undslippe deres underjordiske fængsel, og forhåbentlig kunne finde de andre lærlinge.

Light Apprentice præsenterer sig selv som en tegneserie, der lader dig som spiller arbejde dig igennem historien som et ""point & click"" spil, med lette toner fra rollespil genren ved brugen af exp, items og levels. Begge scenarier lader dig ofte fortage tur baserede kampe med historiens fjender som slims, lizards og uhyggelige skygge væsner.

Spillet er den første volume i en serie på 3, som alle sammen kommer til at indeholde 4 kapitaler. Og efter at have spillet historien i del 1 færdig, kan jeg ikke vente på del 2 som udviklerne satser på bliver tilgængelig til sommer. 

Kamp systemet i Light Apprentice er bestemt også noget for sig selv med unikke tiltag. I dine kampe, kan du lave almindelige angreb, forsvare dig og bruge magi i form af forskellige elementer eller færdigheder. 
Spillet er en port fra den mobile verden hvor den er tilgængelig på både iOS og Android, og det kan desværre tydeligt mærkes på nogle af de tiltag som spillet byder på. Som at udføre dine bedste eller special angreb, hvor skal du trykke på musen eller controlleren på det rigtige tidspunkt, lidt som et QTE. Dette fungere dog bedre på de mobile touchskærme, og jeg er flere gange blevet lettere frustreret over måden udvikleren har valgt at overføre håndteringen af færdigheder på, til PC. Kamp systemet, fandt jeg til tider en smule ensformigt og kedeligt. Specielt når man bare ønsker at få nedlagt de pågældende fjender i en fart for at komme videre i historien.

Den grafiske stil der er holdt gennem spillet falder måske ikke i alles smag, personligt var jeg meget betaget af den lidt grynet, og kantede tegnestil, som virkelig gav mig følelsen af og sidde med en anderledes og god tegneserie. Det er dog anbefalelsesværdigt at samle spillet op på iOS eller Andriod, så man ikke er afhængig af og skulle sidde foran computeren. Jeg foretrækker mine tegneserie i sengen eller på sofaen. 

Historien er interessant og rigtig godt fortalt gennem de små tegneserie sekvenser, og scorer alene top karakter hos mig, specielt da jeg kom til kapitel 2, hvor historien virkeligt tager fart og jeg blev for alvor fanget, af Nate og Tlob’s eventyr. Det er vigtigt at huske at spillet er i early access og under udvikling, så der vil løbende blive tilføjet mere til historien muligvis i form af nye ændringer i kapitlerne. 
Spillet er et super godt koncept og karaktererne er så tilpas interessante, til at man har lyst til at bruge tiden på at planlægge sine kampe omhyggeligt.

Light Apprentice er et spil der er værd at holde øje med hvis man har en svaghed for en god historie fortalt på en anderledes måde. Prisen er tilpas og lægger sig godt op af prisen på en god tegneserie. Første del i historien giver dig 3-5 timers spil tid alt efter hvor hurtig du er til at læse og få overvundet de fjender du støder på. Efter at have gennemført historien valgte jeg at gennem spille historien igen, for at prøve de andre valg som man løbende bliver stillet overfor. Dette var bestemt ikke noget jeg fortryder, da det gav mig et endnu dybere indblik i det fantastiske univers som Amazu Media har skabt med denne titel.

Jeg vil helt klart anbefale Light Apprentice, det er en af de titler der uden tvivl har overrasket mig mest i 2017. Historien og spillets interessante blanding mellem tegneserie format og turbaseret action sekvenser giver oplevelsen af en meget velovervejet og færdigt produkt.",1489792418,1490173452,True,2,0,0.508952021598815918,0,False,True,True,False,,,
