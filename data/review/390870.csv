[h1]Overall Rating - Seriously Flawed ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ[/h1]

[h1]First Impressions[/h1] 
I'm trying to remember which bundle I got Circuit Breakers (CB) from, but it must have been from a while ago since I can't seem to figure that out. Due to it having local coop available, it was one I had set aside for when I had a friend over, so that would make sense. Having tried another game earlier that day, which he hadn't liked very much, it wound up that after trying CB, I was the one that wasn't so thrilled by the experience. Playing the other game on my own, I found it just as fun by myself, but when I gave this game another shot to see if I was being too harsh, my initial reaction didn't change any. 


[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 
Starting off, there's two main game modes. Arcade, which is the stage clearing, roguelite portion of the game. Wavebuster is CB's take on a TD game, and although its functional, the game wasn't originally designed around this idea, so it would only be there to pass some time if you got bored. Score Attack is an additional mode under the Extra menu, where you play through a handful of stages with more enemies spawning than normal so you can get a high score. However, no matter which mode you play, you will only have access to one gun at any time, based on what character you picked. Stages can spawn power-ups, such as health refills and even a gun upgrade, but you'll always rely upon a single weapon. 

When killing enemies they'll drop white pellets called energium, and if you collect enough of them, your weapon will increase a level up to a max of three. The reason this doesn't work is that energium is also used as the ammo for your gun, and upgrading the gun requires you to fill the magazine to the top and get a few more pellets for the level up. If the upgrade included some bonus ammo or you had a weak secondary weapon with infinite ammo to swap between, you could make this work. However, with the upgrade system overlapping with your ammo, for the sole weapon you can use to kill enemies, you're constantly undermining yourself. Not killing enemies isn't an option, as they won't time out or die to stage hazards, so you have to use your upgrade potential to shoot them. I really dislike this system. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800439491
[h1]Controls[/h1] 
Although you can play CB like a twin stick shooter, you don't strictly have to, as the face buttons will also fire your weapon. Either way, your character can only fire in eight cardinal directions. I won't pretend that twin stick shooters always have great aim when you can shoot freely, but this strict limitation favors a certain movement and approach on how you face enemies, especially since you'll try to be conserving your ammo instead of constantly firing. So it's functional, but I can't say I love how it pairs up with the gameplay. 


[h1]Story[/h1] 
I would have expected some storyline behind the game, but you just jump in and start killing robots. The lack of framing or a significant sense of progression makes the gameplay all the more repetitive. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800439215
[h1]Visuals[/h1] 
Considering the name of the game, along with how arenas and bosses look, CB has the appearance of taking place within a computer or a system like it. Although they're a bit simple looking, I appreciate the stylized appearance and aesthetic that the developers were going for. I'll admit though, this theming seems underutilized since it could have easily developed into a story about a task force that attacks hostile forces in the digital realm. Since they probably have their own concept of what's taking place, why not expand on it and share it with the players? 


[h1]Sound Design[/h1] 
Frankly, I had to really go out of my way to notice the music because the gunfire drowns out most of it. I believe there's a few different tracks available, and the order they're played in might be randomized, but it's hard to tell. Since the audio balancing is askew all I can really say is that the songs sounded alright when I could make them out, but is largely irrelevant since few will likely notice it at all. However, it did have a tendency to drone on when I was able to make it out. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800439768
[h1]Pros[/h1] 
üåü There's a handful of starting characters to play as, each with their own unique weapon, such as a missile launcher and laser beam. More can be unlocked by completing challenges (basically achievements) through the game, such as killing 20 bosses. From some of the terms used, it may also unlock different variants of the main game modes. 
üåü The character challenges give you something to focus on while playing. 
üåü It has local and online four player coop available. 


[h1]Cons[/h1] 
‚ùå The upgrade system makes you second guess your instincts to shoot enemies and protect yourself. After all, if you can hold back, you might be able to power up your weapon, but you've gotta carefully conserve your ammo and shots to make that work. It's one thing to reward accuracy and ammo management, but I don't think this is the right way to do it. 
‚ùå I really dislike the enemies that rocket toward you, because when you're being cornered, it's hard to pick them off amongst all the other enemies. 
‚ùå Some of the stages you fight in are small and cramped, which really puts you at a disadvantage. 


[h1]Tips[/h1]
üîç It's tempting to not fire your weapon, but that's a fool's bargain. Shooting your weapon as enemies are around will help keep their numbers manageable, and you can worry about your ammo and upgrading the gun when you're in a more favorable situation. 
üîç No matter what, you'll lose a gun level if you take any damage. Therefore it's always ideal if you can avoid that. Better to make use of a stronger gun by firing it than trying to be too stingy, getting hit, and losing the level anyways. 
üîç If you play coop, you can stagger respawns to keep all players in the game. However, doing this will lead to everyone being weak, and may not be very feasible. 


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] 
It might sound extreme to state that one mechanic can make or break a game, but choices like this can and will change how the entire game plays, as well as what attitude the player takes towards it. For instance, Heavy Bullets (HB) places a strict bullet count on the player, which is more harsh than how CB plays. However, that game very carefully designs the stage layout and enemy encounters around that system, and makes for intense, skill focused gun fights, where every shot counts, and determines whether you'll love or hate that game. 

To be fair, HB isn't for everybody. The same is true here, and unfortunately wasn't a decision that made for gameplay people really appreciate. I don't recommend it, as though people can overcome and master it, it's not made in a way that invigorates the player. My play time has been inflated by card farming, as I got bored of it before too long.

I can't remember when I got this, but I do remember I got it for free. If the game itself was currently free, or much cheaper than it currently is, I could [i]maybe[/i] recommend it. But as it stands, I can't in good conscience recommend [i]Circuit Breakers[/i] at this price. It's a bullet hell where you fight in futuristic environments against evil robots, which sounds fun enough, right?

There are two strange design decisions the game makes that sink it for me. The first is the very odd control scheme; have you ever wanted to play a twin stick shooter without a mouse? This game uses WASD to move and the arrow keys to shoot. This limits you to eight directions, and takes away from what could be a fun experience by restricting your speed and accuracy - and in a bullet hell, those are two qualities that are required. Second, the game's upgrade system is tied to accuracy. Your weapon is upgraded as you kill people, but upgrade XP is used up whenever you shoot, so if you have upgraded your machine gun weapon to the version that sprays in all directions, you find you quickly lose that upgrade on no fault of your own. 

Worth avoiding, unless you are an incredibly dedicated bullet hell / twin stick shooter fan.",1622193317,1622193317,False,5,0,0.607935190200805664,0,False,True,False,False,,,

It's not BAD per se, but is marred by so many design flaws and obfuscated information that I cannot recommend it. (Note: I exclusively played single-player. It might be more fun with friends, but better games would also be more fun with friends so why not play those instead?)

Retro should not mean clunky. The menu navigation is bizarre, to the point that the only guide to this game on Steam is how to navigate the main menu. I wish I was joking. All the important information about your character (lives, score multiplier, etc.) is jammed into the corner in a font approximately 6 points tall. The main action isn't much better--your character and the vast majority of enemies are actually [i]smaller[/i] than they appear in the store screenshots.

The gameplay is uninspired--robots pour out of a door, you shoot them. Once you've shot enough, there's an explosion and robots start pouring out different doors, until eventually the room is clear and you move to the next. I suppose this used to be ""acceptable"" for an arcade-style score chaser, but calling it ""retro"" doesn't make it less dull.

There are serious flaws in the gameplay too. Robots and players respawn at the same doors. Robots respawn instantly. Shoot one, and another immediately comes out the same door. Do you see the problem? Better hope you didn't kill a swarm right before you died, because you'll probably respawn right in the middle of their replacements. No, you don't get any mercy frames or a second of ghost-walking. You're stuck in that swarm and better be able to fight them off with your depowered weapon.

Each of the hidden characters, game modifiers, and all but one stage of the alternate modes are hidden behind unlocks. Which ones, who knows? You'll have to beat a challenge before you find out. And when you do, odds are you'll get a lorebook entry instead. Said challenges are also incredibly grindy: kill 1,000 robots, kill 10,000 robots, play 10 hours with a particular character, etc.

There may be depth to this game, but it is hidden so well that I can't find it. Perhaps if I got gud, but I'd rather just play an actually fun game instead.",1594773396,1594773519,False,2,0,0.563235819339752197,0,False,True,False,False,,,

You can do a ""bomb"" to clear enemies if you get swamped, but this consumes the same energy. Essentially, the harder you have to fight, the weaker you will get, and it's not easy to fight ""smarter"" with perfect accuracy when you can only shoot in 8 directions- normally not a problem in games like this, but a huge issue here when every shot that doesn't kill an enemy will weaken you.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1557070622
High degree of replayability due to its starting set of 5 different characters, each with a specific weapon specialty: machine gun, shotgun, chaingun, missile launcher and laser (long-beam type, not pew-pew). Also due to the randomized nature of arena exits in the game -- you‚Äôll experience arenas in different order each playthrough. The layouts of the arenas are very different, and not just simple squares. And finally much replayability because enemy robot swarms come out of lots of different entry doors, and it‚Äôs never a predicable mix imho.

An innovative energy system meter and the bouncing ‚Äúenergy fragments‚Äù left behind by destroyed robots -- supplemented by lightning symbol crates you can blow up to get more energy fragments -- means you‚Äôre always on the run and can‚Äôt just hide in a corner. This system results in a fluctuating upgrading (via piled up energy) and downgrading (using up your energy firing your weapon or taking damage) of your character's weapon. 

You're encouraged to 'burst fire' to conserve the energy meter, although you can certainly just ""spray and pray"" continously. :) But that will drain your energy meter faster and downgrade your character's weapon faster.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1555753883
You can also expend energy to transform into an energy shield ‚Äúsprite‚Äù to avoid taking damage or travel through a large bunch of robot enemies. As you move further into the game, you‚Äôll often be completely overwhelmed by enemies, and this ability to turn into an energy shield spite is often necessary to survive the arena and make it to the next one.

Due to I assume the limitations of ‚Äúx-input‚Äù controller support, controller aiming via thumbstick seems limited to 8 directions instead of analog 360-dgree aiming. If using kb/mouse, menu navigation can be rather frustrating. So much so, that I actually posted a Steam game guide about navigating Circuit Breakers‚Äô menus:

The game‚Äôs final Beta 4.0 Update (see final news post: https://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791440145305/announcements/detail/1721950919409908027, has terrific keyboard/mouse gameplay support, but menu navigation remains rather bizarre. To the extent that I actually created a Steam Game Guide that‚Äôs ONLY about how to navigate Circuit Breakers‚Äô menus via keyboard:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1556495180
The bullet hell aspect is in both how gameplay is as the difficulty ramps up, and you‚Äôre constantly upgrading your weapons on the fly temporarily by piling up your energy meter; and in the memorable screen-filling bosses that appear in every 10th room. I‚Äôd call the first two bosses ‚Äútough but fair.‚Äù :) I‚Äôve gotten far enough to defeat the 1st (Room 10) and 2nd (Room 20) boss. Difficulty in the regular room arenas gets really challenging at that point. :)

The game still seems to have some bugs in it. After completing a session and going through the unlocked Challenges, CB always seems to crash to desktop for me with a crash log. The developers don‚Äôt seem to be working on the game anymore, so it‚Äôs unclear if this type of lingering bug will ever get squashed.

SInce this more like an arcade twin-stick (ti's not a roguelike), you earn additional lives, I think based on how much you score. I've had as many as 6 during a session. The game ends once you use up the lives.

You can unlock additional characters with diffferent weapon specialties by accomplishing certain Challenges -- I think most games would call these Unlocks or Achievement Unlocks. I've not accomplished any of these yet afik, so I can't speak to them yet.

So overall I give it a conditional recommendation. If you enable the beta 4.0 branch in Steam, the kb/mouse twin stick shooter gameplay is great fun with some innovative bits and a great deal of replayability. However, keyboard mouse navigation remains klutzy and strange -- you can get used to it in time. :) On controller, if you can live with the 8-way thumbstick aiming limitation, it‚Äôs fun, but in my XBox 360 controller test the 8-way limitation does affect how I play it.",1541369513,1541370121,True,2,0,0.553752541542053223,0,True,False,False,False,,,

TLDR: You constantly have to collect crystals which are dropped for ammo and level up. Which gets you cornered and hit and down leveled.

The problem with this game is that you are constantly sitting at some kind of skill ceiling middle ground. As you clear room after room of swarming foes, you have to rush in near the entrance points to get more ammo and level in something called energium.

To make things more chaotic your aim and autoshoot buttons are one and the same, while the game forbids for granular aiming instead locking you into straight shooting and diagonals. That also only works against you as the foes are not restricted in their movements and will often get in blind angles, forcing you to dance around as you kite to get them in your line of sight.

The energium fades away after a while so you cannot reasonably expect to get them if you wait for swarms to clear, especially since they often respawn in multiple waves.

Conclusion: If you have a coop friend and like the aesthetics it is not the worst executed game there is but there are free offers out there that arguably do the topdown shooter better justice.

The menu controls are odd as hell (WASD, E and Q? What?) and the only time you can use the mouse (and ONLY the mouse) is to set controls. After picking a character with E you need to press ENTER to start... cause that makes sense.

Ingame then it's not that much fun to play. Doors are on all sides and no advanced warning off spawns, so stay off the sides. Problem is, levels are EXTREMELY small. Pickups are time-limited... but often stacked near explosive crates, so you can't use those if you want to preserve the goods. Pickups require pinpoint pickup. Enemies, background and ammo all blend into a pixeled MESS, which isn't good. As if it doesn't look mesh-up enough yet level 11 makes the backgrounds brown, making it even more everything blending together. Not good for a fast-paced shooter. Has extremly bad levels like one made of transport belts so you have about 0 controls. Levels with pathways so enemies leave one door as spawn, then re-enter it to go to the other side (which looks really stupid).

But yeah, the major nail is pretty much how much everything blends together into an eyesore. All enemies, their projectiles, the background. And then a bucketload of ammo spewn all over the screen at almost all times. The thing you want most in these games is while it offers a bucketloads of enemies on screen, their distinctness makes you be in control at all times. This game fails in that massively.

The most recent update reveals this game is not going to ever improve, and has been abandoned by the devs. None of the deficiencies outlined in my review have been corrected. The Energium system is still broken AF, and the game is completely bland and buggy. Circuit Breakers is a game I watched eagerly, waiting for improvement which never came and never will. Avoid - and do not buy even at heavily reduced price - the game is not good and never will be.

[h1]3.0 Update![/h1]

Saw the new update so removed the game from my Hidden games and re-installed.  Still boring AF. Core mechanic of kiting endlessly instead of shooting is still fundamentally broken. Nicer levels and more robots so the monotony is reduced.

Listen to me, mr game dev: The core mechanic is broken. Get rid of the stupid Energium already.  It is so obvious that it is what is wrong with this game.

This time I gave up around map 13 when the game lost count of how many robots were left and wouldn't let me exit.

[h1]A mostly-finished game that just falls flat[/h1]

This game has a fatal flaw, and it is that they made the Meta-Game all about managing your shooting resource called Energium.  It costs Energium to fire every shot, and most foes drop Energium pellets.  The more Energium you have the more powerful your gun is, the less you have the weaker your gun is.

So this means the core game is kiting enemies into a blob then shooting so as not to waste a single shot. Because if you do, you will find your weapon becoming slowly degrading in power.

Which means you have a shooting game where the core mechanic is all about NOT SHOOTING.  I get the intention behind having a ""gun power"" resource, but it should never have been made to deplete with each shot.

When I play shooting games I want to blast the living &@#*%^ out of everything on the screen, not tediously kite around with my finger OFF THE TRIGGER.

Aside from the broken core mechanic, here is the rest of the gameplay experience:

Level 1 - Basic room where I shoot robots and learn the ropes

Level 2 - Died a few times intentionally to learn the health mechanics

Level 3 - Ok I got the mechanics, LETS PLAY!!!

Level 4 - Hmm... Looks a lot like Level 4

Level 5 - Are we still on Level 4

Level 6 - WTF... LEVEL 4 AGAIN!?!?!

Level 7 - Wait I think I saw a different box... maybe I'm on new Levels

Level 8 - Still looks like Level 4...

And so on.

Never gets better, never develops into anything.  Enemies have no variety and use the same simplistic attack patterns.  There is no challenge to this game and no sense of satisfaction.  They could have had something here if they kept going and put a ton more polish on it.  Sadly what we have is another proof-of-concept with snappy graphics, that didn't actually amount to a complete game.  Sure you can play it, but it's about as bare-bones as you can get.

Honestly, I love me a good top down shooter and this one is incredibly good! I remember hearing someone compare it to Smash TV and honestly I think thats a great comparison.
Controls are responsive, the mechanic of trying to not go crazy with your shots (as the guns work on an energy level system so if you shoot faster than you can collect the energy your power suffers as a result) and its honestly a lot of fun overall.

More you kill the more crystals you get the more powerful your weapon becomes and the more you kill the more enemies appear getting harder and harder till you die(big run on sentence but you get the idea). Dials back a bit when you stop killing so much.

Pros

+ Variety in characters and levels
+ Pixel graphics
+ Shooting feels responsive and requires ammo management... which is how I like it in top-down shooters.

Cons

- Lack of variety later on
- Runs require a lot of playtime and the enemies start to feel like bullet sponges, making the game feel repetitive (at least when playing alone)
- Hidden characters and no idea how to get them
- Grindy achievements
- Difficulty is based on how many players are playing the game. More players and the game is easier to complete.
- Characters are unbalanced in solo play. Rocket Launcher > Machine Gun > Shotgun > Laser
- In solo play and small levels, it's hard to hit enemies before they get to you. There is either not enough shield, ammo or room to move in.
- Half of the enemies tend to stay behind walls but still shoot at you while the other half is trying to swarm you from multiple directions in tight levels. Killing those swarming enemies is not very effective when you can't collect enough ammo back to keep your DPS up.

Thanks to him for the game!

I'm not very vocal about this, but I'm actually a big fan of top-down shooters and bullet hell games. That being said, I don't play them very often. That's why I took the opportunity to review this game, to see if it would scratch an itch left untouched for years. After playing for a few hours with friends and myself, I think this game managed to scratch that itch.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

You shouldn't be expecting much when it comes to graphics for a game in this genre. However, I will say that it does recreate the retro/arcade feeling well, and compared to other top-down shooters I've seen, it feels more authentic. However, one qualm I would say about the visuals is the fact I have trouble telling the robots apart from one another. I usually just view them as, ""Okay, there's another guy to shoot."" It would be nice to be able to distinguish the robots from each other. Did you expect a huge paragraph talking about this game's graphics? I didn't think so. It's still pretty nice though.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

You're probably reading this to see if the overall gameplay is good or not. For a game like this, if the gameplay isn't good, then the game probably won't get much positive feedback. Now here's what I want you to do. Read that second sentence again. Now I want you to see if I gave this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Read that second sentence one more time. Get where I'm heading with this? Anyway, I loved the idea of the weapon upgrades, and it makes the game feel a lot more interesting. It makes the game feel more difficult (in a fun way) and also less ""spammy"", which could've killed the whole experience. Also, the game is much more enjoyable with friends. I haven't played too much of it with others, but from what I have played with them, the game is definitely more entertaining. My one issue with the gameplay is that I can't seem to find a use for the shield. Maybe it's just me, but after all, this is MY review. I'm supposed to tell the reader my thoughts and experience with the game. I couldn't find myself using the shield that much. I would recommend that the shield feels more ""necessary"" in some cases. For example, there could be a type of enemy with attacks that can't be avoided, so you'll need to use the shield. Aside from the bit with the shield, however, the gameplay is very enjoyable.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Go down to my verdict if you want me to elaborate. There's no overall story at the moment. However, it seems that the developers are trying to create a world of their own here. 

[h1]Audio[/h1]

Honestly, there's even less to say here than in the graphics department. There's no voice acting, and the audio overall is solid. Not great, not terrible. There's music, too, but I found it to be forgettable for the most part. I wish the soundtrack could've been a little more exciting.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]

The good thing about Circuit Breakers is that the replayability is surprisingly high. This game is an EXCELLENT time killer, and I wouldn't be shocked if you put a fair amount of time into it. With the fair and difficult gameplay. the fact that more content is on the way, and a few other things I don't feel like listing, you could put a lot of time into this. I'm going to have to keep this installed on my computer in case I'm ever bored. It's a great way to pass the time.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Overall, Circuit Breakers does have a few flaws, but the game is incredibly fun. There's even controller support, and although you may have a few problems with it at first, the bugs involving it are too minor for me. Add that with the fun co-op gameplay, the weapon upgrade concept, and high replayability, and you have yourself one of the best time wasters Steam has to offer.

Circuit Breakers is an arcade retro shooter, developed by Triverske, releasing in November 2015. There isn‚Äôt really a story to this game, it‚Äôs completely focused on the gameplay, as I would expect from an arcade title, so don‚Äôt go into this expecting a deep thriller backstory. 
The gameplay concept is very simple; you pick which character you want to play as at the start of the game, these are based on what weapon you use, such as machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher and laser, these classes have their own strength and weaknesses, but are not apparent from the start.  The objective in the game is to kill all the enemies in a room and then progress to the next, every ten rooms you complete you will have to take on a boss.  Probably my favourite feature in Circuit Breakers, is that you are able to upgrade your weapon to a stronger one of the same type, simply by killing enemies and finding more ‚Äúammo‚Äù pickups, and once you run out of ammo, you just drop down to the previous gun you were using, it sounds complicated but it actually plays out very smoothly and adds a nice level of excitement to your runs.  The game play is very fast paced as you can sometimes get hundreds of enemies on the screen at once, the enemies are for the most part very easy to mow through but some can take a good pounding before finally being beaten. 

The art style on show in Circuit Breakers has a very retro arcade feel to it. I really liked this art style and it is not very often you see it done as well as this. It takes a very Metal Slug vibe very strongly, and I salute the developers for pulling this off. All of the rooms and backdrops in which you fight in throughout the game are really nicely designed too, with lots of different textures and layouts to keep you on your toes. 

Circuit Breakers is a very hard game. I only managed to get past the first 10 rooms on a handful of occasions, purely because the latter stages of the rooms you just get absolutely swarmed with enemies and you have to be very quick on your feet to keep ahead of them. Where you can get an advantage is playing with more than one person in the local co-op side of the game; this is where you will probably get the most enjoyment as well. If you have someone to play with that isn‚Äôt the best at video games, maybe a partner or younger sibling, I would still recommend they try it with you, since the controls and gameplay is very simple to pick up, only difficult to master. 

I have been playing Circuit Breakers for an hour here and there over the past two weeks and managed to rack up just over 20 hours of time in it. I haven‚Äôt come close to getting even one of the achievements, let a long completing the game.  On top of the game‚Äôs arcade mode which is where you will probably spend a lot of your time, the game also has a challenge mode. You unlock challenges by progressing in the arcade mode; I really liked this way of unlocking new challenges as it gives you incentive to better yourself to unlock more content. The replay ability factor and addictiveness nature of this game stands it in good stead to be a game I will keep installed on my PC allowing me to drop in for an hour here every now and again. 

The only technical issue I ran into when playing is, that if you don‚Äôt launch the game when you have your controller plugged in, it won‚Äôt recognise it unless you reload. It‚Äôs not a major problem, just a little issue that I found annoying. Other than that, it runs well on all resolutions without any issues. 

To sum up, Circuit Breakers is a really good game to play in short bursts with a very fast paced action based game play to keep you coming back for more. Definitely one that gets better the more people you play with, and has a really high difficulty ceiling to. With online leader boards with your friends, it will also bring out your competitive nature as well.  I can highly recommend Circuit Breakers, especially for its low retail price of ¬£6,99.

C‚Äôest un jeu de tir (twin stick shooter) vu du dessus. Vous jouez un des membres d‚Äôun commando et vous devez sauver l‚Äôhumanit√© d‚Äôun danger qui la menace. Le commando comprend au minimum deux personnes et au maximum, quatre. Vous avez le choix entre quatre personnages diff√©rents, chacun ayant ses propres caract√©ristiques et armes, il va de soit.

Le graphisme est bien pixelis√© et donne au jeu un air retro qui est recherch√© par le studio, je suppose.

In the future, rapid advances in Artifical Intelligence will lead to robots declaring humanity ""an obsolete by-product of a forgotten age"" and also ""really disgusting"". If left un-checked, this menace will wipe out all that we hold dear. Don't be surprised if some guy named Centauri comes to your house, ranting and raving about your hi-score in a twin-stick shooter. Just be aware that this man will have you enter his car - which is actually a time machine - and before you know it, you'll be fighting for the future of Neo-Earth.

Now I know what you're thinking: If time-travel is possible. Why not simply go back in time to prevent the robots from being created? First off, don't sweat the minor details. Secondly, all roads in time eventually lead to genocide via robots. Face it, if we're not eaten by zombies, we'll be stabbed, splatted, and vaporized by robots. If that doesn't happen, then I can only assume [i]Zombie Robots[/i] will be what destroys us once and for all. So my advice is to do your part, and check out Circuit Breakers.

These days it takes more than running and shooting to make a worthwhile twin-stick shooter. This genre has seen countless game releases, and it probably will be the 25th century by the time we've played them all. Aside from being a quality title in terms of the basic fundamentals, Circuit Breakers also has some depth to it. Each playable character has their own weapon. What might be effective in some situations, won't cut it in others. For example: Samson's rocket launcher is powerful, but its low fire-rate and high ammo costs mean that you have to be selective in your shots. Also, you just caught the part about ammo, right? Robots and artillery alike run on energium. By destroying robots you collect their energy, and your level of fire-power can increase. While you can't run out of ammo, your weapon can become so puny and ineffective, that you'll be no match for the horde of mechs. Your ammo can also be expended to put up an emergency shield. By holding down the button you can push through crowds, and by tapping it you can reflect enemy-fire. 

While you can and should shoot everything that moves, you also have to consider the scoring system. Yep, even when surrounded by hundreds of dangerous robots, your first thought is going to be on profiting from the chaos. By destroying multiple robots in a short time, you build up a combo chain. Taking damage, or simply taking too long to wreck bots, will result in the chain being broken. To further complicate matters, each robot is worth a varying amount of points. What you'll want to do is destroy the weak and plentiful bots, before moving on to the bigger and badder creations. As with any other arcade game, you have milliseconds to develop your scoring strategy, and apply it to the situation at hand. 

Circuit Breakers uses a retro-aesthetic, and relies on tried and true game-design elements such as audio cues and color-coded enemies. This makes the action easier to follow, because you'll always have some awareness of what's going on around you. Robots with guns always make a distinct noise before they fire, same with the floating mines that explode, or the droids unleashing their homing missiles. While it seems odd that I would applaud the fundamentals, all too often developers forget or ignore these imperative aspects, and their games suffer as a result. Other essentials such as controls and enemy behavior are also solid.

This game features a nice set of modes and variables. The arcade mode consists of 50 rooms, five boss-fights, and a plethora of bots and mini-bosses to contend with. Apparently it also loops indefinitely, so you can play as long as you have lives remaining. The score-attack mode is much more focused, since each level consists of a handful of rooms. Not only do you have to master the scoring system, but you also have to take advantage of modifiers. Before starting the game, you can increase your scoring potential by making things more difficult. I don't have all of the settings unlocked, but to give you an idea, these modifiers can include: raising enemy health, spawning more ""elite"" mechs, and decreasing the amount of energium recovery. Each game is further differentiated by your character of choice, and anyone you decide to partner up with. Multiplayer is a big part of this game. There's always a party, if you can convince up to three friends to join in on the action. 

However, it should be mentioned that there's no leveling of any kind. These days it seems like every arcade-style shooter offers players methods for strengthening their characters through grinding. This isn't the case here, as your survival is determined entirely by the experience [i]you[/i] acquire. That said, unlocking some of the content - such as hidden characters and modifiers - can feel like a grind. Completing all of the challenges will require an absurd number of hours, but if you're having fun, then this isn't much of a complaint.

There are some aspects of the game that could use some tuning. For one, some characters are underpowered for critical situations. Payne is one of the hidden playable characters, and he uses a flame-thrower. This is a fantastic weapon for handling large crowds of weak mechs, but it's too ineffective for tougher bots and bosses. This problem can be addressed by playing co-op, as Tay with her laser can make for a powerful team. These and other more minor issues have been mentioned in the discussion forums, and the developer is very open to all of the feedback. 

All that said, Circuit Breakers is an exceptional addition to any gamer's library. There's a sizable amount of content, and more importantly, the game-design is fully realized. You have to carefully manage your firepower, due to the energium system. When coupled with the smart scoring techniques, this makes for a shooter that's far more strategic than most. In a way, these limitations make the game more satisfying and visceral. Usually when I play, I tap the right-stick to fire, so as not to waste ammo. When I hold the right-stick in the direction of robots, that commitment to destruction feels pretty good. Basically, this game is worth your time.

Since the kickstarter campaign was a flop, this game took a massive hit, and became only a shell of a good top-down shooter.

[i]Nachdem Steam es mir endlich gestattet hat, das Spiel auch zu spielen, ist es mir nun m√∂glich, ein kleines Review zu verfassen.[/i]


[h1][b]Das Spiel:[/b][/h1]

Endloses Gemetzel an k√ºnstlicher Intelligenz, Wellen-basierte Levels; egal ob Single- oder Multiplayer das macht einfach nahezu jedem Spa√ü! Ein Battel gegen seine Freunde mittels eines Zeit stoppenden Spielmodis bringt noch etwas W√ºrze in die Sache.

Vier Klassen stehen derzeit zur Auswahl, darunter sind: 
[list]
[*]Maschienen Gewehr
[*]Shot Gun
[*]Raketen Werfer
[*]Laser Kanone (nicht so stark wie sie klingt)
[/list]

Leider gibt es keine M√∂glichkeiten seinem Charakter ein individuelleres Aussehen zu verleihen.

An sich gibt es keine wirkliche Story in dem Spiel. Ihr seid in verschiedenen Arealen mit mehreren R√§umen und m√ºsst nacheinander alle R√§ume von den amoklaufenden Robotern befreien.
Spa√üig ist das Ganze dennoch, aber auf Grund der Beschr√§nkungen hinsichtlich Klassen und Individualisierung nur 5/10 Punkten an der Stelle.

[h1][b]Das Gameplay:[/b][/h1]

Vom Spielgef√ºhl her hat es sehr gro√üe √Ñhnlichkeit mit dem weit verbreiteten Browser-Game ""Boxhead Zombies"".
Das Spiel sollte mit Controller gespielt werden, da ihr so wesentlich bessere Trefferquoten erzielen k√∂nnt. Spielt ihr jedoch mit Maus und Tastatur habt ihr nur 8 Richtungen, in die ihr schie√üen k√∂nnt (Die 4 Himmelrichtungen und die Zwischenstufen).
In den Genuss des Multiplayers kommt man entweder im lokalen Spiel, oder √ºber die Serverfunktion welche ich aber selbst noch nicht testen konnte, da es mir an mitstreitern mangelt. Nichts desto trotz l√§sst sich schon bei einem Kumpel der neber einem Sitz eine Aussage √ºber das Spielerlebnis treffen: Es macht m√§chtig Laune auch wenn es unbequem ist sich zu zweit vor einen Rechner zu klemmen.

Ein netter Zeitvertreib wenn man grade die Schnautze voll von seinem Lieblingsspiel hat, aber f√ºr die Dauer beinhaltet das Spiel etwas zu wenig Abwechslung deshalb 6/10 Punkten.

[h1][b]Meine Bewertung:[/b][/h1]

[b]Pro:[/b]
[list]
[*]Herausforderungen die auch ihren Namen verdienen
[*]Simple Steuerung
[*]Suchtfaktor durch Herausforderungen
[*]Viel Spa√ü bei wenig Speicherplatz
[/list]

[b]Kontra:[/b]
[list]
[*]Derzeit noch nicht voll ausgereift
[*]Beschr√§nkungen
[*]Lautst√§rken-Balance von Musik und Sound
[/list]

[b]Weder Pro noch Kontra:[/b]
[list]
[*]Die starke √Ñhnlichkeit zu ""Boxhead Zombies""
[/list]

Alles in allem gebe ich dem Spiel [b][u]derzeit[/u][/b] noch 5/10 Punkten, empfehle es aber dennoch, da es auch wenn es noch nicht vollstens Ausgereift ist trotzdem einen guten L√ºckenb√º√üer f√ºr Wartezeiten oder eine weiter Battel-M√∂glichkeit f√ºr sich und seine Freunde ist.
[i]Die Bewertung kann sich im Laufe der kommenden Wochen noch √§ndern, da das Spiel noch bearbeitet wird!

The controls are amusing, and the indepth setup said controls is commendable. Circuit Breaker's music and retro art sets it apart from the clutter of games with recognizable tunes and indiscernible drawings. Its rooms are delightfully varied and enjoyable, yet successful in not distracting the player from gameplay. The quick pace of the game is what makes it so addicting; being able to run at, run away from, and shoot at the robots in a swift manner creates a rush of adrenaline that makes you want to keep pressing the start button. The game does a great job of keeping the player actually focused by employing a system of crystals used to upgrade characters' weapons and double as ammunition. Instead of mindless shooting, you have to constantly pick up more crystals as you shoot so your weapon doesn't downgrade.
One of my favorite things about this game is how oddly soothing it is to shoot at the robots. Playing as Aldo and letting loose a cascade of bullets is just plain fun.
For the price, the game is definitely worth it (buy it). Playing with friends make it entirely more entertaining, and the online multiplayer, once released, should bring the game to a whole new level.",1448859256,1448859256,True,2,0,0.520201981067657471,0,True,False,False,False,,,
