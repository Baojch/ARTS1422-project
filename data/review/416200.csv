It's essentially a walking simulator/exploration game. It's set in a world where agents in robot bodies run Ministries which control aspects of reality (e.g., Sound, Colour, Light). And administration agencies like the Ministry of Order police them. You are Bixby of the Dept. of Correction Pending; in exchange for your efforts to cut through the Ministry of Order's bureaucracy, you are not only the last agent in your department, but trapped in the Lounge District. The Lounge District is a labyrinth of glossy lobbies, bars, suites, malls, parks, and bus lots -- all abandoned by the Ministry of Order agents when you interfered. It's up to you (and your trusty radio operator Stiggs) to troubleshoot all the weird happenings that go on.

The game is divided into 'cases', each with a description of the gameplay (e.g., navigation, security evasion) and a time estimate. You are directed from place to place by placard or clues, and the plot moves a step further with each stop. Lore is scattered through the district by radio, info booth, and talk show, but the case storytelling is entirely dialogue. Your time will be spent hovering through the Lounge District (at a good clip) getting lost while you zone out to the pretty great Vangelis-style soundtrack.

The game is best approached as meditative and atmospheric. Because there IS a real atmosphere here. The Lounge District is a Neo Art Deco delight, with no two rooms alike and many shrouded in shadow or odd corners. The world-building is vague and the District is deserted, but in every room there's a reminder of the backstory (including portraits of the ex-Ministry of Order dictator), so paranoia builds. Later cases go a little farther afield, exploring new areas. As for the cases themselves, the most relative word is 'surreal' (they have names like, 'High Frequency Corn Syrup' and 'Dogs With Shoes.') There is an insistence on analogue, throwback touches, a la Bioshock. You get the feeling all business is conducted by pneumatic tube.

Now for the caveats -- and there are several. Repetition is one; almost all the gameplay is navigation-based (although I guarantee you will NEVER learn your way around -- if getting lost is the point, then the game definitely delivers on that). Some people will find the emptiness of the world off-putting, although some crumbs of backstory explain why the District is abandoned. Some of the clues are unclear, so you will end up wandering around; this is especially difficult when you forget what exactly you're looking for, as the game has no quest information to refer back to. You can skip around the case list, but you cannot save mid-case. The biggest problem, though, is the dialogue -- especially unfortunately, as the plot is built on it. It's cleanly recorded but the actors are often muffled, so you have to crank up the sound to hear. More, it's very dense, and employs a lot of in-house future slang. You MUST pay strict attention. To their credit, the dev responded to comments on this and attempted to install subtitles, but the engine wouldn't allow it. The dev also came back quickly on bug reports.

The whole game is clearly a labour of love by a single developer. The graphics, the programming, the music, the writing -- all one person. And that really shines through, as the game is undoubtedly a cohesive whole, and infused with the enthusiasm of creation. If you loved Myst's atmosphere but didn't like the puzzles preventing you from wandering around, or if you love dark ambient music and want a surreal way to jam along with it, give it a go!",1600837988,1600837988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So this game is a pure walking sim, no denial about that. The missions lack ergonomy, for example you can't look back to your objective, it's displayed once by tier of progression and then have fun trying to remembering it.

The world is gorgeous, it's really good in his NoirPunk style, even if some textures and lighting reflections are kinda weird.

The gameplay itself is pretty horrible, nothing much aside basic and limited interaction and the absence of subtitle options combined with the low sound quality of the voicelines really punish the experience.

Story-wise, i'm not very interested in the characters, the world is really weird and contains more than meets the eye but i'm discouraged since mission 3 that i can't even recall the goal, because of the cons i mentioned above.

[h1][b]Door To Door[/b][/h1]

[b]Door To Door[/b] Is a detective game where you're playing as Detective Solomon Bixby. The game has 10 different cases to offer. The first 5 which has an estimate of 25 minutes to completion and the rest of the 5 cases have an estimate of 30, 35 and 45 minutes being the maximum estimate. Which also happens to be the FINALE chapter. I do not like the typography. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the game but I got used to it. There are not many characters in game either. It's somewhat an openworld game but it feels like we're playing in a ghost town.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
The game has a nice feel to it. All that neon lighting and the retro look this game has, it feels pretty good to be playing it. The music goes fine with it. However, I think there should at least be an objective tab where players could look up what exactly they should be going after. Since there is no subtitles and there isn't going to be any updates including the subtitles, the very least thing that could be done is setting up an Objective tab that tells players what should be done.

[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]
Graphics for both Low and High settings are good. But you get that full retro experience only when you're playing in High graphics settings. This is only because when you've set the graphics to low, all the lighting effects and smoke effects are turned off. So there's no way you can experience the cool neon style lighting and most other graphics. I really loved the retro look this game has to offer.

[h1][b]Bugs and glitches[/b][/h1] [list]

[*] The elevator near Bixby's office that is used to go down to The Reef Lounge, sometimes, it fails to take us back up when the button is pressed.

[*] Game crashing while launching it. It only happened twice and never really happened after but, just had to say it.

[*] The bus station does not seem to work if you just exited it from another station. Perhaps, it's got a cooldown limit set to it? 
[/list]
That's about all the errors I have found in my 1.4hrs of gameplay.

[h1][b]Developers[/b][/h1]
An overpriced game which clearly does not deserve to be overpriced. It would've been better if Charizmo were a little bit patient and didn't have to leave me while I was doing a little sightseeing. It would've been better if the elevators were working efficiently and I didn't have to walk all the way from Bixby's office to the Reef Lounge. It would've been better if the game costed a little cheaper.

[h1][b]Total average and final notes:[/b][/h1]
[h1][i]As much as I had fun playing this game completing cases, I don't feel like suggesting this game to anyone due to the amount of money it costs. The game is unique and if you want to try it out, you are free to do so, you will not be disappointed. I am going to score this game [u]4/10[/u].

TLDR: While some of the art direction and some of the mapmaking is half decent this is little more than poorly slapped together showcase. Had to use hardware features to lower mouse sensitivity to get this playable.

Door to Door has an odd Noir/Sci fi vibe going for it. You start in an office and you can go around what looks like... a museum or a mall. You get little missions but the areas are large and pointlessly expansive. There are surprisingly fewer assets than you would expect and everything ends up feeling like a differently copy pasted version of another area with different lighting. The game tries to add fast travel hotspots and a few conversation NPCS but they are few and far between and do not really add anything to the experience. I still had no clue what was going on or where I was expected to go. Most everything is uninteractive anyways. The few conversations I had involved unintelligble badly recorded voice overs by amateurs and the dev already confirmed the will never implement subtitles which were a non negotiable given the state of this game. As it stands it is little more than a a map with an excuse for a game slapped on top. Now if you factor in that most of the outdoor or very large areas are obscured by mostly dark areas with a few neon lights going through them, even building surfaces and whatnot and the whole thing starts to feel seriously unfinished. I could run the game fine but the occasional massive dip in performance told me that despite my rather beefy rig this game suffers from serious optimization issues. I find very little left to justify keeping this game around for and am removing it for declutter.",1506560858,1510007105,False,0,0,0.495465248823165894,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I guess the voice overs all sound like you're listening to them thru pnuematic tubing, so there's that. 

It's not visually unappealing, but feels unfinished. Everything about this game feels unfinished. And there are few things as boring as an unfinished 'walking simulator'. I did get around to trying out a couple of different case files, there is no way to track your status so if you get turned around (which is bound to happen) you can't re-read what your objectives are so you end up just aimlessly walking around until you're bored. I literally fell asleep at my keyboard - hence the playtime. This ride isn't worth the price of entry.

[h1] The Positives	[/h1]

-First of all and probably the most evident thing about the game is how it looks. This game has really great aesthetic. It's this mix of neon cyber-noir (screenshots for reference) that actually works incredibly well. The game mixes so many colors, shapes and fonts that end up forming captivating and interesting scenarios to look at and explore.

-The atmosphere is really good as well, you can really get involved in the game's world from the little sounds and the audio cue's around you.

-Both of these are what make the exploration so enjoyable. Feels like there's always something that catches your eye and you always feel like there's more to see. Due to it's nature you're never afraid to explore anything that catches your eye, the game gives you complete freedom to go where you want and that's another one of it's strongest points.

[h1] The Negatives	[/h1]

The storytelling is really poor. The game lacks a proper structure which really ends up hurting it. The scenario works so hard to captivate you it's sad that the storytelling kinda throws it all away due to all the flaws it has. Flaws that come in the form of poor voice acting, weak script and frail event structure.

Another thing that kinda ends up working in a negative way for the game is it's gameplay, or it's lack of it. You do very little in this game, to put it in a short way all you end up doing is following the dots to complete the picture. Using this analogy the dots are all in the right spots, it's just that you don't understand what the picture is when you finish and it leaves you feeling quite unsatisfied. 

[h1] Final Opinion	[/h1]

Honestly I won't recommend this game at full price, the content and the gameplay are just to weak. But if you see it at a buck during a major steam sale or in a bundle I would say the great visual design and atmospheric exploration make it a worthy pick up, which is why I'm giving this game a positive recommendation.

Greatly appreciated to the Cassus network for providing me with the review key for this game.

Hmm...  this game is hard to rate.  I really wanted to like it, and I do in some aspects, but what's most disappointing is the fact that this game could have been something really special.  Unfortunately, it falls short of being a great game.

Pros:
The graphics are beautiful
For the most part, you must find and follow clues
A rich and extremely detailed world
Very large and diverse areas to explore

Cons:
The cases are very silly (not funny silly, stupid silly)
The game takes your clues and solves the case for you (too much hand holding)
Most, if not all of the jokes fall flat
There is no notebook that you can reference

Cons that the developer is up front about:
There are no subtitles (some of the voices are hard to understand)
There are no other people (bots) in this city

Because the game was made with an older version of unreal engine, it made it impossible to fix or modify the game to accommodate the ladder, however, since the developer said this in the update section, I wouldn't dock them for it.  The only reason I'm mentioning it here is someone may insist on subtitles or a populous.

For new players, the city is very difficult to navigate, but there is ""Charizmo"" .  However, not all of the locations are listed so you may want to familiarize yourself with the city before you solve the cases.  There is no time limit so you can take all the time you want.

Despite it's shortcomings, I do like this game... somewhat.  Is it worth $6.99 (at the time of this review)?  Well, no.  I would wait for a sale if you want to give this game a shot.",1486627321,1486627321,True,10,0,0.634629368782043457,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You play as Bixby, an agent of the Ministry of Order. You basically go around the city investigating crimes (not really). The truth is, you follow clues and just interact with them. You don't need to think most of the time, just walk around wishing that you get to your objective because you just want to get it over with. The world is boring and lifeless. It is a world governed by robots and I find no humans or anything like that (well I didn't really play till the end cause it was killing me, honestly.) 

I hate giving bad reviews to games because I know the developers worked hard on it but this one is not really a ""full game"" in my opinion. It lacks flavor, colors, and fun. The world is bland and big, you spend most of the time wandering it and you'll get bored.

There are no subtitles in the game and I read a post by the developer that there will be no subtitles coming anytime soon (I think its because of the engine or something). There is also no way to review clues, when you press ESC you just have the options to go to settings or quit the game. The inability to review clues bothers me so much. I mean, its tagged as detective but you can't review your case files.

If this game is on early access, I may have followed it because the concept is nice. The graphics is a great (it is basically the best thing in the game). But Door to Door is not on early access and it still feels incomplete. Additionally, I think the price is too high for this game.

The characters are alright but there are so few. You have yourself, your assistant, charizmo (he's the guy to ask for directions), and depending on the case you are currently on, some few more characters. It would have been great if there were a bunch of characters in the background. I mean there is a bar, it looks great  and classy but its empty. There is a market also empty. A  bus station, guess what, that's right, its empty. There are some characters who just stand there and when you try to interact they just say ""hello"" or ""don't mind me"" but they just make me hate the game even more.

The good thing in this game as I have said is really the graphics. It is well done and you'll find the environment design amazing until you realize that the world is empty and it becomes dull. The sound is fine, I guess, but it still gives no life in the game. Imagine you're in all alone and you here the clarinet music in the detective movies. Wouldn't you feel so lonely?

So I wouldn't really recommend the  game. I spent nearly 3 hours in the game and maybe I only enjoyed the first 5 minutes. 1.5/5, sorry.

This game also to my good fortune blends some of the ""hitchikers guide to the galaxy"" humour with a 70/80s view of the robotic future.  The colors blast you with a fusion of neon and seemingly much larger areas than rapture had and the environmental sounds and noises also conjure up 70/80s sci-fi action movies.

Das Spiel spielt in einer Welt die im im ""Art Deco""-Stil gestaltet ist. Ich bin geneigt an 'Bioshock' zu denken, habe aber gelesen, das 'Brazil' das Vorbild sein soll. Die ganze Stadt wirkt wie ein riesiges Einkauftzentrum, das aus Patchwork-Teilen (edlere und weniger edlere Gegenden) zusammegewürfelt worden sind.
Man spielt einen Detektivroboter, der diverse Fälle (Rätsel) zu lösen hat. Davon sind am Anfang drei Fälle freigeschaltet.
Um einen Fall zu lösen, muß man sich von einem Hinweis-Ort zum nächsten Hinweis-Ort bewegen, wobei man an einem Ort Hinweise für den nächsten findet.

Ein paar nützliche Tips:
- Für PC-Spieler: Mit der Taste ""E"" kann man mit manhen Objekten interagieren.
- Die Schilder mit Hinweisen zu Orten können zur Orientierung ganz nützlich sein.",1448820386,1448820386,True,3,0,0.564732134342193604,0,True,False,True,False,,,

+Gute Grafik
+Nettes Map-Design
+Unverbrauchtes Genre

-Keine wirkliche Einleitung
-Wenig Action
-Nach kurzer Zeit langweilig
-Keine wirkliche Story

Fazit: Für Hardcore-Endecker ist das Spiel vielleicht an der einen oder anderen stelle interessant, für mich als Vollblutgamer ist es sehr eintönig. Wer wirklich ein Endeckungsspiel probieren möchte sollte sich Dream zulegen, alle anderen sollten erstmal einen Bogen um das Spiel machen, hier bleibt nur zu hoffen das die Entwickler es bis zum Release noch etwas actionreicher gestalten.
