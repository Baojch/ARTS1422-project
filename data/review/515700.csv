or you can read my review below: https://youtu.be/pGHyhtBbRS8

[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]

It's a shame that this game's MP servers were shut down, but understandable. Even though I never got to play online MP, I could see this being a very fun game against other players online. It's simple, but fun. It's basically just a snowball fight where you can get behind cover and chuck snowballs at opponents.

The 2 available game environments look good. The game is very slow to load up, but the actual gameplay is smooth. The physics for throwing the snow balls seems to be top notch. You can also dodge or teleport out of the way. So everything works as it should.

I played singleplayer and everything worked as expected. The only issue I found was that enemy AI was not very good. So unless you can start your own server and can get buddies to play this semi-retired game with you, your stuck with the dumb enemy AI. That's a shame because this was actually a pretty good MP VR game.

The snowmen are really irritating as it takes away the fun from interacting with friends but then again nobody is every online and LAN connection not available. If they add a snowman option then at least have it in an optional 'Horde Mode', I was sold on the idea of snowballs and friends, sounds like good times and fun, but nothing else is added to the game, can't interact with the environment and the pointless and relentless re-spawning of snowmen a waste of time, as it cycles repeatedly without end.

　　游戏采用了写实画风，玩家在游戏中以第一人称视角进行游戏，还可以自定义游戏中角色的外观。这是一款多人游戏，在等待其他玩家进入游戏时，可以与电脑扮演的雪人打雪仗。
　　游戏真实模拟了打雪仗的过程，玩家需要自行蹲下扣动手柄扳机键在地上捡雪球，然后再投掷向玩家。而游戏中移动是玩家抓取手套上的两个迷你角色投掷到哪就会瞬移过去，这样一来玩家想要一边投掷雪球一边移动非常别扭。
　　游戏售价48元，虽然是一款可以多人对战的打雪仗游戏，但是目前人数过少，玩法内容单一，可玩性并不高，建议玩家谨慎购买。

I know its still early access, so its probably coming down the pipe line. The locomotive movements for this is different than any other VR game ive played, which I like better than teleporting for these types of games... Had an issue where I would lose visibility when clipping through objects. Overall its a great game, but the about of gameplay in the current build does not justify the $15 dollar price tag as of right now. It may get more gameplay features later on that would give it that value in the future, but right now I would only recommend it to people who have money to burn...

The game looks fantastic, very life-like! I truly felt like I was in the middle of a mountain town.  It was beautiful
The gameplay is simplistic, it's a snowball fight! Hit other players with darn snowballs!

I only have two current issues with the game.
1. I don't know if other players just were not talking, but it seems that there is no voice communication, which really waters down the multiplayer experience.
2. The current teleportation system needs to go away and be replaced with the one that is ACTUALLY in the trailer, which is also misleading to those looking to purchase the game.
The current teleportation system is you grab a ""mini-me"" version of yourself, located on your wrist and throw that to where you want to go, just like you would a snowball.  The thing is is that you don't always go exactly where you intend to and, in the middle of a ""fire fight"", you can accidently get caught up and end up throwing your ""mini me"" instead of a snowball and teleport yourself when you didn't mean to.

That aside, the game is fantastic in it's simplicty and, with a large active community, can expand into something so much more.",1480545629,1482703034,True,1,1,0.361123800277709961,1,False,True,True,False,,,
