Tomar soda mientras uno recorre y admira una gran variedad de paisajes y escucha música es relajante, es de esos juegos que parecen simples y cortos, pero tienen una cantidad ENORME de mapas, canciones y ""diálogos"", es sorprendente.

Ok no, si eso fuese todo no creo que estuviese haciendo una reseña, la parte mas interesante viene en el otro juego dentro de Soda Drinker Pro, que seria ""Vivian Clark"", el cual seria, a falta de una comparación mas precisa, como WarioWare, una serie de minijuegos y juegos cortos conectados entre si y que tienen desafíos ocultos o sorpresas a descubrir y cumplir.
Todos se manejan solo moviéndose + un botón, siendo simples de adaptarse pero aun así diferentes entre si (eso si, muchos son plataformeo nada mas).
Es bastante mas adictivo de lo que parece, el encontrar las conexiones entre los ""mundos"", descubrir como funcionan y se juegan, recolectar coleccionables y monedas, además de que, a pesar de que uno si puede perder, todo el progreso se guarda por partida, siempre hay cosas nuevas por aprender.

Ahora, SOLO lo recomiendo si les interesa las experiencias creativas y originales, NO lo recomiendo si esperan una buena jugabilidad, algo pulido o que tenga sentido, los hitbox y colisiones están extremadamente rotos, haciendo que uno muera injustamente, y lo tan bizarros que llegan a ser algunos desafíos puede llevar a que pierda la gracia el tratar de conseguirlos.

The surface-level Soda Drinker gameplay is take-it-or-leave-it. It's not exciting by any means, but there's a lot that it does ""well"" aesthetically. It embodies the Steam Greenlight era and is very obviously designed to look and feel like a cheap cash-grab as was common at the time; it's a playful game, and it leans into the shovelware identity in addition to a dreamlike visual and auditory style to create some unique moods. Your mileage will vary, but if you're just looking for experiences, then it's an experience. There's nothing more I can say about it.

""Vivian Clark"" is another, separate game hidden within Soda Drinker Pro - with ""actual gameplay"", as opposed to what Soda Drinker Pro offers - and it's genuinely one of the most inspired games I've played in a long time. After the first 30 minutes of playing, I wasn't sure I was going to commit to completing the game; there's no clear objective, the controls are incredibly clunky, and the game's artwork is messily drawn and visually noisy. There was something about the game's flow that was appealing enough to make me want to keep going, though... the closest comparison I can make is LSD: Dream Emulator, sharing DNA with it and the many other exploration titles it has inspired (such as Yume Nikki), though Vivian Clark has the distinction of containing ""actual gameplay"" as previously mentioned. I decided to stick with it, and I found myself growing increasingly captivated by its design. It quite literally drops you into the thick of things, and you're tasked with figuring out how the game works and how to decipher its metaphorical gameplay language. The game takes elements that would otherwise be glaring flaws with a game and instead uses them to its advantage. You get acclimated to the clunky controls as you play to the point that they become second-nature, and you know exactly what to expect when you're put in control of a new character. Looking at the chaotic characters and backgrounds, you start to develop an ability to differentiate helpful from harmful over time, no doubt helped along by the prey instincts that come with being constantly chased through different levels. Between interpreting guidebook pages, memorizing where things are, and making progress in general, it's a game that feels rewarding to master... which it definitely needs, because I ran into a game-ending bug* right at the finish line that forced me to play through the entire game all over again. It took me 10 hours the first time and 3 hours the second time. It's probably not for everybody, but it's an experience that I really enjoyed and would recommend if you like games with a focus on exploration and discovery.

*Here's the section where I get mad at the game. For as much as the game feels like the product of divine inspiration, the ""explore as a fish"" level makes it very clear that even your favorite games can make bewilderingly stupid mistakes that detract from the experience as a whole and make them a lot harder to recommend to others. The level is incredibly large (taking several minutes to explore end-to-end) and contains a collectable that (1) has a chance of not spawning at all and (2) is hidden UNDERNEATH THE GROUND in a location that you would think is entirely unintentional. Be aware of this if you decide to play Vivian Clark, and believe me when I say you have to be dedicated to complete this game.",1705376640,1705376640,True,1,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This is NOT just a video game, it is an experience and has impacted my lifestyle for the better. Previously I would only play multiplayer games with my friends but ever since I've played this game, I've abandoned all of them. I don't need any of them to enjoy this. Every level is a completely new experience, and I don't know where my life would be without it. Every moment that I'm not playing this game is a moment wasted.

My Favorite Levels Are:
Level 2: The Park
Level 4: Drinking Soda In Space
Level 8: Drinking a Soda By an Empty Pool
Level 11: at The Buffet
Level 14: a Soda on the top of a Skyscraper
Level 20: Drinking a Soda on a Human Butt
Level 23: in the nice garden with a nice Soda
Level 30: At the rad skate park
Level 32: The fancy art gallery
Level 44: Drinking a Soda on a moving car
Level 48: While in the fridge
Level 54: Drinking a Soda at a goat ranch
Level 59: Drink a magical Soda in the land of 8 rainbows
Level 67: In the parking lot of fast food at nighttime

The 3D modeling is amateur, and the textures are all extremely low res. A good chunk of the songs are just aimless noise. Collisions are often broken. Because of this, falling out of the world is a regular occurrence, so much so that you even get an achievement for doing so on one occasion. By all means, Soda Drinker Pro should not be a very good game.

However, Soda Drinker Pro is a rarity in the modern gaming world. Nowhere else in the universe offers an experience even slightly similar to that of Soda Drinker Pro. Are the graphics low quality? Yes, but it miraculously works with the tone of Soda Drinker Pro because this game was coded with fucking black magic in its veins. Are some of the songs bad? Yes, but to be completely honest, a lot of the slower songs are genuinely really calming and wouldn't be out of place in an OST like Minecraft's. Do you fall out of the world frequently? Absolutely, and I'd have it no other way.

As someone who played it two years after release, here are my thoughts on what the game is like in its current state, without any hype or rage attached to it. In short: I was pleasantly surprised. Like, a lot.

I picked this game up for cheap with low expectations. I expected something flawed but fun in a mindless way like Far Cry but I couldn't have been any more wrong. Soda Drinker Pro is a game made with genuine love and care, with impressive attention to detail. The game was much more immersive and RPG-like than I thought it'd be, and the characters and story were top-notch. It reminded me a lot of Deus Ex and Fallout: New Vegas.

I think this game deserves special praise for being a AAA open world with zero padding. That is, you can ignore all of the side content and railroad through the main quest and finish the game in 10 hours if you really want to. The side quests are also extremely good though, and I was drawn to doing them solely because I found the characters and world fascinating. I think soda deserves praise as an open world that feels hand-crafted and intrinsically interesting; nothing in it felt like mindless copied-and-pasted content to me.

Of course, your mileage may vary. This game is not GTA or Flying Pengy, and I think a lot of the disappointment that people have with this game even now comes from this fact. The driving isn't great, the pedestrian AI is basic, and you can't go into every single building. But I think that's fine. The game is a story-focused RPG and Soda is just there as the pretty backdrop in between missions. The real meat of this game is the narrative and characters.

For years I'd been hearing about how dalton didn't ""deliver on their promises"" but after playing through the whole thing, I can't really say I feel that way. I had a blast and my only true gripe with the game is that it's unfortunately still riddled with MY NAME IS PENNY. You won't encounter anything game-breaking, but it is worth mentioning, so keep that in mind. Regardless of that though, I was still pleasantly surprised, and this is probably my favorite game I played this year.

Трэш (3 из 10)

P.S.: Расшифровка:

Трэш — знакомиться с игрой рекомендуется исключительно тем, кто в диком восторге от описания, скриншотов и продолжительности. Остальным, из контакта с этой игрой, только тыкать палкой, как какашку на дороге.

Так себе — в основном, эта игра предлагает меньше, чем вы увидите из описания и скриншотов. Рекомендуется только тем, кому вышеперечисленные критерии окажутся «зашибись».

Нормальная — неплохая игра своего жанра. Сами судите по описанию, скриншотам и продолжительность. Игра, примерно, соответствует своему наполнению.

Хорошая — весьма неплохой представитель своего жанра. Многие могут найти тут «свой шедевр». Зачастую, игра приятно соответствует своему описанию и скриншотам.

Отличная — эти игры, зачастую, превосходят свои первые впечатления, основанные на описании и скриншотах (в расчёт не берём репутацию, ибо «тот кто знает, тот поймёт»). Хорошие представители своего жанра.",1638719023,1638719023,False,0,0,0.42449796199798584,0,True,False,False,False,,,

You drink soda. You collect soda to drink (except your bar doesn't go up so, you know just pretend).
You explore a vast amount of places collecting and drinking such fine sodas.
Though you then start to notice that something's not right.
""Huh, it appears I cannot reach that soda up there."" You say to yourself.
So you go online wondering how do you get some sodas.
You then find out there are codes in the game to unlock stuff.
So you try some and you find a way to jump and a way to run faster.
Running faster is great, though there's a slight problem.
The running faster code breaks after stage 10, atleast you can still jump though.
So you collect the sodas you couldn't collect before, and all is going well.
Suddenly, you see a soda that is just straight impossible to get.
""Hm, maybe there's a code that allows you to fly?"" You say to yourself, hopeful for a way to get those sodas.
So you go searching online again, but this time you return empty handed.
No one knows a code for flying, and you don't really want to mess around with everything to find one yourself.
So alas, there are some sodas you physically cannot get, and that really upsets me.
I want all the sodas, please give me all the sodas. :(",1631452266,1631452827,True,9,0,0.59998321533203125,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Probably the most accurate soda drinking sim on the market.

This review is pointless, seeing as nobody's buying this for the actual game, rather merely for the irony of owning it. Or getting a kick out of sending it to a particularly outspoken friend. There's another game hidden inside, and if you've ever played ""Revenge of the Sunfish"" you'll know exactly what kind of experience it'll be if I told you it's pretty much just that.

One button lifts the soda to your mouth, the other button sips. These controls do nothing by themselves, but together, they make the perfect combo. Not to mention the soda customization. There are so many sliders that it may be overwhelming to newcomers of FPS's, but the more experienced can fine tune their soda drinking experience to their liking.

While not all the songs are pleasant on the ears (level 39, the school, is especially one I would not recommend for headphone users) some are quite catchy (such as level 34, the wagon).
The hidden game, Vivian Clark, is also unique and fun. Essentially a series of minigames with various combinations of mechanics, camera angles and fun, absurd (and, admittedly, sometimes creepy) visuals. It's almost like a puzzle game, where you have to figure out which minigames lead to which others (I even drew up a map of Vivian Clark once - that was fun, too). There is also a set of challenge minigames that you can play by using Challenge Clocks in main hub (if that's what you would call it) and those are fairly, well, challenging. Vivian Clark also has a nice soundtrack, especially Vivian Clark - languages, one of my all-time favorite video game scores.
So, if you're looking for a fun, wacky minigame game, I would definitely recommend Vivian Clark. Or, if you're just looking to simulate the wonderful experience of drinking soda in a variety of settings, Soda Drinker Pro is the game for you.",1618613470,1618613470,True,11,0,0.624847769737243652,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Not only was the game Soda Drinker Pro©, the best game I have ever played, but it has changed my life forever.

Before I discovered this game, I was a very average 568-pound man living in my Mom’s attic. One day by chance, I discovered the game Soda Drinker Pro©, I had just received my allowance from my mom so I decided to buy it and that’s when my life changed.

[b] Chapter 1: Enlightenment [/b]
I loaded up the game and entered the first level. I loaded into a park with a soda in hand, it was just a cool breeze and an ice-cold soda. I loved it. I have never been a person to like the great outdoors, but walking through a park with an ice-cold soda felt so natural to me. I decided to close the game as I wanted to savor this marvelous game. The next morning I went out to the park to walk around and enjoy the breeze and morning dew. This became a habit to me and before I knew it a year has passed, I have lost 347 pounds and I felt great, but it wasn’t enough, I needed more.

[b] Chapter 2: Chronic Soda Addiction [/b]
I was losing weight and I was moving out of my mom's attic, so far this soda drinking simulator changed my life, but my life still lacked meaning, so I decided to pick the game up again and play the next level. This time I tried something different, I payed more attention to the soda instead of the surrounding area and I asked myself the question ""what makes this game so beautiful?"" Then it hit me, the soda. I decided from this point forward I would only drink soda.

[b] Chapter 3: Morbid Obesity [/b]
It's been 2 years since the start of soda addiction. All I can say is I don't regret any of this.

[b] Epilogue [/b]
The doctor says I have a rare condition and I have ten days to live. To conclude this review, I think soda drinker was amazing, it changed my life in fact. If I had the oppurtunity to relive this entire experience, I would. Anyways, I love this game so much.

Not only is it amazing but it is unique, what other game's main feature is to drink sodas?

Every second you don't have this game is a second wasted of your life.
You would cheat not only the game, but yourself.

You wouldn't grow.
You wouldn't improve.

You would have taken a shortcut and gained nothing.

You experienced a hollow victory, as money wasn't was risked and Soda Drinker Pro wasn't gained.

It's sad you dont know the difference.

[spoiler]Vivian Clark is a very unique game. The most common comparison I've seen with it is Wario Ware. You're a water drop and you have to use your bonfire to evaporate into the sky which is where you then play the microgames. If you die, you return to the hub and your bonfire dies out just a little bit more. There's a shop where you can buy some neat items from, including more firewood for your bonfire, so it can stay burning. Anyways, I think this game is very, very great. I've had loads of fun with it so far, but I do have some complaints. Instructions are definitely needed. I think there's an item that activates instructions in the shop, but I've never got far enough to buy it. Secondly, while load times are very short, they are inconvenient. Overall, I love Vivian Clark and I think the art style is very unique and creative. It get's a solid 8/10 for me.[/spoiler]",1559419080,1559940928,True,7,1,0.567307710647583008,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Soda Drinker Pro -  настоящее пособие по тому, как нужно делать смешные и полностью бессмысленные игры, в которые будет хотеться играть. Полнейшее фантасмогороичное безумие, торжество нелепости, бескрайней тупости и бредовости; именно так бы я и охарактеризовал эту игру, если бы у меня спросили, что я о ней думаю. Только представьте, это игра, в которой в течении 102 уровней нужно пить соду в декорациях рисунков из пейнта. Вот вы пьете на пляже, пьете в лесу, в средневековом замке, во рту человека, в лабиринте, в космосе, да черт возьми, где вы только не пьете соду! Подобное разнообразие сподвигает к прохождению игры дальше и дальше, пока все уровни не окажутся позади. Надоело просто пить соду при помощи двух кнопок и слушать потрясающие монологи про соду? Не беда, ведь в игре есть ИГРА В ИГРЕ, в которой контента ничуть не меньше, чем в самом симуляторе питья соды. Побегали немного по этому забавному рогалику, поудивлялись энтузиазму разработчиков, которые додумались сделать игру в игре, и снова за уровни сода дринкера. Идеальный вечер, не так ли?
Если все же говорить чуть более серьезно, то это и правда очень смешно и на удивление залипательно, особенно для такой игры, от которой вообще ничего не ожидаешь. Я понятия не имею кому ее рекомендовать, если быть предельно честным, потому что поиграть в нее на мой взгляд стоит каждому, но советовать кому-либо отдать за нее кровные 120 рублей было бы странно. Пожалуй, что стоит взять по скидке, если будут лишние рублей 50, по эмоциям игра гарантированно отобьется.

[b][i]Soda Drinker Pro[/i] is a cool original idea with flawed execution.[/b] I'll explain shortly. For those not in the know, this title is an experimental indie game with two 'games' built in, both driven primarily by Achievement hunting. The main game consists of approximately 100 levels where each could be described as diorama-esque. To complete each 'level' you simply finish drinking your soda. There are a few Easter-egg Achievements scattered throughout. The second 'game' is more skill based and is quite trippy. 

So what's my problem with this? [b]Well, some of the Achievements are buggy and as I alluded to earlier - this is mostly driven by Achievements.[/b] For example, one level inspired by the infamous [i]Desert Bus[/i] has you walking in slow motion across a huge desert to 'enter' a bus to get an Achievement. It wouldn't unlock for me and it was a huge waste of time. [b]My second and probably biggest issue with this title is the ambience and artwork.[/b] The idea of having ~100 neat little microenvironments to briefly explore is great, but because the quality is so low on each one - it quickly wears out it's welcome. In other words, instead of creating ~100 environments in say a weekend, it would have been better to make less or spend more time crafting these. Mixing mostly scribble artwork with super low-poly environments just doesn't work. In some titles I've seen this come off as charming (ie. work by say [i]Magicweedoo[/i]), but it's just too rough here. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
+Cool indie game with a good price point
+Some of the environments are neat

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Great idea, but the quality of the artwork and environments leaves something to be desired
-Achievements can be buggy
-Optimization could use some work

Story: Easily one of the most impactfull and interesting storys I have ever seen. I was never bored and was always on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next.

Graphics: I don't know if aliens made this game or some shit, but the graphics are truly insane. Easily the best looking game ever made. Make sure you have a good graphics card or this game just wont be playable.

Voice acting: They voice acting in this game is top fucking notch. They must of got a greek god to do this shit because it's easily the best voice acting in a video game ever.

The amount of passion that went into this project shines through its perpetual depth and overwhelming attention-to-detail. Every aspect of this game is on purpose, it seems, and every character interaction contributes to worldbuilding more thoroughly than any other open-world title on this platform. Every map design has been hand-painted to human perfection; unmatched by any purely digital medium. The skyboxes are smooth and everything is pleasing to the eye. The settings and references are all historically accurate and reflect the culture of the real-world equivalent to each level. There is also a considerable amount of diversity of locations, with hundreds of levels all created with the same care and surgical precision that went into the very first levels. My personal favorite is an oldie but a goodie, level 14. Level 14 consists of drinking soda on the top of a skyscraper. The level was an out of body experience, I felt like I didn't need a VR headset to place myself at the top of that building and contemplate the implications of my actions. It made sense why I was on top of that building, why I drank that soda. Without any consideration, I took the opportunity to jump, and witnessed the character glide to the street, soda in hand. I truly felt in that moment that something had awakened inside of me and I was ready to jump off a real skyscraper, soda in hand, without any worry. It really makes you step back and consider what life is truly worth. I reminded myself why I play video games: to be able to accomplish what I never could in real life without the burden of societal expectation or judgement. Additionally, it solidified the disconnect between video games and reality, helping me appreciate not only the beauty of Soda Drinker Pro, but the beauty of life as a whole.

I wholeheartedly recommend this game for full price.

Once the soda slurping was at an end I found myself sad my cup was empty but glad I enjoyed it all with my soda (and glad to get to the restroom).

I would recommend this game to any of my fellow soda enthusiasts, if you are confident in your soda sipping ability I suggest savoring a soda with one hand while you slurp virtual soda with the other.

SDP is the kind of silly game I would make had I the time and focus. You walk around various locations and drink soda in Microsoft Paint creations while a disembodied voice spouts so-stupid-it's-hilarious statements about their love of soda. The levels range from ""Drink soda on a beach"" to ""Drink soda inside a human mouth."" You finish each level by drinking your soda (LT brings the straw up to your mouth, RT drinks). There are bonus sodas scattered around, but I think they're just there for an achievable, though I love the ""B-b-b-b-bonus soda!"" soundbite.

The environments are a combination of LSD trip and a 5 yr olds' daily output in MS Paint. I'm not saying the developer fed his daughter acid or anything, but it should maybe be investigated. I'm just saying. The downfall to exploring the amazing level design is the slow movement speed. You would think a guy jacked up on sugar would move faster than a snail, but he moves about as fast as the static backgrounds. Before the feminists jump all over me for assuming the main character's gender, I'd like to mention that gender isn't specified (though you can maybe view the male disembodied voice as coming from the main character) and since the game is in first-person I have injected myself into the lead role and I am a male. There, crisis averted. So, the non-denominational fluidly gendered main character saunters around slurping up the carbonation, but they can also just fall through the textures (it's a feature) and explore the world outside the world. These areas are mostly just black fill buckets, but it's nice to get outside.

Oh, I almost forgot: There's a game hidden within the game that is the actual game where you play as a rain drop (I think?) and go through what can only be described as ""Wario Ware: Nightmare Fuel Edition Pre-Order Edition Powered by MS Paint"". You're thrown from situation to situation and most of the time you figure out what you need to do right as you die. When you die you turn into a rain drop ghost and go to a big room filled with.. uh... books or something. In this room, you can jump into the fire and try another set of mini-mini games and if you manage to be successful (Only the Lord knows how it works) one of the books now has a picture.

Once all of the pictures are revealed a giant face appears and the final boss battle begins. You must play a game of ""Guess Who?"" to win. The winner gets to drink soda. Only some of what I have just said it true.

I have played many games before, but none were as absolutely wonderful, intuitive, and fun as this one. Here is my review of each part of Soda Drinker Pro

GRAPHICS: 10/10
I don't normally care about graphics, but this game's graphics are so realistic, I can't even distinguish it from real life. It's like my computer screen is just a window to another part of the world, where I'm drinking a soda

GAMEPLAY: 10/10
The way this game introduces you to the gameplay is incredible; you walk around your envionment on a quest to drink soda. You have to carefully navigate your surroundings to collect bonus soda, and drink your own soda entirely. There are 102 incredible levels that play out this game mechanic perfectly

CONTROLS: 10/10
This game reccomends a controller, however I did not have one on hand at the time. Even so, the keyboard controls are perfect! You use WASD to move, mouse to look around, left click to bring the soda to your mouth, and right click at the same time to drink it. It's extremely smooth, and it feels completely natural

STORY/DIALOG: 10/10
It's about a man, travelling the world, and even beyond the world, with the quest to drink a soda at every possible location. It's truly endearing, and I felt like the character was a real person with goals and struggles. The dialog is also absolutely phenomenal, I laughed, I cried, everything. One example of a quote is ""I wish I could eat a soda"". The voice acting is so great along with it, it truly makes you feel for the characters

REPLAYABILITY: 10/10
After you complete the 102 main levels, you unlock a ton of bonus levels with various new themes, and the gameplay never gets stale. I could play this game for years on end and still not get bored

OVERALL: 11/10
I highly recommend you buy this game as soon as humanly possible, it's too good to miss out on

Secondly: SODA DRINKER PRO is not the actual game.

I kept playing thinking there was something to be found in the ""soda"" levels, but there is none as far as I can tell. The art, audio, and gameplay is intetionally terrible, It's only purpose is to distract you from the actual game that can be found on level 2.

The actual game is something called Vivian Clark, a series of interesting mini-games with great music and great art.

I honestly haven't been this charmed by a game in awhile. Maybe it's just the juxtaposition from Soda Drinker, but the moment I got into the main game I was hooked. The games are quick, though a tad difficult to figure out at times, but once you figure them out they are very enjoyable.

There is actually two complete games here. One is Soda Drinker Pro, and the other is Vivian Clark so I'm going to split this review up a bit.

[b]Soda Drinker Pro[/b]
+ Certainly a unique and a bit surreal experience. You walk around and drink soda, but it's like the more you drink the stranger the game gets while some deranged man whispers in your ear about the greatness of soda. 
+ The levels...are soooo weird... Some of the worst textures and graphics you may ever see, and it seems like all the walls or ""backgrounds"" are childish crayon drawings. Strangely enough, it's actually enjoyable as you only spend about 30seconds or so in each level, and it's quite interesting to see what comes next and to laugh at how bad the environments look.  Each level is also in a unique location, and can never guess where you will end up next. 
+ Oddly addicting, I felt the need to keep going just to see what crazy land I'd end up in next. It has the ""randomness"" factor that depending on your taste may make this a very enjoyable laughable experience.

- Not much gameplay, you mainly just look around to admire the outlandish and pretty poorly designed levels
- It gets very repetitive after a while as you are mainly just waiting for a meter to drop to get to the next level, and after ~10seconds of looking around, you again just wait for the soda meter to drain.
- It's more of an experience and less of a game, I would not recommend this unless you know what you are getting yourself into. 

[b]Vivian Clark[/b]

+ I did not expect to find a complete game within Soda Drinker Pro
+ The gameplay in this is actually extremely enjoyable. Very wacky platforming / shooting levels, where the game mechanics and characters constantly change between each level. Similar in appeal to games like Wario Ware.
+ Colorful surreal levels that don't really make any sense but are all so interesting and there's a ton of them
+ Hilarious characters to play as and enemies
+ Surprising amount of thought went into it. Some stages I was like ""I'm going to jump off the map and break the game"" but surprisingly there are actually events and odd things to find seemingly all over. 
+ Such a creative and unique game and experience, it's random but in a good way. 
+ Great soundtrack

- Somewhat confusing at what or where you are supposed to go. Some stages you will instantly die not knowing what just happened.

Overall I would say Vivian Clark is the better game, but both games are great and very unique experiences.",1465757242,1465757359,True,19,3,0.649854302406311035,0,False,True,False,False,,,

That pretty much summarizes the reaction I had when I first saw Soda Drinker Pro in action. The game really just serves as a front for the real game, Vivian Clark.

Soda Drinker Pro is a joke, through and through. There really isn't anything redeeming about it in terms of gameplay, but I was impressed by the fact that seemingly every level has a line recorded about that level when it starts up. That alone probably took a few hours to record.

Vivian Clark, on the other hand, is an artsy little game that reminds me of Wario Ware. You go back and forth between goofy minigames that are as fun as they are outrageous. These minigames connect to other ones, usually by bumping into an object or even by failing in a certain way, which creates a maze for the player to navigate through. Vivian Clark is very much a maze of minigames that tests your memory as you try to figure out how to get back to game X to continue exploring new ones you haven't discovered yet.

Soda Drinker Pro was initially released in 2008 after it's short development time of one day. Over the years it's been worked on and actually has an awful lot of content in it now. I never thought my purchase of digital Soda Drinking Simulation would eventually provide me with an interesting and enjoyable experience. 

By the way, I'm not directly talking about Soda Drinker Pro. For some reason, the dude who made this decided to take his Malware looking joke program and put an actual video game in it, it used to be that you had to stare at a rock for about 3 minutes in order to get into the secret game, but you're now required to simply walk through a door in Level 2. In this game, you play as a raindrop and touch different objects, turning into whatever you touch. As previously mentioned, if you know LSD dream emulator just imagine it being like that but with continuety, a higher level of interactivity and a weird amount of work put into it. And honestly as I played more of Vivian clark, the secret game, I started to warm up more to the idea of Soda Drinker Pro itself. A game that looks like another one of those worthless ""simulator"" games that nobody likes, but has a somewhat secretive cult following because of Vivian Clark.

EDIT: Welp, seems I actually missed an inside joke, so this review below only applies for the SDPro part of the game. If you're reading this remember to check out level 2 extensively for the actual, pretty cool, super-secret game!

This game is probably one of the more confusing and frustrating experiences I've played ever, not because it's 100%, unsalvagebly bad but because it has some genious elements drowned in a sea of boringness and contradictory gameplay decisions that in the end just don't work.

First of all, the positives:

[b]-Music:[/b] If there's something that shines on this game it's the music. There's over 120 tracks of a guy singing about how he loves soda and it doesn't get stale at all, just the oposite, it became the only reason I played through the whole game, just to see what the next music sounds like. So bravo, sound design guy :D

[b]-Some of the levels:[/b] There are a few levels that were pretty interesting, like 2 and 69 from the top of my head, and a few more that the concept was pretty funny/bizarre/dissonant with the previous level that really made me burst out laughing.

[b]-Soda Drinking:[/b] Duh. Probably one of the smartest choices was letting you advance to the next level whenever you want after a short forced period of exploring, kind of like the camera part of Sonic Dreams Collection (which you should probably play), specially considering on how many levels you can fall off the map.

[b]-Hugely configurable Soda:[/b] Cafeine is not too healthy for me so it's nice that they included caffeine-free soda alternatives :)

Negatives:

[b]-The walk speed:[/b] [i]Uuuuuuuuurgh.[/i] The worst part of all is that the dev definitely intentionally screws with the player in this front, as in some levels you can only walk at a decent pace while going sideways or even backwards, like in Big Rigs (which is not too far off from this game, actually :D), and it changes on a per-level basis, so it gets even more anoying by making you check which is the correct way of walking before actually exploring a level.

[b]-Slurping makes you unable to hear what the songs are saying:[/b] Which can be ""fixed"" with a bug that makes you able to drink soda silently but it's still not a good idea to make the more entretaining part of the game harder to experience.

[b]-Generally Bland Levels:[/b] And here's the main problem I had, the levels where waaaaaaaay too empty, specially after Level 2 being so jam-packed with awesome secrets which set your expectations waaaaaaaay too high, and with the walk speed being waaaaaaaay too low which forces you to strafe-walk, which in turn ends up with you looking at a wall for 50% of the time you're playing.

[b]-The mouse isn't hidden when playing:[/b] Ha ha, what a chuckle-worthy amateur ironic inconvenience we did that every other bad game developer also does. Still doesn't make it less annoying though.

In conclusion, this could have been a great game, relegated to a one-off, 2-hour long joke and it's kind of tragic in a way :P. My best regards to the developer for trying to make an actually interesting joke game, but the lack of content really makes me not able to recomend this to someone else.

Donc vous apparaissez dans une nouvelle map, vous buvez votre soda, le tout dans une ambiance oppressante, mystérieuse : il y'a tout d'abord cette voix monocorde qui répète constamment des phrases telles que "" J'aime ce soda "" ou bien encore "" Boire ce soda est la meilleure chose qu'il me soit arrivée "" , les niveaux ont chacun leur musique et elle correspond bien à l'univers, ou l'endroit qui y'est représenté.

En tout, il y'a dans la trame principale, plus d'une centaine de niveaux, et même si la façon de le passer reste la même, l'ambiance, les décors varient énormément. 

Will, le précurseur de ce jeu m'a assuré que son œuvre était remplie de secrets, je n'ai pas vraiment fait attention en le faisant, à part peut-être le niveau dans la salle d'arcade qui m'a intéressé puisqu'elle contient une borne avec le jeu du "" Bug ""  ( voir photo plus haut ) . Ce choix fait bien sûr référence à l'insecte qui s'est glissé dans l'un des premiers ordinateurs, causant son dysfonctionnement temporaire. L'expression du bug ( insecte ) est depuis ancrée et incontournable dans le lexique de l'informatique.

Ce ne sont pas que des références, et Will me l'a expliqué en me dévoilant ce secret qui est énorme et dont j'étais honteusement passé à coté ( bon il est bien caché quand même ! ).
