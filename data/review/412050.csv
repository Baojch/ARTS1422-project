Le jour ou j'ai installé mon Vive (il était 20h), comme tout le monde, j'ai joué à à The Lab.
Et vers 2h du matin, je me suis dit allé, achéte un jeu de Zombie.
J'ai pris celui ci et j'ai compris à quel point on pouvait se chier dessus en VR.
Le jeu n'est pas parfait, mais suffisamment beau pour être immersif.
Ce n'est pas un jeu d'aventure, c'est un pur jeu d'arcade.
Le personnage avance lentement dans des décors la plupart trés glauques.
D'ailleurs, je pense que c'est un bon jeu pour s'habituer au ""Motion Sickness"" car ca bouge constamment et doucement.
Niveau Zombies ils sont bien flippants.
Pas beaucoup de zombies différents, mais correct tout de même.
Le selecteur d'armes est parfait.
Niveau campagne, de mémoire il n'y a que 10 stages, c'est un peu court, mais le dernier est un stage statique de 100 vagues que je n'ai jamais réussi à finir.
C'est le jeu que je sors pour faire tester la VR à mes potes (pas mes copines, elles seraient trop effrayées).
Tous ceux, je dis bien TOUS ont eu peur (moi y compris).
J'ai un ami qui a hurlé à la mort. Et quand j'ai récupéré les vives controllers, ils étaient dégoulinants de transpiration (signe qu'il a eu trés peur).
Je suis habitué à la VR, mais ce jeu, je n'y joue jamais sereinement.
On a peur de se faire surprendre, que ce soit au bout d'une partie ou aprés 1 an à le jouer.
Trés bon jeu, simple et défoulant.
Bon jeu à tous.

One of the initial attractions to the game was co-op play, but the game is too easy with more than a single player.  Even with two players, the hardest difficulty isn't that challenging.  Meanwhile, with three or four players it's a joke as you can just fire in all directions at once, resulting in absolutely no challenge.  If you do play this game, I'd recommend playing it solo which results in a much more tense and atmospheric experience.

This game is VERY fun! But not for people who are easily scared. The game feels ""complete"" and plays exactly like the shooters from the arcades.
When i'm saying complete i mean that everything works, i'd wish there were more skills in reloading, i would really wish the devs would implement a reloading system like the one they have in Hover Junkers.

Was on the fence due to discussion of the enforced locomotion, but actually I barely notice it in the game, and when I do it's more of a strange sensation that passes.

I guess it's down to the slow and constant movement in a single direction.
This slow movement makes total sense for the game which is essentially a shooting gallery on wheels.

I bought HordeZ when it came out and though OMG this is amazing. A year on now I'm over the initial OMG everything VR is is totally amazing, I have a more mature view of VR titles. I really like the on rails shooting element in this game it works well in this context and the pacing is good. There's plenty of levels with very different environments, all good stuff, great variety.

Now the bad bit. The zombies, a bit terrible really. The game has only a few zombie models which are duplicated, which in it self is a bit poor, but worse they march towards you in a pack completely in step like marching soldiers, which just looks rubbish. The models themselves aren't great either, they really need better animation and detail.

This is the thing, so much of HordeZ is really good, but. And it's a significant but, the zombies are just a bit rubbish and it does spoils the game overall.

HordeZ ist für Leute die wie ich momentan einfach nur wenig Platz für Bewegung haben ideal, denn man steht auf einem ""Gleiter"" und bewegt sich langsam über das Areal. Das Ganze wirklich ohne dass einem übel wird!!

Es greifen Horden unterschiedlicher Zombies an, leider sind es nicht soviele unterschiedliche Untote und man kennt relativ schnell alle Gegner.
Trotzdem macht HordeZ wirklich Spaß, ich habe hier in einem Stück gleich 2 Stunden verbracht ( und war natürlich immer noch  nicht am Ende ).

HordeZ könnt ihr single oder multiplayer spielen, ich habe aber nur SP probiert und war davon schon begeistert.

The zombies, besides the obviously horrible graphics, have such poor animations and react so poorly it renders this game completely not fun.

The shooting and combat in general has little to no feeling to it and is completely unacceptable in a VR game. Shooting them triggers a generic flinch animation regardless of where or how you hit them, chunks of some grey stuff comes off when shooting them but the model doesn't change, and the sword does not react to their body at all besides their head (which causes them to explode into different colored chunks of random bodies).

There is very little content and what little content there is quite frankly looks horrible and isn't fun. It's just so low quality in every aspect.

I know there is not much good zombie content out for VR at the moment but please do yourself a favor and don't settle for this garbage.

Even though you're on a rail through the play area you can still move around within your physical play space and make use of shooting around obejcts or step back away from zombies to give yourself a little extra shooting room.

★場景與怪物細緻
遊戲中的關卡非常多，並且每個關卡都有不同的地形與場景，從陰森的研究室到廢棄城鎮到下水道應有盡有，緩慢移動中還能從各種角度來探索地圖，怪物也會從各種意想不到的地方串出來攻擊你。
怪物種類居多並且不同怪物之間也有不同的屬性與能力，一些怪物甚至還有不同的弱點部位。

★超強打擊感
游戲目前提供手槍、衝鋒槍、散彈槍、手榴彈與日本武士刀，每一把武器的手感都非常獨特且充滿打擊感，是這款游戲最大的特色之一。

★音效逼真
360度的環繞音效在這款游戲中不折不扣地表現出來了，怪物在附近時你能準確地利用聽音辨位來知道怪物從哪裏出現，但怪物經常會從不止一個方向出現，這時候就要考驗你的反應力了！

★武器設定平衡
每一把武器都有存在的意義！手槍提供均衡的射速與攻擊力，散彈槍則是近距離高傷害但緩慢的射速與裝填速度，衝鋒槍則是攻擊力較弱但射速超快，而太刀的各方面表現則是取決與你自己的手速-w-+
武器間性能平衡很出色，讓每一位玩家都能用不同的武器來展現自我風格，像我最愛的武器組合就是：左手拿手槍右手拿武士刀！帥！

★新穎的子彈拾取系統
在擊倒怪物之後有幾率掉出各類子彈與補包，可以用游戲中自帶吸取槍(重力槍?!)來吸過來為自己進行補給，但由於重力槍..啊不是...是吸取槍，需要一隻手來拿，所以很容易在拾取的過程中被怪物偷襲得措手不及，非常考驗你的時間觀念。

★Arcade式組隊 - 樂趣無窮
除去以下缺點中所寫的以外，游戲雙人組隊時能享受到類似第一人稱死亡之屋的闖關快感，在擊殺怪物之餘還能挑戰地圖中各種小彩蛋與手榴彈投籃(把手榴彈丟進地獄之門能獲得高分數)，關卡結束後還能觀看計分版來[strike]跟好友互嗆“廢物啊你 xD”[/strike]，是一款非常難得而經典的多人合作體驗。




[h1]缺點 & 建議[/h1]
▼武器模組粗糙/準星不準
遊戲中雖然武器與武器能力都有明確的區分，但是模組實在是太粗糙了，加上準星瞄準的地方與著彈點差蠻多的，所以對於武器愛好者來説是一個致命傷。
建議更新武器模組、調整準星與著彈點，這樣會讓游戲精緻度直接提升一個層次。

▼部位破壞系統粗糙
怪物被爆頭以後雖然有顯示爆頭分數與提示，但是除了骨頭碎裂的聲音與番茄醬多了一點以外並沒有特別的反應，甚至連傷口都沒有。
而被散彈槍或手榴彈直接命中的怪物則是直接散成一堆内臟與屍塊...而且每隻怪物的各個部位都一模一樣，特殊怪物甚至無法部位破壞。
雖然死亡動畫做得不錯，但是僵屍被爆頭以後是否應該在頭被轟成碎片之餘身體也因應被衝擊力彈飛會比較好呢？
建議被爆頭的動畫需要重製或取消動畫採用類似這樣的衝擊力：

還要加上明確的部位破壞！

▼移動方式較牽強
遊戲中提供了兩種移動方式，緩慢移動與瞬間傳送，雖然是因應玩家眩暈程度而決定，但兩個移動方式實際上都設定的不太好，緩慢移動依舊會導致偶爾的眩暈，而瞬間傳送則是太突然，怪物都還沒清完就突然把你傳送到怪物群中讓你措手不及。
建議在傳送前加入倒數或其他的提示方式，讓玩家知道準備要進行傳送了而有所準備。

▼沒有好友邀請/備戰大廳系統
沒有好友邀請的功能導致如果要與好友一起進行遊戲，必須要求對方自己去找房間加入，而且遊戲創建房間後會強制開始遊戲。
建議在遊戲開始前增加一個備戰大廳來讓玩家等待朋友、準備與更改遊戲設置。

▼沒有王怪
關卡與關卡之間沒有王怪來當結束點實在太可惜了，減少了游戲的挑戰性。

▼人擠人擋子彈
游戲中如果同時超過4個玩家加入的話將會擠成一團，有室内空間的玩家還好可以站到旁邊去，可是對於只能站立的玩家來説非常不公平，子彈很容易會被隊友擋住。
建議在多人加入的時候微調玩家間中心點的位置，至少讓玩家之間不會重叠在一起。



[h1]個人評分[/h1]
[i]8.5/10[/i]
[h1]極度推薦!!![/h1]
《HordeZ》可以說是第一款非常成功地繼承了死亡之屋精神的Arcade、殭屍、動作射擊VR游戲，雖然單人游戲較為乏味，但多人游戲卻出乎意料之外地樂趣無窮。
雖然以上所提及的各個缺點確實影響到了游戲樂趣，但并不影響游戲本身製作用心，且樂趣無窮的事實。
作為VR獨立開發游戲中的佼佼者，也是目前在Steam上少數讓我覺得必玩的VR游戲之一，我非常期待這款游戲接下來的發展方向，也在這裏推薦喜歡VR射擊游戲或殭屍游戲的各位來親自嘗試看看！",1474786556,1474984651,True,7,0,0.525293171405792236,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Unfortunately, from the last update, this game has just fallen so far from where it stood.  They have tried some good things, but it just feels like there isn't enough forethought, or there just isn't enough experience with developing a game, because it's just turned into a garbled mess.  I've played multiplayer matches, trying to have conversations, but because there is no way to lower the game volume, or raise the communication volume seperately, as soon as action happens, you won't be able to hear the other players.  

Many cases of monsters being up on the level above you, as if the monsters think your character is up there, causing piles of monsters to stack.  While it is entertaining when they eventually find where you are at, but odds are, those monsters will either destroy you, or you are shooting so frantically, your chance of getting a good score is almost nil.  The tractor gun is broken in multiplayer as well, working about 10% of the time.  While the developer tried to fix this by allowing you to shoot your ammo, they put a mechanic in where using the tractor gun nets you more points.  So they know it's a system that doesn't work, but they reward you for trying to use it?  What?  

A single player experience works decent on this, but for me personally, gets boring, fast.  Upping the difficulty to try and make it more exciting only falls flat on it's face for most levels.  They tend to start off with multiple entry points, and when you set it 4 or higher, you quickly get overwhelmed, once again removing your chance of getting a good score.  

This game is great in concept, but implementing half-baked ideas is not going to get this game anywhere, soon to be forgotten in the piles of wave-based shooters.",1472924960,1472924960,False,1,0,0.443181812763214111,0,True,False,False,False,,,

After the wave based shooters that get boring after a few rounds, due to repetition and seeing the same environment over and over again, I was worried if we wouldn't see something break the mold and bring us something new and refreshing.  Fear not for that game is here!  When I first think of the term ""Vive on-rail shooter"", I think ""bring your barf bag"" but these developers were smart and came up with an ingenious way to work around vertigo: move VERY slowly.

You move at a walking pace and it doesn't cause ANY motion sickness at all.  Given the context of the game - a zombie apocalypse - it makes sense that you'd be walking slowly too.  Even if each level amounts to 10 minutes of walking down a few hallways and killing waves of zombies as they spawn from predetermined points (and a few other enemy types thrown in for good measure), it's a breath of fresh air to constantly be seeing new terrain and feeling like you're heading towards a goal other than ""get the highest score"".

Each of the 3 levels i've played so far have had a unique look, none of them wear out their welcome, and I constantly feel like I'm moving forward so I don't get that ""Damn, died at wave 2.  I think i'm done with this for today"" feeling.  This is a step in the right direction and it feels good to play.  The weapon selection menu, one you get use to it, is very snappy and the game got a couple good startles out of me when zombies would catch me off guard because I didn't pay attention to my rear for too long.  Ultimately, I wouldn't say that this is a very scary game.  Instead, it's just a fun time killing zombies.

I'm definitely looking forward to playing more and putting in some multiplayer time (which seem slike it would be a blast).

During the growth of Virtual Reality, many major studious are in no hurry to declare and develop new experiences for such a niche market, this is where small indie developers of HordeZ come in. 
This game strongly resembles and reminds me of Doom, as it is filled full of mutants, blood and weapons.


HordeZ is a great and engaging game with an awesome atmosphere. As you enter the game, you are greeted with a very well thought out menu which at first, you might get a little bit overwhelmed by the choices, but with time it all makes perfect sense. 

Once in the actual game, the first thing you notice is the immersion factor, it is huge! You get to pick from a variety of levels that throw you in to a static setting or a movement based progression of a certain level. The atmosphere almost reminds me a little bit of Alien Vs Predator as it is very dark and you are forced to look around because mutants are on their way, and you only have your ears to rely on.

The sound design of this is great, not going to make anything up. The weapons have great sound effects, and the mutants and creatures, of how good do they sound creeping up on you. You will have your heart pumping!

One thing to consider is the AI/enemy movement system. During my play through, I have noticed that sometimes the monsters would path in a weird way and clump up or simply cut their speed to a slow walk once they are close to you. I wish the developer would tweak this or give the power to the player to disable this effect to truly unleash chaos should one want to. 

The multiplayer is another thing this game is focusing on and I give the dev my praise for it. Having managed to find some players to try the coop, I faced only one failed attempt to join. The game was perfectly smooth otherwise with no noticeable client side lag.

Once the movement system is ironed out and multiplayer has its final quirks worked out, this game is great nonetheless and does not take away from the experience. Great game, a great buy from a well supporting developer who pushes updates regularly, especially focusing on Co-op multiplayer. A must own from me if you are anywhere near a fan of any type of Zombie shooter or Arcade based Chaos such as Doom, Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead!

Haven't played a multi-player game yet but looking forward to it. Single player is back to it's former best. Haven't play on all the levels yet but so far so good. Pew pew pew. Die Zombie die.

(I don't normally leave reviews but since the last release this game had become unplayable. It's gone from my favourite game in VR to my least. I'm now lucky if I get to play a round in either multi player or single without it crashing. If the game does actaully get past the main menu and I get into a round (single or ""multi"") I don't always get any weapons. This is probably lucky since there aren't any Zombies to kill either. 

On the odd occasion that I can choose a weapon as soon as I select anyting it jumps back to the mneu screen and then I can't get any further. Boot game - crash, re-boot - menu - nothing, re-boot - menu - crash, re-boot - start round - crash. Get the picture?)

I understand that this is a game in progress but the devs seems to have gone backwards rather than forwards.  A solid three thumbs down untl a fix goes in to sort out the current issues.",1470599804,1471809913,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Having said that, it’s still a fun little shooter. The gameplay is super simplistic compared to those other two games I mentioned; ammo is all lumped into one giant ammo pool, reloading has no real input or action from the player, and there’s no recoil or bullet spread to counter. It just all makes the world feel simple and flat. While Raw Data is a early VR shooter, it feels polished; whereas HordeZ really does feel like an early VR shooter. Since it’s so cheap and the constant movement aspect to its level progression actually adds some tension, I do think the game is worth it. If it were priced at the same as Raw Data, then I’d say Hell no to it.

Yes, it has a lot of bugs and things that needs to be fixed ASAP, and It still feels as an unfinished product that still need’s a lot of work, but the experience especially when playing co-op is so immersive and awesome that you almost don’t mind all the issues it has.

So, here’s a list for what needs to be implemented \ fixed in the game in my opinion:

1. Microphone support for push-to-talk in multiplayer\co-op. (MUST-HAVE FEATURE!)
2. Bug - The player avatar permanently crouching while playing multiplayer\co-op.
3. Bug - Sometimes monsters glitch above the ceiling.
4. Better interface for playing multiplayer\co-op (right now when you create LAN game it starts the game immediately even when your friends didn’t joined yet).
5. Can’t pause the game in multiplayer\co-op. (MUST-HAVE FEATURE!)
6. Friendlier user interface and menu interface (the menu to change weapons\pause the game etc…)

Edit: After the #6 update this game is awful, it’s really a shame and I’m very upset about this! They Removed LAN support in the last update and now they want money for the ""advanced Commercial license"" that will support LAN support!? Seriously? It's outrageous and totally unfair and I bought 5 copies of this game because of the LAN support, they never said they will remove it before. I changed my review and gave Thumbs down just because of this awful update.
The developers need a much better Communication with the community and it's really not ok that they just remove content from the game (Like LAN support) without any notice.
Once they change \ fix all the issues and bring back LAN support I’ll change my review.

Edit: There are still many issues to the game, like, there's no shotgun in the 2D weapons UI and some more (I posted everything I found on the forums).
But they (basically him, it’s a one man show – one dude created this awesome game) just added LAN support and fixed the voice-chat issue, so I’m bringing back the thumbs up!

Thanks a lot, and I hope you will fix all the other issues of the game ASAP.",1470306178,1498421396,False,0,0,0.485802710056304932,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Getting rid of the multiplayer lobby system was a big mistake. The game is bugged beyond belief and unplayable.

It does not start all players in the same location if someone joins mid match, usually causing a glitch in proceeding or zombies to act wierd and not travel to the correct player locations.

Seriously, buy it...

Here I'll start with the bad:
Still unfinished, so know that going in.
Does not like steam voice, and crashes game, sometimes Steam it's self
multi player still a work in progress and has a long list of bugs
Seems something is always ""broken"" again though... not completed, so all these issues should go away...Should.

The Good.
It's fun. Seriously a good time to play.
Slightly creepy but not to over bored where you wouldn't want to play yourself in an empty house 
Good amount of mobs! 
Good pacing! That's right, the waves of mobs come in well and you are MOVING, not tied to one spot.
Multiple choices for moving to keep yourself from getting motion sick if you are prone to it. 
I had zero feeling of motion sickness even after hours of play.
Multi-Player! Great fun with friends and with strangers alike! 
The action keeps going. Rarely are you sitting there just waiting for something to happen, the breif pauses are just enough to catch your breath. Perfect really. 
Multiple difficulty levels.
Decent looking art work for mobs

Active Dev team that listens to the comunity! <--Needed it's own line, they are really involved and it's great.

Over all, if you are looking to only get one... HordeZ or Brookhaven, Brook is a bit scarier for a few seconds at a time, where HordeZ is a non stop blast. You'll have to deal with the constant changes to the game still, and the fact that not all of it works correctly but that's while it's in progress The Dev team is fantastic though and I have faith they'll keep working until it's a well polished title.

It absolutely freaked me out the first few times I played it.  The blob guys and the little dwarf zombies freak me out the most.  The game is on a rail, so moving around isn't that big of a deal, but it still helps to have a larger room space so you can move from one side to the other when the zombies change how they are entering your surroundings. 

Pros:
1) You feel like the terminator sometimes when you're mowing down realistic zombies
2) Graphics are great for VR
3) The game being on a rail makes it more like a shooting gallery with limited exploration (to me this makes it fun, for others it might be a con)
4) Great feel, great atmosphere
5) Probably the best shooting game for the Vive (why aren't there any 'call of duty' style games yet?)

Cons:
1) Multiplayer doesn't work, I can see the games other people are on, but it won't let me join
2) Grenades are good way to kill yourself, but not the enemy (also, I have thrown dozens at the portals and not a single one has managed to explode)
3) Shotgun weapon runs out of ammo quickly and feels kind of pointless
4) Portals that are worth extra points seem to do nothing
5) A bit scary for younger kids
6) Sword swings seem to be somewhat useless and a bit under-powered
7) Picking up ammo with a tool sucks on the harder modes, you should pick them up automatically when you point at them with any weapon (or even shoot them) or you should just get them when a zombie drops them - another problem with this is that at times you accidently get minus points when using the automatic weapon on a crowd of zombies because the loot crates blow up

I know I listed a lot of problems here, but it's still beta.  Give this a shot, it is one of the more polished and fun games for the Vive even if you can only use it for single player.

As a zombie fan, I've logged hundreds of hours into Left 4 Dead 1-2, Nazi Zombies, Dead Island, Dead Space 1-3, etc. None of that prepared me for HordeZ on the HTC Vive. My first experience of the game was terrifying:

-The zombies are BIG. They loom over you.
-The zombies are fast. They sprint to get close before they slow down to a walk and flash their teeth/flesh inches in front of your face. This allows them to quickly get behind you for a good scare when you are distracted.
-The environment is dark and creepy. You look around and you aren't in your house with your friends anymore. You feel alone and nearly helpless.

Honestly, it's difficult for me to find the strength play this game. I often end up quitting before the zombies get too close. Even when I know it's just a game and I stay calm, something about the presence of the zombies in VR gives me a feeling of dread that I've never felt before; my ""fight or flight"" response goes haywire and I need to get out of it.

Here's a list of things I think this game needs in it's current state of developement:

-Larger, prominent blood effects. It's difficult to tell where I'm shooting the zombies. Proper blood effects would let me see how accurate I am.
-Improved weapon models/animations. I want to feel like I'm shooting real guns.
-A game mode where the world is brightly lit and colorful and the zombies are replaced by teddy bears and only come from one direction. Please.",1467152527,1467152527,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The levels are varied and the weapons are fun to use, it's also a very scary experience.

The first playthrough is still fresh in my head, abd boy, did it give a few surprises! I have only had my Vive a few days (well, 1 1/2 to be exact, as I refused to buy one until it was available without the ridiculous shipping charges) and this was the first shooter I really tried. 

So.. start the game, and wait for the load. Next thing I know, I am in a corridor, and can hear moaning (and not in a good way). It gets closer, and theres nothing there. I start looking round, and realise theres a 6 foot zombie behind me who wants nothing more than to eat my brains. WAAAH!!! Shoot zombie! Shoot next zombie!A surround game takes a bit of dealing with, after playing on a monitor, but after a minute or so it feels completely natural.  I made it round a corner, and ended up being swarmed. At which poiint a sword appeared, and it was slash, slash slash like an idioy hoping I could make it. Hits came in from everywhere- try to shoot a zombie in th eface but no, out of ammo- and I died. I admit I closed my eyes till it was over :)

was it fun? oh hell yes! A dark atmosphere, lumbering zombie that just felt like they were real, and eventually figuring out how to get ammo (dont shoot it, use the middle gun on the selector) made it a bit better. OK, a LOT better! 

The Good
More a reflection on the vive, but the immersive atmosphere makes this a totally different experience to anything I have tried before. It really feels like you are being attacked- or chased- or eaten alive.

Amosphere again- the devs have given us a wonderful feeling of those dark, dank places that have haunted us forever. It captures the feeling of being alone, then swamps it with ""Oh god I am not alone- I really, really wish I was!""

Weapons- they work. Not in the sense of shooting, but they feel right. Selection is easy (technically) but when things get frantic, trying to change over is the hardest thing to do. It gives you the real sense of panic that you need.

Enemies- so far, they work. That little bit more time aiming for the headshot gives you a greast feeling of satisfaction that you crave, as opposed to the spray and pray that seems to be everywhere these days.

Simplicity - yup, simplicity. No complicated mechanics, no endless go here, do that goals, just a straightfoward shoot, shoot shoot. It gives you what you want- and it does it well.

the Bad.

Let out a little bit of wee on the first playthrough and had to change my trousers :)

replayability - its going to get a bit old after a while, but at the same time, does it really matter? Headshotting zombies is ALWAYS fun, and playing over a level you know lets you prep for the next wave.

Overall, I love it so far. Any game where you play and think its 5 minutes later, only to find out its an hour, is value for money. Will I keep playing? Absolutely!",1466332082,1466332082,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Levels aren't particularly interesting, I feel that a lot more could have been done for variety, elevators, shooting from a vehicle, all sorts is possible with what they have here.

Whereas many of the current offerings for the Vive are a bit anemic on features with future promises of greatness. HordeZ is a complete and completely fun game right now.

It may look like standard zombie shooter number 2,009 in the videos or stills, but as anyone can tell you, it's a completely different experience when you are in VR playing it.  The zombies are suddenly as tall as you, lumbering towards you from all directions.  But HordeZ is much more akin to an arcade shooter than it is a horror game.  There aren't really jump scares here.  Just lots of ammo and lots of zombies to put it in.

Pros:
-Full feature set including 9 levels, multiple dififculties, online play up to 4 players, and endless mode
-Great level variations with new enemy types on harder difficulties
-Very easy to pick up inuitive controls with a smart ""slow locomotion"" system (you are on a hover board) making it a lot more user friendly, even for those with more sensitive stomachs

I wanted to write this review so this game will be updated and playable again, as it was the most requested game from my friends to play.

The game prior to this last update was very immersive and fear-inducing.  The last-stand mode was particularly enjoyable.

However, as of the last update, the guns no longer show muzzle flash, although the ammo count on listed on the weapons does go down.  Also, the death animations no longer work for the zombies, and after you have shot them enough to kill them, they simply stand still for a bit, and then disappear.

Hopefully the devs will fix these issues, as I would like to have my favorite Vive game back.  Until then, I would say this game is now unplayable.

Should this game get fixed, I would wholeheartedly recommend it for purchase.

-Mowing through different types of zombies trying to eat your face off in VR is an exhilarating experience

It handles the VR movement issue well as the ""on the rails"" mechanic just melts into the background when battle commences.

I love how fun melee with dual kantanas in VR is, so you can play out your walking dead fantasies and feel like a bad ass.

This game is untimately let down by the weapon selection controls, but this is beyond the devs control as there simply arent enough useful buttons on the Vive controller for decent hardcore gaming. That means its either the track pad (yuck) or flailing in the air for weapon selection. As you would expect this sucks and is frustratingly the reason for ""game over"" other than bad ammo management or lack of aiming skill, sigh -_- Valve just love their trackpads when an actual button would work so much better.

Still, it's fun, lets you pop on your own music for an undead battle and gives you a katanna. Definately worth the price of admission and is the best shooter on Vive right now, but with Brookhaven's release imminent that title could be up for grabs before long.

The guns are also poor.  Very unrealistic and unsatisfying, and they look like toys. The bizarre shotgun-thing particularly bad. The weapon selection device is a pain (and has to be seen to be used), and I frequently selected the wrong weapon multiple times.

Enemy design is not good.  The basic zombies come in so few models that it feels like shooting up a clone army.  Monsters run up to you until they are a couple of metres away, then start a slow shuffle, which is obviously for balance purposes but looks totally artificial. The dynamic damage systems are nowhere near as good as L4D. Also, your character floats a bit off the ground, which makes all the zombies look much smaller than you, negating much of the scariness VR can bring.

Update on my review. After playing in Multiplayer witha couple people my review is to still go out and buy this game. VR Multiplayer is just awesome !!! Hard mode on this game is really hard and that is good. So much fun. 
DId I say to go buy this? Please. You will not regret.
I can't fathom how you would not like this game. Especially in multiplayer.
There are some quirks and the devs are working on it but it does not take away from the fun factor. Get a friend and go to the game lobby. One starts a server and one joins. Hit start or ready and then good to go. Start killing zombies. Enjoy. For the price it is well worth it. Support VR developers if you have a VR system. Let's get this ball rolling and let the world know VIVE is here and here to stay. VR is here and here to stay.
Update again: This is in response to whatever negative reviews are out there. For $15 this game is well worth it even with whatever quirks you may find. The game is not broken except in the net work connection area occasionally and that is being addressed. I mean what do people expect from games like this? It is an arcade shooter basically so every hit won't be exact and sometimes you will get swamped. Who cares? That is what makes it challenging. Are people so unintelligent these days that they can't find ways to beat the game and work around the quirks? It is one thing if coding makes the game boring and easy but another if you can still finish a level with some annoyances that make the game harder. Everyone wants free and easy these days. I am very happy with the VR community right now and how receptive they are. They all deserve good ratings for their efforts to get us games out as fast as they did. Yes a few VR games may be trash but this game is not one of them. That is my thoughts whether they are worth reading or not. If you have an issue then just send a message to the devs. They are listening but at the same time if something needs a fix then that may take some time. I am still having a blast with this game.

Benign issue, the Katina when held in the left hand is upside down. Please fix!

There appears to be a few decisions which were somewhat corrected in the latest release.

First it appears that the game slowly moves you forward through the levels by default. An automatic teleport option has been added that apparently keeps pace with the auto forward mechanic. This is substantially better, however I constantly run into instances where the game teleports me in the middle of a legion of zombies. There's also a blinding flash when this happens which makes it very hard to figure out how you've been teleported, what direction your facing, and where all the zombies are. This should really only happen when a player chooses it to happen, or after the current zombie wave has been killed off.

Secondly the default weapon selection is rather bad. When pressing the trackpad a number of bubbles appear around the controller and you need to move your controller into that bubble to pick up the weapon. It's similar to Hover Junkers of those to know, but is worse. The much better option has you selecting weapons in a pie menu on the trackpad. This is similar to Space Pirate Trainer, but not as good. I've tried to choose the center option by just tapping the trackpad, but it never works. It seems you need to rub your finger around and then release. You also can't run your finger off the edge of the trackpad (like SPT) or the menu is apparently canceled. There is no audio or force feedback when selecting a weapon either. Worst of all, the shotgun is inaccessible with this option.

Speaking of the center weapon, the tractor beam, I don't really understand why this item exists. The tractor beam solely exists to magically grab items which magically pop out of dead zombies. An item this magical seems very out of place with everything else in this game. I'm not sure why the decision was made to have this instead of of allowing you to just shoot the item like you can in games like House of The Dead or Time Crisis which this game is mimicking in VR. What is even more puzzling is that you loose points for shooting these pickup. You'd think you'd get bonus points for electing to not pick up ammo and powerups. It's not like you'd shoot this on accident. The frequency of drops is also so often that when combined with the finicky nature of weapon selection it basically means you need to have it out all the time; eliminating dual weapon usage to only once you've played the game multiple times and know exactly whats about to happen. It's a real bummer.

The combination of picking up items with the poor weapon selection really takes a lot of the fun out of this game.

That said, there's clearly only one weapon you should ever use unless you run out of ammo with it; the pistol. Not only does it do more damage than any other weapon, but you also score bonus points for racking up consecutive headshots. The assault rifle is incapable of doing this due to it's recoil, you can't select the shotgun with the better weapon selection, the katana is too short to kill anything without you being injured and the grenade can't headshot.

The grenades are however good for scoring bonus points on ""portals"" which you only know about if you read the convoluted starting lobby. The grenades however don't make any sound, just a flash of fire and splattering body parts if you hit anybody. Same goes for the exploding zombies.

That said the sound that the game does have is rather good. Many games have poor 3D positional audio, but this is one of the rare areas which the game excels at. There are no weapon swap sounds, there are no hit sounds, there are no damage sounds, there are no explosion sounds, weapon fire is generic, all zombies sound are generic; however the positional audio is quite nice.

Catch is, a lot of people like this game; I don't know why. There's something here that could be improved into a good game, but I think that would involve destroying a lot of the game which a lot of people seem to like. Good for them I suppose. Personally I would not recommend this game. Play The Brookhaven Experiment demo instead, if that doesn't catch you fancy then wait for another zombie game, if you don't want to wait I guess you buy HordeZ.",1464402269,1464461735,False,1,0,0.495642691850662231,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Anyone who had ever enjoyed rail shooters like House of the Dead must own this game. It is an excellent buy at $15.

Then there is the replay value of trying to improve your rank on the leader boards. It is just cool beyond words having the undead coming at you from all angles as you move through he board. They will actually startle you at times when they sneak up on you. The latest updates have addressed a lot of issues mentioned in previous reviews - I find the new weapon selection system a significant improvement over the old once you get used to it, it has additional options for movement if the ""coveyor belt"" style movement bothers you (I am prone to motion sickness, but this game does not bother me at all - it just makes me feel like I am still moving after I stop playing if I have been playing for more than 30 minutes - like feeling like you are still on a boat once you get off), and the collision detection and invisible wall issues in earlier versions seem to have been corrected.

I am really hoping they come out with more levels or a sequel. I would pay for a good DLC level pack, as what is already included is 100% worth the $15.

If I had to suggest any improvements for this version, I would love to see more variety in point values for things like long shots or catching them while they are still running, and more variety in zombie character models and/or animations.

This game hasn't aged well. It was great when VR games were fresh and new. Now there is plenty of competition that is more compelling. Still fun though.

I actually like the moving platform design so I can focus on looking in all directions and being prepared. The weapon selection could still use a bit of work, but the developers listened to the feedback and implemented motionsickness fallback options in the game.

To start, I will say the experience in this game is completely different in coop and single player. Technically, everything as a guest in a coop game a is a little janky, but that's easy to look past if you aren't too picky. From a gameplay perspective, it's a lot less stressful having a friend watching your back in, and that's a good thing. 

Coop is frenetic, fun, and exciting. Me and my friend will have each of us take two directions to watch and hope we don't get overwhelmed. The game is challenging on it's easiest setting and that's not a bad thing, as it leaves you with stuff to come back to. 

Price-wise, it's about perfect at it's sale price of $15.99. Unfortunately a lot of the bugs in this game feel like an early access title, but the price sort of makes up for that. 

Honestly, if you have a friend to coop with don't pass this game up. Here are my few issues with the game that stem from coop. 

Coop bugs: 
-When logging into game it assigns you an IP address. This is pulled from your gateway, which is often the same as other users. For my friend and I to play together one of us had to edit our IP address. This also doesn't save and you have to do it each time you close the game. 
-Models are almost always in the seated position in coop, but if you shoot the air above a player it will still hurt them. 
-Models don't hold their guns, they are floating in front of them
-Animations for models basically doesn't exist, it just snaps to a few random positions. 
-The gun that allows you to suck in ammo doesn't work consistently when joining a game
-Shots have a delay when joining a coop game.",1463432206,1463432206,True,3,0,0.497966676950454712,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-Room scale VR is incredible! Game slowly moves you through the area on a floating pad, but you can still move around as much as you want in the size of the room you've dedicated to room scale VR, allowing you to physically dodge and run from zombies.
-Graphics/sound are fantastic
-You can either use guns/grenades and use a magnet gun to ""suck"" in ammo boxes as they fall around you, or (my favorite) you can just equip two katana swords to ninja your way through the area.
-$15.99 is an absolute steal. I would have paid $50 for this game.

The only possible improvement the developers could make is adding gamepad support so when the Virtuix Omni treadmill launches later this year, we can move about in the play area as far as we want to without worrying about hitting walls.

That the enemies come at you in ""lanes"" with an audio noise before they start at you makes this game work very well. It makes it so you have to react on multiple angles of attack, but you don't feel like things are all over the place out of control. 

The enemies are also fairly well varied with a decent selection of levels and difficultly. I think the game strikes a very good balance on enemy variety, difficultly, giving you ""oh crap"" moments without overwhelming you and letting you feel like a badass as you go all gun kata on zombies.

On the down side the UI needs work yet. Weapon selection is pretty bad to where I died more often to mis-selecting a grenade than I did to enemies. Also multiplayer looks to be pretty much a mess at the moment.

Super fun VR and a must have for shooter fans. The trailer really doesn't do it justice.

I was expecting a bland rail shooter experience, but with VR its so much fun. It's my first VR game that I look forward to playing again.

My first play made me slightly sick. The slow moving ""rail"" messed with my head. I thought I wouldn't be able to play it, but I got used to it quickly. My 11 year old son actually couldn't handle it and turned on the VR sickness options (recently added FYI, note for some negative reviews), which are a nice alternative. Additionally, playing through again using the teleport option makes for a different play approach.

My complaints/suggestions for improvement are 
- Audio. The monsters growls and foot steps seem to be one volume and its very, very difficult to determine which direction they come from. Big guys are sneaky quiet. Footstep sounds is horrible. So many footstep sounds overlapping it can sound like clapping.
- Trackpad weirdness. Switching weapons feels bugged. Rarely does it switch to the item I want unless I'm looking at it. Menu at the end appears when pressing the touchpad, but doesn't actually work until you press the menu button. Continue button doesn't do anything (wrt end menu) and options of Quit and Exit are confusing.
- Glitchy. Sometimes the shots go right through them. I emptied 3 clips into a floating skull without killing it.
- I suck at throwing grenades. Hitting the big circle portals is harder than it seems it should be. Now I only throw underhand, it is more reliable. I've had many self kills with grenade bouncing and rolling back. (It's a literal skill based weapon, which I wouldn't complain about, but it difficult to learn and improve given the game timing and tension and the risk of it rolling back and ending your game.)
- Swords and room space. Swords are dangerous in the room space if you swing them. I know this limitation and can adapt, but I wish I could disable them or something. Inexperienced players end up swinging erratically and the room bounds don't handle this well.
- End game statistics take too long to animate. Just show them or let me skip it.

These are small issues though, in a game I have thoroughly enjoyed and loot forward to playing more.",1462820043,1462820043,True,5,0,0.500924229621887207,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There's just something extremely satisfying about a zombie shooting gallery.  

I get that everyone is different when it comes to motion sickness / vertigo, but I had absolutely no problem with the extremely slow movement.  It moves slow enough to not upset gameplay (ie:  you can't just race to the exit), but fast / often enough to keep the environment fresh.  Controls took me a while (3 or 4 rounds) to get used to, but I prefer the current weapon switching to any over the shoulder bullshit.  Right now I can grab ammo out of the air and switch back to a pistol without bothering to look at all.  

The only real complaint I have so far is the grenades bounce too much.  

The only bugs I have experienced are: 

1 -  level 7 in the generator room - i start getting black textures and soon can't see even zombies.  (Reproduceable - fix this please devs, I have a 980ti and am not used to having textures not drawing).
2 - zombie which won't take damage other than a grenade (but has his eyeball fly off a dozen times as I empty a clip into his face)

As for the naysayers:  
You CAN adjust the tilt (maybe this is new, or maybe someone didn't bother reading the options)
You likely can't see tracers sometimes because of muzzle flash (i've seen it every time otherwise)
I agree the disc is lame, but hardly a show stopper
I can hear what direction zombies are coming from just fine.  Sometimes they take a long path to get to you, but If you want to complain about audio, why not riff on the fact that the fat zombie makes no sound at all?

$18 CAD is a bit high, but worth it in my opinion.

グラはしょぼいしストアページのゲームプレイにはマウスポインタがチラチラ映ってるしで期待していなかったがやってみたら案外面白かった。
しかしプレイしていくうちに不満に思うことも。
アプデでちょこちょこ変わったので最後にまとめてます。

【ゲームプレイ】
見ての通りVIVE向けゾンビシューターで敵を倒せばスコアが入り、ヘッドショット連続で決めればボーナスが入る。
所謂レールシューターで、プレイヤーは小さなホバーボードみたいな土台に乗り、各ステージをゆっくり自動的に移動していく事になる。
その為中にはVR酔いを起こす人もいるかもしれないが、救済措置として一定間隔で瞬間移動するテレポート方式もある。
ホバー移動とテレポート移動で道中のゲームプレイが変わると思うのだが、グローバルスコアは共通の模様。
ステージは9種類あり、町中や下水道などがある。
うち一つはラストスタンドという特殊なステージで全100ウェーブを生き残るサバイバル形式となる。
また難易度は5つ用意されており、難易度が上がると敵の行動パターンや攻撃力が変化する模様。

【良かった点】
・雰囲気がいい
暗い建物をすすんでいく中でゾンビがワラワラ近づいてくるのはなかなか面白い。
一部ステージはフラッシュライトがなければ何も見えないレベルで暗いものもあるため、振り返ってみればすぐ近くに敵がいたなんてこともある。
グラ含めて全体的にDOOM3を思い出させる雰囲気は良かった。

・狙い撃つ面白さ
ゾンビをヘッドショットするのはやはり気持ちがいい。
killing floorでsharpshooterな人にはお勧めできる。かもしれない。
できればヘッドショット倒した瞬間頭は弾け飛んでほしかったが。

・ある程度プレイスタイルに幅がある
コントローラは一つあれば本作はプレイできるため、銃一丁縛りや二刀流縛りとかできる。
まぁ刀縛りは、デブや近づいてこない骸骨相手には対応しきれない部分はあるけど。

【悪かった点】
・武器について
武器は4種類(ハンドガン・アサルトライフル・刀・グレネード)
ショットガンとかマークスマンライフルとかほしかったな。
持っていく武器を選べるとかプレイヤーのカスタマイズ要素もほしかった。
あとハンドガンはアイアンサイトで狙えるが、アサルトライフルは光学サイトの部分に残弾表示があり、光学サイトで狙うことができない。
代わりにレーザーサイトがついているので、それで狙えということなのだろうが、普通に狙わせてほしかった。

・敵の種類が少ない
この点は通常、防具付き、デブなど両手で数えれば足りるほどで、雑魚敵しか存在しない。
ステージの最後や一部はボス戦になるなどバリエーションが欲しかった。

・マガジンの残弾計算がおかしい。
ハンドガンは20発入るマガジンのようだが、1発撃った後リロードすると39発になる。(えっ？)
その上残弾数が20を切らないとリロードができない為、リロード厨が発狂しかねない作りになっている。

・一部マップの敵の挙動がおかしい。
下水道マップで上から降ってくるのを想定しているのだろうが、落下速度が超速度固定のようでどう見てもワープしているようにしか見えない。
いきなり音もなく目の前から敵が沸いてくる様はどうにかならなかったものか。

・自爆する敵の存在
低難易度の場合、プレイヤーの少し手前まで走ってきてはゆっくり移動に切り替わり、攻撃を受ける前に此方が狙い撃つ余裕がある。
高難易度はプレイヤーのすぐそばまで走ってくる為、近づかれる前に倒すとか工夫が必要になってくる。
ここまでは良いとして、雑魚敵の中には自爆する敵が存在し近づかれたらOUT。
即死ではないにせよ、道中幾度となく出現し、高難易度の場合、すべて対応するにはニュータイプになる必要があると感じるレベル。
このゲームのダメージソースは殆どこいつ。せめてある一部分を撃てば自爆しないとか、L4Dの様に押し返すことができればよかったのに。
これの居る・居ないだけで難易度ががらりと変わるはず。

・ラストスタンドの調整
100ウェーブのうち20位までは通常ゾンビしか出てこない。
その間ずっと同じような操作で、""作業""という単語が頭に浮かんだ。
その後は難易度が上がってくるが、上がり方が異常としか思えない。
30～40ウェーブ目でデブ4体同時出現、加え自爆ゾンビとか一人じゃ対処しきれないっスよ・・・。

・バグ
一通りプレイしていったが、2回ほどバグに遭遇
1つ目はマップが正常に読み込まれず、ある部分を跨いだ途端、敵も銃も消え何もできず死亡した。
2つ目は敵が不死身になるバグに遭遇。

・アケゲーとして
このゲーム、難易度を同じにしても出てくる敵が違う時がある。
同じ場所、同じタイミングで同じ敵が出現しないとスコア計算が人によって狂うんじゃないの？

【まとめ】
色々書いたが高難易度はプレイ必須ではないし、細々とした所に目を瞑れる懐の大きさがあればお勧めできる。
ただ、個人的には正直1,580Yenの価値はないかと思う。
今後もっと出来の良いタイトルが出てくるだろうし、セールを待ったほうが賢明だと思う。

【アプデについて】
今だ製品という名のアーリーアクセス感はぬぐえない。
・ショットガンが追加されました！(やったね！)
　けど、発砲時銃口から小規模の爆発が起きるだけの銃はショットガンというのかな！？
・武器選択ＵＩが変わった
　なれれば直感的に武器切り替えできるようになった。
　旧ＵＩも使えるけどショットガン選択できないよ！(なんでや)
・マガジン計算がまともになった。
　一発撃ってリロードしてもマガジン内弾薬は20発だよ！(やっぱバグだったんだね)
・刀はちゃんと降らないと攻撃判定でなくなった。
　今まで猫じゃらし宜しくちょろちょろするだけでOKだったんだよね。",1462610831,1463662982,False,11,2,0.677911102771759033,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I just felt I should take a minute to show this title some love. I received my Vive on Monday, 5/2/16 and spent a little time checking out the bundled software and The Lab, since it was free. From the moment I put on the headset I have been completely blown away by the VR experience. This stuff is really cool!! So after a few hours of time, spread out over a few days, checking out the free stuff I had, I decide to buy my first game. Out of the games on my wishlist I decided to go with HordeZ, on nothing more than wondering what it would be like to shoot some zombies on the Vive.

 I truly wasn't prepared for the experience I was about to have. LoL, To be frank, it scared the shit out of me!! In a good way though, kind of like that haunted house scary during Halloween when you get frightened and then have a laugh. The first time I started, it startled me so bad I snatched the headset off and sat on my couch laughing at myself as I drank a beer and regrouped. Ok... Now I know what's up, let's do this! I strapped back in and went for round 2!!! If you'd like to see me make an ass out of myself, I recorded it on my phone and uploaded it. Be warned, I curse a lot. lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxrzfXpBlb4 

I just want to say that so far, this has been the defining VR experience for me. The immersion, presence, fear, nervousness, it was all SO REAL and I loved it. Watching videos just can't convey the feeling of being strapped in to this thing. It looked and felt so unbelievably real that I think I will no longer make comments about preparing for the zombie apocalypse because this game taught me that I'm a big scaredy cat!! lol 

Good job on this game guys. It looks great and plays really well. There were a few moments when the moving platform made my legs feel a little wobbly, but never really gave me any severe motion sickness. This mostly happened when the platform started or stopped.  I only mention that as an observation, not a complaint as it really wasn't a problem for me. But I know some people or more prone to the motion sickness thing!!

I love that it moves! Even if it is on rails. The pacing seems just about right, although at times the enemy spawn locations are not timed correctly and enemies spawn in unrealistic locations. I know it's a fantasy game so how could it be unrealistic? Well, if I have my back to the wall and an enemy spawns on top of me...I'd say that is unfair. I also played almost half the level with only 5 zombies attacking me. There are also glitches with zombies running thru the door of the first level. BTW, grenades work way better when thrown underhand. Is that a tracking issue?

[h1] So... Things done well:[/h1] 
[list] 
[*] Moving health level to controller is a great choice. When I first played this game I didn't even know it was on the floor. Having it on my controller is great. For added realism, could it be placed on the player's wrist, like a fake watch?
[*] Speed of platform is perfect.
[*] Sword play is a great feeling!!! Although I don't feel the zombies always react appropriately.
[*] Increased size of zombies is defintely more intimidating! Especially for shorter players.

[/list]

[h1] Current faults:[/h1] 
[list] 
[*] A better way of incorporating rectangular play spaces to always be in line with the play space.
[*] When enemies get too close I see thru them instead of them stopping upon contact with me. When completely surrounded I sometimes have to shoot my self to kill them.
[*] Grenades don't always explode the portals. Is there a secret?
[*] The gear grabber sometimes gets stuck in the on postion, or lingers on even after I've switched weapons.

[/list]

[h1] Needs/Wants:[/h1] 
[list] 
[*] I'd prefer the weapon select to be a simple swipe, not a swipe and a click.
[*] A better way of incorporating rectangular play spaces to always be in line with the majority of the level's hallways. For this game I turn the floor chaperone on so that I'm not banging my walls.
[*] I'd like the sword to continue to make impact even when an enemy is dead.
[*] Decapitation with sword would be awesome sauce!
[*] Can I shoot the knee caps! It would be great to stop the explosive zombie in its place and then explode at will later with a well timed shot.
[*] Health wrist watch as mentioned above.

A couple things I think they need to address other than the bugs in the game is the floor plans of some of the levels making you go over zombies and fall on them unable to even see or shoot them and dieing to them as they attack is a very poor game choice. 

A tutorial that goes over weapons and zombies a bit more in depth IE armored units seem to not take damage at all if shot on the armor but will still die with a proper headshot if you can manage it. also reloads expends the entire clip instead of letting you use the remaining bullets

Let's break it down first lets get rid of the cons.

Cons:
1) The game is a little buggy. You may fall through the floor on the occasion, not a frequent bug. 
2) Sometimes the game freezes up or fails to load , but I've only had that happen about three times.
3) Weapon management could be better but honestly once you get used to it, it's not an issue. Kinda gives you that frantic moment of omg there's 10 zombies and I need my gun NOW.

Pros:
1) The game is overall just fun! I've been looking for a shooter and this game really hits the spot. It reminds me of a doom style game mixed with tower defense minus the staying in one spot. 
2) Yes the weapons are not realistic in mechanics but I don't think the developer intended to be which is great because the game doesn't need it. I love the swords, the machine guns are cool and the pistols are hard to use! 
3) The game is HARD. Which is awesome! I love a challenging game and this one is difficult. It sets it up perfectly for online play.
4) Graphics are really nice, dark and creepy remind me of left 4 dead 1 graphics. The game is really immersive and can be startling!
5) The rail movement. Now I know a lot of people don't like this but I think it's fun. It makes you feel presence a lot and if you do not get motion sick then PICK THIS GAME UP'!

Each level is unique and interesting with plenty of zombies to shoot. Two key tips: always watch your back, they come from every angle when you least expect it, and master headshots because you get great ammo drops that way.

Update: The game updates have been fast and furious. The devs really respond quickly to the community. You now have the option to teleport and play holodeck-style if the locomotion bothers you. Keep it up, devs!",1461938582,1462513210,True,11,4,0.480945467948913574,1,False,False,False,False,,,

It moves a little faster than I thought and when it stops and starts it can make you feel a bit funny. It would be better if it had some way for you to control the moment or stop/start it. My only other criticism is that for some reason it doesn't feel that satisfying to get head shots like it does in brookhaven I am not sure why.

Creo que seria mejor usar el teleport para moverve no permitiendo avanzar hasta terminar los enemigos de la zona.

Puede ser un buen juego pero aun le falta trabajo.

Edito: El juego va mejorando por momentos, sigue teniendo fallos pero se lo estan currando, cambio mi valoración a positiva.",1461924856,1463389619,True,2,0,0.497317522764205933,0,True,False,False,False,,,
