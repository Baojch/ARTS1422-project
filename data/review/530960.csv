-It's bad


0/5

I can't recommend something the developers ""Released"" only so they could abandon it and release something half finished. Also to make matters worse, it's easily one of the worst, laziest cash grab game types to come to VR, a Wave Shooter.

2/10

One glaring problem – the price to time played ratio. Thinking of other wave shooters such as Overkill VR or VR Invaders, it’s hard to understand how this one would even be an option. It boasts two levels – no customization and a simple high score table. Surprisingly, there isn’t anything interesting beyond the normal enemies – no bosses. Rom : Extraction’s focus is largely upon the orb which you can throw and shoot(explode) and destroy nearby enemies. Most of the power ups in the game revolve around this orb such as orb splits or orb homing devices.

Visually, the game is actually great. The enemies look great up close or far away. The explosions, especially in slow motion, look like a Michael Bay movie. Unfortunately, you get two levels and you’re done. Sure – there is difficulty settings and high scores to chase but its..two levels. The music slowing down when you use the slow motion is cool, similar to Space Pirate Trainer and it fits the mood of the game well. Controls are OK but the orb itself seems very high momentum. You can throw the thing as weak as you can and it takes off with a mind of its own. Using the slow motion to properly time exploding the orbs is critical to success.

Overall, there isn’t much to say about Rom : Extraction as it doesn’t give you much to talk about. It’s short and there is a lot of planned features but this isn’t an “early access” title. The creators say in the description “ROM: Extraction is a game that is not meant to end.” but the last update is 4/19 of 2017 – that’s not hopeful.

Final straw – It’s not worth it. Maybe $2? Maybe $4? I’m sure they spent money making the game but it lacks depth that over wave shooters offer in a similar price range. Thinking of all the customization and levels and objectives of Overkill VR which is the SAME PRICE on Steam – makes the choice laughable. In a sense, Rom : Extraction is highway robbery to purchase over other finished titles in the price range. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

Original Review below:

So I purchased this on the Halloween sale for $1.99 and I feel this game is exactly worth $1.99.  I think that price matches the content (quantity + quality).  However, it is not worth $19.99.  And I hate to give a positive recommendation when the developer has promised a lot of things, but has not delivered almost a year later.  

I wish there was a neutral recommendation on steam.  This is what the game deserves and also is reflected on the mixed overall review.  However, it's a nice little variation on most wave shooters.  Throwing the orb to make maximum impact on enemies is a unique changeup to most wave shooters.  

I don't expect much for $1.99.  This game delivered that.  I hate lying devs, I might change my recommendation to negative if they don't deliver at least on some of their promises  (more maps, more guns, multiplayer, etc.).  It's been almost a year.  I'll revisit this in Jan 2018/ February 2018.

Visually stunning, great sound and great gunplay, but short, very short. When I mean short you can complete the 2 levels combined in less than 15 minutes. Yes that's the entire game, 15 minutes. The levels are the first sections of the first chapter, the game is following some kind of story. That's not described but you can tell there's meant to be a plot.

The amount of content in this game, regardless of the polished quality is no more than a demo. This game is incomplete and should not be purchased until the developer makes this into a complete game. Go ahead, pay £14.99 for a demo, it's your money. I feel cheated and so will you when you reflect on how little there is. You can argue there's replay value in those 2 short levels, sure, but that will wear thin quickly.

My advice, add to your wishlist and keep an eye out for new content. If it's on sale then it's your shout whether to take a gamble. Just remember this game was released over 6 months ago.

If you want to spend your money, there are other VR titles around that deserves the money. Go buy Raw Data instead.

ROM: Extraction is, as of this writing (26 Mar), is lacking content, but more content will be coming soon according to the developer. It is a turrent-shooter title, whereby you stood in a fixed position and shoot at the robot enemies.

At the moment, only the first chapter is available, which is split into 2 segments. In both segments, you fight against enemies in some sort of a facility. These enemies keep coming from various direction, and after you are done killing, you moved to the next rea automatically, done by an automatic sequent where the platform you stood on, goes down deeper. Each of the segment takes about 7-10 minutes to clear.

One point that set this title apart is the orb gameplay element and the slow-down bullet-time element. The various types of orbs can inflict various effects, such as healing yourself, or lock an enemy in place and others. One common strategy is to toss an orb near the enemy, slow the orb and then fire at it to create an explosion that inflicts damage. This is a rather cool and fun mechanics in VR.

The quality of the title is very good and polished. There's no bugs whatsoever, and it is fun. Its one of the greatest shooter VR at the moment, but as it lacks content (which will be added), you should look elsewhere if you are looking for a meaty VR title now.

There is no room scale, it's a standing experience. Game is very fast. You need to turn around a lot.

In the right hand you have your weapon and in the left hand you have an orb ball. The gameplay works that you throw the orb ball on enemies, then you slow down the time and shoot the orb ball which explodes and kills the enemies around you. 

This goes surprisingly fast and makes fun so far. Further, you can pick up different orbs like explosion. 

At the moment there are only two levels. Not a lot, but it seems the developers working on more.

It is a good game to show off your Vive. It has nice effects, a lot of particles, great colour scheme and an easy game mechanic.

Don't expect  a Raw Data or a fully fledged game.

But even if you are sceptical to buy a nother wave shooter, I recommend to take a look on this for the sale price of 5 EUR.

DO NOT PLAY IT ONCE AND GIVE UP!!!

I see a lot of other reviews here talking about the ""amount of content"". I think those people are not understanding what kind of game this is. It's an ARCADE style shooter. The point is to replay it over and over to try to get a better score AND to have fun with it, doing trick shots and overall just enjoying the game mechanic for what it is.

Anyone here that said they ""beat"" the whole game in 12 minutes are idiots. No you didn't, you just played each level at each difficulty once and thought that's it. The first few times I played it was hard, I was throwing orbs and slowing to shoot, but it seemed like i was surfing the line between total chaos and being in control.

THAT'S WHEN IT CLICKED!! The key to this game is using the SLOW MO, use it A LOT!!! I can NOT stress how much more fun this game becomes when you start using the slow mo feature as much as you can. DID YOU KNOW that you can heal while in slow mo? It quickly becomes obvious that the trick to survival is milking that slow mo whenever you are starting to die. The fun for me also came in the realization that I DO have the time to plan each throw and aim with precision. To shoot each orb right in front of a robots face and watch that awesome rag doll take over. Once you get the hang of this game, it's easy to go in feeling like a badass! Neo style taking out robots one after another. Hitting that slow mo, then turning around just in time to see a robot flying through the air straight at me and shooting him in the head, decapitating him, right before he lands.... absolutely, BADASS!!!

Plus it's only $5 right now, I have eaten $5 of Taco Bell in about 10 minutes and never thought twice about it again. How are you people complaining about the worth of this game when it's only $5? I cant replay my taco bell....

TLDR: This game is meant to be replayed, its an ARCADE game. Not Skyrim. Give it some time to master the mechanics, there is a learning curve. And finally, use that SLOW MO!!! If you use it to its full potential, you can be like Neo in the Matrix.

ROM Extraction è un titolo che mi ha lasciato molto perplesso. Definito da alcuni una sorta di Raw Data un po' più leggero ma con una ottima realizzazione tecnica, si è rivelato in realtà un gioco oltremodo scarno e privo di contenuti. I temuti e oramai stantii ""wave shooters"" (ovvero i tipici giochi VR dove l'unico scopo è di resistere indefinitamente a ondate di nemici, senza poter esplorare ne avanzare nell'avventura) definiscono alla perfezione il prodotto, I cosiddetti livelli di cui è composto - un paio - sono una serie di ondate di nemici da affrontare dentro il proprio ""ring"" che sarebbe il vostro spazio chaperone. Tutto qui.

Volendo sforzarsi di trovare degli aspetti positivi, è sicuramente realizzato da personale competente, ha una discreta grafica (ma discreta è il massimo che si può dire in merito) ed una musica appropriata. C'è un menu multiplayer da sbloccarsi, ma il gioco è uscito oramai da mesi.

E' stato acquistato con il 75% di sconto, ma mi ha mortalmente annoiato dopo soli dieci minuti tanto da spingermi a chiedere il rimborso anche di questa esigua spesa, e dubito lo terrei installato anche qualora fosse un prodotto gratuito. Ci sono tanti giochi orribili per VR, fatti da persone alla loro prima esperienza di sviluppo, ma non è il caso di ROM Extraction: tanta pochezza non la si può proprio perdonare da un team navigato e men che meno a questo prezzo.",1488639949,1491151826,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Are we going to see where these aliens come from? 
What is ROM corp?
Are there other characters like me that are getting attacked?
Who was those guys talking in the beginning? Sounded like there was a group of people getting attacked somewhere on the ""ship"". do we ever see them?
Why are they attacking me? I mean, I get that we are throwing their eggs (which is pretty F'ed up of us to do so) but why ME specifically? Am I in some sort of ship that gets those eggs?

And while it looks great, and has some nice music, it's not really grabbing me in the same way that some other wave VR shooters have (Space pirate trainer). The principle is to throw orbs with one hand, then shoot them with a gun in the other, to make them explode like grenades. You also have bullet time, which slows everything down, making it easier to shoot your orbs.
There are power-ups you can shoot which then change your orbs behaviour.
There are two levels here, but the game play is well nigh identical for both of them. Throw orbs at robots, slow time, and shoot the orbs, boom.

Here is my first problem with the game. 
It requires you to throw orbs in VR, and they really don't often fly where you expect them to go. So you can throw a lot of orbs trying to get them to go into upper storey alcoves, where they really really don't want to go. 
Not only that, you really have to throw them with your off hand, since you'll be shooting them with your main hand.
So what the game is asking you to do is, throw accurately with your off hand, then shoot the orbs. Which is tricky, and can be frustrating. Plus using the Touch controller, it doesn't really feel like throwing a ball, possibly because you aren't, and also, because you can't really judge the weight like you could with a real ball. With the vive wands, I imagine it's not a lot better.

Which brings me on to the second problem with the game. 
You try and play this as a skill game, throwing and shooting orbs, and you will get a score of around 200,000. You can try harder, throwing, slowing time down, and shooting orbs. Several times. You'll consistently score around 200,000 before the time runs out and the level ends. OK.
But, you can also play, just spamming orbs in all directions, not bothering to slow or shoot them. Just randomly throwing them everywhere... without skill. You will score around 300,000. Which is a lot more, right? So where is the reward in playing skillfully? So the whole point of the game, and it's a score attack game, goes out the window. You'd be better off, if you could do away with the gun, and just throw orbs with both hands. In fact, if this was a water bomb filled with paint game, it might be a better, more fun game. It might even make more sence, since robots and paint wouldn't mix well. (Albeit ruining the future cyber punk aesthetic, for something more colourfully Nintendo-esqe! But then think how cool that neon paint effect in Tron Legacy was? It could work!)

Then there is the power-ups. You can't use them when you want, they are always the next orb you throw, so you might pick up a useful power-up, but have noone useful to throw it at. They also have some nice effects, like creating a trip wire, but the game is so frenetic, and with them being the next orb, you won't easily be able to make tactical use of them, and you'll probably just throw the orb at a nearby robot anyway, in the hope that it goes somewhere near them and does some damage.

Then there's the nominal, running out of health thing, because you are being shot at. Which is pointless, because, there's no point ducking for cover when there are so many robots in different directions, you are against the clock, and you have to see to throw orbs, and then shoot the orbs. Plus you never seem to be able to die on normal mode anyway, even when your health is apparently ""critically low"".

Then there is the bouncing of the orbs. When they bounce, they just accelerate away, in a ridiculous anti-physics way. So off the wall, bounce trick shots are impossible, because the orbs, post-bounce move too quickly to shoot, even in bullet time.

So, is it a great game? Not really, not yet anyway. Will I be playing it as adictively as that other wave shooter? Nope.

While room-scale is of course the ideal, until 'warping' has been figured out I find having a limited play area that never forces me to magically warp to another spot ends up working to keep me in-world. 

The one level that the game shipped with was certainly the main downside of the initial release. However withnew arenas coming through the pipe I'm pleased that the team are still adding to the game.

You do this by activating a ""reflex"" mode that slows down time allowing you to target your orbs with precision, giving you the ability to take out several foes with a well thrown and detonated orb.

The core mechanics are very solid and well implemented, the graphics are among some of the best I've seen in VR (I'd put them in the same league as Raw Data), and the soundtrack fits the fast-paced gameplay perfectly.

The only problem is that as of right now, the game has very little content to offer for the price. There is only one mode and one level available to play, with only its three difficulty settings to offer any sort of variety, but what's currently there plays, looks and sounds great and has serious potential to be a truly great shooter once more content is released.

　　在射击游戏中，枪械自然是最重要的武器道具，我们可以在一些经典的射击游戏，例如CS中都体验过各种枪支的更换使用，作为射击游戏的主要载体，武器的多样化注定可以为游戏增添不一样的色彩。而《ROM:抽离》却一反常理，在游戏中添加了新颖的武器配置，让射击游戏的玩法不再是单纯的枪械或箭矢的方式，也更加贴近游戏科幻的主题元素。

　　同大多数的射击游戏一样，《ROM:抽离》的玩法也是玩家通过手中的枪械，对侵袭而来的敌人进行攻击，不同的是游戏为玩家们准备了除枪击以外的另一种武器操作，可以与枪械配合使用，也可以单独使用，效果上非常绚丽，杀伤力也比枪械来得大。想知道游戏中到底有什么新鲜的武器配备吗?那么就一起来看看下面的详细内容吧。

　　内外配合战异形

　　游戏采取抢滩登陆的模式，玩家身处船仓的中心点，四周360°都可能会出现侵入飞船的机械异形，玩家需要利用手中的所有武器，尽可能的在有限的时间能击杀机械异形，杀得越多最后获得分数就越高。

　　在游戏者之外，显示器上还会显示一张地图，中心的绿色箭头代表体验者的位置，游戏开始后，地图上会出现移动的红点，就代表着敌人的位置。由于佩戴头盔的玩家在里面是看不到这张地图的，所以需要另一个人在外面看着地图中显示的敌人位置，提醒游戏中的玩家进行攻击，不然360度加上还有上下两层楼的空间位置，会让游戏者晕头转向的。

　　这里不得不提的就是游戏中独特的武器配置了，它们是拥有不同颜色的能量光球，玩家在空闲的手柄上扣动扳机按住不放，手中就会形成一枚能量球，将它丢向敌人就能杀死一定范围内的敌人，比手枪的单体薄弱攻击要来得有杀伤力。

　　根据能量球颜色的不同，对敌人造成的伤害范围以及效果都各有不同，我们来具体了解一下这些能量球的作用。

　　蓝色能量球，是游戏中最基础的配置，初始情况下玩家便拥有任意使用蓝色能量球的自由。主要有两种攻击形态，第一种是往敌人身上丢，命中目标后会直接爆炸杀死敌人，第二种是和手枪配合，将蓝色球抛向一堆比较集中的敌人，在光球抵达敌人附近时用手枪引爆它，爆炸波动范围内的敌人将会全部被消灭。

　　绿色能量球，除了蓝色之外的能量球，要获取只能靠怪物死后爆出，并且每次拾取之后只有一次的使用机会。绿色主要是单体攻击，对着怪物丢出此球，被击中的怪物会被绿色的光笼罩，最后爆炸而亡。

　　红色能量球，这个颜色的球不用特地瞄准投掷，只要丢在敌人身旁，它会自动化为红色的光袭击最近的一个敌人，适合单体攻击。

　　紫色能量球，同红色一样无需定向投掷，随机丢出之后光球会在墙壁之间快速弹跳，在弹跳轨迹间触碰到紫色球的敌人都会被击杀。

　　橙色能量球，也是随机抛出，在接触地面的一刹那它会遁入地面，化身橙色的光束连击周围的几个敌人，目前只出现了三连杀的情况。

　　黄色能量球，是目前游戏中的终极杀招，一般获取了黄色球之后基本这局的分数就不会很低，随意抛出黄色光球，它触碰到物体之后会瞬间分散，以迅雷不及掩耳之势在空间内扩散，然后在你还没反应过来之前，黄色的光线就密布了整个空间，最后基本整个空间内的敌人都会被全杀。

　　除了各具特殊效果的能量球以外，游戏还有一个有趣的设置，那就是按住手柄上的圆盘不放，场景内除了你自己以外，其他的所有物体运动全都会变慢，就如同《黑客帝国》中的场景一般，科幻感爆棚。

　　不过时间缓慢这个技能虽然好用，但是有一定的CD时间，所以大家尽量在重要的时刻使用，而且这个技能在使用蓝色能量球是比较好用，因为可以很准确地集中它，并且比较好掌握球的爆破位置，当然在慢动作时间能尽可能的多杀些怪才是王道。

　　游戏中手枪以及能量球的震动反馈也做得十分到位，手枪射击的后坐力反馈非常及时，能量球的震动反馈比手枪来得要强烈，在爆炸时两只手都能感觉带强烈地震动，体验非常真实带感。

　　游戏有普通、困难模式，每局都有时间限制，在规定的时间内玩家杀死越多敌人分数越高，游戏还有提供个人分数以及全球玩家分数的排行，可以跟不同的玩家们比拼身手，看看你究竟能够排在榜上的多少名。

　　眼花缭乱的光影

　　除了操作的震撼体验之外，游戏的画面效果也做得很棒。虽然在场景以及怪物的建模以及贴图上并不是很精细，但是武器的射击效果以及爆照的效果都做得十分绚丽，让体验者感受到一种炫目的射击快感。

　　游戏中的很多细节都做得很细致，例如子弹射出时枪口的瞬间闪光、子弹射出后弹出的弹壳、子弹射击在物体上擦出的火花以及子弹在建筑物上留下的弹痕等等，都能清晰的看到这类细节上的设置，让游戏显得更加真实立体。

　　游戏在能量球效果的设计上也是颇费心力，每种颜色的能量球爆炸时都有属于各自的光效，外围带着光圈，内部则化为细碎的光点扩散开来，如同烟花一般盛开随后凋零，有兴趣的玩家还可以使用慢动作技能来观看光球的盛放，看着夺目的光球一点一点缓缓地绽放开，也是一种很震撼的感观体验。

　　金属碰撞出火花

　　背景音乐也是一种很能激起游戏热情的东西，《ROM:抽离》中背景音乐节奏感极强，电子金属的乐感配合着激烈的射击，直叫人热血沸腾。

　　游戏里的音效与画面以及打击感相结合，放大了体验者的各项感观，让游戏过程变得更加酣畅淋漓，射击的枪声、子弹的摩擦声以及机械异形发出的声音充斥在耳边，给人一种混乱的紧张感，十分契合射击游戏的主题。

　　最为突出的还是能量球弹射、爆炸的声音，能真切的感受到能量球在空间能穿梭的速度感，“嗖嗖”地划过空气中，最后绽放并杀死敌人的真切音效。

　　总结

　　总得来说，游戏增添的新鲜武器素材为游戏增添了不少体验上的亮点，操作上的真实反馈加上绚丽的武器特效，配合着节奏鲜明的背景音乐以及回荡在耳边逼真的音效，都让《ROM:抽离》有别于以往普通的射击游戏，更具有可玩性。

　　目前《ROM:抽离》在steam上的售价为57元，可以说喜欢射击游戏的朋友一定不能错过这款游戏，畅快的游戏体验肯定让你无法自拔，虽然游戏玩法可能比较单一，但科幻的武器配置和刺激的操作体验绝对无可比拟，也推荐其他的玩家购买体验。

While we're glad you do think the game is polished and fun, knowing your biggest disappointment about the game is it's not long enough is indeed an important issue. 

Good news though: ROM was never intended to be one level and that issue is already being actively addressed. 

For us, this initial release of ROM was just the beginning. We're dedicated to delivering polished content to players (including things like free maps and weapon updates) over the coming months. We're also looking into getting the community involved in helping us to create content and being as reactive to feedback as possible. 

Our first additional content drop is going to come sooner than you'd expect but I can't share all the details just yet! :D

We hope that players get a true mastery of the game right now so when our new maps and weapons drop, and when multi-player competitiveness takes hold, ROM can truly be an experience that can be customized to as many play styles and desires as possible.

Here's the breakdown:
- You get 3 minutes to rack up a high score
- One hand has a gun and the other one [strike] is making a peace sign [/strike] throws explosive orbs
- There's a bunch of powerup modifiers (shoot to pick up) that change the orbs function: splitter, homing, et cetera
- Press the thumbpad to enter bullet time

The rounds have a really fun gameplay arc . . . once the mechanics clicked I fell into videogame ""flow state"" and the rounds were over before I knew it. (Nice convient ""replay"" button in the score screen to jump right back into the action)

It's fun for local game sessions, taking turns with friends. The spectator view is really well done!
