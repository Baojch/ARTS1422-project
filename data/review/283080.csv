-Great art. Very reminiscent of the original, and just generally has creative and cute npcs and locations.
-Voice actor is adorable, though she is pretty underutilized. I'm surprised the creator didn't use her for more narration given how he says that she was the reason the first game did so well.
-Upgrades can be satisfying to get with the change in art. New fighting moves are ok.

[h2] Negatives [/h2]
-Bosses are just not well designed. Most have a singular attack that they repeat ad nauseum. One boss just continued to use the same attack which made it invincible over and over again. They were either very cheesable or frustrating.
-Quest system is very clustered and disorganized.
-Gameplay loop just isn't good. While it worked for a shorter flash game, you just smack things until you can level up and then you smack things more. The new fighting moves are ok but very, very finnicky and can get you accidentally killed in many situations.
- Story is nonexistent. There are a few blurbs in a library at the very start, but none of the quests have interesting or even fun characters and I feel like the amount of references in the game broke the immersion.
- [b] The main reason I'm giving this a thumbs down [/b] The game takes a SEVERE dip in quality in the final stretch of the game. While I didn't experience many bugs in the first 2/3 of the game, the final area had enemies flickering in and out, teleporting, and getting constantly stuck in walls which made me had to reset the levels multiple times since you need to kill all of them to proceed. The final boss was not immune to these bugs and proceeded to teleport into the wall when I used a beast to hit it.",1700149253,1700149487,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The beastmaster route is Easy mode, while Sorcerer route is Hard mode, but this isn't made apparent at all until you've completed one and are doing the other.
The beasts are extra lives. All beasts cost the same. The beasts are generally pretty easy to obtain. The Hebi beast trivializes all the end-game areas and makes the final boss fight actually skippable (due to how you technically don't even need to enter the boss room fully to fight and kill the boss. You can fully heal yourself using the beasts by dying while riding a beast. There's also a very good grinding spot where you get the Hebi beast.

Doing the sorcerer route is, from what I can tell, impossible to do deathless with less than level 8 armor, level 6 mp, and level 5 sword. The reason for this is because you need to twice cross a bridge that has 4 very, very powerful enemies with a net that replaces your sword during a quest that lets you do the Heal spell dungeon with more ease of mind. Said net doesn't let you harm enemies so you can only take the hits, also there's no healing available until you can grind said enemies for healing items from the opposite side of the bridge, wherein they'll spawn-in as you enter the bridge, instead of spawning on-top of you, surrounding you. The dungeons seem like they want you to do them in the order of ""Jungle"", ""Volcano"", and ""Ice"", though Ice could be done earlier, considering the only real hazard of that place are the insta-death spikes, and the boss being a level-6 or level-7 MP stat check, wherein if you can't use the charge attack 8 times on the boss, you lose.
The spells, with the exception of lightning also cost the same as the beasts afaik. The lightning spell requires your entire MP bar, no matter how high leveled your Special stat is. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if it weren't for the fact that to get to one of the last areas you must use the lightning spell to cross a collapsed bridge, which means you have 0 mp to deal with a very, very tough room. Also, in the last area of the game, the enemies have decently long invulnerability periods, which are mostly ignored by Hebi's fireballs, but something that must be planned around for the sorcerer, as no spell except maybe the lightning can't let you hurt the enemies when they're in this invulnerability state.

Also not being able to do a NG+ of any kind, or something similar after beating the game via one route means that you can only delete the save and start a new game to do the other route, which is somewhat meh, in my opinion, as it is a bit of a grind getting all stats to level 10 unless you're in the final area of the game.

Finally, not getting a different post-credit cutscene it you beat the game as Sorcerer is also a bit of a downer, as it would be a nice little ""you did it :)"" thing to the player, even if it were to be just a slight change, like having the sorcerer crown be somewhere in the room somewhere.

Still, had fun with this short little game, even if it frustrated me at times (accursed ice physics jank and insta-death spikes are not a fun combo).",1657390812,1657390812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Super Chibi Knight is a full version of a Flash game by the same name. You play as a young indeterminate gender knight as he/she sets out from home to help out fellow townspeople.

Gameplay is more or less a clone of Zelda 2, where you have an overhead map screen to navigate to areas, and a side view platformer view to deal with combat, towns, and other areas of interest. Combat is nice and fluid, though I highly recommend a gamepad as some movements can be rather technical. As you whack monsters, they drop experience, and on occasion, you may find random xp bags out in the wild. Once you obtain enough XP to gain a level, a prompt opens up and you can choose to upgrade the stat you just reached, or you can choose to wait and gain more XP in order to increase a stat that requires more XP.

Level gains in this game are super important. Early on it is very easy to get two or three shotted, especially by certain creatures, and grinding out a better sword and armor will greatly reduce the amount of time you spend fighting them. Thankfully the grind isn't super long, as you can get into and out of combat pretty fast overall.

This game plays up to being a platformer a number of times. In particular, I had to run certain ice levels multiple times because of all the slipperiness and death spikes. The boss fights in this game are one of the stronger points. They can be rather challenging, but usually a few tries is enough to do them in as you learn their attack patterns which are usually simple. For a one man programmer, I can tell a lot of work went into the game, and it shows.

The art is good, but in using vector graphics, the game performance can sometimes stutter, even on middle tier systems. If the game is constantly stuttering, you may need to remove other inputs from your machine. In my case, I had to disconnect my USB keyboard entirely, as merely turning it off did not suffice. The music is good, having an orchestral quality to it, though it tends to be on short loops and may drive you mad if you listen to it for too long. While the controls are responsive, using double tap to dash, especially with such an abysmal jump, is weirdly frustrating to pull off. Thankfully you can keybind dashes, which makes things a lot easier. I did not encounter any crashes or bugs during my playthrough, so that's always good.

I rate Super Chibi Knight a C+. It's a very good attempt to replicate the Zelda 2 formula and improve upon it. But the game is quite short, and I think it's a little on the hard side for its target audience. I wouldn't mind seeing a more casual difficulty, but I understand the era that we're in where indie games don't pull punches.",1614115365,1614115365,True,1,0,0.515418469905853271,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Ancient legends speak about a hero rising up from common folk to fight against it. Can all of it be true? Well, only one way to know for sure. Take a hold of your sword, choose your path and begin your adventure!

So, as the name suggests you are playing as a Chibi knight, which is pretty adorable to be honest. You are a cute little ball wrapped up in an armor! As you level up, your armor and sword change their appearance. You can even lock your outfit to your liking - you will level up normally, but won't change the look which is neat but I have enjoyed seeing my progress. ;)
Gameplay wise it's a hack and slash with platformer sequences, I would say. You have basic and special attacks, you can also learn some skills like dash, double jump… Little twist comes with a special attack - when you are Beastmaster you can command beasts, when you become Sorcerer you can select from four spells. Your route is decided after the Prologue. Game warns you about progressing forward, that you won't be able to come back. So it's best to complete all of the quests in your home village before moving out.
The game is short, it has great pace and you will hardly get stuck. This is great actually as you can't get all of the achievements in one playthrough. Some of them are rather hard (without dying, without some skills…), should the game be longer it would get really frustrating, like this it was great fun! Two routes also offer nice replayability, with different characters, quests, enemies in the middle part of the game. Truth is that the end part is the same but different skills offer different kinds of experience. Some of the fights can be challenging, for a boss fight you have to come up with tactics not just rush them over. Luckily there is no penalty for dying so you can try as many times as you need (except when aiming for the one particular achievement).

The graphics are very cute and the music is good, fitting the game very well. The game was apparently made by father & daughter duo (she even voiced Chibi Knight) and it has a great feeling. It's filled with jokes and references on popular culture, we had some good laughs. If you will take for what it is - cute short funny game, filled with action, you will for sure enjoy it.

A franquia possui um estilo de ação semelhante ao ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"" do NES, sendo que Super Chibi Knight foi financiado pelo Kickstarter e seus desenvolvedores são Nick Pesto e sua pequena filha Bella. Abaixo seguem algumas observações:

PROS:
- O jogo consegue agradar quem pegou o auge dos jogos em flash;
- A história possui 2 rotas diferentes. Pela rota montanhas, a protagonista transforma-se numa domadora de feras ou torna-se feiticeira pela rota ilhas;
- Graficamente é charmoso, intencionalmente ou não, parece uma versão remasterização de um jogo flash;
- Trilha sonora é muito boa;

CONS:
- Auto-save;
- Os skills da feiticeira/domadora poderiam ter sido melhores aproveitados porque quase não existe necessidade de utiliza-los;
- Todos os inimigos, sem exceção nenhuma (incluindo todos os chefes), são incrivelmente fáceis;
- Particularmente, eu reformularia tudo envolvendo monstros voadores, eles não respeitam as limitações do cenário podendo atravessar paredes/chão e outros permanecem por longos períodos numa altura inacessível;
- Skill anti-aéreo (que também serve como pulo duplo) é inútil em termos ofensivos porque o personagem deixa de atacar no momento que o golpe atinge a altura limite, portanto torna-se vulnerável inviabilizando a utilização dele para atacar monstros voadores ;

Veredito
Apesar de ter gostado da experiência, é inegável que ele carrega a simplicidade dos flash consigo, portanto o maior defeito de Super Chibi Knight é ter ""cara"" de jogo do ArmorGames, mas pelo preço compensa.",1607588593,1607588593,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Combat is very smooth and controls aren't clunky at all. The game sends you on two different paths, if you take one, the other is closed. You either decide to be a sorcerer or beastmaster. Each path (class) has its own unique storyline with different bosses and enemies. You start as weak but as you unlock more spells or tame more beasts you become very powerful and defeat enemies easily. Game is pretty short.

The game has a few issues though. Beastmaster storyline is very short compared to sorcerer, and after taming the best beasts the game is almost finished, so you don't get the chance to enjoy your powerful beasts to beat a lot of things. Also, the block feature the game provides is almost useless, as it almost never works on any boss or sometimes even simple trash mobs. But it isn't needed as avoiding damage in the game is more designed around jumping above enemies, dashing backwards, climbing platforms and such. And stun-locking trash mobs by mashing attack button. 

The game shines most brightly with its really fun boss fights. It is pretty easy, sometimes you might have to end up trying to figure out how to avoid certain attacks but that wouldn't take a lot of time either. There are no difficulty settings, so after finishing the game with both classes there is no reason to play again. But the price is pretty cheap, so if you enjoy action platformers I highly recommend playing this game.",1583276734,1583278479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

操作上比较简单，包含攻击、跳跃、冲刺以及后期的技能释放，其中快速攻击可以打出比较爽快的连击，能把一些小怪打出硬直浮空
游戏内的杀怪可以获得经验，并在三个属性（攻击、防御、特殊技能）上进行强化，随着属性提升后消耗的经验点数也更多
但是三个属性上限都是10级，说高不高，说低不低，大概操作比较菜的话，最终BOSS前肯定能升满的

游戏地图是由一个个小副本关卡组成的，你可以在大地图上移动，并进入不同的小副本场景中
初期小副本可能只有一张地图，离开后即可回到大地图，中期开始出现多张地图连接的中、大型副本
甚至还有一些小的解密玩法，需要通过NPC对话或者某些场景提示获得过关方法

游戏总体难度不算太低，主要是因为主角非常非常脆，大多数的时候你只能被同级怪物碰3、4下
虽然死亡并没有什么惩罚，而且死亡时的经验也都是能够保留的，只是你却还是要重新开始这关，有些比较复杂的副本还是挺难受的
初期你可以靠升级强化属性来获得对低级怪物的碾压来降低难度，但到最后期，尤其是习得所有技能返回自己王国挑战最终魔王时，那些小怪仍然是3、4下就能打死你，而你却要砍他门几十下才能打死，也无法再次变强了，只能通过操作来完成这些关卡（或者拼RP靠怪物掉落的血瓶蓝瓶来反败为胜），虽然可以放技能回血、加放加攻，但你的魔法确实非常宝贵的
除此之外在，这游戏还有一大问题：有时候会有非常严重的掉帧现象，完全不是机器性能不够造成的问题，感觉可能就是游戏本身优化不足导致的
但作为一款仅仅由父女两人、而且女儿还只有8岁，完成的独立游戏来说，这已经非常不容易了",1561997245,1561997245,True,12,0,0.648467361927032471,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Si tout commence de la plus simple des manières, avec de l'exploration, de la prise de quêtes et quelques petits combats pour pexer, l'on va rapidement rencontrer des boss de plus en plus difficiles à battre, le tout couplé à des problèmes de jouabilité et de game design. Retour sur une expérience autant sympathique que douloureuse, une épopée entre amour et haine.[/i]

Assez convenu, le scénario du jeu introduit un chevalier (qui n'est pas moins qu'une petite fille dissimulée sous son armure) dont la mission est de ramener la paix et la sérénité au royaume d'Oukoku en mettant fin aux agissements du maléfique Général Tso. Notre aventure commence donc dans le-dit royaume avec un game design calqué sur un style introduit par Zelda II en 1987, à savoir une vue subjective par laquelle on se baladera dans le monde et une vue sur un plan latéral en 2D lorsque l'on entre dans les zones. 

C'est d'emblée très plaisant. Les zones sont illustrées avec soin dans un style cartoonesque coloré et réussi qui n'est pas dénué d'humour. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840027719 Les environnements sont variés puisqu'ils mêlent aussi bien forêts, grottes et volcans que vaisseau alien ou tour infernale. On a quand même affaire à un jeu développé par une fille de 8 ans et son père, celui-ci ayant mis en scène sa petite fille blonde sous les traits du chibi knight alors que cette dernière a travaillé aux doublages. Le capital sympathie du jeu n'en est que renforcé. 

Aussi, les quêtes sont diversifiées même si elles ne sont pas originales, il faut l'admettre. Il faudra par exemple chercher dix lucioles pour un PNJ, créer une potion pour un autre, en aider un troisième en détruisant un rocher, etc... Tout cela étant mis en place afin de créer une progression sur le plan de l'histoire ainsi que sur le plan de nos compétences puisque le jeu comporte quelques éléments de RPG. Bon, pas grand chose en fait. Trois stats seulement, à savoir l'armure, l'épée et le mana. À force d'aider les PNJ, de compléter des quêtes et de combattre des boss, on monte rapidement en XP non sans ressentir de la lassitude face aux combats qui se résument à quelques mouvements basiques obtenus auprès de cinq personnages (certains peuvent d'ailleurs être manqués définitivement puisque les compétences qu'ils octroient ne sont pas toutes nécessaires à la complétion de la quête principale). Attaque combo, dash au sol ou dash aérien ainsi qu'un sort de boule de feu, c'est à peu près tout pour la première partie du jeu.

Par la suite on aura accès soit au monde de la magie ""Mahou Island"", soit au monde des dresseurs ""Yajuu Montains"". Je dis bien ""soit"" car le jeu offre deux voies différentes qui permettent de faire varier le gameplay et de terminer le jeu d'une autre manière. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840027187 Dommage cependant pour un jeu aussi court de ne pas avoir mieux exploité la durée de vie d'une partie au lieu de forcer le joueur à recommencer pour essayer l'autre monde. Au final, si on ne veut pas passer à côté d'un tiers du jeu on va devoir refaire toute la première zone pour changer de choix par la suite. À ce moment là on pourra soit obtenir des montures très puissantes soit des sorts. Autant dire d'emblée qu'il est bien plus facile de terminer le jeu avec un chibi dresseur puisqu'en plus de la barre de vie de la bête on n'aura que peu de mana à dépenser pour l'invoquer. Il sera donc possible de faire un combat en usant de quatre pets différents alors que le magicien, lui, et bien qu'il aura un sort de healing, sera beaucoup plus en galère à cause du manque de mana et de son unique barre de vie.

Le défaut majeur du titre réside dans le fait qu'il a été développé avec une technologie Flash. Ça risque donc de laguer même avec un bon PC et pour ma part, le fait d'être lockée à 40 FPS avec parfois quelques accrochages compliquait la réalisation d'actions précises. Aussi, les commandes ne répondent pas au quart de tour, on va donc avoir tendance à appuyer deux fois sur les touches et donc à provoquer des actions non désirées (dans le genre dasher sur des piques, pas très réjouissant).

Ce n'est pas tout puisque quelques erreurs de level design vont venir faire rager le joueur, en voici une pelletée : checkpoint après et non avant un boss, ce qui oblige à se retaper quatre écrans de mobs ; arène trop étroite qui fait sortir le personnage de l'écran lors d'une esquive et réinitialise la barre de vie du boss ; boss aérien alors que le knight n'a pas d'attaque aérienne (cela oblige à dasher vers le haut près de l'ennemi mouvant pour le blesser, le jeu n'est clairement pas adapté à ce type de combat) ; spawn de monstres autour du knight sans qu'il ne puisse les esquiver...etc. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840032724 Et j'ajoute aussi que l'introduction d'une énigme ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840027642]une carte sur laquelle le joueur doit trouver un code à trois chiffres[/url]) se résolvant sans aucune logique de décodage mais grâce à une extrapolation mathématique inattendue et dénuée de bon sens reste un choix mal avisé. 

Pour revenir sur un bon point avant de conclure, la musique est vraiment géniale. Chaque zone possède son thème adapté et entrainant ce qui offre un réel plaisir d'exploration. Le revers de la médaille est que les zones sont petites et qu'ainsi la musique va recommencer à chaque fois qu'on entre dans un lieu. Outre le fait que cela devient énervant, surtout lors de la visite d'un village, il reste qu'on ne peut pas profiter de la bande-son en dehors de la zone en vue subjective ou des combats de boss.

Au final, Super Chibi Knight est un petit RPG imparfait qui reste appréciable de par un travail artistique soigné autant sur le plan visuel que sonore. Le jeu reste cependant difficile sur certains boss et cela avant tout parce qu'il nous handicape avec ses lags et ses erreurs de game design. Vous comprenez maintenant mon avis mitigé, c'est un jeu qu'on ne peut pas détester mais de là à en chanter les louanges la route reste longue.

If you like the flash it is a sequel to I'd recommend it for sure, but I am not sure how it would hold up otherwise. The whole time I was playing the game I felt like I had missed something though, like I missed some dialogue or tutorial etc. The special box showed a big red X for the whole game and I'm not sure why and I am not sure if it was supposed to or if I missed something. The game is also pretty glitchy. For a specific example, if you look up or down before using a teleporter, when you get to the other end it will spawn you in the incorrect location because it spawns based on the screen position, which is not constant since you can adjust the view. This can get you trapped to the point where you have to exit the game and reload your save. Also the game isn't very good at warning you went you are doing someone irreversable. 

MINOR(?) SPOILERS:
When I delivered the phoenix eggs I didn't realize that I wouldn't be able to go back, and likewise when I left the mountain area I hadn't realized I wouldn't be able to go back yet again. I thought I'd be able to go to Oukuko and then back so that I would be taken to the start instead of having to back track all the way back to the monk. Well because of that I ended up being permanently unable to finish a quest on that save file. Also this game has a pet peeve of mine in games. When you go to reload your file after beating the game you are unable to continue play, level up, retrieve missed items, or finish incomplete quests. I never got to use the boat because I had planned to do it after delivering the phoenix eggs (since that was technically a quest) but then I was never able to go back. Also after getting Hebi there is no point in using anything else, which kind of sucked since you spend the whole game leveling up sword and armor only for those to both become useless by the additional health and massive power of Hebi. Using Hebi felt more like cheating or sequence-breaking than the correct way to play (but then sword did like no damage at that point). However I will admit from looking at the achievements I didn't get and a couple community forum posts, it looks like there is a lot of content I missed and there may be enough variety to warrant another playthough. Maybe it just went over my head and taking the boat gives you an alternate Chapter 2 or something.

MAJOR SPOILERS:
I did feel cheated that there wasn't a real General Tso battle, but just a world map battle (""and now for something completely different"") with Monocio and then a stupid easy curbstomp battle against his heart in the 2D sidescrolling format of the rest of the battle (the battle was a curbstomp because of Hebi being too powerful). Another complaint is that you can ""cheese"" most of the bosses. If you wait for Monocio to do the hand/shield attack if you are ready for him and attacking when he drops the shield the narrow area he goes to for that attack will trap him and you can get about 3/4 of a health bar down. Then back off for his next attack and move in again before he gets unstuck and you've basically already beaten him. Also if you die on the world map your mana is not regenerated due to I assume a programming oversight due to the nonstandard game over you get from that, so if you have none going into the fight when you get to the heart fight you are screwed (since I'm pretty sure you need Hebi to get over a jump, that or it is a very precise jump, but I really could never make it and there wasn't a double jump). So what you have to do is die in the heart fight so that the mana will refill and then go back and beat the world map fight and then you can actually do the heart fight. Maybe quitting and reloading would fix it as well but I think I tried and it didn't work. Either way it kinda sucks that you can make the final boss (almost) unwinnable by mistake But anyway I haven't invested much time in the game, and it sounds like there might be an alternate version of the final fight and of chapter 2 from the achievements? I don't know. I'm just calling it how I see it.

[h1]Positive:[/h1]
- Simple controls
- Nice visuals
- Different storylines depending on a choice you make

[h1]Negative:[/h1]
- Frame-rate drops
- Music is not particularly interesting
- It is not always clear what you have to do, making it somewhat frustrating to play
- Enemies sometimes behave in a strange way, making it awkward, difficult and sometimes impossible to hit them
- Very strange difficulty curve (final boss is arguably the easiest boss)
- Taming beasts is very over powered
- Some jumps are very precise to the point that it's annoying
- Health and mana is not well thought out - it can be very difficult to recover HP or MP, so it's often easier to just die
- No real punishment for death (besides going back to check point). Easily exploitable for HP/MP
- Easy to dash by accident - causing you to fall into instant death spikes
- Block is quite useless after the early game
- Extremely poor game design for one segment: literally could not proceed because my ""special"" level was too low. I did not have the mana pool to continue and since MP does not regenerate in this game, I had to back track and grind to increase my special level.
- No new game plus. Basically your save becomes useless once you beat the game as it will spawn you at the final boss.

More importantly though it's an homage to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link from the NES days of yore... 

I think Zelda II is highly under rated and one of the most challenging and fun Zelda games in the franchise... I'd even go as far to say as I enjoy playing it more than Ocarina of Time just because of it's simplicity but for some reason Super Chibi Knight just misses the mark in a lot of ways.

The art style isn't my cup of tea, it's a bit sloppy and childish looking but I guess that's the theme, I just wanted to try it for the RPG / Action elements but the problem with that is, the game mechanics are really bad. Hit boxes are very sensitive in this game and your characters reach animation is abysmal. You literally have to be micro pixels away from enemies in order to damage them. The sensitive hit boxes is a huge issue right from the beginning, but with some over leveling you can persevere and get through the first chapter. This however becomes a huge issue later in the game, even after you're maxed out, the enemies can kill you in only 4 or 5 hits and their range is far superior to yours.

There are two paths through the game, Beastmaster and Sorcerer... but it's more like sword spell... The Beastmaster side of things reminds me more of Adventure Island II and is the easier path to take through the game. The Sorcerer side (Sword Spell) is much more reminiscent of Zelda II... which is funny because that path takes place on an Island... go figure.

A word of warning, there are many missable achievements in this game, a lot of which are convoluted and cryptic and there are two points of no return which you are warned about before you proceed. If you don't happen to get things done in a specific chapter, then you'll have to start a new game from the beginning and try again. From what I can remember, Zelda II allowed you to backtrack to every area in the game so if you happened to over look something, you could always go back... this game doesn't allow for this... it's just lazy and sloppy game design in my books.

I bought it for 2 bucks and some change, so I'd say, yeah go for it... but for an 11 dollar price tag, it's not really worth the price. There IS a lot of replay value here if you can stomach the grind, but to beat the game skipping certain spells / abilities and not losing a single life is a bit too much in my books... It will call for heavy levels of aspergers and OCD... as well as not having a life... as the achievement states.

I appreciate the effort to re-create the magic that was Zelda II but Zelda II, it's not... 5 / 10. Needs a lot of fine tuning for the battle mechanics if it's going to stand up to a game as legendary and tight as Zelda.

If you´re feeling lazy to read all the review you can just go to the conclusion and read a summary.

[h1] Characters [/h1]

We play with a female character with armor and a sword.
As we level up our armor and sword will improve.
The character can also learn new moves when we finish certain missions.

[h1]History [/h1]

The game tells the story of the evil General Tso that controls the kingdom of Oukoku, our character parts to defeat him.
We travel through the world accepting missions of other characters while we level up.

[h1]Gameplay [/h1]

The character uses two main weapons, sword and magic that will automatically improve as we level up.
Our character moves in an open world in which creatures roam and when we touch them we are transported to an area in which we fight against them.
We have a mini-map that indicates the location of our missions.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]

The game has graphics chibi type (as the title indicates), chibi menas that everything has small, laughing and caricatured forms.

[H1] Audio [/h1]

Here you can check the OST and get an idea

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I recommend the game it´s fun but in my opinion quite difficult.

My rating for this game is an [b]8 out of 10[/b]

The controls are somewhat rare for pc but it has compatibility with the controller.

One of the only issues with the game i had is i soft locked the game during a fight. I killed a boss so fast that the health bar was depleted and I had to reset the room and fight the boss over again - which was a little annoying.

The other only issue is that the achievments are really broken. I did one of the 2 paths you can take in the game (which is why replayability is a must). There's achievments you'd have to get considering you can't complete the area without doing them, but they didn't unlock.

Super Chibi Knight is your typical armor games, newgrounds, kongregate flash game, just upgraded to a full scale game on steam. It can probably be beaten in an hour if you're quick, good, and speed running. Otherwisde it's a 2-3 hour run per playthrough. Considering it has 2 paths you can take for the story, and it's replayability you're paying $9.99 for about 6-8 hours of gameplay. There's some secrets you could probably look up, but they're decently hidden and it requires at least 2 playthroughs to get all the achievments... More if they never fix the achievment bug. And I mean in-game stats, not even steam achievments.

It's a decent game. It doesn't tell you exactly where to go or what to do. A lot of people may find this frustrating, but inbstead of just screaming ""what do I do now"" or looking up the solution, give it a think or explore. It's basically just linear puzzle solving, and  very minimal backtracking. If you're stuck, its a problem on your end (unless of course the game soft locks and you cant beat a boss without resetting).

I'd personally give it an 8/10 on some reduntant scaling system. With my short attention span one playthrough was enough, so if it's not worth the price to me, its simply because I didn't play the game twice, or go out of myway to find everything. And the achievment bugs relating to a story I completed is just infuriating, knowing I won't be going back to complete it. Whatever system triggers the achievments is clearly broken by the same mechanic that prevented me from killing a boss with no health bar. Again, this is very minor and just a personal dissatisfaction. Your results may vary, and it may be you even have a much happier experience!

Really reminds me i should play more of them. Honestly, i have no words to describe how much you should really play this game. It is just so good and it'll hook you until the end. And even then, i might challenge myself and go for some of those achievements! The difficulty curve to this game i think is somewhat a little sudden but even then it's simply because the bosses play the same as bosses in 2d games. Each one has a pattern, some are hard to see, some are obvious, and some of the patterns require you to have very good precise timing. You might have a couple of rage moments but it personally made me all the more want to beat the challenge. A couple of bosses i even threw my arms in the air in triumph. 

Now...for my 2 nitpicks. The final boss felt a little....er, underwhelming to me? Especially if you have completely several side quests. I wasn't expecting most of the fight to be out on the map. And even then, once you go to the second phase it doesn't feel as challenging than some of the more complex bosses like the Salt guardian, the ivan dragon, or even the panda witch. Maybe some others found it more difficult, whos to say? Thats just what i felt about it and i felt a little disappointed about it.

This is just a small one but on mahou island where you go to that area to aquire the double jump, what is the point of that small little room that is underwater? Is there a secret? Because i felt a little annoyed to see nothing there other than some blocks you can destroy which don't give you anything. I get very ticked a little when i see a developer design an area with no purpose unless it's an easter egg. Could be something you forgot. Who knows!

Music was good in some areas however it didn't click for me a couple of times. I know alot of people loved it which whos the judge? When it comes to music it's all about tastes. 

Ok blegh blegh enough negativity. I had such a great time with this game and it makes me wish for more! I love some of the mini referances you had and pleaaaase for the love of everything, HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER VOICE MORE. I find that so cute and creative that you had her do all the voice acting. I bet she had a great time recording too. 

Anyway, i made this too long because i just had to express my love for this. keep making games bro!

Oh, but they put in a very accessable way to remap buttons. Ok, cool, I remap them... oh wait, it doesn't save the remapped controls. I have to remap the entire controller every time I start the game. Huh...

Ok, now I've remapped the controls... oh wait, when I'm playing, it seems that rapidly hitting the direction buttons (like, say, when you're trying to maneuver to fight the sandworm) can lead to them getting locked on or off...

The only other concern... the ""block"" button is down... which is also ""zoom the camera."" Annoying. There's 4 thumb buttons on most controllers, and 3 actions assigned to buttons... why not put defend on the 4th?

It feels very much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and I don't care what nonsense you've been told about that game, because this is a good thing.

There are enemies on the overworld map that cause fights when you bump into them, just like Zelda II.

You gain experience when smashing said enemies in their stupid cute faces, just like Zelda II.

You then use the experience to increase Attack, Defense, or Special, JUST LIKE ZELDA II.

A lot of enemies may look different, but mirror attack patterns and behavior of enemies in Crystalis. 

Wait, I mean Zelda II.

What I'm trying to say here is that if you enjoyed Zelda II (and you do if you aren't a huge idiot) then you will enjoy Super Chibi Knight. It's worth noting that this game is faster paced than Zelda II, and has more quests / charm / voice acting / daughters involved in the development.

Still on the fence? Go google the original Chibi Knight, which is a free flash game, and try that out first. Or, you know, go play Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It's really good, I promise. Don't listen to the people who talk bad about it; they are just bad at video games.

Is it perfect? Not at all. 

It seems to run rather poorly in full screen, and could probably be optimized a bit better in that regard. 

The art is well done, but you can see some lines in the walls that give away the tiles.

You can get stuck in situations that end with you taking unavoidable hits sometimes. Panda Witch boss, I'm looking at you.

Using double tap to dash is really awkward while trying to do this in mid-air, because you have no forward momentum to your jumps. What I mean is, when you let go of the direction you are moving to initiate the double tap, you end up falling short a lot of the time because you had to stop moving to do the dash. You can also dash with the trigger buttons, but you won't know this unless you experiment on your own or go looking in the keybinds. 

...Sometimes it feels like maybe they copied *too* much from Zelda II. 

Still, this is a fun game. It's worth ten dollars, especially if you plan to play through it more than once (there is a choice moment that might make you want to go back through a second time). You also get to support some really neat people with your purchase, and feel all fuzzy about that.",1436324844,1436343970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So of course, when this came out, I picked it up and gave it a play. The first chapter of the game is solid and fun and harkens back to the flash game, although the pit was a tad difficult, but only due to playing with a controller, but I'll get to that later. Once I unlocked the second chapter, which it turns out was before I finished the first chapter, I found myself locked out from the first chapter. I had a mission that I had not completed from the first chapter, and when I finally unlocked a way to go back from the second chapter, which again was before I was completely finished with that chapter, I headed back to chapter one. Upon my return, the entire first chapter was changed, and I was forced into a boss battle I was not prepared for. After many deaths, I finally beat the boss and was pushed forward into the volcano area, only to feel underpowered and easily killed. Did you know its possible to get there with naught but a sword, armor, the lightning spell and the fire sword spell? I found that out the hard way. Of course, my second playthrough will go differently, and I will play through it again, leaving my current character to die there. I cannot progress. My armor and sword are maxed out, and I just keep dying. 

Part of the constant deaths seems to be the fact that the game is absolutely terrible to control on a controller, even though it allows support for controllers. Double-tapping a direction on the keyboard is easy and fast, but its diffcult on a controller, and dashing is required in many points of the end of the game.

This game has a lot of flaws, and believe me I understand the love for it. But my god is it frustrating to play if you don't do things perfectly correctly.",1435444190,1435444190,False,18,1,0.549024224281311035,3,True,False,False,False,,,

This was also posted without being able to get mounts, which likely would have assisted in the game, but the reason for this is explained further down.

    As someone who has played the first Chibi Knight multiple times through, this game was a disappointment in quite a few aspects. The issue for the game is in its game play along with some other technical issues.
It frequently crashed along with a variety of glitches that would interfere with game play. I would constantly encounter a glitch in which holding the down arrow to block would also move the camera down a good bit, and it would never return to its original position unless I died, or relaunched the game. Enemies would also glitch into floors and other objects making them unreachable, locking me into the area forcing me to relaunch if I were unable to leave the room and come back, even then sometimes the enemy would still be stuck. I've spent at least an hour just messing around seeing if I could fix the game and relaunching.

    Battle mechanics felt clunky the whole game. Controls were unresponsive in dire situations and enemy attacks were absolutely infuriating. A great example of this would be the ""Panda Witch"" fight. This fight would start off with the Panda in the battle roaring, blasting you a good distance. The Panda would then roll at the player, and with experimentation, considering the game provides almost no guidance what so ever, the player would find out that they were to hit the Panda, causing it to bounce around the room. The witch, flying near the roof of the room, would be hit by this Panda EVENTUALLY (spending 2 minutes dashing under a panda with broken hit boxes is not fun at all). After the panda would hit the Witch out of the air, the Witch would fall to the ground, becoming helpless for a certain amount of time, letting the player wail on the Witch for damage. The Witch would recover and fly back into the air after the player deals a certain amount damage. The Panda would repeat its action, but the Witch would start blasting green orbs that home into the player that dissipate when they hit you, or after a few seconds. These move at a decent speed that the player could dodge with enough focus and skill. However, the problem with this phase is that the Witch would shoot out multiple orbs in quick succession, after the first orb is fire, about a second or less later the second one would be fired, making it almost impossible to dodge them. It is extremely difficult to jump over the first without getting hit, or sliding under it. The ""easiest"" way to dodge them is to run to the other side of the room before, or while she fires the first orb. However, you would then half to likely deal with the panda bouncing around the room, the chance to dodge this is highly unlikely. This has the possibility to have the Panda not hitting the witch out of the air once more. If the Panda cannot hit the Witch within a few bounces, the bubbles are likely to hit you, or the Panda will. This fight also has a third phase just like the second. This fight can most likely go on as long as it wants. Oh yea, blocking is completely useless in this fight. Almost like every other boss fight.

    The last boss fight had a clever aspect to it. The more people you helped throughout the game would assist you in damaging the final boss, knocking its three health bars down. However, lets say that you helped the least amount of people possible, you'd be forced to have a tedious boss fight of swinging a shovel around at tentacles/giant eye, the target was unclear. Although its generally in your best interest to help others. I on the other hand, moved to the next island before being able to ""Free the Phoenix,"" collect some bugs for a poor soul, and never got the chance to ride a mob that was a huge new intro to the game. You are UNABLE to go back to the island until you complete everything you need to do on the second island, and when you come back to the original island, you are UNABLE to complete those quests and experience a large aspect of the game.

    I had way too many peeves and bad experiences in this game. 
Bosses took experimentation, thus you would have to die multiple times,
Bugs and glitches along with crashing often, 
The blocking mechanic which wasn't needed often,
The lack of guidance that caused A LOT of random roaming around for a good 10+ minutes that was uneventful,
The extremely annoying boss fights that were tedious and not fun at all, I spent over 30 minutes on the ""Panda Witch"" boss fight described above,
The constant backtracking to healing and mana regeneration points,
The inability to backtrack certain aspects,
Some enemies are just plain annoying to fight, along with some levels that seem to be made to annoy the player (looking over at the ice castle that freezes you if you don't move)
Situations that are plain stupid, such as the hole in the beginning of the game, if you get hit by a slime ball, you get stuck and try to force your way unstuck, next thing you know you get hit by ANOTHER and ANOTHER, I think you know where this is going,
Platforming was an absolute pain the the ass, especially when you include platforming with water, considering that if you stay in water for more than 2 seconds you instantly die.
Over all, I did not have a very enjoyable time at all.",1435368449,1435368449,False,9,1,0.507414817810058594,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I enjoyed this game just launching it and watching it brought a smile. I completed the game in one morning. Every part of it was amazing! It was enjoyaable and it was very challenging a lot more thaan the flash game. There were some parts that were a tad rage worthy but it adds more to the game to not jus tbe a cake walk once you max out everything! I would highly reccomend this game without a doubt. It is worth it at full price. However I am confused at certain parts with some secrets I collected but didn't know what to do with them. This game however seems to have had many optionals which you did not have to do but I'm, sure it helps out a lot later! 

The main cons I'd say are a bit of lag issues, the game lags a lot even though it isn't that heavy on my pc. Another would be the sharp sound collecting xp makes it hurt quite a lot. Then there is the achievments I did not collect a single one even though I completed them. I hope that can be fixed because I do plan to do another playthrough for completion purposes.

First if you dont pick up the quest and just start killing you will not be able to move on. i would love if there was something that would point out quest location as to not be able to miss any. 2nd idea i would like that if you do not pick up quest game  doesnt allow person to enter location with out said quest or just let them turn in quest as soon as they talk with that quest giver.

i dont like at mountian town there quest do not go into your quest log.

there a few othere things im sure you are working on but like if you bring son to the alter son is gone and you cant get that upgrade and move on. with that if you walk away from him you can go back to refight him .

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=377773432

Игра представляет собой классический двухмерный RPG/Action / Платформер c изучением территорий, зачисткой ключевых локаций, выполнением квестов с прокачкой навыков за убийства мобов (каждый новый уровень мы выбираем, какой навык будем качать - броня, оружие, либо спец. удар). 
Здесь просто чудеснейшая атмосфера! Прекрасная прорисовка и дизайн окружения, монстров, героев, плавная анимация, великолепная музыка и звук и увлекательный геймплей.
И да, стоит отметить, что игра разрабатывается силами двух человек - отца и его дочери ^^

[h1]Геймплей:[/h1]
В игре довольно простое управление - прыжок, удар, движение в стороны и различные комбо открываемые по мере прохождения сюжета, комбинируемые из этих составляющих (к слову, даже первое комбо из трех ударов отнимает достаточное HP у врагов и способно высекать художественные скульптуры из кусков камней). 
Возможность оседлать различных животных ^__^

[h1]Графика:[/h1]
А вот здесь нужно отдать должное: картинка, дизайн и вообще вся игра в целом получается изумительной!  На официальном канале есть видео, где показан двухчасовой процесс рисования одной из игровых локаций http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQuFT28_VN0  (думаю, может быть интересно некоторым CG-художникам).
Всё выглядит довольно оригинально, сочная, приятная глазу картинка. Атмосфера происходящего - будто попал в детский мультфильм!

[h1]Звук и музыка:[/h1] 
Что касается музыки, здесь довольно типичная для инди-рпг - забавная, но, не более.
За голоса и различные звуковые эффекты в игре - отвечает дочь разработчика) 
Рекомендую посмотреть видео с процессом записи материала для игры!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ5fVGXcV7U


[h1]Итого:[/h1]
Шикарнейший проект, который меня покорил! Необыкновенная атмосфера, чудесная графика и дизайн / прекрасный геймплей и хороший звук - игра заметно отличается от своих ""конкурентов"". Настоятельно рекомендую посмотреть трейлер.

Личная оценка: 8/10.

The leveling system is very unique. There are three separate levels: Amor, Special, and Sword. You spend experience on each of these independently. Experience requirements will only increase for the skill you're leveling. This discourages min-maxxing, and makes it easier to level all of your skills without spending massive amounts of XP.

Super Chibi Knight is not a tough-as-nails Super Meat Boy clone. It's easy enough for young players or players who are new to gaming to pick up the controller and jump right into the game. But it's also varied enough for older players to enjoy it as well.

Before I started, I thought that this was just going to be a remake of the original, but the introduction of The Beastmasters adds a whole new level to the game. It's fun to run around as a tiny knight in armor. It's even more fun to ride atop a giant purple beast which breathes fire, a large bison which charges at enemies, or a chicken which can glide.

At the time of writing, the game isn't done yet. It took me 3.5 hours to get to the end of the Alpha version, and I expect a lot more content to be added to the game over time. The developer is actively taking feedback and constantly adding things to the game. This is one of the few ""Early Access"" games which I actually expect to be finished.

If you're still on the fence about this game, check out the original Chibi Knight which was created by the same developer. Many of the game mechanics are the same, but Super Chibi Knight feels a lot more polished and varied than its predecessor, and we haven't even seen its final version.

More content will be added. I am rating it based off of the part already released, which is about 2 hours of gameplay.

This is a fun game with a small protagonist who has to defeat an evil in which many have failed to defeat before. The playable part of the game includes the town in which you live and the beast trail. The town includes different quests with dungeons and bosses. After the town, you are taken to a beast trail where you learn how to tame the different beasts and use them in battle. There are multiple quests that are different difficulties, and some you won't be strong enough to beat. If you get stuck on one quest, move onto another one. There are enemies scattered across the map, which also help with leveling up. 

I recommend this game because of the cool art style. I also like this game because it is very simple, and you don't have to worry about a bunch of different abilities. I also like the beasts because they are easy to get used to and are very helpful. There are a few bugs in this game such as not being able to quit the game properly, but these will likely be fixed quickly since it is only in early access.",1417464795,1417464795,True,12,0,0.618170082569122314,0,False,False,True,False,,,
