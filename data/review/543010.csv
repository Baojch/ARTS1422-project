Игра отсылается к фильму - Удар по воротам (1977 года)
Фильм берет за основу опыт общения автора с настоящими игроками BHL
Где жестокая и грубая игра заслужила особое внимание в 70-ых.
В фильме так же принимали участие актуальные на тот момент хоккеисты Низшей лиги.
Суровая сатира показанная в картине не увенчалась коммерческим успехом, но со временем обросла историей и заслужила статус Культа среди поклонников хоккея и мастеров спорта. Так как дух и нравы того времени оставили неизгладимое впечатление в сердцах людей, о том, какой может быть спортивная борьба. Ведь профессиональный спорт это не просто хобби, но и работа, с той самой жестокой реальностью, каждого отдельного игрока и клуба, за выживание. Где пирог уже был поделен, и каждый стремится урвать себе крошки. Где прагматика спорта, конфликтует с элементами шоу и зрелища.

Учитывая что уже долгое время видео игры по NHL выпускаются эксклюзивно для приставок Майкрософт и Плейстейшен. Выход данной игры не только поддерживает хоккей на ПК, но и является незаурядным, нишевым проектом, который приятно порадует поклонников симов, на данную спортивную тематику.

Игра выглядит минималистично, и возможно ей не хватает оптимизации для старого железа. Но есть добротный и выдержанный стиль, атмосфера в деталях которая затягивает. Разнообразие побитых и не очень, местных городских арен... Клееный брус, болельщики, Электронный Орган, который составляет основу классического аккомпанемента. Не плохая механика самой игры. Ну и самое главное это - драки один на один или целой командой. Реализовано просто, но с неплохим масштабом.

Хоккей в который хочется возвращаться снова и снова

The 79 hours is a misnomer; the game doesn't quit when you exit, so you rack up hours without realizing it and then close via task manager (albeit the newer steam updates allow you to ""stop"" the game within Steam).

Lots of bugs, and the 'skating on carpet' reviews are right, but the controls play similar to the EA NHL series and have some decent/funny moments, especially the campaign story.  Multiplayer is fun, but it really is sluggish to play which is unfortunate.

Also, the Switch just got a 2022 release with some fixes to previous issues, but they are not porting the updates to any other versions which is a huge disappointment from the devs.

It'd be cool if these guys iterated over this, because there's so much potential here.  The soundtrack is great, there's a lot of charm and references to Slap Shot (characters, storyline, gameplay), but the on-ice product needs some work.

But then there is the genius idea that the dev decided as he knows what most boys like to do while playing hockey...

Beer Mode, Now you can play with one hand on the controller and one holding your beer.

The artstyle is an interesting choice, but the gameplay is where it is at.

Story mode may not be for everybody, but it definitely has some funny moments.

I don't regret the purchase, but it has been quite some time since the game has received attention from the developers.  As of this review the latest update appears to have been March 2017.  I am not advocating for constant attention that prevents them from working on other projects to continue to make money, because this game feels like a great first step and I would be very interested in seeing what a sequel from them would be like.  I am also aware that many of the most common suggestions are not easy to implement, but then neither was creating the game in the first place.  With all that said, there is some room for improvement.  Even after resolving many of the issues they faced at launch and making some suggested tweaks the game still feels a bit raw and unfinished, almost as though it were in a large, final Beta rather than being the finished product.  It's a good game, but it feels like it's on the cusp of being great and being so close makes me want to see it elevated to that next level.  TL;DR at end.

---Pros---
*It definitely has the feel of an older hockey game, in a lot of fun ways.  It plays a lot like the arcade-y games like NHLPA '93/NHL '94, with some outlandish big hits like in those games and NHL 2000-'01.  I don't consider this a con because it's always been meant to be an arcade hockey game, but it feels a little more simple as compared to some of the latest releases of EA NHL.  By that I mean it doesn't feel like there's wild, unpredictable physics about to happen at any moment, and for the most part you can play with a less-focused eye to detail yourself.  This makes it more fun to play as a casual gamer.  For me at least this leads to less eyestrain from playing a little while, and in turn means I can play it longer overall.

*The attention to detail in creating a game set in the  1970's is impressive.  It's more than just the blue ice.  Players have names that sound like they're straight out of the 1970's, some players have helmets but many don't, and the goalie masks are spot on.  The nets are the older style, which is perfect.  The player equipment looks and feels like something from a previous era.  The lack of advertising on the ice and boards further adds to that immersion.

*Price.  It may not play like some of the newest simulation style games but it sure doesn't cost that much either, and it's not like every year you have to shell out the same high fee to get what eventually became more of a roster update than anything.  The developers seem to understand that if you release a new version of the game every year for the same price it weakens your product.

*Fighting.  Even though it ends quickly every time, it feels fun.  It's the possibility of having multiple in a game and never really knowing when one will happen.  It's getting schoolkid excited when a second one breaks out at the same time.  It's seeing real results from them, as a guy who got his butt kicked has less health in his next fight.  It's the dirty stickwork that calls Gordie Howe to mind.  It's also really great that they don't stack the fight against you (as far as I've been able to tell) by having your worst fighter on the ice get taken on by the computer's best fighter on the ice at that moment.  The way the fights develop feels a whole lot more organic than in any offering from EA I've ever played.  It never feels forced.  You can go out of your way to get into a scrap, or you can hold onto it in the back of your mind for if you're still mad in a moment.  Sometimes it's out of your control, but it usually feels like you have a say in if your guy gets into a dust up.

*It's set in a non-real world.  That give the developers a lot more leeway to make the game the way they want.  No licensing, no royalties, no hulking corporate league they have to please to be able to publish the game.  That gives it a lot more of a labor of love feeling, and makes it feel more intimate.

--Suggestions--

*Players feel like they're all the same--it feels as though stats have no meaning.  It doesn't need as many individual attributes as some products from larger studios, just some basic shot power, shot accuracy, passing, skating, agility, balance, stamina, grit, durability, checking, and fighting ratings, with a higher number being noticeably better.  Instead of having everyone shoot equally hard and accurately, skate more or less at the same speed and turn at the same radius, and only be able to take 3 punches before being defeated in a fight, adding some nuance to the players would go a long way to making the game last longer.
-Side note: if they wanted to add an overall fighting number and then add a few sub-attributes that governed fighting and make the primary fighting attribute itself an aggregate of those sub-attributes that could make every fight different and really make that part of the game exciting.  You'd need a basic in-fight balance, in-fight strength/grapple, chin, punching power, punching speed, dodge/deflect for lessening the impact of each punch you take, in-fight stamina, and fight frequency.  You'd have to add in a minor algorithm that only permitted it to happen once or twice per season, but the occasional one-punch knockout would also keep things interesting in fighting.

*The game could be deeper.  Another common suggestion from players is to add a multi-season franchise mode.  This would not be very easy either, as player progression has been a complaint against many larger studios in their sports games with a multi-year mode, but it would make the game almost endlessly replayable.

*The game really needs a replay feature, preferably an auto-replay (that you can skip or turn off if you have time constraints in real life) with a more sandbox replay in the in-game pause menu.  It may have been omitted due to being a game that doesn't have super-precise physics or player/puck/wall boundaries but the point of the feature is to relive a great hit or goal or catch the number of the guy who just took you out so you can pay him back on his next shift.

*Arena ice size could be more varied.  In the days of the NHL to which the game hearkens, the league permitted arenas to be within a certain range to play to a strength of the team.  It would add a little extra home-ice advantage and could make for some great local co-op.

*There are a few areas that could use a wider library to draw on, primarily cutscenes and to a lesser degree commentary.

*The puck feels like it has too much friction.  It doesn't need to feel like it'll never stop on its own, but you can clear the puck out of your defensive end without risking an icing call if you're far enough back.

*An online multiplayer would also be nice, but the logistics of that would be tricky, and it would add significant overhead to the studio.  A possible alternative might be to host it on a game streaming service and have both players stream it from there.

TL;DR, I really like this game and definitely recommend it.  It's only a casual game every now and then kind of game at this point for me.  If they were to implement a multi-year mode where you can run the team and play as them and make a difference between stats it could be a game I would happily log 1,000 hours playing.  Even if there are no further updates (as it sadly appears is likely), I will keep playing it every so often because it feels very like what they were going for: a labor of love in hockey with a classic feel and a cheeky joke at every turn.

________________________________________________

Pros:
- Well written and unique story mode
- Interesting old school concept and menus
- Creative teams
- Cool and meaningful collectibles/unlockables
- Many elements that fit the old school theme perfectly (uniforms, setting, people, venues, etc)
- Objectives for each match in Story Mode adds more challenge and replayability
- Achievements

Cons:
- Can't be played without a controller
- Once you find the pattern, you can't lose a game it becomes too easy
- Can't change the buttons individually, only presets
- Very few teams, it's a very small league
- Developers don't seem to be working hard enough on the game
- Many bugs that ruin the game's experience
- Lack of multiple features that we enjoy in older hockey games
- Will feel repetitive after a couple of hours (gameplay and cutscene animations)

Pros/Cons (depending on the player):
- Dated graphics that might be good for players who like the old school feel
- The game was rebranded as Bush Hockey League
- Varied soundtrack aimed for Hockey lovers
- Violent, like every hockey game should be

Prešla si zmenou vzhľadu, veľa updatami, a celkovo ubehlo veľa času od hypu z jej vydania. S kamošmi sme sa celkom zabavili, a ani Story Mode nebol najhorší.

Blbé je, že pokiaľ nemáte aspoň priemerný počítač, táto hra sa vám bude ťažko hrať na nízkom rozlíšení, a pokiaľ sa neviete hrať so zložkami hry, je gamepad jediný spôsob hrania. Túto hru je vlastne lepšie kúpiť na konzolu, lebo tú môžete aj ťahať po svete. Pekný grafický design, arkádový návykový štýl hrania a celkom úsmevný príbeh Story módu sú plusy, ale len maličké, kozmetické. Medzi najväčšie mínusy patria veľké množstvo updatov krátko po vydaní hry, ktoré celkovo zničili jej pôvodný zámer, občasné spomalenie hry/klesanie FPS na niektorých štadiónoch, málo tímov, chýbanie zaujímavejších módov, ktoré by okorenili hru, ako napríklad výmeny hráčov, tvorba vlastného hráča/klubu, mód Sezóny, a celkovo nevyužitý potenciál, ktorý hra mala.

This was my first hockey experience on PC since NHL 09 and I can say you one thing i liked this much more. This game is a sports game that gives me a very good laugh and also is very competetive. Some people are complaining about Story mode. Personally I love it, yes it can be difficult or tricky at some points but thats the meaning of arcade. If you dont't like it at all and you can't or you're just too lazy to complete the Story mode to unlock Story mode+ which is full season mode with any team you choose and without primary objectives then there is also a cheat code which unlocks the full season mode and other extras. Sure there are some minuses like wonky controls sometimes, missing keyboard support or some other, but developers are updating it and sometimes those minuses in game are those which make it so special. Also forgot to mention that i love soundtrack and artwork in this game.

Overall: This won't be your ordinary NHL style game, dont expect to have the most realistic sports experience on PC, but this is really fun arcade sports game in which you will laugh and rage in same time and you will lose many time of your life.

Sometimes I'd have the puck on offense, but wasn't controlling the player either. The star icon wasn't on them and they skated straight and did nothing.

Even when I was controlling on offense, I'd have a teammate close by, aim to them and hit pass and instead my player would send the puck in the opposite direction right into the boards and give up the puck.

I lost 30+ faceoffs in a row and never won a single one. Maybe I just couldn't get the timing right, but there appeared to me massive input delay. I never once won a single faceoff and that is statistically impossible to lose 30 coin flips in a row.

I'd press the button to change defensemen and it rarely switched to the closest one to the puck.

I got in five fights and literally never threw one punch. Again, there are only two buttons and neither seemed to do anything. Again, this may be terrible input delay.

END EDIT

This Game wants you to take the body.

A lot of people are upset because it didn't match up with what they wanted.  Then again, this isn't a big budget title from a developer with decades of sports game experience and money for licensing.  And V7 isn't charging like it is, either.  Once you set aside your expectations, you'll find a fun little arcade hockey game that's long on atmosphere and is likely even better in local multiplayer than it already is in single.

The BHL is a fun little league.  Every logo and arena is thought out, clever, and makes me look forward to getting a sequel.  Controls reward going for the showy big plays like point-blank slapshots and open ice hip checks over subtle moves.  The goalies aren't designed to be good, and within a dozen hours you'll find it easy enough to beat them and easy enough that you are forced to play good aggressive defense because the computer is NOT going to bail you out.  One-timers would really be overkill.  Actually passing in the offensive zone is unnecessary.

The first team to send three opponents to the ice will catch fire, and how to use that fire is the strategy of this game.  On offense you cannot be knocked off the puck, you can deke, and your goals can anger the goalie (3 on fire goals make the goalie ready to fight).  On defense every opponent you knock over is going to be looking for a fight.  The choice is yours, and the risk in fighting is real.  I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I imagine trying to get on fire will be the whole game.

Three strikes and you're out is not a hockey rule, until now.  First player to connect three times wins the fight.  Lose and your player will really play poorly afterwards and start subsequent fights on strike 2.  If a player can't land a punch, they're done for the night.  Especially in the playoffs, losing too many fights like that will cause that team to forfeit.  The fights themselves have an odd draggy rhythm that isn't that hard to pick up.

The humor in this game is puerile, but it did make me laugh.  There's some great easter eggs in the stadium signage.

For the price, this game is really fun, and I look forward to seeing OTH2 sometime in the future.",1495241581,1512713489,False,0,0,0.5007285475730896,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Como lo dice su nombre, Old Time Hockey es un título del rudo deporte de patines sobre hielo, ese donde probablemente nuestro recuerdo más fuerte sean peleas en la helada pista, ambientado en los años 70, Old Time Hockey pone a prueba nuestra habilidad, pero más nuestra paciencia.

Cuando recibimos el acceso a probar Old Time Hockey sentimos una gran alegría, desafortunadamente, lo bueno que se veía en los trailers no sería tan divertido como pensamos. Con muchos problemas de diseño y jugabilidad, que le vuelven demasiado frustrante para pasar un buen rato. Old Time Hockey fue creado bajo un enfoque donde simplemente pudiéramos empezar a jugar una vez instalado –con base en una serie de esquema de controles simples, pero nuestra experiencia de primera mano fue pura frustración.

Ni tan Noob Friendly

Incluso en el nivel de dificultad más bajo, los nuevos en el juego podrían no pasarla muy bien. La inteligencia artificial está llena de fallas, Tiene algunos problemas importantes, los defensores de nuestro propio equipo parecen estar en posiciones erróneas todo el tiempo, y lo menos que hacen es evitar que la CPU logre disparos fáciles, y para peores, los porteros son simplemente torpes. Claramente, el juego se vuelve más fácil conforme vamos acostumbrándonos y ganando experiencia que nos permite hacer uso de mejores estrategias. La cámara predeterminada es la de Acción, y es pésima -lo mejor es usar la cámara Classic.

Aunque no todo es jalarse los pelos hasta arrancárselos del colerón, marcar un gol te reconforta bastante después de haber movido mar y tierra para evitar que te marquen una anotación, es divertido que puedes golpear a los jugadores del otro equipo y todo eso, pero si quisiera pelear, me voy a jugar Street Fighter.


Para nuestro infortunio, Old Time Hockey no fue lo que esperábamos.
Pésimos Controles

La  “respuesta” en general a nuestras acciones en los controles es otro punto muy molesto, cambiar el jugador que estamos controlado mientras defendemos o cuando el disco está suelto toma demasiado tiempo, y muchas veces, nos hará controlar al jugador que menos queríamos.

Old Time Hockey tiene las famosas peleas entre jugadores de hockey, las cuales requieren un timing muy preciso, donde rara vez se gana, y es que ganar estas luchas es también un requisito para avanzar a través del modo de historia del juego, haciéndolo algo aún más tedioso. El modo historia es su punto fuerte, con una narración basada en texto a través de las pantallas de carga y con artes de recortes de periódicos.  A lo largo del modo historia, se desbloquean habilidades, esto proporciona algún sentido de avance. Old Time Hockey no cuenta con modo multijugador en línea (sólo local).


Los pésimos controles y jugabilidad le hacen una pesadilla.
Conclusion

A final de cuentas, algo de diversión se puede tener con Old Time Hockey, mínima, pero se puede, simplemente toma algo de tiempo llegar a alcanzar el disfrute.

Old Time Hockey - аркадный симулятор сеговского хоккея от разработчиков V7 Entertainment Inc. При игре в данный проект у меня сложилось двоякое впечатление: олдскульность и скука. В этом обзоре я постараюсь объяснить почему я и рекомендую и не рекомендую эту игру одновременно.

[h1][i]ИСТОРИЯ[/i][/h1]
Я обожал хоккей на своей старенькой приставочке Сега Мега Драйв 16Bit. Сколько часов было наигранно в этом симуляторе я и до сих пор боюсь подсчитывать. Немного позже, когда я приобрел приставку PS1, я сразу же купил какую-то часть из серии NHL. Сколько было фана играть вместе с друзьями в школьный период моей жизни, хотя изначально хоккей я особо и не люблю, больше по нраву футбол. На персональном компьютере я играл в хоккей единожды, очень давно и, если я не ошибаюсь, это был порт какой-то из серий НХЛ. После этого чудный симулятор ""бей в морду"" обходил стороной всеми любимый ПК.  Что вышло в итоге? Не совсем то, что я ожидал. Первые несколько часов игры я пытался разобраться с тактикой... но в итоге оказалось, что ее тут совершено нет! Искусственный интеллект через чур искусственный. Единственное что порадовало - это дух олдскула и драки, но обо всем и поподробней!

[h1][i]ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ[/i][/h1]
Геймплейная часть по виду кажется разнообразной, но по сути я использовал лишь две клавиши - пас удар, которые в момент драки заменяются на удар и уклон. НУ и конечно же финты в виде стрелок, которые просто изменяют движение твоего персонажа. Во время драки вид меняется от стандартного олдскульного, который привязан к куполу арены (приблизительно), на файтинговый. И здесь начинается Мортал Комбат.... если бы. На самом деле либо вам, либо вашему сопернику хватает всего 3 удара, чтобы лечь на лед поспать, а лицо измазанное кетчупом за 3 удара? Реально? Да у нас на улице пацаны держаться гораздо дольше, нежели эти игроки олдскульного хоккея. Очень порадовало, что направление удара можно контролировать. Здесь не просто нажимаешь удар и надеешься на чудо, а контроль удара происходит во время зажимания клавиши и направления стрелками траектории. Хотел я голкиперов вынести в отдельный пункт, но это уж сильно большая привилегия. Они здесь тупы до безобразия, если в старом добром хоккеи обдурить кипера было тяжелее, чем пройти дарк солс (шутка-мишутка), то в этом хоккее достаточно зажать удар, когда вы находитесь практически впритык к воротам. Какие-то сложные схемы распасовки здесь необходимы были бы, если не глупый искусственный интеллект, который пропускает вас чуть ли не к воротам. Да, я делал сложную распасовку и красивые комбинации... но смысл? Зачем заморачиваться если можно просто пройти. 

[h1][i]ГРАФИКА И ЗВУКИ[/i][/h1]
Графика в игре разделена практически на два лагеря. В целом картинка радует, особенно красиво выглядит стадион и удары во время игры. С другой стороны прорисовка персонажей и убогие три празднования гола и однотипные эмоции болельщиков и самих игроков... это просто дикий пи... ну вы поняли. Порадовало наличие крови, хотя не знаю, а не перебор ли это в такой стандартной аркаде? Да и появляется она сразу же после первого удара. Звуки игры на стадионе довольно хорошо подобраны, но звуки ударов или осечки хоккеистов звучат уж очень по-детски... и это в игре где после первого удара появляется кровь. Дорогие разработчики вы уж определитесь для какой аудитории делаете игру. Музыкальное сопровождение во время выхода из матча или перерыва между таймами выбрано не однозначно хорошо. Да, музыкальная тема из ""Семейки Адамсов"" - порадовала, но в основном музыкальные темы ну никаким боком не настраивают на то, что вы играете в хоккей.

[h1][i]ПЛЮСЫ И МИНУСЫ[/i][/h1]
Плюсы:
+ Хорошая атмосфера олдскульного хоккея
+ Можно продумывать красивые комбинации пассов и ударов
+ Боевка в игре очень порадовала
+ Возрождение аркадного хоккея на ПК
+ Хорошая графика

Минусы:
- Ужасный искусственный интеллект
- Однообразные модели игроков
- Скучный геймплей
- Неудачная подборка саундтреков

Old Time Hockey - неуклюжая попытка возрождения получилось у V7 Entertainment Inc. Хотя иногда я ловил себя на мысли, что мне некоторые моменты пришлись по вкусу, но в целом игра провальна. Оценка 5 из 10.

- Veteran mode doesn't make the game harder, it just makes my team's goalie worse.  The exact same shots, breakaways, and ""outplaying"" I do just doesn't work.
- When there's a rebound, the character isn't done with his cooldown so he can be activated to touch the puck again.
- The gameplay is fairly slow and laid back to begin with, and the controls can't even keep up with it.

pros:
its a hockey game on PC in 2017
its playable.
nice soundtrack and audiot
very casual playstyle


cons:
controls feel clunky and slow. 

i dont think the attributes mean much. you can score with any player pretty much all the time until they get hurt.
 
the A.I. is a little lack luster.  once you unlock the full controller ( more on that below) you will win just about every game .

you have to unlock the full controller in story mode  , to use it on exhibition . the only reason i imagine for this is to get people to play the story mode a little .

no online whatsoever. this is less of a con and more of a ""i could like this feature some days and not so much others""


conclusion;
i bought this to support the only hockey game on PC right now. it's not bad, and i hope it does well enough for devs to get the finesse aspect of hockey down. that being said, hip checking,clotheslining and straigt up smashing someone over the head with a stick is fun. praise kek and go Bruins!",1492351517,1492351517,True,1,0,0.505174636840820313,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This may be the least fun and most disappointed I've been with any hockey game I've ever played, and that statement includes my experiences with the terrible NHL '94 port for the Game Gear and the recent 2K game on mobile.

When I saw the announcement for this game I was very intrigued. However, despite what it claimes, this game is not an old-school, retro arcade throwback. It is a low-rent,  unresponsive version of any recent EA hockey game but with cell-shaded graphics and a cheap 1970s attitude.

This game is slugglish at best. It was impossible for me to tell the difference between a player who had bad stats or was fatigued and the game's performance issues.  But it's true crime is the input delay. There is a half second pause between almost every input and the games animations beginning. At no point did I truly feel in control of the players. An arcade hockey game should be a balance between basic hockey instincts and fighting-game level speed with your fingers.  However, this game quicly deteriorated into me mashing a single button and hoping the players animation would trigger, and about half the time it did.

There appear to be no one timers. Perhaps they hadn't been invented by this point in hockey history. However, by 1994 they were well established in hockey video games, so I don't think this game has a good excuse not to have them as well. This means that the strategy of this game is basically to skate to the middle of the ice and shoot, and sometimes it goes in, and sometimes it doesn't. The players response time is not fast enough to be able to count on rebound goals either.  I also found the delay time on the passing to be bad enough that I stopped trying outside of the neutral zone. So, I would just skate backwards (because the game doesn't seem to anticipate that you will do that when you have the puck, and actually seemed faster than skating forward) and then try to take a shot. Which is to say, no actual hockey strategy is needed to be successful in this game. 

So, I'm assuming this is actually a half hearted attempt to recreate Mutant League Hockey.  The hockey itself is secondary, and the true game is abusing the other team as much as possible and then debuffing them by winning fights. However, the fighting itself is terrible. It is slow, unresponsive, and - stop me if I'm repeating myself - feels somewhat random. It also suffers from a lack of animations, there are no satisfying knock out blows, when one player's health is gone, they return to their default grapple stance and then that player turtles and the other one gets to take meaningless shots at them on the ground. Every fight basically plays the same, you circle around and try to take free shots, then you lock into a grapple and punch or dodge, three punches and you're done.  But, it doesn't seems to matter when you hit the button, there is a cool down after each punch, so it will only throw the next one when its ready. And the dodge appears to be broken, except for the computer players. 

I will conceed, fighting in hockey games is incredibly difficult to pull off. Blades of Steel was probably the best, because it was simple, reponsive and intuitive (high / low punch, high / low block). This is has basically been the only formula that has had any success: NHL Hits improved upon it, some of the new EA games also combined this system with a grapple to some sucess. But OTH fails. It is some of the least fun fighting in any game. It is exasperated by the fact that happens 10-20 times per game. Despite a wealth of clips of stick combat in their promotional video, it only happened once for me, and it was great, but only because it seemed to be a one shot kill and the fight ended immediatly afterwards.

I would like to apologize to the developers for this review, because I really wished this game was better. Maybe I came to it with the wrong expectations. I wanted a game that was fast and exciting. I wanted something with the NHL 94 speed boosts, 2-on-2 Open Ice Challenge and Wayne Gretsky 64 powerups, and NHL Hits fighting. But its not any of those things. It feels half baked. I will check back in with it in 3-6 months and I hope they have done significant work. If so, I will gladly change this review to reflect it. But at this point, take a hard, accurate pass on it (because none of the players in the game will).

The only thing that feels good in this game is slashing the puck away from someone. Everything else is not fun. Shooting is not fun, deking is non-existant, passing is slow and unresponsive. 

Story Mode is boring as its basically just the gameplay but with objectives. Objectives like hook someone twice! How fun.

Presentation is horrible. Skate sfx are loud and annoying and only play on turns so it is erily silent when you are not turning so you get to choose from loud or nothing. After a goal is scored you have to watch some stupid canned cutscene every time which is worthless. Says you can hit the ref to stop penalties but the ref is almost never on screen so its impossible. Commentary is wrong most of the time and the stitching of names is clunky matching the gameplay perfectly. 

I guess I just can't see someone thinking this is a good purchase. Needed more polishing in developement feels like they ran out of cash.

V7 Entertainment’s hockey video game is an ode to the beer-drinking, minor league tough guys battling both opposing goons and the post-industrialization of the 1970s. It’s essentially the 1977 film Slap Shot.

It’s also the first hockey game available on PC since EA Sports stopped porting over its NHL series back in 2009 — that’s if you don’t count the tremendous work done by modders to recreate NHL 04, but that’s a story for another day.

Fans looking for a simulation game akin to the NHL series will be a little disappointed. There’s no Sidney Crosby or Connor McDavid. There’s no Toronto Maple Leafs nor even a mention of the National Hockey League at all.

What you get is an arcade sports game with an over-the-top style like NBA Jamz and NFL Blitz. There’s blood on the ice, comic-book action booms come with big hits, and unconscious players have birds circling their heads.

Players accustomed to the NHL series can play Old Time Hockey with advanced controls that use both analog sticks, but there’s also an easier two-button mode made to replicate arcade games of yesteryear. There’s actually even a one-handed “beer mode” that allows you to evidently hold a beverage while playing.

Mechanically, you have the ability perform an array of defensive hockey moves, including: body, hip and poke checks, slashing, and hooking. Don’t worry, just like in today’s NHL, the refs won’t call much.

Laying big hits can give your team momentum and put them “on fire.” In this state, the players are difficult to knock off the puck, basically immune to penalties, and score easier.

Fighting obviously plays an important role in these rinks as well, and you’ll likely have chains of brawls to cycle through each game.

There are only two major problems with the gameplay, the first being the inability to one-time the puck. It’s an absurd omission for any hockey game and should be fixed in a patch. One-timers should be the starting point when designing a hockey video game.

The game’s AI is its other weakness. Your teammates are fairly useless at both ends of the ice, although their general lack of skill and awareness could be passed off as part of the minor-league level of hockey being portrayed. The real annoyance with the AI is the goaltending.

If the netminder makes a save, his only move is to pass it to the back boards. He won’t freeze it. He won’t pass it to the open teammate in the slot. The puck always goes behind the net. Always. This, of course, can too easily be exploited.

Despite the cracks in the ice, Old Time Hockey holds it own as a pretty good game. Where it really shines bright like a lit goal lamp is with its Story Mode. It’s a great touch to a sports game and V7 did a fantastic job setting a tone and atmosphere for the campaign.

You take control of the Schuylkill Hinto Brews, based in Pottsville, Pennsylvania (about 2 hours northwest of Philadelphia). The Hinto Brews are clearly based on another minor league hockey club based in an economically depressed Pennsylvania town — the Johnstown Chiefs, popularized by the aforementioned film Slap Shot. There also are flavors of the 1970s Philadelphia Flyers, nicknamed the Broad Street Bullies.

Like the Chiefs, the perennial-loser Hinto Brews struggle at the start of the season, and it’s your job to turn things around in order to bring a championship back to your struggling community and revenue back to your struggling team.

Each game on the schedule has different objectives that must be completed, such as score a goal while a teammate instigates a fight with the goaltender. Don’t worry, if an objective is too difficult, you can simply go back to the main menu and reload to change it.

V7 patched out a terrible feature that forced players to unlock controls as the season went along, allowing the Story Mode really showcase what the game is  — a goofy, sometimes crude experience fans of sport can enjoy.",1492026903,1492026903,True,4,0,0.525816679000854492,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Although you can set-up and play exhibition matchs, the game focuses on it's 'story mode', which puts you in the shoes of a pre-chosen 1970's era failing bush-league hockey team. This mode is more interesting than it sounds, but having to playing the season with the same pre-defined team may not lend itself to replayability. Hopefully there are other unlockable modes, or the unlocklable ability to play the story/season with a team of your choice.

Gameplay can feel unresponsive at first, but after getting used to it (the game has a different rythm from other arcade or hockey games, even after a day-one patch) it is quite enjoyable.

The story mode introduces lots of humour as you progress mid-way through a season to try and make the playoffs. You can't take decisions on the roster (you just play the games), but events keep happening (reminiscent of the movie Slap Shot), adding context to your games. 

Another plus is that the devs are approachable and involved with the community, with frequent updates and receptiveness towards feedback.

Downsides are that currently multiplayer is only local and that maybe its long-term value is questionable, although maybe the addition of new teams, events for story mode, dynasty features (contracts drafting, etc.), modding tools, etc. might solve this issue.

Too bad the actual hockey aspects of the gameplay aren't very good.

I was playing with the ""retro"" control scheme, but I found it next to impossible to complete most of the game day checklists you're assigned to complete (like blocking or performing clotheslines).

Despite the topic being old school hockey I feel the game is taking itself too seriously. The game pace seems too slow for arcade hockey. Also it seems to be missing one of the most important things on hockey games since NHL'94: one timers. I know NHLPA'93 had fighting and blood but everybody forgot it instantly when NHL'94 came out and it was solely for one improvement (one timers).

When I play this game I don't feel like I'm in control. Especially shooting and passing is very clumsy and lacks any finesse and fluency. I already mentioned the one timers but the passing overall is so unpleasant that you rather just skate to the zone and take a slapper. The skating feels and looks actually pretty good but players should move much faster.

I'm not too pleased about the controls either. The developers have copied the controls from EA's NHL-series, and while I understand it makes this game accessible for NHL-fans it may not be the best suited option for this game. Also I've never understood the point of putting checking to right stick because it's one action that basically should require only one on/off button to execute. Why not have the right stick to control your hockey stick all the time? 

One important thing in hockey games is the randomness and the one of most important things to achieve this is puck physics. I mean despite all flaws in presentation that's the one thing that kept NHl 2K-series alive for so many years. The great memories are born from incidents like ""Remember when you tackled my forward just when he was about to shoot one timer and the puck hit his ass and crossbar and then went in from the back of goalies pad. Man it was fun to watch replay of that.. I think I still have it somewhere"".

A word about the story mode - I've played hockey games on various systems for my entire life, going back to Hat Trick in the arcade or that Activision hockey for the Atari. Nobody -- before Old Time Hockey -- ever tried to create a feeling of running an awful team that seemed hopeless before these guys did so. I *liked* the fact that for my first three games the computer had access to moves that I didn't. I liked the fact that I slowly gained ""powers"", if you will, in story mode. Would I want all hockey games to be like this? No, but after 30 years of playing them it was AWESOME to see developed attempt to get a specific emotional reaction. 

A reaction that unfortunately lead to a lot of kiddos embarrassing themselves on here.

""What's it supposed to do?""

That, everyone, is why this game is in a mess of a state. V7 hasn't just not developed a PC game before, they seem to have not even played one either. This game, in its current state, is another example of awful (absent) steam quality control. This should have been early access - I'm not sure it should even qualify for that in its current state!

V7 revealed it was ""thrown up on Steam"" hastily, only because fans demanded it, and it wasn't their 'focus'. Apparently they would rather compete with EA for hockey dominance on PS4, instead of rule the PC landscape where hockey fans are BEGGING for ANYTHING.

The discussion forums are occupied permanently by a heroic army ready to blame you for this mess, and who hate Quebec (glad it doesn't have multipalyer, I guess). Avoid until heavily patched and you see glowing new reviews. Do not believe what you read there. Believe the reviews only!

*Assinine 4 hour tutorial to teach you the ""baby controls"" before allowing you to unlock the season mode and ""advanced"" (ea style) controls. Thankfully this is now patched (but what were they thinking??)
*Brutally sluggish responsiveness both in menus and gameplay
*Broken support for Xbox360 controllers in Windows 7
*Game plays in slow motion regardless of frame rate, due to some kind of memory leak or ""shader problem"" or something

This game could have been FANTASTIC. And I think it does have potential for sure, but WAIT WAIT WAIT.",1490942418,1490943348,False,5,0,0.374808132648468018,1,True,False,False,False,,,

Fantastic presentation, hockey card collectables, funny (if not a reptative commentary), and I kind of like the low graphic cell shaded look.

The bad:   

Gameplay...  Controls are sluggish, the AI (especially on goalies) is horrible,  advanced controls are locked behind a tutorial wall that is annoying to play through, and lack of multiplayer.    

My suggestion to the devs - go back and play EA's ""3 on 3 NHL Arcade"" game they released a few years back ... that's the control feel you need to hit if you want your game to be sucessful.

Finally, us hockey fanatics have a hockey game other than EA which i havent played since nhl 2004(mods). I love old school hockey and you guys have perfected the animations and ambience of hockey. The models are great, the blood, the colors, the skating (i can watch all day) and shooting animations (slap shots could look a bit more tight though but wrist shot animations are the best ive ever seen no joke). Advanced controls are really in-depth and cool, nice job.


Realistic wishlist: 
-Player lock (maybe at choose sides) (includes goalie selection-will fix goalie dumping the puck to the side of the net everytime)
-More spontaneous fighting. Not so frequent fighting will help us appreciate it more. 3 Line brawls in a game is funny but tiring when we want to win games. Maybe a frequency bar. Maybe suprise knockouts, and more fighting moves (ground and standing) and jersey tugging. Maybe more tripping, bench interation and even flatout in game injuries where the player gets replaced.
-IMPORTANT Output Delay Fix. There seems to be a ""lag"" that everoyne mentions when they bash the passing and shooting in-game. I like it visually and appreciate the fluidity and I noticed the split second delay for when we press either the shoot or pass button, actions don't happen immediately which is frustrating at times. This issue fix will make everyone more patient with this beautiful game!
-If possible maybe a custom camera or camera settings applied to the given cameras (zoom, height)
-Keep alternate jerseys locked until story completion OR give us more to work for like the ability to unlock a special move during fights like an elbow or a headbutt, gut punch, knee.
-Make Big players the obvious ""hammers"" or ""enforcers"" (sometimes the enforcer is NOT the biggest), or instant knockout capabilities if we're an average player, equally make the small guys fast with a longer speed burst (or longer hustle). P.S. The short burst is perfect for the time period!
-More rare dekes, fancy passes, board pinning, team plays, player hops over knocked out teammate on ice (haha) or leaping shots (bobby orr)


Stretch/Long Run Wishlist (DLC):
-Some form of Online Multiplayer (Team matchmaking 1v1 2v2 3v3 etc. Where we can choose sides like in exhibition)
Would be cool to include tournaments, points, leaderboards etc. I know how much work this wish could be, if you guys need resources, money, more support, let the community know. Please don't pull the plug!!!
-Some form of customization. Possibly a custom team with/or access to trades and signings, maybe a late 70's expansion era mode (realistic cause it actually happened).
-Some form of playing one player's story kind of like others have mentioned Be a Pro (if players could take a created player of theirs into storymode they would feel more connected to the game overall)


THANK YOU V7 for awakening my love of hockey. I will continue to support you guys with every little thing you do and every little change to the game. Ive tried to compile a lot of ideas for you guys to think about. Listen to the fanatics and listen to the criticism because in every pile of crap there is always something to take away from it. The community will help Old Time Hockey be the new sheriff in town. This game WILL SUCCEED just with the simple fact that you guys are accepting and dedicated to improving this gem.

+ The dev seems to listen to feedback on the Steam forums.

Cons:
- Controls are very delayed and therefore sluggish. But it seems that they already submitted a patch to fix this.
    - Escpecially checking should be improved, it feels pretty clunky.
- Graphics could be a bit better.

Took me some time to figure out you are supposed to unlock the full moveset over matches in story mode and are expected to lose the first few (you actually only really want to focus on the objectives especially at the start), but that seems to have been changed due to a lot of people not liking this approach.

While a bit frustrating at the start, I actually liked this aspect as it really felt like you are starting off as a team that's a complete mess and slowly build up your abilities. That said, they new update seems to still keep the challenging objectives and the goofy gameplay intact.

The hip check is incredibly powerful, sending players flying and laying out a few successive hip checks has got to be one of the most satisfying things I've done in a video game in recent memory.

Have loved the music and sound effects so far as well and I even love the style of the menus.

Each match has objectives requirements (either learning controls or achieving specific statistics) that are ridiculously difficult to meet; this results in extremely frustrating matches that must be replayed over and over until you luck out and roll easier semi-random objectives. In addition, the advanced control scheme doesn’t unlock until you have progressed far enough in the campaign, restricting your options in the exhibition mode. An easy solution would be to remove mandatory objectives and simply reward any achievements with experience points (a mechanic already in the game). The game also lacks custom seasons and online multiplayer. The control scheme (designed for a gamepad) involves somewhat complicated procedures for shooting, passing, defensive maneuvers (hook, slash, check, block), and fighting; more simplified control schemes are also available (though the story mode requires the advanced controls to be used). Player movement in the game is satisfying, and the hockey itself is entertaining to play. Line changes are automated, and penalties are rare. Momentum may be gained by leveling the opponent three times in a row or gaining a power play, which allows for more powerful shots and hits. The friendly players lack intelligence on defense, although this is possibly by design.

+ Great concept. 70s style rough and tumble hockey.
+ I like the stylized graphics presentation. It works perfect for the 70's theme.

- The gameplay speed is way too slow... It's terrible. It's bothersome so much, I want a refund for this reason alone...
- Controls are not responsive.
- Terrible tutorial

Update: After more time playing and some updates - The game is finally starting to grow on me, this is not NHL EA series, but after some time playing. Its not too bad. The controls, gameplay need to be updated still. 

When you can execute a shot, pass, one-timer and rebound on net without lag. And adjust the goaltenders (your goalie can get scored from anywhere, but you have to score on them mostly by crossing the crease and deking) goalies need to be more balanced. Fighting could be improved as well.

The PC hasn't had a hockey game on it for too long, and the style of game is pretty awesome. That said, there's some things that need to be fixed:
For starters, this game billed itself as the retro control scheme hockey game. That is true, in exhibition mode. If you play the  Story Mode you are locked into the advanced control scheme. Worse, much of the achievements required to progress in the story are control based, meaning that if you don't earn to momentum AND successfully perform a deke with your player (no easy task with a Steam Controller), don't plan on playing the next game. I actually feel more pressure to complete the game's objectives rather than win. I hope a future update to the game allows story to be completed with different control schemes.
Goalie AI needs to be massively improved, as there is currently no control over them whatsoever. I don't really want to play as the goalie, but I feel like if he has the puck I should be in control rather than the game's AI making a bonehead behind the net pass onto the opposing player's stick. 
The exhibition mode makes the game a more enjoyable experience.
I hope updates allow me to write a more positive review.",1490738286,1490738286,False,4,0,0.516476988792419434,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I find it hard to be enamoured with the NHL series because it really seems to take itself too seriously.  Many people are into the ""realistic sim"" sports games, but frankly, I'm not one of them.  I like the NFL Blitzes, NBA Jams, and Super Mega Baseballs of the world.  Games that feel realistic enough to be absorbing but ridiculous enough to be fun.  I'd been looking forward to Old Time Hockey for some time now, and I feel maybe a smidge disappointed.

The game is competently put together and certainly playable.  I like the idea of the game happening in a 70's minor/beer league where the teams are from relatively small towns in America and Canada.  Passes, though they never seem to go EXACTLY where you want them to, are crisp enough that you can transition from offense to defense quickly enough that you can get some nice back-and-forth action.  The game's controls are a nice blend of arcade-style mixed with the modern NHL series liberal use of the right analog stick, which is just sophisticated enough to allow you to pull off cool moves but simple enough that idiots like me can hop in and not feel we have to go though an 8-week educational course to be able to play without looking like a spaz.

I have plenty of niggles with this game though.  While I do like the 70's league idea, the visuals of the game, much like the actual 70's, is a little ugly.  Your teammate AI is pathetic.  Rule one of hockey defense: seperate your opponent from the puck so they can't score on you.  A regular situation in-game is your opponent streaking in alone with your two defensemen back and he casually skates between them and puts the puck top-shelf.  And because switching control to the player you actually WANT to control is an inexact science at best, situations where you are up 3-1 halfway through the 2nd period and let in 4 unanswered goals to make the score 5-3 are a little more common than I'd like them to be.  

The ""momentum"" mechanic is shaky.  How it works is that during gameplay, landing 3 big hits before your opponent does OR drawing a penalty, gives you boosts.  Your players get harder to knock down, your shots get more powerful, and handling the puck is easier.  Meanwhile the other team gets pretty much kneecapped for about 20-30 seconds.  It's supposed to reward you by making it easier to create offense, but call me an awful player, but my success rate is less than 50%.  More often than not, I get scored on before I can take advantage of my momentum.

Old Time Hockey has a story mode, which is an interesting kettle of fish.  A sports game with some actual narrative is neat, and I admit, I have limited experience with it (only 4 hours at time of writing), but it's home to one of the most questionable  design choices the game has. In your first ""story"" you take control of the worst team in the league, and as you get better, so does the team.  I like this idea a lot, but now we get to the questionable part.  You unlock the 'advanced' control scheme bit by bit in the tutorial encased in the first story.  This, I'm guessing, is supposed to lend to the whole ""crawling out of the basement"" thing, and learning the game and getting better at it.  But it is frustrating as hell being schooled by the AI without being able to do half of what they can do.  It's a really long con, almost.  You have to complete objectives throughout a game in order to advance the story, and some of them can be a little unforgiving, especially when you have 2 tough objectives AND you have to win the game while the opposing team plays like a team full of Datsyuks and Crosbys.

But the worst part of the game is one of it's selling points in the advertising: the violence.  The checking is a little wobbly, but works well enough.  It's the fighting I don't like.  Fighting in hockey video games have been little more than button-mashers and stick-flickers, but this game tops it.  It's like rock-paper-scissors almost, and the first person to get hit three times loses.  Post fight, the player that lost gets ""fatigued,"" which basically leaves that player virtually useless.  So if, like me, you really suck at the fighting, by the middle of the third period, your team is full of one-legged sloths that can't shoot or pass against a team who steamrolls your sorry ass.

I know the last four paragraphs have been the game's flaws, and most of that might be because I just rage quit out of it less than an hour ago, but I still like this game.  With a little bit of tweaking, it could be really, really good.  I moreso reccomend this game than not, and at the very least the price tag is reasonable.

1. Having to unlock advanced controls is a ridiculous design choice. You can unlock them by using the Konami code at the 'press A' screen (thanks to a guide in the community section), but still.

2. It feels slow and unresponsive. Considering this is supposed to be like the arcade NHL games, it honestly feels slower than the ""simulation"" ones. It's terrible when I'm trying to switch to a player closest to the puck, and the game decides to switch to two other players further away before finally getting me to the player I want.

3. The controls work in a weird way - when you are playing from the ""upper"" side of the rink, it's down, up on the right stick to do a slap shot, but playing from the ""lower"" side will result in you having to use up, down on the right stick. You end up messing up shots. However, it also seems that you can't properly aim shots either. It's a shoot and pray situation.

4. Resolution is capped to 1080p and framerate is capped to 60fps. I'm on 1440p and 144hz. The framerate I can deal with, but 1080p on 1440p looks bad, and will look even worse on 4k screens. The profile file is encrypted, so no manual editing available.

5. The commentary. The delivery isn't all that great, but what's worse is that you hear the same lines over and over again. Sometimes within a few minutes of each other.

In short, if you have a console, stick with NHL games. This has a bit of blood and is a bit more lax with the rules, but that's about it.

Old Time Hockey is inspired both by classic NHL games like NHL ‘94, as well as hockey movies like Slapshot. The game brings back the glory days of the late 70’s, when helmets were optional (let’s be honest, no one wore them) and concussions were just excuses for wimps to get off the ice. With such inspiration, you might think that Old Time Hockey would be strictly arcade-like, with limited controls and game modes. Well, yes and no.

[h1] Controls [/h1]
During a game you control all five skaters much like you would any hockey game, switching between whichever player will accomplish the task, whether that be hitting someone off the puck or ripping a slapper for the top shelf. The controls feel very comfortable, you can use the simple two-button approach or go for the advanced scheme. If you are familiar with the control scheme of EA’s NHL franchise, the advanced controls will feel right at home. Skating with the left thumbstick feels right, with the physics a little more on the heavy side and things like momentum and weight make an impact here, but you’re still able to skate accurately once you’ve had some experience.

The same story applies for shooting with the right stick, although it was a little hard to get used to in the two button scheme. In either case, you can aim your wristers and slappers, making it feel as if you are actually getting scoring chances instead of just pushing a button and pelting the goalie until the game decides you can score now. No matter which control scheme you choose, there is a slight delay between button press and action on screen. This will most likely lead to double pressing buttons or just mashing the button until your player does what you want him to, often times too late for that sick pass or sweet scoring opportunity. Because of this, it’s nearly impossible, as far as I can tell, to set up one-timers. Personally I would recommend playing with the advanced controls, since some new options open up to you on both the defensive and offensive side of the ice. Poke checks, dumping the puck, and protecting the puck all require you to use advanced controls, and you can bet a bag of pucks the opposition will be using these moves against you. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Speaking of opposition, let’s talk AI, starting with the opposing teams. Each team has a rating for offense, defense, and fighting, but as far as I can tell, these numbers don’t necissarily mean much out on the ice. When you play against the computer the other team will have no problem using poke checks, hooks and hits to get the puck from you, and the refs tend to fall on the side of “Let ‘em play!” but since this is the ‘70s era, it’s to be expected. It’s not odd to find only one or two penalties called per game, and some games will go by without even one! Just don’t lay the lumber on too much and you should be able to fend off the attempts for the puck. 

As for your own team, I did notice a few things that I personally would have liked to see out of my team. Since you can’t control things like aggressiveness on the forecheck or your team breakout from your zone, you’re playing with your team as opposed to leading it. However, sometimes this means pulling a player out of position to pick up the puck in front of your net, frantically switching players until you get the one closest to the puck, player position be damned, or trying to set up a 2 on 1 only to have your teammate come to a dead stop at the blue line. It can be frustrating at times, but you’ll end up adapting your strategies and learn when you can and can’t pull certain plays off after logging enough time with Old Time Hockey. In fact, you will have to if you want to unlock the advanced controls. More on that in a moment.

It wouldn’t be a sports game without game modes, but if you’re looking for a general manager’s mode or even a season mode, the closest you’ll get is story mode. Story mode sees you playing as the epicly bad Schuylkill (skool-kill) Hinto Brews, the game’s version of the Chiefs, as you pull the team out of the dregs of amatuer hour in the Bush Hockey League. Starting with a cool zero stars in each of the three stats for overall team performance, it’s your job to turn the ship around and start winning and improving the team. However, you won’t do this by making trades or running practice drills, instead, you’ll play games in the scheduled season and learn how to play Old Time Hockey with mandatory tutorial objectives spread across mutiple games. So in your first game you might learn the basics of hitting and shooting, then three games down the road you’ll learn about dumping the puck and hip-checks. 

Until you complete the entire tutorial, you will not have access to the full repitoire of moves in exhibition mode. Thankfully, as you unlock moves you will be allowed to use them in story mode, which is nice considering your rivals will be using moves against you that you might not be able employ at the time. It’s an odd choice considering many people who will be turned on to this game will already understand the basics of these skills and, like me I’m sure, will be frustrated that you cannot use them from the very first puck drop. Other than story and exhibition modes, there’s not much else to see or do in Old Time Hockey. As of yet online multiplayer is absent, the only multiplayer being local exhibition mode with up to four players. 

[h1] Audio and Visual [/h1]
The game looks and sounds unique, to put it nicely. Player models look about the quality of a Nintendo 64 game, albiet in HD. Jerseys are colorful though, and an outline effect over each player makes the action easily readible on screen. Fluid animation and a smooth 60 FPS also contribute to how clearly it’s all presented. The sound all works, skates cut the ice as you’d expect, shots ring off the crossbar, and players even yell at the refs, just like you’ll be doing when they don’t call a penalty! The music is licensed, and while I doubt you’ll be adding most of the songs to your playlist any time soon, there are a few that stand out. I’m just thanking the hockey gods that there doesn’t seem to be any generic, royalty-free stock music. You know what I’m talking about, the kind of stuff you hear on free mobile games. Old Time Hockey is presented in a package that actually conveys a sense of time (the 70’s) and gives you a bit more to bite off than “it’s a hockey game, press start to play hockey”.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
When the final buzzer blares and the ice is cleared, Old Time Hockey is a good sports game, standing at the precipice of greatness and is extra special for those PC and Nintendo gamers, who’ve really got the high stick when it comes to hockey games on their favorite platform. It’s not without it’s faults, but with as much potential that exists here for future updates, such as adding features like a team creator, player creator, logo and jersey creator, online multiplayer, season mode, stuff like that, this game could really build a following, depending on how much support the game is given after release. It’s not beholden to the whims of the NHL or some large corporate entity that decides whether or not next year's iteration will be just another roster update. However, I can’t judge a game by what it could be, only by what it is today. The decision to lock the advanced controls is probably the biggest drawback I can think of right now.That said, Old Time Hockey is a good ol’ hockey game that bridges the gap between simulation and arcade sports title. It’s meant to be played for the fun of the game. I mean, it has a beer control mode so you can drink beer and play the game at the same time, for Gordie’s sake! If that’s not sports game innovation, I don’t know what is.",1490727932,1490727932,True,2,0,0.48267093300819397,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Replays are so much fun in hockey, i guess the developers were afraid the replays could show how bad their animation is...

And the Fights are so lame. And another 1 on 1 fight, and another...

Now its a true 1970s hockey game where u go out and try to win. Well worth the money now! I Would say buy this game now!

UPDATE2: looks like they got rid of the mission so ill recommend it now. some controles seem better but now if can get rid of the objectives and just play hockey

UPDATE: I have received a reply from the devs saying they plan to release a patch in the next few hours to address the crash in the goalie mission (and hopefully fix the mission) Once i see the change I will update to a thumbs up

Ok let first off start by saying i like this game and pains me to give it a thumbs down....I WILL CHANGE THE REVIEW WHEN THEY FIX THE GAME

the game at its current state is fustraiting and the devs didnt seem to listen to many of the pre release critics..
1st for your 1st eight games u will loose.. cant do anything about it but ull loose to get the point across that the team sucks. So then you finally get to the mission where you have to win! great they dont hold you back! i won the game....but i cant advance....why. because like other had said- the primary objectives are insane. I have spent 2 hours on all diffuculties trying to score a 3 goals with the same player while on fire (which can only be acheived by nailing so many perfect checks).....its insnane...everytime i get 2 fire goals...the goalie blocks every 3rd goal...and yet i cant advance. THE ONLY TIME I BEAT THE THING THE GAME CRASHES RIGHT WHEN FIGHT STARTS

Next...the controlles do lag on certain things. I havnt had a passing lag issue but i have had it where the player just randomly pass the puck around despite who your aiming at if a large cluster of player form.. Also the checking doesnt work half the time for me. Hip check, poke, slash, all work flawlessly but not body check. its a 50-50 whether it works or not. sometimes ill just bumb into the player and nothing happens depite hiting the control...other times ill get the check from a position that makes little sense.

these are the only issues i have with the game but the 1st point is a major issue. if they get rid of the stupid tutorial crap---then its worth a buy...untill that- its just fustraiting meaningless gameplay. Your not trying to play hockey or win...your just trying to meet pointless objectives",1490722742,1490856074,True,0,0,0.497385323047637939,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Really fun game with lots of control options and love the stylized retro charm.  While it may not be for everyone, or 100% fulfill the want for real hockey on PC... it's well worth the purchase price.

Good :
- No NHL, No problem.  BHL brings fun smash mouth 70's hockey with great atmosphere.
- While maybe not for everyone, I really love the retro feel and art style.
- Multiple control options... two button, multiple button, dual stick (a loose version of the recent EA NHL titles).
- It's a new hockey game on PC!

Not So Good :
- Story Mode is very punishing to start, expect to lose your first few matches to the AI.  This is heavily because only very basic controls (wrist shot, pass, check) are provided to start.  As you progress through the story you unlock more controls (slap shot, hip check, poke check, etc).
- Only once you finish the Story Mode, can you play a season/career with any team of your choice.  Wish decision was up front.
- Animations could use some work... some very awkward moments.
- Some controls could be tightened up, such as slap shots and body checks.

Bad :
- No Online MP at this time, local only.
- Advanced (dual stick) Controls locked behind Story Mode progression... can't even try them in Exhibition until you unlock it in Story Mode.

I'd give it a 7/10.  Really hope the dev continues with future updates to address of a few of my concerns.  Overall happy with my purchase, even at full launch price ($15 CAD).

It's good old arcade hockey gameplay wrapped up in a very unique 70s style. I love everything about the style with the small arenas, the soundtrack, the bluish ice, the sports cards you unlock, to just the art presented in the game in general.

The gameplay is a clunky, though. It all works, but it sadly isn't as responsive as you want it to be. There's noticeable delay you have to adjust to. It's not the hardest to learn, but it takes some time. The AI generally is fine, but I notice that they sometimes don't pursue the puck and it'll just sit there until you get it or your opponent wakes up from the nap your hit put him in. The goalies also never cover up the puck to stop play, they will always pass it away or behind/the side of the net. This is easy to predict, as well, so you can just keep regaining control of the puck pretty easily.

The only thing I dislike is that the advanced controls are locked for exhibition until reach a certain point in the story. Even in the story you only learn certain parts of the advanced controls and can't use other ones until you ""learn"" it later on. For example you can't do a slap shot until the game tells you that you can. Even if you looked up the controls and knew what to do, the game will not allow you to do it until you reach that point. It took about 3 hours or so for me to fully unlock the controls, that is way too long.

Old edit: Pretty much what I expected after patiently waiting for this game for months. Fun to play for a little while but I imagine this game truly comes alive when you get some friends over and play against them instead of the AI which sometimes har major advantages (ability to throw hits with multiple players at once, seeing what happens outside your field of view).

and now onto the review

[h1]TL;DR Review[/h1]


Old Time Hockey is hockey game with a strong influence of NHL '94. It takes us back to the ""good ol days"" of Hockey where the rules were WAY more lax to say the least, and ruthlessness was encouraged as opposed to today's game.

-Gameplay-

Old Time Hockey has two game modes, Exhibition and Story Mode, unfortunately no online (as of now, I spoke with the devs and they told me if there was a ton of support for it, they would heavily look into it). Exhibition mode is a local multiplayer mode(for up to 4 players) with AI opponents included. We have 10 teams to choose all of which have very unique names, my personal favorite being the Long Island RumRunners. With a few different controller schemes, Classic. Two button mode. Beer mode (for one handed gameplay) and Advanced. Story Mode launches you into a failing franchise Hinto Brews, as you follow a classic from ""last to champs"" storyline. Afterwards you are rewarded with a ""Career Mode"" type of mode where you can play a full season with a team of your choosing.


-Graphics, Sound & Artstyle-

Old Time Hockey looks and sounds amazing. As soon as I started it up, I felt brought back to the days of my childhood as I blew on my SNES cartridge of NHL 94. The song ""Old Time Hockey"" along with the very retro soundtrack was just AMAZING to listen to.  


-Price-

The retail price is 11.99 USD 


-How many hours estimated?-

Honestly, I get lost in GREAT sports games like this. With inevitable DLC and hopefully WORKSHOP, I can see myself playing this game for HUNDREDS of hours.


-Buy it Now? Wait for Sale? Don't Buy?-

When I first a trailer to this game I was immediately sold, this was a much needed hockey game on Steam. One that delivered the retro mindless arcade feeling to it. I took a break from the NHL series and playing OTH made me feel so satisfied. There are some things I'd like to change about OTH, like the almost idiotic Defense AI, or the fact that you have to go through a vigorous tutorial on story mode, not having ADVANCED controls unlocked from the start. It has a heavy emphasis on hitting and sometimes it feels too easy to get some hits, but as told by Karthik, it's meant like that to give you the 70's Hockey feeling. The fights are a ton of fun too, although repetitive when doing line brawls but overall I've had tons of fun with the game. Will I recommend this game? HELL YES.

Be prepared to lose games in the beginning from left to right. The AI on rookie level is skating past you anywehere on the ice since you don't have the boost ability.....due to rookie controls, not advanced.

It's a wonderful game if you enjoy the feel of older school hocky games.  


For 12 bucks this is a great deal, with only one real negative. 

The negative is that you have to do this odd story thing where you have to unlock moves.  I get what they're trying to do, it's cool you play more you unlock more modes, and skills.  But this is very clunky way to do it, and it's not fun having to get on fire three times, and score with same guy, just to complete a primary objective.  Win the game 9-1? Doesn't matter if you weren't on fire 3 times and fought the goalie...  I've won same game over and over, but have only managed to score 2 on fire goals so I'm stuck replaying this rather early game just to advance to learn and start fighting.

Having said all that, this game and story are really fun, I played three hours straight and it works better than ubisoft games on release day! 

Looking forward to seeing where this game goes.  

If you liked the movie slapshot you'll enjoy the random stories that are told as well.

- Poke Check
- Hook
- Deke
- Boost

While the CPU of course could do all these things. What the fuck where the developers thinking? Raged like a bitch and refunded this piece of shit. If the developers want to feed their kids I shit twice a day, feel free to bring a bucket. Eat a fucking dick.",1490699197,1490699197,False,10,2,0.274509698152542114,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The problems that I have with this is the skating, passing, AI, and faceoffs(Advance controls). the skating feels so sluggish, I feel like I'm skating in slush. The passing is nice just why is it every time I make a pass my player comes to a dead stop to recive it? It should be one fluent motion right? The AI is relentless... especialy in story mode. Ive only scored 1 time in the 5 games Ive played, and the AI has not scored less then 10 in each game. When I shoot the puck its either glass, post or out of play. Which moves me to faceoffs, extremly difficult to perform in story mode. As stated earlier I'm not doing so well, haven't won a single faceoff (Advance controls). I know this game hasn't been out long and I still have to work at it, but when I can't even get pass the tutorials I have to believe that it my not be just me.",1490692879,1490692879,True,13,1,0.590301930904388428,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I can't explain how HAPPY I am to have a Hockey game on steam. Maybe now I can get rid of my Xbox One and NHL 17... I'm not so sure. I love the Sega Genesis style, but it just feels to be lacking. It is really hard to switch players. I wish it was more acurate and when you switched players it selected the player closest to the puck. The puck to ice physics are meh. The puck doesn't slide enough. The controls are not horrible, it would bve nice to polish them a bit more. I understand the Sega feel, but it just feels a tad clunky still.

I really hope the devs stay on this release and we see some good patches. I would LOVE for them to eventually add ONLINE multiplayer, even at the barest of bones. Just let me play a match. I don't need rankings/leaderboards ect, it would just be nice to form a communtiy around this.

If the devs read this, as I think I am the first person reviewing this, PLEASE continue to support this game. It has a ton of potential, even more so with a DEAD sports section on PC (Look at Rocket League). I'm loving it so far, and I for sure watched the leaked footage on youtube and still purchased Day 1. Please update this game!

Edit 1: I'm happy to see the day after release they have already updated the game and acknowledged the issues and fixed them already! Keep it going devs! But uh, why do I have to go through the tutorials multiple times? lol.

Edit 2: Today they updated the game, yet again. The list is extensive. Would still love the online multiplayer. I feel alone. :( Maybe even a shoot out mode. Keep the updates coming guys! This could be THE hockey PC platform game. There's no other competition ;p",1490688820,1491456468,True,73,3,0.844963788986206055,3,True,False,False,False,,,
