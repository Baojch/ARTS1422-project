Acho que de todos os jogos de quebra-cabeças que já joguei esse é o meu favorito.

[b]Visual e Sonorização: 10/10[/b]
Love is Dead possui um visual bem bacana, bem no estilo cartoon, é bem agradável de se ver e bem criativo, o jogo possui diversos temas diferentes visuais diferentes e a cada mundo que você passa o tema muda. A música também é bem agradável, não atrapalha nem um pouco e se encaixa muito bem no jogo.

[b]História: 10/10[/b]
O jogo começa com uma história aonde os dois personagens que você controla foram mortos e voltaram como zumbis porém perderam seus animais de estimação e agora eles tem que procurá-los vagando por um mundo infestado de zumbis, e o casal agora vai pelo mundo em busca de seus animais de estimação enquanto comem panquecas. 

Não é nenhuma história com desenvolvimento ou um enredo ou algo do tipo, apenas uma historinha para dar o tema ao jogo, porém contada de uma forma bem legal e tem uma narradora que narra algumas coisas normalmente no início dos níveis, algo bem divertido e bacana para complementar o jogo.

[b]Mecânica: 10/10[/b]
Não é um jogo difícil, em alguns níveis você vai ter que pensar um pouco mais que nos outros ou então agir um pouco mais rápido que em outros níveis, mas no geral é bem simples e fácil. Normalmente a  maioria dos níveis possuem o mesmo objetivo que é unir o casal, um personagem começa em uma ponta e o outro na outra e você tem que uni-los, alguns níveis vão possuir outro objetivo, mas no geral é sempre esse reunir os personagens e pegar as panquecas pelo nível. 0 jogo começa com as básicas como desviar de obstáculos, evitar os outros zumbis e conforme você vai avançando no jogo novas mecânicas e inimigos vão sendo introduzidas. 

O jogo é bem divertido e interessante, um dos poucos jogos que já joguei em que cheguei no final e queria jogar mais. Não é um jogo curto, dá pra rendar diversas horas e diversão, vale a pena comprar.

Denn das Spiel hat viel, das für es spricht. Aber eben auch eklatante Schwächen, die vor allem mit zunehmendem Spielfortschritt immer gewichtiger werden.

Dass das Spiel keine Totalgurke ist, wird schon deutlich daran, dass ich über 7 Stunden mit dem Spiel verbracht habe. Tatsächlich macht das Spiel zunächst viel Spass und ist ein idealer Zeitvertreib für eine kurze Partie zwischendurch. Die Puzzles machen Laune und die unpräzise Steuerung nervt manchmal, aber damit kann man leben. Denn man wird belohnt mit einer superniedlichen Story mit viel Herz und Humor, sodass man weiter und weiter spielen will.

Genau das lässt dann aber im Laufe des Spiels den Nervfaktor mehr und mehr kippen. Eigentlich würde ich zu gerne die Story fertig spielen, aber nach etwa der Hälfte der Levels musste ich entnervt aufgeben. Schuld daran ist die schwabbelige, unpräzise Steuerung. Ständig führt das zu tödlichen Fehltritten, sodass man den Level nochmals neu spielen muss. Eine Qual, wenn man schon fast durch war und die Figur dummerweise zwei Felder weit hüpft und direkt im Wasser landet.

Das ist ultraschade, denn eigentlich sind sowohl die Puzzle als auch die sonstige Gestaltung ein echter Spass. Aber wenn der Frust den Spielspass mehr und mehr überdeckt, dann ist es Zeit, ein Spiel aufzugeben.

Fazit: Wer einfach ein bisschen puzzeln möchte und keinen Anspruch erhebt, ein Spiel zu Ende zu spielen, der kann durchaus einige Stunden Spass an diesem Spiel haben. Aber wer gerne eine Story zu Ende führen möchte, der sollte die Finger von diesem tollen Spiel mit schlechter Steuerung lassen.",1701705841,1701705841,False,1,0,0.522471904754638672,3,False,False,False,True,,,

[h1]Intro[/h1]
[b]Love is Dead[/b] is a puzzle game about two zombies that are looking for their lovely pets. The game has 61 levels with some optional, easier levels in between. It offers both single-player and local co-op with 2 players, but since I only played in single-player mode, this review will be based on that.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- 61+ levels with varying mechanics
- Collectibles to make the levels more challenging

[b]Cons:[/b]
- It's hard to finish levels that rely on diagonal movement

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
The main character might not look appealing since they are just ""fat stickmen"" without hands and feet, but the monsters, especially the ghost, look so adorable in this style. The backgrounds are made in a similar style as the models, albeit with more detail to make them stand out. The varied theme and level design also help to make not only each world but also each level differ from each other. It's always nice to see the variation that the game offers.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story revolves around the premise that was given at the beginning of the game. Dialogues are voice dubbed with a clear and soothing sound, making it easier to listen. Some subtitles don't match with what the voice dub said, although luckily, the in-game dialogue is usually not important. It usually talks about either the story or the mechanics that the characters encounter, along with some tips on how to go through them. They are told in such a lovely way, making the zombies look innocent despite them doing something that might scare humans.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game allows you to be in control of a pair of lovers which can be switched anytime you want. Each level has different objectives, but you usually have to do a combination of going through the obstacles, infecting humans, saving zombie pets, and meeting with your lover. Although some levels place both characters at the same spot, others spawn them in different spots, requiring you to switch between them to clear the level. You eventually need to reunite the couple in the end, with or without collecting a collectible beforehand.

Each level is divided into 3 segments, equaling to a different map and puzzle. A pancake collectible is usually hidden in each segment to give more challenge to the level. They are usually not hard to obtain, and although they are optional, you still need to collect some to progress the game. I enjoyed collecting them in my playthrough since the main game will be too easy without them.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1815677384

Surprisingly, the game offers a lot of mechanics. It introduces a new mechanic at almost every level while still retaining some of the previous ones. However, everything will be scrapped once you reached a new world; the game will introduce a new mechanic that is unique to that world by then. Strangely, I never got overwhelmed with them - all mechanics are easy to learn and memorable.

[b]Movement[/b]
Enemies are annoying to beat. Your character uses tile-based movement, and although it helps when you need to avoid enemies in narrow places, the same can't be said when you need to eat them. You need to bait them to attack before you can do that and enemies usually won't attack unless you stop running away. However, since the character has a slow acceleration speed, you'll most likely die from their attack before you can walk again if you decide to stop.

The tile-based movement also can prove to be problematic with the level design. Some level has rotating blades, which can be troublesome when you need to move your character diagonally. Since the game doesn't support walking diagonally, you need to press two buttons to achieve that, and sometimes, the character won't move to the right position. There was an occasion when the character moved to the top-right when I pressed both the down and right buttons in one of the levels. Luckily, there aren't many levels that require these mechanics.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2785847285

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished the game in 8.6h. I spent the rest of my playtime finding some secret exits that can be used in speedrunning, which is not needed for achievement completion. One achievement is bugged in the game, which can only be fixed by installing an unofficial patch. As for the difficulty, it is on the medium side - some sections might annoy you, but you just need to replay the level a few times until you get the hang of it.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
As someone who has played the [url=https://www.kongregate.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=i+saw+her]i saw her[/url] series, flash games that were the prequel of this game, this one looks different but feel similar at the same time - it has a different look and mechanic, but level designs are still cleverly done. The introduction of some easy levels in between helps to refresh my brain, and the short levels help to urge you to keep going. I never got bored playing the game and always looked forward to seeing what each level will bring. I could definitely recommend the game, although not at a full price due to some problems that I mentioned.

I played this together with a friend and we unlocked all additional collectables in our playthrough. My playtime should be accurate to how much we played, minus an hour or less.


Gameplay/Positives:

The game starts very easy, but then continues to get more difficult. It's puzzle-like (never too hard of a brain teaser though), but also involves a lot of timed movement (4 directions only, no special jumping or other actions involved). Nothing too hard in my opinion, but if you or your wingman cannot hop your way out of an easy frogger level, then you might want to fetch something else. The final levels are slightly challenging too, so be prepared.

What's really nice about the game is the variety of content in the levels; many mechanics, obstacles and enemies are briefly introduced, you play around with them, then immediately discarded for another new mechanic / gimmick, so that all stages are very fresh - through the entire game you won't ever be thinking ""time to do more of xyz again"", as more levels with more new gimmicks keep popping up.

The story is told by an american narrator with a very slight southern accent, whom you meet in the overworld in-between worlds - a kind of travelling musician character. She'll make a lot of puns along the way and some other PG-rated jokes. Overall nothing dramatic, just a bit of a fun commentary as you play through the levels.



Minor negatives:

Note that some users have reported bugged achievements (they worked for me - well, we got the all photos achievement before we actually had all of the photos, but other than that it worked fine), but there's also a fan-patch in the forums for that.

While the game lets you pick the color and the pronoun of your character, the in-game dialogue never refers to the characters in any sort of way that would require a pronoun, so the choice is meaningless (doesn't matter to me either way).

A handful of written monologues differ from what the voice acted narrator actually says; 2-4 or so lines were missing audio altogether.

---

Overall very recommendable to people that play video games occasionally but regularly, or just want to play something fun with a friend.

The slight challenge of the stages and constant new mechanics keep the game interesting for more adept gamers as well, but there isn't any extreme challenge involved here - definitely not intellectually .The aforementioned movement timing should be only slightly challenging for averagely skilled gamers that are capable of completing execution-oriented games, and moderately challenging for those that aren't.",1642256821,1642257454,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

2. Even though it's a puzzle game, many puzzles are not at all about figuring out the solution. You will need quick reflexes, which in my opinion, undermines the puzzle mechanics too much.
3. The game is not good at teaching you mechanics. Most of them are intuitive enough, but some of them can only be learned by experimenting, trial and error. Also you can't see the controls in any menu which is annoying, you gotta press random keys to see what things you can do with the keyboard.

Considering the completed achievements, this little game must be hiding in a lot of libraries, untouched/unfinished.

Kid friendly, LGBTQ+ conscious, easy, laid back, casual puzzle adventure. 

As a zombie couple, you are lost without your two zombie pets, and search the world looking for them. To do so requires you to navigate puzzles full of dangers, from bat swinging humans to pirate cannons and more. You'll also have to collect delicious pancakes along the way to progress further, get your pictures taken at landmarks, all while being guided by a friendly lady with a guitar. 

The puzzles are simple enough for anyone to complete. The AI can trick you out enough to make it interesting. The different regions are distinct enough to differentiate each from the other. Each of them present different aspects of the game and are visually pleasing. It's not too cartoonish for an adult to play while being vibrant enough to capture a child's attention. 

I've been playing the game solo but there is an ability to play Co-op. 

It's not your AAA shooter or open-world RPG, but it's very well done and apparently a sleeper in many people's libraries.

Love is Dead is the first game I've played from start to finish using Steam's ""Remote Play Together"" feature. It was surprisingly stable, although I'd certainly recommend that both players use wired connections in order to play (rather than Wi-Fi). There were a few somewhat twitchy sections (dodging enemy sword attacks) where any lag could be punishing. Steam has also found some way to mitigate the pernicious echo issue that I've had using the Parsec program to play local co-op games with friends.

The game itself has a neat variety in level environments and objectives, although it runs a little long. We enjoyed the game enough to continue until it's conclusion, but we wouldn't have been upset in the least if the game were 2-3 hours shorter. The down-home-tootin' narration of Elspeth Eastman was fine enough, especially since both my co-op partner and I are from the South, although it too wore out its welcome after a while.

If you have a co-op partner that enjoys puzzle-platformers, I think you'll both enjoy yourselves, especially if you can snag this one on sale. Spread love (zombification) everywhere!",1609351910,1609351986,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Il s’agit d’un jeu d’adresse avec un peu de réflexion, sans voler très haut dans chacune de ces catégories, mais juste ce qu’il faut pour nous challenger, sans jamais rester à buter sur un niveau. Bon y’a quelques niveaux qu’on recommence plusieurs fois, mais je trouve la difficulté assez bien dosée, et chose très appréciable, c’est qu’elle reste constante au fil de l’histoire. Car là où certains jeux nous proposent une progression uniquement basée sur une difficulté de plus en plus élevée, ici le jeu arrive à se renouveler à chaque monde avec de nouveaux ennemis et de nouvelles plateformes, qui changent un peu la façon de faire, mais pas pour autant la difficulté.

Et je trouve que par son coté « abordable » (les parties les plus compliqués des niveaux étant en plus des bonus non indispensables pour la progression), le jeu qui propose un mode coop se prêterait très bien pour jouer avec un enfant, mais sinon tout est faisable en solo, où l’on dirige alternativement les deux personnages quand c’est nécessaire, bien que la majorité des niveaux peuvent se faire en ne bougeant qu’un seul des joueurs, le fait d’être à deux peut juste faire gagner du temps pour remplir les différents objectifs.

Love is Dead is a co-op puzzle game where your goal is for both players to reunite. You both start on opposite ends of the level and are forced to solve a variety of puzzles in order to get close to each other. It is a solid idea but in practice, it is clunky and frustrating. Dying forces you to restart, making it very annoying when both players are having trouble with a level. One of you may succeed on a difficult part, but if your partner makes a mistake, you have to do it all over again. It creates a chain of each partner messing up the other, something that goes against the theme of the game. The movement is also awkward because you and your partner have grid-based movement, while most other objects move continuously. The game difficulty also doesn't fit the theme, as it comes off like a casual game for 2 people that just want to relax and have fun, but most of the later levels are fairly difficult. The story is also pretty weak, corny, and cliche. The narrator is overly sentimental and sounds way too sappy for the plot to even be moderately interesting. Overall, a poorly executed game that should have been much better than it turned out.

The game feels like it has been developed as a coop game in its entirety, so playing it alone is kind of bothersome for some of the puzzles.

Mechanics wise the game features a lot of different biomes as well as puzzle types and for an indie game it has a very solid amount of content with mostly good puzzles, but the downsides are abysmal look, very boring art design, an annoying soundtrack and quite clunky controls. Truth be told the downsides are so severe that I personally cannot recommend this puzzle game because there's scores of better ones out there.

It's not a bad game, it truly isn't. But it's not worth recommending either. If you're really starved for puzzles, then give this a look, otherwise just skip out on it.
