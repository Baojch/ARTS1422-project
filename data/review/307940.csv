The games just kinda meh. 

There's nothing to the combat. You either shoot the enemies before they reach you at all or you facetank with melee. Enemies are waaaaay too fast imo. If they run into a slope they will literally ramp through the air. They also attack at machine gun speed which is kinda annoying.

Having to craft ammo constantly is very grindy and makes the game boring. Plus I feel that the weapons are very lack luster compared the hundreds of zombies you're pitted against. Plus there's literally 20 ft tall zombies.

The building in this game is very janky. First of all half the time you won't be able to place anything because the game just won't let you. The game will outline your builds in red when the terrain is unsuitable and it pretty much does that everywhere, The snapping in the building barely works also. Also everything has to built on a foundation and if your foundation is destroyed either everything will fall down or you won't be able to build onto that structure further. Literally any interaction with any tool including your fist can destroy a foundation. So it's very easy to destroy your entire house while trying to do so much as destroy a table and move it.
Using stairs foundations and ceilings and floors alleviated this issue.

On the bright side the map is quite large seemingly. There's a large enemy variety so far. I've seen at least 4 kinds or mutants or zombies. Plus at least 7 different animals. I haven't explored very much so I hope there's more variety going forward.
Going forward, I think I saw one new enemy.

overall the game is just functional enough to be somewhat fun.

- an interesting survival game that involves new ideas of game mechanics

- a really good price

The last bit is something to strongly take into account. Does the game have bugs? Yes, but a few that are not game-breaking (holding the shovel makes you dig any time you press a random key; animals' movement is a bit bugged).
Is it a bit unintuitive at the start? It is! But ofc it's important to take into account if you buy Hogwarts for 60 bucks where you expect all mechanics to be smooth or an 8 bucks game for which the price is really cheap.

I can see that there was a lot of work put into it.
The map is vast with many different locations, enemies, ""objectives"" and story to discover and you have a fine variety of tools and resources. It's enough to keep you engaged and not bored, or at least not for some time. 

Yet there are many downfalls to it that don't really keep me wanting to play it further.
The main one is its absurd main objective. Everything would be fine if there only was 1 island and not 3. If they would at least be a little different from each other. The only thing that changes when going from one to another is their difficulty and the tower placement. At that point, the gameplay reached its peak annoyance.

There are also many bugs, like the shovel automatically hitting the ground whenever opening your inventory.
It's already been two times that I placed a bed and it dissapeared the next time I launched the game.
Ranged weapons don't have any projectile drop. You could basically shoot an arrow across the map if you'd want.
What's more, the sound of projectiles landing is like a dynamite exploding. Including spears and arrows.
Enemies have higher range of melee attacks than you do, which makes fighting at close hand really difficult and, in the end, not even worth it.
Yeah and the ragdoll physics are goofy.

I went out of my way to get all the achievements and I really enjoyed my play through. Overall the game is not the most polished out there but its not very buggy either; that's usually how it works out with mobile ported games. The progression is slightly repetitive being you are simply doing a similar task over and over until you beat the game but oddly enough every time you do it it feels oddly unique each time. It's a very creepy, blood warming, feeling gearing up and arriving at the next irradiated tesla tower compound to shut it down, and a relief when you finally do. There were some times where I was legitimately scared. I would call it a 'slight' horror game; meaning if you just walked around at laughed at everything you really wouldn't get scared but when you take the game seriously it will definitely freak you out. However, not all of the thrill of this game is in the horror. The looting and crafting feel really gratifying in this game, and finding a new fast travel safe house is always a treat. At the end of this game I was really happy to have played all the way through. There's no huge ending, which is to be expected from an indie studio game of this size. However, if a AAA studio got a hold of a game concept just like this one (Without flooding it with corporate greed like micro transactions) it would truly be something. If you want a break from mainstream games I would definitely recommend this one.

大概是7，8年前在iOS接触到的手机端？无意间翻到的游戏，刚玩就上瘾了。那会只能玩玩盗版，后续付费内容解锁不了。现在看来游戏中有不少漏洞缺点，但不得不说它仍是一款很棒的游戏。

游戏的背景应该设定在二战期间，但故事背景则在二战前。
[spoiler]""1932年日本军方开始秘密进行有关电磁场军事化应用的试验（根据游戏中的场景，貌似有731与701两支部队的参与？731主攻生物，701主攻物理）。1941年，他们已经可以利用电磁场扭曲时空以实现隔空传送，于是就用这种技术建设了一片人工群岛——即辐射岛。也就在同一年，这片群岛连同上面生活、研究的军民一起消失。1943年，美国军队将一个特殊的电磁实验任务交给埃尔德里奇号护航驱逐舰进行（历史原型应该是“费城实验”）。但在实验中，这支舰队却突然被传送到一个未知区域，虽然很快就又回复原位，但后来却发现有多名船员消失——玩家就是其中一位。”[/spoiler]——引用知乎作者“李先羽”的部分内容。

游戏为第一人称，也可以切换成第三人称（不推荐）。玩法和大多数生存冒险类的游戏相似，在岛上收集材料资源，逐步发掘背景故事，关闭岛上的19座特斯拉电塔[spoiler]（如果提前查攻略的话可以直接到中心岛关闭最终的电塔，不过那样做会让游戏非常无聊）[/spoiler]，最终达成结局（温馨提示：笔记本中获得的电塔密码并不对应获得地点的那一座，需要根据地图环境自己判断）。或者你也可以把它当成一个纯粹的生存类游戏，除了一些基本的生活工具以外，游戏中还可以制造一些建筑[strike]（虽然对于游戏本身来说没什么用处）[/strike]。

当真正进入状态后，会发现游戏的故事还是较为引人入胜的。从我找到第一本笔记开始入迷了，在岛上挖掘背后的故事。有恐怖元素，但也上瘾，让人想继续探索下去。军事基地，辐射云，墓地，巨型僵尸等等都会为辐射岛蒙上一丝神秘的味道。基本上所有需要的信息都可以通过游戏中发现的笔记得到，不过当收集完全部笔记本之后，它也没什么用了。如果你专心解密剧情而不是生存，流程不会太长，大概10-20小时，尤其是在结合攻略的情况下，但会少很多乐趣，建议先自己探索。

游戏是手机移植，个人感觉质量对得起这个价格的，推荐打折入手。",1656363694,1656423640,True,5,0,0.57952570915222168,1,True,False,False,False,,,

A week ago at the time of writing I discovered that it was on Steam! After 14 Hours I have to say I really liked this game and I want to voice out what I liked about it and what I think it was missing:

-------

PROS:
THE STORY - The story is very interesting! You start out as a man on a ship that is rumored to be the USS Eldridge from the Philidelphia Experiment urban legend, and you are the only one that escaped alive as it teleports back in time and to an alternate reality. You find yourself on an island dubbed ""Radiation Island"" in control of the Japanese Imperial Army in the middle of World War 2. In this reality, the Japanese Imperial Army was developing and testing Teleportation technology in the form of Tesla Towers but soon find out that the same towers were mutating the inhabitants of the island into aggressive and violent monsters.

BASE CONSTRUCTION - I like the idea of building your own base to survive in and this mechanic of building specifically reminds me heavily of the game ""Rust"". The ability to create your own base however you want brings a lot of possibilities and ideas.

ENEMY DESIGN - The enemies are what I think are the spotlight of this game; contorted and mutated enemies which seem human but at the same time... aren't. From civilians decayed to a hollow husk from radiation, to fast Japanese soldiers turned insane wielding Katanas, to horrific Hazmat doctors with giant syringes filled with infectious fluid that try to inject you, the design of these abominations is astounding. Being chased by a horde of mutated soldiers with samurai swords hellbent on slicing you to ribbons is genuinely terrifying.

-------

CONS:

ENEMY VARIETY - One of the only problems I have with this game is the fact that after you meet the 4 main mutant enemies the only mutants you find after that are just resized or recolored versions of them such as the basic Peasant zombies rescaled 7 times as large and being able to one-shot you even with the highest armor levels, or the Doctor mutants being recolored red being able to tank 2x the bullets.

REPETITIVE - The goal of disabling all the Tesla Towers on each of the 3 main islands to the 4th final island can be very tedious or boring at times since each of the 3 main islands are just the same design copied and pasted 3 times; the islands have no change in landscape as far as the layout goes besides where transit locations and where the Tesla Towers are.

--------

CONCLUSION:

Honestly I did enjoy this game but I did have a few complaints about it. I liked the Story, the Enemy Design, and the Building Mechanics, but I have some distaste for the Enemy Variety and the fact some parts are Repetitive. I do however want to see either a sequel or a remake of this game as it could really use an expansion to the story and an overhaul to the graphics.",1653625781,1653625863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

如果有一定的游戏经验，但发育迟缓，可以看以下快速无限水晶攻略：（大佬就不必了）

出生，面朝大海，去左边的渔村找弓箭或者矛，然后翻过出生点右侧的墙打鳄鱼，获得鳄鱼皮，做成船，然后下海向右边划。先划到那个沿海的中转站，有个巨石阵和传送门（埋下伏笔），解锁一下。然后继续，一直划到地图右上角的月牙形小岛。那里有沉船，沉船里有步枪和机枪，还有一些步枪子弹，足够撑到获得无限水晶了。拿到枪和子弹后，回到巨石阵的中转站（记得拿上船），走进传送门，会被传送到一岛最高的山。那里有滑翔伞，坐上，让滑翔机头始终冲向通向中岛的桥，一直飞。注意会寒冷、饥饿，上飞机的动作要快。飞到桥边后，解锁一个中转站，走上桥去中岛。到了以后，直接开始划船，离岸边远一点，因为中岛的僵尸很多。一直划到右上角的岛（二岛），解锁中转站，上桥，去二岛。到了以后会遇到满脸的僵尸，不要怕，它们移动很慢。偶尔遇见一两个拿刀的僵尸跑得快，用步枪干掉。快速脱身，不要恋战，下桥往右边走，下水划船。地图最右上角的月牙形小岛有个中转站，那是我们的目标。因为二岛难度很大，所以尽量一直划船，中途遇见几个岸边的中转站可以解锁一下。一直划到右上角的小岛和中转站，就到了世外桃源。没有任何敌对生物，还有无限水晶。岛上具体有什么，这里留个悬念，反正很精彩。还有留意一下被岛围住的湖的底部，会有惊喜。中转站里有晶体转换炉，想要什么就有什么，不用怕任何的僵尸了，很快乐。

   以辐射形式展开的一个岛群。3座岛以及中间一座小岛。岛上有兔，羊，狼，熊，虎，狮和鳄鱼。敌人除了动物，还有类似丧尸一样的玩意。
    大致背景就是，日本在二战搞了个比美国费城实验还要规模庞大的电磁实验，想转移一座群岛并漂浮在东京上空，结果，实验失败了，岛屿转移到了陌生的区域，似乎已经不在地球了。岛上会随机出现结晶物质--一种水晶，可以转换成任何物质。嗯，很神奇的东西。随后，军队和居民开始异变，岛上也出现了诡异的现象。只有一个人活了下来，并且发现自己无法死去。现在，他要去关闭所有实验设备。
    游戏就是需要关闭3座岛上的仪器以及中间岛屿的机器。
    岛屿挺大的，中转站之间可以转移，方便跑图，唯一的交通工具只有独木舟和滑翔翼。文件中提到过，电磁仪器会损坏所有现代交通工具。
    后期有机枪后，就会非常轻松，但某些地方，变异敌人非常多。注意选择非探索模式时，注意屯枪，尤其是机枪，死的时候，手上的机枪必没。
    我只打完了一座岛（我关闭了岛上所有仪器，并挖出了所有埋藏点，关于这个，我只是想看看埋藏点会不会有些新奇东西，结果没有），就没打了，后期太重复了，容易枯燥。

This game has such a strong charm to it honestly, I don't know why I love this game but I really do. This is my second time playing the game, I first played it on my switch a few months ago and decided to buy it again on steam so I could play it on PC and support the devs. The actual graphics aren't that great, and in areas with lots of enemies it lagged on my computer a bit (though my computer isn't that powerful). I think I love the game because the colours just really pop, vibrant greens against really powerful blues. Even just dirt areas are still brightly coloured. There are also a bunch of great looking weather effects, I always like when it rains or gets foggy, and when the sun comes back I appreciate the bright colours even more.

The plot for this game is very simple, a military experiment went wrong and turned everyone on this island into monsters and zombies. I think that's all it really needed to be, and I like how it's told with short simple notes with illustrations you find around the map. I like how there's just a book item, and each one you pick up unlocks the next bit of the story, so you don't need to explore every corner of the map to get the story, I don't like when open world games have collectible documents telling the story but they're all scattered across the map and it's really hard to find them all.

I think the okay graphics and small plot really just show how much gameplay matters, because this is by far my favourite open world game I've ever played. The actual map size isn't that big, with enough fast travel points to make getting around not much of an issue, but not so many that the game becomes overly easy and generous. The game's pacing is great because you're never more than like a minute or two away from your next objective, so the open world doesn't feel annoying as much as it makes the game world feel more real. Even though the game world wasn't annoyingly big, I still thought it had a great sense of scale and size. I love how when you sleep or die there's like a shot of the island that rises up from where you are. There are also some views in the game that are just great, especially on top of the huge mountains. The change over time of your gameplay of the game is really great. You start out slowly crafting basic items and setting up a home base you can always return to, and you barely have any good weapons at all, and even a single zombie can kill you, but as the game goes on you find better and better weapons, and guns, and more ammo, and by the end of the game you have more resources than you'd ever need and the whole crafting aspect of the game kinda goes away because you're just so powerful. Even in this relatively short game the change in gameplay as you play is great. 

I love how simple the main objectives are too, basically you find notes around the game which give you de-activation codes for all the bases in the game. You just need to get into the base, type in the code and pick up the next code. It's very simple but still fun. I like how when you pick up the code it doesn't add an objective marker to your map, and you just need to find the base it's referring to by comparing the note with your in game map. You know in any AAA game you'd just get a marker popping up on your screen telling you where to go next.

On paper this is an incredibly generic open world survival game, but there's something about it that I really really love. I'd say, check it out! It's a lot of fun.",1623223830,1623223995,True,3,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Surreal nature. I cannot tell you how many times I've just stopped to look at the nature and listen to the Ambience.

В один момент я вообще прифигел когда увидел РАДУГУ после дождя. Просто понимаете, то ощущение когда игра выглядит просто и ты думаешь: ну вряд-ли она меня чем-то увидит. Но, когда ты замечаешь такие мелочи получаешь неимоверный кайф. Я сделал кучу скринов пока играл. Не смотря на графику в этой игре очень часто встречаются прекрасные виды на: горы, поля, леса и тд. Так что в общем и целом я получил от графики только положительный эмоции. Тем более она пойдёт практически на любом ведре.
Геймплей:
В геймплее есть так же куча мелочей и нюансов (на них построена вся игра). Как например база нужна тебе чтобы никакая тварь тебя не достала (на первом острове на твою базу ещё и нападают. Я вообще удивился от этого). Есть достаточно обширный, но в тоже время простой крафт. Тут тебе электрические посохи, винтовки, автоматы, пистолеты. Чего только тут нет. Причём вернёмся опять к строительству базы. Тебе не обязательно делать всё с нуля. Я вот например нашёл дерёвню на воде и спокойно обустроился в одном из домиков. Тем более, ты можешь спокойно сломать стенку, дверь на своей базе и они выпадут тебе обратно (есть особые экземпляры среди выживалок где твои постройки не дропаются). Так же у ГГ естественно есть голод... Пфф, какая же выживалка тогда выходит без голода? Разве что жажды не хватает. Единственная моя придирка это то, что ГГ прожорливый до невозможности. Благо игра и без того щедро засыпает ваши карманы различными вкусностями. Помимо сбора ресурсов в игре есть ещё и охота. Можно ставить ловушки чтобы поймать зайца или рыбачить например. Ещё мне понравилось, что живность тут действительно живность. Ладно там какой нибудь волк замочит овцу, но когда ты наблюдаешь как зомби бегает за зайцем дабы утолить свой голод это... Очень круто. Так же тут есть переломы, кровотечение (разной степени), заражение и радиация. Как я говорил игра с виду кажется довольно простой, но нифига.
Сюжет:
Сюжет здесь не замысловат. Главный герой попадает в параллельный мир, а именно на остров, находящийся в недалёком будущем. И с этого момента и начинаются наши приключения. В игре всего имеется 3 острова (центральный я не беру в счёт) где нам и предстоит оффнуть все башни дабы вернуться обратно домой. На каждом из островов нам предстоит лутаться в различных строениях и искать записки с кодами от башен. И вот он первый минус... Три, острова, подряд, одного и того же. Да они ещё и одинаковые - скажите вы. По ландшафту - да. Они идентичны, но по геймплею и своей наполненности они совершенно разные. Да и тем более, тут каждая деталь в игре сюжетно обоснована в записках. Даже смерти главного героя здесь кое-как обоснованы.. Да-да. И в общем отключаем мы все башни на 3-х островах, а после идём на центральный остров и вырубаем последнюю. Как вы поняли сюжет не пытается ставить какие-то рояли в кустах и делать неожиданные повороты. Большая часть в игре уделена именно исследованию и выживанию. Как например в той же сабнаутике или stranded deep. А ничего большего и нужно от выживалки.
Саундтрек и атмосфера:
Почему я из двух пунктов сделал один? Всё просто, эта игра вкупе с музыкой создаёт просто невероятную атмосферу. Я иногда просто мог сидеть смотря на закат и слушая (без сарказма) просто очишуенный эмбиент. Саундтрек в игре создаёт просто невероятную атмосферу мрака, таинственности и неизведанности. Весь саундтрек в игре мне дико понравился. Вот умеют же люди делать! Респект :)

Так же хочу отметить, что в игре после её прохождения станет доступен мультиплеер. Но его к сожалению я так и не опробовал :(

Итог: в игре миллионы и миллиарды мелочей от которых, ты постоянно кайфуешь. Возможно я ещё что-то не упомянул в своём обзоре, но в целом я рассказал про всё. На данный момент это моя одна из самых любимых выживалок. Максимум я могу снизить 1 балл за небольшие технические неполадки.

    游戏整体内容还算丰富，地图不小，可以合成的物品也比较多，采集食物、各种原料维持生存和制造武器弹药保护自己很有乐趣。探索地图的时候时不时也有“惊”“喜”出现。第一次看见巨型僵尸吓了我一跳，还被堵在了安全屋里，害怕一出去就被拍死。第一次挖到步枪高兴了我半天。做个滑翔伞飞到远离海岸的船上探索，前期带着比较低端的武器没什么弹药去僵尸多的地方摸鱼，后期制作了一大堆子弹带着机枪正面刚僵尸，反正玩得很开心。剧情就比较惨了，主角估计一辈子都要在这孤独终老了。
    打完这个游戏很久之后无聊的我无意间去了辐射岛的贴吧，发现里面的小伙伴玩出的花样不少。有的建了空中走廊，有的建了“空中花园”，还有的建了个滑梯，从高处滑下来，简直玩成了过山车之星。
    总之，玩过很多生存大作的人可能觉得这个游戏体量太小。没办法，毕竟手机移植的。但是刚玩生存沙盒生存冒险游戏的玩家我还是比较推荐的。第一，价格不贵。第二，上手不难。东西不会多到让你眼花缭乱无从下手的地步，又不会让你觉得太少。地图也不是特别大。只要你玩过FPS游戏，这个游戏对你来说就没有上手难度。",1582481137,1582481137,True,6,1,0.550408720970153809,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Don't go into it expecting a perfect game, prob far from perfect. I think this was a mobile game? Looks like 1. 
Pros:
Zombie/Survival
A lot of loot to collect
Crafting

And now, this is what you will expect that you'll notice in game

Cons:
When you build, you have your foundations, there's a gap/indent between the next foundation you place so you'll be running through an ugly dip, same for the walls, there's a gap between next wall placement where you can walk through so I'm assuming when you build, your house should just be 1 foundation.

Rain actually goes through buildings and you see it inside. 

Enemies/animals are clunky, the AI pathing is bad, they get stuck, samurai zombies run like flash.

When you're running and you loot something off the ground, you can't move for a few seconds sometimes which is annoying when you have something chasing you.

Not sure I enjoy the fact you get enemies that can spawn right next to you

You won't get a sign that it's getting dark, it goes from light to pitch black in 2 seconds and it makes it very difficult to see anything, and then the moonlight fluctuates.

Cooking is actually done in a furnace but when your stack of food is above 17/18 it starts spitting food everywhere. 

The map was a little confusing at first, there's a sort of arrow that shows on the map, and I got lost very easy, only realised that it's a line of sight cone.

Баланс в игре полностью отсутствует как класс, на тебя  налетают отовсюду буквально ""стаи визжащих из леса"", управление устроено так, что чтобы подлечиться нужно лезть в инвентарь, при этом игра не останавливается ни на секунду и десяток инфецированных самураев ,  продолжают тебя рубить катанами от души и с огоньком, при этом хищники в количестве от двух до пяти штук нападают вместе с самураями, зомбями и ещё какими-то придурками, друг на друга они внимания не обращают совершенно, только на вас). Ах, да, если они вас завалят, а они вас обязательно завалят, то оружие, что было в момент смерти у вас в руках исчезнет и останется какое-то время лежать на том месте, где вас грохнули, отбивать его придётся так же. Одежда тоже периодически куда-то ""исчезает"", может мародёры с трупа снимают. Ресурсов на втором острове, кроме оружия и патронов почти нет, всё нужно везти сюда заранее.

von 2016. Eigentlich ein überlebens Abenteuer in einer offenen Welt.
Als Mitarbeiter am Philadelphia-Experiment bist du in einem Paralleluniversum gestrandet, zumindest zeigt das, das Intro Video das gar nicht schlecht gemacht ist.
Die Grafik ist nicht schlecht aber sie ist auch nicht gut.... Dies ist das allgemeine Problem bei diesem Spiel, alles ist nicht wirklich gut aber nix ist wirklich schlecht.
Zum Anfang ist das mit der Ausrüstung eher gewöhnungsbedürftig mit der Zeit wird es aber besser, mann muß erstmal dahinter kommen wie was in diesem Spiel hergestellt wird und was man wofür woraus machen kann. Insgesamt könnte es umfangreicher sein da es doch nicht gerade viele Sachen zum Herstellen gibt.
Anmerkung: das Bau Menü habe ich nicht genutzt da ich nur 4h gespielt habe... jedoch habe ich mich umgehört und kann euch berichten das einige Bauteile nicht so recht mit dem Untergrund zusammen passen und einige Teile auch nur schwer zusammen zu fügen sind.
Ihr werdet wohl selbst herausfinden müssen wie das mit den bösen Leuten auf dieser Insel ist, will euch ja nicht den letzten Rest Spannung nehmen, nur soviel dazu....
Diskutieren könnt ihr nicht mit ihnen.
So was wie eine Atmosphäre oder Aura die dich im Spiel umgibt fehlt leider völlig, wenn man die nervige Musik mal außer acht lässt.
Landschaftlich gesehen eignet es sich ganz gut als Walking Simulator, für diejenigen unter euch sage ich, ganz Ok, vor allem weil es günstig ist vom Preis her.
Dieses Foto habe ich beigefügt

um euch besser sagen zu können wie das so ist mit dem Nahrungsverbrauch... Einmal Turm hoch durch alle leeren Räume in einige Kisten geschaut und wieder runter.... Macht zusammen 2x Essen da ihr schon die hälfte euer hunger Anzeige verbraucht habt. Mit anderen Worten, ihr seit gezwungen ständig auf Nahrungssuche zu sein und alle paar Minuten zu essen.....
Wem soll das gefallen? mir nicht....
So ist auch meine Bewertung, eher schlecht....
Da das Spiel nicht mehr im Entwicklungsstadium ist und auch sonst sich keiner mehr darum kümmert wie es scheint rate ich eindeutig vom Kauf ab. Insbesondere da die Entwickler den PC Port aufgegeben haben. Ursprünglich hatte ich den Daumen nach oben weil es verschiedene Startmöglichkeiten hat. Aber nachdem ich mir stundenlang Live Übertragungen angesehen habe musste ich meine Entscheidung überdenken. Außer für einige wenige Spieler ein klares NEIN, Nicht Kaufen.

[h1]Radiation Island[/h1]
from 2016. Actually a survival adventure in an open world.
As a member of the Philadelphia Experiment, you're stranded in a parallel universe, at least that shows the intro video that's not bad at all.
The graphics are not bad but they are not good either .... This is the general problem with this game, everything is not really good but nothing is really bad.
In the beginning it takes some getting used to with the equipment, but with time it gets better, you have to figure out what you make in this game and what you can do with what. Overall, it could be more extensive because there are not many things to produce.
Note: I did not use the build menu because I only played for 4 hours ... but I listened and I can tell you that some components are not quite compatible with the ground and some parts are difficult to put together.
You will probably have to find out for yourself how it is with the bad people on this island, you do not want to take the last bit of tension, just so much .... You can not discuss with them.
Something like an atmosphere or aura that surrounds you in the game is missing completely, if you forget the annoying music.
Scenically, it is quite suitable as a walking simulator, for those of you I say, all right, especially because it is cheap from the price.
I attached this picture

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1848709238

to tell you more about how it is with the consumption of food ... Once tower looked up through all the empty spaces in some boxes and back down .... Makes 2x food together since you have already consumed half of your hunger display. In other words, you have been forced to constantly foraging and eating every few minutes .....
Who would like that? not me....
So is my rating, rather bad ....
Since the game is no longer in the development stage and no one else cares about it as it seems, I clearly advise against the purchase. Especially since the developers have given up the PC port. Originally I had the thumbs up because it has different starting possibilities. But after watching live broadcasts for hours, I had to rethink my decision.
Except for a few players a clear NO, not buying.

It has a lot of good mechanics, and survival tactics. The graphics are actually pretty good as well. Though, the AI could be better. Instead of having to be spotted by enemies, they come after you if you're within a certain radius of them, even if there's a small mountain between you and the enemy with no possible way it could see you.

It showed up in my discovery que one day, and I thought, ""Radiation Island?  That's kind of a lame name...."" but the trailer looked fun enough; kind of like playing in a B-rated horror movie.  I wishlisted it, and some time later it went on sale, so I picked it up.

I thought, ""I'll just try this out for a while.....""  3 hours later, I was still ""trying it out.""  The first day (in real life) of playing the game, I was just getting a feel for how things went.  The second day, I thought I had it under control pretty well.  The third, I completed the first third of the game, and advanced to the next island.  But on that fourth day, I realized how much harder things got after you left the relative safety of the place where you start.  I had to change my tactics a little, and became aware of how very, very valuable hang-gliders are.

I never got much into base building, because the transit points around the map were quite sufficient for what I needed.  It's nice to know that you can build your own house, if you wanted, but the game seems to attempt to spur you to moving on to the next part, and completing the main objective.

This isn't exactly a 5-star game, but for being developed by an indie team, I think they did a pretty good job.  The game does get a little repetitive, but it feels like you're actually a dude stranded on an island that you didn't want to be on.  There isn't much point to just exploring after you get a machine gun and all the stuff you need to make ammunition, but the game retains is feeling of fun all the way to the end.  Fighting one or two, even three monsters at once isn't really that much of a problem, but eventually you are put in situations where you realize you're ultimately fighting a war of attrition.  In many occasions, it's just more profitable to run.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for about a week or so of fun, surprisingly relaxing yet engaging survival crafting.  If it goes on sale at all, it's certainly worth it.",1562461108,1562461108,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,,,

-The building mechanics are simple
-The animal's behaviors are realistic
-There is a good variety of animals and zombies
-The highest difficulty can be very hard and challenging (which is good )

There are some negative points too though

-The zombies move faster than there legs would permit and you cannot outrun them. This makes the game more challenging but also more frustrating so that's not a good thing.

-There are a few bugs who can make the game frustrating at times. One of them is that when you die, the stuff that gets dropped to the ground will disapear if you die a second time. This gets really annoying quickly because lets face it : you gonna die a lot in this game.

*** SPOILER ALERT***

-Once you get through the first island of the game, there are two other identical islands. Although they are not really identical and contains different challenges and different versions of the enemies you've encountered before, it feels like you are replaying the first one over again. You get the feeling that the developpers wanted to extend the game's length without really adding anything new to the game.

Portage du jeu mobile du même nom, les graphismes en souffrent et sont malheureusement très moyens, tandis que la bande son, plutôt insipide, est très répétitive. La jouabilité, au clavier et à la souris, est un peu archaïque mais correcte, avec des contrôles simples et intuitifs, et qui peuvent être modifiés via le menu des options ; j’ai également essayé à la manette mais je trouve que ce n’est pas l’idéal pour ce jeu. A noter qu’il est possible de passer d’une vue à la première personne à une vue à la troisième personne en appuyant simplement sur un bouton. Concernant le scénario, assez classique, il faut trouver les notes du journal d’un survivant, afin de connaitre l’histoire de l’archipel ainsi que les objectifs à accomplir pour terminer le jeu. Trois niveaux de difficulté (facile, normal et difficile) sont disponibles, et je vais maintenant parler de mon expérience en mode normal.

Le système d’artisanat est simple et assez diversifié, même si une fois un camp établi et une mitrailleuse trouvée, on se contentera de fabriquer des munitions, agrandir son sac à dos, et éventuellement fabriquer des vêtements de protection. En effet, le jeu n’est pas avare en ressources, en équipements et en fournitures médicales ; à noter que la carte est rechargée en ressources à chaque connexion, et parfois même les coffres que vous avez déjà fouillé sont rechargés, ce qui est un peu surprenant. De même, la nourriture se trouve abondamment, sachant qu’il est possible de chasser et de pêcher, ainsi que de cuisiner pour obtenir des aliments de meilleure valeur nutritive. La principale menace à votre survie viendra des différents ennemis, dans un premier temps les animaux sauvages (loups, ours, crocodiles et pumas) qui sont peu nombreux à un même endroit (maximum trois ou quatre individus) et qui ne se mélangent pas (pas d’ours se baladant avec des loups, ce n’est pas le livre de la jungle), puis dans un deuxième temps les zombies (zombies simples, paysans, soldats, prisonniers et scientifiques) qui peuvent se trouver en assez grande quantité à un même endroit et qui se mélangent entre eux ; à noter qu’on peut rencontrer des zombies géants et des loups cracheurs de projectiles, ce qui est assez ridicule. Suivant l’ennemi rencontré, vous pouvez, outre vous faire tuer, être frappé d’une condition handicapante : saignement, fracture, infection ; à chaque condition, son remède, qu’on peut soit trouver en explorant, soit fabriquer. Il y a également les radiations, dont il faudra se protéger avec une tenue spéciale qui recouvre vos vêtements, ces tenues se trouvant assez facilement en explorant. Si vous mourrez, vous réapparaitrez à un point de passage proche, qui sont assez nombreux et facilitent l’exploration ainsi que l’accomplissement des objectifs. Le jeu propose également un cycle jour/nuit, avec plus de dangers la nuit, comme l’obscurité ou le froid, et il est possible de passer de la nuit au jour en dormant dans un lit, qu’on peut fabriquer ou trouver dans un point de passage. Malheureusement, l’intérêt de l’exploration devient assez vite limité et on se contentera d’aller d’objectif en objectif, jusqu’à la fin du jeu.

Avec une durée de vie d’environ quinze heures en mode normal, Radiation Island propose une petite expérience de survie plutôt correcte, et ce malgré quelques points négatifs, notamment le scénario qui aurait gagné à être plus fourni en utilisant mieux l’exploration des différents lieux de l’archipel. A noter la présence de quelques bugs, pouvant être plus ou moins frustrant.

元がスマホゲーということは他の方のレビューを読んで初めて知ったくらい、廃墟フェチ殺しの素敵な世界観が楽しめた。
逆にサバイバル要素は最高難易度でもその辺に落ちているパイナップルを拾い食いできたり、対放射能用のアイテムをゾンビがボロボロ落としたりで拍子抜けする物だった。
また、このゲームの戦闘は敵が近接攻撃モーションに入ったらそのあとで回避しても当たる仕様らしく、近接武器の威力が非常に低いこともあって遠距離から射撃するほかに有効な手立てがない。
弾丸はわりと簡単に量産できるので、ピストルやマシンガンを拾ったら戦闘は卒業と考えてしまって構わないだろう。
ゲームの舞台として3+1つの島があるが全域で入手できるアイテムに差は無いので、始めの島の途中で卒業ということになってしまうだろうが・・・。

ので、いっそ最低難易度で廃墟探訪ゲームくらいの気持ちで取り組んで癒されてはどうだろうか。

Is it bad? Yes and no. It's got potential, but the enemies are just...not good. The animals behave in weird ways. Bears loop between charging you and running away so long as you don't get too close to them. Wolves charge at you and then switch to a slow prowl just before they reach you. Alligators are a mess; their swim animation just looks like they're floating away, they're slow on land, and they can't seem to climb even the slightest slope. And then there's the zombies, who are actually quite scary because they are really fast but they run around like crazy people in unpredictable patterns (it's pretty terrifying). They only attack if their seemingly random frolicking brings you into their range, but it's really hard to hit them due to their erratic patterns.

I haven't played very much, but the AI in the game is weak. Aside from the zombies, everything is pretty easy to kill, though I haven't got up the courage yet to try the mountain lions.

Si no tienes un ordenador puntero, incluso lo podrás jugar. A mí se me laguea mucho el Rust, incluso a veces se apaga, pero puedo jugar a este sin problemas.

Pros:
- No se necesita un ordenador puntero.
- Supervivencia con historia.
- Se puede poner tanto en primera como en tercera persona.
- Tiene su punto justo de dificultad.
- Tiene cosas secundarias, como cavar para encontrarte munición y cosas de interés

Contras:
- Tiene bugs, muchos. En la montaña, a una distancia entre, por ejemplo, la tierra y el suelo de la casucha, hay veces que me ha matado sin motivo alguno. Eso por no decir que había enemigos que se teletransportaban (cuando no tenían por qué)
- Se supone que es un juego con historia. La historia te la encuentras en notitas, solo hay que apagar torres. Un poco pobre para ser para un jugador. A veces, incluso tienes que suponer lo que hacer a continuación, se pierde mucho con que te dejen la historia como un ""supón lo próximo que tienes que hacer"".
- Para un jugador hasta que te pasas el juego, que ya no tiene más misterio, juntado con que no hay comunidad para multijugador con este juego.
- Dificultad al principio para obtener munición, cuando mucho más tarde, los zombies te la regalan. Tanto tiempo para que después no me cabe la munición en el inventario.
- Creación de casas nefasta... se dejan huecos y tienes que construir paredes en los huecos, aunque qué le vamos a pedir a un single player...

En resumen, y a pesar de los contras... si no puedes jugar ni al Rust ni al Ark ni al 7 Days to Die... este juego te puede ""quitar el gusanillo.... las 23 horas reales que le he metido al juego jajajaja. Increíble, pero sí, lo recomendaría.

This is not a bad game, far from it, it's actually quite good for it's genre.The thing you need to know going in is that this IS a port of a mobile survival game for iPhones, but at that it is almost certainly one of the best ones you could possibly get. 
That being said, it will come with all of the typical janky bugs and odd design choices you can expect from that. 
It IS fun, it is an interesting world to explore and survive, and it is DEFINITELY worth $5. 

The gameplay is rather solid, albeit clearly designed for mobile phones the port work is solid. 
Radiation Island also has remarkably good graphics for a low budget survival title, a solid story and decent balance. It can actually be rather scary, and there will be situations you might decide to avoid outright because you can't handle them yet. The atmosphere feels unreal, with odd soundscapes, a tropical island that gives way to deserted military bases and small towns. 
It's just that I wasn't very engaged with it for a while. If you've played a lot of early access survival games you will know what to expect, janky animations, a large amount of the game being traversing similarily textured hills and woods, if you are alright with that, this is the game for you. 

I am not that person though, and although I may return to buy it again later, it's just not for me.

tl;dr It's a port of a mobile survival game, but probably the best it could be considering that. 

Thank you, Atypical Games for granting my refund request, I did enjoy Radiation island, but atm I would rather spend that $3 on something else. You did a great job.",1518977384,1518977384,True,15,2,0.608641982078552246,0,True,False,False,False,,,

For the price it is an unpolished gem.
Runs smoothly on a low end PC while still looking ok.
Crafting and survival is surprisingly entertaining.
I found two main issues that bother me so far:
- AI pathfinding 
   It is pretty sketchy, mobs get stuck easily. It is ok with zombies, they are not too smart, but wolves shouldn't get stuck trying to get around a skinny treetrunk :P
- The rain 
   It rains *inside* buildings too. Come on people. While this is not a gamebreaker, this bothers the hell outta me, ruins the feel of looking for shelter from the elements totally. 

Still, worth piddling with, see where the story mode takes me.

-------- EDIT --------

Initially gave it a 7/10, Gonna knock it down to 3/10.

- the mobs are horrendously clunky
- the samurai sword zombie is running up and down at the speed of a car, more annoying than challenging
- some crafting ideas are silly beyond bearable, like being able to manufacture centerfire brass cased ammo from lead, sulfur and charcoal with your bare hands, etc.
- obviously ported from touchscreen platforms, rifle aiming is doofus.
- coulda come up with decent icons for ""titanium"" tools (you smelt titanium in a rock stove :P ), instead of just tinting the stone ones blue.

There are a lot other shortcomings too that I'm not going to list, the creators are obviously not communicating with the players. 
This game is not as advertised.

PROs are low price and low spec HW, still I'm gonna try to get a refund.

フィラデルフィア計画を題材にしたサバイバルアドベンチャー、ストーリーに関してはゲーム内のジャーナルを集めることでなんとなくわかる、フィラデルフィア計画の実験で島に飛ばされた主人公がなんとか脱出というか帰るために奮闘するゲーム。

島は4つほどあり、各地にあるテスラタワーと呼ばれる場所をオフにしていくのが目的、タワーをオフにする為の暗証番号などもあるので島を探索しジャーナル(メモかな？)を集めるとその中にタワーの暗証番号が書いてある物があるのでそれを元にタワーを攻略していくことになる。

サバイバル要素に関しては昼夜、夜には寒さもある、島の放射線、腹減り、クラフト、素材集め、狩り、戦闘、バッドステータスなど、サバイバルに必要な要素は大抵備わっている、サバイバルゲームの入門的に良さげな所は重力が無いのでスタックできるだけ持てる、資材集めが基本楽、腹は減るが喉は乾かないので食料だけでいい、食料に関してもある程度慣れてくると肉など腐るほど手に入る、人型の敵が回復や装備をかなりドロップするなどが挙げられる。

チュートリアルが終わると難易度選択が現れ、一番優しいのだと敵が襲ってこない(このモードはやる必要があるのか？)、ノーマルは普通に肉食獣や化け物は襲ってきます、死んだら装備してた武器だけ落とす(自分はこれでした)、ハードは資源が少ない、死んだら全アイテムをロスト(死んだ場所にばらまくだと思う)の3種類で途中で変更できないみたいなので注意しよう。

基本的にはサバイバルゲームの入門には最適だが、一部鬼畜な所もあるので書いておこう、基本敵の半数が主人公(ザク)より3倍速い(赤ザクである)、人型、肉食獣、大体群れてる、装備が無い状態で熊とかライオンとか３～4匹に襲われると速攻で死にます人型も同じ、ガン逃げしても3倍速いので死にます、敵の探知能力がパナイすげぇ遠くから3倍の速さで襲ってきます、テスラ付近には人型の敵が多くいるのだが中には数十体とかいる場所もあり、放射線もある、ついでに装備などもとける場所と合体してある所があり酷い、ある程度装備がそろっているとダメージの大半をカットできるが無いと速攻で死ぬのでｗ他の島には巨大な敵なども出てきて微妙な装備だと速攻で死にます、木をなぎ倒しながら襲ってくるしかも速さも3倍なんでｗ

[h1] 個人的に思った事や感想 [/h1]

セールなら100円位、定価で買っても損はしないです、自分の場合10時間過ぎるまで中間ポイントに飛べれる事が分からずに延々と歩いてた、序盤は本当に楽しく探索しながらジャーナルを集め、タワー攻略だったが、中盤以降はマシンガンの弾だけを製造マンになっていた、銃火器はクラフトできないが中盤から腐るほど見つかるし弾は作る事ができる、マップのバツ印はシャベルで掘ると宝出てきますよ、後半近くまで何なのこのマークと思ってたｗなんだかんだでとても楽しくプレイさせてもらいました。

追伸　マップにめぼしい所は最初から書き込んであるのでその辺も初心者向けですね。

Bad controls, bad menu navigations, takes the excitement away quickly. I wanted to know more what the story and the rest of the world could offer, but the damn contols really killed it for me.

There is a reason why this game is so cheap. The positive reviewers are most likely either paid or kindly asked for their reviews.

There is a story in this game, but I could not focus enough on it to figure much out as I was constantly getting frustrated and confused by the controls and mechanics of the game. You have to press spesific keys to open spesific pages. You cannot do stuff quickly unless you play for a number of hours and get used to the keys. Where is the good old ""tab"" key that opens up a menu where you can select between inventory, crafting menu, etc.?

Controls are terrible. You can often find yourself falling from an edge because your character decided to slide over the rusty metal floor for some reason. Don't even try to jump in a creative way.

So far I have seen reviews stating that the enemies pose threats. - I have spent couple of nights outside in the forest, killed wolves (1 arrow for each) and killed a bear (3 arrows), while I only took damage from the bear, which I did not even have to do anything about. So, yeah. Real stuff.

(A sheep dropped a chicken leg)

Well it might be too late to tell the developers to fix the controls, but if you can kindly fix the controls, I would definetly recommend this game, at least for its exploration purposes.",1514941793,1514941793,False,6,2,0.464899688959121704,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Презрев все законы физики перс и монстры резво несутся по почти вертикальным поверхностям. Так вы узнаете, в кого переродились в следующей жизни коники Скайрима.
Проваливание в текстуры не баг, а часть боевой механики мобов. В вашу же пользу играет их застревание в текстурах, АХАХА, разберемся же один на один, мой кулак и твоя жопа.
Графика ненамного хуже чем в Elex, а смысл тот же: растительность и заброшки с разрушенными мебелями. Там в сундучках вы находите полезности и кусочки лора, в виде записок.
В игре меняется погода и виды недурны, особенно хороша ранняя ночь. Стремительно несутся по небу сверкающие звезды, так я преположила, что судя по вращению планеты, вряд ли дело происходит на Земле.

Единственная претензия к игре - саунд и звук. Кровь из ушей не идет только при мелодии на берегу. А вот все остальные треки вызывают просто дичайший бугурт, такие они бесячие, к счастью, музыку можно отключить в меню.
Но вот со звуками окружения уже сложнее, отключать их неразумно в игре на выживание.
Неважно, как далеко от вас волк: на расстоянии протянутой руки или в нескольких десятках метров, вы в любом случае будете слышать его однообразное рычание, не прекращающееся ни на секунду.

The game is actually difficult, military bases and tesla towers are fun to raid. 
The Digging for treasure feature is a nice touch. It is a great way to get items, probably the most efficient way.
The transit locations are a nice touch as it can be difficult to move around.
""Vehicles"" that naturally spawn such as gliders and boats are a good way of getting around. I have remembered some of the possitions of these objects to use it to my advantage.

《辐射岛》这款游戏极其考验玩家对于野外生存常识的了解，主要在于如何合理分配和利用现有资源，让自己获得最大效益。游戏不管是开放式玩法，还是美轮美奂的画面，抑或代入感极强的配乐，都让人耳目一新，不得不玩！所以游戏刚上架不久就获得佳绩和玩家疯狂追捧也是理所当然的事情。如果你喜欢生存类游戏，那么《辐射岛》一定是你不容错过的一款大作。",1508317269,1509534423,True,94,13,0.892340123653411865,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Time Played: Nearly 7 Hours
Skill Level: Master

BFYP: You have to complete the story before you can play the multiplayer.

Combat: The overall Combat is quite basic. That's until you dunk off and find yourself being chased by 4 bears with a slingshot and bow. Or a pack of wolves and an axe. or 30 zombies shooting at you with viruses and being chased by 7-8 soliders with 2 hit kill powers.  Even though it is not a 7DTD game, it sure feels like it. Always an enemy, wether man or beast, at least you have a machinegun. 3 hits to kill in hardmode. Not much  to hold off for until they are up you're arse crack. So either play serious when entering combat or die really fast,

Crafting: The crafting is easy as hell. I mean if you don't have medicine by day 5 your way behind, getting an iron shovel and guns is a different story completly. decide to build your house in a Transit zone so that you don't get it destroyed and you can have a crystal converter. Finding the right stuff on the other hand can be hard AF. 

Building: Not hard, really nice of you do it at a Transit so you can always travel there faster and use the converter. The idea of it is their base is too small and you can build it to huge proportions. It is easy to get materials sometimes. Other times not so true.

Story: Not like most games with shit cutscenes and boring none important animation, this has a solid expalantion for eveerything that is happening if you can take 5 hours to finding everything in the journal and taking it to the next level and getting to the center island and activating teloporter.

Enviroment: HUGE MAP, Well crafted mostly. I mean it is huge, and either you boat your way around and through or you use a hangglider and fly over it. Or you can be a loser and run. Your choice, But overall the whole place is well worth the way to play multiplayer...

MP: Have not got that far to unlock it.

Enemies: DON'T FUCK WITH THE BIG GUYS, THEY WILL RAPE THE FUCK OUT OF YOU. 

Overall: Don't get overwhelmed liek you are paying $3 for the best survival game ever. But it helps get your average acheivement score up and lets you see what a mobile port has to offer. I mean come the fuck on. It was before Rust and 7DTD even came out and you get a $3 version of it without loosing anything. It has trading cards and a huge map. Definetly worth the money.

ゲーム内容
何が起こったかわからないが、いつの間にかに知らない浜辺にいるプレーヤーキャラクターを操作して、事の真相を究明しつつ脱出を目指すサバイバルゲームのようなFP視点・・・OキーでTP視点にもできる・・・のゲーム。

基本はルート＆スカベンジで武器・防具・道具は多少クラフトできる、建物も多少クラフトできる、渇きはないが空腹はある。昼夜の概念がある。

序盤はクラフトで自分の装備を強化したりもするが、中盤以降はマシンガンの弾を作るだけになる。理由は下に書き出しておいた。序盤のお勧め武器は「槍」。投槍なのでかなりの本数を作る必要があるが、連射も利くし威力も高い。近接は当たり判定がクソ過ぎてうんざり。適正モブの「狼」の攻撃を食らう位置でこちらが刀を振っても当たらない。近接攻撃をするなら常にモブに密着することを要求される。

ステルスプレイはない。戦闘では常に正面から戦い、奇襲攻撃などは考える必要のない脳筋ゲーム。サバイバルゲームというよりはハクスラよりなモブの多さとリスポーン頻度もあいまってそうなっている。

夜間はかなり暗くなるので松明等を片手にプレイしたいところだが、手には一つしかアイテムを装備できないのでおとなしく眠って朝を待つのが良いだろう。


ゲームの舞台となる島は４つに分かれており、中央の島を同じ形をした３島が囲むような形になっている。一応、形が放射線系のハザードマークになっているのだと思う。だからといって核ではなくテスラ・・・大日本帝国軍が電磁波だか磁場だかの極秘実験を行っていた架空の島がゲームの舞台。中央の島へは指定の橋を使って渡ることになる。島の中の川や湖、もしくは離れ小島はカヌーで移動できる。・・・グライダーもあるが試したことはない・・・

また、トランジッションというチェックポイントを見つければ・・・地図上では家のマークで、見つけると別のマークに変化する・・・トランジッション間で高速移動が可能になる。高速移動はこの手のゲームでお馴染みのやり方で、敵が傍にいないときに地図の記号をクリックするだけ。それと、高速移動中は時間の流れはないようだ。トランジッションにはベッドも設えてあり、セーブポイントとしても機能する。ただしベッドが利用できるのは夜間のみ。それから、ベッドで眠ると最後に眠ったベッドの位置がプレーヤーキャラクター死亡時のリスポーンポイントとなる。

ストーリー上の目的は中央以外の各島にあるテスラタワー（各島６塔）をすべてオフラインにして、最後に中央の島のテスラタワー（１塔）もオフラインにすること。同じことを１９回やる。実は好きな順番で好きなように遊べない微妙さ加減。攻略にはテスラタワーをオフラインにする「暗証番号＆地図」が必要で、ある程度プレイしているとジャーナルの形で最初の暗証番号＆地図を見つけることができる。そしてそこに記載されているテスラタワーを攻略に向かうと、暗証番号入力装置の傍にジャーナルの形で次に攻略すべきテスラタワーの暗証番号と地図が落ちている。その次も、またその次も・・・と、そのような形で順番に攻略することを暗に求められる。好きな所からできなくもないが２度手間になるだけ。因みに暗証番号は６桁の数字なのであてずっぽうやすべての組み合わせを試す攻略法は通用しない。やってもいいが組み合わせ爆発が起きる。また、すべてのテスラタワーを攻略しなければならないとは作業であり、明らかにプレイ時間を水増ししたもので値段相応のつくりといえるだろう。ファークライ３などのようにストーリ上の攻略すべき敵の拠点とそれ以外の敵の拠点とはなっていない。


非力なPCでもそれなりの見栄えのするグラフィックで軽い＆地形は結構作りこまれているし、それなりに広い
少ない長所だが、無いよりはよい。むしろなければ困る。海沿いや、山間部に設けられた日本帝国軍の基地や農耕小作人の集落など、住み着いているのがゾンビだけだが、コピペにならないように見栄えのするように作られている。地形のポリゴンが荒かったり、雨が建物を貫通したり、敵性モブのアニメーションがいまいちだったりするが、テクスチャーはボケすぎることもなく綺麗。SHIFT押下でダッシュでき、スタミナの概念がなく走り放題で、かなりの急斜面も自在に登れるので移動の自由度が高く、観光目的で走り回るのが気持ちよい。


開発が途中放棄したであろう難易度のやっつけ調整＆難易度の調整が影響してあまり機能しないクラフト要素
この話をする前に少し覚えておいてもらいたいことを。クリスタルという名のアイテムがあり、ゾンビが持っていたり落ちていたりする。クリスタルは変換機というものを使うと様々な素材に変換できる。
１番目の島で最初の頃はそれなりに素材を集めて、自分の装備を強化することに楽しみを見出せるかもしれないが、ある程度プレイすると自分でクラフトするよりもルートやスカベンジで十分に性能の良いアイテムを得ることができることに気がつく。そして、２番目の島に入っての砂浜に落ちているリスポーンしまくる大量のクリスタルと最初のトランジッションの家の中に変換機が備わっていることを目にして気がつくはずだ、マシンガンの弾を大量に作ってトリガーハッピーなプレイを暗に匂わせていることを。また、難易度が急上昇するのが２番目の島で、「調整するのが面倒だからこれで乗り切れ」と開発が調整を放棄している様が目に浮かぶ。実際そのくらいじゃないとかなり面倒でやってられない。それで、そこまで来る間にマシンガンをルートかスカベンジで手に入れているはずなので、もうそれで十分。防具はもはや自分で作る必要もなく、ルートとスカベンジで問題なく揃えられる。攻撃は最大の防御である。実は１番目の島にも変換機はあるが、不便な場所にしかない。しかし２番目、３番目の島は全てのトランジッションの家に備え付けられている。

自分で家を立て、ベッドを施設することもできるが、高速移動の対象とはならないし、トランジッションがそれなりにいい位置に配置されているため趣味で建築する以上の意味を持たない。

島を攻略する難易度を考えると３番目の島は１番目の島とほとんど同等の難易度に落ち着き、最後の中央のテスラタワーの難易度も一番目の島の最後のテスラタワー程度の難易度となっている。島全体の難易度としては２番目の島の難易度だけがなぜか無駄に高く、難易度調整を放棄したゲームだというのが如実に伝わってくる。


死亡時のペナルティ。例えプレーヤーキャラクターが死亡しても、手に装備しているアイテムを一つ失うだけでチェックポイント（最後に眠った場所）に復活。失ったアイテムは地図上の死亡マークの位置に落ちている。ペナルティーが軽いのでマシンガンを何本か手に入れてマシンガンの弾を無限に作れるようになったら、本当に緊張感の薄い脳筋プレイにしかならない。また、武器の切り替え時のタイムラグが数秒あるので武器を持ち代えるよりも、同じ武器でごり押ししてしまったほうが良いことも脳筋プレイに拍車をかける。


敵性モブのAIと動き
動きの早い敵性モブは大回りにプレーヤーキャラクターの背後を取る行動をよくするが、あまりAIの出来が良くないので程よく障害物に引っかかって足踏みをすることがある。
このゲーム自分のダッシュ速度がとても速く、オープンワールドの島々をめぐるのに重宝するが、速度の速い敵性モブも同等の速度で動いており、傍から眺めているとありえない速度で動いていると思える。


UIの使い勝手
ジャーナル・・・マップなども含まれる・・・（ESC/M/L）、クラフト（U）、インベントリー（I）機能的にすべて別物扱いで、各機能毎にそれぞれのウィンドウを開くボタンで使い分ける。インベントリーはIキーで開き、Iキーで閉じられるのに、クラフトはUキーで開きUキーで閉じられない。ストレージへのアクセスはEキーだがこれも閉じるのはESCとか、微妙に使い勝手が悪い。ゲームパッドにも対応しているが、「キーボード＆マウスを持っていない人だけ」がそうすればいいだけの機能で、苦行レベル。

おまけ。地図を見ると島中に×印が記載されているが、そこを掘るとアイテムが埋まっているので、暇つぶしの作業プレイが好きなら楽しめるかも。


技術的な問題
フルスクリーンでのプレイにもかかわらず、バグによりゲーム中に突然ゲーム画面が最小化され、タスクバーに。これが戦闘中に起こるとイラッとするし、よく起こる。
長時間（たぶん５，６時間だったと思う）プレイし続けていると、フレームレートが急激に低下することがある。６０で安定だったのが２０以下で安定に。
クリーンインストールしたwin7 Home Premiumで起動できなくなった・・・何故だ？win10 Homeでは問題なく動く。


その他
出来ることは色々用意されているが、それを生かして楽しめるほどコンテンツがそろっているわけではないし、それらを楽しむようなバランス調整も放棄されている。用意されたゲーム内のメカニックが何一つ生かされなかったゲームというのが妥当な評価だと思える。安いゲームなのであまり辛らつに評価すべきではないと考えているのだが、金を払ってまでして退屈な作業プレイをしてストレスを溜め込まなくてもいいだろうとは思う。それでもゲームの勝手を理解するための１番目の島くらいは楽しめるだろうが。

[h1]Incredibly playable, nicely placed, achievements all attainable and great fun. highly recommended!.[/h1]
Pros:
- great atmosphere, very good music and wonderfully rendered 'Japanese WWII Military' environments 
- some of the enemies are really scary
- tough-as-nails, but very rewarding
- a game where there is no speaking or dumb cutscene exposition: just kill, find next objective and survive

Cons:
- watch wildlife try and climb mountains after you - LOL
- passwords, seriously? should randomise this stuff otherwise you google it: seemed a dumb way to pad out length of game.

This would be awesome and I mean AWESOME, if it was an online MMO **without PVP** where people can trade items, etc.

All the open world survival games I have seen have PvP in them.

I been looking for a game like this, that is open world sandbox, MMO without PvP.
Yet this is not MMO. Would be awesome if it was, just for trading, etc.

For the silly low price this game is, most people would enjoy it if they are into open world, walking simulation, survival and crafting.

The crafting is great, the open world and scenery is great.
Killing, well I am testing it on low level, creatures can't fight back. So I can not comment, yet level 2 and 3 are look better when you got to grips with the game, where the creatures fight back, etc, etc.
So I can't really comment on that part, yet if the game so far is anything to go by, I am in for a treat ;)

All I can say is this is an excellent game for the price.

Please, Please, Please, make this an MMO without the PvP, just for trading and grouping, etc.

[h1]Before playing:[/h1]
I played this game for a while on iOS and was astounded to find it available on Steam! I loved it on iOS, I'm sure it will be even better for PC. I will update this review when I put more gameplay time into it.

[h1]After playing:[/h1]
So I beat the game and got all of the achievements. The game was great for the price. It only crashed three times in the amount of time it took me to play through the story (seven hours). The third crash set me back a bit (I was working on getting to the last tesla tower).

I do not see much replay value, however, there is likely some fun to be had in continuing playing the open-world portion of the game. There is a multiplayer option with a scarce amount of people who actively play it. If there is anyone on, there is a high chance that they are a hacker. It is also kind of repetitive walking constantly to the radiation towers, it is probably something that takes up a quarter of play time.

[h1]Positives:[/h1]
[list]
[*]There is a cool base-building system that I used, but not much. It can probably introduce a lot of a playtime as it is fun to build and you can do a good amount with it. I may come back to this game just to use it more. It is similar to Rust's base-building.
[*]Graphics are incredible for a game that costed 2.99.
[*]I can run this game with >200 FPS on maxed out graphical settings.
[*]The game supports 144hz, you have to go into the configuration file yourself and set the VSync value to zero, however.
[*]Massive amount of content for it’s price.
[*]Cool animations, the “old rifle” (the bolt action rifle) has a nice satisfying reload animation.
[*]Interesting storyline, based off of a real life conspiracy theory (Philadelphia Experiment)[/list]                            
[h1]Negatives:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Looting is generally bland.
[*]Game seems to have been abandoned by the developers.
[*]In my seven hours of gameplay, I've had three crashes occur.
[*]The multiplayer is bland and I do not think there is a way to communicate with other players but it is better than getting nothing.[/list]

[h1]Other things that should be mentioned:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Not much variety of items (not a big deal.)
[*]Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (most survival games are like this.) 
[*]The multiplayer is also potentially unoptimized. In the short while I played it I noticed that people shake around in place. This may not be the games fault as it could be a result of ping.[/list]",1492644336,1569784619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Radiation Island is a true gem. For $3, you get a ridiculous amount of content: A full fledged open world survial crafting game with a loose story to tie it all in. It isn't as complicated or deep as a game like 7 Days to Die or The Forest, but this is what make it truly remarkable.  

The game is light on crafting, giving you all the options from the start, with most of your more powerful weapons being found in marked treasure chests on the map. There are base building options for the hardcore, but most will find it easier to fast travel to a home base as soon as night hits. 

The visuals aren't anything extraordinary, but Radiation Island makes up for it with a very daunting and creepy atmosphere. Day/Night cycles and constantly varying weather patterns keep things fresh, while random radiation clouds spring up at random to give the island a feeling of ""science and technology gone wrong."" Great sound effects compliment it all very well, more so when you play with a decent headset, and keep things spooky.

It's hard to recommend Radiation Island because I find it hard to explain why I enjoy it so much myself. Keep your expectations low and realize this isn't aiming to be next gen by any means. It's great for what it's worth, and I can honestly say I've played similar yet terrible titles at 10 times the price.",1489468594,1610097168,True,3,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Устали искать еду и убивать зомби, чтобы выжить? А добывать ресурсы и собирать из палок, веревок и батарейки устройство, которое в реальности собрать под силу только китайским инженерам по чертежам умников из силиконовой долины? Наверняка устали, но вам все ещё хочется поиграть в нечто подобное. Вот вам Radiation Island, чтобы эту охоту отбить.

Как ни странно, если вы ярый фанат всего вышеперечисленного, то вы явно будете чувствовать себя в своей тарелке. Не жалко выкинуть чуть больше доллара, великолепно, это крошка ваша. Вас будет ждать умопомрачительная история о герое, который согласился участвовать в таинственном эксперименте. Суть его заключается в том, что вас отправляют на остров, где бродят дикие животные и жуткие зомби, а в заброшенных руинах разбросаны данные о том, что произошло с островом.

Конечно же никаких скучных поисков истины с невероятными сюжетными твистами, никаких леденящих душу ужасов, поджидающих вас в глубине острова, только самый настоящий увлекательнейший поиск ресурсов для строительства бесхозной хижины, охота за тонущими в текстурах животными и отстрел мутных типов, напоминающих с виду зомби.

Продумана до мельчайших деталей анимация рубки, колки, стрельбы и крафта, продумана так, чтобы ваши глаза не отвлекались ни на что лишнее. Всего пару однообразных элегантных движений и дерево ваше, всего пять-шесть деревянных бумерангов и крокодил переворачивается, корчясь от боли в предсмертной агонии. Конечно, агонию вам понадобится пофантазировать, потому что на глазах ваших эта рептилия просто отлетит немного в сторону, нарушив пару законов физики, тем самым ознаменовав свою кончину. Только не расслабляйтесь, ибо за углом вас может ждать месть от его собрата, который притаился в текстурах в ожидании жертвы.

Вся эта радость упакована в восхитительной красоты графику. Статичное голубое небо и нежные белые облака не раздражают глаза лишними пестрыми оттенками, если же вы скучаете по неожиданным эпилептическим фокусам, то на острове расположены специальные вышки, которые пропускают огромных размеров электрические волны, рассекая небосвод по ночам. Так прекрасно, когда разработчики думают об игроках. Великолепная архитектура японских рыбацких деревушек и голый бетон военных баз прекрасно контрастируют на фоне зеленых полей и высоких, не поверите, коричневых деревьев. Вокруг резвые зайцы и спокойные камни, которые в отличие от первых не убегают от вас. Спустя несколько часов начинаешь задумываться, а не этот ли остров называют «Райское наслаждение».

Radiation Island манит вас своей ценой, освоенным и возведенным в абсолют жанром выживания в компании зомби. Если у вас все ещё возникает вопрос, стоит ли поиграть в эту игру, то мой ответ однозначный: ""Да! Это лучшая песочница-робинзониада для Android'а"". Ах да, она ещё и в Steam есть, но тогда читайте этот обзор наоборот.

Vous êtes seul, sur un ensemble d'îles, vous devez survivre et tenter de régler la situation que vous ne connaissez pas vraiment.

[h1]Histoire[/h1]
Aucune naration, vous devez explorer les îles et plusieurs emplacements pour trouver des segments d'un journal de l'un des derniers survivants, du moins c'est ce que je crois. Il explique, page par page, des éléments sur les îles. Un ensemble créé par l'homme pour des recherches scientifique (la raison classique). Un ensemble de tour ont été créé pour permettre aux îles pour rester rassemblé et en mer. Vous devez les désactivés, car elles causeraient des changements importants.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Vous devez survivre, les îles renfermes des dangers, le froid, les animaux et les zombies. Fabriquer vos armes, vos médicaments et vos vêtements. Trouver des coffres pour obtenir des éléments un peu plus rare, ou pour le rangement.

Vous pouvez construire des maisons (mais inutile), mais 'dautres éléments, comme un fourneau, vous permettera de transformer des minéraux en matériaux (plomb, acier et titane). Couper des arbres, des arbustes, frapper la roche, tous est utilisable, ou presque. Vous pouvez même pêcher!

[h1]Design[/h1]
Oublier le travail 3D dans les texture, ont ce retrouver avec un moteur a gros détails, surement du pour alléger la map vu que c'est un immense Open World. Un cycle jour/nuit simple et une rotation de l'environnement (clair, pluie, brumeu).

Le design des personnage est très limite et peux varier, deux animaux pacifiques; lapin et mouton, quatre animaux dangereux; crocodile (ou alligator), loup, tigre et ours, 4 ennemis ""humain""; zombie, soldat fou, prisonnier zombie, scientifique mutant, ce dernier est également disponible en version MEGA sur l'île centrale. Leur AI est très basique (entre dans leur zone ou tire dessus, il se dirige stupidement vers vous).

[h1]Durée de vie[/h1]
Malgré la piêtre qualité du moteur, il est intéressant d'y jouer, apprendre la mécanique et avoir confiance en vous pour explorer de plus en plus la map. Vraiment intéressant le concept de ramasser pour s'équiper, mais vite ont passe les armes faibles pour que créer munitions, hache de qualité et vêtement de qualité, ont ignore vite le silex, les plantes, etc... car ont trouve abondamment des éléments dans la map pour tout faire, ou presque. Les minéraux et le bois seront votre priorité, après avoir rammasser un maximum de cuir pour agrandir votre sac au maximum.

Une seul îles peut ce faire en 2-8 heure de jeu, selon si vous être ""cible direct"" ou ""randonneur"". Plusieurs choses sont absent de la map, ce qui ammène souvent à vouloir explorer un petit viilage, un chalet, une usine....

[h1]En simple ?[/h1]
Intéressant pour le prix, le design du jeu fait penser qu'il existe une version mobile, qui doit être vraiment plus difficile. Le jeu va à votre rythme, et vous pouvez passer des heures à explorer. Une fois la mécanique apprivoissé, vous irez beaucoup plus vite ce qui vous nuirra peut-être, mais qui va rendre le jeu répétitif rapidement. L'absence de AI efficace, d'arme de qualité et manque de raffinement dans les menu et l'absence de sauvegarde manuelle rend le jeu un peu irritable. Au sujet de la sauvegarde, il le fait automatiquement, mais je ne sais pas quand, j'ai beau quitter après une ""nuit"", ont dirait qui oublie les 5-10 minutes avant.

There are many challenges and dangers. If you think you're safe walking around during the day, think again. You may just come across a floating black mass that drains you of your radiation suit, chest armour, pants, boots and helmet and then your eventual death. My advice - when you see this black mass......RUN the other way amd keep running because there's next to no chance you can outrun it if you're too close.

The music is appropriate for the situation you're in. When there's danger, music intensifies, when it's peaceful around you, the music is mellow. One of the nest attributes of this game is the weather pattens. It changes a lot from clear skies to rain to fog and adds to the gameplay nicely.

The crafting system is simple and there's an ubudance of resources all over the island and you won't starve to death travelling on foot,

I really hope the devs add more content to this game because it's a diamond in the rough and up there with the more expensive crafting games.

Here's how I spent 75 minutes.

Left ""tutorial area"" and got attacked by 4 wolves.
Got chased by a bear.
Got chased by 4 mountain lions.
Got chased by two wolves that were themselves being chased by a crocodile.
Got attacked by 5 mountain lions.
Got attacked by tiger.
Got chased by zombies.
Got chased by a pack of zombies being chased by a bear.
Found houses on the water.
Felt safe.
Checked inside boat house.
Boat house had mountain lion inside.
Got chased by mountain lion.

My advice to the developer:

A) Dramatically scale back the number of things that can kill you.
B) Add deadly birds and sharks so that I never have to stop being chased.

I've been playing alot of 7 Days To Die recently hence the recommendation for a similar genre game, Radiation Island is the best value for money on Steam atm in my humble opinion. It reminded me abit of ark (no dinosaurs) in looks, the crafting is so easy to get to grips with its almost idiot proof. It looks alright, zombies are abit Plants N Zombies but thats ok, the others certainly make up for it. Theres animals to go kill and harvest for their skins and meat, plenty of material grinding to be had, base building nice and simple, no messing. Its even got the Minecraft option to sleep at night so you don't get chewed up by the wild creatures that are bolder and nastier during dark hours.

This game is very worth the £1.99 I paid.

The graphics are great and easy on the eye and is not heavy on your system cpu and other requirements on high settings!

The game play is smooth not glitchy I have not come across bugs yet there is only one thing that bugged me and that was the fact it could rain indoors???

Great crafting setup I like the hints but they can get annoying but there is a way to turn them off.
Fight and engadging enemy/environment is simple such as hack and slash.

WHAT IT NEEDS: 
More character integration/creation.
Being able to interact with furniture such as chairs tables/beds etc.
Create colour for garments created.
Customization
Upgrading
Defence/Trap/Turret base implementation.
Animal taming / mounts.

Radiation Island is a rare finished survival game, I was surprised that it was only $3.

I love gathering, crafting and building, exploring, fighting zombies, animals and uncovering the story.

This game runs very well on my PC and it should considering I have a high end PC.

There's a few things that could be added or improved, such as even with a roof on your building it rains inside your house. It should not rain inside buildings, that is just strange.
I see buildings that are in the game, built by the military or scientists have fences around them, but there is no option to be able to build fences yourself.

[h1]レビュー[/h1]
ゾンビあり、狩りありのサバイバルゲーム。
メインシナリオが用意されていて島をめぐりながら謎を解いていく。
フィラデルフィア計画によってパラレルワールドの島に迷い込んだわけですが、どうやら人の住んでいた痕跡があるようです。

ゲームのプレイ感はやさしい世界のARKといった感じです。
恐竜は出てきませんが。
難易度が3つ用意されてるので好みに合わせて選べます。

出血や骨折をしたりそれをアイテムで治療する、空腹時に食べ物をとる、寒さに備えて火を焚いたり毛皮をはおるなどの必要十分なサバイバル要素を体験できます。銃が死に武器になってないので思う存分使ってください。

資源収集はかなりやさしめで、重量の概念が無いのでインベントリスロットさえ増やせば大量に運搬できます。採集ポイントのリポップも比較的早め。いい道具がすぐに揃えられるのでそれをを使えばすぐにアイテムがたくさん集まります。
クラフトも特定の設備やレシピが必要なわけではなく、メニューを開けばどこでも作れます。
(鉱物の精錬や食料の調理は例外的に特定の設備が必要)

キャラの成長要素はしいて言えばインベントリスロットくらいなので気軽にプレイできます。

建築要素もあり、スナッピングでの拠点作成ができます。
(ARKやFallout4のあのタイプです)

[spoiler]序盤注意しなければならないのはスプリントしてくるタイプの敵です。ライオンやカタナ兵士は油断すると間合いを詰められてごっそりHPを持っていかれます。あとは放射能汚染区域の探索はアイテムを準備していないといけません。[/spoiler]

グラフィックに関してはもともとはスマホ向けにリリースされていたゲームのためか美しいと言うほどでありませんが、見劣りするレベルではありません。むしろ軽快に動作しているのでグッドです。

ゲーム内の特定のアイテムにマルチプレイに関してほのめかすテキストが見られますが、これはおそらくモバイル版にもともとあった要素だと思われます。現状マルチプレイができるのは確認できていません。(がもしかしたら今後実装される可能性はあります)

やさしい世界でサバイバル・建築ゲームがやりたい人、メインシナリオに興味がある人、動作が軽快なサバイバルゲームを求めている人に強くおすすめします。",1480591529,1481452049,True,31,2,0.728911280632019043,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Man what a game for the price ! This game looks real good and runs good also . Think a cheap version of Far Cry 3 with crafting lol . The game is set up like most survival games, so if you own some you will get the swing of this game fast . This one feels like a relaxing game or a beginners survival game meaning that its got a good level settings and the game is real easy to learn and master. It also has a good bit to explore if you are into that.

One thing i have to say for a EA game and for its price this has to be one of the best EA games ive played in a bit . So far i have not come across any major bugs or issues or game brakers! So hats off to the Dev or Devs ! 

Also one thing i like about this game is story think Philadelphia Experiment and also you get your Zombies in this one also and a nice little mystery at play so you can finding clues and stuff on the island and about the island :) 

If you like these type of survival , crafting and exploring games i say get this game ASAP for this price its a steal !!",1480543772,1480543934,True,39,1,0.632044792175292969,4,False,False,False,False,,,

I've been playing the Mac version for a couple of years now and this looks to be a nice port. 

The game was originally designed for iOS, but it turns out to be one of those rare gems that makes mobile gaming look good. There's no DLC, no micro-transactions, none of that nonesense which gives contemporary gaming a foul taste in the mouth.

For 3 bucks, you are getting a surpringsly deep and feature complete survival game.  (Thumbs up to Atypical Games for keeping the same price!)

Here's the game - You find yourself on an island, now survive. This means:

* You must disable towers on all the islands
* Fight the irradiated inhabitents and the psychotic animals
* Yes, there are zombies
* Nightime can be very painful
* You must explore ancient WWII ruins

The game has crafting and base building as well as a story that actually ends vs playing it until you get bored.

The game also has multiplayer but you have to beat the game in order to play it. It's just a simple deathmatch game which isn't that intriguing. 

If you are interested in seeing it in action, I made an entire Let's Play series on it.

辐射岛虽然画质不高，bug挺多，但是它绝对是一款好的沙盒游戏。很优秀，也很孤独。
第一次接触是在iOS平台上玩的1.0版本，可惜现在已经不更新了，永远停在1.0.6（steam版本是1.0.4），如果官方能继续更新这款游戏的话，它一定会越来越好的，可以增加一些游戏玩法或是steam创意工坊
可惜它不再更新了

As a huge fan of survival games, you just can't beat something like this. Especially at it's price point. It is a freaking steal. 

I went into the game with very low expectations. Survival games have been becoming very cliched. This game, also, is your typical survival, but what makes this different is there's an end game. What's the reward when you complete the game? Multiplayer! That is pretty cool for its genre. 

The game does have a story. Very small so far that I have seen. You come in on a ship and happened upon an island where experiments were or is being ran. The mission is to make it to the center and turn off teslas so your life can go back to normal. But you must survive, grind, and craft so you can prepare for the threats that lie towards the center. Wolves, bears, zombies, and others I'm sure. When they hit you, it hurts. I had to run back to camp after every melee fight so far. I've learned to fight from a distance. The threats in the game are very much real and resources seem to be very hard to come by. But that brings me to another of why I enjoy this game. To proceed, you must hunt down these creatures that want to kill you. You may need the bear fur or bones, wolf's pelt, zombie may have a weapon. You do what you must to proceed. 

Now the cons.
-There are a few bugs. But they are more nitpicky bugs to me. Nothing to where it is game ruining.
-Time in the day. It's hard to tell how much time you have until it gets dark. From the story in the game, it's dangerous when night falls and I've never been stuck out there to find out how dangerous it is. But when night comes, you have about 20 secs from the moment you realize its dusk til it is completely dark. But it was mention in-game that the island is messing with the day and night cycle so it could be part of the game.
-The map. There's two different maps. One full view of the island then one map that is more zoomed in. I can't move the map in any direction to see when way I need to go. Sense of direction is all messed up for me because the sun seems to be running North and South according to the map.  There's no compass, So i tend to get turned around here and there and have to open my map every 10 seconds. I know I could run straight but the island is full of mountain terrain and threats of the creatures always stop me.
-Melee. It's impossible to melee attack and not get hit back. In other words, no way of dodging theirs. When they hit you, it hurts. 

From those cons, they are more nitpicky cons than actual cons. I could actually say, I haven't experienced one bad moment.

Pros
-Price point. 3 dollars and you get an amazing game. This game is worth more and I appreciate the devs for making it this low to try to get attention.
-Survival aspect. This is par with all the good survival games out there right now. Only difference is it being single player. But I love that.
-The unknown. I can't help but just have the sense of not knowing what is just over that hill. For once, I am happy to fear the things in the woods than to fear a random player killing me for my stuff.
