But here are my thoughts anyway.

I have complex thoughts on this one. there were some things that were done so extremely well, and others that really could have been improved upon. starting with the good - this game adds so much depth to nancy's character, as well as her relationships with her dad, boyfriend, and mother of course. yes, we get to learn more about nancy's mother, but i think it's more important to get to see how nancy reacts to the knowledge she gains throughout the game. at the end, onions were definitely being chopped, i don't think another ND game has made me cry! the resolutions that nancy comes to regarding her mother's death and her own grief were really meaningful, and the VA's voice acting was especially excellent in this title.

regarding improvements...i really felt like they could have made better use of the location. it's scotland, and it feels like you get to see precious few scraps of locations that are definitively scotland - everywhere else, you wouldn't be able to tell where in the world it was taking place. there are several questions/observations raised by nancy about the situation that never get answered, and not in a wistful wondering way - in a genuine, plot hole sort of way. i loved the characters with the exception of the antagonist, i felt as if he could've been developed more and given more of a motive than 'lonely and sad' lol. 

that being said, i did enjoy the spy theme/gadgets of this game and it has a good mark in my book overall!!",1688093281,1688093281,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,True,,,

This was a fun Nancy Drew game, with the storyline being a little closer to home for Nancy than most. You set off to solve the case of your mother’s dead, which was a “car accident.” From here the story just keeps getting more and more in depth, honestly so much so that I lost my interest as well as my following of the storyline. It was kind all over the place, but it didn’t matter, the storyline seemed interesting in itself. The puzzles were decent, and the arrow shooting mechanics was really fun. The mini-game here to earn money was making cookies, and I did a lot of that, it was actually fun. This game has a lot of twists and turns, but honestly, it was one of the more lack luster Nancy Drew games with a lot of phone conversations, and very few characters throughout the entire game. The environments were beautiful, while not many, and the characters were honestly a bit more boring compared to the other games. It kinda just felt shoved through a pipeline for the sake of creation, lacking some of the Nacny Drew charm that the other games carry so fondly.

The puzzles were a good difficulty - not so hard that it's frustrating, not so easy that it's boring - but the hints for solving a lot of them were buried in an overload of information. Often the keys to puzzles were in theory readily available but the game threw so much information at me I had difficulty sorting through it and remembering what info I'd been given. 

The plot too is a little complicated and convoluted so that I found it hard to sum up in a single sentence. However, the story is very action packed, especially for a Nancy game! 

One other difficulty I encountered was knowing what to do - this game, unlike all the other Nancy games that I've played, doesn't give the player the option to call one of Nancy's friends for a hint in Junior Detective mode, which made it even more difficult and confusing. Those hints often help in pointing me in the right direction or enable me to see something that I might have missed! 

Lastly, the mini games in Nancy adventures are very hit or miss - fortunately, the cookie decorating mini game was definitely a hit for me! (And made me wish I could find a job where I could earn $10 for every cookie I decorated in real life). There was a nice lack of painstaking chores and other characters' reliance on Nancy to do their jobs for them in this game too, which I appreciated.

I liked the story and the puzzles were a good level of difficulty, perhaps it was on the medium side. Some of the characters were great, some were alright.

I also liked that most of the resources you needed were with you most of the time. 

One of the weaker points to this one was that there was a lot of repetition in the conversations with the characters. I think Nancy asked the same questions like 10 times. But because I liked most of the characters enough, it was not unbearable, and you can skip through them. It also felt like a relatively short game compared to some others. 

For reference, my favorites in the series are Blue Moon, Royal Tower and Ghost of Thornton. My least favorite is Shadow Ranch (too many chores and annoying characters lol).

Seriously, if you are a long time Nancy Drew game fan, this one hits all the marks, not to mention it's a rare and responsibly told foray into Nancy's canon and they do such a good job with the story. The game flows well and there always seem to be something to do, even in lulls 
(of which there were few). It has a good range of puzzles, ranging from fun, to medium to challenging (for me these are always the ones where you simply use association and intuition to put the clues together, and ultimately solve it using trial and error). Be warned there is a lot of text/letters to read and lots of dialogue.

- Nothing super taxing on your motor skills (I hate QTEs because I physically have problems doing them)
- Very modern, interesting story based on espionage (so lots of cool gadgets to use)
- The interface is sleek and tidy-looking (not so with the older ND games)
- You can skip ahead in the dialogue when people are taking too long to get to the point
- Game flow was mostly intuitive, though I did consult the walkthrough several times (however that's normal for me in these games)

Being a fan of a ""Nancy Drew"" series for many years, I have seen all sorts of games about her. Some I just adore, I like most of it, a few left me indifferent. But with all confidence I can say that «Nancy Drew: The Silent Spy» is the most personal game of the series, opening the window to the player in the world of a young girl-detective and in the past of her parents. Attempts to learn more about the car accident, in which her mother Kate died 10 years ago, lead an curious girl in Glasgow, and each new step leads to even more mysteries. Even the person closest to Nancy, her father Carson, behaves strangely, apparently hiding something and not talking about the circumstances of the accident. And gradually, a whole spy story is revealed in front of the player, with interesting plot moves, terrorist organizations and special services, the rather grim and viscous atmosphere of Scotland and suspicions around every corner.

The 29th game of the series, of course, cannot hit with some revolutionary changes (and for what?), but there is some improvement in the graphic part, there are some interesting solutions in sound design, technically the series is moving forward, while not forgetting its traditions. Like any modern teenager, the phone in the hands of Nancy is a powerful weapon that can help in any situation. According to him, she will be able to consult about the difficulties of the investigation with her closest friends and father, gather important information, and when it’s boring, just play simple mobile games. An important role, as the name of the game actually implies, will be played by various spywares, with the help of which it will be necessary to solve puzzles, hack and eavesdrop, getting to the bottom of the truth.

If we say that I was not touched, it is mandatory to make money for various purposes (but I’ll just say that I didn’t like it in previous games  too, because it distracted from the main investigation) In this game you can either find them in hidden places, or get baking cookies. This job is fun, but after a while it gets boring. This is not a critical minus, and it does not affect the overall impression of the game. Yes, and some musical puzzles do not always like all the players.

And of course, the creators of the game will give the player not only to carry out an investigation, but also to learn many new interesting facts about Scotland, through studying various books, brochures, visiting many beautiful locations. I like this  theme very much, so I sincerely enjoyed every new discovery. Together with very personal experiences, all this created a very interesting and coherent picture, which was fascinating to follow.

Nancy Drew is one of the most well known fictional detectives in literature. Many grew up with her books and games, and even if they forget the name, Nancy Drew can easily bring up an image of a teenage girl detective solving mysteries. For her 29th adventure in her game series, it gets a little more personal. In both her books and the games, Nancy’s mother is not looked into nor given any extensive backstory. All we know is that she died when Nancy was young. So what happens when Mrs. Drew is the mystery?

With Mrs. Drew’s bare backstory, Nancy Drew: The Silent Spy builds on it to give her more character. Named Kate Drew, she visited Glasgow, Scotland after getting a phone call eight years ago. She never returned and died in a car accident.

Eight years later, a mysterious letter is delivered to Nancy from a MI-5 organization named Cathedral asking her to go to Scotland. Kate’s death is not what it seems and has gone unsolved since. Soon learning that her mother was a spy taking down a terrorist organization called Revenant with the cost of her life. But Kate’s death is believed to have been intentionally caused by Revenant. Nancy soon finds herself taking her mother’s place as Revenant starts to rise again.

As she arrives in Scotland, it seems like the few people she meets is nice and immediately wants to help her. Each character has their own quirks that I could not help but love. Other than the repeating characters of Carson and Ned, both wanting Nancy to get home safely and giving you information this time around, there are only a few characters. There is Bridget, a friendly native that takes an instant liking to you, Moira, a woman who has a close connection with Kate, Alec, a skip tracer, and Ewan, your Cathedral contact that assists you throughout your mission. Don’t put too much trust in them, after all everyone hides secrets.

A lot of the characters are likeable, my favorite being Bridget, and you do get the feeling that they are hiding something from you. Bridget in particular gives off an energetic vibe, mostly through her great voice acting and writing. In fact, everyone is written and voice acted well. While I do not know my Scottish accents, all of the people that is supposed to have one does have a constant and natural sounding accent. None of them suddenly changes it for no reason and you can hear that they share the same accent.

The dynamic of Carson and Nancy is heartwarming. They both miss Kate, but they have different ways of showing it. While Nancy agrees to go to Scotland to learn of her mother’s true lifestyle, Carson wants Nancy to be safe. He does lock up some of Kate’s papers but it is to keep her safe as Carson knows her drive to solve mysteries. When he realizes Nancy will not go home till she finds out, they both have a heart to heart and Carson goes along with it.

With Nancy, you do see why everyone wants her to go back home. Nancy is the only one not caring about the harm that can befall her, mostly seen with Revenant contacting her. You can decide to do the activities Revenant gives you to gain more information about your mother and thus show how far she is willing to go. She also gets to do some cool spy stuff with the gadgets she gets. A few flashbacks to Nancy’s childhood when Kate was still alive is also nice. It further connects her to Kate and makes it more believable.

You get a lot of history of Scotland through books and newspapers, some optional and others used for puzzles. With one of the ways you can get money making cookies at the stand outside of your hotel. Though you only get a few areas to go to. I’m disappointed that Nancy did not go to where Kate had her car “accident”, especially since she went mostly for her mother, or try to dig up any reports. Most being inside, with one of the pubs not able to enter. It would of been interesting to have a lot of areas to go to branching off of the train station to give it a more of a Scottish feel rather than just locations.

There are a variety of puzzles for you to enjoy. Some puzzles go with the Scotland area such as having you figure out the names of Scottish food and recreating and recognizing a tartan design. Others use logic as you try to figure out various codes or arranging letters to unlock something. There are interesting puzzles scattered around, one of the most memorable ones contain you having to understand sheet music. Only a few puzzles are timed and they give a good amount of time in relation to what you need to do. Be careful, as most have an implied timer. You can always start over if you are caught.

Though why is Cathedral using the same passwords from eight years ago, especially when Revenant needs the information Kate has to rise again. There had to be someone in Cathedral that knew, or could of hacked into, her password just in case Revenant figured it out before Nancy.

There was one puzzle that did not work out in their favor, the Jabberwocky puzzle. Early on you find out one of the papers in your suitcase was a poem Kate kept called the Jabberwocky. Once you receive a colored version, all you know is that it is a regular poem. Though suspicion is raised with some words being colored and most not. This is when it gets muddled. Nancy Drew games are designed in a way that you can do steps out of order if possible, so you do get some wiggle room. The problem with the Jabberwocky puzzle is that you will know it is a puzzle, and not just a poem, if you skip to the last clue. Kate left a recording of her giving instructions on how to decode the message, and even Nancy says there is a message hidden in the poem, but you can not solve it yet. You have to get told to follow those instructions on a note. This could of been handled with the note not being needed to start decoding but for the player to use it as a reference, like the books you get are. I am also disappointed that you can’t find all the letters yourself, as it already writes down the letters and puts spaces where it did not specify in the recording. It would of added another way for the player to take the role of a detective.

Nancy Drew: The Silent Spy is a great game in the Nancy Drew series. It was interesting having a game where Nancy is driven by her personal need to know what happened to her mother. Everything is handled seriously and you can feel how the Drew family misses Kate. It was a risk giving Kate Drew this backstory and having the player not believing it from the other family members, but it does work out. If you have not played the others, or only played some of them like I have, this is a good entry point.
