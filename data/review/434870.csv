Then, the repetitive gameplay and the grating, squeaky voices of the ridiculous, bobble-headed candidates drags down the whole experience. If the “strategy” tag on this game appealed to you, you’ll be sorely disappointed. [/h1]

.Story.

In the 2016 elections, anyone can run. Play as a giant form of presidential candidates Hilary Clinton, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, or Donald Trump and try to win the popular vote by running around the states.

.Gameplay.

[i]Anyone can run in the 2016 election...[/i]

You run—literally—using the mouse. In fact, the entire game can be played via your mouse, though there are a few hotkeys that correspond with the number keys.

[i]...But to win you’ll need to be fast... [/i]

The race is on. (See what I did there?) In order to conquer districts, you’ll need to get there before your enemy and sway your constituents with honeyed words that you may or may not mean. You know, like an election. The squeaky voices that utter these honeyed words are aggravating, but if you listen closely, you’ll hear phrases that you might actually expect the flesh and blood candidate to say in real life. That was a nice touch.

So long as the coloured ring around your candidate’s feet are touching your constituents, who are much, much smaller than you for whatever reason, you’ll convert them into loyal campaign supporters. Sort of.

A claimed district will change colours to match your candidate.

[i]...You’ll need to backtrack... [/i]

Constituents’ loyalty is easily swayed by the other candidates, so you’ll need to touch claimed areas frequently in order to lock them and stop them from being claimed by another candidate.

Locking only lasts for a few seconds and so expect to run back and forth frequently—especially if you expect to win over that state at the end. The game will tell you when an opponent is attacking one of your districts, which is helpful, but it needing to drop what you’re trying to claim in favor of saving what you already own quickly becomes tedious.

Revisiting areas will also allow you to pick up the cold hard cash they’ve produced. This cash is a key factor in your campaign because…

[i]...You’ll need… To make it rain?[/i]

That’s right, folks. If you circle the mouse around your candidate, you can encourage your constituents closer to you by showering them with campaign funds. This makes it easier to convert larger groups of people at once, but take care you don’t go broke.

A timer will tick down, indicating when the next city over will wake up. Once a city is awake, you can run to it, which is quite slow, and then start conquering districts anew.

You’ll keep doing this until the timer on the final city runs out. Then, you’ll be taken to the stats screen where you’ll be shown how well you did. After, you’ll be allowed to choose another state… And you start from the beginning of this section.

You do this again and again until you or one of the A.I. becomes president. I’ll be completely honest: I couldn’t find it in me to play until presidency.

.Longevity.

The game has three difficulties, five candidates to play as, and you get to choose your own campaign trail (sort of).

It also has special ability cards, each of which fall under one of three categories: attack, defense, and support. These allow you to do a range of things like double your range of influence, trap other candidates to prevent them from running around and touching your stuff, and flip a claimed territory to neutral so that you can claim it for yourself without any fuss.

*Unlocking cards is a matter of fulfilling arbitrary tasks given to you. If you're going for them and trying to win the popular vote at the same time, you're in for a rough ride.

Regardless, there’s not really a good amount of differentiation in gameplay.

.Pros. 
[list] [*] Fun idea, particularly given the recent election.

[*] The candidates’ chibi forms are accurate.
 [/list]

.Cons.
[list] [*] Fun idea, poor execution. Gameplay gets very repetitive, very quickly. You find yourself clicking a bunch to run around, sometimes pausing to draw a circle so that you can lure in voters. The game very easily becomes a tug of war in which you’ll be balancing conquering neutral areas and dropping everything to run back to the ones you’ve already claimed because the computer is trying to flip them.

[*] The “strategy” tag is misleading due to the above.

[*] No multiplayer. On that note, this would be more fun as a board game than a video game.

[*] The squeaky voices grate on the nerves—especially when they overlap.

[*] No real replayability. The cards don’t change up the core gameplay in a significant way, neither does selecting a candidate. 

[*] The random events before embarking on a campaign are almost guaranteed to fail. The RNG seems harsh and unfair in this case.

[*] The asking price is steep given what the game offers. 
 [/list]

.Bottom Line.

If you’re hardcore into politics and have a high tolerance for repetition, this may be worth a shot. If not, well… You’re better off just watching a YouTube video and having a laugh. You’ll still get about the same amount of content and it would be free as opposed to spending the 9.99.",1479620043,1479620174,False,15,0,0.622328341007232666,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Хотите поучаствовать в предвыборной кампании и стать следующим президентом США? Игра даст возможность окунуться в мир политики, конкуренции, скандалов и манипуляций.

Главная цель – завоевать как можно большее количество симпатий избирателей. Выбираем кандидата, за которого будем играть, и бежим агитировать избирателей. Конкуренты тоже зря времени не теряют. Поэтому нам придется все время поторапливаться. 
Геймплей представляет собой забег по частям карты США (избирательным округам) и агитации населения. Забегаем в очередной райончик и толкаем речи перед зеваками. Для привлечения внимания можно использовать денежки или различные трюки, которые получаем в виде карточек-бонусов («Шарм», «Секс-машина» и т.п.). Некоторые карточки можно использовать против конкурентов («Вор», «Тюрьма»). Сами денежки в игре зарабатываем у избирателей, чьи сердца мы успели покорить. Пробегаем по «завоеванным» районам и собираем пожертвования, которыми потом привлекаем внимание неопределившихся избирателей или переманиваем избирателей конкурентов.

В игре забавная трехмерная графика. Кандидаты изображены в карикатурной, юмористической манере со смешными жестами и голосами, которыми они толкают речи произнося свои любимые фразы.
В игре нет русского языка. Знание английского желательно, но не обязательно.

Чем больше масс будут вами агитированы тем больше бабла вы получите, а за полученое бабло вы сможете проводить больше агитаций и естественно на этом больше заработать. По моему мнению игра актуальна только на время выборов и предвыборной кампании в США. После выборов игра скорее всего умрет.

Political games are hard to come by on Steam. This one, I was very disappointed by.

First of all, I understand that it's in Early Access. No brainer whatsoever. But the dire selection of characters from the get go is disappointing. We're even given the option to play Obama? This is over Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, or whoever. I'm not expecting Political Machine levels of depth but it's silly. Especially when I run against Trump, Obama and another weird version of Hillary? It feels like a lack of care has gone into it.

The lock feature is broken as hell, I can't secure my city at all. The character models look ugly. Trump has cargo pants? Hillary doesn't look like Hillary? They have a really annoying squeaky effect on voices, I'd rather have the unaltered voice. Animations for the UI aren't good. Game mechanics aren't properly explained.

The cartoonish gameplay keeps the player entertained, great move by the developers incorporating tacky campaign speech by the candidates, very funny. The game in its current state is great but I expect more to come once the game is fully polished and released. The time zones in each state add a sense of urgency when campaigning and certainly applies the pressure; I enjoy the tackiness, the cartoony enviroment, and the overall concept of the game. All I ask from the game devs is to alleviate some of the repititiveness of the game by providing the player with  more features than just going disctrict by district and hoping the voters rally around you, even though that's kinda what the candidates are doing IRL. 

I appreciate the random scenarios the game provides the player with when campainging, such as accepting the support of a star or making promises to the voters. I would enjoy the game even more if they were possibly debate platforms, or media angle to work to expand the players options in tackling states, maybe we can launch ads in a state or start a twitter fight with another candidate? I know it is a lot to ask/suggest for but I see alot of potential for this game and I'm very grateful for its kind. Not much political games nowadays other than the Political Machine, Megalo Polis certainly deviates from the genre on its own path.

Overall I can't say I regret spending the $10 on this game, I highly recommend it. The game mechanics, the features, the creativity all coincide with each other for a very enjoyable and funny experience.

The American Election is a great topic .And it also have an interesting core mechanic in this game.
But at current state.it isn't a good game.

You can go to 50 states of America(as 50 or less stage and developers says they will make more special rules at each state)With your three AI Opponent. You must convert more citizen than them to win the battle,At last you can win the election.

The way to convert the citizens into your team is:stand still to make a speech...
Actually,that's not a bad idea. But when your control is awkward, the mechanic seems too weak to play.
The mouse control will make wrong route 50% of all time. 
the speed is too slow sometimes.
The competitive part of this mechanic seems frustrated. And there doesn't have many ways to directly attack the AI.
The AI still have some bug,which will ruin the experience.
If you can make their own personal style into the gameplay more, and make them can fight each other as a way to win the battle,this game will better than now.

The Graphic is good, the cartoon style will increase the effect.and the color is soft and bright,that's alright.
But the sound of the candidate....maybe too fast i think,that's not enough hilarious but a bit of repetitive,if you play a whole game(50 states). You will be mad at Barack's voice.
