The final half of the game felt like a chore due to the jumping mechanic not always activating correctly or under/over estimating the small jump movement that would cause accidental falls from the edge of platforms on the way around and down the bean stalk.  

It is epic as hell when you just stop to take it all in and you're being chased by the giant but then proceeding down is frustrating when you are sent all the way to the last checkpoint because you accidentally grabbed onto your weapon instead of a vine (placing weapons on the players back would really help this) or a big leap just doesn't work properly and you have to go to the last checkpoint that's way the hell up top.

Either way, it was a great experience and I hope these things are addressed, though I realize the game has been out a while and not many other people have played it. Even with its flaws, it's still a unique, visually fantastic and worthwhile play through that I recommend to anyone looking for an adrenaline inducing, high-stakes, climbing Mount Everest experience in a grand fairy tale setting.",1510010076,1510010076,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This game for me was like jumping into one of my favorite story books Jack and the beanstalk and it was amazing! So of course based on the story this will be a climbing game but not all the time cause their is also some action as well. You will obtain a sword to be able to fight off creatures on your way up along with other tools to help you on your adventure. The climbing in this game is close to climby which is a good thing in my opinion, just be prepaired to get a good workout in this game. For me it was a blast from start to finish I could not stop until i made it to the top and when I did I was not dissapointed they really put effort into the scale of things so you really get the feeling of how small you are compaired to a giant. Thier is only 1 beanstalk that I have played so far and the devs have more content planed, it was a great time none the less you really should give it a chance if you enjoyed the story of jack and the beanstalk of just climbing games lol. One last thing if you have a fear of heights or not this game will make your feet tingle a few times cause the scenery is beautiful and you will get caught up in it and make you feel like you really are high up!",1497483239,1497489065,True,9,0,0.664542734622955322,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The soundtrack is lovely but not overpowering and despite a few rough edges in game play (some inexact grip/hop mechanics and slightly clunky early combat) this game is addictingly enjoyable. I can't wait to reach the top but I will avoid any spoilers. If you are looking for a fairly polished and physical adventure game that doesnt feel like just another ""demoey"" collection of assets, this is a great buy at full price!

Soooo not disappointed!!!",1497148501,1497148501,True,15,0,0.643846392631530762,1,True,False,False,False,,,
