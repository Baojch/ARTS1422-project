　　游戏支持中文字幕，这样一开始游戏就没什么难度了，简单熟悉下操作就能迅速开始游戏体验。游戏选择大厅设计的很有意思，是一座太空站的模样，各种科技化的设施看起来很有科幻片的感觉，全息投影的操作界面也很科技感。

　　虽然尝试匹配其他玩家，但依然是一无所获，所以只能先开一把跟AI的对战。游戏模式大致上跟近来很火的《王者荣耀》差不多，都有上下路的攻击路线，也有单体击杀和被杀的次数，被杀后在大本营中重生等等配置。

　　稍微不同的地方无非就是《X驱动 VR》最多只支持4V4，操作的不是具体的人物，而是不同机型的无人机，并且无人机没有那么多技能，只有普通射击和火箭弹两种攻击方式。还有一个最大的不同之处就是这里不用守塔或打塔，玩家们只要想着怎么杀死对方就够了。

　　这种对战模式想必大家基本都能瞬间上手了，不过VR游戏跟手机游戏在操作方面肯定是有很大的差异的。游戏虽然也是第三人称游戏，但在VR设备中玩家视角基本是紧跟无人机的，而且玩家眼前还有显示战机各种数据的仪表。

　　玩家除了视角是第三人称，但射击操作却需要使用手柄来亲手瞄准射击，所以游戏中的沉浸感并不会很差，这样的操作形式反而更有意思。虽然没有太多华丽的大招和技能，但游戏战斗画面看起来却仍然十分激烈。

　　游戏在特效制作上非常细心，普通射击时子弹尾部带有一道光线，混战时满眼乱飞的子弹线条非常惹眼，显得战斗十分激烈。火箭弹的爆炸范围与效果也很夺目，被火箭击中后战机会冒出灰色的浓烟，体现战况惨烈也是不错的效果。另外视觉效果较好的是机身尾部在飞行时会有火花喷射的效果，以及尾灯线条拉长的效果。

　　游戏还有设有战机属性升级和战机购买的程序，通过战斗的个人成绩获取金钱，从而升级自己的战机，或是购买新的战机来提升自己的战斗力，也算是个能够促进玩家游戏热情的玩法设计。

　　尽管是与AI的战斗，却没有想象那么简单，在轻视敌人的情况下，第一局居然败下阵来，可见游戏在AI的设计上也是下了一番功夫的，不像一般“智商”堪忧的AI一样。所以即便没有在线玩家，也能够与AI进行一场大战。

　　这次没能体验到玩家之间合作的战斗有点可惜，毕竟就算再智能也是没法跟AI制定什么战术的，所以玩的几局游戏中也只能做个“独行侠”了。一局游戏的时间规定在7分钟内，时间结束后统计杀敌得分，基本上游戏算是快节奏的战斗模式了。

　　快节奏游戏本身就比较考验玩家的反应力了，何况游戏还需要一边移动一边瞄准射击，而且对方也不是会站着给你打的设置，所以控制起来还是挺有难度的。四对四的局面下，场上就有8架战机，场地又有局限性，所以一旦开战场面就会非常混乱，真的需要玩家眼疾手快才能应付了。

　　混乱的战斗下，游戏的操作却没有丝毫卡顿，无论是移动还是射击都非常顺畅，画面也没有掉帧的现象，视觉上的画面也非常流畅。攻击和被攻击都有相对的震动反馈，子弹射击与导弹攻击的震动力度不同，还有被击毁的爆炸效果也有很好的力度反馈，体验也很完整。

　　游戏过程中一方面需要快速控制战机的飞行移动，另一方面需要配合战机进行视角的移动，所以即使画面处理得好也难逃晕眩感的产生，但导致晕眩感严重是游戏的移动方式。

　　玩家自行快速转动视角本身就会有点不适感了，游戏的移动方式还设计成平移的形式，在刚进游戏的时候就能明显感觉平移带来的不适，在快速游戏过程中晕眩感被不断放大，让玩家非常不舒服。

　　总之游戏多方面的体验都很不错，比较严重的缺陷就是晕眩感太强，可能会有部分玩家体验不了，但说实话如果用瞬移的方式游戏反而没有那么好玩了，所以只能推荐不容易晕VR的玩家体验了。

　　除此之外，游戏在内容上还是太匮乏了，其中还有多个地图未开放，机型也不多，要完整游戏体验除了在线人数的问题，开发商还得增加更多的游戏内容才行，期待之后的不断更新吧。

　　其实游戏战斗体验还是很有感觉的，但就是匹配不到现实玩家，跟游戏AI玩总觉得差点意思，不过这种情况也不是单个游戏的问题，毕竟是整个VR游戏的大问题。抛开这个问题，游戏无论在操作还是战斗画面的精彩程度来看，都有不错的体验，不过平移的移动方式比较影响长时间游戏，容易晕眩的玩家谨慎体验。

　　目前《X驱动 VR(xDrive VR)》在steam上的售价为37元。就现在的游戏配置来说，价格稍微有些偏贵，仅仅只有一个地图的体验过于单一了，希望游戏商能尽快开放更多的战斗场景。即使在线匹配可能比较难，但游戏AI也没有那么弱，玩起来也会很简单，推荐喜欢这类型游戏的玩家购买体验。

Let us make something very clear from the start of this review, this is an early access title at the very start of its life, as such i cut it a lot more slack than i would a released or much older EA title. 
It is a rarity to see third person games in VR but xDrive does it well your drone faces the direction of the left motion controller and its guns face the direction of the right controller, it works (despite a few bugs) very well and is very enjoyable to control. 
It is your standard red team vs blue team, get kills to earn money, a formula that, while old, is loved by us all. The money you earn from the fights can be used to upgrade your drone or even buy new drones which will add t the replayability once more varied arenas are added.
 
[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICS[/b]
The “menu” room in xDrive is a space station base, with two levels connected by a really well done lift, the main area allows you to configure your settings and start a match. 
The second area of the space station allows you to buy and configure your drones, again it is done really nicely, it is clear time has been spent on making this nice.
The game arena however is not as nice, it fits the bill from a game playing point of view and hay that is the main thing but it is nowhere near the quality of the “menu” room and is a bit too small for a combat game.     
There is space on the map for two other arenas, at the price point of the game though i would expect to see more than 3 arenas before it leaves early access, but again it is very new and i cut it a bit of slack on this.
The actual drone models are not half bad though you will not get much time to look at them, this is a fast paced game
 
[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] 
The first version i tested was so laggy i had to quit out before testing further, i spoke with the developer and a patch was out the next day that fixed this, it is not as smooth as other vr games i have played but on my system it is more then ok…..my system is higher end though. 
That said this was its first patch and he significantly improved the performance, i like developers that listen to feedback and fix issues they are rare! 
Expect to see performance improve as time progresses. 


[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] 
It loses a few points here, it took me a while to figure out how to control it despite the controls being on the pads, i am still unsure of how to do a dodge, it says “jerk” but it seems a double tap may do it, to ready up you click “i am not ready” which felt strange to me, the game has a lot of work ahead of it in this area.
 
[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] 
While this is mainly a multiplayer game i was unable to find anyone else playing it, an issue among all multiplayer VR games to be honest, however it does feature some rather good if somewhat evil bots.
 
[b]PROS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] The game has a lot of potential this could turn into a great game
[*] A developer that acts on and listens to player feedback.
[*] A good upgrade / replace drone system giving you a reason to continue to play even against bots.
[*] Bots! All games should have bots! And these are pretty well coded
[/list]
 
[b]CONS:[/b] 
[list]
[*] The asking price vs content is more than a little high at this stage of development.
[*] Only one arena and will get repetitive if more are not added.
[*] The arena is not very good.
[*] Not very intuitive controls
[*] if you have a min vr system you may have performance issues
[*] While the game may turn out to be great it could easily go the other way

[b]VERDICT[/b] 
 
Ah man i wish steam did not give us that black and white Recommend / Do not Recommend ! Here is as i see it, the developer put out a patch to fix the performance issues the day i reported them, and an issue where my own missiles hit my new armour when i fired them the very next day, that commitment to the game gives me the hope and the impression that the games future is bright, i enjoyed what i played of the game, though i did tire of that arena pretty quick and i was very impressed with the drone upgrade and replacement system. 
This is a very borderline recommendation, it is very close to clicking “Do not Recommend” and know full well that it is an early access title. If you want a well rounded game then WAIT, if you want to support a game as it grows then get it. ( to clarify this if games were marked out of 100 and 0 - 50 was do not recommend and 51 - 100 was recommend, i am saying this is a 55, it is that close)
