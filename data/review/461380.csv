A Princess' Tale is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

This time Andorlea/Warfare/SimProse/whatever other shell account this guy uses to try hide his identity has once more stamped out a painfully generic copy + paste RPG Maker asset flip.  Another consistent pattern from this ""developer"" is to write little fan-fics about one of his anime waifus, I wouldn't be surprised if the plot from this came from a body pillow.  It's horribly basic, riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, full of stock copy + pasted RPG Maker assets... no real game development has taken place here, this is just a cash grab, it's shovelware polluting Steam for profit.  This ""developer"" has dumped over 100 copy+pasted RPG Maker asset flips onto Steam, and keeps pumping out minimum viable product RPG Maker asset flips as rapidly as possible to try gouge gamers.

We must ask why this ongoing pollution has any serious value for gamers or the gaming industry.  This kind of cash grab construction kit shovelware from bad actors like Andorlea gives amateur developers a bad name.  This pollution takes marketing space away from genuine indie developers who are doing the right thing, and making real games instead of copying+pasting premade assets in a children's video game construction kit.  It makes it harder for gamers to find genuinely made games.  This pollution is harmful to Steam, to gamers and the gaming industry.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

A Princess' Tale has the laughable price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.",1694006681,1694007073,False,3,1,0.225076809525489807,0,True,False,False,True,,,

首先游戏的剧情设计显得相当平淡无奇。尽管游戏试图通过公主的冒险故事来展现一个充满奇幻和惊喜的世界，但故事情节的发展却缺乏足够的起伏和张力。角色之间的互动也显得单调乏味，缺乏深度和真实感，使得玩家很难对故事和角色产生共鸣。

其次游戏的玩法机制也显得单调且缺乏深度。游戏中的任务和挑战往往过于简单，缺乏足够的策略性和挑战性。玩家可以轻易地通过简单的点击和重复操作来完成任务，这使得整个游戏过程显得枯燥乏味。

在画面和音效方面同样未能达到玩家的期待。虽然游戏采用了童话般的画风，但整体画面质量却显得粗糙且缺乏细节。角色的设计也显得不够精美，缺乏个性和特点。音效设计同样令人失望，背景音乐和音效效果都未能为游戏营造出恰当的氛围和情感。

此外游戏的操作体验也令人感到不适。游戏界面的设计不够人性化，按钮布局和交互方式不够直观，导致玩家在操作过程中经常感到困惑和不便。尤其是在进行复杂的操作时，这种操作上的不便更是加剧了游戏体验的下降。

最后游戏的定价和性价比也让人难以接受。考虑到游戏在剧情、玩法、画面、音效以及操作体验等方面的问题，其售价显然偏高，与游戏品质并不相符。

综上所述，在剧情、玩法、画面、音效、操作体验和性价比等方面都存在令人失望的问题。如果你对公主冒险类游戏抱有期待，我建议你寻找其他更加出色且性价比更高的作品来满足你的需求。",1661535077,1711810766,False,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False,True,,,

The premise of the story is that you, the princess, having been descended from a great warrior who saved the world in the past, must prevent a giant beast from waking up. To do this, you must make contracts with four fairies to reactivate their crystals.

You start with only the main character, but quickly accumulate a party of four, which stays with you for the rest of the game. The world map is populated with towns and enemy locations, but there is no danger in travelling between them, and you cannot access most locations until the story warrants it. The game is mostly linear, with quests being completed one at a time. The story is well told and, more than other RPGs, it seems to remain with you as you progress through the action.

Advancing levels is satisfying, as you learn new skills, and use the gold you accumulate to upgrade your equipment.

Locations in which enemies appear are usually complex mazes which span several maps. Treasure chests are very common, and enemies appear on the map, but can easily be avoided. Some enemies must be fought, of course, to build up levels, so you can defeat the bosses, whose battles are not optional. There is very little diversity in the types of enemies that appear at each location, and it can easily become tiresome.

Overall, the story is very good, it is a relatively short game, and my only complaint is that some of the locations are a bit too large.

Qui, dal consigliere nonchè suo zio, viene mandata a prendere la medicina dal dottore, che si trova nella parte povera della città. Al suo ritorno.

Poi, la città dove muove i primi passi la protagonista, ha un level design scarso, molte case con porte chiuse e pochissime quelle che si aprono. E al loro interno, al massimo 2 npc fermi al loro posto. Di norma è 1. Senza contare le scale che dovrebberò portare al secondo piano della casa ma in verità non portano da nessuna parte. Poi, niente quest secondarie e le buone idee non sfruttate a dovere. Queste idee sono: Il non combattimento nella mappa del mondo, ed è una buona cosa non avere interruzioni mentre si va da un luogo ad un'altro. I nemici nei labirinti che si vedono e si possono evitre, e tranquilli, non vi inseguono se vi vedono, in piu se li uccidete, non ritornano in vita, a meno che voi non uscite nella mappa del mondo. Solo cosi, se si ritorna nello stesso luogo, riappaiono i nemici. Altrimenti nulla. Da una parte, ciò è buono nei livelli avanzati cosi non affrontate di continuo i nemici, dall'altra parte nei primi passi del gioco è difficile aumentare di livello. Per via dei pochi nemici con cui fare esperienza, non potendo uscire dal labirinto almeno inizialmente. La migliore idea che l'autore ha avuto è quella dei vestiti che danno delle abilità alla protagonista e dovrebbe far parlare gli npc in modo diverso. Peccato che ciò funziona solo in ambito della storia. [spoiler] Quando dovrete andare dal dottore, sarete obbligati a vestirvi di stracci, per farvi passare come abitante della zona povera. Altrimenti, le guardie non vi faranno passare essendo la protagonista una principessa. ^^; [/spoiler]  L'idea è buona, ma a parte nella storia. Solo un vestito alla indiana jones, che se indossato, vi da buone abilità tipo il salto per attraversare piccole voragini e spostare gli oggetti. Gli altri vestiti non servono quasi a nulla. Eccetto quella di sacerdotessa, che vi permette di attivare zone magiche che però si trovano solo in un luogo preciso che affronterete durante le tappe obbligate della storia, non da altre parti. E gli Npc, sia se indossate gli stracci o un'abito di pelli, o il vostro vestito da principessa, vi diranno sempre le stesse cose, se non obbligati dalla storia: Vedasi lo spoiler. Peccato. Per il resto è un gdr da fare solo se non si hanno altri gdr migliori, anche fatti con rpg maker. Per via che l'autore non ha minimamente diversificato le zone nel mondo di gioco. Gli edifici sono quelli standard, senza contare le icone degli oggetti che sono proprio messe a caso. Ad esempio i vestiti che si possono comprare non sono disegnati come delle gonne o pantaloni, no. E' una specie di freccia. ^^; Un oggetto consumabile curativo è disegnato come un fiocco rosa, che andava bene se fosse un accessorio per la principessa o l'altra ragazza, non certo per dare un pò di hp ad un personaggio. ^^; E come se l'autore non avesse voglia di limare queste imperfezioni, ma gli bastava completare la storia cosi come è. Ah ci sono 3 dungeon opzionali che vi consiglio di andarci solo intorno al 20 livello, prima, vi possono uccidere bellamente con un colpo solo. E solo in questi labirinti opzionali si trovano gli oggetti che vi permettono di modificare permanentemente le 4 voci, delle statistiche del personaggio: Ossia attacco, difesa, spirito e agilità. Non solo, in questi posti, una volta uccisi i mostri, non ritornano piu in vita. ^^;

A chi consigliare questo gioco ? Solo ai cacciatori di carte Steam, o a chi vuole fare un gdr in cui non si è costretti a grindare per milla mile ore per battere un boss. Ma solo a 40 centesimi, non di piu. Le quasi 4 euro sono un pò troppe, per ciò che promette ma che non sfrutta. Senza contare le non limature. Per tutti gli altri, potete passare oltre, ci sono giochi migliori fatti con rpg maker. ^_^",1548519563,1548521455,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The mouse controls were horrid and made it extremely difficult to play the game, and there was an option for keyboard but it was the typical ""WASD"" keys it was the Arrow keys and enter, having the option between the arrows or WASD would be awesome. 

The icon images for Ata (a party member), and the Minister of Science (A Main Character) were the sae just recoloured while a group of girls kidnapped and enchanted by Markus and had 2 lines each all had very distinctive icon images designed for them. 

The springwine in the tavern was a huge problem. I used the mouse controls up until this point and nothing I did would progress the game until I looked online and found out I had to hit ENTER on the keyboard. The only character you have to do this with. The controls shouldnt change for one character. 

The game rules also change when you enter Abyssal Palace suddenly the Adventures Jacket and Priestess Robes stop working with no warning and you have to use the Aerfae Armor. Its confusing.

There's also the problem with the characters overworld sprites not matching their battle image. Not the random baddies in a dungeon, but people like Markus, the Minister of Science, Ynza, and the Golathi have very specific overworld sprites before you enter battle with them. When your in the battle screen they're not even close to their overworld sprite. Ynza a female fairy turns into the human torch from the fantastic four, while the Minister of Science turns into a lion type beast. Not to mention that after you beat the Minister of Science's battle form, then it shows up in the next dungeon as a regular baddie.

If that alone bothers you, you've probably already made up your mind about this game.

It does use many stock assets, but the dungeons are nicely laid out.
My only complaint is that some of the icons don't really match the item they're associated with.

It's a little short but priced accordingly.
The story is a little simplistic but solid and consistent with the intended theme of the game.
There is no branching quests and only two optional dungeons.
Personally I wish the back story of the other main characters were fleshed out a little more. 
(What did Killian do to be pursued?)

The combat doesn't have as much ""grind"" as some JRPG games.

There is an interesting mechanic in the game, involving changing cloths to achieve various tasks.
One moment you may be dressing as a peasant to sneak past the guards, another you may be wearing a tribal outfit to pay respect to their chief. In dungeons and caves you have to wear your ""Adventure Cloths"" to jump and push large objects around.
This was a clever thing to put in the game.

2. Lack of entry to homes. There are a lot of house's that you can not enter(It doesn't matter anyways because there wont be anything to grab from them anyways.

4. This isnt much of a big deal but you can't use a controller to play this game. 
5. Music. I know I'm being a little picky but the music isn't great.
6. No map system. 
7. No side missions. 

If this game was free, i wouldn't be so harsh on it. But sadly, for paying 3 dollars and not getting much out of it just doesn't cut it for me. There are free game out there that would put this game to shame.

It wasn't bad or anything, but I honestly wouldn't recommend it to others.

Story - It's not complicated, and it is more or less complete, but it still felt a bit lacking. There's even a bit of info thrown out at one point that begged for at least a side quest, but then it's quickly forgotten and never mentioned again.

No Side Quests - Not a single one as far as I could tell. There were 3 optional dungeons, but they had no story or quest content whatsoever. Just a bunch of enemies, winding paths, and treasure chests. One of them has multiple floors leading you to a room with a door, and then . . . nothing. Just another regular battle and a few treasure chests.

Crappy Maps - They're just not good. Towns make horrible use of space. A lot of doors can't be entered, and the ones that do seem to be at random and lead to, at most, some unimportant NPC dialogue. This game really does not reward exploration. And the various dungeons are just narrow branching corridors with enemies and treasure chests almost never contain anything of value. There's like 2 puzzles in the game, and only barely. One of the optional dungeons has a ladder leading up, but you can't actually climb it. That same floor has an entire section that you can only see from a distance with enemies and treasure chests that you can't actually reach. I scoured everywhere on all of the floors you can visit, and nothing. 

Underutilized Features - You can switch outfits on the fly, and some of them have special abilities tied to them, and/or they change the way certain NPCs react to you. Except that for the most part they don't, and only 1 outfit has abilities you'll use in more than 1 dungeon. Speaking of NPC dialogue . . .

NPCs Never Change - There are a few event-related exceptions, but for the most part NPCs have one thing that they say/do throughout the entire game. That girl who's pretending to sleep on her lawn? No matter where in the game you are or what outfit you're wearing, nothing changes. Those tribesmen who tell you to go away? Even after you do the quest that makes you officially a friend of the tribe . . . they still want you to go away. Even if you wear the outfit you wear the outfit the chief himself gave you.

The Ending(no spoilers) - Basically, the ending sequence begins, takes a couple minutes to get through, and then it's over. And most of that time is spent on some NPC rather than, y'know, the characters you adventured with through most of the game. You don't really feel rewarded for completing the game.

It's functional. It's not overly challenging. It has a more or less complete story. But everything about it screams that it's a half-baked effort. If you just want something that scratches the itch and that you can finish in maybe 6 to 8 hours, you could do worse. But don't say I told you to get it, because I didn't. It's not total crap, but it's well below average. So . . . 3 out of 10? I think that's fair.",1463899162,1463899571,False,46,3,0.774640738964080811,0,True,False,False,False,,,
