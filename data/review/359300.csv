Some parts of it, like the story and art, seem as though they had a lot of effort put into them, if perhaps not that much skill. Likewise, it seems as though the developer may have dealt with some downright shadiness when it came to how Desura/IndieRoyale treated him. (as seen on his blog: http://singestudio.blogspot.fr/2015/08/final-comments.html )

On the other hand, the result is just a pile of crap that feels in many places as though the author had never played a side-scrolling shooter before, with wonky and giant hitboxes, a forced position in the middle of the screen that doesn't give you much time to react to enemies once you see them, enemies that are obscured by the distracting backgrounds, background objects that position themselves in front of enemies, controls that are never really explained, and long missions that you have to restart from the beginning if you die. The first ""side story"" is supposed to be a tutorial, but there doesn't seem to be any way to complete it or even get beyond the first screen, as the tutorial guy never continues talking after his first line.

So yeah. I hope the author doesn't swear off game development for good, but this was a terrible first effort in a lot of ways, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except people who are more patient with bad games than I am (and that's saying a lot...) and really want to play a game about the adventures of power-suited superheroes.

(I did not complete this - I spent about ten minutes fighting with the controls and the apparently broken tutorial, and then after several tries completed the first real level. I tried the second level once, but decided there was absolutely no way I was going to enjoy this and that I would just delete it and be done with it.)",1450757080,1450757296,False,4,0,0.566553354263305664,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Just outright amateur.  Everything might technically work, but the actual game in every aspect leaves your frustrated and confused as to how someone could create such a horrible product.

First of all, there's no fullscreen option, and there's no sound options, or basically anything useful, but it's not really a huge problem, since you can press ALT+ENTER and get fullscreen whenever you want.  I tried to press on 'button config' but it kept just bringing me back to the main menu.    Sometimes it will give you a screen which shows that it wants you to press a button and nothing seems to work, or in some cases if there is 20 lines of dialog it will all just instantly skip without any indication as to why or what you did, it just does things on it's own.  I tried recording some video, and I couldn't help but notice that the game goes fullscreen on it's own sometimes, by simply pressing 'A' alone after like the 5th screen it would go fullscreen everytime I tapped 'A'.  I'll give them credit for having controller support, but I give them no credit for making a playable game.  It's awful.  Played through the first level a few times now and it's sort of decently priced at launch ($2) but in my opinion, it's not really worth your time.  

The introductary prologue part I went to, clicked on once, it gave a date and a time on a black screen and then went back to the main menu instantly.  Upon choosing story mode it just shows that I successfully completed the prologue.  

Virtually every time you press a button on your controller you are wasting your time with this stupid broken game.  There is absolutely no hint of polish or video game development experience.

The game has a very good design, Well thinked (good idead the RPG beat'em up) but ... THERE ARE SO MANY ERRORS FROM THE PROGRAMMER!!
-First, woaw, the controls, very hard to changed them, if you have an attack, to put all the actions after, you'll have to put on this key ( you will see if you buy it )
-Then, I don't understand why aren't there border lines?? you can fall down and die instantly, why ???
-The characters are well designed and their skills are nice, but they are so unbalanced, some are very bad while other kill the level in 10 secs.
-The story levels are a bit long
-The big thing I don't understand is : why can we rush the level ? You can if you want, kill 0 ennemy and go to the next side of the level and win it (there are bosses but they are really easy whereas the based ennemies are skilled)
-The dialogs are a bit useless
PLEASE GUYS, This game can be good, work on it, it's a good idea, but please change some things I've said because even if it can be ""the gameplay"" that wants that, it's bad :/
I hope you'll ameliorate that.

Its hard, death will come, many, many.. many times. But you still get cash even when you die, so it won't be for nothing.
I like the music and feeling of destruction you make, especially when you level up a bit and go into lower zones.
Leveling up your char, and upgrading your abilities with special coins, which.. I still have to find out how to get.

I didn't like the dialogues to much, there is some humor in it. But it couldn't really keep my attention. 
Action feels a bit clumsy and the characters are unbalanced.
An additional note is that you can't play on fullscreen (although it still fills up until your taskbar).

So is it a taker? That's up to you, the price ain't that high. And if your into this sort of games, there is plenty of hours of gameplay to put in.
