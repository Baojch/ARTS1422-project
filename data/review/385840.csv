[h1]""It really grows on you.""[/h1]

It would be very easy to label The Beard in the Mirror as a throwback to the early years of adventure gaming, so I’ll do just that. The Beard in the Mirror is a throwback to the early years of adventure gaming, resplendent in its simple pixel graphics and dumb icon interface. It very much wants to roost among the classics, specifically Sierra’s seminal library. To this end, it offers you a points system that rewards you for extracurricular puzzle solving, and even provides a myriad of ways for your character to meet his humourous end. However, it is, after all, a modern game aping a classic, so rather than smugly kill you off and banish you back to your last save, it describes how you would have died before backtracking you to your poorly-made decision and hopes hindsight has provided you some wisdom.

It’s the story of Paul, an aimless twenty-something trying to find some direction in life after leaving home and graduating college. He’s awoken one morning by a strange girl at his bedside who claims to know him, but he holds no memory of. Distraught at not being recognised, the girl flees, and Paul chalks this night-time visit up as a particularly vivid dream. This mindset is challenged when he awakes and finds himself locked in his room. After ransacking the place to locate a key, he finds his bedroom door now leads to a forest path he’s pretty certain wasn’t there the morning before. Neither was the angry guy, waiting in ambush, who accuses Paul of numerous crimes he considers himself completely incapable of performing.

Paul doesn’t remember the world he’s forced to explore, but the world seems to remember him. The majority of the adventure is trying to make sense of that, and finding his place inside the chaos of it all. Though this sounds like quite a heavy task, Paul spends most of his journey unable to comprehend the weight of it all. Much of the game makes fun of his inability to treat his situation with the gravity it deserves. For example, when forced to ransack his room looking for a solution to the locked door, you’ll quickly find his favourite crowbar, spray-painted pink and lovingly adorned with a frilly bow. You’d think this the ideal tool for prying open his door and securing his freedom, but he’s very attached to his crowbar and doesn’t want to risk chipping the paintjob.

To the credit of the developer, there’s a kind of absurdist humour running roughshod throughout. A local cobbler finds the idea that someone isn’t interested in his exquisite wares so impossible, he takes disinterest in his goods as a genius bargaining ploy, and haggles himself into oblivion. Guards that show no interest in gatekeeping new areas behind routine fetch quests are cross-examined by Paul for not living up to the trope correctly. It’s all pretty light-hearted, until the reasons Paul can’t remember anything starts to become apparent wherein, well, it’s still pretty light-hearted. But there’s certainly a shift in tone as the game processes; it never forgets that it’s a goofball at heart that’s asking you to make your way through a foreign world, solving all of life’s problems with whatever rubbish you’ve managed to cram into your pockets, but it also never forgets how things started. With a mystery.

The Beard in the Mirror makes you work towards the answers you’ll find, but it doesn’t drag them out. With around a four hour lifespan, it’s never going to compare in size with some of the goliaths of old, but it doesn’t need to. It knows the story it wants to tell, and that story gets told. It fleshes out a world that shouldn’t exist, finishing a fable that it never really starts and shunts Paul begrudgingly along into adulthood. It also provides three unique uses for vegan-produced vegetable-flavoured gumballs. That’s a remarkable achievement in itself.

We have a fun little plotline involving time travel, and some surprisingly memorable characters make an appearance!  A nice dash of humor keeps the tone of the game light, but ultimately the story was the driving force that kept me playing.

I played this game about a year ago, and every time I scroll past it in my library, I get a little nostalgic for it.  It really left a very positive impression on me.  I am definitely going to end up playing through this one several more times.

The Beard in the Mirror is a fantasy adventure game made by 2 people over a long time: it's a work of love but it's a work that was done on limited resources: the artwork could use some additional detail and shading, many things were not animated and many of the scenes were largely empty.

The story is a good take on ""stranger in a strange land"" but there were several points where the solution to puzzles were not very believable. The conversations were all right but there wasn't much depth to the world. There are some funny one-liners.

All in all, a good old-school point-and-click adventure, I'm glad I played it but there's not much replay value. Recommended to any fan of the genre.

Note: like others mentioned, I ran into issues with the game resolution. Keep in mind, that this is an old AGS adventure so it's display support is not as up-to-date as the current version of AGS. Windowed mode with 4x scaling worked for me; none of the full-screen ones did. If you have issues during start-up, run the winsetup utility that sits in the game folder to configure resolution.",1581963274,1581963568,True,0,0,0.497118145227432251,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I am a fan with equal appreciation for Sierra and LucasArts titles.  The Beard in the Mirror has a Sierra type interface with the humor of a LucasArts adventure.  The graphics and animation are high quality, although the game fades to black whenever a sophisticated animation would have been required and ends up wrecking the immersion.  There are ways to die, but the rather than forcing you restore a previous save, the game allows you to rewind and make alternate choices.  There are a couple of timed and arcade sequences.  Be careful and save often because I ran in to a situation where the rewind feature restored the game state with only a few seconds left on the timer and made it almost impossible to progress without extreme precision.  I was able to perform the correct maneuver after multiple attempts, but it would have been less stressful if I had a save game that left me with more time on the clock.

The writing for the game was edited well.  I did not find any typos or translation errors that are typical of indie releases.  The music was adequate -- it doesn't have a soundtrack that I would listen to outside of the game itself.  I did not earn the maximum amount of points in my initial playthrough, and I have not yet decided if I want to try again and earn them all.  I don't believe that the missing points will have much of an impact on the narrative or experience.

Should you play this game?  If you are a fan of point & click adventures, then yes.

I don't mind the old fashioned 16-bit pixelated graphics.  The graphics just felt nostalgic and normal for a P&C adventure game to me.  They really went all out with making it feel retro as they offer a modern take on the old fashioned ""hint-line"" but instead you can send them a message.  That played both against and in favor of this game for me.  On the one hand I'm not an 8 year old kid with all summer to figure out a puzzle anymore... so if I get stuck I'd like to be able to look for a quick hint or walkthrough so I can keep going without having to send a message and wait for response.  On the other hand being stuck with something (can't remember what now) led me to the one semi-walkthrough video which was a livestream on YouTube where he reads the text out loud for you and gives the characters voices... his voices were almost more fun than playing the game myself.  So yeah, be aware there isn't really a walkthrough if you get stuck but if you have the time to try different combinations and click through various items on the screen you should be able to get there eventually without one.  Most of the puzzles are pretty easy, the game largely leads you from one thing to another.

There is a lot of humor in the game and in Sierra-esque style it has some humorous deaths but I gotta be honest it's more cheesy humor.  The whole game feels like King's Quests cheesy 3rd cousin, the dialogue especially gets quite cheesy.  However the overall story isn't bad.  It's a guy out of his element, there's some time travel, there's magic, sword fights, romance... for a fairly short game it actually packs quite a lot in and considering the budget they made it with it's pretty good all around but you might find yourself cringing at some of the more cheesy awkward parts.

If you already like retro P&C Adventure games give this one a shot you'll probably enjoy it.  If you're new to the Genre maybe stick with a classic like the King's Quest or Monkey Island series as your introduction.",1540973250,1541006105,True,2,0,0.489408284425735474,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The two games couldn't be more different in story, but where Broken Age had a much larger production budget and a lot more flash to it, you find that isn't as necessary with these types of adventures as long as you enjoy the journey.

I loved the old Sierra games when I was a kid, and I felt right at home when I loaded this game up and played through.  The story itself would have been right at home in that era if not for some of the more modern influences/reflections (Which don't detract from the story).

I've read some reviews and some people are expecting Lucasarts-in-their-prime level storytelling from a 2 person development team, but that would be a mistake.

The graphic design is very basic and probably its biggest draw back.  If the story was engaging, I could over look this, but nothing was really speaking to me :(

It especially delights in letting you get killed in ridiculous Sierra-esque ways but does so with a modern sensibility: you won't lose progress and there are no apparent unwinnable states. 

BitM's puzzles just drip with the classic 90s silliness, but in a way where one step usually clearly leads you to the next. They often feel every bit as silly as Gabriel Knight 3's infamous cat-hair mustache puzzle, but far less demanding of absurd leaps of moon-logic. The least intuitive of the puzzles, in fact, are often one-step solutions that, if all else fails, can be brute-forced. The more complex the puzzle, the more clearly the solution comes together. It's gratifying to play a game that feels like it belongs in that classic milieu without throwing away what we've learned about accessibility and fairness in game design.

The story itself is probably the weakest link -- a suitable but convoluted and sometimes confusing magic-fueled romp through time and space. It's not the sort of thing I'd make a franchise of, but it's a decent frame for a fun fan-letter to classic adventures. This is the first point-and-click from ""Oh, a Rock!""

The game is short (and I take forever to finish games). But I also finished this quickly because I really enjoyed playing this.

An ordinary, somewhat shy guy gets whisked away to a fantasy land and tasked with a quest that he neither understands much of or feels up to - but nevertheless sets out on this unexpected journey of discovery and growth. Along the way he'll make friends and enemies. He'll meet some crazies and non-human forms of inteligent life. As you'd expect from a fantasy tale, there's swords, magical creatures - and love. But all of that has its own unique flavor, specific to the creators -- a wife and a husband -- and the flerd between Paul and Lily feels all the more personal and adorkable for that. The game itself leans to the comedic side, and the puzzles especially require some unorthodox, out-of-the-box thinking -- but while the solutions might not be evident at once, they're fair and require only that you mind your surroundings and inventory. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and while I've never played King's Quest or Simon the Sorcerer (which, I think, might've been major inspirations), as a LucasArts adventure fan I some of my favorite things out of it, too.

Pros:
- the old-school graphics! Today's mainstream where games seem to revel in being hi-res festivals of murkiness -- and I love me some pixels and saturated, juicy colors
- the comedy - I've always preferred the funny point&clicks with odd-ball characters, and this one has plenty
- the heart - the game's a passion project that was made on and off for 10 years! You have to admire this kind of devotion!

Cons:
- there's one Click Time Event that I found annoying (but the creators say there's an option to skip it if you've failed twice)
- one puzzle leads to a dead end after much effort taken, which seems a bit unfair (but the actual solution isn't far away, actually)",1488276506,1488276506,True,5,0,0.569249749183654785,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It took me about 4 hours to play through, which I consider to be a good length for the $10 price.  The story starts off a bit confusing, however it does make sense as you play through.  An interesting take on an ""amnesic character"" in a strange land.

The puzzles were not overly simple but never lead to my being so confused that I couldn't finish.  After completing the story I felt satisfied, and its got a nice lead up for a sequel which I'd be glad to buy if they make it.

If you're a fan of old-school adventures with a fantasy setting I'd definately recommend it.",1477586052,1477586052,True,15,1,0.684160590171813965,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I am not very far yet but Ill stick with it for a bit and update my review-

I am still having issues with FULLSCREEN--
 I get an error when trying to go to full screen mode REGARDLESS of my selections in the AGS tool... I even installed AGS and no... the best I can do is get it to run at 1280 x 800 in a window- unchecking the window box simply causes an error message to display-
