It's extremely shallow and has no merit or value as a PC game for dedicated gamers.

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

A choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel ""art"" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics. It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.

There's no options to change the resolution for the mobile app or customise the graphics settings. There's no way for gamers to ensure this mobile app is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this mobile app will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision. There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality mobile phone graphics.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff. The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction. You'll get none of that here.

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies. Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for. These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this. The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game. Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone. I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

You don't have to take my word about how bad the mobile app is, we can measure the interest in a game by how much people bothered to play it. GoBlock's Impossible Medley has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the mobile app absolutely failed to capture any interest from gamers. The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for traveling 2000m in the game (this takes just a few minutes), but only around 1 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the mobile app. That's a tiny, tiny proportion of gamers who even bothered with this. Ouch.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this mobile app was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the mobile app. But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show only 1 percent of players bothered playing the mobile app for any reasonable amount of time. How is it possible for this mobile app to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing it? Trading cards. Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game. That tells us people only really bought this mobile app for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality. A closer look at the numbers shows the mobile app just has a couple of players every week running up the mobile app and idling it for cards, then deleting it. We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $1 USD, on app stores, it's free. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a premium for a free mobile game just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam. This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers. Because this can be played free elsewhere, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1705583334,1705583334,True,1,0,0.455958545207977295,0,True,False,False,True,,,

I'm not a huge fan of endless runners but [i]GoBlock's Impossible Medley[/i] was so addicting that I unlocked everything in one multi-hour session and lost my good night's sleep in the process.

[h1][i]Geometry Dash[/i] and [i]Flappy Bird[/i] had a relay race[/h1]

Keys are as simple as they get: only ""jump"" is used. Up to four people can easily play on the same computer in split-screen mode.

[i]Medley[/i] itself consists of three, recurring stages with randomized sections:

[list]
[*]First ""block"" section is the traditional one from the likes of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/]Geometry Dash[/url] and [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/63710/]BIT.TRIP RUNNER[/url] of jumping over obstacles and spikes while staying on track.
[*]""Flappy mode"", you know it, has constant gravity but jumps allow ""flapping"" (jumping) in the air, while rendering timing of the flaps the most important factor of all in survival.
[*]In the rolling mode jump key controls the direction of gravity.
[/list]

If you're familiar with [i]Geometry Dash[/i], the three stages are rather similar to it. In the regular game mode, the stage changes smoothly but flashily every 20 seconds or so.

While the mode transition looks cool, the resulting mode announcement is distracting and can get in the way of the obstacles and result in a quick death.

If you'd like, you can also choose to play endless runner of a single mode. However, it won't allow unlocking new skins that double as achievements.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

Different skins do not have any effect on play. However, they are tastefully created renditions of familiar video game and/or pop culture characters.

Visual style is simplistic but the game rolls smoothly and feels extremely polished. The level design and hit boxes feel almost perfectly fair: you almost always know that it was you, the player, who messed up that run.

Almost: thrice in my 2.5 hours of gameplay I ran into a position in the ""block"" section that because of the transition and the stage being so close to the bottom of the screen I could not see how the level progressed. This was the only unfair part of the gameplay that I saw.

There's only one tune (that I could notice anyway) that gets faster and faster the farther you survive. It's a splendid, varied tune though.

[h1]Conclusions[/h1]

Playing solo, I got all unlockables in 2.5 hours - a decent lifetime for a $1 game. Fun and addicting, I couldn't put it down before unlocking everything.

But I eventually did. Someone who especially likes endless runners would definitely get more out of it while striving for highscores.

+ The gameplay is incredibly addicting. This is a endless runner similar to the likes of Geometry Dash or The Impossible Game where the level auto-scrolls and you must jump when neccessary. However, in Impossible Medley there are three different game modes combined together, block mode, flappy mode, and gravity mode which helps add a lot of variety tot he game.
+ Very challenging, as you progress the game gets faster and faster as the obstacles get even more difficult.
+ Precise controls. I used an xbox one controller and i never once felt like there was any input lag 
+ 4 player local multiplayer
+ Great soundtrack
