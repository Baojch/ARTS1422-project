[h1] Story [/h1] Das Spiel ist aufgebaut wie eine Theatervorstellung. In der Kleinstadt ""Cypress Knee"" in Florida hat sich ein abgetakelter Schauspieler selbst erhangen. Wir spielen 3 verschiedene Protagonisten um den Fall genauer zu Untersuchen. Einmal die junge Bloggerin ""Romana ""Phaedra"" Teague, die nicht gerade auf den Mund gefallen ist. Einen Journalisten mit nicht so guter Vergangenheit namens ""Jack Bellet"" & einen Detektiv namens ""K.C. Gaddis"" der eigentlich sein Leben schon selbst beenden wollte, dann aber diesen Fall animmt. Was steckt hinter diesen Mysteri√∂sen Selbstmord? Das m√ºssen unsere 3 Protagonisten herausfinden

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Das Gameplay selbst ist relativ simpel. Es gibt 3 Akte. Man spielt abwechselnd die 3 verschiedenen Protagonisten und sehen die Geschichte aus deren Sicht. Die Charaktere bewegen sich automatisch von Szene zu Szene und reden mit verschiedenen Personen. Wir m√ºssen im Prinzip immer 1 von 3 oder manchmal auch 4 verschiedenen Antwort M√∂glichkeiten ausw√§hlen. Diese Auswahl hat auch Leichte Konsequenzen, wie NPCs im weiteren Spielverlauf auf die Protagonisten reagieren. Es gibt auch ein paar R√§tsel zu l√∂sen, diese sind aber sehr einfach & simpel gehalten. Man kann in seinem ""Journal"" auch jederzeit Informationen zu Personen, Themen & Orte nachlesen die sich nach und nach freischalten. Leider gibt es auch ein paar Bugs, diese sind aber nicht weiter wild oder Gamebreaking. z.B. sind manchmal Personen unsichtbar oder drehen bzw. laufen immer im Kreis herum w√§hrend sie mit uns reden. In den Minispielen/R√§tsel setzt sich manchmal ein Puzzleteil fest und man kann kein anderes mehr Ausw√§hlen (raus tappen aus dem Spiel und dann wieder rein gehen hilft aber dabei). Das Voice Acting ist sehr gut gelungen und die Charaktere sind interessant

[h1] Achievements [/h1] Es gibt insgesamt 43 Erfolge. Einige sind Story basierend. Die meisten sind Entscheidungsbedingt und man muss das Spiel mindestens 3 mal durchspielen (zumindest fast) um alle Erfolge zu bekommen. Z.B. muss man mit allen 3 Protagonisten immer die Spezielle Antwort Ausw√§hlen oder wenn man √ºber ein Thema schreibt muss man auch hier immer im selben Stil schreiben. Es gibt aber auch einen sehr guten Guide in der Community dazu

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ Sehr Gute Story
+ Spannend
+ Gute & Interessante Charaktere
+ Man kann viel √ºber die Lore nachlesen
+ Gutes Voice Acting
+ Nette kleine R√§tsel/Minispiele
+ Achievements
+ Sammelkarten
+ XBox 360 Controller Support

- Ein paar kleinere Bugs wie z.B. Unsichtbare Charaktere oder Fehler bei den Minispielen sodass sich Puzzleteile festsetzten (aus dem Spiel rein & raus tappen hilft)

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein wirklich sch√∂nes Hidden Gem im Adventure Genre. Es hat mir sehr gut gefallen und es war mal was anderes durch eine Theatervorstellung eine Murder Mystery aufzukl√§ren, einfach mal eine nette Idee. Auch die kleinen R√§tsel/Minispiele haben mir sehr gut gefallen. Den Gr√∂√üten Lob verdienen hier aber die Voice Actor, die machen hier einen wirklich fantastischen Job. Ich kann es jedem Adventure Fan sehr ans Herz legen. Eindeutige Kauf Empfehlung, es lohnt sich sehr

Reminded me a lot of the old ""Choose your own Adventure"" books, but with a twist...

The game is presented as if you where watching a play in a theater, quickly moving from set to set, where the different parts of the story take place. 

You control the responses of the 3 main characters, each one arriving at the story because of different reasons and motivations and back stories (which you help build). 

The character you control goes to different locations at each one talking or discovering something new, as far as interactivity goes, you only select their responses from a list.

After a little while you are required to choose between the stuff youve discovered and report/publish the one you consider the best one, and with what tone your report is written.

The game feels really unique in the sense that all the conversations and reports have consequences, like if you decide to publish an article bad mouthing the police you might have difficulty accessing a location, or if you insult someones beliefs he wont be as forthcoming with information... but reporting a tamer article wont help you with your boss that wants clicks... Its awesome to feel that almost every response impacts how the game story is presented to me, i close a door, but open a window kinda stuff... seems really well thought off.

Voice acting is great, performance was acceptable, music is really good totally fits and helps the environment.

The story is interesting and although it starts a bit slow it quickly picks up and putting together the different stories and figuring how it all fits together held my attention for more time than i expected.

I havent finished the game, but what ive played has been quite good.

There are three main characters whom you can control: a traditional journalist, a social media journalist/blogger and a private investigator. Each of them investigate the same unusual case of an actor who died in the small town of Cypress Knee, Florida. The people you meet vary from quirky local personalities and politicians to movie crew and a leader of a peculiar religious group. Needless to say every people have their own agendas and secrets. So do the main characters. You get to make their dialogue - and other - choices for them and define their morals by doing so.

Knee Deep is an entertaining 'choices matter' game with 3 protagonists where you play out an act on a moving stage with an audience. I highly recommend it if you want a very different and unique but still great mystery-adventure game.


[h1]Story synopsis[/h1]

I wont talk too much about the story, but here is the synopsis: You play through the game as 3 different protagonists, 1 blogger/journalist, 1 journalist and 1 detective. All 3, through different circumstances, are investigating a suicide in Cypress Knee, but they quickly learn that there's more to the incident than meets the eye, and soon more questions and mysteries are revealed than answers.
That's all I can really say about the story as I do not want to spoil anything.


[h1]Voice acting, sound effects, music[/h1]

The voice actors in this game are absolutely brilliant, they all do a fantastic job, the accents, how they bring the characters alive, it's all amazing.

The soundtrack is very good, it helps so much with the atmosphere, each scene has a soundtrack that perfectly explains what's currently happening on stage.

The game has amazing ambiance and sound effects, it was very calming and just amazing throughout the game: ambient water sound, crickets, frogs, faint wind, and lets not forget the audience.
The audience was the cherry on top that I didn't expect. They gasp, laugh and cheer at certain scenes, in-between each scene you can hear them cough, clear their throats, re-position in their seats, chat a bit, etc. It helped so much with the atmosphere and it sounds very good.


[h1]The gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay in and of itself is fairly simple, and I absolutely recommend you play it laid back with a controller. All you do is move the thumb-stick a bit and press A, B, X or Y to select a decision.

Each dialog has several different dialog-choices that impact the story with good and bad consequences, whether that be immediately or long-term or that can bite a character in the back much later into the game.

When playing a game like this where you're playing/acting out a literal play it is important to remember that you're not looking to make the ""correct"" choices. You can pretend you're the director or writer or something, you're in part making a story as you go. The choices you make aren't right or wrong, the choices you make is just that and nothing else, choices; playing out the scenes as you go, don't sit around trying to find which dialog option to pick to get a ""good ending"" or something. Pick what [b]you[/b] want to pick, chose the option that creates a better story or scene for you.

Something I'd like to mention is that Act 3(the last act) was head and shoulders above Act 1 and 2.
This is not to say that Act 1 and 2 were bad, it just means that Act 3 was very good, so while playing if you're starting to lose interest a bit I encourage you to stick around for the last act.
[i]Of course you may disagree, it is merely my opinion and you may have a different experience.[/i]

[h1]Ending words[/h1]

I absolutely recommend it. It is a very enjoyable adventure game, it's very unique and sets itself apart from the rest in a great way.

The game takes about 5 hours to complete, and it has a lot of re-play ability because choices in this game actually do make a difference.

The best part were the strange/belligerent/cynical response options from each of the playable characters.

I'm not going to post any spoilers here, mostly because spoilers might require some form of logical progression of events that this game so utterly lacks. 

The dialogue is okay, but the plot is unbelievably bad. Dumpster fire bad. So bad that at one point they they have a character starting an exposition pointing out how nonsensical the central conspiracy is, but rather than doing something clever with it, the writers just leave it hanging there like: ""Yeah, we now this sucks but... *crickets*""

Now, when I say the plot is bad, I don't mean the fact that you're presented with options that pretend to affect the course of the story but really don't (e.g. choose to save the life of character A and the game pretends you chose to rescue character B like you were supposed to). No, that's the kind of disappointment we're all used to from the genre. 

What I mean is that the plot leaves me asking a lot of questions. Questions such as: ""why did I keep punishing myself after Act 1?"" and ""how on Earth does this game have 82% positive reviews?!"" Questions that, I fear, may never receive an answer.

The developers chose to turn the game into a theater stage. This is fine, but has little effect other than creating unnecessarily long cut scenes. More generally, the fact that you can't save the game at all outside of randomly sprinkled autosave points puts you at great risk of having to play through sections again, which is even more boring than the first time around. If, however, you for some reason *do* want to go back and replay a section, well, you're just shit out of luck and have to replay the entire Act. 

And let's not even consider trying to get all the achievements, which would require us to sit for hours to click through the entire game, not once, not twice, but a minimum three FULL playthroughs from start to finish.

Silver lining: ""Give a strange answer"" for every dialogue choice as Romana.

What I got was the swamp noir and the stage play aesthetic, but also so much more. Unlike a lot of other adventure games, the focus is on characters and the story and not on puzzles.

It reminds me a lot of Telltale Games titles especially with the way it presents dialogue choices and the way that it tells you how characters react to your choices, but it doesn't feel like it's merely a clone of those games. I like that you don't have to click around to make characters move around and interact, so the progression is relatively automatic. You can just focus on the important things. 

The stage play stylings help set it apart and make it unique. The visual style and animations in general feels a bit unpolished, but in a way that fits the setting and aesthetic. The characters are quirky and interesting and the fact that you switch between several of them as you progress is a nice touch. The story was much different than I expected, but in a good way. When I got to the end, I was feeling satisfied and curious about some of the options that I didn't make. 

Overall, a really enjoyable adventure game experience that was different enough from the usual ones I play and I can't recommend it enough.

I love narrative-based games and adventure games, and I frankly don't even mind when they're light on the ""adventure"" part. I'll dabble in visual novels. I even play one of those ridiculous ""Choices"" games on my cell phone.

So when I read about Knee Deep, a narrative mystery game with a noir vibe, multiple storylines, and choosing dialogue as a central gameplay mechanism, I was on board.

Where it went right: The overall mood of the piece was spot-on. Florida swamps, private investigators, a flop actor suicide, dramatic lighting--all of this combined to create a look and feel that I very much enjoyed. The story is actually presented as a play on an impossibly enormous stage, which... kind of worked, and kind of didn't. More on that later. Additionally, you can formulate reports and articles from your findings throughout the game--another feature I liked in concept, but not execution.

[b]Where it went wrong: Everywhere else.[/b]

[list]
    [*][b]Dialogue in General[/b]: I had to mention this first because dialogue is pretty much the main point of this game. Since you can't move your characters, explore scenes, or do much of anything besides choose what your characters say, the dialogue needed to be perfect. And it wasn't. It was clunky and unnatural, even if you factor in that the story is wrapped in a play wrapped in a game.
[*][b]Dialogue Option Clarity[/b]: Firstly, each of the listed options are shorthand (for the sake of brevity), but that makes it unclear what you're choosing when you select and option. It reminded me a little of [i]Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy[/i], for those of you who have played that. For example, your dialogue option might just be the word ""gone,"" so you'll select it, thinking you're asking ""Where did the guy go?"" and instead, your character will say ""Get out of here, you jerk!"" There's no indication whether your response will be incendiary or friendly, so you just have to hope for the best. Again, since the whole game is about what your characters say, this needed to be refined.
[*][b]Dialogue Writing[/b]: Alongside dialogue options that are misleading and can come off as abrupt, the game fails to provide authentic-sounding dialogue. As another reviewer cleverly noted, perhaps this is a meta thing where the dialogue is supposed to be bad because the entire story is being put on as a play, but even if that were the case, it took me out of it.
[*][b]Character-specific dialogue quirks[/b]: If you're not sure what to say (which I never really was, courtesy of the difficult-to-decipher options mentioned above), you can make your character say their trademark dialogue ""thing."" The blogger gives a ""strange"" response (usually some odd non-sequitur), the reporter gives a ""belligerent"" response (something I hesitated to use in case it influenced the story in a negative way), and the P.I. gives a ""cynical"" response (which, again, I hesitated to use in case it prevented me from getting actual answers that might help unravel the mystery). These could be funny, but they felt like filler that gave you an illusion of control over the story direction, but nothing else. 
    [*][b]Sound[/b]: While the music was fine (even atmospheric), every single character (""actor"") recording sounded like they had reverb on for the entire game. I think this was supposed to simulate the acoustics of speaking on stage. I see a lot of theater, and all this effect did was make it sound like the characters were talking in a bathroom or a cave, not in a big theater house. 
    [*][b]Puzzles[/b]: There should never have been puzzles in this game. Or there should have been more puzzles. Or harder ones. Puzzles don't fit with the meta ""we're in a play"" concept in the first place, and the puzzles they did include were simple but time-wasting. Either beef up the puzzles or cut them out entirely--and I'd suggest the latter. This game should stop pretending to be an adventure game. 
[*][b]The stage[/b]: Oh, boy. The stage. At first, the idea of all the action being performed as a play appealed to me. I love theater, and I'm into metanarratives. But the stage in the game is ENORMOUS. When the game's camera zooms out to approximately where the front of the stage would be, the actual houses/characters/action are so far away that, in real life, you probably couldn't even see them with opera glasses. To move the characters from place to place, the game has them get on a weird metal contraption that jerks and slides them around like some part in a factory assembly line until it finally delivers them to the next scene. This was unnecessary, and it make scene switches take longer than the scenes themselves. Why do the whole ""theater"" concept if the game is intent on constantly taking you out of the plausibility zone?
[*][b]The... Greek Chorus?[/b]: Especially in acts 2 and 3, the game repeatedly employs minor townspeople to perform a series of rhyming couplets to deliver foreboding messages to the audience. I assume this was to put them in the role of a Greek Chorus, but wow, it did not work. If they wanted to fit with the noir vibe, why not have a couple of shady characters tail the action and end each act with them commenting to each other on what had gone on? Why have all the townspeople recite poetry? Not good.
[*][b]The Reports[/b]: Having your characters write reports and articles should have been the best part of the game, but it fell flat. Each time something big happens, you're supposed to write up a summary by selecting a piece of information and a ""spin"" on it. Depending on how harsh you are, you can make friends or enemies with your commentary, and you can disappoint/delight your boss. This feature really wasn't quite rich enough, and although I only played the game through once, I wonder how much of an effect your report choices [i]truly[/i] have on the overall story. 
[*][b]The Plot[/b]: Much like the stage, the plot became too big for its own good. I don't really want to reveal plot points in case anyone decides to play, but what could have been a simple, cool story grows into something totally absurd, with too many un-followable connections and too many characters doing things that don't make any sense. The twist at the end of the game was the part that finally threw me over the edge: [spoiler]Local woman/church member tries to chop off her son's arm to give to a church/cult leader who recently had his corpse reanimated. Yep. Sudden zombie.[/spoiler]. At that point, any hope I'd had for this game having merit was completely gone. And I even like [spoiler]supernatural[/spoiler] elements!
[/list]

TLDR: Dialogue wheel. Odd setting. Short duration. Feels disjointed. Lacks immersion. On rails progression. Poor puzzles. Best avoided.

This is a simple game in which NPCS go from hotspot to hotspot, engage in conversation, then you can tweet about what you heard as if you were some kind of blogger/journalist. 

Seems whoemever made this had an affinity for for millenials and their mindset, and had some interest in cults and hollywood. It has some strong points. The camera work, and the character moving about a theatre set were not altogether bad ideas.

The mechanic of choosing which topic to publish and how edgy to be was not very good, and I often kind of lost track of what I was even trying to investigate.

Eventually I ended up triggering one of the game's rare puzzles, and it would not allow me to skip or cancel it, leaving me stuck. I am honestly not all that thrilled due to the lack of immersion.

The bad:
- Dialogues and monologues are very very confusing - very often you don't know which one to chose because none of them make any sense - just look at the screenshots.
- Rhyming monologues here and there - totally unnecessary and not essential for the story - seems like a way to make it look more theatrical, nothing more
- Puzzles - no effort whatsoever - insulting
- Boring mini-stage animations when the character goes on a mini-stage that transfers them to a new scene - why?
- Act 2 feels rushed and act 3 is full of cliches. We've seen it all before...

The idea of it being a play is original and fun. But it doesn't really work for me and the novelty soon wore off. And bad acting in games ruins the experience for me. At least if the acting had been good I could've just enjoyed this as a sort of movie/play, but seriously, lines are delivered as if the actor has no idea what what they are saying or what the words mean, with inlection in all the wrong places. If I was being kind I'd say that it's a stage play so the actors are deliberately bad within the fiction. But that wouldn't make it any more enjoyable.

You fix this bug by simply restarting the game.  

I was definitely on the fence when I saw this on sale for $9.99, especially with some of the bad reviews.  The first two chapters are certainly well done and had me thinking that the negative reviews were way off.  But then the 3rd Act came and I was stunned at how truly off the rails the story went.  They really jumped the shark on Act 3, from a dog driving a tractor to a zombie priest trying to get the arm of a little boy to regenerate and his mom being a willing accomplice seemingly from nowhere.  So when a good story has a bad third act, it really makes you question whether you enjoyed the experience or not.  I still am not sure.

Most of the experience is picking from 1 to 4 dialogue choices and from  choosing from 1 of several stories to report to the blog, print, or your boss.  This game mechanic is completely forgotten in Act Three because they are all unemployed by then (seriously).  There's a few puzzles thrown in, but they are very easy.  What makes this a good game is the writing (it's really strong throughout minus some questionable plot choices in the 3rd Act and some repeating gags that weren't all that funny).  This is a mostly good story with lots of details on all the characters, giving the story life.   ACG gave this a wait for sale and mentioned no voice acting, but in fact there is voice acting now.  It's not the best voice actors, but they get the job done or at least I've heard worse.  Obviously, the animations are not the best when the actors are reading the lines.  And in the Final Act, the animations got even worse.  The zombie guy I couldn't even see.  So he wasn't really a zombie, more like the invisible man.  

I think VR definitely made this game interesting for me.  It's fun seeing all the sets and you feel like you are part of the audience.  I don't think I would have enjoyed this game without VR.  Just don't expect the best visuals, they are passable but with VR it just makes it more immersive.  I wish TellTale wold make their games VR as that would make those games a lot better experiences as well.

Anyways, I do recommend this game on sale for 50% off.  I spent over 6 hours to finish this tale of murder, conspiracy, and investigative journalism/blogging/PI/gators.  It was just such a let down at the end that it left a bitter taste in my mouth.

However, after playing for an hour I had to stop. It's worth pointing out that in over 30 years of gaming, this is the first game I've ever requested a refund for because I knew I would I never give it another go.

The premise of the story itself is an interesting one and the idea of everything playing out as some kind of stage production is unique and clever idea. This soon becomes incredibly boring and moving from one scene to the next breaks up the flow of the story and detracts from the narrative. The story shifts from one scene to the next with such a frequency (and also back and forwards in time as the characters are interviewed after the events) that it's difficult follow what's going on and remain interested.

There is also no real gameplay as such. It's simply clicking on a choice of what to ask or what to reply with in a conversation. You also get to choose what sort of spin you publish your blog/article/report.

I feel that this game is better suited for mobile devices where you can just pick it up when you have some time to kill, touch the choices on the sceen and move on to the next part of the story. Sitting in front of my PC trying to stay engrossed in this was difficult.

I'm sure this type of game will appeal to some, but for those that like a point-and-click, use item on..., puzzle solving type adventure will be dissappointed. I really wanted to like this and I gave it my best shot. But this is just my opinion and with all games it depends on the player.

Visually, this game is a bit of a travesty. Exactly half a step up from the N64. (I'm not critisizing the art direction itself. Just the actual assets.) Every character looks like a slightly melted plastic doll and I tried fiddling with lighting options but it still came off as way too dark way too often. 

HOWEVER! I like looking at this game as more of a book than anything else, with the characters and events being nothing more than a visual representation. The ""play"" aesthetic helped build on that. Every setpiece both felt real when flushed out and wonderfully fake like when actually watching something move on broadway. 

The story itself keeps growing in a really great way. The start is slow, but since we never stop ramping things up I always want to know what happens next to the characters or to the town or to the side characters. 

My involvement in the story actually felt genuine. Like I was the one making things happen in this performance and the performance then had to cater to my decision and keep the story going from there. 

I would reccomend this game, I would. I doubt a higher end computer than my own would make it run better. Though, there's a scene where everyone is running and the frame rate actually felt like it went higher than 20 for that. So that's good. 

This game is more for people who like a good story than having a game to play. You won't get a lot out of this game if you spend too much time looking at things or expect a lot of action.

It's fast-paced, the writing is witty and the overarching story is intriguing enough for you to go ""so what's really happening here?"", but that veneer quickly devolves into absurdity for the sake of absurdity. What was fast-paced becomes jarring, some scenes in Act 2 and 3 last less than 30 seconds and doesn't progress the story at all, and is essentialy a punchline. This might not sound too bad but since Knee Deep presents itself as a play, there's the curtains drawing to fade in and out, which ends up being longer than the actual scene. It's hard to describe just how unnatural this feels but it really screws with the progression and pacing of the story. 

Act 1 is a little bizarre but there's enough loose ends to go ""this can end in a satisfying way by answering my questions"" but Knee Deep answers questions by just killing off characters for the sake of being weird. Did you ever write stories when you were really young and you'd have all these cool ideas but you'd blow your load all at once because of how exciting it was to get those ideas out there and it ends up being this mess of excitment, confusion and cum. That's the best way I can describe Knee Deep. It's a big confusing mess of a story that feels really incomplete and rushed from its middle to end. I can't really recommend this to anyone... Maybe if you really like David Lynch but don't want any of the foreshadowing and artistic integrity that comes with most Lynch stories. 

It's a 5/10 for me. Pretty much all the positives are in the first act, for creating enough intrigue that I wanted to play more. It's unfortunate that it goes nowhere.",1496307760,1496307760,False,29,1,0.749848425388336182,1,False,False,False,False,,,

A couple of things to note:
In many ways, it's more like interactive storytelling than the sort of point-and-click adventure one might expect. But that doesn't make it any less good. Rather than interacting with objects, it's all about the dialogue, picking one of a few options to progress.

The premise is quite interesting - presented as a play in three parts, where the story itself is played by 'actors'. The story is obviously unrealistic, but it's a play anyway, so not really meant to be. It's quite wacky, but it's also very funny - especially if you select the three main character's specific options (weird, belligerent, cynical). 

Very enjoyable. Doesn't require too much thinking, and you can't get stuck. The mini-games are easy, too.

There are two graphical bugs in Act 3, and possibly a story bug (a character I thought was dead seemed to not be dead?), but other than that it's all smooth.

Imma say right now, if you want a realistic, serious storyline, this is not the game for you. The intrinsic weirdness of the small town setting and its inhabitants is very reminiscent of Twin Peaks or Deadly Premonition (sans the horror elements, of course), and even Life is Strange, albeit in a far more unsubtle version. This is set up from the beginning - the entire story is told as a stage play, in which you, the player, are a spectator, checking your phone or munching on cookies during the interludes. And the plot reflects the initial off-ness and strangeness of the entire set up. It begins weird, but it ends CRAZY. I repeat again - if this is not the kind of game you want to play, don't bother. The fourth wall is broken, the graphics and animations have an artificial, even somewhat low-budget quality to them (which, in my humble opinion, works great with the game and shouldn't be any different), but the game rocks its artificiality and low-budget look, and makes it not a flaw but a badge of honour. The stage effects - a platform pulling our protagonist out of a scene as the backdrop spins and changes to the next scene - run right with it. It's beautiful, if you can appreciate it for what it is. But don't go in expecting something completely different.

Now - the storyline is ludicrous and comes to a fitting ridiculous finale. Which, again, is beautiful. It has everything! Too much of everything, in fact. But that is exactly the point: it's over the top, the plot twists are ridiculous, and every time you think that's it, it can't get more ridiculous, it does. Don't try to fight it - just sit back and enjoy the ride! It's hard to debate details of the story without spoiling anything, so I won't, because it's worth going in blind. Suffice to say the mismatched team of a controversial young blogger, a washed up local newspaper journalist, and a bitter, failed detective is matched by the strange cast of characters in the town. From a Collectivist cult to a swamp hermit, a Native American protester and his spirit friend to a disgraced professor-turned-janitor, a cast of b-list movie actors to a gator-keeper high on his own supply, there is everything. And yes, all these characters have motivations beyond what meets the eye. Who's your friend and who's your foe? You'll have to trust your gut. More than likely, you'll be wrong. Which is cool.

In between dealing with the strange and often difficult locals, you'll be busy investigating a suicide (murder? insurance scam? conspiracy?), establish your own relationship, past and present, with the characters off and on stage, filing your individual reports on the occurances, complete with choosing what spin and source to use on them, and completing a handful of minigames. I had a special appreciation for the minigames since while they are hardly unique, they hit the sweet spot of occasionally giving you a break from the usual gameplay, without being so numerous or lengthy as to become tedious. They are hardly challenging, but they shake things up just enough. The reports, on the other hand, depend on the character you play - blog posts, article, or detective report. In each case, however, your options will depend on what you've learned from the NPCs you've interacted with. And without fail, almost all of them will try to rope you into a conversation about yourself and/or them, instead. It's hard not to get distracted by answering their questions and engaging in regular conversations with them sometimes, but you can usually steer the conversation back to your investigation if you so choose. On the other hand, that means missing out on a few lines of dialogue that help you decide who you - as the protagonists, this time, not the audience - are, both to yourself and in context to the town, your past, and your family. Deciding on a spin can be tricky, too. Do you choose a careful approach to the blog post you're writing, and risk a reputation as ""boring"" and your publisher's annoyance? Or do you go all out and write an inflammatory piece, risking the anger of the locals affected by it, who very well follow your posts? Do you choose to report on the famous actor's suicide as the higher ups at your newspaper demand? Or do you defy them and post a much more promising story on corruption in the local government? Choosing your sources and spin may not be a complete game changer towards endgame, but it's certainly fun and makes for tricky choices. There will be more choices of different sorts that may have a bigger impact as well later on, particularly critical choices with huge effects are announced beforehand and specifically marked.

What can I say about the characters? They toe the line - particularly the three protagonists - between tropes, archetypes that are almost stereotypes because we've seen them so many times, and the complete reversal of exactly that. The gruff detective isn't the cynical middle aged white guy we are trained to recognise. He's gruff and cynical all right, likely middled aged given his shared school years with the definitely middle aged newspaper writer, but he's a more complicated character than that. An African American man and one of the very few people of colour from the predominantly white small town of Cypress Knee, his youth in the town was marked by watching Klansmen burn crosses on his lawn - men that still live in the city and are active in politics now - and being blamed and subsequently expelled when drugs were discovered in his high school. Similarly, the blogger and newspaper reporter have dark pasts of their own that are linked to the town, and each other, as you can discover over the course of the story. A lot of the dialogue with NPCs and between the protagonists allows you to fill the gaps and decide who your protagonists are.

Premise and gameplay tickles your fancy? I'll have to be fair, the game isn't perfect. My experience was a little marred by a few bugs, though none of them were game-breaking: dead bodies spawning standing up, NPCs helplessly walking in circles around them trying to get to the spot they are meant to stand on, lines of (thankfully voiced) dialogue not appearing, empty dialogue prompts that seemed redundant and only accidentally left in. More of the side of immersion breaking annoyances, though, than game-affecting. I remember one instance where a choice made previously didn't seem flagged correctly in a single line of dialogue, and to be honest, that annoyed me more than it should, though it turned out to not really make a difference on the storyline. The chapter length as well was a bit disappointing after the fairly lengthy first act. But as your choices do make differences, there is a certain replay value. The game itself is a bit on the brief side, but well worth the 10-20 ‚Ç¨ you'll have to pay for it.

Overall? If you have a taste for the strange, can appreciate a game that plays with its own artificiality, and like Telltale-style interactive narrative games (albeit without Telltale's quicktime events), this is the right game for you. However, you really have to be able to sit back and enjoy the ride. The story IS ridiculous, as are the characters, and the graphics and animations aren't those of an AAA game. I still say it works, and in fact shouldn't be any different, but it IS a matter of taste. Don't go in expecting seriousness and realism. While quite dark in some places, the story has the tongue-in-cheek nature of many stage plays, complete with lyrical (and intentionally poor) recap/commentary interludes by the town's inhabitants and instances of the characters and commentator addressing the player/audience directly. This is a game that you can love, but you have to understand what it is going in, and you have to be into that kind of thing.

Set in a small backwater town called Cypress Knee in Florida, you control the three main characters as they investigate an actor‚Äôs murder, digging deep into a world of political corruption, blackmail, intrigue and even a bit of sci fi weirdness. The story is accompanied by nice graphics, atmospheric music and a unique take on gameplay where the story takes place as if it was a theater play complete with moving sets and all. The game is available on PS4, XBox One, and PC via Steam, which is the version I played for this review.

The game shows the player that everything takes place in a theater. Despite having control over the character‚Äôs choices, we‚Äôre also in the audience. We‚Äôre told that the story takes place in a fictional Florida town named Cypress Knee and that an apparent suicide has taken place. Throughout the story you have control over three different characters: a young and self-important blogger named Romana Teague, a grumpy local reporter by the name of Jack Bellet, and K.C. Gaddis, a cynical private investigator returning home for the case. All the three characters offer a different perspective of the story at hand and interact with characters differently. While they don‚Äôt get along with each other at first, they end up working together to solve the mystery of the actor who committed suicide and find out what‚Äôs happening in the town around them.

The story calls itself a ‚Äúswamp noir‚Äù and touches on themes of suicide, murder, political corruption and even cults. Everything starts off simply with the investigation of the suicide of a famous actor but soon it‚Äôs obvious more is going on. The story is told in three parts, like acts of a play. I was really into the mystery vibes at first, the two reporters and the private eye trying to solve the case while the cast of characters around them aren‚Äôt very helpful. Between the dirty politicians and the cultish church in town, the main characters are actively pushed away from the real story at hand every step of the way. Things go way off the deep end by act three, however. Sci fi elements are brought in, people are dying left and right and everything is just a mess. I was very disappointed that a story that started off pretty strong developed into a whole lot of incoherent nonsense. While there was resolution and questions got answers, I didn‚Äôt like the answers provided. Also, for a game that advertises that ‚Äúchoices matter‚Äù in the end the ending of the game is always the same.

While the choices you make do affect the dialogue and how other characters react to you, overall they don‚Äôt have any lasting consequences. You will still find the information you need and everything still ends up the same, even if you‚Äôre rude to everyone or the nicest person on Earth. A major example of this was at a certain point of the game you have the option to save yourself or one of three other characters from dying. Either way, one of the three will survive so picking yourself won‚Äôt kill them all. But, no matter who you pick they play the exact same role later in the game. Saving character A instead of character B doesn‚Äôt change how the game plays or ends, just certain dialogue. While for the most part I did enjoy the story, this gameplay aspect really hurt any desire to replay the game which you have to do if you want all of the achievements.

Despite my issues with the ‚Äúchoices matter‚Äù system, overall the game plays very well. You can play with a mouse or a controller and it even supports VR. You don‚Äôt have to move your characters around in the game, they automatically go where they need to so I found just using the mouse to make choices the best option while playing on the PC. While a huge bulk of the game play consists of reading and then making dialogue choices for the main characters as well as other side characters from time to time, there are also a few mini games sprinkled in. I found the games to be relatively easy and for most part useless to the story and gameplay. It was nice to change things up a bit but the game would not suffer if they weren‚Äôt there.

The game has decent graphics, the character models are smooth and the animation for the most part is rather seamless. I saw some glitches, like characters walking in circles for no reason and once, a character who has just died, was still standing on the screen for no reason. I did not run into many of these hiccups very often, however. The game is rather dark for me -literally-  it was important for atmosphere but my eyes aren‚Äôt the best so this was an issue for me. While it didn‚Äôt affect gameplay at all or the story, it did make me squint more than I would have liked. The game has full voice acting which is very well done and a great soundtrack that is also available for purchase. The actors helped bring the well-written script to life and handled all of the quirky lines wonderfully. Even if the story faltered at some points, the acting never did.

While for the most part I did enjoy playing [i]Knee Deep[/i], I feel it‚Äôs a game that people will generally enjoy or not with very little room to meet in between. The stylistic choice of setting everything like a play in a theater may turn people off or fill them intrigue. The sheer volume of choices you have to make do create for an interesting game, even if they don‚Äôt change the ending, because there are a lot of humorous moments in the game. While it‚Äôs advertised as an adventure game I would honestly say it has a lot more in common with a visual novel as mostly everything is text based and the main purpose of the game is to tell a story. I played the PC version on Steam, it has trading cards and a lot of achievements to obtain but you will have to play the game at least twice and the first chapter a whole three times to gain them all. I do recommend adding this title to your library, though I might suggest waiting for a sale.

Knee Deep is an adventure game developed and published by Prologue Games

Knee Deep is a highly entertaining and unique adventure game, set on theatre stage, with three acts which play out in a typical theatre fashion

You can pick from a wide variety of dialog choices and can have large consequences down the line. The voice acting is a great addition and the actors give life to the character's through their high-quality voice work

Music in this game are some of the best and most atmospheric I have heard, in many AAA games on the market. The graphics are great and have unique art style that really adds to the atmosphere

Each of the character's have unique personality and personal story lines. There is a unique blogging mechanic where you can post blog articles that will affect the attitudes of characters that you've dealt with along the way

Knee Deep has a unique setting and atmosphere with a high-quality soundtrack and fully voice acted. Which offers multi choice dialog and an interesting blog mechanic and a unique art style

Knee Deep is a very different adventure game!

However, after finishing the game I'm able to say that the negatives VASTLY outnumber the positives. So let's start the with the positives shall we?

- Great soundtrack
- Interesting setting and art style
- Puzzles are ok, though not really diverse. They're all pretty much the same, but challenging enough for it not to ruin the experience.
- Act 2 and 3 are better than Act 1 (This is barely a positive; 2 and 3 are both pretty mediocre and confusing still)
- Some of the jokes are funny

And that's about it really. The game has a lot of potential considering the unique setting of being played out like an actual theatric play, but it throws away that potential, which I will explain as we move on the negatives:

- Story is messy and makes no sense
- Heaps of loose threads at the end of the game
- Terrible dialogue. The characters will just change the subject in the middle of a conversation or simply go quiet and walk away without reaching any conclusion to the actual convo.
- Choices are vague. When you decide what to say in a conversation the choices don't give you much to go on. They usually only contain one or two words, which often leads to your character saying something that you didn't mean or want at all. For some reason the creators also made it so you have three main characters instead of one. And on top of the main characters you sometime pick the dialogue options for an additional 3-4 characters. The problem with that is that the game doesn't clarify which character you're picking a choice for - meaning that if you're currently watching a group of people and get to pick a dialogue option, you don't know which character is gonna say what you pick. The fact that there are three main characters also makes it so that you often go through the same exact dialogue with a person three times, since all three characters basically do the same things.
- Act 1 is dreary and repetitive to no end, and it goes on for way too long. While Act 1 took me around three hours to play (mind you I took some breaks because I simply wasn't enjoying myself) act 2 and 3 took 2 hours COMBINED. 
- Jokes get so overused, it's ridiculous. There's one specific joke about a character saying the wrong words while talking and not understanding that he's doing it. It was slightly funny the first time, but they use the same joke every single time he says a sentence. Safe to say it gets really annoying after a while.

Luckily I picked this game up during a sale, so I'm not too bummed about it not living up to my expectations, but I would NOT recommend getting this at full price. It's simply not worth it.",1481818953,1481818953,False,21,1,0.670147597789764404,1,True,False,False,False,,,

So why the thumbs down?

First, because the gameplay is stilted. You cannot wander around and explore: it's just one dialog choice after another. Which could be OK if not for the pretense--suggested by the dialog choices--that you control these characters in some way. So do you or do you not? It's frustrating that when you finish a dialog you feel like you really want to go back and question another witness again. But that's not the way the game's belligerently linear path takes you. The beautifully crafted setting screams for exploration, but there is none.

And let's examine the dialog choices: only some affect the story, and of those few seem to allow you to control the personality of the characters, but then they're all over the place. You can make a character nice, callous, weird, or kind in any given encounter, and switch whenever you like. It's completely schizophrenic, except that there's no penalty for being inconsistent. Nor is there a reward for consistency. It simply doesn't matter what you choose, and soon enough you will stop caring. This is [I]not[/I] a role-playing game. It's not even a choose-your-own-adventure game. All you really need to care about is making sure you don't choose something that will cause you to miss out on some of the story. That's a pathetic amount of investment.

So, how's the story? It gets too convoluted too quickly, but also predictably so. You just know that there will be plot twists. And since you can't control anything about the game, your role is just to be patient and wait for the next, yawn, surprise. The script is often preposterous: people get murdered while bystanders stand by and make sarcastic comments; strangers confess deep personal secrets and then move on to talk about real estate projects; [I]everybody[/I] seems to be obsessed about their moms. There's so much snark packed into this game that I feel encouraged to be snarky about the game itself. But ain't nobody got time for eye-rollings: negative reviews are the way to go!

Finally, this game is unoriginal: it's a lot like Kentucky Route Zero, just placed in a different southern state and with a different visual concept. The mood is copied, as is the idea of switching between characters, and even the surrealist vibe. It's disappointing that a team as creative as this one seems to be unable to come up with their own concept. (Offensive, even: there might be a case for plagiarism. Even though there's what I think is a homage to KR0 in the end.) It's also strategically bad to copy, because it begs the games to be compared, and KR0 comes out so much more mature, captivating, and exploratory. Where KR0 is poetic, Knee Deep is art-school pretentious.

This is all a bit harsh, perhaps. I did enjoy the game, to an extent, as a bit of poorly written but nicely produced theater. But I was very annoyed by the game's flaws, and believe that others will be annoyed, too. I just can't recommend it to anyone I care about unless they really ran out of things to play.

Gameplay-wise, Knee Deep keeps to the basics (low interaction with the environment, high amount of choices pertaining to character development), but what sets it apart, besides its Twin Peaks-esque setting, is its extremely theatrical direction. The characters wander from stage to stage, while buildings open and close like pop-up books to make way for them. They proclaim their lines (often in rhymes), self-conscious of being actors in a play,  sometimes breaking the fourth wall, and the other three as well. I haven't seen this kind of staging in any other game, ever. A lot of current videogames take their inspirations from cinema, but this one works like a theatric play, and I hope I'll see more games going down that route.

+ Extremely original direction
+ Twin Peaks-like atmosphere with weird characters
+ Replayability through dialog choices
+ Some dialog choices make the game feel like a VtM:Bloodlines Malkavian playthrough

- Slowdowns now and then, particularly during minigames
- Somewhat low production values (though I find it contributes to the atmosphere)
- Kinda short for its price (but I got it in a bundle, so I won't complain)
- Act 3 feels a bit rushed

The play revolves around the death of famous actor, Tag Kern. At first glance, it seems like it would be an open-and-shut suicide case, but three characters soon dig deeper and together uncover a conspiracy involving the entire town of Cypress Knee.

The game immediately strikes you with its unique presentation. The art style is pretty and the way the camera moves as well as the cinematography really makes you feel that it's a stage play. The characters even transition through scenes, which while it could be considered as padding, really cements the idea that you're directing a real stage play instead of just playing a video game.

The characters are endearing, too. I especially liked Romana, the blogger. Of course, you kind of dictate their personality through the choices and how they say certain things, so it's easy for me to make the characters likeable. Some might find some of the characters cliche'd or typical, however.

The mystery of the game is also pretty good and keeps things tense. The pace of the story-telling is great and really makes you want to find out what happens next. There are also some small puzzles that are fun distractions from the pretty heavy tone of the rest of the game.

A small complaint I have, however, is the wonky controller support. At least at the time of this review, the controller only recognizes input when your mouse pointer is near the choice area, which isn't exactly ideal as you're then blocking a portion of the screen. Hopefully this can be patched in a later update.

Overall, I really enjoyed Knee Deep and I would recommend it to fans of adventure games as well as for those looking for a nice mystery.

What I played: The full game in about 5-6 hours
Like: The story, the art style, the overall presentation
Dislike: Poor controller support.

Knee Deep is an adventure game, more in the vein of Telltale Games rather than a classic point-n-click adventure full of inventory puzzles.  It‚Äôs a noir mystery set in the Florida swamp lands. More interestingly, the entire story is presented to you in the style of a stage play.

I played about an hour into the first act (out of three acts), and the game play thus far has mostly consisted of making dialogue choices, and deciding what news to report, and what spin to put on it.  The game comes right out and tells you that you can‚Äôt lose, but it does let you know that what you say matters.

Throughout each act, you will have the chance to participate in the story through controlling the choices of three different characters. Knee Deep is a game on very rigid rails; you go where it takes you, and you become the person it tells you to become when it decides you should.  For some people this is a turn off.  However, if you can deal with the idea of this being more of a visual novel than a game, and that your choices really aren‚Äôt going to effect how the story ends, then I can‚Äôt think of a lovelier piece of interactive fiction currently available.

Knee Deep is visually stunning.  At least for me, a fan of mysteries in any form, the story completely holds my attention.  The characters ‚Äì at least the playable ones ‚Äì feel respectably fleshed out, although some folks you encounter feel more like caricatures than people. The voice acting is absolutely solid. There‚Äôs the option to use this nifty eye motion tracker, if you happen to have one.

This is a game I want to finish, but that I also want to savor.  Completion time is approximately 5-6 hours, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like the sort of game that would have much replay value, at least short term.  However, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I revisited it down the line, when the story has become hazy in my mind.

With little to no replay value, and such a short storyline, I can‚Äôt in good conscience tell you to go right out and drop a $20 on this game. I absolutely think it‚Äôs worth downloading the demo, and making that decision for yourself.  If you can find it on sale for $10 or less, I would absolutely, unequivocally recommend it, just for the experience.  When a game does so many things so right, it‚Äôs hard to fault it for not stuffing itself with filler just to provide more in game hours.

This game has a really good storyline as mentioned above, and starts off when an actor apperently commits suicide at a small town in Florida. The game portrays itself in a theatre with a really creative way of changing scenes. Throughout the game you realize it has strong hints that the actor who \""suicided\"" is similar to Tom Cruise and his love for Scientology. You play three different characters, two of which are reports Romana (who has a quirky personality), and Jack (who tends to be more belligerent). The last character is K.C. who is a detective with a more depressing outlook. Of course the player deicdes how exactly these characters will answer, so their personality can be slightly shifted.  They spend the course of the time trying to figure out if the actor really was suicidal,  or if there is a thicker plot yet to unveil. While it is a drama, there are a lot of comedic scenes that add to the game. 

Gameplay, this is where the it is hugely lacking. The only things you can do in the game are select conversation options and move your character to a set point. I think I would like it more if you could explore the scenes. But again, its made to  take place in a theatre and looking around scenary may take away from that ideal. There is about two/three puzzles in-game, but they\'re fairly easy to get.  Its pretty idiot-proof to play, as you\'re pretty much just watching a movie. 

I wouldn\'t buy this game for full price because I like my gameplay. But, it kills a few hours for a fun little \""movie\"" per se.

However, there's enough to hold the game back that I wish there was a neutral thumb.  It's not strictly bad, but there are some serious negatives.

The game is a select your own branching narrative styled game that follows a murder mystery taking place in the Florida Swamps.  Think Carl Hiaasen like feel if it were a novel.  For the first act of the game it seems to follow this pretty well, a strong drama with some action and black humor to keep things varied.  But the next two acts seem to lose sense of what the game was about and the final act feels like it is rushing to close up all the loose ends the first two acts used to keep us wanting more.  

Positives:

+Technical: The game worked just fine on my computer.  No problems to speak of.
+Soundtrack:  The soundtrack is amazing and easily worth listening to on it's own.  It cements the feel and tone of the game.
+Time:  If you want a quick play, you can easily knock this game out in a few hours.
+Sense of Humor:  The game isn't afraid to poke fun at itself.
+Visual style:  The game looks great and has an original feel thanks to the stage like atmosphere.

Negative:

-Dialogue:  Ranges from ""okay"" to ""please stop talking.""
-Storyline:  Starts strong, but then it seems like it can't decide if it wants to be funny or not.  Rushes into an ending.
-Time:  If you wanted a longer game, look elsewhere.
-Characters: While interesting at times, they vary from stereotype to just nonsense.
-replayability:  few of the choices truly seem meaningful and there is little incentive to play again after the first time.

- Characters take a million years to walk between scene transitions
- Some mini games are fun but most are not (one is so miserable that it has a skip button), it would be nice to be able to skip them on replay
- Seems like there are more choices than there are. Playing through a second time, I tried to have a character say 'no' near the end only to have this ""but thou must!"" conversation until the only option left to choose was ""OK""
- The 'quirky' business with Romana (the female character) felt really off a lot of the time - like sometimes she would just shout ""pineapple!"" and leave the scene
- A little too much edgy for edgy's sake stuff in there (the disgraced professor character was a little bit too much for no reason for me and some characters are pretty flat stereotypes)
- Acts 2 and 3 are shorter and have fewer options in them than Act 1, seems like maybe budget constraints

Absolutely one of the best game I've aver played.
To me, its a sort of indie ALAN WAKE!
The idea of getting player inside a theater play is intriguing and terrific.
You start the game thinking about next steps and clues to look for but soon after the game shows you all its potential.
You're the director. You decide what happens next.
Nothing matters more than getting the story to work.
And to work well.
Characters are delightful.
Very humanized and three dimensional.
They're not just some character, no. You feel they're actors, thanks to the great voice acting!
That being said ... well ... the play is in your very hands.
You're in charge of making things happen.
And what happens is brilliant!
Style is brilliant.
Voice acting is brilliant.
Everything is brilliant.
The story is terrific!
It sounds like TWIN PEAKS and ALAN WAKE!
But also reminds of all those horror B movies of the 80's.
And, of course, it links with SHAKESPEARE and THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.
It is filled with developers' passion.
You feel it.
And you get it when you experience some of the best scene in the three acts.
Last but not least, it really is a very passionate homage to theater and its mechanics.
The beginning of Act 2 is just ... well ... the best!
And, of course ... making actors to be followed by lights or not is such a great choice!
It takes gaming to a next level, mixing it with theater and drama.
AMAZING!

The opening of Acts II and III really sell it, but otherwise it's not setup like a play in really any way? The visual effects that made it not a play were super cool and I appreciated them a lot.

Act III was a little too trope-y for me, and the ending not the most satisfying? But I enjoyed playing it a lot, especially Act II which was the best in my opinion. There's little puzzles throughout which are cool and break up the ""just click next"" feeling that a lot of visual novels get.

Knee-Deep is a great spin on any choice-driven game I've played in the past instead of being a game with a mash of button combo specfic commands or complex actions you choose the fate of your characters' friends/personality/ending on your choices of how they talk/interact with other characters.

What makes Knee-Deep so very special and beautiful is the setting and environment as the game takes place on a very dimnensional theatre stage -- as scenes change lights will dim for the new scene to be lit in the background and the current character will walk/transition to the next scene which unfolds much like at a real play - it's simply beautiful in these transitions and in the lightning/environments - I've never seen or played anything like it. 

There are over-the-top speeches in some scenes that rhyme that really sink in the ""theatre"" experience that I think it could've done without but these also didn't hurt the story. The ending seemed a bit fast and abrupt but the whole story was fast-paced in general (I usually like this speed). The game takes about 4 hours to play. Absoultey worth it!

For this is one game that blows me away with it's original presentation , fantastic voice-acting, great artwork and superb storytelling.
Now as there are more games out there who have those feats (and unfortunately many that haven't) what makes this game stand out?
Well, the aforementioned feats are truely exceptional, but also the way you play a mystery in a choice and consequence setting by dialogue options playing several characters in turn point and clicking... and all this while you're really directing a ... PLAY !! is an astounding achievement from the dev team.
All the controls and the HUD are very easy to navigate and positioned right. There's also a comprehensive journal to read back on all the information received and discovered.

So did I not like this Play? No it's very entertaining and a great concept and application, Watching the stages move and swoop into view never got old, and the set design was very good, But the character models let the side down a bit, The story was good but nothing epic, But it was pulled off with such charm in the concept of a play that it made up for it's short comings, If I could have directly controlled the actors and played detective and gone to the different scenes of my own volition I would have been more pleased with it, The first act seemed a lot longer than the 2nd and third acts, It took me six hours to play through it and it was enjoyable and different and for that I applaud the Devs for doing something different.

I definitely enjoy the idea of setting the game as a play and all of the overall ""My kids are with the babysitter till 9 and my wife doesn't much care for me"" but that might just be me. Every choice felt like it truly mattered, even if only in a small way. The characters each had their quirks and felt likeable and the story keeps you guessing. An unwelcome intrusion may have been the few supernatural elements that were poorly explained but hopefully a sequel could explain these as the ending is quite open. I feel the ending may at least have explained what the characters questioning by the agents ended with but not every thing can be explained and it might be best if left to interpretation.

It's also funny how they wasted so much time in making the backgrounds look like fake sets and yet made them unrealistically huge on purpose, and how everyone sounds like they are just acting, again completely on purpose...

Some parts of the story were pretty stupid and not as serious as one might expect from the beginning, but I'm not really complaining since I was entertained thorough.

I've only played this once, so I don't know how much your choices really affect the story, but I'm pretty sure they change at least a couple of things quite significantly.

I wanted to review this from Act 1, but thought it would be better to save it until Act 3 was released. Now that all the acts have been released and played I figured now was the perfect time.

I personally really enjoyed this game. It's more or less a simplified point-and-click game where all you need to do is really press 1 of 3 buttons to make decisions in game. The characters of this game are also wonderfully written and funny. On top of this, the whole game takes place on a theatre stage with you as an audience member who is also the director (somehow) who decides many of the lines in the game. 

I would personally say that Act 1 starts off a little slowly (but considering the game is set on stage like a play, this is expected) in that not much really begins to happen until the very end of Act 1. In my opinion from the second half of Act 2 to Act 3 is where everything ramps up dramatically. To me, the entirety of Act 3 was the best part of this game.

I'd recommend this game to you if you're looking for an episodic style game where you don't need to be paying attention 100% of the time as there are (thankfully) no quick time events. 

My only complaint would MAYBE be the current price of it. It was ¬£10.99 (UK, full price) at the original date of posting this review, and for something that took 4.4hrs to complete.

The gameplay is very simple and streamlined - you just make dialog choices and choose one of 3 spins on the reports you publish. The game even alerts you to when your choices ""matter"" and then later when the effects of those choices materialize, exposing the inner workings of the game model rather than trying to hide it from you. The game cuts out all the walking around and re-checking the people you might have already talked to for new clues, just takes you straight from one dialog choice to the next. So it feels like you're always driving forward at a fast pace (even though there are no actual time constraints or anything)
But there are tons of little details everywhere that really flesh out the world. Random signs people are holding, other set dressing, the way that the characters move as they are transported from one set to the next. The pseudo-theater metaphor really works well.

I can't believe I'm revising my review once again but after finishing Act 1 (life has gotten in the way of playing - always a drag), my enthusiasm has only increased.  As with a good film, I'm swept up in the story and the mechanics of its telling. I really wanted to sit through the credits that cleverly display when you choose a ""bathroom break"" at the end of the Act.  I'm definitely looking forward to Acts 2 and 3 but as importantly, the next project this team tackles.  I hope they can remain viable.  I've been a gamer for over 50 years and it's rare to see a game that so expertly captures my other passions: movies and theater.  I've enjoyed such cinematic games as Life is Strange but Knee Deep nails the emotional experience evoked by the best of the arts.  It is a gaming masterpiece.

Update:
Please note the dev's comments that I am wrong regarding length of Act 1.  That would indicate the length, with all three acts, is good.  Regardless, I bought it even though I thought it might be short.

Orginal review:
For those of us who love cinematic games, this is a terrific addition.  It deftly provides the cinematics in a theatrical manner that is graphically dynamic and highly unusual.  The characters are a bit stiff and rough in comparison but that doesn't detract from the visceral pleasure of advancing an interesting story line.  With sublime lighting and evocative music, Knee Deep has flair to spare.  And for those who may be put off by earlier reviews citing lack of vocalization, know that the devs have listened and supplied voiceovers to great effect.  I've also noticed they have responded to most, if not all, of the reviews here which generally signals devs who really care.  If you're on the fence, just play the demo.  That's what hooked me.  Even though the game may be short (the demo is supposed to be all of Act 1 and I finished it in less than two hours), I decided these devs deserve support.  There are some reviews that compare this to Telltale games but I think in many ways, Telltale and other ""choice-oriented"" adventure game companies could learn from these folks.",1454017094,1456001047,True,18,0,0.589789986610412598,3,False,False,False,False,,,

Really acomplishes atmosphere and story, length is decent as well(I'm halfway thorugh Act 1 at almost 3 hours).

Also, I have to say the music, sounds, & voice acting fits the style pretty well, not messy or anything at all. Another thing to point out is yes, there are a few missed oppertunities here, and I only say that because i felt in some instances they could have done ""more"", storywise or graphically, but there are enough surprises, especially in the story itself to forgive these minor things, even more in art and sound like I said more than makes up for it..

Hierbei handelt es sich um ein Episoden-Spiel. 
Mittlerweile sind alle Episoden erschienen und man kann das ganze Spiel am St√ºck durchspielen.

[i] Was erwartet einen hier? [/i]

Ein Adventure, dass sich prim√§r Dialogen und Entscheidungen gewidmet hat.

Es gibt kein Point-and-Click (Bildschirm nach kleinen Objekten absuchen), kein Inventory (*benutze alles mit allem*) und man kann nichteinmal selbst gehen.
Dies mag nun zuerst seltsam klingen, aber f√ºr Leute die Telltale Adentures m√∂gen ist dies auf jeden Fall ein Geheimtipp!

Hier schreibt man tats√§chlich gro√üe Teile der Geschichte selbst (Ein Detail, welches sich viele Telltale-Fans stets st√§rker implementiert gew√ºnscht haben).
Dies geht sogar soweit, dass man die Hintergrundgeschichte und Vergangenheit der Spieler-Charaktere durch seine Antworten in Diaglogen ver√§ndern kann. Man wird beispielsweise gefragt was damals in der Schule vorgefallen ist und die Antwort bestimmt was tats√§chlich passiert ist.

Durch diese Entscheidungsfreiheit f√ºhlt man sich sehr stark mit den Charakteren verbunden und ist auch motiviert ""richtig"" zu handeln.

[i] Die Story: [/i]

Ohne zu spoilern kann man nur sagen, dass die Geschichte wirklich interessant ist und alle Charaktere auf mehr oder weniger mysteri√∂se Weise miteinander verbunden sind. Die Kleinstadt mit ihren teilweise verschrobenen Einwohnern l√§sst teilweise eine Twin Peaks Atmosph√§re aufkommen.

[i] Die Technik:  [/i]

Ich hatte bislang (Episode 1 und 2) keinen einzigen Absturz und konnte auch keine Bugs bemerken. 
Die Grafik sieht nett aus und hat einen sehr interessanten Stil (das Spiel wird auf einer Art Theaterb√ºhne dargestellt - klingt jetzt seltsam, wirklich ingame aber nur die ersten paar Minuten ungewohnt).
Die Sprachausgabe ist wie in den Steamdetails angegeben nur Englisch - die Formulierungen sind aber einfach, es gibt Untertitel und man hat Zeit sich diese durchzulesen (man muss nach jedem Satz auf *Continue* dr√ºcken).

[i] F√ºr wen ist dieses Spiel:  [/i]

Personen die Adventures m√∂gen, welche eine gute Story, Dialoge, Entscheidungsfreiheiten (Choice&Consequence) und Atmosph√§re haben.
Personen die interactive-movie Spiele m√∂gen (hier ist es nach dem Setup eher ein interaktives Theaterst√ºck).

[i] Wer wird mit diesem Spiel nicht gl√ºcklich:  [/i]

Personen die keine Adventures m√∂gen.
Personen die Point-and-Click Adventures mit schwierigen R√§tseln m√∂gen. (Es gibt in dem Spiel zwar tats√§chlich Puzzles, aber diese sind im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes Puzzles - man baut z.B. einen Fingerabdruck aus Fragmenten zusammen. )

Interesting Noir story line.
Neat premise (Inside a theatre and you get to control the actors responses)
Good music
Nice art style
Player choice affects gameplay.

The Cons - 

Not voice acted. I feel like this game would be AMAZING if it had voice acting. As it is now I struggled to remember everyone's name (Apart from the very Major characters) and missed some of the story because it is hard to guage someone's reaction from a straight text of what is being said.

It is hard to see where a certain conversation thread is going to lead based on your 3-4 choices. I realize there doesn't need to be a full transcript of what they are going to say, but a little more info might be good?

Short (For the moment)
It is supposed to be 3 acts so I will change this once those other 2 acts come out. But at the moment is $10 US for a 2 hour experience.

Overall I enjoyed the game and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys Noir style storytelling and visual novel/choose your own adventure games.

No score will be given. A full review of the entire season will follow once all three episodes have been released.[/i]

It‚Äôs a good thing that I‚Äôm playing this game on a hot summer evening. It‚Äôs also interesting that I live just a few miles away from one of the largest swampland areas in Europe and the humidity, as always, is unbearable. It‚Äôs just curious that there are no mosquitoes tonight. All in all, a perfect situation to immerse myself into Knee Deep, a self-proclaimed swamp noir in three acts. And I am immersed in a matter of seconds. The first thing that strikes me is the music, a brilliantly moody mixture of American folk and blues. I start the game up and I am immediately seated in a theater. I silence my mobile phone out of respect for the actors. As the curtain rises on the stage, I find myself in a backwater Florida town of Cypress Knee. It‚Äôs a grim start as a washed-up actor has hanged himself from a tower next to a local inn.

It is at that time that I am called up to control the story. Even though a wider narrative is in place, the player is able to move the story along through the actions of three distinct characters. Romana Teague, a 20-year-old blogger kicks things off as she decided to report on the apparent suicide. Then there‚Äôs Jack Bellet, a local reporter whose career and marriage is falling apart. Lastly, private investigator K.C. Gaddis, hired by the film studio to look into Tag Kern‚Äôs suicide, arrives on the scene as well. Not all is as it seems in Cypress Knee and each character will stumble onto different pieces of information as they survey the surroundings and talk to the locals. Certain critical choices will affect relationships with other characters. Also, as you uncover certain details, you can choose which story to run and what spin to put on it. Whether you choose to keep things grounded, put an edgy spin on a story, or go all out sensationalist, it will have an effect on the narrative and other characters. What I found most compelling was the ability to choose the playable characters‚Äô past and motivations and that is something I hope to see more of in upcoming episodes.

The overall story is certainly intriguing with all manner of seedy and eccentric characters. However, the writing is a bit of a hit-and-miss. Romana in particular comes off as rather obnoxious too often in an attempt to be snarky and that‚Äôs definitely not a trait you want the lead character to have. Some situations are realized to great effect while others fall flat. The gameplay revolves around choosing responses when interacting with characters and choosing which story to write and what spin to put on it. There are only two puzzles in the game and they‚Äôre an extremely basic affair of putting several puzzle pieces together. It is clear that the gameplay in Knee Deep takes a backseat to storytelling and atmosphere. And the atmosphere is truly palpable.

Aside from the already mentioned brilliant soundtrack, certain graphical effects are pulled off masterfully as well. While the graphics are technically rather modest, the slick utilization of a theater stage makes up for it. The game takes place during a single evening and the stage is mostly very dark with a few lights coming on to highlight points of interest. As the lead characters enter buildings, the outer walls and ceilings rise up to reveal the interior. Also, as you go from one location to another, the entire stage rotates and changes the backdrop. It‚Äôs truly an inspired series of effects that completely nail the vibe of both a dark stage and a small Florida swamp town.

The first act will take you about 2 hours to finish, so it‚Äôs a bit short even for an episodic game. I played through it a second time to see how different choices affect the story and to get some achievements. The remaining two acts will follow at an undetermined date. The end of Act 1 brings closure to this particular part of the story, but there are still things left to uncover.

[b]THE VERDICT[/b]

Knee Deep Act 1: Wonderland is a solid start with an intriguing story, lots of choices and interesting characters. A bit too light on gameplay, it does manage to make up for it mostly due to its fantastic presentation which masterfully uses graphical effects and music to provide a strong sense of place.",1437645565,1638886944,True,9,1,0.540659785270690918,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Knee Deep is a point and click adventure game which takes place in Cypress Knee with a huge emphasis on the fact that it's a play on a movie set with backdrops and sets being built as the game goes along. 

While the game has no voice acting, it makes up with it with lore and dialogue choices to allow you to immerse yourself into the characters shoes even if the environment juxtaposes this. 

I found the music and ambient sounds to be top notch and really helped  enhance the mood of the story and allows for crucial decision making to be made more obviously prominent alongside visual prompts. 

Overall based on my first impressions, If you like games with a fourth wall element to them, make your choices seem notable with a lot of player decisions and a game with an intriguing mystery and is able to keep that intrigue then this game is for you!

Act 2 Review 

Simply put Act 2 feels a lot like the first Act delivering more twists, turns and the addition of voice acting makes for a really enjoyable experience. My only gripe with the act is that it felt a little short. 

If you want to hear some voice acting the video below is the start of Act 2 for those interested.

The setting is set on a stage and it's really surprising the first time when you see the buildings and environment being built right in front of your very own eyes. You as the player have some control over the three main characters of the play. I say some because I felt as though some of the selections that were given felt forced on me. 

Anyways, there are choices you can make (in a form of news reports that you can send to your editor/boss), that will determine how other non-playable actors will react to you.  Now, since there‚Äôs only one act, I am not sure how much of an impact my decisions will have on future acts so that is to be determined. I will update as more acts are added.

The characters are quirky, albeit strange at times but they all have unique personalities that set them apart from each other. I mean it‚Äôs not every day someone asks you to feed a raw chicken wearing a diaper to an alligator. (However, if this is an everyday occurrence to you, please call me.) Some of the dialogues are funny and the story is engaging. I believe it took me about 3.5 hours to complete the first act so it‚Äôs not too long. 

I would recommend this game, especially since the price dropped to $9.99. The developers are pretty responsive to their players. 

I‚Äôm not much for scoring but I suppose I would rate the first act a 7/10.

For your viewing pleasure, I uploaded my playthrough of this game on YouTube.

It's very much in the spirit of Telltale's iconic Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us games, using well-written (and frequently hilarious) dialogue-branch gameplay to further the narrative.

The big thing that struck me was Knee Deep's staging and production design. It's a modestly sized project, but you can tell a lot of thought went into how each scene transitions from one to the next through clever lighting and inspired set design. Buildings spiral, transform, and rotate to take you to each new location, creating a gorgeously fun ballet out of limited art assets.

If I have any gripes at all, it's that I found the swelling cast of characters tough to tell apart after a while. Since many of the scenes are told through static, stage-play inspired shots, it was tough to get a good look at anyone's face up close. I would have loved to have seen an occasional close-up during heated moments to build some intimacy and tension.

Very much looking forward to Act II!",1437083982,1437083982,True,10,1,0.561326205730438232,1,False,False,False,False,,,

+ The writing is great. I laughed out loud several times choosing the ""interesting"" dialogue choices
+ The story and characters are engaging. The ending had a lot happen at once which is overwhelming but I am invested in Act 2 and want to see how they develop it. Going to go through again to see how much the choices affect outcomes.

- No voice acting. This was very apparent in the opening scenes but I honestly quickly got over it soon after. I think the game would be improved by it but not significantly.

Knee Deep is an absorbing world which introduces you to three characters you will play and a dark, steamy florida night, complete with cricket sounds and twangy soundtrack.  I emerged, several hours later, pondering the clues I had uncovered and wondering what will happen next? An exciting, well-staged cliffhanger at the end of this episode got my pulse racing as events rapidly escalated to an unexpected conclusion.  
I love this theatrical premise, with gorgeous sets and lighting, and I find the characters fun to play. There are choices to make which influence how other characters will respond to you (whether they will give you much information, for example), but you really cannot fail at this game, which encourages you to take risks and experiment. The game conveniently stores discovered information and clues for you in an easily accessible journal which you can refer to at any time. I found this particularly helpful as there is a lot going on in this first episode.
Cannot wait for the next installment and glad to hear it will be out in just a few months.  Meanwhile, I will be playing this again and making different choices, just to see what happens! A game which rewards experimentation and which is, in a word, FUN.

ACT 2 REVIEW:

Knee Deep's Wonderland offers new scenes but continues its strangely addicting combination of murder mystery with witty (often snarky) repartee. I love the option of choosing edgy reporting or weird responses. Why not? It's a game, not real life. I can take risks.
Still in Cypress Knee, that strangely familiar Florida town, but now there is a weirdly creepy fair complete with a  set of rhyming villagers reminiscent of an off-kilter broadway musical. The body count continues to grow as the clues accumulate...
The occasional short interlude of ""match the patterm"" challenge allows a chance to engage a different part of your brain.  This act is well paced and all in all, an excellent use of the 90 minutes or so it takes to play it. Great fun all around, and I look forward to the final act.",1436394355,1453516165,True,14,0,0.550194978713989258,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I may be subject to some genre bias, narrative adventure is something I genuinely enjoy, but I feel Knee Deep has performed admirably in this regard. The characters are engaging, if not always likeable, the story is superbly written and the mystery itself enough to make me want to keep digging.

When it comes to negative points. If you're after action, or a rich puzzle-filled experience, as some other adventure games showcase, Knee Deep may not be for you. As I'm sure it says in the description somewhere, and probably another review, the game is about choice, dialogue, and character (As I see). The dialogue also falls into a similar problem I found in L.A. Noire (Admittedly a very different game) where the dialogue choices you make may not always be quite clear on the tone you're about to throw at a witness/friend/boss. But all in all, very minor problems.

The choice of graphical style is quirky, but fits seamlessly into the tone of the story as it's written. Witty dialogue, wacky backdrops, and a story and characters that could really have come from a Florida backwater. With only one playthrough of one act under my belt, I'm sure that Knee Deep is money well spent.",1436264423,1436264423,True,8,0,0.463911890983581543,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Knee Deep tells the tale of three different characters all investigating an apparent suicide. The story takes place in the back waters of swampland Florida. There are all sorts of strange characters all with possibly shady pasts and even shadier motives. From Remy who keeps telling you useless facts, to the strange religion that seemingly is connected to everybody. These characters and interactions is what makes Knee Deep rich. The basic mechanics of the game are simple, this is a visual novel with an interesting aesthetic. You go through the game talking to many characters trying to find out what really is going on. What makes Knee Deep unique is that you form the narrative in many ways, from inner monologue to the back story of certain characters. Things can play out many different ways and it adds a lot of replay value. Occasionally I found the animations and the way conversations ended rather odd. This could be due to Knee Deep being a stageplay that you are watching. As far from a technical standpoint everything works well but increasing the shadow quality of the game caused massive frame drops. This became noticeable and I had to lower the quality to get a smooth game. In all this isn't your usual style of Visual novel, It tries to be different for better or worse. If you come into this expecting a traditional visual novel or something more akin to Telltales games, you may be disappointed. On the other hand if you approach this, curious about weird characters and an unusual murder mystery you might enjoy Knee Deep. It also helps that there is two more acts coming that are completely free with the purchase of the game.

I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

In classic mystery fashion, our three main investigators start with a seemingly simple suicide, only to unearth a snakes‚Äô den of unsavory characters and forces.

The overall plot backbone is constant, but your conversation and reporting choices open unique subplots and relationship angles: Will he make his cocaine pickup? Will one main character expose another‚Äôs dark past? Who lives and who dies? I‚Äôve enjoyed playing through the game several times, trying to uncover new story angles and clues. One thing is for certain, the Act 1 conclusion was completely unexpected and has me dying (no pun) to get my hands on Acts 2 & 3.

This is NOT a game for world explorers or physical clue gumshoes. The designers hold to the stage metaphor and focus your attention on one scene at a time. The 3D world is stage-minimalistic. The sets and lighting nicely capture the nightmarish quality of a backwater town on a hot, muggy night. The 3D characters and their animations are simple but effective. The music was a pleasant surprise for me ‚Äî haunting and ear-worm worthy.
