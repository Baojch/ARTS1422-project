My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

[i]These are all reskins of exactly the same game![/i]  What value is there in this spam/pollution glutting the Steam store for gamers?  This valueless copy + paste garbage is taking up marketing space for genuine indie developers who are doing the right thing.  It's harmful to the industry and to gamers.

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no options to change the resolution for the mobile app or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this mobile app is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this mobile app will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality mobile phone graphics. 

The mobile app features simple, cartoony 2D graphics, of the type you normally expect to see in low effort mobile apps.  3D graphics programming does require a degree of skill and competence and unfortunately not all developers have the budget or talent to deliver this, despite 3D graphics cards hitting the mainstream in the 1990's.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Gnomes Garden didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the mobile app, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the mobile app didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for clearing the first roadblock, which you can do in just a couple of taps on your iPhone screen, but only around 11 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the mobile app.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the mobile app.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this mobile app was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the mobile app.  But this isn't consistent with the achievement stats, that show only 11 percent of players bothered playing the mobile app for any reasonable amount of time.  How is it possible for this mobile app to have so many concurrent players who weren't even playing the mobile app?  Trading cards.  Players will use card idling software to collect the cards and sell them, but this won't trigger any achievements in-game.  That tells us people only really bought this mobile app for trading cards, and that's a damning indictment of the woeful quality.  A closer look at the numbers shows the mobile app just has a couple of players every week running up the mobile app and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $5 USD, on app stores, it's free. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay FIVE BUCKS FOR A FREE MOBILE APP just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this can be played free elsewhere, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.  Who do they think we are?

Collection game from 2015.

Construct buildings, remove obstacles, repair damaged bridges and restore the beauty of the royal garden. This is so in the first game of the series and has not lost its appeal to this day. From a technical point of view, not much has changed in this game principle to this day.

A well-made collecting game. And it is fun. There is an increasing difficulty tree, but it remains rather easy. The cards are well made, rather minimalistic, but therefore easy to overview. The annoying thieves don't steal in this early game, just nerf.
The story is more of a hook, but it fits the game.
New games have been coming out again and again for 8 years, and it will be the same again this year. That speaks for the popularity of the game.
I can recommend it.

[h1] Gnomes Garden [/h1]
Sammelspiel von 2015.

Baue Gebäude, entferne Hindernisse, repariere beschädigte Brücken und stelle die Schönheit des königlichen Gartens wieder her. Dies ist so im ersten Spiel der Serie und hat bis heute seinen Reiz nicht verloren. Spieltechnisch gesehen hat sich bis heute an diesem Spielprinziep nicht viel geändert.

Ein gut gemachtes Sammelspiel. Und es macht Spaß. Es gibt ein aufsteigenden Schwierigkeitsbaum, es bleibt jedoch eher leicht. Die Karten sind gut gemacht, eher Minimalistisch, dadurch jedoch gut zu Überblicken. Die nerfigen Diebe stehlen in diesem frühen Game noch nicht, nerfen halt nur. 
Die Geschichte ist eher ein Aufhänger, aber sie passt zum Spiel.
Seit 8 Jahren kommen immer wieder neue Spiele raus, auch dieses Jahr wird das so wieder sein. Das spricht für die Beliebtheit des Games.  
Ich kann es empfehlen.

Oyun ilk olarak 18 Aralık 2015 tarihinde yayımlanmıştır.

""Gnomes Garden ""da oyuncu, babasının krallığını kötü bir cadının pençelerinden kurtarması gereken bir prenses rolünü üstlenir. Oyun, her biri oyuncunun tamamlaması için yeni bir zorluk sunan seviyelere bölünmüştür. Zorluklar arasında yapılar inşa etmek ve yükseltmek, kaynak toplamak ve işçileri yönetmek yer alır.

Oyun fantastik bir dünyada geçiyor ve grafikler parlak ve renkli. Müzikler neşeli ve tuhaf bir atmosfer yaratmaya yardımcı oluyor. Kontroller sezgiseldir ve oynanışı öğrenmek kolaydır.

Oyunun güçlü yanlarından biri de oyuncuya sunulan zorlukların çeşitliliğidir. Seviyeler giderek daha zor hale gelir ve oyuncu her birini tamamlamak için farklı stratejiler kullanmalıdır. Oyuncu geri dönüp her seviyede daha iyi bir skor elde etmeye çalışabileceğinden, bu oyunun tekrar oynanma değerine katkıda bulunur.

Genel olarak, ""Gnomes Garden"" eğlenceli ve ilgi çekici bir zaman yönetimi oyunudur. Aşırı sinir bozucu olmadan iyi bir meydan okuma sunar ve renkli grafikler ve büyüleyici müzikler oynamayı bir zevk haline getirir. Zaman yönetimi oyunlarını seviyorsanız veya oynamak için eğlenceli ve rahatlatıcı bir oyun arıyorsanız, ""Gnomes Garden"" kesinlikle göz atmaya değer.",1676673865,1676673865,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False,True,,,

首先游戏的核心玩法过于简单且重复性过高。每一关卡的目标基本围绕着修复桥梁、清除障碍、采集资源、建设建筑等固定模式展开，随着关卡推进，游戏并没有引入足够多的新元素或者复杂机制来保持挑战性和新鲜感，玩家很容易陷入机械式的操作循环，久而久之难免产生厌倦情绪。

其次虽然游戏号称是策略游戏，但实际上战略规划的空间相当有限。游戏中资源管理的策略深度并不够，决策过程往往过于直白，缺乏深度思考和策略布局的乐趣。玩家通常只需按照既定路径执行一系列预设步骤即可过关，缺少真正的策略博弈成分。

此外尽管游戏画面和音乐确实温馨悦耳，但技术层面的表现略显陈旧，尤其在动画效果和交互设计上，对比同期同类作品显得较为落后。同时剧情线较为薄弱，游戏角色缺乏个性发展，难以引起玩家的情感共鸣。

再者系列的多部作品之间迭代内容增量不大，新作更多像是原作的扩展包，而非独立创新的作品。对于那些已经体验过前几部作品的老玩家来说，可能会觉得《地精花园》新版本的诚意不足，缺乏实质性的升级和新增内容。

总结来说，以其童话般的艺术风格和轻松的氛围的确能吸引一部分轻度玩家，但在游戏机制的深度、关卡设计的多样性以及持续游玩的价值方面表现得不尽如人意。倘若开发商能够在未来的更新或新作中解决这些问题，注入更多的策略元素和创意内容，那么《地精花园》系列才有可能真正赢得广大玩家的长久喜爱和认可。",1675409053,1711977312,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

No, there is nothing particularly new and different here, when compared to other time-management games, and the story is a bit weak and lacking in charm IMHO. But seriously, this genre is not to be taken too seriously, since they are basically relaxing games to pass idle time.

보통은 자원이 생산되는 곳을 적정수준으로 업그레이드 시킵니다.
또한 일꾼이나 마법사의 기지를 업그레이드 하여
생산수를 증가시켜야만 클리어가 가능한 스테이지도 존재합니다. 
또, 액티브 스킬로 
일정시간동안 이동속도증가, 건축시간단축, 시간정지 스킬이 있습니다.

[b][u]▲ 장점[/u][/b]
- 복잡하지 않은 전략게임
- 가성비 높은 게임(90%세일 자주 함)

[b][u]▲ 단점[/u][/b]
- 약간은 긴 플레이타임을 요구.(많이 지루하진 않음)

[b][u]▲ 총평[/u][/b]
- 초반 15스테이지 정도까지는 정말 어려운 게임이라고 생각했습니다. 
 하지만 반복해서 플레이하다보면 금방 적응합니다. 
 시간정지 스킬을 얻게 되면 그때부터는 쉽습니다. 
- 또 이 게임은 시리즈가 몇개 있는데 나머지들은 버그도 많다는 리뷰도 있습니다. 
 'Gnomes Garden 1,2,3'만 구입하시는걸 추천합니다.

[h1] The basics of strategy games[/h1]

It is a strategy game that uses workers, Wizard, 
and guards to remove and repair various obstacles to achieve stage goals.
Usually, you need to upgrade where the resources are produced to an appropriate level. 
There are stages that can only be cleared by upgrading the base of workers 
or wizards to increase production.
In addition, there are active skills that increase movement speed for a certain period of time, 
shorten construction time, and stop time.

[b][u]▲ Pros[/u][/b]
- Uncomplicated strategy game
- Games with high cost performance (90% sale often)

[b][u]▲ Cons[/u][/b]
- Requires slightly longer playtime.(not meant to be terribly boring).

[b][u]▲ Overall review[/u][/b]
- I thought this game was really difficult until the first 15 stages or so. 
  But if you play it over and over again, you get used to it. 
  Once you get the time stop skill, it's easy from then on.
- There are a few series, but there are also reviews that the rest have a lot of bugs.

[u]Zeitmanagement[/u]

Ein heißer Sommer ließ den wunderschönen Garten des Königs vertrocknen. Als auch der König selbst erkrankt, ist das Reich in Gefahr. Jetzt liegt es an Dir, die Rettung zu bringen - für den König und den Garten.

Der erste Teil der Serie ""Gnomes Garden"" von 2015 sieht auch nach 6 Jahren noch zeitgemäß hübsch aus. Die Musik im Hintergrund ist angenehm fröhlich und lässt sich eine Weile anhören. In gewohnter Manier darfst Du etappenweise alles reparieren, was zu reparieren ist. Dazu schickst Du zunächst einen Arbeiter los, um Ressourcen zu sammeln: Nahrung, Holz, Steine und magische Kristalle. Später wird es notwendig sein, die Anzahl der Arbeiter zu erhöhen, indem Du deren Haus erweiterst.

Da die eingesammelten Ressourcen nicht ersetzt werden, heißt es: baue Sägemühlen, Steinbrüche usw. - dafür ist das einsammelbare Material gedacht. Später kommen noch weitere Gebäude dazu, die die nötigen Ressourcen herstellen können. Um die Produktion zu beschleunigen, kannst Du die meisten Gebäude verbessern, was erst einmal Ressourcen kostet, sich aber in längeren Runden immer lohnt.
Manche Gebäude ""produzieren"" Leute wie den Feuerwehrmann, der in bestimmten Runden gleich zwei Aufgaben hat. Lass Dich überraschen, welche Charaktere Dir noch zur Verfügung stehen und was diese zu erledigen haben. Und kleine nervige, grüne Goblins werden Dich auch noch ärgern...

Zum Erringen von maximal 3 goldenen Sternen musst Du die Runde innerhalb einer bestimmten Zeit schaffen. Je weiter die Zeit abläuft, umso weniger Sterne erhältst Du. Die Sterne haben am Ende nur für die Trophäen/Errungenschaften Bedeutung, Du kannst die Runde immer zu Ende spielen, auch wenn die Zeit für Sterne abgelaufen ist. 

Anders als in manch anderen verwandten Spielen kannst Du keinen Fehler machen, indem Du eine aufgesammelte Ressource am falschen Platz verbaust und Dir dann diese Ressource fehlt, um an anderer Stelle weiter zu kommen. Das bedeutet, Du musst den Ablauf nicht genau planen, sondern kannst einfach drauflos spielen.

Жил-был Король, который очень любил природу. И возле своего замка он разбил огромный удивительный сад. 

Каждую весну в день рождения своей дочери добрый Король объявлял праздник. И съезжались на этот праздник не только люди из окрестных земель, но даже из далёких уголков королевства.

Но случилась беда: сухое лето и суровая зима погубили королевский чудесный сад. А за ним стали гибнуть и сады по всему королевству. Пришла весна, и когда Король не увидел своего дивного сада, слёг он от горя с тяжёлой болезнью. 

Дочь Короля решила, во что бы то ни стало восстановить королевский сад. В старинных книгах прочла она о семенах волшебных деревьев. Посадишь их – и чудесный сад снова расцветёт. Однако путь к ним далёк, и принцесса отправилась в дорогу…

В детстве принцесса видела горы из окна своей комнаты. Она смотрела на них и мечтала побывать там, на заснеженных вершинах. И вот добравшись к ним она повстречала гномов – о их мастерстве ходили легенды, а в моменты вдохновения они были просто незаменимы. По сей день никто не знает, откуда они взялись. Не говоря уже о том, зачем они нужны. Пообещав балы и придворную жизнь, они согласились помочь в нелёгком деле принцессы.

За горами лежал речной край. Место, где рыбаки и рыба находят дуг друга. Множество мифов ходило в королевстве о его обитателях. Как добрых, так и страшных… Но это не останавливало принцессу на её пути: добыть волшебные семена для сада и спасти Короля!

Только от Вас зависит – оживёт ли королевский сад, зацветёт ли он пуще прежнего, сможет ли выздороветь Король. Будут ли воспевать потомки Вашу доброту и смелость или всё канет в небытие…

Помните: принцесса на то и принцесса, чтобы заботится о своём королевстве!

THIS IS ALL A SUGGESTION you won't make me feel bad if you don't read or use any of this.

1. A Camp
If there's one thing I noticed when playing the game is that it gets pretty repetitive and by that I mean having to start over again and again can get pretty annoying. But I have a solution! you can give a chance for players to build their own garden that doesn't reset like a camp and you might think well it might get a little to over powered of they are able to constantly farm resources and build what ever they want done whenever they feel like it well you can make it so you can make things in your kingdom cost more to build and you could have a level bar too which can indicate what you can unlock like having to be at a certain level in order to unlock: better upgrades, better workers, more buildings, and points that can let you expand or can let you get special items that can boost your farms/resource collectors.

2. A Button That Turns Off Worker Sounds
This one may not be essential for gameplay but can be annoying to some players so it could be nice to be able to turn that off. 

3. More Resources
It would be nice to have resources that you can turn into other resources like raw stone could turn into cut stone using  a stone-cutter which then could then turn into stone bricks which you could then use with planks that you got from converting wood to create walls(decorative). Plus there could be a more mining options like there could be ways to click on random geodes(It could look like a boulder with the mineral sticking out of it) that are scattered across the map that are scattered across the map or if you upgrade you quarry to the second last level then you can upgrade it again with gems which ultimately gives you a 1 out of 50 chance of getting 1 gem from your quarry.

4. Expansion
All of this could be a DLC that you buy for the game and this could be included
Expansion just means that as you level up you unlock more areas(or you can use resources to do that) and by doing that you give the player more space to build.

5. Gems
Gems can be payed with real money or can be earned from completing quests(more on that later) and could help: pay for resources you don't have, pay for something to speed up help you unlock buildings, and/or trade them withe the shopkeeper/traveling trader.

6. Friends
By adding a friends list you could add a friend to see their kingdom.

7. Shops 
You could add Shops so players can be able to trade goods for gems!

8. Quests 
you could add quests so that players have something they're trying to complete for gems, goods and building blueprints.

9.END 
That's all that I think would be great to add.

hopefully someone nice

Наш король был заядлым садоводом и очень много времени посвящал выращиванию растений и озеленению страны. Особым предметом его гордости был дивный сад...

Но однажды случилась беда: в королевство пришло жаркое, засушливое лето, и всем садам, в том числе и королевскому, настал пушной зверёк с ценным мехом. Король от огорчения слёг с инфарктом, а, так как лечили в те времена прикладыванием подорожника и кровопусканием, возникла угроза смерти правителя. И тогда принцесса решила отправиться в путешествие, чтобы раздобыть волшебные семечки и восстановить любимый сад короля...

Геймплей , в приципе, ничем не отличается от других проектов данного жанра.

У нас имеется карта, состоящая из сорока восьми уровней, и на каждом уровне мы будем заниматься расчисткой завалов, строительством лесопилок, ферм и каменоломен и выращиванием деревьев.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1987492867  
На каждом уровне у нас будет несколько заданий, которые нужно выполнить для успешного выполнения этапа.

В нашем распоряжении есть несколько трудолюбивых гномов, которые и будут заниматься всем вышеперечисленным. Достаточно кликнуть на сваленное дерево или груду камней - и они начнут работу. Можно задавать целые цепочки заданий, что немного упрощает процесс.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1987492911  
Стоит иметь в виду, что ""релакс-режима"" в игре нет, на каждом уровне нам придётся уложиться в отведённое время, а это иногда бывает не так-то просто.

[i] Кстати, ресурсов будет постоянно не хватать, поэтому нужно тщательно просчитывать свои действия: чему отдать приоритет, а что оставить на потом. [/i]

Постройки, такие, как ферма, лесопилка и каменоломня, можно улучшать, на что, разумеется, тоже будут уходить драгоценные ресурсы.

Для облегчения процесса у нас имеются бонусы: ускорение бега работников, повышенная скорость работы и заморозка времени.

В принципе, игру можно проходить, не обращая внимания на тикающие часики, но если вы хотите получить всё достижения, а не просто пробежаться по уровням, то придётся постараться.

Вот, собственно, и весь геймплей, простой и незамысловатый.

[u][b] Графика [/b][/u] неплохая (разумеется, для игр подобного жанра), цвета достаточно яркие и приятные, а персонажи забавные, этакие сказочные герои. Нас ждут разнообразные локации: леса, заснеженные равнины, горы и так далее. В общем, ничего необычного.

[u][b] Музыка [/b][/u] незатейливая, она сопровождает игровой процесс и, в принципе, не надоедает и не мучает уши. Звуки оригинальностью не блещут, но довольно органично вписываются в геймплей.

[h1][b] Итог [/b][/h1]
[b] Обычный тайм-менеджмент, ни прибавить, ни убавить. Залипательный геймплей, простой, но забавный сюжет, приятная картинка, плюс достижения и карточки. И цена по скидке всего пятнадцать рублей. Более того, это первая часть из целой серии игр про трудолюбивых гномов, прынцессу и волшебное королевство, так что история не заканчивается... [/b]

[h1][b] Общая оценка - хорошо [/b][/h1]

[b] ""Gnomes Garden"" рекомендую в первую очередь фанатам тайм-менеджментов, а также тем, кто любит получать достижения. Да и родителям тоже: игра вполне подойдёт для того, чтобы занять детишек. Отправляйтесь в путешествие по волшебному королевству, но будьте осторожны: совершенно непонятно, что вырастет из волшебного семечка. [/b]

2.点击一个被障碍阻挡的目标时，只会显示最短路径，但并不会去除一些暂时无法完成的事件（比如被蜜蜂阻挡的地方，它并不会适宜的显示那条正常通关用的较远路径）
3.点击一些需要特殊前置条件的地点，它不会提示你该去哪里完成（同样比如蜜蜂，你还要再地图上慢慢找蜂巢在哪里）

Levels would be challenging for younger players and those who have trouble concentrating or planning.

Pros:
- Each level lets you take as long as you want/need, despite the timer.
- The tutorial is very effective.
- Despite not being a proper puzzle game some levels do require levels of strategic planning, as well as a little luck.
- You can continue on with the story regardless of how many stars you earned for the previous levels, as long as you finish the level before moving on to the next.
- You can pause and restart levels whenever you want, and you can replay levels whenever you want.

Cons:
- This particular version of Gnomes Garden has no ability to cancel an action once you've put it into the queue.
- Young players will find it frustrating or impossible to try and achieve 3 stars on every level.
- I was unable to wipe my progress or start again under another player's name, meaning that once you've finished it once, your scores stay in place (but you can still play all of the levels again).",1561789999,1562390530,True,1,0,0.527897000312805176,0,True,False,False,False,,,

» Storia - 2/5
Storia veramente, ma veramente semplice: sei la principessa del tuo regno e vuoi restaurare ""il giardino del regno"" in seguito alla malattia di tuo padre perché le due cose son collegate.

» Musica e Grafica - 3/5
Per quanto riguarda entrambi non c'è molto da dire: nessuna delle due è eccezionale o particolare. La musica si sente che è fatta bene nonostante la ripetitività, mentre la grafica non merita nulla più della sufficienza

» Controlli - 3/5
Allora, in realtà il voto basso non è per i controlli, i controlli sono ok (fai tutto con un clic del mouse) il vero problema sono i comandi che dai agli gnomi. Il gioco funziona così: dai uno o più comandi in coda ai personaggi fino al completamento del livello, il problema è proprio la coda perché i personaggi non hanno intelligenza artificiale quindi se pensate di raccogliere un oggetto lungo strada mentre il vostro gnomo torna dopo aver costruito una cosa non sarà mai così, anzi, tornerà al suo posto e poi andrà a raccogliere. Può essere frustrante se volete prendere tutti gli achievement e completare un livello entro il tempo limite per le 3 stelle

» Achievement
Tutto sommato semplici da fare, basta completare il gioco al 100%.

» Considerazioni Personali
Mi sento di consigliare questo gioco nonostante la sua mediocrità perché è comunque più che sufficiente per passare il tempo con dei ""rompicapi"" o se volete solo accumulare giochi da completare al 100% senza troppa fatica.

Вы играете за принцессу, которая управляет работниками. Управление осуществляется только посредством мыши. Игра состоит из 4 разных земель, на которых расположены 49 уровней. Каждый из уровней имеет свои собственные цели, которые необходимо выполнить. Выполнив все, вы получите 3 звезды (это пригодится вам для получения одного из достижений). В игре есть специальные бонусы: увеличение скорости передвижения работников, ускорение выполнения работ, замораживание времени уровня. Все бонусы предоставляются с ограничением по времени, но спустя время их можно использовать повторно. 
Графика в игре приятна глазу и не утомляет. Музыкальное сопровождение ненавязчиво и позволяет расслабиться и получить удовольствие от игры. 
В игре 23 достижения, которые легко получить. Имеются коллекционные карточки.
Особенно хочется отметить, что в игре есть русский язык!

Ein schöner Garten ist immer wichtig, gerade für eine Prinzessin. Dumm nur, daß ein besonders trockener Sommer unserem Garten arg zugesetzt hat. Also gilt es, Pflanzensamen zu sammeln, um den Garten wieder neu erblühen zu lassen. Allerdings ist das nicht so einfach. Baumstämme oder schlafende Steinriesen versperren die Wege. Um letztere aufzuwecken bedarf es einer Fee. Um die zu bekommen braucht es ein Feehaus und auch magische Steine müssen produziert werden, damit die Fee arbeiten kann. Für den Steinbruch braucht es unter anderem Steine. Zum Aufbau des Steinbruchs brauchts Holz, dafür brauchts ein Sägewerk und dafür brauchts ne Bäckerei. Und so hängt denn genretypisch alles von vielem ab und wir müssen praktisch alles auf den 49 Screens wegräumen und aufbauen, um den Level zu gewinnen.  

Das ist aber auch ein Problem des Spieles, denn auch wenn es technisch funktioniert und insgesamt recht nett gemacht ist. Es fehlt an Abwechslung. Die Level sind meist ähnlich aufgebaut, man geht auch fast immer ähnlich vor. Richtige Herausforderung gibt es nicht. 

Und so ist das Game denn ein ganz netter Zeitkiller, mehr aber auch nicht und so einige Genrekollegen machen denn doch eine spannendere Figur.

It's in similar vain to the 'Hercules' or the 'Moai' time management series.

Apparently the king had a beautiful garden which quickly withered in a nasty summer heat wave. The thought of which made the King enter into a black incurable depression. The only hope left is for the princess to venture forth throughout the 49 levelled kingdom collecting seeds from 7 magical trees and bring them back to the castle and finally celebrate your victory with a gnome ACDC concert.

The biggest gripe with players is the level of difficulty for those that want to 100% this with three stars and unlock all 23 achievements. Some levels are really difficult. For instance, one woman claimed she was at a level for 2 hours and still couldn't pass it. Personally I had trouble with 6 of them, out of which I would not have been able to work out and pass by myself, if it wasn't for the accommodating Steam video guide that someone has taken time to produce. Thankfully with his guide I was able to pass the game 100% while keeping my temper in the realms of not needing to be detained by police.

Unfortunately if you make a mistake and upgrade some buildings that you did not mean to, you can't right click it and stop the upgrade, also there is no numbering system which shows you the order in which the gnome workers are attending to the tasks you have set out. Which are usually two handy tools which those that play these click fest games love using.

In final, if you like to pull your hair out when you see that third star fade away just before you are at the brink of completing the last task. If you enjoy shouting expletives to never ending little green boogers that parade around your screen clobbering your worker gnomes. If you enjoy the physical exercise of trying to break your computer chair over your knee only to succumb to throwing it at your monitor when you realise that your upgrading something you don’t need to and don’t have enough resources of what you do need. Believe me when I say this, this is the game for you.

One of the hardest levels as a sample for you...

[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]

Game Visuals

I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.

Game Audio

I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.

Gameplay

There are no difficulty game modes to choose from. All levels has their own difficulty.

This is a strategy game, where careful planning is required, due to the limited amount of resources that are available.

There are four different landmasses with the total of forty-nine levels. Each of the levels has their own objectives that need to be completed.

Tasks objects can be chained together. Only if there is nothing in the way and/or enough resource material in the storage bins.

All levels have a total of three stars to be earned. The stars represent how fast the level is completed. Replaying the levels can help improve the amount of stars that has been earned.

There are special bonuses in the game to help complete the level much quicker. All the bonuses come with a time limit but they can be reactivated once their bar has filled.

There are twenty-four different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked.

Miscellaneous

There are five different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.

Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.",1520795430,1603832145,True,11,0,0.609498679637908936,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Ein kurzes Spiel für Zwischendurch, bei welchem sich jeder 12 Labours of Hercules Spieler sofort heimisch fühlen dürfte.

[b][i]Story & Gameplay[/i][/b]

Die Handlung ist recht simpel. Dein Vater, der König, ist krank geworden und sein wunderschöner Garten verwelkt. Um ihn wieder aufzupäppeln, ziehst du als mutige Prinzessin los um neue Pflanzen aufzutreiben. 
Um an diese Pflanzen heran zu kommen reist die Prinzessin durch verschiedene Gebiete, lässt ihre fleißigen Arbeiter Materialien (Nahrung, Holz, Stein und Kristalle) einsammeln. Damit können diese dann Gebäude bauen oder verbessern, Hindernisse bei Seite schaffen und vieles mehr. 
Auf diese Art darf man sich durch 49 Level klickern, denn gesteuert wird komplett mit der linken Maustaste. Im Verlauf des Spieles kommen dann noch 3 Fähigkeiten hinzu:
1. schneller Laufen,
2. schneller arbeiten,
3. Timer anhalten.
Der Timer ist aber nicht wirklich wichtig, er legt lediglich fest, wie viele der 3 möglichen Sterne man nach dem Abschluss der jeweiligen Mission erhält. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist durchwachsen, manche Level sind recht leicht, andere sind schwerer, sodass für jeden etwas dabei sein dürfte.
Es ist auch möglich zu „verlieren“, also Steckenzubleiben. Dies passiert. wenn man die Ressourcen in der falschen Reihenfolge einsammelt oder das falsche Materialgebäude zuerst baut. Ein klein wenig Strategieverständnis und vorausplanendes denken kann also nicht schaden. 

[b][i]Grafik & Sound[/i][/b]

Die putzige Cartoongrafik passt in meinen Augen sehr gut zum Spiel. Die Figuren sehen niedlich aus und die Karten und Gebäude sind liebevoll designt.
Die Musik dudelt recht belanglos im Hintergrund ohne wirklich aufzufallen, dementsprechend gibt es dazu auch nicht viel zu sagen.

[b][i]Fazit[/i][/b]

Wer Spiele dieser Art mag, macht hier definitiv nichts verkehrt. Wer die 12 Labours of Hercules Reihe gut fand sollte hier auf jeden Fall mal einen Blick drauf werfen. Auch die Erfolgsjäger sollten sich Gnomes Garden einmal zu Gemüte führen, denn alle Achivements sind leicht zu bekommen. Das einzige wirkliche Manko ist in meinen Augen der Preis. Dieser liegt bei aktuell 6€, was ich für 5-8 Stunden Spielzeit recht hoch finde, zumal andere Spiele dieser Art deutlich günstiger zu bekommen sind. Wartet am besten auf einen Sale und schlagt zu wenn der Preis bei 1-2€ liegt.

While there is nothing inherently wrong with Gnomes Garden, it is simply just decent time management game that you will most likely forget five minutes after finishing it.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Gnomes Garden is a typical casual time/resource management game: you have 1-3 workers, whose task is to gather resources (food, wood, stone, and crystals) to spend on production facilities and on clearing road obstacles that prevent you from reaching the end of the stage.
Problem is, the developers knew how the core mechanics of such a game work, but they had serious issues with the details. All gameplay elements are introduced in the starting stages, leaving nothing than endless repetition for the majority of its 49 levels. At least reaching gold times on them is a challenging task; maybe a bit too much, I regularly had about 1-3 seconds left on the clock.

Interestingly, the game uses 3D models, meaning it is more demanding than most titles in this genre. But that is not why it has such a mediocre score, but because it does absolutely nothing to stand out in the sea of similar time management games: there is next to no story, the atmosphere is generic fairy tale, the whole game is… bland. Good enough for a casual game, but not even the least bit memorable.",1477071631,1477071631,False,33,2,0.756481826305389404,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Gnomes Garden ist ein schönes Zeit-Management-Spiel und hat Ähnlichkeiten zu 12 Labours of Hercules, was das Spielprinzip angeht.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Der König und sein Reich brauchen deine Hilfe, da die Gärten immer weniger werden und diese so langsam verschwinden. Da kommst du ins Spiel und dein Abenteuer  beginnt. Du schickst deine  Arbeiter Ressourcen einsammeln, diese werden dann genutzt, um Gebäude auszubauen oder Hindernisse zu beseitigen. Allerdings brauchst du schnelle Reflexe und Strategien, um 3 Sterne in den Levels zu bekommen. Das Gameplay kann von ganzer Linie überzeugen und geht gut von der Hand.

Die Geschichte des Spiel´s ist sehr simpel. Rette den König welcher schwer krank wurde, weil seine Gärten langsam absterben. Hierzu spielt man die Tochter des Königs und wird von den Gnomes Tatkräftig Unterstützt.


[u] Einstellungen: [/u]

Verschiedene Einstellungen sind unter Optionen möglich. Aber sind eigentlich nicht weiter notwendig.

Das Spiel besitzt 23 Errungenschaften welche man Problemlos erreichen kann.

Gefühlt fast so gut wie die Hercules Serie.
Dessen Grafik ist z.B. noch ein wenig besser, da die Hintergründe einfach wirklich super gezeichnet sind. Hier hat man zumindest nette Grafiken und FullHD wird unterstützt.
Spieltechnisch jedoch sind beide quasi eine Liga und es macht auch echt sehr viel Spaß und man suchtet es von Anfang bis Ende in einem Stück durch.
Gegen Level 20 wurde das Spiel ein wenig sehr schwer, vielleicht hab eich auch nur die Level falsch angepackt.
Danach wurde es jedoch wieder gut ausgewogen balanciert und man konnte jedes der 50 level zumindest im 2ten Anlauf auch direkt mit Gold abschließen.
Die Story ist wie bei allen dieser einfachen Indiespielen flach und nebensächlich erzählt.
Die Errungenschaften sind in Steam alle sehr gut und in einem Rutsch zu erzielen, den 100% Spielstand sollte man also mitnehmen.

Like for 12 Labours of Hercules, the main character isn't helping at all. In other words, it's the servants that are doing all the work. Gnomes Garden is a casual time management game where you have workers that are gathering resources needed (food, wood, stone and crystals), building mines (for the stone and crystals), farms and windmills (for the food), workshop (for the wood), upgrading these for a better production and  repairing routes and other objectives (like light a fire or activate portals). However, the servants can be helped by witches (needed for some objectives) and firemen (helping objective plants to grow or to scare the little monster that will incapacitate your witch or servant from doing their jobs for a few seconds). And you'll repeat that  for 50 levels.

However, there are temporary bonus, regenerating over time, that can be activated : run faster (your minions move faster), work faster (less time for the building to give the resources) and stop time (the timer is frozen for a limited time). And these are very handy if you want to reach the three stars. Indeed, you have a timer. If you go past a star, you're loosing it. The less time you spent, the more likely you'll keep three stars. And as it's an achievement, you're also motivated. Nothing is wrong to loose one or two in the first run, so that you can try different strategies for the level. However, keep in mind that sometimes, you need to manage tightly your resources: you may be lacking some of them when they're needed and can't advance anymore (example: no more stones for a hole in the road - the building that could have given you the resource is behind this hole and there is no other road to it - you're doomed to restart). One of the good points is that you're not limited in the tasks done by the servant, if you want to gather 3 woods and 2 foods, you can check them without restriction (compared to 12 Labours of Hercules where you couldn't indicate more than 3 tasks).

As you can see, the gameplay isn't hard per se, it's just a matter of being efficient and to make the right choices (no need to upgrade a building to the maximum if the current level is sufficient or to upgrade the house - I've made the majority of the levels with two workers only). However, you don't have any other characters that can help. It's just the minions, not even the princess is present in the level to do something.

The graphics aren't bad in itself, they're cute, however, the HUD could have been more reflecting this and the list of objectives less confusing. The soundtrack was also good.

However, Gnomes Garden, while being still enjoyable, didn't have the same magic than 12 Labours of Hercules. You have more stuff to manage, true, but you can't choose your difficulty, the map is poorly designed and there, you don't have really any help from an heroin, contrary to Hercules and Megara, that were present and needed for some tasks. For the price, 12 Labours of Hercules proposes more fun for less money spent. But Gnomes Garden is still a good little game.

When a blight hits the land and destroys all the gardens in the kingdom it's up to the princess to restore them back to their former glory.

A fine task to undertake but gameplay is relegated to clicking things as they pop up until you eventually win.  Later levels do ramp up the difficulty slightly by requiring optimal play to earn all three stars on a level.

Good level design with lots of renewable resources, so the strategy is mainly in figuring out when to build and upgrade production centers. Hard to get completely stuck, but sometimes challenging to get three stars. I missed getting three stars on about a third of the levels the first time around, and liked the game enough to want to go back and replay them.

Major downsides:

The sides are cut off in fullscreen mode on a 4:3 monitor, occasionally cutting off things you need to click on. It mostly works in windowed mode, but the resources needed tooltips are sometimes cut off, so you have to guess what you need, and the window's too small to play comfortably. (Or maybe I just need new glasses.)

A bug with the same achievement popping up every five seconds when I replayed levels after completing the game. Irritating enough to make the game unplayable unless I turn off the sound.

Clickable areas aren't well defined and are sometimes misaligned, so when objects are close together, it can be difficult to click on the right thing.
