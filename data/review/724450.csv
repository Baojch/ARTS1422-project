I don't know how you can screw up a rail shooter but these lads have done it. All packing in a whopping 56mb! You get 3 levels, stolen assets and a UMP that can only carry 9 bullets! 

In this outstanding 15 minute adventure, you kill zombies, spiders, zombies, spiders and what do you know; a random boss. The hardest parts are timing your reloads, and hoping to God the AI is slow enough to let you reload in time to shoot them, there are no health pick ups so if you get hit, well that's all you get for the rest of the level. If you die, you go back to the start of the level. Also good luck predicting when the zombies or spiders will be coming because sometimes you're walking for about 20-30 seconds, listening to the repetitive footsteps with absolutely nothing happening before, BANG! A generic zombie or spider appears out of nowhere, you'll probably have a heart attack with their sudden appearance because they literally pop out of thin air.

There are two bosses in this amazing experience, one in level 1 and another in level 3. Don't ask me why there isn't one in level 2, maybe because they didn't want to spend a little extra on a random model they can find on the asset store. They require so much strategy and that is...Just shoot them. Mash that left mouse button, not on specific places that signify weakspots, no no. Just keep firing and they'll fall down eventually.

There is no ending by the way, once you complete the third level (which is easier than level 2 for some reason) you will get the generic ""level complete"" you unlock an achievement that will be the equivalent to the Noble Prize (I will be showing that to the world, thank you very much) and...There's nothing you can do from there. You can click that ""next"" button all you like, nothing is going to happen.

But hey, at least the game ran at 1500fps.

Don't waste your time with this game as I did. Buying this for 50p was not worth it the slightest.

I have made a playthrough of this game because why would I miss the opportunity?
