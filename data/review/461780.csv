Moonstone Tavern - A Fantasy Tavern Sim! is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, ""Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.""  Like all RPG Maker ""games"", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.

While the premise of this RPG Maker asset flip is that you run a tavern, that's not exactly what it's about, you run dungeons to progress in the game, and they're terribly, horribly unbalanced.  If you die, you suffer a permanent HP loss that you can't recover... the game design here just sucks completely.  It's a pretty incredible achievment to be worse than most RPG Maker asset flips, which in turn are some of the worst things on Steam, but here we are.  

As with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for ""professional"" game development.

Like most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  But this only appears around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

Moonstone Tavern - A Fantasy Tavern Sim! is stupidly expensive for an RPG Maker pixelcrap asset flip at an eye watering $8 USD, and it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.

Personally, I have fun playing the game. I just played about 10 hours and will play some more until my tavern is in better shape. Sure, it was bumpy at first, but I am a perfectionist, so the first round (a few in-game days) is always to learn the basics and some strategies to make it better on the second start.

Some feedback to the bad reviews or advice for potential new players:
After ""get the barkeeper back""-quest and getting some silver coins from the cat: go to the stables and rebuild the fountain, the familiars will learn the spell ""heal"". The familiar will use it automatically on you both or you can press the button ""4"" to activate heal (unlimited), just to be sure. You won't die anymore on ""easy"" quests. Hire a basic cook for human meals and try to get a standard egg. With standard familiars, you can clear ""medium"" quests and with rare familiars ""hard"" quests"" (though I have to press ""4"" repeatedly). I didn't get very rare yet, but that's for ""impossible"" quests.

If the familiar gets stuck somewhere, press ""1"" to call it back to you. It get's stuck if it can't reach the focused enemy on the other side, if you are too fast or sometimes, it get's stuck on the same place as the enemy. Just press ""1"" (pet control hotkeys). You can't see the HP of the familiar unless you want to use a potion (you can go back without using it).
I am just letting my familiar do the fighting - no difference in exp or skill points - and just collect the loot. I am even not carrying any ammo or potions with me, useless spending.

I bought this game cheaper with a code for less than a coffee, so I don't have any negative feelings about it. I like the concept and this will be fun for me for a week or two.",1631039773,1631039773,True,2,0,0.534302592277526855,2,False,False,False,False,,,

So I beat the game today, but what I find is that I was pretty underwhelmed by the ending. I guess the real quesiton is.....what ending? It lasted like 5 second and there was like zero fighting. There was about 8 lines of conversation.

The concept of the tavern running is pretty good, and its fun upgrading the tavern and getting rich and famous from it, the issue lies that as other have said, it feels fairly disconnected. While I like that I dont have to deal with the grunt work of getting mats for meals or anyhting (becasue I pay tehm to do it, why should I?), there seem to be a lack of people who treat you as the owner, your own staff barely know you exist and aside from ugrading, there is nothing else to do at the tavern.

It would have bene pretty neat to have little options where you can get drunk and vomit or do things with the customers, however none of that exists.

As for the combat, I went more of a minion lord than a person who actually fights, and that worked pretty good for me. I like that aspect becasue if I am rich enough why not have a bunch of hired thugs to do your bdding right?  TRying to fight yourself is a nightmare though because the controls mixed with the choppy movement and screen chopping makes it near impossible to fight anything, hence you must rely on your minions to do the fighting for you 90% of the time.

Your spouse is also extremly disconnected, they only have a single line of text they repeat over and over and over and they don't even do anything aside from laze around in the room repeating their one line conversation, which was a pretty big dissapointment for me becasue I like to have at least a pretended relationship in a game. It felt as though I was forced into an arranged marriage to a broken record.

This game should be concidered a game simialr to that of Adventure Capitalist with elements of a dungeon crawler, becasue thats all it really is, a simulated tavern without any real interaction.

Although, I did kind of enjoy it a bit, would have been nice if the game was not lagging 100% of the time on a computer that runs Planetside 2 and FF14 on extreme graphics with no problems. I am not sure why the un-neccessary lag but it certainly affects the enjoyability of the game.

So far it seems to be a working product. Yay! Which is great, as this game implemented alot of neat and entertaining ideas and gameplay. I seen it'd been patched and reinstalled it. To my pleasant surprise, it installed. I started up the game and wasn't disappointed. The title screen came up, character selection engaged, the opening mini tutorial played. I got to actually see the Inn itself, wander through the stables and inn, talk to NPCs, cook a meal, go adventuring with a hireling and sleep. This is every bit of fun it'd promised to be. I'm happy for the dev to have fixed their product. It is a brilliant start, if not for the shaking launch, it could have been another Stardew Valley or Harevest Moon/Rogue RPG.

Unfortunately, this looked like a great title that wasn't getting a fair chance. As they say ""Buyer beware"" It has a neg rating for a reason. I almost wish there was a -- to give. I was one of the few lucky individuals who the game wouldn't even load properly. It downloaded and installed fine. It booted up fine. I selected my character and started the game...And that was it. It got stuck on this dream sequence like scene that didn't respond to any controls, not even exiting. I had to manually restart my laptop. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it to no avail. Now the game won't even start up, it has script errors. So save yourself the headache and move along.",1497662141,1503396703,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

There is clearly a lot of content, but it is very unclear how most things work or how to go about succeeding in a number of different tasks. I understand that not every game has to hold your hand, and the freedom is nice in theory (play the game how you want to play it), but this felt like one of those GBA ports you'd find in the bargain bin, play for 20 minutes, and never pick up again because the concepts were never transmitted to the user properly. 

Potentially my biggest gripe is the technical elements of the game. While the sprites are generally nice, you're locked into windowed mode. Even if you play full screen, you'll only be able to view the game through a roughly 800x800 window. Further, the sound is not great. the sound effects are kind of jarring and discordant.

It is now August 23rd at the time I write this review, and there has not been a word, or an update since that post.

Now, I normally don't write reviews about this kind of thing. Shit happens, people have lives. A small group of indie devs can have things come up. But it's been three full months. The dev's haven't posted or replied to anything on the forums in that time. They also gave absolutely no indication they were going on hiatus. They just took the money and ran.

Apparently this developer group has a history of abbandoning games. Their last couple hotel simulator games were abbandoned and left incomplete. This is just one more on the list.

Is it a bad game? No. Is it worth the money? Honestly, the $8.00 asking price is quite reasonable for what you get.

Should you buy it?
I wouldn't, the game needs work, and it doesn't look like its ever going to get it. If the game had any future prospect I would probably recommend it, but right now, while it isn't a bad game, you can do better with your $8.00.

I'll take those one at a time:

First of all, there's no way to change controls. That is kind of a bummer. I prefer using my keyboard for RPG's but oh well.

Second, the grammar/dialogue is a bit... Cheesy. I'm not saying it's bad, but it feels very awkward to read at times.
There's a lot of grammar errors, typos and it uses a very ""basic"" level of English. ""Hello, my name is [name], how might I help you?"", for example. It's not bad, but it feels weird.
A lot of times, I feel as if I read an old book when reading the dialogue and I'm not playing a game.
There's also times when the character (you) think/talk in the middle of a field. While enemies are attacking you. And you have no way to defend yourself in that case! More often than not, you're going to die.


Sadly, the game has some bad bugs.
Some of those bugs are - sadly - fairly game breaking. Such as having 3 Priests spawn on the same tile. I wanted to speak with one of you guys, not all 3...
It's also possible to get married in this game, but again, I ran into a MAJOR bug related to this.
To meet your - I think only possible - wife, you have to go visit another village, which requires you to repair a bridge. Hey, makes sense!
Except not.
By complete accident, I was checking up my tavern and found a new NPC that I hadn't seen before. I spoke with her as - I thought she was a new Priest as it said a priest had come to visit me. She told me she wanted to marry me. And that to do so, I needed to grab an item for her.
Needless to say, I was up for that.

I then head to the other town, sit through some (sadly very cheesy) dialogue and... Wait. It's the exact same girl? What the...
So yeah. I met her IN MY TAVERN before I was supposed to be able to meet her. ...Yeah. That happened.


Finally, the biggest bummer of them all - the fighting system.
You start the game with 1500 HP. You might think that it's a lot, but no, it's not. 
Enemies can gang up on you - more often than not, I fight 3 or 4 enemies at once. And each of them can deal 250-500 damage! There's no recovery time, either. I've had SEVERAL enemies attack me 3 times at once, each attack dealing like 530 damage (that's about 1600 damage and I had about 2600 max HP!)
With no recovery time, ONE MINOR ERROR and you're dead.
The fight system is also very clunky - like I said, one enemy can attack you 3 times quickly, but your attack animation is so slow, I stopped fighting. I left that to heroes that I hire (or lives in my cottage) and my familiar while I just run from point A to point B. I find it much easier - and faster, for that matter.


Here's some warnings for newbies:
The time progress is VERY fast in this game. In fact, do NOT assume you'll make a lot of Silver - the money in the game - early on. In fact, just do the first quest that the cat guide/NPC gives you. Talk to him again for 150 Silver and use that money to bet on the arena.

Time NEVER stops in this game, unless you're in the menu or the game is minimized - so if you have to AFK, minimize the game or enter the menu. Do not leave the game running thinking nothing will happen, because it WILL.
You're talking to NPCs in game? Tough luck, the time progress as normal.


Get a human cook ASAP! The best you can get (from what I've seen) is a female one. She costs 10 silver per day and cooks 10 meals per day. Now, if you were to buy meals from the nearby camp, that's 8 silver/meal. Needless to say, that becomes VERY expensive VERY quickly.

So, why do I say I recommend this game, despite all negative things I've written up to this point?

Because they don't bother me as much as you might think it does. 
The game is VERY unforgiving early, but quickly becomes managable.
I wouldn't say the game is worth the full price - sadly - but I got it at 55% off, who am I to complain? 
If you can get it at half-off or a better sale, you have got yourself a really fine deal in my opinion. If the creators could fix the things I listed, I'd say it's worth the game at full price, but as it is now, at full price, it's sadly too expensive.

So, if you're out adventuring, feel free to drop by Moonstone Tavern!

It's a fun little game with a unique system. I love the option of making your own Tavern. All I really want is more more more though. I want to be able to modify my character a bit. I want a bit more of variety in gear or at least some more methods of improving my character's abilities. The way to accumulate money only ""seems"" hard at first but, once you understand a good portion of the mechanics you realize that gathering cash should never be an obsticle ever. It's just not done in the standard way of ""kill enemies and watch them drop money"". Which to be honest is actually a nice touch in my opinion. 

All in all this game could have much much more added to it. but, the unique premise just makes me want to greedily play it more and more and hope for vast additions to the game or just more additions to this type of genre.  8/10",1467455764,1467455764,True,10,0,0.57086491584777832,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Moonstone Tavern is an interesting concept, but very poorly executed. I'll spare lots of details to not be redundant, since many other reviewers have covered them, but it's all true: the terrible game mechanics (combat especially), clunky menus and interface, difficulty in earning money/getting upgrades, and so on and so on. 

My personal biggest problem with this game is that it's a blatant ripoff of the developer's previous game, Fortune's Tavern, which is currently no longer on Steam. Supposedly it's a prequel, but having the exact same graphics, music, gameplay, interface, and problems seems suspicious. And lazy. That's something I can't excuse here.

However, it is sorely lacking. It should have been developed more before being released.
Pros:
Nice art style, kinda like an old RPG.
Lots of freedom in what you do - sorta.
You can explore a lot.

Cons:
No instructions whatsoever, They tell you how to move around, but not where anything is, or how to do anything other than find the bartender. For God's sakes people, just put some signs up!
Quests are all the same. You literally find all the same quests in difficulties you can't choose.
It takes forever to get any money, especially in quests. This is compounded by the fact that you have to pay A LOT of taxes. I'd either remove the tax system, or make getting money much easier.
The 'romance' is flat, one-sided, and doesn't take any 'story' progression at all. Seriously, this game needs a lot more work before I'd buy it, even for eight dollars. Also, the movement is shoddy.

Overall, needs work. It's a neat idea for a game, but they went a bit overboard in terms of NOT THINKING about what they were doing. I returned the game for steam cash within two hours.

Sorry if this seemed like a bash on the developers. This could be a fantastic little game, but it's not nearly there yet.
Consider that before you buy the game.

The controls are... nonsensical is probably the best word to use. For instance, the escape button works to exit some menus but not others, and their claims of ""mouse 1 to attack"" seem to be incorrect. And also weird, because you wouldn't otherwise have your hand on the mouse at all. Further, gamepad support would be very helpful here, but of course it isn't present. 

And of course, no way to remap keys. Or at least not that I can find: the menus are another example of execution issues here. You can hit a button to bring up audio and graphics options, which launches a Windows options box with check marks and all, but doing so doesn't release the mouse cursor to you to actually have an affect on it, and therefore I haven't been able to click through the menus. 

I'd love to be able to say ""but the story/art/music is so charming that once you get used to the controls it's great"", but those aren't stellar either. The music is ok but not stellar, the art kind of irks me for reasons I can't quite put into words, and while the story (so far) is ok, the dialogue for it is weak. You don't feel transported to a magical land, you feel like you're still struggling to figure it all out. 

If this was an early access game, or it had had a lengthier QA / testing cycle (as in, getting someone who was willing to provide direct and honest criticism to play it), then it might be in a better state and poised to sharpen itself up with some patching. It doesn't at all feel like that's the case here.

It becomes clear pretty quickly that adventuring is what you are going to do, not quite so much of running the tavern itself, so the premise devolved into a generic 2d action rpg a little quickly.

It has both a main quest line and repeatable quests of various difficulty that strengthen the main character in different ways.


Pros - 

Lots of depth to developing the tavern

Enemies are fairly difficult to start

Marriage, familiar system, and hired heroes for a fairly large party (main character + 7 others that I know of)

Crafting system to make most gear, as well as food for the tavern and other things

Cons - 

Heavy lag inside the tavern, less in combat but still enough to slow the game down and make fighting more jerky than it should be

While there are many different enemy sprites, there are apparently only two kinds of enemies (melee and ranged) with no real distinction between any of them; higher level enemies sometimes move and attack faster, making them very dangerous, but there's no inherent difference between a dragon and a blob of goo.

Bad follower AI, party members often get left behind or trapped inside enemies and unable to fight

Clunky UI, mouse works in some areas and not in others

A lot of terrain that looks like obstacles but isn't

You are given quests which help you gather materials to create better equipment and stats, but also ingredients to make meals for your tavern guests, or find a priest to help exorcise your haunted rooms. Fun extra are unlocked as you play, such as the arena where you can place bets, but also challenges like the dreaded tax collector!
Overall I am having a lot of fun with this game. The enemies are challenging but not impossible, there are a ton of quests and assignments so you're never unsure of what to do, and you have a ""pet"" (I say pet since my current one is a giant blob of goo!) companion that battles with you, and you can gather more with different abilities. There is a clock that gauges day from night so you may collect bills from your guests- I have never played a game before where the lighting in the game fades from light to dark as you play, to signify the sun setting/rising.

Tavern Management,

Creativity.

The Bad:
The combat,
the combat,
the combat. (this is 99% of the game)
This makes some bad third party NES titles look like they have good combat programing. This is like Cheetahmen bad. If you do play, do not pick the fighter class, you will just die. Do not pick the guns, you will run out of ammo and will not have enough ore to make more, then die. See latter but with mage. Pick the Ranger class with both guns and wands and you may have a chance to not die, but no gaurentees.
The platform/programming. 

This is a rush title with an amazing premise. It is sad that the developers chose to rush out the product instead of taking the time to produce a quality piece of software that would be solidly enjoyable. I played for a little under an hour and was completely underwhelmed. I wanted the negetive reviews to be trolls, but they aren't. This game is plagued with legitimate problems and should be labeled an early access title in its current state of completion. It is in a very rough beta at best.

Yes it's unpolished, but the devs are trying to take care of that.  Others are hating on how difficult/simpistic it is.

But there's a pattern to everything.  As of this review, all you have to do is remember six dates:  the 5th, 15th, and 25th then the 6th 16th and the 26th.  The first three are when the arena happens and at 1900 the organizer needs rooms for his guys.  At the start an easy 300 gold.  The second set of dates is when the true archvillain of the game shows up, the tax collector.  Seriously?  What tax collector shows up that many times in a single month?  He's pocketin most of your harrd earned cash, no doubt.  But, if you stockpile meals with the cook, open rooms slowly, you can easily deal with these obviously over TRITE obstacles.  Just kill/gather enough to make up the differece and soon you'll be able to wander/kill/gather/kill to your herat's delight.  And as a bonus, please take this into consideration:  At 0600 (the start of the new day with the management screen popping up)  everything resets.  So, if you're in, let's say, a DRAGON HORDE MISSION, and you've cleared everything out  and it's close to 0600, just wait there until afterwards and watch every chest close and refill with goodies.

The game opens up with having you teleport to this epic, fantasy land, where you're there to claim your inheritance from an aunt; an aunt who just seemed to of owned a tavern and has left it in their will for you. After a few minutes in, you'll discover that the tavern is understaffed and dilapidated, and requires your hard work to return it to its former glory.

Part of the game involves you searching around the rather giant map, looking for ingredients to help feed your guests, as well as repair the tavern itself. Unfortunately, in ""RPG-land"", there's no such thing as safe, hence why there are monsters for you to battle all over the place. Thankfully, you won't be doing it alone, as the game has a pet system employed to help you protect yourself. This system isn't the type of thing that simply got shoehorned in, as in actual fact there are 50 familiars (pets) for you to take along with you and help train up.

Aesthetically, the game may disappoint some people with the fact that it is an RPG-maker game, but thankfully the developer themselves have opted to implement their own art assets for the game. Ultimately, this has only increased the enjoyment of the game, especially when you spend some time searching around the dilapidated areas in the game.

---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Moonstone Tavern is the latest game from Michael Flynn, the developer of other great and original RPG Maker games: Apocalypse Hotel, Star-BOX, and Fortune's Tavern: the Fantasy Tavern Simulator.

I have all of Flynn's other games, lacking only a couple of DLC, and I immediately added this one to my wishlist when I saw it on Steam. So bear in mind that I'm a bit of a fan; Flynn's games have been the most enjoyable RPGMaker games that I've played.

Moonstone Tavern plays a lot like Apocalypse Hotel, but in a fantasy rather than a zombie-infested, post-apocalyptic setting. You play a very green adventurer who inherits Moonstone Tavern from you aunt, whom you've never met. Arriving at the tavern through a portal, you are greeted by your aunt's talking cat, who guides you around the tavern and grounds and introduces you to the basics of the game.

If you've played Apocalypse Hotel then you'll be familiar with the gameplay of Moonstone Tavern as well: alternately manage and improve your tavern, and go out on adventures in search of loot and resources to use on the next round of tavern improvements.

Graphics - Moonstone Tavern is a RPGMaker game, so the graphics are as you'd expect for this engine: generally quite nice low-res graphics, in this case with a fantasy theme. The tavern itself and all of the maps I've seen so far are well designed and nicely laid out.

There have been a number of reports of poor graphics performance, and my laptop has these issues when playing Apocalypse Hotel as well, which I put down to issues with the RPGMaker engine on this hardware. However, I've not run into the same problems with Moonstone Tavern, which is a welcome surprise. The developer has been working with the community to try to identify and resolve these issues, in any case.

Sound - Sound isn't the best. The cancel sound (when pressing escape to close a menu) in particular is grating and too loud, but most of the other sound effects are okay. The music is quite nice, but seems a bit too electronic for the setting; I'd expect some nice classical flutes, rather than the electro vibe I get at the moment.

Gameplay - When you start a new game you get to choose the sprite you'll control for the game, as well as the generic 'class' of your character, based on his or her ability with magic, swords, and guns.

Gameplay is extremely similar to Apocalypse Hotel, but in a fantasy setting. In your 'safe zone' -- the tavern -- you wander around keeping track of stats, talking to guests, and tending to the running of the hotel. You then venture out of the safe zone into the surrounding areas, killing creatures that respawn each time you enter the map and collecting the loot you find, which is hopefully what you want to further your tavern enhancements.

It's a formula that works well and keeps you playing for longer than you mean to, with that ""just a little more"" feeling dragging you on to the next map, to complete the next quest, or to get enough silver to upgrade the next room. Unfortunately it doesn't include Steam Achievements, which would make this striving feel a bit more worthwhile.

Personally, I've been running into the same problem I had with Apocalypse Hotel, although not to quite the same degree: I keep running out of ammo and other necessary resources. I'm not sure if it's intended to be this way, or if I haven't quite got the hang of it yet, but each time I've played I've fairly quickly exhausted my ammo supplies, relegating me to melee combat whenever I venture out in search of food or other supplies. And I also keep finding myself changing map without intending to.

[h1]==========================================================
-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
Pros:
+ A good sense of humour
+ Tried and true formula, polished from Apocalypse Hotel
+ Lots to do! Moonstone Tavern will keep you busy for a long time
+ Responsible and responsive developer, with a proven history on Steam
+ Trading cards

Cons:
- It could use a copy editor: ""Choose the character which you'd like play as.""
- The cancel sound (pressing escape from a menu screen) is awful
- Hard to get started; not enough ammo, and basic resources are expensive, although the gift of silver near the start helps significantly
- It's sometimes hard to tell when a dead-end pathway on a map is just a dead end, or whether it will lead to another map
- No achievements

[h1]==========================================================
--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------
==========================================================[/h1]
I really like Moonstone Tavern. It's a nice fantasy rework of Apocalypse Hotel and although it's not quite as original anymore, it's still a very good game.

The lack of Steam achievements brings it down a little, as do the numerous errors in the writing, but the cat-led tutorial works well and there's plenty to do once you get the hang of how the game works.

Most of the problem-solving will concern you precious Tavern, which to be fair is pretty beaten up, so you’ll have a lot of things to fix, build and many people to hire. One of the cool features is the ability to change the class of your character after you’ve created him and played for some time. You can change your gaming style and complete more quests this way.
You’ll get to meet and interact with cool characters like elves, funny gnomes, brutal orcs and many others. You can also find, collect and even breed your own pets that sometimes, but not always, come with some useful abilities. In any case, it’s always interesting to see what hatches out of those eggs you find. There’s also an Arena – an interesting way to earn money without doing anything. You don’t need to fight, just place bets and see who wins!

The death part is also something I found to be interesting, even though your character loses 10hp when you die, your heath points will go back up.  I like the fact the when you die, you do not need to reload your game, you just reappear in the tavern to continue where you left off from.

As someone already pointed out in a review, Performance Issues seem to be the only issues with the game so far, and that was taken care at most cases.

You get a big Tavern to run, a Hatchery for your pets (yes, a whole pet hatchery system) and a big world to explore. Beside the normal tasks that you will get from running the Tavern, there is much more to be done in-game, and the tutorial day will get you started with pretty much all you need to know. Day and night cycle, and each day will sum up how much you did with your tavern, listing both expenses, taxes and of course, profit. 

A lot of the game is set on exploration, so do not expect to be told about everything exactly. Some things you just have to go and give it a try (like Arena fights or promotions where you can get extra currency or special items). A whole lot of the game is based on completing some tasks so others can be unblocked (or used, like most buildings). At all times it will be required that you do your best from a day, and that implies task>exploration>task routine.

Graphically it has a lot of ""eye-candy"", as everything is done in pixel-art style and always looks coherent with the rest of the scenery elements. From a visual appealing color palette to the little nice animations here and there, pretty much everything adds up to the gameplay itself. The tunes are nice and match the magical dimension you are playing in.

The user interface is very simple and works great too, the only think I would ""touch-up"" is really how the dialog system behaves. I would add extra smoothness to it, but it turns out to be a detail as they work perfectly as is (and I mean, you can always clearly read what you are supposed to read). I would point out the resolution issue, but it seems the development team is already at it. And maybe a couple of achievements would also add out to the experience and hook up players even more!

So if you are still wondering, I'd say go for it. It's a game you get to love very quickly and for the work obviously put into it the price tag is really low ;)",1463247385,1463247403,True,17,0,0.595239937305450439,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Hey there, if you're being discouraged by the bad reviews note that almost all of them are due to performance issues. 
It doesn't seem to be optimized the best since I'm also getting fairly poor framerate, but I'm fairly certain that has more to do with my system than the game itself. He did update for a ""no effects"" option and that has helped slightly.

The game has been very charming and entertaining so far. The visitors to your tavern all have different quirks and stories to tell, and the variety of crafting/pets its nice.

For its price I think this game is well worth it, especially if you have a system that can handle it well. Hopefully it will be optimized a little better here in the soon future for people like myself.

I'm not sure how limited RPG maker is, but I do have a couple suggestions for the developer, other than making the game run smoother.

1: Maybe make it so loot from baddies is auto picked up when walking over/near it.  Sometimes when an enemy dies their loot gets sent flying behind some trees and it can be quite difficult to find.

2: More random events within the tavern.  These travelers and heroes have character and it would be fun to see them interact more, maybe get into bar fights, have a druid accidentally set something on fire, that sort of deal.  I'm not sure if these are already implemented as I'm still pretty early into the game.

3. Customization. Lots of people enjoy personalizing and making something their own.  If possible maybe implement some sort of decorating system. (different flooring, wallpapers, rugs, tables, mats, etc. That can be placed where they want, so you can make it different.)  It will make you feel more so like you've actually built it up from the ground. 


Just a few suggestions, but otherwise its a real solid game so far, just needs some polish.  Keep up the hard work and keep updating the game and it could go far.",1463238012,1463238012,True,12,0,0.526126325130462646,4,True,False,False,False,,,

Still, even with a few problems and frustrations, I've played the game for four hours, so it isn't all bad!

I've found the game feels very unpolished and clumsy, and if I had known the game was in this state, I would not have purchased it.  However, I love the premise of the game, and I'm going to hold onto this game rather than request a refund, in hopes the developer will polish it up a bit and make it run smoother.

The framerate is terrible, and moving around it feels like the screen is constantly making tiny jumps, instead of smoothly flowing with the motion of your character. The tutorial is barely adequate, with a talking cat helping you find your way along a little.  Combat was confusing to me, and my familiar ""passed out"" as well as myself passing out (-10 max health after awakening in the tavern) and I have no idea how to see how much life my familiar has.

UPDATE on screen jumpiness: Turning off effects helped a bit, but I'm still having troubles, and my computer, although two years old, isn't poor by any means... Still, I watched a couple videos on YouTube of this game, and noticed others are able to run the game fine without the screen jumpiness I experience while moving.

In town, the menus are clumsy, and I learned the hard way I can't simply switch from purchasing to selling items, without first exiting the purchase screen (by hitting esc) then hitting sell to get the sell menu.  I ended up buying something I didn't need by accident trying to switch screens instead.

I think this game might be fun after spending some more time getting used to how poor the UI is, and maybe taking some anti-seizure medication for the screen jumpiness.  here is hoping the game improves with time and patches.",1463169582,1463515933,False,89,4,0.794928491115570068,7,True,False,False,False,,,

Well, first off, I got this game for free to play, enjoy and do Let's Plays of. When I first started, I started with out a class, which in all honesty, was funny. Other than that, starting out, things worked great! Tutorial was pretty straight forward, (im just an idiot at times XD ), Things start off easy, getting customers and making food and all that. I like how you have to manage things, like making sure you have money to pay any employees you hire, cleaning up sick guests messes, the diversity of the races you have in your Tavern, etc.

   A familiar, a great ally that can heal you, once you get a fountain repaired, is a wonderous thing. Even better is when you can repair cottages and have heroes to help you out. Makes things much easier to deal with, so you can gather more resources needed for things, like making food or crafting your own gear. And in the recent updates, you can ride a unipony, though I've yet to find one. And there's new merfolk beds just recently added as well. Combat is pretty fun. I've yet to try other classes, though I've been a Sword Saint since the beginning. 

    Each weapon has a interesting effect/animation when you attack regularly, like the Fall Sword has a bunch of stars that come out when you hit an enemy. Underworld sword has fire. Even heroes have weapons like that as well. Your allies don't die either, they just get knocked out. You can revive them with revive potions too. When you lose all your HP (if it doesn't bug and transfer control to a allied unit, though you should either let the hp get to 0 or rush the quest, cause if you strike at all with a companion, the game will crash)  you go to your room in your tavern, so there's no game over.

    You only lose a small amount of health or magic, which isn't a big deal! There's a few side quests, as well as the main ones and the quests you get from your customers. There's varying difficulties as well, ranging from easy, to impossible. I Suggest you don't take impossible, unless you have a couple allies with you, that being a familiar and at least 1 or 2 heroes. It's a fun, casual RPG. A lot of the time, it's hard for me to quit the game, even after finishing an episode of it, because it's addicting to me. Like all RPG's though, there IS some grinding, but you don't have to grind too much, really. Oh! Also, there's someone that everyone 'loves'. It's the Tax Collector as well! Giving him other things, like food or piety helps reduce the tax costs, though, if you're making enough money and don't want to sacrifice anything else, pay in full. 

    It's honestly not that much, compared to what you'll be making. Basing the taxes on number of people and rooms and such, can be a pain, but it's nothing you can't fix :D. The music is fairly interesting too. It seems to change after every few screens I think, I couldn't pinpoint the timing on that ha ha. Things only got better with updates/patches. Over all, it's a fairly enjoyable game! Sure, it had some bugs here and there, but most of them weren't game killing. By that I mean, making your game crash.

[h1] My Background: [/h1] 

I’ve been playing games by FlynnFour Games since I backed STAR-BOX on Kickstarter. I have al ow/average pc and so I enjoy it when low spec games like these are produced with modern ideas. If you feel it matters, I am a girl.

[h1] The Review: [/h1] 

This game is two things in equal measure: a sandbox tavern sim, and a quest oriented, action RPG.

The first it does well, immersing you in the daily chores of a tavern manager in a fantasy world: mopping up sick, speaking to guests, hiring staff, setting prices, repairing leaks, chasing of rodents, dealing with bandits and hauntings, and generally upgrading the place to make it more accessible to a whole host of humans, gnomes, dwarves, fairies, and so on! As for the quest oriented RPG part it does this fine, not amazingly, but fine. There are plenty of different quests to go on from finding  eggs to hatch to collect new pets, through collecting resources, to slaying dragons. It is let down very slightly by the combat which is basically shoot stuff with guns and wands, or hit them with your sword (depending on your class). Personally I prefer to rely on breeding up a strong accompanying pet, or hiring heroes rather than doing much fighting myself. You still get all the rewards and XP if you let your companions do it, so I just run around foraging the maps as they do all the killing.

One of my favourite parts of the game, as you may have guessed, is the creature breeding. A talking cat has told me that there are around 50 collectable and breed capable creatures. You begin with two working stables although you can upgrade to five (please devs add more I hate sending pets away). You can get new eggs by going on quests and by breeding your creatures using genetimagic (don’t know how to pronounce that). Breeding creatures is simple yet fun, although crafting the magical ingredients can be difficult.

Crafting is a huge part of the game. Alongside cooking there are so many armors and weapons, magic potions, scrolls, and magic gems that it can be, at first, a little overwhelming. Learning where to get all the ingredients from (which there are definitely over 100) is a challenge in itself.

There is of course a story, and although it uses some common fantasy tropes, such as a blight spreading across the land, it does so in a way that is new and interesting. I especially like that the elves seem to be the bad guys, although, as in all games by these devs, the whole world is cast in shades of grey rather than in black and white. The story is also linked directly to your success as a tavern manager which is obviously important. I’ve not finished the main storyline yet but I think I’ve guessed where it is going due to reading some of the books located throughout the world.

[h1] My Last Hour of Play: [/h1] 

In my last hour of play I purchased another tavern (you don’t get to manage it but you do get profit).

I went on a quest for some magical ink to write out a scroll but I still need to find a feather before I can craft it. I got killed by some orcs in a mine. I did my daily forage and was annoyed that I got no feather. I spoke to my guests and met some new ones (all guests have a funny few things to say – definitely worth talking to. I tried to get married but there is a curse on my potential husband and need to go on another quest.

Pros:

- So much to do – although can be a little overwhelming.

- Great characters that you can talk to and get quests from.

- Interesting story.

- Can start as one of ten different characters and six classes.

- Beautiful pixel graphics.

- Breeding pets!!!

Cons:

- Simple battle system – although can be mostly ignored.

- I have to turn off weather effects when its blowing as it makes my computer lag. (2009 laptop)

- Sound effects need to be more varied.

- No journal so you have to remember what to do or go back and ask again if you forget. In a normal RPG this wouldn’t be so bad but it’s easy to forget when you’re running a tavern.

- No window mode!?!

Overall I would give this game: 8/10 – However you must be aware this is an RPG Maker game, and not a AAA title.",1463149673,1463149822,True,60,5,0.617838740348815918,2,False,True,False,False,,,
