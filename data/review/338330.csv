Арена в которой бродим по мелкой локации и убиваем монстров, тикает таймер. Дотикал до конца - конец игры. Ну во первых тут нет никакой одиночной игры... Есть возможность создать комнату на локальный мультиплеер и зайти туда одному. Но одному скучно проводить даже один раунд, а не то чтобы залипать в игре. В меню есть онлайн режим, но он не работает и не конектит к мастер серверу. Единственное, что позволит вам получить удовольствие от игры - живой друг и второй джойстик для него, а лучше 3 друга (ведь тут до 4х игроков). Хотя надолго ли вас хватит гонять в это? Крайне не рекомендую.

Lots of fun but VERY BRIEF and NO ONLINE PLAY. 
Overpriced for what you get. 

(Might be playable online via Steam Remote Play but I've never gotten that to work successfully yet.)

Now, that I have that out of the way, I can recommend this because it -[b]is[/b]- actually lots of fun.
That's the key point, this game is a lot of fun. 
If it were fun but not -as- much fun as it is, taking all other aspects into account, I would have recommended against it.

[code][h1]SUMMARY:[/h1][/code]
A nice person gave me a copy. 
You will not be playing it with me because you CAN NOT play it with me! 
Once you figure the mechanics out the CPUs won't stand a chance.

The controls take some getting used to but this is a good game if you plan on playing it LOCALLY with multiple controllers (maybe with your siblings, cousins, or niece or nephew or something). I could recommend it for that situation. It runs pretty well on low-end computers too. THERE IS NO ONLINE PLAY.


[code][h1]MAIN:[/h1][/code]
If you're one of my local irl friends, then you probably won't be reading this - you probably don't even have a Steam account. I do happen to know a few people who might enjoy playing this locally with me, though.

If you're one of my online friends, don't think you'll be able to pick this up and play it with me, though; it just won't happen. Online Multiplayer is non-existent even though the developer tags for the game say that there is Online Multiplayer. The servers for the game are no longer hosted and what would have been better is if they'd allowed the players to host their own servers like certain -other- top-selling games available for personal computer.

This isn't Pokemon or Animal Crossing where you have to worry about item duplication; therefore, there's no reason why they needed to NOT allow users to host the game server other than the stats marque which is irrelevant now anyways because no one is playing online - because they CAN'T.

So, even if I really like this game (and I really like it quite a lot actually), I can not recommend that my online friends get it because it has NO ONLINE PLAY.

Personally, IF I were able to play this online with my friends, I'd most definitely be recommending it to them. I really wanted to play this online with them. You can still play with the CPUs so this game isn't unplayable as it is but that's all that there is to it. It has no single-player minigames or story-campaign or anything. Only multiplayer mode - & the only reason that mode is playable as a single player is because of the CPUs. (You can also do a round by yourself without any CPUs but that's pretty pointless aside from learning the controls.) The only problem with that, and why it's no substitute for playing with real people is... [b]Once you figure the mechanics out the CPUs won't stand a chance.[/b]


[code][h1]CONSOLE VERSION MIGHT BE BETTER
(good luck getting all your friends to buy a console, lol):[/h1][/code]
Based off of what I've read, it MIGHT have online play on the console version (no guarantees), though, you may be finding yourself paying a subscription fee for online services in that case... 

(not to mention that it's not going to be worth it to buy a multi-hundred dollar console just to play this game, if you don't already have the console, 
which you might but your online friends (whether you met online or they just moved far away) may very well be in the situation where they'DON'T already have an expensive console to play this with you 
- AS WELL AS the fact that (personally) I'm more inclined to play a game like this online with my friends on the personal computer than on a console where I could play a ""triple A"" racing game or animal town building game with them instead & also prefer to use consoles for local play). 

For those reasons, the PC version is kind of like a bad port. (Which at any time they could make could by implementing that ONE change... but they probably won't...)


[code][h1]OTHER ISSUES & ADVICE:[/h1][/code]
Also,
The game also tells me I can press F1 to review the control instructions during a battle - no, actually, that didn't work.

Also,
The game does not stop when someone pauses, local, online, or by yourself; this is probably preparing you for it to be that way online, where it makes most sense, by treating multiplayer with CPUs the same way. This isn't an issue but in local multiplayer, the pause screen covers the entire screen, so even if you're just popping in to turn down the sound effects volume, it can be used to effectively obscure the screen for all players.

I'd say just ignore what is going on in the background when you pause to read the control instructions but I wasn't able to pause to read the control instructions for the previously mentioned reason that I couldn't get them to open during a match. Also, you drop your weapons when you die. It's not a big issue since weapons are super easy to get in this game but the best way to learn the controls is probably through trial an error - I'd recommend doing so on the Dungeon stage since it's easier to stay out of the line of enemies that will kill you (making you have to wait 5 seconds for a respawn) on the Dungeon stage.

非常像素风的画面，而且整个游戏的大小还不到70M，看起来目前大部分的独立游戏都是像素风格的，这个趋势也不知道是好是坏。所以对画面要求不高的，或者喜欢像素风格的玩家，估计会很喜欢这个类型的游戏吧。

[b]游戏性[/b]
单人游玩的体验其实不是很好，就是只能刷刷小怪，捡各种武器，正键攻击，反键防御，空格是跳，跳起来能躲过敌人远程攻击。有体力槽要求，体力槽消耗完，无法进行攻击。这个设定大部分游戏都有，就不细说了。
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1872066863
武器种类很多，有散弹枪，炸弹，弓箭，法杖，定时炸弹等武器，玩起来感觉打小怪的难度基本上没有，只要反应的过来，小怪是连摸都摸不到你的。
而且目前的地图数量也不是很多，模式也只有两种，一种是杀别的玩家和小怪捡取掉落的金币（小怪打死都会掉血瓶，每个血瓶能恢复15点生命值），在要求的时间到之后，获得金币最多的玩家获胜。另一种好像是把地图里的一个宝箱打破，然后将物品运送到己方基地就可以获得分数，时间到之后，获得分数最高的玩家获胜。
可选的人物，目前除了人物外貌和皮肤的不同，没见到什么特殊的技能，所以，单人玩起来只能打打小怪，其实还是很无趣的。
而多人模式的话....匹配了一会，根本没有别的玩家加入，不知道这个服务器是怎么运作的，是亚服连接不上外国人还是游戏人数太少，都是有可能的。
所以不建议没有基友的玩家购买，毕竟又是个撕逼游戏，这个游戏以目前的玩法和内容来看并不是特别推荐。
而且游戏没有中文，慎重。

[b]声音[/b]
声音太过于重复，而且像素风特别强，有种小时候玩小霸王时候听的那种音乐（要强得多，但是没法和星露谷那种游戏比），打击音效也太过于单纯，如果多人玩，你倒是不会太过在意，但是我是一个人玩这个游戏，所以如果挑刺的话，这个声音还是不太喜欢的。

6/10
没有基友就不要买这个游戏了，单人模式真的是太无聊了。打一打小怪最后赢了挺没意思的。

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Regardless of which class you are, the stakes are extremely high! Who of the four contestants will collect the most coins? 3..2..1… IT’S ON at the Super Treasure Arena!

Super Treasure Arena is a local/online co-op game where you fight against three other competitors in six small top-down maps. The game has two modes to choose from: Free for All and Treasure Run.

In Free for All, you have to collect as many coins as possible, and in the Treasure Run, you have to carry has many treasure chests to your home base as you can. In both game modes, you only have 180 seconds to amalgamate either coins or chests and finish first in the battle.

After selecting which mode to play, it will be time to choose your character class, with five classes in total to choose from: Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Ninja and Mystic. Apart from looking slightly different, it really comes down to special ability. For example, the Warrior can activate the shield ability for a short period of time, and during that time no-one can inflict any damage upon him. Each class has its own ability which makes the game really fun to play. 

In each map, you will find weapons (shotguns, torch, bombs and others) on each corner and sometimes in the centre. As soon as you run over one, it will automatically become your main weapon, but don’t panic, you can revert to your favourite weapon with the LT button on your gamepad. Each map has its own enemies to deal with, too. At the Cove map, crabs and bandits might spot you and chase you for the kill - it’s madness! 

Each time you hit a foe, he will drop chocolate, presenst and different goodies. They are actually the coins, so run over them to acquire them. If you get killed, you will drop your goodies. . . Fun, Fun Fun! Find the chest and destroy it to collect more coins! 

Super Treasure Arena is not easy to master and it is part of the charm of this game. However, I think the controls should be better and you might find aiming with the projectile can be a bit of a struggle. I really like the pixel graphics and the soundtrack is good.

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

-	Nice pixel graphics
-	Good soundtrack
-	Fun and fast gameplay
-	Online and local co-op
-	Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 

-	Controls need to be improved
-	No trading cards

Whether you play online, local or against the AI, the next 180 seconds in Super Treasure Arena will be manic fun!

Una vez más hemos podido probar un juego independiente con arte pixelado, se trata de Super Treasure Arena, un juego de acción multijugador para hasta cuatro jugadores en linea o de manera local que nos hará sentir como si estuviésemos jugando en consolas de hace 20 años. El juego es desarrollado por el equipo independiente Vennril (Que cuenta con solo un integrante) y distribuido por Headup Games (Bridge Constructor, Dead Age, etc.)

Desde una vista top-down nuestro objetivo es conseguir la mayor cantidad de oro posible mientras intentamos destruir a nuestros enemigos, ya sean monstruos del juego, otros jugadores del online o nuestros propios amigos, creando situaciones caóticas que se vuelven super chistosas y emocionantes, pues puedes verte luchando mas por tu vida que por el propio oro que es nuestro objetivo. Las partidas son cortas, los mapas también son pequeños, haciendo que los jugadores se enfrasquen en batallas campales en pos de la mayor ganancia de oro, cada vez que eliminemos a un contrario su oro caerá por doquier y es ahí donde debemos apresurarnos a robarle antes de que otro jugador nos elimine a nosotros.


Uno de los rasgos mas divertidos de Super Treasure Arena son los distintos tipos de armas, que si bien no son muchas, son las suficientes, podemos encontrar bombas (Que a mis amigos MaironStyle y ^RINO33CR^ les hacía recordar con cariño a Bomberman), cohetes, arcos, varitas mágicas lanza fuego y escopetas, las armas mencionadas anteriormente se encuentran de manera aleatoria en el mapa de la partida y los personajes jugables usan armas de ataque cuerpo a cuerpo, de momento hay cinco razas o personajes distintos a escoger: Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Mystic y Ninja, cada personaej puede realizar un ataque especial el cual se carga en una barra y se llena conforme causemos daño a los demás.


Cabe destacar que el título esta en etapa de Early Access, más contenido, mejoras, “tweaks” y demás han de ser añadidas al juego. Podemos jugar de manera local en pantalla dividida con nuestros amigos en casa o en linea con otros jugadores -nos fué difícil encontrar otros jugadores para jugar. De momento existen dos modos de juego:

Classic: Nos invita a recoger monedas de cofres y de monstruos que encontremos en el mapa o que podamos robar a los demás.
Trasure Run: Es el mas difícil pues tienes que recoger un cofre con oro y llevarlo hasta tu lugar de “spawn” para poder ganarlo, pero no es tan fácil, pues cargar con el tesoro te hace caminar muy lento, lo cual los demás podrán aprovechar para acabar contigo.
Super Treasure Arena

El juego tiene soporte completo para mandos, nosotros lo probamos con control de Xbox 360, y la verdad encontramos que es más preciso jugar con el teclado y el mouse, esto debido a que debes ajustar hacia donde quieres disparar con el stick derecho y claramente el mouse permite mas agilidad para dichos ejercicios. Hasta hoy el juego tiene seis mapas y algunos podrían parecer muy similares entre si dando cierto aire repetitivo. También es posible jugar con los llamados bots, de modo que si estamos solos o con un amigo nada mas, los otros dos pueden ser controlados por el CPU.

Super Treasure Arena es sin duda una excelente opción casual para pasarla bien con nuestros amigos, cualquier computadora puede correr el juego, la descarga del mismo pesa 20mb -Si, 20mb nada mas. Un título que ofrece muchísimo más de lo que parece y tiene muchísima diversión para aquellos que lo compren (cuesta solo $8),  sumándole que está en Early Access y más contenido está por venir es una buena oportunidad para hacerse con el y ayudar a su desarrollador en el proceso.",1475246252,1475246252,True,5,0,0.539313435554504395,0,False,True,True,False,,,

DISCLAIMER: This game is still in Early Access. All thoughts and opinions therein are related to the game during its development state. Features/content are subject to change and not a final representation of the game.

I am a huge sucker for four player local/online co-op games, I love them. From Towerfall, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, Duck Game, and most recently Overcooked, these are all games that I have enjoyed immensely for many different reasons. From the distribution of tasks in Overcooked and Lovers, to the utter chaos in Duck game and Towerfall. These games all manage to bring a unique flavor and idea to the four player setting while drastically being different from each other.

For the most part, Super Treasure Arena has all the right ideas. Collect gold, kill your friends/npcs using a variety of weapons/classes. Whoever at the end of the round with the most gold wins. Sounds simple enough but that is where I find fault with the game. It is rather too simplistic, what you see is what you get, there is nothing really that separates this from the rest and makes it shine on its own. It's a chaos = fun equation that you see in these types of game.


That being said what currently is in the game is made rather well. You have five adorable pixel classes, two game modes, six levels with varied designs. The graphics are rather smooth and animations, explosions, effects all seem fluid and colorful. The UI is super simplistic and the game does feature controller support, although I found aiming a tad bit easier with my keyboard/mouse. Additionally the game does feature online support and local support which is no small and easy feature to include. (Multiplayer is scary to program)


Sadly, I didn't get to play any online matches as the community is still growing. The game does have Bots that you can use in the place of players. So I got a basic idea of how chaotic things can get. Of course that is the linchpin with these types of games, if you can't find a match or have four reliable friends to play with your not getting maximum enjoyment out of the game. Your mileage may vary and that is true with all games in the genre.

At the end of the day, I just want more out of this game. More classes, more game modes(CTF, Team matches, co-op, horde mode, etc), perhaps customization of our sprites, more weapons, you get the idea. The Steam page does make mention of more content in the future. What that content is and when it is released is yet to be seen. The core of the game is in place now it just needs to pull ahead and define itself.",1474785260,1474785260,True,12,0,0.582496464252471924,2,False,False,True,False,,,

Game is still in early-access as of writing this, more features will be added and changed. I Highly recommend.

I've put many hours int the original browser Treasure Arena because its an awesome competitive pvp game. This new version adds some new things. Two new classes, the ninja and the mystic, and new special abilities for every class (the warrior is similar to the original). Along with additional balance changes to gameplay to make players less invincible with a shield and well timed jumps.

I give the developer 10/10

EDIT: This game is missing some features from the original treasure arena. Until Vennril (the developer) adds back some old mechanics (sprinting and rolling, mainly, but also jumping while shooting) I will be playing the original treasure arena (which is free, and in-browser).
