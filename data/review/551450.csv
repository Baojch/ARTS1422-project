But I hit #1 on the leaderboards, so, that has to count for something.

It's wonderful to look at and plays pretty well, although I have some reservations about the control scheme (at least, playing on mouse.) Watching the enemy ships come apart is basically what kept me playing.

My first issue is a feeling of ""That's it?"" Admittedly, Furious Angels does advertise itself as a score attack shooter with different waves every day, so, I can't fault it for that, but I was just left with this feeling of wanting more from it.

My real issue is some of the enemies and how much feedback the game would give me. It feels like some enemies would kill me immediately, such as Bombers, or their missiles would be affected by how I was turning or manoeuvring. And sometimes I'd just get vaporized. Miners were similar, but at least's clear how they worked. What unites them both is how un-fun they became if a daily wave focused heavily on them. I've watched some videos on Youtube and it feels like I was dealing with a lot more mines and missiles.

I also find the system where if you travel too far from the carrier, it'd get ambushed and almost immediately destroyed by an enemy carrier to be more frustrating than anything else. The game doesn't tell you how far you can wander from your carrier, and I had a few runs where I'd be ejected from my tank upgrade at such a velocity that I'd fall outside the zone and see my carrier get blown up in seconds. Not fun.

The upgrade system isn't communicated ideally either. The core idea is pretty obvious. You get kills, you get a new type of weapon, and so on. Homing missiles, multi-shot, a laser beam. But I had to dig around to find out what the ""Mark"" system did (a global damage upgrade up to a maximum of five) and I'm not actually sure if that's communicated in the game anywhere. I also generally don't like upgrade systems that make optimal play sacrificing them early (you should immediately sacrifice your Mark 1 and Mark 2 tanks) and generally don't reward keeping them as long as possible.

All that said, for under $10 you can't go wrong if you want to fly around and blow stuff up. But it does feel a lot like a prototype of a game that might've had more upgrades, more enemies, more everything.",1706524935,1706525036,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Enough enemy variety to keep the combat interesting, but not so much as to overwhelm.  You have to prioritise targets and dodge or tank or ram enemies in an ever-evolving ship that keeps you on your toes, with each stage having different strengths and weaknesses and tricks to handling and damaging.

It's got the classic ""stop shooting to repair"" system, which I think fits really well.  You can play the game aggressively to max your combo, or you can play slowly and focus on trying to stay alive.  The twin health bars of your own ship and the mothership your are 'defending' really plays into the dynamic of the game making you think on your feet.

Each day the waves are randomized, however they are the same in the same order for each day.  This means that you can try repeatedly to learn today's pattern, but there's always a slightly new arrangement to come back to next time.  Each day has its own leaderboard, so you can chase the high score or see how you rank.

All flash but no substance.

✔️ 3D depth of the battlefield & detailed ship animations/destruction look good.
✔️ Ship velocity controls are precise & smooth.
✔️ Carnage remaining strewn across the ground below is a nice touch.
✔️ A few hard achievements to get that are based on skill.
✔️ Some added strategy using enemies to block incoming fire, ramming tactics & choosing when to 'shed' ship upgrades.

❌ Limited enemy types, environments & game variation.
❌ Basic weapon sound effects & only one music track.
❌ Controller vs. Mouse/KB players are at a distinct disadvantage regarding aiming accuracy & scoring potential.
❌ Tank ship engines are too easily shot out with a large impact on speed/maneuverability.
❌ No tracking of personal hi-scores/best runs, only daily point accumulation.

Somewhat easy to get into, decently hard to get a hold of, and generally a good pick for coffee breaks... Not always though!


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Furious Angels (FA in short) is all about... blowing stuff up. While trying not to die. All while babysitting the helpless mothership. And of course, get a good looking score. Oh, and there’s no campaign, no story, no upgrade grinding. Only explosions. And scores.

Your goal - face the endless hordes of enemies that want you and your mothership dead. Losing either is a Game Over. Stay alive as long as you can, get that big big combo, but your fate is sealed before it all begins. You’ll lose. As for how, it’s up to you to decide.

[h2]Controls[/h2]
Initially, the controls were awkward for me. It felt slow, and drifty. You can’t turn on a dime. FA is, you can say, more realistic in terms of handling.

Key presses on the keyboard translates to general (screen absolute) strafing direction, giving you the ability to make smoothly angled turns without actually having to use a controller. This has a side effect of causing movement in the unintended direction. The existence of inertia in a twin stick shooter might turn some people off. Luckily, some practice can easily get you comfortable with it.

Should you require more accurate directional controls, FA even allows you to use a controller for movement while your mouse does the aiming and pew-pew’s. Or you can just use the mouse alone if you want some self imposed challenge...

[h2]Enemies[/h2]
Enemies are separated into a total of 7 categories, which isn’t a lot, but there aren’t any two that are “more or less the same”.

Let’s see what we have: Jets, these come in swarms; Raptors are like copies of the player, faster, agile, and don’t hesitate in spitting a stream of shots in your direction;  Bombers waddle around, shooting homing missiles in 4; Scorpions fire 4 bullets with movement prediction; Miners lay homing mines with high damage (the most hated enemy ever); Impostors are a copy of your tank and like to flank you with a volley of fast traveling shots; finally, the Carriers spawn a lot of Raptors and beam your mothership with their huge ion cannon. That’s all you get.

The fact is that, even with such a limited cast of enemies, they can already wreck havoc on our poor little jet and helpless mothership.

The enemies are one of the shining points of FA, easily my favorite.

[h2]Scoring system[/h2]
The scoring system in FA is easy to understand, with an incredibly high skill ceiling. At the end of the day, it’s all about controlling the flow.

Enemies come in waves that increase in both size and pace. Killing enemies adds to a combo that goes on forever, until you break it. 

Meanwhile, your jet also upgrades as you rack up the kills, the requirement for which increases with each upgrade level. The base jet is fragile but speedy, with a powerful and reliable dual cannon (bullets), followed by an extension giving you ramming abilities, more armor and replacing the bullets with homing missiles. Keep on killing, and you’ll get yourself a flying tank: slow, but resilient and powerful. Still not enough? Have yourself a big flashy laser and even more missiles! Of course, the tank doesn’t stay on forever. After soaking enough damage, your jet pops out of the tank wreckage, ranks up, gaining extra damage, and a bit of armor as well. With the current update, you can upgrade to a maximum level of level 5 (MK-V), and will no longer go past this level, greatly cutting down the time between upgrades. As a plus, now it’s much easier to get the laser turret on your tank, thanks to the increased armor every time you receive the tank upgrade.

As for the combo, well, imagine Luftrausers, but it goes way beyond 20. Destroy enemies to increase combo, damage enemy parts and projectiles (missiles and mines) to sustain it. Gotta keep it going, or you’re risking yourself with your leaderboard position, or maybe your hardware (uh oh). Sometimes it’s better to leave some jets around to fill the combo up in case the big guys are gone. One of the more frustrating parts of the game at first, you’ll easily find yourself chaining naturally once the familiarity settles in. It may take a while though!

Do note that the upgrades are all automatically applied, so keep an eye on the upgrade status so that your precious chain won’t be broken as you upgrade during which you can’t attack or move freely.

The leaderboard is what you’ll be looking at once you boot up the game. FA is built around this leaderboard that resets every 36 hours. A higher place gives more rank, experience points if you will. Occasionally you’ll run into super hardcore and talented players than get million scores like a walk in the park... don’t fret. You’ll get your chance.

Ultimately, the difficulty comes from mastering the scoring system itself: sustaining chains by taking apart enemies effectively, avoiding enemy fire, clever use of the tank, and quickly dealing with Carriers before it’s too late.

This might be the part that turned me off initially - it takes a lot of time to get used to the controls, and scoring. But it pays off. It feels good when it clicks. It’s such a simple concept with a hell lot of depth.


[h1]Graphics and sounds[/h1]
FA is no flashy triple A madness. It’s a simplistic game, both in graphics and sounds. But hey, it works really well!

Graphics wise, FA has that low-poly look, but with its own charm. It's very easy to tell what is dangerous and what isn't. The enemies are cool and varied in their designs, having details down to the rotating engines. The background seemed quite bland at first, but it doesn't outshine the foreground elements where the action takes place.

The UI is minimalistic but effective. To the point where sometimes there’s no UI at all. When things get busy though, you’ll see why it’s kept this way. Focus is the key.

The sounds - mmh, some hate it. I used to be with them, but it makes a lot of sense now that I’ve had way too much time with this game. Explosions don’t sound crispy enough, but your chain does. Gotta keep it going, told ya.

Music is short and catchy. For a game like this, the soundtrack sets you right in the mood for action while not grabbing much of your attention. If you wanna feel more epic, you’ll find a setting that does just that. Give it a try ;]


[h1]Overall enjoyment[/h1]
It’s funny. My initial impression with FA was not very positive. In fact, I hated it. Mainly because of the frustration when breaking a chain (makes you say the F word quite a lot). Or failing to predict the enemy positions. Or running straight into projectiles like an idiot.

Messing up in this game really frustrates me. But moments like pulling off a slick dodge, saving a chain, and taking apart Carriers swiftly, these are what makes the whole experience worth it. It really does feel rewarding, once you get to it. This game is a slow burn. Take your time, if you can’t do it now, try again later. Learn from the mistakes. Experience builds up. And hard work pays off! Now look at your run time... Does it look like a coffee break experience to you? *Cough*

FA is something you could spend as little as only a few minutes on every day, but keep coming back because it’s just so addictive, despite the frustration. At its core, it is after all an arcadey shmup. It’s definitely not for everyone, but give it a try! Maybe you’ll like it.

I’m proud to be part of the testers of the recent update - even after all these years, the developer is still actively improving the game. That is some serious dedication you won’t find even in some AAA titles. FA is a much different game now than it initially was a few years back. It has come a long way. Thanks Morfeo!

Furious Angels really shines after a few sessions, once you become comfortable with the core mechanics.

Your performance, beyond a personal sense of mastery, is recorded on a daily leaderboard. The leaderboard is reset frequently, and a fresh combination of enemy waves is available every few days. In short this is an extremely fun game, really easy to pick up but hard to master.

[h1]Great fun![/h1]

I've had this on my wishlist for a year or so and decided to pick it up in the Steam summer sale. I'm glad I did. This game is a blast. I love arcadey games, and have always had a soft spot for twin stick shooters. If you want some fast and easy fun, you won't go wrong picking this up.

So you are a fighter protecting your mothership from a variety of invading flying machines. After every so many kills your ship will upgrade itself (which looks really cool) and you'll have better firepower. It has a low poly, kinda geometric landscape which looks great but there is a lot of fine detail on the different ships. The camera is good, and it does some awesome close-ups at times when something cool happens. And don't forget online leaderboards!

I've gotta say as well, that this game has top notch production value. It's normally $5, and I've paid much more for games that don't look as good as this one. Everything in the game looks cool and ""clean"" from the fonts to the look of the leaderboards to the landscapes to the ships. If I ever made a game, I'd use the aesthetics of this one as my template.

I think most Games do not deserve, or need my opinion. 
And I usually don't feel well as an advertisement writer. 
But this one game is different. For me, this is a hidden Gem.

This is the only game i play everyday for 5-10 minutes. Since more then a Year. 
No other game got me hooked like this. I think I can say I like it a bit.
Maybe it is just a me-thing. Maybe it appeals just to my personal taste.

It is arcade-y, and in a way that makes it great ... I love the Explosions.
The graphics look simple. I like the minimalism. It makes it very clear and pure.
But it has a lot of depth. In the way you upgrade, your timings, how you fly.
And it is unforgiving. If you make mistakes you pay for them right away.
Yet it is so casual that you don't ever get angry. You just play another round.

The game gives every day a random Challenge, with different waves of enemies.
And there are daily leader-boards and Achievements.
Its addicting, but in a good way.

Jets.
Enjoy the Explosions.
Bombers - Rockets!
Circling - Find your Rhythm.
Scorpions.
Miners - Don't fail to Evade.
Raptor!
Kill the Carriers.
Impostor.
Upgrade your Ship.
Tank.
Lasers.
Repeat.
...
Fly fast and keep the Streak.
You will always die.
...
High Score.

I think many more people should play this hidden gem.
And its so cheap, you have no excuse not to.
Please play the game, and beat my score. 

Good Luck.

It's a Leaderboard game.

Honestly though...
How to describe this gem?
It's a twin-stick shooter.
You can't stop moving, but you can control where you move.
You die every 30 seconds to 5 minutes depending on skill and just plain bad luck.
You shoot incoming bad guys while flip-flopping around.
Trying to keep them from killing you and your defenseless carrier.

After so many kills you auto-upgrade into a better ship.
Get hit too many times in upgraded ships you get booted back down to lower level ships.
Get hit too often in lower level ships you die.
You can stop firing to ""heal"" but you can't stop firing because they're trying to kill you and your beloved carrier.

So again... git gud.",1561529108,1561821561,True,2,1,0.539328157901763916,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Furious Angels is a game developed and published by MorfeoDev

The game has some really beautiful environments and the graphics are really well designed and laid out. The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nontheless

The game also suffers with some weird bugs and glitches which the developer seemed to have overlooked but they don't hinder the game at all

Furious Angels overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a good adventure game to play especially if you like fast-paced action games such as this one!

[b][i]A rare thing to hear from me, but this is a buy full price game, screw waiting for Steam Sale. I'd say oneof  the holiest of compliments you could.[/i][/b]

A superb arcade game, this top view shooter provides incredibly satisfying gameplay. You are the last surviving fighter desperately protecting the only [i]Air Carrier[/i] left in your fleet. Your sessions are short and....[u]Furious[/u] as you carve your way through ever increasing waves of enemy. You will not survive the day, and neither will your score! Daily wipes of High Scores give a fighting chance to all of us to get into the top 100, a great gimic!

I had to look carefully to remind myself this was a 22mb download as the guys have used some very clever vector type graphics to immerse us in a very pretty little world that lights up with exploding mayhem rather quickly! On that note, this will run on pretty much anything, and still look great. The sound effects are meaty and the music is inspiring, perfectly executed.

Controls are simple, WASD + Mouse or use your controller (advise mouse though!) or even a combination works. You zip around using some classic circle strafing for most of the enemies and head on bashing as your ship upgrades through four stages from [i]Jet Fighter[/i] to [i]Flying Tank[/i]. Refraining from firing for a second allows your craft to auto heal and keep you in the fight, while it also reloads your missile banks if present. This provides incentive for tactical play at times as apose to mad arcade mayhem, a good balance!

All in all, your session never will last longer than 3-6 minutes. But using combo's and slightly different tactics each run makes this a very more-ish game and I can guarantee struggles to stop mashing the ""play again"" button. Every day, the leaderboard resets and the format of the enemy waves changes, providing endless challenges and if you suck today, tomorrow you might impress your peers and hit that top 100! Satisfying, fun, simple and addictive as all hell.

It killed me a little to hit the not recommend button (and it is a close call between the two) but at its price point, I think it has just a few too many flaws to be worth the money. 

[b]What flaws? (this is also the stuff I wish I'd known before buying): 

1) The game has a chronic lack of content. [/b]

[b]Enemies[/b]

There are 6 enemy types; the jet (a fast moving basic swarm enemy), the bomber (a slower more substantial missile enemy), the scorpion (basically a floating tank), the miner (which deploy fast homing mines (basically another, but bigger missile boat) and the imposer (which also happens to be your upgraded form). Oh and of course the enemy carriers which appear from time to time. 
I personally hate the reuse of player models for enemies so I'd consider there to be 5 enemy types, all of which you will encounter in the first 10 mins of play. 

[b]Maps[/b]

All the maps are essentially identical, a wide open space with a different colour, low poly floor. They actually look pretty good, apart from where there appears to be issues with the floor mesh so you can see through it :S

[b]Your upgrades[/b]

Your fighter has just 3 upgraded forms; one with missiles, a tank variant and a laser variant of the tank.Upgrade forms are lost when you die in either of the tank forms (returning you to the first form) and if you die in the first two forms you loose the game. 
There is no permanent progression. 

All in all after about an hour or so of play, the game can start to feel stale. 

[b]2) Lack of real support (support beyond bug fixes).[/b]

The patches in the last few months have added no real content to the game. In December two maps were added (which in all honestly isn't anything to write about). At the moment this game feels a little like a fire and forget in terms of content. 

[b]3) Cheaters[/b]

One of the appeals of the game is the fact everyone is ranked each day and then the boards are reset. A fun idea which has bought me back a couple of days in a row now. 
Unfortunately it seems either I'm fairly terrible at the game or the top few players (who all have a strangely low number of kills) are doing something a little dodgy. 

For example;today entry into the daily top ten came at around 9k points (which is pretty challenging to get) and then most people are clustered around the 9-12kmark. Then you have the top couple of players who are on 50/60k+ points (while only having a two hundred kills and only reaching the second jet weapon upgrade). Even if you chained practically every kill, it just doesn't seem feasable. 

I could be completely wrong, but that feels totally wrong. If these people are cheating (it seems there is a trainer/hack available on a Russian forum) then that really hurts one of the main appeals of this game. 

[b]Now though, it would be pretty unfair if I didn't say what I liked about the game[/b]

[b]1)[/b] The art style is simplistic but has a real charm with what it does. I know some people feel the maps are bland (and no doubt they are simple) but I think they are perfect for the style of the game. 
The designs of the enemy ships are nicely done, and differ from each other well. The design on the player ships is a little disappointing for me - there are so many potential cool designs for a futuristic fighter that didn't involve taking a modern looking jet and jamming a turret on the back :( (but hey that's my personal preference)! 

[b]2)[/b] Destruction of enemy ships and the physics of them falling to the earth is fantastic. For the Scorption, Miner, Impostor and Carrier you have to blast apart the engines/hard points to destroy the ship as a whole. This feels great, and watching the ship tumble out of the sky after you knock out engines is beautiful. 

[b]3)[/b] The game mechanics are also simple but well done and  there are a few little tricks you can use to improve your game (like the turret turns faster when you aren't boosting). 

This game has a kernel of something really fun at its core, and could be really great. It needs more of all the content [b](developer > apart from maps, don't waste time with more maps).[/b] Even just a handful more enemy ship and more of your own upgrade options (dare I wish for an upgrade tree where you choose your own upgrades?!) would really breathe a huge amount more life into this game. 
Unfortunately looking at recent patches, it seems real content is perhaps unlikely. I really hope I'm wrong and I'll be keeping an eye on this game just in case! For now though, it is a thumbs down.",1518260359,1518468751,False,5,0,0.567652225494384766,0,True,False,False,False,,1518290282.0,"Just a bit of clarification about the top players: you can make such high scores by (mostly) keeping the score combo alive.

It doesn't do anything [i]spectacularly[/i] original or amazing, but it takes what it is, boils it down, distills it, removes all the fluff and filler, and just focuses on that, and it does it well.

Fly your jet. Shoot other jets. Die. Repeat. 

There is no complex weapon upgrade tree, there's no XP system to progress from scrappy rust bucket to chromed war machine. There aren't procedurally generated enemies with ten thousand possible combinations. Just you, your jet (in its three forms), several enemies, and a boss type enemy. What makes it engaging is how you choose to prioritize and deal with them when your screen is full of enemies, without it resorting to full on frantic bullet hell. 

My biggest fault with the game is the audio. The sound effects lack a lot of oompf and feels more like you're popping bubblewrap than making things explode. And likewise the music feels anaemic and doesn't (IMHO) do a good job of getting you into the ""zone"".

So, have a look at the video above, and if that tickles your fancy, I'd recommend giving the game a go. Just don't expect a 60 hour deal with a fleshed out story, multiplayer lobbies, crafting systems and economies and sandboxes and and and.

just like luftrausers the objective is not to die, and the game will try it's damnest to do it. your vessel is made of paper, amd the game throws buckets of enemies on you. you rarely last more than five minutes each game session. also the control scheme is pretty much the same, and the basic gameplay - shoot everyone, don't get shot, stop shooting to recover health.

very different from luftrausers, however, is everything else. 

progression wise, instead of relying on unlockables external to the gameplay that tweak gameplay aspects, it's progression happens during each match. bad news is no progress is permanent, except your rank on the leaderboards. good news is that it gives an extra edge during each gameplay session - every upgrade a breath of air, making you grit your teeth until the next one kicks in.

the enemy scaling and distribution are different from luftrausers too - there it was more organic. in this game, enemies come in very defined waves. the game even informs the types of enemies and how many of each, which is nice, because there's a bit of strategy added to the gameplay with this information. but the game doesn't stop spawning waves until you finish the last - they stack if you're not quick enough, and you probably won't be.

one possible down side to this game is that there isn't a lot of content. it's a score chaser after all, you play it to get good at it and take a crack at the leaderboards.

graphics and sound wise it's ok. the game looks good, and it's music and sound are basic, but they do their job. nothing to write home about it, but not bad either.

So, I’ll elaborate on the one aspect that stuck out to me that’s different from other arcade shooters: The sound design. 

Originally, I didn’t enjoy the sound design. It just felt off for the only real effect to be the soft “pop” of your own gunfire when fighting upwards of twenty aircrafts. But, as I progressed further on repeat runs, I came to appreciate this single, solitary sound. Things may go wrong, multiple ships will fill the screen, tens of missiles will lockon to you, mines will hurtle past, the Mothership will be under attack, all the while you will always “pop, pop, pop…” at each enemy with brief pauses in between, as if you’re coming up for air. This effect is even better when you get to the third stage of your ship. You now have a powerful turret which creates a sound much like rain hitting an umbrella you’re standing under. It’s a very pleasing sound. 

To take this one step further, it’s important to remember what this game is: A score attack game with no end except for when you inevitably lose. And I find this inevitability is highlighted by the paired-down sound design. You don’t need deafening explosions and gunfire to warn you of danger because you already know there is danger. No matter how good of a pilot you are, no matter long you dodge missiles, you will lose. And that’s the beauty of Furious Angels and what makes it very easy to sink into, or out of, throughout the day.

I also feel pretty bad about this, because as a game it's alright: it runs, it's stable, it does what it says on the tin. But it's just not that fun.

The one gun on your ship feels anaemic and weak, and the first upgrade doesn't actually feel that noticeable in terms of your speed or the power of your weapon.

The second upgrade is the tank, which has its own problems as it's slow and it's huge so everything hits you, and by the time you've built up enough of a combo to trigger the tank upgrade there'll be a lot of enemies and projectiles to be hit by, so you don't get to enjoy the beefed-up firepower for very long. It also triggers automatically, so how useful you'll find it depends entirely on when it happens.

There's a laser upgrade I can't comment on as I've not managed to get up to that level yet, and I don't really feel compelled to try. Apart from the waves changing daily, that's all there is to the game. There are no other modes, nothing else to try out or to keep your interest after your first few rounds. It plays alright I guess, though momentum feels a little weird and it's nowhere near as responsive as it needs to be (certainly it controls nothing like Luftrausers).

Man steuert einen kleinen Kampfjet und muss sowohl am Leben bleiben als auch das große Trägerschiff von dem man gestartet ist verteidigen. Wenn man nicht schießt, regeneriert der Jet erlittene Schäden wieder weg. Nach bestimmten Abschusszahlen erhält man Upgrades. Dann schießt man zuerst zielsuchende Raketen (mit beschränkter Reichweite) von einem etwas größerern Jet und bei nochmaligem Upgrade verwandelt sich unser Jet in ein noch größeres und langsameres, dafür aber haltbarerers Kriegsschiff mit massiverer Feuerkraft. Diese dritte Upgradestufe ist dann auch eine Art Hülle, die wieder abgeworfen wird, wenn sie zu viel Schaden erleidet und dann hat man wieder den normalen Jet, womit das Upgradespiel von vorn los geht.

Es gibt nich besonders viele Gegnertypen, das macht aber nichts, weil sie so zahlreich auftreten, dass man eh nur wild rumballert und versucht selber nicht getroffen zu werden. Außerdem decken die vorhanden Typen alles nötige ab: schnelle Jets, weniger Schnelle Bomber mit Zielsuchraketen, langsame Tanks, sehr langsame und dafür fett gepanzerte  Zielsuchminenleger und Träger mit Großkanone gegen unseren Träger.

Einziges Manko (aus meiner Sicht natürlich) ist der Sound. Weder Waffen noch Explosionen klingen besonders wuchtig, was ich sehr schade finde. Und die Musik ist leider ziemlich unspektakulär angesichts der Action.

Fazit:
FA ist zwar nur ein kleine Spiel für Zwischendurch (pro Runde ca. 2-5 Minuten, mit Skill natürlich auch länger möglich). Es macht Gaudi und entwickelt durch seinen fordernden Schwierigkeitsgrad eine ähnliche Nur-noch-eine-Runde-Suchtwirkung wie beispielsweise Devil Daggers.

是一款画风简洁的飞行射击游戏
与其说是飞行射击其实就是移动射击
游戏内容介绍下面的朋友说的已经够多了
没什么好补充的==

游戏的整体操作非常简单
WASD移动 左键射击 右键喷气
停止开火可以自动维修机体
玩家可以攻击指定数量的敌机进行短暂升级
初始等级：发射机炮
第二等级：带有小幅度追踪效果的导弹
第三等级：空中坦克发射密集的机炮弹幕
第四等级：强力的激光+大量导弹
但空中坦克模式
侧面装甲损坏了并不能维修==

游戏本体的意义应该是保护地图中间的飞船
并击毁前来攻击的敌机来比拼分数
然而如楼下所说
每四波左右会刷出一艘空母来攻击你要保护的飞船
每次数量会+1
就是说第二次刷新空母的数量为二（以此类推）
一般情况下 
挺不过第3波空母的进攻
因为它们是无视玩家直接攻击飞船的

关于成就
这游戏基本都是堆叠式的成就
动辄击落一万敌机才能完成
而且最令人发指的成就
要数在排行榜前十名待上几天→.→
反正到现在我也没能达成全成就

优点：
+画风清新
+操作简单

缺点：
-缺少BGM
-模式单一
-内容枯燥
-无法离线运行
-强制结束游戏

Ну что же, все ачивки получены, кайф доставлен. Перед вами маленькая, но очень интересная игра, которую не стыдно иметь в своей библиотеке. Furious Angels - это бесконечный шутер с летающими танками, лидербордом, разнообразием волн каждый день и апгрейдами. Попо дробней)

• [b] Геймплей. [/b] Доска почета сбрасывается  на следующий день. Ваш ранг в общей таблице обновляется, волны меняются, каждый день волна будет содержать разных противников.  Вы взлетаете с «матери» маленькой мухой и в поте лица начинаете оборонять свой авианосец. На вас прут бомбардировщики, мелкие и быстрые истребители, толстые минеры, точные Скорпионы и истребители «Раптор» похожие на модель вашего кораблика. По мере отбивания волн, наша «Муха» апгрейдиться, что дает нам боле толстые типы кораблей и мощней вооружение. Вершиной апгрейда является космический танк стреляющий ракетами и лазерами. 

Убили? Игра закончилась, жмем рестарт. Если вы смогли проапргейдиться до уровня танка, при достижении минимального количества ХП, вы не умрете, а катапультируетесь на мухе v 2.0 и так далее. Версия кораблика дает вам больше урона с пушек. Управлять корабликом можно даже одной рукой. Но, я по привычке использовал WASD и мышь. С каждой волной врагов становиться всё больше и больше. Спустя минут 10 игры, это всё начинает напоминать Crimsonland.  Спасает то, что если вы получили «маслину», желательно убрать палец с кнопки «Огонь», за несколько секунд, корабль отхилится. Отлетели далеко от «Мамы»? Прилетают 2-3 вражеских «Папы» и устраивают фильм «Отцы жарят мать во все дырки. Без регистрации и смс». Апгрейды, точность, дистанция, реакция… всё это потребуется для того чтобы попасть в топы.  Но, чаще всего в топах сидят люди, которые накручивают себе очки с помощью Artmoney и это печально. Обязательно обращайте внимание на ранг и количество сбитых врагов. Тогда будет понятно…  действительно ли человек старался, чтобы туда попасть или же юзнул прогу.

• [b] Звук. [/b]Ничего особенного. 2-3 трека, взрывы и тра-та-та-та.

• [b] Графика. [/b] Именно из-за скриншотов, я решил попробовать эту игру. Сделана на Unity красиво и минималистично. Долго не мог вспомнить, где я е уже видел эти острые углы и яркую палитру. Оу «Firewatch»… вот куда судьба завела Генри, всё из-за женщины. 

• [b] Ачивки. [/b] Веселые, не тяжелые, за исключением 3-х. 
- Достигнуть 2-го аргейда корабля, с точностью 50%, 100 раз 
- Убить 10000 истребителей
- Завершить день на первой позиции топа. Мне повезло, потому что чувак походу не смог поиграть и не юзал Artmoney.

I want so badly for this game to be worth my time. It's a gorgeous, it has a unique feel, and it's doing some interesting things. If it weren't for a few key issues, I would easily spend $20-$30 for something like this.

The first time I played this game, I returned it. But I provided some feedback to the devs. I've now given it a second chance because after reading some of the updates, it looked like maybe they fixed some of these issues. But now I see that the fixes were really minor. There are core, fundamental things about this game that just make it an aggravating, impossible, and unsatisfying experience. The cool or potentially cool things about this game are constantly undermining each other.


FUN.

As a player, you can't appreciate the action of an action game and the results of your efforts if you never get to see or hear your enemies explode. This is an action game, right? Then why are most of the enemies always off-screen and I never even get to see or even HEAR them explode? All I get is a meaningless number that pops up next to my cursor too fast to comprehend, with no context whatsoever, and it isn't supported by any on-screen HUD or helpful information of any kind. And as a bonus, these enemies are shooting at me with homing missiles that I also can't see or hear, and by the time I do see them, my ship is too slow or set in it's momentum to do anything about it if they happen to be on the perfect f***ing trajectory. And, honestly, enemies have homing missiles within the first 30-60 seconds of the game is ridiculous. Why would I play a game where I know I'm very likely going to die within the first minute and a half no matter how good I get at it?

All the foundational principles of what makes video games FUN (faster gratificaion/achievements than in real life, savoring the details and results of your actions, watching your personal skill get better, escapism by immersing yourself into a different reality) have been completely shot in this game.

IMMERSION.

A good video game, like any good movie or book, allows you to escape your reality and enjoy a different one for a while, where achievements come a little faster, and you get a little more satisfaction for your work. But with this game, you know the entire time that you're playing a video game. You never get to suspend disblief long enough to have real fun. 

The first reason is because you can't see anything the whole time. You're attention is constantly going to the edges of the screen.

The second reason is that even if that blindness mechanic was intentional, you can't stay alive long enough to appreciate it somehow. You're constantly trying to hear if you happened to hit an enemy ship or maybe get lucky enough to hear an enemy ship fire a weapon; but instead you hear the music because those sound effects are so faint. And some of those songs have beats that sound confusingly similar to the in-game sound effects.



This game is constantly shooting itself in the foot. 

Because a shmup where the sound was more important that the visuals might actually be pretty interesting. But then they choose songs that make that muddle the sound effects. The songs are really cool and moody and interesting, but they're in the way. 

This game has gorgeous visuals, but you never get to see the ships. 

The visuals and the music in the beginning establish this slow, intentional mood and pacing, and then the ship has to do these banks and slower more intential maneuvers which add to that. But then the game punishes you for getting into that mood by cutting your visual, hiding information, making the sound effects too quiet to hear, adn throwing enemies at you that are better than you in every way.

I could go on and on and on. This game has a lot of potential and some interesting ideas, but it feels like there was no one clear vision for why all of these things are designed like this. So instead it's just this disjointed thing whose individually creative parts just get in each other's way and ruin the overall experience.

The value I got out of this is more of a luck-based soundtrack than a skill-based shooter.

I would love to be able to recommend it, but I just can't.

其次这游戏是用Unity引擎制作，2.5D（3D游戏+平面视角），安装包只有区区15MB，但内容不少，和破解组的压缩技术有得一拼。看容量你也知道了，游戏的内容简单粗暴，连教程和提示都没有。一进游戏就提示赶紧动动方向键开搞，后面就是就是射射射，射出你的激情……

游戏画面还行，有碰撞体积，有物理效果，而音乐方面则低调到几乎不存在。

游戏支持键鼠和手柄，键盘和鼠标操作方法不用说你也知道，无非就是方向键移动，鼠标锁定目标。
如果玩家想开打就按下前进键，然后小飞机会从航母起飞。WASD控制飞行方向，鼠标左键射击，右键喷射加速。游戏一开始敌人就会不停的刷，虽然有波次，但是程序可不管玩家有没有完全消灭掉那一波，时间一到下一波就来，动作慢一点敌人就越打越多。既然敌人那么能刷，玩家当然也能回血，只要不攻击机体就开始自行维修（回血）。游戏中玩家可以借助杀敌升级，如果玩家的飞机离自己的航母过远，敌方就会刷出一艘航母来暴打玩家的航母，玩家的航母一爆游戏也会结束。话说那敌方航母，不管你有没有出范围，后面都会刷一大堆，然后你的航母被打中之后还不会回血，真是强制结束游戏的节奏。
游戏中玩家可以借助杀敌来升级，一开始是小飞机，然后是稍大一点火力更强的轰炸机，再然后是行动缓慢体积庞大、可以和敌方舰船撞个稀巴烂的空中坦克，如果你运气好在坦克阶段刷够了人头，上面的炮会变成激光的。但是坦克一爆又会回到小飞机，只不过武器威力有所提升（Mk3小飞机的火力大概是Mk1坦克的水平），就这样循环往复。死了以后一切清零……

喵的别看宣传片那么屌爆，这游戏玩起来的感觉就和《几何战争》一样，不过容易一些。
首先这游戏最适合早泄型——反应极快的——玩家，如果你的反射弧不是那么发达，望还是酌情考虑一下。像我这种用脑子多过用反应的，玩这游戏也就勉强应付，被迫集中注意力和提升反应，玩起来一点不休闲，如果反应力不是维持在让我有点痛苦高水平最多就能杀入等级的第二阶段（Mk2）初期，1400分。如果你想玩得好就要不断练习，但是游戏内容很重复很乏味，我不是很推介。不过你要精通其实也不难，无非就是绕着目标打转，朝着你画出来的圆心一通乱射。
不管你玩得如何，我认为游戏大概会在5000-10000分之间结束，因为那时候就算你不死，你的航母也完蛋了。（我的最高记录是7245.44，所以你也别说我是玩不来才投反对的。）
话说了这游戏还要手眼协同，如果是手残型玩家和易眩晕群体还是尽早退散。不然控制的飞机和目标在那里甩呀甩、转呀转，肯定会受不了的。
我觉得这钱花在《掠食之翼》上还划得来。

如果是过关制的，难度循序渐进，玩家的飞机又能慢慢升级，我觉得这样设计应该还行。但是这游戏又无故事又无关卡，难度没得选，上来就是挑战模式和线上积分比拼……你当我吃这一套？史丹利你这混蛋，我还没蠢到吃这一套，刷刷刷很烦的。
这游戏偶尔拿来玩玩还可以，但如果你玩不好，那就会经常干重复活，游戏很容易乏味。

评分：6/10，牛逼哄哄的宣传片，勉勉强强的游戏。主要这游戏因为是小团队制作，已经改动无望了，提了意见没人回复，也只能摊手了。当然这在传统射击类游戏中算不错的，如果你喜欢这种类型，值得一玩，反正可以退款，只要别玩过头；）

Furious Angels adds another tally mark to that list.  However, while it doesn't take the genre or the core mechanics very far in any new direction, what it does add makes for a game that feels distinctly different from the thick soup of clunky similar games.

[h1]Furious Angles: Explodyo Drift[/h1]

The first thing I noticed after starting up the game, outside of the fact that you're thrown pretty much immediately in to the action, is that the flight mechanics force you to manage your movement with a lot of drift and curve compensation.  Rather than working on a principle of precision control like other twin-sticks, accelerating will create momentum in the corresponding direction, so if you attempt to turn, you won't immediately go that way, but rather make an arching curve dependent on your speed.  While you don't need to be worried about smashing in to the sides of the level like Geometry Wars, you do still need to be able to adjust to avoid the massive amount of enemy fire.  This comes in to play more as you encounter enemies with more damaging and precise weapons, as often a hit or two will be all it takes to bring your run to an abrupt end.  What this mainly did is make the game look much more fluid and play in a way that requires a bit more skill in maneuvering and dodging.  

Furious Angels seems as though it was designed with a goal of minimalism beyond all else.  From the very start you're given a menu that exists as text integrated into the game space at an angle, originally aligning itself with the carrier you take off from.  You can even effectively play the game using only a mouse.  There's also little in the way of a UI anywhere on the screen during gameplay.  Score gain floats away from destroyed enemies, upgrade countdowns and other pertinent information floats around your ship.  Even your ship health is a mystery as it is only indicated by some flashing that is incredibly easy to miss in the fast pace and explosive gameplay.  This certainly adds to the unique properties of the game, there are places that it is definitely missed. 

[h1]What might have been...[/h1]

While I am a fan of indie arcade games, and I find this game mechanically sound, it's hard to keep playing it solely to climb up the scoreboard.  Especially with how frustrating the upgrade system can be, given that each new upgrade slows you down in the process of giving you more armor and armament, meaning eventually you're just cannon fodder.  Yet, it seems like a game as well crafted as this is mechanically would have more overall content.  Something like permanent upgrades for your ship, or some sort of consumable.   Maybe cosmetic unlocks like new backgrounds, a night mode, skins, special game modes, or even just some variation in the order and components of each wave.  A game that has a gameplay loop that can still manage to keep me challenged and entertained even without the prospect of unlocks or rewards is impressive on its own, but with good additions that include things like that, it would be one I'd have a hard time putting down.  It's clear with the description of the game and the  current design that the developer has no intention of taking the game in this direction – it is as arcade as arcade can be.

[h1]Livid Cherub[/h1]

Furious Angels joins the elite club of games I can jump in and play for 10 or 15 minutes at a time and feel satisfied having done so.  It may not always be as fun as I wanted, and there's a really high chance I'll die to a random hit when I assumed I had more health than I did, but the simplicity really makes it addicting.  When you couple that with a reasonable price (easily under $5 on sale), Furious Angels earns a recommendation.  It's just one of those games that looks nice
 in a video and then you play it and understand why it manages to look fluid and action packed in every snippet.

Developer responds quickly and there is a beta that allows for some screen fill options for larger displays. Got the game running at 4k now, buttery smooth. The game has some interesting mecanics and the way lives work, sort of feels like a shooter mixed with asteroids. It's actually quite fun, I just wish there were upgradable weapons, loadouts, etc. For that it has, basically you can upgrade into a slightly tougher ship that seems to do a bit more damage, and eventually a slow moving tank. You basically get ONE shot type, and some missles. That's it. I've seen games like Dragonia (porn twin stick game that noone should play) with tons of awesome meta, but really bad overall. If this game had that, it would be beautiful.

That's about it. If you stop firing for a second you get a missile barrage that you can let off making timed shots nice, but playing with the game pad makes accuracy a pain to get on the results. Overall I can reccomend the game as what it is, a fun time waster that has a developer that is looking to make a sequel. I'd hope to see some new mechanics added as load outs, weapon switch (multidimentional array, global settings, pretty simple stuff) just needs weapon effects, some already present such as a laser from the mother ships. Really would do well with some rpg or rouge lite mechanics, make this game so much more addicting. 

Also if you blow up in the first two modes (normal ship and heavier ship) you loose. If you blow up in tank you revert back to the speedy little ship to attempt to gain your tank all over. Sort of makes it hectic as you have tough enemies, so has some value. I don't know if the developer plans on doing anything to this game as comments of fancy stuff are waiting for a sequel, rather than improve upon the base to gain an audience to gain a sequel. 

Giving a thumbs up to help the ratings. Simple and fun but barebones. I want to see this game get bigger and add those rpg/rouge like mechanics. The gameplay would do well with it and make it so much better, so buy it so we can get a real full fledged game.

There's a lack of meta game or anything, but its price is right. It's really fun to drop in for a few minutes.

There's another key here. There's a variety to the gameplay in the form of upgrades, and temporary ""flying tank"" bonus sections. The game you're playing from one minute to the next can be quite different, and each variation on your fighter feels different, too.

I really like the enmy design, graphical style, and especially the destruction mechanics on the larger ships. It feels great to blast off the engines on an enemy carrier and watch it topple. That's not to say it's easy. You still have to get to that side of your targeted enemy, which is sometimes impossible to do without dying, so you flee instead.

The game is hard, and one criticism is it basically devolves into circle strafting large groups of enemies eventually, but what game doesn't, frankly?

This game is very simple and that is good in some parts and hurts the game in others. The game resets the leader-boards every day which is an interesting take on a ranking system. The mouse-only control scheme is also pretty interesting and feels great (with the exception of poorly timed upgrades that can send you flying away from where you intended to be). The game has a minimalist UI (to the point of it not being there, really) The problems come with playing the game for too long. There are only seven different enemies, which means the randomized waves every day feature is barely noticeable. You often die because of something randomly firing from off screen and hitting you twice (miners are the most annoying). You'er weak and have no real way of telling how close to death you are (no health bar, your ship flashes when damaged, that's all). Bigger enemies can only be hit on weak spots, which makes sense, but everything that isn't a weak point blocks your shots from hitting other place on enemies (you can't even shoot through destroyed weak spots). There are only two upgrades, one adds missiles that work on a cool-down that you have no indication of (which is annoying because you have to stop shooting and start again to launch them), and the other turns you into a tank. The tank feels nice, it is slow and powerful and can ram a lot of enemies to death, but if it takes too much damage you become even slower and lose the ability to ram anything, wasting some of your time flying slowly waiting to lose the powerup. Then you star back from your base ship. Some achievements are either a grind or require you to be the best at this game, (looking at kill 10,000 jets, play for 10 days, and finish the day at rank #1) which is only really an issue if you are an achievement hunter.

===

[h1] Overview [/h1]

Furious Angels is a top-down 2.5D classic shooter, with strongly competitive-oriented and skill-based gameplay. In this title, the player will be the only pilot left defending his carrier command ship against various hordes of enemies. Luckily, the carrier will give out upgrades every set number of enemies killed, to better fight off the onslaught. The objective, aside from staying alive and protecting the ship, is mostly scoring high combos to get a better position in the daily-resetting leaderboards, to compete with other pilots all over the world.

===

[h1] Gameplay Analysis [/h1]


[b] General Gameplay [/b]
The gameplay of Furious Angels uses a simple but well made and effective formula. There are just two goals, first is staying alive, and the second is to defend the carrier. While you are at it, make as many points as possible, so when you inevitably are overrun by enemies, your legend won't be forgotten! 

[b] Combat System [/b]
Combat system is based upon skill and reflexes mostly, you will have to improve after every run and understand the various attack patterns of enemies, to then calculate a good flight trajectory that will enable you to hit while dodging enemy bullets. Since the flight model is inertial, there is no quick turns and shooting, you will have to be more careful than normal or you will end up being a sitting duck and get blasted by a million of shots. There are two upgrades gained by killing enemies at regular intervals, first is Guided Missiles, which you can fire after a few seconds after you stop shooting your gun, and the second upgrade is Heavy Armor, which basically transforms your jet into a flying tank, until you get hit too much, then back to square one, basic jet. Also note that your ship can withstand a few bullet hits and will auto-repair in a short time, but to enable this you will have to hold fire while repairing.

There are resetting leaderboards and new enemy waves each day, a lot of achievements to pursue, though if we speak of content quantity there is not very much to be honest, enemy types are not many just 6 or 7, 2 upgrade types, no progression whatsoever, no other game modes. This game has not been developed with content in mind but with just one thing to do: compete in the global leaderboards, and in that it does pretty well. The main content is, definitely, the competition itself and the skill improvement you get after every run.

[b] Balancing [/b]
The game is fairly balanced, enemies are quite strong but again, skill will matter more than everything in this kind of game, i'd say the learning curve is not too steep, first times you will die after little time but then you will improve. There is nothing too op or too much nerfed, it is well done in this part.

[b] Challenge [/b]
This game is very challenging, both because of the leaderboards and because of the ever increasing difficulty and number of enemies. I'd rate the challenge of this game at High.

===

[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]


[b] Graphics [/b]
Graphics style is quite simple and by no means high poly, but it compensates with some quite cool destruction effects, is quite polished and has good details on models of enemies and allied crafts. Too bad the background is quite low res, and also the wrecks of enemy fallen ships do fall on the ground but disappear after some time... would be more enjoyable with all those wrecks around to testify your defiance, but again i suppose it is for performance reasons.

[b] Sound [/b]
Sound effects are alright, average, some additional soundtracks would have been nice, overall decent.

[b] Performance [/b]
Smooth, well done, not many elements on screen anyway, should run well on even low spec systems.

[b] Stability [/b]
Nothing to report.

[b] AI [/b]
Enemy AI as you would expect is a basic point and shoot AI, nothing elaborate, but does the job.

[b] Quality of Life [/b]
Not Applicable.

[b] Bugs / Issues [/b]
Nothing to report.


[h1] Conclusions [/h1]

Furious angels is a game i suggest purchasing to anyone who likes competing in leaderboards and such things, but also to classic shooter enthusiasts. It is an above average game for its kind nowadays, you won't be disappointed.

Lati positivi:

-Grafica essenziale ma orginale e fluida 
-IA nemici  adeguata
-Controlli immediati e reattivi al punto giusto
-puo' diventare una droga puntando al miglioramento continuo dei tempi

Consigli per aggiunte e 701941 miglioramenti:

- Imho, la palette colori con sfondo rosso/arancio puo' dare fastifdio dopo un po' o  stancare e affaticare la vista. Sarebbe bello poter scegliere anche i colori invertiti (fondale  verde o azzurro e nemici con  colori caldi come il rosso, arancione ecc)

-Dopo il primo potenziamento dell'astronave, se si viene pesantemente danneggiati si muore subito, anziche ritornare nella forma base iniziale. Dare la possibilita' di poter sopravvivere qualche minuto in piu', non credo dia fastifdio, anche perche' con l'astronave in forma base e nemici sempre  piu' numerosi ed  avanzati, la difficolta'  aumenta sempre e comunque e potrebbe diventare piu' interessante lo scontro in queste condizioni). Magari inserire questa possibilita' in una  modalita Facile.

-sarebbe bello (ed anche spettacolare), attivare contromisure (flare o scudi energetici) per deviare i missili a ricerca dei nemici (non i laser, sia chiaro), magari con ricarica/rigenerazione lenta delle stesse. Si potrebbero attivare le contromisure con il tasto centrale del mouse

-sarebbe gradita la possibilita' di aggiungere armi diverse come  laser multidirezionali, mine esplosive, (come fa LUFTRAUSERS ad esempio) .

  
In ogni modo, anche cosi' come', risulta un buon gioco.

Update: The devs have added some great new music tracks and tweaked the controls to make the game play even better. The more I play, the more of the little details I notice. I love the way impacts cause your aircraft to rock and change course, and its neat watching the enemy craft you destroy slowly crash into the terrain below you and come to rest on the ground.

I was wondering at the begining if it would have enough depth, and now after a few days of play I can now confirm it has.
Furious Angels has joined Enter the Gungeon and Downwell as my go to short and intense dayly runs games.

Congrats to the developpement team, classy game!

In more detail, these are the reasons I love this game:

1 Minimalist elegant game design. A handful of layered mechanics combine to give you constant interesting tactical choices while being fully concentrated on surviving the increasingly overwhelming enemy onslaught.

2 Short runs. Managing a run of more than 5 minutes is hard, 10 minutes is probably impossible or very rare. This means I can use it as a short stress relief and that I can stop playing anytime if something comes up. This is a big advantage when you have a family ;)

3 Excellent physics based ""flight"" model where each of the 3 ship upgrades handle differently. Intuitive and at the same time hard to master. 

4 Great game engine. The quality of the physics-based collisions and destruction and the quality of the graphics is much higher that what you usually find in a simple arcade game like this one. (actually, It seems the engine was initially aimed at a much more complex RTS game)

Bad:
The sound and music are bad, they take more away than they add and start out very quiet and you need to turn the volume up
Not enough audio or visual queues on when I'm getting hit, how much life I have and so on. I feel making it later in the game has more to do with luck than skill because I just don't know what is going on. I think this could be solved by having good audio queues and keeping the game looking simple.

Here upgrades are not simply more of the same but require different play styles (a tank crashes everything), each of the two  has it's own strengths and weaknesses, which means you have to prioritize targets differently.

Since the game also currently lacks any deeper tutorial I highly recommend reading the somewhat official guide here:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=877545455

The enemy spawn order slightly changes daily, so it's worth revisiting.

If you're somewhat competitive and use a mouse the game is well worth it's money since you will be stuck in the short game loop (normally way less than 5 minutes) for way longer than planned, since mastering the deadly enemy waves is quite rewarding.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Furious Angels is a sci-fi arcade shooter focused on score attack mechanics. You try to kill enemy aircraft as it attacks you and your carrier. The concept might be simple enough, but the it’s the execution that gets the prize.
Even if you are not a competitive person – you’ll feel that way because game shows leaderboard and your position in it before every launch. That’s a great design that tries to push “competitive” philosophy to every player. “Go ahead, look how far you can go if you try to survive just a little bit longer!”
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
-	Great graphics, the game has its own style: not high-poly, but not minimalistic either. The landscape does not have a lot of detail, but the enemies and your own ships do.
-	Good, minimalistic UI
-	Skill based
-	Fun, action-packed gameplay. I mean it.
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-	After a while, the game will get repetitive: you always get the same plane and same equipment at the start
-	The controls could be better: the game requires good precision, but it’s really hard to have precise angles on controller. The mouse is OK (I had 35% accuracy with mouse compared to usual 17-18% with controller). Forget about playing with keyboard. Maybe I’m unskilled, but turning the plane on keyboard has really been painful.
-	Music does not fit the game. It’s not bad, it’s just somewhat relaxing and does not put you in “go get em, instant action!” mood.
-	The price is a bit steep for the content offered: if you think about it, the game has less than 10 types of enemies and 3 player upgrades in total.

The game is really fun but it does not have that much content; I think definitely buy it once it’s on 50% discount, but for the current price it seems a bit too expensive to me.",1488391819,1488392393,True,3,0,0.485677987337112427,0,False,True,False,False,,,

Es geht darum Highsores zu schaffen. Das Schiff wird während dem Spielen automatisch nach Kills bis zur Stufe 3 ausgebaut. Bei Stufe 3 hat man dann das größte und stärkste Schiff, allerdings sind Treffer unausweichlich und nachdem es zerstört wird, fängt man wieder bei Stufe 1 an.
Stufe 1 und 2 reparieren sich selbstständig, wenn man nicht feuert.
Es tauchen mit der Zeit ganz große Feindschiffe auf, die so schnell wie möglich zerstört werden müssen, damit das eigene Mutterschiff nicht angegriffen und zerstört wird.
Wenn man sich zu weit vom eigenen Mutterschiff entfernt, tauchen diese großen Feindschiffe sofort auf und man hat kaum eine Chance, das Mutterschiff zu retten. Also sollte man sich nie zu weit entferen.

Ich hoffe, das Spiel wird noch weiterentwickelt. Ein individuelles Upgrade-System würde mir sehr gefallen.

The game sets itself apart in a crowded genre with game mechanics that differ from many 2D shooters. The game's controls are very simple, but they belie the depth of gameplay.

Your vehicle flies like a jet, meaning there is no instant direction change, no hovering, and no sideways strafing. As you gain upgrades, your vehicle increases in power and eventually becomes a turretted flying tank.

Like the other said, sfx are a bit weak and the music is 'meh' at best. I'm not sure I fully understand the point system, it either needs some work or some clarification.

Set on a rocky planet, you fight increasingly harder and more numerous waves of enemies, which randomizes each day, to defend the mothership and to score points. When you destroy, you unlock upgrades like a space tank. 

The gameplay is solid. I thought the keyboard controls were stiff but using your mouse works great though it takes some practice to get the hang of it, which is how it should be! The grafix are simple, but appealing. The distinct shapes and colours of the enemy ships make them easy to identify, though I do not know if I have encountered all of the enemies yet as the game gets pretty gosh darn hard quite early on! The ship physics and destruction are other little great things that add to my enjoyment. Big ships will break apart as they get destroyed and will crash into eachother and the environment below. Better yet, crashing your ship into other ships can destroy them!

The biggest issues with the game is the music and the sound effects. The music does not match with the intense dogfighting that is going on and is somewhat out of place. As another reviewer put it, it does not have the energy that would be suitable for this kind of sci-fi action. Same goes for the sound effects; the massive battles are not accompanied with sounds fitting the explosions and lazers. That is something I hope the developer will improve in the near future. There seems to be room for further expansions to the game, which would probably be pretty nice.

Other than that, great little game. Worth the cash? Sure.",1488215528,1488218583,True,13,0,0.656382441520690918,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Beginning as a straightforward blastathon, the ""upgrade"" system gradually introduces new mechanics such as holding your fire to be able to launch missiles and repair yourself, eventually culminating in becoming a ""tank in the sky"" to rack up enormous scores. You can play with keyboard, mouse or gamepad; for once, I actually preferred the mouse controls to gamepad, since this isn't really a ""twin stick"" shooter as such.

The music and sound effects are a bit weak -- the music in particular has a very ""'90s MIDI"" feel to it and doesn't really have the ""energy"" about it that a game of this type deserves -- but the stylised graphics fit the game well and the way everything explodes into pieces is enormously satisfying.

It'd be nice to see some better music -- or just a bit more variety to it, since there seems to only be one track at present -- in a future update, but for now, this is a solid and enormously addictive shoot 'em up that is a great addition to any score attack junkie's library.",1488202838,1488202838,True,20,0,0.696644783020019531,0,True,False,False,False,,,
