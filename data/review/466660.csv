I just wanted to learn how to do the basics, like fight, loot, and gather. Ended up spending all of my in game $$ on tools for gathering. Fought a bit. I thought that all seemed reasonable, or a reasonable way to do it.

Looked up a Youtube to figure out how to do more.

Accepted all the tasks. Clicked on some different skills, switched between them to try some things. Then felt like I was at a stopping point. 

Because I wanted to figure out how to do the first task, poaching fish, but that requires cooking... so, a stove (?) But I can't get a stove or eggs because I have no in game $. 

Also my inventory is full, my shop is full, my boo-chest is upgraded 1x and I don't know what to do with most of what I have. Am I supposed to trash 75% of it and fight more?   

I love the gameplay itself, the style, the concepts, but already it just feels odd, and I've felt a bit lost the whole time.  The biggest complaint I've read is about there not being many people on there, so maybe the game would run a ton more smoothly if there were more people, because we could share stuff? Trade? Sell? 

The theme seems to be that people can help each other fight, and can exchange/sell each other goods and join guilds together. But, all of those things seem to have huge roadblocks.

I think that conceptually it would be cool to see other's boo's, friends, guildmembers, or anyone's? I feel like that is part of the game but on empty servers I don't really know.

******I'd definitely recommend putting everyone on the same server if there's a lack of people in the game, and reducing anything limiting the use of merchant areas, guilds, newspaper ads, just to liven the place up and get stashes moving.*******

 I mean it's called stash, not trash, and I know all I'm going to be doing if I go back on is tossing almost everything with very little understanding of what I'm throwing out. And since I'm kinda not going to want to do that, I'll be hard pressed to play more. 

It's like you really need certain items, but have no idea how to actually get them(?) I guess the gist is to toss everything else out and keep fighting to open chests. Which I know is an aspect, but I don't feel like that was the original intent (?) With the main intent being helping one another and having player shops? Maybe I'm wrong. 
What do I know,  I can't even boil an egg *shrug*

P.S. Yes, I did find the help screen, and the wiki, and some youtubes. And yes, I thought I was doing well learning how to get around and fight and gather, but maybe throw newbs a bone and put an optional tutorial with a few simple beginning tasks and achievements like to learn in an interactive style how to learn a skill, make a recipe, utilize the different parts of your boo and HUD. Just so some of us don't feel so lost.

Do I recommend this game? Well, I'm going to say yes, because the main complaint is that there just aren't enough people on it, and it hasn't made me mad... just kind of stuck me lost at what feels like a stopping point very quickly. So, if people are cool with that, let um come in! I hope that they take the advice of making the interactive things easier to use: Like the guild and different shops and a bit more interactive tutorial just to let people feel like they are getting somewhere, doing something, and partaking in a shared game.

Update: Invited a friend in, to try to play together, thinking that fighting monsters with him would be fun, however nope. We couldn't enter into any fighting or harvesting areas together.

Just take everything I say here with a grain of salt lol)[/b]

I don't think I've seen a more chaotic playerbase trend than with [i]Stash[/i] (might be an exaggeration but whatevs). Ever since it released, the player count for this game didn't break triple digits all that often. Rewind to a little over a year ago though, and all of a sudden this game has over 8k players in it [i](keep in mind that this hasn't been updated since 2018)[/i]. After that it dips back to just above 500 before going to 10k just two weeks after the dip. The highest count recorded is 32,094 people on March 17 2022. As of this review's posting, the count is 23,171.

Before anyone starts thinking ""oh someone's probably botting this thing,"" I say two things in response:

[list]
   [*]I don't know why anyone would even bother botting a pretty much dead game in the first place.
   [*]The player count over the hours is a bit rigid for it to be botting in my opinion.
[/list]

The current player count has stayed like single digits around 23,171 for hours now. If it were bots, then I would think that count would drop en masse as they go down for a period of time - also it would be a bit confusing that bots would only come up every so often instead of being persistent.

I just thought I'd write this ""review"" cause it seemed a bit odd to me that a game that's been effectively neglected all of a sudden has like 20k people playing it lol. (Also I'm writing this at like midnight and my eyes are quickly wanting to seal themselves shut so maybe I got sidetracked? Idk though lol)

But meh, what do I know - I'm just some random guy on the webs of the internet just saying what comes to mind :P

Since I'm cleaning up my gargantuan Steam library, I stumbled upon Stash. I fuzzily remember my times in Stash, but for example I do remember that at some time I could get qualified for being a helper. Won't write down the name, as I got stalked by very weird players back then.

After trying to remember what happened and why I stopped playing, I remembered. Fuzzy stuff in their Discord and horrible stuff outside, which I mentioned: stalking.
Anyhow, the game in the meanwhile got less and less interesting to play. Why? Because no feedback was actually being followed. Frogdice apparently moved on from this dumpster on fire that ONCE was a promising game.

Should you play this? As an avid player of abandonware and old games, even I can't suggest anything positive about this game. I think at some point this game had a POINT, but it got lost very quickly and whoever is behind the development is highly temperamental. I do remember a lot of discussions about this particular aspect.

Turn based MMOs are still interesting, so try some other. This one has literally NOTHING to offer, outside from maybe, one day, someone who will get this bag of lost hope up and maybe relaunch the game with bugs fixed and a decent state of mind.

Game is dead.  No one else was online.  Despite this, movement on world map was quite laggy.  Combat is not balanced around a single player experience, so lack of population really hurts this.

Concept as a whole seems decent.  Would like to see more Turn-based combat in MMOs.  Crafting system might be nice if there were other players.

Non so perché la community si sia persa per strada, ma sembra un gioco deserto, lasciato a se stesso, non so neanche se c'è dello staff attivo.
Quando giochi la sensazione, oltre alla quasi inquietante solitudine, è che il gioco sia un pochino ripetitivo.
Ho notato che ci sono parecchie possibilità, ma onestamente non le ho provate, se avete voglia di iniziare vi consiglierei di farlo in 4 o 5 in maniera goliardica e vedere se lo staff risponde all'attività.

How could a game that receives so little time and effort devoted to it by the developer possibly be worth the time you'd have to invest to get anywhere playing it, considering the heavy cost the grind factor would demand. Why would you expect anything better to look to going forward?

In my opinion, it isn't worth your valuable time now and there is no reason to expect it will be any time soon, if ever. You'd be better off spending your time elsewhere.

There is no real tutorial, you're pretty much dropped into the world and got to find out how things work on your own (untill you figure out there's a ""manual"" you can get some hints from)
The game is free to play, so you know there's cash grabs going on like a $60 ""founders pack"" and cosmetic stuff for your base.

Biggest issue...? Where the heck are the players? When I first started I would see one or two in the startign area, but they might as well have been bots as i've had no social interaction. I skip a few months and check back just now and everything is dead. No players to be seen, no auctions going on, nothing.... Sure you could play this solo if you don't mind always being at a disadvantage in fights, but it's probably not going to be much fun, or you might be able to bribe some friends to play it with you.

I can't recommend this game right now, unless players return perhaps but that seems unlikely.
At least it's free if you decide to check it out anyways.

One is that it is a boring slog.  Moving from place to place takes forever.  Just moving around the town to get to merchants can involve vast distances, which is really boring with the click to move stuff.

Another is that the dungeons are very frustrating.  You quickly fill up your inventory, but then cannot just leave the dungeon because monsters have respawned behind you, forcing you to fight them again.  Now you have to spend time sorting inventory and throwing away what you want the least.

Gathering is annoying.  Crafting is grindy.  You are basically forced to have multiple characters to craft, but then transferring anything between them or storing your materials is going to require real money being spent due to the extreme limitations placed by the game.

In short, it struck me as being a complete trainwreck.

I found the gameplay unpleasantly dull and underdeveloped, with absolutely nothing that stood out for mention, much less compliment. I didn't see any indication of other players being online, and there are countless indications online that the game community is long dead and that the game stopped being updated a long while back. 

 The game feels like someone took out the most tedious, underdeveloped elements of Runescape and Everquest, sparsely dabbed a bit of the resulting mixture onto a very bare-bones, flash-game-style framework and then slapped a decidedly poor, unresponsive, information-lacking user interface on top of things, all just before promptly deciding that developing games was simply too much effort and dropping the project completely. 

Maybe some elements get fleshed out later, I can't say I managed to get too far into the game (or, more accurately, I couldn't tolerate playing any more than I did), but what I played was user-unfriendly, boring, grindy, clunky, unresponsive, unintuitive, poorly explained, and just so decidedly unfun that I'm rather confident the game never manages to get even a little bit bearable later in. 

To support that perspective, every comment I've seen that goes into the later game actually describes it as being even MORE underdeveloped and unbearable than the early game. Honestly, I've got to wonder if the positive reviews for this game were arranged by the publisher, or posted off an Early Access mindset: ""Well, it's gotta be able to get better than THIS, right? Let's just post a positive review to encourage them! Now to drink the other half of this bottle of bourbon.. hey, I was reviewing a survival game, right? ..It's Steam, I must have been.""

You have to cope with loneliness, endless grinding, other harsh conditions described shortly in average thumb-down reviews. But that shouldn't be a problem for a hard-core grinder, if you are one.

The game gives you all to succeed and prosper without the need of P2W, plus based on the developer's history it is going to be kept on 24/7 for the next 20 years.

Even there is much more to add in the game development, and frankly negative reviews should be considered before playing this as they emphasize the fact the game has special taste and is not for any and every player, I will give this positive review by enlightening as many good points the game has as I can describe.

First good point: This game does effectively NOT require Steam to play! Yay, you can forget the Steam curse in the background! I play this for a year and only have 6.5 hours logged as Steam! Really good point for laptops as you can save more PC memory, I play from a 10 yo laptop and the game minimum settings combined with no need for Steam client allow smooth 3D performance even on such kinda PC.

Point 2: It's a sandbox IMO. Even there is not much population, you can grab your world to the very last thing and control it, much like you do in Minecraft. You start from literally, zero. Six crafts to master, so you can craft everything starting from your own workbench and ending on enchanting your hand made gear. YOU craft your whole gameplay.

3: Grinding. It's a good, very good time killer. Up to 5 minutes per turn based combat, if you need to go AFK, your combat can last for hours or you can finish it in a minute if you play faster. You can master what, how you grind and where you grind. If you need cash you go kill skeletons, if you need seeds you go kill chompy plants. You know where are those dungeons and how to get there. Only given you find it out yourself. Experience matters.

4: You can try ironman as you can avoid or flee a battle you feel you gonna lose. Or you can die easily if you start playing careless. There is deaths counter, every other counters, statistics on everything. You remember exactly why you lost that fight. Make your own clan (much like your family) not a guild, be your own boss. If you lucky having clan mates you can grow it. Or play alone and enjoy your own clan shop.

5: Up to 50 alts per one account! Store all your loot, open shops and manage farmlands and crops for your cooking, transfer goods to main via shared slots. No players online? My army of alts laughs at this. I am too busy to notice.

P.s. I'm not giving the review to promote the game, just feel that this lacks pointed out review it deserves, based not only on first impression of legions of quitters I see coming and quitting. If you grind this you will get how to enjoy this. If this fits YOU, I repeat.",1550690286,1552544439,True,4,0,0.550742566585540771,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I missed games like these where you had to experiment instead of being pulled and forced to do stuff you do not want to.

On the other hand, there are a few pet peeves i had:
1.- Costumes are very basic, they are just Body + helmet + handhelds... this was OK in 2007. But eleven years later it is just disappointing... I would love to wear different gauntlets with the armor i have or let my driad sorceress wear sandals instead of boots
2.- Microtransactions, they are not bad in a free to play game like this, but asking for them to change the size of your base is a bit anoying
3.- Gibberish english that would make hornstown blush. Grammar errors are everywhere and it makes hard to understand what is happening. I know my english is not perfect but... seriously. this game is full of ""all your base are belong to us"" sentences.
4.- Trope-ish MMORPG quests that involve junk collecting, plague cleaning and grinding. We have seen these before in the other 12341029346781 clones of Ragnarok/WoW. Is asking for something different this time too much?

This doesn't last long, however, because you begin to find a rhythm in the first couple hours. The turn-based tactical combat reveals its complexity bit by bit the more you play, and creating that self-inflicted challenge by putting yourself in difficult scenarios is a big part of the fun.

It can be a bit of a grind at times, sure, but the point of a grind (for me) is always about the quality of the loot. And the loot is here. Finishing off a dungeon can be outrageously rewarding if you get something special. The experience (not the gameplay, which is quite different) reminds me a bit of those hours I used to spend grinding it out in Diablo. You live for those teeth-grinding moments when the loot is just right.

The community is on the smaller side, but those who are active are helpful and friendly. In all honesty, I'd rather dig into a game with a smaller playerbase with more interactions, than a massive social hub where you don't really know anyone. Again, this game is best enjoyed when pushing yourself just a little bit more, just a little further.... To try just another dungeon.

If you like the grind, you like loot, you like a tight community, then just give Stash a couple hours of your time. There's literally nothing to lose, so see if it's right for you.

There's a serviceable tactical combat system but strategy and positioning don't really seem that important. You can pin an enemy between yourself and a piece of terrain and that reduces their damage. You can flank and surround enemies also. But even with all this, it's just rudimentary tactics. It doesn't really do much to excite me. Also, the special abilities and spells are functional but not exciting.

The stash in camp starts with 20 slots for your character and 1 slot shared with your characters. It costs 7000 Medallions to add ONE slot to the shared stash. Adding a slot to your individual character's stash is also one slot at a time but you can use in game materials and Triads, the money that drops from monsters and shopkeepers. Everything is similarly monetized, ""do you want more than ONE crafting skill per character?"" ""That will be 5000 Medallions please."" The coins are priced at this moment at 4000 Medallions for $5 USD. These space upgrades and character upgrades seem to be too expensive. Giving a character just one crafting skill seems to be a little too strict.

The reason why I make such a big deal about the stash is that the game throws TONS of crafting materials and items at you. Many items need to be refined with machines that you can place in your BOO. That's right, your camp is actually called a ""BOO"" in game. This stands for ""Base of Operations."" Upgrading your BOO from just a sleeping roll, tiny chest and a cart is very expensive and basically the goal of the game. If you do not upgrade your BOO, there's no space to place the crafting stations or refiners that you need to use the raw materials. I'm surprised that none of these crafting stations exists in town, I suppose everyone crafts in secret in this world while hiding in their basements. 

Let's say that you just want to sell the items and move on. Well, there's no easy way to sell them. You can rent a stall in town or add the items to your stall in camp. I added several items to my stall in camp and nothing sold. You have to advertise what you are selling my marking it individually with an AD icon. First one is free, but then you have to pay unless you want to wait. It is also free to take an item down, but after that you have to pay or wait. Of course the stalls in town cost money, your choice of medallions or Triads with various rental periods. The next issue I had with selling was that the populations is so small that the player driven economy doesn't really exist. Prices seem to fluctuate wildly and other players, and their stalls, are the only method to do a price check.

I purchased the bundles from Chrono.gg and Otakubundle and they provided me with premium convenience items and 2 mounts. I found the mounts were underwhelming as they are just pieces of gear you equip and never see. I'm supposed to use my imagination I suppose, which is something I am capable of as I was playing Original Dungeons and Dragons before many of you were born. Even with XP Boost potions and some upgrades, I didn't feel like the money was well spent. I ended up using my currency on a bag slot and a larger bag to carry around with my starting backpack. It wasn't a very exciting purchase.

I ended up starting my first character over because I realized that male magic users, the Elementalists, NEVER wear a shirt. There's a costume system that covers your gear and locks you into your starting character's appearance. It looks like it changes in increments of 5{?} 10{?} levels with crafted costumes that you can wear. There was only two costumes available in the Medallion shop per class and the Elementalist ones were fancy but still shirtless. I asked other players and they basically told me ""I chose the no shirt life."" That's when I decided to start a new character.

When I made my new character, I had to juggle my account bound items from my old character one at a time using the one slot shared stash. Eventually my wife took pity on me and made an account and a character and she helped me move my remaining possessions. The shared space is SO small, it's hard to accept. This is especially a problem considering that you can only learn one crafting  skill per character and you need to juggle materials between them. Obviously many of these problems can be mitigated by guild mates but the population of the game is very low. As of this moment, the population is very low. [url=https://steamcharts.com/app/466660] Here is a link to the Steam Chart for Stash.[/url]

Another interesting feature is that the creator of the game has a character and is parked right next to the only city in the game at all hours of the day. He is denoted as staff by the lilypad next to his name. He spams the entire screen with advertisements for events and special equipment packs. He's obviously very devoted. If you complain about the game, in game, you will face the game creator and his minions. The ultimate boss battle! I'm half heartedly joking here, but it is kind of true.

Overall this game can be best described as a stale lemon cookie. At one time it was delicious, but now it's difficult to eat and the chef still insists on selling it to you for full price. I'm going to try and put some more time into the game and talk to the veteran players to get an idea of anything I missed or misunderstood. This review many be subject to change, but for now it is a thumbs down.

It is so indigestive, your wallet should suffer from constipation of money. The tactical combat is so shallow, Match 4 is more challenging than this.

Combat mechanics, base interaction, renting a stall to sell items to players, how to use traps, crafting, farming the plants and animals and harvesting resources.

I got to know this all by myself, by reading the game's short guides and item descriptions, and especially - curiosity with ""Trial and error"" method.
Later that time I talked to some player who said that if I wait longer before slaughtering/harvesting the animal/plant - it will produce other materials before it will pass away.

Stash is in its early stages of development. This means that there are bugs, glitches and unfinished features.
However, the community is active and the developer is constantly working hard to improve this game. 

This game has MASSIVE potential in the future. Get started sooner than later if you want to have the upperhand against your competition!

Pros:
- Its FREE!
- Friendly community with family friendly PG13 rules on globat chat
- More mature players can talk without limitations in 18+ chat
- Active developer that listens to player feedback. Help direct the future of the game!
- Has an ""Old School"" Runescape feel
- Weekly special events
- Not a ""pay to win"" game

Cons:
- Starting Tutorial is very simple... almost non existent. (This may be on purpose)
- Extremely time consuming GRIND.
- Limited Map that has not yet been fully implemented.
- Plenty of graphical and UI glitches/ bugs.

I have tried numberous times to chat and you rarely get a response. The grind to level and the grind to find these items to upgrade your BOO are just pain annoying right now. There are tradesills... but you cant start one until you have a lvl 2 BOO because you can not place the needed item down for tradeskills until you have an ""indoor"" room. So you are just stuck grinding even more to find those items you need. Tonight I spent 90 minutes trying to find 3 shingles so I can upgrade my BOO. I fought maybe 10-15 fights and managed to find 1... and I am out of storage in my BOO to place the items I looted that I ""THINK"" I ""MAY"" need later. So now my inventory is full and no where to place the items. Its quite annoying.

As you grow in player level and crafting level (basically level 20 for both), the game can become more of an exhausted effort due to other players not crafting what you need to excel in your personal craft, or finding people to group with (if you so choose that route).

Combat wise, I enjoyed it at first, however it becomes very redundant closing in milestone levels 15-20. The mobs are not hard, even if you increase the difficulty level of the dungeon.

Stash is basically a sand-boxy (no given storyline, pick ""fighting/crafting/tasks/camp-upgrade whenever you want"" system) game that plays online. You can join people in shared dungeons, do private dungeons or trade with them. 
The dungeons are a bit peculiar compared to common fare: Every encounter (open world or dungeons) is depicted by a board game like piece similar to your character, some moving around every so often, pretty much all easily evaded if you want to. Dungeons seem to have no ""end"". There might be a boss encounter placed somewhere and you might have to fight your way to this if other encounter block the way. But you won't find treasure chests outside of the ""encounter finished"" moment of the encounter. So it seems that ""clearing"" a dungeon if there is no boss encounter to be reached is not giving more rewards than fighting the same number of encounter in the open world. The dungeons just have encounter more concentrated in a smaller area and they are more themed than in the open world.

The loot is random gear for different classes, crafting ingredients, seeds, animals for husbandry, furniture, BOO upgrade parts. BOO is ""base of operation"", you could say your personal camp. You can upgrade and equip it with crafting stations, gardens, coops, barns etc. It is similar to farmville as in you have to unlock space and slots for storage/buildings/room sizes/yard space/crafting stations by ingame money and particular items (RNG loot, relatively rare). Or you can buy the latter in the microtransaction store for either ingame money (rather a lot) or real money.

You can buy some basic items from NPC in the capital, but the majority of items of better value seem to come from loot or especially crafting. Food is very valuable as it refills your HP and Mana points which you deplete in encounter. But while you can have orchards, gardens , coops and barns available and might be a chef selling your items at a market stall ... the necessary structures need a LOT of very LITTLE space in your BOO yard and the first tier (tiny ... coop/barn ...) only accept 2 seeds/saplings/animals, whose products you can't use directly but have to process to useable items. Even eggs have to be produced into ""raw eggs"" ... For which you need an expensive machine which needs to be placed inside the main building at your BOO ... which you have to unlock first and then it has only 6 slots. A processing machine needs 2 slots. Of course each actual crafting station takes another, for example your stove. And your animals or plants have a very limited life span during which they produce consistently, but they only produce until the storage space(Stash!) of the structure is full - but that space is tiny. So you better play often and constantly move things (into your VERY small STASH storage ... which you can upgrade ... yadda yadda) - or (later) you pay money to buy larger ones. Which need space and permission to be placed. Which you need to unlock.
It is basically this quickly escalating grind-in-circles thing to progress or you have not much to do. But that can be fine for people who are happy to just do some mindless little thing.

Here is the real problem in my opinion with Stash: the user interface is so unintuitive and convoluted that it takes people in chat to answer help calls because not even the wiki is useful. For example the character sheet has a little drop down menu which you won't realize. If you buy in the in-game shop something with ingame currency it is not placed into your inventory. It is placed into an extra ""rewards inventory"" only accessible via that drop down. Or you have an action bar - but it shows only if you are in an encounter or actively open it by going through another menu. And then it has 4 bars (combat, non-combat items etc) which you can only switch there but not if you have one bar open on itself and you need to eat but that can't be done on the combat bar. Or if you want to do any farming or husbandry you need to get the coops etc from a special merchant. All merchants are at the entrance level of the town - except the ones dealing with this. To find those you have to realize that the city has 4 levels and the stairs in one corner can be climbed if you click them right. Because everything is pathfinding by clicking at the floor but the stairs need to be hit ""right"". And then you spend a LONG time watching your figure piece sliding around from level to level to get to the top and those merchants, get the tasks, slide ALL the way back to the bottom level and outside, fullfill the tasks, get back to the city, slide all the way ... You catch the gist. A player told me you can at least have your figure do the whole thing automatically (but still as slow) by clicking at the wall supporting the highest level. Yay. Now I click, tab out, do something else, maybe remember to go back, interact with the npc, click the city gate for the way back, tab out ...
There are more example but I think that illuminates those really mind boggling designs.

The second thing that is really off putting - and I would never have thought I had such an issue with a game ever, I tend to always have the standard music on - is the music and sound effects. The music is bad, monotonous, constantly omnious, always the same except for encounter it seems. I switched it off entirely. The sound effects are very bad too. I play a cat and I'm close to switching those off too because the constantly yowl when I get hit is getting on my nerves.

I assume the UI and music/sound is an EA effect and I think Stash could find its niche. But right now it is VERY much an EA game. But hey, it is free ...",1523416951,1523661906,True,4,0,0.588631272315979004,0,False,False,False,False,,,

To begin with, the world map music, is the same as the city music and the INN music.
When you change maps, If the music on the map you entered is the same as the music 
from the map you just left, It doesn't matter, the music will be RESETTED! So you'll probably 
grow sick of it any minute soon.
The menu and character selection have no music, and you most likelly will get a jumpscare 
when the battle music begins, since It is way louder than the other game musics, aswell 
as more agitated, the other musics of the game are so calm and quiet, somewhat, but 
the battle music is intense and loud.

Unless you check the game help session, you will most likelly be lost in the game, since 
you'll be unable to make use of almost everything in the game, I still don't even know how 
to set a damn campfire. The explorability of the game content is really bad, If you try to learn 
to play the game by exploring what It has to offer, you'll only get anger and frustration, on my 
last minutes online, I were even having agony of playing the game, since not only I didn't knew 
how to craft things, but also had no idea how to restore my character health and mana, other 
than using food.

The crafting in the game is also kinda bad, beside the fact you need to find either encounter of 
the resources through the map, or have the luck of the resources you need to appear in a battle 
against enemy npcs, you actually need to have on the inventory the correct tool to gather that 
resource, so you need to go to the town and buy the tool, aswell as learn your first profession 
(Yes, I didn't found any sense when I found out that, even after I setup my char as a blacksmith). 
You need also to buy from the town npcs the crafting tables, and also guess what you need to 
craft an item, because the game doesn't tell you what you need to craft the item, and If you have not the 
tool to craft the item, the game wont tell you what tool you need, will only say you doesn't 
have the correct tool to craft the item.

The bed at your base, you can't use, so you can't restore your character health and mana, 
and since there is no idea of how to place a campfire, and the INN at the town seems to 
be some kind of battleground against the wind, the game is basically a battle 'till you drop, 
since you have to use the food you get on towns, or even the looted food to restore your 
health and mana.

This game also repeats a mistake that most mmos have, this game has 5 races, 2 of them 
you can select the gender, the others are gender locked, seriously, just why there is no 
other gender variant of the race? If your want to make a female Lycor (whatever is the name of 
the race), you will have to content yourself with the Warrior class, because other than that, 
you may attempt the Cat race.

Other than the rantings, this game surelly would look cooler If they removed that floor bellow the 
characters, and made them WALK, instead of slide through the map, because that makes the game 
look monotome when walking around, and kills part of the magic during the battle, If is to make 
the character behave like a piece of board game, would be better if It gave little hops when moving.

The combat in the game is quite generic, but is somewhat acceptable, but If you don't want to be 
bored, better party up with other people, and charge on higher leveled enemies, or try alone and 
rely on foods.

For some reason, the town npcs are shown as portals on the map, where when you step on it, their 
dialogue appears, I wonder, why didn't they made so the town npcs are shown on the map as their 
former self? If the problem were the fact that the players could aglomerate on it, then they could 
make so the players stop near it before talking.

Anyway, just due to the fact this game is a pain, I don't recommend it on the current state, but feel 
free to try it at your own risk. Also, that game for some reason made me want to play Wakfu, even 
though I hate the combat system of the game, at least is easier to learn how to play.",1523347613,1523347613,False,4,0,0.445982694625854492,0,False,False,False,False,,,

First things first, I do recommend this game, on a few conditions:
[list]
    [*]You enjoy slow paced gameplay
    [*]You can set your own target
    [*]You don't mind unpolished features
[/list]

Ok, so if you hear ""RPG"", and expect to be handheld through a smooth journey laid out like an interactive movie, then this game is not for you. I only reached level 10(current max level is 40), but it was a haul just to get there. It was a haul I enjoyed, but not because of the scenery. You will spend a lot of time clearing the same dungeons over and over, a task best done in groups, because it can be painfully slow solo. This game is best enjoyed in groups overall, groups where noone is in a hurry. At the moment the playerbase is small, and finding someone to grind with can be difficult(at least with my awkward hours, playing from Japan), but the people you do find beyond level 5 are all relaxed and nice people to spend time with. And that's what a game is about, isn't it? Spending time with nice people.. 
The game makes a point about not explaining more than it has to, but grasping the basics is really not difficult, and I believe the game is built on some good concepts, like player crafting being a core feature rather than a side track. It needs more polishing, and could see some improvements on playability, but I think it's a very good work in progress.

The original review can be seen here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/metsushiro/recommended/466660/


As a recently joined player that got past the first hour or so of this game, I'd like to point a few things out to you. I'm not saying you're wrong to be disappointed in the first little bit of the game, because you're probably used to how games throw everything at you all at once and force you into a handholdy tutorial in which you learn maybe a tenth of what they show you because it's throwing so much in your face. This game's main feature is that it doesn't do that. It's intentional. 

Some of the things you pointed out as flaws aren't actually a thing, you just didn't play long enough to see that. Maybe consider trying the game again some time? Maybe it's still not your thing, but here's the knowledge you should have before you make your final decision on whither to play again or not, addressed piece by piece in the order it's relevant. 

The housing system in this game IS exactly as you heard, but you need to spend the time to upgrade your Base of Operations once or twice before it really opens up for customization. You can put many different types of crafting stations, decorations, and furniture both inside and outside your home, and you can quite easily (if not cheaply) change the colour of the interior walls and floors of your home from the cash shop. Note that while the option of paying real money to make these changes is available, it is NOT necessary, as you can buy them with the in-game currency too, as with almost everything else in the cash shop. 
Yes, the game is grindy, that's literally the whole point of the genre. This game is a real RPG, not the watered-down thing people call an RPG now; you can spend years working on a character and have that progress actually mean something. You will always have something more to work on, and someone won't join up some day three years from now, pay $4000, and immediately be better than you in every way. 
The combat was slow-paced because you didn't know what you were doing. Every game is like that. You pick up speed as you learn the mechanics, and they roll out more mechanics for you to learn as you level up and unlock more skills. Most turns take me less than a second. 

The game has quests, lore, and storyline. All you have to do is look for it. It actually says that in one of those tutorial screens that you skipped, the moment you enter the town for the first time. Yes, the story isn't as fleshed out as it is in Skyrim, but for one they haven't spent millions of dollars and several years with a team of hundreds of people working on it, and for two this is something they are actively adding to, and will continue to do so for decades to come, if their reputation has even a bit of truth to it. 

You'd be hard-pressed to find ANY game where you can ignore everything and dash into a dungeon and somehow have any sense of story. Maybe a D&D session, i guess? Even then, only if your DM isn't thrown off by it and decides to crush you with a falling meteor because you're trying to circumvent his existance. You don't have a map because they are small pseudo-labrynths that aren't hard to navigate at all if you have any directional sense. You can fit almost the entire dungeon on screen at once if you zoom out. The combat was basic because you were level one. You try finding a game where they give you every skill in the game at level one, and then tell me how interesting that game was for the five minutes you played it before realizing there was nothing to do because you kill everything too easily. 

Of course the fights are instanced, there are other people playing that want experience too. Is the only mmorpg you've played Maplestory? If so, you should know how much of a problem people hogging all the enemies on a screen is there; you have to scan through twenty channels to find one where you won't get yelled at for trying to complete your quest. That isn't an issue with instanced combat, there are more than enough spawns for any number of players, even if they all happen to be doing the same quest. You can gather crafting materials from anything that is shiny in a fight, and there is a chest at the end of literally every single fight with ""exciting treasures and surprises"" in it. I don't know if there are fights later on that have field hazards as a game mechanic, I'm only level six so far and it could be rolled out later as something new has been added to the dynamics of combat literally every level at the point i'm at in the game. Even if they don't, I think the combat system is fine how it is. 

The very first guide that shows up the moment you log in to the game explains that you can read all of the guides at any point using the menus in the bottom right. they are there 100% of the time, even when you're in battle. Certain pages of these guides make more sense when you have a point of reference to say ""Oh yeah, that's what that was!"", and these show up when they are relevant, which is exactly what a well-designed tutorial does. 

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I'm not saying anything as an attack to you personally, I'm sure you're a well-educated person that loves gaming in their spare time, like most of the people from the last two generations. I only want to point out that you simply cannot see any of the depth of a game in less than an hour, especially in the sea of MMO's, where it's the little differences that make a gem of a game like this one stand out all the more. Please do consider giving it another go if you ever have the time, it really has so much more to it than you've seen, and likely than I've seen, too. 

TL;DR It isn't a good idea to judge every aspect of a game with such a brief glance at it. You'll miss the best ones.",1521310537,1521311155,True,14,0,0.642258822917938232,0,False,False,False,False,,,

It needs a lot of work.  Graphics are dull, interface is poorly designed, sounds are not very good, character creation is lame.  About the only good thing about character creation is that you have a lot of colour choices.  Races are boring, +x to one stat, no other differences.  Backgrounds mean nothing.  You were a blacksmith?  Cool.  Gives you a bonus to blacksmithing or strength or heat tolerance?  Nope.  You were a Gypsy(Steam Censors that?  Really?)?  Give you a bonus to making camp, lore or any travel related skills?  Nope.  You were a noble?  Got better gear?  More money?  Authority of some kind?  Special title?  Nope.

You can activate abilities that give you bonuses for a real time duration.  Yeah.  In a turn based game.  So the faster you do things in a TURN BASED GAME the longer that ability ""lasts"" until you have to re-activate it.

Combat was dull as heck and the three strategic bonuses or penalties were pretty stupid and pointless at low levels where they give small % bonuses.  As with all games that use % damage buff or debuff, or % based damage mitigation there's an issue when damage output, or incoming damage, is 2 or 3 points.  I don't care if a 2 point hit gets reduced to 1.8 rounded up..... because it does NOTHING.  I don't care if my 28 damage swing suddenly does 31 if all enemies have about 40 health.  I have to hit them twice with, or without, the bonus so it does NOTHING.  Ok, enough about that.

I usually enjoy turn based strategy games but this one was so dull, so absolutely lifeless and poorly designed, that I didn't care to keep playing long enough to see if it gets any better.  If a game is really good it will hook you almost immediately, not make you want to stop playing within minutes.... and that's about all I have to say.",1521294593,1635037586,False,7,0,0.54992377758026123,0,False,False,False,False,,,

In a nutshell:

The game is extremely basic. As an ex game designer, I would call this game an engine preview to offer to management for development consideration. Nothing more. 

This game has no story, no quests, and does nothing to keep you interested in the game. You create a character, you enter the world, and you kill monsters. That's it. Yes, you can explore. Yes, you can craft. Yes, you can build your house. But my point is that there is nothing in this game to excite me to come back to the game and pursue those things.

Stash is exactly as advertised; very grindy, repetitive, cute graphics, has no quests and has a very very (painfully) slow combat pace.

The game itself lacks of a storyline and objectives. As you finish creating your character, you will find yourself between 2 dungeons and your home, with only an arrow on the floor to guide you (no tutorials). 

At this point, there is no purpose to stay at home since we have nothing to customize with. Not even the colour of our beginner home can be changed; leaving us with nothing to look forward to.

On to our first dungeon! Once inside, there are once again, no story involved. Your only motivation is your will to kill everything. At first glance, we were quickly disappointed that a map wasn't available. In confusion as to the whereabouts we should be going, we decided to go on forth towards our first enemy! Engaging in combat will teleport you to an instance and that is where you fight. Click tile, select skill, hurt enemy; repeat until enemy is dead. Exit instance, walk up to next enemy, enter instance, kill, repeat. While the basics are there, the combat is bare and not engaging whatsoever. 

It would be much more interactive if the fight was taking place directly onto the dungeon's ground (no need to load an instance) and if the surroundings could affect the combat; whereas if you step on a fire tile, you will catch on fire and receive ""fire status."" Or have the ability to break crates / chests for exciting treasures and surprises.

Every now and again a quick guide will pop up, explaining the functions of things. We were confused as to why the guides appeared after we've seen said functions, and not prior to. For example, you will receive a 'pinned' or 'surrounded' status in combat and (while these are pretty straightforward) the explanation appeared only after we defeated the instanced fight. We can't help but wonder if a short tutorial should have been implemented to help ensure a smooth and uninterupted gameplay.

Whilst we've played and enjoyed many other turn based RPGs, Stash sadly is not deep nor unique as it claims to be. We were not entertained in the slightiest bit and most of our gameplay was spent wondering why we weren't playing something else.",1519464494,1519537503,False,10,1,0.468718618154525757,4,False,False,False,False,,,

We have hundreds, possibly thousands, of hours of time invested in Linux specific bug fixes, making Linux builds, and uploading Linux builds every single time we have an update/patch.

The game is AMAZING.

I've barely cracked the surface of Stash and i'm LOVING it. Do you want full immersion in a world of dev God's and player plebs? Stash has it. Do you want to run dungeons and destroy mobs at a lower/higher level than you? Stash has it! Ever wanted to sit in your house while farming and crafting gear for hours at the same time as you sleep next to someone waiting for the immenant chaos to ensue? STASH HAS IT!

The world of Grind stash brings has never been so real. I've been waiting for a game to grind my heart away and I've found it. I'm all about the ding I'm all about the plox and I'm all about the subtle RP that confuses most but inspires the rest.

The dev's are always there, theyre always watching, they hear/see all the feedback and act accordingly from it. 

tldr: If you want a game that feels like WoW did back in it's vanilla days, if you want a game you can fall asleep to and wake up like its irl, if you want a game that will keep you smiling until you realize you should have slept 4 hours prior Then  IMO this is the game for you.

If you see someone high level, or on the leader boards, you will know they put in serious time, and are likely very knowledgeable in the game.

Yes I suppose I have to elaborate on these points so ok....ok so grindy isn't bad but in this game its so repetetive, boring, and without any innovation whatsoever.   One thing that sucks is that there are limited mobs such as like only 10 enemy types or the fact that the game uses stupid pedestals for your character instead of walking animations, the fact that the main city is large it takes a long time to walk up to the top floor for some quest givers which is unnecessary.  I did play into a few levels of the game and got a crafting skill up a bit so I have played the game.  Also, it is pay to win as certain things like multiple crafting skills have to be purchased with real money.  Chat is mostly completely dead in the game if you ask a question one of the five or so regular players will angrily shout ""READ THE WIKI!!"" and if you mention pay to win they say ""IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN!!""  The wiki isn't much help right now as it is all voluntary player based input and very minimal..

Someone else mentioned how stupid it is that the game loads you into resource nodes where you just move around a few squares and harvest it.  Why not just harvest it from the map?  LOL its insanely stupid but I won't go into detail since that horse has been beaten bloody in other reviews.

Classes: 
Only a very basic selection (Warrior, mage, healer, and archer variety). Each class has very different skill sets, and stats affect each class differently. Armor for each class is based on the old school D&D theory; mage stays in cloth, Healer starts in leather, but can upgrade to chain later. Archer can start in leather, but upgrade to ring mail. Warrior starts in chain, and can use plate later. Each class serves a different function, and this definitely adds a strategic layer to combat (more on combat later).

BoO:
Base of Operations; this is your house/crafting factory/farm/personal space. If you want to design a swanky spot, go for it. Me, however... I went for the sweat shop vibe, with crafting stations all over the place. As you use resources to level up your BoO, you get more space to put things, can have more than one crafting station for the same craft class, and so forth...

Crafting:
Six main crafts: Cooking, Enchanting, Armor, Weapons, Alchemy, Making (think tools and furniture and crafting stations). Each recipe requires multiple mats, as is usual. There are various harvesting skills as well: Trapping, salvage, mining, herbs, lumber, gems, skinning, and farming. All of this functions into a well crafted, albeit a bit grindy, crafting ecosystem.

A caveat to add here: Each character can only have one crafting profession to start. You can either purchase an expansion with the cash shop currency, or you can buy the expansion with in-game funds from a player that bought it in the cash shop.

Combat: 
Think.... Baldur's gate meets final fantasy tactics. Turn based, tactical combat on a grid-based map. Groups of up to 6 (Maybe 5), and the fights can actually take quite a bit of time. They require the use of CC, heals, kiting, damage, gear that is level appropriate... all of the makings for a solid challenge. Dungeons, currently, are a single floor, and not completely fleshed out, but they are full of stuff to kill and loot to collect.

Cash shop: 
Thankfully, most things in the cash shop can be bought for cash shop currency OR in-game currency. The only things that cannot be bought directly from the cash shop for in-game currency are: additional character slots, the largest of the backpacks, some cosmetic items, and additional crafting skill slots. These things CAN, however, be purchased for in-game currency from other players that have purchased them with cash shop currency.

Trading:
Reminiscent of Oldschool Everquest; you want to sell stuff? Either toss it up in trade chat and find a buyer, or set it for sale at your own personal stall. This actually puts you into better contact with the community and engages you with it, bring back the need to actually play with other people.

Overall:
All of that said, YES, I would recommend the game, but I will sum up some pros and cons.

PROS: 
-The game has depth. Combat and crafting are intricate, engaging, require thought, and will keep you busy. There is no empty clicking and walking away for 30 minutes while you craft 20 stacks of stuff. It is involved, but in a good way.
- Accessibility for those with no real world funding. If you can't spend cash on it, you can but it with in-game currency
- The community is great. There aren't trolls, everyone is helpful, and the moderators and Devs are fully involved with the community, both in-game and on the community forums.
- Almost 50 hours, as of this review, and I have run into no bugs or crashes. Probably one of the smoothest early access games I have ever played.

Cons:
-A niche game with a smaller community, and it may not be for everyone
-Possibility of RMT abuse if people with the cash want to flood the market with cash shop items, essentially ""buying gold"". This could lead to some debate.
-The game is still very rough. Dungeons aren't fully fleshed out. There are invisible walls on the map to keep folks within the current early access area. Max level is currently 25, as they implement the higher content. Yes, it is Early access, but people tend to have issues with this.
-Can feel like a super grind at times. If you aren't up for grinding, whether it be harvesting, crafting, or hunting, then this probably isn't for you.",1517975022,1517975022,True,4,0,0.527229189872741699,0,False,False,False,False,,,

- Can have up to 6 people in party
- Game runs very smoothly
- Dev is very involved in game
- Random instances keep for an interesting experience
- Stays true to table top games for flanking and disadvantages on attacks.
- Very well done in game help guide with clickable index for finding just what you are lookings for.
- Great in game community. Very friendly and helpful.

Cons:
- When you don't have the right equipment for harvesting it does not indicate which equipment you need.
--- Maybe better if the bosses were a private instance that did not go unavailable when other parties enter.
- Hard to communicate on the battle field due to the grid not having any indicators such as alphanumeric columns and rows.
- Harvesting items during battle is not intuitive and I personally could not find anything in the guide. However the community did help me through the process.

The combat seems simple at start but you will see soon that you get 1 skill per lvl (I dont know if thats true for every lvl, at least until lvl 10, max is 30 if Im not mistaken) so it gives you more options to make strategies and enemies and battle get way more complicated over time.

It looked simple with some basic features. Unfortunately those features don't work 99% of the time. 

-The starting gear I received didn't match my class. The only gear I picked up was for the mage class. Not sure if that's intentional but I had 15+ articles of gear, all for the mage. Not one was for any other class. I'm an archer.

-The first mob I ran into had 3x my health and killed me instantly (in a level 1 area). Mobs that deal 50 damage are labeled under the same level and difficulty as those dealing 3 damage. Luck of the draw of who you run into as a level 1.

-The mob encounter shows only one mob. Once you enter the instance, it could be 1 monster at your level or it could be 4 monsters at your level.

-The game wants you to party up but after an hour, I found no other players. Saw some ads ""LFG"" for level 20+. Nothing beyond that.

-I managed to buy a lvl 1 axe but it can't gather lvl 1 wood. I've been able to harvest some lvl 1 wood; but then walk 10 feet to the side and not be able to harvest the same lvl 1 wood. The exact–same–wood.

-The camera angle is absolutely horrible. You can't move it in combat. You can only rotate it. So if your character is on the other side of the entire area, you have to play them from long-distance and hope you're clicking on the right tiles. If you rotate the camera to your character, they're blocked by your skill bar and chat box. 

-Gender-specific classes. 

-Skill info tips are wrong. Light damage vs moderate damage = 25 damage vs 20 damage. Not sure what's going on there.

-My archer can shoot an arrow 3 squares but melee units can also hit from 3 squares. So what's the point? Image provided where I'm getting hit by the units with melee attacks. You can also see that I tried to harvest the resource and couldn't, despite having the proper harvesting tool. https://imgur.com/a/P5liK

-All units can move 4 squares each turn. Why be a fast rogue when you can be a just as fast tank? 

-No map in the game. 

-Melee does WAY more than any spell/arrow. I was literally melee smacking people with my bow because it does more damage than my bow skills. Melee hit does 30+ and arrows do ~15.

-No auction house. 

-The stores are very random. All the NPCs are just labeled as ""Merchant"". No idea who sells what.

-Other players can put up shops but without an auction house, no one knows what anything is worth. 

-Most of the chat is roleplay. 

-I saw some people trying to trade in chat but literally everyone trading kept argueing about the price of items. I don't think any trades actually happened. It's not like the prices were off by a few items. Some players are saying an item is worth 20 and other players are saying it's worth 300.

-No moving animation. Not a horrible thing but it looks extra cheesy to have your person float around on a platform, sliding from zone to zone. 

-You have to enter a new instance of the game to gather resources. I'm not kidding about this. You literally have to load an entirely different instance on each resource you gather. You approach the resource, the game asks if you if you want to harvest, you click yes, it sends you to another dimension with a random amount of resources around you. It's not a smooth transition either. There's a whole load screen and map construction for each resource you try to harvest. Sometimes the axe works, most of the time it doesn't. Luck of the draw.

Put an hour into the game and just ran into one disaster after another.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-After the response of the GM-

Hello Ringold! I was actually coming back here to say that the in-game mods/admin were trying to be helpful and such. I'm glad you reached out. 

The game has arrows that kept pointing me into dungeons. I get into the dungeon and walk around. Only mob I run into is the boss. This happened over and over. Eventually I found some mobs farther out and leveled up some.

Yes, Axe issues. In some areas of the game, the wood would harvest normally. But 80% of the time, it wouldn't. Same name of wood. Same level area. Very luck of the draw. Not sure what was going on. Used the same method on each harvest. Each harvest was the same wood.
Got you some screen shots buddy:
Doesn't seem to be working
https://imgur.com/a/Mnlak

Is this the wrong axe for level 1 wood?
https://imgur.com/a/XeQul

Oh and, let me know which tool I need to loot a dead body because apparently this is a problem as well: https://imgur.com/a/AhBfr

I tried the camera angles. I did. I went through the tutorial and everything. After mentioning it in game. You commented to use scroll in and such. All of which I was doing and it was working as intended. However, I could not move my camera from the original focus point of the plane. I could only rotate my camera around and zoom in+out. It left for very awkward angles as I mentioned in my review.

Yes, I mentioned the instances. Good job reciting what I pointed out. You can't just click on it? That's kind of the point here. I mean, even RuneScape has that down. Your current process is: click use button (optional), click item, confirm you want to harvest, load area, click harvest tool, harvest, back button, load area. Holy shit. (I need to confirm this order. Hold on.)... I got that order for ya. I found out that I can just run into the thing. So that's pretty nifty. But here ya go: Run to the harvestable item, Confirm you want to harvest the harvestable item, load area, find the harvestable items, click on harvest tool, use harvest tool, click on harvest tool, use harvest tool, click on exit button, confirm exit, load area. There's a section in there that isn't needed.

Maps ruin immersion? Uhh.. no. What's the first thing an adventurer should do when finding a new area? Map it out! You see.. throughout history, humans have explored the unknown world; charting the lands in what is now known as a map. A map of an area is very useful. It lets you know if there's a town nearby or if you're just walking off into the distance and nothing is ahead of you. As small as your world is, I got lost a couple times and had to use a teleport to get back home. A map breaks immersion but teleporting in and out of existance isn't? I'm a level 1 with a global range teleportation skill but I can't hold a map. You guys are funny.

Since we're on the topic about ""trying to keep the game immersive"", I'll refer you back to the loading screen problem. Every time I gather a resource, I have to enter a new plane of existance. Which resets the music and ambient sounds. Then it restarts again when you re-enter the world. Kind of a loss of immersion there. Why not just, oh I don't know, not have a seperate instance for each resource?

Game wasn't super bad. I liked the in-game instant service the best. Although it was pretty laggy when moving on the main platform and in the city. My normal ping is 10 to 50 in most games. Connection for move confirmation to slide my character was hugging around 600 ping. Some potato server stuff right there. Maybes it's a server default ping to keep everyone the same or something. I don't know.

I keep going back to try out the game some more and I keep geting more gold out of it. So apparently, beyond eating noobie nublet food, the only way to charge HP is at the inn. Which takes up to 10 minutes to charge you HP. This is by far the worst HP recovery system I have ever seen. You want players to sit in an empty room for 10 minutes before going back out? Oh my god. Haha! I guess you could try to craft a camp fire but since level 1 axes can't harvest level 1 wood, I can't gather any.

I've been trying to figure out a way to charge my HP without waiting 10 minutes at an inn. Turns out, I can just kill myself and get full HP. There's a 5% exp loss but it takes about 2 minutes to get that back.",1516303087,1516382501,False,36,2,0.649491548538208008,12,False,False,False,False,,,

There is currently no pvp, but clan based and potential other pvp funtions are in the works.

The game is not P2W, but there are convinence items and cosmetics that are great to have. They are not essential to be the best :) There are currently less than 10 things in the cash shop that can't be bought with in game currency (excluding cosmectics, but including xp boosts, an xp debt item, a storage bag [it is only 2 slots more than the highest available with ingame currency], the ability to have more than 4 characters, and the ability to have more than one ""complex"" profession on a character [i.e. cooking, weapon smithing, alchemy, etc.]). Many of said items can be bought through the market via ingame currency from players.

As of the time of this edit, the developer has addressed most of the things i mentioned in this review and has replied below.  Please read their response before taking my review at face.  I have changed my score to positive as they have fixed what I thought made the game not worth playing.  I don't know if I'd personally be willing to invest time into the game just yet, but there are certainly people who would find it fun.

Old review:

This game has potential, but it's severely lacking in certain areas.  The game consists entirely of grind and tactical combat, and that is enjoyable for some people.  But, the process of doing both of these has certain things about them that makes them unenjoyable.

First of all, the game desparately needs a context sensitive click system when in combat.  When trying to do anything, you must first select the catagory of what you want to do, like move, skills, gather, ect. and then click on the grid to do it.  Almost every other with this sort of combat has the ability to do things automatically when you click on a space, like move to that space if the space is empty, gather if the space has a resource node on it, or do a basic attack if there's an enemy there.  Being able to chain these as well would be nice, like clicking on an enemy out of melee range, and the game moves your character into range and attacks. Having to select what you want to do every time gets tiresome fast.

Another thing the game needs to fix is the camera.  Outside of combat you cannot move the center of focus for the camera, which means that finding the right way to go is incredibly frustrating, as the dungeons are mostly mazes.  It's very easy to get lost and not know where the exit is, and since most tiles are the exact same texture and look, it's not like you can use your surroundings to figure it out.  The camera also likes to move behind things that don't turn invisible, meaning you have to constantly be fighting with it to see what's going on.

While these things may be nitpicky, since the game wants you to be grinding for a very long time, the struggle with just playing the base game becomes too much.  If these issues were addressed, it might be worth playing, but like other reviewers have said, there are other things lacking as well.  As of right now, the game isn't worth investing time into, but that could change.  The idea isn't horrible, so maybe with some polish it could have a niche following.",1516172204,1518137317,True,0,0,0.526647090911865234,4,False,False,False,False,,,

It is completely f2p with optional purchases. We get the perfect blend between a board game and a MMORPG, here you will see characters standing on a peg base giving it a very unique feel.

Key features:
-	Real Free to Play
-	Old School
-	Turn based combat
-	Elaborate crafting system
-	Friendly community oriented game
-	Grind in a fun progressive way (I have played 60 hours in 3 days...)
-	Working economy with no staff interference required
-	Very customizable
-	Great music
-	Staff listens to players
-       Roleplay friendly
-	Specialized AI


Stash is not for everybody. This is a turn based tiled MMORPG with global dungeons, private dungeons and more. It is not intended to be easily mastered in every way and it brings back that feeling of challenge to it, where decisions you make have real outcomes on what you do and how you do it. I recommend giving it a try, it’s free and a small download.

Being an indie developer, graphics might look funny (and they actually are funny); yet Stash brings a lot of innovative systems to the MMORPG genre.

Game-play is a lot of fun, it can be a bit tedious at times because of how challenging the game has been tailored on contrary to about any other game out there where our attention is rapidly lost and we end up looking for another game within a week because of the greed vs benefit ratio the game has.

Stash brings back that social aspect of games, this is a game with a true community.

I have to say that the way monster AI works on Stash is exceptionally well done. They have types, races, roles, etc and each one of these characteristics add to the way they behave. This creates formidable combinations to fight against making it challenging, yet not impossible.

What to expect?

-	Slightly confusing at the beginning
-	Lots of documentation accessible in-game
-	Turn based combat
-	Addictive grinding
-	Crafting is important
-	Stash/Inventory space is limited yet freely expandable
-	Friendly community
-	Difficult first few levels
-	Couple minor bugs and UI issues that are being worked on
-	Placing ads on the in-game newspaper to sell valuable loot
-	Lots and lots of old school fun

This game is like a board game come to life. You have a ""pawn"" that moves around squares on the ""board"". You have a camp (house) to upgrade, furnish, craft, garden, etc. You go find & fight mobs for loot & materials in fun turn based mini-dungeons. These encounters are scattered randomly around the board & are color coded by difficulty, so you can make the fights as easy, or as difficult, as you desire. 

It has clans (guilds) and a social, talkative community that actually help each other out. If, like me, you miss that social atmosphere from games in your past, you'll happily find it again here. Its easy to solo encounters & just as easy to find others to party up with.

There are tons of different things to do to keep you busy: 
- fight mobs
- gather resources
- complete task
- craft
- farm plants/animals
- sell/buy at market
- upgrade camp, bags, stall, stash
- clan bonfire events
- random, friendly competitions for rewards

But...it still needs work.

Cons:
- No search in market
- No map
- No guidance/instructions provided for most items, making many things unclear as how to proceed
- Wiki very incomplete
- No directional marker. Easy to get turned around.
- No zoom inside larger dungeons

There are little to no guides for the game and it is not shy of letting you grind. Everything from collecting resources for your base to getting new gear requires significant effort, as crafting items requires materials that drop as loot in dungeons. It’s a bit overwhelming at first but the community is really helpful and you can be up to speed in no time.
The game doesn’t really have a great story and the MMO open world feels a bit small. The developers have said that they will be adding new areas and story elements, but nothing can be said about that yet.
Character customization is not something that I expected to be good, but I found it very enjoyable and spent a decent amount of time tinkering with it.
Overall, I like the game’s premise and found it very fun. It seems like it is going to get even better so I would recommend it to anyone looking to try a new MMO.

The community seems nice, but a game is more than just a good community when its so small the opportunities also get smaller.

Could they turn this around?  Yes, any game can, but will they?  In the history of video games such turn-arounds have happened, but its requires such a radical change that they most likely will not want to bother.

This game would be good for an early access or a beta, but as a complete game, very limited and in my opinion no real replay value.

Missing something important should be forgiveable here, as the wiki is a joke with most pages either being 'stub' or a couple of sentences pasted from the in-game description.

So for the first ~2.5 hours, I'm totally and utterly lost, and without the help of other players in the chat I'd still be. There's some basic in-game guides for certain aspects, but plenty of stuff isn't covered and this is only for the very beginning.

First thing that happens is I go into an encounter with a decrepit gargantupine. Turns out it meant 2 porcupines and a bat, all level 3 which totally wreck me as I'm level 1.

I die, I respawn, and I now fight something easier.

Level 1 bats. Where the porcupines were doing like 30 damage, this guys do about 3-4. I try to spam my firebolt spell, but, turns out you have to wait a turn. And it does basically the same damage as swinging my staff like a club. It turns out this is how you're meant to fight, just spamming melee attacks every turn. But aha, there's strategy! If multiple teammates are adjacent to an enemy they get [i]surrounded[/i], and there's similar stuff for being [i]flanked[/i] and [i]pinned[/i]. Great! Except every combatant moves about 4 squares at a time and can escape basically any bad situation. This also means the [i]surrounded[/i] thing is just a flat debuff to your damage in basically every solo battle as you are always outnumbered and you can't out-run them.

I later find out (of course I have to look at the wiki) that I should learn a profession. [i][b][u]A[/u][/b][/i] profession, as you have to pay to learn another. I choose enchanter as this seems like a good way to power up my armour. Speaking of armour, I have a look at some stalls. (Did I mention that there is apparently no central auction house? You either right-click people to trade with them (good luck with that) or use people's 'stalls' of which you get a random-ish selection, refined into 3-5 broad categories. No search function. No easy price comparison. Yuk.)

The armour and weapons I come across look... familiar. I have a look at the wiki to see what there is and I see a grand total of 25 things. Now there may be more, but I've never seen any evidence of it. And that's not 25 options per slot, that's 25 [b]TOTAL[/b]. ie [i]one set per class[/i]. Compare that to another MMO I played (which I had hoped this would be an improvement on). Something like 1000 different bits of gear, just based on the number of wiki pages. And some have unique abilities. I get that that was by a much larger dev team, and making lots of 3D models takes a lot of time, but seriously. Besides, a two-person dev team that was Cube World gave us plenty of variety. A third MMO I played had about 200, and those had very detailed models. We don't even need different skins for them or even inventory icons (speaking of which, there are only a few and lots of different items share the same icon), but [i]one set per class[/i]. I just can't get over how ridiculous that is.

You can of course get different qualities and enchantment slots, but there are no special abilities. It does come in different levels, but that's just an extra bit of grind attached to every few levels you want to go up. Speaking of grind:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

'nuff said. Actually, let me say a little bit more. The max level is 30. According to the leaderboards, 8 people have reached this point. None in my class. Really inspiring, isn't it? The grind amounts to fighting encounters or going into dungeons (glorified encounter-fests), gathering the shitty materials and worthless gear and selling it to vendors (at terrible prices) or to players (of which there are so few, and no-one wants to buy your junk). Throughout your travels you can discover a vast array of adversaries, amounting to a jaw-dropping... 12 different types. There are at least bosses as well, 5 different ones according to the wiki. 2 of which have no link and I suspect don't actually exist in-game. In order to at least give this game a fair review I gave one of them a go, first solo (which amounted to playing hide-and-seek around a rock with a boss who has a self-healing spell that heals about 40% more damage than I can deal in the same amount of time) and then with a partner (a much better experience, if she had started on full health I think we would have won). In the other MMO I mentioned, there are hundreds of unique monsters and probably 70+ unique bosses [i]all with their own unique attacks and mechanics[/i]. Here bosses are just tanky monsters with a healing spell. As for variety in attacks, to my knowledge all monsters have one melee attack and one ranged attack. Some have decent animations at least, but the variety is totally superficial.

That brings me on to the playerbase. Now, contrary to what I've heard from the other negative reviews, the people I've met in chat have been helpful and friendly. Slight problem. There's only a few of them. In this few hours I've racked up the most deaths on the leaderboard this week (11) and according to Steam Charts there's a staggering 22.5 people online on average.

I never really tried out the base building properly, since the material grind is unreal. Each upgrade needs something like 3-10 building materials (of which there are about 6 types so there's always one that you just can't find), and where do you get those? From a DIY store in the main town (more about that later)? Nope, you get them from killing monsters, and it's a pretty uncommon drop so get grinding. After a fair bit of said grinding I finally find a bloody stupid wooden plank and upgrade my stash, which at this point is bursting at the seams with only 20 slots. Huzzah! I can store more stuff now! The storage has been upgraded to... 21 slots. Ah. Next I have to do about double the grind to even be able to place my enchanting crafting thing, but I've long since given up hope.

Finally, the map. Here's a quote from the wiki:


[i]Primordiax is the massive open world and realm in which Stash takes place.[/i]

Funny isn't it? Stash has the smallest world of any game I've ever seen. Look at my playtime: I've walked all the way along its Western edge. In about 5 minutes. And I forgot to mention how agonisingly slow walking is in this game, so yeah. I mentioned the 'main town' earlier. Turns out it's the only town, as far as I am aware. Look at the wiki: the [i]Locations[/i] category has 2 pages:
Askagard
Dungeons
Funnier still, this is the same page that I got the quote above from.

But how could I be so unsure of whether there are other towns? Because there's no map of course! I can only assume that the impassable barriers (forests that you can't step into, a mysterious ghostly red wall, no map loading beyond a certain point, 3m tall mountains you can't climb and the many streams (seriously, they look like they must be at least 6 inches deep, don't go in them or you might drown)).

I can see why they say this is like a tabletop game: they've cleverly managed to fit all of the fuck all content into a 'massive open world' that fits on your tabletop. Brilliant, right?

----------------

So, I've rambled a lot, but my point should be clear. This has something like 10% of the content of an actual playable game, and the gaping hole that is left is filled by extreme grind. Much of the stuff that is boasted about in the trailer and elsewhere is just standard fare for an MMO (or at least certainly isn't unique to Stash), except done in a unique way (unique as in no-one else would dream of making something so grindy and unfinished). The only bits that do actually stand out (the nice graphical look and the turn-based combat) are not good enough to make this an actual game, with the turn-based combat being totally shallow and dull.

I don't want to describe all the issues, as it would be a useless multi-page review. So here's a short summary:

- There's no real content in this game. All you do is go to autogenerated dungeon (not a real dungeon btw, simply rectangular area filled with mobs, without any story/theme/objectives etc.), kill mobs one by one in an extremely repetitive turn-based combat, fill inventory, go to the only city (!) in the game and sell loot. Quest lines/story/events/exploration are basically non existent in this game.
- The game is underpopulated. On average, there are only about 10 people online minding their own business. At times it makes it feel like a single player game.
- I know this is an indie game with a very small dev team, but even so the quality is just... bad. Even if you ignore the numerous bugs the game feels more like an unfinished prototype. 
- If you dare to give your feedback or suggest some improvements to the game, the community (yes, those 10 people who play the game) gets really defensive about it. This is usually a sign that the game is not going to be getting any better.

P.S. Props to the devs for making the game work natively on linux.

Pro: 
Great community and developer team who are regularly involved with new events.
Fun turned based combat mode
Base of Operations is a player housing system unlike other games.
Not Pay to win although you can get a small advantage from the Medallion shop with real money but nothing that really makes you powerful just more convenience.
Cons:
Lack of content makes the game very repetitive and grindy after about 10-12 hours of play.
Leveling is too slow even at the low levels.
Crafting is too slow even at the low levels.
Good items are all player crafted and therefore there is little to look forward to when getting chest. This for me is the biggest letdown of the game. It can be grindy but if RNG can turn up some great powerful items, there is always a motivation to fight more. Now after every fight i dun even bother looking at what i get in the chest. You only get more powerful every 5 levels and the levels in between are just numbers to get through with no significant benefits. Please upgrade your loot system.

5/10 Good game great potential but some areas needs immediate improvement if the game wants to attract more people beyond the first few hours.

Edit: Ok I no longer recommend this game. It seems I was lucky and the period which I joined the game happened to be a brief period where they was some activity.

- Was givin bad advice from many experienced community members. causeing me to lose days worth of work and more then all the money I had in game. I had to grind more money just to fix the problems that were caused.

- My Stall filled with overpriced materials that were too high a price for any new player to buy and just right for high level players with lots and lot of money. Even the devs wanted to argue that the prices were fine, when on that same day he was having trouble answering questions about his own game's features to a streamer.

- Removing any item from your satll is free, 1 per hour. Then it cost 25% of the price you put it up for.... NOT 25% of what you make off it, it's not sold yet. I had 20 stacks of low level mats on my stall, so. my options are... wait for the super rich players to evetually deside they want to make a new alt, and try a new craft, in like 2 months. and buy the mats. or take 19 hours, and an alarm clock set to every hour to remove them all, or just dump wasted money into this stupid system to get it done and over with so i can go back to playing.

- Having problems with making enough money in the game. The comunity tells me best way is grinding dungeons. after an hour of grinding and replacing the food i used in combat. I had lost money. Devs and players confussed by how much food I use. Suggest I need better armor or weapons. I have the best weapons and armor possible for my level minus 1 piece. and max primary stat. while playing ""the most OP class""... so then i have to question... Is it required that you play the game perfectly? and have the perfect gear at all times? just to be able to sustain gameplay?

- Turns out the reason I'm running out of food is cuz i use too much mana, and burn through my skills alot. who has ever heard of the term ""Skill rotation"" in mmos? Every mmo gamer ever? oh ok good, just making sure. how is it my fault, that you don't want your classes to actually use their skills, and just melee attack most of the time? but everything is my fault according to the devs. (and i guess i have to be super spasific cuz otherwise the dev can't understand basic english. When i say ""you don't want your classes to actually use their skills"" i obviously mean, not to use them all the time, like in every other mmo ever, where you have a skill rotation. and when i say ""melee attack most of the time"" i don't mean all of the time, ... use your skills when needed, Stop putting words in my mouth when any normal person would obviously know what i ment.)

so, I'm Preasured and persuaded into voiceing my concerns to the devs.

- My 2nd time talking with the Dev about my issues with the game, and there is a reason i really didn't want to talk to him a 2nd time, so again... I was told by the devs mutiple times I'm playing the game wrong somehow as i'm the only person ever to have any problems with the game and that it must be my fault. great customer service... tell the customer that they are wrong and it's their fault.... always works.

- The dev thought we should discuss my concerns publicly in the discord chat in front of everyone, where i was insulted by both community members and advisors(dev selected community leaders). As the dev just watched these players in chat and did nothing about it.

As for the game itself. 

- Visuals - I like, altho I would like a walking animation on the world map. The visuals look good to me. altho i'd prefer a greater zoom distance, and a physical ""zoom in"" rather then a digital one. better yet a free camera, where you can change the zoom and angle as you like. Visuals 7/10 - not bad.

- Economy - Prices for selling items to vendors is a joke if they think those player market prices are normal. The dev tells a streamer: pumpkin pie! a rare food.... so rare it sells for 1, and the 5th club you got sells for 25. and the level of an item barely increases it's value at all, if at all. Economy 2/10 - A joke.

- Combat - interesting turn based combat. fun but overall lacking. not much variety in monster AI. You get a 10% bonus if you are flanking. 10% penelty when surrounded per mob. i'm not going to go into to much detail but, normal one on one vs a mob, takes 2 hits to kill. normal fight with 3 mobs while fully surrounded. still only takes 2 hits to kill. so it really doesn't matter to much. all classes have different skills, but unlike most ofthe MMOs, don't use your skills non-stop, i guess they are very situational, and you go to should just be your basic attack unless you need something else. Which to me just makes every class feel the same for the most part. Combat - 7/10 Not bad, could be better with AI imporvments.

- Crafting - I haven't touched too much on crafting, but, most of my chef recipies call for meat or fish. which calls for trapping, which can only have 1 out at a time at level 1. Which takes an hour to maybe catch one. which I slaughter for the meat. It just takes way to long to get some of the materials. Also crafting the level 1 recipie for boiled eggs give me 60 chef XP and takes 30 seconds.when i hit chef level 5 i went with the lvl 5 recipie for ball of dough which takes 3 mins to cook..... 20 xp.. thats broken. Crafting 4/10 - Needs Help

- Community - Well everyone's personality is different, so everyone will most likely be treated differently. but as for me. Many of the players and advisors seem to talk down to new players. sometimes helpful, but most seem annoyed to hear questions that i guess have been asked so many times. Yes i get it. it can be annoying. 
here's an example of an encounter I saw: 

New player: (advisor) what class are you and your alt? 
(advisor): Check the leaderboards.

Yea you go and tell the worthless new players about how you are so awesome you can't even answer a simples question.

but with all communities you have some good and some bad. Just sad to see the bad ones tend to be ""advisors"". but again not all advisors are bad. I try not to use names here but ""Drack"" is by far the best of the advisors, very helpful and friendly. so.. Community 4/10 - Ehh... I'd give it much higher if it wasn't for the bad advisors.

- Overall - 5/10 -


I fell like I could have enjoyed the game for much longer if I hadn't aleinated myself in the community by bringing up my issues, and then having them aired in front of everyone. I wanted to like this game. but I just don't feel welcome anymore, and all the work I put into my character feels like most of it's been wasted. I ended up throwing away mutpile stack of materials worth of time, work, and money in the game. because the old players think I should price my items just for them.

Can you make the game playable with Steam-log-on?

Frogdice  [developer]
No, because we have players who want to play using a non-steam client (some of them do not have steam at all), and we do not want multiple account/login systems.

As I replied there, I'll repeat it here:

So instead your players need a separate login for it, many people having to do something rather than one company. Makes sense... Not. 

It's silly to expect people to make a separate login when they're already logged in with Steam.

I absolutely recommend giving this game a go, but there are two major caveats.

First: [b]This game is out of Early Access, but functionally it is still a beta, rather than a completed game.[/b] The level cap is currently 30 (out of a planned 100), some of the higher-level skills are still unimplemented, and many features are still under construction. There are plenty of bugs, though none game-breaking. 

Second: [b]This game is different.[/b] Read the whole description on the Steam page. It is quite openly grindy. There is no Auction House (on purpose; don't bother asking for one). Mana recovery is via consumables only, unless you want to AFK in the inn. Mobs and player characters look and move like little pen-and-paper figurines, and movement and combat are on a square grid. Combat is turn-based. The list goes on; seriously, read the entire Steam page.

THAT SAID:

It's a charming game with a retro, tabletop feel, and a small, tight community. And most interestingly (for me), the devs are very active and very engaged with the community. We chat with them on a daily basis, both in-game and in the game's Discord. We discuss ideas and suggestions, give feedback on what we think is or isn't working, engage in general silliness, and occasionally get into heated exchanges regarding game design that go on for hours. 

Give it a shot. Participate in something growing, something a little different. And if you decide to leave, maybe pop back in again after a few weeks, or a few months.

It's a noble attempt, and it's got some interesting design ideas. But when it comes down to it, the game is miles wide and inches thick. It's a worthwhile time killer, but ultimately, I can't see myself devoting serious time into it. There are so many more rewarding games out there, and while you'll have to spend real money for most of them, it's usually worth it. 

My motto for F2P games: If it's worth playing, it's worth paying for (supporting the devs in some fashion). If it's not worth paying for, it's not worth playing. And at this time, I cannot see investing money into this game.

Edit, a few days later: I spent some time today chatting with one of the Devs, who disagreed with my characterization of the game being ""miles wide and inches thick."" He and I discussed the game at length, and we both agreed on a few points, particularly for the newbie experience, that needed some improvements. I gather that he made some changes to the game as a result of the discussion, in terms of reducing cost for early ""Upgrades."" I also spoke with the people in their Discord channel, about many of the same things, particularly the crafting experience. 

But even after all of that, I still stand by my point: The game has many different systems, but they're all fairly simple, not very deep, and not very complex. The biggest problems that you're likely to have are a lack of in-game instruction on how to do things, and running into artificial barriers, called ""Upgrades,"" requiring resources and money (in-game money, not real money - although they're VERY willing to let you use real money to sidestep these barriers) in order to advance, hindering your progress and requiring grind, grind, and more grind.

In its current state, this is going to be an extremely narrow niche game, and the odds of it matching much of the gaming audience is very low.

------------------------------------

TL;DR:
* Have friends? You all love grinding your passives like in Runescape? Try this game.
* Don't have friends or don't like grinding? Don't bother. Look at my total playtime (6.4h), i'm level 6.

------------------------------------

The game improved since last time i checked, i just came to realise that this is a niche game for a niche audience, and should not be rated bad just because i'm not part of that audience.

No real fun gameplay early on (specially if you play solo), you have too little skills available until level 6 or so.

...................................

[u]The concept of grinding in this game:[/u]

A: Hunting ground > fill inventory with loot.
B: Go back town (sell loot / get quests if you want to).
C: Hideout (personal warehouse and training your craft of choise).
A: Back to hunting grounds with an empty inventory to fill.
Then repeat for hours.

................................

[u]Some stuff i liked[/u]

+ Choose your crafting path (if you play in group, you can complement each other here)

+ Character creation (a bit of planning for the future, nothing huge like choosing stat distribution, just some interesting passives)

+ Character development (non-story-related), once you get to level 10 or so (might take a while) you can eat certain types of food to increase certain character stats in the long run.

+ I'm pretty sure the group endgame content for this game can be amazing later on, but oh lord knows i won't be grinding nearly that much.

+ [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/frogdice]The devs care a lot[/url], they are constantly listening to the community and doing their best to improve their vision for the game.

+ Quest are not mandatory. This is some fresh air for the huge amount recent themepark MMOs.

............................................

[u] Stuff you should know [/u]

* You would enjoy more this game if you payed less attention to the graphics and soundtrack.

* The inventory might fill a bit too quickly if you pick everything (who doesn't want to pick everything?). However, inventory slots can be grinded.

* The movement speed can feel pretty slow whenever you are going a bit too far from home.

* This game feels really niche. Made for people that love to grind, and love to play in group. If you don't like to grind or are a solo player, you'll just bore yourself to death by spending 5 hours to get into level 6 or 7.

* If you have people to play with, and you all love to grind and slowly improve your characters while sharing different passives for maximum efficiency, then you'll have a good time.

-------------------------------------------------

[h1]Below this point is an old personal view for this game, my first experience.[/h1]

[b]It is a bit outdated as of 1/13/2018. Still relevant for me, but not that much as an objective review.
I compared this game against other turn based MMOs like Atlantica Online and such.[/b]

-------------------------------------------------

Now, i'll tell you my story with this game.

I tried to like the game, so far the first few hours are a total and complete grindfest, mixed with a bit of traveling into town to sell loot you don't need.

You start with a very small inventory with an outrageous amount of ingame currency needed to expand it.

So after you kill four or five encounters, you'll need to go back to town, sell stuff, go to your hideout, stash crafting materials, and then go back to grind other four or five encounters until you need to go back to town again.
And i mean you NEED to go and sell things, because naturally you want to buy a bigger inventory to grind for longer.

The game uses turn based combat, yes, but it wasn't fun.
I do love turn based combat, I enjoyed a ton of King's Bounty (sega genesis and then Steam), FFT, Atlantica Online and such, however, this game was pretty basic.

Combat was all about spamming basic attack, one or two skills that only increase the damage you deal (no strategy needed for the early game is guess), and nothing more.
Maybe if the grind wasn't so hard in the early stages of the game then i could have endured a bit more until real strategy was needed.

All i had to my disposal was my basic attack (no pushes, no stuns, no debuffs, no use of the environment).
At least until level 10 or so, you might just be using your basic attack for the most part. Specially if you want to save up on healing items (mana included) because you want to buy that extra inventory.

I mentioned level 10, it doesn't sound that much of a grind tho, but I played it for 4 hours and only made it into level 5. Sadly i cannot endure boring gameplay for too long.

I have faith that endgame can be good, but if the early stages are THAT boring, then i just cannot recommend it unless you are a real fan of grinding.
I even beated the first boss, a rock golem. No strategy at all.

Attack > receive damage > attack > repeat.

The loot was pretty good tho.

By the way, grinding with turn based combat is not for everyone. You'll have so many delays to your grind (wait for each enemy turn, attack animations, encounter animation) you just can't do fast grind on these games. I mention fast grind because early game is way too boring to play it seriously.
It's specially slow if you don't want to go everywhere with a full inventory, and of course you don't want to, since the game is all about grinding and you need to buy that extra inventory slots to grind for longer without going back.

Higher level grinding areas are far away from town, you need a bigger inventory if you don't want to use most of your playtime walking (which again, isn't necessarily bad, but there is nothing to do while walking).",1509761229,1515891533,True,0,0,0.569752395153045654,4,False,False,False,False,,,

I think they are trying.  I just think they are falling a little short.  Below is a slightly long winded account of my first couple days in Stash that led me to my slightly reluctant negative.  If you care not for details and just want a quick summary, scroll your ADHD self down to the last 2 paragraphs.  I'm not moving it up here for you.  Hmph.  Kids these days...

So....I decided to become an enchanter.   
I bought an incantation table and tried to place it in my 'BOO'.  BOO being your player home.  Guess what?  You can't.
You can't place the incantaion table in your home until you level up your home because it has to go indoors and your home at this stage is a sleeping bag on the ground.
  
You need assorted quantities of half a dozen materials to level it up.  Game doesn't tell you where to find those materials.  You go to a vendor to buy some.  Guess what?  You can't.  
Vendors don't sell them.  You have to fight mobs for them.  Because everyone knows bats carry bricks.  Riiiight.
 
You finally manage to find what you need to level up your home to place the enchanting crafting furniture and you click on it to make your first enchantment!  Guess what?  You can't.  
You need Twinkling Dust to make your one beginning recipe.  Where do you find that?  Nothing tells you.  Vendors don't sell it, Monsters don't drop it, you can't farm nodes in the world map or dungeons for it.  You check the 'newspaper', which is what passes for a player market.  You search 17 pages to find it because there are no categories or search methods in the newspaper.  You find some.  10,000 Triads for 99 of them.  As a new player, you are making about 20 triads per battle.  So...500 battles.  Don't worry though, mobs drop a LOT of loot.  It sells for an average of about 8 triads per piece.  So lets say 300 battles to buy some Twinkling Dust.  I don't really mind that kind of grind.  Grind is part of the charm of a crafting flavored RPG.  What I mind is players trying to charge that damn much for it.  I won't reward people for that kind of self centered gluttony.  So you have to search a wiki because there is no mechanic to hover over a crafting requirement and get even a clue of where to attain anything.  The Wiki (which is so incomplete it doesn't even have a description of all the classes and covers nothing past level 5) says you get it by putting enchanted equipment in a disenchanter.  So I have to have enchanted equipment before I can make enchanted equipment?  Logic.

You go kill mobs until you finally get a piece of enchanted equipment.  I had had some before this but sold it out of necessity.  I didn't know I would need to keep stuff I can't equip.  Nothing indicated that.  SO I sold it because you are severely limited on storage and each upgrade you buy only gives you 1 additional space.  Have 19 spaces, buy upgrade, have 20 spaces.  Ridiculous.  Characters level up one level at a time.  Do they only gain 1 health?  No.  Storage should not be constrained to that either.  You don't buy a new closet for each shirt you own.  Logic. 

Next you have to buy a disenchanting station and place it in your home.  Guess what?  You can't.  
Turns out it has to be placed in your yard, not in your home.  Again, nothing at all points this out.

You finally figure this all out on your own (becuase some of us play RPG's for the game aspect and don't like having to use it as a giant chat room to figure out the basics of a system that should have at least some descriptions or hints).
You craft your first enchantment.  Only took 7.6 hours of stumbling through a very unintuitive crafting system.  You joyfully try to apply it to a piece of your mob-loot equipment.  Guess what? You can't. 
It can only be applied to player crafted equipment.
  
So you have to go back and learn how to craft weapons and armor so you can use your sparkly new enchantment.  Guess what?  You can't.
Unless you pay premium currency, you can't learn more than 1 skill.

Now I won't say I don't like the game.  I just don't like where it is at.  It is needlessly vague and cumbersome for no other purpose than seeming to want to force people into seeking help at every turn.  Yes, I do realize it is a multiplayer game.   I  do not, however, see that as a valid reason to force players to 'chat' or get lost.  I don't play RPG's to make new friends, and even the old players get sick of answering the same questions over and over for every new player that wasn't online 10 minutes ago when the last new player asked the same question.  So instead they get pissy, snappish or offer to 'help' the new player by selling them what they need at grossly inflated prices.  Loupe costs 10t from the ONE vendor that isn't selling food.  They'll sell it to you for 1000t. Out of the kindness of their hearts, of course.

I see the course the game is on as being a short road to an obscure ghost town.  That could easily change.  The game has a certain charm.   But when you try to force people in to being friends in order to get what they need, it's going to bite you in the aft-end.  It makes this feel more like a Facebook game than an RPG.  Need a sword?  Invite 12 friends!  No thanks.

Please, allow people to learn multiple crafts without paying for it, put a search function on the newspaper, and add at least a short description of recipe and crafting components on mouse-overs, and it would help the game tremendously.  In the first hour I played this my son said ""That looks cool"" and he downloaded it.  By hour 7 he said ""I'll just uninstall it, it doesn't look like it's worth it to me.""  And that is kind of how it feels at this point.  Not worth the time.

So in the end I have to give the game a thumbs down.  Not for the camera angle, graphics, or gender locked races, but for the ununtuitive slog that the crafting is presented as and the immediate need for a premium purchase in order to succeed in that crafting as a solo player.  If that is not the kind of thing that gets under your skin, or if you have a few friends to dungeoneer with that you can pool your crafting talents in with, please, give the game a try.  It is geared towards groups or friends and would probably be immensely more fun with cooperation.  For for a wizened old hermit like myself, it felt punishing rather than fun and I can't recommend that in good faith to other wizened old hermits.

Frogdice, please keep up the updates, take some of the criticisms of myself and other players into consideration, and make a few tweaks to this dusty jewel.  You really could have a gem on your hands.  I would be more willing to make premium purchases from a developer like you who has actively kept up with and loved their game, if I felt there was a future for the game.

The game is great. Levels feel like they mean something further into the game, crafters aren't overshadowed by dungeon/mob drops. They have value. The potions, armor, and weapons they make are better than any random drop you get. But not everyone can afford crafted gear, so the dungeon drops aren't worthless by any means.

The crafting can be a bit tedious, since you're locked to one crafting profession unless you make another character to help craft or use their paid currency to unlock another crafting slot. And that might scare players away thinking the game is p2w since you can unlock more of your character than others by paying money. It's not.

Now I won't say this game's cash shop is irrelevant cosmetics, it has things that make the things a LOT more convenient. Namely inventory space. This game uses a Bag/bag size inventory system, and you can use their paid currency to get better/bigger bags and unlock bag slots. But you can also do that with the ingame currency called triads (just like gold).

There are mounts, just not visibly shown. The game shows your character more like a Figure than a living character. The mounts grant movement speed, like they would in any other game, and can be bought with both paid currency and ingame currency. But the price/effort between those two is incomparable. 

And it becomes very apparent when someone has a mount and you don't, and you're both heading to a resource node. And with the bag space, more inventory means less time running back to town to sell and put items in your stash. WIth that said, you can find resource nodes when you engage in a fight.

The fighting system is really what hooks me to this game. It's grid based combat, so you have limited movement area as well as ability range. But that's where the combat mechanics come in to have you plan out your next move carefully. For the battle mechanics, there are elemental attacks and mobs with weaknesses/resistences against those. Without a beastiary or monster journal, you just have to go through trial and error or ask in global chat. Lastly, the battle mechanics I enjoy so much is the monster/player placement. You can be surrounded, pinned, and flanked. You can do these to the mobs as well (surrounded and flanked require a party member) and it makes for a much more engaging fight since these effects place a debuff on whoever is affected by it.

This game also features player housing and I won't sugar coat it. It's very, very tedious to manage it. There are multiple materials needed to upgrade the size of your base, increase how many items you can list on the auction house (which is accessable globally, really nice), how many items your stash can hold, and how many crafting tools you can place. When I say crafting tools, I mean like an alchemists table or a weaponsmiths anvil. There's also farming, but I haven't gotten into that since my current profession doesn't need it. 

All in all, this is a great game. It needs work and clarity on some mechanics, but the dev's are VERY active with the community. They have a discord server and always talk to their playerbase.

Their passion and vision are evident in so many elements of the game. They clearly set out to create something missing from the MMO genre and they succeeded.

The main game elements are turn based combat, crafting, developing your house (called your BOO or Base of Operations), and social structures (clans, parties, and apparently religions too in the future).

They really nailed the combat. It is fun, challenging without being punishing, and as I gain levels I can see more complexity being added. 

Crafting is done very well and is more interesting than just clicking a recipe and getting an item. There are multiple steps involved in gathering and refining resources, especially crafts that involve farming (for food or leather). I have not messed around with the market much but it looks like you could be a full time merchant also.

Your house is really incredible. It is almost like a full Sims game here. I have only scratched the surface but it is already very cool.

Social structures like clans and parties are clearly a big part of the game, but again I have only dipped my toe here.

Now I need to specifically call out the community which is incredible. This is something really missing from most online games. Too many games these days have toxic communities and the devs done care. But the Stash developers have very clearly put an emphasis here and it shows.

Speaking of the Stash developers, they are very active in game and on the game's discord. Yet again they show how much they care about this game and its community by being directly involved.

I highly recommend this game and hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

As a fan of tabletop RPGs and video game RPGs, this is a fantastic blend of both. It has a lot of the features that you find in your AAA title MMORPGs; crafting, clans, etc. all wrapped up in a turn based combat environment. It doesn't hold your hand or babysit you, you have to think for yourself, read things, and learn some of the more complex game mechanics as you play.

You get to make up your own story as you go, or not if you just want a mindless grindfest with clan mates. It doesn't give you a tutorial, just a text manual that takes minutes to read, and player written guides are available for more detailed information. It's fun and highly addictive, and to top it off an amazing community (ironic, considering most MMORPGs, I avoid the community like the plague).

- Although some people may see this a downside or inconvenience, there are certain aspects of the game such as the auction house (newspaper) that are purposely implemented in a way that values player interaction more than most other MMOs.  I see this is a good thing because, like any game, it is important to build strong relationships with other players.
- The game gets updated and patched frequently.  Stash is a relatively new game so balancing every class and role can be a bit difficult.  Luckily, the developer is always looking into character imbalances to help form a more solid experience.

Progression is very slow; the death penalty can work out to a half hour of play even at low levels, so you need to stick to ""safe"", low-reward fights (the ""yellow"" fights are the ""step above"" you, but if they roll four enemies you might have bit off more than you can chew).

Pro
Lot class and job and spell
Lot Random item with stats.
Good drop rate.
Simple and complete chat
Need check last update seem good

Con
Very Little starting storage that get full fast. seriously only 1 shared slot.(or premium upgrade)
and 20 for personnal upgradable with loot or premium 
Poor presentation and quest.
No intuitive crating system setup. (it easier when all set)
Little stuggle with the camera and flat mode don't low great.
Poor npc store collection (except food starting job tool) or i miss some?
Poor moving animation
Poor status impact effect with not info.
Slow level up

5.5/10 not beginner friendly but nice community
basic turn based combat with unintuitive crating system and poor starting storage.
If you like that genre and patient maybe give it a try.

Long 
First you need 
make account from outside but it easy and basic 

About the game it
Slow tactic casual turn based and crafting option and some random equipment.
The fight kinda casual but not that bad but i didn't see deep stragety yet.
I wish i saw some elemental weakness or resistance. didn't seem
And didn't notice affected status effect or it pretty low.   
(well it only the start)
 
But the major problem
Is the confusing presentation crafting and stuggle with storage.
With lot grinding slowly increase it.

There a lot random item for job that will fill your inventory
Better not be a rat pack and learn fast what to keep and not.
item upgrade for totally random but not really rare.

I don't like how the machine is a addon and take even more storage.
You need the right tool equiped to collect ressource that can appear at random. 
Overworld you can see the ressource node and equip it before enter.

There equipement you can't equip but i don't know why maybe race or class. (they tell for level)

The combat seem pretty basic tactic turn based i didn't like it much.
i prefer that genre with multi characters and combo.
Nothing fancy except surround enemy buff and annoying corpse that rot fast. 
some are skinnable for leather but barely last few round


My only 3hr show someone didn't hook and maybe i miss later content.

Camera controls need more refinement, cant set the camera position as low as I would like. The sliding static figures seem a bit lazy and out of place. I get it that its kinda a reference to old table top games but it needs to feel smoother and more animated. Grid-based movement and turn-based combat are nice in an MMO, I appreciate the strategy elements. Just didnt keep my interest past 30 min or so. Not engaging for a seasoned gamer looking for a different MMO. Gotta say I appreciate the devs doing something new but it still feels kinda cookie cutter in presentation and customisation. Be more daring! Tired of the same warrior/rogue/mage/healer go to a dungeon format of game.

Frog Dice is actively adding content every patch, which are frequent, and someone from Frog Dice is often logged directly in the game.

Overall:  This is a game with lots of potential that I am already enjoying. 

Pros:
This is a game where you will build your character up.  Leveling doesn't give you much.  You need to find better equipment, and most of what you will want will be crafted, either by yourself or from someone else, or will be obtained from loot drops.  

Very much a player-based economy.  Players have easy access to a global market place, so there are few barriers to players selling what they craft.  

Turn-based combat.  I like this a lot.  I prefer strategizing to twitch-based shooting.  

No hand-holding.  Pro or Con depending on your likes.

Devs are online a lot, and there is even a Discord VOIP channel.

Con:
Very little instructions or guides.  You will find yourself asking in global chat how to do things.  Fortunately, the community and the devs are very responsive.  There is a wiki, that is being grown.

Small community.  It's definitely growing, but still small.  This is to be expected considering this is a small company without a big name like EA or Bethesda.

The negative reviews of this game with 1 Liners from kids with less then 1 hour played are hilarious, but please see them for what they are, COMEDY, not actual relevant opinion.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW:
This game is Grindy, on purpose, it is not a game where they expect you to be max lvl in a matter of days, crafting and experiance take time.

This game does not have a tutorial and hand holding, you are meant to go explore out of the gates and learn about how things work, that being said there is a ""help"" section in the menu which will explain a few key details to help you figure those things out, as well as a player made guide on how to get going in STASH, and a great Community to help in game (but please do a bit of looking/reading ingame yourself before logging in and blindly spamming ""HOW TO PLAY?"").

This game doesnt currently have a ""Hardcore"" mode, but at higher levels DEATH is punishable with xp debt, which is not a huge deal =D but if your expecting a glass cannon yolo game with no consiquences this might not be for you.

    Stash wont be for everybody, but if youre a fan of a Long term friendly community, D&D, FF tactics, and tons of Favorite games from the 90s this game will hit home with you.

The crafting system seems to be pretty indepth which is a huge plus to me. There are six different crafting classes, and the game encourages people to specialize in one (though if you want to spend money on premium coins you can unlock more crafting class slots) and the crafting gear seems to be superior than most things I've found while exploring.

A nice feature is the housing system, where you build up your production capacity, and which also functions as your player market where you can sell your crafted or looted goods.

Kill the mobs is the only way you'll get anything in this game.  That's not too terrible...but there's isn't a very accurate gauge of what you're getting into when you ingage a mob fight.

There's only one city from the looks of it..and your house appears to only be accessible near it.  which means journeying far for anything becomes realy tiresome as you constantly have to return to these tow locations to craft and sell.

I like the game, it really let you improve something all the time.
But you have to plan and do something, the game is not for the ""i want all without effort"" people.

You start it and then a few hours are over real quick.

And you can play it good solo without always searching for a group.
It reminds me a lot of the beginning of world of warcraft. Not the actual WOW at which you are bored because you get everything with only 3 buttons mashing, i mean the old one at which you have to invest time, skill and dedication.

And the community is extremly good, no ranting or trolls. Always is someone helping with questions, not like other MMO at which you have to browse first a lot of web sites if you have a question.

deutsch:

I mag das Spiel, immer hat man eine Verbesserung erreicht, es ist schön das man laufend immer einen Anreiz hat.
Aber man muss auch was dafür tun, nicht einfach nur mal nebenbei einloggen und schon alles ohne Aufwand bekommen.

Auch startet man das Spiel nur mal kurz und schon sind ein paar Stunden vergangen ohne das man es richtig bemerkt wie lange man schon spielt.

Ebenso kann man es auch gut alleine spielen, man muss nicht die ganze Zeit nach einer Gruppe suchen. Das ist ein großes Plus, da man ja Spass haben will und nicht nur irgendwo in einer Stadt rumstehen will um irgendwann einmal Spass zu haben.
Erinnert mich stark an die Anfangszeiten von World of Warcraft. Nicht wie jetzt wo man alles nachgeworfen bekommt ohne das man was tun muss. Am meisten Spass macht es ja wenn man etwas erreicht hat auf das man hingearbeitet hat.
Nicht einfach 3 Tasten drücken und ohne Aufwand alles automatisch bekommen.

Die Community hat mich auch sehr stark überrascht. Normal wimmelt es bei MMO ja von Trollen und Leuten die einfach nur ärgern oder sich wichtig machen wollen.
Hier aber nicht, man kann Fragen stellen ohne gleich als Noob beschimpft zu werden.

Unfortunately, in it's current state all I can describe it as is painful. Let's list the issues:

-Painful to figure out
It gives an ok combat tutorial and points out a few things. That's it. Hope you like randomly clicking on stuff in the hopes you can figure out what it does. I couldn't even figure out how to heal, or exit a dungeon at first.

-Painful to read
Holy tiny font, batman. Seriously, the miniscule font size on this game gives me a migraine. The game even supports resolutions too small to actually read the game text at all.

-Painful to move
Like watching your character slowly inch square by square like a lazy chess piece? I hope you do because it's all you'll be watching.

-Painful to craft
I made a Hunter/Farmer, so the sensible crafting profession was Chef. Bad choice. I placed a baited trap and stared at it for a while, nothing. I dungeon crawled and got 2 sacks of flour, came back to no bait and an empty trap. I looked at the newspaper and found ingredients going for 1,000s of triads apiece. I have a grand total of 650. Crafting is currently for the rich and overleveled so what about combat?

-Painful to level
The combat is flawed, like when you click slightly off the monster occupied square so the game completely deselects your skill, but it's not horrible. What is painful is the amount of grind needed to get anything worthwhile is only made more painful by the fact that you will be fighting the same things in the same dungeons over and over and over. Also the loot that you pick up? Most will be vendor fodder but the bit that is sellable?

-Painful to buy or sell on auction -err- newspaper
There's no auction house, which I appreciate, but in its place is a bulky ""newspaper"" that lists highlighted items being hawked by players. Not a bad idea until you realize there's no easy way to find what you need and once you do find it, it will be so far out of your price range it won't matter. Perhaps you want to sell? Well the game will give you a small ""cart"" to start as well as give you the starting price for your items. Unfortunately, this price will be far below the current going price amd there's no good way of figuring out the going price.

Painfully dull
- There's no reason given for your existence. You are plopped into the world and ignored. No mythos,  no story, no destiny, no one cares. It all feels like a board game without the fun of a free night spent with your friends. If I want to do hard, boring work for little gain and no recognition I'll go to my job. I play games for an escape, not more punishment.

So, yeah. I plan on trying it out a bit more for old time's sake. Maybe it will grow on me or maybe an update will make it better, but I can't say this game is fun, because it's not, it's painful.

Movement: mounts are a character progression element that makes you move a lot faster.

Crafting: hmmm perhaps check the crafting sections of the guide? Your experience is unusual and atypical. 

Grind: Not sure what to tell you. We set out to make a challenging game that is not a rush to end game. I don't think design choices are really things to ding a game for. I consider that the equivalent of a Mexican restaurant not serving pasta. It is a stylistic choice. 

Newspaper: Our market is designed to help you find merchants more so than specific products, so full merchant gameplay is possible. That said, we are constantly rolling out enhancements to the newspaper to make it more useful and fun to hunt for deals.

(And technically uncapped as there's some sort of infinite post-cap leveling system.)  Woo?  I've heard from chatter in chat that it takes ~100 hours to hit level 15.  Yes, 15.  I've also managed to level my base once, once of my gathering skills once, and my crafting?  Nada.  On top of this, there's backwards progression in the form of XP debt, which I saw someone commented can set you back by DAYS of grinding.  And also on crafting:  I logged in before this review to double check some things and my plants and animals for getting crafting mats had died since I last logged on and took all their drops with them.  

Woo.

Some of their patches are helping it, like a recent one which explains what low level Elementalist skills actually do besides damage, but this game is way too convoluted to have so little explanations.  Wouldn't have bothered with cooking had I known ahead of time I'd be sinking tons of cash for little gain

Speaking of, the economy sucks, plain and simple.  If its not evident yet, this game is a super hardcore grinder.  And the newsaper (which is merely a really inconveniently designed auction house, all in the name of economy, despite how hard the devs will argue its not and will launch tirades about how auction houses are the worst possible thing to ever exist in a MMO) is dominated by super hardcore players mostly charging super hardcore prices for items.  Not that they're making items for my level anyway, and the few bits of junk around my level are simply racing to the bottom of the price and are merely dropped loot (crafted stuff is always better in this game.)  Why?  People are hoarding all the crafting goods and vendor trashing most everything they don't need.  And the developers are making it a pain in the ass for both buyers and sellers to get their goods to each other all in the name of it being better for the economy.

There's... also some other weird decisions done by the devs.  Healing, for example, is super freaking frustrating.  Your only free option is to go back to town and AFK for about ten minutes in the inn, because there's no other source of out of combat healing and its extremely slow to encourage you to spend money.  You can buy camp materials to make a camp anywhere and then AFK and do something more fun in the mean time on the go.  Or you can buy food and potions and fill up your extremely limited inventory space with food items.  I saw a dev comment they did this so cooks would actually have a place in the economy.  But, food raises stats and supposedly does other things too later, so... shouldn't that be the draw?  Except dedicated players are claiming to have already maxed their stats, oops.  And lowbies like me can't even raise their stats yet, so double oops.  And cooking takes an investment of thousands of triads (I'm not mixing up my in-game and premium currency terms, am I?) to even get going for a modest gain, leaving me, a cook, to decide between spending money on stuff to heal and slowing down my crafting progression or spending money so I can craft to heal, maybe make a profit in the future, and be forced to AFK for hours in the mean time.  >.<   So cooks are getting shafted economically from the get go as far as I can tell.  Of course, you can alleviate this by bringing a pocket healer, but they still need food for mana and, since they can't heal out of combat, except to be doing silly things like leaving one monster alive just to heal.  

Okay, so, tangent on healing aside, grouping is weird.  Group members don't participate in the same things unless they ""stack"" on the group leader and then auto-follow them into combat.  As such, in between stuff, it is their job to take their hands off the controls and wait for the next fight or gathering node or whatever since, if someone starts a fight without them, they cannot participate in that fight.  Ever.  There also appears to be no Round Robin looting, meaning you're going to have to trust someone to actually share stuff, whether it be your leader or other party members.  

Also also, movement itself.  Its slooooooooooow.  And the maps are not designed well.  Like, in town, I started at the entrance and took a stop watch and timed my trek to the farthest merchant NPCs.  it took a full minute, moving optimally, to get there.  Why is this designed like that?  And why are their no walking animations?  It looks really weird and bugs me.  Why is there a separate move command in combat when you have to move before attacking if you want to, why can't I just click like out of combat?  Why do my movement commands randomly cancel, even after the patch that was supposed to fix it?  And why do cat folk use stock wild cat sounds from the 80s that are so out of place?

*deep breath*

...okay, this review went a lot longer than I planned.  And a bit ranty.  But, this game has a lot of problems and really only caters to an extreme niche crowd.  And the developers, while super friendly and seem to be in the actual game interacting with the community often, I feel that they seem to have their heads firmly stuck in the clouds as well about their vision for the game and are missing the reality.  (Yes, the article you love to link to says the auction house was bad for Star Wars Galaxies, which is why you opted against a functional one, but did you read the full article and see where it says auction houses aren't bad for all games?  Not saying you should go the auction house route here, if you're actually reading this, but still.)  So, I can't recommend it and I don't really see myself coming back to it unless there's some really massive changes that make it friendly for more casual play, since I really don't need a MMO to hardcore sink my life into right now.  

So bottomline:  I don't recommend it unless you're the very tiny minority this game caters to.  But its free, so try it yourself if you want as it'll only cost you time and bandwidth.",1506568014,1506568132,False,7,0,0.539542138576507568,9,False,False,False,False,,,

But so far the gameplay, The housing system and  basically everything about it brings me personally back to a time when things were less serious and for now I'm hooked.

I'm sorry for the short review as I will be editing it as It progress's Dont let this one slip buy you.

I personally got the founders pack to help the developers along with the progress of this game but it is in now way needed as it's all purely cosmetic.       Which makes me happy I will be using the Cloak that you can use till level 20 for the experience boost that comes with it but for me it's really about just supporting the game's progress.

There are a few problems here, one is with the moderation, which I won't even go into for this game, but mostly for me, my complaint is with the broken grouping system, which if you're grouped with people, if said player leaves the battle in the middle of the match, you'll have to kill yourself to escape from the match, which, depending on your level will cost you a day or two of gameplay, or maybe if you're early game just a few hours of your life.

Play at your own leisure. I will not be coming back, not after how I was treated here, goodbye.

I was informed this wasn't the official release, which it is; this isn't an alpha, which people claim it's still in alpha, but it's an official release, and it has game-breaking-bugs in it like this which spoil the fun which is paper-thin to be exact, which are mostly just time synches.

I only lost about 3k experience from the bug, but in a group game, on an official launch, I thought I would be playing something fun, which wasn't broken and flawed.

I've only been playing games since 1985 or so, so don't take my word for it.

Someone didn't like my review so I've edited a few things and added this, just to keep up with the haters at large on these issues about gaming within Stash:

Stash is fun when it's not bugging out. The group system since I've gone back on my word and put in about twenty-five more hours into the game over the last day, is a decent experience overall, like I said, when it's not bugging out, which it will do. The game's experience-pen is avoidable by crashing the game at desktop, which it troubles me as to why the dev has the exp-pen in there in the first place if they can't get it to work properly, along with the turn-based system in place much like in many other tactics games on the market. The game literally can get stuck if a player leaves mid-battle on their turn, and the rest of the group can either; if they know the secret desktop crash or not; go crash the game, or they can opt to press esc, killing themselves off at will, which gives at least 3-4k exp-pen early in the game, from levels 1-10.

They're updating and I'll continue to follow progress. As an early Everquest living legend player, I'll be keeping an eye out on this one, it does hold some of my interest just because I can't stop laughing at it, and it's a good time, just because, the game is so basic in concept, at this time, it's fun to just grind away at it and its rare loot chances, but there are many problems here, too many to mention in this space alone, and like I said in my original review of the game, the game is flawed in a lot of areas still.

As I escape this review I will leave one final example of how limited and flawed Stash really is.

I'm level 10 almost level 11 now, more than 65 percent of my way to level by now, and will so be level 11 within a day or two, and as I type this, there is one dungeon as a solo player which is a level 10 area and scales up, 10-15, but after you clear it, there are really no dungeons, and the ones you find literally anywhere on the world map which are random appear in four locations, one to the north, east, south, and west, which are all on long timers. If you're a fast player like myself and love to clear dungeons for loot, you'll be bogged down by the wait times.

You can find a group. I'm in a guild in the game and do play with friends, but like I said, the bugs in this game wear me out. If you recruit a five man team, you deal with bugs within the battle grounds, so you're stuck with four or six member teams mostly due to this inconvenience. I've put the hours into Stash and these are my findings. Play at your own risk. The game literally has no exp-pen if you crash at desktop, which is laughable as a hardcore EverQuest veteran.

Added 9/29/2017, a note:

To conclude my review of Stash I will say this much, the game is broken as a soloist in its current form, I'll also add that the group game is also a broken mess; early version of game or not, after trying to solo and group in this game, it's not possible for progression at a reasonable enough level for a player such as myself to make a donation, good luck; I've quit playing the game.

First of all yes there is a lack of different cities and only some dungeon types. But, what's the deal with that? Haven't figured out yet.
      -The characters are limited to one profession only, unless you spend real life money to unlock a slot.-
Yes, but you can still buy it for in-game money to a seller i think, the price is up to the seller but it still will have its price balanced
     -If you want to change a profession you forgot and lose all your progress on the one you alreadry learned.
Yes, as every other mmo like wow...
     -New characters fill up on mostly trash junk and have to run back to town every 5 to 10 minutes..
Then just dont pick the junk... It's a quick way to get some money but not the best. Just pick the stuff u need and save some space for the food sold in town so you can run more time and get more triads on your way.
     -You have to eat food to raise your stats.
Really???
Leveling up does nothing for you.
Yes it does. More HP, more MP, but dmg and resist is very influenced by gear and buffs. And u get it really often from drops depending on enemie level. If u want some lvl 8 armor fight enemies lvl 8 and eventually you will get some
     -No NPC merchants to buy gear from except food.
Everything is player made and the only thing players buy is max gear and max recipes to make max gear.
Such a great way to encourage people to learn some different crafts instead of just running dungeons braindead. Some of them can make pots, other ones lke me can make food, other ones make the tools needed for all crafts... Not a downpoint imo.
     -I did not like the fact that only one player at a time can harvest a resource, ore, wood etc.
Same thing goes with the encounters on the map unless you are in a team.
Wrong, you can carry all the gathering tools and collect everything, but yu have to switch one of the two you have equipped to be able to gather it.

I played a healer and even though there's an out of combat action bar, you can't actually heal outside of combat. That bar is only available if you're in the inn (where you regenerate health/mana), your house area, or a resource node. None of those really help when in a dungeon, so most effecient healing is actually to kill all but 1 mob, then just spend turns healing up the party while everyone else passes. 

Player economy is very cumbersome. There are player stalls to sell things, but there is no way to search all the stalls for a specific item or even pull up a specific players stall. There is a newspaper that advertises items, and you have to click through every item to visit that particular store to see if they have what you want.

Description of crafts/abilties/debuffs are lacking. The elementalist can ""shock"" something, but there is no description what that actually does. Some enemies ""mezzed"" me, but mousing over that icon doesn't actually tell you what that does. Biggest complaint would be for crafting, I picked up enchanting. Only to find out I have to place the enchanting table indoors, so I had to upgrade my house area to level 2 to get an indoors slot. I finally make an enchantment and you can only use it on other crafted goods. None of this was explained in the description for learning enchanting.

Stash is the first game I have EVER kickstarted and I do not regret that decision for a second.  Is this game gonna be for everyone? No.  It is a much slower paced, laid back game with more of a focus on grouping and community than the majority of MMO's you see these days.  Is it a grind? yes. But I feel that makes gaining that next level in a craft or class that much more rewarding.  While I realize that kinda of view isn't shared by all I personally enjoy it.

As for the community in the game.  It is one of the most helpful and welcoming ones I have been a part of in a long time.  It reminds me back when a lot of MMO's were new and fresh and players worked together and helped each other instead of mocking and belittling for asking questions.  Most asks in help are replied to in about 30 seconds and usually by multiple players.  Also the Devs are among the most active I have ever seen in a game. They are on EVERY day and constantly talking to players about balance issues, suggestions to game changes and actively seeking to find and fix bugs as quickly as possible for their small team.   It is a refreshing change of pace to see a team actually CARE about the game once it is released and are so passionate about their creation.  

The graphics may not be the prettiest and it may not be fast paced but I feel Stash is a unique gem to those that actually care to examine it for awhile.  If you prefer Tactics style combat with a bit of depth and a community that is enjoyable instead of toxic, I would invite you to give Stash a try.  I'm glad I did :)

Don't take my low hours for granted, it doesn't take longer than an hour or hopping into this game to realize what a gem it is. With an intuitive, unique ""tutorial"" system that lets you learn at your own pace, I found myself playing a turn-based game in ways I never thought I would!

Combat mechanics that other turn-based games strive for, Stash sets the bar for future turn-based games in many ways. A unique positioning system, aggro, buffs, debuffs, multiple phases to a turn... This game has it all!

The game boasts a modest amount of character customization, even equip with a slider to fine-tune your hero, you have full control over how your character looks. Make them beautiful or... not so much.

The game does have microtransactions, but don't let that dissuade you, everything you can buy with real money you can earn in-game as well, the only except being a few cosmetic ""transmogs"".

Flaws:Terribly done movement between areas, lack of character creation hairstyles, an awkward ""awesome"" when you upgrade something in your Base Of Operations (BOO), loot drops are too generous, dyrads for being considered another race (Its just a female human with another name on it, i don't get it), etc. (And this is from a first impressions standpoint, there are alot more there too, but movement in general is my biggest problem, it feels too annoying to do.)


Pros:Community isn't terrible, heritage and an active community (I couldn't think of other pros, somehow.)


Before you complain, this is from almost 2 hours of gameplay, and when there is nothing to pull you in to the gameplay, then whats the point of playing if you don't enjoy it?


I'd call this game an... aquired taste for some people to be honest, it isn't that good, and i'd doubt it'd be something i'd want to play again, but some people may like it i guess.

It being F2P, and costs nothing, you get a bucket of Fun for nuthin!

The scope is not too wide, options not too deep. Yet the path is yours to carve out as there is very little hand holding. The DEVs are highly responsive and engaged with the community, practically attached at the hip at this point. They crave player input and suggestions. You will see them every day talking to players.

The classes, professions and skills all seem well thought out. Leveling a character is only as much a focus as you make it. Working on Professions and Skills is seperate. You may get to use Gathering Skills while Adventuring, however it's not needed or expected. Wandering the world hunting for resources is its own fun and you get more faster if your focus is that over killing monsters and Dungeon Crawling.

Loot is wide and varied, perhapse a little too varied. However you can sell the bits you dont want or Need on your personal Store Stall. Like the EQ Bazzar environments without the Lag and Overcrowding. With the player community growing and being very active there is plenty of opportunity to trade and help each other advance goals.

The community is outstanding and genrally interested everyone's needs and skill levels. Help is but a chat away on any number of things, game or real life related. There is low tollerance for unsocial behaviors in open view. The few instances of Trollishness and Disrespect are met with a tidal wave of resistance to that kind of behavior. The game is very Family Firendly! If I had young children coming of age to get online, I would support them playing this as their First MMO, without constant supervision. Then feeling completely comfortable playing with them at any time and having a blast.

The Development looks like it will be ongoing for some time. The game is very well presented as is but the projections on future features is very impressive. My personal 'Brass Ring' will be in future inclusion of Pub Games, such as Darts, Cards and Dice games. The Dev's need your input on many future design concepts.

Basically, when you start in this world, you get hit by a welcome screen that asks you to read the general info. Having done that, you are given info about combat, dungeons, the town and your BOO(Base of operation) as you reach those stages. All in all, it gives you the basic info to thrive and learn - and learn you should do. It's not a steep learning curve, but it does require thought, trial and error. If you struggle, luck would have it that devs are active A LOT so big plus to them - but most importantly - the somewhat mature playerbase, are ready to help. 
Game is quite active, chat is always going - and one of the best things I've seen is a) you can do important stuff from lvl 1 and b) devs listen to the players.

If you miss the good old days of adventuring and taking things in your own pace, this turn based combat and social interaction MMO might just be for you. It's not a pay to win but a pay what you want - i'd say 99% of items in game can be had without paying... 

There's an interactive market where you can sell your stuff to other players - and even level 1 stuff will be useful to someone - it's a real price-demand market. 

It's been a long time since I've had this much fun in a multiplayer game - no fast combat - no big flashy numbers - just relaxing and fun. For what's implemented so far, I'm having a blast. 

TL;DR - try it out, give it a few hours to get the hang of things and don't forget to say hi in chat. Maybe even try out a group dungeon crawl. It's fun, it's free and it's addictive ... :)",1505746055,1505746055,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,,,

 i was planning on fighting back but i swear they had a banhammer up their sleeve for me.
what i was talking about? letting people lower prices.

what the economy needs is TO BE CHEAPER.
i wouldn't care if the max they could go below price is 50%, i would prefer that, YOU'D GET A FUCKING GOOD DEAL INSTEAD OF THE CASTLE GROUNDS! but of course, the devs were agressive to say the least about the idea of cheaper minimum prices.

i signed up for their emails and today i got another saying things that brought me back. little did i know, they hardlocked the economy. into an inflation spiral.

(Annoyances purposely designed into the game with the only way to overcome them done so through buying gems)
A pleasurable experience will cost you several hundred dollars as a minimum.

Update to address comments:
I couldn't agree more Do_Be...

As for for the developer, I understand this is personal for you. I can only imagine. As such please know I understand and respect your passion for your creation. I must respectively state that while I understand and appreciate your free to play model, I believe you have been a little too aggressive with the purchased ""conveniences"".

As for ""examples of purposely designed annoyances"":
1.) Shared stash is one slot and can only be expanded by spending real life money.
     a.) In my opinion this is a purposely designed annoyance meant to force the players into purchasing gems to counter this.
     b.) Again, this would be manageable if it were a little more reasonable. 1 slot is too few. Show the players you have good intentions and they will reciprocate in making purchases.
2.) There are 6 crafting types but a character can only learn one. All knowledge is lost when switching.
     a.) Only way to expand crafting slots is by using real life money.
     b.) This would be manageable if the shared bank/stash was reasonable. (See #1 above)
3.) Players can't change harvesting tools in combat.
     a.) I can't comprehend why this would be designed this way. This isn't enjoyable at all. Nor is requiring us to equip the specific tool in order to perform the harvest action. Again ""in my opinion"" this should be redesigned to make the experience enjoyable for players. As it stands now, it's just another annoyance without any perceivable reason (that I can see anyway).

I still stand by my opening statement. This game has so much potential to be a great game. I'm perfectly fine with the typical free to play model and I have a history of supporting developers by making real life currency purchases. (I've spent thousands within individual games)
I believe it would be far more enticing if the limitations put in place to promote purchases were rebalanced.",1505350080,1505449555,False,12,0,0.559247314929962158,11,False,False,False,False,,,

Its not exactly a bad game.
Simple mechanics of four races, several classes and stats to strive in.
Camping for materials to work on crafts as the game titles implies.
Much consideration on what trade to pursue and invest your loots in,
setting up shop for your products and even decorating on your plot of land.

Social and economic tradings are much necessary in the long run,
really need few like-minded friends to constant party with and contribute to a cause.


BUT

Lags, Stutter, Slow and Inconsistent pathing of your character,
is the biggest setback of the game.
Taking a few step, you might stall for a bit to few seconds, or even lagged backwards to one of your previous steps.
Crowded locations where others are also heavily camping for the kills,
the lags only get worst.

Ingame purchases of the medallion are costly and only through the main website with a vague fillin the credit form.
Package DLC in Steam Store are pricely for its mere usefulness, 
would be more efficient to list medalion packs for sale through steam or simply click in game and paying through Steam.
Expansions for skill slots is gonna cost you, or fall behind the others.

A Grind with friends.

Stash is an mmorpg that transfers the aesthetics of a tabletop rpg into a mmorpg setting, through looks and some mechanics. i found it enjoyable and recommend it, however it needs work to live up to its' potential and get where it wants to be.

Starting out youll be creating a character with the overly familiar 4 classes (mage, cleric, warrior and hunter), a choice of 4 races (which affect your early game more than they affect the higher levels, by the looks of things) some cosmetic stuff in form of your character's look, heritage and  your figurine's pose.

the game world acts similar to old tabletop rpg's, having player characters and interactions(dungeons, monsters, resources etc') marked with figurines, and movement being tile based. many mechanics involve rng, allowing for ""fails"" in movement where you encounter ambushes or your crafts end up a disaster (and the obvious rng loot). 
combat is turn-based, and features an interesting flank-surround-pin mechanic where positioning can mean a lot for your success in a fight, bringing disadvantages or benefits depending on coordination between teammates. outside of this it is very basic and most of your solo fights will be trading blows with npcs and montsers until something dies.


the pros:
-flanking mechanics in combat bring an interesting value to positioning most games forget about.
-each class is viable even if you did not choose a specific class and race combination for the stat bonuses.
-the dev team interacts with the players and are open about their plans for the game's future.

the neutral:
-enconomy is very much player based, with everything besides the most basic of tools being drops or player crafted(and player crafted items being the stronger option)

the bad:
-combat is very bland at this point.
-gathering materials often involves guesswork, where despite carrying the proper material in your bag you cannot use it if you did not equip it prior to the encounter (personal taste ofcourse, as it is a gamble mechanic and in the situations you bring the correct tools you have potential to earn more than you would when gathering normally)
-the intro to the game is very confusing, and goals are entirely up to the wants of the player. while this is good in a sandbox game, this also scares off a great deal of new players who are not in the mood for reading the guides when starting the game. a simple tie-in tutorial, with use of the player's heritage, would allow an easier and more welcoming learning curve.",1505041489,1505041489,True,7,0,0.564713835716247559,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Movement at least for me is to clunky,,in fights it's ok with ""grid movement"", but moving around in the world should be more.. fluid? (imo that is,,some ppl obviously like it this way..""virtual boardgame"")

It needs somekind of story to kickoff new players with as in all mmos, as is you're pretty much just dropped on the board with no pointers what to do or go.

And as always with a itemshop..hide basic mechanics behind a paywall is never a good idea..6$ for another crafting slot etc? that's a few hundred bucks if you want to craft it all

Full Review:
While the game is still in very early stages, it already has a lot of fun to offer. It has a ""table top miniatures"" art style and feel to it, which is very appealing for those of us with backgrounds in pen and paper RPGs or tabletop mini wargaming.

The combat is sequential turn based on a grid. Players have a basic attack and accumulate new abilities as they level up. The game takes into account details like having enemies pinned against a wall or surrounding them (or being on the receiving end of that kind of thing!).

There are several different crafting trees to try out, one at a time, along with many gathering skills. The crafting system has more depth than you'd expect at this stage, which is great.

The dev is like a machine. He's almost always logged in, in chat, talking with (and LISTENING TO!) players right at the door to the main city. Dev involvement like that is worth its weight in gold. He freely gives out an e-mail address you can send suggestions to, and is always quick to engage with the player base.

You also get a home base called a Base Of Operations, lovingly referred to as your BOO. You can level it up to expand it, store things there, and decorate it for cosmetic appeal. You can also add functional things like crafting stations, gardens and animal pens for fun or harvesting, etc.

Overall the game is pretty great conceptually, and is already in a great state even this early in development. Over time there's a lot of promise here for a casual to intermediate-intensity gaming experience. I recommend it highly. It's free to play it, with a cash shop, but without the pay to win feel.",1505010656,1505010656,True,3,0,0.520114302635192871,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Combat is kind of okay. Sadly, it gets incredibly boring very quickly, and becomes a repetive snorefest after a few minutes. 1, click, 2, 1, get attacked a few times, repeat. The first few dungeons offer some crafting materials, but nothing in the way of usable equipment. You can also get housing stuff, but you can't even place them without a house, which requires materials and ""triads"" (the game's currency, earned through quest completion and selling loot). Like, a LOT of triads. Your inventory and stash also start out so small that you're essentially forced to take maybe one or two things to avoid filling them both up. While you could upgrade your stash, that, too, requires materials and triads. Again, more grinding.

The game world is devoid of any sort of interesting PoI's. You'll find nodes for gathering crafting materials (which require a bunch of different tools), some battle nodes (with color-coded difficulty ""peg"" bases), dugeons (private, world, and random varieties), and towns. Other than that, it's mostly flat land, some plateaus, and that's it. Nothing particularly interesting.

Dungeons are...well, painful. They're a pain to navigate, a pain to fully explore, and a real pain to work in with other players, especially since so many will continuously farm enemy nodes for XP and drops. The camera's wonky view and controls certainly don't help either. You can't zoom out to see the whole dungeon. Instead, the camera switches to a top-down view, and only shows a small portion of the area. Like I said: Painful.

Give the devs time to get this game more fleshed out before you consider playing it. At the moment, it's just simply not worth the time.",1505009848,1505009848,False,3,0,0.490344405174255371,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Wrestle with it a bit and when you get too frustrated ask and someone will help you I am certain of it.

The feel of the game is old school pen and paper to me. Difference is I don't have a fridge of mountain dew and my friends sitting around rolling dice. I have a keyboard and a mouse. Is it a bit grindy? Sure..AS IT SHOULD BE. You want the easy button then shop at Staples. Is it hard? No. Easy concepts and simple combat dynamics that can be manipulated to give yourself (or party) an edge. Takes all of 10 minutes to figure out (or one pop up...remember I mentioned those.

At first, it took a short while to get going, tutorials for the moment are limited to the short in game help screens. There is a Help channel and a world channel, where 99% of all questions I've seen asked have been answered within 30 seconds by someone.

After getting the basics out of the way, I started to explore the world, the dungeons, my BOO etc.

Your character is represented by a non-animated figurine on a stand (think old-style Dungeons & Dragons tabletop miniatures), with a fair bit of customisation available from the start. There are currently 4 different character classes and 5 or 6 different races (each race has a bonus to one starting stat). Starting stats even out around level 6-7, so the main choice is in no way game breaking, and your best bet is to choose based on role-play or fun purposes.

The world (currently) consists of the main town, the Overworld, your BOO (Base of Operations - which is your stash / stall / and crafting area), and 2 dungeon types - world dungeons which are open to anyone, and private dungeons which are solo dungeons. The dungeons are also level set to a range (eg 1-3, 3-9, 5-10) which you can change from your party settings (even if solo), so you can fight easier or harder mobs as you wish.

Combat is turn-based, with actions done in order (various spells can change the orders / stop creatures acting). You can move and fight, or, move and cast, in a single round, and you can also harvest corpses (or resource nodes which sometimes show up)  provided you have the correct tools equipped.

Xp, loot, and sometimes triads (basic currency) are awarded at the end of a successful combat, with loot being anything really - recipes, crafting mats, weapons, armour etc. 

The gameplay overall is very slow paced, so don't come in expecting COD/CS:S/<insert other fast game here> speeds, but this works nicely as you need to spend time to upgrade your Base, your stash, your stall and your harvesting and crafting skills (if you want to craft that is).

One thing I noticed while playing: there are VERY active Devs who sit in the game world, answer questions, help players, listen to suggestions etc, which I found very refreshing, and very nice to see.

Devs have also mentioned changes to various systems they have coming after listening to player responses to the game so far - again, very nice to see.

Overall, a bit of a bumpy start to a new game release (stupid ddos'ing script kiddies), but I highly recommend you give the game more than 20 minutes of your time if you like this type of game - you won't be disappointed.",1504990406,1504990406,True,10,0,0.563095390796661377,0,False,False,False,False,,,

At the moment it is not.

Lag time between moves: 2 minutes.
Unplayable.

Continuation:

So. The company claimed the lag encountered on Sep 9th was because there were 10times the number of players they expected. Well, that sounds like a success. Indeed, the lag on the map where you start with a character is mostly gone. 

So there was actually a chance to test how the game works.
However, my initial assessment that the game is not worth playing only manifested after getting the chance to actually play.

There no such thing as a tutorial.
There are explanations, but they're not really helping. So, I started a combat. Movement and using abbilities is pretty straight forward (esp. because you only have 1 methods of attack, 1 melee and 1 ranged, yay for variety). It plays out like a farily simple board game, which is ok for a turn based MMO. The game doesnt explain to you, what kind of damage you do, it doesnt explain to you how many damage you can expect doing. Looking at stats doesnt help you figuring out anything.

You don't even see what items you're wearing, because there are only icon slots in your paperdoll inventory but they don't show the equipped item (at least, I assume items where equipped because in the inventory LIST they were shown as equipped, but who knows.

After you're injured it sounds like a great idea to camp, because camping regains mana and health, you're told. Now comes the fun part: You need camping materials. Fortunately, the game tells you where to get it. You can buy it in the ingame STORE. Yes, to get health back the first thing you're told is how to pay real money. I suppose there's a way to get the camping materials without paying real money, but of course, you're not told that. 

I think that's all I need to know about a game - or rather the business concept of their developers.

Still, I tried to enter the city in hope I could perhaps sell some of the loot I got during the 5 fights I won. After staring a minute at the loading screen, I killed the game in the task list.

Actually, that is what should have been done to the game: Kill it before it was ever published.",1504990241,1505030020,False,2,0,0.397120505571365356,2,False,False,False,False,,,

Stash is a neat concept on paper, but the execution of the game is horrible. The game will frequently lag, whether it be from the game itself, or spammers making everyone have a good time. The movement feels very clunky and unresponsive, as does the combat. It's not complicated by any means, but it just doesn't feel as solid and responsive as it should, though it is admittedly a bit better once you start using the hotkeys. 

There are also a number of bugs as well, such as fights not ending sometimes when you finish off the enemies, so you have ot take a move, end your turn, rinse and repeat until you make it to the treasure chest. The XP bar is also, as of writing, useless and doesn't tell you a single thing. You have to manually type in /xp to get this stat. I'm not sure how an XP bar can be messed up like that, but I imagine it's not exactly a hard bug to fix. 

The gameplay design is also a bit wonky in other aspects as well. You get a chance to pick a skill to go into, be it cooking, enchancing, smithing, etc. HOWEVER, to actually do things with it, you need a special item you put in your BOO (Base of Operations), and a tool to gather resources. The former you cannot actually use until you upgrade your BOO, which is not explained. So why bother giving me the ability to try and learn a skill if you're also not going to actually let me use it? The resources you need to upgrade your BOO aren't something you'll just grab along in a dungeon or something, I'm honestly still not sure.

-Movement imput delay of about 3 seconds on overmap which can end up in fits of moving randomly and being told over and over you ""cannot move there.""
-Community has the hallmarks of toxicity already, with most people being very snarky towards the most frequently asked question;
""How do I move"" - Linked to the input delay on the overmap which can cripple you when you start, only for you to get chewed out for asking about it.

Minuses
*  1-3s latency on walking. It's a pain. Also the mouse pathfinding is terrible, so expect to WASD your way around.

*  Poor interface design. Want to mouse drag treasure every encounter? No thank you. Clicking to end combat? No. The town, like the interface, suffers from poor planning. Good example:  entering a flashing area and then clicking a small button just to get a shop menu. The shops are spaced very far apart. You can tell I value my time. I didn't find the town to be pleasing to the eyes.

*  Remastering of sound needed. The sound effects were too low compared to the forgettable background music.

*  Smarmy devs. It's not smart to tell players to ""get a mount"" when your server gets back to them when it wants to. Instead of being proud of your creation, you need to learn to be ashamed when you put on a terrible first impression. No wait, it's not a first impression because you manipulated the release date. How do you like that one out of the bag?

Pluses
*  RPG system had some substance
*  Tooltips for stats, you can tell what to build on your character
*  Colorful artwork, inviting to the eyes
*  Tutorial combat was solid.

I want to love the game, it has elements from Dofus and Project Gorgon both of which are pretty good indie MMOs. Touch of Wildstar in there as well.

However I don't love it like I should. The UI sucks, the bugs are plentiful and there's not much to do but kill and craft. I enjoy killing and crafting though. 

Combat is slow, a lot of elements of it are poorly (or not at all) explained and there's still a lot of work to be done. 

Potential is hidden in there, but there's not a lot of meat, not a lot of population and not a lot of reason to play.

The game never crashed and everything was smooth for combat being turn based. 
It is fairly challenging to figure out what to do and how to get in a groove.  That itself is worth a few dollars.
After 20 hours I figured out eating food all the time, selling everything, and having several harvesting tools on your character are all critical.  

If your looking for a simple fun game to spend some time go for it, I believe it will improve with time.  IF your looking for 
total polish you may be dissapointed.  Videos and websites and even forums telling you what to do and how to do it are not going to be in abbundance.

For the price of a soda and some snacks what can be the harm.

150+ Hours Later . . and f2p opening up
The game still holds interest for me.  You do figure out tactics, what potions to use, what equipment to seek out or make for your character.  With the advent of some game updates you can adjust the scale of Random dungeons to suit your needs.  

Everything I still holds probably more true now than the day I wrote it.

I come from the old school where the Legend of Zelda was king in the adventure/RPG genre. In fact, I feel like that one game defined how all after it would go.

The Stash Community is also willing to help out anyway they can to make sure that you feel welcome and a part of the community whether you have been playing MMO or new to it.

Note: Pros and Cons subject to change based up full release 

Pros
+Helpful and friendly Community and Development Team 
+Development teams willingness to listen to the community
+Options and classes they have right now
+Being able to customize your home, craft and sell your items to the community
+Trade System 
+Trade Crafting, Maker, Armorer, Weaponsmith, Cook, Alchemist, Enchanter
+Personable Game all around.
+Not a Pay to win MMO though you can buy Medallions for special costumes, extra inventory, special mounts, but those same items you can use ingame money you earn to buy same things

Cons
-Sometimes Laggy
-Leveling up seems slow but they have events that gives Exp boosts to help with leveling 
-some of the tasks are not completed ingame yet so will have to wait till completed
-Somewhat of a tutorial so it can be hard to figure out in the begining but gets easier with time and community. But this issue is    being worked on 

Overall

This is a great game that I would reccomend to anyone thats looking for a new game experience. Yes it is Early Access but after talking to the developers and watching them interact with the community like they do I see this becoming one of more popular MMOs on Steam.

The housing system here in Stash (they call it your BOO or Base of Operations) is the best I have ever seen. They say your BOO is like half your character and I believe it. I can't believe how many ways you can upgrade and level it up. 

I hope this game gets a lot more visibility soon as it really deserves to have a huge playerbase. I know I will definitely be telling all my friends to jump on board immediately. This is a perfect type of game for early access as the devs have already shown they listen to players and that means we get to have input now into the direction the game will go.

I can really see this happening.
The game wants you to feel at home and i think that it will be a paradise for roleplayers later.

+Tabletop art style(gives the game a very unique atmosphere)
+Turn based combat that makes you think about your next move and encourages teamplay.
+Housing that isnt just a small side feature but one of the games main features.
+Multiple ways to customize your character(different races,selecting a RP background,choosing a pose and peg for your character,customizing the face,choosing armor or weapons for your costume).
+Dungeons that spawn at a random place in the world.
+Monsters can ambush you while travelling.
+Funny quest and item descriptions sometimes ;)
+Very nice community.
+RP friendly.

-The current revival system makes dungeons too easy to solve.
-Not many jobs to choose right now(only 4).
-Small playerbase.
-could become pay to win in the future(i will keep a eye on the itemshop and the medallions but reviving with medallions and upgrading your BOO with medallions allready sounds worrying).
-You cant visit the BOO of someone else and you cant walk around in it with your character(might get changed later).


The game lacks a lot of things but its allready more playable than many other early access games on steam id say.
Also,there will be milestones.
That means,the more you achieve in the games testing phase,the more you will be rewarded when the game releases.

The MMO genre has grown pretty stale. Everyone knows this. How nice it is to see an INDIEDEVELOPER finally step in and change things up. This is why indie games are the most important thing in this industry. But I am distracted.

Every facet of this game is simple at first but quickly reveals layers of depth. Combat. Housing. Crafting. Character development. I have only scratched the surface but I already see so many layers. 

When I read the forum for this game I see a development team that cares a lot about this game. That is one of the most important things for any game but especially online games.

I have already seen so many interesting ideas or new twists on standard mmo mechanics. These developers have definitely set out to bring something new to the mmo world and I for one am thankful for it. 

More people should know about this game! I really enjoyed playing it solo and it was also a lot of fun grouping with other people. The tactical elements of combat became even more interesting then. Most of my friends hate early access so I can't get them to play yet, but I know they will play once the game has its full release. 

I would like to see a little more information early on explaining how things work and maybe more information in tooltips. I saw on the forums that the developers are already planning to do this, which is very encouraging.

For those looking for a quick review, it's a good game. It has a lot of fixes still as to be expected with an early access game, but if you're looking for a different kind of RPG then give it a go.

Pros:
Unique style of gameplay - Offers a more casual, different approach on the typical RPG.
Crafting - A crafting system. It has one.
Combat - A heroes of might and magic take on combat.
Developers - Active devs that listen to the community.
Party System - A very simple and fantastic party system. 
Base of Operations - Like player housing. Your central HUB. 
Soundtrack - Nice ambient music. Not sure how limited the soundtrack is though.
Character Customization - Not bad, It's not fantastic but it was a lot more than what I was expecting.

Cons:
Difficult to understandat first. I feel the overwhealming ""what do I do?"" at the start of the game could deter players from giving it a good try. There should be a tutorial or at least more detailed, thurough help pages.
Some bugs/fixes that need to be addressed. 
Crafting - It's crafting system is somewhat limited and difficult to understand. There are 4 ""professions"" and some gathering tools. I hope they can expand to give some more options later on. 
Party Base - I feel there should be a party option where multiple players can enter a single BOO within a party and interact with it. 
 

I gave this a positive review because I think the game is on the right track. I wouldn't say it's ready to be played at it's full potential just yet. For the quality of the game and considering it's early access right now I'd say it's price is a bit steep.

I enjoy the fact that it's turn-based as well as click to move with the game itself plotting a path to where you want to go. Negative: sometimes the paths take you through locations that prompt you whether you want to enter or not. I find that a little annoying. I wish the pathing would take you around the location and/or not trigger the prompt unless I had specifically clicked on it. 

I really enjoy combat. It has a really old-school video game feel to it. I played a game a long time ago on a Sega Genesis that was similar. Grid areas, turn based, etc. There is also a very noticeable difference in combat between the classes offered and how you have to approach encounters. I like that a lot. 4 classes and every one of them is genuinely different.

Overall I like the game. I really enjoy the company as well. Frogdice games are something I have been playing for ~20 years. They have a tendency towards ""subtle depth"" in their games. They don't beat you over the head with the lore. They let you uncover it - and I have a distinct feeling that same approach is included in this game as well.

The Devs and community are easily the best part of this game. They genuinely care about their players and community and go above and beyond with the amount of time they actually spend interacting with them. Every player has a voice when it comes to content or improvements in the game and can post them freely on the Frogdice forums or discuss with the devs using the in-game chat. Updates are pushed out weekly and most offer new content, bug fixes, and new systems as requested by players. The devs also change what content is prioritized by community suggestions and requests. This just adds to the awesome gameplay and content by giving each player direct access to those in control. No other game I have every played has gone this far in terms of customer service and attention to their community.

The game itself is bright and colorful and has delightfully inspired creatures that invoke a sense of nostalgia for older RPG's while still bringing a new and fun approach to the genre. The tile based combat system is a nice touch that offers lots of tactical options and a fun way to play with other players.

The crafting system still needs some work but what is already in place is a great system that is easy to get lost in and spend time crafting out gear for yourself and friends. The newspaper system for buying and selling is easy to use once you get a few upgrades out of the way and offers pletty of options for getting what you need to advance your craft.

All in all the game has a great learning curve and will keep you coming back for more. As the content gets pushed out by the Devs it will only get better and better.

That being said, I would be remiss if I didn’t point out that for an early access game with a price point, the game does feel a little bare.

Early Access has pros and cons. The con is things aren't totally finished and you have to experiment and go through more trial an error to figure out what to do. I get that and I can already see the devs working their butts off to improve all that rapidly.

But I have actually found that I really like the feel, to me at least, of playing an interactive board game on the PC.

The game is intuitive, addictive, and to me the most important quality is enjoyment.  I can play it at home or at my office and I still get a great return on my time.  I would recommend this game.",1475182714,1475182714,True,6,0,0.489912271499633789,0,False,False,True,False,,,

Something you don't expect or see very often is how involved the devs are with their community, playing along side you, finding and going over bugs and discussing with you, in game, how certain mechanics can be changed for the better.  I've been playing a few days now and there have already been several patches to fix issues and make balancing changes, all based on the feedback and bugs found by the community since early release started.

The game itself I find enjoyable and relaxing, my first impression left me thinking about my old days of playing D&D with friends.  There was no form of tutorial or help page when I started playing, but within a day or so a help button was added with a little getting started guide and tips.  There is usually someone around who can help answer specific questions as well.  I now spend most of my time running solo and just chatting with everyone.  Now and then I'll join a party or pair up with someone to clear a dungeon or two.  When my bags are full, I stop by my Base of Operations (BOO) to offload my loot, upgrade my stuff and even do a little cooking when I have the materials.  Then off to town to sell the extra loot to vendors.

I find myself being drawn back into game whenever I have free time, both to keep hunting for loot to upgrade my base and skills, and for the connection to the community.  I see the game become better every day as bugs are squashed and new elements are added and/or rebalanced.

That being said the Devs are awesome and on the ball with any and all questions or problems you may run into.  There's a good wiki page set up for the game that answers most questions I've come across so far and the in game community is very friendly and helpful.

If you're a fan of Frogdice's other games and like their look and feel then you'll be right at home with Stash.

There's a learning curve, and like I said this isn't finished yet so just think about that before pulling the trigger and purchasing the game.

As of now I have no real opinion on the game.   It feels as it should for a early beta.   Game Developers are pretty on the ball with anything we report.    Only warning I'd give is this is not a finished product, don't purcahse it expecting it to be one you would be dissapointed.     The community is A+ though.


New:
In my 20 years of playing online games starting with MUD's I've never encountered a development team so passionate, so devoted, or so open to communication.     This team work constantly to deliver with constant updates and a real at home enviroment.     I feel like part of the family and development process.    The game itself is still a little shakey but every bug encountered is quickly squished at this rate I have no doubt in my mind that this game will be one of my top ten favorites once it is complete.     I even decided to drop a extra $50 just to show support.    Which I rarely do.     Please do keep in mind my old review though if you decide to purchase into this beta.   It is a development and testing phase so things are constantly changing and bugs happen.   Patience is needed, but for those who stick with it, they gain a new family. a new home.   I think anyone who enjoys a D&D style of game, or MUD would get the most value out of this game.    I personally get a mouthful of nostalgic member berries everytime I log in.",1475047412,1475233383,True,28,0,0.487603336572647095,0,False,True,True,False,,,
