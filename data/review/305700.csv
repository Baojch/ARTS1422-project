Anyway, we are avid divers ourselves IRL, so we are striving to create a realistic diving experience - the sites, wildlife, dive science, history, and environmental info (presented in Field Guide pages unlocked via gameplay) are all accurate.

Infinite Scuba® é um jogo de estilo Simulação / Casual que irá fazer você visitar as profundezas do oceano. Explore a grande imensidão do mar, encontre uma grande biodiversidade e até mesmo antigos veículos. Seu objetivo em si é explorar o oceano, tirar fotos e completar as conquistas dentro do jogo.

Os gráficos são um pouco realísticos, além da suave movimentação do protagonista e dos seres marinhos. A soundtrack é relaxante, além de apresentar uma ambientação sonora bem tranquila.

O tutorial é bem completo, e só dá procedência após completar todas as ações. Fiquei vislumbrado com a ideia de poder explorar o mar e conhecê-lo de outro ângulo. Fiquei impressionado quando encontrei um navio cargueiro encalhado, tomado por corais e musgos, magnifico. Aparentemente os seres vivos não reagem a proximidade. Mas logo logo você irá se deparar com o tédio, tendo em vista a falta de conteúdo e de ambientação, o que acabou com a proposta do jogo.

Mas olha, fique atento quanto ao seu nível de oxigênio e de profundidade. Fiquei tão empolgado com a ideia que acabei cometendo um suicídio a primeira instância.

Você pode adquirir novos equipamentos de mergulhador. Alguns deles são liberados através do seu progresso pelo jogo, contudo a maioria exige que você pague $$.",1490912665,1490965885,False,18,0,0.584341645240783691,2,False,False,True,False,,,

[h1]General Impression[/h1]
For a game that’s priced almost as much as its subgenre competitors (ABZÛ, Depth Hunter 2 and World of Diving), Infinite Scuba doesn’t have nearly as much content or polished details to compare itself or even stand out. Not to mention the chance of softening the blow from the premature implementation of microtransactions in an Early Access title that is obviously far from completion. The game’s developer made some amateurish mistakes which I will describe in detail below.

First and foremost among Infinite Scuba’s many sins, has to be the lack of proper diversity as far as the diving locations are concerned. You just have two such places and in a twisted sense of irony, one level has to be unlocked with “clams” (the game’s idea of currency). So indeed, you can visit just one stage if you choose to spend your initial and so far only amount of 500 clams on diving equipment instead of unlocking the Mesoamerican Reef level. Naturally, I had to make the only smart choice available in this case and I unlocked 50% more “content”. You cannot gain these pesky clams in any way during gameplay. So I think we can either expect the developer to proceed with his intention of selling the in-game currency at real world money value or take the decent way out of this mess and at least offer a way of gathering some of the clams through the activities you perfrom as a diver. But they probably won’t do that since the prospect of earning even more cash than the game’s price tag is too enticing to pass up, right? Bravo, gentlemen!

While the Belize level offers just the opportunity to explore a large coral reef, the game’s main location is the Chuuk Lagoon from Micronesia where you can delve into an actual historic shipwreck. Sadly, the Gosei Maru cannot be examined as thoroughly as you’d expect since Infinite Scuba’s interior exploration hasn’t been implemented yet. Just like its wonderful clam gesheft! So you may ask, just what exactly CAN you do in this simulator? Well dive, of course. I have to admit that the diving mechanics themselves as well as the information provided (and a pleasant amount of trivia also) gave the impression that the game tries to take itself seriously enough and I wouldn’t be able to rate it any lower than I did.

Honestly, I really gave it a fair chance and took nearly a dozen dives. It’s unfortunate that they have to last so little (not even 10 minutes per single dive) and the oxygen tanks seem to have the capacity of a plastic bag. If you don’t move a lot and your depth is just a few meters from the surface, I guess you could prolong the underwater trip but what’s the point of standing still, in a simulator about seafloor exploration? Infinite Scuba actually marked some of my dives as “unsuccessful” since I had less than 500 oxygen units left in the tank by the time I resurfaced. You start out all your dives with 3000 units which rapidly decrease if you swim below 30 meters. The grinding required in order to complete all your tasks, cannot be estimated at a number lower than 25 dives per location. Absurd.

The wildlife is nicely detailed and simulated, though there is never enough variety when it comes to larger cartilaginous fish (such as rays and sharks). And I’m certain that no one would risk deep dives just for the sake of fifty different coral shapes and sizes. At least there are also objects scattered on the seabed for you to collect or catalogue. You can take pictures of certain areas of interest on the shipwreck and get awarded with in-game achievements (which never result in actual Steam achievements or at least some wonderful clams to unlock new gear).

The simulation itself ain’t half-bad even with the mediocre oxygen tank capacity. You can enjoy the game and relax while swimming and exploring but I cannot tolerate this title’s particularly abhorrent form of microtransactions. A malicious practice to gaming in general, in Infinite Scuba this is only made worse since you can’t obtain the so-called clams through simply playing the game and thus there’s no real gain even from grinding the two areas (or just one, if you didn’t spend all the clams on the Belize level). This isn’t a reward system. Just pure greed!

[h1]Strong Points[/h1]
+ Decent looking & sounding.
+ Comprehensive diving simulation.

[h1]Weak Points[/h1]
- Overpriced and with future implementation of microtransactions.
- Early Access with just two diving locations (one being initially locked until you “pay” for it). 
- No Steam Trading Cards nor Achievements.

I've always wanted to SCUBA dive, but I've not been able to. This game is realistic enough to give me a small taste of what it might be like. It simulates important effects of depth such as nitrogen narcosis and the need for a safety stop after a deep dive.

So far, the game includes two maps: Chuuk Lagoon and Belize. (The Belize map is 500 clams, but you start with that much at the beginning.) Chuuk Lagoon includes the wreck of the Gosei Maru, a Japanese ship that sank there in World War Two. Belize includes the Mesoamerican Reef. The player is given a list of ""Things to Do"" at each site, such as swimming to special areas, finding underwater caches, spotting different kinds of wildlife, finding artifacts, and, at Belize, cleaning up trash. I thought the activities were interesting, though some of the collections are very hard to complete.

The swimming feels natural, though it took me some time to get used to using the camera independently of the swim direction. The player can hit ""N"" to orient oneself, but I wish that there was also a button to just reset the camera. Also, the ""H"" key gives help for the keys but doesn't mention the ballast vest controls, CTL and SPC. A player would have a tougher time playing without that information.

A couple of nitpicks: The Belize map has water currents, but they seem to flow randomly and without a pattern. I could be mistaken, though. Also, a sudden surface from a very deep dive still counts as a ""Successful dive"" even though in real life it would cause decompression sickness.

The game does have microtransactions, but except for extra maps (in the future) it all seems to be cosmetic. There doesn't seem to be a noticeable difference in how the extra gear works. While some people hate microtransactions on principle, I personally have no problem with buying extra content.

For the price, I would recommend this.

Edit: My remarks to another review were deleted by the reviewer, so to answer those points again here:

""30 second unskippable warning screen every time during launch"" and ""Extremely long loading times accompanied by obnoxious music, even on an SSD."" This is only the first time you play the game. The long loading time is because the maps are downloaded from the Internet when you first load it. The other reviewer must have just started the game a single time and then immediately deleted it.

""Only ONE map is included in the game price."" It comes with one map and 500 ""clams,"" and then you can get the second one for 500 clams. I have two maps, and I didn't buy anything except the base game.",1484646435,1484661022,True,5,0,0.404350966215133667,1,True,False,True,False,,,

Cons:

-  in-game purchases gates content despite already paying $13 for the game. 
-  Low budget dated graphics.
-  30 second unskippable warning screen every time during launch.
- ""Early"" access to a game that's been worked on since 2010 and is a chore to experience.

-  Bare bones options.  A resolution and Quality setting.  Nothing else.
-  Extremely unrealistic underwater movement breaks any possibility of immersion. 
-  Only ONE map is included in the game price.

PROS:

- Steam's refund policy


An early warning sign of the quality of this game is on the Early Access description section of the store page.  [i]""“[b]Completing the in-game store is very high priority[/b]. Past that, we want to add new gear....""[/i]   Yep.  The developer's priority of In-game transactions is very clear.
Want more scuba gear?  Pay $2.50 of real money.   Want suits, fins etc?  Pay real money.  
Only one explorable area is included in the $12.99 asking price and the only other map I could see required in game currency to purchase.

Upon purchasing the game on steam they actually do give you $5 worth of in-game currency (clams).   Problem is, this will not buy you much of the game's content.  They ask 200 clams for a wetsuit, 200 Clams for fins, knives, gear sets...  After that they expect you to pay a further [u]$5 USD per 500 clams from their website[/u].  
 How about no, I've already paid you $13. 

If you are going have content gated behind in-game purchases then make the base game free.  This is just distasteful. 

Even when ignoring the micro transactions, the game itself is bland to look at and not enjoyable, so I will be asking Steam to refund my ""Clams"".

Вас ожидают захватывающие приключения в морских глубинах.

Мы играем за аквалангистку, любительницу дайвинга, исследующую океана. На карте постепенно будут открываться различные районы для дайвинга. Погружаемся и выполняем задания. Тут надо фотографировать морскую живности и растительность. Чтобы легче было сфотографировать нужно подплыть поближе, и когда курсор станет в виде квадратных скобок щелкнуть мышкой на нужный предмет. Готовыми фото можно поделится в Фейсбуке.

В игре можно искать старинные экспонаты, артефакты и другие особые объекты. Если соберете полный комплект, то вам дадут какую-то вещь для персонажа (маску, нож, баллон и другие полезные плюшки).

Выполняйте миссии, чтобы открыть новые регионы на карте.

В игре есть внутри игровые достижения (причем довольно интересные), магазин снаряжения и одежды. Можно прикупить акваланги, чтобы дольше находится под водой и не всплывать. Продают ножи, маски, фонарики и сексапильные костюмы для дайвинга, которые порадуют ценителей бикини. Переоденьте свою аквалангистку в один из таких костюмов, и можно бесконечно любоваться ее движениями и заплывами под водой, глазеть на ее сексапильную попку.

Очень реалистичная картина морских глубин, красивая графика, приятная музыка. Единственный минус – довольно долгие загрузки регионов. В остальном все смотрится достойно и качественно. Даже не заметно, что игра еще в раннем доступе.

Великолепная игра, чтобы расслабится и приятно провести время любуясь видами подводных красот и сексапильной аквалангистки. Очень рекомендую!

Разработчики в данном симуляторе добавили аркадности, так и интересней, и есть какой то смысл в игре. Вам нужно будет выполнять различные задания, такие как найти определенного обитателя или сделать фото и многое другое. За выполнение задания вам будут открываться предметы для оснащения вашего дайвера. Перед каждым заплывом вы сможете полностью переодеть вашего героя, так же полность сменить его оснащение или же изменить самого персонажа.

Графика в игре среднего качества, в 2017 году можно намного лучше, насколько большие локации, я сказать не могу, так как скоросто перемещения очень мала, да и само перемещение какое то заторможеное, над этим нужно еще поработать разработчикам. Для первого заплыва мне пришлось минут 20 грузить какую то пoeбeнь, то ли локации, в общем не важно, неужели нельзя сделать чтоб все файлы загружались вместе с игрой и стандартными средствами стима?

Ну а в общем игра не плоха, и если разработчик за время раннего доступа прислушается к советам игроков и последует их пожеланиям, то получится обалденный симулятор!

    	[*] Sehr real gehaltene Tauch Simulation
    	[*] Original Markennamen für Tauch-Equipment
	[*] Man kann viel über Scuba-Diving lernen (Handbücher etc. vorhanden)
	[*] Unterschiedliche Aufgaben eins realen Tauchers (Erkundung, Fischbestimmung, Aufräumarbeiten, Fotos)
	[*] Sehr gute Grafik

	[*] Man kann kein Action-Spiel erwarten! Alles läuft sehr träge und ruhig ab! (ist eigentlich kein negativ-Merkmal)

Wenn ihr selber taucht oder Interesse daran habt, dann ist Scuba Infinite für euch geeignet! Am Anfang wählt ihr den Tauchplatz, dann euer (real existierendes!) Equipment. Ihr lernt mit dem Finimeter umzugehen und rechtzeitig aufzutauchen. Zudem gibt es viele Aufgaben zu erledigen. Alles in allem ein sehr ruhiges Erkundungsspiel zum Entspannen! Die deutsche Übersetzung ist aber Käse, am besten spielt ihr das Spiel auf englisch.

ich hab nun die ersten drei Tauchgänge hinter mir und bin noch nicht so ganz sicher was ich von dieser Simulation halten soll. Die Steuerung ist ok. Die Grafik könnte etwas schöner sein. Es ist ein eher ruhiges Such, Sammel und mache Bilder von ... Spiel! Dabei handelt es sich um echte Lebewesen aus dem Meer und soll diesen Lebensraum und das Erlebnis vom tauchen näher bringen. Gefundene Fische/Pflanzen werden im Tauchführer wie in einer Wiki nach und nach frei geschaltet (leider nur in englischer Sprache). Es gibt diverse Ausrüstung die man sich erspielen, geschenkt bekommt oder gegen Muscheln kaufen muss. Die muscheln scheinen wohl eine Ingame Währung zu sein aber ich hab noch nix dazu heruas gefunden. Man hat nur ein Schiffsfrack bzw einen zweiten Ort der aber auch mit Muscheln freigeschaltet werden muss.
So sammel ich also (solange der Sauerstoff reicht) diverse Sachen ein und erledige Aufträge ... ob es auf Dauer motivert? 

Ich werde es weiter beobachten und kann derzeit weder einen Daumen nach oben oder unten geben. 
Na dann halt den Daumen hoch weil der Daumen in der Mitte fehlt :-)",1484240132,1484240132,True,9,0,0.609290003776550293,2,True,False,True,False,,,
