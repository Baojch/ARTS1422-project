Идея игры - обойти конкурентов в заработке, для чего создаешь и настраиваешь маршруты, покупаешь грузовые корабли и создаешь хабы с дронами-доставщиками грузов.
Основнаые проблемы игры:
- интерфейс совсем не интуитивный. Не сразу разберешься как работают настройки загрузки и выгрузки товаров в маршрутах. Например если товар в избытке (Surplus) на обеих планетах маршрута, но ты хочешь его накопить на одной из них, то со стандартными настроками маршрута корабль просто будет возить один и тот же груз туда-сюда. Нужно запретить загружать этот груз в пунтке выгрузки в настройках маршрута. Поскольку корабли двигаются не очень быстро, то пока заметишь, разберешься и исправишь пройдет несколько лет.
 - не сбалансировано производство воды и очень медленное развитие колоний (0,0001% в неделю), которое невозможно никаким образом ускорить. Без воды в других системах приходится тащить ее с Земли, и на Земле возникает пробка из кораблей в ожидании, с которой ничего не сделаешь - развитие космопорта ограничено 14м уровнем. Также не встречается планет, которые можно было бы развить до уровня главной планеты (Земли).

Overall this gets my recommendation, but at a 10-15 Euro pricepoint, it was fun and the solely responsible game was for me a blast as you didn't have to handle those pesky opponents.
A few things that detracted from the experience:
- I really missed that there was some type of interaction with other companies, like purchasing or sabotaging, or just anything, currently they are just there.
- The tech tree could really use some ""automation"" features, as when your systems become really big they are really hard to maintain, and the amount of Micro needed is well too much.
- I think the game itself wants you to do these 2 hour games where you optimize and then the game is done after 50 years, but it really feels like its more fun to build out your empire, there just isnt much to do after 75 years that is new in any way.

1. There should be a feature to allow to build a ship from scratch, your own class of ships to set sail in the depths of space.

2. Economic trends on planets and moons should show alerts of new trends. For example, the planet has found resources and no longer needs to import so much of that resource yada yada.

First, I only play in the hardest difficulty in solo (no AI).
We start with absolutely nothing, no landing pad on earth, no spaceship, no colonies, and every very small starting capital.

So it's time to start the perilous adventure ofopening some gates n Earth and launch rockets on the Moon...

And be really quick to build bigger gates, open gates on the moon and buy your first reusable ship, because very soon, demand on the Moon will be too low to make rockets profitable, and if you wait too long between launches, the gates lease will chew your capital and the Moon colony will fail.

And after, that, time to expenda your empire, slowly, very slowly through the solar system, be careful not to overspend, don't be scared to starve colonies to make better profits, manage your funds to improve your research and at some point...


You'll reach boredom before settling in the first outer world.

When you are done with research, you have basically reached the endgame, and at that point, well, there is no real point in continuing playing, you only buy more ships to settle on more worlds, to make more money, to buy more ships to settle on more worlds, etc...

simply put, the game gets very repetitive and you're not even out of the solar system yet.

You need more resources to keep your colonies alive, but the solar system is pretty much self-sufficient, so importing exotic resources is not really worth it.

I get that playing against AI or human competitors, the market would be oversaturated, making it mandatory to find new opportunities elsewhere. But ironically, the hardest game mode doesn't have such a necessity.

I think the game stopped development too soon, the game lacks in-depth, and nothing pushes the player to go further.

And I don't mean like it needs some visual polish to fix things like the camera vibrating as it tries to follow a moon around its orbit and things not quite syncing up right, or having the camera sometimes zoom in (while panning...) so close you see only empty space until you zoom out again.

No. While all of that is true, the main problem is three fold:

1) Single-use rockets are [b]incredibly[/b] cost effective. Most planets have little value in terms of exports, so why send a reusable slow-boat with high capacity for 100 times the purchase price (adding fuel costs, degradation upkeep costs, and so on) when you could instead send 100 single use rockets?

2) The AI isn't all that smart. Sure it can change up its strategy instantly as soon as conditions change and you can't, but it doesn't realize that half the rockets it's sending [i]have no cargo at all[/i] and the AI player would either eventually go bankrupt or would just barely survive out of sheer luck, but as a result never fold and give the player a win. But that leads me to...

3) The colony ships Earth sends out (an AI algorithm that isn't a player) picks the worst targets. First interstellar target is the nearest star?

I had some other issues, like Luna not allowing me to build an office (which raises my company standing) because my company standing was too low (at 80%...) and my standing would continuously degrade month after month because...their import demands was too high...at 0% (literally between me and the AI player(s) we were meeting all of their needs to the point that it wasn't profitable).

Some important techs that you can research destroy the supply/demand ratio of the goods killing the prices. The AI can't handle this and will quickly go bankrupt after you start to use this techs.

CONS
My first experience was that I was in a beta. The interface is very clunky and hard to navigate.
There is a constant money ticking sound that just builds to outrageously annoying levels by the 10th year.
There are no real objectives or danger to just leaving the game take its course.
The game seems to hint at the goal is to be a monopoly more than anything. But it doesn't have any real features that allow you create one.
The 3D planet rotations and camera following is nauseating. You cannot do multiple game functions without pausing the game.
There are a bunch of other issues but those are the few I chose to write here....

PROS
Interstellar trade....just awesome!

Easy to ""break"". 

As it stands at the moment, it does provide some fun, like cult game that you feel the urge to explore and beat in a sustainable way. But I would not recommend it mostly due to:
- bad user interface when you want to manage a full solar system
- very very clunky and with constant shakes when playing the game at full speed
- broken game mechanics: at my third play, I just focused on creating a sustainable route between Earth and Moon and exploited it for a lot of profit, ignoring most of the system. Then I ventured out with the same profile, and focused on researching: massive cargo hauls, drone automation.

Once you hit drone automation, the game is done for. 
Farm for level 2, leaving the game while you go watch a movie. 
Upgrade research stations, so you can get hub level 3
Make one hub level 3, so that Earth is not sending drones to the entire system. 
Infinite profits, I don't even bother planning routes send I got drones between earth and moon. 
Economically conquering the game is now just a matter of time, not even a challenge.


In short, interface and user experience need quite a it of work, it's very bad to manage a complex number of routes.
Game mechanics make it too easy to win, if you focused your path on 1) long haul to enable drone automation, and 2) focus on hub level 3.

On the surface I absolutely love everything about this game. I have turned back to it many times trying to make it work. But it just feels like the fundamentals of the gameplay is not working quite right with what the game is trying to be. And I always end up leaving a bit unsatisfied.
The game is about humanity colonizing the solar system and later going beyond. That's what got me real exited about the game. But that is not what you are doing. You are there to make money. On the surface this is great.
But the problem is that the best ways to make money is not at all natural and feels more like exploiting game mechanics. By not exploiting the game you will spend centuries waiting before you have enough money to leave the system.

To take an example. You need raw resources to make consumer goods. But if you do the sensible thing of building consumer goods factories on the planets that needs them the most. You earn nothing at all. You don't earn money by producing consumer goods. Only by shipping them to the planet. By producing them on site you are giving them away for free.
The best way to earn money on consumer goods. Is to first have a planet mine raw resources, Then ship that to a planet with almost no population but loads of factories, then ship that again to the planets that actually need them. For every stop you add you get to make a profit.

Consumer goods is one thing but the problem becomes more apparent when you start producing a certain resource that needs loads of water, and the last thing you want to do is to produce that thing on any planet that has access to water. The factories will keep on running even if the entire population is about to die of thirst. And that means they are willing to pay a hefty premium for any water shipments.
So in the end by the time you are ready to travel interstellar. The entire solar system is a giant mess where dozens of resources are being shipped to outlandish locations anywhere in the system. Just to maximize the number of stops where you get to take a profit.

I would give it a pass if I could. But I have to like or dislike it. So I guess it will be a like. I did enjoy the majority of time playing it. Before the problems of the mechanics became too apparent. But I doubt I will give the game another try again.

There's a learning curve when you're first starting. If you're falling behind quickly, check out some of the user guides out there to help you understand how gravity wells effect the fuel costs, etc..

One complaint I have is that you can't reconfigure your cargo containers at each stop when using cargo ships, thus allowing you to better control what you're hauling at each stop. After a few abortive attempts to create massive fleets of cargo ships, I ended up switching to primarily using single use, one way rockets to get exactly the cargo I wanted to haul on any given leg of a trade route.

Suggestions
1)	Video Screen (go to ship) button grants ability to zoom out.  Extremely hard to tell where a ship is on the route easier
2)	Provide an ETA on the ship info screen
3)	Music options that mechanical beeping drives one crazy after a few hours
4)	Allow thresholds to be set on a planet/moon to stop the drones from taking everything.  I was developing multiple targets and when robotics kicked in the drones took every Machine to Mars and many routes carrying Machines were broken
5)	Give ability to leave at half-full from a given port
6)	Medicine and Consumer Goods in same cargo category is maddening!  On a long hall it is possible to send half a dozen ships out with dozens of Medicine to fill a need of one


Bugs?
1)	Several times had routes with demanded goods being supplied you can see them increase the supply on the target, but no income
2)	AI overpopulating interstellar planets.  Ruined a fun game I was playing, and I could not keep the supply up to the new planet
3)	KV3 with 2AU speed a day often cannot catch the moon it is chasing.  If it breaks down it seemed to never catch up
4)	In the Route Screen show the Port size of each stop next to system (avoid trying to buy a ship that can not go to that stop) 
5)	Newly Established Route not available in the Change Route drop down for some time (I tried to let the world run a few days)
 
 


 



I can not add a ship to Luna to Fruad 1,  The route appears on the list, but never in the drop down.  I have run the game a few mins, no luck.  I tried deleting and redo, no luck.  I created a new interstellar route worked, tried Fruad 1 again, no luck.

Just to name a pair:
1) You are playing as a logistics company, but you do not have access to ANY sort of logistics data. Some sort of cargo throughput information? Nope. Maybe the approximate time it would take to make a trip for the ship? Also nope. Current or average range between stops? Once again, no. Required fuel? No way to find out either. And according to the developer, this is actually intended.

2) To find out which industries you need to build (identify bottlenecks), you have to know how much your planets are producing. The game still offers no way of getting the combined output or consumption of your planets in any form. Want to see what the bottleneck in your system with 15 colonies is? Have fun adding up all 15 of those manually.

3) No way to set complex logic for your trade stops. Want to make a route of several passenger stops, but don't have any passengers for some of them? Too bad, you're still flying there with no purpose. Same goes for cargo runs - there's no way to stop your ships from going on multi-stop routes with no cargo without making a separate route.

Und wenn Merkur 'Quecksilber' heißt - direkt im Startsystem, zeigts ja den Stand der Übersetzung an.

Die Grafik ist funktionell, die Leistungsanforderung dafür aber viel zu hoch.

Die meisten Fenster enthalten eher Text und Zahlen, nur wenig Bilder. Auch das gefällt mir weniger, macht den Einstieg lieblos. Es mag sein, dass das Spiel später beim richtigen Spielen mehr Spaß macht, allerdings wird es nie was fürs Auge werden, sondern nur was fürs steigende Bankkonto.

Ein Spiel dieser Art braucht auch keine einzelnen Tutorials, ein einfacher Haken beim erstellen eines neuen Spieles sollte genügen und dann bekommt man alles am Anfang erklärt.
Aber schon an der Stelle scheitert der Entwickler leider.

Es geht noch weiter, wie auch mit dem Forschen, man bekommt lauter Schiffe beim Kauf angezeigt, die man eigentlich noch nicht kennen kann, weil sie erst erforscht werden müssen. Und so weiter und so weiter.

Ich gebe es wieder zurück, denn ich wollte ein fertiges Spiel, keinen frühen Zugang.

If the developers continue to work and improve the game I will edit my review depending on the changes.[/b]

The game is not bad. But it's not great either. If this was an early access game I wouldn't complain or not recommend against this game, but it is not right to have this game in the Steam store as a fully release title.

What I enjoy most about space games is the atmosphere and this game made me hate space. Pirate attacks will happen with extremely annoying sounds every 30 seconds (granted, this is on max game speed) and the music/soundtrack in the game is horrible. The sound ""engineer"" of this game should NOT be allowed to be within 100 ft of any instrument ever again for the sake of humanity. I had to play this game with the sound turned off because it is so extremely bad and annoying to listen to.

The UI feels very old, like a 2010 game at best. It's a very clumsy and messy, basic UI that reminded me of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510/Uplink/]Uplink[/url], a 2006 game that I enjoyed a lot.. In 2006. This game feels like it's from the same era. Maybe it was actually made in 2006 and just never release until now, that would explain a lot.
For the names in the game it's obvious they are not creative ""Doeing"", ""Spacebus"".. it's just cringy, it's a fantasy sci-fi space game, just make up something yourself.

Everything about the developer and the studio in general just feels like a clumsy project thrown together a lot faster than they actually try to make you believe. Their website is extremely basic and the pictures show the file names like pretty_spaceport, pretty_ships_orbiting etc. Nothing horrible per se, just messy and not refined, like everything else they do. Also, on their website they boast having a 85% positive review score (during early access).. when actually it's 75% today. Still a good score, but misleading.

Same goes for their tutorial. There is a fairly basic but decent ""window with text"" tutorial in the game but when you launch the game you get the option to see a 30 minute video tutorial on youtube, nothing wrong with that I thought. Until I actually watched the tutorial.. it just feels like the dev was forced to make the tutorial against his will and he wanted to spend as little time and effort as possible on it. There are multiple times he misspoke and he just starts from the beginning of the sentence like nothing happened. Someone who cares would at least edit out those mistakes. There are a few times he mentions ""I think this/that"" in his tutorial, which is strange for someone who made the game himself not being sure about the content. 

To conclude, I'm not saying it's a bad game but it could be so much better if they didn't release this as a completed game and would keep improving it. At the time of writing the last change/update to the game was on the 4th of December 2019, 66 days ago, so I don't think the developers are still actively working on the game or caring too much about the future of it. But I hope they prove me wrong.

That said, there are several issues that need to be fixed or improved in order to really make it better:

- Biggest problem is performance, for me (Linux) open any of the filter windows (ships, starports) causes the game to lag horribly. It seems to help if you minimize the use of drones but it is still bad.

- UI for managing ships is OK, but could use some love to manage large numbers of ships. Especially with the first problem.

- It would be cool if you could pay to send a generation ship to fill out a colony's development (would be a late game tech, $25-$50M or so) or if you could pay to ""advertise"" a colony to temporarily get more colonists. Or other ""pay for single-use"" techs like that.

- More complex tech chains would be nice to help with the late game, where things get a bit flat. Overall the game plateaus really quickly after you get out of your home system. More rare resources, more planet-unique buildings, etc.

- The research tree probably needs rebalancing. The first few techs are critical and take a long time. After that you get a ton of research points and finish the rest quickly. I would say overall the points needed for later techs should be increased, but maybe should have power improved accordingly.

- It would be good if you could customize what resources drones will send, or where they will send them to. Sometimes for example they will send tons of raw resources and ignore more important ones. I think they maximize for profit but that is not always what you want.

- The help should be filled out more. In particular it is not obvious to me what factors increase/decrease numbers of colonists and it is not clear if, for example, you deliver colonists between hubs, if the drones will send colonists to outlying colonies.

Again, overall really fun, just has a few rough edges.",1570653723,1570653723,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Слишком часто из уст разработчиков мы слышим заманчивые обещания интересных механик, продвинутого управления бизнесом и прочих вкусностей, которые могут разнообразить и улучшить геймплей игры.
 
На деле же получаем поверхностные возможности, не дающие желаемого количества удовольствия от процесса. Как же себя покажет  Interstellar Transport Company, в которой нам обещают реалистичный бизнес менеджмент - давайте разберемся.
 
[h1]Войны цифр![/h1]
 
Нам предлагают взять под свое управление межпланетную транспортную компанию и схлестнуться в борьбе с другими фирмами за доминирование на рынке поставок товаров.

Чтобы достигнуть цели придется сильно постараться!
 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1802137694
Сессия в Interstellar Transport Company начинается в стартовой солнечной системе, где мы и будем формировать свой основной капитал. Первые шаги всегда одинаковые: определяемся, что будем поставлять, откуда и куда. Делается это с помощью специального меню для создания маршрутов, в котором определяются тип груза и точки погрузки/разгрузки, но существуют некоторые ограничения.
 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1802138575
Во-первых, выбирая транспортный корабль или одноразовую ракету-носитель, придется учитывать объемы максимально перевозимого груза, ведь вместимость грузового отсека не бесконечна. Во-вторых, товары разделены по группам по 1, 2 и 3 наименования в каждой, поэтому, к примеру, нельзя будет набрать еду в место, предназначенное  под воду.

В-третьих, выполнять грузоперевозки с доходом в одну сторону – невыгодно и долго.
Каждая планета или спутник обладает своим набором параметров, определяющих, что вообще там можно добывать и насколько эффективно. Наиболее “сочные” космические тела быстро становятся новыми колониями, требующими пристального внимания и иногда поставок необходимого за копейки. Дабы работать не в убыток, игрой предусмотрена система субсидий, когда за наиболее остро необходимые товары вам будут платить больше обычного.

Но не только лишь грамотным построением маршрутов и ценностью перевозимых товаров определяется успех, ведь без должной инфраструктуры также не обойтись. Прежде всего, вашим кораблям нужно где-то приземляться для погрузки/выгрузки товаров, поэтому придется позаботиться об аренде дока, но конкуренты не дремлют. Количество мест ограничено развитостью космического порта, а перекупить у оппонента док не получится. Впрочем, можно вложить деньги в развитие космопорта, тем самым расширив количество свободного пространства.
 
Наземная инфраструктура тоже важна. Стоит позаботиться об оборудовании ремонтных ангаров, ведь все грузовые посудины требуют постоянного обслуживания, а застрять посреди космоса с поломкой, значит понести серьезные убытки. Не менее полезны системы шаттлов, ускоряющие погрузку/разгрузку пристыкованных кораблей.
 
Несколько позже появится возможность субсидирования колоний. Прежде всего, постройкой желаемых добывающих и производственных предприятий.  Скажем, на одной из планет слишком много сырья – постройте на соседней фабрику по производству потребительских товаров и вуаля, у вас новый рынок сбыта сырья! Таким образом можно искусственно создавать новые выгодные маршруты для поставок.
 
[h1]Тонкости бизнеса[/h1]
 
В Interstellar Transport Company множество показателей, без учета которых можно быстро сесть в лужу, в частности,  уровень безопасности, определяющий концентрацию военных патрулей, охраняющих транспортные фирмы от пиратов, которые так и норовят лишить корабли их товаров. Уровень безопасности повышается за счет специальных зданий, которые требуют поставок вооружения, которое еще надо где-то производить.
 
Также каждая планета относится к вашей компании по-разному. Показатель этот зависит от количества поставляемых товаров, наличия локального офиса и состояния планеты в целом.
 
И, конечно же, если хотите выжить своих конкурентов с рынка, будьте готовы к тому, что придется учитывать потребности колоний, ибо у них постоянно что-то случается. Нехватка еды приведет к голоду, стихийное бедствие потребует срочной поставки разнообразных товаров. Игнорирование их потребностей приведет к банальному вымиранию колонии, впрочем, печалиться не стоит, ведь довольно скоро очередной колониальный корабль завезет новую порцию жертв … эээ … в смысле, потребителей.
 
[h1]Прогресс не стоит на месте[/h1]
 
Ощущение прогрессирования по игре не выражается лишь в толщине кошелька, но и подкрепляется системой исследований. Постройка на планетах научных станций приведет к накоплению специальных очков, за которые производится покупка улучшений: новых кораблей, возможности межзвездных путешествий и самого страшного оружия транспортной коммерции на данный момент – дронов. Древо технологий достаточно прямолинейно, количество же технологий скудно.

 
[h1]Красив ли космос?[/h1]
 
Не в данном случае. Графическое исполнение игры очень простое, большую часть времени вы будете лицезреть снующие по карте разноцветные метки транспортных кораблей, а также большой ассортимент графиков и цифр.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1802137051
Звуковое сопровождение вполне приемлемое, хотя не отличается каким-либо разнообразием или уникальным антуражем.
 
[h1]Проблемные моменты[/h1]
 
Interstellar Transport Company обещает нам реалистичный бизнес-менеджмент, и в целом справляется с этой задачей, однако некоторые недоработки все же  имеются.
 
Во-первых, субсидирование колонии путем постройки добывающих и производственных предприятий само по себе не дает никакого дохода. Да, вы создаете новый рынок сбыта или источник товаров для поставки, но скажите мне, какая компания в здравом уме «бесплатно» построит кому-то предприятие?
 
Во-вторых, хромающий баланс. На текущий момент самым лучшим способом транспортировки и получения колоссального дохода выступают дроны. Спешное прогрессирование и исследование 3 тира дронов приведет к превращению локальной звездной системы в паутину, из которой очень быстро будут вытеснены все оппоненты. Забудьте про межзвездные перелеты, когда есть маленькие роботы, летающие со скоростью света и не требующие ремонта.

В-третьих, скучное древо технологий. Честно говоря, оно настолько не разнообразно и прямолинейно, что возникает вопрос о целесообразности его существования.
 
В-четвертых, нехватка глубины некоторых механик. Предположим, по вашему недосмотру вымерла колония, что же будет? А ничего – прилетят новые поселенцы, и репутация у вас с ними будет отличная. Откровенно говоря, не хватает некой общей репутации, которая динамически воздействовала бы на все колонии сразу, а для того, чтобы игра не вынуждала поставлять все и всем, требовалось бы сначала заключать с колониями договора на поставку.
 
[h1]Итог[/h1]
 
[b]Плюсы:[/b]
+ Неплохая система бизнес-менеджмента.
+ Гибкий инструмент построения маршрутов поставки.
+ Большое разнообразие средств транспортировки со своими плюсами и минусами.
+ Хороший выбор сложности, позволяющий как научиться, так и столкнуться с испытаниями.
+ Мультиплеер.
 
[b]Минусы:[/b]
- Скучное древо технологий.
- Некоторым механикам не хватает глубины проработки.
- Баланс, в частности, дроны, которые превращают вторую половину игры в наблюдение за смертью конкурентов.
 
Interstellar Transport Company – хорошая игра про менеджмент с большим количеством цифр и графиков, но в которой хотелось бы увидеть еще больше механик и больше возможностей.
 
Моя оценка: 7 из 10. Достойная игра, заслуживающая внимания, тем более, в ней есть мультиплеер.

The first few hours were fun. Micro some ships here, a route there... But once you reached the stage where you get intrasystem drones, all routes become irrelevant and drones handle everything on their own. Interstellar travel is not worth it, since you barely make profit, and that with all tech unlocked and all ships available. At least in my experience.  I got all (ten) achievements in about 10 hours, which could have been faster if I hadn't ballsed up my first game. In the second game I got the (final) 100.000.000 casherino achievement by waiting for my drones to do it for me. I didn't own a single ship once I had 2 or maybe 3 level 3 drone hubs (they cover the entire solar system).

The concept of the game is great. But it feels unfinished. As if it was still in early access, which I usually avoid like alpha or beta versions, or the plague.

For a release title, this game lacks content. The tech tree is sparse, so is the roster of ship types. And the UI needs work, I'll leave it at that. I wish there was Steam Workshop support, because all you nerds usually fix games like this. Giggity.

I played 10 hours, and at least 5 of them I watched Netflix and waited for drones to do drone stuff. I spent roughly 17€ during the summer sale, and I feel like I overpaid. I want to recommend, but I can't.

Firstly, one must counter the learning curve that comes with this game. In my first run, it was the sheer idea of supply and demand I had to overcome, and inevitably I fell behind the other two ai companies immediately. In my second run, it was the idea of economic bubbles, and how to save enough capital to avoid spiraling after a bubble bursts. I focused and still do focus on the raw materials to consumer goods trade, and in my second run I burst the bubble by no longer needing raw materials on the home planet, and then not having enough capital to reinvest elsewhere. On my third run, although I ran into the issue early game of not focusing on drones or quantity of ships, I managed to late game bankrupt the other companies, establish multiple artificial raw material bubbles, and end with a 50 year total of around 500 million net worth, which positioned me at #14 on the leaderboard (which I assume is for the system of which I started, this is something I hope can be expanded on via tooltips.)

the game needs to be rebalanced to speed things along and more things need to happen. right now theres no events that require you to interact with them in any way at all in order to keep you engaged with the game. the money generation is so slow, it just kills any enjoyment of you wanting to expand to different solar systems. one of the achievements says to reach $100,000,000. i can barely reach $5,000,000 without sitting around DOING NOTHING waiting for hours. in order to make more money, you need to replace your older ships with bigger ones but in order to do that, you need to save up. if your in the late game with upwards of 15 ships per route going from earth to another planet and back, thats hours of just sitting around waiting. i hope you can catch a theme here. you do nothing but sit around waiting for a number counter to get bigger.

Original Thumbs-Down Review:
I've been looking for a game like this for a while. Unfortunately, this isn't it. There are some horrible bugs. Since profit margins are fairly tight (which is nice), an unfortunate bug can end your game for you if it happens on the wrong route (which is not nice). There is also a fair amount of missing automation or more automation than there is automation logic, depending on how you look at it. I can't play the game without getting angry at its flaws, so I can't give a thumbs up.",1559781055,1629848532,False,0,0,0.56619715690612793,0,True,False,False,False,,1561530688.0,"Hi Haapy, I hope you can give the game another look.

Furthermore if you really try to play and expand your trading empire just for the heck of it, by trying to conquer interstellar systems, performance issues kick in and the game starts lagging. Even with a high end gaming setup.

I really liked the early game. This game does have potential. but it's still at early stage of development. Towards mid and end game, it all starts to become a micro management hell with the ships and shipping lanes. Personally I experienced bad UI bug issues, which forced me to constantly restart game every time I wanted to use the dropdown menu to change shipping routes of ships (the menu becomes transparent and always on, so you can't see what route you'd choose).

Research options quickly top out while you're still at the starting home Earth system, with the first maxed research stations you can build. You don't really get to use any of the intermediary ship types; they expire before you can buy them. Some tuning required here.

Once interstellar colonies open up, Earth starts to be so populated, that it requires a special energy generating resource ""Stellarium"" to function. Stellarium can only be found in interstellar systems. But not having it available at Earth or other systems which become highly populated, causes their development status drop from 100% to 0%. That means that in mid-end game when Earth becomes populated, and it doesn't have enough of this Stellarium, all the production of the planet falls to zero. There's no middle ground, you just lose all the productions, of which many other of your systems might depend on.

Now, when the Stellarium crisis happened with my game, I was going to maybe just call it quits. But then tried to get a supply running from the closest interstellar system with a Stellarium source. I did get it running, in the end. However, the Stellarium requirement to keep Earth running is currently so huge, that my supply route from that interstellar planet to Earth is now 203 ships. And pretty much all of those are the last researched ship type Cochin Saagar, which costs $3.3mil to buy. That ship has 205 cargo bays to ferry Stellarim and take time to travel through the light years, while Earth alone has a ~500 deficit at population of 10bil. And same for other highly populated planets.

Once you get the Stellarium shipping set up with about 200 ships, and then start to use your profits to expand into other interstellar systems just for the heck of it, the game starts lagging badly at around 400 ships total.

All the resource production in the game is currently unbalanced. Meaning that one source and factory is usually enough to produce ridiculous amounts of resources, enough for the whole system. Regardless of the resource availability percentage assigned to each planetoid. You just need one source per star system to distribute from, and can disregard the rest (besides food/water), even if the availability % is low. You'll end up with ridiculous stockpiles of millions of resources that can't be used. Food and water balance seems ok to me, and you'd need to hunt down planetoids rich in either to supply an interstellar system much later on (if the gameplay ever went that far).

In my game there's no positive luxury resource production. Earth and one other planetoid in all the systems having a positive value for Luxuries Availability %, however Earth consumes about 5 times more than in can produce. Which means no luxuries anywhere after early game. And one of the game features Weaponry requires luxuries to produce. Although I haven't really noticed any adverse effects of any place not having a supply of weaponry. I did see some messages skip by at bottom of screen, about piracy or something, but didn't catch it.

Late in my game I noticed it's easy to 'cheat' for much more money, by sponsoring multiple robotics factories on a planet. Which use Machinery and Consumer Goods as resource. Consumer Goods especially is very easy to generate in abundance by most planets. So you'll just have a drone distribution hangar on a planetoid with Consumer Goods in the same system as the planetoid with multile robotics factories, and you keep racking up crazy revenue for delivering Consumer Goods at high cost for the robotics factory. Which in turn just churns up robotics into a gicantic stockpile, never to be used. This is one fault of a trading game; that you can get infinitely paid well to produce something that'll never get used. Where does that capital come from?

After all this rant, like I said in beginning I DID enjoy playing this game. And don't think it a bad investment for the asking price. But there's a lot of development work to be done still, to call this a finished game.

For example there is no end game yet. You just finish all the research early on, and then fight to keep Earth running after they decide they'll need Stellarium to keep it going. Then you can expand to other interstellar systems, to have something to do. But this colonizing for the principle, and keeping big planets running just to keep the species alive regardless of profit, is not that much in region of running just a trading company for profit.",1559758061,1559758061,False,12,0,0.643122375011444092,2,True,False,False,False,,,

《星际运输公司》（Interstellar Transportation Company）是一款以宇宙为舞台的Sci-Fi物流企业模拟游戏游戏，玩家经营一家太空运输公司，为边际宇宙各个角落的人类提供生存必需品。玩家必须妥善管理太空飞船、运输路线、殖民地、公司金融和组织架构，击败自己的对手，本作的采用坚实的科学理论基础，利用算法生成浩瀚的银河系，打造真实而且新鲜的星路地图，每次游戏都绝不相同。

[h1] 游戏体验和感想[/h1]
 [*游戏设立在2050的太空，人类文明超高度自由，我们需要在每个恒星和每个行星之间建立基站和规划路线购买太空船进行物资运输并且在星球上建立建筑物，星球上需要各种各样的建筑，可以看到食物，水，矿物，稀有资源和人口等等，你需要吸引更多的星际游民来赚钱同时和对手公司竞争击垮他！多人模式BUG比较多，不太完善所以主要对抗AI有快速竞赛和自定义游戏两种模式。游戏除了界面中文游戏里几乎没有中文仅有的一些中文也像乱码似的，所以教学难懂英语不太好的玩家需要全程手持谷歌翻译，也称得上比较硬核了。
 [*每天上课和晚上睡觉，总是幻想着无穷无尽的宇宙感觉感觉整个人都飘到天空里遨游，如果人在太空里不会因为真空被压强压到爆炸也不会憋死，那我们就可以飘在太空里想去那就去那，那才是真正的环游世界。虽然有些中只制作了一个类似于银河系大小并且建模质量较为简陋，但也不影响你尝试着在浩瀚无垠的太空体验到星际文明。如果真的要做出整个宇宙我觉得还是不太可能吧，比较宇宙是无限大的

I think this game is a great effort, and I didnt experience bugs, but quality is lacking in areas besides production values.

As someone who wanted to like this game, I can't recommend it until the underlying design itself receives more polish.  The choice to use a full 3d map doesn't really seem to have paid off well.  Too many things are in the game that don't improve it, including UI buttons, mechanics, ships, technologies, etc.

Too many gameplay mechanics do not add to the experience, I believe these are things that seemed like good ideas but as currently implemented they detract from some combination of fun or intuitive-ness of the rules.  Not enough tools to deal with organizational challenges.  And the UI definitely has issues, a large amount of real estate sometimes is claimed to display very little information (though some windows are better designed than others)

I played on a harder difficulty and on my second game, I researched the first ship upgrade and took out a loan to buy 2, the AI players were no longer competitive after that (not that I would have understood why I was being out-competed with the current design) and I blew through a surprising amount of the tech tree with only two not-upgraded research stations.

1.01B Edits: These changes added about 2.5 hours more total play interest for me. 

This game got off to a rough start with me, so this review will, too, but there's good stuff at the end. The tutorials, while on point as far as they go, don't seem complete, and there doesn't seem to be a way to reset them like you can with Stellaris or other games. There's no manual or wiki I've been able to find and so there's no ""RTFM"" for a newb. You get one shot at the tutorial tips, it seems, and then it's in to the deep end with you.

Also challenging is that a major technological shift occurs mid-game with no notice about it's game ending implications. At some point your planets will start demanding a resource called stellarium, and if you don't have it ready before you need it, you are essentially forced to manage the logistics of an interstellar collapse as your home worlds starve for lack of it whereas just a few years ago they were fine without it. Since I saw no messages about this change and it wasn't a consequence of my research, this particular technological bridge required me three restarts to figure out what the hell had happened and how to deal with it.

Technically, this game puts a far greater load on your graphics card and its memory than the graphics really warrant. They're not that impressive but still overheated my NVIDIA 1080 whereas battlefield V, ARMAIII, and Stellaris do not. I think they need streamlining of their resource demand, but truly, if you're spending your time watching the pretty spaceships fly by, you're doing it wrong anyway. I turned my graphics down to ultra low and that makes the game time elapse a lot faster without heating up my GPU to 82 degrees.

Once you jump that stellarium technological hurdle there doesn't seem to be much to do rather than farm out all the remaining stellarium in your galaxy and watching your civilization starve at a much later date. The tech tree stops early and there isn't a lot to do except more of the same that got you that far.

That being said, the fact that this is a hard game about logistics, something that most games ignore in the pursuit of bigger explosions and bustier heroines, and the fact that it challenges me is part of its charm. Many other games go to easy on me, but not this one: it forces me to think ahead and redo rather than get by with lazy or ignorant decision making. I feel sharper for having played it, and I have spent about 30 hours on it so far and will enjoy playing more once they've expanded the tech tree and added more late game. 

I've paid a lot more money for games I've played a lot less, and I think 20-25 is about the price point that's right as it stands. The developers are responsive, but they would do themselves a service by supplying good documentation or a guide for the game so they don't have to spend developer time explaining its mechanics over and over.",1559013484,1559259860,True,56,0,0.817062497138977051,2,True,False,False,False,,,

Pros:

Good Business Simulation
Overall Interesting

Cons:

UI
Tutorial Pop-Ups
Learning Curve


-----======------

The UI is terrible, you get to a point while playing the game where it is super important to pay attention to supply/demand and prices. The UI is either too small and/or doesn't get the right information to the player. It's just clunky and terribly designed. The tooltips don't help much either, other than give broad information.

Overall it seems like a good game, but the AI makes it feel unbearable to play for more than a hour. Also the tech tree feels incomplete or an afterthought. There should be more options, more ships, modifications to stats, upgrades. Also the prices for tech are way too far apart, I find myself just waiting and waiting to get enough points before I upgrade one of my routes to a new ship class.

The tutorial pop-up windows reminded me of the days that I had ""won a free iPad just click here"" ads and would find myself just clicking furiously to close the windows thinking they contained mostly useless information. Some times they were helpful, but they did contain useless information some times or would pop-up more than once for the same subject. I also couldn't figure out how to move ships from one route to a different route, only the ""upgrade option"" which bought a new ship and sold the old one. May be that information was in one of those pop-up's I clicked through, but it was not even remotely obvious in the UI either.",1558991280,1558991280,False,6,0,0.579134464263916016,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Start from one-way supply rockets (Saturn 5 equivalents), all the way into warp-capable transport shuttles (think Fifth Element). In the in-between help the Solar System grow from humble beginnings into an interstellar trade empire, all while competing against AI corporations (or players, but I have not tried that yet).

Think Offworld Trade Company in a much-MUCH larger scale.

The game is set in the future, where humanity is starting to colonize planets and moons in the star system and eventually other star systems. Your job is to make profit by providing colonies resources, which help them develop and grow. That is done by setting up routes between planets and moons, buying ships to routes and setting up cargo holds to ships, pretty much in this order. As the colonies develop, their needs change: Colonies need no more food, if they can grow it themselves, or machinery to help to develop planet, if it is already fully developed. However, consumer goods and other resources are then needed.

-----Original post (please see updates as this is deprecated, but funny) ----




An unenthusiastic thumbs up.

The UI is not independent of screen resolution.  People have been beheaded in other countries for writing a UI like this.  It's really quite bad.

You see this programmer from Renaissance times?  She wrote a bad UI too.  Okay?
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1234096904

The UI problem in Interstellar Transport Company has 2 (clunky, unintuitive) workarounds, so I'm probably over-reacting.  But as long as it's like this - it will nag at me and eventually I'll just uninstall out of sheer contempt.  For $25 a customer should expect a better game-play experience than this.  There's this first moment of realization, when a screen pops up and it's TINY, and there's a feeling of ""oh my god this game is shit!"" which is followed by ""do I need to ask for  refund?""  Yeah that feeling.  Then there's the feeling ""am I going to have to adjust this screen size every time I open this window?  Are you serious?""  Try to avoid giving players these feelings, because they remember it, and they paid good money for now having something to complain about.

HINT: Most game engines have tools for making UI independent of screen resolution.  Let's take Unity, for example:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-UIMultiResolution.html

I really hope this is fixed eventually.

Otherwise - I like the game-play.  It plays very much like a railroad sim, only without the railroads.  The learning curve is not bad.  The AI opponents are apparently fixed in their starting endowments, so if you try to play with fewer funds at the beginning, prepare to never catch up to the AI opponents.

However, there's no stock market that I've found anyway - and really no sense that I can buy out or be bought out.  This is kind of nice, though hopefully the option will eventually be there to allow buyouts.  As it is, you can do you, and your opponents can do their thing, and we really don't step on each other's toes very much, other than the limited real-estate available on a planet.

The immersion is pretty good - but then again, I really like these kinds of games.  Your mileage may vary.  This is (like all other economic sims) ultimately a beautiful clicker.  Watch everything move around and wait until you have the funds and figure out how you want to spend them.

Let's hope it keeps improving.

Current Annoyances: (go read the game news to see if these have been fixed)
-AI is a bit dumb. Early on, you can monopolize the Mars port completely, but the AI will send ships anyway wasting money on ships that will orbit uselessly while you rake in the spacebucks.
-Odd tutorial. Windows opening bring up a little explanation of how to use it, but that also happens in the tutorial which can make it confusing as to what you should be doing. Since there are two sets of instructions. 
-Window behavior. The tutorial shows how you can resize windows! But it turns out you can't do all of them! But wait, there's a UI scale in the options menu--that will let you scale some things off the screen and make it hard to click a button in the lower right if there is no button. Even better still, some windows can have their scaling changed by both methods. Some windows also like to open up partway off the screen even after you reposition them.
-Zero assistance outside the tutorial and little info screens. This is the big one for me that drops this to 'tentative' rather than 'go for it'. For the window resizing, the only way to tell which method changes window size is trial and error. I've also like to be able to assign ships to other routes as better ones become available and have seen that mentioned in the discussions. [b]How[/b] to do that?

Things do not make sense in the grand scheme of interstellar space development.
- Earth finds a colony at Mars, Mercury, Ganymede etc.. Probably spends an exorbitant amount of resources to do that.  Then everything is left to a few transportation companies to take care of all supply? So you can lease all the ports and disable everyone from trading with this colony?? For a total of $5000 a month? Why would the founder planet or the colony planet allow this?? So you can starve them and drive up prices? That is just dumb.  Leasing a landing port should include requirements for the transportation of essential goods for the survival of the colony for a fixed (or at least minimum) profit margin.  It may not be the most profitable thing to transport food, but you should be forced to do it to retain your contract. 
- To further elaborate on Contract:  Everything is first come, first pick up, first deliver basis.  That is idiotic.  No company will ever do trade or transportation without an established contract or market. Goods should be carried through contacts, and requirement should be satisfying that contact. Ships should be purchased and allocated to honor the contract. Not on a constantly changing economic climate, or varying passenger rates, etc. Trying to deal with constant change results in insane amounts of micro management. It cannot create a fun game if the scale gets much bigger than a few planets.
- Another item that does not make sense is the transportation of food and water.  Those should be always produced at the planets easily to support a core population anyway. Why would a colony allow itself to be overpopulated when it does not make enough food for itself?  How hard is it to make water on a planet when you have the technology for ""interstellar transport"". Hydrogen is the most common element, Oxygen is the third most abundant. So I need to carry them in liquid form from Earth to the other planets. Right. Why don't I carry machines that make water on that planet instead?  Same with food.. You cannot grow because you're too far from an energy source?  Bring nuclear reactors to that planet and generate energy. Or bring geothermal equipment to generate energy.. Why would you carry basic things?  You should be transporting valuable raw materials that cannot be processed into refined forms, refined forms of valuable raw materials, machinery, equipment, tools, reactors, medicine, computers and luxury items etc.  Exotic foods can be an item to transport, but generic ""food"" not so much.  Transporting simple bare necessity items in an interstellar era and allowing entire planets suffer and millions die due to the shortage of ""water"" or ""food"" makes no sense to me.
My conclusion is that, I don't know if this game is trying to be deep or shallow.  I'm not sure if it is trying to simulate some post single planet economic model or not.  The current model is too simple and lacks any sort of depth to reflect anything even slightly futuristic. It does not even have the depth of 1994 Colonization in terms of colony building, raw materials, finished goods etc. I don't understand what the ultimate goal is either.. Remain profitable? Own items and keep on making investments? get richer and richer and richer,,, forever?
Unless there is a major overhaul of game concepts, I don't see this becoming anything enjoyable, anything with reasonable realism, or anything with a borderline acceptable economic model.  Might become a massive grind out and micromanage type of game with no real goals.  I'm not even talking about bugs and things that are not working properly either.

Peu de chose réellement à rajouter à mon évaluation précédente faite dans l'EA.
A aujourd'hui c'est un de mes tycoons préféré. La version finale est bonne, la traduction en français s'est énormément améliorée. Les devs écoutent encore et toujours la communauté (qui est souvent très exigeantes) améliorant le jeu régulièrement, corrigeant tout rapidement. C'est un digne héritier de Transport Tycoon, mais avec une vision spatiale. Et le développement du jeu n'est pas fini, beaucoup d'amélioration vont encore venir


Première évaluation :
Le jeu est toujours en accès anticipé. mais il progresse. Je pense que le studio de dev est un petit studio. Ils écoutent la communauté et apportent les évolutions petit à petit.
Au moment ou je rédige cette évaluation, le jeu a progressé. Ils ont lissé les graphismes des menus, par exemple. Le jeu souffre encore de quelques ralentissement de temps, en temps, surtout lorsqu'on commence à avoir une cinquantaine de vaisseaux.
Ce tycoon est plus qu'un simple transporteur de l'espace. C'est un jeu de stratégie, de management très pointu. Il m'a fallu de nombreuses parties pour en réussir une et atteindre le premier pallier des achèvements, à savoir atteindre les 1 million de dollars en liquide.
La gestion des flux se fait au jour le jour, car les prix des ressources demandées sur chaque planetoide varient régluièrement et c'est ce que personnellement je trouve géant. Il faut toujours rester à l'affut. On pense devoir envoyer des dizaines de fusée sur Titan, alors qu'il faut d'abord se focaliser sur la lune, puis mercure, les planètes et lunes les plus proches, avant de partir plus loin, car le coût en carburant des longs voyages englouti les profits, avant de pouvoir accéder à des vaisseaux consommant moins de carburant.
je recommande ce jeu si vous rechercher un challenge.
Oui le jeu n'est pas encore parfait, puisqu'il est toujours an accès anticipé, mais il est pas mal traduit en français, encore quelques mots non traduits, mais cela ne gène pas et personnellement j'y prend beaucoup de plaisirs. En plus de nouveaux vaisseaux, arbres technologiques vont arriver bientôt.

For a game that touts itself as having realistic business mechanics, the economics of this game are the farthest from reality I have seen in a business sim/space sim. Unbalanced AI and extremely poor optimization (and game visuals that further cripple it), make me wonder if this game will ever be worth it.

The Long:

Most of my initial 2 hours of playing was mostly frustrated restarting, not out of difficulty learning the game, but trying to find settings that actually worked without crippling stuttering. As someone who plays Stellaris and Civ games with the largest possible maps and max players with little to no lag, I was surprised that the only setting that wasnt annoying to play  on was the equivalent of setting everything to 30%. Anymore than 30 star systems and 4 players total, was just bad. This should have sent red flags to devs long ago, and I'm hoping they are fixing it.

My big grievance with this game, and the core reason I won't recommend it, is that currently the economic mechanics of this game are just idiotic. Here is the breakdown of why I think that:

1. I can pay a massive sum to colonize a planet, but I can't block my competitors from using that planet. I get absolutely no money from that colony in return.

2. I can subsidize and build factories, I get absolutely no income from those factories. My competitors can use the resources produced by those factories, and I can too, but I have to pay for them.

3. Distance does not seem to be calculated in the price of goods sold, which, if this is really aiming to just be a transport company game, is illogical. I know when I use Fedex, that shipping to Antarctica is the same price as shipping within my home state (sarcasm).

In simple, there is no reason to colonize or build infrasture. Wait for the AI to do it, then go for it. This is not how economies work. This saps all interest from the game for me. The current mechanics are like a communist tried to make a game focused on capitilism, with the main idea being ""If you have money, you should spend it so everyone can use the fruits of your labor, including all your competitors for free of charge and 100% of the expense on you, you will not be compensated for you work comrade.""

I'm a business owner in real life.. If someone came to me and asked me to build a factory, that my competitors would utilize, and I would get no direct income from, I would laugh in their face. Calling this game economic realism is flat, false advertising unless there is some major mechanic upgrades and changes on the way.

Pros & Cons

Pros -

Graphics - The games does a great job of various planets and vessels.
Procedural Generation - I never encountered a system that was the same as the last

Cons -

Extremely poor game optimization
Nonsensical and unrealistic economics
Unsustainable large amounts of micromanaging


",1539008943,1539008943,False,27,2,0.63280034065246582,12,True,False,True,False,,1539039953.0,"Hi Ritsuka, thank you for your feedback and for your support!

Firstly, performance is something that is hit or miss for people, many can run 40 systems with no issue and have mediocre PCs, a few have issues with 20 systems on low settings.  I'm sorry you ran into this, we are working on locating the issue and correcting it.  The biggest factor on performance is the number of star systems.  We're thinking of limiting it to maybe 25 or 30 systems since any more really can cause headaches performance-wise and there's really no gameplay advantages to having more systems than that.  We're working on it.

Next I want to address your issues with subsidizing factories and colonies..  Colonizing a planet gives you a large reputation bonus which is important.  Also it opens up a market that wasn't available previously and if that is advantageous to you, that's great, if not colonizing is worthless.  You are not playing a government, you have no permission to block people from using resources on a planet etc...  You are a company focused on transportation which brings me to my second point.  Subsidizing a factory does not mean you have constructed it and are reaping benefits from it directly, you simply subsidized an industry.  Again if that's something that would benefit your transportation business, great, if not, don't do it.  All that being said, we are looking at maybe giving players ~25% of the goods produced by industries they subsidize since this is a serious issue and flaw in the system and can lead to frustration and confusion.  As you said, it's also not all that realistic.  From a gameplay standpoint we really want to make sure the player is focused on transportation though, not managing personal colonies and industries.  It's just too messy and exploitable otherwise.

Also you mentioned distance not directly influencing prices, this is true and definitely intentional.  If you've played TTD, it was easy to ""exploit"" that game's pricing systems, ignore the close markets and just focus on the longest distance transportation possible.  This definitely isn't how things work in reality.  If a market was ignored they would pay more for the goods to be transported to them and more for the goods.  While it's not 100% realistic to only use supply / demand on the price of transportation it is far more realistic than TTD's method and makes for much more ""realistic"" pressures on the player when deciding where to setup new routes etc...  EVERYTHING in ITC is based on supply / demands and it makes for a very interesting simulation IMO.

Finally you mentioned micromanaging, this is definitely true in mid and late game!  We will be adding in autonomous transportation options in the coming months.  There will be more info on it in November most likely.

I hope when we approach full launch I can get you to take another look at the game and hopefully turn this review around!  Keeping our players happy is very important to us."

(most of the time you will be sending (spamming?) rockets to help planets developpment, but the thing is you have to send them one buy one, instead of beeing able to schedule departures i.e., and you will do that most of the time because you can't make profitable trade route out of those planet yet.

Pero siendo sinsero lo unico que le faltaria al juego es (y lo van a implemetar) es un poco de politica pero no para ti si no de distintas naciones por ejemplo, no voy a vender a la tierra pra poderme aliar con marte, pero como te enermistas con la tierra ahora han cerado tus puestos controlados por ellos lo cual es un gran probema para tu compania la cual tenia un gran negocio en la luna (minerales raros) y titan (combustible futurista) y ahora tu unca solucion para solucionar ese gueco y no dejar que la competencia te gane es desarrolar la olvida europa (luna) la cual con gran esfuerto y dedicasion (ademas de dinero) podria algun dia asercase a la producion de titan (con el combustible) y para los recursos raros es un grave problema ya que son muy raros (pero que sorpresa) en el sitemas solar, pero mira alli lo que parece una estrella. venus es probre venus el cual nunca colonizan un mar de estos recursos raros, pero no esta colonizado... pues no hay otra cosa mas que hacerlo tu mismo (se puede hacer a dia de hoy) una ves despues de largo años las ciudad flotantes de venus se alsan como grande metropolis pero mirando tu hermosa creasion, porque e yo de estar bajo estos gobiernos, si al fianal de cuenta no eres menos que ellos mirad venus es la viva pruba de ellos, y fue en ese dia en el que desides hacer historia, y fue en ese instate en el cual bajo ese msimo despacho fundarias la replublica mercatil de solaris heredero de la estir de las antiquisima genova, lubek o la misma venecia (en resumida cuentas que llegues a controlar planetas, pero al estilo del que lo hicieron las replublicas mercantes de la baja edad media, controlan la economia pero no la politica)

la unica verdadera que seri que refien los sistemas solares aleatorios ya que es raro ver algunos planes o lunas que van contra el resto o que deves en cuando se chocan (las orbitas se entirceptan) y que no estan ordenasos de caliente a frio (ha un panetade lava le toca una luna de hielo) y talves algo como grandes eventos, por ejemplo una gran dessatre en la tierra que oblige a evacuar la mayoria de la ploblacion o un gran descubrimiento en europa lo cual detone de forma masiva la vanta de un determinado producto, es desir que se pueda ver que la tierra tiene rivales (trasladar tu compania a marte (como base de operaciones)) o incluso que esta (la tierra) pase a segundo plano y no rente mas a que todas las rutas espaciales lleguen a la tierra

You have to work alot with company reputation and pin the planets were you want yourself to be the most popular company.

Alternatives is always to reebuild ship, sell ship or maby just send it on another route.

Interface windows are too big, to they blocks main gameplay screen. If I open planet info, route list, and spaceship list, they fill up my screen so I can't see anything going on my transport network.
It would be much better if windows are resizable or font size can be adjusted.

2) Poor abstraction of cargo system
Let's think of the legendary Transport Tycoon. They have cities and industries. Industries will produce fixed goods at fixed rate. All the thing I should to do is to estimate cargo amount, to connect them, and to leave them doing well.
This game provide several types of cargo, which supply and demand is dynamically fluctuating over time. This means I must check the efficiency of previously made routes regularly. This is pain to me because it blocks me from making my new route to Titan. Because there is an AI competitor, I even can't take full control the supply condition.
That is why i said ""poor abstraction"". I can't control all the details simulated in a game. I need proper level of abstraction of reality, so I can play with it.
For me, transportation simulation game is to continuosly expanding my transport network while old routes are doing well as is. Old routes can be reivewed after 10 or 20 years when the vessels are aged and complete route redesign is required. This is because of good abstraction in game design about all the complicated details of the route management.
Some sort of automation of route control would be another solution to that.

3) Too many possible routes
Traditional 'terran' transport games have terrain factor, which limits route construction attempt between spots. This is obstacle for players, but also helps player to limit possibility of routes that could be constructed.
In this game, we came to space, so there is no obstacle. this yields too many possible routes to player.
Earth to Luna is OK. Earto to Mars? Fine. What about Mars to Luna? What about Calisto to Titan? This comes to N:N matching problem. I don't think human player can accurately decide what is the best route among those possible routes.
Some kind of mechanics should be there to limit route design. For example, hub-and-spoke design can be promoted by limiting interplanetary route in some ways.

In summary, this game is awesome, and well simulates real space transportation mechanics. However, it is too complicated to follow as a gameplay, and poor UI hinders it even more.
If there is a real space transportation company consists of several route managers and I'm just CEO, I can control it. In this game, I must do my role as CEO while doing regional route managers' task also. It's too hard for me, and it is beyond entertainment.

I really anticipate further improvements in this game.

这是一款以太空为背景的模拟经营型策略游戏，玩家需要扮演一家星际运输公司的老板，规划线路，殖民和建设星球，并买船进行各种资源货物的运输工作，赚取利润并击败你的竞争对手。

笔者玩过的模拟经营类游戏不多，所了解的大都如开罗游戏，过山车大亨，天际线这种比较有名的。而这款游戏玩法着重于线路规划和资源调配，具体玩法和游戏性笔者将在下面一一进行分析。

画面与音乐：
游戏由Unity引擎开发，画面是简约风格的，模型较为简陋。当然这种模拟经营游戏的卖点并不在于画面，过于绚丽的效果反而会影响玩家的操作。游戏的界面设计比较简洁，玩家可以方便快捷的辨识和操作。音乐比较单调，但属于不易感到烦躁的那种，把原生BGM关了换网易云后台放自己喜欢的音乐完全可以，不会对游玩造成影响。总体上中规中矩吧。

性能与优化：
游戏程序支持64或32位系统，仅看最低配置对内存有一定要求。实际游戏过程中，CPU占用大概在10%-25%，属于低要求。而内存消耗前期不高，随着游戏进行，可以达到4G多，可见内存占用是比较厉害的。同时，优化也存在一定问题，前期很流畅，随着游戏进行，帧数会缓慢下降，游戏后期帧数不足30而且不稳定，甚至有时会跌到个位数。

玩法与游戏性：
大体玩法，规划路线-买船运输赚钱-建设已有星球，分配资源生产-殖民新星球，反复在这一过程中赚钱，需要统筹规划各个方面，同时与对手公司竞争。获胜条件，击垮竞争对手，使其亏损负债最终倒闭，胜利后仍然可以继续玩下去，无尽地赚钱。多人模式BUG很多，还不完善。所有目前主要是对抗AI，有快速竞赛和自定义游戏两种模式。教程很基础，经过几个引导关卡后就初步上手了。然后在正式的游戏中慢慢体会经营规划的精妙之处。单人游戏可以虽然暂停和调节时间流速，这也是经典的设定。亮点在于，不同游戏内资源、资金相关数值模型较为完善，成功而忙碌的管理需求和大量舰船飞行的繁忙场面将带给玩家满足和充实感。也许初期并不吸引人，但慢慢发展后会逐渐欲罢不能，和玩《文明》系列有类似的感觉。缺陷在于，内容还比较少，发展模式单一，让人在游玩时间达到一个阀值后缺乏重玩的动力。简单来说，就是前期上手一般，中期沉浸体验良好，后期缺乏重玩价值。

开发与本地化：
EA游戏往往会有两种结局，一个是受众慢慢增加，最终开发者至少能回本，另一个就是“鬼”，没人玩，开发者最后放弃。这款游戏目前处于充满潜力的阶段，开发者对游戏很上心，不断完善内容修复bug，乐于倾听玩家的反馈，更新较为频繁，这个势头是良好的。本地化方面游戏有官方中文，可惜汉化不全且机翻问题严重。笔者强烈建议英文进行游戏。考虑到团队规模，至少等正式版出来后才可能解决了。

总评
+玩法有趣，有挑战性
+模型和数值系统严谨
+世界宏大
-测试阶段存在BUG、优化、汉化等等不完善的方面
-过程缺乏多样性

I wrote a previous review which I removed when the dev told me about some recent updates which would fix many of the issues, and planned to write a new one once I'd played the game with the updates. I can see the user interface has been changed since I last played and now allows you to resize windows which is useful, but there are still improvements I think it needs, such as the ability to copy settings from routes to allow you to set up new ones a bit quicker.

The main issue right now though is how badly optimised the game is. Once you get to the late game, its unplayable. I had to sit in an empty solar system with no GUI windows open to minimise the lag. If I tried sit in the main system, it just constantly stutters. Maybe if there was a way to disable the ship icons it'd reduce the lag a bit. The GUI also becomes very laggy too in the late game. When I'd try set up a new route, I'd click to the planet on the list and it'd take a good 5 or 6 seconds before it'd bring it up. I have a fairly good pc too. I7-7700 with 16GB RAM and a GTX 1060 and a 500 GB SSD. For a game with such basic graphics it shouldn't lag this much. If the only thing they improved was the optimisation to prevent all the lag then I'd be able to recommend the game, despite the not so great UI, but right now once you're sending ships to more than 3 or 4 planets it becomes unplayable.

I really hope the game will be improved because I really like the concept and I did enjoy playing the game during the early game when there wasn't so much lag, but right now I can't recommend it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>Edit<<<< 18/05/2019 

I've taken another look at the game since the developer responded telling me of optimisations and improvements to the game. I've spent another 10 hours on the game now looking at the changes but still can't recommend anyone buys this game.

One of the biggest problems is still the lag. For a game with quite simple graphics, it doesn't run very smoothly at all. I notice there is now a way to turn off competitor ship icons and routes, but cant find any option to turn off my own to try reduce the lag.

Drones are game breaking. Once you get some drone hubs and the tech to allow them to land on any planet without a landing spot then there's not much else left to do.

Luxury resources dont seem well balanced. Earth wasn't even producing enough for itself and I could find no way to improve it. Once you get below the threshhold for transporting them, then you can no longer build weapons (Are they made of solid gold or something?)

Interstellar colonisation also takes way too long. It took hours just to get a planet to 100% development, and even then it would take hours longer to get enough resources to that planet to be able to colonise other planets in the system.

Another huge issue is the auto save feature. They list alphabetically rather than based on the last save that happened, so if you've played multiple games you have to scroll through them. You also cant middle mouse wheel or click a button to move up and down, you have to just grab the bar and move it. It can get very difficult to get to the right save if you have a lot of files there. There were many autosaves (They don't seem to remove older ones) so I decided to delete my save files to clear it up. After finding the location of them, I found almost 3,000 files which totalled to 10gb of space being used up on my hard drive. 

I'd recommend this game if it was £5 or less but for the £19.99 price tag there's far better games you could spend your money on.",1516002948,1558165871,False,0,0,0,3,True,False,True,False,,1558057301.0,"Hi Sarah and Fred, we've made a ton of optimizations to the game and improved just about every other aspect of the game!

If you can stomach a buggy, but fundamentally solid game, if you can deal with savegames corrupting in weird ways, if you can submit bug supports and suggestions, if you like logistics and/or space, I'd recommend it.

The game definitely still has rough edges (it's in early access after all) but the core mechanics are quite solid.

Pros:
* Many ships & cargo types to choose from mean you can try a lot of different ways to make money
* Having a lot of different routes and types of cargo moving around feels really rewarding after scrimping and saving to maximize profits
* I've already lost hours to this game by getting sucked into the fun of min/maxing profits on each of my routes and checking out new ship types. Getting into the flow of the game is very enjoyable, especially once you start seeing profits roll in!

Cons:
* Some of the UI elements aren't very clear, e.g., what does cargo maintenance 90% mean exactly?
* Ships don't haul specific amounts of cargo, e.g., 10 units of food, they just have bulk storage that could be food, consumer goods, rare resources &c. This can make it difficult to know if you're properly meeting demand for a colony or just bringing more resources they're already swimming in.
* Game isn't totally finished, so don't expect a ton of content & new ships after 25 years of in-game time

So I am writing a review to reflect that i expect bugs/ issues in this game and do not class them as a negative feature. So mentions of bugs will not be included in this review, as an Early Access game is not a finished project. 

This game has takes some planning and you really have to follow the market carefully. There are some good guides on You Tube to help new players get started and there is a discord chat where you can report bugs/fixes and ask for advice about the game from the devs or more experienced players. The game community is very friendly and helpful. Someone will always help you out when needed. 

The Devs really care about this game they are making. There are frequent patches to perform bug fixes and improve the game and the devs are available to talk to on the game discord server. They appreciate their players and are listening to us to help improve this game with every patch. 

You supply earth and colonies on planet with colonists, and resources. You compete with Ai companies to supply these items and to start new colonies in our solar system. There is  a choice of rockets and ships and all have stats on fuel efficiency. On new planets you can build a spaceport and then lease space gates for your ships and rockets. There is also multiplayer available in this game, but I have yet to use this feature. On the discord server you will find plenty of people who play multiplayer that you can join. We start in our solar system and there is the capacity for expansion into other solar systems. I can get lost in this game for hours, there are so many possibilities and scenarios that no 2 simulations are the same. 
 All in all I would recommend this game to fans of economy driven games. Give it a try, and you will see how much fun this can be.

This title offers you the opportunity to start out with a small fleet of ships schlepping food and water to the Moon and transform it into a titan of interstellar commerce.  Will you assist humanity in spreading out to colonize the solar system and beyond?  Or will you operate solely to satisfy your own avaricious desire for cash?  Will you pay to found a colony on Titan that can produce fuel to aid the conquest of the stars?  Or will you ship thousands of forlorn colonists out to the barren moons of Neptune empty-handed, then make a mint selling them the food and water they need to survive but are incapable of producing themselves?

The choice is yours, and Interstellar Transport Company leaves the player free to operate in whatever fashion they desire while the AI opponents engage in similar schemes in an effort to undercut, outpace, or overwhelm you.  The overall mechanics of the game are relatively simple, and yet still manage to produce a surprising variety of emergent game play.  No two runs of Interstellar Transport Company feel the same, and yet are similar enough that the basic skills you learn in your first few runs will soon have you wheeling and dealing like Warren Buffet crashing his Ferrari through the main doors of the Bellagio in Vegas.

It is worthwhile to note, however, that the game is still in Early Access.  There are a few bugs that occasionally crop up with some AI behaviors (like not building maintenance sheds to fix damaged ships) and the user interface is a bit counter-intuitive and difficult to use.

I'm glad that you got 100 hours of play (hopefully most enjoyable) from the game in it's early state and am surprised you decided to harm our efforts even further with a negative review.  

We should be out of early access in Summer, the game is constantly changing and improving.  Of course our focus is a great single player game and that is where we spend the vast majority of our time, however, when we reach the end of development and want to finish up multiplayer, it is much easier to do if we have been keeping up with it during development rather than trying to tack it on at the end of our development cycle.  We spend maybe 1 out of every 10 hours of development time now on multiplayer as is, which is extremely little.  Also, keep in mind that multiplayer tests and gameplay often highlight imbalances and issues that would never be visible just playing against AI or alone.

We are doing the best we can, and are very proud of how far we've come so far.  However, the game is in early access, we have stated many times that there will be bugs and that the game is incomplete.  If anyone looking at this game wants a complete, polished and bug free game, please wait for full launch, this game is very much in development.

There is one more playtest to do since this review is up (22/03/2018) but so far multiplayer has come a long long way since my first review.

SINGLE PLAYER :-
Pros:-

Nice speed of gameplay
Challenging AI
Plenty of planets
Beautiful graphics
Plenty to do

Cons:-
5 minutes turn into 5 hours (Consider this a Procon :P)
We should have the ability to build our own Maintenance ships as the standard ones seem far too slow

MULTIPLAYER:-

Pros:-

It Works
Buggy Graphic has been removed.

Cons :- (Sorry)

Multiplayer will/should have the same cons as single player after extensive fixes.


Would I recommend even in Aplha State?

Well yes i would if the Dev keeps up the work and the patches to make it better its a good buy and will spend hours playing in multiplayer Thank you for adding it this early a very risky but good move and it has paid off even in its buggy state

Would I pay full price for it being so early?

Mine was gifted to me. But would i pay £14.99/$17.99 for this particular game with how active the devs are definately now.

Would I recommend this game?

Hell yes lets have an 8 way battle for being the best.

What features I would like to see?

Maybe an option not to start on the same system as other players maybe get a choice of system and planet to start on. Thats if it is possible.
Some R&D to research bigger and better ships and to research warp drives
The ability to create your own ships each ship can only hold so many Tonnes. May be a long shot but just an idea.

Theme. The game brings this out very well. It really feels like you are running the company that is responsible for the interstellar expansion of humanity. The visuals work well. The planets look cool. The ships have fun names. The line of ships you get going from home, out a colony, and back looks good. It is satisfying to see the progress as a colony develops. It feels like you are working to established permanent homes other worlds. 

Strategy. You have a lot of choices. You are always deciding what ships to buy, what they should carry, and what route they should take. You usually have options that are either ""cheaper and better now"" or ""more expensive and better later."" You always have ""things to work on."" You can choose where new colonies will go. You can tinker with current trade routes to make them more profitable.


Good to Mixed:
Balance. The overall balance seems good for what has been released. There are subtle changes that could improve things, and I think the devs have their eye on that. (They have made a few balance changes since the game was released and all the changes were steps in the right direction.) Later game stuff does need more work, and this is on the dev roadmap forward.

Replayablilty: Generally one game versus another does progress in a similar way. You have information about what is needed and you take care of that. If Mars needs more water you buy a new water ship and send it to Mars. You can get a long way just by playing this way. That said, after a few games you understand more of the subtlties and can min/max your trade routes. I find that I enjoy trying to minimize extra costs and squeeze out maximum profit.

The UI. The UI has improved greatly with the latest patch. It seems that this is where the devs are currently focusing. It does take some getting used to, but with the new changes I feel like I have the tools I need.

The AI. I have played a number of games both with AI opponents and as the only company. Honestly, I've never felt like the AI opponents add much to the game. In games with AI opponents, they sometimes help get colonies going a bit faster, but usually I just notice them doing thing that I wouldn't do because it's inefficient. Generally they serve as a minor hinderance. By late game the AI doesn't have much of a presence. For me, the game is less about beating my opponents, and more about establishing a huge interstellar trade network. Whether the AI is present or not only affects that a little. Also, I have found games without AI opponents to be more fun. Without the AI you have more control in things like in fine-tuning demand without causing famine and deciding what colonies should get limited resourses. If playing against a competitive AI is important to you, this game might not be the right choice. If you aren't worried about the AI and your priority it to build up your trade empire, the weak AI won't hinder that. Also try playing without any AI opponents.


Reasons to wait a bit:
Lack of detailed information. Much of the financial numbers are ""under the hood"" at this point. There are ways to estimate the cost of a given trade route if you work it out. The calulations that go into how much a route earns is a mystery. The Devs have said that this is on their radar. 

There are a few bugs (It's still in alpha). The devs have been doing a good job of dealing with these, but some can be annoying. That said, in my last game, there weren't any bugs that prevented me from making progress. 


Overall:
I'm having a lot of fun. The theme is great. Bringing 500 million people to an interstellar Earth-like planet is satisfying. I find that I want to try out new strategies and maximize my income. The devs are working to make the game better, and it is improving. I certainly think it is worth the price in its current state.",1506455331,1506455331,True,16,1,0.615808784961700439,0,True,False,True,False,,,

Also there doesnt seem to be any real reason to spend your own companies money on buildings on a planet as there doesnt seem to be any real positive from doing it besides from being able to sell more of that resource as the planet takes ownership of the building. To me that seems pretty stupid, I spend 290,000 of my own money to find that all ive done is made it that theres more resources on the planet that anyone can buy and I make nothing from it except what I ship myself. would rather spend my money on a ship and buy the resource elsewhere. also I thought you would be able too corner markets or even whole planets but atm it doesnt seem like you can at all, all your doing is buying a ship setting up a route and sending it off to make money to buy another ship and carry on the process without feeling like your accomplishing anything, or getting anything out of it on the whole. also atm your reputation on planets doesnt seem to have any real effect to yourself or the game at first i was buying a  headquarters on a planet thinking it would benefit me but then noticed my reputation was pretty much the same as i was delivering too on planets without a headquarters.

Interstellar Transport Company (ITC) is the second Steam title from indie developers, MT Worlds.

Departing from the developers' previous VR Sports title, ITC is a tycoon-style simulation game set in the near future. Set in 2050, with mankind beginning to colonise the other bodies in our solar system, ITC places you in charge of a fledgling space transport company supporting Earth's expansion.

The game begins with the moon (Luna) and Mars already colonised and with spaceports of varying sizes present on Earth, Luna, and Mars. You choose your company name and colour and then the galaxy is your oyster; purchase docking bays, set up trade routes, and make as much profit as you can while supplying the intrepid colonists with everything they need to survive and prosper on the planets and moons of Sol.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
ITC's graphics are a mixed bag. The planet and ship graphics are pretty, and the seemingly chaotic mess of satellites about heavily inhabited planets is excellent. But the little details, like the security ships with red/blue flashing lights that aren't lights and instead seem to just colour the whole surface of the ship in alternating red and blue, or the weird scale of the ships and space port compared to the planets themselves, detracts. I mean, is the spaceport above Earth REALLY supposed to be as big as Africa!?

The interface is what you'll be looking at most of the time and it's quite large and ugly, with some icons that don't really resemble much (I really hope they're just placeholders!). It's unfortunate that it's confusing, too. Does a button labelled ""disable tooltips"" mean tooltips are currently enabled and clicking on it will disable them? I'm not sure. And why can you zoom out from a planet to reach system level, but zooming back in does NOT take you back to the planet? And you can't zoom out from system level to galaxy level either. ESCAPE takes you from planet to system, too, but not system to galaxy; for that you can only right-click. They're just a few examples. It's inconsistent and rather poor HCI design.

I also noticed a weird anomaly popping up on occasion: a faded red icon floating in space near Earth. I couldn't work out what caused it, but it happened a few times.

There are a few graphics options to play around with. I set everything to maximum and the game moved along smoothly.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
The sound in ITC is pretty lacking, but at the same time I think it's probably sufficient for this type of game. I think there's only one music track: a relatively slow sort of ambient electronic track with assorted electronic sounds and various riffs. I'm thinking ""sci-fi industrial ambient"" might be a new sub-genre to categorise it.

Sound effects are minimal. Interface response bleeps are a bit loud and the bottle-breaking (?) sound when a new ship is built is terrible.

There are no voices.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
I have to confess that after my first hour with ITC I was ready to give it a miss. If I'd bought it and been wondering whether to refund it I would have been on the fence. Then I started reading some more of the tooltips and realised there's a lot more depth than first impressions suggest, and the very limited tutorial really doesn't do it justice. The tutorial explains how some of the more common parts of the interface work, but that's it. It's more like guided technical documentation on a small part of the UI than a proper tutorial.

The game proper begins when you start a new pre-defined or custom game. Though the tutorial recommends the former, I'd suggest the latter might be more fun for beginning players, as it lets you customise the number of AI companies as well as the galaxy size and, importantly, your starting cash. Regardless of which you choose there's an inevitable ""Now what!?"" moment when you begin.

The basic gameplay is very limited. You set up trade routes among the planets and moons that have been colonised and you buy and fit out space ships to ply those routes. And that's it. There are single-use rockets that are cheap and fast to build, and let you deliver resources even if you don't have a space port lease at the other end, and larger multiple-use ships that require a certain level of space port to build, and a lease at a certain level at the other end in order to land. You choose the types of cargo bays fitted when you create a ship and there's no way to change it later.

It was only after I'd been playing for a couple of hours, making tons of money, but becoming rather bored, that I started to wonder what the rather abstract resources I'd been transporting actually represented, and then I discovered the game's hidden depths. Each colony requires people, obviously, but also machinery in order to efficiently produce other goods. Dilithium crystals -- a rather rare mineral, I discovered -- are required for interstellar travel, but you need to find them first.

After I discovered these hidden depths I became far more interested in the game. The early stages are all about positioning your company for further expansion, but with very limited tutorials it was only through distracted fiddling that I found out anything about this. In Sol, everything hinges on Titan. 

Even after this discovery I still felt a bit overwhelmed by the game's deficiencies. I'm sure the developers will make progress -- after all, that's what Early Access is all about. Here's a short list of some of my current complaints, anyway:

- No automatic pause in management or system menus.
- It's easy for your ships to sit there doing nothing. It needs alerts for idle resources.
- It's hard to see a ship's current location.
- Fuel usage isn't explained. How does this work? Does it matter for interplanetary (not interstellar) runs?
- Finding buildings on a planet is more difficult than it should be.
- Orbits always seem to be circular!?
- How does speed affect efficiency. Each ship should have a tonnage/speed efficiency rating.
- What does ""Player Difficulty"" setting mean in a custom game? Surely that depends on the player!? 
- No way to edit cargo bays on an existing ship. Why not?
- No way to ensure a ship is completely full before it leaves; passenger compartments almost always leave empty.
- Can't tell at a glance which resources are going to be picked up and which ones aren't; it's annoying clicking on each resource to check its current settings.
- Ships will launch with some bays empty on their first flight. MAJOR issue.
- No way to specify a save name -- it looks like there should be, but it ignored me and used an autosave slot.
- Everything moves slightly to the left when decreasing time speed or to the right when increasing it.
- Duplicate ship button doesn't work well. Starting point and auto-launch aren't duplicated properly.
- Order ship button sometimes stops working entirely, requiring a restart.

In spite of the frustrations above, and my first impressions -- no research, no ship upgrades, and limited buildings available -- the core mechanics are sound and there's a lot of potential. The balance between transport and production is a good one. If the interface can be fixed and the bugs ironed out, ITC could be a rather impressive game.

[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]
Pros:
+ Hidden depths
+ Some lovely graphics
+ Achievements

Cons:
- Fiddly, ugly, inconsistent interface
- Some depths are too well hidden
- Buggy

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
Interstellar Transport Company has potential, but it definitely needs work. The tutorial is basic and much of the game's more interesting detail is hidden in tooltips. The core gameplay is interesting, but can be slow to start and currently requires too much micromanagement to work around bugs. The UI needs a major overhaul; at the moment basic tasks require too much effort. It's also rather buggy, but in Early Access one has to expect that.

Have put 10 hours into the game across three play-throughs, two of which went past 20 years, both of those having kicked off interstellar colonization.

At this point I'm putting the game down and won't be coming back until some key items are addressed. I'm taking the time to put this together because I enjoy what the game could be and can easily see myself putting another 50+ hours into the game with some minor adjustments. Please take the feedback below in that lens.

The Good:

-Core delivery model - It's Space Truck Simulator 2017, plain and simple. All the right bones are there and when it clicks, it feels very good.
-Theme comes through - I feel like I'm running a logistics company, spread across a harried amount of demands.
-Runs well on my crap laptop - It's a really crap laptop and the game still loads super fast and handles quite well. Exceptions to this are when I'm spamming rockets with the ships and colony screen open, then it goes to crap.
-Not fair - I'm a big fan of hard games that point you to a big wall and let you fall flat on your face. This certainly fits the bill, although there are issues here I'll address below.

The Bad:

-Very limited data transparency - I'll be honest, this is a huge one for me. This is at it's core a market game and we have no view of market prices. Big miss. Going beyond that, there's no view into the variables that impact things. Event (famine, etc.) modifiers, population supply/demand drivers, basic colony supply/demand view, potential growth view, fuel costs, maintenance costs, in transit goods view, company reputation impact, etc. None of this is icing on the cake stuff, it's all core requirements to having a market based game. Look to Paradox games for suggestions on top notch tool tip views.
-Shoddy menu UI - I'm at the stage where I want to murder something every damn time I need to buy a new ship, especially once I'm in the mid-game 100+ ships deep. Let's order three ship copies for an existing delivery line... pause the game so the ship menu doesn't glitch out, find the ship in an unsortable list, duplicate the ship, edit and copy the ship name for consistency, oh it jumped back up to the top now scroll back down, rename the ship and save, oh it jumped back up to the top, let me scroll back down... sigh.
-Terrible AI companies - There's not much to explain here, the AI companies will hold strong on unfair difficulty for the first 5 years or so and then start falling apart. Plenty of demand and money to be made, but they can't seem to make a steady profit beyond that point and collapse like a poorly made flan. This compounds the issue of growing colony needs, as the AI companies won't fill the gaps like they should, leaving it all up to the player.
-No AI replacement or generation - The game doesn't seem to close out failing AI companies and refresh them, nor will it generate new companies on the fly for specific needs. Both of my 20+ year games have ended with only my company ships in the skies.
-Unclear expectations - The game doesn't give you a feel for what's expected by colony. Part of this goes into the above, as the game doesn't outright tell you ""hey man, this planet really can't grow crap, you should really pay attention here,"" it'll just hit you with famines. Not to say it's not an indicator of failure, but it's not readily obvious out of the gate and certainly doesn't give you a feel for what to focus on until you have a game or two of failure under your belt. 
-No menu filtering - What I would give to be able to sort ships by route, or tag ships as certain types (food, passenger, etc.). Finding specific ships to view, copy, replace, etc. is really painful right now.

What's Making Me Walk Away:

-Crap AI companies
-Poor menu UI
-Extremely limited data view

Looking forward to what the game can become, especially after these key issues are addressed, but will be putting it down entirely until then. Completely understand that this is in an early alpha state, and that combined with how much I enjoy the core gameplay is why I'm taking the time to provide this feedback. Hope this helps, for what it's worth.",1504461406,1504461406,False,139,1,0.860953211784362793,10,True,False,True,False,,1558057684.0,Hi there!

simplistically, find surplus, find demand, buy ship, deliver until demand is fullfilled .. create demand on new planets... repeat...

다른 문제는 그래픽및 게임 디자인에 비해 게임이 너무 무겁다는 것이다.

You play as a space trucking company competing against up to 7 others (up to 7 AI in single player games; haven't tried multiplayer yet). Supply and demand drives prices for resources that you need to transport between planets and moons as humanity colonizes the solar system and beyond. Choose different types of ships for your transport fleet based on your needs. Some ships are faster than others, carry more cargo, are more reliable, etc. 

I started off binging on this game as it was alot of fun to get into (and i really like logistics for some reason). I slowed down a bit later, since the game can get a bit repetitive and overwhelming with the amount of ships you have. However, I find myself thinking about new strategies and wanting to test them out, an so I do. There is not a ton of depth, but the game's core seems to be built in such a way that would allow for alot of extra features and such from the devs.

Pros:
-Gameplay is pretty fun with a decent amount of strategy involved.
-Runs well on low-end systems (so I've heard)
-The game's foundation and core lends itself to being expanded upon alot
-Dev team seems extremely active (especially for only 4 people total on the project?) and has released like 4-5 patches in less-than-two week period since the game has been in EA.
-$20 price point seems spot-on.

Cons:
-Can be a bit boring if you're not that into logistics simulation.
-Has some bugs that can be fairly impactful to gameplay (what EA game doesn't?)
-Some UI elements and data transparency needs to have added elements (transaction history, price, etc), but basic UI so far is pretty decent. 

With any early access game, you need to be wary about the product your are buying. However, with the current game state (I still have fun playing it) and the dev activity (extremely active), I have no regrets buying this game and anticipate a lot of cool new features to be added to this game to really flesh out this gaming experience. At $20, this game has already given me more gameplay time than many other $20+ games.

As of now I would probably give this game a 7/10 in its current EA state. I'm looking forward to see how this game progresses and have high hopes for the future.",1503937561,1503937561,True,4,0,0.526627242565155029,0,True,False,True,False,,,

This game has entertained me for over 300 hours during the years of development and it's many stages.

It's final shape is not what I had predicted, but an interesting experience in it's own right. 

There are a lot of things to be adjusted and a bit of a learning curve in regards to how you actually turn a profit - There are financial pitfalls that are easy to fall into if expecting to 'make money just by shipping'.

The supply & demand changes swiftly, so one needs to learn where to find profits and not overflow the markets, difficulty added in by having AI competitors that sometimes try and do just that to cut down your way to make profits.

The game has a really good platform, its interesting, it's fun to expand through your universe and the big leap to the next universe. 

I can say, as of right now, its good, you'll get your money's worth for sure (recommend playing by yourself first go around before throwing in AI)

The intial start is good, it feels immersive enough, you need to watch supply and demand (Earth being your hub for most of the resources you need) then start supplying the other planets as they develop... This will be fun for the first 4-6 hrs but things start to get a bit ""overwhelming"" in a manner. You also need to balance yourself against the AI that is also supplying, affecting demand... it felt like spamming one shot rockets in the beginning was the only way to give yourself a necessary boost of cash to compete easily with the AI, this still seems to to be ongoing throughout the game... spamming rockets to make some extra cash while managing an entire fleet feels like a click fest, speeding up and slowing the game down. 

6hrs or so in, here's the issues you run into...

The game starts to get less personal, you are dealing with bubbles (planets) and floating icons (ships) no detail anymore... this takes away any visual detail the game has to offer. 

You are manually going to each planet (or supply route) ensuring your ships are meeting the correct demand and they are turning a profit, this starts to get slightly exhausting because the UI isn't built efficiently for this. 

The scale of this game is huge and tapping into 1/10 of this game makes you wonder how they will keep the player engaged... you get to a point where you are cycling through planets and maximizing routes and thats it... and that's only 1/10 of the possible management... too much with little reward if at any... unless you just like dots and seeing money rise...

It would be interesting to see where this game goes in 6-12 months... if you want something more finished, I'd definitely wait, they are still tweaking major aspects of the base game while breaking a few things along the way at times.",1503624873,1504184784,True,3,0,0.528301894664764404,3,True,False,True,False,,,

It's a nice looking game, and there's much I like about it. But it has two gaping problems.
The first is depth - you can set up routes and ships to run on them, and fiddle them to make a profit. But once you've done that, it's just an exercise in doing it a bit more, and making a bit more money. There doesn't seem to be a goal. Even the inclusion of AI competitors is a bit shallow - because the AI never stops you from doing anything you might otherwise do. They're just there as decoration.
The second problem the game has is clutter. Most games like this, there are two ways of playing - conservatively where you gradually build up your organisation; or spamming. And whatever mode you play, the AI spams. As a result, very quickly, the shipping lanes are full of ships. Hundreds of them. And caring about the fate of your handful of ships in a universe where they awash with hundreds of other ships is difficult. They just become blocks to build your bottom line, and they essentially disappear.
This is a game in progress, and added depth and reduced clutter may happen down the track.

Pros
its slow. but you have a speed multiplier.
Graphics. are not bad close up, but this game isn't about details of graphics either.
for early access its very playable. and easy to jump into. i haven't even played the tutorial and i was able to get the hang of the game nearly instantly.

Cons. 
The UI needs work. as some destinations/routes you set, the letters literally take up too much space.
Can't rename star systems. though this could change.
not really many other issues, so my cons list is rather small.

It's amazing. It's the most fun I've had in a tycoon-type game since RCT3.

The easy way to make money at the beginning of the game is to bring water, food and colonists to the Moon which kinda becomes your mining place, then choose between sending your raw materials to either Earth or developing a base on Mercury.


Eventually you'll have to colonize Titan for the crystals that are used to get to the rest of the solar system, but that's a bit of a dumpster fire right now in my game because I heavily favor high-capacity ships over fast ships and it's causing famine and drought on Titan and I now have an influx of refugees to Earth. It's fine. I'm a survivor, not a victim.

Two weaknesses:

1) It's early access which means it's got a bug or two. Nothing that caused a crash to desktop, but I did have to restart my game once.

There's a sense of expansion at every step, and there's a sense of grandeur as you build your trading empire. However, if you haven't already figured out, there's really only one path currently to succeed at the game.

Hints if you are struggling to keep away from bankruptcy:

Machine and rare material production simply does not ramp up quickly enough, so it's pointless building machinery cargo on your ships. Right now, machinery is a newbie trap. Let the bots transport machinery, since it will quickly run out on Earth. You can get away with transporting only a small amount to make a little bit at the beginning of the game. Otherwise you will be wasting a lot of cargo room.

Once you unlock Jupiter's moons and the Gorman Dart, you can just transport 30-40% passengers and the rest water/food, and demand for food and water will quickly rise on that moon, activating a subsidy. You can easily just make millions off of it. I found this to be a very reliable way of racking up a large sum of money quickly.

Another tip is simply to cash in on Luna, then get to transporting food/water/passengers to Mars quickly. Luna makes a lot of money early, but it becomes pretty competitive once the AI starts transporting stuff. You will usually find yourself losing money after the development reaches 100%. 

Currently, development and population doesn't seem to have a large effect on resource production and resource profile.

bearing in mind that this game was release to early access just 2 days ago I think I have stumbled onto a gem.

Pros:
1.) Very complicated game, this means there is so much to learn about playing that you end up spending hours perfecting strategies, and given this is very early access, it will only get more complicated from here

2.) Huge amounts of gameplay, Earth and the Moon is only the first step, gradually the game expands onto a much larger scope, with each knew planet and star system being new yet helpfully similar, meaning there is potentially hours of enjoyable, non repetitive gameplay in each game.

3.) Competitive multiplayer gameplay (This feature is currently bugged, but is planned for future release) judging from how the game plays with one Human and multiple AI, there is the potential for incredibly competitive multiplayer games, as the basis of the game is to out compete your fellow space transport companies.

Things I am not sure about being a pro or a con:
1.) a simple tutorial system: the current tutorial (It will change as new features are implemented) is very simple, telling the player what each game system does, but not telling the player the best ways of effectively using each system to its advantage. I like this because it leaves the strategies to be figured out by the player, making the player spend hours figuring out what and when to do things.

unfortunately this also may lead players to think the game is impossibly hard and cause them to quit. 
2.) the game is Very hard, at least in my opinion.
this makes the game fun as it is a challenge to overcome but also can lead to boredom at failing every time you try to expand your buisness to mars instead of just the moon. (maybe I am just doing it so horrendously wrong that this isn't an issue?)

cons:
1.) a bit buggy in its current state, but no more than is to be expected of an early alpha
2.) Multiplayer is bugged, and custom matches bugged the last few times I tried them, nothing majour though, they will likely get patched/ implemented quite soon.

Fans von Spielen wie Transport Tycoon, Railroad Tycoon, Simutrans, Trainfever oder Transportfever, sollten die weitere Entwicklung verfolgen.

Das Spiel ist jetzt schon gut spielbar. Der Entwickler zeigt sich sehr aktiv. Besonders positiv fällt auf, dass der Entwickler persönlich auf Kommentare und Vorschläge der (noch) kleinen Community antwortet und eingeht. Über Twitter ist nachvollziehbar, dass einige Vorschläge direkt umgesetzt werden.

Das Spiel ist auf den ersten Blick nicht sehr komplex. Es gibt eine überschaubare Zahl an Ressourcen und anfangs noch nicht allzu viele Schiffstypen. Recht schnell zeigt sich aber die Komplexität, die sich schnell ergibt, wenn man über den ersten Planet hinaus Handel betreibt. Man beginnt in den Standarteinstelungen in unserem Sonnensystem und handelt zwischen Erde und Mond (Luna). Die ersten profitablen Routen sind schnell eingerichtet. Jetzt sollte man allerdings nicht denken, dass es das schon gewesen wäre. Will man weitere Planeten besiedeln, wird es zunehmend schwer, die richtige Balance zwischen den Ressourcen zu finden. Man muss Kolonien auch erst aufbauen, bevor diese groß genug werden, um profitable Routen einzurichten. Hier ist dann Strategie gefragt: Welche Kolonien baue ich auf? Zahlen sich die anfänglichen Verluste in Zukunft aus? Was macht die Konkurrenz? usw. usw.

Das Spiel ist Early Access, somit ist klar, dass es noch über einige Kinderkrankheiten verfügt. Einige Bugs hat der Entwickler bereits am Releasetag gefixt. Das stimmt mich positiv für die weitere Entwicklung.
Für de aktuellen Preis auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen, wenn man den Entwickler unterstützen und an der weiteren Entwicklung teilhaben möchte. Auch sind die Chancen sehr gut, dass eigene Ideen und Vorschläge vom Entwickler aufgegriffen werden, wovon ihr euch selber überzeugen könnt.

Planets and routes are not fire and forget, as they mature their needs change which needs update, least you run into debt and inefficient routes. As there are multiple planets to settle in the starting system alone, you will be kept busy modifying creating and deleting new routes. You can develop the planets from tiny expeditions with a dirt landing to multi dozen milion populations with interstellar ports and industry.

This game released on EA on 16th of August, and has already seen its first patch based on community feedback. It is still not without its bugs, but as far as EA goes, its very stable and has sufficient content to keep you koing. It needs only few minor tweak to be enjoyable for a very long time (think dozens of hours) at which point you will easily get your money's worth out of this game.

Some things that seem to be missing and might reimain for some time, is customization, more in depth economy and late game balance. AI needs work too (tho it might have actually been partially fixed today), but the developers are very open minded and responsive to feedback.

If you are still unsure, put the game on your watch list, as more tweaks patches and updates are said to be dropped in next few weeks; check youtube for some lets plays to give you a better idea on what you can expect.

That is to to say, these guys are making a fun game, and thus far, have interacted with the community in an upbeat way while taking the criticism in stride, without getting defensive and argu  ing withe the players. It is no secret that I had a major issue with the game upon the early access release, and while the devs didn't see how that was possible, they  workd with me right away, to try to find a solution.. It took about 24 hours for them to diagnose the problem, and about another hour or so to release a patch that fixed the issue, from my recollation.
 
      So Steam doesn't give reviewers the opportunnnnity score a game from 1 to 10, but that doesn't mean we can't have a little fun and add something in. So based on Early Accesss games, I would give this game a 9/10. The only reason I wouldn't give this game a 10/10, is because I believe there is 1 other early accessgame available that is tiny bit vetter. 

     Now I could  probably simg the praises of this game al day, but I spent several hours playing this game, and I did that trying to find bugs. The initial game-breaking bug not withstanding, there are a few minor hiccups, and the ai still needs some work, but over all I had ro be pretty nitpicky to find much to put in the bugs and other issues section. The devs have also said they plan many new features that I can't wait for.

  So inc closing, I want to say that I have seen what this game has to offer, and the price is rather low for the hours of fun it will provide. You should buy this game, support these devs that have their act together, have produced a very fun game already, and are making it better and better what seems like every day. These are the types of devs that Early Access was meant for, and we need to let Steam know that this is what we expect from an earlly  access title and development team. One of the best ways to do that, is to pony up, and purchase this game as oon as possible.


TLDR::// I give the game a 9/10 compared to other early access games. You need to support these devs and get this game asap. It is fun with few bugs, and massive  developer support adding new features that look awesome. BUY THIS GAME!


OLD REVIEWS(I don't know about this game. It is early access, and it is bound to have bugs, but I played for about 10 minutes, and the fuel costs for any route I set up were in the tens of millions, making the game impossible to play. I tried starting new games, restarting the game, but every time I would go into debt by millions of dollars because the fuel costs were stupid. Can't recommend a game I can't properly play.

-Edit-
 Well after spending a few hours trying to figure out this issue with the help of the devs, they couldn't replicate my issue, though after streaming the game on twitch, the did see that I indeed had a major problem, that they have yet to find out the cause. As the dev noted, this issue is very strange, and corruption of files in this very focused manner does not make a lot of sense. I tried restarting my computer, and doing a clean install, but that did not change anything. Every route I set up has major fuel costs in the neighborhood of tens of millions of dollars.

I don't feel comfortable leaving this review up as negative, as my issue, while game-breaking, is very unique and as of yet no one else has had anything like this. I also do not feel comfortable with a review that recommends this game to anyone, while I doubt anyone else will have this problem, I have not been able to play the game in any meaningful way so as to be able to recommend it. I will remove this review at 6pm PST 8/17/2017, unless a fix is found so I can play the game and recommend it confidently. But until that time, I will change it to a positive, as many people look at the average rating of a game, and I don't want my issue to hinder the chance for this game to do really well, especially with the dev team it has being as helpful as they have been.)

Developers are very active I have spoken to them multiple times via e-mail, and twitter and almost every time I recived response within 24h. 

About the game itself it is fun at it's current stage which is always important with early access products. It will require a lot of balancing to make it play better but already fun factor is there. 

I like it that it's very intuitive and everything is kept on the same plane. I am greatful that developers didn't go into any crazy 3d spins of planets because it would be imposible to navige. 

At a current stage route planer needs some work and ship purchuse mechanics too. 

Over all I would rate i at 7/10 and will gladly see it become 9/10 over next few months.",1502905191,1502905191,True,20,0,0.705868542194366455,0,False,False,True,False,,,

I had a lot of trouble making money until I started a new game and just watched to see what the AI did. Then it all sort of made sense to me. You need to be very careful about not running too many ships on a route, they will make some money at first but will quickly go into the red. Be sure to regularly check on all of your ship profitablility and make sure you sell off ships that are losing cash.  

The developers are very active and listen to the community and are hard at work balancing the game and adding changes to the UI etc. I am really confident in them and look forward to seeing all that they will bring to this really fun genre! 

If you're not ready for an Early Access game, then hold off on purchasing this, but if you're ready to deal with the issues you see in the first launch of an EA game then give it a shot! It's a ton of fun.",1502901436,1502901707,True,40,1,0.7065773606300354,0,False,True,True,False,,,
