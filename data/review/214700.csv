-	Have you just been hit with a short aerodynamics lesson?
-	Does the use of mini-balloons make police less or more threatening?
-	Is drunk sex really worth it?
-	Why pushing ducks into the pool is so satisfying?

The game is an interesting, but very short experience. It is low on interactivity, but the visuals and music are both very good. Still a little more interactivity within the story may have helped here, though perhaps I have been spoiled by developments in the genre over the decade since ""Thirty Flights of Loving""'s release.

Really the problem is the story, it's obtuse and over too quickly. (Playable in 10 minutes or so.) Really it could have benefited with being twice as long to flesh out some of the details, though I suspect the creator's intent was to keep certain elements unknowable. This led to an unfortunate ""Wait, this is the end?"" feeling on completion.

Mich hat es aber unterhalten.

Das Spiel ist eine bizarre Kurzgeschichte über ein Bankräuber-Trio mit eckigen Kastenköpfen, schnellen Szenenwechseln und ohne gesprochene Dialoge, welches man unterschiedlich interpretieren kann.
Gameplay ist Walking Simulator mäßig sehr minimal, rumlaufen ein paar mal ""E"" drücken.
Sterben kann man dabei nicht.

Als Bonus gibt es einen Entwickler-Kommentar und das bereits vor Thirty Flights of Loving erschienene Spiel ""Gravity Bone"" wobei es sich um einen Agenten-Thriller in einer ähnlichen Aufmachung handelt, hier gibt es allerdings einige Platforming Passagen und andere Hindernisse, die einen umbringen können.

I won't get too deep into the story apart from mentioning that even a good, creative and sincere story can't save a sloppy technical implementation on a game.

The game features lazy low-polygon voxel ""Minecraft""-like ""art"", making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the 1990s.  A lot of amateur developers see Minecraft's success and assume it's because it looks bad, not because it had unique and appealing game mechanics, and they try to emulate the success without understanding it.  It also happens to be easy, and doesn't need any proper talent in terms of game development/graphic artists etc.  That's why reviewers are faced with so many of these terrible games with confrontingly bad graphics.  Developers must learn that Minecraft succeeded despite the bad graphics, not because of them.

While you can set the game resolution and even customise the game controls, there's very little in the way of graphics tweaks at all, so there's no way to improve the lacklustre visuals.

Gameplay is okay but not great, and lacks polish, leaving this game in a state where you could probably get more fun out of watching a Youtube video of it than playing it yourself... and that's a problem, because Youtube costs less than this. 

Thirty Flights of Loving has an overly optimistic price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.",1661250243,1661250243,False,1,2,0.134872078895568848,0,False,False,False,False,,,

1) Thirty Flights of Loving 
Типа нолановское ""Помни"" в мире кубических бородато-картонных мужских рож.
Много неожиданных телепортаций, мало понимания происходящего.
Просто ходим и иногда активируем какой-нибудь предмет, чтобы снова идти вперёд.
Ни к Пауэрсу, ни к Бонду приплетён принцип Бернулли в трёх опытах.

1.5) Thirty Flights of Loving с режимом комментариев
Пройдите игру во второй раз и узнайте, почему танцы уходят в космос, как рисовали кота и что наушники необходимы только в одной сцене.

2) Gravity Bone
Более экшен-ориентированный проект с щепоткой неожиданностей. 
Напоминает по большей части Hitman - есть задание, инструменты для его выполнения и обязательный выход с карты.
Миссий всего две, смертей - одна (или 6?).
Возможно, придётся грузануться на флагштоке.
Игра доступна БЕСПЛАТНО на отдельной странице в магазине Steam.

По итогу - две индюшки (одна платная) по ~15 минут каждая (если не тыкаться по углам), которые запомнятся только тем, как прикольно выглядят.
Для всего остального есть Jazzpunk!

Jedná se o hru z roku 2012, kterou vytvořil Brendon Chung, stojící také za tituly jako [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/974090/Gravity_Bone/]Gravity Bone[/url] nebo [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/240440/Quadrilateral_Cowboy/]Quadrilateral Cowboy[/url]. Jako člen tříčlenné skupinky zločinců, budete účastníky jedné nepovedené akce, stejně jako několika předcházejících událostí. Autor se však rozhodl, že děj nebude předkládat chronologicky, zcela se obejde bez dialogů, a vše bude viděno z pohledu vlastních očí. Výsledkem je patnáctiminutová jízda, obratně kličkující prostorem i časem – plná akce, lásky a zrady, i oloupaných pomerančů.

Vedle důvtipné práce s okolním prostředím, je pak nejsilnější stránkou hry, především dynamika samotného vyprávění. Té je docíleno časovými zkratkami, za pomoci ostrých střihů, a to přímo během samotného hraní. Vzniká tak rychlý řetězec událostí, který nesledujete pasivně, ale posouváte ho vpřed svým pohybem. Vynikající je také hudební doprovod, skvěle podtrhující gangsterskou atmosféru. Za zmínku stojí i překvapivě otevřený komentář samotného autora, který se vám odemkne po dokončení hry. Dozvíte se tak o těžkostech při vývoji, nutných kompromisech, ale i vědomých nedostatcích finální verze.

Tento narativní experiment rozhodně neosloví každého, ale jestli rádi vyhledáváte neobvyklé zážitky, pak máte mé doporučení.

Em alguns aspectos me faz lembrar de ""Um Homem Com Uma Câmera"", clássico do cinema de Dziga Vertov.

Vertov era um raro tipo de gênio que só surge uma vez em cada geração: um cara extremamente pretensioso que tinha talento o suficiente para transformar suas pretensões em realidade. Através do cinema ele pretendia elaborar o conceito do ""Kino-Glaz"", que pode ser traduzido como ""cine-olho"" ou ""kino-olho"". Mais do que um instrumento de captura da realidade, a câmera funcionaria como o terceiro olho do homem, permitindo, através da recriação de imagens em movimento interligadas, ver coisas que nossos olhos naturais não seriam capazes de ver. Mas a manifestação desse ""kino-olho"" através do cinema só seria possível se esse meio artístico fosse destilado e purificado. Apenas quando o cinema deixa-se de se escorar em outras formas de comunicação mais tradicionais como teatro ou literatura e criasse uma linguagem própria é que ele nos permitiria vislumbrar essa realidade alterada. O aviso que precede ""Um Homem Com Uma Câmera"" deixam claros os intentos de Vertov: ""Esse filme é um experimento em comunicação cinemática de eventos reais. Sem a ajuda de intertítulos. Sem a ajuda de uma história. Sem a ajuda de teatro. Esse trabalho experimental almeja criar uma verdadeira linguagem internacional do cinema baseado em sua absoluta separação da linguagem do teatro e literatura."" A conclusão a que Vertov chegou e que sua magnum opus demonstra com eloquência é que o cinema, em sua forma mais pura, é a seleção, manipulação e mistura de imagens em movimento. Diálogos, atuação, trilha sonora, enredo... Todas essas outras coisas são absolutamente desnecessárias para se fazer um filme.

Passados 93 anos, a pergunta que muitas artistas se fazem não é mais ""qual a linguagem própria do cinema?"", e sim ""qual a linguagem própria dos videogames?"" - pergunta em partes motivada pelo curioso fato de que, assim como o cinema de outrora parecia se escorar bastante nas artes cênicas, os jogos eletrônicos de hoje em dia pegam bastante emprestado do próprio cinema, com muitos sendo literalmente vendidos como ""cinematográficos"". A resposta a que Brendon Chung chegou parece ser ""controle"": games em sua forma mais pura são espaços audiovisuais em que o jogador tem o controle de ir e vir. É usando ao máximo esse elemento que Thirthy Flights of Loving tenta contar sua narrativa, dispensando inteiramente diálogos e logs em texto ou áudio e fazendo uso negligenciável de cutscenes ou seções em que o jogador não tem controle algum.

Brendon Chung não é nenhum Dziga Vertov dos games, então apesar de suas intenções louváveis, o impacto e qualidade de sua obra são limitados. Mas, por outro lado, é injustiça culpar alguém por não ser tão talentoso quanto Dziga Vertov. Apesar de suas limitações, Thirty Flights of Loving ainda é uma obra intrigante e que merece atenção.",1642877316,1642877367,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Эта игра наглядная демонстрация того, что получится, если у амбициозного человека возникнет идея самому сделать кинематографичную игру. Игра длится около 10 минут, но создаваться она могла пол года-год, и это ещё с опытом предыдущих проектов автора и это очень печально, одному человеку практически невозможно сделать что-то годное.

Сама игра представляет из себя просто приколюшную инди бродилку с повествованием через окружение и внезапными, особо ничем не обоснованными, поворотами. Я вот так думаю сейчас, можно было бы сделать из этого какую-нибудь полноценную очень динамичную игру без диалогов длиной хотя бы в 2 часа, где игроку надо было бы постоянно куда-то нестись и быстро находу принимать решения, руководствуясь только повествованием через окружение, вот это бы мог выйти шедевр, напрягающий мозги.

Но всё равно игра неплохая, тут уникальный способ повествования истории (дробление) и игра не тратит ваше время впустую) В конце концов, игра дарит кое-какие эмоции, а это самое важное.

p.s. Кстати, все жалуются, что она очень короткая, но после прохождения в меню ещё становится доступно перепрохождение с комментариями разработчика и предыдущая бесплатная игра этого разработчика Gravity Bone.

The game was too short for the price

And I for one think that this is flat out wrong and is the wrong way to judge this game. Yes it is short; a first playthrough will take you about 20 minutes max but that time is some of the most interesting, experimental, and playful the medium has to offer. Tfol smartly plays subverts conventions established by other games and weaves an engaging heist and romantic narrative through its jump cuts. On top of this every single room in tfol is a designers dream and makes use of environmental storytelling and carefully placed objects to guide you through its halls.

My point here is that the amount of craftsmanship that has gone into this game is high and creates an engaging experience for the player despite its length.

The unfortunate thing is that [i]Thirty Flights of Loving[/i] isn't bad, it just suffers from a bad case of style over substance. It's predecessor, [i]Gravity Bone[/i], which is included in the package, is actually a considerably better game. It's wittier, at points more memorable in terms of level design, and contains more conventional 'gameplay'. The issue comes in the fact that Gravity Bone is available to play online [i]for free[/i].

Thirty Flights of Loving tries to focus on narrative, rather than gameplay. It shares a similar art direction to Gravity Bone, with vibrant colours and boxy, polygonal characters.

There's still genuine charm here, but after its initial novelty, the game feels like its only flair is in its aesthetics. There are some games that benefit from leaning into visual aspects over their gameplay, but many of these titles have randomly generated elements or are considerably larger in scope. Thirty Flights of Loving is a linear experience that lasts less than an hour, which doesn't leave much room for replayability. The game is just a string of action movie setpieces and clichés. 

Overall, after finishing, I felt the same sensations I felt years ago watching the second Transformers movie. There was enough flashy stuff to keep me entertained while I was watching, then I left feeling a little manipulated and hollow for having realistically gained so little from the experience. It's all of the climactic scenes from a heist movie, but without any of the nuance and humanistic characterisation that actually make an engaging story. The other half is another, better game that's available online for free.

The good examples ([i]Spec Ops: The Line[/i], [i]Undertale[/i], etc.) seem to get that unless the story in some way involves the player’s input, that story, no matter how clever or interesting, can be nothing more than a backdrop to the gameplay.

[i]Thirty Flights of Loving[/i] doesn’t understand this, but more importantly it also lacks any meaningful gameplay for its weak, self-indulgent storytelling to serve as a backdrop for. It’s going for a sort of edgy film style, with quick cuts between non-linear story segments, a technique that doesn’t really work when the character is player-controlled, since the onus is on you to match the pacing of the individual segments with the frequency of the developer-controlled scene transitions.

In general, it just doesn’t work. I’d love to be able to say it’s bold and innovative, but it’s really just a colourful new skin on something that’s been done to death by now.

Kinda Like: Jazzpunk??? Damn, there's nothing like either of these games...

After a short ""tutorial"" and introduction to the characters, the retro-cinematic title card punches you in the head ""Thirty Flights of Loving"". It looks like something straight out of the 1960s, complete with a ""Blendo Games"" logo, ""globe"" logo (Universal??) among others. Surprised there was no ""CINEMARAMA"" logo used. Goddamn what an awesome ""intro"" (Gravity Bone's is even better IMO). Brendon Chung apparently knows his cinema...

What you see behind the title is a woman, clearly shot. She's angry, she's shaking, probably close to death herself. Her gun pointed directly at you, and she's pulling the trigger when no rounds are left in the chamber.  *Click* *Click* The game starts at this point. Of course you've got questions. You pick up another person who is close to death, and you try to find your way out the area...apparently leaving the woman alone. 

Why'd I use quotations for the word ""intro""? The game is short, and the intro is a large portion of this game. This is more or a less a demo of what the developer can do. Think of it as an interactive story & not so much a game. Brendon Chung is close to an EXPERT at telling a story without using dialogue, and mostly imagery. He clearly shows his skill here. Although admittedly I had to play the game a few times to get what the game was trying to convey. There's no opportunity to branch away. This ""game"" is clearly trying to tell a story, and funnels you toward what it wants to share. Once I figured it out...it was sad really, betrayal is a theme in lots of stories. Appreciate what the story is telling. 

That said, the game is extremely short. Admittedly I bought this on sale. At half price, this is something everyone needs to take a look at. Full price? Maybe a niche audience. I still  prefer Gravity Bone's story telling by far, but I just hope Brendon Chung and Blendo returns to this world.

A fever dream that's really efficient at weaving a narrative in a matter of minutes"".

But this leaves so much out of it.

To start off, the game's 9 minutes long. I don't care if it's 3 minutes long, i just want a good experience. TFoL doesn't care for that though. TFoL is laziness. Here's why:

The developer made a game called ""Gravity Bone"". The game's in the same engine and was made years before this was made. This game's technically much more unstable. That game was free. This game costs 4.99€. That game was longer and had more gameplay elements. It also made a more coherent narrative.

The game starts in 720p every time. It doesn't keep track of your settings. 

When I saw that the game boasted about its commentary, I was pretty excited. Half-Life: Lost Coast and Deus Ex: Human Revolution both had amazing commentaries. Gabe's voice talking about the technical aspects of Half-Life; DE:HR's charming developers talking about the development process in intense detail with some of them interacting with each other once in a while, causing great banter. As long as your mic isn't terrible, I'm interested in developer's commentary. It can add new perspectives and make any game way better. Well... the developer of TFoL is a lazy bastard. It's text boxes. Well, maybe the text is interesting and useful? No, not at all. It's just him going unnecessarily off topic about boring stuff and very basic storytelling mechanics that are so obvious that it's painful to read his text that he wrote, thinking he was so clever and that he was about to blow our minds. ""The slits in the planks are to show that you're high up."". Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. We know these things. We know that drawing attention to something is important. He actually even insinuated that we might not understand where we are at one point (spoiler, it was obviously the apartment of either the protagonist or the only other character in the apartment. Not to mention that it didn't even matter to the story). 
Don't make a developer's commentary if you have nothing to say. No, scratch that. The developer seems to think that we're either mentally challenged or that we're just children who picked up their first video game today. 

From that commentary, you'll also see the main issue with this game. This was a prototype at first. A prototype to the slightly longer FREE game. When he said that he didn't have the whole game together from that prototype, I burst out into a chuckle because from what he says, around 60% of the game was already done. 


When looking at the developer's site, you can see an FAQ, where there's a question along the lines of ""Is there DRM?"". He says there isn't, because he wants to create the best experience for the user possible. Fucking irony, isn't it? 
The game's a trashfire on the technical side. Multiple small bugs, crashes, the settings don't work and so on. 
The developer's commentary is garbage and exists for the creator to pat himself of the back for this game.
The game has no real gameplay and it's extremely basic on the side of the story too. 

The game's 4.99€. That means the developer think that this game's so good that you should pay 5€ for it. The nerve that it takes to create something so weak and meager, pretend like it's some clever game that totally has more to it than meets the eye and then ask for what is the equivalent of a full day's food or a game like Plants vs Zombies/Simulacra/QUAKE/The Binding of Isaac or even the full movie about the making of Kingdom Come (You know, actually good external developer's commentary) is fucking ridiculous. It's like a rich trust fund kid writing a book how much he worked when his dad gave him a job as Vice President in his company for 6 hours.
There was no real effort. There is no clever storytelling. There is no hidden meaning. It's surface level stuff, no matter how much you say it isn't.

I know this was mostly made by one person, but charging 5 goddamn dollars for this is an awful thing to do. 

First off, this game probably has the worst pc porting I've ever seen for any game in my entire life. (Pretty sure this game's only on pc too)
I have .4 hours on this game, and .3 of them were trying to get this game to goddamn be remotely functional. The options menu has very basic graphics settings, which isn't gamebreaking in of itself, but I'll save the performance for later. Every single time you dare sneeze at one of those options, pausing the game after setting them up just crashes the game, no matter what, which /I guess/ you don't need to pause because of the game's length, but that's a very backanded compliment. Also worth noting that the brightness setting just ups the brightness on your computer entirely, which is hilariously awful. Speaking of the game's performance, I tried on three seperate computers to get this game to run at a framerate above 10, and only with a 1,100 dollar setup was I able to get this game barely over 60fps. Not helping that fact is the game freezes all the time for a second+ each time. Another thing worth pointing out is that the game looks ugly as hell, shadows for objects appear twenty light years away from the object casting the shadow, there's plenty of characters floating above the ground, teleporting characters, among many other things. The game also never saves your settings too which is incredible considering every time you open it completely messes up your computer.
TL;DR game runs abysmally, looks abysmal, getting it to run is abysmal process. Framerate is terrible, even on a pc where I can play VR games ultra smooth and play games as impressive looking as AHiT at 144fps

Second, this game takes 5 minutes to beat, seriously. I wouldn't call it short but sweet either. What PC Gamer in the trailer is saying is a complete lie in every sense of the word. ok so like, in the game, you go into a bar, go into an armory, run around in an airport, then suddenly your friends are bloody, you take one god knows where (rip the other one) and then youre instantly dropped at a nausiating angle in a bedroom to go to a party, you go to the party, sit there for a couple seconds, get drunk, go back home, walk towards the friend you left behind and then suddenly youre dropped back to another place where I actually got softlocked due to the strange movement there, fun, and then youre back to taking your friend through the airport, in which you see the police and then you teleport onto a motorcycle with another nausiating angle, where you drive away. the end, oh but not until you get tought Bernoulli's principle of wind, which actually fucking happens in this game, and then youre back on the motorcycle, and die but also not die at the same time.
TL;DR game stole five bucks for a story less comprehensible and less enjoyable than watching unsubbed sword art online

Third, the game's super buggy and a huge lie. I already mentioned the softlock, pc settings, and the freezes, but some objects dont seem to work correctly at all, and the game's cutscenes have built-in model clipping for still, teleported in objects. Another thing is how the text ""forger"" appears in one of the game's screenshots, you don't forge anything, all you can do in this game is pick up objects with nothing gained from picking them up, eat oranges, and do whatever action the game requires you to press e once for, no forging of anything happens. The game says in the Steam store description as having lovelorn criminals, but it's never even shown what we're criminals for really, and the love only goes as far as awkward stares while the game has fun with bloom effects (maybe it's in the prequel but screw off I ain't playing that after this) I feel nothing after playing it other than regret. I also noticed some stock sound effects which is always SUPER immersive.
TL;DR Game lies about it's story and interactions and its even harder to make sense of it when having to deal with bugs

Trust me, you don't want to play this game, it's not even worth it free.

In the time that will take to experience this narrative you aren’t going to find a deep plot, no sub-text, no message behind, the gameplay is above all lineal and basic, the graphics are quite obnoxious —the aesthetic corresponds amidst the objects, people, and so forth, but them are not elaborately real and gleamingly simplistic—, there is a lack of voice-acting which is replaced by a quirky and bizarre mumble, and foremost a large quantity of disorganized and chaotic sequences with only a small amount of sense.

So, how could it be so relevant to the foundation of vidya as a serious platform in which art, like an edifice of audiovisual interaction, will arise to entomb the capitalistic desire of entertainment as a tool for profitable alienation?

In cinema, just like it could happen in video games, there are some tools of which you can take advantage to create a more poetic, fast, vivid, sad, etcetera, ambient to the spectator. Geometry, composition, silence or music, and the length of a scene can create different emotions, interpretations and/or meanings of what the author is trying to tell by means of what is showed in the frames. Here Chung does not apply all of the previously said, but he does use of something really important: Montage. 
In Dziga Vertov's experimental 1929 Soviet silent documentary film ""Man with a Movie Camera"" the entire plot is told by montage, without dialogues and yet having a thread that connects the sequences providing a notable consistence. 

This mixture of Wong Kar-wai and Tarantino is a totally rich adventure in the way of how things should be told, grabbing a flat event recreated throughout history on countless occasions and giving it a fresh twist (although maybe if the story was longer it wouldn't have worked) from were a lot of devs could grab a tip or two.

Sorry, let me back up.

Years ago, I played Gravity Bone because people kept going on about how ""great"" it was and a positive example of how well indie developers understand narrative and how Blendo is looking at stories in ways people normally don't. What I got was possibly a sneak peek at the tail-end of someone's Creative Writing 101 story. ""What did I just witness?"" was probably a thought that crossed my mind back then. It certainly did after playing through Thirty Flights a few times.

I think the developer's own words kind of damn him. ""You can never look at it with fresh eyes, you know the work inside and out."" By that I mean that only the Chung really knows what the story is supposed to be about. Thirty Flights of Loving? More like Thirty People Have Thirty Interpretations. The dizzying jump-cuts, the references to 5 other games almost none of us have played (let along heard of), the deliberately vague ""it's more interesting this way"" storytelling. It's like, I KNOW there's a story there somewhere, but after almost an hour of playing the game (including commentary) and then another hour scouring the internet for some clues as to WHY so many people are infatuated with this game...

Pretend for a moment that you are sitting on a bench in a park. Perhaps you're sipping a coffee or watching people go about their business. Suddenly, a naked man runs screaming past followed by a flock of angry pigeons. A moment passes and they're gone, leaving behind only some stray feathers and a somewhat awkward ""that was weird"" feeling, and a nagging feeling that perhaps something important just happened.

That's how I feel after all this time. So many people seem to ""get it"" and yet just as many people do not, and depending on who you talk to you're either a pretentious snob liking something cause it's cool to do so or an uneducated fool who couldn't spot all the obvious tells of a See Spot Run book. Apologies, that sounded a bit harsh, but those are indeed reactions I have seen while trying to come to terms with this game. On the other hand, I certainly feel I had more to work with than Dear Esther. Thirty Flights tells the same story every time, it's your interpretations and understanding that change. This was decidedly not the case with the former.

This is a needlessly long and drawn out ""review"" because I don't want to just up and insult people who did or didn't get the game. I, personally, felt there was something inherently lazy about expecting your audience to piece everything together without giving them more to go on. However, the music is wonderful and the visuals are charming. I don't disparage Thirty Flights nor its creator, but I can't deny that ""not getting it"" does make me feel foolish. This is perhaps due to the fact that after replaying Gravity Bone and thinking about the connection between the games, I have still come up short.

And being told by the likes of PC Gamer and Rock Paper Shotgun that this is an ""amazing"" game and ""better than actual spy movies"" definitely doesn't help. I just can't escape the feeling that games like this are the virtual equivalent of Lost. Where everything is in the creator's head, they're not going to give you a straight answer, and either everyone is wrong or nobody is wrong. Which does not make for a very enjoyable story.

I can't even say ""you'll like this if you liked Gravity Bone"", because they're both quite different experiences. I CAN say that this is most definitely an art game, and perhaps that's all you need to know.",1534901640,1534901640,False,29,1,0.631206512451171875,0,True,False,False,False,,,

So this is the game that influenced Virginia, at least in terms of how the story was told.

Le côté prototype est d'autant plus présent à cause de la technique du jeu. Je ne parle pas de ses personanges carrés et du style graphique (qui font partie des points ""plutôts positifs"" du jeu)  mais réellement de la technique ""basique"" du jeu, à savoir: ne pas crasher.

Lorsqu'on ouvre le menu pause, qu'on sauvegarde ou qu'on charge une partie, 50% du temps le jeu crash. Chaque crash du jeu remet à zéro tous les paramètres (son/graphismes/contrôles), on est donc forcés de jouer en qwerty, 720p (avec des paramètres graphiques détectés au pif), le son à fond et en se forçant et ne jamais  appuyer sur la touche échap ou sauvegarde rapide pour ne pas perdre sa progression dans la niveau.

Enfin, les sauvegardes manuelles ne fonctionnant pas (même lorsque ça ne crash pas) le petit passage de plateforme de la 2e partie du jeu (rendu délicat, principalement à cause des contrôles du jeu) devient une véritable une puisque l'erreur est fatale et force à recommencer le niveau.

Gameplay for both games amounted to walking, poor first-person platforming, an uninteresting activities like ""take this picture"" or ""use x on y."" Interspaced throughout were sudden jumps, obviously intended to act like jump-cuts in film, that were often fairly disorienting.

The plots, a large focus of both games, is explained chiefly through action instead of text. However, even under such limitation, there is a strange lack of detail. The player is bounced through moments that vary from ridiculous to serious in seconds. The result feels extremely half-baked.

En fait en achetant ce jeu, on obtient non pas un mais deux jeux puisque celui ci comprend en plus de ""Thirty flights of loving"", le jeu ""Gravity Bone"" téléchargeable gratuitement sur le site des développeurs. Perso j'ai découverts ""Thirty flights"" grâce à Gravity Bone que j'avais téléchargé depuis Romstation gratuitement évidemment. Du coup je vais en premier évoquer Gravity Bone et je vous parlerais ensuite de Thirty Flights.

Gravity Bone est un jeu gratuit où l'on contrôle une sorte d'agent secret à travers 2 niveaux. Le premier a une durée de 2 à 5 minutes. Il s'agit tout simplement d'un petit niveau où on se retrouve à se déguiser en serveur pour discrètement empoisonner un homme. Ce niveau sert surtout de tutoriel. On enchaine ensuite avec le second niveau qui se fait en 10 à 20 minutes maximum. Dans celui ci, on a pour objectif de photographier 5 oiseaux (je ne sais pas vraiment pourquoi et je soupçonne les développeurs de ne pas le savoir non plus). On se retrouve donc dans une sorte d'hotel avec en inventaire un appareil photo et également du materiel permettant de détruire des cadenas. Sans spoil, la fin de ce premier jeu est vraiment excellente. Alors qu'on ne s'y attend pas du tout, un rebondissement a lieu, et on se retrouve alors à faire une course poursuite réellement bien réalisé et vraiment drôle.

Visuellement le jeu n'est pas spécialement beau mais la direction artistique reste très original et je l'apprécie réellement. En ce qui concerne l'audio, il n'y a pas grand chose à dire. On retiendra quand même quelques musiques, celle du premier niveau et celles de la course poursuite. Pour le gameplay, c'est assez pauvre, on peutvmzrcher sauter et utiliser notre materiel... rien d'incroyable. Sinon on ne peut pas changer les commandes, c'est regrettable mais acceptable pour un jeu gratuit. On a donc avec ce jeu une expérience gratuite très appréciable que je vous conseille réellement. Le studio a alors pris le pari de faire un jeu du même style mais cette fois ci payant. Ce risque a t'il payé?

Thirty flights of loving commence sans page d'accueil, comme son prédécesseur. Ce jeu est assez difficile à diviser en plusieurs niveaux, mais on peut le diviser en 3 parties. L'intro, le jeu, et la conclusion qui est en fait le générique. Dans l'intro, on se retrouve dans un bar issue d'une cachette secrète. On rencontre donc nos deux coéquipiers dont j'ai totalement oublié les noms, qui sont un homme et une femme. Après avoir fait connaissance (de façon humoristique) avec eux et leurs caractéristiques, on rentre dans un avion et le jeu commence réellement. 
Et là c'est assez difficile à expliquer mais on alterne entre deux actions totalement différentes. La première se situe dans un aéroport avec nos deux alliés blessés. Il faut donc amener notre coéquipier en fauteuil roulant faire un tour de l'aéroport. Toute cet action est coupé par des scènes qui j'imagine se sont passés avant cette mésaventure où nos 3 héros sont les invités un mariage, et après plusieurs bouteilles d'alcool, on comprend que notre personnage et notre coéquipiere sont amoureux. Et... c'est tout.

En gros ce second jeu dure 20 à 30 minutes. C'est à dire autant pour ne pas dire moins de temps que pour le précédent jeu qui je le rappelle était gratuit. Alors autant pour un jeu gratuit c'est tout à fait excusable autant là c'est franchement une honte. Après on peut se dire que le jeu est court mais il doit être intense et d'une grande qualité. Non! Non je considère même ce jeu inferieur qualitativement vis a vis du premier. Il y a une régression. Tout d'abord il n'y a plus de materiel comme celui que nous possédions dans le premier. Il n'y a même pas de passages de plateforme comme dans le premier. Pas de scène mémorable comme la fin du premier. Et d'ailleurs en parlant de fin, celle ci est réellement mauvaise. Elle arrive comme un cheveux sur la soupe de façon très abrupte et surprenante... En ce qui concerne le scénario, autant j'avais un peu compris le premier (même si certaines choses m'ont échappé) autant là c'est très peu compréhensible. Avec tout ces changements de lieux et de temporalités, on y comprend presque rien. Et tant que j'y suis... OU ES LE LIEN AVEC GRAVITY BONE?? Serieusment est ce que l'action se passe avant ou après. J'aurais tendance à dire après mais ce n'est qu'une idée personnelle.

Sinon visuellement c'est toujours aussi réussi. Au niveau de l'audio c'est assez peu mémorable. Mais le vrai problème c'est que le jeu crash beaucoup! Il m'a été impossible d'y jouer en plein écran sans soucis. Sinon ce que je retiendrais outre l'intro assez réussi, c'est une scène dans l'aéropeort ou notre coéquipier tire sur des caméras de police qui tombét du ciel, une scène assez amusante et original. Sinon, je peux pas dire que j'ai passé un mauvais moment sur ce jeu. Certe je l'ai bien démonté jusque là, mais c'est parce que c'est tellement dommage. Ce jeu a été une vraie déception. En achetant ce jeu, je suis en droit d'espérer une version améliorée et plus longue de Gravity Bone. Or là non! Le jeu n'est même pas plus long et qualitativement il est inferieur à Gravity Bone!

Ce jeu est une vraie déception. Je n'ais pas passé un mauvais moment devant ce jeu, mais c'est tellement dommage, on dirait que les développeurs se sont contentés du minimum. En réunissant les deux jeux, il est très facilement finissable en 45 minutes. On peut au moins se dire qu'avec une campagne solo si courte, la rejouabilité peut être plus simple. Malheureusement ce jeu qui possède quelques qualités (je pense au visuel mais aussi à quelques passages des deux jeux ) est gâchée par de très nombreux défauts comme la durée du jeu, le gameplay très pauvre, le scénario ou encore l'îstabilité de celui ci. 
Je le déconseille fortement, surtout à 5€, c'est de l'arnaque. À 2,50€ cela est plus raisonnable mais c'est toujours trop pour ce qu'il a à proposer. Par contre je vous conseille Gravity Bone (qui représente 50% de mon achat) trouvable gratuitement sur le site des développeurs.

I got it for as little as 1.5 euros i think. It was worth it dammit. 
I recommend this game to everyone though. 
The game can be very cheap, so if you don't like it, you won't be too disappointed spending the money. Besides, you could also let your friends try it too and see their reactions ^^ (the game is so short btw, it's easy to finish it VERY quickly).

I'm fine with the comically bad art style, where everything is boxes and rectangles and polygons. Graphics don't make a story.

What I'm not OK with is the complete lack of [i]content[/i] here. You can see that I played this game for 30 minutes.

I played this game for 30 minutes and saw everything there was to see. I didn't speed-run the thing; I wanted to drink in the little slices of life the developers were giving me, but there was barely a thimbleful to drink. The second story especially could have done with more missions. The first one was short, but involves you stealing a waiter's uniform at a party and literally ""bugging"" a VIP. The second mission has you breaking into rooms with freon and a hammer and taking pictures of birds before they explode. But, instead of allowing you to spend a little more time in their world, the developers simply have you get shot at the end of the second mission and tell you it's over.

I found the whole thing intensely unsatisfying. If you're going to tell tiny stories with games, then great, DO THAT. Tell stories. Make a whole anthology.

Lo he conseguido gratis en un sorteo en Reddit pero aun así no lo recomiendo para nada ¿Por Que? 
 Bien para empezar el juego es demasiado pero demasiado corto y no es que sea un problema menor. No no no. El juego en si solo dura entre unos 10 a 30 minutos, y no es que sean unos 30 minutos de pura acción. No, no hay interacción con el personaje y el entorno. La única interacción que hay es a a los primeros minutos del juego en donde recoges armas, balas y cerveza, las cuales al final no sirven para nada, los únicos enemigos que matas ni siquiera los matas tu, los mata tu compañero. Simplemente lo único que haces en todo el juego es mover a tu personaje y abrir puertas.

 No me puedo creer que el juego salga 5 dolares considerando lo corto que es, he visto juegos a 5 dolares mucho mas largos y con mas rejugabilidad. Si saldría como entre menos de un dolar e incluso gratis podría entender lo corto que es. 

 No hay rejugabilidad. El juego en si tiene 0 de rejugabilidad. No hay ni secretos, ni logros para justificar esos 10-30 minutos.
 
 Y si te preguntaras ¿El juego tiene algo de bueno?. Bien su música es disfrutable, los gráficos son un Meh, aunque bien es un juego indie, así que se podría llegar a justificar(aun así el resto del juego sigue siendo injustificable)

Resumen: No lo compren, es muy corto, casi no hay interacción, ni rejugabilidad

This game is weird and I love it. 

There are seriously few games that can hit the note this one does, with its blend of nonsense non-linearity, unabashed smash-cuts and richly coloured surroundings. Lights and sounds blend and overlap in strange ways. strange, plastic people surge around you. those tiny noises that repeat in your mind are brought to life in an continual flow of conciousness. Overwhelmingly, it gives off the feeling of being in a dream or a half forgotten memory; The places you are have a palpable character & feeling to them, be it the oppresive paranoid rush of an airport or the comfortable warmth in a lantern-lit city roof, but the details of where you are or how you got there are often lost. If I had to compare it to anything, I'd say it's a lot like Yume Nikki, or Cat Soup, or a few songs off of Sawako's Madoromi, in how small and personal it can be, plus the drowsy, near-soporiphic (but in a good way) tone it has. I don't think I've ever played a game that so perfectly captures the feeling of waking up at 5pm in the summer, or even tries to.

This game probably isn't for everyone. It's really damn short, and you can easily blaze through it in 5 minutes or less. However, the length of it is something that doesn't exactly bother me. Actual dreams often get cut off and mixed around and forgotten at both ends, and the game leaves me with a feeling that this is neither the beginning nor the end of what happened here, so it adds to that dreamlike quality for me. Just make sure you know that you're in for a short ride if you buy it. For me, it's like revisitng somewhere in your mind. A recurring dream where you can just drift away and be lost in the whirling colour for a little while. I recommend trying it at 3am, when you're a little sleepy.

Now, normally this wouldn't bother me at all. The Beginner's Guide is one of my favorite ""games"", and it's more of an expirience. Now, there are several things that made me return this.

1. The Length. I beat it in 15 minutes, then again in 10. This is crazily short, and it dosen't have alot of replay value. This then goes to my next point.

2. The Price. For every $5 a game costs, it should have at least 2 hours of gameplay. For example, a game that's $10 should  at least have 4 hours of gameplay. This game is $5 and has about 15 minutes of gameplay. That's terrible. This game should be a dollar, if anything.

3. The Actual Gameplay. There is none, except you just walking around. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of walking simulators, like as I said before, The Beginner's Guide is one of my favorite games. In that game you just walk around, but there's commentary and narration that drives you through. It has a story that drives you in. In this game the story is really bad. If the stories bad, then the gameplay should be the thing to drive you through, but all you do is walk.

4. The Story. Like I said before, the story isn't good. Now, I read that it's filled with metaphors. The Beginner's Guide is also filled with metaphors. But in The Beginner's Guide, the story is good enough to make me want to know them. That makes replaying the game fun and interesting. But here, I honestly don't care. The story is bad to begin with, and that makes me just not care enough to bother to replay it. Also, the story has these seemingly random bits that are out of order, and are just dumb. The one that sticks out the most is the ending, in which [spoiler] you're driving on a motorcycle with a girl that loves you. You have to press e to continue, and when you do that she looks at you, and you get hit by a van, and then you switch into a car that gets hit a van. [/spoiler] It's just stupid. I bet this is some metaphor, but as I mentioned above, I don't care enough to bother to look into it.

Overall, I'd give it a 4/10. The settings are pretty good, and the soundtract is fantastic, but the 4 points I mention above really ruins the experience.

Next up, the technical side. I don't know who is responsible for this but making a game in 2012 using the Quake 2 Engine (1997) is just plain stupid. As a result of that, the game looks really bad and it crashed three times (and that during 10 minutes of playtime).

遊戲中加入很多閃回，好像有些人覺得很有創意，我只覺得乾我屁事

第二章主角是個特務(殺手?)反正就是做了一些帶入感很差的任務
中間我卡關，跑去看了別人的影片流程(對我沒打完)，總之就是要做一個天外飛來一筆的超難跳躍

然後被某個女人幹掉，給了一個莫名的閃回

Before things could get interesting, it's over.

I'd like to point out right away that the game did not like my computer. The game crashed multiple times after trying to change settings, and I managed to somehow die during the first jump cut...and then crash. Setting the game's executable to Windows 98 compatibility mode and setting the resolution options as launch parameters seemed to fix it.

I do quite like the art style, and the music and sound effects are excellent. It's just a shame that there's not too much of any of it.

That's not to say what's there is bad. I like the general presentation of the story, for the most part. Due to the jump cuts, it can be unclear on the exact order of events that occur. You're missing parts of the story, and what's there is out of order, but piecing it together isn't ridiculously complicated. That said, I can understand why it might confuse some.

As I said before, though, it feels like a pitch to raise money for a longer version of the game. I want more details on the story. What went wrong with the job they were on, and what was the job they were doing, anyway? You have to give a reason for people to care. A summary of a story never has the impact that the full story does.

My feelings about Gravity Bone, the prequel to this (and which is included in this package), can be summed up in pretty much the same way, with one additional complaint: the gameplay. While Thirty Flights of Loving is mostly a walking simulator with very limited activity, Gravity Bone has a few items that you pick up and carry in your inventory. While having  interactivity is fine in a walking simulator, Gravity Bone makes the mistake of making what limited interactivity is in the game repetitive and unenjoyable, and honestly could have been done better with either reduced/smarter use of it, or near complete removal of it.

If Blendo Games decides to come back to this universe, I'd really like a more fleshed out experience next time.

Gravity Bone has more interactivity, with items to use and quests to complete, but it is still extremely linear and vague in terms of what is happening.

[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]
[list]
[*]The story is unfortunately spastic and uninteresting, which really untangles this experience. I can see what they're going for, but too often does it jump around haphazardly and, if you look at the story overall, it's not very inventive. It's incredibly run-of-the mill, snack-sized spy tales.

[h1]BAD[/h1]
[list]
[*]Controls feel bad which, won't be a problem for most of the game since you barely have agency, but WILL matter if you attempt Gravity Bone where first person platforming is required. If you're wondering what it feels like to have a 9 minute game grind to a sudden halt, you'll find it at the flag poles.
[*]Quite frankly there just isn't much for you to do. In fact there's barely a need for the player to be there. Beyond buying this to support the developer, I honestly don't think any player will have any meaningful experience outside of just watching someone play this through a video site.

That's all it takes to beat this game. There are two ""stories"" you can play where both are you running around doing nothing. The game is a little like telltale games except the fact that you don't do anything of signifigance in this game but running around. It shows that the developer has put love into this game and spend his time with it but it is really nothing great. The music is half tom and jerry and half ruining my ears. The artstyle is clunky which is fine but i wouldn't compliment it. and the gameplay is just running around pressing E once in a while and that's it. There really isn't alot to this game and you're probably better off watching some show for 20 minutes. I did find the game a little fun playing but with such a high price and so little and boring gameplay is it not worth it at all.

Thirty Flights of Loving und Gravity Bone sind sicher keine wirklichen Spiele mit viel Spiel, sondern mehr ""Waling Simulator"" oder ""FPEX (First Person Exploration)"" Spiele, also Erkundings/Erlebniss Spiele in denen man eine Geschichte erlebt indem man durch die Gegend läuft und mit Objekten Interagiert.

In vielen Spielen funktioniert das dadurch, das man meist eine Geschichte durch viele Papier Schnippsel oder andere Sachen wie zum Beispiel Telefonate mitbekommt. 
[b]Thirty Flights of Loving macht in dem Punkt aber einiges anders.[/b]

Wir bekommen die Geschichte nur durch einige Level Umgebungen und hin und wieder etwas Text mit und müssen uns fast die Komplette Geschichte selber zusammen denken. 
Das kann einige schon abschrecken. Mich selbst hat es anfangs auch etwas gestört, vor allem da sich die beiden Titel völlig verschieden angefühlt haben, was die Geschichts Schnippsel angeht.

Mir hat das ganze beim ersten durchspielen auch etwas Kopfzerbrechen bereitet warum das nun so passiert ist oder die Geschichte so ausging. 
Danach habe ich mir das ganze mit den Entwickler Kommentaren angesehen, diese sind leider nur Textboxen die man im eigentlichen Spiel findet, daraufhin wurde mir einiges klar. Leider bleiben nach wie vor einige mehr oder weniger kleine Fragen offen.

Außerdem ist nicht ganz klar oder zumindest mir nicht, wie Gravity Bone sich in das ganze einfügt. Ich habe gehört das es vor Thirty Flights of Loving spielen soll, es wirkt aber wiederrum so als würde es danach spielen oder gar nichts mit dem Spiel zu tun haben. 

Wer abgedrehte Spiele ohne wirkliches Spiel sondern mehr mit Erkundung und ""Was geht hier gerade ab?"" Momenten mag, kann sich das Spiel vielleicht einmal ansehen. Dazu muss ich aber sagen, das ich das ganze (Thirty Flights of Loving/Gravity Bone und Thirty Flights of Loving mit Entwickler Kommentare Lesen) in ca. 0,9 Std. durch hatte. 

[b]Daher sollten alle die sich unsicher sind, vor allem wegen der Länge und der Geschichte des Spiels, zumindest ein Video zu Gravity Bone ansehen, das ganze spiegelt zumindest die Art des Spiels etwas wieder, wobei Thirty Flights of Loving noch weniger Spiel bietet als Gravity Bone, in letzterem hat man zumindest noch einige Interaktion mit Gegenständen.

Stories resonate for each of us differently, and maybe if I were in different circumstances it might have knocked a feeling or two loose. Who knows. I did enjoy it's sense of whimsy and adventure.

There are lots of great little details if you care to look for them. I did care, and played through two times, then another time with the commentary. One of the nice things about short, dense games is that the investment time is low and I can easily explore them again and see new things.

As for the crashing, how in the world can a game based upon the quake engine which is generally stable crash so often?

Theres almost no gameplay and a lot of story threads dont really get an ending or even make much sense off the bat.

Thirty Flights of Loving is a game developed by Blendo Games. The game forms part of the Citizen Abel series which also has a prequel known as Gravity Bone which is also include in the game

The game is extremely short, I completed everything the game had to offer in under 30 minutes and that for me is kind of ridiculous. I am not going to mention anything of the story because if I did I would tell you not to buy this game. The game is surprisingly developed on the Quake II and it shows as the game is horribly optimsed for modern systems, expect crashes if you want to play the game at 1920x1080

There are also some sound issues and graphical glitches which hinder the game. Honestly, this game should have been offered for free as what Blendo Games did for Gravity Bone. Honestly, the game is extremely short and I discovered what the game had to offer in a relatively short time. This includes finishing Thirty Flights of Loving, Gravity Bone and playing Thirty Flights of Loving with its developer commentary

Honestly, even for the price the game is offering now, I wouldn't recommend it at all. Wait until it's dirt cheap (which is what I had done) or (although I do not condone it) pirate it and just see what the game has to offer

Otherwise don't bother...

The game offers you a use item button, and a inventory system.  I found guns, I couldn't use, oranges that you can peel and eat (for no reason) and ... that's it. 

I can't express how low my opinion of the game, even when the game should be constricting you to a position (riding on a motorcycle, in a plane) you're able to free roam for no reason.  I'm riding on a bike and I can walk to the right or left, and yet still travel at the same speed as the bike, and then the game ends?

28 Febbraio 2014: recensivo questo gioco in maniera molto negativa a causa della mia mente chiusa che riusciva a vedere soltanto dentro la scatola.

Dopo 2 anni, l'ho finalmente rigiocato e devo dire che è un gioco molto strano e particolare. Sicuramente vuole dare un messaggio, anche se non ho ben capito di cosa vuole trattare. La trama sembra essere una spy-story o comunque la storia di questi tre criminali che devono fare un colpo, che sorprendentemente va male. Non si capisce nemmeno chi muore o chi vive, perchè alcuni personaggi muoiono più di una volta...

E' un gameplay lineare che fornisce informazioni attraverso la sola osservazione. Senza dubbio un curioso esperimento che vale la pena di giocare anche solo per farsi un'idea su uno sviluppatore indie che ormai è piuttosto conosciuto e da poco ha fatto uscire il suo nuovo gioco.

E' uno stile unico, accompagnato da una colonna sonora di qualità e da concept ed influenze interessanti.

Un bell'esperimento.

[Chiccha: la mia vecchia recensione di questo gioco... che risale a quando ero ancora un caprone ignorante]

''Non ne capisco il senso.

Ci sono giochi mind-♥♥♥♥ molto più interessanti e appaganti di questo titolo.
Qui non ci sono discorsi di senso compiuti, e la trama pare una valanga di non-sense che ti viene sbattuta in faccia con la parvenza che dietro ci sia qualcosa di altamente filosofico, anche se in realtà così non è.

Il gameplay è strano, anche palloso per certi sensi, e la durata del titolo non aiuta, ma è meglio così... 10 ore di questa roba non le digerirei proprio.

Insomma: bello stile grafico, interessante.. peccato che sia l'unica cosa del titolo ad avere questa qualità.

NON. COMPRATELO.''

I do know that it's a roughly 10-15 minute experience telling a story about spies... carrying out a heist? ...I think? What I do know is that it was created by Brendon Chung, the one-man team behind Blendo Games who is also responsible for Flotilla, Atom Zombie Smasher and the upcoming Quadrilateral Cowboy. Thirty Flights of Loving (TFOL) was created as part of a Kickstarter campaign to support the Idle Thumbs podcast, of which I am a frequent listener. According to Chung, TFOL was an excercise in creating a game that tells a story without any dialogue. TFOL is certinaly a realization of that concept, but I don't think it's very successful in telling a clear and understandable story

Part of the problem here is that in order to get the whole picture of what's going on in TFOL, you had to have played some of Chung's previous games. TFOL opens by announcing that it's the sequel to a game called Gravity Bone, which is jarring to anyone (myself included) who wasn't aware of Gravity Bone and was expecting TFOL to be a standalone experience. I found TFOL to be a pretty hard and confusing game to parse through. Part of it is the lack of any dialogue, part of it is the smash cuts and non-linear presentation of the story, and part of it is the expectation that the audience has also played Gravity Bone. By doing a bit of research and also watching an excellent video by Errant Signal, I was able to find out that Gravity Bone is part of Chung's long running series of games called ""Citizen Abel"". Now I'm not sure if playing all of the other Citizen Abel games helps TFOL make more sense, but that's a lot to expect your audience to do espiecially considering some of the older Citizen Abel games are Quake II and Half Life II mods. And if having played those games doesn't contribute anything to the understanding of TFOL, why brand it as the sequel to Gravity Bone? I acknowledge that some my confusion with the story may be my own fault for not having played the other games, but this was one of several nits I had to pick with this game.

As I mentioned earlier, the story in TFOL is told non-linearly and without any dialogue at all. As you might guess, it makes the story a bit hard to follow. Even though I played through the game twice to try to piece it together, I still can't come up with a reading on this game that isn't jumbled nonsense. I'd love to hear someone else's interpretation of the story though, if someone can actually manage to follow it and come up with an understanding.

I'm all for smaller games made for a specific audience, so I feel bad picking on the little guy here. Nevertheless, I found TFOL to be a short and confusing experiment in weird and nonsensical storytelling. I've now written quite a few words about a game that has none.

So learning he was behind Thirty Flights of Loving made me ecstatic to buy and play.

30 minutes after installing I can safely say I finished it. I went back for more to play the commentary mode as well.

For the price of a nice sandwhich, a game this short would leave me rather infuriated, I mean I bought Rogue Warrior for 5 dollars after it got marked down from 69.99 and I beat that in an hour and a half when I realized performing execution moves on enemies restored my health and left me invulnerable during the action. That game left me angered, Thirty Flights of Loving was completed in a drastically shorter term and yet I left feeling delighted, mesmerized and intrigued.

And above all, absolutely confused.

The game flips expectations, delivers exposition without a single spoken word, is vibrant and all over the place in terms of design, story and themes. And I loved every second of this bizarre, wild ride.

It's short and given the current price, may be a little bit too expensive for some considering the amount of time it takes to beat it. However, those looking for a unique experience and wanting have a piece of fiction leave them asking ""What!?"" at every scene should look no Further with Thirty Flights of Loving. :)

I gave it another go, powered through the included prequel Gravity Bone in about 20 minutes, and finished Thirty Flights proper in another 15.

TFoL is a very short narrative game about three people engaged in some less than legal dealings. The story is presented from first-person in a heavily stylized world that evokes the colorful spy thrillers of the late 60s and early 70s. There's little to do besides walk and trigger events, and the non-linear presentation of the tale makes it hard to follow exactly where you are and what is going on. It's an intense and confusing journey that's going to take more than a little digging on your part to make any sense of.

This is actually a pretty sharp contrast to Gravity Bone, which is a surreal vignette of the life of a spy. There's more interaction and actual gameplay there, with some exploration to do and simple inventory to use to accomplish your missions. A bizarre sense of humor that strays almost into Jazzpunk territory helps prop it up, and then it all ends quite suddenly, game and humor alike. I'm glad it's included with TFoL because it helps flesh out the strange world and its symbolism a bit, and finding the links between them is certainly interesting.

What you're getting is a heavily-stylized walking sim with loads of meaning behind the short, staccato scenes. The overall feel of the game is unsettled and almost dreamlike, inviting you to read into every part of the presentation. This isn't something like a Tale of Tales game where it's congratulating itself on how clever and meaningful it is, mind you. Every part of Thirty Flights of Loving simply is, it just exists to be experienced, and waits for you to divine the meaning for yourself. There is seriously not much game here, and it's hard to really suggest a purchase, but I consider my time with it well-spent. I might even revisit it to puzzle out more meaning, or just experience the 30-minute fever dream again.

And if nothing else, Thirty Flights of Loving presents one of the best explanations of the Bernoulli Principle I have ever seen. I don't think I've ever fully understood it until now, and I thank Blendo Games for that.

Told through a series of jump cuts, you and your allies arrange a heist but -- as seen in the introduction -- it goes horribly wrong. Jump cuts send you back to an earlier time, then one less idyllic, then one utterly chaotic.

Twists and turns develop -- was that a ********* person ******* in my ***? It is! And what about the **** at the end? Despite the game being on rails, the narrative is not. 

Wait, rails? That's right. The game, more of an interactive short film, is essentially you holding W to move from jump cut to jump cut, and occasionally pressing E to interact with an object. Do this often, I implore you!

If you want to control a character that'll shootmens and look down at his 4K-textured hands and shout in desperate confusion, ""What have I become?!"" then this isn't the game for you.

В данном случае этот опыт, когда тебе дают почувствовать мировоззрение резко отличающееся от своего собственного, в случае игры даже лучше, чем в случае книги, где есть связка автор-книга, а тут есть еще и играющий.

You'll spend those 15 minutes as an unnamed member of a team preparing an heist and excaping from it.
Also included, once you complete the game, is the first game ""Gravity Bone"" where you play as a spy in two different missions.

[b]PROS:[/b]

-charming graphics and art style

-top notch soundtrack

-extremely good story told in a condensed and non-linear way

-quirky sense of humour

-""Gravity Bone"" is just as good and gives you 15 more minutes of gameplay

[b]CONS:[/b]

-very short and linear

-while the soundtrack is very nice the sounds (guns, vehicles etc..) are unimpressive

The fact that, once it was over, I wished it'd have been longer, a full game, is a testament to the game's top notch narrative. But perhaps its power truly lies in how well it tells a story and engages you as a player in such a short time.

The game is indeed very short, linear and with little replay value but it'd be experienced at least once as a token of great storytelling: I agree the full price is too much for what it offers but it's absolutely worth it when on sale.",1436681334,1436681464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I was a really big fan of Gravity Bone, and so I bought this game even though I knew it would be short. However, while the length did not disappoint,the game did.

I found the characters to be memorable, if only in role rather than name. The story is interesting once it's broken down for you or played through multiple times. It's the Momento style of story-telling, not just a random series of events that some are making it out to be. There is a fleshed-out poignant tale buried somewhere under the condescension.

[b]⊖[/b] My overall time played was accrued through more than one playthrough. It is VERY short. For having such an interesting story, it's poorly told. The artsy factor actually detracts from the experience in this aspect. It would have been much better if the story to have been expanded upon, but I feel that's not what they were going for, for the sake of brevity. Unfortunately, a lack of any consequence makes it little more than a walking simulator that blows right by over the course of ten minutes or so.

[b]✎[/b] This game is not worth $5.s it a travesty upon gaming? A sin that cannot be redeemed? Is it the worst thing that has ever stolen the money of players everywhere? No. It's just an overpriced art game, so calm down and stop giving it so much hate for the sake of cheap comedy.

TFofL - игра-кино,боевик и драма,экшен и чёрный юмор. Всё это предстаёт для нас в виде фильмов Тарантино,хотя этот фильм исключение - смотрится за 5 минут! Да,эту игру можно пройти за пару минут и она успеет показать нам всё.

Сюжет: Трое героев собрались провернуть большое ограбление и что из этого вышло. Так-же тут есть ещё одна игра про агента в стиле Бонда и что случилось с ним.

Графика: Типо мультик,с персонажами которых можно распечатать на бумагу,а после вырезать и сделать фигурки. Ну знаете,есть такие...которые вырезал,да. Остальное держится на уровне,в некоторых местах я был разочарован. Однако локации интересные.

Геймплей: W,S,A,D + Е,ПРОБЕЛ,ЛКМ. А большего и не надо! Это же кино. В некоторых местах можно взаимодействовать с предметами и объектами,например: взять мандаринку,почистить, съесть со вкусным звуком,после которого самому хочется. Остальное происходит само,мы лишь отчасти принимаем участие.

Саундтрек: Аля Тарантино,а в других местах музыка напоминала старые фильмы. Звуки хороши,для такого всё ок.

Итог: Если вы знакомы с творчеством Тарантино или просто классических боевиков,то советую ознакомиться. Не шедевр,но годно. Я мало чего могу объяснить,просто это нужно самому пройти.

Overall, this game is quite special because you basically go from point A to point B, you get teleported suddenly between sections and there are no connections between those. I liked the included prequel (Gravity Bone) way more than Thirty Flights of Loving because it had objectives.

Is it an adventure game, an action game, an art game, or an elegiac love poem? Well, it’s all of these and none. 30 Flights is an indie gamer's indie game. It occupies the same experimental vein as Proteus, The Path, and Journey. I know that may scare some of you off, but it shouldn’t. TFOL is basically a slick crime caper gone awry. Like Reservoir Dogs? You’ll probably enjoy this.

As one comes to expect from indie indies, TFOL features simple graphics, quirky humor, an innovative yet enigmatic narrative structure, and great music. Despite its age, the Quake 2 engine has never looked this good. The blocky retro-visual style is utterly charming: think Minecraft meets No One Lives Forever.

Thirty Flights of Loving focuses its sharp satirical lens on the over-the-top cinematism rife in video games and their tendency to imitate big-budget Hollywood Action movies. But it is also a powerful and moving homage to the stylish, discontinuous narration of French New Wave films. The game has often been compared to the work of Tarantino, but both the plot and razor sharp editing owes more to the formal innovations of Jean-Luc Godard's seminal film, A bout de souffle. 

Much of the central game experience involves trying to piece together its intricately crafted story. Temporal and spatial leaps await the player at every turn. Brendon Chung has a knack for capturing the gritty underworld vernacular that our anti-heroes inhabit. Interspersed throughout the game are moments of transcendent beauty. In one, Anita sits peeling oranges overlooking her vast apartment courtyard. The sound is particularly used to great effect here, realistically capturing the nocturnal soundscape of a large urban metropolis. In the climactic gunfight, the action recalls the poetic rhythm of Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. Without relying on dialogue text, voiceover narration, or UI, Brendon Chung manages to convey an entire world and story through the environment.

To what degree any of this makes sense depends on the player’s perception. What exactly went down at Cugat airfield? Who is Winston Borges (a.k.a. Mo Golden, Moco Rococo, The Big Pai-Goo)? Is Bernoulli’s Principle the key to unlocking this puzzle? These are just some of the many questions you’ll ask yourself in 30 Flights of Loving.",1423203401,1423203401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The game can literally be beaten in around 20 - 30 minutes. Now, one might argue that the game is still enjoyable for the ""art"" or ""story"", but the game has neither that are exceptional. You can try to dissect some hidden meanings or interpret the vague ending anyway you want, but there is NOTHING there. This is the type of game that's left ambiguously vague because the creator is just uncreative and is taking advantage of dumb people. The game has NO replay value. It isn't a short and quick game because there is no game at all. It's not like a quick arena game that's addicting and you want to replay, no, it's nothing of the sort. And as I mentioned before, it isn't even a game that you'd want to replay to see if you can interpret the deep and powerful meaning behind the game's story. I will now write out the entire game to you right now.

You walk down some stairs into a bar.
Two guys just stare at you. You can't talk to them.
You smash a few bottles to try and intice a response. The two guys continue to stare and not care.
You go into a ""hidden"" door to your secret base where you meet your two best companions.
Staring female and staring male. Interacting with them shows two soundless cutscenes (approx 30 seconds long) of their ""professions"".
Their professions imply they are thieves and are about to make a heist of sorts with you.
You can pick up some guns and ammunition on the tables. This does nothing at all. You're essentially clicking them to make them disappear.
You go into a plane.
Scene changes instantly.
Oh no, your best friend, staring guy, is bleeding on the ground.
You push him around an airport in a cart because you're weak and can't carry him.
The airport is crowded with rejected minecraft characters that ignore your prescence and walk through you.
Flashback to you and staring girl in an apartment. Implications you two are in love.
You walk up a stairwell. There are more staring people on the rooftop having drinks.
You sit with staring girl.
Scene changes instantly.
You go back to pushing your dying best friend, staring guy, around in the airport.
You get a gun suddenly and shoot birds(?) out of the air. (THIS IS THE ONLY GAMEPLAY IN THE GAME ASIDE FROM WALKING AND THERE IS NO CONSEQUENCE IF YOU DO NOT SHOOT THE WHITE BIRD THINGS. YOU HAVE NO AMMO. NOTHING MATTERS.)
You get into a car with staring guy. The car drives by itself.

The end.

You beat the game goodjob. Yes, it was 30 minutes even with taking your time. Yes, that was the whole game. Yes, you paid ten dollars. Yes, that's all you're getting. Yes, you didn't miss anything or unlock anything. You're still going to replay it out of disbelief of being ripped of so hard, aren't you? Okay, go for it. ...You back? Yes, that was indeed it. No, I agree. It wasn't profound and it didn't change your life. Yes, I'm upset with it too. Yes, it is odd how people are actually recommending this game. No, I don't think there is a coincidence that it is mostly tumblr beasts raving about how good the game is. Yes, I agree that we can only hope God gives them a quick and painless death and takes their blogs with their souls to hell.

Gravity bone had exploration, challenges and gameplay. Thirty flights of loving has none of this, as other people have said it is a ""interactive"" movie. Well the only interaction is with the W key to walk forward, If you like linear ""tunnel"" gameplay then maybe it's you're type of game. The transitions between sections are the worst jumps of any game and create a confusing and chaotic experience. 
More work was put into the end credits area and the ""how aircraft work"" section, I'm not kidding a whole room is dedicated to showing how air flows over wings and what creates lift, Really if I wanted a game about planes I would play Flight simulator X or IL2. Overall this game lets down its prequel, if you want an interesting gameplay experience play Gravity Bone, or chess
I understood the story and it still disappointed me and left me feeling ripped off.

Short game that is told in scenes in a asynchronous way. 

Blendo games is known for releasing games that take radical different approach to story telling and does this again in this game. It's like you watch the most important pieces of a movie shuffled around. The game has some activity where you have to walk and solve some easy puzzles (?) to advance, but other than that it is just enjoying the scenery, trying to understand and connect the story.

The game was build in a modified Doom engine using a typical style which totally fits the game mechanics. Audio and soundtrack are great and fit the game perfectly.

You can speed run this game in 5 minutes I think, but normally when you relax and enjoy the game it should take about 30 minutes. Because the story is so jumpy, it invites you to play it again just to look at the parts again. 

In the end the game reminds you that a game doesn't have to be long to be good and that a story can also be told by leaving out all the unnecessary parts.",1411625778,1424003242,True,39,0,0.621672630310058594,0,True,False,False,False,,,

First and foremost this is more a short interactive story than a game, there's not a lot of player input.

As a story this is incredibly well put together, you'll play through it the first time and kind of know what's going on, and then you'll probably end up playing through it maybe 2 to 3 times more as you try to figure out the sequence of events. Plus the games wacky art style and music are more than worth the price of admission. I'm honestly a huge fan of this game.

On a side it comes with the prequel ""Gravity Bone"" which is also awesome and features the same type of style, so there's two reasons to buy it.

Gravity Bone had some stuff resembling puzzles where you needed to think what to do, but this didn't improve or expand on that at all, and actually cutted back on that, to the point it almost felt like a short film instead of a game.
The good points about this game are the ambience, the story and the music.

This is not Memento.  Instead this is 28 Grams.  It is a trivial story where the designer said to himself ""Wouldn't I be brilliant if I just threw all of the information at the player at random!  Yes!  Yes I would be brilliant!""
You can finish the game in under 15 minutes.  I have a hard time even calling it a game because it has less interaction than Dear Esther or Gone Home.  It also doesn't have any of the actual story elements or choices that usually accompany a visual novel.  It is more of an esoteric experiment.
There are people who will love this game.  The ones that ""get"" it will be head over heels about it and consider the designer as brilliant as he clearly considers himself to be.
Everyone else should stay far, far away.

Только все они забывают, что игры в первую очередь являются интерактивным искусством, и самая важная часть повествования передаётся через игровой процесс.

Несмотря на то что снимки экрана выглядят стильно, а музыкальная подборка довольно хороша - сюжет и сценарий совершенно простенькие, да и повествовательных элементов в окружении не так, чтобы достаточно. С технической стороны тоже не всё гладко, программа умудрилась ""вылететь"" трижды, за то непродолжительное время.

А боевики о Джеймсе Бонде? Фильмы Квентина Тарантино/Роберта Родригеза? Тогда Thirty Flights of Loving для вас.

Thirty Flights of Loving это продолжение игры Gravity Bone, истории о бандитах из 60-х, и еще пары игр, в которые никто все равно не играл. 

Говорить о Thirty Flights of Loving примерно то же самое, что пытаться пересказать сон недельной давности. Это та игра, которая попросту переворачивает все каноны повествования в видеоиграх, по ходу прохождения всячески привлекая к истории самое пристальное внимание, используя классические для exploitation-movie постановочные ходы (в операторской, режиссёрской работе).

Эта игра – просто праздник для глаз, учитывая то, что все выполнено с использованием пиксельных кубиков. Но это и прибавляет определенного шарма данной графической новелле.
Итог: про Thirty Flights of Loving не нужно читать. В неё нужно играть. Игра получилась насколько неоднозначной, настолько же интересной. Такая игра – редкий гость на рынке. Их почти никто не покупает, но это не делает игру хуже. И тем, кому она понравилась, она понравилась по-настоящему.

These great decisions are along the lines of weird random jump cuts  that change the entire scenario for no reason. There's also a room with displays of a bunch the game models and animated GIF video timelapses of screenshots of their creation. How impressive is that?

Also, there's a scene at a wedding where the characters randomly start rising up towards the ceiling. The developer notes say this was a bug, that they left in because it was so much better.

Perhaps it was because I had gone into the game with high expectations (friends saying it was great, Extra Credits recommending it, and it having an overall 88/100 Metacritic score), but I expected a great game. A good game. At least a decent game… when I beat the game, I had a sour taste in my mouth, exclaiming “what the fuck? That’s it?!? …”. It’s difficult to say that I feel “burned” in my purchase due to the fact that I paid about $1.50 and the fact that I didn’t do any research other than “other people generally like it” (something I would chastise someone else doing)…but I feel incredibly disappointed in the game. 

The first thing that I simply must state is the fact that it is short. I was “warned” of this beforehand, and I was cool with it. I’m fine with short games, so long as they “last” a bit (my view is one hour, thirty minutes and on is acceptable in most circumstances)…but this game lasted exactly 12 minutes. Yeah…12 minutes, from when I started it, to when I was done with the entire game. The fuck? I confused about the plot and game in general (I’ll discuss that shortly), so immediately after the game was over, I decided I was going to play it again to see what I was missing. Surely I missed something in regards to the plot or something. Thankfully, I thought, there’s a developer commentary, and so I selected that. Now, normally, this does a lot for me; as someone who’s obtained a degree in the field I find these things fascinating… but I was immensely disappointed in the commentary. Most of it was describing things that frankly wasn’t interesting (“Normally, ninety-degree angled hallways aren’t great, but after adding a bevel…”, “…I don’t approve of littering.”, etc.) and even after stopping to listen to the commentary, not only did it not shed any more light on the plot, but it lasted 15 minutes (with me taking my time and exploring, too). That adds up to 27 minutes. For beating the game twice. That’s not acceptable.

I was interested in reading some of the critic’s comments on why they enjoyed the game, and a reoccurring theme was that they enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the story, and the frequent use jump-cuts. I didn’t. Let me explain what happens in the story ([u]spoilers, obviously[/u]): you start in a hallway, letting you learn the controls of the game (WASD for movement, mouse for camera, tough stuff). You then enter a bar, unable to interact with any of the characters, who oddly stare into your soul. All you can do is consume alcohol (which does nothing, I add, other than disappearing and making a sound), and interact with a fake painting (which is among numerous paintings), opening up a secret passage, leading to the introduction of two characters (which is, admittedly, my favorite part of the game, although that’s not saying much). After this, you board a plane, and, after you leave, you’re immediately thrown into an unknown situation: your romantic interest is pointing a gun at you, in a strange location, and bloody. This is just a short summary of what you’ll encounter. And, sadly, this is about a third of the game. There’s so many random cuts to different parts of the story that you never really learn enough about the characters to care about them (and, I’m not sure if I’ve emphasized this already, but the game is short). Perhaps, in a strange way, peeling oranges with your loved one might be an intimate moment between two characters and the player, but when you’ve known the character for about two minutes, it didn’t mean anything to me. Also, I simply have to pose the question: why the hell were there three rooms dedicated to “Bernolli’s Principle” (something to do about high and low air pressure)?  

So…yeah…I tried to be objective about this game and find redeeming qualities, but I just don’t see any. I mean, it’s a functional game, I guess…?

[b][u]TL;DR:[/b][/u] Literally twelve minutes long, extremely brief and ambiguous plot, commentary about 90 degree hallways. Don’t waste your time with this game, no matter the price.

It's just a load of kiss ♥♥♥ crap.

It's shorter than a midget's as$hole.If you blow it through it's less than 10 minutes.I had to play this twice just to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong or avoiding anything crucial.And then I played once more with additional commentary - it made me even more of a unsatisfied towards the entire game from how carelessly thrown together it seems to be based on how the comments were written. I literally kept thinking in my head 'This has to be a f*cking joke' once I saw ""The End"" and game related credits in the muesem full of generated people in bundles of three that only consist of three different character models spammed throughout the entire location and some things regarding airplanes. Because yeah- gotta add some flying related thing for the sake of adding depth to the title ""Thirty Flights of Loving"" other than you having a romance for some b*tch that almost killed your best man.

Basically the game is literally contsructed based on mistake after mistake, yes sometimes imperfections add charm, but in this case it just seems like they were simply too lazy to bother fixing the issue and they decided to cover it up thoughtlessly. It was just like ""Oh ..sh!t the crowd generator is causing peope to float in the wedding scene!?! That's alright! Let's just add some blurry effects while the player drink off the bottles while everyone else is dancing- and make the player assume they're so drunk that they can no longer correlate reality from alcoholic delusions!Why?Because it's ARTSY and adds a NARRATIVE touch in the game!!!""

The gameplay itself feels like you're on a grid, you get tossed from one scene to the next.Its also rather disorientating and disrupts the entire flow of the 'story' it is trying to convey. I really don't see how it's artistic.I see it as lazy,choppy,painfully short,and dull. It's not even very aesthetically pleasing for the simplicity of the graphics.It would be able to get away with it IF (and I emphasize if) it was a deep and enriched story telling game. But sadly- it fails miserably on that aspect.So yeah, not only it's FUGLY- but it's stupid.

The game also includes its prequel called ""Gravity Bones"" and I found it to be a bit more interesting, and innovative than it's sequel.Its even to my surprise a tad longer..But it still doesn't help the game as its own indvidual piece. It just felt like I ate a stale and bland cupcake with just a bit more sprinkles and frosting than the last one.

TL:DR It ain't worth it at all.
I'm surprised they even had the guts to call itself a 'game' the only thing you really do is walk around , sometimes press 'e' and get slammed with ♥♥♥♥ty sequences the second you step on a area that triggers it.It's sloppy, it's short. It's dull and it takes the the pride in being vague which in their language means artistic when in reality it's meaningless rubbish.I've never seen a game that costs five dollars but it's just as valuable as a crummy indie flash game you can find online for free.

[b][i]I didn't really understand the game until I read the excellent explanation [u]below[/u] from Reddit.[/i][/b]

""Says [b]Jazzputin[/b]:
Here's what I think went down.
1. You are a thief. You meet with two other master thieves, Anita and Borges, who have planned a heist. You proceed to fly to a building at which the robbery takes place. [SHOWN]
2. You spend a day in the hotel planning/waiting for the heist (this the part where you see Anita throwing orange peels off the building). [SHOWN]
3. As part of the heist you must pose as party guests, so you attend a party on the roof and everyone gets drunk. [SHOWN]
4. You hook up with Anita (this is where things start to go wrong in the story). [SHOWN]
5. You and Anita wake up in a hungover stupor; Borges is missing. [NOT SHOWN]
6. Because the whole gang got drunk and woke up hungover and not ready for the heist, the heist is not set up properly and goes terribly wrong. Borges and Anita are both seriously injured. [NOT SHOWN]
7. You and Borges escape through a mall/airport sort of place. [SHOWN] Anita manages to escape on her own somehow, despite her injuries. [NOT SHOWN]
8. You and Borges, still escaping, face a standoff with police. [NOT SHOWN]
9. During the standoff, Anita arrives in a getaway car, you get in and a chase ensues. [NOT SHOWN]
10. The chase becomes deadly once Borges starts shooting at the police. At this moment the seriousness of the situation hits you; you realize you will not make it out of this. At this moment you have a fantasy: you realize you are in love with Anita, and you fantasize how nice it would be if you, her and Borges could live a simpler life if you just got away (the motorcycle scene). [SHOWN]
11. In real life your car approaches a head-on collision with a semi, you can hear/see the semi in your dream and you come back to reality, and your car collides head-on with the semi. [SHOWN]

I think the very end is ambiguous on purpose; it's not clear whether you survived the crash or died. The lobby you find yourself at the end could be a metaphor for the afterlife, or an extended life-flashing-before-your-eyes time for your character where he views previous parts of his life like museum exhibits.""",1392486447,1392486720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It's a technique I've of course experienced in many many films, but I don't think I've [i]ever[/i] seen it used in games before, and it's a wonderful way of both creating (or perhaps emulating) a certain style, and putting you in the headspace needed to make the most of each scene.

Thirty Flights of Loving takes approximately 15 minutes to get through and by the end of it, you're left thinking what you just played. I won't call it a game because like Dear Esther, it is an interactive story. The story in Thirty Flights is non-linear, meaning you're told the story in the incorrect order and you're essentially left to piece it all together. While this is a plus, as it helps you take the story as you're required to pay attention and really think about it, the story is nowhere near long enough to be worth the amount you pay.

Typically, I would say that for every £1 (or $1) you spend, a game should give you one hour of gameplay. Now this game is £4, so following that system, you should get 4 hours of gameplay, but even with Gravity Bone included, you don't get that much gameplay, since there is very little replay value. I would say this is the kind of game you would find on a free games website, not something you would pay for. It's just not worth it.

Just to clarify why I liked Dear Esther and not Thirty Flights, Dear Esther actually has some level of replay value, since each time you play, the script changes.

However, i have the same issue that i had with ""Dear Ester"". These games are great but they last a very short time. Also, they have virtually zero re-play value.

It's a challenge to describe this game without giving it away. It plays more like an interactive short film than anything. The story is told in anachronic order with sudden cutwaways and relies on the scenery and subtle (and not so subtle) cues to tell the player what's happening.
It's short and sweet, and a great achievement in the medium.

Do I recommend this? Yes and no. A very niche sector of gamers would like this. The player character does very little and the lack of action may rub some people the wrong way (well except maybe for Gravity Bone, the free to play prequel included in this release, which has some action).

The 'director's commentary' is very enlightening to bring a more mundane approach to the story, highlighting small details, to help gamers that found the story too confusing to begin with.  The game is sometimes so subtle in the story that smaller details can go completely unnoticed.

I completed the entire game (seriously, everything the game offered), in 75 minutes.

I thought it was fun, but this game is better suited for aspiring game creators as a prototype to learn the art of storytelling than it is an actual game for most people.

The game functions much like a film though it isn't, there is little interactivity but that seems to be the point of the experiance. I classify it as a game because there is interactivity, you the player are a part of the stary and you can interact (however limited) with the world around you unlike a film. From what I understand the game seems to be an experiment to try to fit as much story into a limited time frame, and with no dialogue. And to that it succeeds, even without dialogue the game accurately portrays a story just from the very limited character models and it even makes it engaging. It's paced well and is just overall really well made, especially for a game running on the Quake engine.

Most people rate games according to stringent rule sets, going through a bullet point list of expected content or features, which in my opinion is wrong! Games always have a focus - sometimes that focus is a balance between gameplay and story, sometimes between systems and level design. Thirty Flights and Gravity Bone lay their focus upon the narrative, its delivery and the world they are set in. Both games are very characterful in every way. The narrative, visuals and music of both games are extremely charming, and in some ways reminded me somewhat of Tarantino flicks. Both games are short (though longer than 5 minutes as some have stated), but this is as a result of the focus on narrative, and trying to put the player in the right mood, at the right time, and telling the story in a way that makes sense (with a bit of fun along the way). 

I went through both games, and the commentary version of Thirty Flights, and spent just under an hour.

I'm going to address that hate. If you want to see the review of the game itself, scroll down to ""The Game(s) Itself""
What I'm seeing mainly boils down to this:

[b]1) It costs too much.
2) It's too short.[/b]
As for the cost, well, this was previously featured in a Humble Bundle. So it was part of a package, where you had freedom to set a price. Currently, it's barely over $1 on the Holiday Sale.
Is the normal asking price of $5 too much? Well, I would say yes, actually. The two games to me are effective, but very quick and not very good on replay unless you wait a while between plays, so it feels fresh on the next playthrough.
I say a range of about $2-3 would be better, though a ""Set your own"" option would be perfect. (if that's possible on Steam...not sure.)

Now for the game length.
Unfortunately, the 1st game, ""Gravity Bone"", seems downplayed by not even being mentioned as available in the ""About the Game"" section, it just states that this is the sequel to it.
I played through the 1st and 2nd game. It's found through ""Career"" in your Menu. Altogether, I spent about forty-five minutes, mainly because I got stumped in Gravity Bone while...looking for some birds. I even had to make a savepoint.
Anyway, I found a great balance between the two:
Gravity Bone is focused on the gameplay. More about finishing ""Objectives"".
Thirty Flights is focused on story and emotion.
Played back to back, you get far much more of a complete feel. The character is also the same across games.
Playing Gravity Bone first is better, since Gravity Bone is not as big on story and introduces you to the mechanics of the game. Also, a character in Gravity Bone later makes a cameo in Thirty Flights.

If one only plays Thirty Flights of Loving, I can completely understand that one would feel a bit underwhelmed by the rapidfire pace. Gravity Bone helps set up the story.

[b]The Game(s) Itself[/b]

For what these games are, I think both managed to be extremely effective. They present experiences well without dragging things out, without filler or fluff, and with virtually no dialogue, as far as I remember.

While playing these, instead of trying to rush through like you're speedrunning or something, it's good to at least let yourself get immersed in the games a bit.
Due to the nature of the storytelling, it's like placing yourself in someone's shoes for a while. What stood out to me is that by the end of each, you can come away from them feeling a good bit of connection to the story, especially in the case of Thirty Flights.

I personally think the way these games manage to present their stories well in such a short time frame is a great representation of what games can do. I would say I am quite proud that there is something like this that is challenging, even debatable (when considering the negative reviews) available to us gamers.

I eagerly await the next game from Blendo;  hopefully this time around with a pay-what-you-will option, or at least a lower cost.

NOTE: Two technical issues I did face. Gravity Bone crashed once while in fullscreen, I went to windowed, and never had that issue again. One small fix that would be worth the developer taking care of. Also my screen brightness seems to have been changed by the game, and I can't find out what specific system setting was altered. This does use the Quake 2 engine, so I may look into that...but I did manage to change it back through the brightness setting in the game until things looked calibrated again.",1388137993,1420771723,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Speaking as someone who loved Dear Esther, and even Thirty Flights' developer's previous game ('Gravity Bone', which is included here as a free extra), I found myself thoroughly bewildered by Thirty Flights of Loving.

I was bewildered by the sloppy non-linear storytelling. The game hops, skips, and leaps, with all the grace of a big rig in a tutu. I've played through the whole game and read several summaries to make sure I wasn't missing anything, but even once I made sense of the story being told (a by-the-books tale of a criminal caper gone wrong), it didn't connect with me at all.

I was bewildered by the lack of flow within the gameplay. For such a short game, I was astonished to find myself stuck on at least two occasions. Normally I'd be the last person to call for such handholding tactics as blatant signposting or railroading of the player, but in this case the current state is completely at odds with the intended purpose. The developer obviously wants to tell a story, but I found it a trial just to get to the next part. This is not to mention the pointless interactions in the game which sometimes seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.

I was bewildered by the end. It came out of nowhere, and left me with the strongest feeling of 'is that it?' I think I've ever encountered with a game. I spent more time in the options menu than I did with the game itself. I wouldn't mind if it was some kind of masterpiece of storytelling, but it just wasn't.

Most of all, I was and am bewildered by the praise this game has garnered. 88% (at the time of writing) on Metacritic. Critical acclaim. Fans on the forums defending it to the hilt. I saw similar reactions to Dear Esther (which, as I said earlier, I felt deserved every bit of its praise), but I genuinely cannot understand it in this case.

Maybe I'm missing something huge here, but Thirty Flights of Loving was not an enjoyable, enlightening, or otherwise entertaining experience for me. I respect any developer who attempts to tell stories through games, but this feels like one of the more unfinished, unfocused efforts that I have played.

I like it however because it has an action film mood about it, the way that the game silently tells its story and that the game tells its story in such a small amout of time. there are of problems with this game that i think most players can agree with me on. 

1) Price; It is not value for money and the fact that I, have played around 15 minutes of it, porves that it might aswell be an  animation that used uploaded on to YouTube.
   A) Offers; I got this game when it was cheap and when it was on offer and for the price that it was at I thought that it was a fair price for such a small game.

2) Addons; The game comes with its sound tack that you can find in the games files and it also comes with it 'Documentry' you play the game agian only this time there's text bubbles, EVERYWHERE, every 5 steps you take theres a bubble of text that you have to read.

3) The 4th wall; At the end of the game it breaks the 4th wall to the point where the credits are part of the game and also they explain in game the pyshics of the games engine.

So I occasionally try out games like this, in hopes that I will find something moving, inspiring, and interesting - not always expecting something fun. I'm willing to forgo the fun if the experience is enough by itself.

So when Thirty Flights of Loving went on sale, I checked review sites to see what they said. Right away I noticed a strong discord between the scores of professional reviewers and the scores given by the players. Simply put, reviewers seemed to love it, and players seemed to hate it. I decided to try it out anyway, in case my sense of art might give me some insight which the lower-scoring players lacked.

Unfortunately for Thirty Flights, after playing through the game, I have to side with the players on this one. This game isn't fun, and really just isn't that interesting.

The story is one you've seen many times in movies and on TV, but this time it's told via a cast of vaguely humanoid boxes. Reviewers called this game ""lovingly crafted"", but after the opening scene, it all felt incomplete to me. More like a sketch before the eventual painting.

At the end, which comes very quickly, you'll wonder what you just did for the last half hour. And then, like me, you'll probably wonder why you didn't do somethign else instead. You might even get mad that you spent money for this.

Don't get me wrong here - I don't like insulting the work of people who are clearly forging ahead into new, wonderful territory with games. It's tough for me to write such a negative review. But I don't feel like Thirty Flights is worth the praise reviewers gave it, and I wish that more time had be spent making it coherent, thoughtful, and even fun.

Keep in mind, however, that Gravity Bone was released as freeware, and while I do not recommend Thirty Flights of Loving at all, Gravity Bone is something that I recommend highly.

Gravity Bone is neat for a number of reasons. Despite being low-tech, the art style is quite striking, and it is used to great effect in a couple of set-pieces within the game. In fact, it is one of the few things that is retained in its sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving. Gravity Bone itself is quite short however, involving only a couple of missions with various objectives. All of this is done in the first-person perspective, but the game is not what you would call a first-person shooter. Now, I do wish that there was more to the game, as the missions themselves play out nicely, and they work as an excellent demonstration on how to engage the player without having them shoot at things constantly, which is often the case in the first-person games that it resembles. And the game comes together wonderfully at the end, with a fast-paced end sequence, and an ending that is on the good side of eccentric and confusing, which wraps up the tale very well. All taking place with full input of the player, save for the end sequence. But here this brief absence of control is justified perfectly within the contextual landscape the game has painted.

So while Gravity Bone is a demonstration of where first-person games could take us, Thirty Flights of Loving instead presents us with a few brief minutes of scarcely interactive slideshow, composed of random elements devoid of context, all taking place along a non-linear timeline. It is a mess of a presentation, and one which is just plain confusing, and there ends up being nothing thought provoking at all in the experience. What it does have are some references to Gravity Bone, but those come off as disconnected and pointless, as well as other similarly ineffective references to other things which have no bearing to what you are doing. However, there are some hidden environmental details that are revealed if you pay attention, but they have no real bearing within Loving's framework, given how non-interactive the experience is.

Now, I would not normally be so harsh on a sequel for being different. However in this case, not only is it different, those new features only detract from the experience. All that Thiry Flights of Loving manages to be, is a slideshow of variously surreal and not-so-surreal scenes cobbled together, and which do not actually require the player to be present in the slightest, and the entire game is over in under ten minutes. Where Gravity Bone was an engaging and impressive demonstration of how you could tell a story in the first-person, Thirty Flights of Loving is just an incomplete set of narrative fragments which are left to the played to  struggle to reconstruct. Even then, without any real input from the player, one must wonder what motivation the player is meant to have to attempt this, when the fragments are so far-flung, and the reward for collecting them so unsatisfying.

As far as picking up this game goes, you could say that you picked it up in order to give some recognition to Gravity Bone. But by itself, there really is no reason whatsoever to play Thirty Flights of Loving.",1385429981,1385526370,False,8,0,0.420503377914428711,0,False,False,False,False,,,

A lot of the praise for TFOL has to do with how it doesn't bombard you with narrative and hold your hand with mindless cutscenes. They say it lets you figure out the story for yourself. Well, to that I say good luck. If you can find a coherent story in TFOL somewhere then I laud your truly magnificent gift of insight. I challenge anyone sitting on their pretentious thrones of higher criticism to tell me what the plot and story in this game are. My guess is no one really knows.

The world is kind of cute. And things like rushing through mobs of fast-moving people in an airport with a wounded team member slung over your shoulder to a soundtrack reminiscent of James Bond and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (a la Quentin Tarantino) are novel and a little exciting. But your actions affect nothing. It's basically a slide show. There was no purpose for several the key bindings (not kidding) and none of the objects you can pick up have any function whatsoever.

Thirty Flights of Loving é uma das experiências de jogo mais curiosas dos últimos tempos, não só pelos seus curtos, mas fantásticos, 10 minutos, mas pelo preço que nos pedem por uma sessão de jogo que dura menos tempo que um café. Vai ser impossível ficarem indiferentes quando chegarem, rapidamente, ao final e o misto de emoções pelo qual vão passar, do espanto à indignação é em si uma nova forma de jogar.

After having completed this game multiple times now, I am left speechless. This is an incredibly engaging and unique experience that is simply incomparable to anything else out there. There is no way for me to tell you anything about the game without spoiling it. I would even advise against watching the trailer. What I will say is that this game is purely about story, and not about gameplay. Consider it a virtual picture book of sorts. 

That being said, this game is only 10 minutes long. You heard correctly. Ten minutes. If you include the second campaign in the package (which was the first project by this studio) you have a total of around 20 minutes. So if you are going to buy the game, get it on sale for a couple dollars. In my humble opinion, the money is well worth it.",1382055199,1434427633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Played from a first-person view, there is virtually no traditional gameplay, aside from being able to interact with the environment and explore its nooks and crannies. The soundtrack and the sound design are great, as well as its graphical presentation. The blocky characters, the usage of color, and the varied environments all mesh together into a game that looks quite unlike any other.

But yes, there is nothing the player really does in the game, at least, not in the traditional sense. The real reason to play this game is for its story and, more specifically, the way the game presents its story. By employing the mechanics of film editing and cutting freely between events and scenes without any sort of input from the player, Thirty Flights of Loving spins the classic yarn of a heist gone horribly wrong in a wholly unique way. Its non-linearity and hectic pace is a refreshing change from the banality of most video game narratives, and the player truly has to work in order to understand everything that's happening. While the game can be completed in fifteen minutes or so, the scope and depth of the story told is one that far exceeds its actual runtime. Multiple playthroughs are not only necessary but also inevitable.

Thirty Flights of Loving is certainly not for everyone. Many players have expressed outrage or frustration at the fact that the ""game"" isn't really much of one at all. Brendon Chung, the creator of the game, has himself described it as ""an interactive short story"". Ultimately, it does not matter. Thirty Filghts of Loving is a very important game, because it makes a legitimate attempt to tap into the vast potential for video games as a narrative medium. If that sounds at all interesting to you, go play Thirty Flights of Loving. It's an experience that you won't soon forget.",1369341065,1385418836,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I have put an absurd amount of hours into Atom Zombie Smash, and enjoyed my time in Flotilla.  I more recently discovered that another Blendo Game, Gravity Bone, was available on free from the studio's website, and after playing it, decided to throw down the $5 to play Thirty Flights of Loving.

I'm not sure it was worth it.

First thing's first: 30 Flights is really short.  I played through the game once normally and again with ""developer commentary"" on, and it took just a bit over a half hour combined.  I know it shouldn't be a factor, but as someone with a small amount of free money, I have to think about time value.  While I had fun with 30 Flights, I'm not sure I had $5 worth of fun.

That said, 30 Flights is fun.  It isn't a game, really...more of a short story told from a first person view.  It's a pretty wild ride, shifting from quiet moments to in-your-face intense moments with jarring smash cuts that fit the tone of the game well.  

If you are curious about the game, I'd recommend giving Gravity Bone a spin first, which is available free at the Blendo Games site.  If you like it, go ahead and play 30 Flights...but I'd recommend waiting for a sale.

The game is incredibly short. 15-20 minutes long, but succeeds in delivering you a firm understanding of an interesting story in that time, using dynamic scene changes and blends.

A decent injection from Blendo, but I expected more, from their clearly very talented team.

A lot of people don’t, but I like unique “arty farty” kinds of 'games' like this. ‘Game’ because it seems there’s been quite a few debates as to whether or not this is a game. I’ve heard a lot of people say it isn’t and say it made no sense, but I personally thought it was fun.
In fairness, at the time I had no idea what I was doing or playing or what the hell was was going on at any point of time, I finished it and to be honest was a little impressed. But more so confused.
I like the way it was done, it had a very fast paced kind of 'movie action scene' feel going on, and I even went and played through it again with the developer commentary. It explained some elements of it, and I actually found some of the things that he took into account quite clever. He even mentioned that the ""WTF is going on"" kind of ""amnesia"" feel, was one he found hard to pull off. But I think that this game (and the developer even wrote it in one of the commentary segments) is very much for a certain kind of audience. I get where people are coming from when they say they seen the trailer and expected something completely different, it wasn’t anything like I tried to imagine either. But in my own way, I kind of preferred what I found instead. I think it’s a great short (very short) game, with a lot of thought behind it.
 I’m glad I got this on sale when it was 75% off. Although I enjoyed it, I doubt I would pay full price for something this short. If it was longer... then yeh, sure.

The game does features some original ideas. The story is told achronologically, conveyed only through pictures and to put all the pieces together you will have to play through it couple times to notice things after seeing whole picture. If only story would be more absorbing and had less holes in it (it's derp, it's open ended!!!). Why would you play narrative game if not for the bloody story? In result there's not much incentive to put all the pieces together (you're not going to connect all the dots anyway, so why bother).

The graphics is OK (for a Quake 2 modded engine that is) and the music is quite nice. What's most annoying is that it's a barely a game, your actions don't matter at all. Leave guns and ammo? Nobody cares. Take different direction, game teleports you! That's just lazy level design (or lack of it). Goes without saying that you have no effect on the ending. It does say something about the game if ""credit hall"" is the biggest level in game.

In the end it's neither good game nor good story. I don't think it will make much difference in story-telling department as well. I'm glad not much developers charge for proof of concept projects.

Well, just come to add some English description on this recommendation. So maybe I should write more detailed review on this game.

And yes, a 88 points of metascore should be a good reason for me to purchase this game. But since people are actually playing the game itself rather than the rating, here is the reason why I've spend 2 hours on it (long enough for this short game).
Like many indie games, this game shares some great features like everyone else, simple mechanism, extraordinary storyline etc. Thats not important for me.
The point is the way the game telling the story is funny, its weird, its more like a interactive movie than a game (C'mon, dont reminds me of the real mess of game classification). But unlike others, this one didnt includes mass amount of metaphors(Im not blaming the metaphors), the author messing up the normal lineal storyline right to the point. This game drives you to think, for the pleasure. Thats might not be a big deal, but, if taking all the people, including the ones who just dont like (or cant understand) the metaphors into the consideration, that makes sense.

Thinking is the highest level of entertainment. (for me, maybe? )

And ya, sorry for my terrible English.

Interessante idea per raccontare una storia.
Ero stato attirato dalla citazione di PC GAMER ""Tells a better story in 13 minutes than most games do in 13 hours"". 
Sotto questo punto di vista avevano ragione, ma come gioco alla fin fine lo giochi e lo lasci lì.
Interessanti i continui flashback/flashforward ma se non amate le sperimentazioni non prendete questo gioco.

It is ridiculously short and while it might be praised for fitting a lot into a short time period, I don't think it was necessary for the game to be so condensed, there was just something missing. I recommend downloading Gravity Bone (the previous game in the series, which is free) and trying that out to see if you enjoy it (if you can get it working on the correct resolution that is, the game is an arse), then consider whether or not you'd pay for it because TFOL is the same length, essentially. Also, the game crashes no less than Gravity Bone for your money, the only upside of the duration of the game being that when it (inevitably) crashes, you don't have far to go to get back to where you were, though you will have to change all your settings again. One neat feature is that you'll never have to go to all the effort of pressing 'Esc' and exiting the game through the menu, as it will definitely crash before you do, buttonless game closing.. the future!

Ultimately I'd like to see some of these ideas put into a game of more worth and substance, whether in the Citizen Abel series or otherwise. My favourite part of the game was probably the developer commentary, which should never be the case in any form of entertainment, though nice to have it nonetheless.

First of all, I like ""Walking Simulator"" games. I have at least 50 of them in my library, according to Steam tags. I can appreciate games as art, games as experiences, and games as a chance to reflect on the player's own existence. I've enjoyed games that were slow, vague, open-ended, and so on.

But this one is just not worth money. It's about 8 minutes long from start to finish, and there is no dialogue, weapons, or interaction. It's just a series of rooms you walk through. The storefront claims to be a shooter, and the controls suggest that it is one (select item/weapon, crouch, jump, quick save/restore, and so on), but it's a trick -- there are no items, weapons, enemies, or objectives. The whole thing seems to be a wild scam to mischaracterize a game that took probably two months for one person to make, sell it for $5.00 each, and get rich. The story's not interesting either, despite what some reviewers have written.

Also, it crashed twice. Once in the main playthrough and once in the really pretentious developer commentary.

An awesome experiment in perspective, in story-through-environment, in developing characters without dialogue in the course of 13 minutes, in what's possible with video game storytelling and where it can take us.

The only problem I found with the game's open-ended interpretation: Most of the theories that make sense--the best stuff--is shattered by a note in the developer's commentary, where a forced design decision (i.e., boxes to block a doorway) doesn't seem to follow character motivations.

I hope Chung sticks with Citizen Abel stories in the future; Gravity Bone and 30 Flights are above and beyond the rest of his output, IMO, and despite its length, I found the game well worth supporting with a handful of dollar bills.

The game comes with a copy of Gravity Bone (freeware) accessible from the menu, and, as mentioned, a developer's commentary that's definitely worth checking out.

Minutes.

If you tend to run through games,  this will be a waste of money. In order to make this game work. You need to look at the enviroment, it tells a story through you and everything else. There is no dialogue, no voice acting. You do hear some kind of voice but I have no idea if they are in english or just blabber for the sense of having something to hear that kind of sounds like a language.

There is a lot of information in here, for one thing, it has two games in it. the prequel, ""Gravity bone"". Its an interesting experience, and you also get a developer commentary mode. Though this mode is kind of crashy.. but has a lot of information about the person who made this. And how he made everything in this game. And then there is another mode I havent quite touched yet. So I cant comment on that.

All in all. If you like a story without words, and like to piece everything together. By all means ,try this one. :)",1345519516,1345519516,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,False,,,
