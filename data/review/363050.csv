I've played more than I'd like to admit lately... level 99 is the bane of my existence. 

Overall, the game is great! It has that charm of everything doing something when you click it, whether it be silly gag and a slide-whistle. I think the fact that almost everything I click that it does something definitely sets it apart from current point and click games. And it is educational, if the users want to use that option with the catalog of terms. (Though, it is a bit outdated)

There are some downsides to the game, like sometimes the screens for the mini games will glitch out and stop working, or the music will either start repeating the same three notes in the exact same order for five seconds or the music will quit all together. From my current point and click horror experiences that I have now, compared to when I originally played, it leaves me on edge and waiting for a jumpscare. 

Though it's supposed to be educational, it half does well on that end, but I'm really just here for the nostalgia. And I think it holds up well on that end so I'm happy.",1699255044,1699284089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Just don't try to beat the Lost Luggage minigame. The later levels are brutally difficult and the last level, 99, is entirely RNG based. And I am NOT talking about ""give it a few attempts but you'll get it eventually"" rng. I mean this monster gives you about a 1/40 000 chance of beating it on each attempt. Clearly it's meant to be a dead end. Just reaching level 99 should be your goal, because if you DO manage to beat it somehow, you get nothing. Not even a congratulations.

Then in 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first person to step on the moon. And in 2024 SpaceX plans to land the first man on mars.

So why do we fly? 
There was a time in history where flying was a sign of witchcraft. Even during the times of Montgolfier brothers people didn't think humans could survive at high altitudes and thought we weren't meant to get off the ground. Then why did we start flying, and kept trying to get further and further away from land as possible? 
Well the answer is quite simple acutally, but it's also not really an answer.
We're just meant to.

As baby birds do when it's time for them to leave the nest; willingly or not, there comes a time in our lives where we eventually need to leave the comfort of being with our parents and venture into the world to explore and experience new things‚Äîgood or bad.
We as humans (and every living creatures for that matter) are made to explore, it is part of everyone's life, it is a sign of progression in life.

So in this context, what is an airport?
Well if you ask me airport is the midpoint of a person's life; it's a rest stop right before someone journeys into the unknown and the unfamiliar. And what do people do at the airport? We check our luggage, we get some food, we use the restroom, and we check the flight time. Because when it's time for you to fly somewhere, you should have everything in check. 
So when it's time for you to venture into the world and explore some place new, you need to be ready, and to help you do that you need to explore where you're at right now. 
The airport. 

Many of us will be at that stage in life of finding a new home, a career or a partner. To those people I urge you to play this game.
Let's Explore the Airport (Junior Field Trips) acts as a guide, for you to use when you're uncertain on what an airport consists of. This game will help you grasp the ins and outs of an airport and (which in some way) life itself.

TLDR: Dated dosbox exploration clicker. Dubious educational value. Features concorde which is out of commission, some minigames not thematic (identifying carrots and chairs)

So this is a small low resolution game in which you click betwen a few screens, click on things and small animations happen. You can click an identify button so the game will tell you what is being displayed. Not too sure that this is really an engaging title or that it really can hold solid competition to tablet apps aimed at this age bracket with a much more kid friendly interface (tap and touch). 

The where is waldo minigame type thing was grating due to the pixelation, the guess the item thing was not thematic to aiprorts, the thesauraus was just a collection of what items are, which is again, not terribly exciting. 

Was not too keen on the anthropomorphic fly as a guide either, I guess because it flies around it fit? I dont know.

Conclusion: Best archive this and only dig for it if you ever have a child that desperately needs *something* to fight off boredom. Then again, life is full of possibilities, you could actually go on field trips, engage with children, read them books or play with them but what do I know. Maybe this is not as bad as it looks. Just do not think it is really worth keeping in permanent library where it clutters and distracts from actually entertaining games that you would have on collection. I have no nostalgia appeal for this title either so that is not a factor.

Most of my playtime was spent in this mini-game, so that is what I will focus on.

AVOID THIS GAME. I was with two other adults, and we all worked together to solve the puzzles in Lost Luggage. Initially, we were having fun joking around about a game that one of us had fond memories of. The game starts out wtih very little challenge. This is a facade to lower your defenses for the brutality you will encounter later.

Lost Luggage is a tile-based action/puzzle game. Up to four suitcases have to be redirected to their color-coded luggage carrier to complete each level. There are conveyor belts, switches, etc., which are manipulated by the player to change where a suitcase goes. The player has to direct the suitcases of each color to the carrier that matches it.

There are 99 levels. The difficulty changes wildly. Throughout the entire experience, even as high as level 70 or 80, there will be simple levels that can be completed in two attempts. These break up the challenge from some other difficult levels. The difficulty rarely comes from the puzzles itself. Almost all of the difficulty comes from the ""action"" part of the gameplay. Levels put four suitcases very close to each other, so the player has to rapidly enable and disable switches to split up the suitcases and send them where they need to go. The animations in general are clunky and unresponsive. In particular, the pusher device that moves luggage one tile off its path has an odd recovery/cooldown animation that makes it hard to hit the precise timing required in later levels.

Near-constant player interaction is required to complete many of the later levels. We called this ""juggling"" - manually making a switch or conveyor belt activate, to keep a suitcase going in a loop while trying to move another suitcase where it needed to go. The player needs to do this because otherwise, a suitcase can fall of the edge or fall in the wrong-colored suitcase bin, both of which fail the level and cause a level restart. With no safe areas for some suitcases, no spot you can just put them and temporarily ignore them, this is required.

It took three fully-grown adults, one of whom had prior experience with the game, around 2 hours and 20 minutes to finish all 99 levels. We were working in full co-operation. Each of us noticed strategies the others didn't. I would expect a full playthrough to take longer if you're playing by yourself. 20 minutes longer if we're being generous, at least one hour longer if we're being realistic. It started as a fun nostalgia trip. It became a maniacal suicide pact. We had to keep going. The levels were bad. We had to keep going. The action was hard. We had to keep going. The suitcases got merged on top of each other. We had to keep going.

I cannot imagine any child aged 3-8 being able to handle this garbage. We nearly gave up. The cruelest part of this whole game is the MASSIVE difficulty / unfairness spike that comes on the very last level, number 99.

Level 99. I curse it. I curse whoever created it. I curse whoever tested it and thought it was a good idea. After beating it, we tried looking up people who worked on this game, so we could harass them on Twitter, something which is generally not proposed or advocated by civilized people. That's how mad we were about Level 99. I really want to talk to the people who worked on this game. Did anyone actually play this level? How did they think it was a good idea? And what monster created it? Let me tell you about level 99.

Level 99 is one of the worst levels of any video game ever made. It takes one of the worst things about this game, and bases its entire solution on this. It is not a culmination of the game mechanics introduced in levels 1-98; rather, it is a short-circuiting around most of Lost Luggage's core values, like puzzle-solving and clever timing. Here is the structure of level 99. There are four suitcases colored red, yellow, blue, and green. This is typical, especially in the later levels. They each have matching luggage bins they need to go into. If, for example, a red suitcase falls into a blue bin, you fail the level and have to try again. The level starts with two suitcases in the middle of the screen on a path of certain destruction (falling off the level, which makes you fail). The first step to beating this level is switching the direction of the conveyor belt they hit right before they fall off. The next step is stopping four more similar fail states: two each on two luggage chutes (think ""Portal""; they go in one chute and out another. But which chute they end up at, and the direction they exit, is random). You have to switch those four conveyor belts from pushing exiting luggage off the level, and instead push them back into the chute for another trip on the Random Express.

Then, I'm pretty sure there are more conveyor belts to change the direction of. If you don't, you open yourself up to more possible failures. Sorry for not being exact here, but the point is, it takes manual work to play level 99 perfectly. Each time you fail, you have to redo that manual work. At least six mouse clicks; probably more.

The rotten core of Level 99 is that even when you play perfectly, you barely have a chance. Mathematically, there's almost no hope. I got out paper and a pencil and tried to figure out the odds while my friend operated the mouse, a digital Sisyphus. Except instead of rolling a stone he was rolling a trackball. By my count, here's how it works. There are 6 baggage chutes. 4 of them can lead to the color-coded suitcase carrier. Suitcases exiting a chute cannot directly enter a carrier. Cases never come out of the chute they just entered. That means the number of outcomes for a case entering a chute depends on which of the six chutes it enters. This combines with the other attributes I mentioned to make calculating the probability of a case travelling any one path rather difficult. I also have not measured whether the game takes a stratified sample of chutes first, then the exits from the chutes, or just takes a simple random sample of possible exits. The sampling algorithm should not change the chance of winning, but it would have a dramatic effect on how long each attempt takes. The only outcomes of a chute that matter are the ones that put your suitcase in a carrier. The other outcomes all involve your suitcase going back in a chute, so it's just another attempt at getting a carrier. There are four carriers, you don't win without matching carriers to the right suitcase, all of them have to be matched, and a suitcase already being in a carrier doesn't stop another suitcase coming through the chute and landing in it, failing the level.

We can simplify this probability problem. When you put a case in a chute, there's a (1/4) chance of it ending up in the proper carrier. (3/4) of the outcomes that matter involve the case landing in the wrong-colored carrier, which causes a level fail. The other outcomes just make the player re-do these odds. Outcomes are independent. Each suitcase has a (1/4) chance of success. The chance of multiple independent events happening together is calculated by multiplying the individual chances. In our case, that is: (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = (1/4)^4 = 1/256 = 0.00390625 ‚âà .004.

But if you're smart, you can help your odds immensely. Send all the suitcases except the yellow one into the chute closest to the yellow carrier. Send the yellow suitcase into the chute closest to the red carrier. As I said earlier, cases never exit the same chute they enter. So putting the cases into chutes corresponding to outcomes you DON'T want improves the chance of success. Then it becomes (1 / [4-1] )^4 = (1/3)^4 = 1/81 = 0.01234568 ‚âà .012. That's four times more likely, and puts your chances above 1 percent.

Well, I'm not a kid anymore and I must say that while I'm open to every new knowledge, planes and airport aren't really my field of interest.

However, Let's Explore the Airport (Junior Fiel Trips) did amaze me for its richness. Let me explain.

The aim of the software is to educate young children to everything related to an airport. You're going to find in there planes (well, outdated as the game was released in 1995), the luggage circuits, cockpit, hangars, shops, etc.. You can navigate from a location to another, though I must say that going back is sometimes very hard, as seen at the security gate for example. But to learn, you have to be aware of every area of interest, thanks to the button What is this?. With that, you'll see names with an interrogation mark. Just hovering will trigger the pronounciation of the object. And if you click on it, you'll enter the index (which is also existing on its own with the button Index).

More precisely, clicking on an object will send you in the definition page of the index. There, some highlighted words can be read aloud and lead to their own definition. The Read Aloud button will read the entire definition for kids that can't read or that are learning English.

However, it wouldn't be fun if you didn't have minigames. They're five: a trivia quizz (self-explanatory), What is this (associating a picture to a word), Lost Luggage (a puzzle game where you have to lead some luggage in the cart of the same color by changing the arrows on the conveyor belt), Find it (where a small picture is shown and you have to find in the right scene) and a coloring book (with a brush to color and a eye dropper to mix colors to obtain complex ones like green, orange, purple, etc..). Score are also kept as you can create several profiles (with the choice of the colors for each letter of the name of the player). Each game, except the coloring book, has three levels of difficulties.

As you can see, Let's Explore is really thought as an educational game. Contrary to Big Thinkers, you're not drown into overcharged graphics, even if these are clearly outdated. But as it's representative of its time, you have some areas that can be clicked on and allow a little animation to play. Kids can have fun with that. The soundtrack is nice too.

My only little problem is that everything is in English and it might be quite hard for kids that aren't native speakers, it might also be a problem for an adult, even if he's fluent in English as there are some technical texts in there. However, if it's for learning English, it can be a good way. Well maybe not with the airport, but with the two other games in the same series (farm and jungle), it could be really fun for children.

Anyway, don't worry, Let's Explore the Airport is excellent for learning how an airport work, though, you should be aware that given the age, security back then wasn't as tight as today. But aside that, I find the software interesting for non-English speakers in a course for learning the language.",1473430553,1473430553,True,14,2,0.670400083065032959,0,True,False,False,False,,,

It should be noted that back then no one ever believed an airport can be a dangerous place to visit. But after the various terror attacks in the 2000's, people rethink that belief.

It does give out info and definitions to everything found at an airport, but it also proves to be too dated for teaching purposes unless the teacher wants to go through the trouble of explaining the students the difference between a modern and 90's airport, After the release of the three Junior Field Trip games, no more installments were made.
