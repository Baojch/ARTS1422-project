[i] INT. HUNDRED ACRE WOOD - DAY

The scene opens in the serene Hundred Acre Wood. Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Rabbit, and Eeyore are gathered around a picnic table. Pooh has a game controller in his paw.

WINNIE THE POOH:
Oh, bother. What's this contraption, and why does it have so many buttons?

PIGLET:
Um, I-I think it's called a game controller, Pooh. We're going to play Retro City Rampage DX today.

Tigger bounces excitedly.

TIGGER:
Retro City what-now? Sounds like my kind of bounce!

Eeyore, ever the pessimist, sighs.

EEYORE:
Another game, another opportunity to be disappointed. Let's get on with it.

Pooh presses the start button, and the game begins.

WINNIE THE POOH:
Oh my, this looks rather pixelated, doesn't it? Reminds me of the time I got stuck in a honey jar.

RABBIT:
Pixelated or not, let's focus on the game. What are we supposed to do here?

They navigate through the chaotic retro city, causing mayhem and dodging pixelated police.

PIGLET:
Oh dear! Is it supposed to be this... explosive?

WINNIE THE POOH:
Seems a bit more exciting than my usual honey adventures. I wonder if there's a honey level.

They encounter a boss battle, and Pooh struggles with the controls.

WINNIE THE POOH:
Oh dear, how do I jump? And why is that pixelated person chasing us?

TIGGER:
Just bounce, Pooh! Bounce like you've never bounced before!

Eeyore deadpans.

EEYORE:
I'm not sure bouncing is the solution to every problem, but go ahead.

They defeat the boss, and the victory screen appears.

WINNIE THE POOH:
Well, that was an adventure! Quite different from our usual strolls in the wood.

RABBIT:
I must admit, it was rather exhilarating. I feel like I've aged a hundred years.

TIGGER:
Who needs honey when you can have explosions, am I right?

Eeyore mumbles.

EEYORE:
I suppose it was less disappointing than I expected.

They all share a laugh, and Pooh looks at the game controller.

WINNIE THE POOH:
Perhaps we should stick to honey-related adventures. This game is a bit too energetic for my liking.

They all nod in agreement.

PIGLET:
But it was fun, wasn't it?

TIGGER:
Totally tubular fun! Let's do it again sometime!

As they continue discussing their gaming adventure, the Hundred Acre Wood is filled with laughter and the occasional bounce from Tigger. [/i]

Heirs of a pixel war

I'm gaming with something that just isn't fair

Who and what's to retro-blame

If you enjoy pixelated action, like open-world gameplay, and don't mind a heavy-dosage of vintage gaming and popular-culture references, you just might enjoy Retro City Rampage!

[b]Too Long, But Gonna Read Anyways version:[/b]
This game has been in my library for years now, and on my radar even longer. I gotta hand it to the developer, even after all this time, it's still a sweet, crunchy pixelated dose of action-packed fun from yesteryear. The cars, the styles, the references, the arcade-style pick-up-and-play challenges, the mini-games, or even the opportunity to just go on a literal Retro City Rampage...

I love it, and definitely have recommended it to many of my friends who share the craving of retro-styled, if not some cheesier-than-pump-cheese-nachos gaming and pop culture references. I'd recommend it to other players as well, as long as they don't take the reference parts too seriously and just enjoy it for the 8-bit-terrific love-letter to the 80's and 90's that it is.

It also has a decent story to tell, so even if it's not something you come back to play frequently, the tale may be fun enough to remember bits and pieces from. Also, Pro-Tip: there's no actual ""lives system"" in this game, so completing the story at your own pace seems to be welcomed.

As an aside: I remember reading about Brian Provinciano's earlier builds of Retro City Rampage nearly a decade and a half ago on a GTA-related fansite. May even have been Gouranga, perhaps. Back then it was nicknamed things like ""Grand Theftendo"" and such. Word has it he had been working on it for other platforms before that, but it was an even longer time ago.

Understandably, BriPro decided to make his own thing out of his 8-bit GTA concept, and I couldn't be happier with the result, even all these years later. He's done so much to optimize and perfect his creations, and it often inspires me to do the same with my works as a content creator for games and consoles, as well.

Speaking of creations, I've made a few mod packs for Retro City Rampage that you can find in a guide right here on Steam! You could say I've poured a little bit of my heart and soul into working on this game, just as much as I enjoy playing it, too!

Lastly, I'll admit I might be one of THE major fans of this game, even in the here and now. I've bought lots of really cool merch based on this game, have the soundtrack from the pre-order mix-tape and CD albums, and have even e-mailed to and from the developer a few times over all these years. He's alright, and I look forward to future projects by him and VBlank Entertainment in general.

The game also works great on a steam deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDCt7XkPAfc

You play as the veteran criminal who accidentally ends up in the eighties with a time machine.
The time machine has been destroyed beyond repair and so you are trapped in the city of Theftropolis. The 8-bit world can be explored at your leisure from a top-down perspective, on foot or in stolen cars, just like in the first, second or London GTA. Soon after that you meet an absent-minded doctor with a time-traveling car, No it's not Rick, who can take you back to your own time, provided that after searching and finding the required parts anyway.

There is a lot to do in the 8-bit world of Theftropolis and you can also have a great time if you have had enough of the missions.
Challenges are scattered throughout the city, where you have to destroy as many cars as possible, for example. You can also earn extra money with a side job or pick up customers in your taxi.
You can then spend that money in the many shops, where you can buy a new haircut, weapons or a skateboard. And of course it's always fun to just plow over some innocent passersby and get the police after you.",1693147315,1693147315,True,18,0,0.731424629688262939,0,True,False,False,True,,,

Gameplay can be hit or miss (the physics engine, focused on being bouncy, can put you into a lot of instant death situations that can be annoying. The shooting mechanics are weird but easy once you get used to them. The jump and stomp were a good addition to the game's combat. The driving could use some work but is generally good enough to get you around and doesn't get 'in the way' of the experience), but I'd say there's more good than bad personally. The customization options are fun, some of the weapons are pretty good ideas (I especially enjoyed the Ghostbusters Proton Pack parody), and there is a decent amount of personality to even the pedestrians that spawn in. Some of the missions are generally better than others, as some tend to get into stage-specific gimmicks. This is likely a riff on the NES titles it borrows from, but I think it inherits a lot of the flaws of those games when it tries to replicate said gimmicks. Likely intentional, but still worth mentioning. 

The writing is okay sometimes as far as parodies go, but if you don't like reference humor I would steer clear as that's pretty much all the game has as jokes which make up the majority of the game's writing. Personally, some of the reference humor landed for me but others were genuinely so bad I wanted to turn the game off. Some of these references are also dated to exactly when the game came out (Epic Meal Time, Phil Fish, Jim Sterling, Destructoid, etc.) and they're by far some of the worst the game has to offer because it takes me right out. The references to other indies (Super Meat Boy, Bit.Trip, Minecraft) are all much less grating if only because those were also games trying to revive genres that were smaller in scope. 

Overall, I'd give it a soft recommendation. Pick it up on sale if you want a quick, small scale open world crime game, or are really into retro video game reference/meta humor. Otherwise, you'd be fine missing out on it.",1689672572,1689673206,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,True,,,

THE CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE

The game does contain minor dirty language- ""Holy Crap"" which I encountered.

Some people may also argue that ""jeez"" is blasphemy. However, ""Jeez"" or ""Geez"" (How do you spell it?) is not God's name, it is a replacement expletive for blasphemy, so I don't count it. Doc Choc uses ""Gosh"" and again I don't think that's blasphemy.

This game does have you play as a bad guy- a criminal. The game mainly revolves around wreaking havoc in the city by blowing stuff up, driving around in cars, etcetera, However it'd be a far stretch to argue that this game glorifies evil. While yes, it is a grand theft auto clone, everything about it is cartoony and intentionally child-friendly. Policemen are not portrayed as evil or bad in the game. Evil is not portrayed as good, nor good as evil. It doesn't really seem to be selling any undermining ideology.

There's no blasphemy or bad language. The story is comedic.

Retro City Rampage has a story which is outwardly similar to that of GTA games- except it's retro media references and inside jokes. This game is not gonna convince anyone that being a criminal is honorable or good in some way.

The graphics are pixelated but have a lot of charm. They’re close to 8-bit but have some improvements. The soundtrack is neat, and you can even change radio stations in vehicles.
The game also has a decent amount of content. The story is cool but a bit short, as you can beat it in around 4-5 hours. It has short missions grouped by chapters, but they have a lot of variety. Sometimes it even changes genres, for example, to a 2D platformer.
The other major content is challenges, similar to rampages in GTA. They also have leaderboards, although getting really high scores is dependent on luck, specifically on NPC and vehicle spawns. Still, it’s not hard in general to get gold in all of them.
Other than that, there are miscellaneous tasks you can do, like cab driving and arcade mini-games. And of course, just causing mayhem, which is incredibly fun, especially if you buy power-ups, like super speed or straight up invincibility.
Still, I think the game could have a bit more content, like races. During its lifetime, it got updated to a DX and a DX+ version, but the additions were mostly quality-of-life features (which are still appreciated, don’t get me wrong).

What a journey this game went on, and THANKFULLY this was worth the wait. Development time this almost felt like an indie take on Duke Nukem Forever's wait time. But as already mentioned, this is/was well worth the wait. 

Retro City Rampage actually started as a homebrew demake  of GTA 3. For those unaware, a demake is essentially re-making a game for lesser hardware and is 99% of the time fan projects based on other games. Prime examples include a (no joke) Chinese bootleg of Final Fantasy 7 for the NES that was ACTUALLY expanded upon into the full game by fans. Or another example can be a the NES version of Left 4 Dead or Halo 2600 for the Atari 2600

Bear in mind the whole Duke Forever joke has relevance here because this game had been legitimately in development since 2002


But I digress. 

As time went on, Brian Provinciano (the crazy and creative bastard behind this fun as hell title) started added less and less copied GTA content and eventually made the game so ridiculous and over the top that the game's title was eventually changed to Grand Theftendo and then further changed into Retro City Rampage.

What we have here is a clusterfuck of references and parodies all thrown into unique missions (called stages in the game) along with game elements from items and abilities (called powerups) being everything from totally not a 1960's Bat-arang to the ""speed kills shoes"" which would make a certain hedgehog blush and also maybe want a lawyer, to a job of arming bombs for a certain samurai to take care of some half shell infestation annoyances.



Now all of this is fine and dandy and will make any nerd or nerdette (especially those close to or born in the 80s and 90s) laugh and smile and it adds icing to this chaotic and absurd cake. But that wouldn't matter if the gameplay sucked right?

Well THANKFULLY, the toppings on this pixelated sundae so to speak are just the tip of the iceberg and are wrapped around a top down 8 bit open world chaotic, bright, colorful and vibrant sandbox akin to Grand Theft Auto, precisely GTA 1, GTA 2 and GTA London. Which, for those unaware, were top down birds eye view twin stick games before they took on there 3rd Person brutal roots

Wrap this around a ridiculous story- I won't give a FULL story exposure and will avoid spoilers. But I'll give a basic synopsis

You play as the aptly and tongue-in cheekly named henchman for hire named Player. After doing a bank heist for a totally crazy and over the top circus jester crime boss named the Jester, you steal a time traveling phone booth porta potty hybrid and end up in the year 20XX in the city of Theftropolis. Now with a literal and figruative big vibrant future ahead of you in this ripe for the plucking metropolis. You have to engage into multiple satire filled and slapstick/parody style tasks all while repairing the time machine with Doc Bro-I mean Doc Choc.

Everything from fighting a ""Bionicop"" and rescuing prisoners with ""Major Lee Solid"" top down MGS style to taking a cartridge cleaning kit from the clutches of the evil Dr Von Buttnick in a totally not Smash T.V. mission to delivering XXX magazines in the style of paperboy, The Player does anything and anything to make his notoriety, street cred, and wallet as big as possible in this over the top acid trip of 80s and 90s mockery and nostalgia all in the name of crazy good fun.

What makes this work is that the game implements these references and jokes in ways that are more than just ""ha ha do you remember this?!"" (even though it does that SOMETIMES with dialogue and visual gags, which thankfully isn't overdone) and instead implements them into the GAMEPLAY. Making things flow smoothly and feeling a lot less monotonous than one would think


Add to this a VERY vibrant and catchy soundtrack, some cool cameos from other indie games, and a gameplay that's quite chaotic and over the top just like it's story, and this is what makes RCR a wild and memorable romp.

The best way to put it? What do this, the ACTUAL (big letters=emphasis) Rampage game and Zombies Ate My Neighbors all have in common? 

All of them are vibrant and colorful fast paced games with a big emphasis on comedy, parody, and oozing personality and throwing in slapstick/somewhat crass and tongue in cheek humor while also paying homage to the material that inspired it, but not enough to the point where legal teams would get excited or to where the games feel like shameless rip offs. Instead, all these games feel like big giant homages that still have enough to stand up on their own two legs

And at the end of the day, Retro City Rampage does exactly this for the GTA 1 and 2 formula and any and (almost) everything old school and 80s/90s

Get this game if you wanna carjack the 80s into a wild ride!

En principio es un GTA pixelado retro mezclado con Smash TV... pero de repente lo mismo viajas en el tiempo con un DeLorean, que trabajas haciendo misiones para los Cazafantasmas, le mangas el coche a una parodia de Batman, vas al instituto de Salvados por la Campana, te metes en una tubería de Super Mario llegando a una fase de plataformas en 2D, y tropecientas cosas loquísimas más que reconocerá cualquiera que haya crecido en los años 80 y 90.

Además de la historia principal y las quests secundarias también hay un montón de secretos, tiendas, apariencias, vehículos que robar (y tunear) armas, echarte unas partidas en el salón recreativo, cambiar de peinado o incluso tatuarte.
La música es MUY buena, pega totalmente con el estilo gráfico del juego y el ritmo frenético que tiene. Mola.

Основной объект для подражания узнаётся уже по скриншотам - это, конечно, первые части GTA. Но находится место и для других знаковых вещей: как явных (мы успеваем, например, подраться с черепашками ниндзя, или помочь Марио в борьбе со злыми обитателями канализации), так и неявных (прохождение стелс-уровня, прячась в коробке, или биомеханическая рука в качестве оружия). А иногда высмеиваются и сами игры как таковые (герой по имени Player One называет себя в резюме мастером по езде из точки А в точку Б, ругается на очередной подводный уровень, получает от духовного учителя чит-код на режим Бога и т.д.) Вся эта несерьёзность приправлена и сюжетом соответствующим, повествующим о попадании героя в прошлое (починка машины времени требует использования, скажем, жвачки в качестве нужной запчасти). Разумеется, на одной сатире далеко не уедешь, но не подкачали и сами задания - город хоть и сильно уступает своему прототипу из GTA (хотя есть и худо-бедно следящие за порядком копы, и свой аналог ""жажды смерти""), но миссии мы получаем и выполняем интересные, разнообразные и непростые, так что скучать не приходится. А когда и они приедаются - игра уже успевает закончиться, не заставляя терпеть устаревший геймплей до посинения.
Игра не для всех. Если новость о том, что в GTA когда-то была двумерная графика, у вас вызывает недоумение, лучше не трогайте, не поймёте ничего. Ну а если при виде скриншотов вы уже успели пустить ностальгическую слезу, то покупайте, вам понравится.

This game's existence is to reference as much from the 80's and 90's as possible.

	Story missions are completely disconnected from one another, serving as vehicles to reference either a game or movie. Mainline Missions side-track at random, or are just random and have barely anything to do with the main story. Events unfold haphazardly, or for no reason other than to reference something. The first 10 minutes of the first mission moves at a frantic pace, fitting in as many random pop-culture references as possible.

	Even the main time-travel plotline is pointless, since the city (including parts you destroyed pre-time travel) remains exactly the same. Even your crime boss--from the past--references the heist you did (in the future) as if you aren't in the past. It's just a vehicle for a Bill and Ted and Back to the Future reference. Why you even time-travelled in the first place is a complete mystery.

	The city is one giant reference. Billboards and store-fronts are callbacks to movies or games. There's the ""Did not Finish?"" GED advert with a character and font that looks like Duke Nukem (referencing DNFs long development cycle). 'Toadstool Tattoos'. There's even references to random video game websites (Destructoid), with entire missions surrounding this.

	I understand that this isn't supposed to be a serious game with a stringent narrative structure, but the game feels haphazard and barely stitched together. It's like an amalgamation of stuff, rather than a concise package. Because of the barrage of references, some of the parodies have no more depth than ""Solid Snake likes boxes"". 

If the game relaxed a little, it could create a coherent story (tying its references together) and give some of the jokes more room to breathe. Or at least implement them better than just shoe-horning them into missions half-way through as a cutaway gag. Then again, the blistering pace (and random insertion) is a part of the joke itself, so what do I know. 

	To its credit, some of the comedy did get a chuckle out of me. And the game at least understands how frantic it is, matching its tone with just as quick a pace everywhere else (animations, movement). I wasn't laughing all the way, but I didn't hate it either. Even if the 'all ur base' jokes are [i]extremely[/i] old.

	The good thing is that if you strip away all of this the game itself is solid. Ironically, referencing works to the game's benefit. RCR isn't a long game, with a main mission structure consisting of around 20 missions. Each can be finished in 10 minutes or less (usually). Because RCR has more references than a propsective employee's resume, each mission feels unique. 

	The Batman mission feels nothing like the Metal Gear mission or the SmashTV mission, for obvious reasons. Not only are they thematically different, but the game also works at giving you different toys or powerups to play with. Some missions are just straight copies of old games (Paper Boy mission). Even if the mission isn't entirely a reference, the developer never has you doing the same thing in exactly the same way. For all the criticism you can leverage against the humor, the developer definitely knew to keep things varied. Like darts (and the references), it's throwing a bunch of stuff at the wall.

	Which is good, because there's not a lot of side-content here. RCR has the rampages from GTAIII and VC (can't remember if SA had them), which task you with creating havoc within a time limit using different weapons. Otherwise, there are a few (emphasis on FEW) side-missions, but not much else. There are those 2 mediocre arcade games, I guess. Oh, and gambling. For all the talk of a 2D GTA, there's not a lot of side-content here. Or building interiors, for that matter.

	RCR took over a decade to complete, from 2002 to its release in 2012. Originally beginning as a GTA3 demake for the NES, the inclusion of pop-culture allusions grew so large that it eventually became its own thing. The good thing is that even if you don't care for the (I'm tired of using this da*n word already) references the game is still a fun 2D GTA that can hold its own. It has just enough to do to be enjoyable outside of the main mission structure, and is long enough to provide a modicum of entertainment without overstaying its welcome. Even if you hate its sense of humor, the campaign is fun and varied enough to make up for it.",1648895750,1648897192,True,2,1,0.445910274982452393,0,False,False,False,False,,,

Lots of missions to complete, little side challenges, and a bit of a story mode. Not a lot else to it, good fun casual hop into it GAME. I would recommend it on a sale though, imo $15 is a bit much. $5 would be a good price-tag. Definitely has the arcade OG feeling to it, and I love it. I'd say a realistic 30 to 40 hrs you can get out of this if you roamed around and did everything and want to get all achievements.

You can count on a lot of references to be found here from running into the Turtle Van from TMNT to finding a shop that mocks Bimmy and Jimmy, to BTTF and many more. You can really tell the developers went out of their way to cram as much nostalgia as possible in a package. But unless you don't really get the gist of it, a lot of it could go over your head so the nostalgia may have a limited appeal depending on which representative generation you're from.

I remembered having a blast with this game for the first handful of hours and it's got quite a lot of charm. I'm only 45% of the game done with 44 missions out of 60 completed. I will warn you that things will start easy, just to get you into the swing of the game, however the missions later become quite a grind to deal with. The kind of missions that punishes you for every minor error pulled, no mistakes allowed.

A couple missions come to mind like doing the beer tap barrel throw mission, where you're required to throw barrels at bar tables. You have a small amount of time to complete the mission and it's incredibly easy to mess up with how you could throw a barrel and it doesn't count so you scatter to make up for it until you die or fail. Then there's the other one where you're the grim reaper for a temporary period, so you go around and kill civilians in a set time. You're to follow the colored dots and you're allowed to kill anyone in the proximity of the area. However, this can get finicky as I've just experienced trying to kill some civilians, only for it to not count because I wasn't *precisely* where the dot was on the map. There's just a bit of inconsistency there.

That is just a bit of fair warning of what you could get yourself into within this game. Though I'm pretty sure if choking up is not your problem, you'll do fine. I do recommend playing this game through controller, because it's comfortable, responsive and just easier to do everything with.

Some reviewers and people claim that this game 'doesn't know what it wants to do' because of it's gameplay. I have to say - it's GTA related. In GTA, you're also set on numerous side missions that may or may not make sense in the overall story. This game isn't any different and borrows from GTA like this. Yes, everything is going to be everywhere, but I'd chalk that up to you probably not getting the references. That's okay and I know the references can appear overstuffed, but what did you expect out of a game that's designed to be retro-related?

I really do. It's definitely a lot like playing Grand Theft Auto for the NES, riddled with all sorts of pop culture references from the 1980s, and is a rad game overall. The retroness of it is timeless. I've played it on 3DS, on PC, even played it on a friend's Wii console at one time.

So why I am I giving RCRDX+ a thumbs down?

Because the developer/publisher of this game has committed a bait-and-switch method by releasing their next game, Shakedown: Hawaii, onto Epic Games, practically leaving Steam users like myself in the dark. It is what I'd call an ""Anti-Steam Exclusive Title,"" where a game would be released on every current-day game console (or in this company's case, past-generation consoles too) as well as multiple PC game client services that support them, except Steam, for some bizarrely unknown reason. While it is officially released on PC, it is still an Epic Games Store Exclusive as of this writing and update. It's been well over a year plus now at this point. Unless you're willing to buy a console to play Shakedown Hawaii onto, or (god forbid) sell your soul to EGS, don't expect Shakedown Hawaii to be released onto Steam anytime soon.

In short: Retro City Rampage DX+ is a really great game, but I strongly recommend boycotting Vblank for their bait-and-switch methods. Don't buy this game; don't support Vblank.

Update, Oct. 29th: Shakedown: Hawaii is now on Steam, released on Oct. 20th. However, as Vblank had pulled this greasy move where it became an Anti-Steam Exclusive Title up until that point, my recommendation against supporting Vblank's future endeavours remains very much the same.",1593923439,1603999475,False,9,2,0.334156125783920288,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I've seen the trailers and all the announcements and was a bit thrilled about it. The price was also very affordable, as I happened to get it during a sale.

Ok, so the first time I've played it, I didn't really enjoy that much (or I simply found some other title that happened to be more exciting during the sale). Anyway, I believe that it was the gameplay that set me back, but we'll get to that in just a moment.

So, what's the story of the game? You take the role of a criminal who works for a parody of the joker, and for whatever reason, you're sent back to the past. Your mission is to assemble all the parts of a time machine in order to be able to return to your time and place.

As for the background itself, it's basically a whole combination of different parodies of games from the 80's and 90's, which the player can get to catch the references every now and then. Back to the gameplay, I advise to use a gamepad, because I don't think that playing on the keyboard is all that great. While the main concept seems to be based on the classic GTA game, through the combination of different moves and power-ups, it kinda gives a refreshing look to the genre (kinda like a Saints Row 8-Bits version).

The graphics are ok, the soundtrack is decent and the sound effects can be annoying sometimes (especially when there're lots of cops on your tail). There're also some trading cards and achievements to get, but some of these are kinda hard to unlock, so it's definitely not one of those titles that I wanted to get them all.

Overall,  I couldn't let to think that if this game would be released back in the golden years of NES, it'd be either the game of the year, or simply banned before getting into the stores. If you have some nostalgia for the 8-bit era and you're looking for some crazy adventure that can keep you busy for a few hours, go for it; I believe that you won't regret it.",1589286834,1589286834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

This is a full-on world of its own, all these jokes and references aren't just there just to be there... they make this world that runs off video game logic. It's hard to describe without actually sitting down and playing it.

You don't just have ""LOL DOC LOUIS STEAL BIKE!"", you have a Doc Louis running a boxing coalition with a bike stealing business on the side that funnels his porn delivery. You don't just have some guy going ""I Feel Asleep"", you have a military base that you can visit at any time running off of Metal Gear logic.

It took all these memes and references, and built a coherent world that ties together out of it and made it run on video game logic. It's GTA on the surface, but they use coins and sections of the world require platforming because it's a video game world.

I feel like I'm not explaining it properly, but, trust me, you want this game, and if you play it for five minutes, you'll see what I mean. It's crazy and an underrated gem that simply doesn't get enough praise.

The game announces immediately ""Common sense warning, This game is a parody"", so it is clear that the game does not take itself seriously, and that has been taken into account. I will still give my two cents about what I think of this game as a piece of entertainment.

Retro City Rampage DX is a small ""open world"" top down action game similar in style to the original Grand Theft Auto. Gameplay consists mostly of causing general chaos and completing simple rapid fire quests one after another. As expected from a ""parody"", more or less all gameplay mechanics are heavily inspired or mirrored from various popular games. Retro City Rampage does not however execute any of these mechanics as well as its predecessors, which leaves the player with a somewhat bland experience (in my personal opinion).

From start to finish the game is full of references to movies, tv shows, games etc. Every once in a while a joke is cleverly set up, but for the most part the quips and references are simply excessive, which in turn leads to saturation. 

I do have to give credit to the developer/s for coming up with a decent amount of fun quests that heavily tie into the above-mentioned references. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy flying a jetpack at supersonic speed while Goomba stomping civilians. I did not encounter any bugs/glitches either which is commendable.

If you are really into popular movies and games from the 80-90s, you might get a kick out of this game. 
Personally I recommend just playing the original games this game is referencing to (such as GTA, Hotline Miami), as they are a much more complete and well thought out experience.

For all it's throwback humor and tried and true ""Nintendo Hard"" gameplay I have to wonder if the developers really knew what those things meant in the grand scheme of the game.
All this ""tude"" does not a stellar game make.

The game opens with ""The Player"", a thug for hire, chillin in the grand city of Theftopolis. He's soon after hired by The Jester (translation: the Joker but we don't want DC to slam us up the butt with a CND) to join his crime organization. Time zips three years ahead, the Player is caught in the crossfire of a Heist gone wrong. After dodging the cops, he finds a Time Traveling Telephone booth (real subtle) and is flung some years into the future, into the year 20XX.
The Player understandably wants to get back and enlists the help of Dr. Emmett Brown (in this: Doc Choc for .. reasons?) to do just that and then the game starts fully. 

First off your gonna quickly notice that the gameplay is very much inspired by Grand Theft Auto, but in a top-down 8-bit style. Playing this with a keyboard and mouse is absolute suffering, even with a controller your accuracy is gonna be shot and driving vehicles at any high speeds is suicide. 
Second thing is is that this game wears it's inspirations on it's sleeves but it's all haphazard and just amount to 'REMEMBER THE THING? I REMEMBER THE THING GOD WHAT GLORIOUS TIMES THOSE WERE' without really doing anything with that. It pays tribute to 80s games and movies and culture at large, you can toss a dart and see a throwback to Batman, or Back to the Future or games like Mario or Zelda or Contra. It's just there to BE there and not do anything else. 

Quickly the game's difficulty goes right out the window with any respect towards your time or patience. Levels and missions will randomly change style on a whim to inspire some kind of attempt to keep the game from getting stale but random horrid stealth missions or missions requiring intense levels of accuracy are just tests in total frustration. Nothing in this was polished or had a reason to be there other than to just 'be'. Nintendo Hard is hard and memorable when it's fun. Ninja Gaiden kicking my ass as a kid was memorable cause I was able to eventually beat it, but doing horribly controlling races and missions evoking PaperBoy were enough to make me push this game right back onto the shelf like an NES game I didn't research fully. Quickly the game becomes repetitive and frustrating instead of whacky and fun. Reminding me of crapsack NES games ins't a way to inspire me to continue when I get nabbed by a rocket launcher squad like the Snipers in Dick Tracy sorry to say. This could've easily been alleviated by more polish and a WAY more forgiving Checkpoint system. 

Which sucks, cause the game looks fucking stellar in terms of being an 8-bit title and the music kicks some serious ass. The intro theme in particular basically sounding like 8-bit Megadeth. 

But on the whole Retro City Rampage is a throwback that shows us why the hell nobody gives a damn about most 8-bit games anymore that weren't the mainstays. Not recommended under sale or otherwise, it's just a frustrating 'REMEMBER' fest.",1562525894,1562525894,False,2,1,0.414430230855941772,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I had something to say about the development at one time and, at least someone from V BLANK that I assumed be the one sole dev as I heard it was a one man job more or less, type at me how I was just a troll. I went as far even to apologize that I didn't mean to come off that way. Granted I never heard anything ever again.

That aside though, the game is a love letter to gaming past based off of his GTA re creation project on actual Nintendo hardware, a project that then simply jumped ahead to more modern hardware while still holding the vibe and feel. Even games like Skate Or Die get a slight nod here as well as more famous IP's remembered to this day such as Metal Gear. 

The controls aren't perfect, but so much better than many games of long ago, so it strikes a very fair balance.

By now almost everyone has it, and by now if for some reason you don't have it, then grab it on sale sometime. The references are great.

The one thing I will mention again though however is that the DEV might come off rough if you talk to him, and some of his life choices, like pulling the new game from STEAM to take EPIC STORE's monopoly money pay off to keep his game over there for at least a year, sadly isn't that much of a surprise.

But Steam doesn't allow ratings and gamers have to look at % of average reviews ( 89% positive at time of  this post which i feel is too high ). Hence i give this an overall negative review.


Pros
- Faithful depiction of 8-bit NES era graphics and detailed artwork.
- World is not too big but very detailed and clearly a work of love. Littered with 90s and 80s gaming references. Humour is there too but average.
-Achievements are decent : not too many, not too easy, not too hard and sufficiently motivating for me.  In fact that is probably the main thing that kept me going. I picked up about 50-60% of them on the course of regular gameplay which motivated me to try and 100% them. 
- About 20- 25 hrs+ hours if you go for the campaigns, side-missions, collection quests  without using any guides and exploring the map at a leisurely pace. 

Cons
- Although the art style is well done and accurate, it is not one i particularly care for. Maybe thats just me.
- Story is meh and not the focus of the game.
- The gameplay is the weakest thing for me. None of it really jumps out. Whether it is the gunplay, driving, boss fights, campaigns most of it is lacklustre. I played GTA2 as a kid, and this doesn't feel as fun as that.  Getting gold at many of the arcade challenges was fun enough but others were tedious. As of writing i am at 93% progress having finished main campaign, gotten gold at all but one of the arcade challenges and collected all but one of the hidden items. Coming from games like SuperHexagon  and Supermeatboy, the game isn't particularly difficult - most of it is smooth if bland sailing. But at times when it gets hard gets annoying in the sense that  it feels tedious and annoying but not particularly rewarding (The last boss fight is a good example of this). This generally lacklustre gameplay is something i felt again and again. 
- Some annoying UI choices multiplies this frustration. For example having to jam the enter key for a second or two death screen, No hotkey for map and other annoyances.
- The final thing that really pissed me off   was the arcade sidemission (8-bit boy or whatever its called). This is moderately difficult (compared to supermeatboy) but what really makes this frustrating is that you have to finish this in 1 go. The player is given no warning about this or told how many stages are there. You can't pause the game (except after completing a stage). Halfway through the seventh stage, i got up for like 30 second to go attend a doorbell and when i came back the game had exited. This shows great disrespect for the users time and effort. Also if you are going to make a hard-as-nails platformer (ala Supermeatboy) then every aspect of your game has to be unimpeachable (including ui, stage restarting) and you better make sure that your mechanics are pixel perfect  and millisecond precise. This decidedly isn't. This level typifies all the things that irked me about Retro City Rampage DX. 

Maybe if you stick to main missions, use guides and not try to take side stuff too seriously this won't be as big an issue for you. YMMV",1560152887,1560152931,False,2,0,0.442101001739501953,0,False,False,False,False,,,

I picked up Retro City Rampage DX after looking for well-received top-down games on Steam. I tend to enjoy playing games with this perspective, as they tend to be streamlined and provide players with a lot of environmental information. This title seems to me to be a parody of Grand Theft Auto 1 & 2, with a lot of fan service and pop culture references thrown in.

While I'll admit that certain aspects of the game were amusing, the ratio between gameplay sections that I found tedious vs. those I found enjoyable was about 2:1. Even simply watching the game's trailer, I'm reminded of:

*Throwing dead bodies at the ""Hearsitar,"" the Go-Go Busters vehicle, while inexplicably dodging firebombs.
*Sneaking by guards in a cardboard box at the prison when it was unclear when I was out of sight.
*Timing my ""sweat bombs"" to platform through a factory with a very small margin for error.
*Clumsily swinging myself back and forth to feed crocodiles with henchmen as ""Biffman"" the superhero.
*Ramming into mailboxes repeatedly on a poorly-controlling bicycle.

This isn't even touching on the game's obnoxious, interminable final boss fight, where you dodge a wrecking ball that instantly kills you by throwing you into grinding gears, pilot a poorly-controlling hoverbike from a perspective that you didn't use during the game, and dodge bombs during a Pole Position-esque chase in which your depth perception is challenged.

Perhaps if your tolerance for parody and referential humor is higher than mine, you'll have fun with this one. However, whatever humor I found couldn't offset the poor overall feel of the gameplay.",1553200263,1553200358,False,4,1,0.499265074729919434,0,False,False,False,False,,,

В заключении можно сказать , что Retro City Rampage DX вдохнула в себя всё самое лучшее из ретро-игр и преподнесла в драйвовом экшене , который к тому же  и стоит недорого , а соответственно рекомендован игрокам всех возрастов!
Единственный минус - нет русского языка , из за чего можно не понять многие отсылки и шутки.

RCR is a decent ride even with zero knowledge of the reference materials. Exploring the city and popping new missions like chips is fast and fun.

The story can be cleared in a few hours and that leaves you with a few more at best to full clear the island, grind gold medals on sprees and free roam, and none of those will really take unless you fall in love with the game. RCR suffers the most when it strays too far from its core game play or tries to push the limited combat system. This becomes very clear in the last several stages which feel like pulling teeth. They're presented well. They're fun at times. The polish is admirable including the 3D glasses mode. It's just a chore punctuated by rockets and an unfortunate nod to no-mistake motorcycle play, an homage best left buried with Battletoads because mere mortals can't enjoy it. Introducing the power ups and not working them into the main mission stages and boss fights feels like a large missed opportunity.

It's fun enough to play. A big, well populated open world, lots of top down driving, twin stick shooting, a variety of weapons, and a number of mini-games that ape the popular game styles of the era. Overall though, I found the experience somewhat repetitive and not particularly addictive. I certainly had my fill by the end of the campaign. The difficulty is variable, but the game is forgiving in the number of tries you are allowed for each stage.  It's nice to play in short stints, but not sure it will hook you in. 

Steeped in references from the 8 bit gaming era and from 80s movies, it will be most entertaining for those who grew up in the era.  As far as I can tell the graphics and sound are faithful to what is possible on the NES. A true 8 bit audio-visual experience.

Polecam Retro City Rampage DX z całego serca jest to zdecydowanie pozycja obowiązkowa dla fanów retro jak i tych, którzy ogrywali retro jak i po prostu starsze gierki dzięki temu będzie zdecydowanie więcej frajdy z przechodzenia gry i zwiedzania pięknego miasta!

Desafortunadamente, termina viajando en el tiempo al entrar en una cabina telefónica, llegando al año 20XX. Aquí conoce al doc ''choc'' (adivinen a que personaje del cine representa), que cree que es un heroe en el tiempo y está dispuesto a ayudarlo, pese a que nuestra heroe tenga que hacer un montón de cituaciones locas ycrímenes sin sentido.
Personalmente, creo que la historia es el punto más fuerte de retro city rampage; es bastante estúpida y no tiene sentido en muchos casos, pero realmente esto es genial, pues no se toma para nada en serio y está llena de parodias, algunas simples y otras muy geniales e inteligentes que nos sacarán más de una risa. En resumen, la historia de retro city es una parodia de principio a fin, y una bastante bien hecha.

----------------------------------- Jugabilidad ----------------------------

Retro city rampage, notablemente por imitar a GTA, es un sandobx, es decir, nos pone en un mapa abierto, enel cual puedes explorar a placer, además de resolver misiones principales y secundarias de la historia. El mapa en sí no es muy grande en comparación con un sandbox actual por obvias razones, pero si tiene bastantes detalles y logra cumplir su objetivo a la perfección, es decir, poner este tipo de gameplay en 8 bits, sin tantas pretensiones. Nosotros nos vemos en una vista cenital, al igual que los primeros juegos de GTA (que jamás he jugado así que no señalare sus similitudes) y tenemos la capacidad de ganar diversas armas, algunas estándares y otras muy locas o sacadas de otros géneros, aunque hay que cuidarlas bien, pues si nos matan en el modo de historia las perderemos. Además de esto, podemos robar autos....los cuales tienen un control muy tosco y torpe que si bien es posible llegar a dominar, nunca dejará de hacer chocar contra lo que sea involuntariamente, y si hacemos con esto si nos ve la policia, nos perseguirán, lo cual es bastante molesto en este caso (involuntariamente, pues en sí es bastante genial que nos persiga la policía), pese a que podamos evitarla al pasar por ciertos puntos del mapa. También podemos hacer cosas como jugar pequeños minijuegos de arcade (juego dentro del juego) y que tienen el plus de ser de otros juegos indie, como meat boy o beat trip, así como minijuegos de azar. Nada muy complejo, pero si nos quitará unos minutos o hasta horas.
Por último nos queda hablar del punto principal del juego, las misiones, las que debo decir tienen el punto positivo de ser todas diferentes y en muchos casos basarse, tanto parcial como completamente, en juegos clásicos, pero agregando elementos de violencia o sátira bastante notables. Hay alguna misión que imita a paper boy al hacernos entregar periódicos, pero esta vez con trampas mortales, por dar un pequeño ejemplo; para no spoilear, diré simplemente que encontraremos misiones que referencian a juegos como smash tv, el primer juego de las tortuga ninja en nes (el cowa-fucking piece of dog shit), frogger, los dos primeros metal gear, entre varios otros, lo cual es realmente agradable.......desafortunadamente estas caen en una notable falta de complejidad, pues los controles de estas no son exactamente buenos y, por decirlo de alguna forma, se llegan a sentir casi como las versiones pobres de lo que intentan imitar; para resumir esto, puedo decir que las misiones de retro city rampage son una colección de minijuegos que en un par de ocasiones ni siquiera son divertidos.....afortunadamente, la historia y el ver que parodia nos deparará próximamente pueden hacer que pasemos esto por alto y sigamos adelante.
Al final, pese a esta falta de complejidad, retro city rampage, en efecto, es un juego entretenido que logra destacarse dentro del mundo independiente por su historia y su variedad.

----------------------------------------- ¿DX? --------------------------------

Como verán en el título, estoy reseñando retro city rampage dx, una versión extendida lanzada para nintendo 3ds, auque con el pasar de los meses llegó al resto de sistemas. DX nos permite jugar sin unos marcos que tenía el juego original, posee una mejora gráfica en los sprites de los personajes (aunque es posible también jugar con los originales), una dificultad más balanceada que el original y se adapta a los controles de la portátil de nintendo. 

----------------------------------------- Gráficos -------------------------------

En cuanto al apartado gráfico, retro city rampage utiliza un estilo pixel art, el cual, en lineas generales, es bastante sencillo,en especial porque el escenario se mantiene estático la mayor parte del tiempo. No obstante, rcr tiene que ser uno de los juegos con más estilo y personalidad propia que he jugado, pues toda la ciudad esta llena de referencias a otros juegos, tanto en paisajes como en carteles o nombres de locales, los que algunas veces llegan a ser muy imaginativos y hasta graciosos. 
Desafortunadamene, el juego es completamente incompatible con el efecto 3d, que es una de las principales virtudes de juegos 8 bits en 3ds.
---------------------------------------- Sonido ---------------------------------

Lo más destacable que tiene rcr en este apartado es la ENOOOOOOOOOOOOORME cantidad de temas originales de estilo chip tune que se han compuesto para él, decenas y decenas de estos, por lo que a variedad musical se refiere no hay queja, Jake Kaufman, Leonard Paul y Mad Creamer se merecen un aplauso. Fuera de esto, he de decir que entre la marejada de temas del título, la mayoría son bastante.....genéricos y olvidables, en especial en comparación con otros trabajos de los compositores (sobre todo del señor Jake)......pero bueno, es solo un detalle que a mí en lo personal me dejo con ganas de más.

-------------------------------------- Conclusión -----------------------------

Retro city rampage es un juego más que notable dentro de la escena indie, con una propuesta más que notable, gran cantidad de parodias que llegan aser muy inteligentes en muchos casos, así como una duración más que decente (entre 5 y 10 horas) me hace recomendarlo sin ningún problema, especialmente porque su precio es bastante bajo en todas sus platafomas (especialmente en pc). Es cierto de que tiene defectos muy marcados por el tipo de propuesta que es (tampoco esperaba que con tantos tipos de misiones distintas, todas se jugaran increíblemente bien), pero en fin, simplemente puedo terminar diciendo que, lo recomiendo.

Lo mejor
+ La gran cantidad de parodias.
+ Todos los detalles que hay en la ciudad.
+ La gran variedad de misiones.
+ Cross overs con otros juegos indies.
+ Precio más que ajustado.
+ Muchísimos temas musicales.
Lo peor
- Las misiones tienen una seria falta de profundidad, al punto de que no todas son divertidas (en mi opinión claro).
- La mayoría de los temas musicales dejan que desear en cuanto a composición.
- Incompatible con el efecto 3d.

Si eres un ""Jugador"" de la vieja escuela, entederas mucho de que se trata este juego con su humor negro, la historia se te hara divertida, mirando las diferentes parodias a juegos clasicos como: Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros 3, Paperboy, Duck Hunt, Excitebike, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Bomberman, The Legend of Zelda, Adventure Island, Metal Gear, etc., a películas como Back to the Future y Rambo, tambien te permite disfrutar de mini juegos de Super Mear Boy, Bit.Trip Runner.

Retro City Rampage es un sandbox en un pequeño mapa con un impecable Pixel Art, repletos de armas, vehiculos, personajes, tiendas, secretos, etc. El sonido y la larga lista de musicas en chiptune. Una cantidad de personajes bien personificados.

La historia es muy corta, no me llevo mas de 4 horas en terminarlo, pero me entretuvo y me hizo sentir nostalgico, sobre todo porque soy un amante del vintage, la decada de los 80, el pixel art y el 8-bit.

Contiene una gran cantidad de configuraciones, por si quieres emular algo mas al estilo del FAMICOM o el Virtual Boy (sientes como el rojo quema tus ojos). Puedes cambiar las emisoras, la HUD, customizar tu personaje. Dispone de varios idiomas, aunque en Español, no se, si es parte de la parodia, pero en algunos dialogos no carga ciertos nombres, aparece la variable vacia ""NULL"" o falta la fotografia del protagonista.

La intensidad y la forma en la que se lleva la historia, puede apartarte de querer jugarlo, como me sucedio la primera vez, pero luego le di una segunda oportunidad y vaya que me arrepiento por no haberlo jugado mas desde la primera vez. Un punto negativo, es la paleta de colores original y algunos de ellos, tiene colores muy intenso que te hace fatigar la vision muy rapido.

Вы выбрали, или были выбраны в счастливые круги обитателей весёлого городка Retro City Rampage! Теперь вам осталось лишь пройти несколько тестов!

1. Первый. Ваше тело должно состоять из пикселей. Если же оно не состоит из пикселей (см. мелкие квадратики) – можем посоветовать утрамбовать тело с помощью кувалды, музыки Григория Лепса (от него вы просто будете пытаться спрятаться как можно ниже в землю, трамбуя свой организм), а также с помощью вагона метро.
2. Второй тест – на слух. Вам, как потенциальному гражданину, надлежит слушать всё в формате 8-бит. Пение птиц, сигналы проезжающих машин, окрики людей – всё это будет в формате “пик-пик” и “пиииииик”, иногда меняющееся в зависимости от гаммы и тональности. Настоятельно советуем вам практиковаться дома, так как окончанием теста будет демонстрация того, как вы будете читать сочинения Маяковского наизусть восьмибитным голосом.
3. И последний, третий тест гражданства – на знание всемирной истории. Преподаватель, в большинстве случаев, будет ветеран утиной охоты – рыжий спаниель. Он очень любит показывать на вас пальцем и ухмыляться, но вы должны всячески противоборствовать любому желанию застрелить это существо (поверьте – пытались все, ни у кого не получилось!). Примерные вопросы будут включать биографию Билли и Джимми, начертание лабиринтов замка Gauntlet, типичные горловые крики Sinistar, методику разбивания кирпичных блоков снизу, и многое другое. 

Готовьтесь тщательно! Получив гражданство вы не только встретитесь с Джоном Ромеро (у нас для него особый храм), но и испробуете на себе роль Мрачного Жнеца, будете угонять миллионы машин, сможете носиться по нашему замечательному городу с клюшкой от гольфа и шлемом викинга одновременно, получать от старцев в пещерах меч и щит (ну вы поняли – “It is dangerous to go alone, take this!”), посидите в Делориане!

[h1]Gone to Waste[/h1]

Imagine Grand Theft Auto, but without the beautiful landscapes, wealth of content, and fun. In essence, that’s exactly what Retro City Rampage is: a poor attempt at bringing back the nostalgia of classic GTA. It brings back the top-down camera and open world, but it fails to do much more than shamelessly shill for your nostalgia, while completely ignoring the things which made older games great. That’s my biggest grievance with Retro City Rampage: it’s so busy shamelessly whoring itself out for your nostalgia that it not only forgets that which made older games great, but seems to forget to be a game as well. It’s always welcome to spice up your game with references, for humor or whatever other reason, but what isn’t welcome is shoving them down the players throat in such a ham-fisted way.I’m not going to pretend that there aren’t any good aspects to RCR, but I’m also not going to pretend like this is a good game just because they tossed some NES references in there. There may be good aspects, but they’re obscured to such an insane degree by all the bad ones that they may as well not even be there, and quite frankly I find myself disappointed. I chose the word disappointed for a reason, and it’s because when I first saw Retro City Rampage I was so excited to actually play a game similar to the original GTA, but instead of seeing an extraordinary open-world game I found a disappointing mess. They had such a fantastic idea here, they could have brought back the glory days of classic open-world games, but instead all they succeeded in creating was a miscarriage of those same games. I desperately wanted to like RCR, even to the point that I was willing to overlook some of its flaws early on, but looking back on my experience I just can’t. There’s simply too many flaws and they’re too egregious for my to ignore, and as such I can’t recommend the purchase of this game.

[h1]Not All Bad[/h1]

I’ll start off by going into some detail as to what parts of the game I actually did like, however few of them there may be. The biggest and most obvious one is the graphics, the art style, it’s perfectly managed to recreate the feeling that those classic 8-bit games had without sacrificing for quality. It makes me feel like I’m downtown playing games at the arcade, instead of at home on my computer. That does nothing but make the game up and further elevate this incredible classic atmosphere to which they seem to have dedicated their game. Not only are the graphics incredible, but the audio and soundtrack are both fantastic as well, doing for your ears that which the beautiful graphics do for your eyes. That however is where my compliments end and the complaints begin, and boy are there a lot of things to complain about here. First off, the game is filled with more nostalgia-bait references than it is actual gameplay, forcing obnoxious and heavy-handed references down your throat like a pill that’s just too big to swallow. The references always seemed to be out of place, on top of already being frustrating to being with, pointlessly crashing into your gameplay just when you wanted it least. Just as the references are obnoxious, so too is the combat. I have one big problem with the combat, and when I say big I mean absolutely massive: it’s completely based on your movement, which is important because you’re going to have to be constantly dodging both enemies and projectiles. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem, in some cases It could have been something I applauded for being different, but here it’s a serious issue. It’s an issue the movement is unpredictable and unresponsive, and there were multiple occasions where I would press a key and have to wait for almost a second for my action to actually happen, like playing CS;GO with 400 ping. In a game that makes you constantly dodge bullets, it’s extremely frustrating that this happens at all, let alone as frequently as it does. I know it sounds like I’m making a lot out of what’s essentially just a single problem, but when the problem is as big as this, it cripples the entire game. It’s Retro City Rampage’s Achilles Heel, and it makes the combat not only unreliable, but generally just absurdly frustrating to play.

I imagine that you thought I was done complaining, but I still have more to discuss so buckle up. Retro City Rampage is a game that should take about two, maybe three hours to complete, and instead it took me a little over five, and that isn’t because I’m just incompetent. The game doesn’t value your time, not even in the slightest bit, constantly forcing you to go back and forth across the entire map, which is rather pathetic for an open-world game. This isn’t something you just do once in a while, but every single mission, and boy does it get old incredibly fast. You feel like a dog being told to go fetch, and then right as you reach your objective, you have to go all the way back again. Not only does the game artificially lengthen its difficulty, but it also artificially increases its difficulty, and in more places than one. There’s a reason that we don’t make games like this anymore, and that reason is that they just aren’t as good and they contain outdated mechanics which have no place in modern gaming. Back in the day when you bought a game, you weren’t guaranteed to actually see the end of it, but that usually wasn’t because it put you through a rigorous test of skill, but because it was probably made poorly. Forcing you to play through entire games with only but a handful of lives, or to endure some absurdly difficult stage with obstacles you couldn’t hope to overcome. Gaming has evolved past that because those are terrible ideas that have no place in modern gaming, or in gaming period. I think it’s despicable that these devs are able to get away with creating such a poorly cobbled together mess of a game just because “that’s how they used to be”. That’s 

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
A poorly-made ""throwback"" to classic games that seems to have forgotten that there's a reason we don't make games that way anymore.

All of the references, jokes mix together well enough and writing is pretty clever at times. Shining example that is hilarious to me is the fact that the game makes fun of today hated (like people woke up from a long, loooooong dream) microtransactions. And this game is from 2014 and even then you could call it late to the party!
But anyway, graphics are meh, it's not bad, nor good, won't make you jolly but won't make you blind either. OST is pretty good, but sound effects suck. Death Race pitch was shocking in the 70s, but it wasn't as annoying as this.
Gameplay is where this game fails, really. Game makes fun of errand and escort missions, but at the same time it is boring errand and escort missions, with some few exception here and there. Controls can get pretty bad, with driving actually being worse than in any GTA entry, which in my opinion is quite of accomplishment. Shooting can also be annoying, mostly because the game nicely shows you tutorial of just holding down the button so you can circle strafe the enemy, but later you will find out it actually doesn't work, because you must face the direction of the enemy and be in range of auto-aim first, and with enemies having rocket launchers and shotguns later in the game, you're better off using right stick instead.
Also, game constantly spams you about stomping, but problem with that is it doesn't matter for the most part if you will jump or stomp on the enemy, because it will do damage anyway. Stomping is only useful nearly by the end of the game, when you get super stomp.
It took me something around 5 hours to complete main quest and side missions with challenges left, so you could say the game is pretty short on content, especially for the price, however, believe it or not, 5 hours with this game is really long. It is one of those games that will make you tired after playing more than hour or two.
What makes you push through is humor, which means game is not for everyone and some references feel rather random, like Toxic Avenger or just thrown in last minute to be there, like Light Gun. Gameplay leaves a lot to be desired and it is more of a endurance game rather than something really engaging, although you might find it fun to wreck havoc in city.
Game ends with really, really crappy boss fight that feels uninspired, cheap and all about twitch reflexes at times. There is no satisfaction when you beat him or watch credits roll.

Game is not bad, but it is not great either. It is meh on the scale of 10 and it is only saved by the jokes and writing. 
If you have nothing to play and just want to have a laugh, go for it, but not for full price. Either wait for the bundle or when it drops to 2-3 euro. You could play worse.",1515777806,1515777806,True,4,0,0.502932310104370117,0,True,False,False,False,,,

The Good
- Colourful 2D Graphics
- Good sound and music which gives the old 80's feel
- Plenty of easter eggs and references such as mario, sonic and teenage mutant ninja tutles
- Plenty of vehicles to drive
- Lots of weapons and power ups to use
- Side quests available
- Good amount of playtime
- Boss fights
- Humour

The Bad
- The controls aren't great becasue they are based on old 80's style games, so you may find targeting enemies with your guns tricky.

First negative point of this game for me is driving section. I had hard times to control the car I drive and I believe car mechanics should have been designed better. 
Second negative point for me is references. It would be good to see some 80s characters or some hidden references sometimes while in the missions or while free roaming, but they were everywhere and that disturbed me a lot. I think references is used too much in this game. 
Overall, I recommend this game if you like to have fun GTA style or if you are pixel art fan like me :)

Tak tady máte jednu videoherní. Tato hra paroduje opravdu veliké množství filmů a her. Já sám jsem během hraní poznal jenom některé, ale myslím si, že je jich tam o mnoho víc. Např. Batman a Joker, Lovci duchů, cesta do budoucnosti atd. 

Hra je především parodií na hru Grand Theft Auto, protože zde máte otevřené celé město a pohled zhora v 8bitech. Město je docela velké, ale především se mil líbí, že je zde hodně otevřených budov, do kterých můžete vstoupit např. videoherna, kasino, holičství, bar atd. 

Hlavní postava se jmenuje The Player a přidá se ke zločinci jménem Joker. Jenomže jejich společná akce se trochu zvrtne a vy se v Toi Toice teleportujete do roku 20XX. Zde se seznámíte s profesorem, který bude chtít tento teleport opravit, a vy máte sehnat chybějící součástky. 

Zde přichází systém misí, který je rozdělený na fáze, které naskakují bez přerušení a ani si toho příliš všímat nebudete, protože vám v danou chvíli bude jedno, jestli jste při misi ve fázi 1 nebo 3. Mise jsou různorodé, většinou jde o to, že vymlátíte všechny kolem, ale jsou zde i mise závodní a skákací. Mise nejsou nijak obtížné (pokud nepočítám ty ke konci), a tak budete bez větších zádrhelů pokračovat dále. 

Pokud v misi zemřete, nemusíte ji celou opakovat od začátku, ale vrátíte se na začátek poslední fáze nebo nějaký checkpoint. Pokud zemřete obnoví se vám zdraví na maximum a započítá se vám jeden minusový bod, který vůbec nic neznamená. 

Grafika je v 8bitech, ale vypadá docela dobře a vůbec se v ní neztratíte. Ze začátku může někomu dělat problém ovládání, než si zvykne (především při řízení auta). 

Zvuky jsou takové 8bitové, stejně tak hudba. Celé to dokresluje atmosféru hry a nijak ji to nezhoršuje.

The developer stretches varying gameplay mechanics too thin by trying to introduce a bunch. Many of these are halfbaked however. The driving mechanics and shooting are good, but the rest of them, like trying to build a bridge out of enemy corpses are terrible.

The game tries to introduce different enemy types but really they are just reskins that run at you and shoot. There are some references to other games and popculture like lulzninjaturtles. The lulzninjaturtles are nothing special and do the same exact thing that every other enemy does to you during the game - run directly at you with their weapon. I want to keep going, but the more i think about it, the sicker i get. I ended up spending 60 dollars for a game on 4 systems that i beat in about 3-4 hours.

A sweet mixture of GTA and pop culture. Is that a bad thing?Well, the answer to that is subjective. I personally loved this game. It was action packed and difficult, which are two factors in gaming that are the secret formula to solid gameplay. The story was maybe a bit flawed and even a little over-the-top, but its not supposed to be a serious game. The gameplay is basically the primitive top-down GTA games getting a makeover. You have an array of weapons and you can steal vehicles. One last nice thing about the game is that it features something most games don't bother with. The game has the option to run at either 60 fps or 30. Though this alone isn't ground-breaking, if the game detects a constant drop in frames when you're running at the preferable 60 fps, the game will kick you down to 30 fps so you keep the consistent frame rate either way. Kind of irrelevant, but a nice touch either way. 
The game eventually will feel repetitive towards the end, and for good reason. The game itself is simillar missions over and over again with bits of story inbetween. When I wasn't tired of it, I enjoyed it more than anyone else in my friends list did. By the time it does get monotonous, you'll be near the end anyway. Also, the final boss is surprisingly well done. Not spoiling it though

And that's one of it's best and perhaps worst issues. 

The core idea of Retro City Rampage is to basically create a top down GTA style video game.  That's GTA as in the original GTA, which used a very similar but simplistic version of this game.    However they are vastly different games.  Where GTA is just a crime simulator, Retro City Rampage instead adds a huge sprawling story, tons of buildings you can enter, great unique experiences, and references to other games. 

That last part is what I was saying is the best and perhaps worst issue.  This game just nails the nostalgia for long times fans of the industry, and I do mean long times.  There's a part of the world that is clearly based off of Mario Bros. (Again not the super mario bros), and it's brilliant and subtle.  There's a ton of these references most of the time quite subtle, such as four turtles jumping out of a sewer, the bike shop owner is recognizable from a certain boxing game.  The opening of the game is clearly a remake of a great movie with a clowned prince.  And so on. 

But there's a problem here.  If you never played Mario Bros, but you played the rest, will you recognize them?  Not in this form unless you know this specific layout.     There's references to Metal Gear (the original again.. wow I'm saying that a lot), Contra, Sonic, and a ton of movies and tv shows. 

The thing is much of this is hit or miss, there's a few characters which clearly are references to something but I didn't know what it was referring too, and that kind of sucked.  There's also a bunch of indie darlings such as Phil Fish and Billy Campbell, who again unless you REALLY know your stuff you'll kind of ask ""Who's that?"" 

The problem is most of the game references though come from the original games in series, we're talking you're probably going to want 30 years of gaming history under your belt to really get these reference, and that's ok, but at the same time newer players will miss a great deal of these, and they are a big part of why I enjoyed the game, without them... I'm not sure I'd enjoy this game nearly as much. 

However the gameplay in this game is mostly short levels, usually only a few screens long or a few minutes.  There's over 60 missions in the game, and they are mostly great (with a few controller breaking hard ones, looking at you splosion man knock off).  

What really works though is almost every quest giver will tell a specific storyline/reference.  There's as I mentioned metal gear, but there's also the game genie, and a FANTASTIC Saved by the bell reference.  That one alone is a scream. 

The controls in the game are also great, while I do have a problem with the stomp move being inaccurate, everything else feels really tight and gives the player a proper amount of control. 

The one big complaint I have might seem odd but the achievements in this game feel all wrong.  20 achievements might have been enough, but it still feels like this game should have at least 30, if not 50.  There's so many little missions that could have gotten an achievement but beyond that, the game gives very odd achievements.  There's not even one for beating the whole game, and there's only a few that are really hard.  

However the game does give good rewards in game for the entire playthrough, it's just that the achievements feel off in some odd way.  

Overall though I will say I liked this game a lot.   But there's a few flaws, and a few frustrations.  However I really got along with the nostalgic references, if you knew half of them, I think you'd be more than fine, however if you really don't get nostalgia references or you miss the majority of them, I would say this game might not be as fun to play.   And that's be a real shame, but it would be the deciding factor to me.",1504035571,1504035571,True,8,0,0.575165748596191406,0,True,False,False,False,,,

[*] Alright music.
[*] Get's the old school aesthetic right on.
[*] Has a fairly lengthy campaign and a lot of side missions.

Cons[list]
[*] Filled with a lot of busy work and doesn't provide a lot of fun activities to do.
[*] Arcade mini games are complete and utter garabage, with flashing and otherwise obnoxious color pallets and unfun gameplay.
[*] Campaign missions and most side missions are unnecessarily difficult and require a lot of trial and error.
[*] Boring gameplay and uninteresting weapons.
[*] Combat is terribly done and feels like an absolute chore to do.
[*] Relies entierly on references and has little to no original humor. So if you're knowledgable in pop culture, then you'll most likely predict every joke before they manage to say it.

This was a boring and unfun trip into the bad side of retro-like games that tries too hard to emulate the old school nature of games, without making the game engaging or actually fun to play.

I gave up after getting bored with the campaign and getting annoyed with the terribly designed mini games.

It isn't one of the greatest games out there, and won't be ranked among the likes of Terrarria and Minecraft in the indie gaming community, but it is certainly fun, and will give you more than your money's worth of entertainment.

Pros: 
Fun. 
decent humor (if you lived through the 80s)
lots of 80s pop culture and gaming geek jokes (warning: some of these will go over the heads of all by the geekiest among you)
achievements, and leaderboards,
variety of weapons and vehicles. 
Good solid fun game.
on sale almost every major sale event. 

Cons: 
Finicky controls, 
keyboard controls are limited, 
works best with a dual d-pad gamepad not that those are easy to find these days. 
It not the absolute best game out there for this price, even if it's a good solid fun game.

Other notes: 
Difficulty gets rather high towards the end. You may have to forego some of the achievements and cheat to win. (There are cheats provided in-game for this.) You can always try again on a second run.

All in all, it's a good game, and probably worth the full price tag, but it's probably going to be one of those games you will get on sale or in a bundle. You will certainly enjoy the game, even if it's not going to be one of those games you spend thousands of hours playing and fall completely head over heels in love with.

The amount of content is staggering for an indie game, and I still have plenty to do despite my hours into the game. The strenghs are as follows:

+Nice retro look and sound. 
+Lots of easter eggs to find. Like refrences to older games and such.
+Lots of variation with missions. None of them feel the same. You could blow things up one minute and the next you may be doing something like paperboy.

That isn't to say it's perfect. The missions with racing can be unfair due to limited view(as it's over head) and this can lead to stoping dead on a fence or wall. You have an arrow pointing the way so you don't get lost but it can't show things in the way. Just know you may find these missions infuriating. Also while the humor can be funny(You get a manson by changing the name of the owner on the deed...and this works) but it can be too reliant on your knowledge of games for it's humor and that can be confusing and miss the mark.

At the end of the day I think it's one of the best indie games i've played. It doesn't take itself too seriously. Has alot to do and above all, it's fun.  8/10",1499365517,1499375742,True,9,0,0.633872449398040771,0,True,False,False,False,,,

But later, when you escape with the school bus you can't take a turn out of the bank,  because of how many school buses are out there (even a dead Frogger on the street) - so the solution is: blow up a fe to reduce traffic! Then later escape on foot, going into the sewers while the TMN Turtles attack you, and this is the game's first few minutes.
Later the game uses the GTA formula: open world with cars, customization stores, weapon stores  (food/drink heals, coffee speeds up) and with rampage / challenge points, main and side missions. The whole game is just awesome - almost every quest has references to movies/games or even reflections about game industry and trends, the world is jam-packed with jokes and funny characters and events. There are some general difference though: missions are slightly longer and often happen through multiple locations (There are checkpoint between them!) and the police is way less annoying - every cop has about 10-15% chance to drop a police cloaking device that will remove your wanted rating. I think this is a great change, as you won't need to spend half of the gameplay time to drive to spray paint garages.
What else the game has?  Good music, multiple gameplay modes during the story, slightly casualized but more streamlined open-world gameplay, original and interesting storyline where something always happens, I loved it so, so much!   Also just a mention, but it's kind of weird how hard the final levels of the game are compared to the whole.

Retro City offers up a good amount of content, including single player story mode. 

I played a little bit of this game, enough to get the idea and mess around a bit. Reason being…I got this in a bundle and I’m not a huge fan of pixel graphics or open world games in general. However, this is a good game and I can recognize that. Gameplay is solid, controls are tight. Controller support is excellent. The story is nothing special and the same goes with the characters. I found after a few missions it was becoming pretty repetitive.

The first bit of the game is a very nice tutorial section. After that, the game leaves you to choose what to do. Continue the story or explore, do challenges, etc. 

I’m impressed with the game but it’s just not a genre I truly enjoy. I won’t give this a final score but if you’re interested in this type of genre, it’s definitely worth buying. 

[b]Pros[/b]
+60fps
+Story based single player mode
+Tight controls
+Solid gameplay
+Multiple visual filters and HUD’s
+Good amount of content
+Frequent parody and pop culture / video game references 

[b]Cons[/b]
+Repetitiveness sets in early
+Music volume kept resetting itself each time the game was launched

RCR's gameplay absolutely thrashes the original GTA (and all the GTA's in my opinion, but I may be alone in that) that it is so closely based on. Especially the handling of the vehicles which is a joy and easier to both run down lots of pedestrians, and drive safely with traffic.

If you like me grew up in the age of the mega drive and the SNES then this game is what you wished you could of played, orignally a lovingly crafted demake of a certain open world game (GTA) after a legal case the name was changed and portions of the game were to however this detracts nothing from the game it's self.
Packed full of missions and challanges
A great retro sounding soundtrack ( what else do you expect ) 
Also you get an MS DOS prototype version and the orignal SNES rom with the purchase of this game
fully compatable with game pads.

First off, the gameplay is really fun and can get challenging in spots. However, it all stays fair and I never once felt like any of my deaths were cheap or unavoidable. It was always something I could've gotten myself out of if I had simply played better. The feel of the controls helps in this regard, as they're very tight & responsive, just as you would expect from a game of this style. One negative of the gameplay is... driving is a bit of a hassle, as you would expect from a top-down game like this, since you can't really see what's going to be in front of you and unless you have the city layout entirely memorized, you might end up crashing into a wall or two.

The graphics achieve the nice retro NES look that they were going for, and even when the novelty of it wears off, they let you choose from a lot of different graphics filters, many of which emulate the look of different retro game hardware. It's a really nice touch and allows you to keep the game looking new & interesting throughout the duration of the story mode.

The music is also very good. It's a bunch of catchy & memorable chiptunes made very much in the style of NES sound hardware, while not strictly adhering to it's limitations. It fits the game very well, and will likely get stuck in your head later on.

There are some challenge modes with online leaderboard support as well, which you can either find in the world (much like the ""killing sprees"" in GTA) or access from the main menu. These manage to be pretty fun if you're looking to compete with your friends. They even include replays for these challenges that you can watch for players on the leaderboards, or which you can save & share with your friends.

The story is probably the weakest part of the game, essentially being a string of retro game & movie parodies, which are cute at first but end up getting a bit tiring about halfway through the game's 8-or-so hour length. Still, the gameplay is fun enough that it's easy to overlook the annoyance of the parodies after a while and just enjoy the game for what it is: A fun throwback to the classic 2D top-down GTA games which has a really cool, retro style, good controls, and a nice slate of features which will keep you coming back to it.",1478177156,1478177393,True,0,0,0.428926974534988403,0,True,False,False,False,,,

很多人都提了缺乏深度的问题，的确，这游戏虽然看起来元素丰富，但实际上缺乏让玩家沉浸其中的目标，玩家不做主线，想跟gta一样游荡的话很快就丧失了乐趣。
我认为其实并不是这个游戏作者的失误，而是gta初代本来的游戏性就不够，gta的前2作的游戏性远不及其第3作（更不需要谈画质了）。gta系列从3代开始才有了如今的地位，Retro City Rampage视图做的核心gameplay从一开始就感觉没选对模型。
我认为这个游戏的核心问题在于：视图在2维平面上复刻在3维世界才有乐趣的玩法，后面的开车手感不好等显而易见的问题都出自这里。本来可以做的更好的双摇杆射击部分可能局限于像素风格没能做好，但是有改进希望，但开车部分从本质上就是无解的。

除开本质性的问题不谈，Retro City Rampage依旧是个好游戏，但只是针对少数人而言。开发组非常努力地塞进去了很多梗，可以说整个游戏的任务就是由梗串联起来的，几乎每个任务都有对应的恶搞（或者说致敬）的对象，而且细节安插的很棒（印象比较深的有某关逃亡路过下水道里跳上几个忍者神龟）。
游戏剧情以搞笑为主，当然由于语言的问题可能有些玩家觉得无趣，这只能说是遗憾了。

总体来说，我只能推荐给还怀念NES时代的老玩家们或是喜欢像素风格的玩家们（当然包括我自己XD），其他的同学还是等等看这个开发组的新作品吧，应该更好玩一些。",1475837205,1475837205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Retro City Rampage pays homage while parodying so many things from the 80's, and some things from the 90's and now, that its easy to lose track at just how many films, comics, cartoons, etc, that are poked fun at.  To add to the whole 80's retro theme the game is an 8 bit throw back to the NES days which may make it unlikable to those who are extremely obsessed with the latest and greatest graphics but for those who prioritize gameplay over graphics and are total children of the 80's and gratitious but very cartoon violence, they'll love this game.  Gameplay wise, it isn't unlike G2A 2, you go around doing missions and side quests, stealing cars, gunning down people, etc, and so on but what gives it an edge over GTA 2 is the games sense of humor.  I also recommed this title to those who are into the humor in Duke Nukem and Postal games, the Player (that's the lc's name) isn't as rauncy but it has a fair share of non pc humor.

J'imagine que c'est fait exprès, mais la version française traduite, avec toutes ses fautes d'orthographes et ses raccourcis, et à mourir de rire. L'histoire est déjantée sans prendre de place importante et le jeu regorge de secrets, de clins d'oeils, de caméos en tout genre.
Je regrette cependant une difficultée trop inégale et parfois trop élevée pour certains passages qui cassent le rythme du jeu; on enchaîne trois missions funs où on défonce tout le monde en leur piétinant le visage puis on arrive dans un niveau labyrinthique ennuyeux où on se fait tuer en deux coups et on recommence tout. On passe trop vite du ""ha, c'est court, c'est fun !"" au ""pff, c'est long et chiant...""

Bon, le jeu se finit en une petite poignée d'heures donc ça passe quand même. C'est quand même dommage que le dosage soit aussi inégal.

Herzlich Willkommen in Theftropolis im Jahr 1985.

RCR verkörpert Nostalgie pur, ein Spiel wie eine Zeitreise vollgestopft mit Erinnerungen und Anspielungen an die Popkultur der 80er und frühen 90er Jahre, angefangen bei Batman ,Ninja Turtles oder den Back to the Future Filmen bis zu Games wie Paperboy, Mega Man, Frogger ist alles dabei, um nur einige zu nennen.

Das Spiel wird wie sein Vorbild GTA 1 aus der Vogelperspektive gespielt, das alles in 8-Bit Grafik ""Schönheit"" unterlegt mit zeitgemäßen 80er Jahre Chiptune Sound.

Die Stadt Theftropolis ist Open-World typisch frei erkundbar mittels Zweirad, PKW, LKW, Bus, Panzer, Monster-Truck oder zu Fuss. Das Stadtgebiet ist im Vergleich zum Vorbild GTA 1 sehr klein.

Das Gameplay ist angelehnt an die ersten beiden GTA Teile, Aufträge und Missionen werden durch Personen oder über Münzfernsprecher erteilt, man kann der Missionstruktur der Kampagne folgen oder zahlreiche Nebenmissionen abarbeiten. Aufträge und Missionen sind sehr vielfältig gestaltet und abwechslungsreich. Seiner Zerstörungswut kann man freien Lauf lassen in dem man wahlos Passanten überrollt. Autos zu Schrott fährt und mittels vielfältigen Schlag und Schusswaffenarsenal einen Straßenkrieg anfängt. Was natürlich die Polizei und mit steigenden Fahndunglevel die Armee auf den Plan ruft. Seinen HIGHSCORE kann man durch das erledigen von Missionen oder in dem man sein Unwesen in der Stadt treibt stetig in die Höhe treiben.

Für mich ist RCR eine schöne Reise in meine Jugend gewesen, die durch das Fernsehen und das spielen am Heimcomputer mitprägt wurden.
Der Schwierigkeitsgrad steigert sich im Spielverlauf von moderat bis extrem schwierig (letzte Missionen der Kampagne), und passt zu den anspruchsvollen Schwierigkeitsgraden den die Spiele dieser Zeit noch hatten.

Retro City Rampage ist ein Spiel mit besonderem Retro Charme, insbesondere für eine Generation, mich eingeschlossen, die in die Jahre gekommen ist aber immer noch Spaß an guten Spielen hat.

Abschließend  Retro City Rampage ist ein schönes Retro Open -World Action Game im Sinne von GTA 1.

Retro City Rampage это чертовски хороший клон игр серий гта, времен вида сверху. И я имею в виду [b]чертовски хорош. [/b]Эта игра была первой из купленных игр мной в стиме. Я провел в этой игре тысячи часов на своем смартфоне, и нисколько от нее не отвык. Возможно, тут играет свою роль ностальгия, но давайте разберем все по частям.

Графика
Графика тут восьмибитная, в стиле игр на NES, но это не мешает выглядеть игре по своему красиво. Игра красочная, спрайты лиц, машин и текстуры улиц сделаны очень добротно.

Саундтрек
Черт возьми, в эту игру стоит поиграть хотя бы ради саундтрека. Восьмибитные запилы от Norrin Radd, virt и Freaky DNA каждый раз заставляют меня трепетать[spoiler] virt - Try ВАН ЛАВ!!1![/spoiler].

Геймплей
Очень динамичный, никогда не устанешь заходить в свободный режим и подрывать машины в танке. Что касается сюжетки, то здесь вы найдете для себя 64 увлекательных миссии и кучу карикатур и отсылок к массовой культуре. Относительно багов, я нашел только один графический. Игра очень добротно сделана и играется без проблем. Также, если вам надоело крушить автомобили и убивать горожан, можно сыграть в мини игры и демо порт RCR для NES в аркадном зале, или пройти специальные игровые челленджи.

Replay Value: OVER 9000

С выходом Shakedown Hawaii, второй игры от тех же разработчиков и похожей атмосферой, RCR получила небольшую графическую планировку, были добавлены небольшие анимации в катсценах и диалогах. Что касается SH, то я также настоятельно рекомендую попробовать и его. RCR сама по себе не дорогая, а на распродаже и вообще копейки.

Ее закрома неистощимы, и она с первой до последней минуты буквально бомбардирует вас новыми ощущениями, черпая их в вашем же собственном прошлом. Если вам кажется, что это неинтересно, то мы явно говорим на разных языках.
При желании у игры можно найти много недостатков: некоторые автомобили ездят слишком медленно, интерфейс далёк от совершенства, к графике и звуку надо привыкнуть. Но Retro City Rampage — это шанс погрузиться в объятия ностальгии, в те времена, когда только-только начиналось знакомство с играми. Подборка уморительных пародий и выворачивание на изнанку современных жанров не дают заскучать. В свою очередь, зубодробительные схватки с боссами и прочие сцены «с приветом из прошлого» держат в напряжении. Превосходная возможность заглянуть в альтернативную игровую реальность.

Достоинства:	
`Отличные штуки на самые разные темы
`Неожиданные образы популярных героев
`Мастерски переделанные моменты из известных игр
`Сложные моменты в духе старых игр
`Секреты, испытания и дополнительные режимы
`Замечательный визуальный стиль и музыкальное сопровождение

Недостатки: 
`Хватает затянутых сражений
`Некоторые контрольные точки расставлены далеко друг от друга
`Не представляет особого интереса для тех, кто плохо знаком с классикой времён NES и определенными фильмами
`Ряд мелких недоработок

Можливо, багато хто скаже, що ігри на той момент були не самі продвинуті, та, на мою думку, розробники у прямому сенсі вкладали в свої творіння щіпотку душі та шматочок свого серця. 

     Тож не дивно, що ця гра відкриває нам дорогу ""НАЗАД В... '80-е"". Можна навіть жартома назвати RCR:DX королем шедеврів, хоча в деякій мірі так і є. Ну ось де, як не тут ви побачите стільки різноманітних відсилок і ""теплих"" карикатур до культових ігор уже з перших хвилин? - Звісно, що ніде, а особливо на такому рівні гармонійності. Щоправда, окрім відсилок до фільму ""Назад у майбутнє"" і до ""TMNT"" більш нічого не назву - не знаю інших назв, бо, на жаль, ніколи не відчував ніякого великого захоплення до проектів того часу :)

     А тепер настав час розповісти вам мої враження щодо гри - насамперед, мені сподобалось те, що гемплейно гра нагадує перші дві частини із серії ігор про найвидатнішого крадія машин, а саме: GTA: London 1961 та GTA II. Стилістика гри теж захоплююча, ніби дійсно ""назад до вісімдесятих"". Це ж можна сказати й про музикальний супровід, що дуже канонічно підходить для гри з ії ""характером"". Також я був приємно здивований, коли збагнув, що гра схожа на Saints Row 3, одну з моїх улюблених ігор, і навіть присвоїв грі кумедний титул ""почесного другого місця за найкращу гру у ігровому всесвіті святих"": навіть сюжет просто на стільки ""бомбезний"" і ""скажений"", що далі уже нікуди. А у вільний час від сюжетний місій можна відточити свої уміння у великій кількості міні-ігор, чи просто влаштувати прочуханки всьому місту ... арсеналу тут досить, починаючи з простого пістолету й закінчуючи неприступним танком, вогнеметом та ракетницею. 

     Загалом, мені гра дуже сподобалась, а тому рекомендую ії вам. Вона різнобарвна, різноманітна, цікава, подекуди кумедна, захоплююча, позитивна і просто гармонійна, з приємними музичними композиціями і візуальною стилістикою. А ще гра має веселі іконки досягнень, що не може не радувати, адже ними можна неабияк прикрасити профіль. Щодо недоліків, то слід зазначити, що гра трішки коротка: годинок так 6-8.

However, the proper way to play is not simply to beat the game here. Nay, the true goal is to take as much tiime between missions as possible, thus increasing the playtime by at least twofold. That being said, other than the actual arcade-style games-within-a-game, the only game I've been able to come up with for this is ""See How Long You Can Survive the Police"". The story missions are quite enjoyable and provide the variety I cannot, although there really should have been more of them (especially the non-story missions). The endgame somehow manages to take away both the titular city and rampage, instead opting to throw in a tonne of combat. And then you reach the final boss. While I personally found it a pain to beat, I can only imagine the difficulty one would have with it if they hadn't played one of the aformentioned games-within-a-game. Have fun if you miss one of your incredibly specifically-timed attack opportunities!

In short Retro City Rampage is a fun game, as long as you don't put too much effort into beating it. It's fun, but doesn't have too much depth.

The TMNT parody stuff is highly amusing, and then the A-Tem show up, and you'll come across the Burton verison of Batman which at the same time pays homage to the old campy tv series, and there are even some 90's elements like the moments where the game mocks Saved by the Bell.  As for the main bad guy, the developer seemed to base him off the corrupt boss in Warrant's old music videos from their Dirty Rotten era.  But like I said, there are a lot of 80's elements and Back to the Future is one o fthe big ones.

In short, this game has retro NES graphics, and plays like one of the original GTA games but is chock full of 80's and some 90's satire and tht makes it totally worth getting if one is an 80's/90's junkie.  Th elead character, despite being an 8 bit character, is also pretty amusing.

In short, I highly recommend this game to my fellow gen x'ers who grew up watching all of those 80's films and are into violent games that are violent in an amusing way.

Retro City Rampage [i]ostensibly[/i] is an 80s homage/NES recreation of Grand Theft Auto. However, getting into the game, one will quickly realize that it's a dumping ground for pop culture references, with a game that cannot decide what the hell it wants to be. 


[b]Graphics/Art[/b]
Usually, faux-retro graphics is a kiss of death for indie games. Far too many developers use 8-bit homage as an excuse to make lazy pixel art. I am willing to excuse it in this instance considering that RCR was originally supposed to be an actual NES conversion of Grand Theft Auto. The character portraits are about what you'd expect from a higher-budget NES game, with the in-game art being fairly small

[b]Sound Design[/b]
The music is good, but that's to be expected from Jake Kaufman. That said, he's done far better work for far better games (Check Shovel Knight, one of the few truly great retro throwbacks.) Not that you'd be able to hear the music unless you muted the sound effects, which is a very smart move because Retro City Rampage has some of the most ear-grating sound effects I've ever heard in a game. Every few seconds, there's digitized screeching, what's supposed to be sirens and constant white noise that is supposed to be gunshots.

[b]Story/Character-World Building/Dialogue[/b]
Once upon a time in the 2000s, there were two directors named Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. After being part of the staff for the popular Scary Movie series, they set out to make their own comedies, such as Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie. Everyone [b]hated[/b] these movies, and deservedly so, because in lieu of making jokes about pop-culture, they would just reference the fact that it exists. Seltzer and Friedberg are now pariahs in Hollywood, because everyone hates them. 

What does this have to do with Retro City Rampage, you ask? Because I'm convinced that this game's writers' only comedic reference were Selzter and Friedberg movies. The game does not tell jokes. The game tells references. Technically, the whole plot of the game is an *ahem* ""parody"" of Back to the Future. The tone of the game is set right at the beginning, where within the span of about six minutes, the game references Mega Man 2, Duck Hunt, The Dark Knight, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The A-Team, Contra, Mario Bros, Frogger, and Bill and Ted (or maybe it's Doctor Who.) See, the joke is that you probably recognize these things and they are there. The villain is literally Dr. Robotnik from Sonic the Hedgehog, except his name is Buttnick. There's a level where you go to a factory. The joke is that the robot is the Destructoid robot.  [b]H I L A R I O U S.[/b] 

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The story mode will showcase several problems with the game
1. There are several missions where you are faced with a ton of enemies, which showcases how bad the lock-on aiming is. It's inconsistent with when it wants to actually lock on. 
2. The game has knockback when you are damaged, which [i]will[/i] frequently kill you in later stages
3. The game will force you into random diversions, usually to show off another ""parody."" Want to ride a slow bike that can barely turn? No? Too bad! The developer remembered that Paperboy existed. Want to throw barrels at a wall and have to constantly douse yourself when you catch fire? It's a good thing that Tapper was a thing the developer knew about. How about having an automatic runner stage featuring a guy who can propel himself with his sweat? Don't know what the homage it, but you get it anyways! Then comes the last two stages. Now, in most video games, you would need to use all the skills you've learned in the game so far to the test but- hold the phone. The developer decided that for the final stages, the player should throw all their skills away and play freaking Outrun. I could excuse the arcade minigames because those were optional, but here, you are forced to play Outrun, while Dr. Robotnik fires missiles at you that are timed to hit you right when it's impossible to avoid them.

* Free roam, with an emphasis on killing sprees. Basically, what GTA is built for.
* Chris Hoffman himself is a cosmetic in this game.
* A emphasis on retro graphics and style-you can even change the TV border (or turn it off)
* DX mode makes it easier than what you've heard (and is toggleable)...

Connatatives:

*...but it's still hard. Expect a lot of deaths and some frustrating levels.
* Once you finish the story, you're really only left with Leaderboarded-Challanges and Collectibles

Oh, and with loads of pop culture and video game references. This combination of different gameplay and style works well, playing out like an 8 bit version of GTA and similar games with plenty of humor and parodies going on.

The story revolves around Player, the main character of the game, who is a henchman. After stealing a time traveling phone booth that takes him into the year 20XX, Player must work with Doc Choc to fix the time machine and also interact with other characters in Theftopolis to get the needed parts. In the game, the story is driven through missions and cutscenes. Along with the main missions for the story are optional side missions that provide extra narrative based on the main plot.
The game uses a lot of parodies and references throughout as seen with the characters and scenery, to name a few. With the sheer amount of references going left and right, it’s easy to be overwhelmed, but the parodies are a good laugh with a focus on video games and 80s and 90s pop culture. The references range from mainstream to obscure and subtle to blunt, and it’s a great experience keeping with the game’s theme and setting. The majority of the references lie in Story Mode, which really drives not just the parodies but also the overall style of the game.

Retro City Rampage plays much like a cross between open world games like Grand Theft Auto with some gameplay style from NES games. Like in most open world games, there is a big city to explore and missions pointing you to certain locations. The majority of missions focus on getting to a certain spot on the map and doing a certain task. There’s a great variety of different tasks to do, making the Story Mode missions interesting with different gameplay goals to complete. In addition to the structured missions that show each objective to be done, there are also arcade style missions with the goal being to get a high score. These arcade missions are quite fun in their own right, focusing instead on pure mayhem and causing as much destruction in the city.
As the gameplay borrows from GTA, there are some common elements in Retro City Rampage. Cars can be stolen, pedestrians can be attacked, police will attack upon seeing a crime, and there are a variety of weapons to use.  The game does deviate from typical open world games by bringing its own twist based on games from the 8 bit era. Jumping is performed like in platforming games with the intent to jump over obstacles and to jump on people’s heads. This jump attack can kill people and is a powerful unarmed attack. Objects and people can be picked up and thrown in a manner similar to beat em up games, where any object is carried over the head and thrown forward. Powerups can bestow different effects. These powerups must be bought unless a mission gives one that must be used, and they give a huge amount of power in a limited time.
In addition, the game is quite fair when it comes to trying to complete missions. After dying in a mission a few times, the game will offer some useful tips pertaining to that mission. If the game feels that the mission is quite tough for the person playing based on the many deaths that occurred, the game may change things around by giving a handicap to help complete the mission. This function of making the missions a tad bit easier is not in every mission, so some particularly tough missions must be completed at the default difficulty. Anyhow, it’s clear to see the inspiration from open world games, but there’s also a great combination with gameplay from NES games that works well as a game that is fun to play.

This game employs an 8 bit pixel style, with a very sincere approach in imitating the style of actual games from that era. The graphics are quite blocky and low resolution in the overworld, as if the game were on the NES. Character portraits are also similar in style, along with capturing the original character or person’s features from the parody. Only a few modern graphical liberties are used, one of which is the wavy screen distortion effect. In addition to its 8 bit style, there are various screen borders that slightly affect the presentation of the game, either by placing high resolution graphical borders that fit the game’s theme to even changing the colors of the game. With the 8 bit NES art style, the game treats the graphics quite well. It’s the same way that the parodies are treated with respect toward the original material, and the game goes great lengths into accurately portraying visuals as if it were an actual NES game with great results.

The music in the soundtrack is chiptune like the style of the game. There are some nice tunes played throughout, with the soundtrack being done by various video game musicians. Each of the songs work very well with the tone and style of the game, with a few parodies too based on some popular NES tunes. Overall, the soundtrack is quite catchy and stays true to the general theme quite well.
Of note is the sound design, which is done like the sounds of the NES. All the sounds are not realistic and instead go for the beepy electronic noises that were a mainstay of games in the 80s. This design choice perfectly matches what the game was going for, with almost every aspect of the game being lifted from an NES game from its original time. There are only a few unique things seen in modern games that this game uses, but Retro City Rampage does so well in staying true to the original retro video game style.

Retro City Rampage is in essence, an 8 bit version of open world games like GTA with lots of parodies here and there. The story is quite straightforward with the majority of parodies going there for a good laugh. The gameplay draws from GTA the most but throws in some gameplay style from NES games too. To top it off, both the art and music stay close to the style of the NES and holds its origins in high regard. Retro City Rampage is a fun game to play and oozes with respect for retro video games.",1462343853,1462343872,True,6,1,0.549195408821105957,1,True,False,False,False,,,

I got interested in the game because of its development history, it was originally developed as a homebrew game for the NES, which makes it one of the few retro games that could really run on retro hardware. It is only 22 mb large on my system, available for practically all operating systems (I am playing on linux) and all consoles, the dev made even a DOS port. That it is dedication and I think the programming of this game is really really well done.

I finally bought the game because of a discount on steam and found out that the gameplay is also really fun, most things just feel right. There is not as much to do in the open world as in the ""real"" GTA games. I have rushed through the story missions, which I just finished, so there are still a lot of ""challenges"" for me to try. The story is fun, does not take itself too serious, but it is not deep, moving or particularly smart. The game is a satire and lives from its parodies of  old school games like Mario, Zelda and such, so it is definetly an advantage if you know those, but if you don't, it is still fun.  Some missions are definitly not easy, but usually doable, at least after a couple of tries, especially because the DX version features in-game tips (thank you dev). However, I would really recommend to play this game with a gamepad, I have not tried the keyboard control yet but I cannot imagine that it would feel as good as a gamepad.

So if you like retro games, cool 8-bit graphics and music and running around an open world shooting everything and if you don't fear an occasional challenge, I am sure you will enjoy this game for about 10 hours at least. I have played it only for 7, but there are still many things I want to do.

However, it is not a game that I will love in the same way as I love for example ""Zelda: A Link to The Past"" or ""Cave Story"". The world is not small, but it is also not deep, believable or full of charming characters, same as the flat main characters. A game can be a retro satire AND have a moving story with deep characters, as UNDERTALE proved. If you are looking retro game with a moving story, that might be more for you. However, the gameplay was definetly more fun in RCR, imo. I enjoyed it and will recommend it.",1459957541,1459957730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Leider ist es das aber nicht. Die Grafik sieht einfach nur furchtbar aus (handwerklich schlecht gemacht). Die sechs kurzen Lieder wechseln sich ständig ab, so dass diese relativ schnell nerven.

Aber das schlimmste ist das Gameplay. Aus meiner Sicht ist die Steuerung einfach nur kaputt. Weder auf einem Gamepad noch auf der Tastatur (schon etwas besser), lässt sich dieses Biest auch nur ansatzweise präzise steuern. Es ist mir in sechs Stunden nicht gelungen ansatzweise durch die Stadt zu tuckern ohne JEDE Ecke mitzunehmen.

Gerade in Kombination mit den unnötigen Zeitlimits, wurden somit einige Stellen echt frustig (vor allem zum Ende hin). So wie das Spiel aktuell ist habe ich aber keine Lust mehr mir die Stadt abseits von der wirren Kampagne anzuschauen.

----------------------------------ПЛЮСЫ:
1.Графика. Всегда хотел пиксельную игру с открытым миром.
НУ ГТА 1 это и так понятно, а тут еще и наркоманский сюжетище!
2. НАркомания. Помимо основного сюжета, который по сути уже и так
наркоманский, во время игры может случится невооброзимое, и
наркомания становится всё больше и больше...
3. ГЕЙМПАД! Вот это важная вещь! Мой старый геймпад для 
PC и PS2. Сначала он определил как обычный стандартный геймпад
для XBOX  и в интерфейсе клавиши буквами высвечивались.
Потом уже определил PS2 и всё супер робит!
4. УПРАВЛЕНИЕ. Удобное)
5. МУЗЫКА. Музыка шикардеющая! Так же как и в ЖТА
можно менять музыку в радио.
6. Огромный мир. Для такой игры мир огромен, это точно!
7. Интерфейс. В настройках меню можно изменить игру под себя,
в том числе и графон.

1.Короткий сюжетик (но это не страшно, т.к. есть аркадный режим, и свободный)
2. Нету русского языка. Хоть и я знаю английский, но тамиспользуется
нецензурная и разговорная брань.

Doc Choc and that time traveling-phonebooth are just references to Doc Brown from Back to the Future and Bill & Ted's Phonebooth.

80’s and 90’s references are amusing. 
Free roam gameplay is really fun. 
Challenges and sprees are also great (although, getting gold in some of these is too hard).
I absolutely love the retro style. 

However, there are many issues that really drag this game down:

The final boss, I gave up. I’m not going back. The last few levels were horribly designed, and were simply not fun. 
TMNT sewer levels were bad then, and RCR’s reiteration is also bad. 
With regard to the story, don’t ask why, it’s not supposed to make sense. Why should I care about what’s going on, if the game is constantly telling me not to care. 

Performance: no issues playing on PC or through the steam link. Throughout my gameplay I used an XB1 controller, and I did not encounter any issues.

Esta lleno de referencias a otros juegos y ademas tiene muchos minijuegos con personajes de otros juegos (ej: Super meat boy).
El juego es corto, a mi me ha durado 8 horas consiguiendo 17/20 logros, pero es bueno que sea corto porque así no lo aburres, ademas no te hace ir de una parte a otra del mapa, sino que incluso en una misión te dicen:

-Ves allí
-Pero si eso esta al quinto pino!
-Es verdad, voy a llevarte con un tornado.

Y punto, aparece un tornado y te lleva en un segundo(el tornado es de super mario xD).

No es un juego difícil para nada, es la dificultad moderada exacta para que te diviertas, la historia pase a un ritmo adecuado y no te estreses al jugar.

Es un juego que es de los que valen la pena probarlos. El precio en oferta seguro que es aceptable, pero eso ya de pende de cada uno.

[b]Title: Retro City Rampage™ DX
Genre: Action, Adventure, Indie, Racing
Developer: Vblank Entertainment, Inc. 
Publisher: Vblank Entertainment, Inc.	
Release Date: 11 Nov, 2014[/b]

[h1]Overview[/h1]
This has to be one of my favourite 8-bit games on steam. So what is this game exactly? Well it's exactly what it says it is. A 8-bit open world with a nostalgia feel to it, it really has a nice feel to the game. If Grand Theft Auto where made into a 8-bit graphic, with top down perspective, and some inapropriate humour then this is what you would expect from this game.

[h1]Game Play[/h1]
I really wasn't expecting this game to be as fun as it was. Although I have a few faults with the game play sid eof this game, overall it's rather impressive. As you would expect in any open world game there are quite a few missions to get through, and then there are side missions that may help you in  the actual missions later on. Some of the side missions are rather quite difficult, and the way that some of them are set out aren't really all that fun to play. After doing a few side missions I kind of just went on with the main story and left them out. They might've helped me in the main missions but I don't really think it would of all that much. As for the main missions, some of them where brutally difficult for me. The final boss wasn't really all what I thought it would be, moving from side to side and dodging whatevere that guy was shooting at you. I did rage a few times but beat it in the end. On a positive note, some of the missions where quite funny and simply just what  guy would do to waste time, for example there was a mission to waste time. So you get a hover suit and just bash people on the head instead of waiting. The characters where a little dull and boring, and the story really isn't ll that much, I basically knew what was going on almost all the time without the game telling me what to do. Get a sevral items for the [spoiler]Time Machine[/spoiler] and then get back. Not really all that fun but kept me entertained with the decent missions to keep me playing. The game took me about 9 hours to complete, I still sometimes go on it just to run people over in a car and mess around.
[b]Score (Out Of 10): 7 - Some difficult missions and a dull story, but some really fun missions to play, general fun messing about in the overworld and some funny humour.[/b]

[h1]Graphics/art style[/h1]
The game (if you haven't already noticed) has a 8-bit styled graphic to it which really works well with everything that happens in the game. Everything looks like you would be able to play it in a old school arcade machine. Although some of the animations are a little lazy, for example the cars don't really have any wheel animation on the ground. This can sometimes make it look like everything is just moving across the road with the wheels not running across the road. I'm not really sure what you could've done to solve that but it was kind of annoying  to see that sometimes for me. Other than that nothing else to complain about the game graphics wise.
[b]Score (Out Of 10): 9 - Really nice 8-bit graphics, but some lazy animations here and there.[/b]

[h1]Music & Sound[/h1]
The music and sound for this game where both really good. The sounds for certain things weren't at all generic and really fit well with the 8-bit style of the game, the music also fits well with certain scenarios in the game. Whether you're killing a bunch of robots in a tower or just chilling along the road smashing everything in your path! The game really sets the music well.
[b]Score (Out Of 10): 10 - Some really fitting music and no generic sound effects throughout the game[/b]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This is probably one of my favourite 8-bit games on steam. With it's decent overworld map to mess about in, the music and sounds along with the awesome 8-bit graphics make it all feel like a pretty solid game. Do be prepaired though for some difficult missions that you might come across in the game that might leave you playing it for more than you want to. But some great humour and game play implemented into this game.

Developed by one man, which is cool admittedly, it's basically a Parody of both GTA and other games released throughout the years, which is its only saving grace. The parodies are funny! Everything from Duke Nukem to TMNT to Back To The Future to even Jean-Claude Van Damne are parodied and each one managed to get either a chuckle or a nice laugh from me at times. But that's the games only saving grace

The rest of the game is clunky, monotonous, and down right boring. It's main issue is that it plays its trap card too early with it's tutorial mission. After that, the game just copies itself to the point where even the jokes are boring. What hampers the game even more are the controls. Now I hate saying that the controls can ruin any game (I'm able to look past bad controls if the game is fun), but WOW! These controls are both bad and clunky! Not only is it a pain to move and aim, but the driving is what REALLY kills the game. I get the point that it's supposed to be emulating the NES in terms of gameplay, but come on! Even the driving games on NES had better controls then this clunker! When it comes to the shooting, it's even worse. There is supposed to be a lock on mechanic, but it's one of the worst ones I dealt with. Whenever you are shooting, you lock on to any near by targets and all your shots go there. The issue is that you STAY locked on when you are shooting and you can't freely aim at other targets without ceasing your fire and then firing again. This is a major hindrance when you are in gun fights when are you want to do is aim at another target but you keep targeting other stuff that AREN'T YOUR TARGETS!

Sadly, I can not recommend this game what so ever. Not only does it fail in trying to be a good GTA clone, but it sadly fails in being a parody at times. It does make me mad though...when I first got this game, I loved it. But now, the more I play it, the less I love it and the more I get frustrated with it. Save your cash and skip this game.

Humor-wise, it looks like it has been written by a 9 years old, or a bunch of drunken nerds: citations, memes and other stuff *everywhere*, and without style. The authors tried the hardest to stack tons and tons of innuendo, winking at this brand, that superhero, etc, but they did it so just throwing stuff around wihout thought or respite.

There is no single line of text that's not a reference to something (a videogames trope, TV, other titles: you name it) and in the end, the result is just a confusing, boring mess. It's like hearing Jon Stewart in fast forward, without pauses between the jokes to enjoy them. And if you think it's cool, think again.

Same problem goes with sory and rithm: the missions are rushed and everything seems to go way to fast. After the first 10 minutes you already start skiping dialogues (it's the usual bunch of so-so puns, random objectives, etc, so why care?) and after half an hour you find yourself in a grand theft auto city, but wihout much interest in exploring or doing much.

The story jumps from one place to the other without a logic, and the settings are good looking, but logically inconsistent: city -> military base (so far so good) -> underground hi-tech complex (ehm...) -> obstacles run in the same base (wtf?) ).

So while this is not a great game, I can't help but give it thumbs up because I honestly had a good time for the 6 hours it took me to finish. There is enough variety and unexpected challenges at every turn to keep you interested, and the whole look and feel is rather authentic.

¿Cómo comenzar el análisis de un juego premeditadamente anacrónico y cuya base argumental no sigue ninguno de los dictados del sentido común? Supongo que, simplemente, puede decirse que Retro City Rampage (RCR) se apoya en el quizá más importante pilar de la ""escena indie"": la libertad creativa.

RCR no es sino un popurrí de géneros y situaciones recopilados de aquí y de allí para crear un producto que, al mismo tiempo que homenajea una época y su forma de hacer videojuegos, satisface la cantidad mínima recomendada anual de nostalgia de sus potenciales compradores/jugadores. No se trata de que intente ganarnos con la profundidad de su trama o de su jugabilidad, sino que lo intenta (y lo consigue por el mero hecho de captar nuestra nostálgica atención) yendo directo al grano al presentarnos y ponernos en bandeja situaciones, referencias y cameos ochentero-noventeros de películas, series, videojuegos, etc., a cada cual más surrealista y carente de cualquier tipo de conexión con la anterior.

Obviamente, partiendo de tal premisa, poco o nada puede aportar una trama que es una desconexión absoluta en sí misma. Como puede entenderse, el argumento es una excusa para la aparición de ""retroreferencias"", desarrollándose a lo largo del juego a través de infinitud de acontecimientos, los cuales es mejor que vayamos completando y olvidando para poder pasar inmediatamente (y recalco INMEDIATAMENTE porque RCR no nos concederá tregua alguna) al siguiente en cuestión sin buscarle demasiado sentido al orden de aparición de unos u otros. No obstante, este aspecto aparentemente negativo no lo es cuando sabemos que no se pretende otra cosa que presentarnos un mundo loco, frenético y carente de sentido excepto para ahondar en los recovecos más oscuros de nuestra memoria, aspecto que, de sobra, consigue. 

Gráficamente tampoco pierde el tiempo, presentándonos un mundo de 8 bits que, al igual que ocurre con las referencias argumentales, encantará a los amantes de los videojuegos retro por haber crecido con ellos. Una vez más, ahora de forma visual, RCR apela directamente a la nostalgia del jugador. Así, personajes, escenarios y efectos lucen un aspecto pixelado propio de la era inicial de los videojuegos pero con un acabado completamente actual más acorde con los estándares de la alta definición. El diseño es igualmente retro y colorista, basándose muchas veces en el de las propias fuentes a las que hace referencia, en este caso, el de la época dorada de los videojuegos. También es algo a destacar el hecho de que no sólo el estilo de 8 bits intenta llevarnos a una epoca pasada y ¿mejor?, sino que el nivel de detalle alcanzado en cuanto a diseño nostálgico se refiere llega hasta a haber definido toda una serie de filtros de pantalla que emulan los ordenadores, consolas y recreativas clásicas (¡incluso una emulación 3D completamente funcional de la Virtual Boy!) y distintas perspectivas de visión según la situación: 2D cenital, 2D lateral y 3D.

El sonido no podía sino apoyar el estilo general del juego, apostando por melodías y efectos retro, respectivamente igual de pegadizas y onomatopéyicos que lo eran los originales en su época. No se trata de un aspecto a destacar, sino que se limita a cumplir su función de apoyo al resto de aspectos retro de RCR o, incluso a veces, se magnifica para destacar la exageración efectista, bien por falta de medios o por dejadez, propia de los primeros videojuegos.

Por último, donde también destaca RCR es en su jugabilidad y diseño de niveles. A pesar de ser un juego premeditadamente retro, el hecho de que se haya optado por el tan de actualidad esquema de mundo abierto y por un desarrollo basado en fragmentos de ""gameplay"" que son casi minijuegos de todo tipo de géneros, hace que el resultado general sea completamente disfrutable en la actualidad y nos aleje de la sensación de estar jugando a algo desfasado. El control, pese a ser un tanto duro y ortopédico al principio (quién sabe si tal vez también de manera premeditada), se tornará sencillo tras unos cuantos intentos, adaptándose bien tanto a los momentos en los que la vista es cenital, como a los de desarrollo lateral o en tres dimensiones. Es esta misma variedad de estilos gráficos la que, junto con la variedad de situaciones, hace que cada momento sea distinto del anterior y que, gracias a la sucesión frenética de los mismos, la jugabilidad sea igualmente variada y nunca deje momentos para el aburrimiento.

Uno de los aspectos negativos de RCR es su corta duración, que se suple en parte gracias a los extras y, aunque suene a consuelo, puede justificarse porque un alargamiento de la misma sólo provocaría una sobresaturación innecesaria de nuestra capacidad de asimilar acontecimientos. También la traducción al castellano deja que desear en determinados momentos, pero este es un aspecto sobre el que tal vez no proceda opinar puesto que es posible que, una vez más, se hayan introducido errores de manera premeditada, emulando lo común que este hecho era en la época de los videojuegos a los que RCR hace referencia. Eso sí, la versión original en inglés no tiene estos errores de traducción, pero claro, siempre puede decirse que en aquella época tampoco existían o no eran tan comunes como en el caso del castellano.

En resumen, RCR es un juego que juega, valga la redundancia, con la nostalgia del público al que principalmente se dirige y que, en concreto, creció con la TV de la década de los ochenta y principios de los noventa, aportando una perspectiva nueva a géneros de todo tipo y condición de una época que, para aquellos, siempre será la época dorada de los videojuegos.

Again, most of the game is a cakewalk, you can ease through it with no effort.  Then you get to the last 10 levels or so (out of 64) and the game just becomes a bull shit sandwich.  The dam level of TMNT, for example, is considered one of the worst of the NES era.  So of course this game makes you do it twice.

He has a specific pattern, but he ""cheats"" in that sometimes his missles go where you are going to be, not were you were when he fired them.  Sometimes, but not always.

more renames (retro city rampage, retro city rampage DX, you know renameing is good for anyone hehe)
less cost ($9.99 steam store vs $14.99 on playstation store at the time of preorder on play station store)

It's like a 16 bit version of GTA. You can drive cars, shoot people, hit wit' a bat and it has hours of exploration that will have you playing for a long time. I beat the game and still think about playing. Also, in my opinion the mini games are quite interesting. The story is entertaining and the missions are fun to go on so that you can increase your skill or just have fun.

CONS: After you beat the game the rush of blowing stuff up and regular activities may fade. (Like mini games and missions). Some stages may provide little to no challenge for some, but don't misunderstand me, if you are human, you are bound to make mistakes that will cost you your life.

INCONCLUSION: Retro City Rampage DX is a great game weather on sale or not. This game is for sadists that like breaking the rules and having fun. This game isn't for you if you want a long story.

Множество отсылок на каждому шагу, а сюжет буквально состоит из стебок на соответствующую тему. Расписывать или упоминать их нет смысла - слишком уж много всего этого веселья в RCR. 

DX-издание вроде как немного навело порядок в балансе. Позже, что примечательно, вышли версии игры для Windows 3.1 и MS-Dos. Последняя работает отлично - прошел RCR:DX на DOSBox (потому не следует смотреть на время в Стиме). Жаль, только, что ачивменты у каждой версии свои.

В распоряжении игрока небольшой, но забитый за отказа всякими мелочами город, и куча оружия для того, чтобы сеять хаос. А еще очень забавная сюжетка и большой набор испытаний и состязаний, для победы в которых нужна известная доля ловкости. Управление простенькое, а геймплей очень разнообразный. И в трубы прыгать будете, и на танке кататься, и мечом рубить. Игра очень увлекает. Благо, она не слишком длинная - за пару-тройку дней сюжетку реально пробежать, не особенно напрягаясь.

- Sometimes funny.
- Lots of other game references, so it's fun to see what you can remember.
- Very satisfying to run over lots of pedestrians with a combo chain.
- Variating missions.

Cons:
- God awful controls especially when you try to aim. If you want to use a mouse like a normal person, then you still shoot fews seconds after releasing the buttons also if you are moving, you will be still moving in the same direction you started to move while shooting. Dunno how they screwed up like this.
- Cops who always try to run over you are going to get on your nerves really quickly. It's possible to evade them, but still very annoying,
- Challenges... Oh god... Some are really fun and interesting but there is this stupid thing when devs without thinking or trying themselves give a challenge with idiotic goals. For example sweat bomber challenge. It is a very fun challenge where you are just an exploding person who can propel himself with exploding and travel quickly. Goal for a golden medal - destroy 50 cars in 60s. You have to destroy 1 car every 1.2s. Sounds logical? Especially when cars appear based on rng? Really? 47 cars is my cap. Always at the last 5s cars disappear. It is not hard to destroy those cars, there are not enough cars even when you are flying non-stop.
- Last mission... I was going to give this game a 6-7 out of 10 score but after that mission I am sticking with 4/10. Not going to spoil what stupidity went on there but Jesus... Now every time I remember this game, I want to puke. Yay.

Conclusion:

The player takes the roll of a character name Player who resembles a greaser ‘cool kid’ from its said zone of reference. With heavy influence from the [i]Destructoid[/i] crew (back when Jim Sterling was involved), this game features an abundance of weapon types, game and player modifications, and humorous themes.

Here are just a few reasons to give this game a try:

Open World - Similar to the first two [i]Grand Theft Auto[/i] titles, [i]Retro City Rampage DX[/i] utilizes a top-down open-world approach, which permits the exploration of the vast overworld on foot or with one of the game’s many unique vehicles. Within this sandbox are varying side missions, shops, secrets (featured later), a primary story arch, and non-player characters which stride throughout the area with their own agendas. Seeing as though the Player can wreak havoc in many different ways with both a large inventory of weapons and objects as well as utilizing vehicle collisions, police pursue the same principles as they would in early [i]Grand Theft Auto[/i] titles: kill the Player. Apart from this perspective, the actual missions within the world are quite enjoyable; the primary quest-line advances the story and side quests typically give the Player access to unique equipment, vehicles, and services.

Free Roaming Mode - When the Player wishes to experience the sandbox action to [i]Retro City Rampage DX[/i] without having to focus on missions appearing on the mini-map and the loss of money as a death penalty, Free Roaming mode is always available from the Main Menu. Though some of the features are not accessible as they would be through the main game-such as completing various missions-, Free Roam spawns the Player with nearly every weapon available and practically pats you on the head while saying, “Go have fun!” There is absolutely not penalty for death-with a life tracker humorously tracing the Player’s deaths in the negatives-but the same overworld ‘police chase you if you do something bad’ theme still applies.

Humor - [i]Retro City Rampage DX[/i] features references mostly from 1980s popular culture such as [i]Yoshi[/i] from the [i]Super Mario Brothers[/i] and pop icon Michael Jackson, and presents these fairly bluntly throughout the territory. One instance would be a useable Warp Pipe-originally seen in the [i]Super Mario Brothers[/i] franchise-which takes the Player to a run-down sewer system that presents themes from other titles such as [i]Pitfall[/i]. Somewhat subtle remark placements, however, can be viewed in the game, though it does help to know or have heard of at least some icons from the 1980s to understand these.

Secrets - I prefer to allow Players to delve into this item on their own terms, but [i]Retro City Rampage DX[/i] retains its 1980s gaming feel by packing secrets all over the map, with both simple and complex means in which to attain and discover them. There is an array of enjoyable hidden content within this game, from unlockable Player skins to special objects. Keep an eye out! My word of advice: write down those codes; you will know what I mean.

TL:DR - Though simple, [i]Retro City Rampage DX[/i] is a highly enjoyable title that melds traditional themes with a ton of awesome gameplay mechanics. I do apologize for not writing much about this game in comparison to other titles, but I must admit that this one is one of my favorites regardless. I highly recommend giving this game a try; this is not a high-budget AA title, but its charm alone is what makes this game so engaging, with gameplay that entices the Player to continue the trek. Thanks for reading.

GTA 1 feeling gepaart mit so ziemlich allen Dingen, welche Kinder der 80er & 90er in der heutigen Zeit vermissen. Wer alt genug ist wird durch die Bank weg ständig grinsen und lächeln müssen und dadurch automatisch an ""die gute alte Zeit"" denken :D
Auch aus aktueller Zeit lassen sich Hier und Da paar Anspielungen finden (Batman Dark Knight). Aber ""die Kids von Heute"" werden unter Umständen mit einigen Anspielungen nix anfangen können... macht aber nix. Das Spiel ist trotzdem super für zwischendurch auch wenn es stückweit von dem Wissen um bestimmte Anspielungen lebt.

Detto questo, passiamo alla recensione.
Retro City Rampage DX si può paragonare ad un GTA in 8-bit, perchè non solo è un open-world, ma anche di riferimenti alla cultura pop degli anni 80 e 90. Impersoneremo semplicemente il Giocatore che insieme a Doc Choc vanno alla caccia dei pezzi per una macchina del tempo... la storia è ricca di colpi di scena ed anche di cameo.
La grafica è molto bella, perchè si ispira agli 8-bit e come se non bastasse la Vblank Enterteinament ha realizzato una vera versione per MS-DOS di RCR chiamata appunto Retro City Rampage 486 Edition, per dimostrare che realizzare un open-world in una console 8-bit fosse possibile (anche perchè è inclusa la versione ROM Prototipo 100% hardware accurato 8-bit). Il sonoro è pazzesco ed è in puro stile 8-bit, ovvero in chiptune, con le stazioni radio che le adoreremo alla follia. Per il gameplay (esattamente quando l'ho detto all'inizio), è GTA, ma fatto in 8-bit. Possiamo rubare le auto, prendere armi, giocare a tre minigiochi bellissimi e particolari, con le guest star tra cui Meat Boy e CommanderVideo che le potete usare alla modalità libera, potete andare al casinò, scommettere sui cavalli (mi ricorda molto GTA San Andreas), e altro ancora. I riferimenti ne potete trovare a iosa, e in alcuni casi, riderete i gusto.
Posso dire che se amate o meno il genere, provatelo e non ve ne pentirete.",1438128057,1438128057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Before they were very hard to see. Its also got a lot of 80's references inside the game that I really enjoy. A fun and so far easy game to enjoy.

Ok so I got to the very end boss... The few levels before meeting the head boss were not up to the level of play I had expected thru the entire game sadly. Most are one hit kill=deaths. Their is an underwater where if you touch a gear you insta killed. Not to be out done on this insta kill. Also just a side note. I am tired of indie developers including insta kills in their games. TIRED OF THIS TREND. 

Their is a mini boss fight inside of a building with gears and some chicks who have rockets that will push you into being insta killed. Then you have the mini boss who can also insta kill you. Sigh.

I did manage to beat the mini boss. So then we come to the last boss. Ugh. Sigh. Head pounding on desk at this point. Your a car with machine guns. This is fine. Why do I have to get carpal tunnel syndrome hitting the fire button for every single shot??????? Thats right no continous fire button you have to press it for each and every shot. Ugh again and of course its not just and the boss on a road. Oh no its you and the boss and other cars and exploding canisters just for more fun. You get 5 chances however pressing the button each and every time to fire( the boss has a life bar that is almost as long as my arm) will cause your to develop carpal syndrome.

I will say I enjoyed the game till the very end levels that still have me scratching my head over these insta kill levels. So their you have it. Is it worth your time? I would say it depends on how much it costs. I would say for the $10 dollars asking price. NO. Its way to expensive for the game price.

[h1]Geschichte[/h1]
Die Geschichte beginnt damit, dass ihr als Hauptprotagonist einen Wagen entführt und ihr vor der Polizei verfolgt werdet. Nachdem ihr in eine täuschend echte Telefonzelle, die sich dann als Zeitmaschine entpuppt, hineingeht, werdet ihr in die 80er befördert und trifft auf den Doc. Dieser nimmt euch gelassen bei sich auf und versucht euch dann zu helfen in eure Zeit zurückzukehren, indem er euch ab und an um Erledigungen bittet. Dabei gerät ihr in eine weitaus größere Sache als nur nach Hause in die eigene Zeit zurückzukommen.

[h1]Das Gameplay[/h1]
Alle, die schon GTA gespielt haben, werden sich schnell mit dem Spiel vertraut machen: Schnell Geld machen, viele viele Leute den Garaus machen und Zerstörungen am laufenden Band. Dabei ist das Spiel mit etlichen Anspielungen, Witzen und Klischees bestückt und man wird etliche Male aufgrund der Dialogen schmunzeln, aber euch auch an den Kopf fassen und es einfach nur stumpf finden, worüber gesprochen wird. Das Spiel bietet eine sehr breite Palette an Aufgaben, Dingen, die ihr außerhalb eurer Missionen machen könnt wie etwa Herausforderungen/Challenges und kleineren Minispielen, die ihr während eures Spiellaufes freischalten könnt. Waffen gibt es in Hülle und Fülle und euren Charakter könnt ihr auch individuell gestalten (etwa den Haarschnitt ändern zum Beispiel). Der Schwierigkeitsgrad hat eine schöne Steigerungskurve vom Anfang bis zum Ende, so wird man letztlich nicht zu sehr über- oder unterfordert werden. Außerdem könnt ihr mit verschiedenen Upgrades euch in einen fliegenden Waschbär verwandeln, eine Referenz aus Super Mario Bros. 3.

[h1]Das Design[/h1]
Jeder, der Retrospiele und 8-Bit Stil mag wird sich in das Spiel verlieben. Das Spiel ist bunt und sehr detailreich gemacht worden und Nostalgier werden ihre Freude daran finden, insbesondere wenn sie den Grafikfilter entdecken: Dieser lässt sowohl den äußeren Rand als auch das Spiel grafisch an den jeweiligen Konsolen der damaligen Zeit wie dem C64 oder dem NES anpassen.

[h1]Die Musik[/h1]
Die Musik wurde von den drei Herren virt, Freaky DNA and Norrin Radd komponiert und sind sowohl funky, als auch enspannend, wenn man mal eben auf der Straße einen Amoklauf begeht und wie ein Berserker mit dem Raketenwerfer auf Ziele schießt. Auf jeden Fall: Großes Kompliment an die Komponisten, die auch die Soundeffekte gemacht haben.

[h1]Zusätzliches[/h1]
Das Spiel bietet noch ein paar Achievements, die euch im Spiel nochmal Dinge freischalten lassen und sonst ist das Spiel sehr frei, was ihr mit eurer Zeit da anstellt. Ihr werdet trotz Allem nicht drumherum kommen, mindestens eine Stunde lang wie ein Irrer durch die Straßen zu rasen, nur um euch euren Hungerlohn zu sichern. Das Spiel kommt regelmäßig als Angebot rein, ist ansonsten für 8,99 € erhältlich. Trotz Allem ist das ein recht guter Preis. Wer aber trotzdem den Sparfuchs rauslassen möchte, wartet einfach bis es mal für -66% bis -80% reinkommt.

[h1]Persönliche Meinung[/h1]
Anfangs hat mich das Spiel nicht sonderlich gereizt, erst dann mit dem DX-Update wurde das Spiel nennenswert spielbar und auch interessant. Besonders die Challenges geben den Reiz, länger zu spielen und es auch länger zu versuchen. Von der Geschichte ist es jetzt nicht so großartig besonders, aber wem interessiert Geschichte schon bei einem GTA-like Spiel?

Retro City Rampage is a pretty straight forward title. It's retro, takes place in a city, and you rampage. This is the game, a majority of the game. Visually, the game hits the mark spot on, colors and and sound design truly do evoke the right feeling.

The developer of this game has shown what's the outcome of years of hard work, and no doubt the outcome is good! This game is basically GTA in retro/pixel graphics. 

You get everything you experience in the GTA games in addition to a whole new level of craziness (Not Saints Row The Third crazy, but close enough), with lots of nostalgia from other 8-bit arcade games like Duck Hunt for example. 

The gameplay is fun as hell and causing chaos is actually better than the older top-down GTA games! Being an open world action game, do expect lots of variety from it, along with some mini games that really makes this game a bang for the buck. 

However, the game does get repetitive when it comes to combat. You'll actually find it to be like an arcade game which is precisely what it's intended to be.

Junta en si humor absurdo con una mezcla de parodias tanto a series de televisión como juegos.
Dejando de lado las rayas que aparecen en la pantalla por problemas de la sincronización vertical el juego entra muy bien y ya por el precio que tiene en si incluso es una ganga muy buena.
Las misiones cada una son unicas y muy muy divertidas, sin contar que en secundarias hay una barbaridad.

+ Good old school style gameplay
+ Excellent Soundtrack
+ Lots off funny moments
+ Tons of retro easter eggs including the cardboard box trick.
+ Surprising number of options given its art style.
+ Excellent Controller support allowing you to remap everything to suit your play style.

Cons
+ Difficult missions

The game is pretty well made, anyone who has grown up in the late 80's and early 90's will love this game. There's a lot to enjoy here, and its well polished.

The only real set back is the difficulty of the game, it tends to spike quite early in the game, I'd have liked to see different difficulty options included.

Graphics:
Retro fans will drool over the 8-bit look of the game, which is nice to look at.  Lots of vibrant colors and detailed areas to enjoy.  And the cutscenes are well drawn and fit the feel of the game.  Nothing much to complain about here.

Sound:
8-bit sounds all the way!  From the sirens and gunsfire to the music, it's all 8-bit bliss.  Much of the music is also nice to listen to, but you have the option to shut it off it it's not your thing.  The game also has options for different filters and boarders to make it feel like you're playing it on an old tv back in the day, scanlines and all.  Some of the colors filters, while nice options, can hurt the eyes after a bit.

Control:
You can use keyboard/mouse or controller, but controller is HIGHLY reccomended.  Controls are a bit of an issue, as the default keybinds feel weird and rebinding them is dificult.  Once you get past that though, the game plays fine and control is responsive.

Gameplay:
This games, despite the cartoony look, retro graphics, and hilarious story, is still a GTA clone at heart.   You can mug people on the strees, collect weapons and carjack people.  There are paint shops and pickups to lose the heat, and shops to buy skins and weapons.  But you also get a few tricks that GTA doesn't, like speed boots, the ability to jump on enemies, add weapons to your cars, and even a time machine!  The wackiness really sets this game apart from GTA!  The story is also a full on omage to old retro games!  The game's missions doubly so!  You even have to go visit an imfamous dam from a certain turtles game!  The only issue I have is that some of the missions are QUITE long and due to random difficulty spikes, will often take more than an hour to complete, and repsawns during the mission are unforgiving.  I have ragequitted a few times because of this.  Still, this fact does not limit the overall fun factor of the game.

The game is very generous with checkpoints so dying is almost never that big of a deal.  Aside from the main story there are 14 ""sprees"" and 23 ""second rate sprees"".  The sprees involve trying to get a high score while under various effects such as drunkeness, invulnerablity, explosive sweat, normal stuff.  There is one second rate spree for each weapon and they just involve killing as many people with that weapon as possible.

Retro-graphics with chip-tunes, all pixeled out. Its a fun idea and the references are all great. It is chalk full of homages to all the greats (and not so greats ;)). There is obviously alot of love put into this game with constant updates, since I have owned it anyways. If you are into it, there is also several game modes that will get you plenty of hours.

One problem for me, and why I ultimately do not recommend it, is the controls. I mainly play with an X360 Wireless. Driving is obnoxious - its the style where 'up' on the controller = 'straight' regardless of your current orientation. It also forces you to map your own controller instead of recommending a default config. I mean the devs should find a tried-and-true setup and just recommend that (they surely can recommend something from all the time they spend playing it).

Second problem is the core gameplay. After you strip away all the clever references, you are left with some really bare-bones game mechanics that requires little skill or learning, and is mostly short little epidsodes that you plow through with little grace. They certainly try to have a strategy angle, but I don't think it matters too much. Maybe it does if you are trying to get top scores or something, I cannot speak for that.

What can I say? I love this game. I can’t even write from an objective standpoint here to make an honest and fair review with this one. I’ve spent over 20 hours with this game here on steam, gotten every achievement- and even then- I didn’t quit. I took the time to Gold Medal all the optional missions too. I seriously can’t get enough. I tried for hours to put my name up on the leaderboards. I’m in the top 20 for lots of the missions and I’m quite proud of that. But enough about me.

Since I can’t really come at this from an unbiased angle I’ll just try to explain what’s it like. It's a retro-inspired Grand Theft Auto-esque homage to everything that was popular before I was born- and I can definitely respect that. I grew up watching movies and playing the games of the 80s- even though I was born in '95- just because of the way my parents were. It’s a top down shooter in some ways- a bit like Smash T.V. (a game which is actually referenced in a rather obvious level) The game is indeed open world- and has the very same mission based structure you’d come to expect from an open world experience. The cars in it drive in a couple different ways. One is akin to an RC car (a bit like R.C. Pro-A.M) and the other is one of those “Drive in the direction you press” things. Oddly- I usually prefer the latter- but mostly because I find it more precise. The story is goofy and out there- but fitting for the game. And there’s even a few cameos of a few other popular indie games.

This is the kind of game that you might be skeptical of when you see it in action- but when you actually play it you’ll see what makes it appealing- surely. Whether or not you’ll like it is entirely subjective in this case- but if you have an interest in retro games or games that resemble the kind of gameplay you find in Grand Theft Auto- you’ll at the very least get a kick out of it. If you grew up in the 80’s with the games and movies of that decade- I’d almost universally recommend it.

I can’t imagine a situation where someone will buy this game and feel entirely disappointed. I’d imagine you’d want to pick it up during a sale- as with most things on steam- but I feel the game is entirely worth the full price. Especially if you want to support the developer- who’s a pretty awesome guy by the way.

Rest of review:

Retro City Rampage is hilarious.  It has so many pop references around every corner that I can't help but laugh at the cameos from Paperboy, Sonic, Mario, Ninja Turtles, Bill And Ted, Back To The Future and so on.  It also makes light of the game development process by giving the player a ""ROM City Rampage"" prototype version of itself inside the player character's room.  The game relies on its humor and does a good job of keeping me entertained.

The controls are a different matter all together.  For starters, you're not given controller support, even though the game's store page and the game itself both say you should be able to use a controller.  I was tempted to map the controls with XPadder, but I didn't feel like going through the trouble of that.  Regardless, the default keyboard control scheme is not very comfortable, and I found the mouse useless.  Aiming at enemies without stepping into bullets was difficult because I could not control where I was looking while I was moving.  The auto-aim system doesn't work well, and I can't auto-aim at everything.  Overall, the game is frustrating to play because of the control scheme.

If you don't mind a little frustration and are looking for a funny 2D RPG shooter, Retro City Rampage should be your first choice.",1420145619,1420145619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

In fact the whole game is full of references everywhere , some obvious , some more obscure which will only make sence if you have knowledge or even better experienced the shows or games they are making fun of.

The graphics are over the top retro 8'bits and many gameplay mechanics reminds me of the games of that era, packed in a GTA aspirated but of course over the top game-frame. The creator of this game used a lot of time to give you the feeling of playing those antiquated systems . 

There are also many funny commentaries of the state of gaming both practical and moral which can even apply today. At one point the hero of the game regret one of his past transgressions, the other character listening to the ""player"" (yes the player's name in the game is ""player"", another pun) comments ironically that he should maybe stop routinely running over and killing innocent bystander while he is at it.

This is a funny comment on heroes in games (and medias generally) sometimes committing large scale genocide in order to ""save the day"".

The gameplay is actually ok and refreshingly diverse, but it's obvious the creator prioritized putting references and puns in almost every frames of the game. As a result, the game itself might feel too short and small, the city especially could have been a tad larger,  and I can understand the criticism. I still would recommend the game for the well done retro feeling , funny puns , especially but not only if you grew up in the 80's and 90's. 

It's not very expensive to begin with but if you get a discount at some sales, it's really worth it as long as you have some interest in game culture and ready for a game that doesn't take itself very seriously.

It isn't however, an NES game (just to make that clear)! It is a spoof of every game possible and it does a good job of synthesizing it together. Just get ready for both good and bad (lame) jokes.

The [b]storyline[/b] follows a person named ""The Player"" in which he is essentially a thug for hire. A bank heist goes wrong and The Player ends up stealing a time machine which flings him years forward. Doc Choc (another spinoff of a well known persona) comes in to help The Player recover pieces of the machine to get him back to where he belongs.The [b]gameplay[/b] is like the first version of GTA. You are able to move in 9 directions and shoot relatively to your position. Weapons are in abundance and in variety from golf clubs to shotguns to the bionic commando arm. Why is there? Why not... why not. There will be situations where you will need specific weapons to accomplish certain tasks. I prefer to use the shotgun over automatics when it comes to being overwhelmed by a lot of characters. The player can choose to free-roam the city or do main missions or side-quests. The game is really over-the-top with everything it does and isn't scared to loosely knock off and ridicule other games. 

Any car (or bicycle or motorcycle) can be stolen. Some cars can be modified to be given a jet engine at the back or some kind of armaments. The more you progress in the game, more modifiers become available. If you do happen to break the law, cops will chase you if you break but it isn't as tedious as the GTA series. To get the police off your back, the player needs to find a special police token that will rid them of their wanted level. This token appears randomly in areas or can be dropped by eliminating a certain amount of police forces. In addition to modding cars, the player may mod themselves as they please. Again, progressing through the story will unlock more styles. There isn't much the player can change but hair is definitely one of them as cut-scenes will show ""The Players"" face. Throughout the game, there are power-ups that can be picked up to give the Player some neat abilities. These abilities can come in the form of speed or in some obscene form such as a Super Mario cape allowing your character to fly.

The [b]graphics[/b] are quite basic and provide basic 8-bit fun. If graphics are imperative to you, this might bug you. Although the graphics are simplistic, it seems that the smallest of details were paid attention to. Sure, it is a simple color with a simple outline but the thought of including as much as one can is appreciated. The [b]sounds[/b] follow a NES scheme. The music station can be changed (there are about 10 stations to choose from) and the sounds are appropriate for the setting. Don't expect to hear triple A explosions but you'll definitely hear everything going on in the game.

I like this game. I personally bought it on it's lowest sale price and do find the price slightly steep. If you do like this though it might be worth the purchase for you. It's good, it entertains, but doesn't try to attempt to break away from traditional gaming. I would have loved to see the game take a bit more risks with it's gameplay.

Retro City Rampage está muito longe de ser um jogo ruim, na verdade. Os visuais são incríveis, e as missões até que são divertidas. Mas, pra você ter uma ideia do que eu estou falando, acho melhor dividir tudo em prós e contras.

PRÓS:
+Visuais muito bonitos, que podem ser customizados em vários esquemas de cor
+Trilha sonora variada no melhor estilo 8-bits
+As missões são divertidas se jogadas aqui e ali
+Sair atirando em policiais e atropelar pedestres também é divertido
+Toneladas de coisas para explorar na cidade de Theftropolis
+Alguns power-ups são legais
+Algumas referências são bem pensadas e engraçadas

CONTRAS:
-O jogo é incrivelmente repetitivo, e não só pode como vai se tornar cansativo
-Mesmo no modo free roam: atirar em policiais e atropelar pedestres é legal, mas tem uma hora que perde a graça (e pode ser que seja antes do que você pensa)
-A maioria das referências é jogada de qualquer forma, e as piadas ficam sem timing
-Como absolutamente tudo no jogo é feito de referências, o game em si quase não tem nenhuma personalidade própria. Não é como se ele usasse as referências para ajudar no storytelling, mas sim para cobrir 100% da história com piadas
-Além de muitas piadas simplesmente não terem graça (ou no máximo garantirem um sorriso de canto de olho), elas ainda são voltadas para o público que vivenciou ou tem curiosidade nos anos 80 e 90, principalmente no quesito de cultura americana ou inglesa. Então, se você não gosta dos anos 80, não conhece muito sobre a década e não fala inglês... é, sinto muito
-As missões são divertidas, sim, mas extremamente repetitivas
-Há algumas mecânicas que simplesmente parecem fora de lugar, como uso de cover, stealth e travamento de mira
-Alguns power-ups mais atrapalham do que ajudam
-Às vezes a dificuldade do jogo aumenta absurdamente, não de uma forma desafiadora, mas sim frustrante

Se eu recomendo a compra? Bom, claro... principalmente agora depois do patch DX. Mas, ainda assim, apenas em promoção. Por 10 reais, eu não posso reclamar de nada. Mas, acima disso, eu me arrependeria um pouco. Não por ser um jogo ruim, mas sim porque você começa jogando com a maior empolgação do mundo, e o game vai te decepcionando e frustrando aos poucos.",1418933774,1424575631,True,0,1,0.42667621374130249,0,True,False,False,False,,,

Pixelated and chiptuned, you’ll know that exact feeling from the minute you start the game and hit the start screen.
 
Retro City Rampage plays more like an NES game than any other recent title I can remember, and not just from the style. The controls are tight and limited, but jumps are very hard to land. This becomes frustrating later in the game, as Mario-esque head stomps are required to dispatch certain foes. This does not translate well into 8-direction movement, as you tend to slide all over the place trying to land on a character the size of a dinner plate. Vehicle controls are fine, however, which is a benefit since you’ll spend an extended time zooming around the town in the various cars you snatch, GTA-style.
 
While I felt that Evoland took a good idea and didn’t take it far enough, Retro City Rampage doesn’t have that problem. The creators of the game seem to have first-hand knowledge of the golden era of videogames, and pop culture references come flying by – I’m very sure that there were several that I missed completely. Saved By the Bell, Back to the Future, Terminator, G.I. Joe, Sonic the Hedgehog – the list goes on and on, right up to recent memes that still managed to find a way in. With this amount of references, it would be an easy thing to feel inundated by all of the content being thrown at you, but I never felt like it was too much, or going too far.
 
There are a few difficulty spikes that are frustrating, particularly with the combat, as some enemies are simply bullet sponges that will require you to strafe and jump and shoot like a madman. There is a simple lock-on feature, but I felt it was somewhat unreliable as I tried to clear rooms of enemies. Wide-spread weapons, such as the rocket launcher, gained primary use for me, as I just had to aim in the general direction of some foes. When it came time for me to face those same weapons, however, I felt almost helpless. Plus, the end boss of the game doesn’t fit into the rest of the game’s dynamic at all – the end stages are completely based upon Rad Racer, which really serves as a knuckleball to the game’s pacing and would have served better as a side-mission somewhere else in the game.
 
The game has a healthy amount of content, with a few side-missions and some achievements to chase as well. You can play through the game once again in Turbo Mode once you’ve completed the adventure at least once, though personally I felt like I had my fill after the first play-through. I may return to the game down the line, for achievements, although I am satisfied with the time I spent with it.
 
Recommended for those who haven’t yet tired of the “new indie game in a retro style,” as long as it’s on sale. It makes for a good weekend play.",1418093337,1418093337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

I just can't seem to get into this game. The introduction to the game is hard to follow. It's like everything's on speed, and they tried to add as many retro references they could into as short a time as possible. The graphics are reminiscent of games of old, but the picture is so incredibly busy, it's hard to register what you're actually seeing. It doesn't help with all the achievement and unlock popup messages that seemingly constantly pop up on the already busy screen. Controls feel really awkward, and what you're supposed to do exactly isn't always clear.

The biggest issue for me though, is that it's not really any fun. There's nothing pulling on me here, unexpectedly.

The game had a lot of love put in to it, the music is incredible and I had to download the soundtrack afterwards and I still listen to it every once in a while.

The map can get a bit convoluted and collectables are a bit annoying to find even with a guide because of the shoddy graphics but it's still do-able with some focus.

References has always been the part of every sector of the entertaintment industry. Musicians puts hate or love to their lyrics, as the reference to someone or something, most of times, it has affected them. Directors and screenwrites puts to their movies references of another famous movies or people affected movie industry. And so, game developers trying to put references of games, poeple who are/was or affected gaming industry. And sometimes, we can find developers from diamonds, who puts references of all kinds, into their game - Vblank Entertaintment. 
These guys made out of nothing something and that's Retro City Rampage (RCR) - [b]little indie game, which contains more references, that megabytes that game has.[/b]

Most epic adventure for those, who was born before 1990, and biggest nightmare, and ""Lost World"" for those who wasn't. RCR be like - A-Team GMC van gonna run over you. Green pipes from Mario are everywhere. Brown Dog from my childhood is everywhere. First mission and first reference totally blew me away. School bus runs through the wall of the bank, to stole looted money alias the Batman. And so, almost every minute, you'll find something, from your childhood, or not only.

Difficulty and game-design of this game is just tribute to good old video-game machines - tough difficulty, dozens of secrets,  score multipliers, memorable characters, unblockable characters, crazy weapons, aliens and sh*t. 

If you looking for nostalgia, and wants to go back to your childhood, go for indies, Playstation 1/2 or Retro City Rampage.
Salute to you Vblank.

PS: Main parallel of the game is Back to Future movie from 1985.

PS2: Between the writing of this review and this update, the game has been updated to DX version which is another thumbs up.

This game could not be more appropriately titled. Rampage you say? You're damn right it is and I couldn't be more happy about it. To picture it, imagine a mashup of your favorite 8-bit video games from the 80's with some early 'Grand Theft Auto' thrown in for good measure. Which is totally awesome if you ask me, and makes for one of the best retro gaming experiences of all time; in my opinion, of course.

Playing through this game, you're sure to pick up on various themes and obvious and also obscure references to old Nintendo classics such as levels taken directly from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (that damn water level, for instance), sounds from the Mega Man series, and the track design from one of the best racing games of all time: Rad Racer, to name a few. The plot is also a mash-up of sorts as it's basically taken directly from 'Back to the Future' with sprinkles of 'Ghostbusters' and other popular 80's movies as well. Can you imagine, both 'Ghostbusters' and 'Back to the Future' in the same game? It doesn't get much better than that, folks. 

Actually, now that I think more about it, this game is just one big barrage of nonstop old-school references to video games and movies from the 80's. But as I said, there's nothing wrong with a little nostalgia. And if you grew up playing games like 'Link to the Past', 'Mario Bros', or any of those fantastic early NES titles, then this game will make you feel like a kid again; in a good way. You know, like having no responsibilities other than to wipe your own butt after using the bathroom, or brushing your teeth before bed, or doing your homework the night before, or...hell, just pick this game up already. You will not be disappointed. And even if you are, what did you expect from a kid?",1404746167,1427586603,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False,False,,,

The game is a parody of many others such as GTA, Metal Gear Solid, Sonic, and much more!  It's packed with references to other games and even game development.

The first half of the game is just running around having fun.  Once you get to the second half though, it's no more fun and games.

The game is nearly 100% a reference/parody of the 80's (including Back to the Future, Ghostbusters and TMNT) or popular NES games at any time (including Mario, Mega Man, and Rad Racer). It's very charming and doesn't take itself too seriously.
One of the coolest features is the graphical options. You can change your ""television"" to several different sets, including an arcade cabinet or a Gameboy. You can also change the color settings to look like an NES, Super NES, Sega Genesis, Atari 2600, Gameboy, and many more. You can even turn on scan-lines for an authentic 80's CRT TV experience.
My only gripes with this game are particular levels. The underwater levels are overly difficult and frustrating.
Another level pits you against several rocket launcher-wielding goons with little to fight back with; defeating them is pure dumb luck.
The final boss fight is initially interesting and stylish, but quickly becomes overly difficult and unfair. 
Other than these few issues, the game is incredibly fun and I would reccomend it to anyone.

At first I was thrilled with the world and it's characters, the game doesn't even remotely take itself seriously.  With nods to practically every game and movie out there it seemed flowing with jokes, the colorful city reminded my of the original GTA.

But one I got down to actually playing I was sorely dissapointed.  The combat is basically win or die, with no health upgrades or body armor in the game you basically can only take a few hits before you die, and you will die a LOT!  Your character can't even swim!

The aiming system with the guns...confuses me to say the least, I really don't get the lock-on system.  The game features like, 10 melee weapons...all of which do as much damage as your first does, with the exception of the sword, and except for dying you can't get rid of a weapon you don't want.

As for the wanted system, it more or less works like GTA, and for a game that is supposed to be about rampaging it fills fast enough.  But it also sometimes fills for no reason at all, I was literally just sitting outside my house cycling through my melee weapons and the wanted system went to full red, a glitch I would assume...if it didn't happen again and again.

I could go on and on, but basically they tried to make a nice little shoot-em up game with nods to every ""oldie"" game and movie, which by itself is a nice concept, but as an actual game this one blows...hard.",1403571638,1403571638,False,15,0,0.563608050346374512,0,True,False,False,False,,,

- Геймплей очень легко освоить.
- Сюжет довольно прикольный и интересный. Порой, запутанный, но так даже интереснее.
- Свобода действий. Перед вами небольшой город, где есть чем заняться. От различных заданий и квестов, до различных развлечений. А можно и просто побегать по городу и постреляться с полицейскими или выполнять сюжетные задания.
- Не обошлось без юмора. О да, юмор - это как раз то, чего не хватает многим играм.
- Графика? Ха-ха-ха. Кому нужна графика, когда игра и так великолепна? 
- Возможность изменять своего персонажа. Можно сменить ему причёску в парикмахерской. Набить тату в тату-салоне. Можно купить персонажу личный скейт.

Ceux que le trailer n'a pas déjà fait fuir seront ravis de savoir que Retro City Rampage tient la plupart de ses promesses, humbles mais nombreuses. Plus qu'un simple GTA-like minimaliste qui pioche allègrement dans les copyrights des jeux 8 bits, des films des années 80 et du jeu vidéo indépendant d'aujourd'hui, c'est un immense petit foutoir à la prise en main immédiate. Le scénario justifie différentes phases d'action et de gameplay toutes arrachées au siècle dernier ; cette variété de situations empêche le joueur de se lasser voire de s'endormir durant la courte campagne (6 heures de jeu) consolidée par de nombreuses missions et mini-jeux annexes. Entre variété, esprit old school et bien sûr d'innombrables personnages et licences qui nous reviennent avec des noms et des allures déformés façon made in China, le public ciblé devrait revenir satisfait de l'aventure.

Du côté des déceptions, l'aspect parodique était l'occasion de faire rire, Retro City Rampage se contentera de faire sourire. L'humour n'est en effet pas vraiment intelligent ni même assez con pour être drôle, les messages qu'il distille au travers de caricatures grossières ne le sont pas non plus ; et pourtant difficile de ne pas s'enthousiasmer d'embarquer le Doc' avec soi dans sa DeLorean pour aller tabasser un estraz du docteur Robonik, le tout sur une musique MIDI entraînante. Une accumulation de références pas forcément subtiles ni bien exploitées mais qui, empilées les unes sur les autres, contribuent au charme du titre. Dans ses gameplays, ses graphismes, ses sons et même la bordure de l'écran qui mime une grosse cathodique comme on les aimait tant, Retro City Rampage est un mashup des saveurs de l'époque, un cupcake multicolore aux goûts de la NES, des VHS de la collection ""200% action"" avec Stallone ou Schwarzy et bien sûr du bol de Chocapic. Alors oui le jeu a le défaut d'être une parodie qui manque d'humour, accumule plutôt que maîtriser, appuie tellement sur l'aspect rétro qu'il pourrait passer pour rétrograde.

Jedná se o hru, která čerpá inspiraci z osmdesátých a devadesátých let. Hrajete za postavu jménem Player a vaším úkolem je získat součástky na opravu stroje času. Děj se odehrává ve městě Theftropolis, po kterém se můžete volně pohybovat. Máte také možnost si kdykoliv od ostatních obyvatel „vypůjčit“ jejich dopravní prostředek, pro rychlejší přesun na požadované místo. Musíte si ovšem dávat pozor na policii, která pro tento druh výpomoci nemá pochopení.

Hru lze označit jako parodii, určenou hlavně starším hráčům. Nebere se totiž vůbec vážně a neustále pomrkává po lidech, kteří pamatují hry z osmdesátých let. Těšit se tak můžete na několik postav z herní historie, ale také na filmové hrdiny té doby. Dočkáte se také retro grafiky a zvuků, které odpovídají danému období. Za zmínku stojí i skvělá hudba, která dotváří povedenou atmosféru.

Příběh je vyprávěn pomocí jednotlivých misí, které se spustí ve chvíli, kdy dorazíte na označené místo. Některé z nich se odehrávají přímo v ulicích města, jiné pak v interiérech. Ve většině z nich dojde na souboje a přestřelky, hra proto nabízí několik chladných i střelných zbraní. Player také ovládá jednu mocnou bojovou techniku – skákání. Nejen že dokáže přeskočit letící kulky, ale dokonce umí eliminovat protivníka skokem na hlavu.

Potěší také rozumné umístění záchytných bodů, takže když v průběhu mise selžete, nemusíte ji plnit znovu od začátku. Při opakovaném neúspěchu se navíc ukáže obrazovka s několika tipy, které vám mohou pomoci. Kromě příběhových misí, můžete také plnit vedlejší úkoly. Například závodit na čas nebo se pokusit o maximální destrukci svého okolí.

Pokud tedy máte náladu na herní parodii, ohlížející se do minulosti, pak máte mé doporučení. V opačném případě ale koupi dobře zvažte, tenhle stroj času totiž nemusí sednout každému.

Yea!The shooting is good, a varied amount of game play types from the NES era and the story and starting references will make you smirk and remember the old days of NES games

Meh! But the reference parodys quickly lose their novelty as your constantly bombarded with them. Controls are extremely akward and most of the time it is difficult to perform what you want to( from stomping on guys to driving).

Bleh! The difficulty ramps up towards the end making it vastly more frustrating then challenging. Being crammed into small coriders where you get pummeled by 1 hit kill rockets or thrown into rooms with out a weapon and guys having guns could result in many many level restarts. The final boss is also a frustrating expierience with the need for pixel perfect  percision(which the akward controls makes difficult) and timing.


The Lowdown: I really wanted to like this game but just couldn't, the controls are akward in almost all aspects and this is with trying a controller and keyboard. The game starts off great but quickly loses its flavor of fun. The references come out like they are being forced(should of cutdown on them and fleshed out some more of the more popular ones). The difficulty changes midway to a point where it becomes frustrating  when you after to do the same level forty times due to you missing a set of triple jumps by a few pixels to you being stuck in a 2 block hallway where 6 guys shoot bazookas at you killing you in 1 shot before you can get your own shot off. Its a joke and a waste of time that you could be playing other games that actually make difficulty fair.Beating a gmae should feel like an acomplishment, but this one i was just glad that I was able to remove it from the backlog and off the HDD.

Retro City Rampage - довольно редкий пример игры-пародии, в которой помимо очевидных отсылок к кинематографу и играм 90-ых есть свой собственный, оригинальный юмор. И юмор этот высокого качества.
Сама игра - то, как выглядела бы GTA на NES (более известная в России как Денди): открытый мир с кучей магазинов, побочных заданий, ""пасхальных яиц"" и секретов. Здесь можно ездить на кроссовере-орангутане, а можно купить крутой скейтборд в магазине, можно купить себе очки/шляпы/бионическую руку, а можно выпить молока и словить наркоманский приход. А какие здесь миссии - отобрать у местного миллиардера Брюса Биффа его усадьбу с подземным логовом, а затем примерить костюм городского супергероя Биффмана, помочь Доку починить его машину времени, побыть охотником за привидениями и поджаривать людей с помощью протонного бластера, даже придется драпать от девушки, которая залетела от главного героя. В общем - всего не перечислить, это лучше увидеть самим.
Сама игра захватывающая и интерес к ней не теряется на всем протяжении игры, в отличии от многих игр-пародий. Но есть одно ""но"", которое сильно испортило мне игру - финальная гонка и схватка с боссом. Я понимаю, что авторы хотели влепить напоследок побольше ностальгии, но гонка на пиксельной трассе с препятствиями, да еще c ужасным 3D-эффектом, из-за которого все двоится-троится и который нельзя выключить... Это, мягко говоря, перебор и насилие над глазами игроков, за что ставлю игре на балл ниже.

It works fine with a keyboard but the game is more difficult and less enjoyable to me.

This game is a game full of suprises and yet so much cliché, where you go wtf and say ""ahaha now i get the reference"".
The game is kind of a parody of the old gta games, talking about gta 1-3, where you run around in an open world and do quests and sidequests (or fuck around and do what you want). When you start the game however you instantly notice this is a throwback to the past with references for movies, news and games from the 90's and early 2000's. The basic gameplay is you running, stomping and killing enemies and getting from point a to b. Unlike the old gta games you can get a highscore for killing and stealing stuff which makes free roaming more enjoyable, but the main part of the game are the quests. So far being 5 hours into the campaign i found it extremely enjoyable to find the references in these missions. The missions often contain new power-ups, minigames, new characters and items to keep the game interesting for longer playthoughs. Retro city rampage also has a good sence of humor and made me laugh several times. The animations are quite good as well altough they are pretty simple sprites. Something i have to mention, i like to play the game for around 30 min.-1 hour everytime i play. I think that the game might start to bore you after playing it for more than 2 hours in one playthrough.

Overall i love the stylized graphics and great music a lott, altough if the references can't interest you or if you are to young to get them the game loses some of it's potential. If you like getting highscores, have a good laugh and do quests where you get struk by references at every corner this game is something for you! If you would would like a game with some good mechanics, lotts of minigames and some hours of gameplay you might also like retro city rampage. This game does not have multiplayer for people looking to play with friends!

The BTTF shit in of itself is wasted anyway because nothing in the game world (if you bother exploring it before the 1st mission) actually changes even though you've supposedly time-travelled a number of years into the future/past(the game never makes it clear on which one it is which goes to show how little thought they put into it). Yup, they made the whole game a time-travel plot just to wax nostalgia over one freaking film that not everyone is going to have that sort of attachment to.

Most of the side-content such as the challenges and mini-games are a joke and take almost no effort to get gold on. Most of the weapons are identical other than how much damage they do and apart from the speed shoes, the power-ups all feel like an after-thought the developers force you to use in certain missions in an attempt to get you to care about their existence.

The graphics, whilst I get are supposed to match the look of a NES game, are lazy- most of the game world looks the exact same despite being so small, the actual character sprites are fuckin microscopic and have almost no detail so everyone's basically a pallete-swap of each-other with the only distinguishing features being hair/hat. I understand this was originally supposed to be a homebrew NES game (EDIT: proto of said NES game is playable in the DX version, it's cute to look at... for about 5 seconds), but they really shot themselves in the foot in the graphics department by trying to make it ""authentic"", especially when I can think of God-knows how many actual NES games with better graphics than this.

The soundtrack is HUGE and there's a decent amount of variety but you barely get to hear any of the good tracks in the actual game unless you fiddle about with the radio stations cos they all play in the story missions which only last around 4-5 minutes at most cos, as I said, this game is too easy. Otherwise get used to listening to the same 3-4 songs throughout the game that get annoying really fast.

For a game that took 7 years to make and kept me waiting for almost 2 years after I first heard about this game before it came out, I was pretty damn disappointed.

Un comparto sonoro curato, con una immensa colonna sonora.
Il gioco è intriso di humor, a tratti sarcastico, tenuto in sù da mille riferimenti, videoludici e non.

È carino, ma fino a che punto?
La storia è molto superficiale. I copiosi dialoghi, sebbene divertenti, non sono l'ideale per un gioco d'azione.
Missioni tecnicamente ripetitive e poco stimolanti.

L'aspetto, indubbiamente, peggiore del gioco è il caotico gameplay. 
Tutto succede troppo in fretta. Non si ha il tempo di scoprire una nuova feature del gioco che ne spunta un'altra.
I negozi sono sparsi nella monotona e piccola città in maniera impercettibile, a tal punto che non ho mai sentito la necessità di cambiare più di due volte acconciatura.
Gli eventi si susseguono così velocemente e così incoerentemente che si fa fatica a ricordarli.
Altri elementi, come inopportuni cuori sparsi per la città, negozi che vendono armi facilmente ottenibili dai nemici e la completa inutilità di avere un fondo cassa (visto che non c'è nulla di allettante da comprare nei negozi), mi inducono a pensare che, parte degli elementi del gioco, siano stati forzati.

La mia opinione, riguardo questo titolo, è sospesa.
Da una parte, sento che, dietro ""Retro City Rampage"", c'è tanto lavoro e tanta passione da parte degli sviluppatori; dall'altra, considero il titolo ancora troppo immaturo da molti punti di vista.

Ad ogni modo, Se non fosse stato per i riferimenti alla cultura nerd, questo titolo non avrebbe riscosso tanto successo.

-Second of all, while I still stand by my opinion that the controls are awkward, it they can be bypassed using a control.
-Third, after playing around for a while, I did eventually get the mods to work.  While the community still appears split on whether it works or not, I'm going to review it for what I have.

Once you made it through the handful of training missions, the game opens up substantially, and you can keep both: the comedy and the action rolling at your own pace. Some of the comic moments are so thick that it can at first feel oppressive. Nobody will laugh at everything, BUT everybody will laugh at SOMETHING in this game!

Of course you can keep attention to all missions but the most of your fun will consist of freeroaming the city and just raising hell! It’s easy to spend hours with it because the game always offers enough to keep you busy. For example whenever you start to kill people (with driving, shooting, punching or otherwise) the police will follow you and you get the feeling of a gangster on escape.

Story focuses on a guy simply named player who was working on a bank heist with the Jester until he time travels to the year 20XX where a young scientist names Doc Choc finds him and helps him get back to his year, 1985, by finding pieces of the time machine which breaks down when you travel

И так играть нам придется за бандита,выполняющего основные миссии и уровни-испытания.
В основных миссиях  мы встретим множество знакомых персонажей из 80,90-ых годов.
8-битная графика и вид сверху делают свое дело,играть очень интересно,а из-за свободного мира и относительно большого города игра не наскучит.
В игре большой выбор оружия,начиная от гитары и заканчивая плазменным оружием.Так же есть апгрейд оружия.
Как я уже говорил игра напоминает гта 2,а это значит,что можно угонять автомобили(выбор весьма велик) и делать перестрелки с полицией.
Насчет уровней-испытаний-поберегите нервы,конечно не мит бой,но попотеть придется.
Итак мы имеем идеальную 8-битную игру,в которой есть все,начиная от ностальгии и заканчивая сюжетом,поэтому не поленитесь и купите,24 рубля-гроши для такой прекрасной игры.

Retro City Rampage (RCR) originally started as ""Grandtheftendo"", an unofficial NES port of the first GTA. Later, the author decided to keep the same spirit (retro, 8-bit looks and sounds) while expanding the game way beyond the NES capabilities. Then RCR was born.

It obviously looks and plays like GTA (the first one, with top-down view), but it is a satire of the old (and new?) games, and includes uncountable references to other games and movies and pop-culture and stuff.

It is not a difficult game, although some mini-games are quite hard.
It gives you a smile very often, when you see something unexpected or absurd happening, or when the game throws yet another reference at you.

É difícil criticar, já que o jogo é a homenagem definitiva aos mais famosos games de 8 bits de todos os tempos. Se você jogou Master System e Nintendinho, vai identificar vários games ao longo do gameplay, e isso eu garanto, essas ""homenagens"" são super engraçadas e muito bem solucionadas.

Retro City Rampage tinha tudo pra ser mais uma obra de arte indie, mas o problema é que o jogo tem graves defeitos de jogabilidade. Os controles são extremamente imprecisos e os recursos do game (armas, mapas, itens, carros) são bem crus e mal resolvidos. Eu acho que o dev teve a brilhante idéia de um game open world a la GTA, mas com todas as limitações e problemas dos games de 8 bits não deu certo.

Se você jogar, vai entender que o jogo não é difícil por seu grau de dificuldade. Na verdade são os controles que não funcionam! A dificuldade não está na exigência de uma destreza específica. A dificuldade está na falta de controles precisos e por conta disso você simplesmente não consegue controlar seu personagem.

No final das contas, a história é bem chatinha, o game se torna extremamente repetitivo, o mapa não te convida a explorá-lo e os gráficos, que era pra ser algo ""legal"", acaba limitando o game.

Retro City Rampage tem um Metacritic de 71. Eu não conseguiria dar nota maior. A idéia é ótima, mas muito mal executada.

RCR feels out of place on PC as it is constantly reminding you of its tedious and confusing key mapping; and even when you map the keys yourself, it still feels wrong. Different game mechanics, like the mario jump attack, do not work on keyboard, and as a PC gamer it pains me to see they did not put much time into thinking it through properly. 

It is hard to give this game a 'no' recommendation. RCR is a game filled with lots of things to do, from playing retro arcade games, to playing a brutal version of Paperboy, and it constantly tells funny jokes hinting at other retro titles. But it just does not work on PC as it feels like too much of a console port.

Although this game does have full controller support, i would recommend players play it on its true platform; that being the PlayStation 3.

The story is ridiculous and amazing.  It's essentially a random assortment of old school video game jokes and internet memes that are somehow woven into a narrative that is better than most storylines coming from games these days.  You'll be laughing the whole way through this game.

The gameplay is very simple, top down old school GTA style with more of an 8 bit feel and a combination of driving, shooting and platforming.  It's very easy at first but the difficulty ramps up later in the game and definitely when trying to 100% the game.  Very reminiscent of a challenging NES game.

What can I say about the art design?  It's 8 bit, it's awesome, exactly what it should be.

The sound is incredible.  Most of the music sounds very familiar to old favourite NES classics.  Certain tracks made me feel pumped as I raced to the next mission.

Achievements are mixed bag of story progression, jokes and completion.  To get all achievements will be a challenge but to those true completionists getting all the achievements and 100%ing the game will be a rewarding pain in your ass.

In reality, it's a parody that, like many other parodies, is only funny for a little bit.   It's a romp through nerd culture from the 1960's to present, primarily in the realm of video games and television.   This leaves a vast source of material to cover, and unfortunately, it makes the novice mistake of trying to hit on way too much at once. 

Gameplay-wise, the game is so-so.  It plays like GTA 1 (the old one) but the best vehicle, from what I've seen, is the super-speed boots that let you run over people with the force of a speeding train.   There are early and wonderful nods to Doctor Who, Back To The Future, old-school Metal Gear, and many other games, movies and shows.   Unfortunately, they are wrapped in a plot that seems like Beavis and Butthead wrote it from a cartoon rehab center somewhere.   The parodies either drag on or are barely touched and then abandoned.  Eventually, you will lose interest in the plot and just tool around trying to make money (which is far too easy), and try to find new things to do.  

One of my biggest gripes about this game really had to be the implementation of player-earned penalities.   It makes sense if you become a raging alcoholic, you turn into a fatass and nobody likes you (see the Fable series).   That's not how this works.  Instead, you wander into a ""noodle shop"" and buy mushrooms....and half of them hurt you.  One, especially at low levels, can kill you dead.   You can't tell by the names; it all seems like a good time.    Nintendo-hard choices of how to get digitally stoned make no sense, especially when you can die.  Even in the 80's, ""Winners dont' use drugs"" was about as far as any game took it before handing you a hero that pops painkillers and drinks liquor to heal themselves. 

I do like one little easter egg; your ""home base"" allows  you to play an old console video game.  That game is an alpha build of Retro City Rampage.   I'd love it if more games did this (how badass would GTA V be if you coudl play GTA 1 in the arcades?).   Try it, though.   When you feel how unpolished the alpha build was....and how the game feels pretty much exactly like that version....you'll want your money back.

He took the idea for the Rom Homebrew ""Rom City Rampage"" and built on it ten fold...The result is a HUGE sandbox retro styled 8 bit GTA type game. The gameplay is solid and the ENTIRE game is filled with all sorts of great 80's and 90's pop culture references/parodies. Movies, TV, Video games. You name it. Heck, in the opening gameplay/tutorial there are at least 10 great video game references that most gamers will recognize right away. They come fast, so keep your eyes peeled!

This game has COUNTLESS HOURS of great gameplay. There are plenty of side missions, minigames, and badge/high score runs that you will never get bored. That doesn't even include the storyline missions that are required to ""beat"" the game. Tons of vehicles, enemies and ""outfits"" for you to mess around with. 

I am impressed with how perfectly the developer made the game play and feel like an 8 bit game, yet made sure that the game plays flawlessly.

    Retro City Rampage is hilarious, action packed, and above all, fun to play. I haven't played too many sandbox games other than Minecraft, but I easily jumped into this game with few problems. It's everything the first two GTA games were, and plenty more. Decent sized map, full of secrets and multiple characters to play as in free-roam mode, including Super Meat Boy and Commander Video. Even though I've heard people say that the game lacks it's own ideas, and that is sort of true. The game is a massive parody of tons of stuff from the 80s and 90s. Featuring Back to the Future, Metal Gear Solid, Contra, Duck Hunt, and many, MANY more.
    The stroy is very confusing at first, which is a down side, but once you get into it... at the least hilarious and kinda creative. The levels themselves are usually fair and difficult. However, that being said, due to the awkward controls (believe me, you'll know what I mean if you buy the game or already own it) and the level design itself can be downright ridiculous, the levels aren't always fun.
    Overall, the game is fun, hilarious, and at some points creative. 8/10",1391916038,1394157068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,False,,,

На мой взгляд, смесь получилась неудачная. Первые части GTA я любил и люблю не смотря на их возраст. И уж если повторять забытые хиты, то повторять на их уровне, понимая, что некоторые люди их не забыли. А у создателей Retro City Rampage это не получилось. Больше всего разочаровала динамика транспорта: автомобили и мотоциклы поворачивают не плавно, а под строгими ретро-углами, которые не столько ретро, сколько раздражающие. Мотоциклы сделаны казуальнее и проще, чем в первом GTA: они движутся медленнее, а падают неохотнее (в частности, мотоцикл, на котором сидит главный герой). В GTA1, помнится, мотоциклы были для безбашенных смельчаков. Они носились как угорелые, а любая заминка выбрасывала водителя из седла. Здесь же мотоциклы похожи больше на маленькие машинки.
Сюжетная кампания до нельзя линейна. Казуально-консольные чекопинты ведут вас по каким-то коридорам, заставляют делать то одно, то другое. Разработчики их стараются разбавлять вагонами пасхалок и шуток, но общую картину это не спасает. В тех же GTA были лихие, интересные и сложные миссии про настоящих бандитов. Здесь же - сплошная комедия.
Зачем-то в ранних миссиях дают покататься на танке, хотя танки всегда были хороши как раз тем, что являлись аки ангелы с небес и карали особо зарвавшихся преступников. Танков боялись. Здесь же - это очередное авто в сюжетной веренице каких-то машин.
Система оружия и денег сделана плохонько. Отчасти она испорчена дополнительными ""фишками"" - прыжками (в том числе на голову врагов аля марио).
Есть и незначительные, но всё же странновато-глупые мелочи. Например, полицейские, бегающие с УЗИ. Не разбираюсь в американской полиции достаточно подробно, но никогда полицейских с УЗИ не видел и ассоциируются они совсем не с полицией. AI полицейских вообще заставляет задумываться. Они разучились перекрывать дороги, почему-то часто неудачно подрезают главного героя, т. е., например, обгоняют слева и затем резко поворачивают тоже налево. Водители обычного гражданского транспорта тоже поражают своей твердолобостью. Когда им стреляешь прямо в лобовое стекло автомобиля, тормознув на дороге, они сидят и не выходят. Чего ждут, смерти? Военные, которые приезжают на мой взгляд, когда уже трупами завалено пол города, бегают за машиной пешком, стреляют из автоматов и бросаются под колеса.
Что касается звуков и музыки, то они все такие ретро-ретро. Может, я не ценитель, но слух немного режет. Звуки убоги, NPC молчаливы, музыку не спасает даже многообразие радиостанций.
Не могу правда не отметить, что к счастью такая вот инди-игра идет нормально и на относительно старом компьютере (в отличие от какого-нибудь Binding of Isaak).
В итоге игра получилась посредственной. Вместо того, чтобы порадовать олдскул-геймеров добротной вариацией GTA с видом сверху, разработчики решили отшучиваться. Предлагаю вам тоже отшутиться и не покупать эту игру. Ну, если только вы не плачете над грязными картриджами от денди ""1000 игр в 1"".

Le ambientazioni sono belle, piene di dettagli in stile pixel art anni '80 eseguita a regola d'arte e si possono applicare molti effetti alla grafica che permettono di regolare la quantità di colori e stile legato ai vari computer che andavano in quel periodo storico.

Tutto il gameplay è basato sulla possibilità di interagire con l'ambientazione allo scopo di uccidere i passanti lanciandogli addosso oggetti, investendoli o usando mezzi più pesanti. In tutta la città è possibile entrare in un paio di interni, senza poi poter interagire con nessun personaggio, se non sempre con la solita dinamica di lanciare oggetti o sparare.
Non c'è profondità d'esplorazione, una volta fatte le prime 5 missioni, si ha il senso di rigiocare le stesse con la sola differenza delle location degli obiettivi che comunque sono sempre somiglianti tra loro.

La trama è priva di un senso, con un personaggio principale gratuitamente maleducato senza riuscire nell'intento di essere comico, e risultando principalmente infantile, maleducato e noioso. Non esiste dialogo se non con l'unico personaggio guida del gioco.

Peccato, perché visivamente è monumentale, per tutto il resto, nonostante l'alto livello di cura dei dettagli pecca di linguaggio e scarse meccaniche di gioco, che al giorno d'oggi così come sono intavolate qui non possono essere esaustive.

Se te caerá la lagrimilla!!! Veamos algunos de sus puntos buenos y malos:

- El mapa es pequeño y bastante repetitivo. Prepárate porque te puede aburrir un poco. Sabías que era estilo retro pero no sabías cómo de bien iba a aguantar un juego así en la actualidad.
- Las misiones son las clásicas del tipo ""ves y mata a aquél"", ""lleva a esta persona a tal sitio"", ""recupera tal objeto"", ""tienes tanto tiempo para hacer esto""... En general, bien, pero las que consisten en ir matando al personal llegan a ser un poco insufribles porque cuando te los cargas a todos salen más, y así te puedes tirar un buen rato. Y si encima te matan, tendrás que volver a empezar la misión. Hubieron algunas misiones en las que mancillé el nombre del juego a conciencia.
- Presta atención a los detalles. El juego está lleno de alusiones a los 80 y 90.
- Los subtítulos son francamente mejorables.
- Los retos son un poco aburridos.
- Podemos cambiar la apariencia del juego para que juguemos como en un monitor monocromo o en una tele CRT o un montón de opciones más!!!
- Hay variedad de armas.
- El prota es un macarra de sala de billares, y podemos cambiarle el peinado!!!

Bien. Esto es lo principal. Tan sólo decirque que si siempre estás dando la paliza con que si ""los juegos de ahora nosequé..."", hazte con él que lo disfrutarás.

Ее закрома неистощимы, и она с первой до последней минуты буквально бомбардирует вас новыми ощущениями, черпая их в вашем же собственном прошлом. Если вам кажется, что это неинтересно, то мы явно говорим на разных языках.
При желании у игры можно найти много недостатков: некоторые автомобили ездят слишком медленно, интерфейс далёк от совершенства, к графике и звуку надо привыкнуть. Но Retro City Rampage — это шанс погрузиться в объятия ностальгии, в те времена, когда только-только начиналось знакомство с играми. Подборка уморительных пародий и выворачивание на изнанку современных жанров не дают заскучать. В свою очередь, зубодробительные схватки с боссами и прочие сцены «с приветом из прошлого» держат в напряжении. Превосходная возможность заглянуть в альтернативную игровую реальность.

The idea is that it's an open world crime game like GTA, but it's set in video game land filled with parodies of almost any video game character you can imagine. It's a brilliant idea, and fortunately the game mostly lives up to this great concept even if it falls short in some areas.

The game plays as you'd expect out of an open world crime game. However, the game tries to have a much better variety of mission styles. It doesn't try to be only standard A to B shooting. The game tries to mix it up by including missions that are arcade-like or based on old NES games. Thanks to this the variety is incredible and every other mission mixes up the gameplay in some way, so you'll rarely get bored. The quality of the missions do vary however. A good amount of the missions are fun and challenging, but others tend to be a little shallow and funnled, not leaving a lot of room for experimentation. On the whole though, the biggest problem with the missions in this game is that they're all a bit short.

The pacing of the whole game is crazy fast, so it's a very quick experience and missions end quite fast sometimes. Unfortunately this leads to my biggest problem with the game; the main campaign is not very long. You can try to take it slow and try not to rush through, but the game is so fun you won't want to stop. It isn't criminally short though, it can last to about 6-7 hours. Just don't expect a 15-20 hour long campaign. The game offers a challenge and it gets really brutal at times. Don't get me wrong the game is not unbeatable, it's just some of the levels do not hold back on challenge, so there is a good amount of authentic NES-style difficulty. Expect to get a bit frustrated at times if you're not used to that kind of thing.

The game has a pacing problem narrative-wise as well. It seems like the game was supposed to have a somewhat deep storyline and characters but that aspect seems to have been scrapped before the game's release. So as a result, if you were looking for an engaging story, you'll be disappointed. It's extremely fast paced, and has a lot of unrelated events and characters you see once or twice then never again, there's just no focus. That doesn't mean it's horrible though, since it manages to be entertain and the humor is mostly well done. The characters are also interesting and there's always something new and amusing around the corner. 

The parody aspect is extremely well done. Basically, the whole world of RCR is one big parody. The characters in it are cleverly de-branded counterparts of famous characters, and basically everything else is a reference to something from the 80's, the 90's, or sometimes the 2000's. The whole city you explore is chock full of parodies and pop-culture references, it's pretty fun to explore. However it's a little 'look but don't touch'. The city is just kind of....there. It's fun to look at, but it's not very interactive and you can't go into most of the buildings. The city is also a bit small as well which is a little disappointing, but understandable if there was not much dev time to spare or it couldn't be bigger due to the NES limitations, possibly both (yes, the game's engine has limitations very similar to the NES). The sprites are small as well which is kind of jarring in contrast with all the amazing pixel art in the game. They're not very detailed, but there is a zoom mode if you want them to be bigger. Just keep in mind that it doesn't make the sprites more detailed, it just makes them larger.

The music in this game is composed by 3 different guys including the legendary ""virt"" (Jake Kaufman), and they each have their own style. The soundtrack in this game is very, very good. It sounds extremely authentic, so it's almost as if they were ripped out of an actual old NES game. The only problem I have with the music is that during cutscenes, it switches between songs in a weird way. Like one shot shows something and there's a song in the background,  then when it changes to a different shot showing something else, it switches to a entirely different song that's completely unrelated to the previous song that was playing, so the cutscenes sound a bit weird at times. Also I know an in-game radio like in GTA is probably hard to code, but in this game you don't get a feeling that it's playing songs on other stations without you. So sometimes, it sounds like it starts playing the same song every time you switch to a certain station.

Overall though, RCR is a very fun and unique game combining all the pop culture from the 80's and 90's into one game, so the nostalgia due to the sheer amount of references gets pretty intense. Also, the game has a lot of variety and and some genuinely good humor, so you'll rarely get bored during the short but sweet campaign. The game may have not truly lived up to it's great concept, but it was pretty damn close. I think there is a lot of potential for this concept, with just a few tweaks, a sequel to this game could possibly be one of the best indie games ever.

EDIT: After some rethinking, I've decided to recommend this game. You have to keep in mind that I waited quite a while for this game, and it didn't live up to the extreme expectations I had, so I set myself up for disappointment. So at first it was more of a personal review instead of an objective one. So I changed it to be more objective and recommended the game. The game still has some hefty flaws, but it's still a fun romp no doubt.",1386101340,1409703935,True,277,1,0.765591323375701904,1,False,False,False,False,,,

The graphics are meh, although I understand that's the point. The arcade-like borders around the game come off as pointless to me, thankfully they can be disabled in the options menu easily.

The story is an excuse plot; acceptable for this sort of sandbox game, and of course allows you to run around a variety of enviroments parodying games of the era. However, again, if you weren't part of the era, most of the references will sail over your head.

The game has a gorgeous retro-appeal and it's chock-full of funny jokes and references to gaming and 80s pop culture. The best feature of the game are the dozens of different vehicles, weapons and powerups you get to use, most of which are pretty out there. You can drive the car from Back to the Future, wield a sword and shield and fling yourself in the air by farting. All of these can be used to wreak delicious havoc on the city streets.

RCR also offers a lot of bang for your buck. Aside from about 50 story missions, there's two dozen rampages (wreak havoc in a certain way), you can replay some of the sections from the missions for highscores, dozens of skins, multiple color palettes (make it look like a NES or a C64 game), you can play the original version of the game made for the NES and play mods that change the look of the game.

The game is (or was) not entirely without its faults though. While some of the story missions were great fun with a lot of variety, some were also a bit tedious or frustratingly hard. The developer has done a great job dealing addressing those issues though, issuing a few patches that made the frustratring levels more accessible. These imperfections don't ruin the game though.

In the end, the good stuff far outweighs the bad stuff. Take a look at the trailer and if you like what you see, then you won't be disappointed with how the game turns out.

Es un juego de acción sandbox con una cámara y manejo al estilo de los dos primeros GTA, aunque tiene muchas misiones donde el control cambia completamente.

    El juego parodia muchos videojuegos, series y peliculas de finales de los 80 y principios de los 90 como Batman, Cazafantasmas, Contra, el Equipo A, Mario Bros, Metal Gear, Monkey Island, OutRun, Paperboy, Regreso al Futuro, Sonic, y las Tortugas Ninjas, y muchos más. De hecho este es su principal atractivo, si te gustan los juegos antiguos y gráficos retro te gustara el juego.

  La duración de las misiones principales no es muy larga, casi 6 horas he tardado yo; aunque se puede acabar en menos dependiendo de la habilidad del jugador. Las primeras misiones son sencillas pero conforme avanza el juego va aumentado la dificultad y las últimas misiones pueden llevar muchos intentos completarlas. Cuenta también con un modo libre, desafios y misiones secundarias que dan muchas más horas de juego.

+ You can change in the main menu whenever the graphics should be a retro remix or original 8-BIT colors.

+ The already mentioned arcade.

+ GOOMBA STOMPING!!

+ Your acquaintance, Doc Browns less successful cousin, Doc Choc!

+ You can unlock secrets and reveal different playable characters and skins! 

+ An completely perfect experience on a 360 controller!

+ A soundtrack that would make AVGN swoon :3

+ Challange during heated fights with the cops!

+ Очень активный и разнообразный геймплей.
+ Куча пародий и отсылок. 
+ Сами шутки тоже на высоте.
+ Яркая 8-битная графика.
+ Качественная чиптюн-музыка.

Спорные стороны:
? Для понимания большинства шуток нужно ознакомиться с первоисточником.
? Музыка со временем надоедает.

Что не понравилось:
- Нередкие затянутые миссии.
- Частые мельтешения раздражают глаза.

Итог: Retro City Rampage вызывает неоднозначные реакции у игроков. Для некоторых это - старомодный платформер с видом сверху, созданный для заработка на чувствах геймеров старой школы. А для некоторых это - идеальная возможность размять свои пальцы и заодно вспомнить те времена, когда пиксели были больщими, трава в играх была ядовито-зеленого цвета, приставки ""ломали телевизор"", видеомагнитоффон сжевывал кассету, а песни группы ""Руки вверх!"" казались еще нормальными.

Lovely premise, absolutely balls execution. This dyed heap of diarrhea is barely playable. In a failed attempt to recreate the difficulty of the so-called retro games, it's unbearably painful to play, especially the second half of the game. 

A few things are done right. It's occasionally funny, but tries a little too hard at times. The soundtrack is pretty sweet and hits the retro spot perfectly. However, once you actually start to play, all the good things get buried under a massive pile of failure. Bugs, unexplainable mechanics, pathetic controls and uninspired gameplay, only to name a few.

Unless you're looking for a night filled with frustration, simply don't buy this game. If you need your fix for old skool games, actually play the real deal, not this half-arsed attempt at blending 50 games into one.

+ Pretty funny

The references ground my gears more than the gameplay.

The real recommendation here is the developer. Brian Proviciano is a Carmack level magician who fiddles around with ancient hardware and creates 100%-hardware accurate ports of this game in Assembly. The game itself accomodates to every level and flavor of nostalgia. You can even play the game in EGA or on a simulated Game Boy screen, for crying out loud!

Retro city rampage is a spoof of several games and movies and will throw you for a thrill ride. The easiest comparison to this game is 8-bit grandtheft auto/saints row chaos. You will classicly only have your 3 hearts as lives inwhich you'll need to find more throughout your world as you do whatever the hell you want.

This game is packed with random missions and mini-games for the player to do alongside the random main storyline of the player. Long story short, you're in a pixel world and your a ganster... GOOMBA STOMP. yes, they allow you to goomba stomp. Ontop of goomba stomping you have a large arsinal of weapons at your disposal that you will pick up between smg's pistols, cricket bats, baseball bats, crowbars and stealing peoples cars to run over masses of people.

Overview:
Pros: The randomness and silly chaos of this game is exciting and never gets boring along with the dozens of chaos filled mini-games scattered about such as USE THIS TANK AND BLOW UP THINGS TO GET POINTS or use a smg to shoot as many things to get points ect. Its a relatively silly game and has spoofs that people will instantly know when they come up such as back to the future and mario's goomba stomp.

Cons: The only cons about this game that may bother someone is if you do not save frequently - this is a retro game you will lose all your things even if you have hearts remaining. This may frustrate some people as they lose their mass arsinal of weaons.

Final thoughts: when this game is on sale for a few bucks I would highly reccomend picking it up if you're into 8-bit chaos. The graphics reminds me a little of terraria and its alot of fun to casually play every so often.

I've got tons of fun out of this game and I hope you will too. Also there are some neato bonuses of cool characters you can unlock.

With a soundtrack consisting of music by virt (Popular chiptune artist was has worked on Ducktales Remastered and lately Shovel Knight), Freaky DNA and Norrin Radd. Retro City Rampage has that definitive early era sound to go with it's old-school inspired graphical style. Since I wrote this review, there has been updates which allows sprite and palette modding as well as the prototype rom of Rom City Rampage followed by 30fps mode (Perfect for some older PCs)

The graphics look sweet , there's a lot of passion in it. It's visible from the start. I also enjoyed the references to 80's games, shows and movies. All great stuff.
Same goes for the music and sounds, nothing to complain here.

The missions, however, are a different story. Like any other game it starts off easy. Then suddenly missions become more difficult and even frustrating. And after that they somehow become eas(y)(ier) again. Wait, what ? There's no consistency here.

I finished the game in 8 hours (which should've been 6-7), but if you want to buy and play everything I think you can add a few hours to that number.

A decent game, nothing more, nothing less. Is it worth it ? You decide !

It's kind of tiring.  The fundamental game is really well built and is fun to play, but over time it just doesn't feel enjoyable.

This is strange since Retro City Rampage is full of unique content, and the game always keeps you doing different things.  The story mode is just an excuse to string you along from one referential set piece to the next, but what's interesting is that many references take the form of one-off gameplay homages rather than merely verbal shout-outs; I think that's rather novel—interacting with references to interactive things where the reference is the kind of interacting you do.  I don't think I've seen that before, and here is an entire game made out of it.  Also, it's rather remarkable to note how flexible the basic mechanics are as they reproduce the mechanics of other games without actually changing.

The controls are well thought as well, you can move around with the arrow keys and fire in different directions with WASD and even lock on targets. Driving is also well made but it can get a bit dodgy at times for the sake of retroness.
