Anyway, you fight against the slices by splashing the gelatin at them, either using energy bombs or telekinetic pulses, depending on which armaments you purchase from saving up clouds of magnetic money gas.  (This story is my personal interpretation.)

It's actually kind of fun once you figure out how to build up harmonic motion to generate strong enough splashes.  Notice that your own motion compresses the gelatin in front of you.  If you take advantage of this and also save up enough magnetic money gas to get some of the pulse weapons, it becomes like a surreal shooting game.

《QUALIA 3: Multi Agent》是一款由Shindenken, EXTREME制作，Degica和MASAYA GAMES联合发行的清版射击类游戏。游戏讲述了在漆黑的深海中，若是想获得生存的权利，就需要不断的挑战并战胜自己的对手，汲取他们的能量，从而进化为强力的捕食者，站在食物链的顶端！

[h1] 游戏的体验 [/h1]
刚打开游戏的时候，我以为我玩得是一个白细胞消灭病毒，细菌的游戏，虽然游戏带有射击的标签，但是实际上的射击更像是安放一个定时炸弹，时间到了之后，则会爆炸，炸毁敌人，也正是这样的设计让游戏的感觉变得不同，我们需要不断的去预判自己的炸弹如何攻击到敌人，而且刚开始因为不是很熟悉，可能会觉得攻击敌人甚至很有难度，这时就需要不断的去适应，还好关卡的设计也是循循渐进的，前面会有一些比较简单的敌人来让我们去消灭，敌人红色的部分是它的中心，将它破坏掉可以重创敌人，有着不错的效果，在打败敌人的同时我们还可以汲取他们的能量来强化自己，所以想要强大，收集也是非常重要的。关于游戏不好的地方，我个人觉得是画面有点太过于简单，而且网状的设计并不是很适用于所有人，对于审美比较高的人或者网状恐惧症的玩家来说，可能并不是很合适。

[h1] 游戏总结 [/h1]
总的来说，游戏还是具有一定可玩性，若是喜欢可以尝试一下。

TLDR: Play Geometry Wars, Retro evolved or Spore, or even Sparkle2 Evo. This is just just all these things and many more blended together and wrapped up in unsatisfying gameplay mechanics and bland featureset.

No resolution options whatsoever. This is a one screen only wave survival in which you must place bombs bomberman style in the hope of clearing the board. You can then collect little yellow orbs from the dead foes to upgrade your character sprite into a more complex lifeform. The game is on hexes, but hexes distort around as you engage in movement making the board feel unpredictable and rather unpleasant to have to lay mines on. The whole bomberman concept fails flat on its head, where the only thing you can do is spam bombs and try to bait the enemy into walking towards you.

It need some time to get used to the game. It has some mechanics from a shoot'em'up, but not shooting on the players side. Instead some ""ripple graviational deformation"" are created by bombs and ""inversion bombs"". The ripples are visualized with a dynamic grid.

Check the official webpage, as it contains some more explanation than the ingame help.

The initial ""ship"" is a bit weak. Nevertheless with some experience it is possible to beat at least everything up to boss number 4, even with this ship. Tipp: use both weapons quickly one after the other while rotating the ship, therefore positioning the bombs close together.

One main shump mechanic is the move or get killed one, which applies strongly here. But as there are no long range weapons (at least the first upgradeable ones are not), it is necessary to get close to moving enemies. This is what makes up a lot of the fun of the game.

The enemies (I played up to boss 4) are all  very nice, challenging, partly innovative. Graphics is ok, a bit generic, but practical, as it does not overfill with effects which are not directly linked to the game mecanics, as many other games have.

Das ist es nicht, zumindest nicht in dem Sinne. Es ist eher Bomberman im Stil von Geometry Wars unter Wasser. Allerdings nur Singleplayer. Auch hier gilt es geometrische Formen in einer grafisch minimalistischen aber wunderschönen Arena zu zerstören. Diese werden freilich im Laufe der acht Level immer Stärker und am Ende wartet stehts ein spektakulärer Boss. Die Zerstörung geschieht hierbei jedoch meistens durch eine Art Bomben mit Zeitzünder, eben wie in Bomberman, die Gegner sind verschiedene Tiefsee-Organismen und man selbst ist ebenfalls ein solches. Und zwar eines, das aus drei Teilen zusammengesetzt ist: Kopf, Mittelteil, Hinterteil. Und weil der Überlebenskampf in der Tiefsee hart ist, gilt auch hier wie überall in der Tierwelt: Survival of the fittest. Um zu überleben, müssen wir uns weiterentwickeln, d.h. zum Glück nicht, Jahrmillionen zu warten, bis sich unser Organismus im Laufe er Evolution an die neuen Bedingungen angepasst hat, sondern aktiv die Energie einsammeln, welche unsere Gegner verlieren. Damit lassen sich dann neue Teile für unseren Körper kaufen und die Zusammensetzung unserers Körpers lässt sich neu kombinieren. So statten wir unseren Organismus z.B. mit Stärkeren Bomben und mehr Lebensenergie aus. Dabei müssen wir aufpassen, denn sobald man vom Gegner verletzt wird, ist die Energie, die erbereits verloren hat, verschwunden für uns verloren
Der Clou am Spiel ist aber eigenlich der, dass das Geschehen in den Arenen einer realistischen Wasserphysik unterworfen ist. Und das macht dieses Spiel wirklich einzigartig: Wenn ich eine Bombe zünde, erzeuge ich Schwingungen. Diese werden durch das Gitternetzt, das unter das Geschen gelegt ist, sichtbar. Das ganze Gitter verformt sich, bei starken Explosionen. Dadurch werden die Feinde in ihre einzel-Komponenten zerteilt und bieten bessere Angriffsfklächen. Aber auch Angriffe, ruckartige bewegungen - alles erzeugt schwingungen, die das Spielgeschehen beeinflussen. Zugleich bewegen sich aber auch die aufsammelbaren Objekte ebenso wie die Feinde, wenn ich starke Schwingungen erzeuge. Es gilt daher, auf der Jagt nach Beute und Im Kampf gegen Feinde stets bedacht vorzugehen. Hirnloses Bombenlegen führt selten zum Erfolg.

You play as a small CREATURE* moving around in a box above a net of hexigons, you fight against small THINGS* that bunch together to make one larger creature which you can KILL* by using your weapons to create ripples on the net.
Sounds simple right? well it is a bit trickyer then that, you have to create a fairly large wave to damage the enemys and after the first level you will have to get creative.

ゲームシステムは簡単にいうと衝撃で波をぶつけてダメージを与えるゲームです。
初期では、波を爆発させる爆弾と、波を収縮させるものを装備しています。
この二つを使って攻撃するのですが、おそらく最初は意味がわからないと思います。
ですので、両方のボタンを同時に連打して固めて置いてみましょう。
そうすると集まった波が爆発で飛んでいって敵にダメージが当たり、なんとなくルールがわかってくるはずです。
アイテムは固めて大きくすると強化ポイントが沢山貰えるのですが、ダメージを受けると消えてしまいます。ですので最初は無理せずこまめに回収しましょう。
何回かステージをこなし5000ポイント貯まったら2段目の押してる間に収縮のパーツを買うと進めるのが凄く楽になるはずです。
いままでのシリーズではアイテムで体力を回復できたのですが、今回は回復がないので無理やり敵を倒していく攻略ができません。
ですので、基本戦略は敵が湧くエフェクト中に攻撃し、赤いコアパーツをすぐに破壊してしまうことです。そうすると雑魚は脳を持たなくなり攻撃してこなくなります。

要は爆弾攻撃なのだが、波の威力が高くないとダメージを与えられないルールなので、
爆風の外側に敵が当たっても弱くて倒せない。

ダメージを与えるためには、超近距離で爆破させるか、複数の波を重ねて波状攻撃するしかない。

First off, whoever said this game's just bad or doesn't play like a shooter... didn't play much, it's obvious they probably got stuck with the ""place timed bomb"" power and never moved forward...

REVIEW
This game feels pretty unique as a shooter, it's not actually a shooter in a strict sense, but it feels like one, let me explain:

CONCEPT
You maneuver a creature that's made of 3 parts, a head, a body and the fins, each part has a specific power or bonus that changes the way you can approach enemies, however the point of the game is to distort the ""net"" of the arena so that the enemies get stretched into it and eventually explode, at the end of each stage there's a unique boss.

RPG-FEATURES
There are parts that make you place timed bombs (I'm lookin at you, bad reviewers >.>) which can be used to wipe clusters after significant stretches to the net (meaning the fins do the big job, in this setup), some that make you greatly distort the net in front of your head (which results in a very precise snipe, or shot if you like that stuff...), some wings actually distort the net to form wave-like motions which, if moving fast enough (and accurately as well) can wipe whole clusters of enemies, some others suck-in enemies while running away from them (circle works too, actually better),
there are also bodies that empower health and movement.

TACTICS
Now, combine said parts to make your own playstyle (either fit the one needed for the stage) and consider this, while ""swimming"" you cause waves through the net... let's pick the snipe-head mentioned previously, if aimed correcly gathering enough speed, swimming towards enemies empowers the ""shot"", because you are moving the waves towards them.

MONSTERS
The monsters in these arenas usually come in clusters, actually it's a single sentient being that comes with meat parts (non-moving, non-attacking), shaped parts (those shoot or attack in some motion), and purple parts (which function as the creature's brain, dispose of those and it won't move any longer).
It's also worth mentioning that whenever you manipulate the net these monsters react differently, some may come closer to you from behind, some try to dodge predicting your route, things can get hairy quickly if you don't pay much attention to how you manipulate the net because it's made by squares and less squares to travel (stretched wide net) means faster movement (ie: movement=5 squares per second).


MY OPINION
It could take a while to adjust to this game as it's rather original (which I appreciated, very), but it's rather good, especially if you are bored of the usual projectile-hell shmups (either you don't appreciate that design).

TIP
On a note, the game requires some grind to gather points to buy the different parts (so spend'em WISELY), you might want to check other players' videos to see which parts they are using and what they do, because every body part does different things (and some parts are very expensive).
The game doesn't seem to have a proper tutorial (considering the ""net"" mechanic), and I forgot to mention that... If an enemy gets too close or shoots, it hurts you...


ABOUT THOSE COMPLAINING MONSTERS DON'T DIE
They die from a single snipe with one of the head parts... a suck-in from some fins... waves correctly placed... basically anything done CORRECTLY works, really, yea, just one shot, now go and stretch that net.

After spending as much time as I could stand with Qualia 3, I have to ask, who is this for?

Somewhere in the deepest darkest part of the ocean, something really boring and annoying is happening. You're some sort of microscopic organism, and you have to destroy amoebas with bombs. Actually strike that, you don't destroy them with the actual explosions, you uh..smash(?) them with the ripple effect? It's like some interactive visual simulator, but it's also a game. You have a health meter, you can die, and most of the achievements involve taking no damage or finishing stages quickly.

I'm going to lay out what your experience with this game is going to be like. You'll play the first stage, you'll have this look on your face like you just saw a horrific car accident. The cause of the accident was a drunk cat. Do you ask yourself  ""Why was a cat driving a car?"" or ""Why was it drunk?"" Before long the questions pile up:
""Who gave a cat a drivers license?""
""Was the cat at a bar?""
""Which bar?""
""How are the drinks?""
""Any attractive women?""

And then you complete stage 1. No really, I think the purpose of that stage was to wander in circles while trying to ineffectively destroy amoebas with the ripple effect...or???? Nothing seems to make sense but it doesn't matter, because you beat the first stage. You're on the winning road.

For completing trophies you're rewarded with cash. This is where most of your money is going to come from, so spend it wisely. One of the weapons you're given at first is the ability to absorb ripples. I guess this is supposed to improve the ripples of the bombs you place. Wouldn't it be better to simply have more explosions? So you buy the upgrade that spreads a bunch of bombs over a small area. This proves to be effective in stage 2. You're clearing those amoeba far more quickly than before.

But then you reach the stage 2 boss, and...that's it. The game is over, pack it up, throw it out the window. Why? Unless you've actually managed to figure out the mystery of the ripples, you'll spend the boss fight doing next to no damage. You'll place bombs like a nutty peanut, create a ton of ripples, but nothing will happen. I looked on youtube for some strats. Sure enough there's a guy that actually speedruns this game. He uses a weapon that creates ripple WAVES. He presses a button and the ripples smash entire lines of amoeba with ease. This thing is 10,000 times more effective than fiddling with bombs. Unfortunately it's really dang expensive. With enough grinding and a few more trophies you could probably afford that weapon, and go on to complete the game.

Or you'll just play something else, something that's actually enjoyable within seconds of pressing the start button instead of not at all. Qualia 3 is an enigma. Who does this appeal to? Is there more to it? Why is it so obtuse? You can be like me and allow the questions to form a mountain, a mountain that eventually crushes your skull.

Your combat revolves around the parts (3 of them) you equip, giving you different firing style and stats for your character, as well as how your movement is morphing the environment which in turn varies the way your projectiles will move as well as the enemy.

At first, it kind of felt hard, it wasn't easy getting your bombs to detonate right in front of your enemies' faces when both sides are moving. Your bombs are affected by your surrounding, which are in turn, affected by your bombs, your movements, and the enemies' movements. This surrounding of yours is very important because it will affect everyone's movement. You can drop absorbtion bombs which will compress the surroundings, dragging everything, bombs, enemies (and you!) into it like a black hole. You can even absorb them to yourself, (be careful of letting them touch your head! Your hitbox is in your head) causing them to follow you in a line and crushing each other. Spin around in a circle, and your enemy will ball up and crush each other to death (or be crushed by the surroundings)

It's hard to explain. I found this game fun because there's a slight tactic to it. Simply placing bombs at the enemy's location might not work, and you would have exploit the enemy's patterns and your own abilities to be able to blow it up. You can also do the tactic above, carefully compressing the space in the surrounding and forcing the enemy to be squished by the web or by each other.

The main problem of this game is that killing enemys is a chore. With bigger groups it has a decent challenge but when the group is cut down to 3-5 individuals it takes to long to kill.

I dont like the fact that it advertises itself as a shoot em up as the only way to attack is to place bombs everywhere. It's interesting and the only problem I have with it is what I said as above and that placeing bombs dosnt count as a shootemup but you do get shot at. 
I wish this game came with a tutorial because as I said above, you can place bombs on enemys and it wont do a thing when theres a few left. Because of this I didnt know if I was playing it right or not.
Also with small groups not getting hurt the same thing applies to 2 bosses I have encountered but worse. They seem to be invincible at times not getting hurt at all only for you to do a small amount of damage. If theres an opening for when your supposed to hurt it I dont know what it is plus I wait 3 or 5 seconds before I spam it with bombs for a good 10 seconds
Note: The bombs themselves dont kill them its the waves and ripples the bombs make. If you do get this game I find the minibombs to be the worse one to use. Still find it hard to kill them.

GOOD:
One thing I do like about this game is the risk reward it has. The power orbs which play as money lay on the screen disappear when you get hit once and the power orbs can increase in value when they gather into one big orb. 
Another thing I sorta like about this game is that you can make waves with the bombs to try and push them towards enemys,speed up or slow you down.
The designs of the player character and the bosses are cool but the main enemys look like cereal. 

In the end if you love these kinds of games and have more patience with trying to kill a couple of enemys that wont die untill the 3rd bombing attempt youll find some enjoyment with this game. I dont really like it but I might play an hour of it per month or just try to see all the levels then be done with it. Not a bad game but not a good one also as I see it. In the end I have to give it a no that I dont like this game. What really kills it for me is that it takes forever to kill a single guy and that takes up to much time for an action game. Fix that and ill just give this a pass. Mabye its just im more used to bullet hell games.",1397856799,1397917943,False,12,0,0.475192904472351074,4,True,False,False,False,,,

While the description and graphics are definitely intruiging, the actual gameplay was dreadful.

The initial attacks are essentially mines you drop in front of you that move along with the current, which is neat conceptually, but ultimately causes even the initial levels to be overly time consuming since you're spending 5 minutes trying to finish off the last head of the wave only to repeat the next. 

It took 30 minutes to go through the first two levels a couple times, which remained overly time consuming even after I bought the splash weapon upgrade and decided to cut my losses with the game.

The fact the game opened up and screwed up all my other window resolutions was just another obnoxious aspect for the game.

Ultimately a waste of $3 I wish I had spent on skittles.",1397848950,1397867447,False,12,0,0.431669741868972778,2,True,False,False,False,,,
